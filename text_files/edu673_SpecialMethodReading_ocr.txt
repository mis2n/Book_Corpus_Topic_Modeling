PREFACE 
Tuts book is a combination of two earlier volumes, 
namely, “The Special Method in Primary Reading 
and Oral Work with Stories” and “The Special 
Method in the Reading of English Classics.” 
Several of the chapters have been shortened, while 
the chapter of Illustrative Lessons in the latter part 
has been enlarged. 
The purpose has been to discuss, in a practical and 
comprehensive way, the problem of introducing chil- 
dren to our best reading material and to the art of 
reading. 
The entire course of study for reading in the eight 
grades is included in this plan.

COMBINED SPECIAL METHOD IN READING, 
INCLUDING THE ORAL TREATMENT 
OF STORIES 
CHAPTER I 
THE REASON FOR ORAL Work IN STORIES 
Tue telling and reading of stories to children in 
early years, before they have mastered the art of 
readiag, is of such importance as to awaken the 
serious thought of parents and teachers. To older 
people it is a source of constant surprise —the at- 
tentive interest which children bestow upon stories. 
Imost any kind of a story will command their wide- 
awake thought. But the tale which they can fully 
understand and enjoy has a unique power to concen- 
trate their mental energy. There is an undivided, 
unalloyed absorption of mind in good stories which 
augurs well for all phases of later effort. To get 
children into this habit of undivided mental energy, . 
of singleness of purpose in study, is most promising. 
In primary grades, the fluttering, scatter-brained tru- 
ancy of thought is the chronic obstacle to success in 
study. 
The telling or reading of stories to children natu-

rally begins at home, before the little ones are old 
enough for school. The mother and father, the aunts 
and uncles, and any older person who delights in 
children, find true comfort and entertainment in re- 
hearsing the famous stories to children. The Mother 
Goose, the fables, the fairy tales, the “Arabian 
Nights,’ Eugene Field’s and Stevenson’s poems of 
child life, the Bible stories, the myths, and some of 
the old ballads have untold treasures for children. If 
one has a voice for singing the old melodies, the 
charm of music intensifies the effect. Little ones 
quickly memorize what delights them, and not sel- 
dom, after two or three readings, children of three 
and four years will be heard repeating whole poems 
or large parts of them. The repetition of the songs 
and stories till they become thoroughly familiar gives 
them their full educative effect. They become a 
part of the permanent furniture of the mind. If the 
things which the children learn in early years have 
been well selected from the real treasures of the past 
(of which there is a goodly store), the seeds of true 
culture have been deeply sown in their affections. 
The opportunities of the home for good story- 
telling are almost boundless. Parents who perceive 
its worth and are willing to take time for it, find in 
this early period greater opportunity to mould the 
lives of children and put them into sympathetic touch 
with things of beauty and value than at any other 
time. At this age children are well-nigh wholly at 
 
-P-A-G-E-13
  THE REASON FOR ORAL WORK IN STORIES 3 
the mercy of their elders. They will take what we 
give them and take it at its full worth or worthless- 
ness. They absorb these things as the tender plant 
absorbs rain and sunshine. 
a he kindergarten has naturally found in the story 
one of its chief means of effectiveness. Stories, 
songs, and occupations are its staples.) Dealing with 
this same period of early childhood, before the more 
taxing work of the school begins, it finds that the 
children’s minds move with that same freedom and 
spontaneity in these stories with which their bodies 
and physical energies disport themselves in games 
and occupations. 
It is fortunate for childhood that we have such 
wholesome and healthful material, which is fitted 
to give a child’s mental action a well-rounded com- 
pleteness. His will, his sensibility, and his knowing 
faculty, all in one harmonious whole, are brought 
into full action. In short, not a fragment but the 
whole child is focussed and concentrated upon one 
absorbing object of thought. 
( The value of the oral treatment of stories is found 
in the greater clearness and interest with which they 
can be presented orally. There is a keener realism, 
a closer approximation to experimental facts, to the 
situations, the hardships, to the sorrows and triumphs 
of persons. The feelings and impulses of the actors 
in the story are felt more sharply. The reality of the 
surrounding conditions and difficulties is presented so 
 
-P-A-G-E-14
  4 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
that a child transports himself by the power of sym. 
pathy and imagination into the scenes described. 
: There is no way by which this result can be accom- 
plished in early years except by the oral presentation 
of stories. }. Until the children have learned to read 
and have ‘acquired sufficient mastery of the art of 
reading so that it is easy and fluent, there is no way 
by which they can get at good stories for themselves. 
Average children require about three years to acquire 
this mastery of the reading art. Not many children 
read stories from books, with enjoyment and appre- 
ciation, till they are nine or ten years old; but from 
the age of four to ten they are capable of receiving 
an infinite amount of instruction and mental stimulus 
from hearing good stories. In fact, many of the best 
stories ever produced in the history of the world can 
be thoroughly enjoyed by children before they have 
learned to read. This is true of Grimm’s and Ander- 
sen’s stories, of the myths of Hiawatha and Norse- 
land, and of the early Greeks, of the Bible stories, 
the “ Arabian Nights,” “Robin Hood,” besides many 
other stories, poems, ballads, and biographies which 
are among the best things in our literature. 
In these early years the minds of children may be 
enriched with a furnishment of ideas of much value 
for all their future use, a sort of capital well invested, 
which will bring rich returns. Minds early fertilized 
with this variety of thought material become more 
flexible, productive, and acquisitive.
-P-A-G-E-15
  THE REASON FOR ORAL WORK IN STORIES 5 
For many years, and even centuries, it was sup- 
posed that early education could furnish children with 
little except the forms and instruments of knowledge, 
the tools of acquisition, such as ability to read, spell, 
and write, and to use simple numbers. But the sus- 
ceptibility of younger children to the powerful cul- 
ture influence of story, poem, and nature study, was 
overlooked. 
We now have good reason to believe that there 
is no period when the educative and refining influ- 
ences of good literature in the form of poems and 
story can be made so effective as in this early period 
from four to ten years. That period which has been 
long almost wholly devoted to the dry formalities and 
mechanics of knowledge, to the dull and oftentimes 
benumbing drills of alphabets, spelling, and arithmeti- 
cal tables, is found to be capable of a fruitful study 
of stories, fables, and myths, and an indefinite exten- 
sion of ideas and experiences in nature observation. 
But the approach to these sunny fields of varied 
and vivid experience is not through books, except 
as the teacher’s mind has assimilated their materials 
and prepared them for lively presentation. 
(The oral speech through which the stories are 
given to children is completely familiar to them, so 
that they, unencumbered by the forms of language, 
can give their undivided thought to the story. Oral. 
speech is, therefore, the natural channel through 
which stories should come in early years)} The book
-P-A-G-E-16
  6 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
is at first wholly foreign to them, and it takes them 
three years or more of greater or less painful effort 
to get such easy mastery of printed forms as to gain 
ready access to thought in books. A book, when 
first put into the hands of a child, is a complete 
obstruction to thought. The oral story, on the con- 
trary, is a perfectly transparent medium of thought. 
A child can see the meaning of a story through oral 
speech as one sees a landscape through a clear win- 
dow-pane. If a child, therefore, up to the age of 
ten, is to get many and delightsome views into the 
fruitful fields of story-land, this miniature world of 
all realities, this repository of race ideas, it must 
be through oral speech which he has already acquired 
in the years of babyhood. 
It is an interesting blunder of teachers, and one 
that shows their unreflecting acceptance of tradi- 
tional customs, to assume that the all-absorbing prob- 
lem of primary instruction is the acquisition of a new 
book language (the learning to read), and to ignore 
that rich mother tongue, already abundantly famil- 
iar, as an avenue of acquisition and culture. But we 
are now well convinced that the ability to read is an 
instrument of culture, not culture itself, and prima- 
rily the great object of education is to inoculate 
the children with the ideas of our civilization. The 
forms of expression are also of great value, but they 
are secondary and incidental as compared with the 
world of ideas.
-P-A-G-E-17
THE REASON FOR ORAL WORK IN STORIES F 
There is an intimate connection between learning 
to read and the oral treatment of stories in primary 
schools which is very interesting and suggestive to 
the teacher. Routine teachers may think it a waste 
of time to stop for the oral presentation of stories. 
But the more thoughtful and sympathetic teacher 
will think it better to stimulate the child’s mind than 
to cram his memory. The young mind fertilized by 
ideas is quicker to learn the printed forms than a 
mind barren of thought. Yet this proposition needs 
to be seen and illustrated in many forms. 
Children should doubtless make much progress in 
learning to read in the first year of school.2-But 
coincident with these exercises in primary reading, 
and, as a general thing, preliminary to them, is a 
lively and interested acquaintance with the best 
stories. It is a fine piece of educative work to cul- 
tivate in children, at the beginning of school life, a 
real appreciation and enjoyment of a few good stories. 
These stories, thus rendered familiar, and others of 
similar tone and quality, may serve well as a part of 
the reading lessons. It is hardly possible to cultivate 
this literary taste in the reading books alone, un- 
relieved by oral work. The primers and first readers, 
when examined, will give ample proof of this state- 
ment. In spite of the utmost effort of skilled 
primary teachers to make attractive books for pri- 
mary children, our primers and first readers show 
unmistakable signs of their formal and mechanical 
character. They are essentially drill books.
-P-A-G-E-18

8 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
It seems well, therefore, to have in primary 
schools two kinds of work in connection with story 
and reading, the oral work in story-telling, reproduc- 
tion, expression, etc., and the drill exercises in learn- 
ing to read. The former will keep up a wide-awake 
interest in the best thought materials suitable for 
children, the latter will gradually acquaint them with 
the necessary forms of written and printed language. 
Moreover, the interest aroused in the stories is con- 
stantly transferring itself to the reading lessons and 
giving greater spirit and vitality even to the primary 
efforts at learning to read. In discussing the method 
of primary reading we shall have occasion to men- 
tion the varied devices of games, activities, drawings, 
dramatic action, blackboard exercises, and picture 
work, by which an alert primary teacher puts life 
and motive into early reading work, but fully as 
important as ali these things put together is the 
growing insight and appreciation for good stories. 
When a child makes the discovery, as Hugh Miller 
said, “that learning to read is learning to get stories 
out of books” he has struck the chord that should 
vibrate through all his future life. The real motive 
for reading is to get something worth the effort of 
reading. Even if it takes longer to accomplish the 
result in this way, the result when accomplished is 
in all respects more valuable. But it is probable that 
children will learn to read fully as soon who spend 
a good share of their time in oral story work.
-P-A-G-E-19
THE REASON FOR ORAL WORK IN STORIES 9 
In discussing the literary materials used in the first 
four grades, we suggest the following grading of 
certain large groups of literary matter, and the rela- 
tion of oral work to the reading in each subsequent 
grade is clearly marked. 
Ora Work. READING. 
ast Grade. Games, Mother Goose. Lessons based on Games, etc, 
Fables, Fairy Tales. Board Exercises. 
Nature Myths, Child Poems. Primers, First Readers. 
Simple Myths, Stories, etc. 
2d Grade. Robinson Crusoe. Fables, Fairy Tales, 
Hiawatha. Myths and Poems, 
Seven Little Sisters. Second Readers, 
Hiawatha Primer. 
3a Grade, Greek and Norse Myths. Robinson Crusoe. 
Ballads and Legendary Stories. Andersen’s &Grimm’s Tales. 
Ulysses, Jason, Siegfried. Child’s Garden of Verses. 
Old Testament Stories. Third Readers. 
4th Grade. American Pioneer History Greek and Norse Myths. 
Stories. Historical Ballads. 
Early Biographical Stories of Ulysses, Arabian Nights. 
Europe, as Alfred, Solon, Hiawatha, Wonder Book. 
Arminius, etc. 
This close dependence of reading proper, in earlier 
years, upon the oral treatment of stories as a pre- 
liminary, is based fundamentally upon the idea that 
suitable and interesting thought matter is the true 
basis of progress in reading, and that the strengthen- 
ing of the taste for good books is a much greater 
thing than the mere acquisition of the art of reading. 
The motive with which children read or try to learn 
to read is, after all, of the greatest consequence.
-P-A-G-E-20
ESS: rr 
10 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
The old notion that children must first learn to 
read and then find, through the mastery of this art, 
the entrance to literature is exactly reversed. First 
awaken a desire for things worth reading, and then 
incorporate these and similar stories into the regular 
reading exercises as far as possible. 
In accordance with this plan, children, by the time 
they are nine or ten years old, will become heartily 
acquainted with three or four of the great classes 
of literature, the fables, fairy tales, myths, and such 
world stories as Crusoe, Aladdin, Hiawatha, and 
Ulysses. Moreover, the oral treatment will bring 
these persons and actions closer to their thought and 
experience than the later reading alone could do. 
In fact, if children have reached their tenth year 
without enjoying those great forms of literature that 
are appropriate to childhood, there is small prospect 
that they will ever acquire a taste for them. They 
have passed beyond the age where a liking for 
such literature is most easily and naturally cultivated. 
They move on to other things.. They have passed 
through one great stage of education and have 
emerged with a meagre and barren outfit. 
The importance of oral work as a lively means of 
entrance to studies is seen also in other branches 
besides literature. 
In geography and history the first year or two of 
introductory study is planned for the best schools in 
the form of oral narrative and discussion. Home
-P-A-G-E-21
  THE REASON FOR ORAL WORK IN STORIES Il 
geography in the third or fourth year, and history 
stories in the fourth and fifth years of school, are 
best presented without a text book by the teacher. 
Although the children have already overcome, to 
some extent, the difficulty of reading, so great is the 
power of oral presentation and discussion to vivify 
and realize geographical and historical scenes that 
the book is discarded at first for the oral treat- 
ment. 
In natural science also, from the first year on the 
teacher must employ an oral method of treatment. 
The use of books is not only impossible, but even 
after the children have learned to read, it would 
defeat the main purpose of instruction to make books 
the chief means of study. The ability to observe 
and discern things, to use their own senses in dis- 
criminating and comparing objects, in experiments 
and investigations, is the fundamental purpose. 
In language lessons, again, it is much better to use 
a book only as a guide and to handle the lessons 
orally, collecting examples and stories from other 
studies as the basis for language discussions. 
It is apparent from this brief survey that an oral 
method is appropriate to the early treatment of all 
the common school studies, that it gives greater 
vivacity, intensity, simplicity, and clearness to all 
such introductory studies. 
‘The importance of story-telling and the initiation

    12 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
through the teacher rather than through the book 
are found to harmonize with a mode of treatment 
common to all the studies in early years. 
In this connection it is interesting to observe that 
the early literature of the European nations was 
developed and communicated to the people by word 
of mouth. The Homeric songs were chanted or 
sung at the courts of princes. At Athens, in her 
palmy days, the great dramatists and poets either 
recited their productions to the people or had them 
presented to thousands of citizens in the open-air 
theatres. Even historians like Thucydides read or 
recited their great histories before the assembled 
people. In the early history of England, Scotland, 
and other countries, the minstrels sang their ballads 
and epic poems in the baronial halls and thus de- 
veloped the early forms of music and poetry. 
Shakespeare wrote his dramas for the theatre, and 
he seems to have paid no attention at all to their 
appearance in book form, never revising them or 
putting them into shape for the press. 
This practice of all the early races of putting their 
great literature before the people by song, dramatic 
action, and word of mouth is very suggestive to the 
teacher. The power and effectiveness of this mode 
of presentation, not only in early times but even in 
the highly civilized cities of London and Athens, is 
unmistakable proof of the educative value of such 
modes of teaching. This is only another indication
-P-A-G-E-23
THE REASON FOR ORAL WORK IN STORIES 13 
of the kinship of child life with race life, which has 
been emphasized by many great thinkers. 
The oral method offers a better avenue for all vig- 
orous modes of expression than the reading book. 
It can be observed that the general tendency of the 
book is toward a formal, expressionless style in 
young readers. Go into a class where the teacher is 
handling a story orally and you will see her falling 
naturally into all forms of vivid narrative and pres- 
entation, gesture, facial expression, versatile intona- 
tion, blackboard sketching and picture work, the 
impersonation of characters in dialogue, dramatic 
action, and general liveliness of manner. The chil- 
dren naturally take up these same activities and modes 
of uttering themselves. Even without the suggestion 
of teachers, little children express themselves in such 
actions, attitudes, and impersonations. This may be 
often observed in little boys and girls of kindergarten 
age, when telling their experiences to older persons, 
or when playing among themselves. The freedom, 
activity, and vivacity of children is, indeed, in strong 
contrast to the apathetic, expressionless, monotonous 
style of many grown people, including teachers. 
But the oral treatment of stories has a tendency to 
work out into modes of activity even more effective 
than those just described. 
In recent years, since so much oral. work has been 
done in elementary schools, children have been en- 
couraged also to express themselves freely in black-
-P-A-G-E-24
  14 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
board drawings and in pencil work at their desks by 
way of illustrating the stories told. Moreover, in 
paper cutting, to represent persons and scenes, in 
clay modelling, to mould objects presented, and 
in constructive and building efforts, in making forts, 
tents, houses, tools, dress, and in showing up modes 
of life, the children have found free scope for their 
physical and mental activities. These have not only 
led to greater clearness and vividness in their men- 
tal conceptions, but have opened out new fields of self- 
activity and inventiveness. 
So long as work in reading and literature was con- 
fined to the book exercises, nearly all these modes of 
expression were little employed and even tabooed. 
Finally, the free use of oral narrative in the litera- 
ture of early years, in story-telling and its attendant 
modes of expression, opens up to primary teachers 
a rare opportunity of becoming genuine educators. 
There was a time, and it still continues with many 
primary teachers, when teaching children to read 
was a matter of pure routine, of formal verbal drills 
and repetitions, as tiresome to the teacher, if possible, 
as to the little ones. But now that literature, with its 
treasures of thought and feeling, of culture and re- 
finement, has become the staple of the primary 
school, teachers have a wide and rich field of inspir- 
ing study. The mastery and use of much of the 
preferred literature which has dropped down to us 
out of the past is the peculiar function of the pri-
-P-A-G-E-25

mary teacher. Contact with great minds, like those 
of Kingsley, Ruskin, Andersen, the Grimm brothers, 
Stevenson, Dickens, Hawthorne, De Foe, Browning, 
4Esop, Homer, and the unknown authors of many of 
the best ballads, epics, and stories, is enough to give 
the primary teacher a sense of the dignity of her 
work. On the other hand, the opportunity to give to 
children the free and versatile development of their 
active powers is an equal encouragement. 
Teachers who have taken up with zeal this great 
problem of introducing children to their full birth- 
right, the choice literature of the world suited to their 
years, and of linking this story work with primary 
reading so as to give it vitality, — such teachers have 
found school life assuming new and unwonted 
charms; the great problems of the educator have 
become theirs; the broadened opportunity for the 
acquisition of varied skill and professional efficiency 
has given a strong ambitious tone to their work.
-P-A-G-E-26
  CHAPTER II 
Tue Basis oF SKILL IN ORAL WorkK 
AccEPTING the statement that skill in oral presen- 
tation of a story is a prime demand in early educa- 
tion, the important question for teachers is how to 
cultivate their resources in this phase of teaching, 
how to become good story-tellers. 
It may be remarked that, for the great majority of 
people, story-telling is not a gift but an acquisition. 
There are, of course, occasional geniuses, but they 
may be left out of consideration. They are not 
often found in the schoolroom any more than in 
other walks of life. “What we need is a practical, 
sensible development of a power which we all possess 
in varying degrees. Nor is it the fluent, volatile, 
verbose talker who makes a good oral teacher, but 
rather one who can see and think clearly: one who 
knows how to combine his ideas and experiences into 
clear and connected series of thought. 
We may proceed, therefore, to a discussion of the 
needs and resources of a good story-teller. 
1. Without much precaution it may be stated that 
he should have a rich experience in all the essential 
realities of human life. This covers a large field of 
16
-P-A-G-E-27
  THE BASIS OF SKILL IN ORAL WORK 17 
common things and refers rather to contact with life 
than to mere book knowledge. Yet it is the depth, 
heartiness, and variety of knowledge rather than 
the source from which it springs that concerns us. 
Books often give us just this deep penetrating ex- 
perience, as soon as we learn how to select and 
use them. We need to know human life directly 
and in all sorts of acts, habits, feelings, motives, 
and conditions, — something as Shakespeare knew it, 
only within the compass of our narrower possibili- 
ties. Likewise the physical world with its visible 
and invisible forces and objects besetting us on every 
side. These things must impress themselves upon 
us vividly in detail as well as in the bulk. The hand 
that has been calloused by skill-producing labor, the 
back that aches with burdens bravely borne, the 
brain that has sweat with strong effort, are expres- 
sions of this kind of knowledge of the world. Clear- 
grained perceptions are acquired from many sources: 
from travel, labor, books, reflection, sickness, observa- 
tion. I go to-day into a small shop where heavy oak 
beer-kegs are made, and watch the man working this 
refractory material into water-tight kegs that will 
stand hard usage at the hands of hard drinkers for 
twenty years. If my mind has been at work as I 
watch this man for an hour, with his heavy rough 
staves made by hand, his tools and machines, his 
skill and strong muscular action, the amount and 
profit of his labor, that man’s work has gone deep 
c 
 
-P-A-G-E-28
    18 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
into my whole being. I can almost live his life in 
an hour’s time, and feel its contact with the acute 
problems of our modern industrial life. That is a 
kind of knowledge and experience worth fully as 
much as a sermon in Trinity Church or a University 
lecture. 
The teacher needs a great store of these concrete 
facts and illustrations. Without them he is a car- 
penter without tools or boards. He needs to know 
industries, occupations, good novels, typical life 
scenes, sunsets, sorrows, joys, inventions, poets, 
farmers —all such common, tangible things. Even 
from fools and blackguards he can get experiences 
that will last him a lifetime if they only strike in and 
do not flare off into nothingness. 
Social experience in all sorts of human natures, 
disposition, and environing circumstance is immedi- 
ately valuable to the teacher. ‘ 
Close acquaintance with children, with their early 
feelings and experiences, with their timidity or bold- 
ness, with their whims or conceits, their dislikes and 
preferences, their enthusiasms and interests, with their 
peculiar home and neighborhood experiences and 
surroundings, with their games and entertainments, 
with the books and papers they read, with their dolls 
and playthings, their vacations and outings, with 
their pets and playhouses, with their tools and 
mechanical contrivances —all these and other like 
realities of child life put the teacher on a footing
-P-A-G-E-29
  THE BASIS OF SKILL IN ORAL WORK 19 
of possible appreciation and sympathy with children. 
These are the materials and facts which a good 
teacher knows how to work up in oral recitations. 
Of course the kindly, sympathetic social mood 
which is not fretted by others’ frailties and perversi- 
ties, but, like Irving or Addison, exhibits a liberal 
charity or humorous affection for all things human, is 
a fortunate possession or acquisition for the teacher. 
2. It may be said also, without fear of violent con- 
tradiction, that a teacher needs to be a master of the 
story he is about to tell. It may be well to spread 
out to view the important things necessary to such a 
mastery. The reading over of the story till its facts 
and episodes have become familiar and can be repro- 
duced in easy narrative is at least a minimum re- 
quirement. Even this moderate demand is much 
more serious than the old text-book routine in history 
or reading, where the teacher, with one eye on the 
book, the other on the class, and his finger at the 
place, managed to get the questions before the class 
in a fixed order. 
Let us look a little beneath the surface of the 
story. What is its central idea, the author’s aim or 
motive in producing it? Nota little effort and reflec- 
tion may be necessary to get at the bottom of this 
question. Some of the most famous stories, like “ Alad- 
din,” “Gulliver’s Travels,” and the “City Musicians,” 
may be so wild and wayward as to elude or blunt the 
point of this question. The story may have a hard
-P-A-G-E-30
  20 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
shell, but the sharp teeth of reflection will get at the 
sweet kernel within, else the story is not worth while. 
In some of the stories, like “ Baucis and Philemon,” 
“The Great Stone Face,” “The Pied Piper of Hame- 
lin,” “‘The Discontented Pine Tree,” and “ Hiawa- 
tha’s Fasting,” the main truth is easily reflected 
from the story and caught up even by the children. 
This need for getting at the heart of the story is 
clearly seen in all the subsequent work. It is the 
exercise of such a critical judgment which qualifies 
the teacher to discriminate between good and poor 
stories. In the treatment of the story the essential 
topics are laid out upon the basis of this controlling 
idea or motive. The leading aims and carefully 
worded questions point toward this central truth. 
The side lights and attendant episodes are arranged 
with reference to it like the scenes in a drama. The 
effort to get at the central truth and the related ideas 
is a sifting-out process, a mode of assimilating and 
mastering the story more thorough-going than the 
mere memorizing of the facts and words for the pur- 
pose of narration. The thought-getting self-activity 
and common-sense logic which are involved in this 
mode of assimilating a story are good for both pupils 
and teacher. 
The mastery of a story needed by an oral teacher 
implies abundance of resource in illustrative device 
and explanation. When children fail to grasp an 
idea, it is necessary to fall back 1pon some familiar
-P-A-G-E-31
  THE BASIS OF SKILL IN ORAL WORK 21 
object or experience not mentioned in the book, 
Emergencies arise which tax the teacher’s ingenuity 
to the utmost. Even the children will raise queries 
that baffle his wit. In preparing a story for the 
classroom it is necessary to see it from many sides, 
to foresee these problems and difficulties. Often- 
times the collateral knowledge derived from history 
or geography or from similar episodes in other stories 
will suggest the solution. 
It is a favorite maxim of college teachers and of 
those who deal mostly with adults or older pupils, 
that if a person knows a thing he can teach it. 
Leaving out of account the numerous cases of those 
who are well posted in their subjects, but cannot 
teach, it is well to note the scope, variety, and thor- 
oughness of knowledge necessary to a good teacher 
to handle it skilfully with younger children. Besides 
the thorough knowledge of the subject which scholars 
have demanded, it requires an equally clear knowl- 
edge of the mental resources of children, the lan- 
guage which they can understand, the things which 
attract their interest and attention, and the ways of 
holding the attention of a group of children of differ- 
ent capacities, temper, and disposition. Any dog- 
matic professor who thinks he can teach the story of 
“ Cinderella” or Andersen’s “‘ Five Peas in the Pod,” 
because he has a full knowledge of the facts of the 
story, should make trial of his skill upon a class of 
twenty children in the first grade. We suggest, how-  
-P-A-G-E-32
  
  22 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING | 
ever, that he do it quietly, without inviting in his 
friends to witness his triumph. 
No, the mastery of the subject needed for an effec- 
tive handling of it in oral work is different and is 
greater than they have yet dreamed of who think 
that mere objective knowledge is all that is needed 
by ateacher. The application of knowledge to life 
is generally difficult, more taxing by far than the 
mere acquisition of facts and principles. But the 
use of one’s knowledge in the work of instructing 
young children, in getting them to acquire and assim- 
ilate it, is perhaps the most difficult of all forms of 
the application of knowledge. It is difficult because 
it is so complex. To think clearly and accurately on 
some topic for one’s single self is not easy, but 
to get twenty children of varying capacities and 
weaknesses, with their stumbling, acquisitive, flaring 
minds, to keep step along one clear line of thought 
is a piece of daring enterprise. 
The mastery of the story, therefore, for successful 
oral work, must be detailed, comprehensive, many- 
sided, and adapted to the fluttering thoughts of child- 
hood. 
3. The chief instrument through which the teacher 
communicates the story is oral speech, and this he 
needs to wield with discriminating skill and power. 
Preachers and lecturers, when called upon to talk to 
children, nearly always talk over their heads, using 
language not appropriate and comprehensible to
-P-A-G-E-33
  THE BASIS OF SKILL IN ORAL WORK 23 
children. Those accustomed to deal with little folks 
are quickly sensitive to this amateur awkwardness. 
Young teachers just out of the higher schools make 
the same blunder. They are also inclined to think 
that fluency and verbosity are a.sign of power. But 
such false tinsel makes no impression upon children 
except confusion of thought. Children require 
simple, direct words, clearly defined in thought and 
grounded upon common experience and conviction. 
Facts and realities should stand behind the words of 
a teacher. What he seeks to marshal before chil- 
dren is people and things. Words should serve as 
photographs of objects; instantaneous views of expe- 
riences. In some social and diplomatic circles words 
are said to conceal thought, but this kind of verbal 
diplomacy has no place in schools. 
It is an interesting question how far the language 
and style of the authors should be preserved by the 
narrator. It would be an error to forbid the exact 
use of the author’s words and an equal error to 
require it. It seems reasonable to say that the 
teacher should become absorbed in the author’s style 
and mode of presenting the story. This will lead to 
a close approximation to the author’s words, without 
any slavish imitation. In the midst of oral presenta- 
tion and discussion it would be impossible to hold 
strictly to the original. The teacher’s own language 
and conception of the story will press in to simplify 
and clarify the meaning. No one holds strictly to a
-P-A-G-E-34
24 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
literary style in telling a story. Conversational ideas 
and original momentary impulses of thought demand 
their own forms of utterance. And yet it is well to 
appropriate the style and expression of the writer so 
as to accustom the children to the best forms. A 
few very apt and forcible sentences will be found in 
any good author which the teacher will: naturally 
employ. 
But the teacher must have freedom. When he 
has once thoroughly appropriated the story he must 
give vent to his own spontaneity and power. Later, 
when the children come to read these stories, they 
will enjoy them in their full literary form. 
4. The power of clear and interesting presentation 
of a story is one of the chief professional acquisitions 
of a good primary teacher. It involves many things 
besides language, including liveliness of manner, 
gesture, facial expression, action, dramatic imperso- 
nation, skill in blackboard illustration, good humor 
and tact in working with children, a strong imagina- 
tion, anda real appreciation for the literature adapted 
to children. 
Perhaps the fundamental need is simplicity and 
clearness of thought and language combined with a 
pleasing and attractive manner. Vague and incom- 
prehensible thoughts and ideas are all out of place. 
The teacher should be strict with himself in this 
matter, and while reading and mastering the story, 
should use compulsion upon himself to arrive at an 
 
-P-A-G-E-35
  THE BASIS OF SKILL IN ORAL WORK 25 
unmistakable clearness of thought. The objects, 
buildings, palaces, woods, caves, animals, persons, 
and places should be sharply imaged by the imagina- 
tion; the feelings and passions of the actors should 
be keenly realized. Often a vague and uncertain 
conception needs to be scanned, the passage reread, 
and the notion framed into clearness. In describing 
the palace of the sleeping beauty, begirt with woods, 
the sentinels standing statuelike at the portal, the 
lords and ladies at their employments, the teacher 
should think out the entrance way, hall, rooms, and 
persons of the palace so clearly that his thought and 
language will not stumble over uncertainties. Trans- 
parent clearness and directness of thought are the 
result of effort and circumspection. They are well 
worth the pains required to gain them. <A teacher 
who thinks clearly will generate clear habits of 
thought in children. 
The power of interesting narrative and description 
is not easily explained. It is a thing not readily 
analyzed into its elements. Perhaps the best way to 
find out what it is may be discovered by reading the 
great story-tellers, such as Macaulay, Irving, Kings- 
ley, De Foe, Hawthorne, Homer, Plutarch, Scott, 
and Dickens. Novelists like George Eliot, Vic- 
tor Hugo, Cooper, Scott, and Dickens, possess 
this secret also, and even some of the historians, 
as Herodotus, Fiske, Green, Parkman, Motley, and 
others. It is not so important that a teacher should
-P-A-G-E-36
26 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
  give a cold analysis of their qualities as that he 
should fall insensibly into the vivid and realistic style 
of the best story-tellers. One who has read Pyle’s 
Robin Hood stories until they are familiar will, to 
a considerable extent, appropriate his fertile and 
happy Old-English style, the sturdy English spirit of 
bold Robin, his playful humor, and his apt utterance 
of homely truths. 
There are certain qualities that stand out prom- 
inently in the good story-tellers. They are simple 
and concrete in their descriptions, they deal very 
little in general, vague statements or abstractions, 
they hold closely to the persons of the story in the 
midst of interesting surroundings, they are profuse 
in the use of distinct figures of speech, appealing to 
the fancy or imagination. They often have a humor- 
ous vein which gives infinite enjoyment and spreads 
a happy charity throughout the world. 
The art of graphic illustration on the blackboard 
is in almost constant demand in oral work. Even 
rude and untechnical sketches by teachers who have 
no acquired skill in artistic drawing are of the great- 
est value in giving a quick and accurate perception 
of places, buildings, persons, and surrounding condi- 
tions of a story or action. The map of Crusoe’s 
island, the drawings to represent his tent, cave, boat, 
country residence, fortifications, dress, utensils, and 
battles are natural and simple modes of realizing 
clearly his labors and adventures. They save much
-P-A-G-E-37
  THE BASIS OF SKILL IN ORAL WORK 27 
verbal description and circumlocution. The teacher 
needs to acquire absolute boldness and freedom in 
using such illustrative devices. The children will, 
of course, catch this spirit, as they are by nature 
inclined to use drawing as a mode of expression. 
A similar freedom in the teacher is necessary in 
the use of bodily action, gesture, and facial expression 
in story-telling. The teacher needs to become nat- 
ural, childlike, and mobile in these things; for chil- 
dren are naturally much given to such demonstrations 
in the expression of their thought. Little girls of 
three and four years in the home, when free from 
self-consciousness, are marvellously and delightfully 
expressive by means of eyes, gestures, hands, and 
arms and whole bodily attitudes. Why should not 
this naive expressiveness be gently fostered in the 
school? Indeed it is, and in many schools the little 
ones are as happy and whole-souled and spontaneous 
in their modes of expression as we have suggested. 
Dramatization, if cultivated, extends a teacher’s 
gamut of expressiveness. Our inability or slowness 
to respond to this suggestion is a sign of a certain nar- 
rowness or cramp in our culture and training. In Nor- 
mal schools where young teachers are trained in the art 
of reading, the dramatic instinct should be strongly 
developed. The power to other one’s self in dra- 
matic action, to assume and impersonate a variety of 
characters, is a real expression and enlargement of 
the personality. It demands sympathy and feeling as  
-P-A-G-E-38
28 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
well as intellectual insight. The study and reading 
of the great dramatists, the seeing of good plays, 
amateur efforts in this direction, the frequent oral 
reading of Shakespeare, Dickens, and other dram- 
atists and novelists will cultivate and enlarge the 
teacher’s power in this worthy and wholesome art. 
The use of good pictures is also an important 
means of adding to the beauty and clearness of 
stories. The pictures of Indian life in “Hiawatha,” the 
illustrated editions of “Robinson Crusoe,” the copies 
of ancient works of art in some editions of the Greek 
myths, Howard Pyle’s illustrated “ Robin Hood,” and 
other books of this character add greatly to the vivid- 
ness of ideas. Such pictures should be handled with 
care, not distributed promiscuously among the chil- 
dren while the lesson is going on. The teacher needs 
to study a picture, and discuss it intelligently with the 
children, asking questions which bring out its repre- 
sentative qualities. 
It is evident the skilful oral presentation of a story 
calls out no small degree of clear knowledge, force 
of language, illustrative device, dramatic instinct, and 
a freedom and versatility of action both mental and 
physical. 
5. Acclear outline of leading points in a story is a 
source of strength to the teacher and the basis later 
of good reproductive work by the children. The 
short stories in the first grade hardly need a formal 
outline, and even in second grade the sequence of 
 
-P-A-G-E-39
  THE BASIS OF SKILL IN ORAL WORK 29 
ideas in a story is often so simple and easy that out- 
lines of leading topics may not be needed. But in 
third and fourth grade it is well in the preliminary 
study and mastery of a story to divide it up into 
clearly marked segments, with a distinctive title for 
each division. It is difficult to get teachers to do this 
kind of close logical work, and still more difficult to 
have them remember it in the midst of oral presenta- 
tion and discussion. If the main points of the story 
as thus outlined are placed upon the blackboard as 
the narrative advances, it keeps in mind a clear sur- 
vey of the whole and serves as the best basis for the 
children’s reproduction of the story. It .compels 
both teacher and pupils to keep to a close logical 
connection of ideas and a sifting out of the story to 
get at the main points. Without these well-con- 
structed outlines the memory of the story is apt to 
fall into uncertainty and confusion, and the children’s 
reproduction becomes fragmentary and disorderly. 
Experience shows that teachers are prone to be loose 
and careless in bringing their stories into such a well- 
ordered series of distinct topics. It is really a sign 
of a thoughtful, logical, and judicious mastery of a 
subject to have thrown it thus into its prominent 
points of narration. Oral work often fails of effec- 
tiveness and thoroughness, because of these careless 
habits of teachers. Such an outline, when put into 
the children’s regular note-books, serves as the best 
basis for later surveys and reviews.
-P-A-G-E-40

  _ 6. The oral narration and presentation of stories 
has a curious way of being turned into development 
lessons, in which the teacher deals in questions and 
problematic situations and the children work out 
many of the facts and incidents of the story by a 
series of guesses and inferences. These are well 
known as development lessons, and they are capable 
of exhibiting the highest forms of excellence in teach- 
ing or the most drivelling waste of time. The subject 
is a hard one to handle, but it needs a clear and 
simple elucidation as much as any problem in the 
teaching profession. Generally speaking it is better 
for young teachers not to launch out recklessly upon 
the full tide of development instruction. It is better 
to learn the handling of the craft on quieter waters. 
Development work needs to be well charted. The 
varying winds and currents, storms and calms, need 
to be studied and experienced before one may become 
a good ship’s master. Let young teachers first 
acquire power in clear, simple, direct narration and 
description, using apt and forcible language and 
holding to a clear-cut line of thought. This is no 
slight task, and when once mastered and fixed in 
habit becomes the foundation of a wider freedom and 
skill in development exercises. The works of the 
great story-tellers furnish excellent models of this 
sort of skill, and teachers may follow closely in the 
lines struck out by Scott or Hawthorne in narrating 
a story.
-P-A-G-E-41
  THE BASIS OF SKILL IN ORAL WORK 31 
A book story cannot do otherwise than simply 
narrate; it cannot develop, set problems and ques- 
tions and have children to find solutions and answers. 
It must tell the facts and answer the questions. But 
in oral narration there is room not only for all the 
skill of the story-writer, but also the added force of 
voice, personality, lively manner, gesture, action, and 
close adaptation to the immediate needs of children 
and subject. This is enough to command the undi- 
vided effort of the young teacher at first, without 
entering the stormy waters and shifting currents of 
pure development work. 
Yet the spirited teacher will not go far in narrating 
a story without a tendency to ask questions to inten- 
sify the children’s thought, or to quicken the discus- 
sion of interesting points. Even if the teachers or 
parents are but reading a good story from a book, 
it is most natural, at times, to ask questions about 
the meaning of certain new words, or geographical 
locations, or probabilities in the working out of the 
story. These are the simple beginnings of develop- 
ment work, and produce greater thoughtfulness, 
keener perceptions of the facts, and a better absorp- 
tion of the story into a child’s previous knowledge. 
A sharp limitation of development work is also 
found in the circumstance that a large share of the 
' facts in a story cannot by any sort of ingenuity be 
developed. They form the necessary basis for later 
development questions. Even many of the facts 
 
-P-A-G-E-42
  32 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
which might be developed by a skilful teacher are 
better told directly, because of the difficulty and 
time-devouring nature of the process. There may 
be.a few central problems in every story, which, after 
the necessary facts and conditions have been plainly 
told, can be thoroughly sifted out by questions, an- 
swers, and discussions. But to work out all the little 
details of a story by question and surmise, to get the 
crude, unbaked opinions of all the members of a class 
upon every episode and fact in a story, is a pitiful 
caricature of good instruction. 
The purpose of good development work is to get 
children to go deeper into the meaning of a story, to 
realize its situations more keenly, and to acquire 
habits of thoughtfulness, self-reliant judgment, and 
inventiveness in solving difficulties. These results, 
and they are among the chiefest set for the educator, 
cannot be accomplished by mere narration and de- 
scription. Their superior excellence and worth are 
the prize of that superior skill which first-class devel- 
opment work demands. 
With these preliminary remarks, criticisms, and 
limitations in mind, we may inquire what are the es- 
sentials of good development work in oral lessons. 
(1) Determine what parts of a story are capable of 
development ; what facts must be clearly present to 
the mind before questions can be put and inferences 
derived. In a problem in arithmetic we first state 
the known facts, the conditions upon which a solu-
-P-A-G-E-43
  THE BASIS OF SKILL IN ORAL WORK 33 
tion can be based, and then put a question whose 
answer is to be gained by a proper conjunction and 
inference from these facts. The same thing is true 
in reasoning upon the facts in a story. 
(2) In placing a topic before children it is always 
advisable to touch up the knowledge already pos- 
sessed by the children, or any parts of their previous 
experience which have strong interpretative ideas for 
the new lesson. At this point apt questions which 
probe quickly into their previous knowledge and 
experience are at a premium. The teacher needs 
to have considered beforehand in what particulars 
the children’s home surroundings and peculiar cir- 
cumstances may furnish the desired knowledge. The 
form of the questions may also receive close atten- 
tion. For these words must provoke definite thought. 
They should have hooks on them which quickly drag 
experience into light. 
(3) In order to give direction to the children’s 
thoughts on the story’s line of progress, zxteresting 
aims should be set up. These aims, without antici- 
pating precise results, must guide the children 
towards the desired ends and turning-points in the 
story. The mind should be kept in suspense as to 
the outcome, and the thoughts should centre and 
play about these clearly projected aims. Such aims, 
floating constantly in the van, are the objective 
points, towards which the energy of thought is 
directed. Every good story-teller keeps such aims 
D 
 
-P-A-G-E-44
    34 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
expressly or tacitly in view. Novelists and drama 
tists hinge the interest of readers or spectators 
upon this curiosity which is kept acutely sensitive 
about results. Such an aim should be simple and 
concrete, not vague or abstract, or general. It may 
be put in the form of a question or statement or 
suggestion. It will be a good share of the teacher’s 
work in the preparation of the lesson to pick out and 
word these aims which centre upon the leading 
topics of the lesson. For it is not enough to have 
an aim at the beginning of a story, every chapter 
or separate part of the story should have its aim. 
For aims are what stimulate effort and keep up an 
attentive interest. 
(4) Self-activity and thoughtfulness in working 
out problems find their best opportunity in develop- 
ment work. The book, in narrating a story, cannot 
set problems, or, if it does, it forthwith assumes the 
task of solving them. But in the oral development 
of a story the essential facts and conditions may be 
clearly presented and the solution of the difficulties, 
as in arithmetic, left largely to the ingenuity and 
reasoning power of the children. In the story of 
Hiawatha’s boat-building the problem may be set to 
the children as to what materials he will use in the 
construction of the canoe, how the parts were put 
together, and how he might decorate it. Not that 
the children will give the whole solution, but they 
can contribute much to it. In “Robinson Crusoe”
-P-A-G-E-45
  THE BASIS OF SKILL IN ORAL WORK 35 
many such problems arise. How shall he conceal 
his cave and house from possible enemies? Where 
can he store his powder to keep it from the lightning 
and from dampness? In fact, nearly every step in 
Crusoe’s interesting career is such a problem or diffi- 
culty to battle with. In Kingsley’s “Greek Heroes” 
and other renderings of the Greek myths, the heroes 
are young men who have shrewdness, courage, and 
strength to overcome difficulties. To put these diffi- 
culties before children in such a way that they by 
-their own thinking may anticipate, in part at least, 
the proper solutions, is one of the chief merits of 
development work. The story of Ulysses is a series 
of shrewd contrivances to master difficulties or to 
avoid misfortunes, so that his name has become a 
synonym for shrewdness. The story itself, therefore, 
furnishes prime opportunities to develop resourceful- 
ness. How shall he escape from the enraged Poly- 
phemos in the cave? His invention of the wooden 
horse before Troy; his escape from the sirens; his 
battle with the suitors and others. The story of 
Aladdin has such interesting inventions, and even 
the fairy tales and fables have many turns of shrewd- 
ness and device where the children’s wits may 
be stimulated. The turning-points and centres of 
interest in all such stories are the true wrestling- 
grounds of thought. To put them point-blank before 
children in continuous narrative, without question 
or discussion, is not the way to produce thoughtful-  
-P-A-G-E-46
36 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
  ness and inventive power. Merely reading or telling 
stories to children without comment is entertaining, 
but not educative in the better sense. Children will 
have plenty of chances at home and in the school 
library to read and hear stories, but it is the business 
of the school to teach them how to think as they 
read, to produce a habit of foreseeing, reviewing, 
comparing, and judging. The serious defect of 
much of young people’s reading, from ten years on, 
is its superficial, transitory character. It lacks depth, 
strength, and permanency. It is not many stories 
that can be orally treated in this thorough-going way, 
but enough to give the right idea, and to cultivate 
habit and taste for more thoughtful study. 
For skilled teachers, therefore, development lessons, 
within certain limits, constitute a most important 
phase of oral instruction. It has been sometimes 
assumed that a child acquires greater self-reliance 
and a stronger exercise in self-activity by learning 
his lesson by himself from a book. This is probably 
true in much of the arithmetic, where he works out 
the solution of problems unaided ; but in history and 
literature the book work is chiefly memory work, and 
oftentimes becomes of such parrot-like character 
as to be almost destitute of higher educative quali- 
ties. It is advisable, therefore, to strengthen the 
educative value of story work by giving it, through 
oral instruction, this problem-solving character, this 
thought-stimulating, self-reliant attitude of mind.
-P-A-G-E-47
  THE BASIS OF SKILL IN ORAL WORK 37 
7. When the teacher has shown his best skill in 
presenting and discussing a section of a story, it then 
devolves upon the children to show their knowledge 
and grasp of the subject by reproducing it. The 
task of getting this well done requires, perhaps, as 
much skill and force of character as all previous 
work of oral instruction. Obstacles are met with at 
once. It is dull work to go back over the same thing 
again, and the children soon get tired of it. They 
want something new and more exciting, and press 
for the rest of the story. Many children are at first 
deficient in power of attention and in language, so 
that their efforts at reproduction are clumsy and poor. 
The interest is weak, the attention of the children 
scattering, and the class is apt to go to pieces under 
the strain of such dull work. This is an emergency 
where a teacher needs both skill and force of char- 
acter. (What a comfort it is to a writer to have such 
a platitude as this to fall back upon, when he gets 
a teacher into a place where nothing but his own 
devices can save him.) 
There are, however, some hopeful considerations 
which may encourage a teacher whose feet are not 
already too deep in the bog of discouragement. 
Children enjoy the retelling of good stories with 
which they are familiar. They will do it at home, 
even if they are not very proficient at it in school. 
In every class there are some talkative children who 
are always willing to make an effort. Again, it is
-P-A-G-E-48
  38 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
not always difficult to interest boys and girls in doing 
a thing that requires skill and power, such as memory, 
attentiveness, and mastery of correct language. The 
force of the teacher’s influence and authority is worth 
something in setting up high standards of proficiency. 
Indeed, children respect a teacher who makes rigor- 
ous demands upon them. The retelling of stories 
is, after all, no harder nor duller than the reciting of 
a lesson learned out of a book. 
On the other hand, the whole effectiveness of oral 
work depends upon the success of these oral repro- 
ductions. If children know that the teacher is in 
earnest they will be more attentive, so as to be 
able to fulfil the requirement. Such a reproduction 
reveals at once a child’s correct or incorrect grasp 
of the subject, and in either case the teacher knows 
what to do next. Errors and misconceptions can be 
corrected and such explanations or additional facts 
given as will clarify the subject. 
In such reproductions it is praiseworthy to help 
the children as little as possible, to throw them back 
upon their own power as much as possible. If the 
teacher constantly relieves them with suggestive ques- 
tions, they lean more and more upon her direction 
and lose all self-reliant power of continuous narra- 
tive. No, let the teacher keep a prudent silence, let 
her seal her lips, if necessary, in order to teach boys 
and girls to stand on their own power of thought. 
Under this sort of discipline, kindly but rigorous,
-P-A-G-E-49
eee 
= THE BASIS OF SKILL IN ORAL WORK 39 
children will gradually acquire confidence in manner, 
variety and choice of language, in short, the ability to 
grasp clearly, hold firmly, and express accurately the 
ideas which are presented to them. 
The whole purpose of this sort of instruction is not 
so much to see how skilfully a teacher can present a 
| lesson (though that is a fine art) as to determine how 
well a boy or girl can master or express knowledge, 
can learn to think and speak for himself. 
8. Some teachers despair of treating stories orally 
in large classes of primary children. The task of 
holding together such wriggling varieties of mental 
force and mental inertia is great. Some children are 
quick and excitable, others are unresponsive and dull. 
Some are timid and sensitive, others bold and demon- 
strative. Some are talkative and irrepressible, others 
silent or listless. 
It is interesting to consider the function and value 
of a good child’s story to fit in to such varying needs 
and personalities. If the purpose of the primary 
school is simply to keep children busy at some kind 
of orderly work, there are other tamer employments 
than stories. But if the idea is to put children’s 
minds and bodies into healthy, vigorous action, it 
would be difficult to find a more suitable instrument 
than a fitting story. 
But a good primary teacher knows better than to 
establish brusque and fixed standards of uniform 
success for all children. It will take much time and
-P-A-G-E-50
40 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
  patience to get anything like good oral responses 
from some children. Like budding flowers some 
unfold their leaves and petals much quicker at the 
touch of sunshine than others. But the sun does not 
stop shining because all do not come out at once. 
The crudest efforts of little children must be received 
with kindness and encouragement, The power of 
reproducing thought and language is very slowly 
acquired by many children. They are timidly self- 
conscious, distrustful of their own powers, and have 
not learned to throw themselves with confidence upon 
the good-will of their teachers. It may take months 
with some children to overcome these obstacles, and 
to bring them to a confident use of their powers, but 
it is the highest delight of a teacher to reach this 
result. 
Some children, on the other hand, are so talkative 
and impulsive that they will monopolize the time of 
the class to no good purpose. Their enthusiasm 
requires tempering and their soberer thought strength- 
ening. 
Another difficulty lies in the necessary effort to get 
correct English, to gradually mould the language of 
children into correct forms. The perverse habits of 
children, the influence of home and playground, the 
inveterate preference for slang and crude, crass 
expressions, and their sensitive pride against unusual 
refinements of speech, make the cultivation of good 
English an uphill task. But roads must be laid out
-P-A-G-E-51
THE BASIS OF SKILL IN ORAL WORK 41 
through this wilderness of hills and valleys, stumps 
and brush. And these roads must be gradually 
worked down into smooth highways of travel. It is 
pioneer toil, requiring the steady use of axe and 
mattock and spade. 
There is no kind of school training where good Eng- 
lish can be cultivated to better advantage, where the 
power of correct, independent, well-articulated speech 
“Can be so well strengthened as in oral story. It is 
in the close contact of this work that the teacher is 
dealing directly with the original stock of experiences, 
ideas, and words of every child, and with these as 
instruments of acquisition, helping him to get a 
spirited introduction to the world of ideas in books 
and literature. 
It is here that we can get a glimpse of that vast 
work which the elementary schools of the country 
are doing in the way of Americanizing the children 
of various nationalities and in giving them not only 
a common language, but a common body of ideas 
rooted in the earliest experiences of childhood and 
already laying hold of many of the richest treasures 
of American history and of the world’s literature. 
g. As children advance from the first year into the 
second and third years the character of the oral story- 
telling gradually changes. Children should acquire 
more power of attention, greater command of lan- 
guage and ability to grasp and hold at one telling 
a larger section of a story. The stories themselves
-P-A-G-E-52
42 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
become more complex, the questions and problems 
set by the teacher more difficult. The necessity for 
sharp, logical outlines of leading topics increases as 
one advances in the grades. Older children can 
be held more rigidly to common standards of excel- 
lence in thought and language. In this, however, 
the teacher should always remember that children 
differ greatly in their natural powers of expression, 
and that a forcing process will not be so successful 
as a stimulating and encouraging attitude in the 
teacher. 
10. The good oral treatment of most stories leads 
the children to much activity in material construc- 
tions. Where the minds of children are brought to 
a healthy activity their bodies and physical energies 
are pretty sure to be called into play to work out the 
suggested lines of thought. “Robinson Crusoe” in- 
variably leads the children to a multitude of building 
and making enterprises, such as moulding vessels in 
clay, constructing the barricade around his tent and 
cave, the making of chairs and tables, etc. 
We have already noticed the readiness of children 
to make blackboard or other drawings of interesting 
objects in a story, or to cut them out with scissors 
from paper. This effort to experience the realities 
of life more directly by making objects of common 
utility and necessity is a characteristic and powerful 
tendency of childhood. It is commonly seen in 
children about the house, when, for example, they 
   
-P-A-G-E-53
THE BASIS OF SKILL IN ORAL WORK 43 
must have wagons, wheelbarrows, tools, or a set of 
garden implements with which to imitate the employ- 
ments of their elders. Parkman and others often 
speak of the constant practice of little Indian boys 
with bow and arrows. 
Our purpose here is not to discuss this matter at 
length, but simply to notice its prominent place in 
connection with the oral lesson in story. The intense 
interest awakened in stories leads quickly to these 
efforts at construction. What shall the teacher do 
with this powerful tendency of children to carry over 
these ideas into the field of practical constructive 
labor? To the thinker this tendency is perhaps 
the surest proof of the value of the story. It does 
not stop with words nor ideas. It pushes far into the 
region of voluntary, physical, and mental labor and 
application of knowledge. 
The teacher who will make good use of this enter- 
prising constructive desire of children must know defi- 
nitely about tools, boards, shops, various industries, 
and technical trades, the special materials, inventions, 
and devices of artisans in the common occupations, 
such as farming, gardening, blacksmithing, the car- 
penter shop, the baker, the quarry, the brick kiln, etc. 
It will not be strange if many teachers recoil, at 
first glance, from this leap into industrial life. It 
suggests that the schoolhouse must become a big 
machine shop, agricultural station, etc. The trouble 
is, of course, that teachers do not feel themselves  
-P-A-G-E-54
  44 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
qualified in these things. They know almost as 
little as the children about such matters, and have 
much less inclination to know more. 
But our modern education is taking a decided turn 
in this direction, and with good reason. The close 
acquaintance of our teachers with the common occu- 
pations of life, with their materials, tools, machines, 
constructions, and skill would supply them with a rich 
collection of practical, concrete, illustrative knowl- 
edge of the greatest use in instructing children. It 
is impossible to mention anything which would be 
of more service to them in the details of instruction. 
The advantages to the children of such teaching, re- 
enforced by this concrete detail of common life, are 
so numerous and important as to deserve a special 
effort. The benefit to teachers would quickly more 
than recompense them for the labor involved. By 
occasional visits of observation in shops, fields, stores, 
and factories, by assisting children in their construc- 
tive efforts, the teacher will acquire knowledge, 
strength, and confidence for such work. The unfa- 
miliarity of teachers with these everyday industrial 
matters, and their feeling of helplessness as regards 
things not in the usual routine of school, are the real 
hindrances to be overcome. 
There are other subjects in the school course, like 
home geography and the early lessons in nature 
study, which deal more directly than stories with 
these practical forms of industrial life and construc-

tive activity. They will also demand and cultivate an 
increasing knowledge of this practical phase of life 
and education. The lessons in oral story-telling 
stand thus closely linked with progressive experi- 
mental knowledge in other studies. 
A brief retrospect and summary of the require- 
ments necessary as a basis of good oral treatment of 
stories will impress us with the skill and resourceful- 
ness needed by the teacher.

These things include a wide range of clear knowl- 
edge and confident skill and resource. Teachers 
need first of all to cultivate resourcefulness in the use 
of their own knowledge and experience, and to add to 
both of these as rapidly as circumstances permit. 
The mere reading of stories to children by the 
teacher, at odd times, on Friday afternoons or on 
special occasions, is also of much value as a means of 
interesting children in a wide range of good books. 
It is a source of entertainment and culture, which, 
when judiciously and skilfully employed, adds much 
to the educative power of the school.

   CHAPTER III 
  First GRADE STORIES 
FAIRY TALES 
Youne children, as we all know, are delighted with 
stories, and in the first grade they are still in this 
story-loving period. A good story is the best medium 
through which to convey ideas and also to approach 
the difficulties of learning to read. Such a story, 
Wilmann says, is a pedagogical treasure. By many 
thinkers and primary teachers the fairy stories have 
been adopted as best suited to the wants of the little 
folk just emerging from the home. A series of fairy 
tales was selected by Ziller, one of the leading Her- 
bartians, as a centre for the school work of the first 
year. These stories have long held a large place in 
the home culture of children, especially of the more 
cultivated class. Now it is claimed that what is good 
for the few whose parents may be cultured and sym- 
pathetic, may be good enough for the children of the 
common people and of the poor. Moreover, stories 
that have made the fireside more joyous and blessed 
may perchance bring vivacity and happiness into 
schoolrooms. The home and the school are coming 
closer together. It is even said that well-trained, 
47 
 
-P-A-G-E-58
48 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
sympathetic primary teachers may better tell and 
impress these stories than overworked mothers and 
busy fathers. If these literary treasures are left for 
the homes to discover and use, the majority of chil- 
dren will know little or nothing of them. Many 
schools in this country have been using them in the 
first grade in recent years with a pleasing effect. 
But what virtue lies concealed in these fairy myths 
for the children of our practical and sensible age? 
Why should we draw from fountains whose sources 
are back in the prehistoric and even barbarous past ? 
To many people it appears as a curious anachronism 
to nourish little children in the first decade of this 
new century upon food that was prepared in the 
tents of wandering tribes in early European history. 
What are the merits of these stories for children just 
entering upon scholastic pursuits? They are known 
to be generally attractive to children of this age, but 
many sober-minded people distrust them. Are they 
really meat and drink for the little ones? And not 
only so, but the choicest meat and drink, the best 
food upon which to nourish their unfolding minds ? 
(Fairy tales are charged with misleading children 
by falsifying the truth of things. And, indeed, they 
pay little heed to certain natural laws that practical 
people of good sense always respect. A child, how- 
ever, is not so humdrum practical as these serious 
truth-lovers. <A little girl talks to her doll as if it 
had real ears. She and her little brother make tea-

FIRST GRADE STORIES 49 
cups and saucers out of acorns with no apparent 
compunctions of conscience. They follow Cinderella 
to the ball in a pumpkin chariot, transformed by 
magic wand, with even greater interest than we read 
of a presidential ball. A child may turn the com- 
mon laws of physical nature inside out and not be a 
whit the worse for it. Its imagination can people 
a pea-pod with little heroes aching for a chance in 
the big world, or it can put tender personality into 
the trunk and branches of the little pine tree in the 
forest. There are no space limits that a child’s fancy 
will not spring over in a twinkling. It can ride from 
star to star on a broomstick, or glide over peaceful 
waters in a fairy boat drawn by graceful swans. 
Without suggestion from mother or teacher, children 
put life and personality into their playthings. Their 
spontaneous delights are in this playful exercise of 
the fancy, in masquerading under the guise of a 
soldier, bear, horse, or bird. The fairy tale is the 
poetry of children’s inner impulse and feeling; their 
sparkling eyes and absorbed interest show how fitting 
is the contact between these childlike creations of the 
poet and their own budding thoughts. 
In discussing the qualities requisite in a fairy story 
to make it a pedagogical treasure, Wilmann says :! 
“When it is laid down as a first and indispensable 
requirement that a story be genuinely childlike, the 
demand sounds less rigorous than it really is. It is 
1 Wilmann, Paedagogische Vortrage. 
 
-P-A-G-E-60
50 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
  easier to feel than to describe the qualities which lend 
to a story the true childlike spirit. It is not sim- 
plicity alone. A simple story that can be understood 
by a child is not on that account childlike. The 
simplicity must be the ingenuousness of the child. 
Close to this lies the abyss of silliness into which 
so many children’s stories tumble. A simple story 
may be manufactured, but the quality of true sim- 
plicity will not be breathed into it unless one can draw 
from the deeper springs of poetic invention. It is 
not enough that the externals of the story, such 
as situation and action, have this character, but the 
sensibilities and motives of the actors must be in- 
genuous and childlike; they should reflect the child’s 
own feeling, wish, and effort. But it is not neces- 
sary on this account that the persons of the story be 
children. Indeed the king, prince, and princess, if 
they only speak and act like children, are much 
nearer the child’s comprehension than any of the 
children paraded in a manufactured story, designed 
for the ‘industrious youth.’ For just as real poetry 
so the real child’s story lies beyond reality in the 
field of fancy. With all its plainness of thought and 
action, the genuine child’s story knows how to take 
hold of the child’s fancy and set its wings in motion. 
And what a meaning has fancy for the soul of the 
child as compared with that of the adult. For us 
the activity of fancy only sketches arabesques, as 
it were, around the sharply defined pictures of reality.
-P-A-G-E-61
  FIRST GRADE STORIES 51 
The child thinks and lives in such arabesques, and 
it is.only gradually that increasing experience writes 
among these arabesques the firmer outlines of things. 
The child’s thoughts float about playfully and un- 
steadily, but the fairy tale is even lighter winged 
than they. It overtakes these fleeting summer birds 
and wafts them together without brushing the dust 
from their wings. 
“ But fostering the activity of fancy in children is 
a means, not an end. It is necessary tu enter the 
field of fancy because the way to the child’s heart 
leads through the fancy. The effect upon the heart 
of the child is the second mark and proof of the genu- 
ine child’s story. We are not advocates of the so- 
called moral stories which are so short-winded as to 
stop frequently and rest upon some moral common- 
place. Platitudes and moral maxims are not de- 
signed to develop a moral taste in the minds of 
young children, for they appeal to the understand- 
ing and will of the pupil and presuppose what must 
be first built up and established. True moral train- 
ing is rather calculated to awaken in the child judg- 
ments of right and wrong, of good and evil (on 
simple illustrative examples). Not the impression 
left by a moralizing discourse is the germ of a love 
of the good and right, but rather the child’s judg- 
ment springing from its own conviction. ‘That was 
good.’ ‘What a mean thing!’ 
“Those narratives have a moral force which intro- 
 
-P-A-G-E-62
|e ak a A 2 a a 
52 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
duce persons and acts that are simple and trans- 
parent enough to let the moral light shine through, ' 
that possess sufficient life to lend warmth and vigor 
to moral judgments. No attempt to cover up or 
pass over what is bad, nor to paint it in extravagant | 
colors. For the bad develops the judgment no less | 
than the good. It remains only to have-a care that | 
a child’s interest inclines toward the good, the just, 
and the right.” 
Wilmann summarizes the essentials of a good story, 
and then discusses the fairy tales as follows :— 
“There are then five requirements to be made of 
a real child’s story: Let it be truly childlike, that is, 
both simple and full of fancy; let it form morals 
in the sense that it introduces persons and matters 
which, while simple and lively, call out a moral judg- 
ment of approval or disapproval; let it be instructive 
and lead to thoughtful discussions of society and 
nature ; let it be of permanent value, inviting per- 
petually to a reperusal; let it be a connected whole, 
so as to work a deeper influence and become the 
source of a many-sided interest. 
“The child’s story which, on the basis of the afore- 
named principles, can be made the starting-point for 
all others, is Grimm’s fairy tale of folk lore. We are 
now called upon to show that the folk-lore fairy tale 
answers to the foregoing requirements, and in this 
we shall see many a ray of light cast back upon 
these requirements themselves.  
-P-A-G-E-63
FIRST GRADE STORIES 53 
“Is the German fairy tale childlike? full of sim 
plicity as well as of fancy? A deeply poetic saying 
of Jacob Grimm may teach us the answer. ‘There 
runs through these poetic fairy tales the same deep 
vein of purity by reason of which children seem to 
us so wonderful and blessed. They have, as it were, 
the same pale-blue, clear, and lustrous eyes which 
can grow no more although the other members are 
still delicate and weak and unserviceable to the uses 
of earth.’ Klaiber quotes this passage in his ‘Das 
Marchen und die Kindliche Phantasie, and says 
with truth and beauty, ‘Yes ; when we look into the 
trusting eyes of a child, in which none of the world’s 
deceit is to be read as yet, when we see how these 
eyes brighten and gleam at a beautiful fairy tale, as 
if they were looking out into a great, wide, beautiful 
wonder-world, then we feel something of the deep 
connection of the fairy story with the childish soul.’ 
We will bring forward one more passage from a little 
treatise, showing depth and warmth of feeling, which 
stealthily takes away from the doubters their scruples 
about the justification of the fairy tale. ‘It is strange 
how well the fairy tale and the child’s soul mutually 
understand each other. It is as if they had been 
together from the very beginning and had grown up 
together. As a rule the child only deals with that 
part of real life which concerns itself and children of 
its age. Whatever lies beyond this is distant, strange, 
unintelligible. Under the leading of the fairy tale, 
 
-P-A-G-E-64
    54 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
however, it permits itself to be borne over hill and 
valley, over land and sea, through sun and moon 
and stars, even to the end of the world, and every- 
thing is so near, so familiar, so close to its reach, as 
if they had been everywhere before, just as if obscure 
pictures within had all at once become wonderfully 
distinct. And the fairies all, and the king’s sons, 
and the other distinguished personages, whom it 
learns to know through the fairy tale, —they are as 
natural and intelligible as if the child had moved its 
life long in the highest circles, and had had princes 
and princesses for its daily playmates. In a word, 
the world of the fairy tale is the child’s world, for 
it is the world of fancy.’ 
“For this reason children live and move in fairy- 
land, whether the story be told by the mother or by 
the teacher in the primary school. What attention 
as the story proceeds! What anxiousness when any 
danger threatens the hero, be he king’s son or a 
wheat-straw! What grief, even to tears, when a wrong 
is practised upon some innocent creature! And far 
from it that the joy in the fairy tale decrease when 
it is told or discussed over again. Then comes the 
pleasure of representation — bringing the story upon 
the stage. Though a child has but to represent a 
flower in the meadow, the little face is transfigured 
with the highest joy. 
“But the childish joy of fairy tales passes away ; 
not so the inner experiences which it has brought
-P-A-G-E-65
  FIRST GRADE STORIES 55 
with it. I am not affirming too much when I say 
that he who, as a child, has never listened with joy 
to the murmuring and rustling of the fresh fountain 
of fairyland, will have no ear and no understanding 
for many a deep stream of German poetry. It is, 
after all, the modest fountain of fairy song which, 
flowing and uniting with the now noisy, now soft and 
gently flowing, current of folk song, and with the 
deep and earnest stream of tradition, which has 
poured such a refreshing current over German poetry, 
out of which our most excellent Uhland has drawn 
so many a heart-strengthening draught. 
“The spirit of the people finds expression in fairy 
tale as in tradition and song, and if we were only 
working to lift and strengthen the national impulse, 
a moral-educative instruction would have to turn 
again and again to these creations of the people. 
What was asserted as a general truth in regard to 
classical products, that they are a bond between large 
and small, old and young, is true of national stories 
and songs more than of anything else. They are at 
once a bond between the different classes, a national 
treasure, which belongs alike to rich and poor, high 
and low. The common school then has the least right 
of all to put the fairy tale aside, now that few women 
versed in fairy lore, such as those to whom Grimm 
listened, are left. 
“But does the fairy tale come of noble blood? 
Does it possess what we called in the case of classics
-P-A-G-E-66
  56 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
an old title of nobility? If we keep to this figure of 
speech, we shall find that the fairy tale is not only 
noble, but a very royal child among stories. It has 
ruled from olden times, far and wide, over many a 
land. Hundreds of years gone, Grimm’s fairy stories 
lived in the people’s heart, and not in Germany alone. 
If our little ones listen intently to Aschenputtel, 
French children delighted in Cindrillon, the Italian 
in Cenerentola, the Polish in Kopcinszic. The fact 
that medizval story-books contain Grimm’s tales is 
not remarkable, when we reflect that traits and char- 
acteristics of the fairy tale reach back beyond the 
Christian period; that Frau Holle is Hulda, or Frigg, 
the heathen goddess; that ‘Wishing-cap,’ ‘Little 
Lame-leg,’ and ‘Table, Cover Thyself,’ etc., are made 
up out of the attributes of German gods. Finally, 
such things as ‘The Sleeping Beauty,’ which is the 
earth in winter sleep, that the prince of summer 
wakes with kisses in springtime, point back to the 
period of primitive Indo-German myth. 
“But in addition to the requirement of classical 
nobility, has the fairy story also the moral tone which 
we required of the genuine child’s story? Does the 
fairy story make for morals? To be sure it intro- 
duces to an ideal realm of simple moral relations. 
The good and bad are sharply separated. The wrong 
holds for a time its supremacy, but the final victory 
is with the good. And with what vigor the judgment 
of good and evil, of right and wrong, is produced.
-P-A-G-E-67
  FIRST GRADE STORIES 57 
We meet touching pictures, especially of good-will, 
of faithfulness, characteristic and full of life. Think 
only of the typical interchange of words between 
Lenchen and Fundevogel. Said Lenchen, ‘Leave 
me not and I will never leave thee.’ Said Funde- 
vogel, ‘Now and nevermore.’ We are reminded of 
the Bible words of the faithful Ruth, ‘Whither thou 
goest I will go; where thou lodgest I will lodge; 
where thou diest I will die and there will I be 
buried.’ 
“Important for the life of children is the rigor with 
which the fairy tale punishes disobedience and false- 
hood, Think of the suggestive legendary story of 
the child which was visited again and again with mis- 
fortune because of its obstinacy, till its final confession 
of guilt brings full pardon. It is everywhere a Chris- 
tian thread which runs through so many fairy stories. 
It is love for the rejected, oppressed, and abandoned. 
Whatever is loaded with burdens and troubles receives 
the palm, and the first becomes the last. 
“The fairy story fulfils the first three require- 
ments for a true child’s story. It is childlike, of 
lasting value, and fosters moral ideas. As to unity 
it will suffice for children of six years (for this is, in 
our opinion, the age at which it exerts its moral 
force) that the stories be told in the same spirit, 
although they do not form one connected narrative. 
If a good selection of fairy tales according to their 
inner connection is made, so that frequent references
-P-A-G-E-68
58 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
and connections can be found, the requirement ot 
unity will be satisfied. 
“The fairy tale seems to satisfy least of all the 
demand that the true child’s story must be instruc- 
tive, and serve as a starting-point for interesting 
practical discussion. The fairy story seems too airy 
and dreamy for this, and it might appear pedantry 
to load it with instruction. But one will not be 
guilty of this mistake if one simply follows up the 
ideas which the story suggests. When the story of 
a chicken, a fox, or a swan is told it is fully in har- 
mony with the childish thought to inquire into the 
habits of these animals. When the king is mentioned 
it is natural to say that we have a king, to ask where 
he lives, etc. Just because the fairy tale sinks deep 
and holds a firm and undivided attention, it is pos- 
sible to direct the suggested thoughts hither or 
thither without losing the pleasure they create. 
If one keeps this aim in mind, instructive material 
is abundant. The fairy tale introduces various em- 
ployments and callings, from the king to the farmer, 
tailor, and shoemaker. Many passages in life, such 
as betrothal, marriage, and burial, are presented. 
Labors in the house, yard, and field, and numerous 
animals, plants, and inanimate things are touched 
upon. For the observation of animals and for the 
relation between them and children, it is fortunate 
that the fairy tale presents them as talking and feel- 
ing. Thereby the interest in real animals is in-
-P-A-G-E-69
FIRST GRADE STORIES 59 
creased and heartlessness banished. How could a 
child put to the torture an animal which is an old 
friend in fairy story ? 
“T need only suggest in this place how the fairy 
story furnishes material for exercises in oral language, 
for the division of words into syllables and letters, 
and how the beginnings of writing, drawing, number, 
and manual exercises may be drawn from the same 
source. 
“From the suggestions just made the following 
conclusions at least may be reasonably drawn. A 
sufficient counterpoise to the fantastical nature of 
the fairy tale can be given in a manner simple and 
childlike, if the objects and relations involved in the 
narratives are brought clearly before the senses and 
discussed so that instruction about common objects 
and home surroundings is begun.” 
In speaking of Shakespeare’s early training in 
literature, Charles Kingsley says: — 
“TI said there was a literary art before Shake- 
speare—an art more simple, more childlike, more 
girlish, as it were, and therefore all the more adapted

comic attempts — these were the roots of his poetic 
tree—they must be the roots of any literary educa- 
tion which can teach us to appreciate him. These 
fed Shakespeare’s youth; why should they not feed 
our children’s? Why indeed? That inborn delight 
of the young in all that is marvellous and fantastic — 
has that a merely evil root? No surely! It is a 
most pure part of their spiritual nature; a part of 
‘the heaven which lies about us in our infancy’; 
angel-wings with which the free child leaps the 
prison-walls of sense and custom, and the drudgery 
of earthly life.” 
Felix Adler ‘says:! “But how shall we handle 
these Marchen and what method shall we employ 
in putting them to account for our special purpose? 
I have a few thoughts on this subject, which I shall 
venture to submit in the form of counsels. 
“My first counsel is: Tell the story ; do not give it 
to the child to read. There is an obvious practical 
reason for this. Children are able to benefit by 
hearing fairy tales before they can read. But that 
is not the only reason. It is the childhood of the 
race, as we have seen, that speaks in the fairy story 
of the child of to-day. It is the voice of an ancient 
far-off past that echoes from the lips of the story- 
teller. The words ‘once upon a time’ open up a 
vague retrospect into the past, and the child gets 
its first indistinct notions of history in this way. The

stories embody the tradition of the childhood of man- 
kind. They have on this account an authority all 
their own, not, indeed, that of literal truth, but one 
derived from their being types of certain feelings 
and longings which belong to childhood as such. 
The child, as it listens to the Mérchen, looks up with 
wide-opened eyes to the face of the person who tells 
the story, and thrills responsive as the touch of the 
earlier life of the race thus falls upon its own. Such an 
effect, of course, cannot be produced by cold type. 
Tradition is a living thing and should use the living 
voice for its vehicle. 
“My second counsel is also of a practical nature, 
and I make bold to say quite essential to the suc- 
cessful use of the stories. Do not take the moral 
plum out of the fairy-tale pudding, but let the child 
enjoy it as a whole. Do not make the story taper 
toward a single point, the moral point. You will 
squeeze all the juice out of it if you try. Do not 
subordinate the purely fanciful and naturalistic ele- 
ments of the story, such as the love of mystery, the 
passion for roving, the sense of fellowship with the 
animal world, in order to fix attention solely on 
the moral element. On the contrary, you will gain 
the best moral effect by proceeding in exactly the 
opposite way. Treat the moral element as an in- 
cident, emphasize it indeed, but incidentally. Pluck 
it as a wayside flower. How often does it happen 
that, having set out on a journey with a distinct 
 
-P-A-G-E-72
  62 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
object in mind, something occurs on the way which 
we had not foreseen, but which in the end leaves the 
deepest impression on the mind. .. . 
“The value of the fairy tales is that they stimu- 
late the imagination; that they reflect the unbroken 
communion of human life with the life universal, as 
in beasts, fishes, trees, flowers, and stars; and that 
incidentally, but all the more powerfully on that ac- 
count, they quicken the moral sentiments. 
“Let us avail ourselves freely of the treasures 
which are thus placed at our disposal. Let us wel- 
come das Mérchen into our primary course of moral 
training, that with its gentle bands, woven of ‘ morn- 
ing mist and morning glory,’ it may help to lead our 
children into bright realms of the ideal.” 
A selection of fairy stories suited to our first grade 
will differ from a similar selection for foreign schools. 
There has been a disposition among American 
teachers for several years to appropriate the best 
of these stories for use in the primary schools. In 
different parts of the country skilful primary teachers 
have been experimenting successfully with these 
materials. There are many schools in which both 
teachers and pupils have taken great delight in them. 
The effort has been made more particularly with first 
grade children, the aim of teachers being to lead cap- 
tive the spontaneous interest of children from their first 
entrance upon school tasks. Some of the stories used 
at the first may seem light and farcical, but experi-

FIRST GRADE STORIES 63 
ments with children are a better test than the precon- 
ceived notions of adults who may have forgotten their 
| early childhood. The story of the “ Four Musicians,” 
' for example, is a favorite with the children. 
At the risk of repetition, and to emphasize some 
points of special importance, we will review briefly 
the method of oral treatment and the use of the 
stories in early primary reading. 
The children have no knowledge of reading or per- 
haps of letters. The story is told with spirit by the 
teacher, no book being used in the class. Question 
and interchange of thought between pupil and teacher 
will become more frequent and suggestive as the 
teacher becomes more skilled and sympathetic in her 
treatment of the story. In the early months of school 
life the aim is to gain the attention and codperation 
of children by furnishing abundant food for thought. 
Children are required or at least encouraged to narrate 
the story or a part of it in the class. They tell it at 
school and probably at home, till they become more 
and more absorbed in it. Even the backward or 
timid child gradually acquires courage and enjoys 
narrating the adventures of the peas in the pod or 
those of the animals in the “ Four Musicians.” 
The teacher should acquire a vivid and picturesque 
style of narrating, persistently weaving into the story, 
by query and suggestion, the previous home experi- 
ences of the children. They are only too ready to 
bring out these treasures at the call of the teacher.  
-P-A-G-E-74
64 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
Often it is necessary to check their enthusiasm. 
There is a need not simply for narrative power, but 
for quick insight and judgment, so as to bring their 
thoughts into close relation to the incidents. No- 
where in all the schools is there such a call for close 
and motherly sympathy. The gentle compulsion of 
kindness is required to inspire the timid ones with 
confidence. For some of them are slow to open their 
delicate thought and sensibility, even to the sunny 
atmosphere of a pleasant school. 
A certain amount of drill in reproduction is neces- 
sary, but fortunately the stories have something that - 
bears repetition with a growing interest. Added to 
this is the desire for perfect mastery, and thus the 
stories become more dear with familiarity. 
Incidentally, there should be emphasis of the in- 
structive information gathered concerning animals 
and plants that are actors in the scenes. The com- 
monest things of the house, field, and garden acquire 
a new and lasting interest. Sometimes the teacher 
makes provision in advance of the story for a deeper 
interest in the plants and animals that are to appear. 
In natural science lessons she may take occasion to 
examine the pea blossom, or the animals of the barn- 
yard, or the squirrel or birds in their cages. When, 
a few days later, the story touches one of these ani- 
mals, there is a quick response from the children. 
This relation between history and natural science 
strengthens both.
-P-A-G-E-75
FIRST GRADE STORIES 65 
Many an opportunity should be given for the pupils 
to express a warm sympathy for gentle acts of kind- 
ness or unselfishness. The happiness that even a 
simple flower may bring to a home is a contagious 
example. Kindly treatment of the old and feeble, 
and sympathy for the innocent and helpless, spring 
into the child’s own thought. The fancy, sympathy, 
and interest awakened by a good fairy tale make it 
a vehicle by which, consciously and unconsciously, 
many advantages are borne home to pupils. 
Among other things, it opens the door to the read- 
ing lesson; that is, to the beginning efforts in master- 
ing and using the symbols of written language. The 
same story which all have learned to tell, they are 
now about to learn to read from the board. One or 
two sentences are taken directly from the lips of the 
pupils as they recall the story, and the work of mas- 
tering symbols is begun at once with zest. First is 
the clear statement of some vivid thought by a child, 
then a quick association of this thought with its writ- 
ten symbols on the board. There is no readier way 
of bringing thought and form into firm connection, 
that is, of learning to read. Keep the child’s fresh 
mental judgment and the written form clearly before 
his mind till the two are wedded. Let the thought 
run back and forth between them till they are one. 
After fixing two or three sentences on the board, 
attention is directed more closely to the single words, 
and a rapid drill upon those in the sentence is fol- 
F
-P-A-G-E-76
  66 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
lowed by a discovery and naming of them in miscel- 
laneous order. Afterward new sentences are formed 
by the teacher out of the same words, written on the 
board, and read by the children. They express dif- 
ferent, and perhaps opposite forms of thought, and 
should exercise the child’s sense and judgment as 
well as his memory of words. An energetic, lively, 
and successful drill of this kind upon sentences drawn 
from stories has been so often witnessed, that its 
excellence is no longer a matter of question. These 
exercises are a form of mental activity in which chil- 
dren delight if the teacher’s manner is vigorous and 
pleasant. 
When the mastery of new word-forms as wholes is 
fairly complete, the analysis may go a step farther. 
Some new word in the lesson may be taken and sepa- 
rated into its phonic elements, as the word A7//, and 
new words formed by dropping a letter and prefixing 
letters or syllables, as 2//, ¢2//, wntil, mill, rill, etc. The 
power to construct new words out of old materials 
should be cultivated all along the process of learning 
to read. 
Still other school activities of children stand in 
close relation to the fairy tales. They are encour- 
aged to draw the objects and incidents in which 
the story abounds. Though rude and uncouth, the 
drawings still often surprise us with their truth and 
suggestiveness. The sketches reveal the content of 
a child’s mind as almost nothing else —his miscon-
-P-A-G-E-77
FIRST GRADE STORIES 67 
ceptions, his vague or clearly defined notions. They 
also furnish his mental and physical activities an 
employment exactly suited to his needs and wishes. 
The power to use good English and to express 
himself clearly and fittingly is cultivated from the 
very first. While this merit is purely incidental, it 
is none the less valuable. The persistence with 
which bad and uncouth words and phrases are 
employed by children in our common school, both in 
oral work and in composition, admonishes us to begin 
early to eradicate these faults. It seems often as if 
intermediate and grammar grades were more faulty 
and wretched in their use of English than primary 
grades. But there can be no doubt that early and 
persistent practice in the best forms of expression, 
especially in connection with interesting and appro- 
priate thought matter, will greatly aid correctness, 
fluency, and confidence in speech. There is also 
a convincing pedagogical reason why children in the 
first primary should be held to the best models of 
spoken language. They enter the school better fur- 
nished with oral speech than with a knowledge of 
any school study. Their home experiences have 
wrought into close association and unity, word and 
thing. So intimate and living is the relation between 
word and thought or object, that a child really does 
not distinguish between them. This is the treasure 
with which he enters school, and it should not be 
wrapped up in a napkin. It should be unrolled at
-P-A-G-E-78
EE 
68 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
once and put to service. Oral speech is the capital 
with which a child enters the business of education; 
let him employ it. 
A retrospect upon the various forms of school activ- 
ity which spring, in practical work, from the use of 
a good fairy story, reveals how many-sided and 
inspiriting are its influences. Starting out with a 
rich content of thought peculiarly germane to child- 
ish interests, it calls for a full employment of the lan- 
guage resources already possessed by the children. 
In the effort to picture out, with pencil or chalk, his 
conceptions of the story, a child exercises his fanciful 
and creative wit, as well as the muscles of arms and 
eyes. A good story always finds its setting in the 
midst of nature or society, and touches up with a 
simple, homely, but poetic charm the commonest 
verities of human experience. The appeal to the 
sensibility and moral judgment of pupils is direct and 
spontaneous, because of the interests and sympathies 
that are inherent in persons, and touch directly the 
childish fancy. And, lastly, the irrepressible tradi- 
tional demand that children shall learn to read, is 
fairly and honestly met and satisfied. 
It is not claimed that fairy tales involve the sum 
total of primary instruction, but they are an illustra- 
tion of how rich will be the fruitage of our educa- 
‘tional effort if we consider first the highest needs and 
interests of children, and allow the formal arts to 
drop into their proper subordination. “The best is
-P-A-G-E-79
FIRST GRADE STORIES 69 
good enough for children,” and when we select the 
best, the wide-reaching connections which are estab- 
lished between studies carry us a long step toward 
the now much-bruited correlation and concentration 
of studies.

THE FABLES 
No group of stories has a more assured place in 
the literature for children than the AXsop’s “ Fables.” 
Some of the commonest have been expanded into 
little stories which are presented orally to children in 
the first school year, as “The Lion and the Mouse,” 
“The Ants and the Grasshoppers,” “ The Dog and his 
Shadow,” and others. They are so simple and direct 
that they are used alongside the fairy tales for the 
earliest instruction of children. 
As soon as children have acquired the rudiments of 
reading the Aisop’s “ Fables”’ are commonly used in 
the second and third school year as a reading book, 
and all the early reading books are partly made up 
from this material. 
If we inquire into the qualities of these stories 
which have given them such a universal acceptance, 
we shall find that they contain in a simple, transparent 
form a good share of the world’s wisdom. More 
recent researches indicate that they originated in 
India, and reached Europe through Persia and Arabia, 
being ascribed to AZsop. This indicates that like 
most early literature of lasting worth, they are prod- 
ucts of the folk-mind rather than of a single writer, 
and it is the opinion of Adler that they express the 
ripened wisdom of the people under the forms of 
Oriental despotism. The sad and hopeless submis- 
sion to a stronger power expressed by some of the
-P-A-G-E-81
FIRST GRADE STORIES Te 
fables, it is claimed, unfits them for use in our freer 
life to-day. 
There are certain points in which their attractive- 
ness to children is clearly manifest. The actors in 
the stories are usually animals, and the ready inter- 
est and sympathy of children for talking animals 
are at once appealed to. In all the early myths 
and fairy tales, human life seems to merge into that 
of the animals, as in “ Hiawatha,” and the fables 
likewise are a marked expression of this childlike 
tendency. 
Adler says: “The question may be asked why 
fables are so popular with boys. I should say be- 
cause schoolboy society reproduces in miniature, to 
a certain extent, the social conditions which are re- 
flected in the fables. Among unregenerate school- 
boys there often exists a kind of despotism, not the 
less degrading because petty. The strong are pitted 
against the weak—witness the fagging system in 
English schools —and their mutual antagonism pro- 
duces in both the characteristic vices which we have 
noted above.” A literature which clearly pictures 
these relations so that they can be seen objectively 
by the children may be of the greatest social service 
in education. 
Adler says further: “The psychological study of 
schoolboy society has been only begun, but even what 
lies on the surface will, I think, bear out this remark. 
Now it has become one of the commonplaces of
-P-A-G-E-82
ee ee 
72 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
educational literature that the individual of to-day 
must pass through the same stages of evolution as 
the human race as a whole. But it should not be 
forgotten that the advance of civilization depends on 
two conditions: first, that the course of evolution be 
accelerated, that the time allowed to*the successive 
stages be shortened ; and, secondly, that the unworthy 
and degrading elements which entered into the pro- 
cess of evolution in the past, and at the time were 
inseparable from it, be now eliminated. Thus the 
fairy tales which correspond to the myth-making 
epoch in human history must be purged of the dross 
of superstition which still adheres to them, and the 
fables which correspond to the age of primitive 
despotisms must be cleansed of the immoral elements 
they still embody.” ? 
The peculiar form of moral teaching in the “Fables” 
suits them especially to children. A single trait of 
conduct, like greediness or selfishness, is sharply 
outlined in the story and its results made plain. “We 
have seen nothing finer in teaching than the building 
up of these little stories in conversational lessons — 
first to illustrate some mental or moral trait; then to 
detach the idea from its story picture, and find illus- 
trations for it in some other act or incident. And 
nothing can be more gratifying as a result, than, 
through the transparency of childish hearts, to watch 
the growth of right conduct from the impulses derived 
1Adler, Moral Instruction of Children, pp. 88-89. 
 
-P-A-G-E-83
  FIRST GRADE STORIES 73 
from the teaching; and so laying the foundations of 
future rightness of character.” ? 
The moral ideas inculcated by the fables are usually 
of a practical, worldly-wisdom sort, not high ideals of 
moral quality, not virtue for its own sake, but varied 
examples of the results of rashness and folly. This 
is, perhaps, one reason why they are so well suited 
to the immature moral judgments of children. 
Adler says: “Often when a child has committed 
some fault, it is useful to refer by name to the fable 
that fits it. As, when a boy has made room in his 
seat for another, and the other crowds him out, the 
mere mention of the fable of the porcupine is a 
telling rebuke; or the fable of the hawk and the 
pigeons may be called to mind when a boy has 
been guilty of mean excuses. On the same principle 
that angry children are sometimes taken before a 
mirror to show them how ugly they look, the fable 
is a kind of mirror for the vices of the young.” 
Again: “The peculiar value of the fables is that 
they are instantaneous photographs which repro- 
duce, as it were, in a single flash of light, some one 
aspect of human nature, and which, excluding every- 
thing else, permit the attention to be entirely fixed 
on that one.” 
But the value of the fable reaches far beyond 
childhood. The frequency with which it is cited in 
nearly all the forms of literature, and its aptness 
. 1 Introduction to Stickney’s Zsop’s Fables. Ginn & Co.

  74 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
to express the real meaning of many episodes in 
real life, in politics and social events, in peace and 
war, show the universality of the truth it embodies. 
A story which engraves a truth, as it were with a 
diamond point, upon a child’s mind, a truth which 
will swiftly interpret many events in his later life, 
deserves to take a high place among educative in- 
fluences.

SEconp GRADE STORIES 
“ROBINSON CRUSOE ” 
In selecting suitable literature for children of the 
second grade, we follow in the steps of a number 
of distinguished writers and teachers and choose an 
English classic— “ Robinson Crusoe.” Rousseau gave 
this book his unqualified approval, and said that it 
would be the first, and, for a time, the only book 
that Emile should read. The Herbartians have been 
using it a number of years, while many American 
teachers have employed it for oral work in second 
grade, in a short school edition. In one sense, the 
book needs no introduction, as it has found its way 
into every nook and corner of the world. Originally 
a story for adults, it has reached all, and illustrated 
Christmas editions, designed even for children from 
three years and upward, are abundant. To the 
youth of all lands, it has been, to say the least, a 
source of delight, but it has been regarded as a 
book for the family and home. What would hap- 
pen should the schoolmaster lay his hand on this 
treasure and desecrate it to school purposes! We

desire to test this classic work on the side of its 
pedagogical value and its adaptation to the uses of 
regular instruction. If it is really unrivalled as a 
piece of children’s literature, perhaps it has also 
no equal for school purposes. 
In making the transition from the fairy tale to 
“Robinson Crusoe,” an interesting difference or con- 
trast may be noticed. Wilmann says:! “ ‘Crusoe’ is 
at once simple, and plain, and fanciful; to be sure, 
in the latter case, entirely different from the fairy 
tale. In the fairy story the fancy seldom pushes 
rudely against the boundaries of the real world. 
But otherwise in ‘Crusoe.’ Here it is the practical 
fancy that is aroused, if this expression appear not 
contradictory. Whatis Crusoe todonow? Howcan 
he help himself? What means can he invent? Many 
of the proposals of the children will have to be re- 
jected. The inexorable ‘not possible’ shoves a bolt 
before the door. The imagination is compelled to 
limit itself to the task of combining and adjusting 
real things. The compulsion of things conditions 
the progress of the story. ‘Thoughts dwell together 
easily, but things jostle each other roughly in space.’” 
There are other striking differences between “ Cru- 
soe” and the folk-lore stories, but in this contrast we 
are now chiefly concerned. After reaching the island, 
he is checked and limited at every step by the physi- 
cal laws imposed by nature. Struggle and fret as 
1 Wilmann, Paedagogische Vortrige.

SECOND GRADE STORIES Thi 
he may against these limits, he becomes at last a 
philosopher, and quietly takes up the struggle for 
existence under those inexorable conditions. The 
child of seven or eight is vaguely acquainted with 
many of the simple employments of the household 
and of the neighborhood. Crusoe also had a vague 
memory of how people in society in different trades 
and occupations supply the necessaries and com- 
forts of life. Even the fairy stories give many hints 
of this kind of knowledge, but Robinson Crusoe is 
face to face with the sour facts. He is cut off from 
help and left to his own resources. The interest in 
the story is in seeing how he will shift for himself 
and exercise his wits to insure plenty and comfort. 
With few tools and on a barbarous coast, he under- 
takes what men in society, by mutual exchange and 
by division of labor, have much difficulty in perform- 
ing. Crusoe becomes a carpenter, a baker and cook, 
a hunter, a potter, a fisher, a farmer, a tailor, a boat- 
man, a stock-raiser, a basket-maker, a shoemaker, a 
tanner, a fruit-grower, a mason, a physician. And 
not only so, but he grapples with the difficulties of 
each trade or occupation in a bungling manner be- 
cause of inexperience and lack of skill and exact 
knowledge. He is an experimenter and _ tester 
along many lines. The entire absence of helpers 
centres the whole interest of this varied struggle in 
one person. It is to be remembered that Crusoe is 
no genius, but the ordinary boy or man. He has 
 
-P-A-G-E-88
78 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
abundant variety of needs such as a child reared 
under civilized conditions has learned to feel. The 
whole range of activities, usually distributed to various 
classes and persons in society, rests now upon his 
single shoulders. If he were an expert in all direc- 
tions, the task would be easier, but he has only vague 
knowledge and scarcely any skill. The child, there- 
fore, who reads this story, by reason of the slow, 
toilsome, and bungling processes of Crusoe in meet- 
ing his needs, becomes aware how difficult and labo- 
rious are the efforts by which the simple, common 
needs of all children are supplied. 
A reference to the different trades and callings 
that Crusoe assumes will show us that he is not deal- 
ing with rare and unusual events, but with the com- 
mon, simple employments that lie at the basis of 
society in all parts of the world. The carpenter, the 
baker, the farmer, the shoemaker, etc., are at work in 
every village in every land. Doubtless this is one 
reason why the story acquires such a hold in the 
most diverse countries. The Arab or the Chinese 
boy, the German or American child, finds the story 
touching the ordinary facts of his own surroundings. 
Though the story finds its setting in a far-away, 
lonely island in tropical seas, Crusoe is daily trying 
to create the objects and conditions of his old home 
in England. But these are the same objects that 
surround every child ; and therefore, in reading “ Rob- 
inson Crusoe,” the pupil is making an exhaustive and
-P-A-G-E-89
  SECOND GRADE STORIES 79 
interesting study of his own home. The presence of 
a tropical vegetation and of a strange climate does 
not seriously impair this fact. The skill of a great 
literary artist appears in his power to create a situa- 
tion almost devoid of common comforts and bless- 
ings and then in setting his hero to work to create 
them by single-handed effort. 
It will hardly be questioned that the study of the 
home and home neighborhood by children is one of 
the large and prominent problems in education. Out 
of their social, economic, and physical environment 
children get the most important lessons of life. Not 
only does the home furnish a varied fund of informa- 
tion that enables them to interpret books, and people, 
and institutions, as they sooner or later go out into 
the world, but all the facts gathered by experience 
and reading in distant fields must flow back again to 
give deeper meaning to the labors and duties which 
surround each citizen in his own home. But society 
with its commerce, education, and industries, is an 
exceedingly complex affair. The child knows not 
where to begin to unravel this endless machinery of 
forms and institutions. In a sense he must get away 
from or disentangle himself from his surroundings in 
order to understand them. There are no complex 
conditions surrounding Crusoe, and he takes up the 
labors of the common trades in a simple and primi- 
tive manner. Physical and mental effort are de-

children. Many of his efforts involve repeated fail- 
ure, as in making pottery, in building a boat, while 
some things that he undertakes with painful toil 
never attain success. The lesson of toil and hard- 
ship connected with the simple industries is one of 
great moment to children. Our whole social fabric 
is based on these toils, and it is one of the best 
results of a sound education to realize the place and 
importance of hard work. 
It scarcely needs to be pointed out that Crusoe 
typifies a long period of man’s early history, the age 
when men were learning the rudiments of civilization 
by taking up the toils of the blacksmith, the agri- 
culturist, the builder, the domesticator of animals and 
plants. Men emerged from barbarism as they slowly 
and painfully gained the mastery over the resources 
of nature. Crusoe is a sort of universal man, em- 
bodying in his single effort that upward movement 
of men which has steadily carried them to the higher 
levels of progress. It has been said with some truth 
that Robinson Crusoe is a philosophy of history. 
But we scarcely need such a high-sounding name. 
To the child he is a very concrete, individual man, 
with very simple and interesting duties. 
In a second point the author of “ Robinson Crusoe” 
shows himself a literary master. There is an intense 
and naive realism in his story. Even if one were so 
disposed, it would require a strong effort to break 
loose from the feeling that we are in the presence of
-P-A-G-E-91
SECOND GRADE STORIES 81 
real experiences. There is a quiet but irresistible 
assumption of unvarnished and even disagreeable 
fact in the narrative. But it is useless to describe 
the style of a book so familiar. Its power over 
youthful fancy and feeling has been too often experi- 
enced to be doubted. The vivid interest which the 
book awakens is certain to carry home whatever les- 
sons it may teach with added force. So great is this 
influence that boys sometimes imitate the efforts of 
Crusoe by making caves, building ovens, and assum- 
ing a style of dress and living that approximates 
Crusoe’s state. This supplies to teachers a hint of 
some value. The-story of Crusoe should lead to 
excursions into the home neighborhood for the pur- 
pose of a closer examination of the trades and occu- 
pations there represented. An imitation of his labors 
may also be encouraged. The effort to mould and 
bake vessels from potter’s clay, the platting of bas- 
kets from willow withes, the use of tools in making 
boxes or tables may be attempted far enough to dis- 
cover how lacking in practical ability the children 
are. This will certainly teach them greater respect 
for manual skill. 
From the previous discussion it might appear that 
we regard the story of Crusoe as technological and 
industrial rather than moral. But it would be a mis- 
take to suppose that a book is not moral because it is 
not perpetually dispensing moral platitudes. Most 
men’s lives are mainly industrial. The display of 
@
-P-A-G-E-92
  82 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
moral qualities is only occasional and incidental. 
The development of moral character is coincident 
with the labors and experiences of life and springs 
out of them, being manifested by the spirit with 
which one acts toward his fellow-men. But Crusoe 
was alone on his island, and there might seem to be 
no opportunity to be moral in relation to others. So- 
ciety, to be sure, was conspicuous by its absence. 
But the intense longing with which he thought of 
the home and companionships lost is perhaps the 
strongest sentiment in the book. His loneliness 
brings out most vividly his true relation to home and 
friends. 
His early life, till the shipwreck, was that of a way- 
ward and reckless youth, disobedient to parents and 
seemingly without moral scruples. Even during the 
first months upon the island there appears little moral 
change or betterment. But slowly the bitter experi- 
ences of his lonely life sober him. He finds a Bible, 
and a fit of sickness reveals the distresses that may 
lie before him. When once the change has set in, it 
is rapid and thorough. He becomes devout, he longs 
to return to his parents and atone for his faults. A 
complete reformation of his moral disposition is 
effected. If one will take the pains to read the 
original “ Robinson Crusoe” he will find it surpris- 
ingly serious and moral in its tone. He devotes 
much time to soliloquizing on the distresses of his 
condition and upon the causes which have brought
-P-A-G-E-93
SECOND GRADE STORIES 83 
him to misery. He diagnoses his case with an 
amount of detail that must be tedious to children. 
The fact that these parts of the book often leave 
little direct impression upon children is proof that 
they are chiefly engaged with the adventure and 
physical embarrassments of Crusoe. For the present 
it is sufficient to observe that the story is deeply and 
intensely moral both in its spirit and in the changes 
described in “ Crusoe.” 
We are next led to inquire whether the industrial 
and moral lessons contained in this story are likely to 
be extracted from it by a boy or girl who reads it 
alone, without the aid of a teacher. Most young 
readers of “Crusoe” are carried along by the inter- 
esting adventure. It is a very surprising and enter- 
taining story. But children even less than adults are 
inclined to go deeper than the surface and draw up 
hidden treasures. De Foe’s work is a piece of classic 
literature. But few people are inclined to get at the 
deeper meaning and spirit of a classical masterpiece 
unless they go through it in companionship with a 
teacher who is gifted to disclose its better meaning. 
This is true of any classical product we might men- 
tion. It should be the peculiar function of the 
school to cultivate a taste, and an appreciative taste, 
for the best literature; not by leaving it to the hap- 
hazard home reading of pupils, but by selecting the 
best things adapted to the minds of children and then 
employing true teaching skill to bring these treas-
-P-A-G-E-94

84 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
ures close to the hearts and sympathies of children. 
Many young people do not read “ Robinson Crusoe” at 
all; many others do not appreciate its better phases. 
The school will much improve its work by taking 
for its own this best of children’s stories, and by 
extending and deepening the children’s appreciation 
of a classic. 
The story of Robinson Crusoe is made by the 
Herbartians the nucleus for the concentration of 
studies in the second year. This importance is 
given to it on account of its strong moral tone and 
because of its universal typical’ character in man’s 
development. Without attempting a solution of the 
problem of concentration at this juncture, we should 
at least observe the relations of this story to the 
other studies. Wilmann says: “The everywhere 
and nowhere of the fairy tale gives place to the 
first geographical limitations. The continents, the 
chief countries of Europe, come up, besides a series 
of geographical concepts such as island, coast, bay, 
river, hill, mountain, sea, etc. The difference in 
climate is surprising. Crusoe fears the winter and 
prepares for it, but his fear is needless, for no winter 
reaches his island.” We have already observed its 
instructive treatment of the common occupations 
which prepare for later geographical study, as well 
as for natural science. 
Many plants and animals are brought to notice 
which would furnish a good beginning for natural 
 
-P-A-G-E-95
ee ee ee ae 
SECOND GRADE STORIES 85 
science lessons. It is advisable, however, to study 
rather those home animals and plants which corre- 
spond best to the tropical products or animals in the 
lessons. Tropical fruits, the parrot, and the goat we 
often meet at home, but in addition, the sheep, the 
ox, the mocking-bird, the woodpecker, our native 
fruits and grains, and the fish, turtles, and minerals 
of the home, may well be suggested and studied in 
science lessons parallel with the life of Crusoe. 
Following upon the oral treatment and discussion 
of “Robinson Crusoe” the children are easily led to 
like efforts at construction, as, for instance, the mak- 
ing of a raft, the building of the cave and stockade, 
the making of chairs and tables, the moulding of jars 
and kettles out of clay, the weaving of baskets, the 
preparation and cooking of foods, the planting of 
grains, the construction of an oven or house, boat 
building, and other labors of Crusoe in providing for 
his wants. 
It is quite customary now in second grade to set 
the children to work in these efforts to solve Crusoe’s 
problems, so that they, by working with actual 
materials, may realize more fully the difficulties and 
trials to which he was subjected. In close connec- 
tion with these constructive efforts are the drawings 
of the scenes of the story, such as the shipwreck, 
the stockade, the boat, the map of the island, and 
some of the later events of the story. A still further 
means of giving reality to the events is to dramatize 
 
-P-A-G-E-96
  86 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
some of the scenes between Friday and Crusoe, and 
to dress and equip these and other persons in the 
story in fitting manner. The children gladly enter 
into such dramatic action. These various forms of 
drawing, action, and constructive work are in close 
connection with the home studies of industries and 
occupations, —farming, gardening, carpenter and 
blacksmith shops, weaving, cooking, bakeries, and ex- 
cursions to shops— which follow the Crusoe story 
in the study of home geography in the third grade. 
Although the story should be given and discussed 
orally, the children should also read it later as a part 
of the regular reading exercise of the course. 
Instead of suffering from this repetition, their inter- 
est will only be increased. Classical products usu- 
ally gain by repetition. The facts are brought out 
more clearly and the deeper meaning is perceived. 
‘To have the oral treatment of a story precede its 
reading by some weeks or months produces an excel- 
lent effect upon the style of the reading. The 
thought being familiar, and the interest strong, the 
expression will be vigorous and natural. Children 
take a pride in reading a story which they at first 
must receive orally for lack of reading power. 
The same advantageous drill in the use of good 
English accrues to the Crusoe story that was ob- 
served in the fairy tales. There is abundant oppor- 
tunity for oral narrative and description. 
The use of the pencil and chalk in graphic repre
-P-A-G-E-97
SECOND GRADE STORIES 87 
sentation should be encouraged both in teacher and 
in pupils. Thus the eye becomes more accurate in 
observation and the hand more free and facile in 
tracing the outlines of the interesting forms studied. 
The use of tools and materials in construction gives 
ideas an anchorage, not only in the brain, but even 
in the nerves and muscles. 
In thus glancing over the field we discover the 
same many-sided and intimate relation with other 
school studies, as in the previous grade. In fact, 
“Crusoe” is the first extended classical masterpiece 
which is presented to the children as a whole. Such 
parts of the story as are of most pedagogical value 
should be simplified and woven together into a con- 
tinuous narrative. That part of the story which pre- 
cedes the shipwreck may be reduced to a few 
paragraphs which bring out clearly his early home 
surroundings, his disobedience and the desertion of 
his parents, and the voyage which led to his lonely 
life upon the island. The period embraced in his 
companionless labors and experiences constitutes the 
important part for school uses. A few of the more 
important episodes following the capture of Friday 
and his return home may be briefly told. We deem it 
a long step forward to get some of our great classical 
masterpieces firmly embedded in the early years of 
our school course. It will contribute almost as much 
to the culture and stimulation of teachers as of pupils. 
The method of handling this narrative before the
-P-A-G-E-98
88 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
class will be similar to that of the fairy tales. A 
simple and vivid recital of the facts, with frequent 
questions and discussions, so as to draw the story 
closer to the child’s own thought and experience, 
should be made by the teacher. Much skill in illus- 
trative device, in graphic description, in diagram or 
drawing, in the appeal to the sense experiences of 
the pupils, is in demand. The excursion to places of 
interest in the neighborhood suggested by the story 
begins to be an important factor of the school exer- 
cises. As children grow older they acquire skill and 
confidence in oral narrative, and should be held to 
greater independence in oral reproductions. 
One of the best school editions of ‘“ Robinson 
Crusoe” is published by Ginn & Co. 
A simple edition for second grade is published by 
the Public School Publishing Co. 
The teacher should be supplied with one of the 
larger, fuller editions of ‘ Robinson Crusoe,” like that 
of Houghton, Mifflin, & Co., in the Riverside Litera- 
ture Series. It furnishes a much fuller detail of 
knowledge for the teacher’s use. It will also be of 
great advantage for classroom use to possess an illus- 
trated edition like that of George Routledge & Sons. 
The full treatment of this story, first in simple, 
oral narrative, later by its use as a reading book, 
and later still by the child reading the complete 
edition for himself in private, illustrates the intensive 
concentration of thought and constructive activity
-P-A-G-E-99
SECOND GRADE STORIES 89 
upon a great piece of literature as opposed to a loose 
and superficial treatment. Such a piece of work 
should remain for life a source of deeper thought, 
feeling, and experience. 
“HIAWATHA” 
The story of Hiawatha has been much employed 
for oral treatment in primary grades and later for 
regular treatment in reading lessons. 
The story of Hiawatha has been used sufficiently 
in primary grades to show how many are its sugges- 
tions for drawing and constructive work. Little 
children take delight in drawing the Indian tents, 
bows and arrows, pine forests, Indian warriors and 
dress, the canoe, the tomahawk, the birds and ani- 
mals, The cutting of these forms in paper they 
have fully enjoyed. 
Pictures of Indian life, collections of arrow-heads, 
the peace-pipes, articles of dress, cooking utensils, 
wampum, stone hatchets, red pipe-stone ornaments, 
or a visit to any collection of Indian relics are desir- 
able as a part of this instruction. The museums 
in cities and expositions are rich in these materials, 
and in many private collections are just the desired 
objects of study. 
It is well known that children love to construct 
tents, dress in Indian style, and imitate the mode of 
 
-P-A-G-E-100
gO SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
life, the hunting, dancing, and sports of Indians. 
Teachers have taken advantage of this instinct to 
allow them to construct an Indian village on a small 
scale, and assume the dress and action of Hiawatha 
and his friends, and even to dramatize parts of the 
story. 
It is only certain selected parts of the “ Hiawatha” 
that lend themselves best to the oral treatment with 
children, and that, at first, not in the poetic form. 
In fact, the oral treatment of a story in beautiful 
poetic form demands a peculiar method. 
For example, in treating the childhood of Hiawatha 
as he dwelt with old Nokomis in the tent beside the 
sea, the main facts of this episode, or a part of it, 
may be talked over by means of description, partly 
also by development, question, and answer, and when 
these things are clear, let this passage of the poem 
be read to the children. The preliminary treatment 
and discussion will put the children in possession 
of the ideas and pictures by which they can better 
appreciate and assimilate the poem. This mode of 
introducing children to a poem or literary master- 
piece is not uncommon with children in later years, 
at least in the middle grades. 
It has been customary to use nearly the whole 
poem in fourth or fifth school year for regular read- 
ing, and it is well suited to this purpose. Its use in 
primary grades for such oral treatment as we have 
described will not interfere with its employment as

reading matter later on, but rather increase its value 
for that purpose.

tical teachers on the use of “ Hiawatha” in primary 
grades :—

Co.

  CHAPTER V 
THIRD GRADE STORIES 
THE MYTHICAL STORIES 
In the third grade we wish to bring a number of 
the mythical stories vividly before the children. The 
classical myths which belong to the literature of 
Europe are the fund from which to select the best. 
Not all, but only a few of the simple and appropriate 
stories can be chosen. Only two recitation periods a 
week are usually set apart for the oral treatment of 
these old myths. But later in the progress of the 
reading lessons other similar stories should be treated. 
The few recitation periods used for oral work are 
rather designed to introduce children to the spirit of 
this literature, to get them into the appreciative mind. 
This body of ancient myths comes down to us, 
sifted out of the early literature of the active-minded 
Greeks. They have found their way as a simple and 
charming poetry into the national literature of all the 
European countries. Is this the material suited to 
nine- and ten-year-old children? It will not be ques- 
tioned that these myths belong to the best literary 
products of Europe, but are they suited to children? 
It is evident that some of our best literary judges 
have deemed them appropriate. Hawthorne has put 
92
-P-A-G-E-103
THIRD GRADE STORIES 93 
them into a form designed especially for the young 
folk. Charles Kingsley wrote of the Greek myths 
for his children: ‘Now I love these old Hellens 
heartily, and they seem to me like brothers, though 
they have all been dead and gone many a hundred 
years. They are come to tell you some of their old fairy 
tales, which they loved when they were young like 
you. For nations begin at first by being children like 
you, though they are made up of grown men. They 
are children at first like you — men and women with 
children’s hearts; frank, and affectionate, and full 
of trust, and teachable, loving to see and learn all 
the wonders around them; and greedy also, too 
often, and passionate and silly, as children are.” 
Not a few other authors of less note have tried to 
turn the classical myths of the old Greek poets into 
simple English for the entertainment and instruction 
of children. Scarcely any of these stories that have 
not appeared in various children’s books in recent 
years. Taken as a whole, they are a storehouse 
of children’s literature. The philosopher, Herbart, 
looked upon poems of Homer as giving ideal expres- 
sion to the boyhood of the race, and the story of 
Ulysses was regarded by him as the boy’s book, — 
the Greek Robinson Crusoe. For the child of nine 
years he thought it the most suitable story. 
Kingsley says in his Introduction: “ Now you must 
not think of the Greeks in this book as learned men, 
living in great cities, such as they were afterwards,
-P-A-G-E-104
ee ee ee 
94. SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
when they wrought all their beautiful works, but as 
country people, living on farms and in walled villages, 
in a simple, hard-working way; so that the greatest 
kings and heroes cooked their own meals and thought 
it no shame, and made their own ships and weapons, 
and fed and harnessed their own horses. So that a 
man was honored among them, not because he hap- 
pened to be rich, but according to his skill and his 
strength and courage and the number of things he 
could do. For they were but grown-up children, 
though they were right noble children too, and it was 
with them as it is now at school, the strongest and 
cleverest boy, though he be poor, leads all the rest.” 
In the introduction to the “ Wonder Book” we find 
the following: “ Hawthorne took a vital interest in 
child life. He was accustomed to observe his own 
children very closely. There are private manuscripts 
extant which present exact records of what his young 
son and elder daughter said or did from hour to hour, 
the father seating himself in their playroom and 
patiently noting all that passed. To this habit of 
watchful and sympathetic scrutiny we may attribute 
in part the remarkable felicity, the fortunate ease of 
adaptation to the immature understanding, and the 
skilful appeal to the fresh imaginations which char- 
acterize his stories for the young.” Hawthorne him- 
self says: ‘The author has long been of the opinion 
that many of the classical myths were capable of 
being rendered into very capital reading for chil- 
 
-P-A-G-E-105
  THIRD GRADE STORIES 95 
dren... . No epoch of time can claim a copyright 
on these immortal fables. They seem never to have 
been made, and so long as man exists they can never 
perish ; but by their indestructibility itself they are 
legitimate subjects, for every age to clothe with its 
own garniture of manners and sentiment, and to 
imbue with its own morality. ... The author has 
not always thought it necessary to write downward in 
order to meet the comprehension of children. He has 
generally suffered the theme to soar, whenever such 
was its tendency. Children possess an unestimated 
sensibility to whatever is deep or high in imagination 
or feeling so long as it is simple likewise. It is only 
the artificial and the complex that bewilder them.” 
A brief analysis of the qualities which render these 
myths so attractive will help us to see their value in 
the education of children. 
The astonishing brightness of fanciful episode and 
of pure and clear-cut imagery has an indestructible 
charm for children. They can soar into and above 
the clouds on the shining wings of Pegasus. With 
Eolus they shut up the contrary winds in an ox-hide, 
and later let them out to plague the much-suffering 
Ulysses. They watch with astonishment as Jason 
yokes the fire-breathing oxen and strews the field 
with uprooted stumps and stones as he prepares the 
soil for the seed of dragon’s teeth. Each child 
becomes a poet as he recreates the sparkling bright- 
ness of these simple pictures. And when a child
-P-A-G-E-106
96 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
has once suffered his fancy to soar to these mountain 
heights and ocean depths, it will no longer be possi- 
ble to make his life entirely dull and prosaic. He 
has caught glimpses of a bright world that will linger 
unfading in the uplands of his memory. And while 
they are so deep and lofty they are still, as Haw- 
thorne says, very simple. Some of the most classic 
of the old stories are indeed too long for third grade 
children ; too many persons and too much complexity, 
as in the “ Tales of Troy.” But on the other hand, 
many of the most beautiful of the old myths are as 
plain and simple to a child as a floating summer 
cloud. High in the sky they may be or deep in the 
reflection of some lake or spring, but clear and plain 
to the thought of a little child. These stories in their 
naive simplicity reflect the wonder and surprise with 
which a person first beholds grand and touching 
scenery, whether it be the oppressive grandeur of 
some beetling mountain crag, or the placid quiet of 
a moonlit stream. The stories selected for this grade 
should be the simplest and best: ‘The Golden Touch,” 
“Perseus,” “The Chimzra,” of Hawthorne, the epi- 
sodes of the “Golden Fleece,” with others similar. 
In one form or another they introduce us to the 
company of heroes, or, at least, of great and simple 
characters. Deeds of enterprise and manliness or 
of unselfishness and generosity are the climax of the 
story. To meet danger and hardship or ridicule for 
the sake of a high purpose is their underlying
-P-A-G-E-107
THIRD GRADE STORIES 97 
thought. Perseus and Jason and Ulysses are all 
ambitious to prove their title to superior shrewdness 
and courage and self-control. When we get fairly 
into the mythical age, we find ourselves among the 
heroes, among those striving for mastery and leader- 
ship in great undertakings. Physical prowess and 
manly spirit are its chief virtues. And can there 
be any question that there is a time in the lives of 
children when these ideas fill the horizon of their 
thought? Samson and David and Hercules, Bel- 
lerophon and Jason, are a child’s natural thoughts- 
or, at least, they fit the frame of his mind so exactly 
that one may say the picture and the frame were 
made for each other. The history of most countries 
contains such an age of heroes. Tell in Switzerland, 
Siegfried in Germany, Bruce in Scotland, Romulus 
and Horatius at Rome, Alfred in England, are all 
national heroes of the mythical age, whose deeds are 
heroic and of public good. The Greek stories are 
only a more classic edition of this historical epoch, 
and should lead up to a study of these later products 
of European literature. 
Several forms of moral excellence are objectively 
realized or personified in these stories. 
As the wise Centaur, after teaching Jason to be 
skilful and brave, sent him out into the world, he 
said: “Well, go, my son; the throne belongs to thy 
father and the gods love justice. But remember, wher- 
ever thou dost wander, to observe these three things: 
H
-P-A-G-E-108
98 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
“Relieve the distressed. 
“Respect the aged. 
“Be true to thy word.” ? 
And many events in Jason’s life illustrate the 
wisdom of these words. The miraculous pitcher is 
one whose fountain of refreshing milk bubbled 
always because of a gentle deed of hospitality to 
strangers. King Midas, on the other hand, experi- 
ences in most graphic form the punishment which 
ought to follow miserly greed, while his humble 
penitence brought back his daughter and the homely 
comforts of life. Bellerophon is filled with a desire 
to perform a noble deed that will relieve the distress 
of a whole people. After the exercise of much 
patience and self-control he succeeds in his gener- 
ous enterprise. Many a lesson of worldly wisdom 
and homely virtue is brought out in the story of 
Ulysses’ varied and adventuresome career. 
These myths bring children into lively contact 
with European history and geography, as well as 
with its modes of life and thought. The early his- 
tory of Europe is in all cases shrouded in mist and 
legend. But even from this historically impenetra- 
ble past has sprung a literature that has exercised a 
profound influence upon the life and growth of the 
people. Not that children are conscious of the sig- 
nificance of these ideas, but being placed in an 
1 Jason’s Quest (Lowell), p. 55-

THIRD GRADE STORIES 99 
atmosphere which is full of them, their deeper mean. 
ing gradually unfolds itself. The early myths afford 
an interesting approach for children to the history 
and geography of important countries. Those coun- 
tries they must, sooner or later, make the acquaint- 
ance of both geographically and historically, and 
could anything be designed to take stronger hold 
upon their imagination and memory than these 
charming myths, which were the poetry and religion 
of the people once living there? 
It is a very simple and primitive state of culture, 
whose ships, arms, agriculture, and domestic life are 
given us in clear and pleasing pictures. Our own 
country is largely lacking in a mythical age. Our 
culture sprang, more than half-grown, from the 
midst of Europe’s choicest nations, and out of insti- 
tutions that had been centuries in forming. The 
myths of Europe are therefore as truly ours as they 
are the treasure of Englishmen, of Germans, or of 
Greeks. Again, our own literature, as well as that 
of European states, is full of the spirit and sugges- 
tion of the mythical age. Our poets and writers 
have drawn much of their imagery from this old 
storehouse of thought, and a child will better under- 
stand the works of the present through this contact 
with mythical ages. 
In method of treatment with school classes, these 
stories will admit of a variation from the plan used with 
“Robinson Crusoe.” One unaccustomed to the reading 
LIBRARY

of such stories would be at a loss for a method of 
treatment with children. There is a charm and liter- 
ary art in the presentation that may make the 
teacher feel unqualified to present them. The chil- 
dren are not yet sufficiently masters of the printed 
symbols of speech to read for themselves. Shall the 
teacher simply read the stories to children? We 
would suggest first of all, that the teacher, who would 
expect to make use of these materials, steep himself 
fully in literature of this class, and bring his mind 
into familiar acquaintance and sympathy with its char- 
acters. In interpreting classical authors to pupils, 
we are justified in requiring of the teacher intimate 
knowledge and appreciative sympathy with his author. 
Certainly no one will teach these stories well whose 
fancy was never touched into airy flights — who can- 
not become a child again and partake of his pleas- 
ures. No condescension is needed, but ascension to 
a free and ready flight of fancy. By learning to 
drink at these ancient fountains of song and poetry, 
the teacher might learn to tell a fairy story for him- 
self. But doubtless it will be well to mingle oral narra- 
tive and description on the part of the teacher with the 
fit reading of choice parts so as to better preserve the 
classic beauty and suggestion of the author. Children 
are quite old enough now to appreciate beauty of lan- 
guage and expressive, happy turns of speech. In 
the midst of question, suggestion, and discussion be- 
tween pupil and teacher, the story should be carried

THIRD GRADE STORIES Io1 
forward, never forgetting to stop at suitable intervals 
and get such a reproduction of the story as the little 
children are capable of. And indeed they are capa- 
ble of much in this direction, for their thoughts are 
more nimble, and their power of expression more apt, 
oftentimes, than the teacher’s own. 
We would not favor a simple reading of these 
stories for the entertainment of pupils. It should 
take more the form of a school exercise, requiring 
not only interest and attention, but vigorous effort to 
grasp and reproduce the thought. The. result should 
be a much livelier and deeper insight into the story 
than would be secured by a simple reading for amuse- 
ment or variety. They should prepare also for an 
appreciative reading of other myths in the following 
grades. ore: 
After all, in two or three recitation periods a week, 
extending through a year, it cannot be expected that 
children will make the acquaintance of all the litera- 
ture that could be properly called the myth of the 
heroic age in different countries. All that we may 
expect is to enter this paradise of children, to pluck 
a few of its choicest flowers, and get such a breath of 
their fragrance that there will be a child’s desire to 
return again and again. The school also should pro- 
vide in the succeeding year for an abundance of read- 
ing of myths. The same old stories which they first 
learned to enjoyin oral recitations should be read in 
books, and still others should be utilized in the regu.

lar reading classes of the fourth and fifth grades. In 
this way the myths of other countries may be brought 
in, the story of Tell, of Siegfried, of Alfred, and of 
others. 
In summarizing the advantages of a systematic 
attempt to get this simple classic lore into our 
schools, we recall the interest and mental activity 
which it arouses, its power to please and satisfy the 
creative fancy in children, its fundamental feeling 
and instincts, the virtues of bravery, manliness, and 
unselfishness, and all this in a form that still further 
increases its culture effect upon teacher and pupil. 
It should never be forgotten that teacher and pupil 
alike are here imbibing lessons and inspirations that 
draw them into closer sympathy because the subject 
is worthy of both old and young. 
In addition to the earlier Greek myths we may men- 
tion the following subjects as suitable for oral treatment: 
The story of Ulysses has been much used in schools 
with oral presentation, and is one of the best tales for 
this purpose in all literature. A somewhat full dis- 
cussion of the value of this story for schools is found 
in the Special Method in Reading of Complete 
English Classics. 
The Norse mythology has also received much 
attention from teachers who have used the oral mode 
of treatment. Several of the best books of Norse 
mythology are mentioned in the appended list. Also 
the great story of Siegfried.

THIRD GRADE STORIES 103 
Some of the old traditional stories in the early his- 
tory of Rome, of France, Germany, and England, have 
been used for oral narration and reading to children. 
The “ Seven Little Sisters” and its companion book 
“Each and All,” and the “Ten Boys on the Road 
from Long Ago to Now,” by Jane Andrews, published 
by Ginn & Co., have been employed extensively for 
oral and reading work in the third and fourth years 
of school. The “Seven Little Sisters” is valuable in 
connection with the beginnings of geography.

THE BIBLE STORIES 
The stories of early Bible history have been much 
used in all European lands, and in America, for the 
instruction of children. Among Jews and Christians 
everywhere, and even among Mohammedans, these 
stories have been extensively used. They include 
the simple accounts of the patriarchs, Abraham, 
Isaac, Jacob, Joseph and his brethren, Moses, Joshua, 
Samson, Samuel, and David. It may be seen at a 
glance that no more famous stories than these could 
be selected from the history of any country in the 
world. They stand preéminent as graphic descrip- 
tions of the modes of life which prevailed in the early 
period of civilized races. The old patriarchs lived in 
what is usually called the pastoral age, when men 
dwelt in tents and moved about from place to place
-P-A-G-E-116
| il a a a 
106 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
with their flocks in search of pasture. The patriarch 
at the head of the family, and even of a whole tribe, 
is the father, ruler, priest, and judge for the little 
community over which he presides. In his person 
there is a simple union of all the important powers | 
of the later Hebrew state. The dignity and authority 
which centre in the person of Abraham, together 
with a marked gravity and strength of character, 
lend a distinct grandeur to his personality, so that he 
has been recognized in all ages as one of the great 
figures in the history of the world; the foremost of 
the old patriarchs,—the father of the faithful. A 
similar respect and dignity attaches to all these old 
Bible characters, and in the case of Moses, rises to 
a supreme height, while in David the warrior, states- 
man, and poet are united in one of the most pro- 
nounced and pleasing characters in the world’s 
history. These old stories are also unparalleled in 
the simplicity and transparent clearness with which 
the life of the pastoral age is depicted. Human 
nature comes out in a series of pictures most striking 
and individual, and yet unmistakably true to life and 
reality. And yet while this life was so small in its 
compass, it is almost wholly free from narrowness   and provincialism. The universal qualities of human 
nature, common to men in all ages and countries, 
stand out with a clearness which even little children 
can grasp. The story of Joseph and his brethren is 
probably the finest story that was ever written for
-P-A-G-E-117
THIRD GRADE STORIES 107 
children from eight to ten years of age. The char- 
acters involved in this family history are striking and 
impressive, and the strength of the family virtues 
and affections has never been set forth with greater 
simplicity and power. 
The heroic qualities which appear in the old Bible 
stories, especially in Moses, Samson, and David, would, 
bear a favorable comparison with the men of the 
heroic age in all countries. Strength of character 
combined with faith in high ideals, pursued with 
unwavering resolution, is a peculiar merit of these 
narratives. The heroes of the Hebrew race should 
be compared, later on, with the most renowned 
heroes of England, Scotland, Germany, and Greece, 
and even of America, for they have common qualities 
which have like merit as educative materials for the 
young. 
This early literature of the Bible stories will be 
found to contain a large part of the universal thought 
of the world, that is, of the masterly ideas which, 
because of their superior truth and excellence, have 
gradually worked their way as controlling principles 
into the life of all modern nations. It need hardly 
be said that these stories have a peculiar charm 
and attractiveness for children. The simplicity of a 
patriarchal age, the strong interest in persons of 
heroic quality, the descriptions of early childhood, 
the heroic deeds of bold and high-spirited youth, — 
these things command the unfaltering interest of
-P-A-G-E-118
108 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
children, and at the same time give their lives a 
touch of moral strength and idealism which is of the 
highest promise. 
The oral treatment of these stories in the third or 
fourth year of school is the only mode of bringing 
them before the children in their full power, and they 
are well adapted to easy oral narrative and discussion. 
The language is the genuine, simple, powerful old 
English, and the teacher should become thoroughly 
saturated with these simple words and modes of 
thought. The dramatic element is also not lacking 
in many parts, and can be well executed in the class- 
room. Many opportunities will be furnished to the 
children for drawing pictures illustrating the stories. 
Many of the most famous masterpieces of painting 
and sculpture represent the persons and scenes of 
these tales. The great heroes of Christian art have 
exhausted their skill in these representations, which 
are now being furnished to the schools by the large 
publishing houses. Even the costumes and modes 
of life are thus brought home to the children in the 
most realistic yet artistic way. 
An acquaintance with such early stories of Hebrew 
history is an introduction to some of the finest litera- 
ture of the English language. First, that dealing with 
the Hebrew scriptures themselves, as the books of 
Moses, the psalms of David, and second, a number of 
the great poems of English masters, as the “ Burial 
of Moses” and Milton’s “Samson Agonistes.” In
-P-A-G-E-119
  THIRD GRADE STORIES 10g 
short, we may say that these stories are the key toa 
large part of our best English thought. 
Adler, in his “ Moral Instruction of Children,” says : 
“The narrative of the Bible is fairly saturated with 
the moral spirit; the moral issues are everywhere in 
the forefront. Duty, guilt, and its punishment, the 
conflict of conscience with inclination, are the lead- 
ing themes. The Hebrew people seem to have been 
endowed with what may be called ‘a moral genius,’ 
and especially did they emphasize the filial and fra- 
ternal duties to an extent hardly equalled elsewhere. 
Now it is precisely these duties that must be im- 
pressed upon young children, and hence the biblical 
stories present us with the very material we require. 
They cannot, in this respect, be replaced; there is 
no other literature in the world:that offers what is 
equal to them in value for the particular object we 
now have in view.” 
If we could only contemplate the patriarchal stories 
as a part of the great literature of the world, on 
account of its typical yet realistic portraiture of men 
and women, we might use this material as we use the 
very best derived from other sources. Mr. Adler 
remarks that “this typical quality in’ Homer’s por- 
traiture has been one secret of its universal impres- 
siveness. The Homeric outlines are in each case 
brilliantly distinct, while they leave to the reader a 
certain liberty of private conception, and he can fill 
them in to satisfy his own ideal. We may add that
-P-A-G-E-120
  IIo SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
this is just as true of the Bible as of Homer. The 
biblical narrative, too, depicts a few essential traits of 
human nature, and refrains from multiplying minor 
traits which might interfere with the main effect. 
The Bible, too, draws its figures in outline, and leaves 
every age free to fill them in so as to satisfy its own 
ideal.” 
Moreover, their use is not a matter of experiment. 
For hundreds of years they have held the first place 
in the best homes and schools of Germany, England, 
and America, and their educative influence has been 
profoundly felt in all Christian nations. 
We have several editions of the stories adapted 
from the Bible for school use. In the Bible itself 
they are not found in the simple, connected form that 
makes them available for school use. One of the 
best editions for school is that published by Houghton, 
Mifflin, & Co., called, “Old Testament Stories in 
Scriptural Language.” A free and somewhat origi- 
nal rendering of the stories is given by Baldwin in 
his “Old Stories of the East,” published by the 
American Book Co. Both of these books have been 
extensively used in the schools of this country. The 
oral treatment of the Bible stories in the schools has 
not been common in this country, but it has all the 
merits described by us in the chapter on oral instruc- 
tion. In fourth and fifth grades these books may 
serve well for exercises in reading. 
In a great many schools of this country they can
-P-A-G-E-121
  THIRD GRADE STORIES lil 
be used and are used without giving offence to any- 
body, and where this is true, they well deserve recog- 
nition in our school course because of their superior 
presentation of some of the great universal ideas of 
our civilization.

  CHAPTER VI 
METHOD IN Primary READING 
Tue problem of primary reading is one of the most 
complex and difficult in the whole range of school 
instruction. A large proportion of the finest skill 
and sympathy of teachers has been expended in 
efforts to find the appropriate and natural method of 
teaching children to read. All sorts of methods and 
devices have been employed, from the most formal 
and mechanical to the most spirited and realistic. 
The first requisite to good reading is something 
é,worth reading, something valuable and interesting to 
the children, and adapted to their minds. We must 
take it for granted in this discussion that the best 
literature and the best stories have been selected, and 
what the teacher has to do is, first, to appreciate 
these masterpieces for herself, and second, to bring 
the children in the reading lessons to appreciate 
and enjoy them. In the primary grades we are not 
so richly supplied with available materials from good 
literature as in intermediate and grammar grades. 
This is due not to difficulty in thought, but to the 
unfamiliar written and printed forms. The great 
problem in primary reading is to master these strange 
forms as quickly as possible, and find entrance to the 
112 
 
-P-A-G-E-123
METHOD IN PRIMARY READING 113 
story-land of books. For several years, however, pri- 
mary teachers have been selecting and adapting 
the best stories, and some of the leading publishers 
have brought out in choice school-book form books 
which are well adapted to the reading of primary 
grades. 
We should like to assume one other advantage. 
If the children have been treated orally to “ Robinson 
Crusoe” in the second grade, they will appreciate and 
read the story much better in the third grade. If 
some of Grimm’s stories are told in first grade, they 
can be read with ease in the second grade. Thes— 
teacher’s oral presentation of the stories is the right 
way to bring them close to the life and interest of 
children. /In the first grade, as shown in the chapter 
on oral lessons, it is the only way, because the chil- 
dren cannot yet read. But even if they could read, the 
oral treatment is much better. The oral presentation@—~ 
is more lively, natural, and realistic. The teacher 
can adapt the story and the language to the im- 
mediate needs of the class as no author can. She 
can question, or suggest lines of thought, or call up 
ideas from the children’s experience. The oral man- 
ner is the true way to let the children delve into the 
rich culture-content of stories and to awaken a taste 
for their beauty and truth. We could well wish that 
before children read mythical stories in fourth grade, 
they had been stirred up to enjoy them by oral narra- 
tion and discussion in the preceding year. In the ; :
-P-A-G-E-124
  II4 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
same way, if the reading bears on interesting science 
topics previously studied, it will be a distinct advan- 
tage to the reading lesson. Children like to read 
about things that have previously excited their inter- 
est, whether in story or science. The difficulties of 
formal reading will also be partly overcome by famili- 
arity with the harder names and words. Our con- 
clusion is that reading lessons, alone, cannot provide 
all the conditions favorable to good reading. Some 
of these can be well supplied by other studies or by 
preliminary lessons which pave the way for the read- 
ing proper. This matter has been so fully discussed 
in the earlier chapters on oral work that it requires 
no further treatment here. 
FOLK-LORE STORIES AS READING EXERCISES FOR 
FIRST GRADE 
Let it be supposed that a class of first-grade chil- 
dren has learned to tell a certain story orally. It has 
interested them and stirred up their thought. 
Let them next learn to read the same story in 
a very simple form. This will lead to a series of 
elementary reading lessons in connection with the 
story, and the aim should be strictly that of master- 
ing the early difficulties of reading. The teacher 
recalls the story, and asks for a statement from its 
beginning. If the sentence furnished by the child is 
simple and suitable, the teacher writes it on the black- 
board in plain large script. Each child reads it
-P-A-G-E-125
  METHOD IN PRIMARY READING II5. 
through and points out the words. Let there be a 
lively drill upon the sentence till the picture of each 
word becomes clear and distinct. During the first 
lesson, two or three short sentences can be handled 
with success. As new words are learned, they should 
be mixed up on the board with those learned before, 
and a quick and varied drill on the words in sentences 
or in columns be employed to establish the forms in 
memory.! Speed, variety in device, and watchfulness 
to keep all busy and attentive are necessary to secure 
good results. 
After a few lessons one or two of the simpler 
words may be taken for phonetic analysis. The 
simple sounds are associated with the letters that 
represent them. These familiar letters are later met 
and identified in new words, and, as soon as a 
number of sounds with their symbols have been 
learned, new words can be constructed and pro- 
nounced from these known elements. 
The self-activity of the children in recognizing the 
elementary sounds, already met, in new words as fast 
as they come up, is one of the chief merits of this 
early study of words. They thus early learn the 
power of self-help and of confident reliance upon 
themselves in acquiring and using knowledge. The 
chief difficulty is in telling which sound to use, as a 
letter often has several sounds (as a, ¢, 5, ¢, etc.). But 
1 First-class primary teachers claim that drills are unnecessary if the 
teacher is skilful in recombining the old words in new sentences.
-P-A-G-E-126
} 116 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING “d , 
¥ the children are capable of testing the known sounds 
of a letter upon a new word, and in most cases, of 
deciding which to use. The thoughtless habit of 
pronouncing every new word for a child, without 
effort on his part, checks and spoils his interest and | 
self-activity. It does not seem necessary to use an 
extensive system of diacritical markings to guide him 
in these efforts to discriminate sounds. It is better 
to use the marks as Nttle as possible and learn to 
interpret words as they usually appear in print. 
4 Experience has shown decisively that a lively and 
vigorous self-activity is manifested by such. early 
efforts in learning to read. tr It is one of the most 
encouraging signs in education to see little children 
in their first efforts to master the formal art of read- 
ing, showing this spirited self-reliant energy. 
In the same way, they recognize old words in 
sentences and new or changed combinations of old 
forms, and begin to read new sentences which com- 
~ bine old words in new relations. 
In ‘short, the sentence, word, and phonic methods 
are all used in fitting alternation, while originality and 
* variety of device are necessary in the best exercise of 
teaching power. 
The processes of learning to read by such board- 
script work are partly analytic and partly synthetic. 
Children begin with sentences, analyze them into 
words, and some of the words into their simple 
sounds. But when these sounds begin to grow
-P-A-G-E-127
METHOD IN PRIMARY READING 117 
familiar, they are identified again in other words, 
thus combining them into new forms. In the same 
way, words once learned by the analytic study of 
sentences are recognized again in new sentences, and 
thus interpreted in new relations. 
_ The short sentences, derived from a familiar story, 
when ranged together supply a brief, simple outline 
of the story. If now this series of sentences be 
written on the board or printed on slips of paper, 
the whole story may be reviewed by the class from 
day to day till the word and sentence forms are well 
mastered. For making these printed slips, some 
teachers use a small printing-press, or a typewriter. 
Eventually several stories may be collected and 
sewed together, so as to form a little reading-book 
which is the result of the constructive work of 
teacher and pupils. 
The reading lessons just described are entirely 
separate from the oral treatment and reproduction of 
the stories; yet the thought and interest awakened 
in the oral work are helpful in keeping up a lively 
effort in the reading class. The thought material in 
a good story is itself a mental stimulus, and produces 
a wakefulness which is favorable to imprinting the 
forms as well as the content of thought. Expression, 
also, that is, natural and vivid rendering of the 
thought, is always aimed at in reading, and springs 
spontaneously from interesting thought studies. 
Many teachers use the materials furnished by oral +
-P-A-G-E-128
  118 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
lessons in natural science as a similar introduction to 
reading in first grade. The science lessons furnish 
good thought matter for simple sentences, and there 
is good reason why, in learning to read, children 
should use sentences drawn both from literature and 
from natural science. 
READING IN THE SECOND GRADE 
The oral lessons in good stories, and the later 
board-use of these materials in learning the elements 
of formal reading, are an excellent preparation for 
the fuller and more extended reading of similar 
matter in the second and third grades. 
When the oral work of the first grade has thus 
kindled the fancy of a child upon these charming 
pictures, and the later board-work has acquainted 
him with letter and word symbols which express such 
thought, the reading of the same and other stories of 
like character (a year later) will follow as an easy 
and natural sequence. As a preliminary to all good 
reading exercises, there should be rich and fruitful 
thought adapted to the age of children. The realm 
of classic folk-lore contains abundant thought mate- 
rial peculiar in its fitness to awaken the interest and 
fancy of children in the first two grades. To bring 
these choice stories close to the hearts of children 
should be the aim of much of the work in both these 
grades. Such an aim, skilfully carried out, ndt only 
conduces to the joy of children in first grade, but
-P-A-G-E-129
  METHOD IN PRIMARY READING 119 
infuses the reading lessons of second grade with 
thought and culture of the best quality. 
’ Interest and vigor of thought are certain to help 
right expression and reading. Reading, like every 
other study, should be based upon realities. When 
there is real thought and feeling in the children, a 
correct expression of them is more easily secured 
than by formal demands or by intimidation. 
The stories to be read in second or third grade 
may be fuller and longer than the brief outline sen- 
tences used for board-work in the first grade. 
Besides, these tales, being classic and of permanent 
value, do not lose their charm by repetition. 
> METHOD 
By oral reading, we mean the giving of the 
thought obtained from a printed page to others 
through the medium of the voice. -¢ 
There is first the training of the eye in taking in a 
number of words at a glance —a mechanical process; 
then the interpretation of these groups of words — 
a mental,process ; next the making known of the 
ideas thus obtained to others, by means of the voice 
—also a mechanical process. 
The children need special help in each step. We 
are apt to overdo one at the expense of the others. 
1. Eye-training is the foundation of all good read- 
ing. _ Various devices are resorted to in obtaining it. 
We-will suggest a few, not new at all, but useful.
-P-A-G-E-130
    120 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
(a) A strip of cardboard, on which is a clause ot 
sentence, is held before the class, for a moment only, 
and then removed. The length of the task is in- 
creased as the eye becomes trained to this kind of 
work. 
(4) The children open their books at a signal from 
the teacher, glance through a line, or part of one, 
indicated by the teacher, close book at once and give 
the line. 
(c) The teacher places on the board clauses or 
sentences bearing on the lesson, and covers with a 
map. The map is rolled up to show one of these, 
which is almost immediately erased. The children 
are then asked to give it. The map is then rolled 
up higher, exposing another, which also is speedily 
erased —and so on until all have been given to the 
children and erased. 
2. The child needs not only to be able to recognize 
groups of words, but he must be able to get thought 
from them. The following are some devices to that 
end :— 
(a) Suggestive pictures can be made use of to 
advantage all through the primary grades. If the 
child reads part of the story in the picture, and finds 
it interesting, he will want to read from the printed 
page the part not given in the picture. 
(6) Where there is no picture—or even where 
there is one — an aim may be useful to arouse interest 
in the thought, ze. a thoughtful question may be put
-P-A-G-E-131
  METHOD IN PRIMARY READING 121 
by the teacher, which the children can answer only 
by reading the story; eg. in the supplementary 
reader, ‘Easy Steps for Little Feet,” is found the 
story of “The Pin and Needle.” There is no picture. 
The teacher says, as the class are seated: “ Now we 
have a story about a big quarrel between a pin and a 
needle over the question, ‘Which one is the better 
fellow?’ Of what could the needle boast? Of what 
the pin? Let us see which won.” 
(c) Let all the pupils look through one or more 
paragraphs, reading silently, to get the thought, 
before any one is called upon to read aloud. If a 
child comes to a word that he does not know, during 
the silent reading, the teacher helps him to get it— 
from the context if possible—if not, by the sounds 
of the letters which compose it. 
As each child finishes the task assigned, he raises 
his eyes from the book, showing by this act that he 
is ready to tell what he has just read. The thought 
may be given by the child in his own language to 
assure the teacher that he has it. Usually, however, 
in the lower grades, this is unnecessary, the language 
of the book being nearly as simple as his own. 
The advantage of having all the pupils kept busy, 
instead of one alone who might be called upon to 
read the paragraph, is evident. Every child reads 
silently all of the lesson. Time would not permit 
that this be done orally, were it advisable to do so. 
When the child gets up to read, he is not likely to
-P-A-G-E-132
  122 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
stumble, for he has both the thought and the expres- 
sion for it, at the start. 
While aiming to have the children comprehend the 
thought, the teacher should not forget, on the other 
hand, that this is the reading hour, and not the time 
for much oral instruction and reproduction. There 
are other recitations in which the child is trained to 
free oral expression of thought, as in science and 
literature. Such offhand oral expression of his own 
ideas is not the primary aim of the reading lesson. 
Its purpose is to lend life to the recitation. 
3. Steps 1 and 2 deal with preparation for the read- 
ing. Up to this time, no oral reading has been done. 
Now we are ready to begin. 
Children will generally express the thought with 
the proper emphasis if they not only see its meaning 
but also feel it. Suppose the children are interested 
in the thought of the piece, they still fail, sometimes, 
to give the proper emphasis. How can the teacher, 
by questioning, get them to realize the more important 
part of the thought? 
(a) The teacher has gone deeper into the mean- 
ing than have the children. Her questions should 
be such as to make real to the children the more 
emphatic part of the thought; ¢.g. in the Riverside 
Primer we have, “ Poor Bun, good dog, did you think 
I meant to hit you?” John reads, “ Do you think I 
meant to zt you?” The teacher says, “I will be 
Bun, John. What is it that you do not want Bun to
-P-A-G-E-133
METHOD IN PRIMARY READING 123 
think?” (“That I meant to hit him.”) “But you 
did mean to hit something. What was it you did not 
mean to hit? Tell Bun.” (‘I did not mean to hit 
you.”) Now ask him if he thought that you did. 
(“Did you think I meant to hit you ?”’) 
(4) When the story is in the form of a dialogue, 
the children may personate the characters in the 
story. Thus, getting into the real spirit of the piece, 
their emphasis will naturally fall where it properly 
belongs. 
(c) Sometimes the teacher will find it necessary to 
show the child how to read a passage properly, by 
reading it himself. It is seldom best to do this— 
certainly not if the correct expression can be reached 
through questioning. 
Many a teacher makes a practice of giving the 
proper emphasis to the child, he copying it from her 
voice. Frequently, children taught in this way can 
read one piece after another in their readers with 
excellent expression, but, when questioned, show that 
their minds are a blank as to the meaning of what | 
they are reading. 
In working for expression, a great many teachers 
waste the time and energy of the pupils by indefinite 
directions. The emphasis is not correctly placed, so 
the teacher says, “I do not like that; try it again, 
May.” Now, May has no idea in what particular she 
has failed, so she gives it again, very likely as she 
gave it before, or she may put the emphasis on some  
-P-A-G-E-134
    124 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
other word, hoping by so doing to please the teacher. 
“Why, no, May, you surely can do better than that,” 
says the teacher. So May makes another fruitless 
attempt, when the teacher, disgusted, calls on another 
pupil to show her how to read. May has gained no 
clearer insight into the thought than she started out 
with, no power to grapple more successfully with a 
similar difficulty another time, and has lost, partly 
at least, her interest in the piece. She has been 
bothered and discouraged, and the class wearied. 
Sometimes when the expression is otherwise good, 
the children pitch their voices too high or too low. 
Natural tones must be insisted upon. A goodaid to 
the children in this respect is the habitual example of 
quiet, clear tones in the teacher. 
Another fault of otherwise good reading is a fail- 
ure to enunciate distinctly. Children are inclined to 
slight many sounds, especially at the end of the 
words, and the teacher is apt to think : “ That doesn’t 
make so very much difference, since they are only 
children. When they are older they will see that 
their pronunciation is babyish, and adopt a correct 
form.” This is unsound reasoning. Every time the 
child says /as for /ast¢ he is establishing more firmly 
a habit, to overcome which will give him much 
difficulty. 
In the pronunciation of words as well as in the 
reading of a sentence, much time is wasted through 
failure to point out the exact word, and the syllable
-P-A-G-E-135
  METHOD IN PRIMARY READING 125 
in the word, in which the mistake has been made. 
The child cannot improve unless-he knows-in- what 
particular there is room for improvement. 
Children in primary grades should be supplied with 
a good variety of primers, readers, and simple story 
books. In the course of their work they should read 
through a number of first, second, and third readers. 
Much of this reading should be simple and easy, so 
that they can move rapidly through a book, and gain 
confidence and satisfaction from it. In each grade 
there should be several sets of readers, which can be 
turned to as the occasion may demand. It is much 
better to read a new reader, involving in the main the 
same vocabulary, than to reread an old book. This 
use of several books in each grade adds to the interest 
and reduces to a minimum the mere drills, which are 
to be avoided as much as possible. 
SUMMARY 
1. Let children read under the impulse of strong 
and interesting thought. 
(a) The previous oral treatment of the stories 
now used as reading lessons will help this thought 
impulse. 
(4) An aim concretely stated, and touching an inter- 
esting thought in the lesson, will give impetus to the 
work. 
(c) Let children pass judgment on the truth, worth, 
or beauty of what they read.
-P-A-G-E-136
126 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING ! 
(@) Clear mental pictures of people, actions, places, 
etc., conduce to vigor of thought. To this end the 
teacher should use good pictures, make sketches, and 
give descriptions or explanations. Children should 
also be allowed to sketch freely at the board. 
2. Children should be encouraged constantly to 
help themselves in interpreting new words and sen- 
tences in reading. 
(a) By looking through the new sentence and mak- 
ing it out, if possible, for themselves before any one 
reads it aloud. 
(4) By analyzing a new word into its sounds, and 
then combining them to get its pronunciation. 
(c) By interpreting a new word from its context, or 
by the first sound or syllable. 
(d@) By using the new powers of the letters as fast 
as they are learned in interpreting new words. 
(e) By trying the different sounds of a letter to a 
new word to see which seems to fit best. 
(f) By recognizing familiar words in new sentences 
with a different context. 
(g) See that every child reads the sentences in the 
new lesson for himself. 
3. There should be a gradual introduction to the 
elementary sounds (powers of the letters). 
The first words analyzed should be simple and 
phonetic in spelling, as dog, hen, cat, etc. 
New sounds of letters are taught as the children 
need them in studying out new words.
-P-A-G-E-137
  METHOD IN PRIMARY READING 127 
Very little attention needs to be given to learning 
the names of the letters. 
There need be little use of diacritical markings in 
early reading. 
4. Many of the new words will occur in connection 
with the picture at the head of the lesson. Place 
these on the board as they come up. 
if the teacher will weave these-words into her conver- 
sation, they will give the children little future trouble. 
5. All the different phases of the phonic, word, and 
sentence method should be woven together by a skil- 
ful teacher. 
6. The close attention of all the members of the 
class, so that each reads through the whole lesson, 
should be an ever-present aim of the teacher. 
7. Children should be anes to grasp several 
words at a glance :—- 
(a) By quick writing and erasure of words and 
sentences at the board. 
(4) By exposing for an instant sentences covered 
by a screen. 
(c) By the use of phrases or short sentences on 
cardboard. 
(d@) By questions for group thought. 
These tests should increase in difficulty with grow- 
ing skill. 
8. Spend but little time in the oral reproduction of 
stories. Practice in good reading and interpretation 
is the main thing.
-P-A-G-E-138
  128 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
9. Children, from the first, should be encouraged 
to articulate distinctly in oral reading. Let the 
teacher begin at home. 
10. Let the teacher cultivate a pleasing tone of 
voice, not loud or harsh. This will help the children 
to the same. 
11. Vigorous and forcible expression is secured : — 
(a) By having interesting stories. 
(4) By apt questions to bring out the emphatic 
thought. 
(c) By dramatizing the scenes of the story. 
(d@) By occasional examples of lively reading by 
the teacher. : 
(e) By definiteness in questioning.

CHAPTER VII 
EXERCISES AND LESSONS 
Based on School Movements, Studies, and Games 
In order to bring reading exercises into close con- 
nection with child interests and activities, the board 
work should make use of the opportunities offered 
by the ordinary movements and games of the school. 
The following lessons illustrate this plan. 
It is assumed that the more closely the written or 
printed words and sentences are related to the chil- 
dren’s activities, or the more dependent these activi- 
ties are made upon a knowledge of the word-forms, 
the quicker and more natural will be their mastery. 
To put it briefly, the teacher abstains from the use of 
oral speech to a considerable extent and substitutes 
the written forms of the words on the blackboard in 
giving directions, in games, and in treating topics 
in literature and science. The following chapter is 
taken wholly from the lessons given by Mrs. Lida B. 
McMurry in the first grade. Many other similar 
lessons were worked out, but these are probably 
sufficient fully to illustrate the plan. 
K 129
-P-A-G-E-140
  130 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
The teacher’s aim in the beginning reading is to 
lead the child to look to the lesson, either word or 
sentence or paragraph, to find what it has to say to 
him— to present the lesson in such a way that the 
child shall quicken into life in its presence — shall 
reach forward to grasp this much-desired thing. The 
attention of the child is centred on the thought; he 
grasps the symbols because he must reach, through 
them, the thought. 
Much of the early reading can be taught in a 
purely incidental way —in the general exercises of 
the school and in the literature and nature-study 
recitations. 
READING TAUGHT INCIDENTALLY 
(a) In the General Management of the School. The 
directions which are at first given to children orally, 
e.g., vise, turn, pass, sit, skip, fly, march, run, walk, 
pass to the front, pass to the back, are later written 
upon the board. When the children seem to have 
become familiar with the written direction, the 
order in which the directions are given is some- 
times changed, as a test, e.g., the following direc- 
tions are usually given in this order—7curn, rise, pass. 
Instead of writing ¢wrz first, the teacher writes pass. 
If the children understand, they will rise at once and 
pass without waiting to turn. 
The names of the children, instead of being spoken, 
are often written; in this way the children become
-P-A-G-E-141
EXERCISES AND LESSONS 131 
familiar with the names of all the children in the 
school. The teacher, writing Clarence upon the board, 
says, “I would like this boy to erase the boards 
to-night.” The first time it is written the teacher 
speaks the name as she writes it. It may be neces- 
sary to do this several times. The teacher does not 
look at Clarence as she writes his name. If he does 
not recognize his name after it has appeared repeat- 
edly, his eyesight may well be tested. If heedless- 
ness is the cause of the failure, another name is 
written at the board, and Clarence loses the opportu- 
nity to do the service. No drill should be given on 
these names. The repetition incident to the frequent 
calling upon the child is all that is necessary to fix 
the name. 
The names of the songs and of the poems which 
the children are memorizing are written upon the 
board as needed. The teacher says, “We will sing 
this song this morning.” If the children do not 
recognize its title as the teacher points to it, she 
gives it. After a while the children will recognize 
the names of all the songs and the poems which 
are in use in the room. 
The children become familiar with the written 
form of the smaller numbers in this way —the 
number of absent children is reported at each 
session and written on the board. On Friday the 
teacher records upon the board some facts of the 
week, or of the month, which the children learned
-P-A-G-E-142
132 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
from their weather charts—viz., the number of 
sunny and the number of cloudy days. The number 
of children in each row is ascertained and written at 
the board that the monitors may know how many 
pairs of scissors, pieces of clay, or pencils to select. 
The poems, after being partially committed to 
memory, are written upon the board; when the 
pupils falter, referente is made to the line in ques- 
tion as it appears upon the board. 
The teacher sometimes writes her morning greet- 
ing or evening farewell at the board —thus: ‘ Good 
morning, children,” or, “Good-by for to-day.” The 
children read silently and respond with, “Good morn- 
ing, Miss Eades,” or, ‘ Good night, Miss Farr.” 
Often she communicates facts of interest at the 
board. If the pupils are unable to interpret what 
she has written, she reads for them, eg., the teacher 
writes, ‘We have vacation to-morrow.” Quite likely 
some child, unable to read at all, will say, ‘‘We have 
something, but I can’t tell what it is.” (These same 
words will occur again, when needed to express a 
thought, and it is a waste of energy to drill upon 
them.) When the children have interpreted the 
above sentence at the board, the teacher writes, ‘ Do 
you know why?” The children read the question 
silently and give the answer audibly, and say, “ It is 
Decoration Day.” We too often allow children to 
treat a question in their reading as if its end were 
reached in the asking. To lead the children to form
-P-A-G-E-143
EXERCISES AND LESSONS 133 
a habit of answering questions asked in writing or in 
print, such questions as the following are, from time 
to time, written at the board: “ Did you see the rain- 
bow last night?” ‘What color wasit?” “Did you 
see any birds on Saturday?” “What ones?” “Have 
you been to the woods?” “What did you find there?” 
(b) Ln Connection with the Literature. The name 
of the story which the teacher is about to tell is 
placed upon the board. At the first writing the 
teacher tells the pupils what it is, if necessary, e¢.g., 
the teacher says, “We shall have a story about ‘Zhe 
Three Bears,” pointing to the title upon the board. 
The next day she says, “I would like you to tell me 
all you can about this story” — writing its name upon 
the board. 
In the final reproduction of the story the teacher 
assigns topics, ¢g.: Chauncey may tell me about 
this (writing at the board): Silver-Hair going to 
the woods. Eva may tell about this: Sz/ver-Hair 
going into the kitchen. Jennie may tell about this: 
Silver-Hair going into the sitting room. Willie may 
tell about this: Silver-Hair going upstairs. Should 
the child go beyond the limited topic, the teacher 
points to the board and asks about what he was to 
tell. 
At the close of each story that can be dramatized, 
the teacher assigns at the board the part which each 
is to take, thus: After the story of “The Old Woman 
and the Pig” is learned, the teacher writes in a col.
-P-A-G-E-144
  134 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
umn each child’s name opposite the animal or thing 
which he is to represent, in this way. 
Agnes —the old woman. 
Glenn — the pig. 
Sadie — the dog, etc. 
(c) Jn Connection with the Nature Study. In the 
spring the children are looking for the return of the 
birds, the first spring blossoms, and the opening of 
the tree buds. The teacher often makes her own dis- 
coveries known through writing, upon the board, e.¢., 
“T saw a robin this morning,” or “I found a blue 
violet yesterday,” or ““I saw some elm blossoms last 
night.” 
The class, by the aid of the teacher, makes a bird, 
a flower, and a tree-bud calendar, on which are re- 
corded the name and date of the first seen of each. 
These names are put on the calendars in the presence 
of the children, and they frequently “name their 
treasures o’er.” 
The mode of travelling is written beside the name 
of each familiar bird as the children make the dis- 
coveries, thus : — 
hops. 
Robin | runs. Crow ene , flies. flies. 
Questions arise during the recitation which the 
children will answer later from observation. That 
the children may not forget them they are placed 
high up on the board where they can be preserved.
-P-A-G-E-145
  EXERCISES AND LESSONS 135 
Frequent reference is made to them to see if the 
pupils are prepared to answer them. When a ques- 
tion is answered it is erased, making room for another. 
THE READING RECITATION 
For the early reading, Games, Literature, and 
Nature Study may form the basis. 
(1) Games as a Basis for the Reading. The child 
enters school from a life of play. It is our purpose, 
so far as possible, to make use of this natural bent of 
the child to insure interest in his reading, as well as 
to give him the free exercise, which he needs, of his 
muscles. It may be urged as an argument against the 
use of the games, that they are too noisy and attract 
the attention of the children who are busy at their 
seats. Often it would be a good thing for these chil- 
dren to watch the younger ones at their games. It 
would rest them and put them into closer sympathy 
with the little ones. In a short time they will not 
care so much to watch them. The little children 
should be thoughtful of the older ones and move about 
as quietly as is possible. 
The following are some of the games which we have 
used in our primary school. They are given in the 
way of suggestion only. They are played at first by 
following spoken directions. When the children are 
perfectly familiar with the oral direction, the written 
direction is gradually substituted. The children do 
not stay long enough on one game to become tired of 
 
-P-A-G-E-146
136 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
it. Two or three or even more are played at a single 
recitation. It is not the plan to drill the pupils upon 
the written directions, but by frequent repetitions to 
familiarize them with them. The games are most 
suitable for the very earliest reading lessons. The 
plan for teaching one of them, the first one given 
here, will be written out quite fully. The others will 
be given with less detail. 
THE RING GAME 
Material. — Six celluloid rings, red, white, blue, yel- 
low, green, and black. Surcingle rings can be painted 
the colors desired. 
Directions. — Take the red ring, Jennie. 
Take the blue ring, Eva. 
Take the yellow ring, Wallace. 
Take the green ring, Chauncey. 
Take the black ring, Gregory. 
Take the white ring, Lloyd. 
When the children are ready to hide the rings this 
direction is given to the remainder of the class : — 
Close your eyes. 
This to the pupils who hold the rings : — 
Hide the rings. 
When the children have all the rings hid they an- 
nounce it by lightly clapping their hands, upon which
-P-A-G-E-147
  EXERCISES AND LESSONS 137 
the children open their eyes. Directions are then 
given to those who did not hide rings, for finding the 
rings, e.g. ¢ — 
Find the red ring. 
Find the blue ring, etc. 
No notice is taken of any ring but the one called 
for. A limited time is given for the finding of each. 
At the close of that time, if the ring is not discovered, 
the one who hid it gets it. When the written direc- 
tions are first used the whole sentence need not be 
put upon the board, ¢.g., the teacher need write only — 
the red ving. She says to the child, “find ¢hzs” — 
pointing to the board; or ved, alone, may be written, 
in which case the teacher points to the word, saying, 
“You may find this ring.’ There is considerable 
rivalry to see who will find the most rings. 
When the children seem to know the written di- 
rections perfectly, a test is made of their ability, 
actually, to read them; thus, instead of writing, 
“ Take the red ring,” the teacher writes, “zd the 
red ring.” She writes “Hide the rings,” before she 
writes, “Close your eyes.” If the children recog- 
nize what is written they will set the teacher right. 
BALL AND CORD 
Material. — Small, soft rubber balls with short rub- 
ber cords attached. The cords have a loop for the 
finger.

In this and succeeding games it is left to the dis- 
cretion of the teacher as to when the written direc- 
tions shall be introduced. 
BALL GAME 
Material. — A soft rubber ball. 
Form a circle. 
Take the ball, Roy. 
Toss the ball. 
Roll the ball. 
Bounce the ball. 
Throw the ball. 
Give the ball to Sadie. 
In this game one of the children takes the ball to 
the circle. Each, as the ball is tossed to him, tosses 
it to another. At the direction of the teacher the 
game of tossing the ball is changed to one of rolling 
 
-P-A-G-E-149
EXERCISES AND LESSONS 139 
the ball, the pupils squatting on the floor; this in 
turn is changed later as the directions indicate. 
Care must be taken that-all children are treated 
alike in this game. The children themselves will 
look out for this if properly directed at the outset 
of the game. 
HUNTING THE VIOLET 
Material. — Violets scattered about the room. 
Find a blue violet, Glenn. 
Find a violet bud, Edith. 
Find a yellow violet, Lloyd. 
Find a violet leaf, Sadie. 
Find a white violet, Jennie. 
Find a purple violet, Rudolph. 
Sing to the violets. 
Children sing softly : — 
“Oh, violets, pretty violets, 
I pray you tell to me 
Why are you the first flowers 
That bloom upon the lea?” etc. 
A TREE GAME — (SPRING OR FALL) 
Material. — Leaves of the different trees with which 
the children are familiar. 
Glenn may be a maple tree. 
Choose your leaf. 
Wallace may be an elm tree, 
Choose your leaf. 
 
-P-A-G-E-150

Chauncey may be a birch tree. 
Choose your leaf, ete. 
Make a little forest. 
Toss in the wind. 
(The leaves are pinned upon the children as each 
_ chooses his leaf, and they dance lightly about as if 
tossed by the wind.) 
CARING FOR THE ANIMALS 
Material. —Wooden or paper animals. A portion 
of the table is marked off by a chalk line for the 
farmyard. 
Drive in a pig, Willie. 
Lead in a horse, Gregory. 
Drive in a sheep, Sadie. 
Lead in a cow, Roy, etc. 
They are driven in at night, then driven out in the 
morning. Sometimes they are hurried in because of 
the approach of a storm. 
DOLL PLAY — (GENERAL) 
Material. — Penny dolls or larger ones. 
Take a doll. 
Rock the baby. 
Pat the baby. 
Sing the baby to sleep. 
Put the baby to bed.
-P-A-G-E-151
EXERCISES AND LESSONS 141 
Take up the baby. 
Wash its face. 
Comb its hair. 
Feed it bread and milk. 
Take it for a walk. 
At the direction, “Sing the baby to sleep,” the 
children sing very softly :— 
* Rock-a-bye-Baby,” — or some other lullaby. 
The bed is the chair on which the child is sitting. 
All stand and turn about together to put the 
babies to bed. They go through the movements 
only of washing the face and hands and combing 
the hair, and of feeding bread and milk. They per- 
form these acts in unison. 
THE RAINBOW FAIRIES — (SPRING) 
Material.— Large bows of tissue paper with 
streamers, of the various colors mentioned. 
Eva may be a yellow fairy. 
Roy may be a blue fairy. 
Edith may be a green fairy. 
Louise may be a red fairy. 
Lloyd may be an orange fairy. 
Sadie may be a violet fairy. 
The others may be trees. 
Join hands, fairies. 
Dance about the trees.

  142 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
As the first direction is given Eva steps to the 
table and takes a yellow bow which is pinned to 
her left shoulder: the others follow as called upon. 
THE LEAVES 
Material. — A leaf of one of several colors pinned 
on each child. The wind calls: — 
Come yellow leaf. 
Come red leaf. 
Come green leaves, etc. 
Dance in the wind. 
At the last direction the children fly over a 
small area, hither and thither; some one way, some 
another, passing and repassing one another, simulat- 
ing the leaves in a storm.

  CHAPTER VIII 
List oF Books FoR PRIMARY GRADES 
In selecting reading books for primary grades the 
purpose is to find those which will give the readiest 
mastery of the printed forms of speech. 
For this purpose books need to be well graded and 
interesting. Primary teachers have expended their 
utmost skill upon such simple, attractive, and inter- 
esting books for children. Pictorial illustration has 
added to the clearness and beauty of the books, so 
that, with the rivalry of many large publishing 
houses, we now have a great variety of good primary 
books to select from. 
The earliest and simplest of these are the primers, 
which, followed by the first readers, give the most 
necessary drills upon the forms of easy words and 
sentences. Great care has been taken to give an 
easy regular grading so as to let a child help himself 
as much as possible. But as soon as children, by 
blackboard exercises and by means of primers, 
have gained a mastery of the simpler words and the 
powers of the letters, the Mother Goose rhymes, the 
fables and fairy tales (already familiar to the children 
143 
vA 
7
-P-A-G-E-154
144 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
in oral work) are introduced into their reading books 
in the simplest possible forms. 
The use of interesting rhymes and stories in this eal 
reading is the only means of giving it a lively content 
and of thus securing interest and concentration of 
thought. Good primary teachers have been able in 
this way to relieve the reading lessons of their tedium, 
and, what is equally good, have strengthened the inter- 
est of the children in the best literature of childhood. 
Besides the choicest fables and fairy tales, many 
of the simpler nature myths and even such longer 
poems and stories as “ Hiawatha,” “ Robinson Cru- 
soe,” and “Ulysses” have been used with happy re- 
sults as reading books in the first three years. There 
are also certain collections of children’s poems, such 
as Stevenson’s “Child’s Garden of Verses,” Field’s 
“ Love-songs of Childhood,’ Sherman’s “ Little Folk 
Lyrics,” “Old Ballads in Prose,” “The Listening 
Child,” and others, which may suggest the beauty and 
variety of choice literary materials which are now 
easily within the reach of teachers and children in 
primary schools. 
There is no longer any doubt that little folk in 
primary classes may reap the full benefit of a close 
acquaintance with these favorite songs, stories, and 
poems, and that in the highest educative sense the 
effect is admirable. 
In the following list the books for each grade are 
arranged into three groups :—
-P-A-G-E-155
LIST OF BOOKS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 145 
First. A series of choicest books and those exten- 
sively used and well adapted for the grade as regular 
reading exercises. 
Second. A supplementary list of similar quality 
and excellence, but somewhat more difficult. 
They may, in some cases, serve as substitutes for 
those given in the first group. 
Third. A collection of books for teachers, partly 
similar in character to those mentioned in the two 
previous groups and partly of a much wider, profes- 
sional range in literature, history, and nature. Some 
books of child-study, psychology, and pedagogy are 
also included. The problems of the primary teacher 
are no longer limited to the small drills and exercises 
in spelling and reading, but comprehend many of the 
most interesting and far-reaching questions of educa- 
tion. It is well, therefore, for the primary teacher to 
become acquainted not only with the great works of 
literature but with the best professional books in 
education.

CHAPTER IX 
EpucaTIONAL VALUE OF LITERATURE 
Tue gradual introduction of the choicer products 
of literature into the grades of the common school 
has been going on for several years. Bringing the 
school children face to face with the thoughts of the 
masters has had often a thrilling effect, and the feel- 
ing has spread among teachers that a new door has 
been opened into what Ruskin calls “The King’s 
Gardens.’”’ As we stand at this open portal to the 
Elysian Fields of literature, there may fall upon us 
something of the beauty, something even of the 
solemn stillness, of the arched cathedral with its 
golden windows. But how inadequate is the Gothic 
cathedral, or the Greek temple, to symbolize the 
temple of literature. 
Within less than a score of years there has been 
such reading of varied literary masterpieces by chil- 
dren as to bring us face to face with a problem of 
prime significance in education, the place and im- 
portance of literature in the education of American 
children. 
152
-P-A-G-E-163
EDUCATIONAL VALUE OF LITERATURE 153 
Millions of children are introduced yearly to book- 
land, and it is a matter of greater importance than 
what Congress does, what provision is made for 
these oncoming millions in the sunlit fields and 
forest glades of literature, where the boys and girls 
walk in happy companionship with the “wisest and 
wittiest” of our race. We have now had enough 
experience with these treasures of culture to get a 
real foretaste of the feast prepared for the growing 
youth. We know that their appetites are keen and 
their digestive powers strong. It is incumbent upon 
educators to get a comprehensive survey of this land 
and to estimate its resources. Other fields of study, 
like naturai science, geography, music, etc., are 
undergoing the same scrutiny as to their educative 
value. Literature, certainly a peer in the hierarchy 
of great studies, if not supreme in value above others, 
is one of the most difficult to estimate. Tangible 
proofs of the vital culture-force of good literature 
upon growing minds can be given in many individual 
cases, But to what degree it has general or uni- 
versal fitness to awaken, strengthen, and refine all 
minds, is in dispute. 
It seems clear, at least, that only those who show 
taste and enthusiasm for a choice piece of literature 
can teach it with success. This requirement of ap- 
preciation and enjoyment of the study is more im- 
perative in literature, because its appeal is not merely 
to the intellect and the reason, as in other studies,
-P-A-G-E-164
154 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
but especially to the emotions and higher zsthetic 
judgments, to moral and religious sentiment in ideal 
representation. 
It has been often observed that discussions of the 
superior educative value of literature before bodies 
of teachers, while entertaining and delightful, fall far 
short of lasting results because of the teachers’ nar- 
row experience with literature. In the case of many 
teachers, the primitive alphabet of literary apprecia- 
tion is lacking, and the most enthusiastic appeals to 
the charm and exaltation of such studies fall harmless. 
Yet literature in the schools is hopeless without teach- 
ers who have felt at home in this delightsome land, 
this most real world of ideal strength and beauty. 
The discussion of the subject for teachers is beset, 
therefore, with peculiar and seemingly insurmount- 
able difficulties. The strength, charm, and refine- 
ment of literature are known only to those who 
have read the masters with delight, while even 
people of cultured taste listen doubtfully to the 
praise of authors they have never read. To one 
enamoured of the music of Tennyson’s songs, the 
very suggestion of “In Memoriam” awakens en- 
thusiasm. To one who has not read Tennyson and 
his like, silence on the subject is golden. To those 
not much travelled in the fields of literature, there 
is danger of speaking in an unknown tongue, while 
they, of all others, need a plain and convincing word. 
To speak this plain and convincing word to those
-P-A-G-E-165
EDUCATIONAL VALUE OF LITERATURE 155 
who may have acquired but little relish for literature, 
and that little only in the fragmentary selections of 
the school readers, is a high and difficult aim. But 
teachers are willing to learn, and to discover new 
sources of enthusiasm in their profession. It is 
probable, also, that the original capacity to enjoy 
great literature is much more common than is often 
supposed, and that the great average of teachers is 
quite capable of receiving this powerful stimulus. 
The fact is, our common schools have done so 
little, till of late, to cultivate this fine taste, that 
we have faint reason to expect it in our teachers. 
Overwhelmed as we are with the folly of indulg- 
ing in the praise of literature before mariy whose 
ears have been but poorly attuned to the sweet 
melody or majestic rhythm of the masters, we still 
make bold to grapple with this argument. There 
is surely no subject to which the teachers need more 
to open their eyes and ears and better nature, so as to 
take in the enrichment it affords. There is encour- 
agement in the fact that many teachers fully appre- 
ciate the worth of these writers, and have succeeded 
in making their works beautiful and educative to 
the children. Very many other teachers are capable 
of the full refreshing enjoyment of classic works, 
when their attention and labor are properly expended 
upon them. The colleges, universities, high schools, 
and normal schools have largely abandoned the dull 
epitomizing of literature, the talk about authors, for
-P-A-G-E-166
156 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
the study of the works themselves of the masters. 
The consequence is, that the study of literature in 
English is becoming an enthusiasm, and teachers 
of this type are multiplying. 
The deeper causes for this widespread lack of 
literary appreciation among the people, and even 
among teachers and scholars, is found partly in the 
practical, scientific, and utilitarian spirit of the age, 
and partly in the corresponding unliterary courses 
of study which have prevailed everywhere in our 
common schools. The absence of literary standards 
and taste among teachers is due largely to the 
failure of the schools themselves, hitherto, to cul- 
tivate this sort of proficiency. Those very qualities 
which give to literature its supreme excellence, its 
poetic beauty, its artistic finish and idealism, are 
among the highest fruits of culture, and are far 
more difficult of attainment than mere knowledge. 
It is no small thing to introduce the rarest and 
finest culture of the world into the common school, and 
thus propagate, in the broadest democratic fashion, 
that which is the peculiar, superior refinement of the 
choicest spirits of the world. If progress in this 
direction is slow, we may remember that the best 
ideals are slow of attainment. 
There is also an intangible quality in all first-class 
literature, which is not capable of exact description 
or demonstration. George Willis Cooke, in “ Poets 
and Problems” (pp. 31-32), says: —
-P-A-G-E-167
EDUCATIONAL VALUE OF LITERATURE 157 
“Poetry enters into those higher regions of ‘human 
experience concerning which no definite account can 
be given; where all words fail; about which all we 
know is to be obtained by hints, symbols, poetic 
figures, and imagings. Poetry is truer and more 
helpful than prose, because it penetrates those 
regions of feeling, beauty, and spiritual reality, 
where definitions have no place or justification. 
There would be no poetry if life were limited to 
what we can understand; nor would there be any 
religion. Indeed, the joy, the beauty, and the 
promise of life would all be gone if there were 
nothing which reaches beyond our powers of defini- 
tion. The mystery of existence makes the grandeur 
and worth of man’s nature, as it makes for him his 
poetry and his religion. Poetry suggests, hints, 
images forth, what is too wonderful, too transcen- 
dent, too near primal reality, too full of life, beauty, 
and joy, for explanation or comprehension. It 
embodies man’s longing after the Eternal One, 
expresses his sense of the deep mystery of Being, 
voices his soul sorrow, illumines his path with hope 
and objects of beauty. Man’s aspiration, his sense 
of imperfection, his yearning for a sustaining truth 
and reality, as the life within and over all things, 
find expression in poetry; because it offers the 
fittest medium of interpretation for these higher 
movements of soul. Whenever the soul feels deeply, 
or is stirred by a great thought, the poetic form of 
 
-P-A-G-E-168
  158 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
utterance at once becomes the most natural and 
desirable for its loving and faithful interpretation.” 
This intangible excellence of superior literature, 
which defies all exact measurement by the yard- 
stick, puzzles the practical man and the scientist. 
There is no way of getting at it with their tools 
and measurements. They are very apt to give it 
up in disgust and dismiss it with some uncompli- 
mentary name. But Shakespeare’s mild reign con- 
tinues, and old Homer sings his deathless song to 
those who wish to hear. i 
Teachers need both the exact methods of science 
and the spiritual life of the poets, and we may well 
spend some pains in finding out the life-giving prop- 
erties of good literature. 
Lowell, in his “ Books and Libraries,” says : — 
“To wash down the drier morsels that every 
library must necessarily offer at its board, let there 
be plenty of imaginative literature, and let its range 
be not too narrow to stretch from Dante to the elder 
Dumas. The world of the imagination is not the 
world of abstraction and nonentity, as some conceive, 
but a world formed out of chaos by a sense of the 
beauty that is in man and the earth on which he 
dwells. It is the realm of Might-be, our haven of 
refuge from the shortcomings and disillusions of life. 
It is, to quote Spenser, who knew it well, — 
“«The world’s sweet inn from care and wearisome 
turmoil.’ Do we believe, then, that God gave us in
-P-A-G-E-169
EDUCATIONAL VALUE OF LITERATURE 159 
mockery this splendid faculty of sympathy with 
things that are a joy forever? For my part, I 
believe that the love and study of works of imagina- 
tion is of practical utility in a country so profoundly 
material (or, as we like to call it, practical) in its 
leading tendencies as ours. The hunger after purely 
intellectual delights, the content with ideal posses- 
sions, cannot but be good for us in maintaining a 
wholesome balance of the character and of the fac- 
ulties. I for one shall never be persuaded that 
Shakespeare left a less useful legacy to his country- 
men than Watt. We hold all the deepest, all the 
highest, satisfactions of life as tenants of imagination. 
Nature will keep up the supply of what are called 
hard-headed people without our help, and, if it come 
to that, there are other as good uses for heads as at 
the end of battering-rams.” 
“But have you ever rightly considered what the 
mere ability to read means? That it is the key which 
admits us to the whole world of thought and fancy 
and imagination ? to the company of saint and sage, 
of the wisest and wittiest at their wisest and wittiest 
moments? That it enables us to see with the keen- 
est eyes, hear with the finest ears, and listen to the 
sweetest voices of all time? More than that, it 
annihilates time and space for us; it revives for us 
without a miracle the Age of Wonder, endowing us 
with the shoes of swiftness and the cap of darkness, 
so that we walk invisible like fern-seed, and witness
-P-A-G-E-170

unharmed the plague at Athens or Florence or 
London ; accompany Cesar on his marches, or look 
in on Catiline in council with his fellow-conspirators, 
or Guy Fawkes in the cellar of St. Stephen’s. We 
often hear of people who will descend to any servil- 
ity, submit to any insult, for the sake of getting them- 
selves or their children into what is euphemistically 
called good society. Did it ever occur to them that 
there is a select society of all the centuries to which 
they and theirs can be admitted for the asking, a 
society, too, which will not involve them in ruinous 
expense, and still more ruinous waste of time and 
health and faculties ? 
“The riches of scholarship, the benignities of lit- 
erature, defy fortune and outlive calamity. They 
are beyond the reach of thief or moth or rust. As 
they cannot be inherited, so they cannot be alienated. 
But they may be shared, they may be distributed.” 
This notion of the select companionship of books 
finds also happy expression in Ruskin’s “Sesame 
and Lilies”: — 
“We may intrude ten minutes’ talk on a cabinet 
minister, answered probably with words worse than 
silence, being deceptive ; or snatch, once or twice in 
our lives, the privilege of throwing a bouquet in the 
path of a princess, or arresting the kind glance of 
a queen. And yet these momentary chances we 
covet; and spend our years, and passions, and 
powers in pursuit of little more than these; while,
-P-A-G-E-171
  EDUCATIONAL VALUE OF LITERATURE 161 
meantime, there is a society continually open to us, 
of people who will talk to us as long as we like, 
whatever our rank or occupation;—talk to us in 
the best words they can choose, and with thanks 
if we listen to them. And this society, because it is 
so numerous and so gentle, —and can be kept wait- 
ing round us all day long, not to grant audience, but 
to gain it; kings and statesmen lingering patiently 
in those plainly furnished and narrow anterooms, our 
bookcase shelves, — we make no account of that 
company,— perhaps never listen to a word they 
would say, all day long! 
“This court of the past differs from all living 
aristocracy in this: it is open to labor and to 
merit, but to nothing else. No wealth will bribe, 
no name overawe, no artifice deceive, the guardian 
of those Elysian gates. In the deep sense, no vile 
or vulgar person ever enters there. At the portiéres 
of that silent Faubourg St.-Germain, there is but 
brief question, ‘Do you deserve to enter?’ ‘Pass. 
Do you ask to be the companions of nobles? Make 
yourself noble, and you shall be. Do you long for 
the conversation of the wise? Learn to understand 
it, and you shall hear it. But on other terms ?— 
no. If you will not rise to us, we cannot stoop to 
you. The living lord may assume courtesy, the 
living philosopher explain his thought to you with 
considerable pain; but here we neither feign nor 
interpret; you must rise to the level of our thoughts 
M
-P-A-G-E-172

if you would be gladdened by them, and share our 
feelings, if you would recognize our presence.’” 
Wordsworth says : — 
“Books, we know, 
Are a substantial world, both pure and good ; 
Round these, with tendrils strong as flesh and blood, 
Our pastime and our happiness will grow.” 
Carlyle says :— 
“We learn to read, in various languages, in 
various sciences; we learn the alphabet and letters 
of all manner of Books. But the place where we 
are to get knowledge, even theoretic knowledge, is 
the Books themselves! It depends on what we read, 
after all manner of Professors have done their best 
for us. The true University of these days is a 
Collection of Books.” 
Were we willing to accept the testimony of great 
writers and thinkers, we should but too quickly 
acknowledge the supreme value of books. James 
Baldwin, in the first chapter of his “Book Lover,” 
has collected more than a score of like utterances 
of great writers “In Praise of Books.” Such tes- 
timony may at least suggest to some of us who 
have drunk but sparingly of the refreshing springs 
of literature, that there are better things in store 
for us. 
We will first inquire into those vital elements of 
strength which are peculiar to literature. 
One of the elements that goes into the make-up 
‘
-P-A-G-E-173
EDUCATIONAL VALUE OF LITERATURE 163 
of a masterpiece of literature is its underlying, per- 
manent truth. Whether written to-day or in earlier 
centuries, it must contain lasting qualities that do 
not fade away or bleach out or decay. Time and 
weather do not stain or destroy its merit. Some 
classics, as Gray’s “Elegy,” or “ Thanatopsis,” are 
like cut diamonds. The quality that gives them 
force and brilliancy is inherent, and the form in 
which they appear has been wrought out by an 
artist. The fundamental value of a classic is the 
deep, significant truth which, like the grain in fine 
woods, is wrought into its very structure. The artist 
who moulds a masterpiece like “Enoch Arden” or 
“The Scarlet Letter” is not a writer of temporary 
fame. The truth to which he feels impelled to give 
expression is strong, natural, human truth, which has 
no beginning and no end. It is true forever. Schil- 
ler’s William Tell, though idealized, is a human 
hero with the hearty thoughts of a real man. Shy- 
lock is a Jew of flesh and blood, who will laugh if 
he is tickled, and break into anger if he is thwarted. 
The true poet builds upon eternal foundations. The 
bookmaker or rhymer is satisfied with empty or fleet- 
ing thoughts and with a passing notoriety. New 
books are often caught up and blazoned as classics 
which a few years reveal as patchwork and tinsel. 
Time is a sure test. Showy tinsel rusts and dulls 
its lustre, while simple poetic truth shines with grow- 
ing brightness.

Schlegel, in his “Dramatic Art and Literature,” 
thus contrasts the false and the true (pp. 18-19):— 
“Poetry, taken in its widest acceptation, as the 
power of creating what is beautiful, and represent- 
ing it to the eye or the ear, is a universal gift of 
Heaven, being shared to a certain extent even by 
those whom we call barbarians and savages. In- 
ternal excellence is alone decisive, and where this 
exists we must not allow ourselves to be repelled by 
the external appearance. Everything must be traced 
up to the root of human nature: if it has sprung 
from thence, it has an undoubted worth of its own; 
but if, without possessing a living germ, it is merely 
externally attached thereto, it will never thrive nor 
acquire a proper growth. Many productions which 
appear at first sight dazzling phenomena in the prov- 
ince of the fine arts, and which as a whole have been 
honored with the appellation of works of a golden 
age, resemble the mimic gardens of children: impa- 
tient to witness the work of their hands, they break 
off here and there branches and flowers, and plant 
them in the earth; everything at first assumes a noble 
appearance: the childish gardener struts proudly up 
and down among his showy beds, till the rootless 
plants begin to droop, and hang their withered leaves 
and blossoms, and nothing soon remains but the bare 
twigs, while the dark forest, on which no art or care 
was ever bestowed, and which towered up toward 
heaven long before human remembrance, bears every
-P-A-G-E-175
  EDUCATIONAL VALUE OF LITERATURE 165 
blast unshaken, and fills the solitary beholder with 
religious awe.” 
In his “Poets and Problems,” George Willis 
Cooke fitly portrays the poet’s function (pp. 42, 32, 
and 44): — 
“The poet must be either a teacher or an artist; 
or, what is better, he may be both in one. There- 
fore, he can never stop at form or at what delights 
and charms merely. He must go on to the expres- 
sion of something of deep and real abidingness of 
thought and beauty. This comes at last to be the 
real thing for which he works, which he seeks to bring 
into expression with such power and grandeur in it as 
he can produce, and which he wills to send forth for 
the sake of this higher impression on the world.” 
“Man has within him a need for the food which 
does not perish; he always is finding anew that he 
cannot live by bread alone. His mind will crave 
truth, his heart love, somewhat to satisfy the inward 
needs of life. A heavenly homesickness will draw 
him away from the material to those esthetic and 
spiritual realities which are at the source of the tru- 
est poetry. Whenever these wants find fit interpreta- 
tion, the poet and the poetic method of expression 
appear and give to them outward forms of beauty. 
Consequently the poet is 
“One in whom persuasion and belief 
Have ripened into faith, and faith become 
A passionate intuition.’ 
 
-P-A-G-E-176
  166 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
“ The true poet is the man of his time who is most 
alive, who feels, sees, and knows the most. In the 
measure of his life he is the greatest man of his age 
and country. His eye sees farther and more clearly ; 
his heart beats more warmly and with a more uni- 
versal sympathy; his thought runs deeper and with 
a swifter current, than is the case with other men. 
He is the oracle and guide, the inspirer and the 
friend, of those to whom he sings. He creates life 
under the ribs of dead tradition; he illumines the 
present with heart flames of beaconing truth, and he 
makes the future seem like home joys far off, but 
drawing ever nigher. The poet is the world’s 
lover.” 
Emerson found the Greeks standing as close 
to nature and truth as himself (“Essay on His- 
tory””):— 
“The costly charm of the ancient tragedy, and 
indeed of all old literature, is, that the persons speak 
simply,— speak as persons who have great good 
sense without knowing it, before yet the reflective 
habit has become the predominant habit of the mind. 
Our admiration of the antique is not admiration of 
the old, but of the natural. The Greeks are not 
reflective, but perfect in their senses and in their 
health, with the finest physical organization in the 
world. Adults acted with the simplicity and grace 
of children.”
-P-A-G-E-177
EDUCATIONAL VALUE OF LITERATURE 167 
J. C. Shairp, in his “On Poetic Interpretation of 
Nature” (p. 19), says: — 
“The real nature and intrinsic truth of Poetry will 
be made more apparent, if we may turn aside for 
a moment to reflect on the essence of that state of 
mind which we call poetic, the genesis of that crea- 
tion which we call Poetry. Whenever any object of 
sense, or spectacle of the outer world, any truth of 
reason, or event of past history, any fact of human 
experience, any moral or spiritual reality ; whenever, 
in short, any fact or object which the sense, or the 
intellect, or the soul, or the spirit of man can appre- 
hend, comes home to one so as to touch him to the 
quick, to pierce him with a more than usual vivid- 
ness and sense of reality, then is awakened that 
stirring of the imagination, that glow of emotion, in 
which Poetry is born. There is no truth cognizable 
by man which may not shape itself into Poetry.” 
The passages just quoted are but examples of 
many that might be cited expressing the strength 
and scope of the poetic spirit, its truth-revealing 
quality, its penetrating yet comprehensive grasp of 
the realities. Shelley says, “A poem is the very 
image of life expressed in its eternal truth”; and 
Wordsworth that poetry is “the breath and finer spirit 
of all knowledge.” These utterances will hardly be 
deemed poetical extravagancies to one who has read 
such things as the Ninetieth Psalm, “ King Lear,” or 
“The Deserted Village,” or “ Elaine.”  
-P-A-G-E-178
168 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
There is no form of inspiring truth which does not 
find expression in literature, but it is preéminently a 
revelation of human life and experience, a proclama- 
tion from the housetops of the supreme beauty and 
excellence of truth and virtue. This brings us close 
to the question of moral education, and the elements 
in literature that contribute to this end. Literary 
critics are quick to take alarm at the propensity of the 
schoolmaster and the moralist to make literature the 
vehicle of moral training. To saddle the poets with 
a moral purpose would be like changing Pegasus into 
a plough-horse. But the moral quality in the best 
literature is not something’ saddled on, it is rather 
like the frame and muscle which give strength to 
the body, or, to use a more fitting figure, it is the 
very pulse and heart-beat of the highest idealism. 
The proneness toward moralizing, toward formal 
didacticism, can be best of all corrected by the use 
of choice literature. The best literature is free from 
moral pedantry, but full of moral suggestion and 
stimulus. Edmund Clarence Stedman says, in his 
“Nature and Elements of Poetry” (p. 216):— 
“The highest wisdom—that of ethics — seems 
closely affiliated with poetic truth. A prosaic moral 
is injurious to virtue, by making it repulsive. The 
moment goodness becomes tediouis and unideal in a 
work of art, it is not real goodness; the would-be 
artist, though a very saint, has mistaken his form of 
expression. On the other hand, extreme beauty and
-P-A-G-E-179
  EDUCATIONAL VALUE OF LITERATURE 169 
power in a poem or picture always carry a moral, 
they are inseparable from a certain ethical standard ; 
while vice suggests a depravity... . An obtrusive 
moral in poetic form is a fraud on its face, and out- 
lawed of art. But that all great poetry is essentially 
ethical is plain from any consideration of Homer, 
Dante, and the best dramatists and lyrists, old and 
new.” ; 
In literature, as in life, those persons make the 
strongest moral impression who have the least ex- 
press discussion of morals. Their actions speak, and 
the moral qualities appear, not in didactic formality 
and isolation, but in their life setting. This is seen 
in the great dramas, novels, and epic poems. 
These masterpieces are of strong and lasting value 
to the schools because they bring out human conduct 
and character in a rich variety of forms corresponding 
to life. Against the background of scenery created 
by the poet, men and women and children march 
along to their varied performances. Theseus, Ulysses, 
Crusoe, Aladdin, Alfred, Horatius, Cinderella, Portia, 
Evangeline, —they speak and act before us with all 
the realism and fidelity to human instincts peculiar to 
the poet’s art. These men and women, who are set 
in action before us, stir up all our dormant thought- 
energy. We observe and judge their motives and 
approve or condemn their actions. We are stirred to 
sympathy or pity or anger. Such an intense study 
of motives and conduct, as offered in literature, is 
 
-P-A-G-E-180
  170 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
like a fresh spring from which well up strengthening 
waters. The warmth and energy with which judg. 
ments are passed upon the deeds of children and 
adults is the original source of moral ideas. Litera- 
ture is especially rich in opportunities to register 
these convictions. It is not the bare knowledge of 
right and wrong developed, but the deep springs of 
feeling and emotion are opened, which gush up into 
volitions and acts. 
Just as we form opinions of people from their 
individual acts, and draw inferences as to their char- 
acter and motives, so the overt act of Brutus or of 
Miles Standish stands out so clear against the back- 
ground of passing events that an unerring judgment 
falls upon the doer. A single act, seen in its rela- 
tions, always calls forth such a sentence of good or 
ill, Whether it be a gentle deed of mercy, or the 
hammer-stroke that fells a giant or routs an army, as 
with Charles Martel or Alfred, the sense of right or 
wrong is the deep underflow that gives meaning to all 
events and stamps character. 
There is, however, a deeper and more intense moral 
teaching in literature than that which flows from the 
right or wrong of individual acts. The whole life 
and evolution of character in a person, if graphically 
drawn, reveal the principles of conduct and their 
fruitage. Character is a growth. Deeds are only 
the outward signs of the direction in which the soul 
is moving. A dramatist like Shakespeare, or a novel-
-P-A-G-E-181
EDUCATIONAL VALUE OF LITERATURE 171 
ist like George Eliot, gives us a biographical develop- 
ment. Deeds are done which leave their traces. 
Tendencies are formed which grow into habits, and 
thus a character ripens steadily toward its reward. 
We become conscious that certain deeper principles 
control thought and action, whether good or bad. 
There is a rule of law, a sort of fatalism, in human 
life. “The mills of the gods grind slow, but they 
grind exceeding small.” It is the function of the 
dramatist or novelist to reveal these working princi- 
ples in conduct. When the principle adopted by the 
actor is a good one, it works out well-being in spite of 
misfortunes; when evil, the furies are on the track of 
the evil-doer. Men do not gather grapes of thorns 
or figs of thistles. As we move on from step to step 
in a life-history, the sympathy deepens. The fatal 
influence of a false step, followed up, is keenly felt 
by the reader; the upward tendency of a right act 
inspires and lifts into freedom. But whether we love 
or hate or pity, the character moves on in the course 
which his deeds mark out. When finally he is over- 
whelmed in shame and defeat, we see the early ten- 
dencies and later forces which have led to this result. 
If ethical triumph is achieved, we recognize the re- 
ward of generous, unselfish impulses followed out. 
As the interest in such a life-history deepens, the 
lessons it evolves come out with convincing and 
overwhelming power. The effect of a great novel 
or drama is more intense and lasting than any
-P-A-G-E-182
  172 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
sermon. The elements of thought and feeling have 
been accumulating energy and momentum through 
all the scenes, and when contracted into a single 
current at the close they sweep forward with the 
strength of a river. A masterpiece works at the 
foundations of our sympathies and moral judgments. 
To bring ourselves under the spell of a great author 
and to allow him, hour after hour and perhaps for 
days in succession, to sway our feelings and rule 
far up among the sources of our moral judgments, 
is to give him great opportunity to stamp our char- 
acter with his convictions. We seldom spend so 
many hours in close companionship with a living 
friend as with some master of the art of character- 
delineation. Children are susceptible to this strong 
influence. Many of them take easily to books, and 
many others need but wise direction to bring them 
under the touch of their formative influence. A 
book sometimes produces a more lasting effect upon 
the character and conduct of a child than a close 
companion. Nor is this true only in the case of 
book-lovers. It is probable that the great majority 
of children may feel the wholesome effect of such 
books if wisely used at the right time. To select 
a few of the best books as companions to a child, 
and teach him to love their companionship, is one 
of the most hopeful things in education. The boy 
or girl who reads some of our choice epics, stories, 
novels, dramas, and biographies, allowing the mind
-P-A-G-E-183
  
  EDUCATIONAL VALUE OF LITERATURE 173 
to ponder upon the problems of conduct involved, 
will receive many deep and permanent moral lessons. 
The realism with which the artist clothes his char- 
acters only strengthens the effect and makes them 
lasting food for thought in the coming years. Even 
in early childhood we are able to detect what is 
noble and debasing in conduct as thus graphically 
and naturally revealed, and a child forms an unerring 
judgment along moral lines. The best influence that 
literature has to bestow, therefore, may produce its ef- 
fect early in tender years, where impressions are deep 
and permanent. There are many other elements of 
lasting culture-value in the study of literature, but 
first of all the deep and permanent truths taught by 
the classics are those of human life and conduct. 
George Willis Cooke gives clear and simple ex- 
pression to the ethical force in poetry (“ Poets and 
Problems,” p. 46): — 
“True poetry is for instruction as much as for 
pleasure, though it inculcate no formal lessons. 
Right moral teaching is by example far more than 
by precept; and the real poet teaches through the 
higher purpose he arouses, by the stimulus he gives, 
and by the purer motive he awakens. He gives 
no precept to recite, no homilies to con over, no rules 
for formal repetition ; but he gives the spirit of life 
and the impulse of true activity. An infallible test 
of the great poet is that he inspires us with a sense 
of the richness and grandeur of life.”
-P-A-G-E-184
  174 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
Shairp, in his “On Poetic Interpretation of 
Nature” (pp. 23-24), says: — 
“Tmagination in its essence seems to be, from the 
first, intellect and feeling blended and interpenetrat- 
ing each other. Thus it would seem that purely 
intellectual acts belong to the surface and outside 
of our nature, —as you pass onward to the depths, 
the more vital places of the soul, the intellectual, 
the emotional, and the moral elements are all equally 
at work, —and this in virtue of their greater reality, 
their more essential truth, their nearer contact with 
the centre of things. To this region belong all 
acts of high imagination—the region intermediate 
between pure understanding and moral affection, 
partaking of both elements, looking equally both 
ways.” 
Besides the moral element or fundamental truth in- 
volved, every classic masterpiece is infused therefore 
with an element of imagination. Whether in prose or 
verse, the artist reveals himself in the creative touch. 
The rich coloring and imagery of his own mind give 
a tint to every object. The literary artist is never 
lacking in a certain, perhaps indefinable, charm. He 
possesses a magic wand that transforms into beauty 
every commonplace object that is met. We observe 
this in Irving, Hawthorne, Warner, as well as in still 
greater literary masters. Our poets, novelists, and 
essayists must all dip their pens in this magic ink. 
Even Webster and Burke, Lincoln and Sumner, must
-P-A-G-E-185
  EDUCATIONAL VALUE OF LITERATURE 175 
rise to the region of fancy if they give their thought 
sufficient strength of wing to carry it into the coming 
years. The themes upon which they discoursed 
kindled the imagination and caused them to break 
forth into figures of speech and poetic license. The 
creative fancy is that which gives beauty, pictu- 
resqueness, and charm to all the work of poet or 
novelist. This element of fancy diffuses itself as 
a living glow through every classic product that 
was made to endure. In the masters of style the 
rhythmic flow and energy of language are enlivened 
by poetic imagery. Figures of speech in archi- 
tectural simplicity and chasteness stand out to sym- 
bolize thought. That keenness and originality which 
astonishes us in master thinkers is due to the magic 
vigor and picturesqueness of their images. Under- 
neath and permeating all this wealth of ideas is 
the versatile and original mind which sees everything 
in the glow of its own poetic temperament, kin- 
dling the susceptible reader to like inspiration. 
Among literary masters this creative power shows 
itself in an infinite variety of forms, pours itself 
through a hundred divergent channels, and links 
itself so closely with the individuality of the writer 
as to merge imperceptibly into his character and 
style. But as we cannot secure wholesome bread 
without yeast, so we shall fail of a classic without 
imagination. 
Stedman says: “If anything great has been
-P-A-G-E-186
  176 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
achieved without exercise of the imagination, I do 
not know it. Iam referring to striking productions 
and achievements, not to acts of virtue. Neverthe- 
less, at the last analysis, it might be found that 
imagination has impelled even the saints and 
martyrs of humanity. Imagination is the creative 
origin of what is fine, not in art and song alone, 
but also in all forms of action—in campaigns, civil 
triumphs, material conquest. I have mentioned its 
indispensability to the scientists.” He says further: 
“Yet if there is one gift which sets Shakespeare at 
a distance even from those who approach him on 
one or another side, it is that of his imagination. 
As he is the chief of poets, we infer that the faculty 
in which he is supereminent must be the greatest of 
> poetic endowments. Yes: in his wonderland, as 
elsewhere, imagination is king.” 
Not only is it true that the vitality of poets and 
prose writers, the conceptive power of scientists, 
inventors, and business organizers, depend upon 
the fertility and strength of the imagination, but 
throughout the broader reaches of common humanity 
this power is everywhere present — constructive 
and creative. Max Miiller has shown that the 
root words of language are imbedded in metaphor, 
that “Language is fossil poetry.” Again, the 
mythologies of the different races, grand and stately, 
or fair and lovely, are the immediate product of 
the folk mind.
-P-A-G-E-187
  EDUCATIONAL VALUE OF LITERATURE 177 
It has been said that “The man of culture is 
preéminently a man of imagination.” But the 
kind of mental alertness, freedom, and joy which is 
suggested by the term cwd/ture may spring up in the 
heart of every boy and girl endowed with a modicum 
of human nature. Hamilton Wright Mabie, in his 
“ Books and Culture” (pp. 148-149), says : — 
“The development of the imagination, upon the 
power of which both absorption of knowledge and 
creative capacity depend, is, therefore, a matter of 
supreme importance. To this necessity educators 
will some day open their eyes, and educational sys- 
tems will some day conform; meantime, it must be 
done mainly by individual work. Knowledge, disci- 
pline, and technical training of the best sort are 
accessible on every hand; but the development of 
the faculty which unites all these in the highest form 
of activity must be secured mainly by personal effort. 
The richest and most accessible material for this 
highest education is furnished by art; and the form 
of art within reach of every civilized man, at all 
times, in all places, is the book. To these master- 
pieces, which have been called the books of life, all 
men may turn with the assurance that as the supreme 
achievements of the imagination they have the power 
of awakening, stimulating, and enriching it in the 
highest degree.” 
Besides the strong thread of truth and the work 
of the swift-glancing shuttle of imagination, the 
N
-P-A-G-E-188
178 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
woven fabric of the literary master must show a 
beauteous pattern or form. The melody and music 
of poetry spring from a rhythmic form. Appar- 
ently stiff and formal, it is yet the consensus of 
critics that only through this channel can the soul 
of truth and beauty escape from the poet, and mani- 
fest itself to others. Says George Willis Cooke, 
“The poet worships at the triple shrine of beauty, 
love, and truth; and his mission is to teach men that 
all other objects and places of veneration are but 
faint imitations of this one form of faith.’ But the 
spirit of this worship can best embody itself in the 
poetic form. 
Schlegel, in his “ Dramatic Art and Literature” 
(p. 340), says :— 
“The works of genius cannot therefore be per- 
mitted to be without form; but of this there is no 
danger... . [Some] critics . . . interpret it [form] 
merely in a mechanical, and not in an organical 
sense... . Organical form, again, is innate; it 
unfolds itself from within, and acquires its determi- 
nation contemporaneously with the perfect develop- 
ment of the germ. We everywhere discover such 
forms in nature throughout the whole range of living 
powers, from the crystallization of salts and minerals 
to plants and flowers, and from these again to the 
human body. In the fine arts, as well as in the 
domain of nature, — the supreme artist, — all genuine 
forms are organical, that is, determined by the qual-
-P-A-G-E-189
EDUCATIONAL VALUE OF LITERATURE 179 
ity of the work. In a word, the form is nothing but 
a significant exterior, the speaking physiognomy of 
each thing, which, as long as it is not disfigured by 
any destructive accident, gives a true evidence of its 
hidden essence.” 
Some products, like the “ Paradise Lost,” “ Thana- 
topsis,” and “ Hamlet,” show such a perfect fitness of 
form to thought that every effort to change or mod- 
_ ify is profanation. The classic form and thought go 
together. As far as possible, therefore, it is desir- 
able to leave these creations in their native strength, 
and not to mar the work of masters. The poet has 
moulded his thought and feeling into these forms 
and transfused them with his own imagery and indi- 
viduality. The power of the writer is in his peculiar 
mingling of the poetic elements. Our English and 
American classics, therefore, should be read in their 
original form as far as possible. 
A fixed form is not always necessary. We need 
many of the stories and epics that were written in 
other languages. Fortunately some of the works of 
the old poets are capable of taking on a new dress. 
The story of Ulysses has been told in verse and 
prose, in translation, paraphrase, and simple nar- 
rative for children. Much, indeed of the old 
beauty and original strength of the poem is lost in 
all these renderings; but the central truths which 
give the poetic work its persistent value are still 
retained. Such a poem is like a person; the under-  
-P-A-G-E-190
180 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
lying thought, though dressed up by different per- 
sons with varying taste and skill, is yet the same; 
the same heart beats beneath the kingly robes and 
the peasant’s frock. Robinson Crusoe has had many 
renderings, but remains the same old story in spite of 
variations. The Bible has been translated into all 
modern tongues, but it isa classicin each. The Ger- 
mans claim they have as good a Shakespeare as we. 
But many of the best masterpieces were originally 
written in other languages, and to be of use to us the 
ancient form of thought must be broken. The spirit 
of the old masters must be poured into new moulds. 
In educating our children we need the stories of 
Bellerophon, Perseus, Hercules, Rustum, Tell, Sieg- 
fried, Virginius, Roland, Wallace, King Arthur. 
Happily some of the best modern writers have come 
to our help. Walter Scott, Macaulay, Dickens, 
Kingsley, Hawthorne, Irving, and Arnold have 
gathered up the old wine and poured it into new 
bottles. They have told the old stories in simple 
Anglo-Saxon for the boys and girls of our homes 
and schools. Nor are these renderings of the old 
masters lacking in that element of fancy and vigor 
of expression which distinguishes fertile writers. 
They have entered freely and fondly into the old 
spirit, and have allowed it to pour itself copiously 
through these modern channels. It takes a poet, in 
fact, to modernize an ancient story. There are, 
indeed, many renderings of the old stories which
-P-A-G-E-191
EDUCATIONAL VALUE OF LITERATURE 181 
are not ideal, which, however, we sometimes use for 
lack of anything better. 
From the preceding discussion we may conclude 
that/a choice piece of literature must embody a last- 
ing truth, reveal the permeating glow of an artist’s 
imagination, and find expression in some form of 
beauty.) But these elements are so mingled and 
interlaced, so organically grown into one living plant, 
that even the critics have given up the effort to 
dissect and isolate them. 
There are other strength-conferring qualities in 
good literature which will be discussed more fully in 
those chapters which deal with the particular literary 
materials selected for use in the schools. 
Among the topics to be treated in connection with 
materials which illustrate them, are the following: 
the strong handling of essential historical ideas in 
literature ; the best novel and drama, as sources and 
means of culture; religious ideals as embodied in the 
choicest forms of literature; the powerful patriotic 
and social influence of the best writers; the educa- 
tive quality of the humorous phases of literature; the 
great writers as models of skill and enthusiasm in 
teaching. 
In the foregoing pages the significance of literature 
among great studies has been but briefly and inade- 
quately suggested by these few quotations and com- 
ments. It would be easy to multiply similar testimony 
from the most competent judges. But enough has

been said to remind teachers of this rich treasure 
house of educative materials. Those teachers who 
wish to probe deeper into this subject will find that it 
has been handled in a masterly way by some of the 
great essayists and critics. We will suggest the fol- 
lowing for more elaborate study : — 
Ruskin’s “Sesame and Lilies.” The power and 
charm of Ruskin’s writing appears in full measure in 
these essays. 
Carlyle’s “ Heroes and Hero Worship,” especially 
the chapters on “ The Hero as Poet,” and “ The Hero 
as Man of Letters.” 
Shelley’s “ Defence of Poetry” (edited by Cook, 
and published by Ginn & Co.) is a literary master- 
piece of rare beauty and charm. 
Emerson’s “ Essay on History.” 
George Willis Cooke, ‘“ Poets and Problems” 
(Houghton, Mifflin, & Co.). The first chapter, “ The

ters on Tennyson, Ruskin, and Browning are fine 
introductions for those who will study the authors 
themselves.

id.) 
Charles Kingsley’s “ Literary and General Essays”’

the merits of literature can take the place of a study 
of the works of the best writers.

    CHAPTER X 
Tue Use or MastTErPIEcES AS WHOLES 
WitH the increasing tendency to consider the 
literary quality and fitness of the reading matter used 
in our schools, longer poems and stories, like “ Snow 
Bound,” “Rip Van Winkle,” ‘“ Hiawatha,” “ Alad- 
din,’ “The Courtship of Miles Standish,” “The 
Great Stone Face,” and even “Lady of the Lake” 
and “Julius Cesar,” are read and studied as com- 
plete wholes. Many of the books now used as read- 
ers are not collections of short selections and extracts, 
as formerly, but editions of single poems, or kindred 
groups, like “Sohrab and Rustum,” or the “ Ara- 
bian Nights,” or “ Gulliver’s Travels,” or a collection 
of a few complete stories or poems of a single author, 
as Hawthorne’s “Stories of the White Hills,” or 
Lowell's “ Vision of Sir Launfal,” and other poems. 
Even the regular series of readers are often made up 
largely of longer poems and prose masterpieces. 
The significance of this change is the deeper re- 
gard which is being paid to good literature as a strong 
agency of true culture. The real thought and the 
whole thought of the best authors is sought for, pre- 
supposing, of course, that they are within the range 
184
-P-A-G-E-195
  THE USE OF MASTERPIECES AS WHOLES 185 
of the children’s comprehension. The reading books 
of a generation ago contained oftentimes just as 
choice literary materials as now; but the chief pur- 
pose of its selection was to give varied exercise in 
oral reading, not to cultivate a taste for good litera- 
ture by furnishing complete poetic and prose speci- 
mens for full and enthusiastic study. The teachers 
who lay stress on elocutionary skill are not quite 
satisfied with this drift toward literary study as such. 
It remains to be seen how both aims, good oral ren- 
dering and superior literary training, can be secured 
at the same time. 
At the close of the last chapter of this volume we 
give a carefully selected series of the literary ma- 
terials adapted to the different grades. This body 
of selections, taken from a wide range of litera- 
ture, will constitute a basis for our whole treatise. 
Having made plain by our previous discussion what 
we understand by the quality of literary masterpieces, 
we will next consider why these poems and stories 
should be read and studied as complete wholes, not 
by fragments or by extracts, but as whole works of 
literary art. 
1. A stronger interest is developed by the study, 
for several weeks, of a longer complete masterpiece. 
The interest grows as we move into such a story 
or poem as “Sohrab and Rustum.” A longer and 
closer acquaintance with the characters represented 
produces a stronger personal sympathy, as in the
-P-A-G-E-196
  186 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
case of Cordelia in “ King Lear,” or of Silas Marner. 
The time usually spent in school upon some classic 
fragment or selection is barely sufficient to start up 
an interest. It does not bring us past the threshold 
of a work of art. We drop it just at the point where 
the momentum of interest begins to show itself. 
Think of the full story of Aladdin or Crusoe or 
Ulysses. Take an extract from “Lady of the 
Lake,” “Rip Van Winkle,’ “Evangeline.” The 
usual three or four pages given in the reader, even 
if taken from the first part, would scarcely suffice to 
bring the children into the movement of the story; 
but oftentimes the fragment is extracted from the 
body of the play without preliminary or sequence. 
In reading a novel, story, or poem, we do not begin to 
feel strongly this interest till two or three chapters are 
passed. Then it begins to deepen, the plot thickens, 
and a desire springs up to follow out the fortune of 
the characters. We become interested in the persons, 
and our thoughts are busy with them in the midst of 
other employments or in leisure moments. The per- 
sonality of the hero takes hold of us as that of an 
intimate friend. Such an interest, gradually awakened 
and deepened as we move into the comprehension of 
a work of art, is the open sesame to all the riches of 
an author’s storehouse of thought. 
This kind of interest presupposes in the children 
the ability to appreciate and enjoy the thought, and 
even the style, of the author. Interest in this sense
-P-A-G-E-197
THE USE OF MASTERPIECES AS WHOLES 187 
is a fundamental test of the suitableness of the story 
or poem to lay hold of the inner life of the children. 
In many cases there will be difficulties at the outset 
in awakening this genuine form of interest, but 
if the selection is appropriate, the preparation 
and skill of the teacher will be equal to its 
accomplishment. 
As we get deeper into the study of masterpieces, 
we shall discover that there are stronger and deepen- 
ing sources of a genuine interest. Even the difficul- 
ties and problems which are supposed to dampen 
interest will be found, with proper study, to be the 
source of a stronger appreciation and enthusiasm. 
The refining and strengthening of these interests in 
literature leads on steadily to the final goal of study, 
a cultivated taste and habit of using the best books. 
2. A complete work of a master writer is a unit 
of thought. It is almost as complete a whole as 
a living organism. Its parts, like the branches of a 
tree, have no vitality except in communication with 
the living trunk. In the “Vision of Sir ‘Launfal,” 
there is a single thought, like a golden thread, run- 
ning through the poem, which gives unity and per- 
fection to it. The separate parts of the poem have 
very great intrinsic beauty and charm, but their 
deeper and more vital relation is to this central 
thought. The story of “The Great Stone Face” is 
the grouping of a series of interesting episodes along 
the path of a single developing motive in the life of
-P-A-G-E-198
  188 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
Emest. A great writer would scarcely waste his 
time in trying to produce a work of art without a 
controlling motive, collecting his thought, as it were, 
around a vacuum. This hub-thought must become 
the centre of all intelligent study. The effort to 
unravel the motive of the author is the deeper stim- 
ulus of thoughtful work by both teacher and pupils. 
In other studies, like geography, history, and 
natural science, we are gradually picking out the 
important units of study, the centres of thought and 
interest, the types. This effort to escape from the 
wilderness of jumbled and fractional details into the 
sunlit region of controlling ideas, is a substantial 
‘sign of progress in the teacher’s work. In literature 
these units have been already wrought out into per- 
fect wholes by first-class thinkers. 
In the greatest of all studies, the works of the 
literary masters, we have the surest models of inspir- 
ing thought, organized and focussed upon essential 
topics. Teachers, in some cases, are so little accus- 
tomed to lift their heads above the tall grass and 
weeds around them, that they are overtaken by sur- 
prise and bewilderment when called upon to take 
broad and liberal surveys of the topography of 
school studies. 
It is fortunate that we have, within the fenced 
boundaries of the commonly recognized school 
course, these shining specimens of organized, and, 
what we might call, intelligent thought.
-P-A-G-E-199
  THE USE OF MASTERPIECES AS WHOLES 189 
We can set the children at work digging for the 
root-thoughts of those who are the masters of strong 
thinking. This digging process is not wholly out 
of place with children. Their abundant energy can 
be turned to digging if there is anything worth 
digging for. Ruskin, in “Sesame and Lilies,” 
says: — : 
“And it is just the same with men’s best wisdom. 
When you come to a good book, you must ask your- 
self: ‘Am I inclined to work as an Australian miner 
would? Are my pickaxes and shovels in good 
order, and am I in good trim myself, my sleeves well 
up to the elbow, and my breath good, and my tem- 
per?’ And, keeping the figure a little longer, even 
at cost of tiresomeness, for it is a thoroughly useful 
one, the metal you are in search of, being the 
author’s mind or meaning, his words are as the rock 
which you have to crush and smelt in order to get 
at it. And your pickaxes are your own care, wit 
and learning; your smelting furnace is your own 
thoughtful soul. Do not hope to get at any good 
author’s meaning without those tools and that fire; 
often you will need sharpest, finest chiselling, and 
patientest fusing, before you can gather one grain 
of the metal.” 
It is not the dreamy, hammock-soothing, vacation 
idling with pleasant stories that we are now consider- 
ing. This happy lotus-land has also its fitting sea- 
son, in the sultry heats of summer, when tired people
-P-A-G-E-200
  190 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
put their minds out to grass. Any study will grow 
dull and sleepy that lacks energy. 
Teachers who shrink back with anxiety lest works 
such as Irving’s ‘Sketch Book,” ‘“ Evangeline,” 
“Merchant of Venice,’ and “Marmion,” are too 
hard for children in sixth, seventh, and eighth 
grades, should consider for a moment what classical 
preparatory schools for centuries have required of 
boys from ten to twelve years of age, the study of 
“Ceesar,” “Eutropius,” and “ Virgil,” of ‘“ Herod- 
* and “Xenophon,” in unknown languages ex- 
tremely difficult to master. Yet it has been claimed 
for ages, by the best scholars, that this was the true 
strength-producing discipline for boys. It would 
hardly be extravagant to say that the masterpieces 
of literature now used, in our intermediate and gram- 
mar grades, are not a quarter so difficult and four 
times as appropriate and interesting as the Latin 
and Greek authors just cited. It seems obvious that 
we are summoned to a more energetic study and 
treatment of our masterpieces. 
This struggle to get at the deeper undercurrent 
of thought in an author is the true stimulus and dis- 
cipline of such studies. 
A great author approaches his deeper thought step 
by step. He has many side-lights, variety of episode 
and preliminary. He provides for the proper scenery 
and setting for his thought. He does not bring us 
at once, point blank, upon his hero or upon the otus’
-P-A-G-E-201
THE USE OF MASTERPIECES AS WHOLES I9Ql 
hero’s fate. There is great variety of inference and 
suggestion in the preparation and grouping of the 
artist's work. As in climbing some mountain peak, 
we wind through cafion, along rugged hillsides and 
spurs, only now and then catching a glimpse of the 
towering object of our climb, reaching, after many a 
devious and toilsome march, the rugged backbone 
of the giant; so the poet carries us along many a 
winding road, through byways and thickets, over 
hill and plain, before he brings us into full view of 
the main object of search. But after awhile we do 
stand face to face with a real character, and are con- 
scious of the framework upon which it is built. King 
Saul has run his course and is about to reap the 
reward of his doings, to lie down in the bed which 
he has prepared. We see the author’s deeper plan, 
and realize that his characters act along the line of 
the silent but invincible laws of social life and con- 
duct. These deep significant truths of human expe- 
rience do not lie upon the surface. If we are really 
to get a deep insight into human character, as por- 
trayed by the masters, we must not be in haste. We 
should be willing to follow our guide patiently and 
await results. 
A complete masterpiece, studied as a whole, reveals 
the author’s skill and organizing power in working 
out his fundamental theme. A play, a poem, a 
novel, a biography, is a unit. No single part can 
give a satisfactory idea of the whole. A single scene  
-P-A-G-E-202
  192 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
from “Crusoe” or from the “ Merchant of Venice” 
does not give us the author’s meaning. An extract 
from one of Burke’s speeches supplies no adequate 
notion of his statesmanlike grasp of thought. To 
get some impression of what Daniel Webster was we 
must read a whole speech. A literary product is like 
a masterpiece of architecture. The whole must stand 
out in the due proportion of its parts to reveal the 
master’s thought. 
“Walk about Zion, and go round about her: 
Tell the towers thereof. 
Mark ye well her bulwarks, consider her palaces ; 
That ye may tell it to the generations following.” 
To have read through with care and thoughtful 
appreciation a single literary masterpiece and to have 
felt the full measure of a master’s power, is a rare 
and lasting stroke of culture. As children move up 
through the grades they may receive the strong and 
abiding impress of the masters of style. Let it come 
to them in its undiminished strength. To feel the 
powerful tonic effect of the best stories and poems 
suited to their age will give them such an apprecia- 
tion of what is genuine and good in literature, that 
frivolous and trashy reading is measured at its true 
value. 
The fragments and extracts with which our higher 
readers are filled are not without power and influence 
upon culture. They have given many children their 
first taste of the beauty and strength of literature.
-P-A-G-E-203
THE USE OF MASTERPIECES AS WHOLES 193 
But it is a great mistake to tear these gems of 
thought from their setting in literature and life, and 
to jam them into the close and crowded quarters of a 
text-book. Why satisfy ourselves with crumbs and 
fragments when a full rich feast may be had for the 
asking ? 
In some cases it is said that the reading of frag- 
ments of large poems or plays has excited curiosity 
and led to the reading of the larger wholes. This is 
doubtless true, but in the greater number of cases 
we are inclined to think the habit of being satisfied 
with fragments has checked the formation of any 
appreciation of literary wholes. This tendency to 
be satisfied with piecemeal performances illustrates 
painfully the shallowness and incoherency of much 
of our educational work. If teachers cannot think 
beyond a broken page of Shakespeare, why should 
children burden themselves with the labor of thought ? 
Charles Kingsley, in his essay on English literature, 
says :— 
“But I must plead for whole works. ‘Extracts’ 
and ‘Select Beauties’ are about as practical as the 
worthy in the old story, who, wishing to sell his house, 
brought one of the bricks to market as a specimen. 
It is equally unfair on the author and on the pupil; 
for it is impossible to show the merits or demerits 
of a work of art, even to explain the truth or false- 
hood of any particular passage, except by viewing 
the book as an organic whole.” 
°
-P-A-G-E-204
194 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
What would the authors themselves say upon see- 
ing their work thus mutilated? There is even a 
touch of the farcical in the effort to read naturally 
and forcibly and discuss intelligently a fragment like 
Antony’s speech over Czesar. 
3. The moral effect of a complete masterpiece is 
deeper and more permanent. Not only do we see a 
person acting in more situations, revealing thus his 
motives and hidden springs of action, but the thread 
of his thought and life is unravelled in a steady 
sequence. Later acts are seen as the result of for- 
mer tendencies. The silent reign of moral law in 
human actions is discovered. Slowly but surely con- 
duct works out its own reward along the line of these 
deeper principles of action. Even in the books read 
in the early grades these profound lessons of life 
come out clear and strong. Robinson Crusoe, The- 
seus, Siegfried, Hiawatha, Beauty and the Beast, 
Jason, King Arthur, and Ulysses are not holiday 
guests. They are face to face with the serious 
problems of life. Each person is seen in the 
present make-up and tendency of his character. 
When the eventual wind-up comes, be it a col- 
lapse or an ascension, we see how surely and 
fatally such results spring from such motives and 
tendencies. Washington is found to be the first in 
the hearts of his countrymen; Arnold is execrated; 
King Lear moves on blindly to the reward which 
his own folly has prearranged; Macbeth entangles  
-P-A-G-E-205
THE USE OF MASTERPIECES AS WHOLES 195 
himself in a network of fatal errors; Adam Bede 
emerges from the bitter ordeal of disappointment 
with his manly qualities subdued but stronger. Give 
the novelist or poet time and opportunity, and he is 
the true interpreter of conduct and destiny. He 
reveals in real and yet ideal characters the working 
out in life of the fundamental principles of moral 
action. 
4. A classic work is often a picture of an age, a 
panoramic survey of an historical epoch. Scott’s 
“Marmion” is such a graphic and dramatic portrayal 
of feudalism in Scotland. The castle with its lord, 
attendants, and household, the steep frowning walls 
and turrets, the moat, drawbridge, and dungeon, the 
chapel, halls, and feastings, the knight clad in armor, 
on horseback with squire and troop, —these are the 
details of the first picture. The cloister and nuns, 
with their sequestered habits and dress, their devotion 
and masses, supply the other characteristic picture of 
that age, with Rome in the background. The court 
scene and ball in King James’s palace, before the 
day of Flodden, the view of Scotland’s army from 
the mountain side, with the motley hordes from high- 
land and lowland and neighboring isles, and lastly, 
the battle of Flodden itself, where wisdom is weighed 
and valor put to the final test,—all these are but 
the parts of a well-adjusted picture of life in feudal 
times on the Scottish border. There is incidental 
to the narrative much vivid description of Scotch 
 
-P-A-G-E-206
196 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
scenery and geography, of mountain or valley, of 
frowning castle or rocky coast, much of Scotch tra- 
dition, custom, superstition, and clannishness. The 
scenes in cloister and dungeon and on the battle- 
field are more intensely real than historical narratives 
can be. While not strict history, this is truer than 
history because it brings us closer to the spirit of 
that time. Marmion and Douglas stand out more 
clear and lifelike than the men of history. 
Although feudalism underwent constant changes 
and modifications in every country of Europe, it is 
still true that “Marmion” is a type of feudal conditions, 
not only in Scotland, but in other parts of Europe, 
and a full perception of Scott’s poem will make one 
at home in any part of European history during 
feudal times. As a historical picture of life, it is a 
key to the spirit and animating ideas that swayed 
the Western nations during several centuries. It is 
fiction, not history, in the usual sense, and yet it gives 
a more real and vivid consciousness of the forces at 
work in that age than history proper. 
While the plot of the story covers a narrow field, 
only a few days of time and a small area of country, 
its roots go deep into the whole social, religious, and 
political fabric of that time. It touches real history 
at a critical point in the relations between England 
and Scotland. It is stirred also by the spirit of the 
Scotch bard and of minstrelsy. It shows what a 
hold Rome had in those days, even in the highlands of
-P-A-G-E-207
THE USE OF MASTERPIECES AS WHOLES 197 
Scotland. It is full of Scotch scenery and geography. 
It rings with the clarion of war and of battle. It 
reveals the contempt in which letters were held 
even by the most powerful nobles. Oxen are de- 
scribed as drawing cannon upon the field of Flodden, 
and in time these guns broke down the walls of 
feudalism. As a historical picture Marmion is many- 
sided, and the roots of the story reach out through 
the whole fabric of society, showing how all the parts 
cohere. Such a piece of historical literature may 
serve as a centre around which to gather much and 
varied information through other school and home 
readings. Children may find time to read “Ivanhoe,” 
“The Crusades,” ‘ Roland,” “ Don Quixote,” “The 
Golden Legend,” “Macbeth,” ‘Goetz von Berlich- 
ingen,” etc. They will have a nucleus upon which 
to gather many related facts and ideas. It should 
also be brought into proper connection with the 
regular lessons in history and geography. History 
reveals itself to the poet in these wonderfully vivid 
and lifelike types. In many of these historical poems, 
as “ William Tell,” “ Evangeline,” “Crusoe,” “The 
Nibelung Song,” “Miles Standish,” the “Odyssey,” 
“Sohrab and Rustum,” some hero stands in the centre 
of the narrative, and can be understood as a repre- 
sentative figure of his times only as the whole series 
of events in his life is unrolled. 
Where the study of larger literary wholes has 
been taken up in good faith, it has brought a rich  
-P-A-G-E-208
    198 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
blessing of intelligent enthusiasm. Even in primary 
schools, where literary wholes like “ Hiawatha,” 
“Robinson Crusoe,” and the “Golden Touch” are 
handled with a view to exploit their whole content, 
there has been a remarkable enrichment of the whole 
life of the children. Such a treatment has gone so 
deep into the problems and struggling conditions of 
life delineated, that the children have become occu- 
pied with the tent-making, boat-building, spinning, 
and various constructions incident to the develop- 
ment of the story. 
5. If it is true, as clearly expressed by strong think- 
ers in the most various fields of deeper investigation, 
that many of the chief literary products that have 
come down to us from former ages are the only 
means by which we can be brought into vital touch 
and sympathy with the spirit and motives then ruling 
among men; if it is equally true that children will 
not grow up to the proper appreciation and interpre- 
tation of our present life, except as they have experi- 
enced, in thought and interest at least, the chief 
struggles and motives of our fathers, — we may find 
in these historic and literary materials the deep and 
living springs of true education for children. 
The thought of the educative power of this ances- 
tral literature has been forcibly expressed by many 
eminent writers. 
Scudder, in “ Literature in School,” says : — 
“There is the element of continuity. In the
-P-A-G-E-209
THE USE OF MASTERPIECES AS WHOLES 199 
Roman household there stood the cinerary urns which 
held the ashes of the ancestors of the family. Do 
you think the young ever forgot the unbroken line of 
descent by which they climbed to the heroic founders 
of the state? In the Jewish family the child was 
taught to think and speak of the God of Abraham, 
and of Isaac, and of Jacob. In that great succession 
he heard a voice which told him his nation was not 
of a day. It is the business of the old to transmit 
to the young the great traditions of the past of 
the country; to feed anew the undying flame of 
patriotism. 
“Tt is this concentration in poetry and the more 
lofty prose which gives to literary art its precious- 
ness as a symbol of human endeavor, and renders it 
the one essential and most serviceable means for 
keeping alive the smouldering coals of patriotism. 
It is the torch passed from one hand to another, sig- 
naling hope and warning; and the one place above 
all others where its light should be kindled is where 
the young meet together, in those American temples 
which the people have built in every town and village 
in the country.” 
Mabie, in “ Books and Culture” (pp. 88, 89-113), 
says: — 
“Now, it is upon this imperishable food which the 
past has stored up through the genius of great artists 
that later generations feed and nourish themselves. 
It is through intimate contact with these fundamental
-P-A-G-E-210
200 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
conceptions, worked out with such infinite pain and 
patience, that the individual experience is broadened 
to include the experience of the race.” 
“The student of literature, therefore, finds in its 
noblest works not only the ultimate results of race 
experience and the characteristic quality of race 
genius, but the highest activity of the greatest minds 
in their happiest and most expansive moments. In 
this commingling of the best that is in the race and 
the best that is in the individual, lies the mystery of 
that double revelation which makes every work of art 
a disclosure, not only of the nature of the man 
behind it, but of all men behind him. In this com- 
mingling, too, is preserved the most precious deposit 
of what the race has been and done, and of what the 
man has seen, felt, and known. In the nature of 
things no educational material can be richer, none so 
fundamentally expansive and illuminative.” 
Emerson, in his “ Essay on History,” says:— 
“The advancing man discovers how deep a prop- 
erty he has in literature,—in all fable as well as in 
all history. He finds that the poet was no odd fellow 
who described strange and impossible situations, but 
that universal man wrote by his pen a confession true 
for one and true for all. His own secret biography 
he finds in lines wonderfully intelligible to him, dotted 
down before he was born. One after another he 
comes up in his private adventures with every fable 
of AZsop, of Homer, of Hafiz, of Ariosto, of Chaucer,
-P-A-G-E-211
  THE USE OF MASTERPIECES AS WHOLES 201 
of Scott, and verifies them with his own head and 
hands. 
“The beautiful fables of the Greeks, being proper 
creations of the imagination and not of the fancy, are 
universal verities. What a range of meanings and 
what perpetual pertinence has the story of Prome- 
theus! Besides its primary value as the first chapter 
of the history of Europe (the mythology thinly veil- 
ing authentic facts, the invention of the mechanic 
arts and the migration of colonies), it gives the his- 
tory of religion with some closeness to the faith of 
later ages.” 
“Thus in all ways does the soul concentrate and 
reproduce its treasures for each pupil. He, too, shall 
pass through the whole cycle of experience. He 
shall collect into a focus the rays of nature. History 
no longer shall be a dull book. It shall walk incar- 
nate in every just and wise man. You shall not tell 
me by languages and titles a catalogue of the vol- 
umes you have read. You shall make me feel what 
periods you have lived. A man shall be the Temple 
of Fame. He shall walk, as the poets have described 
that goddess, in a robe painted all over with wonder- 
ful events and experiences ; his own form and fea- 
tures by their exalted intelligence shall be that 
variegated vest. I shall find in him the Foreworld; 
in his childhood the Age of Gold; the Apples of 
Knowledge ; the Argonautic Expedition ; the calling 
of Abraham; the building of the Temple; the Ad- 
 
-P-A-G-E-212
202 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
vent of Christ; Dark Ages; the Revival of Letters; 
the Reformation; the discovery of new lands; the 
opening of new sciences, and new regions in man.” 
It is not intended to limit the reading of the 
schools to the longer classics, such as “ Snow-Bound,” 
“ The Vision of Sir Launfal,” and Webster’s Bunker 
Hill speech, etc. There arealso many shorter poems 
and stories, ballads, and myths, that are equally good 
and stand out as strong, complete expressions of 
thought such as Tennyson’s “ Brook,” Longfellow’s 
“Village Blacksmith,” Whittier’s “Barefoot Boy,” 
and many others. These shorter pieces should be in- 
terspersed among the longer, and freely used to give 
greater variety and zest to reading exercises. Many 
of the finest literary products of the language are 
found in these shorter poems and stories. They also 
should be studied for the beauty and unity of thought 
contained in each. 
But the sustained power gained from the full and 
rich study of longer classics is the best fruitage of 
the reading work. Every term of school should 
lead the children into the full appreciation of one 
or more of these masterly works. The value of 
such study is well expressed by Scudder in his 
“Literature in Schools” (pp. 54-56):— 
“The real point of practical reform, however, is 
not in the preference of American authors to Eng- 
lish, but in the careful concentration of the minds 
of boys and girls upon standard American literature,  
-P-A-G-E-213
THE USE OF MASTERPIECES AS WHOLES 203 
in opposition to a dissipation over a desultory and 
mechanical acquaintance with scraps from a variety 
of sources, good, bad, and indifferent. In my paper 
on ‘Nursery Classics in School,’ I argued that there 
is a true economy in substituting the great books 
of that portion of the world’s literature which repre- 
sents the childhood of the world’s mind for the thin, 
quickly forgotten, feeble imaginations of insignificant 
bookmakers. There is an equally noble economy 
in engaging the child’s mind, when it is passing out 
of an immature state into one of rational, intelligent 
appropriation of literature, upon such carefully chosen 
classic work as shall invigorate and deepen it. There 
is plenty of vagrancy in reading ; the public libraries 
and cheap papers are abundantly able to satisfy the 
truant: but it ought to be recognized once for all 
that the schools are to train the mind into appre- 
ciation of literature, not to amuse it with idle diver- 
sion; to this end, the simplest and most direct method 
is to place before boys and girls for their regular 
task in reading, not scraps from this and that author, 
duly paragraphed and numbered, but a wisely selected 
series of works by men whom their country honors, 
and who have made their country worth living in. 
“The continuous reading of a classic is in itself a 
liberal education ; the fragmentary reading of common- 
place lessons in minor morals, such as make up much 
of our reading-books, is a pitiful waste of growing 
mental powers. Even were our reading-books com-
-P-A-G-E-214
  204 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
posed of choice selections from the highest literature, 
they would still miss the very great advantage which 
follows upon the steady growth of acquaintance 
with a sustained piece of literary art. I do not 
insist, of course, that ‘Evangeline’ should be read at 
one session of the school, though it would be exceed- 
ingly helpful in training the powers of the mind if, 
after this poem had been read day by day for a few 
weeks, it were to be taken up first in its separate 
thirds, andthen in an entire reading. What I claim 
is that the boy or girl who has read ‘ Evangeline’ 
through steadily has acquired a certain power in 
appropriating literature which is not to be had by 
reading a collection of minor poems,—the power 
of long-sustained attention and interest.” 
The study of literary wholes, whether longer or 
shorter, in the common school is based upon the 
notion that the full, rich thought of the author is 
the absorbing purpose of our effort. Literature is 
a reservoir of mental refinement and riches, for the 
gaining of which we can afford to sacrifice many 
things and make many even good things subordi- 
nate. The words of the wise man in recommending 
wisdom to the sons of men are not inappropriate: 
“Hear; for I will speak of excellent things and the 
opening of my lips shall be right things, and wicked- 
ness is an abomination to my lips. Receive my 
instruction and not silver; and knowledge rather 
than choice gold. For wisdom is better than rubies;
-P-A-G-E-215
  THE USE OF MASTERPIECES AS WHOLES 205 
and all the things that may be desired are not to be 
compared to it.” 
To get at the wisdom of the best thinkers of the 
world, so far as it is accessible to children, is the 
straightforward aim of such study. The teachers of 
reading, if they but realized it, are the guardians 
of a temple more beautiful than the Parthenon in 
the days of Pericles, more impressive than the sacred 
towers and porticos at Jerusalem; they are the cus- 
todians of a treasure far more rich and lasting than 
that in any palace of a king. Such comparisons, 
indeed, are almost belittling to the dignity of our 
subject. How noble and vast is the temple of 
literature! What single mind can grasp its propor- 
tions or the boundless beauty of its decorations? 
Moreover, it is a living temple, ever springing up 
afresh, in all its pristine strength and beauty, where- 
ever minds are found reverent, studious, and thought- 
ful. 
The old proverb suggests that we “beware of 
the man of one book,” and is significant of a strong 
practical truth. Our modern life demands a some- 
what broader basis of operations than one book can 
furnish. But a few of the great books, well mastered, 
give the main elements of strength. 
Mabie has a short chapter on the “ Books of Life” 
which “include the original, creative, first-hand books 
in all literatures, and constitute in the last analysis 
a comparatively small group, with which any student
-P-A-G-E-216
206 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
can thoroughly familiarize himself. The literary 
impulse of the race has expressed itself in a great 
variety of works of varying charm and power, but 
the books which are fountain-heads of vitality, ideas, 
and beauty are few in number.” 
The effect upon the teacher of the study of a few 
of the “Books of Life” is deserving of emphasis. 
First, by limiting the choice to a few things, teachers 
are able, without burdening themselves, to penetrate 
into the deeper thought and meaning of standard 
works which are good specimens and criteria of all 
superior literature. Teachers are enabled thus to 
become, in a limited way, real students of literature. 
It has been observed, not seldom, that teachers of 
usual capacity, when turned into a single rich field 
like that of “ Hiawatha ” or the “ Merchant of Venice ”’ 
or “ The Lays of Ancient Rome” or the “ Lady of the 
Lake,” receive an awakening which means much for 
their general culture and teaching power. The scat- 
tering of the attention over miscellaneous selections 
and fragments can hardly produce this awakening. 
Certain difficulties are incident to the reading of 
longer works as wholes which it is well to recognize. 
1. There is no such nice grading of verbal and 
language difficulties as has been wrought out in 
some of the standard readers. On this point 
Scudder says (p. 41 of “ Literature in Schools”) :— 
“The drawback to the use of these nursery clas- 
sics in the schoolroom undoubtedly has been in the 
 
-P-A-G-E-217
THE USE OF MASTERPIECES AS WHOLES 207 
absence of versions which are intelligible to children 
of the proper age, reading by themselves. The 
makers of the graded reading-books have expended 
all their ingenuity in grading the ascent. They have 
been so concerned about the gradual enlargement of 
their vocabularies that they have paid slight atten- 
tion to the ideas which the words were intended to 
convey. But just this gradation may be secured 
through the use of these stories, and it only needs 
that they should be written out in a form as simple, 
especially as regards the order of words, as that 
which obtains in the reading-books of equivalent 
grade.” 
But in the longer classics for more advanced 
grades there can be no such adaptation, and the 
author’s form should be retained. The authors of 
“Rip Van Winkle” or “Snow-Bound” or “ Hora- 
tius at the Bridge” were not trying to phrase their 
thought to meet the needs of children, but wrote as 
the spirit moved them. The greater vigor and inten- 
sity of the author’s style will make up, however, in 
large part, for this defect in easy grading. Children 
are not so much afraid of big or new words, if there 
is attractiveness and power of thought. The larger 
richness and variety of language in a fruitful author 
is a positive advantage as compared with the leanness 
and dulness of many a smoothly graded reading lesson. 
2. Itis claimed that there is, in some masterpieces, 
like “ Evangeline” or one of Webster’s speeches, a 
 
-P-A-G-E-218
ee Pe eg ee el ae eee ee eT Re ee 
| 208 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
monotony and tiresome sameness which grows bur- 
densome to pupils ere the conclusion is reached. At 
least there is much less variety in style and thought 
than in an equal number of pages in the usual reader. 
In some cases there is good ground for this criti- 
cism. It may be a defect in the writer’s style, or in 
not finding a suitable selection for the class. In 
some cases it is due to lack of power in the teacher 
to bring the children properly into close contact with 
the author’s thought. 
But dulness and apathy are often found in reading 
short selections as well as in longer ones. Generally 
speaking, longer pieces are apt to kindle a deeper 
and stronger interest. Many of the longer selections 
have also great variety of rhetorical style. Dickens’s 
“Christmas Carol” is employed in one of the drill 
books in reading to illustrate all phases of voice and 
tone. 
3. It is not an unusual experience to find that a 
longer story or poem seems too hard for a class, and 
it may be impossible to interest them because of 
verbal or thought difficulties. But the teacher should 
not give up the struggle at once. Often, in a new 
author, difficulties that seem at first insurmountable 
give way before vigorous effort, and a lively interest 
is awakened. This has been noticed in Macaulay’s 
“Lays of Ancient Rome,” in Irving’s “Rip Van 
Winkle,” in Scott’s “Lady of the Lake,” also in 
Webster’s “Speech in reply to Hayne.” The teacher
-P-A-G-E-219
THE USE OF MASTERPIECES AS WHOLES 209 
should not depend wholly upon the author’s making 
himself intelligible and interesting to the children. 
His own enthusiasm, clear grasp of thought, suggest- 
ive assignment of lesson, and skill in comment and 
question should awaken insight and attention. It is 
advisable at times to pass by specially difficult pas- 
sages, or leave them for later special study. 
4. In some schools it is not possible to secure 
books containing the complete classics. But even 
the regular readers often contain complete poems 
and stories, and several of the large companies are 
publishing many of the complete masterpieces in 
good print and binding, no more expensive than 
the regular readers. 
5. The greatest difficulty, after all, is the lack of 
experience of many teachers with the longer classics. 
In many cases their inability to select what would 
suit their classes is a hindrance. But the experience 
of many teachers with these materials is rapidly set- 
tling the question as to the place and importance of 
the leading masterpieces as well as of many shorter 
selections.

CHAPTER | XI 
LirerARY MATERIALS FOR THE FIVE UpPER GRADES 
THERE is great abundance and variety of choice 
reading matter suitable for the grades from the fourth 
to the eighth inclusive. The best sets of reading- 
books have drawn from this rich material, but no 
series of readers can compass adequately the field. 
Some of the longer classical stories and poems have 
been incorporated into readers, but a single set of 
readers cannot be made large enough to contain a 
quarter of the valuable reading matter which should be 
furnishedin these grades. Thelarge publishing houses 
now supply, at moderate expense, in small and con- 
venient book form, a great variety of the very best 
complete masterpieces. In order to show more clearly 
the richness and variety of this material, we will dis- 
cuss briefly the principal kinds of reading matter which 
are distributed through these five grades. We assume 
that during the first three years of school life chil- 
dren have learned how to read, having mastered the 
forms and symbols of printed language. At the 
beginning of the fourth grade, therefore, they are 
prepared to read some of those choice literary prod- 
ucts which constitute a part of the permanent lit- 
210
-P-A-G-E-221
  LITERARY MATERIALS 211 
erature of the world. After having collected and 
arranged these products, we find that they fall into 
several distinctly marked classes. 
1. The Myths. 
These include such stories as Hawthorne’s “ Won- 
der Book” and “‘ Tanglewood Tales,” Peabody’s “ Old 
Greek Folk Stories,” Kingsley’s “ Greek Heroes,” 
“The Story of Ulysses,” Bryant’s translation of 
the “Iliad” and “Odyssey,” Pope’s “Homer,” and 
many other prose and poetic renderings of the Greek 
myths. ; 
Another group of myths include Mabie’s “Norse 
Stories,” “Heroes of Asgard, “Siegfried,” ‘Myths 
of Northern Lands,” Skinner’s “Readings in Folk 
Lore,” and many forms of the Norse myths. The 
story of “Hiawatha” belongs also, to this group, 
while some of the earlier English and Roman myths 
belong to the same class. 
' The choicest of these mythical stories are dis- 
tributed as reading matter through the fourth and 
fifth grades. They constitute a large share of the 
most famous literature of the great civilized nations. 
It is worth while to name over the virtues of these 
stories and poems. 
They have sprung directly out of the people’s 
life, they are race products, worked over from age 
to age by poetic spirits, and finally gathered into 
enduring form by a Homer, Virgil, or Spenser. 
The best of our later poets and prose masters have
-P-A-G-E-222
212 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
' 
employed their finest skill in rendering them into 
simple and poetic English, as Bryant, Kingsley, 
Longfellow, Pope, Hawthorne, Palmer, Tennyson, 
Church, and many more. 
They are the best descriptions we have of the 
customs, ideas, and dress, the homes, habits, and mo- 
tives, of the ancestral races. Many other sources, 
as temples, ruins, tombs, coins, etc., help to explain 
this early history; but this literature calls it again 
into life and puts meaning into all other sources of 
knowledge. : 
The influence which this early literature has had 
upon later historical growth of the great races is 
overwhelming, and is plain to the eyes of even un- 
scholarly persons. The root from which the marvel- 
lous tree of Greek civilization grew is seen in Homer’s 
poems. 
In these myths we find those commanding char- 
acters which typify the strength and virtues of the 
race, as Achilles, Ulysses, Siegfried, Penelope, Thor, 
Apollo, Theseus, Hiawatha, Orpheus, Diana, Vulcan, 
Prometheus, and the Muses. 
A close acquaintance with these creative ideas of 
the early world is necessary to an understanding 
of all subsequent life and literature. And it is not 
merely the names of Greek divinities and definitions 
of their character and qualities which put meaning 
into the numberless allusions of modern writers. One 
reason why many modern thinkers smile at the trite-
-P-A-G-E-223
LITERARY MATERIALS 213 
ness and childishness of Greek fable is, that they 
have not caught the spirit and meaning of the Greek 
story. The great masters of thought, like Goethe, 
Shakespeare, Emerson, Tennyson, and Bryant, have 
seen deeper. 
It is, moreover, in childhood, during the early school 
years especially, that we may best appreciate and 
enjoy these poetic creations of an early world. It is 
hardly to be expected that people whose youth has 
been clamped into the mould of commonplace and 
sensuous facts, and whose later years have been 
crusted over with modern materialism and commer- 
cialism, should listen with any patience to Orpheus 
and the Muses, or even to the wood notes of Pan. 
We hardly need to dwell upon the idea that the 
old heroic myths are the delight of boys and girls, 
and that this sympathy for the myth is the founda- 
tion of its educative power. Nor is it the purpose of 
the school to warp the minds of children into this one 
channel of growth. The historical and scientific 
studies run parallel with the myth, and give strength 
for other realities. 
It is not difficult to see that music, the drama, and 
the fine arts spring from these old myths as from 
their chief source. They furnish motive to many of 
the greatest works of dramatist, composer, painter, 
and sculptor, in all the ages since. A®schylus and 
the Greek dramatists, Goethe and Wagner, Fénelon 
and Shakespeare, drew abundantly from these sources.  
-P-A-G-E-224
214 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
A few of the striking characters of this great age 
of heroic myths should be treated with such fulness 
as to stand out clearly to the children and appeal to 
the heart as well as to the head. Ulysses and Sieg- 
fried stand in the centre of two of the chief stories, 
and exemplify great qualities of character, strength, 
wisdom, and nobleness of mind. 
In the third grade the children have had an oral 
introduction to some of the old stories, and have had 
a spirited entrance to Mythland. This oral treat- 
ment of the stories is a fitting and necessary prelude 
to the reading work of the fourth and fifth grades. 
It is more fully discussed, together with the art of 
the story-teller, in the earlier chapters of this 
book. 
Closely related to the myths, and kindred in spirit, 
are such choice reading materials as “The Arabian 
Nights,” “King of the Golden River,’ Stockton’s 
“Fanciful Tales,” “The Pied Piper,” and a number 
of shorter poems and stories found in the collections 
recommended for fourth and fifth grades. Some of 
Hawthorne’s and Irving’s stories belong also to this 
group. 
2. Ballads and Traditional Stories. 
A somewhat distinct group of the best reading for 
fourth and fifth grades is found in the historical 
ballads and national legends from the early history 
of England, Germany, Italy, and France. They in- 
clude such selections as “Sir Patrick Spens,” “The  
-P-A-G-E-225
LITERARY MATERIALS 215 
Ballads of Robin Hood,” “ Horatius,” ‘“ Bannock- 
burn,” “The Heart of the Bruce,” “The Story of 
Regulus,” of “Cincinnatus,” “Alfred the Harper,” 
and many more. In the list of books recommended 
for children’s reading are several ballad books, 
Macaulay’s “ Lays of Ancient Rome,” “The Book of 
Golden Deeds,” “Tales from English History,” and 
several others, with great variety of poem and story. 
Many of these selections are short and spirited and 
well suited to awaken the strongest enthusiasm of 
children. They are sometimes in dialogue form, 
both in prose and verse, have strong dramatic 
action, and are thus helpful in variety and force of 
expression. There is also much early history and 
national spirit involved. The old historical ballads 
and traditions have great educative value. They are 
simple, crude, and powerful, and awaken the spirit to 
receive the message of heroism. In her introduction 
to the “Ballad Book,” Katharine Lee Bates says, 
“For these primitive folk-songs, which have done 
so much to educate the poetic sense in the fine 
peasantry of Scotland—that peasantry which has 
produced an Ayrshire Ploughman and an Ettrick 
Shepherd —are assuredly, 
“Thanks to the human heart by which it lives,’ 
among the best educators that can be brought into 
our schoolrooms.” 
“The Lays of Ancient Rome,” the “ Ballads,” and
-P-A-G-E-226
216 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
the “Tales from English History” belong to the 
heroic series. Though far separated in time and 
place, they breathe the same spirit of personal energy, 
self-sacrifice, and love of country. They reveal 
manly resistance to cruelty and tyranny. We may 
begin this series with a term’s work upon Macaulay’s 
“Lays” and a few other choice stories in prose and 
verse. Thereafter we may insert other ballads, 
where needed, in connection with history, and in 
amplification of longer stories or masterpieces like 
Scott’s “Tales of a Grandfather,” and “ Marmion.” 
In the fifth grade, children are of an age when these 
stories of heroism in olden days strike a responsive 
chord. They delight in such tales, memorize them, 
and enter into the full energy of their spirited re- 
production. The main purpose at first is to appre- 
ciate their thought as an expression of history, 
tradition, and national life. A complete and absorb- 
ing study of a single series of these ballads, as of 
Macaulay’s, supplies also an excellent standard of 
comparison for other more or less similar episodes 
in the history of Switzerland, Greece, England, and 
America. 
These historical legends merge almost imper- 
ceptibly into the historical tales of early English, 
Roman, and French or German history. The patri- 
archal stories of the Old Testament furnish the 
finest of early history stories and should be included 
in these materials. “The Old Stories of the East,”
-P-A-G-E-227
LITERARY MATERIALS 217 
and “Old Testament Stories in Scripture Language” 
are among the best. 
3. Stories of Chivalry. 
Tales of chivalry, beginning with “ Arthur and his 
Round Table Knights,” ‘Roland and Oliver,” and 
other medizeval tales, have a great attraction for poets 
and children. Such books are included in our lists as 
“The Court of King Arthur,” the “ Story of Roland,” 
“Tales of Chivalry,” “The Boys’ King Arthur,” the 
“ Age of Chivalry,” and “ The Coming of Arthur” and 
“Passing of Arthur.” There are also many shorter 
poems touching this spirit of chivalry in the Ballad 
literature. The character and spirit of King Arthur 
as revealed in the matchless music of Tennyson 
should find its way to the hearts of children before 
they leave the school. Like Sir Galahad, he could 
say, 
“My strength is as the strength of ten 
Because my heart is pure.” 
4. Historical Stories and Poems. 
In the fifth and sixth grades children should begin 
to read some of the best biographical and historical 
stories of America and of European countries. Of 
these we have excellent materials from many lands 
and periods of time, such as Higginson’s “ American 
Explorers,” Morris’s “ Historical Tales” (both Ameri- 
can and English), “Stories of American Life and 
Adventure,” “ Stories of Our Country,” “ Pioneer His- 
tory Stories,’ “Ten Boys on the Road from Long
-P-A-G-E-228
218 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
Ago,” “The Story of the English,” “Stories from 
Herodotus,” “ Pilgrims and Puritans,” Hawthorne’s 
“ Biographical Stories,’ “Stories from American 
Life,” and others. 
In the oral history lessons given on alternate days 
in fourth grade (see special method in history) we 
have made a spirited entrance to American history 
through the pioneer stories of the Mississippi Valley. 
These should precede and pave the way for classic 
readings in American history. In the fifth grade, 
the stories of Columbus and of the chief navigators, 
also the narratives of the Atlantic coast pioneers, are 
told. The regular history work of the sixth grade 
should be a study of the growth of the leading 
colonies during the colonial period and the French 
and Indian Wars. 
In the fifth grade we may begin to read some of 
the hero narratives of our own pioneer epoch as 
rendered by the best writers; for instance, Higgin- 
son’s “American Explorers,” “Pilgrims and Puri- 
tans,” “ Stories of Our Country,” and “ Grandfather’s 
Chair.” They are lifelike and spirited, and intro- 
duce us to the realism of our early history in its 
rugged exposure and trials, while they bring out those 
stern but high ideals of life which the Puritan and 
the Cavalier, the navigator, the pioneer hunter, and 
explorer illustrate. Higginson’s collection of letters 
and reports of the early explorers, with their quaint 
language and eye-witness descriptions, is strikingly
-P-A-G-E-229
LITERARY MATERIALS 219 
vivid in its portraiture of early scenes upon our 
shores. Hawthorne, in “Grandfather’s Chair,” has 
moulded the hardy biography of New England leaders 
into literary form. 
5. Great Biographies. 
In addition to the shorter biographical stories just 
mentioned, as children advance into the sixth, seventh, 
and eighth grades, they should make a close acquain- 
tance with a few of the great biographies. There is 
an abundance of excellent American biographies, but 
we should limit ourselves to those most important 
and best suited to influence the character of young 
people. It is necessary also to use those which have 
been written in a style easily comprehended by the 
children. Some of the best are as follows: Scudder’s 
“Life of Washington,” Franklin’s “ Autobiography,” 
Hosmer’s “ Life of Samuel Adams,” and the lives 
of John Quincy Adams, Daniel Webster, and Lin- 
coln in the “Statesman Series.” There are two 
fairly good books of Lincoln’s early life for children. 
There are also many shorter biographies included 
in the books recommended for regular or collateral 
reading. 
In style and content the story of Franklin is 
one of the best for children. The “ Autobiog- 
raphy” of Franklin has many graphic touches 
from American life. His intense practical per- 
sonality, his many-sidedness and public spirit, make 
up a character that will long instruct and open
-P-A-G-E-230
220 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
out in many directions the minds of the young. 
His clear sense and wisdom in small affairs as in 
great, and the pleasing style of his narrative, are 
sufficiently characteristic to have a strong personal 
impression. It will hardly be necessary to take the 
whole of the “ Autobiography,” but the more attrac- 
tive parts, leaving the rest to the private reading of 
children. “ Poor Richard’s Almanac” intensifies the 
notion of Franklin’s practical and everyday wisdom, 
and at the same time introduces the children to a 
form of literature that, in colonial days, under 
Franklin’s patronage, had a wide acceptance and 
lasting influence in America. 
Plutarch’s “Lives” furnish a series of great bi- 
ographies which grammar school children should 
become well acquainted with. The lives of Ameri- 
can writers and poets should be brought to the atten- 
tion of children in conjunction with their productions. 
“The Children’s Stories of American Literature” 
and the introductory chapters of many of the master- 
pieces furnish this interesting and _ stimulating 
material. It should not be neglected by pupils and 
teachers. For older pupils and for teachers several 
of Macaulay’s “ Essays” are valuable, and the style 
is strikingly interesting. For example, the essays on 
Samuel Johnson, Lord Chatham, Milton, Addison, 
and Frederick the Great. Motley’s “ Essay on Peter 
the Great” and Carlyle’s “Essay on Burns” are of 
similar interest and value. “The Schénberg Cotta
-P-A-G-E-231
LITERARY MATERIALS 221 
Family” is valuable in the upper grammar grades. 
Most of this kind of reading must be outside refer- 
ence work if it is done at all. Teachers should, first 
of all, enrich their own experience by these read- 
ings, occasionally bring a book to the class from 
which selections may be read, and, secondly, encour- 
age the more enthusiastic and capable children to 
this wider field of reading. 
6. Historical Poems and Pictures of American 
Lie. 
Some of the best American poems and prose 
masterpieces are fine descriptions of American life 
and manners, in different parts of the country and 
at various times. Such are: “Courtship of Miles 
Standish,” “Tales of the White Hills,” ‘“Snow- 
Bound,” “Rip Van Winkle,” and “Sleepy Hollow.” 
“The Gentle Boy,” “Mabel Martin,” “Giles Corey,” 
“ Evangeline,” “Uncle Tom’s Cabin,” and some of 
the great biographies, like those of Samuel Adams, 
Franklin, Washington, and Lincoln, are also fine 
descriptions of home life in America. The same 
may be said of some of the masterpieces of English 
and European literature, for example, “Ivanhoe,” 
“Roger de Coverley,” ‘The Christmas Carol,” 
“Vicar of Wakefield,” ‘‘ William Tell,” “Silas Mar- 
ner,” “The Cotter’s Saturday Night,” and “ Schén- 
berg Cotta Family.” 
The culture value of these pictures of home and 
domestic life for young people is surpassingly great. 
   
-P-A-G-E-232
  222 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
Gradually their views are broadened, and they may 
be imbued with those social, home-bred qualities and 
virtues so fundamental in human life. 
Irving’s stories and Longfellow’s “Miles Stan- 
dish” give a still more pronounced and pleasing 
literary cast to two of the characteristic forms of 
life in our colonial history, the Puritan and the 
Dutch Patroon. If the children have reached this 
point, where they can read and enjoy the “ Sketch- 
Book,” it will be worth much as a description of life 
along the Hudson, and will develop taste and appre- 
ciation for literary excellence. Even the fanciful 
and ridiculous elements conduce to mental health 
and soundness, by showing up in pleasing satire the 
weaknesses and foibles of well-meaning people. 
“ Snow-Bound,” “Songs of Labor,” and “ Among 
the Hills,” while not historical in the usual sense, 
are still plainly American, and may well be asso- 
ciated with other poetic delineations of American 
life. ‘“Snow-Bound” is a picture of New England 
life, with its pleasing and deep-rooted memories. Its 
family spirit and idealization of common objects and 
joys make it a classic which reaches the hearts of 
boys and girls. “Among the Hills” is also a pic- 
ture of home life in New England mountains, a con- 
trast of the mean and low in home environment to 
the beauty of thrift and taste and unselfish home 
joys. The “Songs of Labor” are descriptive of the 
toils and spirit of our varied employments in New ,
-P-A-G-E-233
LITERARY MATERIALS 223 
England and of that larger New England which the 
migrating Yankees have established between the 
oceans. 
“Evangeline” is another literary pearl that en- 
shrines in sad and rhythmic measures a story of 
colonial days, and teaches several great lessons, as 
of the harshness and injustice of war, of fair-minded- 
ness and sympathy for those of alien speech and 
country, of patience and gentleness and loyalty to 
high ideals in a cherished character familiar to all. 
7. The Poetry of Nature in the Masterpieces of 
Literature. 
Both in poetic and in prose form there is great 
variety and depth of nature worship in good litera- 
ture. There are few, if any, of the great poets who 
have not been enthusiastic and sympathetic observers 
of nature, —nature lovers, we may call them. We 
can hardly mention the names of Emerson, Bryant, 
and Wordsworth, without thinking of their loving 
companionship with nature, their flight to the woods 
and fields. But the same is true of Lowell, Whittier, 
Hawthorne, Whitman, and all the rest. When we 
add to these, those companions of nature, such as 
Thoreau, Leander Keyser, Olive Thorn Miller, Bur- 
roughs, Warner, and others of like spirit, we may 
be surprised at the number of our leading writers 
who have found their chief delight in dwelling close 
to the heart of nature. 
An examination of the books recommended for 
   
-P-A-G-E-234
  224 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
children’s study and delight will reveal a large num- 
ber of the most graceful, inspiriting products of 
human thought, which are nature poems, nature 
hymns, odes to skylark, the dandelion, the mountain 
daisy, communings with the myriad moods and 
forms of the natural world. Such books as “Nature 
Pictures by American Poets,” “Golden Treasury of 
Songs and Lyrics,” “Poetry of the Seasons,” the 
“Open Sesame” books, and others, show an infinite 
variety of poetic inspiration from nature. Adding 
to these Burroughs’s “Birds and Bees,” “Wake 
Robin,” “Squirrels and other Fur-bearers”; Tho- 
reau’s “Succession of Forest Trees”; Higginson’s 
“Qutdoor Papers”; Keyser’s ‘News from the 
Birds,” “In Bird Land,” and “ Birddom”; Torrey’s 
“Footpath Way,” and “ Birds in the Bush”; Long’s 
“Wilderness Ways,” and “Ways of Wood Folk”; 
the “Plant World” of Vincent, the “ Natural His- 
tory of Selborne,” and others of like quality, — and 
we have an abundance of the most friendly and en- 
ticing invitations to nature study. These materials 
are suited, by proper arrangement, to all the grades 
from ‘the fourth up. Under good teachers such 
books can do no other than awaken and encourage 
the happiest kind of observation and sympathy for 
nature. It is the kind of appreciation of birds and 
trees, insects and clouds, which at once trains to 
close and discriminating perception, and to the culti- 
vation of zsthetic sense in color, form, and sound.

The love of nature cannot be better instilled than 
by following these poets. 
While the study of literature as it images nature 
cannot take the place of pure science, it is the most, 
powerful ally that the scientist can call in. The 
poets can do as much to idealize science study, to 
wake the dull eye, and quicken the languid interest i 
in nature, as scientists themselves. Away, then, 
with this presumed antagonism between literature 
and science! Neither is complete without the other. 
Neither can stand on its own feet. But together, in 
mutual support, they cannot be tripped up. The 
facts, the laws, the utilities, adaptations, and wonders 
in nature are not so marvellous but the poet’s eye 
will pierce beneath and above them, will give them 
a deeper interpretation, and clothe them in a gar- 
ment of beauty and praise. There is nothing beau- 
tiful or grand or praiseworthy that the poet’s eye 
will not detect it, and the poet’s art reveal it in 
living and lasting forms. Let the scientist delve 
and the poet sing. The messages between them 
should be only those of cheer. 
It is in this myriad-voiced world of fields and 
brooks, of mountain, lake, and river, of storm and 
cloud and of the changing seasons, that poets find 
the images, suggestions, and analogies which inter- 
pret and illustrate the spiritual life of man. The 
more rigid study of science in laboratory and class- 
room is necessary to the student, but it would be a

narrow and pedantic teacher who would not welcome 
the poetic temper and enthusiasm in nature study. 
The teachers of reading have, therefore, the best 
of all opportunities for cultivating this many-sided 
sympathy for and insight into nature, and at the 
same time to train the children to correlate these 
nature poems with their science studies. Observers 
like Thoreau and Burroughs give us the greatest 
inducement for getting out into the woods. They 
open our eyes to the beauties and our hearts to the 
truth of nature’s teachings. These are the gardens 
of delight where science and poetry walk hand in 
hand and speak face to face. It would not be diffi- 
cult to show that many of the greatest scientists 
were poets, and that some of the chiefest poets have 
been foremost in scientific study. 
8. The Sentiment of Patriotism in Literature. 
The powerful national spirit finds expression in 
many forms of literature, in hymns, in war song, in 
oration, in essay, in pioneer narrative, in stories of bat- 
tle, in novel, in flag song, in ballad, and in biography. 
We have already noted the great significance of 
American history stories in fourth and fifth grades. 
It is from the early pioneer epoch and the colonial 
history that we derive much of our best educative 
history. The heroism of these old days has been 
commemorated in story and poem by our best writers. 
As we approach the Revolutionary crisis a new body 
of choice literary products, aglow with the fire of patri-
-P-A-G-E-237
LITERARY MATERIALS 227 
otism and independence, is found stored up for the joy 
and stimulus of our growing young Americans: “ Paul 
Revere’s Ride,” ‘“Grandmother’s Story of Bunker 
Hill,’ Washington’s letters, “A Ballad of the Boston 
Tea Party,” “ Ode for Washington’s Birthday,” “ Lex- 
ington” (Holmes), “The Song of Marion’s Men,” 
“The Green Mountain Boys,” Webster’s speeches 
at Bunker Hill and on Adams and Jefferson, “Old 
Ticonderoga” (Hawthorne), Burke’s speech on the 
American War, Washington’s “Farewell to the 
Army,” The Declaration of Independence, “ Under 
the Old Elm,” and descriptions of some of the great 
scenes of the war by our best historians. 
It is to be desired that children in the seventh 
grade may have opportunity in regular history lessons 
to study in detail a few of the central topics of the 
Revolutionary epoch. This will put them in touch 
with the spirit and surroundings of the Americans. 
In the reading lessons of the same grade we may 
well afford to discover and feel what our best patriots 
and men of letters have said and felt in view of the 
struggle for freedom. The noblest expressions of 
sentiment upon great men and their achievements 
are contagious with the young. Patriotism can find 
no better soil in which to strike its deepest roots than 
the noble outbursts of our orators and poets and 
patriotic statesmen. The cumulative effect of these 
varied but kindred materials is greater than when 
scattered and disconnected. They mutually support 
 
-P-A-G-E-238
  228 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
each other, and when they are brought into close 
dependence upon parallel historical studies, we may 
well say that the children are drinking from the deep 
and pure sources of true Americanism. 
Parallel to whatever history we attempt to teach in 
the eighth grade should run a selection of the best 
literary_products that, our American authors can 
furnish, and here again we are rich in resources. 
The thought and life of our people find their high- 
water mark in the poet’s clarion note and the states- 
man’s impassioned appeal. No others have perceived 
the destiny of our young republic as our cherished 
poets, Longfellow, Whittier, Bryant, Holmes, and 
Emerson. They have stood upon the mountain tops, 
looking far and wide through the clear atmosphere, 
while the great army of the people has been tenting 
in the valleys below. These wakeful priests and 
prophets have caught the bright tints of the morning 
while the people were still asleep, and have witnessed 
the suffused glory of the sunset clouds when the 
weary masses below had already forgotten the day’s 
toil. One thing at least, and that the greatest, can be 
done for our children before they finish the common 
school course. They may rise into this pure atmos- 
phere of poet, patriot, sage, and prophet. They may 
hear these deathless strains and feel the thrill of these 
ringing notes. Let their ears be once attuned to the 
strength and harmony of this music, and it will not 
cease to echo in their inner life. The future  
-P-A-G-E-239
  LITERARY MATERIALS 229 
patriots will be at hand, and the coming years will see 
them rising to the great duties that inevitably await 
them. We have a body of noble, patriotic material 
which is capable of producing this effect if handled 
by skilful teachers: the Ordinance of 1787, The 
Federalist, Numbers 1 and 2, Washington’s “In- 
augurals” and the “ Farewell Address,” Everett’s 
“Oration on Washington,” “O Mother of Mighty 
Race” (Bryant); “Our Country’s Call” (Bryant) ; 
“Abraham Lincoln” (Bryant); Lincoln’s “ Inaugu- 
rals” and “Gettysburg Speech,” “ Army Hymn” and 
“ The Flower of Liberty” (Holmes), Webster’s “ Sec- 
ond Speech on Foot’s Resolution,” The Emancipation 
Proclamation, “The Fortune of the Republic” 
(Emerson), etc., “ Antiquity of Freedom” (Bryant) ; 
“Centennial Hymn” (Whittier); “The Building of 
the Ship” (Longfellow) ; “The Poor Voter on Elec- 
tion Day” (Whittier). 
Why not gather together these sources of power, 
of unselfish patriotism, of self-sacrifice, of noble and 
inspiring impulse? Let this fruit-bringing seed be 
sown deep in the minds and hearts of the receptive 
young. What has inspired the best of men to high 
thinking and living can touch them. 
It is not by reading and declaiming a few miscel- 
laneous fragments of patriotic gush, not by waving 
flags and banners and following processions, that the 
deeper sentiments of patriotism and humanity are to 
be touched, but by gathering and concentrating these 
 
-P-A-G-E-240
230 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING | 
fuller, richer sources of spiritual power and conscious 
national destiny. The schoolroom is by far the best 
place to consolidate these purifying and conserving 
sentiments. By gathering into a rising series and 
focussing in the higher grades the various forms, in 
prose and verse, in which the genius of our country 
has found its strongest expression; by associating 
these ringing sentiments with the epochs and crises 
of our history, with the valorous deeds of patriots 
upon the field and of statesmen in the senate, with 
the life and longings of home-nurtured poets and 
sages, — we shall plant seed whose fruitage will not 
disappoint the lovers of the fatherland. 
Mr. Horace E. Scudder, in his two essays on 
“ Literature” and “ American Classics in the Common 
School,” has portrayed with convincing clearness the 
spiritual power and high-toned Americanism which 
breathe from those literary monuments which have 
been quarried from our own hillsides and chiselled by 
American hands. We recommend to every teacher 
the reading in full of these essays, from which we 
quote at much length :— 
“Fifty years ago there were living in America six - 
men of mark, of whom the youngest was then nine- 
teen years of age, the oldest forty-four. Three of 
the six are in their graves and three still breathe the 
kindly air. [Since this was written, in 1888, the last 
of the six has passed away.] One only of the six 
has held high place in the national councils, and it is

not by that distinction that he is known and loved. 
They have not been in battle; they have had no 
armies at their command; they have not amassed 
great fortunes, nor have great industries waited on 
their movements. Those pageants of circumstances 
which kindle the imagination have been remote from 
their names. They were born on American soil; 
they have breathed American air; they were nurtured 
on American ideas. They are Americans of Ameri- 
cans. They are as truly the issue of our national 
life as are the common schools in which we glory. 
During the fifty years in which our common school 
system has been growing up to maturity these six 
have lived and sung; and I dare say that the lives 
and songs of Bryant, Emerson, Longfellow, Whittier, 
Holmes, and Lowell have an imperishable value, 
regarded as exponents of national life, not for a 
moment to be outweighed in the balance by the most 
elaborate system of common schools which the wit of 
man may devise. The nation may command armies 
and schools to rise from the soil, but it cannot call 
into life a poet. Yet when the poet comes and we 
hear his voice in the upper air, then we know the 
nation he owns is worthy of the name. Do men 
gather grapes of thorns or figs of thistles? Even so, 
pure poetry springs from no rank soil of national 
life. 
“T am not arguing for the critical study of our 
great authors, in the higher grades of our schools. 
 
-P-A-G-E-242
  232 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
They are not the best subjects for critical scholav. 
ship ; criticism demands greater remoteness, greater 
foreignness of nature. Moreover, critical study is 
not the surest method of securing the full measure 
of spiritual light, though it yields abundant gain in 
the refinement of the intellectual nature and in the 
quickening of the perceptive faculties. I am arguing 
for the free, generous use of these authors in the 
principal years of school life. It is then that their 
power is most profoundly needed, and will be most 
strongly felt. We need to put our children in their 
impressionable years into instant and close connec- 
tion with the highest manifestation of our national 
life. Away with the bottle and the tube! Give 
them a lusty draft at the mother’s full breast! 
“Nor do I fear that such a course will breed a 
narrow and parochial Americanism. On the con- 
trary, it would destroy a vulgar pride in country, 
help the young to see humanity from the heights 
on which the masters of song have dwelt, and open 
the mind to the more hospitable entertainment of 
the best literature of every clime and age. I am 
convinced that there is no surer way to introduce 
the best English literature into our schools than to 
give the place of honor to American literature. *In 
the order of nature a youth must be a citizen of his 
own country before he can become naturalized in the 
world. We recognize this in our geography and his- 
tory; we may wisely recognize it also in our reading.
-P-A-G-E-243

“The place, then, of literature in our common 
school education is in spiritualizing life, letting light 
into the mind, inspiring and feeding the higher forces 
of human nature. 
“Tt is the business of the old to transmit to the 
young the great traditions of the past of the country, 
to feed anew the undying flame of patriotism. There 
is the element of destiny. No nation lives upon its 
past; it is already dead when it says, ‘Let us eat and 
drink to-day; for to-morrow we die.’ But what that 
destiny is to be may be read in the ideals which the 
young are forming; and those ideals, again, it is 
the business of the old to guide. They cannot form 
them; the young must form them for themselves; 
but whether these ideals shall be large or petty, 
honorable or mean, will depend upon the sustenance 
on which they are fed. 
“Now in a democracy, more signally than under 
any other form of national organization, it is vitally nec- 
essary that there should be an unceasing, unimpeded 
circulation of the spiritual life of the people. The 
sacrifice of the men and women who have made 
and preserved America, from the days of Virginia 
and New England to this hour, has been ascending 
from the earth in a never-ending cloud; they have 
fallen again in strains of music, in sculpture, in 
painting, in memorial hall, in tale, in oration, in 
poem, in consecration of life; and the spirit which 
ascended is the same as that which descended. In
-P-A-G-E-244
    234 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
literature above all is this spirit enshrined. You 
have but to throw open the shrine, and the spirit 
comes with its outspread blessings upon millions of 
waiting souls. Entering them, it reissues in count- 
less shapes, and thus is the life.of the nation in its 
highest form kept ever in motion, and without motion 
is no life. 
“The deposit of nationality is in laws, institutions, 
art, character, and religion; but laws, institutions, 
character, and religion are expressed through art 
and mainly through the art of letters. It is litera- 
ture, therefore, that holds in precipitation the genius 
of the country; and the higher the form of literature, 
the more consummate the expression of that spirit 
which does not so much seek a materialization as 
it shapes itself inevitably in fitting form. Long may 
we read and ponder the life of Washington, yet at 
last fall back content upon those graphic lines of 
Lowell in ‘Under the Old Elm,’ which cause the 
figure of the great American to outline itself upon 
the imagination with large and strong portraiture. 
The spirit of the orations of Webster and Benton, 
the whole history of the young giant poised in con- 
scious strength before his triumphant struggle, one 
may catch in a breath in those glowing lines which end 
‘The Building of the Ship.’ The deep passion of the 
war for the Union may be overlooked in some formal 
study of battles and campaigns, but rises pure, strong, 
and flaming in the immortal ‘ Gettysburg Speech.’
-P-A-G-E-245

“Precisely thus the sentiment of patriotism must 
be kept fresh and living in the hearts of the young 
through quick and immediate contact with the 
sources of that sentiment; and the most helpful 
means are those spiritual deposits of patriotism 
which we find in noble poetry and lofty prose, as 
communicated by men who have lived patriotic lives 
and been fed with coals from the altar. 
“It is from the men and women bred on American 
soil that the fittest words come for the spiritual en- 
richment of American youth. I believe heartily in 
the advantage of enlarging one’s horizon by taking 
in other climes and other ages, but first let us make 
sure of that great expansive power which lies close 
at hand. Iam sure there never was a time or coun- 
try where national education, under the guidance 
of national art and thought, was so possible as in 
America to-day. 
“The body of wholesome, strong American litera- 
ture is large enough to make it possible to keep boys 
and girls upon it from the time when they begin to 
recognize the element of authorship until they leave 
the school, and it is varied and flexible enough to 
give employment to the mind in all its stages of 
development. Moreover, this literature is interest- 
ing, and is allied with interesting concerns; half the 
hard places are overcome by the willing mind, and 
the boy who stumbles over some jejune lesson in his 
reading-book will run over a bit of genuine prose

from Irving which the schoolbook maker, with his 
calipers, pronounces too hard. 
“We have gone quite far enough in the mechani- 
cal development of the common school system. 
What we most need is the breath of life, and reading 
offers the noblest means for receiving and imparting 
this breath of life. The spiritual element in educa- 
tion in our common schools will be found to lie in 
reserve in literature, and, as I believe, most effec- 
tively in American literature. 
“Think fora moment of that great, silent, resist- 
less power for good which might at this moment be 
lifting the youth of the country, were the hours for 
reading in school expended upon the undying, life- 
giving books! Think of the substantial growth of 
a generous Americanism, were the boys and girls 
to be fed from the fresh springs of American litera- 
ture! It would be no narrow provincialism into 
which they would emerge. The windows in Long- 
fellow’s mind looked to the east, and the children 
who have entered into possession of his wealth travel 
far. Bryant’s flight carries one trough upper air, 
over broad champaigns. The lover of Emerson has 
learned to get a remote vision. The companion of 
Thoreau finds Concord become suddenly the centre 
of a very wide horizon. Irving has annexed Spain 
to America. Hawthorne has nationalized the gods 
of Greece and given an atmosphere to New England. 
Whittier has translated the Hebrew Scriptures into

the American dialect. Lowell gives the American 
boy an academy without cutting down a stick of 
timber in the grove, or disturbing the birds. Holmes 
supplies that hickory which makes one careless 
of the crackling of thorns. Franklin makes the 
America of a past generation a part of the great 
world before treaties had bound the floating states 
into formal connection with venerable nations. 
What is all this but saying that the rich inheritance 
we have is no local ten-acre lot, but a part of the 
undivided estate of humanity. Universality, Cosmo- 
politanism, — these are fine words, but no man ever 
secured the freedom of the Universe who did not 
first pay taxes and vote in his own village.” — “ Lit- 
erature in School” (Houghton, Mifflin, & Co.). 
9. The series of American classics is nowise con- 
fined to the ideas of local or national patriotism, but 
above and beyond that deep and powerful sentiment 
which magnifies the opportunity and manifest destiny 
of our nation, it grasps at the ideal form and content 
of those Christian virtues which now and evermore 
carry healing and comfort to the toiling millions. 
Our poets, as they have pondered on the past and 
looked into the future, were not able to be content 
with less than the best. As the vision of the com- 
ing years unrolled itself before them they looked 
upon it with joy mingled with solicitude. In the 
mighty conflicts now upon us only those of generous 
and saintly purpose and of pure hearts can prevail.

“Brief is the time, I know, 
The warfare scarce begun ; 
Yet all may win the triumphs thou hast won. 
Still flows the fount whose waters strengthened thee, 
The victors’ names are yet too few to fill 
Heaven’s mighty roll; the glorious armory 
That ministered to thee is open still.” — BRYANT. 
To reveal this Christian armory, the defences of 
the soul against the assaults of evil, has been the 
highest inspiration of our poets. What depth and 
beauty and impersonation of Christian virtues do we 
find in “Snow-Bound,” “ Among the Hills,” “Evange- 
line, “The Conqueror’s Grave,” “To a Waterfowl,” 
“The Groves were God’s First Temples,” “ The Liv- 
ing Temple,” “The Sun Day Hymn,” “The Cham- 
bered Nautilus,” “Vision of Sir Launfal,” “The 
Great Stone Face.” 
The Bible is not generally admissible as a school- 
book, but the spirit of Christianity, clad in the forms 
of strength and grace, is immanent in the works of 
our poets. So universal, so human, so fit.to the 
needs and destinies of men, are the truths of the 
great evangel, that the prophets and seers of our 
race drift evermore into the sheltering haven they 
supply. To drink in these potent truths through 
poetry and song, to see them enshrined in the im- 
agery and fervor of the sacred masterpieces of our 
literature, is more than culture, more than morality ; 
it is the portal and sanctuary of religious thought, 
and children may enter it.

10. The higher products of literature contain an 
energy that quickens spiritual life in morals, in art, 
and in religion. To many people, whose lives are 
submerged in commercial pursuits or in the great 
struggle to develop and utilize the material resources 
of the world, these spiritual forces seem vague and © 
shadowy, if not mythical. But there are plenty of 
heroic souls in the realm of letters, such as Emerson, 
Scudder, Ruskin, Arnold, and Carlyle, who are not 
disposed to let men settle down in lazy satisfaction 
with material good, nor to be blinded even by the 
splendor of modern achievements in engineering, 
in medicine, and in the application of electricity. 
We must at least reach a point of view high enough 
to perceive the relations of these natural riches to 
the higher nature and destiny of man. 
Scudder says, “It is to literature that we must 
look for the substantial protection of the growing 
mind against an ignoble, material conception of life, 
and for the inspiring power which shall lift the 
nature into its rightful fellowship with whatsoever 
is noble, true, lovely, and of good report.” 
Shelley, in like spirit, says: “The cultivation of 
poetry is never more to be desired than at periods 
when, from an excess of the selfish and calculating 
principle, the accumulation of the materials of ex- 
ternal life exceed the quantity of the power of as- 
similating them to the internal laws of human nature. 
The body has then become too unwieldy for that 
which animates it.”
-P-A-G-E-250
  240 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
Matthew Arnold, in “ Sweetness and Light,” while 
discussing the function of that truer culture and “ per- 
fection which consists in becoming something rather 
than in having something,” remarks : — 
“ And this function is particularly important in our 
modern world, of which the whole civilization is, to a 
much greater degree than the civilization of Greece 
and Rome, mechanical and external, and tends con- 
stantly to become more so. But above all in our own 
country has culture a weighty part to perform because 
here that mechanical character, which civilization 
tends to take everywhere, is shown in the most emi- 
nent degree. Indeed, nearly all the characters of 
perfection, as culture teaches us to fix them, meet in 
this country with some powerful tendency which 
thwarts them and sets them at defiance. The idea 
of perfection as an inward condition of the mind and 
spirit is at variance with the mechanical and material 
civilization in esteem with us, and nowhere, as I have 
said, so much in esteem as with us.” 
11. Judged by these higher standards our writers 
and literary leaders were not simply Americans. They 
were also Europeans. The Puritan brought his reli- 
gion with him, the Cavalier acquired his gentlemanly 
instincts in the old home, not in the untrodden forests 
of the New World. Much of what we call American 
is the wine of the Old World poured into the bear- 
skins and buckskins of the West, with a flavor of the 
freedom of our Western wilds. Though born and
-P-A-G-E-251
LITERARY MATERIALS 241 
bred on American soil and to the last exemplars of 
the American spirit, our literary leaders have derived 
their ideas and inspiration from the literature, tradi- 
tion, and history of the Old World. It will be no 
small part of our purpose, therefore, to open up to 
the children of our common schools the best entrance 
to the history and literature of Europe. Our own 
writers and poets have done this for us in a variety of 
instances: Hawthorne’s rendering of the Greek myths, 
Bryant’s translation of the “Iliad” and “ Odyssey,” 
a good half of Irving’s “Sketch-Book,” Lowell’s 
“Vision of Sir Launfal,” “ Aladdin,” and ‘“ Prome- 
theus,” Irving’s “Alhambra,” Longfellow’s “Golden 
Legend,” “Sandalphon,” Taylor’s “Boys of Other 
Countries.” Nearly the whole of our literature, even 
when dealing ostensibly with American topics, is suf- 
fused with the spirit and imagery of the Old World 
traditions. There is also a large collection of prose 
versions of European traditions, which, while not 
classic, are still lively renderings of old stories and 
well suited to the collateral reading of children. Such 
are “Gods and Heroes,” “Tales from English His- 
tory,” “Tales from Spenser,” “Heroes of Asgard,” 
“Story of the Iliad and Odyssey.” 
The transition from our own poets who have 
handled European themes to English writers who 
have done the same, is easy and natural; Macaulay’s 
“Lays of Ancient Rome,” Scott’s “Tales of a Grand- 
father,” “The Stories of Waverley,” the ‘Christmas 
R  
-P-A-G-E-252

Carol,” Kingsley’s “Greek Heroes’”” and “ Water 
Babies,” Ruskin’s “King of the Golden River,” 
“Lady of the Lake,” “ Marmion,” “ Roger de Coverley 
Papers,” “Merchant of Venice,” “ Arabian Nights,” 
“Peasant and Prince,” 
ress,” “ Gulliver’s Travels,’ and others have become 
by inheritance and birthright as much a part of the 
American child’s culture as the more distinctive prod- 
_ucts of our own writers. No line can be drawn be- 
tween those writings which are American and those 
which sprung from the soil of England and Europe. 
So intimate and vital is the connection between our 
present and our past, between our children and their 
cousins across the water. | . 
These American and European literary products lie 
side by side in the school course, though the predomi- 
nating spirit through the middle and higher grades 
up to the eighth should be American. We have 
noticed that in the earlier grades most of our classic Bunyan’s “ Pilgrim’s Prog- 
reading matter comes from Europe, the nursery 
rhymes, the folk-lore, fables, and myths, because 
the childhood of our culture periods was in Europe. 
But into the fourth grade, and from there on, begin- 
ning with the pioneers on sea and land, our American 
history and literature enters as a powerful agent of 
culture. It brings us into quick and vital contact, not 
simply with the outward facts, but with the inmost 
“spirit, of our national life and struggle toward de- 
velopment. This gives the American impulse free
-P-A-G-E-253
LITERARY MATERIALS 243 
and full expansion, and fortunate are we, beyond 
expression, that pure and lofty poets stand at the 
threshold to usher the children into this realm, 
founded deep in the realism of our past history and 
rising grandly into the idealism of our desires and 
hopes. As we advance into the sixth, seventh, 
and eighth grades the literature of Europe begins 
again to increase in quantity and influence, and to 
share equally with American authors the attention 
of the children. 
The Americanism of our poets and prose writers, 
as previously shown, has also another side to it, which 
is one sign of the breadth and many-sidedness of lit- 
erature as a study for the young. North America is 
a land rich in variety of natural scenery and resource. 
Nature has decked the New World with a lavish hand, 
forest and mountain, lake and river, prairie and 
desert, the summer land of flowers and the home of 
New England winters. The masterpieces of our poets 
are full of the scenery, vegetation, sunsets, mountains, 
and prairies of the Western empire. The flowers, the 
birds, the wild beasts, the pathless forests, the limit- 
less stretches of plain, have mirrored themselves in 
the songs of our poets, and have rendered them 
dearer to us because seen and realized in this ideal- 
ism. Unconsciously perhaps the feeling of patri- 
otism is largely based upon this knowledge of the 
rich and varied beauty and bounty of our native 
land.

“T love thy rocks and rills, 
Thy woods and templed hills, 
My heart with rapture thrills, 
Like that above.” 
As along the shores of our Northern lakes the clear 
and quiet waters reflect the green banks, the rolling, 
forest-crowned hills, the rocky bluffs, the floating 
clouds, and overarching blue, so in the homespun, 
classic verse and prose of our own writers are imaged 
the myriad charms of our native land. Bryant 
especially is the poet of forest and glade, “The For- 
est Hymn,” “The Death of the Flowers,” “The Re- 
turn of the Birds,’ “A Summer Ramble,” “The 
Fringed Gentian,” “The Hunter of the Prairies,” 
“The White-footed Deer,’ “To a Waterfowl,” 
“ Thanatopsis,” and many others. Longfellow’s 
“Hiawatha,” “Evangeline”; Whittier’s “ Barefoot 
Boy,” “Songs of Labor,” “Among the Hills,” and 
“Snow-Bound”; Hawthorne's “Tales of the White 
Hills” ; Holmes’s “ Spring”’; Lowell’s “Indian Sum- 
mer Reverie,” “The Oak,” and many more. 
The literature selected for these grades has a wide 
scope. It is instinct with the best Americanism. It 
draws from Europe at every breath, while enjoying 
the freedom of the West. Social, political, and home 
life and virtue are portrayed in great variety of dress. 
Nature also and natural science reveal the myriad 
forms of beauty and utility.

1. Preparation. 
There is a strong comfort in the idea that in the 
preparation of a masterpiece for a reading class the 
teacher may be dealing with a unity of thought in a 
variety of relations that makes the study a compre- 
hensive culture-product both to herself and to the 
children. To become a student of “Hiawatha” as a 
whole, and in its relations to Indian life and tradition, 
early aboriginal history, and Longfellow’s connection 
with the same, is to throw a glance into history 
and anthropology, and to recognize literature as the 
permanent form of expressing their spirit. There 
are a good many side-lights that a teacher needs to 
get from history and other literature, and from the 
author’s life, in order to see a literary masterpiece in 
its true setting. It is the part of the poet to make 
his work intensely real and ideal, the two elements 
that appeal with trenchant force to children. The 
teacher needs not only to see the graphic pictures 
drawn by the artist, but to gather about these central 
points of view other collateral, explanatory facts that 
give a deeper setting to the picture. Fortunately, 
245 
 
-P-A-G-E-256
  * 
246 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
such study as this is not burdensome. There is a 
joyousness and sparkle to it that can relieve many 
an hour of tedium. Literature in its best forms is 
recreation, and brings an infusion of spiritual energy. 
We should not allow ourselves to confuse it with 
those more humdrum forms of school employment, 
like spelling, figuring, reading in the formal sense, 
grammar, writing, etc. Literature is the spiritual 
side of school effort, the uplands of thought, where 
gushing springs well from the roots and shade of 
overarching trees. . There is jollity and music, beauty 
and grandeur, the freshness of cool breezes and of ~ 
mountain scenery, in such profusion as to satisfy the 
exuberance of youthful spirit, and to infuse new 
energy into old and tired natures. If the teacher 
can only get out of the narrow streets of the town 
and from between the dead walls of the schoolroom, 
up among the meadows and groves and brooks, in 
company with Bryant or Longfellow or Whittier, if she 
can only take a draught of these spirit-waters before 
walking into the schoolroom, her thought and con- 
duct will be tempered into a fit instrument of culture. 
The teacher’s preparation is not only in the intel- 
lectual grasp of the thought, but in the sympathy, 
feeling, and pleasure germane to a classic. The 
zesthetic and emotional elements, the charm of poetry, 
and the sparkle of wit and glint of literary elegance 
and aptness are what give relish and delight to true 
literary products. Literature appeals to the whole
-P-A-G-E-257
CLASS-ROOM METHOD IN READING 247 
nature and not to the intellect alone. It is not super- 
ficial and formal, but deep and spiritual. The teacher 
who reads a classic like ‘‘ Marmion,” thoughtfully 
dwelling upon the historic pictures, calling to mind 
other of Scott’s stories and the earlier struggle be- 
tween Scotland and England, is drinking at the fresh 
fountains and sources of some of the best parts of 
European history. The clear and rock-rimmed lakes 
of Scotland, her rugged mountains and ruined castle 
walls, are not more delightful to the traveller than the 
pictures of life and history that appear in “Tales of 
a Grandfather,” “ Rob Roy,” “ Marmion,” and “ Lady 
of the Lake.” To paint these stirring panoramic 
views of Scotch adventure and prowess upon the 
imagination of the young is to invigorate their thought 
with the real sentiment of patriotism, and with appre- 
ciation for manly struggle, endurance, and spirit. 
The vivid insight it gives into feudal society in 
church and court and castle, on battle-field and in 
dining hall, among the rude peasantry and the unlet- 
tered nobility, is found more lifelike and lasting 
than the usual results of historical study. 
The moment we take a longer masterpiece and 
examine it as a representative piece of human life, or 
as a typical portraiture of a historical epoch, it 
becomes the converging point for much lively and 
suggestive knowledge, deep and strong social inter- 
ests, and convincing personification of moral impulses. 
The best preparation, therefore, a teacher can make 
 
-P-A-G-E-258
248 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
for a class is a spiritual and spirited one. At first 
the linguistic, formal, verbal mastery of literature, its 
critical examination, even its elocution, should remain 
in the background both for teacher and children, 
Let the direct impress of the thought, motive, and 
emotion of the characters be unimpeded; give the 
author a chance to speak direct to the hearts of the 
children, and the avenue toward the desired results in 
formal reading will be left wide open. 
We would not deny that a certain labor is required 
of the teacher in such preparation. But, in the main, 
it is a refreshing kind of labor. If it brings a feel- 
ing of weariness, it is the kind that conduces to 
sound and healthy sleep, It invokes a feeling of 
inward power and of accumulated rich resource that 
helps us to meet with confidence the emergencies 
and opportunities of instruction. 
2. Inthe assignment of the lesson the teacher has a 
chance to give the children a glimpse of the pleasure 
that awaits them, and to catch a little of the enthu- 
siasm which her own study has awakened. This 
should be done briefly and by significant suggestion, 
In first introducing a longer work, it will pay to 
occupy more than is usual in recitations in opening 
up the new subject; if it is historical, in locating the 
time, circumstances, and geographical setting. The 
chief aim of the assignment should be to awaken 
curiosity and interest which may be strong enough to 
lead to a full and appreciative study of the lesson.
-P-A-G-E-259
CLASS-ROOM METHOD IN READING 249 
A second aim of the assignment is to pave the way 
to an easier mastery of verbal difficulties that arise, 
such as new and difficult words, obscure or involved 
passages. The first aim is a substantial and fruitful 
one. It approaches the whole reading lesson from 
the side of interest and spirit. It seeks to plant 
direct incentives and suggestions deep enough in the 
mind to start effort. The assignment should take it 
for granted that natural interest and absorption in 
the thought will lead directly to that kind of vigorous 
effort and mastery that will secure natural and ex- 
pressive oral reading. Look well to the deeper 
springs of thought and action, and the formal read- 
ing will open just the avenue needed to realize good 
expression. 
Skill, originality, and teaching art are much needed 
in the assignment. It is not how much the teacher 
says, but the suggestiveness of it, the problems 
raised, the questions whose answers lie in the. exam- 
ination of the lesson. The reference to previous 
readings which bear resemblance to this selection; 
the inquiry into children’s experiences, sets them to 
thinking. 
Sometimes it pays to spend five or ten minutes in 
attacking the difficult words and meanings of the 
lesson assigned. Let the class read on and discover 
words or phrases that puzzle them. Let difficult 
forms be put on the board and syllabicated if neces- 
sary. A brief study of synonymous words and 
phrases may be in place. Ma
-P-A-G-E-260
  250 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
It is a mistake to decline all helpful and sugges. 
tive study of the next lesson in class, on the ground 
that it invalidates the self-activity of children. Self- 
activity is, indeed, the chief aim of a good assign- 
ment. It is designed to stimulate the children to 
energetic and well-directed effort. Self-activity is 
not encouraged by requiring children to struggle 
with obstacles they have not the ability to surmount. 
Pronouncing new words and searching for dictionary 
meanings is often made a mechanical labor which is 
irksome and largely fruitless, because the wrong 
pronunciations are learned and the definitions do 
not fit. Before children are required to use the dic- 
tionary in pronouncing and defining words, they need 
careful exercises in how to use and to interpret the 
dictionary. 
The teacher needs to make a study of the art of 
assigning lessons. Clearness and simplicity, so as to 
give no ground for misunderstandings, are the result 
of thoughtful preparation on the teacher’s part. 
There is always danger of giving too much or too 
little, of carelessness and unsteady requirements, 
overburdening the children one day, and even for- 
getting the next day to assign a definite task. The 
forethought and precision with which a teacher 
assigns her lessons is one of the best tests of her 
prudence and success in teaching. 
It is necessary also to be on one’s guard against — 
hasty assignments. Even when proper care has
-P-A-G-E-261
CLASS-ROOM METHOD IN READING 251 
been taken in planning the next.lesson, the time 
slips by with urgent work, and the signal for dis- 
missal comes before time has been taken for any 
clear assignment. 
If the teacher knows just what references will 
throw added light upon the lesson, what books and 
pages will be directly helpful, if he can appoint dif- 
ferent pupils to look up particular references and 
sometimes even go to the library with them and 
search for the references, in grades from the fifth 
through the eighth, the result may be very helpful. 
In the class recitation it is necessary to gather up 
the fruits of this reference work with as little waste 
of time as possible, recognizing that it is purely 
collateral to the main purpose. 
Pictures and maps are useful oftentimes as refer- 
ences. As children advance in the grades, they are 
capable of greater independence and judgment in the 
use of such materials. General, loose, and indefinite 
references are a sign of ignorance, carelessness, and 
lack of preparation on the teacher’s part. They are 
discouraging and unprofitable to children. But we 
desire to see children broadening their views, extend- 
ing their knowledge of books and of how to use them. 
The amount of good literature that can be well 
treated and read in the class is small, but much sug- 
gestive outside home and vacation reading may be 
encouraged, that will open a still wider and richer 
area of personal study.
-P-A-G-E-262
  252 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
3. In spite of all the precautions of the teacher, in 
spite of lively interest and intelligent study by the 
children, there will be many haltings and blunders, 
many inaccuracies in the use of eye and voice. 
These faults spring partly from habit and previous 
home influences. The worst faults are often those 
of which a child is unconscious, so habitual have they 
become. If we are to meet these difficulties wisely, 
we must start and keep up a strong momentum in 
the class. There should be a steady and strong 
current of effort in which all share. This depends, 
- as has been often said, upon the power of the selec- 
tion to awaken the thought and feeling of the chil- 
dren. It depends equally upon the pervasive spirit 
and energy of the teacher. If we try to analyze this 
complex phenomenon, we may find that, so far as the 
children are concerned, two elements are present, 
natural and spontaneous absorption in the ideas and 
sensibilities awakened by the author, and the bracing 
conviction that sustained effort is expected and re- 
quired by the teacher. Children, to read well, must 
be free; they must feel the force of ideas and of the 
emotions and convictions awakened by them. They 
must also be conscious of that kind of authority and 
control which insists upon serious and sustained 
effort. Freedom to exercise their own powers and 
obedience to a controlling influence are needful. If 
the teacher can secure this right movement and fer- 
ment in a class, she will be able to correct the errors
-P-A-G-E-263
ee CLASS-ROOM METHOD IN READING 253 
and change bad habits into the desired form of ex- 
pression. The correction of errors, in the main, 
should be quiet, incidental, suggestive, not disturbing 
the child’s thought and effort, not destroying the 
momentum of his sentiment and feeling. Let him 
move on firmly and vigorously ; only direct his move- 
ment here and there, modify his tone by easy sugges- 
tions and pertinent questions, and encourage him as 
far as possible in his own effort to appreciate and 
express the author’s idea. 
In reading lessons there are certain purely formal 
exercises that are very helpful. The single and con- 
cert pronunciation of difficult or unusual words that 
come up in old and new lessons, the vocal exercises 
in syllabication and in vowel and consonant drill, are 
examples. They should be quick and vigorous, and 
preliminary to their application in lessons. 
4. The teacher is only a guide and interpreter. 
With plenty of reserve power, he should only draw 
upon it occasionally. His chief business is not to 
show the children how to read by example, nor to be 
always explaining and amplifying the thought of the 
author. His aim should be to best call the minds of 
the children into strong action through the stimula- 
tion of the author’s thought, and to go a step farther 
and reproduce and mould this thought into oral 
expression. 
In order to call out the best efforts of children, a 
teacher needs to study well the art of questioning. 
 
-P-A-G-E-264
  254 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
The range of possibilities in questioning is very 
wide. If a rational, sensible question is regarded as 
the central or zero point, there are many degrees 
below it in the art of questioning and many degrees 
above it. Below it is a whole host of half-rational or 
useless questions which would better be left unborn: 
What does this word mean? Why didn’t you study 
your lesson? Why weren’t you paying attention? 
What is the definition of also? How many mistakes 
did Mary make? 
Much time is sometimes wasted in trying to an- 
swer aimless or trivial questions: Peter, what does 
this strange word mean, or how do you pronounce it ? 
Ethel may try it. Who thinks he can pronounce it 
better? Johnny, try it. Perhaps somebody knows 
how it ought to be. Sarah, can’t you pronounce it ? 
Finally, after various efforts, the teacher passes on to 
something else without even making clear the true 
pronunciation or meaning. This is worse than kill- 
ing time. It is befuddling the children. _A question 
should aim clearly at some important idea, and should 
bring out a definite result. The children should 
have time to think, but not to guess and dawdle, and 
then be left groping in the dark. 
The chief aim of questions is to arouse vigor and 
variety of thought as a means of better appreciation 
and expression. Children read poorly because they 
do not see the meaning or do not feel the force 
of the sentiment. They give wrong emphasis and
-P-A-G-E-265
  CLASS-ROOM METHOD IN READING 255 
intonation. A good question is like a flash of light. 
ning which suddenly reveals our standing-ground and 
surroundings, and gives the child a chance to strike 
out again for himself. His intelligence lights up, he 
sees the point, and responds with a significant ren- 
dering of the thought. But the teacher must be a 
thinker to ask simple and pertinent questions. He 
can’t go at it in a loose and lumbering fashion. 
Lively and sympathetic and appreciative of the 
child’s moods and feelings must he be, as well as 
clear and definite in his own perception of the 
author’s meaning. 
Questioning for meaning is equivalent to that for 
securing expression, and thus two birds are hit with 
one stone. A pointed question energizes thought 
along a definite line, and leads to. a more intense and 
vivid perception of the meaning. This is just the 
vantage-ground we desire ‘in order to secure good 
expression. We wish children not to imitate, but 
first to see and feel, and then to express in becoming 
wise the thought as they see it and feel it. This 
makes reading a genuine performance, not a parrot- 
like formalism. 
5. Trying to awaken the mental energy and action 
of a class as they move on through a masterpiece, 
requires constant watchfulness to keep alive their 
sense-perceptions and memories, and to touch their 
imaginations into constructive effort at every turn in 
the road. Through the direct action of the senses
-P-A-G-E-266
  256 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
the children have accumulated much variety of sense- 
materials, of country and town, of hill, valley, river, 
lake, fields, buildings, industries, roads, homes, gar- 
dens, seasons. Out of this vast and varied quarry 
they are able to gather materials with which to con- 
struct any landscape or situation you may desire. 
Give the children abundance of opportunity to use 
these collected riches, and to construct, each in his 
own way, the scenes and pictures that the poet’s 
art so vividly suggests. Many of the questions we 
ask of children are designed simply to recall and 
reawaken images which lie dormant in their minds, 
or, on the other hand, to find out whether they can 
combine their old sense-perceptions so skilfully and 
vividly as to realize the present situation. Keen and 
apt questions will reach down into the depth of a 
child’s life experiences and bring up concrete images 
which the fancy then modifies and adjusts to the 
present need. The teacher may often suggest some- 
thing in his own observations to kindle like memories 
in theirs. Or, if the subject seems unfamiliar, he 
may bring on a picture from book or magazine. 
Sometimes a sketch or diagram on the board may 
give sense-precision and definiteness to the object 
discussed, even though it be rudely drawn. This con- 
stant appeal to what is real and tangible and experi- 
mental, not only locates things definitely in time and 
space, makes clear and plain what was hazy or mean- 
ingless, awakens interest by connecting the story or
-P-A-G-E-267
  CLASS-ROOM METHOD IN READING 257 
description with former experiences, but it sets in 
action the creative imagination which shapes and 
builds up new and pleasing structures, combining old 
and new. This kind of mental elaboration, which 
reaches back into the senses and forward into the 
imagination, is what gives mobility and adjustability to 
our mental resources. It is not stiff and rigid and 
refractory knowledge that we need. Ideas may 
retain their truth and strength, their inward quality, 
and still submit to infinite variations and adjustments. 
Water is one of the most serviceable of all nature’s 
compounds, because it has such mobility of form, 
such capacity to dissolve and take into solution other 
substances, or of being absorbed and even lost sight 
of in other bodies. The ideas we have gathered and 
stored up from all sources are our building mate- 
rials; the imagination is the architect who conceives 
the plan and directs the use of different materials 
in the growth of the new structures. The teach- 
er’s chief function in reading classes is, on the one 
hand, to see that children revive and utilize their 
sense-knowledge, and on the other, to wake the 
sleeping giant and set him to work to build the 
beauteous structures for which the materials have 
been prepared. But for this, teachers could be dis- 
pensed with. As Socrates said, they are only 
helpers; they stand by, not to perform the work, but 
to gently guide, to stimulate, and now and then to 
lend a helping hand over a bad place. 
s
-P-A-G-E-268
  258 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
Explanations, therefore, on the teacher’s part, 
should be clear and brief, purely tributary to the 
main effort. In younger classes, when the children 
have, as yet, little ability to use references, the 
teacher may add much, especially if it be concrete, 
graphic, picturesque, and bearing directly upon the 
subject. .But as children grow more self-reliant 
they can look up facts and references, and bring 
more material themselves to the elucidation of the 
lesson. But even in adult classes the rich experience 
of a trained and wise teacher, whose illustrations are 
apt and graphic and criticisms incisive, is an intense 
pleasure and stimulus to students. 
6. The major part of time and effort in reading 
classes should be given to the reading proper, and 
not to oral discussions, explanations, and collateral 
information and references. It is possible to have 
interesting discussions and‘ much use of reference 
books, and still make small progress in expressive 
reading. The main thing should not be lost sight 
of. We should learn to march steadily forward 
through lively and energetic thought toward expres- 
sive reading. There is no other right approach to 
good reading except through a lively grasp of the 
thought, sentiment, and style of the author. But the 
side-lights that come from collateral reading and 
reference are of great significance. They are some- 
thing like the scenery on the stage. They make 
the effect more intense and real. They supply a 
 
-P-A-G-E-269
  CLASS-ROOM METHOD IN READING 259 
background of environment and association which 
give the ideas more local significance and a stronger 
basis in the whole complex of ideas. 
The reading or oral rendering is the final test of 
understanding and appreciation of the lesson. The 
recitation should focus in this applied art. All 
questioning and discussion that do not eventuate in 
expressive reading fall short of their proper result. 
Reading is a school exercise in which the principles 
discussed can be immediately applied, and this is 
scarcely true in studies like history, science, and 
mathematics. There are many hindrances in the 
way of this fruitful result ifthe teacher is tempted to 
talk and” explain too much) interesting questions and 
controversies spring up, trivial matters receive too 
much consideration, much time is spent in the oral 
reproduction of the thought; often the time slips by 
with a minimum of effective reading. 
The questions, discussions, collateral references, 
and explanations should be ‘brought into immediate 
connection with the children’s reading, so that the 
special thought may produce its effect upon expres- 
sion. This test of effectiveness is a good one to 
apply to explanations, definitions, and questions. 
Unless they produce a pronounced effect upon the 
reading, they are largely superfluous. In view of 
this the teacher will learn to be sparing of words, 
laconic and definite in statement, pointed and. clear 
in questioning, and energetic in pushing forward.
-P-A-G-E-270
  260 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
While interest in the thought-content is the impel 
ling motive in good reading exercises, lively and 
natural expression is likewise the proper fruit and 
outcome of such a motive carried to its proper end. 
7. In order to keep up the right interest and 
movement, it is necessary to give considerable vari- 
ety to the work. A teacher’s good sense and tact 
should be like a thermometer which registers the 
mental temperature of the class. If kept too long at 
a single line of effort, its monotony induces careless- 
ness and inattention; while a total change to some 
other order of exercise would awake their interest 
and zeal. Variety is needed also within the compass 
of a single recitation, because there are several pre- 
liminaries and varieties of preparatory drill which 
conduce to good rendering of any selection. Such 
are vocal exercises in consonants and vowels; pro- 
nunciation and syllabication of new or difficult 
words; physical exercises to put the body and ner- 
vous system into proper tone; the assignment of the 
next lesson, requiring a peculiar effort and manner 
of treatment; the report and discussion of refer- 
ences; concert drills; the study of meanings — syno- 
nyms and derivations; illustrations and information 
by the teacher ; introduction of other illustrative mat- 
ter, as pictures, drawings, maps, and diagrams. 
Variety can be given to each lesson in many ways 
according to the ingenuity of the teacher. If we are 
reading a number of short selections, they themselves
-P-A-G-E-271
CLASS-ROOM METHOD IN READING 261 
furnish different varieties and types of prose and 
verse. The dramatist or novelist provides for such 
variety by introducing a series of diverse scenes, all 
leading forward to a common end. 
8. Parallel to the requirement of variety is the 
equally important demand that children should learn 
to do one thing at a time and learn to do it well. 
This may appear contradictory to the former require- 
ment, but the skill and tact of the teacher is what 
should solve this seeming contradiction. It is a fact 
that we try to do too many things in each reading 
lesson. We fail to pound on one nail long enough 
to drive it in. Reading lessons often resemble a 
child pounding nails into a board. He strikes one 
nail a blow or two, then another, and so on until a 
dozen or more are in all stages of incompleteness. 
We too often allow the recitation hour to end with a 
number of such incomplete efforts. Good reading is 
not like moving a house, when it is all carried along 
in one piece. We reach better results if we concen- 
trate attention and effort during a recitation along 
the line of a narrow aim. At least this seems true 
of the more formal, mechanical side of reading. It 
is better to try to break up bad habits, one at a time, 
rather than to make a general, indefinite onslaught 
upon all together. Suppose, for example, that the 
teacher suggests as an aim of the lesson conversa- 
tional reading, or that which sounds like pupils talk- 
ing to each other. Many dialogue selections admit  
-P-A-G-E-272
262 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
of such an aim as this. If this aim is set up at the 
beginning of the lesson, the children’s minds will be 
rendered acute in this direction; they will be on the 
alert for this kind of game. Each child who reads 
is scrutinized by teacher and pupils to see how near 
he comes to the ideal. A conscious effort begins to 
dominate the class to reach this specific goal. Chil- 
dren may close their eyes and listen to see if the 
reading has the right sound. A girl or boy goes 
into an adjoining entry or dressing room and listens 
to see if those in the class are reading or talking. 
The enthusiasm and class spirit awakened are very 
helpful. Not that a whole recitation should be given 
up to that sort of thing, but it is the characteristic 
effort of the lesson. When the children practise the 
next lesson at home they will have this point in 
mind. 
For several days this sort of specific, definite aim 
at a narrow result may be followed up in the class 
till the children begin to acquire power in this direc- 
tion. What was, at first, painfully conscious effort 
begins to assume the form of habit, and when this 
result is achieved, we may drop this aim as a leading 
one in the recitation, and turn our attention to some 
different line of effort. Distinct pronunciation of 
sounds is one of the things that we are always aim- 
ing at, in a general way, and never getting. Why 
not set this up in a series of recitations as a definite 
aim, and resort to a series of devices to lay bare the 
   
-P-A-G-E-273
  CLASS-ROOM METHOD IN READING 263 
kind of faults the children are habitually guilty of? 
Give them a chance to correct these faults, and awake 
the class spirit in this direction. It will not be diffi- 
cult to convince them that they are not pronouncing 
their final consonants, like d, ¢, 4 m, 7, and &. Keep 
the attention for a lesson to this kind of error till 
there is recognizable improvement. Then notice 
the short vowel sounds in the unaccented syllables, 
and give them search-light attention. Notice later 
the syllables that children commonly slur over. 
Mark these fugitives, and see if they continue so 
invisible and inaudible. They are like Jack the 
Giant Killer, when he put on his cloak of invisi- 
bility, or like Perseus under similar circumstances. 
See if we can find these fellows who seem to mas- 
querade and dodge about behind their companions. 
Then some of the long vowels and diphthongs will 
require investigation. They are not all so open- 
faced and above board as they might be. When 
children have such a simple and distinct aim in 
view, they are ready to work with a vim and to 
exert themselves in a conscious effort at improve- 
ment. Keep this aim foremost in the recitation, 
although other requirements of good reading are 
not wholly neglected. 
After a definite line of effort has been strongly 
developed as one of the above described, it is pos- 
sible thereafter to keep it in mind with slight atten- 
tion. But if no special drill has ever been devoted
-P-A-G-E-274
  264 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
to it for a given length of time, it has not been 
brought so distinctly to mind as to produce a lasting 
impression and to lay the basis for habit. Besides 
the two aims, clear articulation and conversational 
tones, there are others that may be labored at simi- 
larly. Appreciation of the thought as expressed by 
‘the reading is a rich field for critical study of a piece, 
and as a basis for observing and judging the chil- 
dren’s reading. This idea is well implied by such 
questions as follow: Is that what the passage 
means? Have you given expression to the author’s 
meaning by emphasis on this word? Does your 
rendering of this passage make good sense? Com- 
pare it with what precedes. How did the man feel 
when he said this? What do we know of his char- 
acter that would lead us to expect such words from 
him? This line of questions has a wide and varied 
range. The chief thing is to scrutinize the thought 
in all the light attainable, and appeal to the child’s 
own judgment as to the suitableness of the tone and 
emphasis to the thought. Does it sound right? Is 
that what the passage means ? 
Each characteristic form of prose or verse has a 
peculiar style and force of expression that calls for a 
corresponding oral rendering. There is the serious 
and massive, though simple, diction of Webster’s 
speeches, with its smooth and rounded periods, call- 
ing for slow and steady and energetic reading. We 
should notice this characteristic of an author, and
-P-A-G-E-275
  CLASS-ROOM METHOD IN READING 265 
grow into sympathy with his feeling, language, and 
mental movement. In Macaulay’s “ Lays of Ancient 
Rome,” the ring of martial music is in the words, and 
it swells out into rapid and rousing speech which 
should correspond to the thought. In “Evangeline” 
the flow of language is placid and gentle and rhyth- 
mical, and in consonance with the gentle faith and 
hope of Evangeline. Every true literary product 
has its own character, which the genius of the author 
has impressed upon its language and moulded into 
its structure, and which calls for a rendering fit and 
appropriate. Before completing a selection, we 
should detect this essence and quality and bring our 
reading to reveal it. The places should be pointed 
out where it comes into prominence. 
When completing such a work of art there should 
be given opportunity to bring all the varied elements 
and special aims discovered and worked out during 
its reading to a focus. 
In the final review and rereading of a complete 
poem or prose selection the points of excellence in 
reading which have been the special aims of effort 
in the studies of the piece should be kept sharply in 
mind and pushed to a full expression. The realiza- 
tion of these various aims may be set before the 
class as the distinct object of their closing work on a 
masterpiece. The failure to hold vigorously to this 
final achievement is a clear sign of intellectual and 
moral lassitude. Reading, as noticed before, is
-P-A-G-E-276
  266 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
one of the few studies in which the final application 
of -theory to practice can be effected, and children 
may realize that things are learned for the sake of 
using them, and not simply against some future con- 
tingency. This implies, however, much resource 
and skill on the teacher’s part in awakening the chil- 
dren, The impulses and aims which arouse the 
children to strenuous effort should spring from 
within, and should be expressions of their own self- 
activity and volition. There is much need of the 
enthusiasm and will-energy that overcome drudgery. 
Children should be taught to be dissatisfied with any- 
thing less than real accomplishment. 
The children will naturally memorize certain pas- 
sages which strike their fancy. Other passages 
have been suggested by the teacher for different 
pupils to memorize. In one of the closing lessons 
let the children recite these parts before the class. 
If the teacher has succeeded in calling out the live 
interest of the class during the previous study, such 
a lesson will be a joy to both pupils and teacher. 
One or two of the children may also volunteer or be 
appointed to make an oral statement of the argu- 
ment, which will give freedom to natural and effec- 
tive speech. Such a round-up of the reading lessons 
at the end of a series of interesting studies is a 
rich experience to the whole class. 
Besides the important special aims thus far sug- 
gested, which should each stand out clear for a
-P-A-G-E-277
  CLASS-ROOM METHOD IN READING 267 
series of lessons until its value is realized and worked 
over into habit, there are other subordinate aims that 
deserve particular and individual consideration, and 
may now and then become the dominant purpose of 
a lesson. Such are the correction of singsong read- 
ing, the use of the dictionary, the study of synonyms 
and antitheses, the comparisons and figures of speech, 
exercises in sight reading of unfamiliar selections, 
quotations from selections and masterpieces already 
read, study of the lives and works of authors. 
Reading is a many-sided study, and to approach 
its difficulties with success we must take them up one 
at a time, conquering them in detail. Good house- 
keepers and cooks are accustomed to lay out a series 
of dinners in which the chief article of diet is varied 
from day to day as follows: chicken pie with oysters, 
veal potpie, stewed fish, broiled beefsteak, venison 
roast, bean soup with ham, roast mutton, baked fish, 
broiled quail, roast beef, baked chicken with parsnips, 
etc. Such a series of dinners gives a healthy variety 
and relish. It is better for most people than the bill 
of fare ata large hotel, where there is so much 
variety and sameness each day. When we try each 
day to do everything in a reading lesson, we grasp 
more than our hands can hold, and most of it falls to 
the ground. Children are pleased and encouraged 
by actual progress in surmounting difficulties when 
they are presented one at a time, and opportunity is 
given for complete mastery. The children should 
 
-P-A-G-E-278
  268 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
labor consciously and vigorously at one line of effort, 
be it distinctness or rhythm or emphasis or conversa- 
tional tone, till decided improvement and progress are 
attained, and the ease of right habit begins to show 
itself. Then we can turn to some new field, secur- 
ing and holding the vantage-ground of our foregoing 
effort by occasional reminders. 
g. One of the best tests applied to a reading class 
is their degree of class attention. The steadiness 
and responsiveness with which the whole class fol- 
low the work is a fair measure of successful teach- 
ing. To have but one child read at a time while the 
others wait their turn or scatter their thoughts, is 
very bad. It is a good sign of a teacher’s skill and 
efficiency to see every child in energetic pursuit of 
the reading. It conduces to the best progress in 
that study and is the genesis of right mental habit. 
Attention is a sine gua non to good teaching, and 
yet it is a result rather than a cause. It is a ripe 
fruit rather than the spring promise of it. The pro- 
visions which lead up to steady attention are deserv- 
ing. of a teacher’s study and patient scrutiny. She 
may command attention for a moment by sheer force 
of will and personality, but it must have something 
to feed upon the next moment and the next, or it will 
be wandering in distant fields. So great and indis- 
pensable is the value of attention, that some teachers 
try to secure it at too heavy a cost. They command, 
threaten, punish. They resort to severity and
-P-A-G-E-279
  CLASS-ROOM METHOD IN READING 263 
cruelty. But the more formidable the teacher be- 
comes, the more difficult for a child to do his duty. 
Here, again, we can best afford to go back to the 
sources from which attention naturally springs, 
interesting subject of thought, vivid and concrete 
perceptions, lively and suggestive appeal to the im- 
agination, the sphere of noble thought and emotion, 
variety and movement in mental effort, a mutual 
sympathy and harmony between teacher and pupil. 
It is indeed well for the teacher to gauge his work 
by the kind and intensity of attention he can secure. 
If the class has dropped into slothful and habitual 
carelessness and inattention, he will have to give them 
a few severe jolts; he must drop questions where 
they are least expected. He must be very alert to 
detect a listless child and wake him into action. The 
vigor, personal will, and keen watchfulness of the 
teacher must be a constant resource. On the other 
hand, let him look well to the thought, the feeling, 
and capacity of the children, and give them matter 
which is equal to their merits. 
It is not unusual to find the teacher’s eye following 
the text closely instead of watching the class. But 
the teacher’s eye should be moving alertly among the 
children. In case he has studied the lesson carefully, 
the teacher can detect almost every mistake without 
the book. In fact, even if one has not recently read 
a selection, he can usually detect a verbal error by 
the break or incoherency of the thought. Moreover,
-P-A-G-E-280
  270 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
the teacher can better judge the expressiveness of the 
reading by listening to it than by following the text 
with his eye. Depending wholly upon the ear, any 
defect of utterance or ineptness of expression is 
quickly detected. Even the children at times should 
be asked to close their books and to listen closely to 
the reading. This emphasizes the notion that good 
reading is the oral expression of thought, so that 
those who listen can understand and enjoy it. 
The treadmill style of reading, which repeats and 
repeats, doing the same things day by day, going 
through the like round of mechanical motions, should 
give way to a rational, spirited, variegated method 
which arouses interest and variety of thought, and 
moves ever toward a conscious goal. 
10. In studying the masterpieces of great writers, 
a question arises how to treat the moral situations in- 
volved in the stories. In their revolt against exces- 
sive moralizing with children, some critics object to 
any direct teaching of moral ideas in connection with 
literature, being opposed to explicit discussions of 
moral notions. 
All will admit that literature, dealing as it does 
with human life, is surcharged with practical moral- 
ity, with social conduct. It is also the motive of great 
writers, while dealing honestly with human nature, to 
idealize and beautify their representations of men. 
Nor is it their purpose to make unworthy characters 
pleasing and attractive models.
-P-A-G-E-281
  CLASS-ROOM METHOD IN READING 271 
It is expected, of course, that children will get 
clear notions and opinions of such persons as Miles 
Standish and John Alden, of Whittier’s father and 
mother and others in the fireside circle of “Snow- 
Bound,” of Antonio and Shylock in the “ Merchant of 
Venice,” of Cinderella and her sisters in the story, of 
Wallace and Bruce in Scott’s “Tales,” of Gluck and 
his brothers in Ruskin’s story, of Scrooge in the 
“Christmas Carol,” of Evangeline, Enoch Arden, etc. 
But boys and girls are not infallible judges of 
character. They are apt to form erroneous or one- 
sided judgments from lack of insight into the author’s 
meaning, or from carelessness. There is the same 
possibility of error in forming moral judgments as 
in forming judgments in other phases of an author’s 
thought. 
It is the province of the teacher to stimulate the 
children to think, and, by his superior experience and 
judgment, to guide them into correct thinking. It 
is not the function of the teacher to impose his ready- 
made judgments upon children, either in morals or 
in anything else. But it is his concern, by questions, 
suggestions, and criticisms, to aid in clarifying the 
thought, to put the children upon the right track. 
There is no reason why a teacher should abdicate his 
place of instructor because he chances to come be- 
fore moral problems. Literature is full of moral 
situations, moral problems, and moral evolutions in 
character, and even of moral ideals. Is the teacher   
f y
-P-A-G-E-282
  272 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
to stand dumb before these things as if he had lost 
his wits? Or is he to consider it the greatest oppor- 
tunity of his life to prudently guide young people 
to the correct perception of what is beautiful and 
true in human life? Why, indeed, should he sup- 
press his own enthusiasm for these ideals? Why 
should not his personality be free to express itself 
in matters of moral concern, as well as in intellectual 
and zsthetic judgments? So long as the teacher 
throws the pupils back upon their own self-activity 
and thinking power, there need be no danger of 
moral pedantry or of moral dyspepsia. 
It seems to me, therefore, that the teacher should 
use freedom and boldness in discussing with the 
children candidly and thoughtfully the characters 
presented in good literature. Let the situations be 
made clear so that correct judgments of single acts 
can be formed. Let the weaknesses and virtues of 
the persons be noted. Let motives be studied and 
characteristic tendencies traced out. In this way 
children may gradually increase their insight and 
enlarge the range of their knowledge of social life. 
If these things are not legitimate, why should such 
materials be presented to children at all? We need 
not:make premature moralists of children, or teach 
them to pass easy or flippant moral judgments upon 
others. But we wish their interest in these charac- 
ters to be deep and genuine, their eyes wide open 
to the truths of life, and their intuitive moral judg- 
 
-P-A-G-E-283
  CLASS-ROOM METHOD IN READING 273 
ments to ripen in a healthy and hearty social environ- 
ment. To this end the teacher will need to use all 
his skill in questioning, in suggestion, in frank and 
candid discussion. In short, he needs just those 
qualities which a first-class teacher needs in any 
field of study. 
We have gotten out of the mode of tacking a 
moral to a story. Ostensibly moral stories, over- 
weighted with a moral purpose, do not please us. 
We wish novelists and dramatists to give us the 
truth of life, and leave us to pass judgment upon 
the characters. Our best literature presents great 
variety of scenes and characterizations in their 
natural setting in life. They specially cultivate 
moral judgment and insight. One of the ultimate 
standards which we apply to all novels and dramas 
is that of their fundamental moral truth. Schlegel, 
in his “Dramatic Art and Literature,” in his criti- 
cisms of great writers, discusses again and again 
the moral import of the characters, and even the 
moral purpose of Shakespeare and the dramatists. 
In fact, these moral considerations lie deep and fun- 
damental in judging the great works of literary art. 
The masterpieces we use in the schools bear the 
same relation to the children that the more difficult 
works bear to adults. 
The clear discussion of the moral element in litera- 
ture seems, therefore, natural and legitimate, while 
its neglect and obscuration would be a fatal defect. 
T

  274 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
11. There are two kinds of reading which should 
be cultivated in reading lessons, although they seem 
to fall a little apart from the main highway of effort. 
They are, first, sight reading of supplementary matter 
for the purpose of cultivating a quick and accurate 
grasp of new thought and forms. When we leave 
school, one of the values of reading will be the power 
it gives to interpret quickly and grasp firmly the 
ideas as they present themselves in the magazines, 
papers, and books we read. Good efforts in school 
reading will lead forward gradually to that readiness 
of thought and fluency of perception which will give 
freedom and mastery of new reading matter. To 
develop this ability and to regulate it into habit, we 
must give children a chance to read quite a little 
at sight. We need supplementary readers in sets 
which can be put into the hands of children for this 
purpose. The same books will answer for several 
classes, and may be passed from room to room of 
similar grade. 
The reading matter we select for this purpose 
may be classic, and of the best quality, just as well 
as to be limited to information and geographical 
readers which are much inferior. There are first- 
class books of literary merit, which are entirely ser- 
viceable for this purpose and much richer in culture. 
They continue the line of study in classic literature, 
and give ground for suggestive comparisons and 
reviews which should not be neglected. There is
-P-A-G-E-285
  CLASS-ROOM METHOD IN READING 275 
a strong tendency in our time to put inferior reading 
matter, in the form of information readers, science 
primers, short history stories, geographical readers, 
newspapers, and specially prepared topics on current 
events, into reading classes. These things may do 
well enough in their proper place in geography, his- 
tory, natural science, or general lessons, but they 
should appear scarcely at all in reading lessons. 
Preserve the reading hour for that which is choicest 
in our prose and verse, mainly in the form of shorter 
or longer masterpieces of literature. 
Secondly, many books should be brought to the 
attention of the children which they may read outside 
of school. The regular reading exercises should give 
the children a lively and attractive introduction to some 
of the best authors, and a taste for the strength and 
beauty of their productions. But the field of litera- 
ture is so wide and varied that many things can only 
be suggested, which will remain for the future leisure 
and choice of readers. Children might, however, 
be made acquainted with some of the best books 
suited to their age for which there is not school time. 
Many of the best books, like “Ivanhoe,” “Quentin 
Durward,” “Captains Courageous,” “Swiss Family 
Robinson,” and “ Nicholas Nickleby,” cannot be read 
in school. They should be in the school library, and 
the teacher should often refer to them and to others 
suggested by the regular reading, which give deeper 
and wider views into life.
-P-A-G-E-286
  276 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
12, In the use of the symbols and language 
forms of reading, the children should be led on to 
freedom and self-activity. How to get the mastery 
of these forms in the early reading work is dis- 
cussed at some length in the earlier chapters of this 
book. 
In the fourth and fifth years of school, children 
should learn to use the dictionary. It is a great 
means of self-help when they have learned to inter- 
pret the dictionary easily. But special lessons are 
necessary to teach children: first, how to find words 
in the dictionary; second, how to interpret the 
diacritical markings so as to get a correct pronuncia- 
tion; and third, how to discriminate among definitions. 
Adults and even teachers are often deficient in these 
particulars, and children will not form habits of using 
the dictionary with quick and easy confidence with- 
out continuous, attentive care on the teacher’s part. 
The best outcome of such training is the conscious 
power of the child to help himself, and there is 
nothing in school work more deserving of encourage- 
ment. 
The system of diacritical markings used in the 
dictionary should be put on the blackboard, varied 
illustrations of the markings given, and the applica- 
tion of these markings to new words in the dictionary 
discovered. Lack of success in this work is chiefly 
due to a failure to pursue this plan steadily till ease 
and mastery are gained and habits formed, 
 
-P-A-G-E-287
  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT POINTS IN READING 277 
In the later grades these habits of self-help should 
be kept up and extended further to the study of 
synonyms, root words and their kindred, homonyms, 
prefixes and suffixes, and the derived meanings of _ 
words. 
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT POINTS IN READING 
1. The teacher’s effort is first directed to a vivid 
interpretation of the author’s thought and feeling, 
and later to an expressive rendering of the thought. 
2. Every exertion should be made to lead the 
children to an absorbed and interested attention in 
the selections. 
3. The author’s leading motive in the whole se- 
lection should be firmly grasped by the teacher. By 
centring all discussion toward this motive, unneces- 
sary digressions will be avoided. 
4. The teacher will hardly teach well unless he 
has saturated himself with the spirit of the selection, 
and enjoys it. To this end he needs not only to 
study the selection, but also the historical, geographi- 
cal, biographical, and other side-lights. 
5. The teacher needs great freedom land versa- 
tility in the use of his materials. Warmth, anima- 
tion, and freedom of manner are necessary. 
6. Children often do not know how to study a 
reading lesson. In the assignment and in the way of 
handling the lesson they should be taught how to get 
at it, how to understand and enjoy it. ates 
 
-P-A-G-E-288
  278 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
7. In the assignment of the lesson the thought 
of the piece should be opened up in an interesting 
way, and such difficulties as children are not likely to, 
grapple with and master for themselves pointed out 
and approached. Difficult words need to be pro- 
nounced and hard passages explained. 
8. The assignment should be unmistakably clear 
and definite, so as to insure a good seat study. 
g. The seat study should be chiefly on parts 
already discussed in class. 
10. During the recitation proper, strong class at- 
tention by all the members of the class is a first 
necessity. Much knowledge, alertness, and skill are 
necessary to secure this. One must keep all the 
members of the class in the eye constantly, and 
distribute the questions and work among them 
promptly and judiciously, so as to secure con- 
centrated effort. 
11. The teacher can often judge a recitation better 
without looking at the book while the class is read- 
ing. : 
12. Skill in questioning is very useful in reading 
lessons. 3 
(a) Questions to arouse the thought should 
appeal to the experience of children. 
(4) Questions to bring out the meaning of 
words or passages, or to expose errors or 
to develop thought, should be clear and 
specific, not long and ambiguous.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT POINTS IN READING 279 
13. Let the teacher be satisfied with reasonable 
answers, and not insist on the precise verbal form 
present to his own mind. 
14. The teacher needs to awaken strongly the 
imagination in picturing scenes, in interpreting 
poetic images and figures, and in impersonating 
characters. The picture-forming power is stimulated 
by apt questions, by suggestion of the teacher, by 
interpretation, by appeal to experience, by dramatic 
action. 
15. The use of the dialogue and dramatic repre- 
sentation is among the best means of awakening 
interest and producing freedom and self-forgetful- 
ness. "i 
16. The pupil should give his own interpretation, 
subject to correction, and interpret parts in relation 
to the whole. 
17. Without too much loss of time children should 
learn to help themselves in overcoming difficulties 
_in solving problems. 
18. Sometimes it is well for children to come pre- 
pared to ask definite questions on parts they do not 
understand. 
19. The tendency to more independent and mature 
thinking is encouraged by comparing similar ideas, 
figures of speech, and language in different poems 
and from different authors. ‘ 
20. There should be much effective reading and 
not much mere oral reproduction. The paraphrase  
-P-A-G-E-290
280 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
may be used at times to give the pupil a larger view 
of the content of the piece. 
21. Let the pupil reading feel responsible for giv- 
ing to the class the content of the printed page. 
Often it is best to face the class. 
22. The teacher should occasionally read a pas- 
sage in the best style for the pupils, not for direct 
imitation, but to suggest the higher ideals and spirit 
of good reading. A high standard is thus set up. 
23. Children should be encouraged to learn by 
heart the passages they like. In the midst of the 
recitation it is well occasionally to memorize a pas- 
sage. 
24. The teacher must drill himself in clear-cut 
enunciation of short vowels, final consonants, and 
pure vowel sounds. Cultivate also a quick ear for 
accurate enunciation in the pupils and for pleasing 
tones. Frequent drill exercise, singly and in con- 
cert, is necessary. 
25. Use ingenuity by indirect methods to over- 
come nasality, stuttering, nervously rapid reading, 
slovenly and careless expression, monotone, and sing- 
song. 
26. By means of physical training, deep breathing, 
vigorous thought work, encourage to self-reliant 
manner and good physical position. 
27. Give variety to each lesson; avoid monotony 
and humdrum. 
28. Each lesson should emphasize a particular

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT POINTS IN READING 281 _ 
Ys . ion or bE aim, determined by the nature of the selection or by 
the previous bad habits and faults of the children 
in reading. It is impossible to give proper emphasis 
to all things in each lesson, and indefiniteness and 
monotony are the result.

ILLUsTRATIVE LEssoNnsS IN READING 
“HIAWATHA” 
Tue “ Hiawatha” is sometimes read in.the regular 
reading work of fourth or fifth grades. 
The pictures in Houghton, Mifflin’s edition of the 
“Hiawatha” are one means of producing the proper 
environment of the poem. The suggestions for 
dramatizing parts of the poem and of working up 
the proper costume for representing the characters of 
the story may be carried out in any school. 
That the story begins with the early childhood of 
Hiawatha and describes his early home and training 
at the feet of Nokomis is at least one point in its 
favor. 
“By the shores of Gitchee Gumee, 
By the shining Big-Sea-Water, 
Stood the wigwam of Nokomis, 
Daughter of the Moon, Nokomis. 
Dark behind it rose the forest, 
Rose the black and gloomy pine-trees, 
Rose the firs with cones upon them; 
Bright before it beat the water, 
Beat the clear and sunny water, 
Beat the shining Big-Sea-Water. 
282
-P-A-G-E-293
ILLUSTRATIVE LESSONS IN READING 283 
There the wrinkled old Nokomis 
Nursed the little Hiawatha, 
Rocked him in his linden cradle, 
Bedded soft in moss and rushes, 
Safely bound with reindeer sinews ; 
Stilled his fretful wail by saying, 
‘Hush! the Naked Bear will hear thee !” 
Lulled him into slumber, singing, 
‘Ewa-yea ! my little owlet ! 
Who is this that lights the wigwam? 
With his great eyes lights the wigwam? 
Ewa-yea! my little owlet!’” 
Where have you seen a lake shore bordered with 
pine or other forest ? 
Show pictures of Indian wigwam. Collect views 
of northern lakes and Indians in their dress. What 
do we call the Big-Sea-Water in our geography ? 
Refer to map. How were the reindeer sinews used ? 
Why not use cords or twine? Would you enjoy 
living in a wigwam summer and winter? Explain 
how the cradle was shaped and made comfortable. 
Repeat some of the cradle songs we sing in putting 
the baby to sleep. 
“Then the little Hiawatha 
Learned of every bird its language, 
Learned their names and all their secrets, 
How they built their nests in Summer, 
Where they hid themselves in Winter, 
Talked with them whene’er he met them, 
Called them ‘ Hiawatha’s Chickens.’” 
What birds do you know by their song or twitter? 
Do the birds have secrets? Describe the nest the

    284 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
robin builds ; the sparrow ; the woodpecker. Do you 
ever feed the wild birds? 
The author’s motive is explained in the following 
passage. Most of us have been accustomed to look 
upon the Indians as savage and brutal. How does 
Longfellow feel toward them? What have you 
heard of William Penn and his treatment of the 
Indians? 
“Ye who love a nation’s legends, 
Love the ballads of a people, 
That like voices from afar off 
Call to us to pause and listen, 
Speak in tones so plain and childlike, 
Scarcely can the ear distinguish 
Whether they are sung or spoken ; — 
Listen to this Indian Legend, 
To this song of Hiawatha ! 
Ye whose hearts are fresh and simple, 
Who have faith in God and Nature, 
Who believe, that in all ages 
Every human heart is human, 
That in even savage bosoms 
There are longings, yearnings, strivings 
For the good they comprehend not, 
That the feeble hands and helpless, 
Groping blindly in the darkness, 
Touch God’s right hand in that darkness,

with from the early English? from the Greeks? The 
Indians worshipped the Great Spirit and called their 
future beyond death the Happy Hunting Grounds. 
In the following passage Longfellow gives an ex- 
planation where these stories of Hiawatha came from. 
Locate the lakes and forests and prairies that are 
referred to. Where do we find moors and fenlands? 
What other tribes are we familiar with besides the 
Ojibways and Dakotahs? 
“ Should you ask me, whence these stories, 
Whence these legends and traditions, 
With the odors of the forest, 
With the dew and damp of meadows, 
With the curling smoke of wigwams, 
With the rushing of great rivers, 
With their frequent repetitions, 
And their wild reverberations, 
As of thunder in the mountains? 
I should answer, I should tell you, 
‘From the forests and the prairies, 
From the great lakes of the Northland, 
From the land of the Ojibways, 
From the land of the Dacotahs, 
From the mountains, moors, and fenlands, 
Where the heron, the Shuh-shuh-gah, 
Feeds among the reeds and rushes.’ 
“Should you ask where Nawadaha 
Found these songs, so wild and wayward, 
Found these legends and traditions, 
I should answer, I should tell you, 
‘In the birds’-nests of the forest, 
In the lodges of the beaver, 
In the hoof-prints of the bison,

In the eyry of the eagle! 
All the wild-fowl sang them to him, 
In the moorlands and the fenlands, 
In the melancholy marshes ; 
Chetowaik, the plover, sang them, 
Mahng, the loon, the wild-goose, Wawa, 
The blue heron, the Shuh-shuh-gah, 
And the grouse, the Mushkodasa!’” 
The Indians lived in the midst of wild nature, in 
woods and on the banks of lakes and streams. In 
hunting, of course, they were very familiar with all 
wild animals, birds, and fruits. 
Some of the Indian tribes were named for wild 
animals, as the Foxes. Can you name others? The 
favorite sign or totem of a tribe was the bear, or 
wolf, or crow. How do the beavers and muskrats 
build their lodges? How many of the animals and 
birds mentioned have you seen? Where may they be 
found and seen nowadays? 
| “ SNOW-BOUND” 
It is primarily a picture of family life in a Quaker 
home of New England. Whittier loved to reflect on 
the home of his boyhood and youth, and this poem 
gives us the deeper sympathies of his heart and 
makes beautiful the spirit of a Christian fireside. 
Let boys and girls enjoy and appreciate these 
pictures and the kindly affections of a good home, 
and they will naturally set up higher ideals,

In reading successive poems and prose selections 
from different authors, strong resemblances in thought 
or language are frequently detected. It is a thought- 
provoking process to bring such similar passages to 
a definite comparison. Even where the same topic 
is treated differently by two authors, the different 
or contrasted points of view are suggestive. Calling 
such familiar passages to mind is in itself a good 
practice, and it is well to cultivate this mode of 
turning previous knowledge into use. 
To illustrate this point, let us call to mind some 
familiar passages, touching the winter snow-storm 
and the fireside comforts, from Whittier, Emerson, 
and Lowell. 
Whittier’s description of a snow-storm in “ Snow- 
Bound” is well known :— 
“Unwarmed by any sunset light 
The gray day darkened into night, 
A night made hoary with the swarm 
And whirl-dance of the blinding storm, 
As zigzag wavering to and fro 
Crossed and recrossed the winged snow: 
And ere the early bedtime came 
The white drift piled the window-frame, 
And through the glass the clothes-line posts 
Looked in like tall and sheeted ghosts.” 
Notice and explain the striking descriptive ad- 
jectives in this passage as hoary, zigzag, winged, 
sheeted.
-P-A-G-E-298

“So all night long the storm roared on: 
The morning broke without a sun ; 
In tiny spherule traced with lines 
Of Nature’s geometric signs, 
In starry flake and pellicle 
All day the hoary meteor fell; 
And, when the second morning shone, 
We looked upon a world unknown, 
On nothing we could call our own.” 
How long had the storm lasted? 
“ Around the glistening wonder bent 
The blue walls of the firmament, 
No cloud above, no earth below, — 
A universe of sky and snow! 
The old familiar sights of ours 
Took marvellous shapes; strange domes and towers 
Rose up where sty or corn-crib stood, 
Or garden-wall, or belt of wood; 
A smooth white mound the brush-pile showed, 
A fenceless drift what once was road.” 
Name other changes wrought by the snow not 
mentioned by Whittier. 
“The bridle-post an old man sat 
With loose-flung coat and high cocked hat; 
- The well-curb had a Chinese roof; 
And even the long sweep, high aloof, 
In its slant splendor, seemed to tell 
Of Pisa’s leaning miracle.” 
Explain the old-fashioned well-sweep.
-P-A-G-E-299

Again the fireside joy is expressed : — 
“Shut in from all the world without, 
We sat the clean-winged hearth about, 
Content to let the north-wind roar 
In baffled rage at pane and door, 
While the red logs before us beat 
The frost-line back with tropic heat; 
And ever, when a louder blast 
Shook beam and rafter as it passed, 
The merrier up its roaring draught 
The great throat of the chimney laughed, 
The house-dog on his paws outspread 
Laid to the fire his drowsy head, 
The cat’s dark silhouette on the wall 
A couchant tiger’s seemed to fall ; 
And, for the winter fireside meet, 
Between the andirons’ straddling feet, 
The mug of cider simmered slow, 
The apples sputtered in a row, 
And, close at hand, the basket stood 
With nuts from brown October’s wood.” 
What kind of house did the Whittier family live 
in? What were the chief rooms, and how furnished? 
Show the descriptive aptness of these words, clean- 
winged, baffled, tropic, roaring, couchant. 
“What matter how the night behaved ? 
What matter how the north-wind raved ? 
Blow high, blow low, not all its snow 
Could quench our hearth-fire’s ruddy glow.” 
If these passages and others in “ Snow-Bound” 
are familiar to the children in previous study, the 
reading of Emerson’s “ The Snow-Storm,” might set 
U

them to recalling a whole series of pictures from 
Whittier: — 
“ Announced by all the trumpets of the sky, 
Arrives the snow, and, driving o’er the fields, 
Seems nowhere to alight: the whzted air 
Hides hills and woods, the river, and the heaven, 
And veils the farm-house at the garden’s end. 
The sled and traveller stopped, the courier’s feet 
Delayed, all friends shut out, the housemates sit 
Around the radiant fireplace, enclosed 
In a tumultuous privacy of storm.” 
The word whted corresponds with what word in 
Whittier ? 
Radiant suggests what word in Whittier ? 
“ Come see the north wind’s masonry. 
Out of an unseen quarry evermore, 
Furnished with tile, the fierce artificer 
Curves his white bastions with projected roof 
Round every windward stake, or tree, or door. 
Speeding, the myriad-handed, his wild work 
So fanciful, so savage, nought cares he 
For number or proportion. Mockingly, 
On coop or kennel he hangs Parian wreaths ; 
A swan-like form invests the hidden thorn ; 
Fills up the farmer’s lane from wall to wall, 
Maugre the farmer’s sighs; and at the gate 
A tapering turret overtops the work. 
And when his hours are numbered, and the world 
Is all his own, retiring, as he were not, 
Leaves, when the sun appears, astonished Art 
To mimic in slow structures, stone by stone, 
Built in an age, the mad wind’s night-work, 
The frolic architecture of the snow.”
-P-A-G-E-301
  ILLUSTRATIVE LESSONS IN READING 291 
The architecture of the snow can be compared 
point by point in both authors, in the objects about 
the farm-house, while the picture of the snug com- 
forts of the fireplace is in both. 
Of a somewhat different, yet closely related, char- 
acter is the description in the Prelude to Part Sec- 
ond, in the “ Vision of Sir Launfal” :— 
“Down swept the chill wind from the mountain peak, 
From the snow five thousand summers old ; 
On open wold and hill-top bleak 
It had gathered all the cold, 
And whirled it like sleet on the wanderer’s cheek ; 
It carried a shiver everywhere 
From the unleafed boughs and pastures bare ; 
The little brook heard it and built a roof 
*Neath which he could house him, winter-proof; 
All night by the white stars’ frosty gleams 
He groined his arches and matched his beams ; 
Slender and clear were his crystal spars 
As the lashes of light that trim the stars ; 
He sculptured every summer delight 
In his halls and chambers out of sight ; 
Sometimes his tinkling waters slipt 
Down through a frost-leaved forest-crypt, 
Long, sparkling aisles of steel-stemmed trees 
Bending to counterfeit a breeze ; 
Sometimes the roof no fretwork knew 
But silvery mosses that downward grew; 
Sometimes it was carved in sharp relief 
With quaint arabesques of ice-fern leaf; 
Sometimes it was simply smooth and clear 
For the gladness of heaven to shine through, and here 
He had caught the nodding bulrush-tops 
And hung them thickly with diamond drops,
-P-A-G-E-302
  292 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
Which crystalled the beams of moon and sun, 
And made a star of every one: 
No mortal builder’s most rare device 
Could match this winter-palace of ice; 
Twas as if every image that mirrored lay 
In his depths serene through the summer day, 
Each flitting shadow of earth and sky, 
Lest the happy model should be lost, 
Had been mimicked in fairy masonry 
By the elfin builders of the frost. 
“Within the hall are the song and laughter, 
The cheeks of Christmas glow red and jolly, 
And sprouting is every corbel and rafter 
With the lightsome green of ivy and holly; 
Through the deep gulf of the chimney wide 
Wallows the Yule-log’s roaring tide ; 
The broad flame-pennons droop and flap 
And belly and tug asa flag in the wind; 
Like a locust shrills the imprisoned sap, 
Hunted to death in its galleries blind; 
And swift little troops of silent sparks, 
Now pausing, now scattering away as in fear, 
Go threading the soot-forest’s tangled darks 
Like herds of startled deer.” 
The elfin builders of the frost have raised even 
more delicate structures than the snow. The descrip- 
tive power of the poets in picturing nature’s handi- 
work cannot be better seen than in these passages. 
It is hardly worth while to suggest the points of 
resemblance which children will quickly detect in 
these passages, as the comparison of — 
“Through the deep gulf of the chimney wide 
Wallows the Yule-log’s roaring tide,”
-P-A-G-E-303
  
ILLUSTRATIVE LESSONS IN READING 293 
with this, — 
“The merrier up its roaring draught 
The great throat of the chimney laughed.” 
Such passages, suggesting like thoughts in earlier 
studies, are very frequent and spring up in unex- 
| pected quarters. 
| For example, Emerson, in ‘ Waldeinsamkeit,” 
says: —   
“T do not count the hours I spend 
In wandering by the sea; 
The forest is my loyal friend, 
Like God it useth me.” 
Again, in the “ Apology,” he says: — 
“ Think me not unkind and rude 
That I walk alone in grove and glen; 
I go to the god of the wood 
To fetch his word to men.” 
And Lowell, in “ The Bobolink ” : — 
“ As long, long years ago I wandered, 
I seem to wander even yet. 
The hours the idle schoolboy squandered, 
The man would die ere he’d forget. 
O hours that frosty eld deemed wasted, 
Nodding his gray head toward my books, 
I dearer prize the lore I tasted 
With you, among the trees and brooks, 
Than all that I have gained since then 
From learned books or study-withered men.”
-P-A-G-E-304
204 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
And Whittier says :— 
“Our uncle, innocent of books, 
Was rich in lore of fields and brooks, 
The ancient teachers never dumb 
Of Nature’s unhoused lyceum.” 
It would not be difficult to recall other passages 
from Bryant, Shakespeare, Byron, and many others, 
expressing this love of solitude in woods or on the 
seashore, and the wisdom to be gained from such 
communion with nature. This active retrospect to 
gather up kindred thoughts out of previous studies 
and mingle them with the newer influx of radiant 
ideas from master minds is a fruitful mode of assim- 
ilating and compounding knowledge. It may be 
advisable at times for the teacher to bring together 
a few additional passages from still wider sources, 
expressive of a thought kindred to that worked out 
in the class. Such study leads to a self-reliant, en- 
thusiastic companionship with the thoughts of great 
men, and is most profitable. 
“ ODYSSEY ” 
The “Odyssey” is as well known as any master- 
piece in the world’s literature. For illustration, we 
will enter upon a brief discussion of the mode of 
handling it as a unit in the school. 
There are abundant sources in English from
-P-A-G-E-305
ILLUSTRATIVE LESSONS IN READING 295 
which the teacher can get an adequate knowledge 
of this great poem without using the original Greek. 
A few of the leading books are as follows: “ The 
Story of Ulysses” (Cook). A very simple, abbre- 
viated narrative of Ulysses’ wanderings sometimes 
used as a reading-book in fourth or fifth grade. (Pub- 
lic School Publishing Co.) —‘ Lamb’s Adventures of 
Ulysses.” A pleasing prose rendering of the chief 
incidents of the story, more difficult than the preced- 
ing. Sometimes used as a reader. (Ginn & Co.)— 
“Church’s Stories of the Old World,” in which ‘ The 
Adventures of Ulysses” forms a chapter. A good 
short treatment of the story in simple language. 
(Ginn & Co.) — ‘Ulysses among the Phzeacians,” con- 
sisting of selections from five books of the “Odyssey” 
as translated into verse by Bryant. This seems well 
adapted for use as a reading-book in fourth or fifth 
grade, and will be discussed more fully as such. 
(Houghton, Mifflin & Co.)—“ The, Odyssey of 
Homer,” by Palmer, is an excellent prose-poetic 
rendering of the whole poem, and is of great service 
to the teacher. (Houghton, Mifflin & Co.)— An- 
other excellent prose translation, by Butcher and 
Lang, has been much used. (The Macmillan Co.) 
— Bryant’s “ Homer’s ‘ Odyssey,’ ” a complete poetic 
rendering of the whole twenty-four books of the 
poem, is probably the best basis for school refer- 
ence and study of the poem. — “ National Epics,” by 
Rabb, has a good narrative and introduction for the
-P-A-G-E-306
  206 SPECIAL -METHOD IN READING 
“ Odyssey,” and a list of critical references. (A. C. 
McClurg & Co.) — “ Art and Humanity in Homer,” 
by Lawton, has an interesting discussion of the 
“Odyssey.” Other famous translations of the whole 
“Odyssey,” were made by Alexander Pope, William 
Cowper, George Chapman, and others. 
It is not unusual in schools for teachers to give 
children of the third or fourth grade an oral introduc- 
tion to the whole story in a series of lessons. This 
requires skill in presenting and discussing the epi- 
sodes, and should be attended by good oral repro- 
ductions by the children. Such oral work should be 
done in distinct lessons apart from the regular read- 
ing. Later, in fourth or fifth grade, the story is 
sometimes read in class from one of the simple prose 
narratives of Miss Cook, or Lamb, or Church. In 
the fifth or sixth grade, ‘Ulysses among the Phzea- 
cians” forms an interesting reading-book, with which 
to acquaint the children more fully with the poetic 
beauty and descriptive detail of the original, so far 
as it can be secured in English. In connection with 
such reading it may be interesting to choose from 
Bryant’s complete translation other selected parts of 
the story, and encourage the children to read them, 
if books from the library or homes can be provided. 
We may dwell for a moment upon those qualities of 
Homer’s story which have commanded the admira- 
tion ‘of the great poets in different ages and countries. 
The peculiar poetic charm and power of the original
-P-A-G-E-307
  ILLUSTRATIVE LESSONS IN READING 297 
Greek are probably untranslatable, although several 
‘eminent poets have attempted it. But we have at 
least both prose and verse renderings of it that are 
beautiful and poetic. 
Some of the critics have said that the whole 
poem is a unit in thought, — much more so than the 
“Tliad,’ — centring in the person of Ulysses. His 
wanderings and his final return constitute the thread 
of the narrative. In the main it is a story of peace, 
with descriptions of cities, islands, palaces, strange 
lands, and peaceful arts and manners. After their 
return from Troy we meet Nestor and Menelaus, 
dwelling happily in their palaces and surrounded 
with home comforts. Ulysses, himself, the great 
sufferer, is tossed about the world, or held captive 
on sea-girt, far-away islands. He passes through a 
series of wonderful adventures, keeping his alertness 
and balance of mind so completely that his name has 
become a synonym in all lands for shrewdness and 
far-seeing wisdom. And it is not only a wise percep- 
tion, but a self-control in the midst of old and new 
temptations which is most remarkable. This over- 
mastering shrewdness or calculation even overdoes 
itself and becomes amusing, when he tries, for 
example, to deceive his guardian goddess as to whom 
he is. The descriptions of women and of domestic 
life are famous and delightful. The constancy of 
Penelope, her industry and shrewdness in outwitting 
the suitors, have given her a supreme place among 
 
-P-A-G-E-308
  298 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
the women of story. The descriptions of peaceful 
manners and customs, of public games, of feasting 
and music, of palace halls and ornament, are among 
the great literary pictures of the world. 
The particular adventures through which Ulysses 
passed with Circe, with the Sirens, with Polyphemus, 
with Eolus, with the lotus-eaters, and others, are 
plainly suggestive of the dangers which threaten the 
.thoughtless minded, those who plunge headlong into 
danger without forethought. Ulysses is slow to give 
way to folly or passion, is bold and skilful in danger, 
and persevering to the last extreme. 
In the treatment of the “Odyssey,” the teacher 
will need a general knowledge of Greek mythology, 
which can be easily derived from “Greek Gods, 
Heroes, and Men” (Scott, Foresman, & Co.), and 
from several other of the reference books. Some 
study of Greek architecture, sculpture, and modes of 
life will be instructive and helpful, as given in Smith’s 
“History of Greece” and other histories. Pictures of 
Greek temples and ruins, sculpture, and palaces will | 
be pleasing and attractive to children. (See Liibke’s 
“ History of Art,” Vol. I, Dodd, Mead, & Co.) Some 
of the children’s books also contain good pictures. 
A good map, indicating the supposed wanderings 
of Ulysses in the Mediterranean, is given in several 
of the books, ¢.g. in Palmer’s “ Odyssey,” and fixes 
many of the most interesting events of the story. 
The teacher should not overlook the geography of
-P-A-G-E-309
ILLUSTRATIVE LESSONS IN READING 299 
the story and its relation to this and later studies in 
history, literature, and geography. 
In using “Ulysses among the Phzacians” as a 
reader in fourth or fifth grade, the first unit of study 
is the voyage of Ulysses on his raft, from the time 
of leaving Calypso till he is wrecked by the storm 
and driven upon the island of Scheria, the home of 
the Phzacians. We will suggest a few points in 
the treatment. The supposed places and the route 
of the voyage can be traced on the map. Let the 
teacher sketch it on the board in assigning the lesson. 
Suggest that the children locate in the sky the stars 
and constellations by which Ulysses is to direct his 
course. The story of the construction of the raft on 
which Ulysses is to make this journey, just preceding 
this part of the story, could be read to the class by 
the teacher, as it is not contained in these extracts. 
In length of time how does this voyage compare 
with a voyage across the Atlantic to-day? Why is it 
said, in line 329, that the Great Bear “alone dips not 
into the waters of the deep”? 
From previous studies, the children may be able 
to tell of Ulysses’ stay upon the island with Calypso. 
What may the children know of Neptune? Why is 
he angered with Ulysses? A picture of Neptune 
with the trident is in place. Explain the expression 
“while from above the night fell suddenly.” Was 
Ulysses justified in saying, “ Now must I die a miser- 
able death”? In spite of the desperate storm, in
-P-A-G-E-310
  300 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
what ways does Ulysses struggle to save his life? 
How do the gods assist him? In what way does 
this experience of Ulysses remind us of Robinson 
Crusoe’s shipwreck and escape? 
With how many men had Ulysses started on his 
way to Troy? Now he alone escapes after great 
suffering and hopeless buffetings. In what way 
during this voyage and shipwreck did Ulysses display 
his accustomed shrewdness and foresight? After 
landing, what dangers did he still fear? 
The nearly three hundred lines of Book V, which 
give this account of Ulysses’ voyage and shipwreck, 
will require several lessons, and the above questions 
are but a few of those raised in its reading and dis- 
cussion. When Neptune, Ulysses, or Ino speaks, let 
the speaker be impersonated so as to give greater 
force and reality. In the next book (VI), there is 
more of dialogue and better opportunity for variety 
of manner and voice. 
It would be tedious to enter into further detail 
suggesting questions. But we may believe that a 
spirited treatment of this part of the story of Ulysses 
in reading lessons, including his stay and treatment 
among the Phzacians, will give the children much 
appreciation of the beauty and power of this old 
story. By means of occasional readings of other 
selected parts of the “ Odyssey,” from Bryant or 
Palmer, some of the most striking pictures in the 
story of his wanderings can be presented. Even
-P-A-G-E-311
  ILLUSTRATIVE LESSONS IN READING 301 
the children may find time for some of this addi- 
tional, outside reading. In any event the story of 
Ulysses, as a piece of great literature, can thus be 
brought home to the understandings and hearts of 
children, and will constitute henceforward a part 
| of that rich furniture of the mind which we call 
, culture.

  CHAPTER XIV 
THE VALUE OF CLASSICS TO THE TEACHER 
In discussing the value and fruitfulness of this 
field of study to children, it is impossible to forbear 
the suggestion of its scope and significance for 
teachers. If the masters of song and expression 
are able to work so strongly upon the immature 
minds of children, how much deeper the influence 
upon the mature and thoughtful minds of teachable 
teachers! They above all others should have dis- 
positions receptive of the best educational influences. 
The duties and experiences of their daily work pre- 
dispose them toward an earnest and teachable spirit. 
In very many cases, therefore, their minds are wide 
open to the reception of the best. And how deep 
and wide and many-sided is this enfranchisement of 
the soul through literature! 
It is a gateway to history; not, however, that cast- 
away shell which our text-books, in the form of a dull 
recital of facts, call history; but its heart and soul, 
the living, breathing men and women, the source 
and incentive of great movements and _ struggles 
toward the light. Literature does not make the 
study of history superfluous, but it puts a purpose 
302
-P-A-G-E-313
THE VALUE OF CLASSICS TO THE TEACHER 303 
into history which lies deeper than the facts, it sifts 
out the wheat from the chaff, casts aside the super- 
ficial and accidental, and gets down into the deep 
current of events where living causes are at work. 
The “Courtship of Miles Standish,” for example, 
is deeper and stronger than history because it ideal- 
izes the stern and rigid qualities of the Puritan, while 
John Alden and Priscilla touch a deeper universal 
sympathy, and body forth in forms of beauty that 
pulsing human love which antedates the Puritan and 
underlies all forms of religion and society. 
Illustrative cases have been given in sufficient 
abundance to show that literature, among other 
things, has a strong political side. It grasps with 
a master hand those questions which involve true 
patriotism. It exalts them into ideals, and fires the 
hearts of the people to devotion and sacrifice for 
their fulfilment. ¢ 
Burke’s “ Oration on the American War” is, to one 
who has studied American history, an astonishing 
confirmation of how righteous and far-sighted were 
the principles for which Samuel Adams and the 
other patriots struggled at the opening of the Revo- 
lution. Webster’s speech at Bunker Hill is a graphic 
and fervent retrospect on the past of a great struggle, 
and a prophetic view of the swelling tide of indi- 
vidual, social, and national well-being. 
If the teacher is to interpret history to school 
children, he must learn to grasp what is essential
-P-A-G-E-314
  304 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
and vital; he must be able to discriminate between 
those events which are trivial and those of lasting 
concern. The study of our best American literature 
will reveal to him this distinction, and make him a 
keen and comprehensive critic of political affairs. 
Barnett, in his “Common Sense in Education and 
Teaching ” (p. 170), says: — 
“In the second place, literature provides us with 
historical landmarks. We cannot be said to under- 
stand the general ‘ history’ of a particular time unless 
we know something of the thought that stirred its 
most subtle thinkers, and interpreted and made articu- 
late the spirit of the times in which they lived. The 
most notable facts in the history of the times of 
Edward III, of Elizabeth, and of Victoria are that 
Chaucer and Shakespeare and Tennyson and their 
contemporaries lived and wrote. Political history, 
social history, economic history, even ecclesiastical his- 
tory, are all reflected, illustrated, and interpreted by 
what we find in the great works of contemporary 
literature.” 
Charles Kingsley, in his “Literary and General 
Essays” (p. 249), holds a like opinion :— 
“T said that the ages of history were analogous to 
the ages of man, and that each age of literature was 
the truest picture of the history of its day, and for 
this very reason English literature is the best, per- 
haps the only, teacher of English history, to women 
especially. For it seems to me that it is principally by
-P-A-G-E-315
  THE VALUE OF CLASSICS TO THE TEACHER 305 
the help of such an extended literary course that we 
can cultivate a just and enlarged taste which will con- 
nect education with the deepest feelings of the heart.” 
Literature is also a mirror that reflects many sides 
of social life and usage. There is no part of a 
teacher’s education that is so vital to his practical 
success as social culture. John Locke’s “ Thoughts 
on Education” are, in the main, an inquiry into the 
methods and means by which an English gentleman 
can be formed. The aim of the tutor who has this 
difficult task is not chiefly to give learning, to fill the 
mind with information, to develop mentality, but to 
train the practical judgment in harmony with gentle- 
manly conduct. The tutor, himself a scholar, is to 
know the world, its ins and outs, its varieties of social 
distinction and usage, its snares and pitfalls, its wise 
men and fools. The child is to learn to look the 
world in the face and understand it, to know himself 
and to be master of himself and of his conduct, to 
appreciate other people in their moods and characters, 
and to adapt himself prudently and with tact to the 
practical needs. The gentleman whom Locke sets 
up as his ideal is not a fashion-plate figure, not a 
drawing-room gallant, but a clear-headed man who 
understands other people and himself, and has been 
led by insensible degrees to so shape his habitual 
conduct as most wisely to answer his needs in the 
real world. Emerson, with all his lofty idealism and 
unconventionalism, has an ideal of education nearly 
x
-P-A-G-E-316
  306 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
akin to that of Locke. This social ideal of Locke 
and Emerson is one that American teachers can well 
afford to ponder. As a nation, we have been accus- 
tomed to think that a certain amount of roughness 
and boorishness was necessary as a veil to cover the 
strongest manly qualities. Smoothness and tact and 
polish, however successful they may be in real life, 
are, theoretically at least, ata discount. The Adamses, 
Jefferson, Jackson, Lincoln, Thoreau, were men who 
did violence in a good many ways to social usages, 
and we may admire their faults overmuch. 
To the teacher who stands in the presence of thirty 
or fifty distinct species of incipient men and women, 
social insight and culture, the ability to appreciate 
each in his individual traits, his strength or weakness, 
are a prime essential to good educative work. 
Now, there are two avenues through which social 
culture is attainable, — contact with men and women 
in the social environment which envelops us all, and 
literature. Literature is, first of all, a hundred-sided 
revelation of human conduct as springing from motive. 
Irving, Hawthorne, Longfellow, Holmes, and Lowell 
are revealers of humanity. Still more so are Dickens 
and Eliot and Shakespeare and Goethe. To study 
these authors is not simply to enjoy the graphic 
power of an artist, but to look into the lives of so 
many varieties of men and women. They lay bare 
the heart and its inward promptings. Our apprecia- 
tion for many forms of life under widely differing
-P-A-G-E-317
  THE VALUE OF CLASSICS TO THE TEACHER 307 
conditions is awakened. We come in touch with 
those typical varieties of men and women whom we 
shall daily meet if we will but notice. It broadens 
one’s perceptions and sympathies, it reveals the 
many-sidedness of human life. It suggests to a 
teacher that the forty varieties of humanity in her 
schoolroom are not after one pattern, nor to be 
manipulated according to a single device. 
The social life that surrounds each one of us is 
small and limited. Our intimate companionships are 
few, and we can see deeply into the inner life of but 
a small portion even of those about us. The deeper 
life of thought and feeling is largely covered up with 
conventionalities and externalities. But in the works 
of the best novelists, dramatists, and poets, we may 
look abroad into the whole world of time and place, 
upon an infinite variety of social conditions, and we 
are permitted to see directly into the inner thought 
and motive, the very soul of the actors. Yet fidelity 
to human nature and real life is claimed to be the 
peculiar merit of these great writers. By the com- 
mon consent of critics, Shakespeare is the prince of 
character delineators. Schlegel says of him: — 
“Shakespeare’s knowledge of mankind has become 
proverbial; in this his superiority is so great that he 
has justly been called the master of the human heart. 
A readiness to remark the mind’s fainter and invol- 
untary utterances, and the power to express with cer- 
tainty the meaning of these signs, as determined by
-P-A-G-E-318
  308 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
experience and reflection, constitute ‘the observer of 
men.’” 
“ After all, a man acts so because he is so. And 
what each man is, that Shakespeare reveals to us 
most immediately ; he demands and obtains our be- 
lief, even for what is singular and deviates from the 
ordinary course of nature. Never perhaps was there 
so comprehensive a talent for characterization as 
Shakespeare. It not only grasps every diversity of 
rank, age, and sex, down to the lispings of infancy ; 
not only do the king and the beggar, the hero and 
the pickpocket, the sage and the idiot, speak and act 
with equal truthfulness; not only does he transport 
himself to distant ages and foreign nations, and por- 
tray with the greatest accuracy (a few apparent vio- 
lations of costume excepted) the spirit of the ancient 
Romans, of the French in the wars with the English, 
of the English themselves during a great part of their 
history, of the Southern Europeans (in the serious 
part of many comedies), the cultivated society of the 
day, and the rude barbarism of a Norman foretime; 
his human characters have not only such depth and 
individuality that they do not admit of being classed 
under common names, and are inexhaustible even in 
conception, —no, this Prometheus not merely forms 
men, he opens the gates of the magical world of 
spirits.” 
What is true of Shakespeare in a preéminent 
degree is true to a marked extent of all the great 
novelists and poets.
-P-A-G-E-319
  THE VALUE OF CLASSICS TO THE TEACHER 309 
The teacher needs to possess great versatility and 
tact in social situations. A quick insight, social 
ease, freedom, and self-possession are of the first 
importance to him. The power of sympathy, of 
appreciation for others’ feelings and difficulties, is 
wholly dependent upon such social cultivation. 
Otherwise the teacher will be rude, even uncouth 
and boorish in manner, producing friction and ill- 
will where tact and gentleness would bring sympathy 
and confidence. Many people absorb this refine- 
ment of thought and manner from the social circles 
with which they mingle, and it is, of course, a smil- 
ing fortune that has placed a teacher’s early life in 
a happy and cultured atmosphere, where the social 
sympathies and graces are absorbed almost uncon- 
sciously. But even where the earlier conditions 
have been less favorable, the opportunity for rapid 
social development and culture is most promising. 
The numberless cases in our country in which young 
people, by the strength of their energetic purpose 
and desire for improvement, have raised themselves 
not only to superior knowledge and scholarship, but 
also to that far greater refinement of social life and 
manner which we call true culture, — the numberless 
instances of this sort are a surprising indication of 
the power of education. Literature has been a 
potent agent in this direction. It emancipates, it 
sets free, the spirit of man. It lifts him above what 
is sordid and material, and gives him those true
-P-A-G-E-320
  310 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
standards of worth with which to measure all things. 
It contains within itself the refining elements, the 
zesthetic and ethical ideals, and, best of all, it por- 
trays human life in all its thought, feeling, and 
passion with such intensity and realistic fidelity that 
its teaching power is unparalleled. 
This potentiality of the better literature to produce 
such noble results in the higher range of culture is 
dependent upon conditions. No one will understand 
literature who does not study and understand ordi- 
nary life as it surrounds him; who does not con- 
stantly draw upon his own experience in interpreting 
the characters portrayed in books. No stupid or 
unobservant person will be made wise through books, 
be they never so choice. Even the student who 
works laboriously at his text-books, but has no eye 
nor care for the people or doings about him, is get- 
ting only the mechanical side of education, and is 
losing the better part. He who will draw riches out 
of books must put his intellect and sympathy, his 
whole enthusiastic better self, into them. 
The indwelling virtue of great books is that they 
demand this intense awakening, this complete absorp- 
tion of the whole self. The mind of a child and of 
a man or woman has to stretch itself to the utmost 
limit to take in the message of a great writer. One 
feels the old barriers giving way and the mind ex- 
panding to the conception of larger things. Speak- 
ing of the ancient drama at Athens, Shelley says,
-P-A-G-E-321
  THE VALUE OF CLASSICS TO THE TEACHER 311 
“The imagination is enlarged by a sympathy with 
pains and passions so mighty that they distend in 
their conception the capacity of that by which they 
are conceived.” 
Those who have received into the inner self the 
expansive energy of noble thought and social culture, 
are the better qualified, from the rich variety of the 
inner life, to act effectively upon the complex con- 
ditions and forces of the outer world. The teacher 
whose inner life is teeming with these rich sympa- 
thies and potent ideals will react with greater pru- 
dence and tact upon the kaleidoscopic conditions of 
a school. 
Practical social life and literature are not distinct 
modes of culture. They are one, they interact upon 
each other in scores of ways. Give a teacher social 
opportunities, give him the best of our literature, let 
these two work their full influence upon him, — then, 
if he cannot become a teacher, it is a hopeless case. 
Let him go to the shop, to the farm, to the legisla- 
ture; there is no place for him in the schoolroom. 
Literature is also a sharp and caustic critic of his 
own follies or foibles, to one who can reflect. It has 
a multitude of surprises by which we are able, as 
Burns wished, — 
“To see oursels as ithers see us.” 
Even the schoolmaster finds an occasional apt de- 
scription of himself in literature which it is often 
 
-P-A-G-E-322
312 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
interesting and entertaining for him to ponder. One 
of the most familiar is that of Goldsmith in “The 
Deserted Village” : — 
“ Beside yon straggling fence that skirts the way 
With blossom’d furze unprofitably gay, 
There, in his noisy mansion, skill’d to rule, 
The village master taught his little school. 
A man severe he was, and stern to view; 
I knew him well, and every truant knew: 
Well had the boding tremblers learn’d to trace 
The day’s disasters in his morning face ; 
Full well they laugh’d, with counterfeited glee, 
At all his jokes, for many a joke had he; 
Full well the busy whisper, circling round, 
Convey’d the dismal tidings when he frown’d. 
Yet he was kind, or, if severe in aught, 
The love he bore to learning was in fault. 
The village all declar’d how much he knew; 
’Twas certain he could write, and cipher too; 
Lands he could measure, terms and tides presage, 
And even the story ran that he could gauge ; 
In arguing, too, the parson own’d his skill, 
For even though vanquish’d he could argue still; 
While words of learned length and thundering sound 
Amaz’d the gazing rustics rang’d around ; 
And still they gaz’d, and still the wonder grew 
That one small head could carry all he knew.” 
A like entertainment and suggestion of what the 
schoolmaster may be, as seen by others, are fur- 
nished by Irving’s Ichabod Crane. William Shen- 
stone’s description of the schoolmistress and the 
school near two hundred years ago in his native 
village, is very diverting. Charles Dickens’s descrip-
-P-A-G-E-323
  THE VALUE OF CLASSICS TO THE TEACHER 313 
tion of schools and schoolmasters is important in 
the history of England, and, like his portrayals 
of child life generally, of deep pedagogical worth 
to teachers. 
In his book, “The Schoolmaster in Literature,” 
Mr. Skinner has done a real service to the teaching 
world in bringing together, into a convenient com- 
pilation from many sources, the literature bearing 
directly upon the schoolmaster. Even the comic 
representations and caricatures are valuable in call- 
ing attention to common foibles and mannerisms, to 
say nothing of the more serious faults of teachers. 
It is in literature, also, and in those lives and 
scenes from history which literary artists have 
worked up, that the teacher can best develop his 
own moral ideals and strengthen the groundwork of 
his own moral character. The stream will not rise 
above its source, and a teacher’s moral influence in 
a school will not reach above the inspirations from 
high sources which he himself has felt. Those 
teachers who have devoted themselves solely to the 
mastery of the texts they teach, who have read little 
from our best writers, are drawing upon a slender 
capital of moral resource. Not even if home influ- 
ences have laid a sound basis of moral habits are 
these sufficient reserves for the exigencies of teach- 
ing. The moral nature of the teacher needs con- 
stant stimulus to upward growing, and the children 
need examples, ideal illustrations, life and blood im-
-P-A-G-E-324
  314 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
personations of the virtues ; and literature is the chief 
and only safe reservoir from which to draw them. 
We have already discussed the moral value of the 
right books for children. The lessons of the great 
works are so profound in this respect that they offer 
a still wider range of study to the teacher. Even 
the foremost thinkers and philosophers have found 
therein an inexhaustible source of truth and wisdom. 
In the Foreword to his “Great Books as Life 
Teachers,” Newell Dwight Hillis says, “For some 
reason our generation has closed its text-books on 
ethics and morals, and opened the great poems, 
essays, and novels.” This is a remarkable statement 
and is the key-note to a silent but sweeping change 
in education. He adds, “ Doubtless for thoughtful 
persons this fact argues, not a decline of interest in 
the fundamental principles of right living, but a 
desire to study these principles as they are made 
flesh and embodied in living persons.” Again, “It 
seems important to remember that the great novel- 
ists are consciously or unconsciously teachers of 
morals, while the most fascinating essays and poems 
are essentially books of aspiration and _ spiritual 
culture.” 
It is suggestive to note that this fundamental text 
is worked out in his book by chapters on Ruskin’s 
“Seven Lamps of Architecture,” George Eliot’s 
“Romola,”’ Hawthorne’s “Scarlet Letter,” Victor 
Hugo’s “Les Miserables,” Tennyson’s “Idylls of
-P-A-G-E-325
  THE VALUE OF CLASSICS TO THE TEACHER 315 
the King,” and Browning’s “Saul.” This suggests 
a fruitful line of studies for every teacher. 
Among modern essayists, Emerson, Carlyle, Rus- 
kin, and Matthew Arnold stand preéminent, and they 
are already well established among the mightiest 
teachers of our age, and it may be, of many to 
come. Sure it is that teachers could not do better 
than put themselves within earshot of these reso- 
nant voices. Their heart-strings will vibrate and 
their intellects will be stretched to a full tension, 
not simply by the music, but by the truth which 
surges up and bursts into utterance. It is scarcely 
a figure of speech to say that the lightning flashes 
across their pages. The stinging rebuke of wrong, 
the noble ideals of righteousness, place them among 
the prophets whose tongues have been touched with 
fire from the altar. 
Besides the historical, social, and moral tuition for 
teachers in literature, there are several other impor- 
tant culture effects in it. The deepest religious in- 
centives are touched, nature in her myriad phases is 
observed with the eye of the poet and scientist, and 
the esthetic side of poetry and rhythmic prose, its 
charm and graces of style, its music and eloquence, 
work their influence upon the reader. Literature is 
a harp of many strings, and happy is that teacher 
who has learned to detect its tones and overtones, 
who has listened with pleasure to its varied raptures, 
and has felt that expansion of soul which it produces.
-P-A-G-E-326
  316 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
Literature, in the sense in which we have been 
using it, has been called the literature of power, the 
literature of the spirit. That is, it has generative, 
spiritual life. It is not simple knowledge, it is 
knowledge energized, charged with potency. It is 
knowledge into which the poet has breathed the 
breath of life. The difference between bare knowl- 
edge and the literature of power is like the differ- 
ence between a perfect statue in stone and a living, 
pulsing, human form. 
One of the virtues of literature, therefore, is the 
mental stimulus, the joy, the awakening, the inten- 
sity of thought it spontaneously calls forth. Text- 
books are usually a bore, but literature is a natural 
resource even in hours of weariness. Who would 
dream of enlivening leisure hours or vacation rest 
with text-books of grammar, or arithmetic, or his- 
tory, or science? But the poet soothes with music, 
solemn or gay, according to our choice. If we go to 
the woods or lakes to escape our friends, we take one 
of the masters of song with us. After a day of toil 
and weariness, we can turn to “ Evangeline,” or 
“Lady of the Lake,” or the “Vision of Sir Launfal,” 
and soon we are listening to— 
“The murmuring pines and the hemlocks,” 
or the echo of the hunter’s horn, — 
“The deep-mouthed bloodhound’s heavy bay 
Resounded up the rocky way,
-P-A-G-E-327
  THE VALUE OF CLASSICS TO THE TEACHER 317 
And faint, from farther distance borne, 
Were heard the clanging hoof and horn,” 
At a time when we are not fit for the irksome and 
perfunctory preparation of text-book lessons, we are 
still capable of receiving abundant entertainment or 
hearty inspiration from Warner’s “How I killed a 
Bear,” or Tennyson’s “Enoch Arden,” or “ Sleepy 
Hollow.” Literature is recreation in its double 
sense. It gives rest and relief, and it builds up. 
Teachers should shake themselves free from the 
conviction that severe disciplinary studies are the 
best part of education. They have their well- 
merited place. But there are higher spiritual foun- 
tains from which to draw. Read the lives of Scott, 
Macaulay, Irving, Hawthorne, and Emerson, and 
discover that the things we do with the greatest 
inward spontaneity and pleasure and ease are often 
the best. 
Literature, both in prose and verse, is what the 
teacher needs, because our best authors are our 
best teachers in their method of handling their sub- 
jects. They know how to find access to the reader’s 
mind by making their ideas attractive, interesting, 
and beautiful. They seem to know how to sharpen 
the edge of truth to render it more keen and inci- 
sive. They drive truth deeper, so that it remains 
embedded in the life and thought. Let a poet clothe 
an idea with strength and wing it with fancy, and it
-P-A-G-E-328
  318 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
will find its way straight to the heart. First of all, 
nearly all our classic writers, especially those we 
use in the grades, handle their subjects from the 
concrete, graphic, picturesque side. They not only 
illustrate abundantly from nature and real things in 
life; they nearly always individualize and personify 
their ideas. Virtue to a poet is nothing unless it 
is impersonated. A true poet is never abstract or 
dry or formal in his treatment of a subject. It is 
natural for a literary artist, whether in verse or prose, 
to create pictures, to put all his ideas into life forms 
and bring them close to the real ones in nature. 
Homer’s idea of wisdom is Minerva, war is Mars, 
strength is Ajax, skill and prudence are Ulysses, 
faithfulness is Penelope. Dickens does not talk about 
schoolmasters in general, but of Squeers. Shake- 
speare’s idea of jealousy is not a definition, not a 
formula, but Othello. Those books which have 
enthralled the world, like “ Robinson Crusoe,” “ Pil- 
grim’s Progress,” “Gulliver's Travels,” ‘“ Arabian 
Nights,” “Evangeline,” “Ivanhoe,” ‘“ Merchant of 
Venice,” —they deal with no form of classified or 
generalized knowledge; they give us no definitions, 
they are scenes from real life. They stand among 
realities, and their roots are down in the soil of 
things. They are persons hemmed in by the close 
environment of facts. 
This realism, this objectifying of thought, this liv- 
ing form of knowledge, is characteristic of all great
-P-A-G-E-329
  THE VALUE OF CLASSICS TO THE TEACHER 319 
writers in prose or verse. The novelist, the romancer, 
the poet, the orator, and even the essayist, will always 
put the breath of reality into his work by an infu- 
sion of concreteness, of graphic personification. The 
poet’s fancy, building out of the abundant materials 
of sense-experience, is what gives color and warmth 
to all his thoughts. Strong writers make incessant 
use of figures of speech. Their thought must clothe 
itself with the whole panoply of imagery and graphic 
representation in order to be efficient in the warfare 
for truth. 
What a lesson for the teacher! What models upon 
which to develop his style of thinking! If the teach- 
ing profession and its work could be weighed in the 
balance, the scale would fall on the side of the 
abstract with a heavy thud. Not that object lessons 
will save us. They only parody the truth. For the 
object lesson as a separate thing we have no use at 
all. But to ground every idea and every study in 
realism, to pass up steadily through real objects and 
experience to a perception of truths which have wide 
application, to science — this is the true philosophy 
of teaching. 
The classic writers lead us even one grand step 
beyond realism. The fancy builds better than the 
cold reason. It adorns and ennobles thought till it 
becomes full-fledged for the flight toward the ideal. 
As the poet, standing by the sea-shore, ponders the 
life that has been in the now empty shell washed up
-P-A-G-E-330
  320 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
from the deep, his fancy discovers in the shell a re- 
semblance to human life and destiny, and he cries ; — 
“Build thee more stately mansions, O my soul, 
As the swift seasons roll ! 
Leave thy low-vaulted past ! 
Let each new temple, nobler than the last, 
Shut thee from heaven with a dome more vast, 
Till thou at length art free, 
Leaving thine outgrown shell by life’s unresting sea !” 
Is it possible that one could fall under the sway of 
the poets and artists, appropriate their images and 
fruitful style of thought, be wrought upon by their 
fancies, and still remain dull and lifeless and prosaic 
in the class-room? No wonder that true literature 
has been called the literature of power, as distin- 
guished from the literature of knowledge (supple- 
mentary readers, pure science, information books, 
etc.). The lives and works of our best writers con- 
tain an expansive spiritual energy, which, working 
into the mind of a teacher, breaks the shell of 
mechanism and formality. The artist gives bright 
tints and colors to ideas which would otherwise be 
faded and bleached. 
The study of the best literature adapted to chil- 
dren in each age is a fruitful form of psychology and 
child study. The series of books selected for the 
different grades is supposed to be adapted to the 
children at each period, The books which suit
-P-A-G-E-331
  THE VALUE OF CLASSICS TO THE TEACHER 321 
the temper and taste of children in primary grades 
are peculiar in quality, and fit those pupils better 
than older ones. In intermediate classes the boyhood 
spirit, which delights in myth, physical deeds of 
prowess, etc., shows itself, and many of the stories, 
ballads, and longer poems breathe this spirit. In 
grammar grades the expanding, maturing minds of 
children leap forward to the appreciation of more 
complex and extended forms of literature which deal 
with some of the great problems of life more 
seriously, as ‘“ Snow-Bound,” “ Evangeline,” “ Roger 
de Coverley,” “ Merchant of Venice,” etc. 
Any poem or story which is suited to pupils of the 
common school may generally be used in several 
grades. Hawthorne’s “ Wonder Book,” for instance, 
may be used anywhere from the third to the eighth 
grade by a skilful teacher. But for us the impor- 
tant question is, to what age of children is it best 
adapted? Where does its style of thought best fit 
the temper of the children? The eighth grade may 
read it and get pleasure and good from it, but it does 
not come up to the full measure of their needs. Chil- 
dren of the third grade cannot master it with sufficient 
ease, but in the latter part of the fourth or first part 
of the fifth grade it seems to exactly suit the wants, 
that is, the spiritual wants, of the children. It will 
vary, of course, in different schools and classes. Now, 
it is a problem for our serious consideration to deter- 
mine what stories to use and just where each belongs, 
=
-P-A-G-E-332
  322 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
within reasonable limits. Let us inquire where 
the best culture’ effect can be realized from each 
book used, where it is calculated to work its best 
and strongest influence. To accomplish this result 
it is necessary to study equally the temper of the 
children and the quality of the books, to seek the 
proper food for the growing mind at its different 
stages. This is not chiefly a matter of simplicity or 
complexity of language. Our readers are largely 
graded by the difficulty of language. But literature 
should be distributed through the school grades 
according to its power to arouse thought and interest. 
Language will have to be regarded, but as secondary. 
Look first to the thought material which is to engage 
children’s minds, and then force the language into 
subservice to that end. The final test to determine 
the place of a selection in the school course must be 
the experiment of the classroom. We may exercise 
our best judgment beforehand, and later find that a 
classic belongs one or two grades higher or lower 
than we thought. 
We really need some comprehensive principle upon 
which to make the selection of materials as adapted 
to the nature (psychology) of children. The theory 
of the culture epochs of race history as parallel to 
child development offers at least a suggestion. A 
few of the great periods of history seem to correspond 
fairly well to certain epochs of child growth. The 
age of folk-lore and the fairy tale is often called the
-P-A-G-E-333
  THE VALUE OF CLASSICS TO THE TEACHER 323 
childhood of the race; the predominance of the 
imagination and of the childlike interpretation of 
things in nature reminds us strikingly of the fancies 
of children. We find also that the literary remains 
of this epoch in the world’s history, the fairy tales, 
are the peculiar delight of children from four to six. 
In like manner the heroic age and its literary prod- 
ucts seem to fascinate the children of nine to eleven 
years. In connection with this theory it is observed 
that the greatest poets of the world in different 
countries are those who have given poetic form and ex- 
pression to the typical ideas and characters of certain 
epochs of history. So Homer, Virgil, Dante, Milton, 
Scott. The best literature is, much of it, the precipi- 
tate of the thought and life of historical epochs in 
race development. Experiment has shown that 
much of this literature is peculiarly adapted to exert 
strong culture influence upon children. Emerson, in 
his “Essay on History,” says: “ What is the founda- 
tion of that interest all men feel in Greek history, let- 
ters, art, and poetry, in all its periods, from the Heroic 
or Homeric age down to the domestic life of the 
Athenians and Spartans, four or five centuries later? 
What but this, that every man passes personally 
through a Grecian period?” And again: “The stu- 
dent interprets the age of chivalry by his own age of 
chivalry, and the days of maritime adventure and cir- 
cumnavigation by quite parallel miniature experiences 
of hisown. To the sacred history of the world, he has
-P-A-G-E-334
  324 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
the same key. When the voice of a prophet out of the 
deeps of antiquity merely echoes to him a sentiment of 
his infancy, a prayer of his youth, he then pierces to the 
truth through all the confusion of tradition and the 
caricature of institutions.” The literary heritage of 
the chief culture epochs is destined therefore to enter 
as a powerful agent in the education of children in 
our schools, and the place of a piece of literature in 
history suggests at least its place in child culture. 
The study of these literary masterpieces, the choic- 
est of the world, while it offers a broad perspective 
of history, also enters deep into the psychology of 
children and their periods of growth and change. 
What a study for the teacher! 
Suppose now that a wise selection of the best 
products for school use had been made. The books 
for each grade would respond not only to the ability 
but to the characteristic temper and mental status 
of children at that age. The books would arouse 
the full compass of the children’s mental power, 
their emotional as well as intellectual capacities, 
their sympathy, interest, and feeling. The teacher 
who is about to undertake the training of these 
children may not know much about children of that 
age. How can she best put herself into an attitude 
by which she can meet and understand the children 
on their own ground? Not simply their intellectual 
ability and standing, but, better still, their impulses 
and sympathies, their motives and hearts? Most
-P-A-G-E-335
  THE VALUE OF CLASSICS TO THE TEACHER 325 
people, as they reach maturity and advance in years, 
have a tendency to grow away from their childhood. 
Their purposes have changed from those of childhood 
to those of mature life. They are no longer interested 
in the things that interest children. Such things seem 
trivial and even incomprehensible to them. 
Now the person who is preparing to be a teacher 
should grow back into his childhood. Without losing 
the dignity or purpose of mature life, he should allow 
the memories and sympathies of childhood to revive. 
The insight which comes from companionship and 
sympathy with children he needs in order to guide 
them with tact and wisdom. 
The literature which belongs to any age of child- 
hood is perhaps the best key to the spirit and dispo- 
sition of that period. The fact that it is of permanent 
worth makes it a fit instrument with which the teacher 
may reawaken the dormant experiences and mem- 
ories of that period in his own life. The teacher 
who finds it impossible to reawaken his interest in the 
literature that goes home to the hearts of children 
has prima facie evidence that he is not qualified to 
stimulate and guide their mental movements. The 
human element in letters is the source of its deep 
and lasting power; the human element in children 
is the centre of their educative life, and he who dis- 
regards this and thinks only of intellectual exercises 
is a poor machine. The literature which children 
appreciate and love is the key to their soul life. It
-P-A-G-E-336
  326 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
has power to stimulate teacher and pupil alike, and 
is therefore a common ground where they may both 
stand and look into each other’s faces with sympathy. 
This is not so much the statement of a theory as 
a direct inference from many observations. It has 
been observed repeatedly, in different schools under 
many teachers, that the “ Lady of the Lake,” “Vision 
of Sir Launfal,” “Sleepy Hollow,” or “Merchant of 
Venice” have had an astonishing power to bring 
teacher and children into near and cherished com- 
panionship. It is not possible to express the profound 
lessons of life that children get from the poets. In 
the prelude to Whittier’s “ Among the Hills,” what 
a picture is drawn of the coarse, hard lot of parents 
and children in an ungarnished home, “so pinched 
and bare and comfortless,” while the poem itself, a 
view of that home among the hills which thrift and 
taste and love have made, — 
“Invites the eye to see-and heart to feel 
The beauty and the joy within their reach ; 
Home and home loves and the beatitudes 
Of nature free to all.” 
To study such poetry in its effect upon children is a 
monopoly of the rich educational opportunity which 
falls naturally into the hands of teachers. Psychol- 
ogy, as derived from text-books, is apt to be cold 
and formal; that which springs from the contact of 
young minds with the fountains of song lives and 
breathes. If a teacher desires to fit herself for
-P-A-G-E-337
  
  THE VALUE OF CLASSICS TO THE TEACHER 327 
primary instruction, she can do nothing so well calcu- 
lated to bring herself ex rapport with little children 
as to read the nursery rhymes, the fairy tales, fables, 
and early myths. They bring her along a charming 
road into the realm of childlike fancies and sympa- 
thies, which were almost faded from her memory. 
The same door is opened through well-selected 
literature to the hearts of children in intermediate 
and grammar grades. 
The sense of humor is cultivated in literature 
better than elsewhere. In fact, no other study 
contains much material of humorous quality. A 
quick sense of it is deemed by many of the best 
judges an indispensable quality in teachers. Not 
that a teacher needs to be a diverting story-teller 
or entertainer, if only he has an indulgent patience 
and kindly sympathy for those who enjoy telling 
stories. There is a certain hearty, wholesome social 
spirit in the enjoyment of humor which diffuses 
itself like sunlight through a school. It contains an 
element of kindliness, humanity, and good fellowship 
which lubricates all the machinery and takes away 
unnecessary stiffness and gravity in conduct. Best 
of all it is a sort of mental balance-wheel for the 
teacher, which enables him to see the ludicrous 
phases of his own behavior, should he be inclined 
to run to foolish extremes in various directions. 
Much of our best literature abounds in humorous 
elements. Lowell, Holmes, Shakespeare, and Irving
-P-A-G-E-338
  328 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
are spontaneously rich in this quality of ore, and it 
is just as well perhaps to cultivate our appreciation 
in these richer veins as in shallow and unproductive 
ones elsewhere. 
Schlegel says of Shakespeare, his “ comic talent 
is equally wonderful with that he has shown in the 
pathetic and tragic; it stands at an equal elevation 
and possesses equal extent and profundity. ... Not 
only has he delineated many kinds of folly, but even 
of sheer stupidity he has contrived to give a most 
diverting and entertaining picture.” 
The inability to appreciate the ludicrous and farci- 
cal, and especially of witty conceits, is felt to be a 
mark of dulness and heaviness, and in dealing with 
children and young people a versatile perception of 
the humorous is very helpful. Many of the pupils 
possess this quality of humor in a marked degree, 
and the teacher should at least have sufficient insight 
to appreciate this peculiar bent of mind and turn of 
wit. 
A brief retrospect will make plain the profitable- 
ness of classics to the teacher. They show a deep 
perspective into the spirit and inner workings of his- 
tory. The social life and insight developed by the 
study of literature give tact and judgment to under- 
stand and respect the many-sided individualities 
found in every school. The teacher’s own moral and 
zesthetic and religious ideals are constantly lifted and 
strengthened by the study of classics. Such reading 
 
-P-A-G-E-339
  THE VALUE OF CLASSICS TO THE TEACHER 329 
is a recreation and relief even in hours of weariness 
and solitude. It is an expansive spiritual power 
rather than a burden. Literary artists are also a 
standing illustration of the graphic, spirited manner 
of handling subjects. Finally, this rich and varied 
realm of classic thought and expression is the door- 
way by which we enter again into the moods and 
impulses and fancies of childhood. We thus revive 
our own youth and fit ourselves for a quick and ap- 
preciative perception of children’s needs. It is the 
best kind of child study. 
A few of the books which are suggestive, and illus- 
trate the value of literature for teachers, and in some 
cases even lay out lines of profitable and stimulative 
reading, are as follows : — 
Newell Dwight Hillis. Great Books and Life Teachers. (Flem- 
ing H. Revell Co.) ;

CHAPTER XV 
List or Books 
Tue following list of books, arranged according to 
grades, is designed to supply the children of the five 
grades, from the fourth to the eighth inclusive, with 
excellent reading matter in the form of complete 
masterpieces of American and English literature. 
It includes, besides the books for regular reading 
lessons, a large list of collateral and closely related 
works for the children and also for teachers. 
The books of these lists contain a rich and varied 
fund of finest culture material, first of all for the 
teacher, and, through her spirit and enthusiasm, for 
the children. 
Besides the general discussions of these books in 
the preceding chapters, a few additional explanations 
are necessary to make plain the grounds upon which 
this particular selection and arrangement of books is 
based. The whole purpose of the preceding chapters 
is to throw light upon this list, and to qualify the 
teacher for an intelligent and efficient use of these 
books as school readers. 
1. The books apportioned to each grade or year 
are divided into two series. The first series is care- 
331 
 
-P-A-G-E-342
  332 SPECIAL METHOD IN READING 
fully selected to serve as regular reading-books for 
that grade. Almost without exception they are com- 
plete works, or collections of complete poems, stories, 
etc. Many of them are very familiar and have been 
much used in the schools. The number of books for 
each grade is large, so as to have room for choice 
and adaptation to each class. 
The second series consists of closely related collat- 
eral readings derived from a much wider range of 
books in literature, history, and science. Many of 
these books of the second list are not so strictly mas- 
terpieces of literature,-but of a secondary rank as 
prose renderings of the great poems, myths, and 
stories of other languages, also American and Euro- 
pean history stories. These materials are well adapted 
for the reference studies and home readings of chil- 
dren. They all deal with interesting and worthy 
subjects of thought in a superior style. Many of 
these books, however, are great and permanent works 
of literature. They are materials, also, which the 
teacher should be familiar with. They should be 
constantly referred to and discussed in connection 
with the first series. It is quite probable that some 
teachers will prefer books of the second series for 
regular reading in the place of some suggested in 
the first series.

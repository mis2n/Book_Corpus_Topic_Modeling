  PREFACE 
  
‘Tux best way to help boys is to understand them. 
The purpose of this book is to endeavor to help parents and 
social workers to understand boys. 
The viewpoint is that of a father who has been forced by the 
exigencies of his vocation to find out how to accomplish his task. 
The experiences which are used as illustrations for the book are 
those of one who has been working with boys in a social and 
religious way for over twenty years. There is also the back- 
ground of wide and persistent reading. 
The book in the form in which it was written several years ago 
laid much emphasis upon the importance and methods of giving 
boys adult companionship in their gang life. It has had an 
influence in the development and extension of this work which 
has been gratifying to the writer. In the later editions the book 
has been completely rewritten with the interests of the parent 
in mind. In this edition the lists of books for further reading 
have been brought completely up to date.

“ His intimados, to confess a truth, were in the world’s eye 
a ragged regiment. He never cared greatly for the society of 
what are called good people. . . . He had a general aversion 
of being treated like a grave or respectable character. He 
herded always, while it was possible, with people younger than 
himself. His manners lagged behind his years. He was too 
much of the boy-man. The toga virilis never sate gracefully 
on his shoulders. The impressions of infancy had burnt into 
him, and he resented the impertinence of manhood. These 
were weaknesses; but such as they were, they are a key to 
explicate some of his writings.”

THE BOY PROBLEM 
iE 
BOY LIFE 
Tue period of a boy’s life is roughly divided as 
follows: Infancy, from birth to about six; childhood, 
from six to fourteen; adolescence, from about fourteen 
to manhood. 
It is not until about six that, with the 
rise and sensitization of memory, the 
continent of child-life appears above the sea to vision. 
Those years of molding and upheaval which we do 
not remember as to ourselves, and of which it is im- 
possible to secure verbal testimony, though silent, are 
not unimportant. Physically, infancy is characterized 
by the most restless, impulsive activity. “‘ The ‘period 
of greatest. physical activity, ina man’s life ends at Infancy 
—.about,_six.” The infant is like the wild creatures of 
the wood, and it is as cruel to confine the physical 
activities of young children as those of squirrels and 
swallows. Physically, these activities are struggles for 
what we call “ a constitution.” Mentally, they are the 
outreaching tendrils of instinct to grasp and com- 
prehend the furniture of life. Indeed, the infant boy 
appears to consist mostly of a bundle of instincts. Of 
these the simpler ones of grasping, locomotion, curi- 
osity, etc., are means of self-education, but the most 
marked is imitation. ‘‘ These instincts are implanted 
a

  for the sake of giving rise to habits. This purpose 
accomplished, the instincts, as such, fade away.” Mem- 
ory is now almost entirely concrete, and the infant 
cannot reason because he has no frontage. The im- 
agination is active but crude; as his intellect awakes 
the child questions omnivorously, but he is eredulous 
and superstitious. Religiously, his ideas are primitive; 
conscience is vague; he is “ an innocent Pharisee ”’; the 
will is as yet untrained and uncontrolled; endeavor is 
wholly self-regarding, and the infant’s religious life 
consists simply in practising the things that he has 
learned are right. 
Childhood is marked _by. less.violent 
but more self-directed physical activity; Childhood 
tagious diseases, and a further struggle for constitu- 
tional vitality (with a peculiarly sickly year at about 
eight); the development of the higher instincts rather 
than those of a merely animal quality; and the emerg- 
ence of the memory, the emotions, the imagination, and 
the self-consciousness. This period is a continuation 
of the first rather than the introduction to the third. 
These first two form that age of immaturity and de- 
pendence, longer than that granted to any other of the 
animal order, given té childhood for its protection and 
preparation in the home and the school for the larger 
tasks of social and independent manhood. 
bee panacts The instinet which is most prominent 
in Childhood 1 this period is the play-instinct. It is 
both.expression and means of education. 
It expresses the awakening instincts, and so teaches us 
what the child’s nature is. It is the natural way b.

  SO (G7 Ads DEVELOPMENT 
  which the child finds out things. The child’s manner 
of play at different ages is distinctive. Mr. Joseph Lee 
classifies the child in play as, in order, in the dramatic, 
the self-assertive, and the loyalty periods. 
The infant plays alone, by creeping, shaking, fond- 
ling, etc., developing the simpler instincts through 
curiosity and experiment. The boy-child begins to 
imagine and to personify in his games, and wishes 
often to play with others. But that this social instinct 
is as yet incomplete is shown by the fact that in games 
it is each one for himself; the team-work so admirable 
among young men is entirely lacking, and even in 
playing team-games each player seeks his own glory 
and repeatedly sacrifices the welfare of the team to 
himself. To take advantage of this play-instiuct, 
which enfolds in itself so many other instincts, is the 
newest problem in education. 
We may trust the school-teachers to utilize this play- 
instinct to its fullest in the schoolroom in so far as 
there is opportunity. But it remains for us in the 
home to do what the hurried teacher has little chance . 
to do, —- develop and encourage that side of the in- 
stinct which is expressed in the exercises of dramatic 
play and story-telling. If we are to have a generation 
of men who are more than money-grubbers, there must 
be a long era of free fancy in childhood, and, what with 
fairies driven out of the forests, and the forests them- 
selves cut down, and Santa Claus exiled from the home, 
and gnomes unknown in the firelight, — because we 
have no more firelight in our modern houses, — it is a 
very hard thing to do. Something may be accom- 
plished by people who are willing to try to do what

   Avidness THE BO) ¥ PROBLEM 
  ‘Alice did after the White Rabbit left her — find the 
golden key and peer once again into that Wonderland 
where Master Fourfeetfour lives, into which it is no use 
to hope to enter unless one performs that feat so much 
harder than being a child, namely, becoming one. 
The nearest approach to the proper state of mind 
possible to an adult seems to be to be rested and to 
try to look pleasant. This is the only feeble imitation of 
perpetual youth which most of us can reach, but it may 
do as a point of contact. It is as important for a parent 
to take time to be happy as to take time to be holy. 
A friend of mine has remarked that when the Al- 
mighty made the first man he made the world signifi- 
cant, but that when he made the first boy he made it 
interesting. He further went on to say that if God 
made man out of dust, he surely made boys out of 
dust and electricity. ‘It is the electricity that con- 
stitutes the boy problem.” i 
The electricity of childhood consists 
of Life chiefly of Avidness of Life. (The boy is 
all alive and alive all the time) His 
tendency to yell is simply the escape-valve of periodic 
physical explosions. Neither the good nor the bad 
boy dies young. By ten years of age the boy is per- 
fectly healthy, having had all the contagious. diseases, 
except fal'iug in love. He goes to bed dressed in 
order to be up in time for the whole of an anticipated 
to-morrow. It is hard to get him to bed at all, he is 
so afraid some fun may happen in the world while he 
is asleep that he may miss. It is this, I am sure, more 
than fears of what some one calls “ the predatory 
dark,” that makes him linger. And much of the time

  when he is awake he is like the man Paul knew, caught 
up into the third heaven, and whether in the body or 
out of the body I cannot tell, God knoweth. His con- 
ception of being grown up is, like what Ian Maclaren 
said was the English business man’s idea of heaven, 
a social function to which an invitation is an honor, 
but which it must be highly tiresome to attend. 
To children everything is in the 
_..Kingdom_of Now, Materials are gath- 
ered from its oldest sources, but they 
are all stamped with to-day. You have heard 
of the Sunday-school teacher who told the story of 
Elijah with a vividness born of a trained pedagogue’s 
instinct, and bethought herself at the close to ask the 
boys at what era they supposed his heroic deeds 
occurred. ‘“ Last week”’ was the unanimous response. 
As boys, “ we were the new heirs of creation not yet 
finished, and taking kindly to our original dust. If 
our sires were already looking forward to an inheritance 
beyond the grave, to us more particularly belonged the 
earth and the fulness thereof. We possessed the land 
and the’sea. We diffused our own radiance, and the 
very skies were blue for our sake.” 
Cannot we keep this winsome eagerness which so few 
adults of our time have succeeded in retaining? Or 
must we crush it out in the processes of education? 
Dr. Stanley Hall once said that the real fall of man 
is to do things without zest. 
I spoke of ‘the instincts as tendrils. 
They are the tendrils of character. 
The tite analogy of the tadpole is the 
most forceful one we have. The tadpole has a tail, > 11 Kingdom

  which disappears when he becomes a frog. Appar- 
ently we might as well amputate this useless and un- 
sightly appendage, but if we do we shall never have a 
fully developed frog. These savage instincts have no 
place in mature manhood, but if we commit surgery 
upon them, instead of using hygiene, we shall never 
get real manhood. Dr. Balliet was referring to the 
instinct of pugnacity once when he said: “ If you crush 
the fighting instinct, you get the coward; if you let it 
grow wild, you have the bully; if you train it, you have 
the strong, self-controlled man of will.” 
It was Dr. Balliet, again, who remarked that the 
instincts form what has been known as “ original sin.” 
Gerald Stanley Lee has also said that “ the mischief 
in a boy is the entire basis of his education. A boy 
could be made into a man out of the parts of him that 
his parents and teachers are trying to throw away.” 
Now, of course, it is nonsense to say that original sin, 
or any other, when it is finished, bringeth forth holiness. 
The query is whether we have been correct in calling 
mischief and natural instincts original sin, when their 
chief harm is not that they are wrong, but that we 
adults find them annoying. Is it not possible that if 
we take out of a boy, or neglect in our intercourse with 
him, the desire to play, move about, make a noise, and 
find out things by experiment, to whittle, camp out, 
and give shows, we are using surgery where simple 
hygiene is called for? “I am the tadpole of an arch- 
angel,” Victor Hugo once extravagantly exclaimed. 
Even in making archangels it seems extremely probable 
that we must expect and await the tadpole stage. If 
the man is to retain a wholesome humanism it

  must emerge from the joyous savagery of his own 
childhood. 
The years between five and twelve in childhood are 
the seven full years of Joseph’s vision, during which 
the chief part of wisdom is to store up fod for the 
leaner years that are to come. 
‘ During this period the boy has been Habits = ire 
in Childhood changing from a bundle of instincts to 
a bundle of habits. The trails are be- 
coming well-traveled roads. Boyhood is the time for 
forming habits, as adolescence is the time for shaping 
ideals. This is the era for conscience-building, as the 
later is the era for will-training. Politeness, moral con- 
duct, and even religious observance may now be made 
so much a matter of course that they will never seem 
foreign. The possibilities for wise parenthood to pre- 
empt the young soul for goodness are incalculable. We 
who are older know, as children cannot, that the habits 
formed in this period are strongly determinative of the 
future trend toward righteousness or wrong. Upon 
the very molecules themselves an implacable and un- 
erasable register is being made. 
One reason why this is true is because verbal memory 
is more acute than at any other period. ‘‘ The best 
period for learning a foreign language ends before 
fourteen.”” This power of absorption forms the char- 
acteristic of this second period. Our duty now is to 
feed the child. The boy of this period who was asked 
what he regarded as the essentials of a good church 
boys’ club and who replied succinctly, “‘ Feed and fun,” 
summed up the needs of his age most excellently. The 
boy can absorb more nutriment and also more informa-

-P-A-G-E-14
lbp aE BOY. PROBLEM 
  tion, more helpful or hurtful facts, more proverbs of 
wisdom, more Scripture and hymns, for future use, than 
ever again in his life. In this absorptive rather than 
in an originative quality is the strong distinction be- 
tween this period and that which follows. 
: Another reason why drill counts so 
strongly in this period is because it is 
peculiarly the Age of Law. Sir Joshua Fitch says it cor- 
responds to the Exodus and Leviticus stage of Israel’s 
development. Children now have the sense of authority 
and conformity even in their games. All adults are to 
them gigantic Olympians, and they are willing to accept 
the dictates of these lawgiyers without asking why. 
Seg Together with the ideas and ideals 
perednal which theyboy absorbs by precept and 
Responsibility | imitation there begins to appear some- 
oe time during this period the Sense of 
Pe nal Responsibility.’ This manifests itself not in 
the form of intellectual doubt or deep inquiry, but 
rather in the acknowledgment of being under law. The 
dawn of the sense of personal responsibility is often 
most painful. In infancy conscience was mostly hear- 
say, and the child would now fain prolong his too brief 
lease of the Garden of Eden. But here stands the angel 
of the flaming sword to tell him that henceforth he 
must earn his own moral decisions and, what is imme- 
diately more bitter, suffer for his own mistakes and mis- 
deeds. Life is no longer merely a play, with acted 
parts. It is now the real thing.

  one of the first. Although it be true, as Paolo Lom- 
broso says, that ‘ the child tends not to love but to 
be loved and exclusively loved,” yet his early attacks ~ 
of love mark the brightening dawn of the social and 
altruistic instincts; and so love for mother, for teacher, 
for some older friend who is an ideal, love for truth 
which is so startling in the unperverted child, love for 
God and good things as he and they are understood, — 
these are all characteristic of the warm-hearted days 
of boyhood. 
“ But,” adds an unknown writer, “ nothing was so 
rare among us as a self-confessed and mortified sinner; 
for in those days our sins distinguished us more than 
our virtues did afterward. Besides, humility was an 
unknown sentimentality with us. Our very Pharisa- 
ism consisted in thanking our heavenly bodies that we 
were not as good as some were.” ‘The religious life of 
a normal boy between six and twelve consists of good 
will and good conduct.

childhood as reproductions of the protracted and rela-

because these ages were so long and so deep, because 
man has been a savage so much longer than he has been 
a Christian, that this subconscious heritage needs to 
be recognized, and the work of habit-making, which 
is the analogue of that past, must, during childhood, be 
made the central endeavor of all nurture. This work 
of nurture Dr, Coe finely calls “ capturing a boy’s pre-

  suppositions.” It is conscience-building. We do well 
probably to button our own moral codes, like aprons, 
around the child for a time, but we do better if we train 
him always to “ speak the truth in his heart.” 
These barbarous manifestations are modified con- 
stantly by the fact that the child is living in modern 
conditions and influences. Says an editorial writer in 
the Independent: ““ We were cave-dwellers who stormed 
sixteenth century castles; Roman centurions setting up 
modern republics; we were Don Quixotes in valor; 
martyrs and fanatics in religion, but at heart we 
were always communists, who understood the com- 
mon law of possession better than some latter-day 
economists.” 
Insummary, we may call this the Old Testament era 
of the boy’s life. The Bible, that marvelous manual 
of pedagogy, has been thought to reflect in either Tes- 
tament childhood and adolescence. ‘“ The key of the 
Old Testament,” says Sheldon, “ is obedience.” This 
we have said is the key to childhood. The law must 
come before the gospel, the era of nature before the era 
of grace. Those old heroes were only great big boys, 
and it is an underlying sympathy with them which 
explains why boys of this age prefer the Old Testa- 
ment to the New. There are sound reasons why it 
should first be taught them. 
Especially in religious ideas are boys 
under twelve much like the ancients. 
Many times they actually pass through 
the stages of religion passed through by primitive 
peoples, namely, nature worship, mythology, fetichistic 
superstition. The contents of many a boy’s mind and

in Childhood

pocket reveal a recourse to charms, incantations, and 
anthropomorphisms. At the best the God of one’s 
childhood is but a great man, and it is a solemnizing 
fact that he often bears the face and nature of the 
child’s own earthly father. 
“ Having no enemies to forgive, our prayers were 
short, but our faith was expansive. We believed 
everything and sighed for more. Somewhere in the 
cool green shadows were good spirits that we never 
saw, whose influence our little pagan souls confessed. 
We dealt in miracles and prophecies as sincerely as ever 
did a Hebrew prophet. A chirruping cricket was the 
harbinger of fortune; if the leaves of a little whirlwind 
passed but once around our devoted heads we were 
‘invincible, and should a butterfly chance to brush 
our cheek with its happy wings, that was a token of 
joys to come. All things were to us the signs of 
blessings.” 
Dr. Coe, in tracing the normal religious development 
of a child of this period, shows that from the first the 
sense of dependence, which is the oldest and earliest 
type of religion, is answered to by a world of persons 
in the home. During this nature-worship period the 
child is led to discriminate between his parent and 
God. The age of fairy tale that follows corresponds to 
the myth-making period in history; and here, again, 
the question-impulse leads the child on into a world 
of higher and truer ideals. Then in the law-period 
“the family is the moral universe of the child,” but 
the child soon discovers that ‘ the parents are not the 
source of the law but the subjects of it, and so he 
projects into his ideal world a supreme moral will.”

-P-A-G-E-18
THE BOY PROBLEM 
  Adolescence is bounded at the be- 
ginning by approaching puberty, and at 
the end by complete manhood. The so-called Ameri- 
can boy, who was really a Persian in his love of war, 
or an Athenian each day telling or hearing some new 
thing, or a Hindu in his dreams, or a Hebrew in his 
business sense, is rapidly coming down through the 
millenniums, and has reached the days of Bayard and 
Siegfried and Launcelot. 
It is the time of change. By fifteen the brain stops 
growing in girth, the large arteries increase one third, 
the temperature rises one degree, the reproductive 
organs have functioned, the voice deepens, the stature 
grows by bounds, and the body needs more sleep and 
food than ever before. 
“ Puberty,” says Dr. W. 8. Christo- 
pher, “is the period of greatest strength 
and endurance and capacity for the 
mass of children. It is also the period of life when - 
every feature of the physical being finds its greatest 
range of variety among individuals.” It is the emo- 
tional age. No songs are too gay, no sorrows ever so 
tearful. It is the time for slang, because no words in 
any dictionary can possibly express all that crowds to 
~—aitierance. It is the time for falling in love most 
thoughtlessly and most unselfishly. The child wants 
to be entertained constantly. This is a natural con- 
dition. “It is as necessary to develop the blood- 
vessels of a boy as crying is those of a baby.” It is the 
enthusiastic age. The masklike, impassive face at this 
age is a sign of a loss of youth or of purity. ‘“ He who 
is a man at sixteen will be a child at sixty.”

The Emotional 
—Age x

SOC LAL DEVELOPMENT 
  This emotional, restless disposition, which is so 
closely associated with rapid and uneven growth, the 
new sense of power and of self-life and dreams of 
adventure, is often manifested in a craving to roam, 
to run away from home, to go to sea. 
There is a certain wild generousness and rude piety 
about this adventure-period. With what brilliant in- 
sight Mr. G. K. Chesterton has characterized it! “ This 
feeling for strange faces and strange lives, when it 
is felt keenly by a young man, almost always ex- 
presses itself in a desire after a kind of vagabond 
beneficence, a desire to go through the world scattering 
goodness like a capricious god.” 
Physical restlessness is often associated with intel- 
lectual restlessness and curiosity. It is a time of stub- 
born doubts, painful and dangerous, but signs of mental 
and moral health. Starbuck fixes the acme of the 
doubt-period at eighteen. Together with the doubts 
there is frequently an obstinate positiveness, so that, 
as Gulick says, ‘‘ The boy is a skeptic and a partisan at 
the same time.’ For several years after twelve a boy 
is apt to be filled with the feeling that there is some- 
thing about himself that needs to be settled. 
This widening of interests, emotional 
Social Devel- and intellectual, is accompanied by a opment during x c ee 
‘Adbleacence gradual social broadening-—While in 
the early part of this period egoistic 
emotions are apt to be disagreeably expressed, vented

one’s self and a finer recognition of others, Adoles-

  . THE BO NX. PROBLEM 
  cence has been termed an unselfing. There is a yearn- 
ing to be with and for one’s kind. This is seen in the 
growing team-work spirit in games, in the various clubs 
which now spring up almost spontaneously, in the 
slowly increasing interest in social gatherings and in 
the other sex. 
The suddenness with which loyalty 
to the gang is felt is illustrated by this 
story told by Mr. M. D. Crackel, superintendent of the 
West Side Boys’ Club of Cleveland. The boys were 
lining up on the gymnasium floor for a game. Two 
divisions were being formed by taking each alternate 
boy. For convenience, one group was designated the 
“‘A’s,” the other the “ B’s.”” The leader found that a 
mistake had been made in counting, and he asked the 
nearest boy to transfer from one side to the other. 
“Not much!” responded the loyal lad; “I’m an ‘A’ 
man to the backbone! ” 
Mr. J. Lewis Paton, the headmaster of the Manches- 
ter, England, high school, illustrates how readily this 
gang-spirit begins to shape ethical codes of conduct by 
the following incident: When Wellington College was 
founded, it was arranged, in order to prevent confusion, 
that one half the boys should report on Monday and 
the remaining half on Tuesday. One boy came on 
Tuesday, and in the course of a stroll proceeded to 
make a suggestion to one of the veterans of Monday. 
He proposed a certain line of action, whereupon the 
veteran observed, “ We don’t have anything of that 
sort here.” 
It is probably from the gang that most boys learn 
first how to codify their conduct, and while this code of 
20 Gang Loyalty

SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT « 
  honor is imperfect, it is apt to be pretty sound. This 
list of “ things a feller won’t do” soon becomes such 
a mighty judgment of the individual conscience that, 
as Mr. Paton goes on to say, “‘ Of no other society can 
it be said with more truth that whatsoever sins it re- 
mits, they are remitted, and whatsoever sins it retains, 
they are retained.” Parents may have slaved a life 
long; they may have made the inculcation of morals 
a daily care; these new companions have been known 
only six days, but they are Public Opinion. 
The fact that the gang-spirit is born in play no doubt 
explains its fascination. As Jean Paul says, “ The first 
social fetters are woven of flowers.” / 
The code of the boys’ gang has the same fundamental 
element as that of the thieves’ gang — loyalty, Whether 
it has more than that depends upon ‘who is the leader. 
Now loyalty is a much overestimated virtue. It means 
little more than organized selfishness. As Miss Addams 
has pointed out, it relates itself to medievalism and is 
not near so fine a thing as companionship. Loyalty 
means to follow a leader, to protect each other, right or 
wrong, and often to prey upon outsiders. It means 
that in nations as well as in gangs. But-eompanion-

to which companionship, under enlightened direction, 
may carry a group of boys. An Early Risers’ Bible 
Class and a Student Volunteer Band are the incredible 
actualities found among groups of boys in the Young 
Men’s Christian Association, and even if they represent

  artificial standards and forced precocity, they seem to 
be genuinely pursued and enjoyed. 
The way the gang-ethics evolve is through the mob- 
spirit — that blind, conscienceless movement of men 
when in contact, which is seen in such extremes of 
manifestation as the French Revolution and the modern 
revival meeting. Its result is conduct with and for the 
tribe such as no boy would ever think of accomplishing 
when by himself, a sort. of least common denominator 
of the ethics of the constituent individuals. A group 
of boys is on its way to school. They pass beneath 
Farmer Snodgrass’ overhanging apple-trees. One boy 
has a stick in his hand, and as he carelessly throws it 
up into a tree it brings down an apple. “ I'll bet you 
can’t do that,” he remarks to his nearest companion. 
That lad, to make sure, tries it with a stone and suc- 
ceeds. Others grasp stones and make the same ex- 
periment. It is not long before all are up in the tree, 
pocketing and throwing down apples. No one of them 
wants any apples; all have just had breakfast, and 
there are apples in plenty at home, but the contagion 
of the group has carried them whither they would not. 
The boy who can resist such an influence, electric with 
enthusiasm and barbed by ridicule, either upon any one 
occasion or continuously, is either a natural-born 
leader of others or a misanthrope. 
: The dangers of the gang are at first 
nn sight more obvious than the opportu- 
— nities. Yet there are some things a boy 
learns through the gang which he can learn in no-other 
way. When I see.acity-boy.who wears gloves and has 
the high hand-shake, I wish fervently that the gang

  might get hold of him. The only place where a boy 
ean learn the brotherhood of man is in the school 
of the gang. Sometime in adolescence, probably be- 
tween fourteen and eighteen, most boys have what 
might be called an anti-domestic instinct. They 
would rather be anywhere else than at home. This 
truancy from the home is because the home, and par- 
ticularly the modern home of one or two children, is 
not a large enough social circle for the suddenly ex- 
panded heart of the boy. Out among his peers God 
intends that he shall go, to give and take, to mitigate 
his own selfishness and to gain the masculine standpoint 
which his mother, his nurse, and his school-teacher can- 
not give, and to exercise a new power, which is one of 
the most precious ever given to man, that of making 
friendships. 
The centripetal power of a gang is almost always 
represented in one person. If he be within the gang, 
as is usually the case, it is that virile lad who has 
constituted himself the chieftain. He is the key-boy 
of the group. If it be a person outside the gang, it is 
the adult whom the group has agreed to make its hero. 
For the thing that is at the bottom 
of the most lawless gang is a good 
thing. It is hero-worship, and hero-worship is, of 
course, a form of idealism. Some one has said that 
boys always idealize in biography. They don’t crave 
to be chaste, honest, religious, and no boy likes to be 
_ called “‘ a good boy,” but they are quite willing to be 
“like ‘strong men who may perhaps have all these quali- 
ties. For it is strength that makes a man a boy’s hero. 
He likes the dime novel, because men there are fierce

  and forceful. He would much rather shake hands with 
Jim Jeffries than with G. Campbell Morgan. On the 
walls of his room the portraits of Theodore Roosevelt 
and the latest prize-ring champion face you side by 
side, because each in his way is strong. So of his con- 
temporaries. It is not the godly deacon to whom he 
dofis his cap, but the brawny, profane blacksmith, the 
adventurous blackleg, the tramp with a story, who 
really win his admiration. It may partly be the fas- 
cination of meeting men who are still in the feral state 
that helps account for the strange associates whom 
he craves. And so the gang leader is the strongest boy, 
and the gang wants to do strenuous things and the 
gang’s ideals are physical and brutal. 
Yet, strangely enough, sympathy is a quality which 
also wins a boy or a gang of boys. The tramp is a 
hail-fellow-well-met. The seducer of boys is senti- 
mental with them. And the reason why women some- 
times get into the confidence of the gang, and even 
become gang leaders, is because they sometimes try to 
know how a boy feels. A boy loves, in his hours of 
gloom,.to.share with some 1¢ understanding “heart that 
self-pity which is one eof humanity's s moody luxuries, or 
to tell over, in hours of gladness, the garrulous annals 
of a day of joy. And we all know what a word of 
encouragement has often meant to a boy. 
“Your son Tom seems to have gotten over being 
round-shouldered... Every time ie seen him lately 
he’s been standing up like a man.’ |

“T said to him, one day, ‘Tom, what a magnificent

It is an interesting question as to whether it is the 
duty of adults to encourage or to ignore this gang 
instinct. Social workers are divided in opinion. Some 
woo boys by trying to turn street gangs into house 
clubs, and discipline them, when they become ob- 
streperous, by turning them all out and then readmit- 
ting all but the ringleader. Others put boys of the 
same gang into different clubs and never allow a boy 
to remain with the same group a second winter. 
As for myself, I have always stood for 
the. gang. I have found in church 
work that, no matter how carefully one 
tries to reach boys individually, the results he gets are 
gang.results. Strong-willed boys lead the gang even 
into religious confession. Weak-willed boys follow, 
and their own decisions are confirmed by the’ action of 
the group. I have seen a gang reverse its ways under 
tactful guidance. I remember once having a group of 
street lads associated with me in an organization of 
boy knighthood in a church, who hecame leaders in 
getting up a fair on the parsonage grounds. Some of 
their schoolmates, passing by, began to throw stones 
over upon the tents. Instantly their war-cry rang out, 
“ Knights of King Arthur to the réstue!”’ and the 
whole grotip, which a few weeks before would have 
heartily engaged in the same act of mischief, sallied 
out, with equal heartiness, to chastise the marauders, 
In the home, at any rate, I think our best part is to 
use the gang for all it is worth, to chaperon it unob- 
trusively, to win its gratitude by suggesting fun when

  its own resources give out, and to try to enter into its 
activities with something more than a spirit of resigna- 
tion. I said “ the gang,” but I ought to have said 
the gangs, for the peculiarity of brothers is that they 
never play together when they can play with an out- 
sider, and they never belong to the same gang. The 
vaccine of maternal sympathy generally makes the 
gang instinct harmless, for it is to be noticed that 
the worst boy, if he is a visitor and is watched, be- 
comes bland and plastic and even almost pious. 
The boy I pity is the boy who is the outsider, poor 
little old man, who has not been admitted into any of 
the mystic fraternities of the playground, and whose 
resource has to be books and botanizing and playing 
with girls or little boys! I don’t know whether he 
misses as much as he seems to, or is as lonely as he 
looks, but while I have a fancy that he usually grows 
up to be very rich or very good, I also feel that he is 
always an exile from paradise. 
Rs This is also a time of moral activity

‘ — depth, is being added.” ‘Character in

capitalized hope. He may become morbidly conscien- 
tious or painfully exercised with the search for absolute 
truth. Those very emotions which lead to bullying - 
and showing off are capable of being diverted into 
courage and chivalry. This is the age of hero-worship. 
On conversion at this age many are eager to exercise

  their social consciousness and emulate their heroes by 
becoming ministers.or missio! ies or slum workers or 
men of.achievement. Boy-ideals are always immediate. 
Like a vine, they must twine around some standard. 
As Prof. H. M. Burr says, “‘ If the boy’s ideal of man- 
hood is Fitzsimmons, he immediately sets about punch- 
ing some other boy’s head. If he thinks the life of an 
Indian the ideal, he straightway takes to the woods or 
whoops it up in the alley, as the case may be.” For 
this reason the wise boys’ club leader who proposes an 
attractive new plan will take heed always to carry it 
into effect at the very next meeting. The encourage- 
ment and direction of these ideals into orderly and 
definite channels is a matter of infinite importance. 
But the peculiarity of this period that most attracts 
attention is that of crisis. It seems to be well proven 
that there comes a time in the adolescence of almost 
every boy and girl when the various physical and 
moral influences of the life bear down to a point of 
depression, and then rise suddenly in ‘an ascending 
curve, carrying with them a new life. There is first-a 
lull, then a storm, then peace; what results is not-boy, 
but man. This crisis, in religious matters, is called 
conversion, but is by no means-confined to or peculiar 
to religious change. “‘ It is,’”’ says Dr. Hall, “ a natural 
regeneration.” If the Hughlings-Jackson three-level 
theory of the brain be true, there is at this time a final 
and complete transfer of the central powers of the 
brain from the lower levels of instinct and motor power 
to the higher levels. ‘It is,” says Lancaster, “ the 
focal point of all psychology.” Dr. Starbuck’s careful 
though diffusive study shows that this change is apt 
27 
 
-P-A-G-E-28
    a B O.X POR O'R EE M 
  to come in a great wave at about fifteen or sixteen, 
preceded by a lesser wave at about twelve, and followed 
by another at about seventeen or eighteen. It con- 
sists in a coming out from the little, dependent, irre- 
sponsible animal self into the larger, independent, 
responsible, outreaching and upreaching moral life 
of manhood. Professor Coe says: “I do not think it 
should be called conversion, but commitment. It is a 
ratification rather than a reversal.’”’ He also shows 
that the first wave is that of most decided religious 
impressibility and of spontaneous spiritual awakening, 
although the number of conversions that can be dated 
is greater in the second period. 
There is a marked difference in the way this “ per- 
sonalizing of religion,” as Coe calls it, comes to boys 
and to girls. With boys it is a later, a more violent, 
and a more sudden incident. With boys it is more apt 
to be associated with periods of doubt; with girls with 
times of storm and stress. It seems to be more apt to 
come to boys when alone; to girls in a church service. 
Next to the physical birth-hour this hour of psychical 
birth is most critical. For “ at this formative stage ” 
—TI quote from the Committee on Secondary Educa- 
tion — “ an active fermentation occurs that may give 
wine or vinegar.” “ This,” says President Hall, “ is 
the day of grace that must not be sinned away.” 
The period of adolescence is by many divided into 
‘three stages, embracing respectively the ages from 
twelve to sixteen, sixteen to eighteen, and eighteen to, 
“srentpiair These might be termed the stages of 
Tamer, crisis and reconstruction. Mr. E. P. St. John 
“classifies them as Physical, “emotional and intellectual

SOCIAL DEVEL OPMENT 
  stages. Coe marks them as impulsive, sentimental, and 
reflective. Rev. Charles E. McKinley marks them in 
character as solitary, self-willed, and social, and in 
result as discovering personal freedom, discovering 
life, discovering social relations. The three waves of 
religious interest correspond with these stages. I have 
not attempted to classify the phenomena of these stages 
here, desiring rather to give the impression of the 
period as a whole. Most of the phenomena which I 
have spoken of begin in the earliest stage, reach their 
culmination in the second, and begin in the third to 
form the fabric of altruism and character. Of course 
the instinctive, the sensuous, and the sentimental are 
apt to precede the rational and the deliberative. 
While we may not pretend to comprehend the whole 
philosophy of the entrance into the religious life, there 
are some things which seem to be assured. Such are 
these: The boy is not irreligious; he is rather in the 
lower stages of the religious life, the imitative, habitu- 
ated, ethical stages. Conversion is the human act of 
turning to God, not a special cataclysmal kind of ex- 
perience during that act. Mr. E. M. Robinson has put 
the various ways in which boys seem to enter the 
religious life in a homely but vivid statement: 
“ Boys enter the religious life in at least as many 
ways as they enter the water for swimming: (a) Some. 
lunge in — a definite decision which settles once for 
all what their attitude toward right and wrong shall 
be, what their relation to their God shall be. (6) Some 
_wade in — deliberately, cautiously, step by step, each 
step 2p revealing that another step is desirable. (c) Some 
run in a little way and then come out again, but con- Fe og on atl

THE BOY PROBLEM 
  tinue to run in a little farther each time, till at last 
they swim off —a number of changes of mind./ (d) 
Some are forced in. They may, finding themselves in, 
decide to remain, or they may make frantic struggles 
to get out. (e) Somesit down on the beach and simply 
let the-tide.come up about them, till it floats them off — 
by not resisting the tide about them they practically 
accept the situation. A boy enters the religious life 
by deliberate, comprehensive decision, by an accumu- 
lation of little decisions, by non-resistance to influence 
about him, which is a decision. In all cases, by his 
own choice accepting, or ‘ decision.’ ”’ 
These differences seem to be temperamental, where 
they are not partly artificial. The kind of crisis will 
be of the kind that is sought for. In one church the 
child is taught to believe that he is by the covenant 
a child of God. At adolescence the confirmation class 
awaits him and his crisis is likely to be one of forming 
fresh ideals only. In another communion boys are 
told that they are children of the world and the flesh, 
if not of the devil, and they expect, strive after, and 
very often attain a very sharp crisis of definite religious 
purpose. 
Nature seems to point to a proper time in the devel- 
opment of a boy when the psychical crisis should be 
expected and encouraged. If it be hastened, John 
Stuart Mill’s well-known simile applies, that such chil- 
dren are like too early risers, conceited all the forenoon 
of life and stupid all the afternoon and evening. If it 
be delayed, conversion is apt to be aridly intellectual: 
and to miss that emotional glow which is the beautiful 
birthright of the soul.

  We are evidently approaching the 
The End End of the Plastic Period. The instincts of the 3 : Plastic Period have all been given. The habits are 
pretty well formed. There is plenty of 
time to grow, but not much to begin. The character of 
most boys is fairly determined before they. enter col- 
_Jege. Now the father looks one day into the eyes of 
what he thought was his little boy and sees looking out 
the unaccustomed and free spirit of a young and un- 
conquerable personality. Some mad parents take this 
time to begin that charming task of “ breaking the 
child’s will,” which is usually set about with the same 
energy and implements as the beating of carpets. But 
the boy is now too big either to be whipped or to be 
mentally or morally coerced. 
We hesitate whether to be more afraid of or alarmed 
for this creature who has become endowed with the 
passions and independence of manhood while still a 
child in foresight and judgment. He rushes now into 
so many crazy plans and harmful deeds. Swift states 
that a period of semi-criminality is normal for all boys 
who are healthy. Hall calls it an age of temporary 
insanity. This age, particularly that from twelve to 
sixteen, is by all odds the most critical and difficult to 
deal with in all childhood. It is especially so because 
the boy now becomes secretive; he neither can nor will 
utter himself, and the very sensitiveness, longing and 
overpowering sense of the new life of which I have 
spoken is often so concealed by inconsistent and even 
barbarous behavior that one quite loses both compre- 
hension and patience. These are the fellows who, 
though absent, sustain the maternal prayer-meetings. 
31
-P-A-G-E-32
    THE Bi Ory PROBLEM 
  The apparent self-sufficiency of the boy at this 
period causes the parent to discontinue many means 
of amusement'\and tokens of affection which were 
retained until now. The twelve-month-old infant is 
submerged in toys, but the twelve-year-old boy has 
nothing at home to play with. The infant is caressed till 
he is pulplike and breathless, but the lad, who is hungry 
for love and understanding, is held at arms’ length. This 
is the time when most parents are found wanting. And 
in this broad generalization I do not forget what Madon- 
nas have learned in the secret of their hearts and from 
the worship of the Child, nor what wise Josephs who 
have dreamed with angels have been patient to discover. 
Love and waiting must now have their perfect work. 
Cures by the laying on of hands are to be discouraged. 
The father, whose earlier task was to be a perfect law- 
giver, must now become hero and apostle. It is a 
comfort to know that this era will pass swiftly away 
and that the child will suddenly awake from many of 
his vagaries and forget his dreams. ‘There is a certain 
preservative salt of humor, common to boyhood, and 
demanded of parenthood during this trying era, by 
means of which children often grow up much better 
than their parents can bring them up. 
Our last glimpse of this conservatory 
ot of young life shows us the habits 
ee fullgrown and the instincts budding suc- 
tia cessively into fresh ones. These bud- 
dings or “‘ nascencies’’ I will refer to again. Here is a 
heap of knowledge, much of it undigested, and some of 
it false. Here, too, if he has passed the crisis I spoke

borrowed faith. It is new, it is little, but it is his own, 
and it is growing. But here is something strange. 
Strong, vigorous, fearful at first, and afterward danger- 
ous looking, here is a plant that has suddenly taken 
root and grown bigger than all. Itis the Will. That is 
what all this storm and stress mean. This is what is 
born in the emergence from the dependent to the in- 
dependent being. Shall we pull it up and throw it 
away? What! and leave him a weakling child through 
life? Shall we bind it down? What! and maim him 
forever? Let it grow, but let_it_ grow properly. This...

octal pedagogy in dealing with a being who is now 
coming to have a social nature pays its first and chief 
attention to will-training. For there is no more im- 
portant, more neglected subject. It is an art,,as one 
tersely says, “which has no text-book, and of which it 
is impossible to write one.” 
The public school fails in will-training because 
it gives the will no exercise. ‘‘Our schools,” says 
William I. Crane, “permit us' to think what is good 
but not to do what is good.”’ The home, especially the 
city home, tails for the same reason. The child’s at- 
tention has been shared by a thousand sights, nothing 
holds him long, and he cannot find ways to use his in- 
33

  stincts actively. The Church fails because it has tried 
the wrong thing; it has taught the children to examine 
their spiritual interiors and to sing, ‘“‘ Draw me nearer 
till my will is lost in thine,” and not to hallow their 
wills, as Phillips Brooks wisely said, “ by filling them 
with more and more life, by making them so wise that 
they shall spend their strength in goodness.” 
General Francis A. Walker was the first to show just 
what the country did for the boy. He used the simple 
illustration of the squirrel seen on the way from school, 
the trap designed and built for his capture, and the 
successful result. There was a single keen interest, a 
natural instinct awakened, that instinct exercised by a 
voluntary muscular effort carrying an originative task 
to completion: result, not merely a captured squirrel, 
but strengthened will power. Says Horne: “ Catch the 
instinct in the act and direct it toward a legitimate 
object. To do so skilfully is actually to fashion the 
good will.” 
With this hint social pedagogy goes to work. “You 
can only get a purchase on another’s will,” James says, 
“ by touching his actual or potential self.” Hall says, 
“Will is only a form of interest.”” We trained the 
boy’s conscience, his passive self, by filling his mind 
with rules, but we can train his will, his active self, 
only by interesting and making active his instincts. 
Lancaster says, “ The pedagogy of adolescence may be 
summed up in one sentence, Inspire enthusiastic ac- 
tivity.” I spoke of the “ nascencies” of instinct. 
Every little while an instinct pops up in a boy’s mind 
and feebly feels for utterance. If it is not noticed it 
sinks back again te rest, or it becomes perverted. All

SO CTAL DEV £0 PME NS   
boys have the constructing instinct. If it is neglected 
it either fades away or becomes the destructive instinct. 
Some wise man sets the boy to whittling or modeling, 
and the instinct becomes an ardent interest. Such 
happy alertness, thinks Mosso, was the encouragement 
that made a Raphael and a Da Vinci. It will satisfy us 
if it gives our boys the good instead of the evil will. 
It is also a curious fact that a multiplicity of inter- 
ests just at this time multiplies rather than diminishes 
the power of acquisition. Thus social pedagogy may 
use many instrumentalities to encourage the interested 
and self-directed activities of boys in maturing their 
wills into principle and character. 
In speaking of will in its relation to 
moral character, the important thing 
to say seems to be that every boy by the time he has 
begun to be a man needs more than anything else in 
some way to have gotten the habit of having a first- 
hand relation to righteousness. ‘ The moral man,” as 
John W. Carr says, “ obeys himself.” 
I have been saying that boys are 
divided into two grades, the “ you- 
must ” boys and the “ I-must ” boys. 
The former grade is of those to whom these two words 
“ you must ” need to be instantly reiterated by others 
— parents, teachers, employers, older counselors. The 
“T-must ” boy is the one whose own conscience has 
seized the scepter of authority; who no longer needs to 
be governed by outside consciences or to be held up 
by props. Jesus used this very phrase when, after a 
typical boyish experience, he spoke this resolve in the 
temple: “7 must be about my Father’s business.”

    THE BOW PROBLEM 
  
I appreciate the value of parental training, I realize 
how important a part of his moral education is the 
molding of a boy by his peers, I know how the emo- 
tional quickening of a “‘ conversion ”’ is sometimes the 
gentle shock that seems the one thing needed to launch 
the young soul on the ways. But this I know, that, as 
the old Yankee once expressed it, “ This is a world 
that has got to be now and then fit!” and, after all, 
nobody can fight a boy’s battles but the boy himself, 
with God as his helper. 
The great problem of bringing up a boy is not to 
make him a good boy only while he is a boy and when 
he is at home, but so to nurture him that when he is a 
man, and wherever he may be, he will be 3 man of self- 
determining goodness. I do not know how we can be 
sure of such a tremendous result. We are not always 
sure we have attained it ourselves. But I am per- 
suaded that it is to be accomplished by keeping the 
boy’s religion from ingrowing, by bringing him gently 
and constantly and firmly into opportunities for real 
goodness as fast as he is capable of them, by awakening 
him, as soon as he can answer, in the realm of idealism, 
and most of all by teaching him that old-fashioned 
thing, which has almost become a cant word,— piety, — 
which is simply the filial relation to God. 
In the shaping of a boy’s ideals nothing is more en- 
couraging than the extraordinary degree to which we 
usually have the boy on our side. 
There is nothing he wants to be any 
more than the very thing we want him 
to be, namely, a man. The curious 
way in which children reach up to an age beyond their

own is very noticeable. It is equally characteristic in 
their play, when they usually imitate “ grown-ups.” 
Children have always been thus since the days when 
Jesus described the children of his time playing at 
marrying and funerals. I am very fond of this story: 
A boy walking along the shore of Massasoit Pond in 
Springfield one morning was met by a man who was 
instantly impressed by his bright, open face, and who 
stopped and engaged him in conversation. He asked 
him where he lived, who his father was, where he went 
to school, what he was going to be when he became a 
man, and then, becoming better pleased, finally asked 
him how old he was. He was surprised to find 
that the boy for the first time hung his head down and 
hesitated to give an answer. He repeated the question 
and the boy finally raised his head and blurted out, 
“ Well, I ain’t but twelve, but my pants are marked 
sixteen.” There you have it, right in a nutshell. You 
are to measure a boy not by the number of his years, 
but by the girth of his trousers, by the circumference 
of his ambitions. v 
Much of the lurid language, cigarette smoking, and 
general bravado and braggadocio of a boy is to be in- 
terpreted as simply a crude reaching up toward manli- 
ness, and all the time underneath there is the pure and 
tender heart of a little child. The energies of a boy 
are friendly energies and, in a general way, while he is 
busy he is good. 
One thing that makes it hard for us to realize this 
is that during these anti-domestic years I have spoken 
of, when the boy first goes out to explore his world, 
there comes over him a sense of alienation, not only 
37

THE BOY PROBLEM 
  from his own outgrown childhood, but also from those 
he knows and loves. My friend, Mr. Charles E. Mc- 
Kinley, has made the happy suggestion that it is a 
rehearsal of the parable of The Prodigal Son, through 
which even the best of men, including Jesus, must pass, 
and that “ the far country ” is the inevitable and not 
always miserable condition through which all youth 
must walk to a real heritage in the Father’s House. 
During this time the lad meets his first disillusionment 
about men or things, and closes behind himself the 
implacable gates of Eden; he enlarges and alters the 
code of honor which he learned in Egyptian servitude 
to his gang; he relates himself in some degree to the 
world and his mission in it, and finds out what belongs 
to him, and he makes the final transition from a de- 
pendent to an independent soul life, from the Old 
Testament to the New Testament of his being. 
In these years there are single events and days that 
are magical. Happy is the parent who may be the 
ministrant by whose aid the person or circumstance 
comes to his child which awakens his soul or his am- 
bition, which opens the gates of vision, or which gives 
the Aladdin’s lamp which makes happiness forever 
after a possibility! 
The intellectual side of the religious nature is the last 
awakened. The doubt-period comes very late in boy- 
hood. Its seriousness depends upon the character of 
early instruction. If the teaching of the Bible in the 
home has communicated nothing that must be un- 
learned, and has left little opportunity for intellectual 
strains, the man will mike his mature theologies with- 
out mental anguish. *

    All this, the deepest and most thorough evolution of 
life, takes time. If religion in the child be, as Dr. 
Stanley Hall has said, “a growth, not a conquest,” 
it must come on very slowly, and our nervous, well- 
meant eagerness for “ results,’”’ with the accompanying 
temptation to the child to regard himself and his ex- 
periences as interesting, is misplaced and mischievous. 
We cannot be too anxious to give our children early 
Christian nurture, and we cannot make up for neglect 
to do that by frantic special efforts at the close of the 
plastic period. 
The results of this chapter suggest that the last 
nascencies of the instincts, the completion of the habits, 
the psychical crisis and the infancy of the will, all 
coincident with the birth of the social nature, together 
form a period of danger and possibility in boy life. 
For helping this age the cooperative wisdom and aid 
of all friends of boys and girls is earnestly to be desired.

SrarsBuck, speaking of religious training, says, ‘One 
can scarcely think of a single pedagogical maxim 
which, if followed in all cases, might not violate the 
deepest needs of the person whom it is our purpose 
to help.” This is true of all training. The parent, 
teacher or social worker who should try to bring up 
a boy or a group of boys by means of the digest of 
information in the last chapter would find that in real 
life, as in Latin grammar, there are more exceptions 
than rules. 
Some children will very closely follow the diagram 
of growth which I have suggested; most children will 
accommodate themselves to it in a general way, vary- 
ing dates, order and distinctness of detail; while a few 
will seem to defy all laws in their development. 
I feel it necessary to interrupt the logie by which 
(having shown the nature and needs of adolescence) I 
proceed to suggest the ways by which those needs are 
being and should be supplied, in order to relate some 
of the by-laws to the constitution of boy life and im- 
press the necessity of knowing the lads who are to be 
helped in their individualities. 
, Physicians have systems of filling out and filing the 
life-history, diagnosis and history of the case of each 
~~ of their patients. I think it would help every worker 
with boys to devise a system of blanks for securing the

facts suggested in this chapter about each of his boys. 
In every Sunday-school class, in every boy’s club, in 
every home there is a boy who has some peculiarity 
the knowledge of which is essential to wisdom in caring 
for him. 
In every group of boys we notice in- 
stances of Delay or Precocity in develop- 
ment. This may be hereditary, tem- 
peramental, or accidental. This boy comes of a slow, 
stolid, substantial stock and matures slowly. Here is 
one of a tropical temperament who is precocious. 
Sickness, lack of nutrition or care, an accident, a 
sorrow, may have kept that one back. One needs to 
know these home conditions and the life-history in 
order to know the boy. One may entirely lose power 
with a boy by being too quick or too slow for him. 
There is a well-known “ clumsy age ”’ between fourteen 
and sixteen, when the skill of the hand becomes sta- 
tionary or retrogrades while the power of appreciation 
of the fine and true grows on. This is caused by the 
fact that the bones are growing faster than the muscles 
in that short period of stupendous physical increment. 
A similar period of deterioration in the pleasure in, and 
the quality of, the drawings of children, beginning with 
_the tenth or twelfth year, is noted by Chamberlain, 
which he explains by the fact that the child awakes to 
the true appreciation of his work as “ nothing more 
than a poor, weak imitation of nature, and the charm 
of creative art vanishes with the disappearance of the 
former naive faith in it.” This coming down out of the 
realm of childish imagination unto the level of seeing 
things as they are, coupled with new desires after the

ideal, which are limited in execution by manual clumsi- 
ness, helps to explain some of the moodiness and gloom 
of the period. 
The influence of Temperament on the 
ae: phenomena of development is not to be 
“neglected. Although Lotze has made an ingenious and 
often observable parallel between the sanguine tem- 
perament and childhood and the sentimental and adol- 
escence, the diversities of temperamental nature which 
are to be permanent are by middle adolescence pretty 
well established. The readiness but triviality of the 
sanguine, the cheerful conceit of the sentimental, the 
prompt, intense response of the choleric and the rumina- 
tive nature of the phlegmatic temperaments are each 
noticeable in individual boys. The “ child types” 
which have been classified are only differences and 
combinations of temperaments. Lesshaft recognizes 
six among children entering school: the hypocritical, 
the ambitious, the quiet, the effeminate-stupid, the 
bad-stupid, the depressed. Siegert names fifteen: 
melancholy, angel-or-devil, star-gazer, scatterbrain, 
apathetic, misanthropic, doubter and seeker, honorable, 
critical, eccentric, stupid, buffoonly-naive, with feeble 
memory, studious, and blasé. These characteristics, 
with their special relations to,the sensibilities, intellect 
and will, are to be noted and used as diagnoses for 
individual treatment. 
Racial Differences are quite marked 
in regions where there are many boys 
of foreign birth, and they largely de- 
termine the special methods of social work with them.»

two thousand boys under continual observation in the 
Fall River Boys’ Club, for his impressions of two 
classes of foreigners, —the French Canadians and the 
Hebrews. ‘The French Canadians are behind our 
American-born boys. I am pretty sure that they 
comprise almost every illiterate boy in Fall River. 
They are behind the other boys in playing games. They 
need educating in play and in trustworthiness. They 
lack the honor sense. I don’t see how I could put 
them upon their honor as we do other boys — they 
would hardly know what I meant. They do well under 
the care of an Americanized boy. Probably they will 
become better citizens in another generation or two. 
. The older Jewish boys are clannish. They like 
to meet, exercise, bathe, etc., with their own race. 
Their religious scruples as to food should be respected. 
The Jews read more than other boys. The Irish 
stick together in the election of officers for the various 
societies. They do not seem capable-of-rising-out..of. 
their inborn prejudice of the English. The Jew is the 
only one of the lot who w will th thank you for.a.good turn.” 
Mr. George W. “Morgan of of the Hebrew Educational 
Alliance of New York has contrasted the Irish with the 
Hebrew boy, and made some acute observations of 
the latter: 
“ One of the most striking traits of the Jewish char- 
acter is its intensity. Look at the intellectual side, and 
you immediately say that the Jew is developed men- 
tally at the expense of the complementary sides of his 
nature. It is said of the Irishman that if he cannot 
easily pick a quarrel, he begins to step on his neigh- 
bor’s toes as he spits on his own hands and prepares for 
43
-P-A-G-E-44
  
  THE BOY PROBL EM   
a clinch. With perhaps more truth might it be said of a 
Jewish boy that if he cannot agree with his companion 
on some subject, he begins a volley of pointed querying 
to establish by what claim of reasoning his companion 
can possibly agree with him. He is a most accomplished 
mental gymnast. Fix your attention on his emotional 
nature, and if you know him you will decide that the 
strength of his passions is his distinguishing trait. 
His nerves are tuned to a high pitch and readily re- 
sponsive to the sympathetic touch. Strike a dis- 
cordant note, and his frame vibrates with suppressed 
antithetic emotions. The gamut is run with surprising 
alacrity. With his will you deal with the inflexible. 
His plans once formed, he will plod the years as days, 
cope with difficulties if surmountable, and if otherwise 
bide his time until conditions change. He may all 
along be chafing with impatience, but the callous 
comes, and on he goes. There is, however, a limit to 
this intensity. The friction from such velocity wears 
upon the machine. The Jew is physically the inferior 
of his Gentile brother. He travels faster, but often 
falls before the race seems run. We see, therefore, that 
the Jew is an extremist.” 
; Ethical Dualism, a trait of semi- 
Eiel development and vith which we Daglisia pment and one with which w 
are familiar among American negroes, is 
characteristic of immaturity. It is the trait of the 
person who has not yet accepted the responsibility for 
his own life. None of us entirely shake it off. Not 
only is the Sunday boy different from the Monday boy, 
the boy praying different from the boy playing, the boy 
alone or with his parents or his adult friend different

  from the boy with his comrades, but, as in savagery, 
the ethics of the boy with his ‘ gang ” is different from: 
that with other boys. It is the old clan ethics. This 
idea that loyalty is due only to one’s own tribe, and 
that other people are enemies, and other people’s prop- 
erty is legitimate prey, is just the spirit which makes 
the “ gang’ dangerous, and which suggests the need 
of teaching a universal sociality, and of transforming 
the clan allegiance into a chivalry toward all. The 
clan is a step higher than individualism; I would recog- 
nize it, but I would lead its members to be knights 
rather than banditti. ‘The age which the boy has 
reached,” says Joseph Lee, ‘ is that where Sir Launce- 
lot, the knight-errant, the hero of single combat, is 
developing into Arthur, the loyal king.” 
Another trait of adolescence is the 
Survival of Immaturities. These are 
not immediately cut off. Illness, nerve 
fatigue, unknown causes, may bring them back. The 
emotional era is often babyish. A later survival is the 
craze for the lodge in early manhood, which seems to 
result from the fact that the adolescent love of chivalry 
and parade has not previously been satisfied. 
Adolescence not only gives “ rever- 
berations ” of the past; it prophesies 
_its future. This comparatively unnoticed fact must 
modify many of our conclusions and much of our 
practise. It is easy to overemphasize the fact that 
the child is a savage. He is also a seer. As in Joel, 
our ‘‘ young men see visions” and ‘“ upon the hand- 
maidens is poured out the Spirit.” Chamberlain calls 
the child “ the general genius,” and shows that if we

  knew better the art of developing the individual we 
should not during the process of maturing destroy the 
promise of youth. This is to be done, in general, by 
keeping in advance of the child and giving him some- 
thing to reach up to without making him unchildlike. 
He knows hy prophetic instinct much that he has not 
experienced, and he reads as well as feels. We can give 
him some information which shall seem like empty 
rooms, but he will soon hasten on and, if the informa- 
tion be vital truth, populate these vacant formularies 
and make that which was first habit volitional. This 
explains why some religious instruction which was not 
based on child-study has produced pretty good results, 
while some other with good enough theories has failed. 
The latter was not nourishing enough. As an illustra- 
tion of what I mean, let me instance the place of art 
in a cchild’s life. The psychologist who remembers only 
the fact that children reverberate may say: Give the 
child only large outlines and crude colors. But he who 
remembers that the child is also a prophet says: Do 
this if you will, but give the boy also the Sistine Ma- 
donna and her Child. It may correct the grotesqueness 
of his imperfect imagination now, and either a certain 
Messianic prophecy in his soul will reveal its beauty, 
or else, having been habituated to it in childhood, it 
will hang cherished forever on the walls of memory 
when he can fully understand. Appeal to your own 
memory of home pictures and tell me if this is not wise. 
Another curious fact about maturing 
life is that it comes on in waves. Be- 
tween these are Lulls. These lulls were called to my 
attention by some heads of reformatories before I read 
46 Lulls

  about them. Those who have seen Starbuck’s charts 
of the period of conversion are familiar with the triple 
rise and fall of that age. But there are other charts 
upon which this rhythmic development is manifest. 
This boy grows nine inches in stature this year and 
next year he increases not at all. That boy led his 
class last year; this year he is leading the other end of 
it. Yonder lad came to “the necktie stage” a few 
months ago; now he has forsworn society. Another 
was hopefully converted recently, but now has back- 
slidden and fears he has sinned the unpardonable sin 
against the Holy Spirit. What is the explanation? 
If you chart out all these rhythms, physical, mental, 
social, and moral, you will find that they closely corre- 
spond. Their explanation is largely physical. When 
physical growth and energy are near their flood-tide 
the other friendly energies respond likewise, but during 
these reaction times which the good God gives so that 
the child’s body may gather power to grow again, all 
the other energies hibernate. This law of rhythms 
probably acts to a lesser degree all through life. It is 
not confined to adolescence. Middle-aged people have 
testified to having regular fluctuations of religious in- 
terest once in two years; others, during successive 
winters. Some of these cases are explainable, some are 
obscure. The tendency of nervous energy to expend 
and then recuperate itself; the fact of a yearly rhythm 
in growth, greatest in the autumn and least from April 
to July, pointed out by Malling-Hansen; the influence of 
winter quiet and leisure upon religious feeling, — these 
are suggestive. In boyhood it is probable that the first 
lull is a reaction from the shock of the pubertal change, 
47  
-P-A-G-E-48
BiOw, PROBLEM 
    the second a reaction from the year of greatest physical 
growth, and the third a reaction from the year of doubt 
and re-creation. The boy, then, who suddenly loses his 
interest in religion or work or ideals is not to be thought 
in a desperate condition, and somebody ought to tell 
him that he is not. There is nothing to do but wait 
for this condition, which is natural and helpful to over- 
wrought energies, to pass, as it surely will. 
Something has been said about the 
importance of recognizing and following 
the leadings of the natural interests or the Instincts of 
boys, in trying to help them. This must always be 
done, but it must not be overdone. When social inter- 
course begins, natural instincts begin to be perverted. 
It is the best and not the worst manifestation of his 
means of guidance which is to be followed. One must 
distinguish between instincts and whims. Fickleness 
is so noticeable a trait of boys that no parent or friend 
of boys can ever afford to decide a new proposal from 2 
boy till he has given him time to make a still newer one. 
The time and place of assembly, the rules and restric- 
tions of membership and the development of the plans 
of an organization for boys, if left to the boys them- 
selves, soon become entirely unsatisfactory to all - 
concerned. 
All that I have said shows the care that must be - 
taken not to misinterpret boyhood. Things do not 
always mean what they seem to or even what the 
psychologists suggest. I spoke of the curious articles 
found in a boy’s pocket as evidences of a sort of fetich- 
ism. They may be nothing of the sort; they may be 
simply the evidences of an elementary esthetic taste.

  It takes time and many revisings of one’s opinion to 
arrive at the point where one discovers that what a 
boy says is seldom all he means, and that what he does 
is but a slight indication of what he is. 
The by-laws of life which I have named are largely 
those which accompany childhood in which there is a 
real progression. We must now mention those excep- 
tions, common enough to necessitate knowledge of 
them, where the life becomes stationary or makes 
retrogression. These are the stages of atavism, delin- 
quency and defectiveness, degeneracy and idiocy. 
Atavism is not clearly distinguished 
from heredity. Indeed, Virchow de- 
fined it as “ discontinuous heredity.” It is not in 
itself a step toward degeneracy. Probably we are all 
atavistic when asleep or fatigued or part of a crowd. 
The inheritance may be from a good rather than an 
evil ancestor, of sturdiness of body, genius of mind or 
purity of soul. Whatever it be, it is very apt to show 
itself during adolescence. Then it is that the child who 
has always been like its mother suddenly grows like its 
father in looks or character, or, becoming an entirely 
strange being, it is remembered or discovered that an 
ancestor two or three generations back had these qual- 
ities. A happy advantage may be taken of a favor- 
able atavism. If the atavism be in the direction of 
degeneration, now is the time for warning and guiding 
the child in his formative years. 
Adopting the biological theory of E. Ray Lankester 
as to the three conditions which may result from 
natural selection, Balance, Elaboration and Degenera- 
tion, Dr. George E. Dawson has made some suggestive 
49 Atavism
-P-A-G-E-50
THE BOY PROBLEM 
  studies of psychic arrests. Each of these arrests, 
which constitute the retrogressive stages of defective- 
ness or degeneracy, he explains as the persistence of 
lower appetites and instincts. Vagrancy and pauper- 
ism represent the persistence of the unproductive food- 
appetites of animals, children and savages; theft is the 
persistence of the predatory instinct; gluttony and 
drunkenness represent theindiscriminate food-appetites; 
unchastity is a defectiveness in sex-evolution; assault 
is a persistence of the preying instinct. These arrests, 
if temporary, are like the temporary stages of physical 
growth, and are transformed if surrounding conditions 
are healthful. If there is a total arrest of the elimina- 
tive process we have the results in the crimes and 
offenses of the delinquent classes. If these lower 
qualities are not only persistent, but become diseases, 
we have moral monsters. Regarding the last class he 
makes some most vigorous suggestions. But we are 
here concerned only with his advice as to the treatment 
of the second. He urges a recognition that the cause 
of a large proportion of immoral tendencies is an in- 
complete elimination of the sub-human traits. ‘‘ Edu- 
cation as a moral agency,” he says, “ must be chiefly 
serviceable during the periods of life that recapitulate 
the great groups of genetic instincts and habits. Such 
are the periods of childhood and adolescence.” 
The practical advice which he gives is most helpful 
to those who, in trying to help a number of boys or 
girls in social groups in community or church, are puz- 
zled or disheartened at the presence of one or more 
partly delinquent or immoral children. He counsels 
that we remember that these survivals cannot be ex- 
50
-P-A-G-E-51

tirpated in a moment. He urges the greatest caution 
as to tempting these children toward the evils to which 
they have tendencies, because if the functioning of 
these immoral survivals can be kept from occurring, 
the reduction of their power must inevitably follow. 
If, especially during adolescence, appeal is made to the 
emotions and the reason, the functions which had ret- 
rograded may be transformed and brought up to the 
level of those around them. Let bullying be changed 
into chivalry toward the weak, destructiveness into 
constructiveness, general obstreperousness into enthu- 
siastic activity. Johnson found that the use of play 
and crafts had an especially favorable enlightening and 
awakening effect upon defective youth. 
These are the lines of effort which have already been 
pressed as the proper means of training the wills of 
normal children. We thus learn that they are to be 
doubly emphasized in strengthening defective wills and 
stimulating arrested lives to new growth. 
The by-laws of boy life that have so far been men- 
tioned are variations in the boy’s own evolution. It 
remains to mention some that are the result of the 
surrounding conditions of his life. 
We have to-day a new kind of home. 
The pioneer home was the abiding-place 
of the whole family and a microcosm of the world. 
Father and mother were always present and always in 
active discharge of their varied functions. They were 
priests, teachers, industrial instructors, judges and 
executives of justice. To-day the father in the city, 
and to a considerable degree in the country, is absent 
all day from the home. Woman has been emancipated, 
51 The Home
-P-A-G-E-52
  BE Broa PROBLEM 
  and one of the things the mother is emancipated from 
is the house. The teaching, the industrial training, the 
discipline of faults and the moral and religious educa- 
tion of children have been turned over to the school, 
the state and the church. Clubs, lodges, flat-life, 
moving, the lack of neighbors and dooryards, divorce, 
— these are some of the disintegrating influences that 
are at work upon the home. The child has little 
loyalty to a place or to people, no opportunity to do 
any useful work, few social ties to his parents and little 
real attention from them. Rich or poor, he is really, 
as Professor Peabody has pointed out, too often the 
victim, in private boarding-school and orphanage alike, 
of a “ placing-out system.” 
Another condition that affects the 
child is the city. One third of our 
children to-day live in cities. Now the country is a 
panorama; the city is a kinetoscope. It is possible to 
exaggerate the moral advantages of life in a country 
town, but it is not possible to exaggerate the contrast 
in the effect on the physical and nervous life of a child 
between the real country and the real city. 
A third condition that affects children, especially in 
cities, is the influence of immigration. I am not affirm- 
ing er denying here that the immigrant child has virtues 
that the American child may well emulate. I am say- 
ing simply that the different ideals and practises of the 
foreign child are a potent influence on the character of 
the American child wherever the two come in contact. 
An altogether different modification 
of child growth is the presence of a very 
strong Personality with or near the child. Sometimes 
52 The City 
Personality

  it is a playmate who blesses or blasts for a time the 
lives of a group of boys. It is a matter of observation 
that every new boy introduced into a boys’ club alters 
the effectiveness of methods which have hitherto applied 
and sometimes makes a previously successful plan a 
failure. ‘‘ The King of Boyville ” is no fiction in many 
a community. Occasionally this personality is a 
woman. It may be a playmate of the same or often 
of greater age, who calls forth that first love whose 
sweetness is its unearthly and chivalric purity. It may 
be that rare monster, a female libertine. It is oftener 
a genial matron who is great-aunt and fairy godmother 
to a whole group. Sometimes this personality is that 
of a man who seems to exercise, voluntarily or invol- 
untarily, an almost hypnotic influence upon children. 
Happy the leader of boys who has that power and who 
can wisely use it! Warm-hearted and trustful, the 
lad is always easily seduced. His future depends more 
upon the first great friendship of his adolescence than 
upon any other one influence. 
Three other influences can be only 
mentioned and grouped together. They 
are the increase of lawlessness among 
rich and poor, the falling of the church behind the 
public school in its educational work, and the fact that, 
while the home has abdicated the moral instruction of 
children, the school has not in any orderly, serious or 
consecutive way taken it up. 
On the other hand, as some sort of balance to these 
last three portentous and alarming statements, we may 
gather what heart we may from three other condition- 
ing facts of recent origin,— the rise of child-study, the

  triumph of “the new education,” with its emphasis 
upon the child rather than upon the subject of study, 
and the recent national revival of righteousness. 
The impression which this chapter will leave is not 
one of encouragement to those who are about to enter 
on work with boys after taking a fifteen minutes’ course 
in pedagogy or in servile obedience to the limitations 
of some popular society for the moral improvement of 
the young. The matter of spiritual therapeutics de- 
mands powers of observation, collation and application 
of ararekind. It suggests a preparation for work with 
boys which is severe in its demands, but none too severe 
for labor with material so plastic and so sensitive to 
impression. This preparation may not be necessarily 
scholastic. To be a young man and thus to have re- 
cently been a boy, or to be the father or mother of 
boys, and to have common sense, insight and patience, 
— these are long steps on the way to mastery with 
boys. The peculiar dispositions and vagaries of boys 
are most of them the temporary stages through which 
they pass in the struggle toward maturity, and they 
suddenly disappear at the close of the pubertal epoch, 
but they are nevertheless true materials of character, 
and they must be studied and understood and used for 
their higher rather than their lower possibilities. Other 
things being equal, the best way to help a boy is to 
understand him.

play, new acquaintanceships begin to use the crevices 
of his time. First he plays at home with a chosen 
companion or two; then he ventures forth to the ball 
field and the swimming hole with a larger group; finally 
his journeys are farther, his stay is longer, the group 
is more thoroughly organized and a mob spirit is apt 
to arise which passes from unorganized play and 
sportive frolic to barbarous and destructive deviltry, 
and we have, in city and country, the fully developed 
« gang.” 
Accounts of the doings of these “ gangs,” from the 
comparative innocence of property destruction and 
hoodlumism to organized theft, assault and murder, 
appear in the daily press continually. Hardly less 
dangerous in tendency are many of the clubs which 
more quietly meet indoors. A recent report of the 
University Settlement of New York City calls attention 
to the candy stores as informal social centers which 
lead to the pool-room, the saloon, the cheap show and 
the clubroom, and to “ recreation clubs,” where, 
a younger member reports, “ they have kissing all

through pleasure time, and use slang language,’ and — 
the members are from fourteen to eighteen — “ they 
don’t behave nice between young ladies.” 
Ofttimes watchful parents can prevent the evolution 
of the social instinct from reaching the mob stage or 
the manifestation of lawlessness by redeeming and 
transforming these energies, but the fact that this is not 
everywhere being done — and this not among the poor 
entirely, either — gives room for new and vigorous 
forms of educative philanthropy. 
Convincing proofs that this early social instinct 
craves development as much as that of adult man, and 
suggestive indications of the ways in which it turns 
and may best be turned are seen in a study of those 
interesting organizations which boys themselves spon- 
taneously create. Dr. Henry D. Sheldon’s question- 
naire as to the spontaneous institutional activities of 
American children furnishes me my figures, but I have 
arranged them to bear simply upon the point we are 
considering, — adolescent boyhood. How general the 
expression of this social instinct is, is seen in the fact 
that of 1,034 responses of boys from ten to sixteen, 
851 were members of such societies. This did not in- 
clude societies formed for boys by elders, and it did 
include many boys who from isolation never had the 
slightest chance for such society making. 
The study of the societies which chil- 
The Interests dren spontaneously form ought to be of Child- q Societies more suggestive than that of those 
which elders in their adult wisdom or 
ignorance form for them. If will is only interest, 
interest should be the best criterion of how to help 
57

THE BOY PROBLEM 
the will. From 1,022 papers collected there were 
reported 862 societies. Sixty-four boys belonged to 
more than one society. The ages were ten to seven- 
teen. Of 623 societies, fully described: 
Those having secrets numbered 23, or 3} per cent. 
Social clubs (for “ good times ’’) numbered 28, or 
Industrial organizations numbered 56, or 84 per cent. 
Philanthropic associations numbered 10, or 14 per 
cent. 
Literary, art and musical clubs numbered 28, or 4} 
per cent. 
Predatory societies (migratory, building, hunting, 
fighting, preying) numbered 105, or 17 per cent. 
Athletic and game clubs numbered 379, or 61 per cent. 
The ages eleven, twelve and thirteen were the ages 
of the largest number of societies formed, the numbers 
being: at eight, 28; at nine, 44; at ten, 118; at eleven, 
155; at twelve, 164; at thirteen, 188; at fourteen, 90; 
at fifteen, 80; at sixteen, 34; at seventeen, 11. 
We need not treat these figures so seriously as to 
consider them everywhere infallible, but they certainly 
confirm the observations which we have made ourselves. 
We notice the following facts: 
1. The period of greatest activity of these societies 
is between ten and_ fifteen, over 87 per cent being 
formed during that period, only 7 per cent before ten 
and only 1 per cent being formed at seventeen. This 
is accounted for by the growth of the social disposition 
with adolescence and, in a lesser degree, by the fact 
that some of the earlier societies persisted later, and 
also because in later years the church and school

societies formed by elders take the place of many 
voluntary societies. 
2..Physical activity is the key-note of these societies 
at all ages. The predatory and athletic societies 
number 77 per cent. Add to these the industrial and 
we have 353 per cent of the whole. 
3. The literary, art and musical interests are very 
small, while the philanthropic and religious are in- 
finitesimal. 
4. The interest in athletic societies increases by 
leaps from eight to thirteen, and then diminishes with 
even greater rapidity toward the end, while the interest 
in literary societies, though never very large, grows with 
maturity. The predatory societies are at their highest 
at eleven, and thence gradually disappear. 
The boys’ societies are largely summer societies. 
Had the figures been so classified as to show this ac- 
curately we should perhaps find that the literary and 
philanthropic features do really have some importance 
in the months when outdoor activity is restrained. With 
this limitation recognized, we must still believethat phy- 
sical activity is the interest central throughout the year. 
5. Girls and boys do not naturally organize to- 
gether. Dr. Sheldon’s paper shows that the interests 
of.boys.and girls in their societies are nowhere parallel. 
Girls form three times as many secret societies as boys, 
five times as al societies, three times as many 
a] ‘industrial, twic twice as many ; philanthropic and three times 
__ss many literary, wi while ‘the boys form four times as 
many predatory and seven times as many athletic so- 
cieties as the girls. Physical activity was the feature 
in 10 per. cent i of the > girls’ as against 77 per « cent of the 
59      
 
-P-A-G-E-60
  THE BOY PROBLEM   
boys’ societies. Three hundred and eighty-four girls as 
against two hundred and fifty-seven boys were found 
in societies formed for children by adults. ‘ Girls are 
more nearly governed by adult motives than boys. 
They organize to promote sociability, to advance 
their interests, to improve themselves and others. 
Boys are nearly primitive man: they associate to 
hunt, fish, roam, fight and to contest physical superi- 
ority with each other.” 
If these facts mean anything in the 
way of instruction, they mean this: 
1. Boys should be sought just before their own 
social development tends to become dangerous, at 
about ten, and held until the organizing craze is over 
and the years of adolescence are well past. Dr. Sheldon 
found two hundred and fifty-seven boys in societies 
formed for them by adults, of whom all but forty were 
from ten to fifteen, but only seven of whom were 
beyond fifteen. Is it not almost more dangerous to 
hold a boy till the most critical year of his life and 
then let him go than not to touch him at all? 
2, Physical activity must be made the basis of social 
work for boys if ibis to seach af nd hold their natural in- 
terests. Other things may be accepted or endured by 
them, but this is what they carefor. A contact which 
begins with athletics, walks, physical development and 
manual training may.ripen into the literary, the scien-, 
tific, the ethical and the religious influences. But it 
would seem wise to utilize the ruder instincts which are 
on the surface before reaching down to the deeper ones. 
3. Wherever ayes girls and boys should be or- Applications

  interested in the same things nor in each other. In all 
social work constant intimacy between maturing boys 
and girls fosters an undesirable precocity and intro- 
duces unnecessarily perplexing problems. The boys 
should have male, or at least virile, leaders. The 
women who succeed in work with boys are usually 
those who can do something the boys like to do better 
than the boys can. The ideals and capacities of most 
women leaders do not point to the highest efficiency 
with boys of the adolescent period, while a manly man 
with some slight athletic prowess, a willingness to 
answer questions and patience to guide by adaptability 
rather than by domineering, can do almost anything 
with a group of boys. Here, however, a strong and 
emphatic exception must be made on account of an- 
other of those many victories which womanis constantly 
winning by means of her intuitions. Sympathy in 
woman will do with boys what strength does in man, 
and many of the most successful workers with boys 
are women. 
Three facts that have not been mentioned must be 
named, which will appear in new light from the knowl- 
ledge gathered in the first chapter. One is the fact 
that the instincts upon which the activities even of 
the worst “gang” are built are the innocent and     
              
         
      natural ones of adolescence. To get together, to work 
ff physical energy, to roam, to contest, to gather 
Treasures and meet new experiences, and — a little 
later — to enjoy female society: these are not in them- 
elves mischievous desires. Again, when child-societies 
re at their best they often do very charming and 
dmirable things. They build, they work together, 
Gi

  they parade, they revive old folk games, they imitate 
the employments and festivals of their elders. As Co- 
lozza tells us, all “ child societies are play societies. 
Play is a great social stimulus. The lively pleasure 
which is felt in play is the prime motive which unites 
children.” We see here not only the fact that play 
educates individually, upon which I shall say more 
later, but that it educates socially. However serious 
may be the purpose which adults have in forming 
societies among children, I think it to be essential to 
approach them joyously, even gaily. Let there be even 
in the instrument of highest spiritual aim not only a 
play method but the play spirit. Otherwise the child 
~4 must feel, ‘‘ Oh, that tiresome grown-up person-with-a- 
mission! Does he not know that I live in a world of 
play? Why will he drag me off to his world of work, 
instead of coming into mine?” The instincts which 
already exist in child societies are those which we are 
to imitate and transform to their best uses. 
The temporariness of these societies, which is almost 
universal, I should say, is interpreted by the truth we 
have learned: that the social consciousness is not yet 
complete. It never is, in many of us. Not every man 
is a clubable man. Jealousy is the explosive that 
most frequently destroys the child’s club. If there is 
any organization at all it is apt to be that of an unlim- 
ited monarchy. When a second boy wants to be mon- 
arch the trouble begins. The matter is often settled, 
as in a colony of bees, by the new monarch withdrawing 
with his own satellites and forming a new kingdom. 
The unsatisfactoriness of these frequent changes, and 
the desire for organization that shall be permanent 
62
-P-A-G-E-63
  Wa Y) 8S) Be O Ne Ss. OCRiG, AGN ol 258 
  
enough for enjoyment, explains some of the willing- 
ness which boys show for adult intervention. This is 
why I think questions of leadership and parliamentary 
law, which are so vexing at this age, should be firmly 
dismissed by an adult leader, and his organization 
become as far as possible a democracy with himself 
the hero and leader of the “ gang.” 
But the most important thing to be 
caramel of said in this chapter is that some oppor- 
he tunity to express this gang-instinct is 
absolutely necessary for the proper 
social education of every boy. There simply is no 
other way under heaven given among men whereby he 
must be saved from narrowness of mind, selfishness 
and self-conceit. Did you ever go to college with a 
boy who was an only child and who had been prepared 
by a private tutor? Then you know what I mean. 
Despite the risks, there seems to be something divinely 
ordained as well as characteristically American about 
the democratic rough-and-tumble of the public school 
and the playground. This does not imply that a 
parent will let his son play wholly unregarded or form 
fellowships that he himself knows nothing about, but 
he will see that he gets a chance — the only chance 
there is — during the friendship-making years, and by 
the education of his peers to learn how to become a 
firm friend, a kind neighbor and a generous citizen. 
For, as President Hall says, ‘‘ The gang instinct itself 
is almost a cry of the soul to be influenced.” 
There are a good many other things, odd, humorous 
or suggestive, about the spontaneous institutions of 
boyhood. I spoke in the last chapter of the clan- 
63 é
-P-A-G-E-64
  
AL BOY. PROBLEM 
  ethics of the “ gang.” This tribe loyalty usually leads 
to rivalry between gangs. Sometimes it is “ town and 
gown”; most often it is between neighborhoods or 
streets; sometimes it is between the boys of neighboring 
cities. A few years ago, it always meant a fight when 
a crowd of Charlestown and a crowd of Cambridge 
boys met on the bridge that was then between the two 
cities. The social settlement clubs are very careful to 
consider these local jealousies by not forming a club 
from more than one neighborhood. I never knew this 
to be considered in a church, but I should think it 
might sometimes be desirable to do so. There is gen- 
eral testimony that it is difficult to do good social work 
with poor and rich children at the same time and place. 
It ought to be easier among boys than girls. Physical 
prowess is a great leveler. Respect of others won in 
physical emulation and even in fighting is the seed of 
affection and awakened kinship. It is a proverb that 
“Two boys never can become chums till they have had 
afight.” In some ways these emulations between boys 
of different classes can be produced and controlled to 
the advantage of both. I know from experience that 
it is possible in this age of ready social interests to 
create artificially a “ gang ”’ out of a group of hitherto 
unrelated boys which shall develop passionate friend- 
ships and loyalties, constitute a lifelong fellowship and 
become a microcosm of the social ideal. The summer 
camp sustained by the rich boys of the Groton School 
for the benefit of poor boys gives some encouragement 
in this direction. The democratic influence of athletics 
in our public schools is, I believe, one of the saving 
forces of the republic.

In passing from the consideration of the spontaneous 
groupings of boys, we may remark that soon after six- 
teen the social instinct takes quite a new form, in the 
“pairing”? tendency. The boy in his first love is 
always found with one chosen girl; each boy also has 
his chum. Two chums often combine with two girls, 
and we have aclique. These pairs and cliques are sore 
interruptions to the continuity especially of church 
societies for young people. These anti-social tenden- 
cies arising so late and so unexpectedly, are baffling 
because they are among those who have arrived at a 
maturing and independent age. Though difficult, they - 
are not discouraging, for they mark the rise of the great 
loves and friendships of life. 
The social instinct thus describes a circle. The phases 
of childhood, adolescence and maturity are these: 
domestic, anti-domestic, domestic; education by one’s 
elders, by one’s contemporaries, by one’s children. 
Life swings out from the home and back to it again. 
During the anti-domestic age of adolescence, social 
opportunities are greatest. The return to the home 
with maturity and the subsequent giving birth to 
children begin a new circle in another generation.

SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS FORMED FOR BOYS 
BY ADULTS 
As detailed descriptions of the many methods that 
are being used to help boys are found in the literature 
of the different movements, it seems sufficient to give 
the briefest analysis of the worth of most of them, with 
a fuller discussion of plans that are especially sug-— 
gestive. One or two general remarks may be made 
at the start. No one of these plans is “ the best.’ 
The personality of the leader countsso much that many | 
aplan that works,” in one place will not do in another, 
and such is the fickleness of the adolescent boy that no 
one-plan is of perpetual or all-inclusive value. There 
is no patent way of saving boys. The methods that 
are generally successful seem to be those that con- 
sciously or unconsciously follow the suggestions drawn 
from the facts presented at the beginning of the last 
chapter. There are a number of organizations of most 
worthy purpose, usually originated and “‘ manned ” by 
women, that have neglected the instincts of boys for 
play, athletics and organizing apart from girls, that 
have practically become as feminine in membership as 
in leadership and in ideals. Nearly every plan has its 
one strong point, a few have several good ideals, some 
could be easily strengthened by imitation of others, and 
some would be worth while only as supplementary. 
This~latter statement is true of those societies that 
stand for a single civic or ethical virtue.

    SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS 
  The various methods which will be mentioned divide 
into two classes: those which have and those which have 
not the religious element. Some will tell us that this 
division is also a caste line, and that the community 
clubs reach street boys while the church clubs reach 
only boys from good homes. I fear this is often true. 
The exact fact is that the community clubs in ignoring 
the religious element are able to reach Protestant, 
Romanist and Hebrew, which no single church can do. 
If one believes the community clubs are therein faulty, 
he must also remember that they are more widely in- 
clusive. The community clubs are by no means anti- 
religious, and are heartily willing to encourage their 
boys to supplement their club life with the religious 
influences of their respective faiths. The two types 
must be recognized and each may well be more tolerant 
of the other. In the community clubs we study every 
form of pedagogy except the religious. In the church 
clubs religious pedagogy is central, and the other forms 
are usually subsidiary. The former propose to make 
good men, impelled by every true motive except the 
religious, which they leave the church to give. The 
latter should propose to make good men, impelled by 
every true motive, including the religious. Probably 
the community club can make the more boys good and 
the church club can make the fewer boys better. 
Among the non-religious or “ com- 
munity clubs ”’ which exist in our cities 
we find two theories which seem to be radically differ- 
ent. The ‘“ mass clubs” have one, and the “ group 
clubs ” (usually in connection with social settlements), 
have the other. I think Mr. William A. Clark, the head 
67 Mass Clubs
-P-A-G-E-68
  THE BOvYy PROBLEM 
  of Gordon House, has fairly stated the settlement 
view: 
“The boys’ club of twenty years ago was a very 
simple affair. The membership in such a club varied 
from 800 to 2,500. Any boy in the city could be ad- 
mitted to the club. The workers consisted of a door- 
keeper, librarian and superintendent. During the club 
session the superintendent was obliged to walk about 
the rooms as a moral policeman. Occasionally visitors 
from the various churches came to assist by playing 
_games with the boys. Later a few industrial classes, 
such as carpentry, clay-modeling, wood-carving, cob- 
bling, typesetting, ete., were added. A penny savings 
bank was a leading feature of this sort of club, and 
occasional entertainments. Finally, with this plan, it 
is possible to have an exceedingly large membership. 
This in itself is a strong feature in the minds of many. 
Large figures look prosperous in a report. 
» “With the advent of the university 
settlement » new kind of club came 
into being. It differs from the old plan radically in 
that it is always very much smaller. The most char- 
acteristic plan of a Settlement Boys’ Club in brief is 
this: A group of boys, eight or ten, usually of the same 
gang, all coming from the immediate neighborhood. 
This neighborhood idea is, as you know, one of the 
basal principles of the settlement. Such a group usu- 
ally meets once or twice a week in charge of a leader. 
The program for the little club varies with the taste of 
the leader and the boys. The leader, as a rule, is a 
person of refinement. 
“ The legitimate aim of the large club is to keep as

many boys as possible off the street, giving them a 
cheerful room with games and books. The aim of the 
settlement is to take a small group, and through a 
refined, tactful leader ‘ with a social soul,’ as one man 
expresses it, moralize these boys by the power of friend- 
ship. The superintendent of a club of fifteen hundred, 
assuming that he is equally as well educated and re- 
fined as the settlement type of man, can only be a 
friend to these boys in theory. Friendship means 
knowledge. No man can know fifteen hundred boys. 
Most workers find it hard enough to know ten boys well. 
“And yet the esprit de corps of one hundred boys, for 
instance, is different from the esprit de corps of a group 
of ten. Personally, I believe that the group idea and 
the mass idea should be combined in the plan of the 
club. The old type of club has features of strength 
which should not be lost in the new plan.” 
Thus far the group clubs seem to have the advantage. 
They are further strong in that the boys? club is often 
one of an ascending group of clubs, embracing the 
whole family and giving a place into which the boy may 
graduate. In thoroughness, comprehensiveness and 
the power of personality, the group club is a model 
social instrument. ; 
The mass club, however, is open every night to 
every boy. To keep a boy off the street every night 
in the week is what the mass clubs actually do. “ If 
we can only keep the boy where he can be found when 
he is wanted,” says Thomas Chew, “‘ we are doing a 
good deal.” The mass clubs propose to reach the 
toughest boys in the city; the group clubs as frankly 
do not. It is easy to see that the street arab is un- 
69  
-P-A-G-E-70
  THE BOY, PROBLEM   
likely to enter voluntarily under the surveillance and 
patronage of a refined lady or gentleman from the 
Back Bay in a small room, and that while the superin- 
tendent of the mass club may not know each arab per- 
sonally, each arab will know him. Mr. Chew argues 
that as the influence of Washington and Lincoln ex- 
tended farther than the limits of their personal 
acquaintance, so the boys’ club superintendent is the 
hero and guide to a much larger circle than he can 
personally know. It is also true that the mass club 
superintendent serves a much longer time in one club 
than does the volunteer settlement worker, and that 
he knows the boy on the street, in the school-yard and 
in the police court as well as in the orthodox way in 
the home. The tendency of all social work is to draw 
away from the very poor and unlovable. The intro- 
duction of a fine building or equipment in the section 
of the very poor has sometimes estranged the very 
class for which it was provided, and has caused its 
activities to be regarded as charitable doles rather than 
as social brotherhood. The mass club occupies a field 
that no other organization attempts to fill, and one in 
which the settlement would fail if, alone, it tried to fill 
it. There are over one hundred and twenty-five such 
clubs in this country, and they probably reach at least 
fifty thousand boys each year. 
The two forms of work seem to be learning from each 
other. The mass plan has the advantage of bringing 
a very large number of needy boys under wholesome 
influence, removing them from the street and filling 
their minds and hands too full for the organization of 
mischief. By using the mass idea first, the suspicions 
70

SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS 
  and feelings of restraint that would be excited by the 
confinement of a group are done away with, the wilder 
physical instincts are satisfied first, that spectacular 
element that is in every street boy’s life gets some 
recognition and time is given the boy to settle down to 
the quieter group methods. Thus some settlements 
keep their new boys in the gymnasium and the large 
assembly-room for a time before admitting them to 
the group clubs. On the other hand, the mass club 
director does not deal with boys in the mass because 
he likes to. As far as he sees the need of individual 
workers who will divide the mass into groups, and as 
far as he succeeds in getting such workers, he is doing 
so and is thus approaching the group plan of the 
settlement clubs. The best mass club workers reach 
the homes of their boys as regularly as does the average 
pastor those of his people. It is equally true that many 
a group club leader sighs for the splendid esprit de 
corps of the larger club, where the boys never feel that 
they are being patronized and really believe they own 
the whole building. 
Sometimes the group idea is carried to an extreme. 
I once visited a settlement at night and asked to see 
its boys’ work. We went to the top story of a build- 
ing and, after a search for a key, succeeded in entering 
a dark room where there were some sloyd benches, 
which I was assured were used on “ some other even- 
ings.” A group of young men was also seen in another 
small room. No doubt a few boys were being very 
thoroughly helped, but somehow it seemed like knit- 
ting-work. On the same evening in an old ramshackle 
building in the same city a hundred and fifty boys were 
a

  crowding the rooms to the doors with their games, 
gymnastics and classes in a mass club, and were doing 
so every night in the week. On the other hand, they 
were being graduated into the street in droves at six- 
teen for lack of room and of any wise institution to 
receive them. Here we see the two dangers, — in one 
plan, of coddling a few; in the other, of providing no 
resources for the many until the ages of immaturity 
and special temptation are over. 
Both kinds of clubs are reaching out rapidly into 
new fields of work, and it is easy to see that modifica- 
tions are soon to appear in many institutions. Both 
are emphasizing and receiving splendid results from 
summer work in club farms, excursions, camps, club 
gardens and vacation schools. The police court work 
of the mass club director is believed to be forming an 
important influence upon those who are at the brink 
of a criminal career. The group clubs, again, are 
strengthening their groups by insisting that the vol- 
unteer workers who are leaders shall regard their work 
not as a sentimental fad or temporary mission, but that 
they remain long enough to let their refined personalities 
avail for something of permanence. 
In large clubs, especially street boys’ clubs, two im- 
portant\things should not be neglected. One thing is 
~y-to-arrange.some_way by which the boys as they get 
crowded out of the club by age shall be graduated into 
some other wholesome organization. The other thing 
is for the director to afford an opportunity for religious 
care by standing ready to furnish to each priest and 
pastor in the community the list of boys of each church 
who attend his club. The club should supplement 
72
-P-A-G-E-73
  SOCIAL OR GA NT AT TONS 
  itself in this way by affiliation with every possible 
moral agency. 
A very deep question is as to the relation of all this 
work to that fundamental institution, the home. The 
craze for organization and cooperative activity, ap- 
parent among society people even more than among 
the poor, and among adults more than among children, 
suggests the dire possibility that human life may 
sometime become one great club system. As to street 
boys it seems sufficient to reply that they will not stay 
at home anyway. With Frank S. Mason, founder of 
the Bunker Hill Boys’ Club, we may say: “ It is a true ~ 
and trite saying that a good home is a better place for 
a boy at night than a boys’ club. If all homes were 
perfect homes, then would the boys’ club be useless; 
if it were possible to reform many homes, it would not 
be necessary to form boys’ clubs; if it were possible for 
public school teachers to stand in the same relation to 
their classes as does the director to the members of his 
club, there would be no need of boys’ clubs; could the 
churches be inspired to do this kind of work, and do it 
with the breadth with which it is done in the boys’ 
club, the boys’ club would have no existence. It is, 
therefore, in my mind, an important, but not the only 
means of reaching the boy, and it, as well as other 
possible means, should be pushed to the utmost in 
every city and town in the country.” 
Without going into the matter of the tendencies of 
other organizations as to the home, there are already 
manifest in the boys’ club movement some signs that 
are encouraging in this regard. The activities of the 
club themselves react upon the home. Boys bring 
73

  THE BO: PROBLEM 
  artistic handiwork to adorn the home, and papers and 
books to be read at home; boys learn to cook, to repair 
and make furniture and to cobble shoes, and apply this 
knowledge at home; boys are given unfinished work to 
take home and complete. Both the settlements and the 
mass clubs find that they begin with the boy but cannot 
finish their work until they touch the rest of the family. 
At Lincoln House, Boston, the elaborate system of 
scores of clubs — of children, boys, girls, young men, 
young women, fathers, mothers, reaching twelve hun- 
dred people — actually grew out of one club for boys. 
This is the natural tendency everywhere. The result 
of these indications is to draw out from their homes 
for one or more times a week the children and then the 
parents, to inspire and teach them and give them new 
resources, trusting that they will return and apply these 
acquisitions in home life. A more normal way of help- 
ing the home would seem to be that of the Home Library 
System. The aim here ig the opposite one, of going 
into the home and stimulating its better elements. 
The plan is this: —A book-shelf of books is loaned to a 
poor home and a volunteer visitor comes in, not to talk 
religion or morals or give charity, but to gather a group 
of eight or ten children and read to them. Games and 
pictures are circulated in the same way and the pass- 
books of the Stamp Saving Society are distributed 
and collected. The ways in which this plan refines, 
educates, encourages cleanliness, morality, frugality, 
sobriety, pride in the home and the genuine spirit of 
friendship, and satisfies the play-instinct and the social 
nature may be readily imagined. The only trouble 
with this splendid idea is that it is millennial, The poor

  want the excitement of the street and of the crowd, 
and the good people who might come to help want to 
do something that is connected with an annual report, 
an institution and the fellowship of other refined folk, 
who are also workers. Yet this sort of thing is some- 
thing that anybody can start right off and do, and 
without waiting for anybody else to begin or to or- 
ganize. At the South End House in Boston the Home 
Library plan has been used as a corrective to the anti- 
domestic and the institutionalizing tendencies. The 
scheme is to plant these home libraries as outposts 
through different parts of the neighborhood rather than 
to group all the clubs in one large building. It may 
be desirable and possible to satisfy both this love for 
the larger social atmosphere and that for the domestic 
circle among the same people by coordinating the two 
methods. 
The 
Y.M.C. A. Another agency for helping the city 
boy in which the religious element is 
present is that of the Boys’ Branch of 
the Young Men’s Christian Association. The boys’ de- 
partment was an afterthought, and in few of the Asso- 
ciation buildings was adequate provision made for it. 
But the officers of the international movement are 
awakening to its importance and, with the present 
emphasis upon the religious crisis of adolescence, it is 
rapidly becoming the most important thing in Associa- 
tion work. The Associations have an almost ideal 
equipment for boys’ work, but the fact that it is mo- 
nopolized by the men at the time when the street boys 
ean use it has emphasized the tendency, which the 
prohibitive fees and the general trend of the Association 
7

  THE BO Y. PROBLEM 
  work have made, to adapt the work to schoolboys of 
the upper and middle classes of society. There is 
certainly need enough in our large cities of an institu- 
tion especially for these boys, who are as much in 
danger physically and morally as those who are poorer. 
A plan which has been adopted lately with excellent 
wisdom is, when an old building is abandoned for a 
better one, not to sell it, but to give it entirely to the | 
boys’ department. This has suggested the possibility 
that the boys’ departments which have this special 
equipment may enter into work for street boys upon 
broader lines than heretofore. The admirable inter- 
national organization, with its centralized office and 
close oversight of its branches, would certainly give 
an executive and economical direction which the street 
boys’ clubs in their scattered efforts have sorely lacked. 
On the other hand, it is difficult to see how the Asso- 
ciation, confined in its support and ideals to Protestant 
people of the evangelical type, could work in Hebrew, 
Irish or French neighborboods successfully unless it 
curtailed its distinctively religious methods. 
The Association, although its boys’ work is so new, 
has already gone into many suggestive departments 
of work, some of which are enumerated by the leader 
of this new crusade, Mr. E. M. Robinson, the Inter- 
national Boys’ Work secretary of the movement: “‘ The 
gymnasium, with.its swimming-tank and bathing 
facilities; the bowling-alleys, the basket-ball leagues 
and baseball clubs, football games, the cross-country 
running, the outings, bicycle clubs, rough riders, hiking 
clubs, canoe and boat clubs, the boys’ summer camps, 
with their multitudinous activities; hospital corps,

drum-corps, the small clubs in the building, camera 
clubs, stamp clubs, coin clubs, magic clubs, natural 
history clubs, educational clubs, observation parties, 
popular talks, illustrated lectures, library, reading- 
rooms, games, debates, literary societies, the educa- 
tional and industrial classes, sloyd, carpentry, printing, 
electricity, scroll-sawing, basket-making, etching, 
sketching, poster-painting, music, commercial branches 
and English, the committee service of boys and con- 
ferences and conventions of boys, the gospel meetings, 
prayer-meetings, Bible classes of various kinds, with 
blackboard, water-colors, paper-pulp maps and models; 
stereopticon andillustrated lessons, chalk talks, chemical 
talks, Yoke Fellows’ Bands, missionary classes, junior 
volunteer leagues, personal workers’ bands, etc.” One 
of the latest outgrowths which the Association with its 
splendid athletic history is excellently well fitted to 
lead is the developing and federating of athletics in the 
Sunday-schools-of a city by Sunday-school athletic 
leagues. But of all these no doubt the most important 
contribution is the boys’ camp. To this means of re- 
turn to the natural country of boyhood, the free life 
of out-of-doors, the Association has applied itself with 
large wisdom and patience. The interesting light 
which these camps throw upon boy nature and boys’ 
needs, the susceptibility to healthy moral and religious 
impressions at these places, and the fruitful results, 
I shall speak of in another chapter. 
The boys’ department of the Association is confer- 
ring many benefits upon the churches. It does a valu- 
able social work in bringing together boys from different 
localities and churches. In many great cities it deals 
17
-P-A-G-E-78
  THE BOY PROBLEM   
    with as many boys who are outside as are inside 
churches. In other places the preponderance of girls 
in the young people’s societies and the lack of Sunday- 
school lessons and methods adaptable to boys has laid 
upon it a great opportunity and burden. The Asso- 
ciation is teaching the churches many lessons as to the 
ways to approach boys, the desirability of organizing 
them apart from girls and of recognizing the various 
ages and the way to teach them the Bible and religion. 
In its triangle representing “ Spirit, Mind and Body,” 
its aim is all-round development of the entire nature. 
Too often the church has thought of the boy as all 
spirit. In some small cities I have felt that the superior 
success of the Association has created a clashing with 
the churches. Must the Association always insist on 
having all parts of the triangle represented in its own 
walls? Might it not be better sometimes if the Asso- 
ciation in its boys’ work should be largely the conven- 
ient federation of athletic and supplementary agencies 
which no single church can adequately support, while 
its secretary cooperates in helping the development of 
means of spiritual nurture for boys in the churches them- 
selves? I am persuaded that in many a community 
the pastors, though unable to provide institutional 
features for their boys, have very carefully planned 
spiritual instrumentalities, with which boys’ meetings, 
Bible classes and committees at the Association are 
a well-meant but unjustifiable interference. Let the 
secretary quietly yield to every effort for nurture in the 
local church. Instead of conducting boys’ Bible classes, 
let the secretary, for example, be the teacher of the - 
teachers of boys’ classes in the separate Sunday-schools.

  The boys’ department has continually to fight 
against a foe which is already the too-successful enemy 
of the men’s department, namely, the idea that one 
goes to the Association to get something, that the fee 
of $3, $5 or $8 represents an outlay which one must 
scrupulously insist on getting back in the form of 
physical benefits or even of spiritual blessings. It is 
against this tendency, which associates itself so readily 
with the subjective type of religion which the Associa- 
tion used to foster, that Dr. Luther Gulick has waged 
such a determined warfare. It is the remainder of that 
selfishness in religion that makes many a Christian 
parent feel that he can trust better the approach, the 
subsequent care and the product of religious experience 
in his boy in the church than in the Association. The 
improvement of the quality of men who take up the 
secretaryship of the boys’ department will be the way 
to overcome this tendency. The idea that a more 
sentimental, a little weaker-minded and a somewhat 
nondescript type of man will do the boys’ work, and 
that a junior secretaryship is only a stepping-stone to 
something higher is giving place to the recognition that 
this work demands the life consecration of men of the 
same ability and training as the public school masters 
of boys of this same age. The practical way for this 
reform to be brought about will be for the communities 
which support the Association to give the boys’ director 
a somewhat better salary than that of an assistant 
janitor or a shipping-clerk. One of the finest forces to 
counteract the selfish tendency in the individual mem- 
ber is the recent effort to secure evangelizing of boys by 
their own Christian fellows. As on the foreign field it

  THE BOY PROBLEM 
  is the native worker who is most. efficient, so a boy of 
one’s own age is to another boy the “ native worker ” 
most adapted to lead him to Christ. The influence 
of such altruism, if sincere and unaffected, upon 
the young Christian himself is most enlarging to 
the soul. 
The thought that the boys’ department exists not 
for itself but for the community and for the churches 
is coming into slow recognition. A few Associations 
have already begun to plant their outposts away from 
their fortresses, their own buildings. The first picket 
line is apt to be the boat-house or the camp. In 
many instances Associations are furnishing gymnasium 
instructors for churches and street boys’ clubs. In 
some small places the secretary gets hold of a “ gang” 
before it becomes dangerous and persuades it to be- 
come affiliated with the Association, either as a special 
club in the main building or as an outpost branch. 
This taking advantage of the neighborhood and “gang” 
spirit is an intelligent recognition of social conditions, 
and makes it possible for the Association to do a much 
more elastic and comprehensive work. 
We have been speaking thus far of instrumentalities 
suited to large and crowded populations. But it is 
coming to be recognized that the small cities and the 
large towns also have their boy problem. There life 
is a smaller pool that stirs ceaselessly about itself, and 
much of the sin which in the great city flows past the 
child on the wider current of many interests sticks, 
because of the influence of some strong evil personality 
or by reason of the greater relative importance and 
strength of village “ gangs,” which are unrestrained by 
80

  SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS 
  uniformed police and city walls. The nearness of the 
country is both the danger and the salvation of these 
boys, for the boys who live nearer to nature are more 
full of will and independence either for good or for evil, 
while in country conditions themselves may be found 
the antidotes to the ills of boy life. 
In the small towns and in larger places where 
Protestant churches predominate I am persuaded that 
this work may best be done by the churches, either 
formally or by substantial cooperation. They have 
the workers and the facilities. If it be true, as I think 
it is, that the places in America in which it is most 
desirable to live are the large towns and small cities, 
one great reason why this is so is because it is pos- 
sible in such places to coordinate the religious, intel- 
lectual, social and physical life of the community, not 
for boys only, but for all, that there shall be no barriers 
between them, but that all shall be for the harmony 
of well-rounded human development. Contrary to the 
usual impression, I believe that the summer as much 
as the winter is in such places a favorable time for 
work with boys. The country-out-of-doors itself is the 
best laboratory, the best club-house for boys. Here 
they are at home and so are known and dealt with at 
their best and most naturally. It used to be thought 
that boys could safely be left to themselves during the 
summer vacation, but it is coming to be realized that 
this is the time when the gang-spirit often becomes 
most obnoxious and that, while no doubt the child 
absorbs much knowledge and power from Mother 
Nature, yet there are great possibilities in directing and 
interpreting this outdoor education.

-P-A-G-E-82
  THE BOY PROBLEM 
  An experiment which made this em- The Play : OA School phasis upon summer activities and yet 
. which carried the boys through the year 
in a large country town was that of the Andover Play 
School, devised and superintended by George E. John- 
son, when he was superintendent of public schools in 
Andover, Mass. Mr. Johnson, who adds to the quali- 
fications of being an expert athlete and an authority 
upon the place of play in education those rare traits 
which win confidence, of patience, thoroughness and 
perseverance in observation and effort, brought into 
being a social institution of great value and suggestive- 
ness. It had a far-reaching influence upon the vaca- 
tion school movement in its various forms. It was 
based upon the play-instinct with all the other allied 
instincts of which play is an expression. Its purpose 
was to utilize those neglected instincts in education, and 
much was made of will-training by self-origination and 
execution of handiwork. Mr. Johnson describes the 
plan as follows in the Pedagogical Seminary: 
“ Tt is a school for boys ranging from ten to fourteen 
years of age. Its sessions have been evening sessions 
in the winter and day sessions during the summer va- 
cation. The work of the school has been based en- 
tirely upon the play interests of the boys attending. 
The work has varied somewhat according to the season 
of the year, but the description will concern mainly 
the work of the summer sessions. 
“The school was in session for six weeks during 
July and August, the school day was from half past 
eight to twelve, and forty boys were regularly in at- 
tendance. There were three periods in the school day, 
82 
 
-P-A-G-E-83
  
SOCIAL ORGAN DZ ATT ONS 
  the first and third being one hour and a half in length, 
and the second one hour. A free choice of occupation 
was granted at the beginning of the term, very little 
occasion for change in the divisions occurring thereafter. 
“ Perhaps the favorite occupation, on the whole, was 
the wood-work. There was a complete sloyd outfit 
and a trained sloyd teacher. No attempt was made 
to hold the boys to a formulated course. The wood- 
work was to serve as a sort of supply shop for the 
apparatus used in the school. The boys made their 
own butterfly nets and fish nets for the nature work. 
They made the mounting boards used in mounting the 
specimens, the cases for the permanent collections, 
developing cages for the caterpillars, aquaria for the 
fishes, box traps for catching squirrels, etc. If a boy 
was interested in archery, he made his bow and arrows; 
if in cricket, a bat; if in kite-flying, a kite; if in making 
a present for a younger brother or sister, a toy table, 
perhaps. Mothers, too, reaped the benefits of the 
shop, for a boy often turned from his toy-making to 
the making of a sleeve-board, ironing-board, bread- 
board, shelf or something else for the house. Some- 
times the boys united in making some giant affair of 
common interest; as, for example, a great windmill 
which supplied power for turning the grindstone, or a 
dam or sluiceway for the water-wheel, or a catamaran 
for the swimming-pool. One summer the boys built 
a log cabin. 
“ The nature work was hardly less popular than the 
toy-making. Nearly every morning there might be 
seen a company of ten or a dozen boys starting out 
with the leader in search of butterflies or fishes, and 
83
-P-A-G-E-84
  T HE BOY PROBLEM 
  for the incidental study of birds, or frogs, or snakes, 
or whatever came to their notice while hunting. The 
older boys devoted themselves mainly to the butter- 
flies, the younger to the fishes. Nearly every species 
of butterfly to be found in Andover during the season 
was captured, many kinds of caterpillars were taken and 
developed into chrysalids in the cages, and nearly all 
the different kinds of fishes to be found in the streams 
and ponds of Andover were caught and studied. The 
work consisted largely of outdoor tramps, but there 
was also laboratory work, the description and drawing 
of the worm, chrysalis and butterfly. Honey-bees in 
an observation hive, and ants in nests made of school 
slates covered with glass were watched. Some of the 
ants’ nests were successfully kept and watched for 
months, one boy keeping a colony all winter. The 
microscope was frequently used in the laboratory work. 
Note-books on fishes were also kept. The interest of 
the boys was deepest in the gathering and general ob- 
servation and naming of specimens, the watching and 
feeding of the fishes, and less in the minuter observa- 
tion, drawing and naming the parts. The zeal in the 
hunting of specimens was often intense. 
“Allied to the nature work was the gardening. A 
part of the school-yard was plowed and a definite por- 
tion allotted to each boy who chose gardening. Vege- 
tables of various kinds were planted. Flower plants 
were also a part of the care and possession of the boys, 
and were taken home and transplanted by the boys at 
the close of the school. The following spring, many 
of these boys were reported to me as having started 
gardens of their own at home.

  “Tn the winter session, stamp and picture collections 
were substituted for the nature collections, the stamp- 
collecting craze spreading like wild-fire among the 
school children last winter, some of the candy and 
cigarette counters suffering thereby, to my certain 
knowledge. 
“The second period of the day, one hour in length, 
was spent in outdoor play. In one section of the play- 
ground might have been seen a group of boys engaged 
in a match at archery. In another section, the older 
boys, perhaps, divided into opposing sides by some 
natural grouping which lent zest to emulation, were 
hard at a spirited game of ball. Elsewhere some of the 
younger or less athletic boys were playing at tenpins 
on the smooth driveway, or at bean bags. There were 
also, at times, football, basket-ball, ring-toss, tag 
games, boxing, wrestling, racing, jumping, vaulting, 
gymnastic tricks, kite-flying, boat-racing at Rabbitt’s 
Pond, swimming races at Pomp’s or in the Shawsheen. 
Three times a week there was a division in swimming. 
The swimming lessons often served as a good opportu- 
nity for collecting specimens or plants for the aquaria. 
On rainy days there were indoor games, which partook 
more of the nature of social or parlor games and which 
were intellectual rather than physical. 
“The musically inclined boys were always eager for 
an orchestra. This took the form of a kindersym- 
phonie. The talents and attainments of the boys 
made the music necessarily crude, but it was much 
enjoyed by them. The violinists were children who 
eame for the orchestra alone, the play-school boys 
being confined mainly to time-beating instruments. 
85
-P-A-G-E-86

THE BOvy PROBLEM   
There was a class also in piano-playing which met 
twice a week. 
“ The printing department appealed to some as real 
play. The press served in printing the names of the 
boys in the several departments, the baseball teams, 
headings for school exercise papers, cards, some bill- 
heads, and, best of all, a four-paged paper issued at 
the close of the last school, containing compositions 
of the boys on the work of the various departments, 
names of prize-takers, cuts of drawings made in the 
nature work, list of specimens captured and the like. 
“ Besides the drawing in the nature work, there was 
a division in drawing for those who preferred it to any 
other occupation they might have during that period. 
The work took the form, mainly, of large free drawings 
from objects. This was the nearest allied to regular 
school work of any department, unless we except the 
library from which the boys eagerly drew books of 
stories, history or nature, for home reading.” 
The essential things about this remarkable lilliputian 
community seem to have been the intelligent contact 
with nature, the devising and making by the boys of 
their instruments of play and work — but nothing like 
formal sloyd or classroom drill — and the natural and 
friendly social relations with the boys of the adult 
workers, some of whom were paid and some volunteer. 
Mr. Johnson’s summer work was planned as a part 
of a continuous play-school curriculum to run from 
boyhood to manhood, and, especially in winter even- 
ings, to reach the working boys as well as to the school 
boys of the village. 
In the small town of Norway, Maine, two gentlemen

  went to work some time ago, independently of each 
other, to lead the boys of their acquaintance into accu- 
rate study and observation of nature in the hill region 
about them. They found that the boys responded to 
the most painstaking work and that the results in 
character were as encouraging as in natural history. 
Now, as some one has said, “ flowers are not ethics,” 
but fellowship is, and comradeship on the fair levels 
of nature study is character-forming. 
The Rev. Herbert A. Jump in studying the country 
problem dismisses the Y. P. S. C. E. and Y. M. C. A. as 
being unable to contribute very much help, and feels 
that few individual country churches have pastors, 
members or equipment adequate to the need. ‘ Why, 
then,’ he asks, “should not the school building be 
appropriated as a boys’ rendezvous?” About the 
school in each village let a system of self-governing 
clubs be organized with athletic, chivalric, patriotic, 
parliamentary or social interests, adapted to various 
ages. Each club will be under the supervision of an 
adult. These club leaders will naturally meet from 
time to time for conference with a general superintend- 
ent, who will be an interested citizen, a teacher, or, at 
least desirably, a minister. Thus the school would be- 
come a center for every wholesome boyish occupation 
or diversion, — a play center out of hours as well as a 
study center in hours, and all the while a growth center.

many of the features of the industrial training given in 
the old pioneer home, with a more enlightened educa-

way the school may cooperate with the home, fill 
wholesomely the leisure of the boy and help him plan 
his future. 
By beginning in a small and natural way, with a 
leader who has mastered the idea and who is a person of 
efficiency, and a few volunteer workers who know some- 
thing about tools, insects, plants or sports, and a group 
of boys, and a very little apparatus, this sort of work 
inside or outside a school ought in any place to grow to 
something very serviceable and fruitful, without any of

which usually seem to be connected with an institution.

Let us now turn to some of the agencies, found in 
both city and country, in which the religious element 
is central. I shall give an entire chapter to a con- 
structive study of aims and methods. What I shall 
do here is simply to describe some of the methods now 
in existence. 
A popular way of helping boys and 
pale girls in the church is in the Junior En- Christian ai Societ d kindred ’ 
BadGavor eavor Society and kindred organiza- 
tions. The Endeavor movement soon 
found a practical difficulty in the fact that its young 
people, some of whom were quite young when they 
entered, remained in the society year after year, and 
that just as soon as their average age began to increase 
it became almost impossible to gather in younger 
members. To meet this need, in 1884, junior societies, 
and a few years later intermediate societies, began to 
be established, formed in complete imitation of the 
societies of older young people. Thus naturally, and 
89
-P-A-G-E-90
    THE BOY PROBLEM 
  
yet we may say somewhat thoughtlessly, an institution 
was introduced into our churches with the same name 
and methods as one already existing, but with no query 
as to whether means that were adaptable to persons 
from sixteen to sixty would be perfectly natural to boys 
and girls from ten to sixteen. 
It cannot be denied that the Christian Endeavor 
movement is passing through a period of reaction and 
readjustment. As to the needs of the movement as it 
applies to adults it would be aside from the main ques- 
tion to enter into discussion here. But the general dis- 
satisfaction with the Endeavor scheme as it applies to — 
juniors, and the increasing growth of societies that are 
substitutes or are supplementary to it, especially for 
boys, makes the question pertinent, whether the En- 
deavor idea is applicable to boys. 
An interesting test as to whether these junior societies 
do actually suit young children may be taken from the 
results of Dr. Sheldon’s study, already referred to, of 
the societies, clubs and gangs which children sponta- 
neously organize. If interest is the key to influence, 
what boys like to do is a criterion as to the sort of things 
which it is wise to do with them. Three things were 
definitely discovered regarding these societies: Physical 
activity, in the forms of play, construction, wandering 
and athletics, was the supreme interest, 854 per cent of 
the societies having this as its characteristic; leagues for 
religious expression were almost entirely absent; boys 
and girls almost never organized together. 
We see at once that these junior societies ignore 
these three facts, for they are mostly organizations for 
sitting still, they aim directly at verbal religious ex-

  pression, and they include boys and girls together. If 
we combine with verbal religious expression the pres- 
ence of the other sex, we make a demand which is a 
sore tax upon simplicity and sincerity. 
Religion in a child may be real, but it is only a 
promise. It is not yet time to talk about it or display 
it in any vocal way. ‘“ Oh, that I might do something 
for God!” not, “ Oh, to say something! ” is his ery. 
With boys especially this is a time of reserves; the 
distance between apprehension and expression is never 
so long as now; it is more important to brood than to 
utter, and public prayer or testimony or opinion is, in 
this imitative age, sure to be parrot-like and unnatural. 
It is a period when a boy tries to be honest with him- 
self. The insistence upon an indenturing for life by 
the ironclad pledge and the easy tolerance of its fre- 
quent infraction does this quality of his nature a 
serious wrong. ‘ Nothing tends more to give to chil- 
dren a sense of unreality,” says Sir Joshua Fitch, 
“ than the habit of exacting from them professions of 
faith which do not honestly correspond to their present 
stage of religious experience.” When a boy wants to 
talk in meeting at this age there is generally something 
the matter with him. I have often observed that it 
is not the best or most thoughtful boys who do the 
praying and talking in these meetings. It is rather 
those of quick but shallow natures who ought to be 
repressed rather than encouraged, and who are learning 
a light and easy manner of religious expression which 
may later easily become weakly fluent and more or less 
consciously hypocritical. On the other hand, an im- 
mature boy of a deeper nature will often be led into

THE BO Y PROBLEM 
  
giving expressions of himself, honest at the time, which 
he later recognizes as crude and overwrought, the re- 
sult of which may be to silence his lips forever or to 
persuade him that he has lost, in losing its temporary 
fervor, the reality of his religious life. This may help 
explain why it is that the Endeavor movement, origi- 
nated largely to feed and fructify the church prayer- 
meeting, has been such a disappointment in this regard. 
He must be blind who does not see that in New England 
at least the mid-week meeting is ceasing to be a place 
for the offering of prayer and the giving of personal 
religious experience. 
Another fact which I have already mentioned is that 
life to adolescents comes on in waves, between which 
are rhythms or lulls. Those who have much to do with 
boys intimately, and many men from their memory 
of childhood, have testified that conversion is quite apt 
to come in three successive waves of increasing power 
about two or three years apart. Between these waves 
there is a period of depression, caused perhaps by 
pubertal or other physical changes. This is “ the pin- 
feather age,” the blunder period. In these lulls the 
child is apt to think he has lost his faith or sinned away 
his day of grace. The junior methods are very apt to 
intensify the morbidness and introspection of these 
curious intermediary periods. 
It seems to me that Dr. Coe has in his study of tem- 
peraments cut the ground away forever from under 
that hoary heresy that “ the prayer-meeting is the 
thermometer of the church.” The exact truth is that 
it is the thermometer of the people of sanguine or mel- 
ancholic temperaments in the church. Sainthood, as

  he points out, has in all ages, especially the medieval, 
been granted to those of devout feeling and devout 
expression, and it has only been seldom that men have 
“ perceived that merely filling one’s station in life in 
the fear of God is a spiritual exercise.” The saints of 
the Endeavor movement — and they are real saints — 
are men of the devotional type. They publish or push 
the writings of Meyer, Murray, Morgan, Moody and 
McGregor, who are also saints and of the same type; 
they encourage a comradeship of the Quiet Hour, which 
appeals to saints of the same type; and they believe 
that the prayer-meeting is the thermometer of the 
Christian. But there are other good people who think 
the writings of those saints who begin with M tire- 
some, who if they had a quiet hour would say their 
prayers all through and then have fifty-seven minutes 
in which to start up and do something, and to whom 
either a prayer-meeting is irksome or personal partici- 
pation in it painful and unprofitable. They were made 
that way. They are of the choleric type. 
It is no reflection upon the manliness of the former 
class when Professor Coe points out that women are 
overwhelmingly of sanguine or melancholic tempera- 
ment, and that it is something more than mere coin- 
cidence that women should be in the majority in the 
churches where “ the forms of religious life natural to 
the choleric temperament are habitually discounted in 
favor of those natural to the sanguine and melancholic 
temperaments.” 
Whether this tendency has begun to show its results 
in the Endeavor movement there is time, but perhaps 
there are not sufficient data, to make evident. Itisa 
93

    THE BiOwy PROBLEM 
fact that in the states and the denomination in those 
states in which the movement started the societies have 
lately fallen off very largely in membership. 
It is also everywhere noticeable that the movement 
is becoming predominantly feminine, and that it is 
increasingly difficult to hold young men of the active 
type in its membership. And the reason we lose 
men is that the movement is not well adapted to the 
boys. 
With all this that has just been said about the 
dangers of verbal religious expression, it is also fair to 
say that there are many of my friends, especially in 
the Y. M. C. A., who believe that for boys when they 
are together by themselves, with a judicious leader, at 
camp or in some other natural relationship, to inter- 
change their religious sentiments or even to pray is a 
perfectly natural and wholesome exercise. But even 
these men do not advocate that such performances be 
encouraged in the presence of the other sex. 
There are in the Endeavor forces and organization 
possibilities that point to successful social and re- 
ligious work, under wiser methods. These societies 
usually command the services of some of the best and 
wisest leaders in the churches. They meet, as the boys 
outgrow their boys’ clubs, that temptation, to which 
so many workers with boys yield, of holding boys by 
selfish attractions rather than by service for others, by 
a demand for unselfishness. 
Such religious bands as these are splendid untram- 
melled opportunities for children to serve God and 
perform religious duty. They give instant definiteness 
to consecration, The word “ Endeavor” was an in-

spiration. It expresses the ideals of youth. To try, 
to persist, to attain, — these are the things a boy wants 
todo. The junior idea has in it the three things which 
are fundamental to work that shall help boys: some- 
thing to love, something to know and something to do. 
There is the hearty devotion to the personal Christ, the 
disposition to seek wiser ways of instructing the chil- 
dren and the splendidly planned activities of the vari- 
ous committees. Notice how the boy who wriggles like 
an eel during the prayer-meeting and pops up to give 
a ‘“ testimony ” and then pops down to stick a pin into 
his neighbor — with equal enthusiasm — shines in do- 
ing the chores of a social or in works of mercy for which 
one would suppose he would have no heart. He wants 
to be doing something. If I were going to have a 
caste called “‘ the active membership ” at all, I would 
have it consist of those who are active with their hands 
rather than with their tongues, an inner guild of those 
who will agree to take definite tasks and do them. 
The wiser Endeavor leaders are gathering up to them- 
selves the activities of the various straggling minor 
societies of the church and some of them are adding 
drills, athletics, camps, etc. The Endeavor hosts, 
“ the army of the daybreak,” have the enthusiasm, the 
confidence, the consecration and the opportunity to 
take hold of the boys, and do for them what no one 
else can do. Let the directors of the movement gradu- 
ally retire methods that are merely imitative of adults 
and that insist on iron conformities, and affiliate with 
themselves some of the other forms of work named in 
this chapter, and then the movement will furnish the 
leadership and the goal to a multitude of boys who

  need only the right touch to ripen them into Christian 
manhood. 
I give no special space here to. the Epworth League 
and the other societies, imitative of Christian En- 
deavor, since what I have said of one applies largely 
to all. 
rae Now to the Brotherhoods of St. An- 
Brotherhoods drew, and of Andrew and Philip. The 
strength of these brotherhoods is loy- 
alty. The gregarious spirit of boys has in it a great 
capacity for affection, as is seen in the strength of 
college secret societies among youths not out of the 
adolescent period. That spirit is beautiful and en- 
nobling. The church is an institution as worthy of 
passionate devotions and of “ team-work” as the 
college. The brotherhoods seize this romantic affection 
and fasten it. 
Mr. Hubert Carleton, the secretary of the Brother- 
hood of St. Andrew, believes that the very highest ap- 
_peal ought to be made toa boy. He has recently said: 
“Can the boy be won? Yes. The boy can be won, 
but not in the usual way in which the church is working 
at the problem to-day. The boy can be won by em- 
ploying his interests, his energies, his possibilities and 
his inspiration in behalf of God and God’s cause. The 
way to win the boy for the church is to teach him to 
work for the church. And by church work I do not 
mean What is commonly meant by church work. I do 
not mean to give the boy some petty tinkering around 
the church and allow him to call that church work or 
work for God. If you send your boy running messages 
for the rector, delivering notices, collecting books and 
96 
 
-P-A-G-E-97
  SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS 
  the like, and teach him to do nothing else, you have 
dwarfed the boy at the very beginning; and if you 
dwarf the boy you will never develop the man. The 
church is in this world to make people Christians who 
are not to-day Christians, and the boy must be taught 
by the church to take up his share in this work. In 
plain English, then, let me say that no boy can be a 
real Christian unless he is trying to make it easier for 
other boys who are not Christians to become Christians, 
or those who are Christians already to become better 
Christians. 
“The church is teaching the boy to-day a maimed 
religion, an imperfect religion, a religion with the heart 
left out of it. She is teaching him that it is his duty 
to live straight, but she is not teaching him that it is 
his equally necessary duty to help the other fellow to 
live straight. She is not teaching him that the first 
duty of every church boy is to make it easier for those 
who are not church boys to become church boys, and he 
is not therefore doing it. You cannot blame him be- 
cause he does not know, no one has ever told him, and 
the church is losing not only his own allegiance, because 
no boy will stay where his energies are not employed, 
but she is also losing all the boys who should be being 
won by him. John Wanamaker once said that when 
you convert a man you convert one person, but when 
you convert a boy you convert a multiplication table, 
and Wanamaker’s arithmetic is usually correct. 
“ The Brotherhood of St. Andrew is the only society 
which is to-day successful in this kind of work among 
boys. It puts aside altogether the amusement fea- 
tures, and everything which is supposed to attract boys. 
97 
 
-P-A-G-E-98
    THE BOY PROBLEM 
  It believes that the boy should be used, not amused, 
and it accordingly sets the boy at the hardest, highest 
and holiest work in all the world, that of living for 
other boys. All amusement features are debarred. 
The boy joins the junior department of the Brother- 
hood of St. Andrew, not for what he can get, but for 
what he can give, and there are, in this society to-day, 
thousands of the older boys of our church, boys of edu- 
cation, boys of influence, boys of leadership and boys of 
position who are being taught how impossible it is for 
them to be real Christians unless they are getting other 
boys to be Christians and are being shown how to 
put this into practical operation by being directed 
towards their friends and companions whom they 
can influence.’ 
The evangelizing of boys by other boys is the idea 
of the order, and the word ‘‘ Brotherhood ” expresses 
what every boy covets. I value the Brotherhoods 
very highly as opportunities afforded boys to develop 
their early Christian characters in each other’s fellow- 
ship under mature, manly leaders. Almost every 
men’s league in a church needs a boy branch to prevent 
it from becoming selfish. This adopting of the boys 
by the men in a church, in a godfatherly sense, is a 
magnificent mission. 
The most interesting church work 
that I know of anywhere among boys 
is that exhibited in an organization 
known as the Captains of Ten, originated and con- 
ducted by Miss A. B. Mackintire, of Dr. Alexander 
McKenzie’s church in Cambridge. We have here a 
successful boys’ club conducted by a woman. Here

  is a woman who, without fad or publicity, has worked 
out for fifteen years a plan which fits the best theories. 
The basis is hand-work. The Captains of Ten are boys 
from eight to fourteen, who are captains of their ten 
fingers. Cardboard work, weaving, whittling, sloyd, 
carving and other activities are followed by graded 
groups. Miss Mackintire is a trained sloyd worker and 
has a remarkable ingenuity and patience in originating 
elaborate and dignified annual entertainments by the 
boys, each of which is a surprise and wonder. The 
interest is missions, which are taught graphically, 
chiefly at the monthly business meeting. The boys 
learn to like to make generous gifts from the proceeds 
of their festivals and sales of handiwork for the benevo- 
lent causes which they know about and care for. At 
the entertainments the dramatic instinct is fully 
recognized and the constructive faculties are utilized 
in designing costumes and scenery. Loyalty and self- 
government are taught incidentally. The older boys 
become volunteer workers to help beginners, and are 
graduated into the Order of the Knights of King 
Arthur. A personality that has been devoted to boys 
with such earnestness and fidelity becomes a masterful 
influence on character. To walk down the room, on 
the walls of which are placed the photographs of the 
grouped Captains for successive years,— there have 
been over two hundred boys in all,— and see the growth 
in maturity thus visibly portrayed is an impressive 
vision. These boys seem to ripen into Christian life 
naturally, although they represent two quite different 
levels of society, and usually come into the church. 
There is no Junior Endeavor Society or other re-

  THE BOW’ PROBLEM   
ligious society for children here. This illustration 
suggests the power of broader methods wielded by 
sense and consecration to assist in the actual religious 
development of boyhood. 
Another plan which arouses much 
enthusiasm among boys from ten to 
fourteen is that of the Woodcraft In- 
dians, devised by Ernest Thompson Seton, the natu- 
ralist. It is an orderly endeavor to systematize and 
direct that fever for ‘“ playing Indian ” which has 
always been the delight of boys who have any access 
to the forest. It is the nobler side of the aboriginal 
nature that is imitated, the degrading vices being dis- 
couraged by such laws as “no smoking” and “ no 
fire-water in camp,” and by offering recognitions, 
called “ coups,” for clear sight, powers of observation, 
agility and marksmanship and deeds of heroism. The 
games are ingeniously arranged to afford a reasonable 
amount of hardship and to encourage the higher sports- 
manship, the contestants striving against time and 
space rather than against their fellows, the rewards be- 
ing so varied as to suit every boyish talent and being 
justly proportioned to real endeavor. The plan is 
elastic and may be turned to the loftiest uses. 
If the Woodcraft Indians is a method 
that corresponds to the savage period 
of boyhood, then the Order of the 
Knights of King Arthur, devised by the author, may 
well apply to the chivalric period that follows. It is 
based upon the romantic, hero-loving, play, construc- 
tive and imaginative instincts which ripen at about 
fourteen, but it has been found possible and desirable

to prepare the boys for the special features of the order 
by preliminary organization, as Captains of Ten or 
Wooderaft Indians, at about twelve. Its purpose is to 
bring back to the world, and especially to its youth, 
the spirit of chivalry, courtesy, deference to woman- 
hood, recognition of the noblesse oblige, and Christian 
daring, and ideal of that kingdom of knightliness 
which King Arthur promised he would bring back 
when he returns from Avalon. In this order he ap- 
pears again. Unlike many means of helping boys, 
this one does not claim to be complete in itself. It is 
only a skeleton organization, attracting instant pleas- 
ure, affording wholesome recreation and instruction 
and serving as the framework upon which to build in- 
strumentalities that may particularly fit local needs. 
It is formed upon the model of a college Greek-letter 
fraternity rather than upon that of a secret lodge, al- 
though it is believed that the satisfaction of the love 
of ritual, mystery and parade in this way in adolescence 
will often prevent the lodge-room craze which might 
later become extravagant and destructive of domestic 
felicity. It isnot secret. The boys when they gather 
for a “ conclave ”’ march into their hall and seat them- 
selves in a circle in imitation of the round table, with 
a King at the head, the Merlin or adult leader at his 
side, and the various functionaries of their “ Castle” 
in their places. In order to avoid jealousy there is 
constant rotation in office. Each boy bears the name 
of a hero, either an ancient knight or a modern man 
of noble life, and is known by that name in the castle 
and is supposed to be familiar with the history of the 
one for whom he is named and to emulate his virtues. 
101
-P-A-G-E-102
  THE BO Y PROBLEM 
  | \ 
The ritual is short but impressive. Its preparation and 
the arranging of the initiations, which embody the 
grades of page, esquire and knight, and which teach 
lessons important to boyhood, give room for the con- 
structive instinct in the making of regalia, banners, 
swords and spears, throne, etc. These initiations exer- 
cise the play-instinet without giving opportunity for 
physical violence. Hero-worship is developed by a 
roll of noble deeds, a castle album of portraits of heroes, 
the reading together of heroic books and the offering 
of ranks in “ the peerage” and the sacred honor of 
“the Siege Perilous” for athletic, scholarly or self- 
sacrificing attainments. These honors are arranged to 
harmonize with those offered in the Woodcraft Indians, 
so that the two organizations dovetail. Those which 
involve mere physical effort are rewards for whole- 
some emulation, while the recognition of actual heroism 
is conferred, not to the boaster, but by the spontaneous 
tribute of his fellows. The ranks of esquire and knight 
in the castle are planned to be occupied by those who 
shall voluntarily, after a term of probation, accept a 
simple, self-originated covenant of purity, temperance 
and reverence or enter the manliness of actual Christian 
confession by church membership. For definite ac- 
tivity and in satisfying the instinct for roaming and - 
adventure, ‘‘ quests ” are suggested in the way of walks 
to historic sites and cooperative deeds of kindness. 
The local Merlin is urged to develop the resources of the 
boys in his own way, as upon the manner in which he 
does this the life of the castle will ultimately depend. 
Almost everything can be clad in imagination with the 
knightly character. The summer camp will become

  the literal castle and its environs the country of the 
paynims, who are to be protected, not ravaged. The 
ball team will be the castle armed band and its vic- 
tories the occasion of mild ‘“ wassail.’’ The boys will 
often elaborate further rituals of their own, and patri- 
otism and missions can be taught under this disguise. 
Often the members show a touching tenderness toward 
a group of younger boys who are under instruction 
preparatory to being admitted, and refer in later days 
to their memories of the order with something of the 
same feeling that the graduate does to his college days. 
There is in some such approach to the best in the boy 
the possibility of great good. In a successful castle, 
loyalty, chivalry and service — the three watchwords 
of the order — are actually developed in very pleasing 
ways. The plan is thoroughly Christian and is more 
often found in churches than elsewhere, although 
adapted to a union group in the community. Its 
elasticity makes it popular to use with other formal 
agencies. Even reduced to its simplicity — the adop- 
tion of knightly names and ideals — it proves a power- 
ful force for uplifting a group of boys by a way that 
quietly and constantly appeals to their idealism and 
group spirit without trespassing upon their reserve or 
making them unduly introspective. It seems to have 
’ the unique quality that while in it religion is so un- 
obtrusive that it does not offend, it is so integral a 
part that it cannot be ignored. In Mr. Carleton’s 
description of the Brotherhood of St. Andrew we see 
as the ideal the boy membership of a church segregated 
into a brotherhood to win other boys who are outsiders. 
In the Knights of King Arthur the Christian boy is, as 
103 
 
-P-A-G-E-104
  THE BOY PROBLEM 
  in the rest of life, a part of a community of boys, in 
which there is no caste but character. 
The author may speak freely of certain minor ad- 
vantages of the plan, which are noted by President 
G. Stanley Hall, who regards it as “the best form of 
group-honor ” for boys, because these advantages came 
about incidentally and not from his own planning. 
“ The esoteric is a real basis for comradeship.” “ It 
permits the abandon of freedom in its yeasty stage, 
innocent rioting.” ‘The grades of initiation become 
symbolic of old ethnic initiations of pubescents or of 
putting off the old isolated self by regeneration into a 
larger social existence.” ‘In cultivating friendship 
intensely for a small circle, as gentlemen practising 
noblesse oblige, many youth would owe more to this 
circle than to curriculum and faculty.” 
The author has found in his own experience that 
under all, the idea of the Quest, as a partnership in the 
search for character, when conducted frankly and in 
mutual help by both adult leader and the boys, be- 
comes the permanent and valuable element of the 
fraternity. In no other way has he found that he 
could so naturally live the religious life with boys. 
The Boys’ Brigade has had consider- 
able vogue on both sides of the water. It 
usually, when first tried, brings together 
a large company of boys, and it offers the advantages 
of exercises that not only inculcate erectness and vigor 
but that assist humility, obedience and attention. The 
summer military camp is often a valuable feature and 
there is during the winter some opportunity for Bible 
drill, though there are difficulties in yoking it to the

  other more strenuous exercises. Where it is possible 
to get a drill-master. who is something more, and who 
will learn to see his boys as individuals, it has done 
good. The plan is not very elastic and, so rapidly ‘do 
boys outgrow any one form of organization, that many 
feel that the large expense of it is not always justified. 
There is an improvement of this last- 
named plan called the Boys’ Life Bri- 
gade, in which the drills are on a peace 
basis and are in the line of learning to save rather than 
to destroy life. Ambulance drill, first aid, rescuing 
from fire and drowning, are attractive features. 
The Sunday-school is the greatest 
‘eit hee educational institute of the church. De- 
spite the abundant criticisms with which 
it has been favored, the character of its leaders and 
membership, the authorization and labor which it has 
received, the large reach it has upon the childhood of 
every community and its genuine value and unique 
opportunity will cause it to continue to be the place 
where the church does the most of its teaching and 
puts forth its best work. 
The Sunday-school has three functions. First and 
chiefly, it is the agency, supplemental to the home, 
where children and young people are taught the 
Christian religion of love and service. Second, it is 
a place where older persons may study the higher 
problems of religious thought and duty. Third, 
it is the place where people are trained to teach re- 
ligion to others. These three functions suggest as 
the divisions of the Sunday-school, the primary and 
adolescent grades, the adult classes, the normal de-

partment. I shall speak almost entirely of the first 
division. 
Ideally, the Sunday-school for children is not a 
school at all. In an Edenic condition it is an extension 
of the home. It is a place where a wise and good man 
or woman gathers a group of young people to whom 
he is in the truest sense a god-parent in order to help 
and supplement the home in teaching the way of life 
and encouraging children to walk in it. There are, of 
course, pedagogic laws to be applied in Sunday-school 
instruction, but the aim should not be to imitate the 
public school. The model of the Sunday-school should 
be rather the social settlement classes and clubs, where 
the teacher and scholars are simply friends who meet 
because of interest in the same subject. The Sunday- 
school class is the proper unit for all the organized work 
of the church among young people. I look forward to 
the day when, instead of having a Sunday-school where 
agreat many children come for only an hour on Sun- 
day, and several forlorn Endeavor societies, mission 
bands and clubs of boys and girls which struggle to 
hold the interest of but a small fraction on week-days, 
each class or group of classes shall have its week-day 
session which shall be an authorized and fully attended 
meeting of the school. Here the secular mass-club idea 
of esprit de corps and the group-club intensive and 
personal work would both be exemplified. 
The first essential for an improved school is a trained 
superintendent. Behind even the homely group-class 
idea must be the man of ideal and knowledge. In the 
larger churches such men are being set apart to this 
as a life-work. There is a great demand in the smaller 
106
-P-A-G-E-107
  SOCIAL ORG ANT ZA TYPO NS 
  churches for ministers who are teachers as well as 
pastors. 
Then we must have good teachers. We naturally 
turn to our public schools. But President Hyde tells 
our public school teachers to treat one who would have 
them teach Sundays “ as a murderer who seeks your 
life.” Still, many of them do teach, and they are a 
blessing to our schools. The mid-week meeting of the 
church is to give more and more an opportunity for 
the pastor-teacher to confer with the laymen-teachers 
as to the principles and methods of Bible teaching. 
Fathers and mothers and other people who have re- 
tained their childhood may thus become competent 
and efficient teachers. 
Officers of the Y. M. C. A. express great confidence 
in the results of their experiments in Bible classes in 
which the teacher is eliminated. The pupil-teachers 
are boys of the same age as their classes, or a little 
older, who have been carefully drilled by an adult in a 
normal class. Their belief is that the absence of ser- 
monizing and the freedom from the dominance of an 
adult personality make for a healthy and expressive 
class life. The qualities of opinionativeness and fervor 
in a man which might weaken him as a teacher of 
unconverted boys might make him an excellent leader 
of a normal class of Christian boys, his force of character 
being their needed stimulus to consecrated endeavor. 
The success of this plan evidently depends on the 
‘excellence of this preparatory work. 
In regard to the system of instruction much progress 
may be expected, for much has already been secured. 
The ideal toward which we are steadily moving is a

graded set of classes and a permanent graded selection 
of material. One of the best complete graded school 
systems of which I know is that worked out in the 
Tabernacle school connected with Chicago Commons. 
In outline it is as follows: 
“The Graded Bible School. There are twelve grades 
in the Graded Bible School, corresponding to the 
grades in the public schools and covering the period 
from six to eighteen years in the scholar’s life. The 
school is divided into Primary, Junior and Senior de- 
partments, each including four grades. The Primary 
and Junior equal the period of grammar school and 
the Senior that of high school in our publie school 
system. In arranging the curriculum the aim has been 
to adapt the work: to the needs of the children and 
young people in the different periods of their develop- 
ment in accordance with the results of the best modern 
child-study, and also to cover the Bible material in a 
complete and orderly way. While the chief subject of 
study is the Bible, attention is paid to church history, 
missions, present-day problems in ethics. The course 
naturally falls into six divisions. The first two cover 
the receptive period in the child’s life, the work being 
confined to Bible truths and Bible stories, nature les- 
sons, object-lessons and the memorizing of Scripture 
passages. The next two divisions include the decision 
period in the child’s life. The work is in the New 
Testament, including a careful study of the Life of 
Christ, the Early Church and simple Christian teaching. 
In the fifth division the Old Testament is studied, and | 
in the sixth division, when the young person is in the 
reconstruction period of life, the aim is to inculcate

  Christian duties and meet the questionings and diffi- 
| culties which arise in the mind of a young person at 
this time.” : 
By the time a youth has reached eighteen years of 
age he ought, in a model curriculum, to have secured 
intellectually a consecutive historical knowledge of the 
religious history of that people whose genius was re- 
ligion, of the events of the life of Jesus with their sur- 
roundings, and of the origins of the Christian Church, 
with the developments of Christian history and Chris- 
tian missions that ensued. He ought also to know 
something of the order and purposes and meanings of 
the books of the Bible, so that he can read it with 
understanding, discrimination and delight. Ethically, 
he should have faced in turn the great moral situations 
as they were presented to the great characters of 
Scripture in turn, and should have formulated for him- 
self a scheme of life from the law, the prophets and the 
gospel. Spiritually, he should have been brought face 
to face with the Christ and have given allegiance to 
him and his kingdom. Socially, the pessimistic moods 
of youth should have been corrected by some study 
of social need and modern social progress. 
The next important thing is the way of instruction. 
Two vicious methods are now in vogue: the Lancastrian, 
or catechetical, and the homiletic. The first is obsolete 
in all other education. The second, confined to re- 
ligious instruction and old-fashioned school “ gram- 
mar ”’ work, is based on the idea that the Spirit of God 
and of common sense is so absent from the child that 
he will never see the good nor do it unless a moral is 
tagged to-every verse in the lesson. This method, that 
109

    Din i BOY PROBLEM te 
of the sermonette, may do in the adult Bible class, but 
it is useless in the junior classes. It is unfortunately 
perpetuated by most of the popular “ helps” pub- 
lished for teachers. 
It is the picturesque and vivid in biography that 
attracts attention from a boy. To him, life is moving, 
adventurous, highly colored. The reflective and the 
passive moods are not his. His mind is so alert and 
keenly sensitive to moral issues that he reaches them 
more quickly than his teacher does, and then awaits 
with surly suspicion and agonizing self-consciousness 
the clumsy and blunt way by which his preceptor 
“makes the application.” Religion to him is doing, 
not talking. He does not want to talk about it. He 
will not be talked to about it. 
The school of the future will give the little children 
story-talks on the heavenly Father in nature and provi- 
dence, and the child’s relation to him as illustrated 
by the childhood of Jesus and of other characters and 
by familiar objects and events. The mythologic, the 
sensuous, the dramatic and the egoistic will be recog- 
nized in the stories that follow, taken from the heroes, 
myths and miracles of the Bible and other literatures. 
In general, the Old Testament ideals and narratives will 
precede the New, but not invariably. 
The physical activities and some of the apparatus of 
the kindergarten will yield in their turn to the drill- 
work, the picture-and-composition methods and the 
variety familiar in the elementary school. Adolescence 
needs the life of Jesus and of other heroes studied as 
vitally as possible. One of the most real difficulties in 
the Sunday-school is the fact that to the boy the Bible 
110 
 
-P-A-G-E-111
  
  $0 CLA L « O-R GANT ZATIONS 
  is trite. It is hard to find a boy who does not know as 
much about the Bible as he wants to. In almost every 
other subject in education the element of surprise is 
one of the teacher’s chief aids. The Bible does have 
some surprises even for a cock-sure American boy, but 
they are not contained in the ordinary Sunday-school 
quarterly. 
Every available graphic and manual method of illus- 
tration and attraction will be pressed during those 
years when the laboratory method is central in their 
public school work and when children are so ready to 
leave the Sunday-school. At this time cooperative 
study and all the bonds of the gang spirit will be em- 
phasized to help the live, restless, fickle youths. 
My own experience with a class of twenty-six boys 
may be pertinent here. The work was first in the life 
of Christ, then in the Old Testament. 
The class approached the life of Jesus by a method 
as near as possible to that by which the German schools 
study the national heroes of Germany: the method of 
travel-study. By means of stereographs they made a 
journey to Palestine, following the events of Jesus’ life 
by journeys from place to place in which those events 
occurred. They made the easy transition from the 
work of the public school by means of their geogra- 
phies, atlases and the announcements of the tourist 
companies. 
At the beginning of an average lesson they were care- 
fully transferred from the scene and events of the last 
lesson to that of the present. They were shown by a 
specially keyed map where they were to stand, in the 
definite spot where the Master wrought at the time 
im

THE BO; PROBLEM 
  under study, and the exact territory over which they 
were to look. Then, as they visited this spot by 
means of the stereograph, they were shown just where 
_ the Master entered the scene, what he did there and 
whence he departed. 
They completed and connected their knowledge of 
these places and deeds by drawing sketch maps, by 
using a stereograph of the relief map of the Palestine 
Exploration Society, and by molding certain contours 
of territory with clay or paper-pulp. This connected 
knowledge they carried farther by records in small 
individual note-books and by novel reviews. 
Such instruction not only solves the problems of 
order, attention, interest and individual instruction, but 
it even encourages home work, which in Sunday-school 
has been pretty nearly unknown among boys for some 
time. The self-expression with the hands mentioned 
above is, much of it, prepared at home; topics for 
special report and short debates are worked up there, 
and even some optional work will be thus done by 
individuals. Instead of the study of short sections of 
Scripture in the class, long, consecutive sections are 
given out for home reading, which might be cut out and 
pasted in a note-book, making an illustrated gospel of 
a harmony. 
The fellowship instinct was utilized in making addi- 
tional reviews by having a “ class life of Christ,” to 
which each member contributed a chapter in turn, and 
by having a “ class log,” in which each in turn de- 
scribed the places where he had been. 
There need be no fear that such study is not “ spirit- 
ual.” Inattention and irreverence are surely un- 
112
-P-A-G-E-113
  SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS 
  spiritual. Such methods fit the boys, interest them, 
hold them, instruct them. The geographical and 
picturesque, as a matter of fact, become the vehicle of 
the spiritual. My own experience was that the stereo- 
scope itself was, unexpectedly, a powerful instrument 
for teaching the individual. Isolated behind his hood, 
looking as if from a dark room through a window into 
a strange world, his ears as alert as his eyes, each of 
my twenty-six boys received impressions that were 
deep, lasting, personal. I was teaching, not a class, . 
but twenty-six separate hearts. 
A method of study in which the picturesque has less 
attention, while the analysis of character has more, has 
been carefully worked out by the Rev. John L. Keedy 
(see Bibliography). Here “the pupils pass judgment 
upon each action, they approve or disapprove of each 
person. Admiration runs out into choice.”’ The note- 
book is constantly used and serious attention is de- 
manded to something which the boys recognize as 
worth while. While boys do come to Sunday-school 
usually with a blasé manner, their curiosity will respond 
if real and fresh information is actually presented. 
By and by the graphic methods yield to frank con- 
versation. The restlessness and doubts and moral 
cravings of the period require also a first-hand dealing 
with pressing ethical problems. Here, too, comes the 
pressure for spiritual decision. In later years the facts 
of Biblical criticism and the literature of the Bible 
become appropriate topics. 
I am inclined to prophesy an end to the lesson 
quarterlies, at least to the almanac style. The young 
children will carry home pictures and occasional illus- 
113
-P-A-G-E-114
  THE BOY PROBLEM 
  trative material, and will do some little handicraft or 
“laboratory” work. Those a little older will have 
lap-boards and pencils and paper and do some water- 
color or paper-pulp or whittling work, some of it out- 
side the class. The stereoscope and photographs will 
be used to make the land and its customs real, and 
sacred art will bring its own spiritual lessons. The 
young men and women will use note-books. If the 
quarterly departs, then the teacher’s manual will be 
magnified. Its “helps” will not be expository or 
homiletic, but they will consist in instruction to 
broaden and enlighten the mind of the teacher, which 
is the only way to get better teaching. 
As to the boys who at the age of greatest approach- 
ability are being lost to the school in greatest numbers, 
I think the courses should be shorter — say, three 
complete courses, each on a great life or topic, in a 
year. They should be undated, so that a lesson may 
be postponed if something more important — such as a 
matter of personal ethics or service — takes the hour. 
There should be for such classes a separate room, or at 
least a measure of seclusion. Variety and ingenuity 
of presenting the lesson and the desirability of allowing 
some orderly changes of position suggest this. This 
room should resemble a laboratory or a workshop in 
its equipment. 
The constant endeavor with boys must be to keep 
the point of contact in real life, in school, playground, 
current events, within reach. The novel methods sug- 
gested would be thought by some to make the getting 
of teachers harder, but it ought not to be so. Why 
should not people prepare each year for a twelve 
114
-P-A-G-E-115
  S- O7fC Than OR GAN-EZ A T TONS 
  weeks’ course, as a professor does for his laboratory 
course, who cannot teach all the year? The methods 
I propose make the question of order so simple that it 
often removes the terror of teaching boys. 
Very few classes of older boys can be held unless 
their “ gang-spirit ” is recognized by a week-day or- 
ganization. That organization may well be carried 
directly into the class, the president calling each 
session to order, the secretary reading brief minutes, 
the treasurer handling the offering and the marshal 
keeping order. This simplifies the routine and intro- 
duces the teacher in his proper relation to the class. 
I think teachers of such boys should plan, not for a 
yearly feed, but for a regular if only occasional group- 
club of their classes, separately or together. These 
will constitute the Boys’ Endeavor Society of the 
church. A teacher of genuine character, a teaching 
that neither skulks nor dodges and a generous class- 
life — these make the successful boys’ class. 
The school of week-day scope, for which I plead, 
must be a school of practise as well as instruction. 
The sessions themselves give room for some ethical 
applications. More than this, the school must stand 
for actual religious activity. It may be even-demoral- 
izing continually to impress moral principles and 
arouse noble emotions and offer no chance to exercise 
them. This is the chief reason why I urge that the 
week-day societies of the church be affiliated with the 
Sunday-school. It is not enough to give a missionary 
offering to a cause which no scholar may know much of 
anything about, and to which many have contributed 
nothing. The children must learn to do for others, 
115
-P-A-G-E-116
THE BOY PROBLEM 
  doing that really costs time and effort and skill. A 
school that furnishes manly teachers, frank, honest 
instruction, wholesome social fellowship and loving 
service for others will hold a boy even through his 
years of restlessness and doubt. 
The catechetical revival is attaining 
cE aan considerable recent prominence and is Nurture ; Hiontt tones 
Ctheces assuming some dignity on account of its 
antiquity. If the movement be one for 
doctrinal instruction, as it presumably is, in the Pres- 
byterian, Protestant Episcopal, Lutheran, Reformed 
and Methodist churches, which have catechisms pre- 
scribed by church law, we have, on the one hand, the 
opposition of the psychologists, as Prof. C. R. Hender- 
son of the University of Chicago, who says, “ I know 
no catechism which seems to me suitable for any 
person, young or old, to commit to memory”’; President 
G. Stanley Hall of Clark University, who says, ‘‘ The 
teacher should shun all catechetical methods, most of 
- all those that require yes or no for an answer, and next 
those that insist upon a form of words, which always 
tend to become a substitute for thought. Although 
catechisms may have their place, they are not for 
children”; Prof. H. C. King of Oberlin, who declares 
that ‘“ Christ’s own method, in bringing his disciples 
to the confession of his Messiahship, was one of punc- 
tilious avoidance of all dogmatic statements upon the 
matter”; Prof. George A. Coe, who, in his “ Spiritual 
Life’ quotes a young teacher as saying, ‘‘ Oh, why, 
why did my parents try to equip me with a doctrinal 
system in childhood? . . . When I began to doubt 
some points, I felt obliged to throw all overboard,” and 
116 
 
-P-A-G-E-117

  who adds himself: ‘ It is simply impossible to supply 
a child with real solutions of the problems of life. . . . 
We should include a great deal of religious activity, 
but very little religious theory. . . . What he wants 
most, after all, is room”; Sir Joshua Fitch, who 
says of them: “I attach small value to catechisms. 
We never employ them in teaching any other subject 
than religion. And the reasons are obvious. They 
are stereotyped questions and stereotyped answers. 
They leave no room for the play of intelligence upon 
and around the subject. They stand between the 
giver and receiver of knowledge, and do not help 
either of them much. . . . I appeal to your own ex- 
perience. Do you find that the fragmentary answers 
which you learned in the catechism help you much in 
your religious life? When I look back on the work 
of my religious instructors, do I find that I learned 
most from their formal lessons, or from the influence 
of their character and sympathy?”’ On the other 
hand, the theologians are not very encouraging, as 
witness Prof. W. N. Clarke, who approves the cate- 
chism theoretically, but succinctly suggests that “ at 
present there exists the deepest interest in Christian 
doctrine, but it takes the form of question rather than 
of answer.” Prof. A. W. Anthony remarks: “Alas! 
it has been only in religion that men have thought it 
needful to inquire into devotion by’ means of the 
catechism. . . . The personality of the Christ is far 
above all mere formule of religion and creed state- 
ments. It is to a person that Christianity has ever 
invited its followers.” 
Even the experiment of giving answers in Scripture 
117 
   
-P-A-G-E-118
  THE BiOry¥ PROBLEM   
language does not solve this difficulty, since there is no 
more supple and subtle form of theological bias than 
a proof text, while the plan of throwing upon the chil- 
dren the burden of framing answers upon which the 
theologians have failed to agree is still less satisfactory. 
Many of the new manuals omit answers and some 
omit questions, many drop the word catechism, and 
close inquiry shows that to the pastor-teacher the 
manual is simply the solution book, like what the 
school-teacher surreptitiously used when teaching 
Wentworth’s “Geometry,” while personality and free 
fellowship between teacher and pupils are really every- 
thing. There are at least four dangers which might 
beset a person who was a mere imitator and used the 
manual of another. One danger is that we forget that 
while early adolescence, say the age of twelve, is the 
right time to be looking after the child, his age for 
formulating systems does not come for five or six 
years later. Parents are nearer the right age for a 
catechism than are their children. It would do some 
of them good. Another danger is that we should expect 
to be able to teach life out of a booklet as we teach 
the exact sciences and the dead languages. The lab- 
oratory method and not the recitation method, learn- 
ing by doing, is needed. A third danger is that in 
emphasizing memory, which we may properly do since 
the school neglects that faculty, we teach proof texts, 
the dried figs of theology, instead of the great inspiring 
passages of truth and faith. A ready-made answer 
paralyzes, not stimulates, the mind. The last danger 
is to find thus the point of contact. Here is a bound- 
ing, bursting boy, with his heroisms and enthusiasms, 
11g
-P-A-G-E-119
  SOCTAL ORGANIZATIONS 
and a new sexual, social and moral nature that almost 
overpowers him, full of moods, doubts and obstinacies. 
Does the quiet, logical, sweetly reasonable catechetical 
method really come to where that boy lives and find 
him at home? 
In the Episcopal Church, where the method is not a 
recent experiment or a thing by itself, most of these 
objections are met because of its place in a larger 
system. It is but one wheel of an ecclesiastical ma- 
chine. The baptized child is accepted as a member 
of the ecclesiastical family, potentially regenerate; the 
catechism is not a matter of special class instruction, 
but it is taught in the Sunday-school; it is the tradition, 
and so the expectation that the child will come for- 
ward in adolescence to prove his knowledge of the 
catechism in the confirmation class; instead of waiting 
for a cataclysmal conversion and a Christian experience 
before admitting the child into full communion, the 
child is admitted upon attaining a fitting age and 
reasonable knowledge of the catechism, and it is be- 
lieved that in the solemn interim between confirmation 
and the first communion, in the activities that follow 
or in the fold of the church with maturing character, 
spiritual life will actually appear. As far as the in- 
fluence of this plan can be thrown about children, what 
could be more admirably planned to secure a quiet, 
normal Christian development and a minimum of loss 
of children in their growth from one period to another 
of life? 
In the non-liturgical churches there must be some 
theory and scheme of the relation of children to the 
church which shall make it natural and expected that 
119
-P-A-G-E-120
    THE BOY PROBLEM 
  children should enter full communion. At present the 
theory, if there be one, sometimes seems to be that it is 
not natural but is rather surprising if this takes place. 
In some such churches children who have been bap- 
tized or christened in infancy are enrolled as infant 
members, brought at a certain age for instruction and 
then asked practically, not, ‘‘ Will you come into the 
church?” but, ‘“‘ Must you go out of the church? ” 
In many churches, principally I think where the 
children are largely those of church-members, tactful 
pastors form annually these classes which they in- 
struct in the Christian way, the use of the Bible, 
prayer and service, solving doubts and encouraging 
good ideals and practical living, and as the result they 
bring almost the entire company each season into 
membership. 
The church has other means of help- Other s é Methods ing boys which are not everywhere rec- 
ognized. The church service itself, the 
boy choir, the liturgy where it is used, the sacraments, 
are employed with wonderful power in the Roman 
and Episcopal churches as an appeal to the imaginative 
and dramatic instincts. They may rightly be so used 
in other communions. Preaching to children, espe- 
cially to adolescents, is the most beautiful art and the 
most rewarding task of the Christian minister. The 
spectacle of a church full of adults, who have passed 
the era of a crisis and most of whom have been con- 
verted, engaging the efforts of a preacher is one of the 
most unsatisfying sights on earth. It is a mistake to 
think one has to “ preach down to ” adolescents. The 
most virile, noble and splendid truth is the best food 
120 
 
-P-A-G-E-121
  
  MgSOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS 
  for them. The emphasis upon Sunday-school attend- 
ance as a substitute for children is most unfortunate, 
since so many children leave the Sunday-school at the 
age of greatest danger, and, having never formed the 
habit of church attendance, pass from all church in- 
fluence. My own experience is that if we give the 
children something to come for, and encourage their 
presence by simple rewards and attentions, we can 
secure and sustain the habit. In my own church, one 
year, forty-nine received such rewards, of whom 
twenty-two were boys. In response to many inquiries 
as to the method, I will say that the annual recognition 
which I gave to all the children who cared to try for it 
was only a simple diploma with a five-cent Perry picture 
on the back. To encourage such attendance among 
children just beginning to form the habit I required 
attendance only for a quarter at a time. They were 
given cards dated for each Sunday with a space for 
the text, which were punched as they entered the 
church. Those who reached a certain standard be- 
came the pastor’s guests for an evening at the close of 
the quarter. 
The revival appeals especially to 
adolescence. It satisfies the emotional 
nature. It is a simple appeal to the heart. Take 
away the late hours, the long services, the untrained 
and fanatic exhorters — features which are incidental 
— and reduce it to a “ children’s crusade,” in which 
the social and emotional element is retained, where the 
ideal of the heroic and loving Christ and his grand and 
strenuous service are held up by the pastor or a wise 
specialist with children, and we have an instrument of 
121 The Revival

THE Bory PROBLEM   
historic dignity and perpetual value. The danger is 
the forcing of the nature before it has come to its day 
of choice and the neglect to follow up the decision by 
careful training. 
A plan which is being very strongly 
pressed in Sunday-school circles is that 
of Decision Day, a set day for securing or registering 
decisions of the adolescent children to follow Christ. 
A desire for “ results,” natural and often proper, seeks 
definite harvests after a long season of toil. The ap- 
pointing of a State Decision Day and tabulating the 
totals from the day smacks, however, of loving chil- 
dren statistically. A person wonders if year-books did 
not exist if the plan would ever have been thought of. 
The ease with which great numbers are secured starts 
the natural inquiry whether this is not another “ short 
cut ” which will prove disappointing in the end. Does 
this new method, which works so uniformly that it 
ought almost to be patented, produce other than 
mechanical “ results ”’? 
I tried the plan very carefully for three consecutive 
years and have sought earnestly to learn in my own 
and other fields what is the real outcome. The method 
used at its best seems to me to be this: The aim is not 
to get great accessions to the church, but to give to 
those who are passing through the psychical crisis the 
gentle shock that shall discover the child-soul to itself 
and help it into the Kingdom. The time to try the 
plan is just when this shock seems needed, and not in 
order to ‘‘ swing into line ’’ nor to be simultaneous with 
anybody else. It may be done yearly or once in three 
years or twice a year, according to the spiritual at- 
122 Decision Day

  mosphere. The plan should not be announced to the 
scholars much beforehand, but should be carefully 
prepared for with the teachers and parents. The 
present purpose is to secure the quiet committal of a 
group of scholars to Christ with the immediate enrol- 
ment of them in a pastor’s class. In some schools the 
call is so framed as to secure a statement of the re- 
ligious attitude of every member of the school, thus 
making a complete religious census. Usually, however, 
the plan involves a card to be signed, stating a purpose; 
for example, “ to live the Christian life of love and 
service.” I used a card to be signed in duplicate and 
witnessed by the parent, one half being retained by the 
child and half by the pastor. I also required, to avoid 
thoughtless action, that the signing be done at home 
and in ink. The best way to secure wise signing is to 
make the teachers evangelists in their own little par- 
ishes. The wholesale signing or refusing to sign by a 
class is a symptom so common that it was what first 
led me to discount the method. 
The way the plan works is this: A startlingly 
large number always sign, invariably nearly a third. 
Children like to sign papers. It is a disease nowadays. 
Many adults have it. The first occasion is always im- 
pressive. The minister probably sends word the fol- 
lowing Monday to his denominational weekly that he has 
seventy-five ‘‘converts.” He has no such thing. What 
he really has is hard to state. Sometimes a good many 
join the pastor’s class; oftener, I think, but few. The 
church roll is not materially affected unless these are very 
carelessly rushed into the church. In one warmly evan- 
gelistic church, two years ago, one hundred and fifteen 
123
-P-A-G-E-124
  THE BO;Y PROBLEM 
  cards were signed. Of these, twenty have since joined 
the church. In another, out of one hundred and thirty- 
one there are thirty-six. These “ results” convince 
me that the numbers should never be announced. 
It would be a mistake to suppose, on the other hand, 
that nothing has been accomplished. The majority 
mean what they say. The Endeavor Society shows the 
impulse at once. Some clear cases of new moral motive 
are seen. This advantage is seen at once: A large 
number, among them some hitherto unsuspected of 
religious feeling, make a committal which opens the 
way for personal conversation. Some other facts are 
noteworthy. Parents are apt to be incredulous of the 
plan. They think their child “ is not quite ready yet.” 
This may betoken ignorance or an instinctive protection 
of a sensitive, immature soul from rough hands. The 
second and third trials are not as impressive or fruitful 
as the first. 
The important ones to regard are really not those 
who sign but those who refrain. What of them? 
There are certain temperaments who refuse to express 
themselves. They may be obstinate or timid. This 
is true: Boys and girls will sign freely up to a certain 
year — about fourteen — and then they will abruptly 
drop off. After eighteen or so the signing is resumed. 
Those seem to be the years of reserve. Then there is 
the leakage, the waste, the possible alienation. When one 
hundred and fifteen signed, over three hundred refused 
to sign. Is it not possible that these three hundred 
believe that they have thus disowned Christ? It 
seemed a daring act, but the heavens did not fall 
nor the lightning strike; next year it becomes easier 
124
-P-A-G-E-125
    
SOCIAL OR GAN 1 2A TE ONS 
to refrain. Is it wholesome thus to lead young souls 
up to the great alternative and let the will fail, and 
do it year after year? One pastor avoids this by 
providing no cards and making the call only a great 
welcome. Others carefully explain that it is hoped and 
believed that all desire to belong to Christ and that 
the day is simply the opportunity for those who are 
ready to make the gift (the Easter gift, if it is that 
season) of themselves to God. 
I trust that this discussion will lead to thoughtful 
study as to whether the plan is applicable in each one’s 
own place, for that is the real criterion. Let the values 
be balanced, the conditions studied, the way life really 
grows be traced, the plan used with care, if at all, and 
the returns made simply a guidance to loving personal 
work. ) 
Since the earlier editions of this 
book were written an organization has 
sprung up, in England and America and also through- 
out the civilized world, enrolling hundreds of thou- 
sands of boys in and out of churches, known as 
the Boy Scouts. The basis of the movement is no 
doubt in Mr. Seton’s ‘‘ Woodcraft Indians,” in the 
principle of self-competition, the ideals of self-reliance 
and initiative and the exaltation of some of the so- 
called military virtues. It is a wholesome effort to 
take boys who live amidst city conditions and have lost 
some of their instincts for outdoor life back to the 
woods and the campfire, to develop resource in emer- 
gencies, to make them hardy and agile, to give them 
something better than the hysterical watching of 
athletic sports in which other people compete, and to

  THE BOY PROBLEM 
  restore to them the nobility of individual prowess and 
unrecompensed service for others. It gives its honors 
by scientific tests. While the original movement was 
not religious, in the sense of being sectarian, yet each 
religious organization can add requirements of its own 
and adapt it to local conditions. The officers of the 
movement are meeting the perils of its too sudden 
popularity by demanding higher requirements for 
scout leaders and endeavoring to supervise more 
closely the activities of the local troops. The plan 
is suited for boys from about eleven to fourteen 
years of age.

  THE BzOny PROBLEM 
  
Vv 
SOME SUGGESTIONS AS TO HOW TO HELP 
BOYS 
Summary Tue purpose of this chapter is to 
of Preceding describe some of the tools of influence 
Chapters which individuals and institutions may 
use in helping boys socially. 
The preceding chapters may be summarized in the 
following statement of principles for work with boys: 
1. Importance of the Period. The last nascencies of 
the instincts, the completion of the habits, the psychical 
crisis, the infancy of the will, the birth of the social 
nature, the disparity between the passions and appe- 
tites and the judgment and self-control, and the fact 
that, for normal and abnormal boys alike, this is the 
close of the plastic age, make this the most critical 
period of life, and one which should converge upon 
itself the wisest and strongest social and moral influ- 
ences. 
2. Necessity of Study of Adolescence. The change- 
ableness, secretiveness and infinite variety of boys at 
this period make necessary not only a study of the 
generalizations of psychology, but an intimate knowl- 
edge of the antecedents, surroundings and influences of 
each boy who is under care and guidance. 
3. What Boys Like. Social companionship of neigh- 
borhood groups of boys of their own age, chiefly for 
physical activities. ; 
130
-P-A-G-E-131
  SOME SUGGESTIONS 
  4. What Boys Need. Nutrition, exercise, whole- 
some environment, guarded organization, arousement 
of self-activity, teaching by interest, will-training by 
self-originative muscular activity and handiwork, some- 
thing to love, something to know, something to do 
constantly, ‘“ religion of a physical nature if that is 
possible.” Ags to organization, the esprit de corps of 
numbers, but the personal dealing with smaller groups, 
where possible. As to teaching, keeping a little in 
advance of the boy, without becoming unnatural. 
The chief requirements of the leader: powers of obser- 
vation, collation and reasoning, persistence, firmness, 
justice, self-mastery and self-adjustment, large-minded- 
ness and large-heartedness and, above all, childlikeness. 
These statements lead to an inquiry as to the in- 
strumentalities at our service. 
The greatest means of helping the boy 
is the Home. I have not emphasized 
this because we have been talking-of other things. 
But the one thing that discourages the social worker 
for boys is the recognition that the divinely appointed 
institution, which has the most of the boy’s time, 
interest and loyalty and every needed inspiration and 
appliance for his nurture, is untrue to_its_ duty, and 
that nothing else can possibly take its place. ‘Tt is the 
personality of the mother that originates in the child 
the earliest and the most permanent ideas of God. 
When a boy arrives at adolescence he turns from his 
mother to his father. That law-giving deity of the 
early years is now a peer, a companion and a sympa- 
thizer. The boyhood of the father is the hero of the 
son. It is almost impossible, as it seems ungracious, 
131 
(Zo ook ce 7 8 The Home 
   
-P-A-G-E-132
    T HE BOY, PROBLEM 
  
to provide substitutes for the ethical teaching and 
practise of the home. “ In Sparta when a boy com- 
mitted a crime his father was punished.” The in- 
fluences that disrupt the home and prevent its members 
from ever being together are most dangerous, not in 
their influence upon the parents, but upon the child. 
Tt is the evening lamp that is home’s lighthouse. A 
home without a good eventime is a home without hope, 
and the way a boy’s day ends at home is a prophecy 
' of the way his life will end. The hour after sunset is 
the Sabbath of the day. It seems, too, as if the very 
years of crisis were those most neglected. Many 
parents to-day are like cuckoos, willing to leave their 
young in anybody else’s nest. Prof. F. G. Peabody has ee 
  pointed out that the modern boarding-school and 
summer-camp system for well-to-do boys is really a 
“ placing-out system,” analogous to that applied to 
poor orphan and neglected children. Especially do 
parents seem willing to trust their religious nurture to 
those who may be willing to take up the task of saving 
other people’s children. 
While it is doubtful whether any home can fully 
express all of a boy’s vitality and interests beyond a 
certain age, many boys could be carried through the 
age of unrest without resort to outside agencies. When 
the “gang” spirit appears, the parent can cooperate 
with it, rather than obstruct it. Jacob Riis tells how 
his wife met such a case of apparently dangerous 
conniving: 
“My wife discovered the conspiracy, and, - with 
woman’s wit, defeated it by joining the gang. She 
‘ gave in wood ’ to the election bonfires, and pulled the 
132

SOME SUGGES TIONS 
  safety-valve upon all the other plots by entering into 
the true spirit of them, — which was adventure rather 
than mischief, — and so keeping them within safe 
lines. She was elected an honorary member, and be- 
came the counsellor of the gang in all their little scrapes. 
I can yet see her dear brow wrinkled in the study of 
some knotty gang problem which we discussed when 
the boys had been long asleep. They did not dream 
of it, and the village never knew what small tragedies 
it escaped, nor who it was that so skilfully averted 
them.” 
The happiest memory of my own boyhood — in a 
place where the neighborhood spirit was yet warm — 
was of the weekly evening gatherings in the various 
homes in turn, with the elders conversing at one end 
of the room and we youngsters playing games and act- 
ing plays and charades at the other. I do not remem- 
ber that any of us ever cared to be anywhere else at 
night. No doubt the boys’ club that meets in a home 
attic or kitchen is the best type in the world. The 
curfew ordinance has at least the advantage of making 
it necessary for the parent to keep the child in the home 
evenings. 
Next to the evenings, Sundays are the times of the 
greatest opportunity in the home. I know how hard 
it is to abbreviate the afternoon nap for the sake of 
__the boy, but it is better to_awake_at.som ort 
_now than to be kept awake by a anxiety late later. 
is in many a home the only « opportunity ever open for 
what I conceive to be essential to an adolescent boy, 
a walk with his father alone. The Junior Endeavor 
movement has kindly taken the burden of Sunday 
133

  THE B-OnY PROBLEM 
afternoon from many a parent, and has thereby done 
a wrong to nature, to the home, to the Sabbath and to 
both parent and child. The dumping of children into 
Sunday-schools that their parents may go off Sundays 
is heathenish and abominable. It is also a question 
how far any outsider has the right to encourage 
religious feeling in a child without the knowledge of 
its parents. 
If the period of habit-making has been passed wisely 
in a simple, consistent, pious home life, the period of 
will-training will present fewer difficulties. I cannot 
emphasize too much in the matter of will-training the 
advantages of the country home. The good will is 
there more easily fostered because the boy is from the 
start an active member of the firm. City households 
that are able to emigrate bodily to the country solve 
half the difficulties of restless childhood and store up 
material for winter nourishment and exercise. The 
country week and the vacation school and the summer 
camp do the same thing in a lesser degree. 
With all the space I have given to the description of 
social agencies I am in heartiest agreement with the 
Rev. Parris T. Farwell, when, speaking of church 
organizations ‘for Weridrcn, he says: “ We need to-day, 
not more work in the church for children, more infant 
classes, catechetical classes and Junior Endeavor so- 
cieties, but more work for the homes of our people. 
We need a deeper, holier, sublimer conception of the 
family, its cree duties and opportunities. We 
need more faithful parents. In this respect we are 
growing worse » rather than better. And it is to be 
feared that our church organizations for children are 
134
-P-A-G-E-135
  SOME SUGGESTIONS 
helping this downward movement. More and more 
the home is handing over its function as a school for 
the child to outside institutions which are absolutely 
incapable of doing the work as it should be. done. 
These institutions are better than none for children 
who come from unchristian homes, but they never can 
fill the place which the father and mother should fill 
in training their children for Christ. I know of no 
weightier problem for the church to solve than that of — 
restoring to the home, in the face of the materialism 
of the age and the industrial system under which we 
live, the religious life which belongs to the home and 
which alone can keep it sacred. This I consider to be 
the indispensable factor in true preparation of children 
for Christ’s service. Other things which we are under- 
taking and which it is wise to undertake are make- 
shifts, taking the place which does not belong to them.” 
Next to the home we must place instrumentalities 
that are homelike. Celia Thaxter told of 
“ The gracious hollow that God made 
In every human shoulder, where he meant 
Some tired heart for comfort should be laid.” 
God destined some people to be parents. The rest 
he left for god-parents. That old chrismal idea needs 
to be revived. Many an empty heart could be filled 
with lad’s-love. There are great houses which are silent 
that could be made musical with wondering children; 
and unsatisfied, cultured lives that could be poured out 
in no finer crusade than to give a few boys a place that 
has the home touch once or twice a week. Some Sun- 
day-school teachers have thus brought the school into 
135 
 
-P-A-G-E-136
  THE BOY PROBLEM   
that contact with life whose lack we mourned in our 
last chapter. Many a young college graduate has done 
the same. Among the well-planned ways of aiding 
poorer children and helping their homes at the same 
time I think the best is the Home Library System, with 
its circulating game and picture adjuncts. 
Next we have the Public School. The 
increasing proportion of crime in Amer- 
ica, the exposure of financial corruption, 
the alarming spread of mammonism or money-grub- 
bing and wasteful luxury, the recent study of the 
prevalence of juvenile misdeeds, have aroused much 
discussion as to the function of the school in the moral 
education of the citizenship of the future. The fact 
that the schools have all our children for more hours 
a day than their parents do, and the fact that the 
schools have great opportunities for moral education, 
suggest that perhaps they could do more than they are 
now doing to affect the morality of the nation. It is 
the belief of many that the real battle for honor and 
“@oniscience is to be fought in the schools and not in the 
churches. eT 
For the sake of those who are not familiar with 
public school work to-day it may be worth while to 
enumerate some of the character-making influences 
that the modern school is emphasizing. Among them 
are: the beauty of the building and_its_surroundings, 
the care of the growing plants by the scholars and the 
supervision of the play hour by the teachers, in many 
states the reading of the Bible without comment, in all 
states the singing of songs of worship and the salute 
to the > flag, celebration of patriotic days and the birth.

  days of heroes. The new curriculum, with all its «fads 
and frills,” “makes more distinctly for character than 
did the old one. 
Manual training, physical training, literature, science 
and nature study are especially valuable. In pursuing 
such’ studies, the spirit of wonder, reverence and 
humility, the love of accuracy and truth, enthusiasm, 
honor and self-mastery are inculeated. ‘‘ Every school 
subject and every personal relation,” says Dr. Hervey, 
“ has its roots in infinity.” School discipline is becom- 
ing more and more self-discipline and the school fel- 
lowship in study and play (the modern high school 
secret fraternity excepted) makes for fine group work 
and a generous social spirit. In many schools, as is 
directly urged in the schools of New York City, the 
children are urged first “ to put themselves in their 
own places,” i.¢., to develop the personal imagination 
to foresee the results of their own conduct, and then 
“to put themselves in the place of others,” 7. ¢., to 
develop the social imagination and try to think for and 
serve each other. In most schools the type of ethical 
teaching is much loftier than that of the street and 
indeed of many homes. The heroes exalted are the 
poets, the seers and those who lived or died for others. 
The emphasis on success is that to succeed is to succeed 
inside. The obedience urged is when “ a moral man,” 
as Dr. Hervey says, “ obeys himself.”’ The teaching 
is also more wise than in the Sunday-school, for it is 
done not by sermonizing, but by making each child 
discover moral truth for himself. 
As to the desirability of direct and formal teaching 
in morals there is among educators a decided difference 
137 
 
-P-A-G-E-138
  THE BON (PROB LD M 
  of opinion. Some believe character cannot be learned 
out of a book and that ethical text-books actually 
create a perversity for evil. Others think that a sub- 
ject that has no place in the curriculum, which has no 
time set or allowed for it, no test for a guide and no 
methods of teaching prescribed, will as certainly drop 
out of sight and force as would geography if it were 
treated in the same way. As a matter of fact, most 
teachers, whatever their theories, do actually teach a 
good deal directly about personal cleanliness and self- 
respect, do “ in season, out of season, reprove, rebuke, 
exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine ” concerning 
the common duties and virtues of the home, the street 
and the school, give some instruction in etiquette and 
temperance, and do all this with some regard for peda- 
gogic method. Some would go further and, with Mr. 
Bigg, ask for an “ethnic Bible,” a collection, as Dr. 
G. Stanley Hall urges, of biographical illustrations of 
all the great human virtues. 
It is a commonplace to say that the teacher is the 
greatest moral force in the school. Many feel that the 
strongest incentive toward keeping the schools out of 
politics is to elect school boards which shall make the 
character of teachers the corner-stone of the school 
system. From the standpoint of the needs of adoles- 
cent boys there is considerable cause for alarm because 
the lure of commercial success and the competition of 
women have produced a feminization and lowering of 
the masculine quality of the teaching profession. The 
danger is that our boys shall be taught, as Supt. Walter 
H. Small suggests, only “‘ by young girls and weak men.” 
A wise word needs to be said, which I cannot say, 
138
-P-A-G-E-139
  SOME SUGGESTIONS 
  about the relation of the home to the school. The old 
method was that the mother would “ visit school ” and 
then invite the teacher to tea. That sylvan ideal still 
has, it seems to me, its validity. The mother and 
father ought to know the person who has most of their 
boy’s work time and who probably knows him better 
than they do. School visiting in school hours, how- 
ever, is of doubtful value. The mother will very likely 
find herself only bewildered by the glimpse she gets of 
“the new education,” and it is certainly tactless at 
least to attempt to interrupt the work of forty to 
“talk to teacher about Johnnie.” Forty invitations 
to tea would also be quite an ordeal to any teacher, 
though one is as many as most teachers get. An inter- 
view immediately after school in the school-room be- 
tween teacher and parent is probably the best arrange- 
ment, and is one that is usually profitable not only to 
these two parties, but also to the subject under dis- 
cussion. 
The school and the teacher must not be blamed for 
everything. Let the school be as noble and earnest 
as it may, and outside the school still exist poor homes, 
the temptations of the street, public disorder, bad 
associates, vile literature and a public sentiment which, 
whether expressed in literature or life, is neither re- 
liable nor uniformly uplifting. Then, too, the children 
whom the schools turn out are not finished and stable 
characters. They leave school at the time that is 
most critical morally in their lives. The school ought 
to endeavor to arm them for the battle, but it cannot 
aid them further i in the struggle or ‘be > wholly responsible 
for the result. 4 
139
-P-A-G-E-140
  THE Bi Ory PROBLEM 
  
Some recent evidences of the way the public school 
is invading personal and home life are suggesting that 
the life of the community, both social and moral, is to 
center more and more in the schoolhouse. We already 
have “‘ home work,” reception days to parents, parents’ 
conferences, school dances and excursions. Now ef- 
forts are making to use schoolhouses in great cities for 
workingmen’s clubs, as they are already being opened 
in New York City for clubs for street boys. Baths in 
schoolhouses are sometimes opened to adults outside 
school hours. The opening of branch public libraries 
in public parks, and the building of municipal baths, 
recreation halls and shelters are further extensions of 
the municipality into the domestic and social life of the 
people. 
There remain to be mentioned some tools of char- 
acter-building that have not the dignity of being dis- 
tinct institutions. 
In my first chapter I made strong 
emphasis upon the place of play in 
child-life. I even intimated that it was 
what childhood was made for. This was the idea of 
Groos who said that it is not true that animals and 
children play because they are young; they are young 
because they need to play. Jean Paul said: “ Play is 
the first poetry of the human being.” ‘“ The essence of 
play,” says Hamilton Wright Mabie, “ is the conscious 
overflow of life that escapes in perfect. self-forgetful- 
ness.” Another says that “ play is joyous because it 
satisfies the highest function of which the child is 
capable.” A different statement of the same thought 
is made by John M. Pierce when he says, “‘ What gives 
140 Games 
and Play 
 
-P-A-G-E-141
    
SOME SUGGESTIONS 
  zest to a game is the story in it.” This relation of the 
imagination to the physical expenditures is so close 
that it is not a joke but an actual fact that a boy be- 
comes more tired sawing wood than in the much more 
violent exercise of playing ball. Naturally, the im- 
portance of play in education is being studied. It is 
remembered that the Greeks made the games and play 
of their children an integral part of their education. It 
is remembered that a thousand years ago our Norse 
ancestors taught every child of noble birth to do eight 
things: to ride, to swim, to steer, to skate, to throw the 
javelin,to play chess, to play the harp, to compose verses. 
“The English know how to turn out an efficient 
man,” says De Garmo, “ by combining fifteenth cen- 
tury instruction with modern play.” Dr. D. G. 
Brinton is thus led to say: ‘‘ The measure of value. of 
work is the amount of play there is in it, and the 
measure of value of play is the amount of work there 
is in it.’ 
Mr. George F. Johnson is the one who has made the 
most careful study of and practise with play in educa- 
tion. He urges that ‘for school children should be 
chosen, as*far as possible, the games which are based 
on instinctive tendencies. On the hunting instinct 
may be based games of chase, games of searching or 
hunting, games of hurling or throwing; on the fighting 
instinct, games of contest, as wrestling, boxing, trials 
of strength; on emulation, as jumping, racing, trials of 
skill; on curiosity, parlor magic, riddles; on sociability, 
the social games; on acquisitiveness, collections; on 
constructiveness, wood-work, sewing, making toys, 
doll-dresses; on the caring instinct, dolls, pets.”

“1. To stimulate a_healthy play interest_and edu- 
cate it. 
“2. To play games adapted to exercise certain 
faculties-of-the-mind-and-body. 
“ 3. To teach games’which may be played at home.” 
On page 150 I describe Professor Burr’s plan for 
coordinating stories with play. 
De Garmo would also urge as of equal importance the 
subordinating for the high school boys of the college 
type of play, which admits of but small teams of picked 
players, and adopting or adapting those English types 
that give every boy a chance. 
While it is a matter of experience that games teach- 
ing observation, memory, attention and furnishing 
physical activity are quite numerous, active indoor 
social games which can engage a large social group are 
also very few. He would be a benefactor to childhood 
who would present even one good one. This is espe- 
cially true of games enjoyable by older boys and girls. 
The gymnasium is instantly attract- 
ive toa boy. He sees in the ropes and 
bars and chest weights the vision of himself as an 
athlete and a victor. I do not think the gymnasium 
as mere physical exercise appeals to many boys. It 
gives them nothing to anticipate or to remember. I 
think it is to the combative and emulative nature that 
it appeals. This is seen in the way basket-ball is 
dominating our Y. M. C. A. gymnasiums. For these 
reasons the gymnasium should be controlled by the 
play-interest. And as it is this interest that dominates, 
those boy leaders who have no gymnasium can get

along without it if the play-interest in physical direc- 
tions can get some exercise. 
i This is the reason why hand-training is 
punen aerate commended. It gives the boy more than the 
gymnasium; it appeals to more instincts. The trained 
hand opens the door of shop and laboratory. It not only 
is the chief means of will-training, but it leads to the dis- 
covery of adaptabilities of life, it opens the way to specific 
usefulness, it solves the question of the life tendencies, 
it develops the expressing man, and the interest it excites 
leaves no room for crime, self-indulgence or mischief. 
Wood-work would naturally suggest itself as the 
easiest and least expensive form of handiwork, as well 
as the most varied in result. Elaborate equipment or 
salaried teachers are not indispensable. It is very easy 
to let the hobby of utilitarianism and the desire to 
make pretty things to photograph for the annual report 
run away with the handiwork method. The purpose 
should be, I take it, not to make artisans but manhood, 
not hand-agility but will-power. For this purpose I 
_ know nothing better than to plan some cooperative 
task, such as the beautiful achievement of Miss Mack- 
intire’s ‘‘ Captains ” in making an “ Inasmuch ” motto 
for the Labrador hospital, or an entertainment, like 
“ Hiawatha,” for which weapons and costumes shall be 
contrived by the boys themselves. What is done 
should be worth doing and be well done. This faculty 
for mechanical and individual efficiency has been 
almost lost to-day in the differentiation of labor. 
“A bone in a boy’s mind,” says 
George Meredith, “for him to gnaw and 
worry corrects the vagrancies and promotes the

  healthy activities, whether there be marrow in it or 
not.” 
Dr. G. Stanley Hall found, some years ago, that of 
two hundred and twenty-nine Boston schoolboys only 
nineteen had no collections. A recent study of 
children’s collecting shows that the fever begins at 
about six, rages from eight to eleven, is at its height 
at ten, and, among boys, lessens after fourteen. Of 
things collected the following general. classes exist: 
Cigar pictures, and stamps, 34 per cent. 
Objects from nature, 32 per cent. 
Playthings, 11 per cent. 
Miscellaneous, mostly trivial, 8 per cent. 
Pictures, 6 per cent. 
Historical, 3 per cent. 
Literary, 2 per cent. 
The rage for stamps is from nine to eleven, and for 
cigar and cigarette pictures from eleven to twelve. 
Among the prominent single objects gathered, besides 
those already mentioned, are picture post cards, 
marbles, advertising cards, books, rocks, shells, war 
relics, buttons, badges. 
While local opportunities vary, these facts would 
furnish suggestion as to the directions of probable in- 
terest. It will add much to the value of the process 
if the apparatus used, such as aquaria, cages, flower- 
presses, scrap-books, be made ‘by the boys themselves. 
Great as are the advantages to health 
and recuperation of giving city boys 
country air, the chief advantage seems 
to be that the country is a boy’s own 
home-land. Here only are the instincts of his life

  satisfied, and here only can he rightly develop the more 
elementary part of his nature. Mr. E. M. Robinson in 
his excellent study of boys’ camps says: ‘‘ The rowing, 
the swimming, the games and athletics, the plain food 
and fresh air, the freedom of dress and action, the 
enduring of trifling inconvenience, and the running of 
trifling risks, the touch with nature in storm and calm, 
the looking out for one’s self, the exercise of one’s 
judgment, the following of the leading spirits of the 
camp, and the leading of the following spirits and a 
hundred and one other things, all tend to make the 
camp a place where the boy will develop those savage 
virtues which are the admiration of boyhood. .. . 
Every tendency of the camp is to develop the manly 
side of his nature, and to make him despise and rise 
above all that is weak and effeminate.’’ The enjoy- 
ment of uncomfortableness, the desire to be on the 
water and in the water and close to a body of water, 
to be in the sand, to stay out all night, to sleep on 
the ground, to bury one’s self in the sand, to watch the 
camp-fire, to brood over the waves and the stars, the 
devotion to the camp leader, the passionate friendships 
to camp comrades, the peculiar tenderness to manly 
religious impression at night when the fire burns low — 
these seem to be reversions to a more primitive state 
and opportunities for the most intimate and enduring 
and uplifting influence upon the lives of boys. And 
nothing will do more to give a man confidence in the 
goodness that underlies a boy than to ‘ive outdoors 
with him for a while. It is a stern test of the quality 
of his own manhood, and, if he meet it, the surest bond 
for a lifelong friendship. The boys’ camp is rapidly

developing into an institution in America. The school 
camps provide a wholesome summer for wealthy boys, 
the Y. M. C. A. camps reach many of the middle class, 
and some street boys’ clubs help the poorer boys in 
this way. There is still the largest room for private 
camps, to which an adult leader may bring a few boys 
of his church or club. If more workers with boys 
knew how simple an affair a camp is, they would try it, 
for a week with boys under a tent is worth more than 
a whole winter in Sunday-school or a club room. I 
have repeatedly taken groups of boys to a camping 
place near the city for a week or more when the total 
cost was only two dollars for each boy. Practically the 
only danger, as it is also the chief delight, is the water, 
and if the rowboats be carefully examined and no bath- 
ing is allowed except when all go in, this is reduced to 
a minimum. 
In this connection it seems necessary 
only to commend highly the plan of the 
Stamp Savings Society and the pass-book system of 
the boys’ clubs. Saving 
Believing in the power of music to 
soothe the savage breast, several clubs 
have organized choruses. Churches organize boy- 
choirs as much to refine the boys as to help the ghurch 
music. Some clubs print the better popular ballads 
of the day, mingled with patriotic songs, on sheets for 
singing in unison. Contrast the sunset hour in a 
college town, with hundreds of boys singing on the 
campus, with the same unmusical or uproarious hour 
in a large village or small city, and you will see 
something of what music will do.

  SOME SUGGESTIONS 
  
I have already spoken sufficiently of 
collections, of vacation schools, of sum- 
mer camps and of winter groups for nature study. I 
commend the Agassiz Association and the Chautauqua 
Junior Naturalists. 
This instinct is much neglected. It 
is as legitimate as any, and craves ex- 
pression. Mr. William A. Clark speaks of “‘ the boy’s 
mind, cursed with melodrama.” He is referring to the 
street boy and his interest in sensational news, prize 
fights and the plays of the South End playhouse. 
Some substitute for these evils must exist. The cha- 
rade, the dialogue, the missionary and Sunday-school 
concert and the desire of boys and girls to “ get up an 
entertainment,” are manifestations of the same instinct 
in our church life. In this age, when open church 
opposition to the theater is becoming silent, our chil- 
dren will be kept from the real temptations of the mod- 
ern theater by giving them their own opportunities for 
expressing this instinct for personifying character and 
action. In adolescence dramatics are helpful in enforc- 
ing unconsciousness of self, accuracy in memory and 
action and some degree of grace of demeanor. Some 
spontaneous activities of children seem to indicate that, 
where their taste is unspoiled, they incline toward the 
portrayal of familiar characters, the dramatizing of 
stories they have heard and to a hearty enjoyment of 
humor. A pantomime of Hiawatha, the acting out of 
some boy’s Indian story or an Indian legend, animal 
plays, “ The Husking,” “ The District School,” drills 
of various sorts and dialogues introducing foreign cus- 
toms and costumes would all seem to be most appro-

priate and wholesome. The missionary societies have 
an unrealized opportunity in this direction. 
It is desirable, when children are 
maturing, that they should be brought 
together under adult auspices for mutual acquaintance 
and development. The socials should be small. The 
children should come in sections, if there are too many 
to come at once. There should be one head, who should 
have a definite plan for the entertainment to be pro- 
vided, and a sufficient body of adult assistants. The 
pleasure should be spontaneous and much of it pro- 
vided by the children themselves, but it should be 
refining, of continuous interest, inclusive of all, and 
governed as to its date by the school work and in its 
length by the bedtimes of the children. 
Not only is the story the chief way of 
teaching in both the secular and the 
Sunday-school until the child is well along in adoles- 
cence, but it is a method of universal interest. It was 
the primitive form of history and the first means of 
perpetuating crude scientific discovery and religious 
tradition. It is the material of the Old Testament and 
the charm of the New. It is a perpetual interpretation 
of life. Fairy stories not only appeal to but are the 
actual translation of child-life, which is fairy life, in its 
wonder, credulity and ignorance of boundaries and 
limitations. Stories of courage and adventure also re- 
flect that era of hero-worship and out-of-doors in which 
the adolescent lives. They enlarge the knowledge of 
life and are for a time the only method of making a 
child enter into sympathy with other races than his 
own. They teach expression by voice and pen and

  dramatic action. They lead the child to share. They 
speak the truth naturally, because they show actual 
moral situations without arguing or moralizing. They 
develop both feelings and will, for they make the child 
wish he could and they suggest to him that he may. 
Miss Vostrovsky in an examination of children’s own 
stories found that they told stories about children 
rather than older persons in the proportion of 40 to 1; 
true rather than imaginary stories, as 49 to 7; and of 
unusual rather than ordinary subjects, as 45 to 11. 
She also gives a chart of the elements of boys’ interest 
in stories, which I reduce to per cents, as follows: 
action, 36; name, 24; appearance, 10; possession, 7; 
speech, 5; place, 5; time, 3; feeling, 2; dress, 2; esthetic 
details, 14; sentiment, 1; moral qualities, 1; mis- 
cellaneous, 24. 
The sources of good stories for parent or teacher are 
myths and fairy stories of the past, legends, historical 
stories, Bible stories, stories from the daily press, 
stories from his own experience and fancy. 
Story-telling is not so hard as to some it seems. If 
one will remember that every good story has but four 
elements and these always in the same order, namely, 
the hero, action, suspense, solution, and that to tell a 
story well you should tell it as if you were standing at 
a window seeing its events transpire and as if your 
auditors could know it only from your report, you can 
tell a good and even a great story. Continued stories 
and the re-telling of favorites are happy reliefs to those 
whose imaginations are becoming exhausted. 
Believing that the boy reproduces successively the 
ideals of the race, and that impression even by stories 
149

  THE BOX PROBLEM 
  tends to and should issue in expression by action, 
Professor Burr has applied to the boys in the federated 
clubs conducted by students of the Y. M. C. A. Training 
School at Springfield a graded course in stories, as 
follows: 
1. Race stories, especially Teutonic myths, legends 
and folklore. Stories appealing to the imagination and 
illustrating the attempts of the child race to explain 
the wonders of the world in which he lives. 
2. Stories of nature; animal and plant stories. 
3. Stories of individual prowess; hero tales, — Sam- 
son, Hercules, etc. Stories of early inventions. 
4. Stories of great leaders and patriots. Social 
heroes from Moses to Washington. 
5. Stories of love; altruism; love of woman; love of 
country and home; love of beauty, truth and God. 
He suggests also the possibility of associating with 
these stories, as appropriate means of expression, 
activities as follows: 
With nature stories, myths and legends would be 
associated tramps in the woods and every variety of 
nature study; care of animals, plants, etc. 
With stories of individual prowess would be asso- 
ciated the individualistic games, athletic and gymnastic 
work for the development of individual strength and 
ability; also, constructive work of the more elementary 
type, — work with clay, knife work, basket-weaving, 
etc. 
With the stories of great leaders and patriots would 
be associated games which involve team play, fellow- 
ship, obedience to leader and subordination of self to 
the group. 
150

SOME § UGG EST 1'O N.S 
  With the altruistic stories would be associated altru- 
istic activities adapted to boy nature, — the doing of 
something for other boys less fortunate. 
The story, not the homily, is with children the su- 
preme teaching agency for moral impression. The 
moral, by the way, is better not at the end of the story, 
but in sly touches in the middle and as produced by the 
narrative itself. He who can look into a circle of chil- 
dren’s shining eyes and tell a good tale knows one of 
earth’s finest luxuries. Oh, for more shamans, minne- 
singers, troubadours, bards, jongleurs or Pied Pipers! 
Miss Caroline M. Hewins has made 
the following careful study of the pro- 
gressive tastes of children’s literary appetite, which I 
condense from The Congregationalist of November 22, 
1902: 
“The likings of children may thus be summed up: — 
“ First, Pictures and rhymes in broad and simple outlines, as 
primitive and elemental as the stories and drawings of the cave 
men. 
“ Second. Poems and ballads, rhythmical and full of action. 
“ Third. Wonder tales and also stories of every-day child 
life. 
“ Fourth, Stories of heroes, mythological and historical. 
“ Fijth. Stories of adventure, trial and suffering that end well. 
“ Every child who reads at all first enjoys picture-books, and 
his taste leads him to prefer pictures in flat color, with as few 
lines as possible, and no elaborate shading or confusing multi- 
plicity of detail. The bright reds, blues and yellows in Sunday 
papers appeal to him. Every year books are put out as coarsely 
executed, as low in ideals, as the front pages of the yellow jour- 
nals. On the other hand, some beautiful artistic work has been 
done for children in line and flat color. 
“ The second step in the child’s enjoyment of books is when 
he enters into the comprehension of story-poems longer than 
151 Reading 
 
-P-A-G-E-152
  THE BOY PROBLEM   
Mother Goose rhymes. A good standard for poetry is one of 
the older collections, like ‘ Our Children’s Songs,’ published by 
the Harpers more than twenty years ago.. Children like the 
rhythm and swing of verse if it is not reflective or subjective, and 
sometimes feel the charm of melody in a poem which they do 
not understand, like Gray’s ‘ Elegy,’ Macaulay’s ‘ Battle of 
Ivry,’ or Rossetti’s ‘ White Ship.’ 
“The next step is prose stories. Every child delights in the 
old-fashioned fairy tales if they are told in the old-fashioned 
way. 
“ At the time when children enjoy fairy tales they like stories 
of boy and girl life, if these stories are told in a straightforward 
manner, with a great deal of detail. 
““ Wonder tales lead to hero tales, and a child begins to learn 
something of the history of the world and of the lives of great 
men. He likes to hear about Romulus and Remus, King Alfred 
and George Washington. He loves to read of the perils and 
privations of the early settlers of this country, of Indians and 
the Revolution. He has heard in school of knightly ideals and 
perhaps belongs to a Round Table. 
“ A child’s liking for biography is usually an acquired taste, 
growing slowly out of the stories of great men and women which 
are told in school as a means of awakening an interest in history. 
A few biographies which are interesting to children have been 
written in response to a demand, and are published by educa- 
tional firms, but are little used except for help in school work. 
Biographies as well illustrated as Boutet de Monvel’s ‘Joan of 
Are,’ which first attracts a reader by its pictures, would be sure 
to delight children. A test of a good biography is its clearness, 
simplicity in statement of facts and lack of theories. 
“When a child can pick up an unfamiliar book and read it 
easily, he is ready for the next kind of literary food. He begins 
to ask for longer stories, tales of adventure, accounts of battles 
and hair-breadth escapes. This is a dangerous time, when, 
unless a boy has the best tales, he grows to care for nothing but 
poorly written stories of lads who leap from poverty to wealth, 
or skip all the ranks from private to major-general; and a girl 
gravitates to sentimental tales of children who take care of the 
152

    SOME 5 UsG. Ge bus. 2: 10) NS 
  whole family’s finances and love affairs, or are misunderstood 
by cruel mothers and aunts. 
“‘ Wholesomeness in modern stories and adventures that are 
too far removed from a child’s ordinary experience to make him 
think of emulating them are the characteristics that should be 
sought for in choosing books for boys and girls from the years that 
they can read independently up to the time when naturally and 
unconsciously they set sail on the great sea of grown-up books. 
There is a stage when they like boarding-school stories, and 
the world is full of overdrawn tales of school life. A good 
touchstone for them is a series like Elizabeth Stuart Phelps’ 
‘Gypsy’ or Susan Coolidge’s Katy Books, which girls have 
enjoyed for thirty years, or Harriet Martineau’s ‘ Crofton Boys.’ 
In adventure ‘ Robin Hood’ is a good standard, and so is the 
‘Swiss Family Robinson,’ with its always fresh contrivances and 
makeshifts tending towards simplicity of living. 
“The demand for out-of-door books indicates the growth of 
a healthy taste. There is no danger that such books will be 
made too easy for children. A child of five soon gets the habit 
of going to a bird-book or an insect-book or a flower-book ‘to 
identify something that he has seen, and learns to read about it if 
he is not expected to read long at a time. Since the publica- 
tion of ‘ Wild Animals I Have Known,’ there has been a steady 
demand for stories of animals. Some of them are overdrawn, 
some too tragic for children, but the tendency of most is in 
favor of kindness and compassion towards our four-footed 
brothers. : 
“ Boys and girls like books that give them the rules of out- 
door sports, suggest games and charades for indoor evenings, 
teach them riddles and show them how to use their hands. The 
increase of interest in athletics, the teaching of basketry and 
carpentry in schools and the many uses which may be made of 
a course in manual training have opened the way for new books 
of occupations, games and sports.” 
Mr. Alan Abbott, writing of the requirements for 
college entrance, says: 
“Let us now turn to the books that arouse a boy’s enthu- 
153  
-P-A-G-E-154
  THE BLOLY PROBLEM 
  
siasm: Scott, Cooper, Shakespeare, Coleridge head the list, — 
romanticists all,— men who stood for the enlargement of the 
imagination, men of passion, of feeling. The characteristic 
quality of those men is that they are idealists rather than realists; 
instead of exciting curiosity for the familiar, they lead us 
far into the past, into the mind world, into the realms of the 
fancy. 
“The essential conditions as shown in these pages I may 
sum up as follows: — To be interesting to a schoolboy a book 
must not begin with copious references and allusions, presup- 
posing wide acquaintance with literature or history. It must 
not be critical, destructive and massive, but constructive or 
stimulating. It must be first hand; not a translation in the 
terms of an age out of sympathy with the original, for a boy 
cannot disentangle the works of two minds upon each other. 
It must be interesting not primarily for its form, for a boy will 
never admire the form for its own sake. And I suppose it 
should be romantic, suggestive of ideals and achievements, 
for the normal boy in the high-school age is passing through his 
own romantic period, and it is natural to set before him ideals 
that are really worthy.” 
The fact that what a boy is required to read in school 
is the smallest part of what he actually does read stirs 
Dr. E. A. Fitzpatrick to the following strong state- 
ment: 
f 
“The large amount of reading done by children outside of 
school, especially from twelve to fifteen years of age, the in- 
equality of reading done by pupils in the same classes, the differ- 
ence between the reading of boys and girls, the difference in 
kind of reading found interesting at different ages, the extraor- 
dinary influence of school association and school work upon the 
reading of pupils and the effect that extensive reading has upon 
the work of the school, all emphasize in the strongest degree the 
importance of teachers and superintendents giving a large 
amount of attention to this question. No question of courses 
of study in school or methods has half the significance in the 
154
-P-A-G-E-155
  
  SOME SUG Gf ST POuNcs 
  
mental and moral development of children that the question 
of children’s reading outside of school has.” 
It may be the current saying that to-day “ only 
women read books; men read newspapers,’’ moved Mr. 
D.C. Heath to make this appeal for “ literary wholes ’’: 
“The boy should early begin to read books in their entirety, 
‘books,’ as Professor Burton says, ‘ with their heads on and 
standing on both feet.’ The constant reading of extracts, of 
scraps, of snippets, the magazine and newspaper habit, destroy 
the power of concentration and weaken the mental grasp, and 
should be discouraged from the very outset. Therefore let us 
see that our boys have complete books put before them.” 
A mother, writing in The Outlook from her own ex- 
perience, speaks of the reading mania which many boys 
have between twelve and fourteen and then gives her 
advice in the premises: 
“Harriet Martineau, with her wise counsel, is balm to my 
soul when she tells us we must not be annoyed with the excess 
of the propensity for much and rapid reading, nor proud of the 
child who has it. It is no sign yet of a superiority in so young 
a child, much less in that wisdom which in adults is commonly 
supposed to arise from large book-knowledge. It is simply an 
appetite for that expression of ideas and images which show 
at this season, but are laid in for the exercise of the higher 
faculties which have yet to come into use. The parent’s main 
question during this process is to look to the quality of the books 
read; I mean, merely see that the child has the freest access 
to those of the best quality. The child’s own mind is a truer 
judge in this case than the parent’s suppositions. Let but 
noble books be on the shelves and the child will get nothing 
but good.” 
Mr. Julian Hawthorne writes a rather iconoclastic 
article regarding the ordinary “ juvenile” or child’s 
magazine, but closes with this sensible advice: 
155 
 
-P-A-G-E-156
  THE BOON, PROBLEM 
  “ Give it anything except what is morbid, sentimental, doc- 
trinal, controversial — in a word, false or transient. Let it learn 
by heart all the great poetry up to Tennyson. And always 
remember that what it does not understand, or misunderstands, 
is likely to be of more final value to it than anything that 
it does understand, for reasons which you may understand if 
you will take the trouble to think; meanwhile you may take it 
for granted. Give your child at home a healthy, wholesome, 
_ natural life and keep away from it corrupt companions of its 
own age; no others and nothing else can injure it, save in so far 
as the seeds of injury are already innate in it. It will not be 
an angel on earth; but it will be itself.” 
These studies show how directly though blindly the 
boy feels his way, as he develops, past all that is intro- 
spective, and, regardless of mere form and style, to the 
literature of romance, feeling, life. He grows from the 
merely imaginative unto the heroic as his own nature 
emerges from the fairyland of infancy to the days of 
achievement. And what he reads begins to develop 
him not only individually but socially as, with but little 
of the perspective of history, historical fiction makes 
him, nevertheless, something of a world citizen. 
It must be remembered that adults and boys read 
for different reasons. The adult reads for the study of 
character and of life. The boy reads for the sake of a 
thrilling sensation and for the purpose of identifying 
himself in imagination with his hero. Books, there- 
fore, have one mission for children and another for 
adult years. To childhood they furnish excitement, 
ideals, encouragement, outlooks, materials. They give 
to the adult refreshment, food for rumination and the 
corroboration of personal thought and experience. 
Books that perform their mission to boys must be like 
156
-P-A-G-E-157
SOME SG Gk S Tet.o N's 
  the men whom boys admire. They need not have 
grace or style, but they must be strong, direct, heroic, 
sincere, simple and tender-hearted. 
The practical question which the parent and teacher 
face is how to protect the boy from unworthy reading 
matter. ‘ Shall I tell you how to prevent a boy read- 
ing dime novels?’’ said a science teacher to me one 
day. ‘Teach dime novels the way you do college 
entrance English.” There was much truth in the 
sarcasm. Much of the analysis of the English classics 
done in school creates only a permanent distaste for 
them. More positive methods must be used. Put 
only the best within your boy’s reach. Introduce it to 
him by telling him stories from it, by reading it to him. 
Do not hold up too high a level. If he won’t read 
Scott, give him Stevenson. If he doesn’t like Steven- 
son, give him Alger. I am not so sure that I would 
absolutely prohibit all nickel novels. Certain series are 
clean, patriotic and to a mild degree informing. Their 
fault is that they are highly colored, but they appeal 
to a highly colored age. If while the boy is buying 
these out of his own money you are steadily present- 
ing him with choicer books, he will soon get over this 
literary measles. 
Introduce as many boys as possible to the public 
library, for many of our libraries by story hours, 
attractive bulletins and attentive custodians are woo-’ 
ing the young into ways of pleasantness that are also 
paths of peace. 
I hardly need add that my opinion of the Sunday- 
school library may be summed up in a bright saying

Monday anything that is too wicked to do on 
Sunday.” 
I need not speak of the many uses 
of the Perry Pictures, the Elson Prints, 
etc., in creating an interest in art, history, collecting, 
etc. To require a group to invent a story to fit a 
picture is good drill for the imagination. I have found 
three pictures of Holman Hunt’s especially helpful in 
the religious instruction of adolescents. There is 
something in their opulence of detail and mystic beauty 
which makes them singularly effective. They may be 
used for impressing the solemn lesson of the importance 
of adolescence as the time of choice and opportunity. 
First, I use “ The Child in the Temple.”’ I point out 
the many details: the inscription on the door, the doves, 
the rejected stone in the court, the blind beggar, the 
lamplighter, the babe brought to circumcision. Then 
the characters appear: the doctors with their scrolls and 
phylacteries,— one is blind,— Mary with her look of 
amazement and love, Joseph with his protecting hand 
and the boys in the picture, — the musicians, the slave 
and the boy Jesus. It is his hour of awakening to 
life’s meaning, God’s will and his hour of choice. I use 
the “ Light of the World” to lead to the thought of 
the life-door at which the Christ knocks, which can be 
opened only from within. And “ The Shadow of the 
Cross” suggests the manliness of the young Christ and — 
his choice of the cross rather than the jewels over which — 
his mother lingers. 
I have spoken in the last chapter of the use of stereo- 
graphs to give reality to the Bible.

  The true leader will be often Socratic. 
He will not furnish categorical cate- 
chetical answers, but, finding that the one thing human- 
ity and especially child-humanity is unwilling to do is 
to think, he will constantly in private and in public 
suggest haunting and leading questions of ideal and 
practical ethics which must and will be answered. 
I believe that sex-peryersions are the 
most common, subtle and dangerous 
foes that threaten our American life. 
Intemperance is frightful, but it is a perpetual object 
of attacks, some of which are successful. The appetite 
which excites it is unnatural and has to be acquired. 
The sex-appetite is universal, it partakes of the ex- 
treme selfishness of a most selfish period and its sins 
are so hidden, so general and reach such personal and 
intimate relations that it is difficult to crusade against 
them. These perversions usually have their root and 
acquire their dominion in adolescence, when passion is 
most active, ignorance most great and self-control most 
weak. 
The topic has been handled with so much senti- 
mentality, unwholesomeness, quackery and downright 
deviltry that I will make a strenuous effort to treat it 
with sober common sense. The three sex-temptations 
to which boys are subject are, I take it, impure thoughts 
and conversation, self-abuse and fornication. The first 
temptation is the result of knowledge of sex matters 
gained from impure and imperfect sources and is stim- 
ulated by a desire to complete this knowledge, by the 
impression that such knowledge is esoteric and is to be 
regarded as a sort of stolen sweets. An analysis of the

  secret reading of the young indicated that 64 per cent 
of it was an endeavor to secure information on this 
subject. This temptation is to be met in the home by 
stripping the subject of a mystery which it does not 
possess, by revealing frankly and simply, as curiosity 
arises, the facts of sex as a part of general physiology, 
and by such an emphasis upon the holiness of the func- 
tion, the sacrifices of maternity and the necessity of a 
sound body as the antecedent of future parenthood as 
shall give the moral cleanness and the ideals to lift the 
child above brooding, unenlightened, morbid thoughts 
and passion-feeding conversation. Some educational 
experiments that have been made indicate that it is 
possible to approach the sex-structure of man precisely 
as the student does the rest of human physiology, in a 
most wholesome way through nature study and biology. 
The effect, even in mixed classes, has been to uplift and 
purify the minds of the children. 
The matter of self-abuse is to be dealt with physio- 
logically also, a fair statement of its effect upon the 
nerves, endurance and energy of the growing boy ex- 
plained, and contempt expressed for it as a nasty habit 
rather than the implication that it is physically or 
spiritually damning. I think we may as well face the 
fact that the practise is, for at least a short period in 
life, well-nigh universal. To teach physical horrors 
which may not follow is not to deter those to whom 
they do not follow and is to put others under the con- 
trol of the quack practitioner, while to preach that this 
vice is the unpardonable sin is to dishearten those who 
struggle against it in vain, but who may, if they are 
dealt with indirectly, outgrow it or be weaned away

  from it. This habit is much a matter of nutrition, 
clothing, hygiene, association and physical exercise. 
Fornication when it occurs with boys may be the re- 
sult of an abnormal sexual nature, but it is more apt 
to be the result of information gained surreptitiously 
and curiosity unduly aroused and of evil companion- 
ship or unusual temptation. It is important to con- 
tradict the impression given by much of our literature 
that this sin is romantic and semi-heroic, and to show 
its essential cruelty, selfishness and beastliness. 
The method of treatment for all these evils is, in 
general, to delay and temper sexuality by plain food, 
early rising, thorough bathing, a watchful care of read- 
ing, companionship and causes of excitement, plenty 
of exercise and the full occupation of time. The close 
and mysterious connection between the rise of the 
religious and the sexual instincts makes it seem pos- 
sible to make one govern the other/ It is upon these 
two matters, which come so near to the soul, that one 
can draw closest to a boy’s life. Ideals are, I believe, 
the final and supreme safeguard of purity. I agree 
with Prof. H. M. Burr that “ the possession of high 
ideals of bodily strength, of the essential elements of 
strong manhood and a high ideal of woman” are the 
things that hold when all else fails. 
The place for doing this work is the home. It is 
strange that parents should be willing that stable-boys, 
quacks and villains should become the instructors and 
guides in those matters which have so much to do with 
personal purity, the morality of the commonwealth and 
the future of the race. 
Where the parents are not doing their duty it must

-P-A-G-E-162
    THE BOY PROBLEM 
  be done by others. But when others take this up the 
best way to use first is to try to persuade fathers to 
perform their tasks. “ Purity talks” should be given 
to fathers rather than to boys. Books may be sug- 
gested to fathers for wise information. A few are com- 
mended in the Bibliography. As I have intimated, it 
may be that the schools will soon do something. I 
have a wholesome distrust of all reformers who make 
this subject a specialty. There seems to be something 
corrupting to the imagination of every one who makes 
it, even with the best intention, a hobby. They soon 
become morbid or unwholesome in thought. The 
family physician, who does not make it a specialty, 
is, on the whole, the best man to ask to take it up in 
individual cases. 
If boys must be instructed by anybody outside their 
home they should be dealt with individually and by 
conversation. No book has been written which is 
quite suitable to put in a boy’s hand. If it tells too 
little it will arouse his curiosity. If it tells too much 
it will inflame his imagination. The effort is to be not 
to make him think about this subject, but to satisfy 
his legitimate curiosity and get him to thinking about 
other things. 
Why does not some physician write three short 
pamphlets on special physiology for this purpose, one 
for the young boy, one for the adolescent and one for 
the young man contemplating marriage? He could 
put all the facts that need to be known and all that 
needs to be said in each one on eight pages the size of 
this one. 
This is why I object to “ purity talks ” to boys. The 
162

SOME SUGGESTIONS 
  subject is for them not social but individual. They 
are not to go out and exchange words about it and 
brood over it. The strongest force for purity in the 
boys’ club is that it is a time-filler and energy-expender 
for boys and a means of transforming an abnormal 
appetite into healthful physical exercise. “The thing 
which we want to get our boys to do is to realize that 
it is a noble and knightly thing, as well as a necessity 
to many, as Prof. Burt G. Wilder has said, “ to go into 
training ” for a manly struggle with the sensual side 
of his nature. 
An encouraging illustration of the way this wiser 
treatment works is seen in its results at the Good Will 
Home for Boys in Maine. As each boy enters the 
school he is during some informal conversation in- 
formed by the principal regarding the wise regulation 
of his body with especial reference to the dangers of 
puberty. No further reference is ever made to the 
matter, unless the boy makes it himself, as he often 
does, when he comes across some alarming bit of mis- 
information, but among all the teachers and in all the 
life of the school it is insisted that the sexual organs 
are simply a commonplace and not a shameful or mys- 
terious portion of the human body. Before the close 
of his course each boy receives in the same way from 
the principal such information as will help him meet 
further temptation and prepare him for married life. 
The result is this: young men who have associated 
with these boys most intimately for a considerable 
period during the summer find that the conversation 
of all is free from obscenity, and that the moral life of 
the school is pure. 
163
-P-A-G-E-164
  THE B O-Y PROBLEM 
  I am glad to note that the boys’ departments of 
our Christian Associations and many religious workers 
with boys are taking this up, but I wish they would 
first take lessons from Mr. Hinckley in the art of how 
to do it. 
There are many other things which can be used to 
help boys. The use of humor, a trait which is uni- 
versal in boyhood, will not be forgotten. What we 
call noisiness, teasing, hoodlumism, practical joking 
and even irreverence is what some one styles “ joint 
humor.” Remembering that this is so, the best way to 
attack those nuisances is by the expression of humor in 
better ways. Conundrums, puzzles, “ sells,” ‘ yarns”? 
and newspaper jokes are good bait for boys, who are 
usually as well provided as their leader with material 
and quite as quick to take advantage of their oppor- 
tunity. The illustrating of the personal habits of clean- 
liness, temperance, reverence, good taste, by example, 
is a constant privilege. Anything of the other sort 
in a leader is a complete disqualification. To en- 
courage a boy to have a pet of some kind is far better 
than to get him to join a society for rescuing stray 
cats and then bragging about it. Indeed, doing for 
others is the strongest ethical force which the boy 
can feel. We are told truly that “ girls are trained 
to give up, boys to demand.” Often the boys’ club 
exaggerates this tendency. Talks on practical ques- 
tions by men whom the boys may justly admire are 
also an ethical influence of great importance. The 
introduction of recognitions and special privileges 
will have a stimulating effect, if they are made acces- 
sible to a fair grade of effort rather than exclusive to a 
164  
-P-A-G-E-165
  
SOME SUG GES FLONS 
  first and second. The last method which I name is the 
most important. 
The three curses of humanitarian 
work are utilitarianism, uniformity and 
numbers. And the greatest of these is numbers. It 
takes perpetual vigilance to do church or social work 
without becoming a slave to the addition table. All 
work for men that amounts to anything is in the end 
the influence of personality on personality. So in boys’ 
work we have two things of importance to consider: 
the personality of the leader and that of the boy. Mr. 
Mason suggests as the easier qualifications for such a 
leader that “‘ he must necessarily have the magnetism 
of Moses, the patience of Job and the wisdom of Solo- 
mon.” It would be unfortunate to place the standard 
so high that everybody would shrink from the work. 
The boy is influenced by his leader in two ways: 
through his imitativeness and through his affections. 
He idealizes his leader and tries to become like him. 
“ Teaching is really a matter of contagion rather than 
of instruction.” His leader must therefore be a person 
of character and self-control. He loves his leader and 
wants to do for him. His leader must be a person of 
ideals, who can offer him good and true things 
to do. 
The personality of the boy must never be forgotten. 
We must forget our addition table and stop seeing our 
boys as flocks. The most important thing any one 
can do for a boy is to love him. We must know each 
one in his school, his home, his playing and gathering 
places as well as at the club or our own home. There 
are so many different kinds of boy under one hat, 
165 Personality 
 
-P-A-G-E-166
    THE BOY PROBLEM 
  and boys differ so much in their individual interests, 
and the interests of one boy change so often, that 
every leader ought to keep an individual “ case book ” 
and revise it every night before he goes to bed. 
There is one unpleasant and unwholesome trait in 
boys that is likely to be fostered in almost any organ- 
ized work with them in which self-government is a 
feature. That trait is self-complacency. In giving 
boys encouragement to believe that they can be men 
it is not easy to avoid letting them get conceited. Here 
comes the deeper danger of externalism. Boys and 
adults are willing to legislate about themselves and 
others in all sorts of ingenious ways so long as the 
legislation does not touch their own wishes and con- 
duct. It is quite easy for a boy to become very promi- 
nent and popular in a boy democracy and remain quite 
untouched inside, rotten at heart. Here, I believe, is 
the moral weakness of all “ junior republics.’’ Per- 
sonal power is the only antidote. The personal power 
of the leader must be constantly and vigilantly exerted 
to persuade each boy that “ self-government ” means 
what it says, not legislation about one’s self or others, 
but the government of self. The boy’s personality 
must be reached in the recesses where it hides and 
exposed, if need be, until he becomes willing to take 
up the task of being clean within. 
In every group of boys there is at least one third who 
cannot be reached by any group method. They may 
be unsocial, they do not like what other boys care for, 
they have not the leisure or the permission to join a 
club. They are worth just as much as the rest. These 
must be won solely by personal approach. 
166  
-P-A-G-E-167
  
SOME SUGGESTIONS 
  The way to help boys by the methods 
we have mentioned, as Lancaster says, 
is to “ inspire enthusiastic activity.” ‘ You can do 
anything with boys. You can do nothing for boys.” 
“ Oh,” says one, “ you give the boys something easy 
all the time.” The things that inspire enthusiastic 
activity in a boy are not easy things. Is baseball easy? 
Is football easy? Is swimming a mile easy? Are wood- 
work or parallel bars or punching-bags easy? Interest 
is not ease, but it makes things easy. In that marvelous 
study in the New Testament, of Jesus and the Rich 
Young Man, we have a study of Jesus and adolescence, 
and the appeal that the Master made which aroused 
that slothful idler almost out of a lifetime of 
languor, was an appeal to the difficult, with this in- 
spiration, his own passionately declared love for him. 
We should use as many methods as we can thor- 
oughly, letting each get its effect and coordinating also, 
so as to feed the boy with as many interests as possible. 
We cannot tell which one may determine his life-work 
or mold his character. It is inspiring to remember 
that the little group club of boys is often a lad’s first 
entrance to the social institutions of his race and that 
in the self-originating exercises of the boys’ club one 
may do what the school does not accomplish, — help 
the boy to decide what he shall be. 
“ Education,” says Mr. Lee, “is not a matter of 
teaching this or that, but of kindling the spiritual life.” 
That kindled, no matter how or where, you have fos- 
tered the flame of a dynamic that shall impel all the 
later activities. 
We should give each boy something to know, some-

thing to love and something to do. That is, we must 
train his mind, his heart and his hand, and while doing 
these three we train his will. 
It is a curious fact that the boys most in need of suc- 
cor are of two classes, the children of the rich and the 
children of the very poor. Here, as elsewhere, the life 
and activities of the common people are the sound core 
of the nation’s strength. The boys of the rich are 
debauched by luxury and the free use of money. They 
suffer most of all for lack of opportunities for general 
and wholesome social fellowships. The boys of the 
very poor are degenerated by the opposite causes, lack 
of nutrition, instruction and good example. Another 
fact which shapes the whole problem is that most boys 
are living to-day in what is for them an artificial en- 
vironment. They live in cities. No one who has dealt 
with boys successively in rural regions, large towns 
and the city could have failed to notice how much less 
potent in grasp, attention and efficiency are city boys, 
living between walls and pavements and among a 
thousand distractions and allurements, than country 
boys, with their freedom, contact with nature and wild 
life and opportunity for origination in work and play 
in woodland, pasture and carpenter shop in the barn. 
The problem is by no means, then, a missionary one, 
in the sense that it consists in providing clubs for slum 
boys alone. The extravagances, immorality, intem- 
perance and general good-for-nothingness of wealthy 
boys are often an alarming factor in our suburban life. 
The difficulty of restoring natural conditions among 
unnatural surroundings is tremendous. It means the 
artificial creation of a country atmosphere. The in- 
168
-P-A-G-E-169
SOME SUGGESTIONS 
stitutions and instrumentalities which are striving to 
do this by their shops and playrooms and their vaca- 
tion philanthropies are, though informally, among the 
great benevolences and educational institutes of the 
city, and need and demand a fuller recognition and a 
heartier support by consecration of money and life. 
The needs and possibilities of work with adolescents 
can scarcely be exaggerated. One third of life, ‘‘ the 
submerged third,” as Dr. Stanley Hall calls it, is in the 
adolescent period. One third of the people in America 
are adolescents. Three millions of the human beings 
in America are boys between twelve and sixteen years 
of age. The so-called heathen peoples are, whatever 
their age, all in the adolescent period of life: We send 
missionaries to inculcate among these distant peoples 
morals and religion which we seem to think our own 
little folks can possess by some innate providential 
instinct. Work among men has been emphasized as 
of prime importance, but as compared with work 
among boys it is as salvage to salvation. 
The attention of the Church during the last twenty 
years has so turned toward the young that it takes no 
prophet to foretell that this is to be the central work 
of the Church in the new century. Jesus, who ap- 
peared before the world at the beginning of his adoles- 
cence and left it at its close, set the child in the midst 
and said, “ Of such is the kingdom of heaven.” The 
psychologist and the Christian are both listening to this 
word of the Master. ‘“ Save the world in adolescence ”” 
will be the new war-cry of evangelism. 
In the development of the boys’ department of the 
Y. M. C. A., and in the growth of the big city boys’

  THE BOY PROBLEM 
  
clubs, in the founding of institutions of religious peda- 
gogy and the multiplication of classes in child-study 
and teaching methods, in the opening of a new pro- 
fession, that of the teaching ministry, in lay work in 
the Church, we have abundant intimations that the 
field of work for boys is soon to offer many oppor- 
tunities for many men’s life-work. In the smaller 
groups of those engaged in social service, in the 
Sunday-school and the other forms of church nurture, 
the harvest is already white for splendid consecrations 
of volunteer helpers. 
This volunteer movement will be as truly one for 
the devotion of young people as the famous student 
movement which was born at Northfield in 1886, and 
it will be both for home and foreign work. Foreign 
missionary work, already conducted with a breadth 
and scope which is a lesson to home church work, will 
be enriched and made fruitful by the application of 
pedagogical methods to the adolescent races. In the 
home churches here is the beckoning opportunity for 
the younger ministry, fresh from its own adolescent 
days. But it is not a priestly service alone, though 
the calling is asacred one. Many college students, like 
that one at Harvard who told Professor Peabody that 
“he wanted to make Harvard something more than a 
winter watering-place,’”’ have done work for boys during 
and after college days, and have sometimes found the 
religion in service, which they had lost in study. Joseph 
Lee suggests that as the young page was placed in 
charge of an esquire but a few years older to learn 
knightly habits and then sent to the young knight’s 
castle to learn knightly ideals, so the boys of to-day

  IN THE CHURCH

THE BOY PROBLEM IN THE CHURCH 
Tue boy problem in the church is not different from 
that in the home, the school and the community. It 
is the same boy everywhere. He may step a little 
more quietly, wear a different suit of clothes and have 
a whiter looking face and hands than elsewhere, but 
he is the same after all: physically alert and restless, 
emotionally eager, socially friendly though shy, men- 
tally absorptive and curious, volitionally independent 
and stubborn, and with a spiritual nature which is 
secretly but honestly feeling for foundations and 
development. 
Here, as elsewhere, it will be impossible to separate 
one portion of this complex being from another and 
train it by itself, just as it would be impossible to act 
toward the boy in school as if he were all intellect and 
no body, or in the gymnasium as if he were all body 
and no intellect. To the church as elsewhere the whole 
boy comes, and in it as elsewhere he must be symmetri- 
cally trained. 
The metbids of training boys in the church, then, ° 
will not essentially differ from those used elsewhere. 
The church desires as much as does the gymnasium 
that the boy should have a sound body, and as much 
as the school that he should have a sound mind, and 
as much as either that he should have a sound heart

THE BO: Y PROBLEM 
  to govern both. In short, with other philanthropies 
that work for boys, the church stands for character, 
developed in mind, body and spirit. 
It may be true that the church seeks more than any 
other institution does. In seeking Christian character 
it seeks character moved by the Christ-motive as a 
motive higher than any others possible. But as ele- 
tents of that character it must recognize, with others, 
the interdependence of mind and body and the essen- 
tials of will training and moral training by self-activity, 
which have already been emphasized. , 
When we come to ask what the church has found 
out about the training of the religious nature, we are 
at once impressed that both the oldest and the newest 
study have been little more than statistical analysis. 
You can catalogue a date or an event, but it is hard 
to catalogue a boy. Whether it be in the annals of 
“some ancient revival or in the charts of Starbuck we 
have learned little more than this: that at certain ages 
conversion is most to be expected; that it is brought 
about by a certain number of immediate motives which 
are scheduled and by a much larger number of distant 
motives, equally efficient, which are forgotten and are 
not scheduled, and that in addition to those youths 
\, gained by certain methods testimony is completely 
silent as to how many are actually alienated by the 
same methods. 
Without claiming to have gone deeper than others 
into these depths of the soul life let me state the things 
which I believe the church is trying to do and show 
what seem to be the probable means of success in these 
directions; —

IN THE CHURCH 
    First, the church is trying to hold 
the boys. 
Recognizing that its methods in the past have failed 
to keep their grasp upon boys at their age of greatest 
need and danger, it is trying to learn how to retain 
the boys through the adolescent period. In thus seek- 
ing to fit its methods to the growth of the boy the 
church is doing one of the best things for future 
Christian development, since habits of church-going 
and loyalty grow stronger and more influential upon 
character with each year they are continued. I have 
already indicated that, in trying to hold boys, the 
churches must use freer, more varied and more un- 
conventional means than in the past. If some pious 
heart tremulously inquires of a given plan, “ Is there 
enough of Christ in it?’ my straightforward rejoinder 
shall be, “‘ Is there enough boy in it?” 
But this itself is not enough. Boys must be won 
to church membership. I have commended the plan 
of the Episcopal Church, by which the boy is never 
allowed to think of himself as anything but a prospec- 
tive communicant. The plan alone might seem me- 
chanical were it not supplemented in so many churches 
of that denomination by graded boys’ clubs, which 
make a traditional loyalty actual. My own endeavor 
has been so to make the activities of the boys’ club 
work toward loyalty to pastor and church, and so to 
ereate the realization among boys fourteen years of 
age and over of the naturalness of confessing Christ, 
that it shall become a current anticipation. We must 
so adapt our help to their conscious needs and so 
develop that “ team-work ” and fraternity spirit, which

  THE BOY PROBLEM 
  mean so much in sports and in college, in and for the 
church, that the distressing loss of adolescent life shall 
be checked. ‘“ The church must somehow,” says Coe, 
“become the religious gang to the early adolescent.” 
Second, the church is trying to 
teach boys. 
Every boys’ club, every church soci- 
ety for boys, is in reality a school. Formal school 
methods need not be used, better not be used, but 
sound pedagogical axioms must be applied and there 
must be pedagogic aim. 
As to the subjects of teaching, there are the great 
landmarks of religion taught in the Bible and which I 
outlined when I spoke of the Sunday-school curricu- 
lum. Hardly less important are the applications in 
conduct, the emphasis of the fact that character, as _ 
President Hyde tells us, “‘ is chiefly to do one’s work | 
well,” and intelligence of and interest in the ac- 
tivities of the church and the world-wide social and 
missionary work of the kingdom of God. To boys in 
the city and those who have few advantages, there are 
many things supplementary to school life which may 
well be taught, especially those constructive crafts 
and plays which arouse the energies, focus the atten- 
tion, train the will, make the child creative, keep him 
from morbid introspection and direct to his life mission. 
Third, the church is trying to win 
boys to the religious life. 
I have analyzed carefully the different organizations 
which are trying to help boys in our churches. I had 
better, as a sort of summary, speak of several dangers 
and difficulties in dealing with boys which are inherent 
178 Teaching

  to all these methods and are besetments in any other. 
One of these is tradition. The fad of to-day becomes 
to-morrow the traditional way of doing things, and 
before we know it we have no other. 
Another difficulty is uniformity. Tradition is the 
mortmain of yesterday, but uniformity is the iron 
grasp of to-day. Wherever it is it throttles conviction 
and strangles individualism, progress and soul freedom. 
There is also the temptation of numbers. As long 
as people love to roll on their tongues the fact that there 
are fifteen millions of people in America’s Sunday- 
schools and read with awe the quarterly accounts of 
the growth in figures of the Endeavor movement, they 
will cease to try to find out that things need to be meas- 
ured and weighed as well as counted, and that the 
other millions, whom our thoughtless and careless 
methods alienate, cry up to God continually in the 
face of our complacency. 
But in dealing with boys there is often quite an oppo- 
site tendency. It is the danger of coddling. Sup- 
posing the leader has few boys instead of many, and 
is using many thoughtful methods; he may awake 
some day to find that he has done so much for them 
that they have become paupers upon his charge for 
recreation, incentive and material for character. 
To avoid the danger of coddling I would see that 
the boy had something to do for the church as well as 
the church something for him. The ‘ church messen- 
ger service of boys” is a recent attractive device to 
this end. In the boy choir, the giving of entertain- 
ments, the sharing of good times with others and 
in missionary instruction and activity this can be 
179  
-P-A-G-E-180
  
THE Bi Ony, PROBLEM   
accomplished. If you are seeking spiritual aims I 
think the essential thing is to find and group together 
the Christian boys and make them the personal, active 
force for evangelizing the others. They are worth 
more than all sermons, methods and other efforts put 
together. I have spoken of work for boys as useless, 
of work with boys as rewarding, but I am inclined to 
say that work by boys is to be the key-note of future 
evangelism. 
But the greatest danger is unnatural- 
ness. It is safe to say that when one 
talks with a boy in the Sunday-school class upon 
religious matters, the teacher and the boy are almost 
never their real selves. One of the axioms of social 
effort is never to create a condition among those whom 
you try to help which you cannot make a permanent 
one. This is the immorality of an ordinary revival. 
It creates in the hot night atmosphere of a church, in 
the presence of a crowd and with the accompaniment 
of fervid eloquence and exciting music, a social and 
sense condition which cannot be carried out into the 
daylight and the home and business. So the Sunday- 
school teacher must be natural. It is a cowardly thing 
to say personal things and ask searching questions of a 
boy in the midst of his fellows which you would not 
dare to ask that boy privately in ordinary conversation. 
It is to protect these reserves thus rudely assaulted that 
a boy puts on with his Sunday suit a disguise which he 
carries to the hand-to-hand encounters of the Sunday- 
school and Junior society. The teaching which merely 
touches that artificial boyhood will be easily slipped 
off when the disguise is removed Sunday evening 
180 Naturalness

and the boy goes forth to the sport and freedom of 
Monday. 
We are unnatural in method often because we expect 
unnatural results. I have already spoken of the danger 
of making prigs. Dr. William J. Mutch sensibly points 
out that results which are purely religious when pro- 
duced in young children are always to be regarded with 
suspicion. The boy is living on the ethical rather than 
the spiritual level until he is well along in adolescence. 
He needs homely virtues more than spiritual graces. 
We are to try not to make little men, manikins, but to . 
produce the promise of manliness. “ Even a child is 
known ” — not by his praying, testifying, ecstasies, but 
— “by his doing.” : 
President G. Stanley Hall has said: ‘ There are the 
best of psycho-physiological reasons for holding con- 
version, or change of heart, before pubescence to be a 
dwarfing precocity. The age at which the child Jesus 
entered the temple is as early as any child ought to go 
about his heavenly Father’s business, if not too early 
with our climate, temperament and life. To prescribe 
a set of strong feelings at this age may introvert atten- 
tion on physical states, increase passional activities and 
issue in a sort of self-flirtation or abnormal self- 
consciousness.” The Rev. Parris T. Farwell, who makes 
this quotation, adds: “‘ The observation of many of us 
will approve these words of warning. It is not evi- 
dence of the wisdom of a course of treatment of chil- 
dren that it brings many of them into the church. 
The real question is, What kind of Christians does it 
make: It is comparatively easy to lead children to 
assent, at a very early age, to our ideas. It is possible 
181
-P-A-G-E-182
  fs B OvY, PROBLEM   
to lead their imaginative minds to a conception of their 
own sinfulness, such as they ought not to have at their 
age. It is even possible to lead them to an imaginative 
affection for Christ which is good so far asit goes, and 
should be cultivated, but which needs to be supple- 
mented before it can be the power to hold and mold and 
save which characterizes the loyalty of real disciple- 
ship.” 
The ultimate aim of our effort is to have not only boy- 
hood but also manhood in the church. By winning 
and holding boys and nurturing them in a natural and 
growing faith is the shortest road to this happy goal. 
In general, methods should apply to nearly all the 
boys as fast as they come to the age for approach. 
Since the Sunday-school is the instrumentality through 
which pass nearly all the children of the community, 
it is this agency which I would exalt and improve and 
enlarge rather than those which have followed it. 
It is of the greatest importance that . 
whatever work for boys is undertaken 
in a local church should have an authorization that 
shall make it continuous. Too often when a pastor 
leaves a church all the social organizations which he 
has built fall like card houses behind him, and his 
successor either disregards his work or, with little 
apparent reason, builds up another entirely different 
set of amateur and puny organizations. 
The need for continuity and permanence, by the way, 
is an argument for long pastorates. In the kind of 
work I am advocating, where personality is of so much 
more importance than method, time is needed for 
influence to be extended and do its perfect work. 
182 Continuity
-P-A-G-E-183
IN THE C.HU.R CH 
  Methods should be natural in order 
and application, elastic and rich in 
variety and adapted to interest and enthuse those 
whom we reach. More and more I think we may be 
careless whether our own plan is named after or affili- 
ated with any larger movement, since there are so 
many to draw help from and such variety of means is 
necessary and since the purpose of us who have the 
work to do is not to glorify any society or movement, 
but to make manhood out of its stuff, boys. 
The deepest thing I have heard said lately was by 
the Rev. Charles E. McKinley: ‘‘ Every method or 
agency used in Christian work must give account to 
God not only for the souls whom it wins and saves, but 
also for all whom it alienates and destroys.’’ We are 
not to be satisfied with our success among little chil- 
dren, big girls and old women, if in trying to reach 
live boys by the same methods we find that we cannot 
touch their nature or needs. 
My own experience and study in a variety of ex- 
periments with boys in the church for a period of over 
nine years lead me to condense my advice into the 
following suggestions: 
I. The church must place “ the child 
inthe midst.” It must organize around 
the child. Its architecture and fittings, its services and 
activities must make the adolescent the first thought 
and not an afterthought. 
II. There must be in the church, either pastor or 
another, at least one person who is equipped for work 
with boys and girls. In the larger churches we must 
differentiate once more the two functions of the minis- 
183 Variety

THE BOY. PROBLEM 
  try and have again “ the pastor ” and “ the teacher.” 
In smaller churches and in family churches I think the 
second service will yield to a Sunday evening with the 
young people. 
III. The first thing to do is to develop in the primary 
and principal human institution, the home, intelligent 
and active care of growing boys and girls. The chief 
object of pastoral calling is to confer about the welfare 
of the children. The chief normal work to be done 
is to train teachers for boys and girls. The imperative 
themes for the midweek meeting of the church are 
such as relate to childhood, its training, temptations 
and local environment. One of the most important 
practical activities of the church is to fight home- 
destroying institutions. Each sermon should have a 
bearing upon the home. 
IV. It is desirable to visit, study and coordinate with 
the church all the other local means of education, such 
as the home, the school, playgrounds, vacations, li- 
braries, museums, social settlements, local historical 
sites, etc., before defining the special boys’ work in a 
single church, in order that the work done may be sup- 
plementary and may take such advantage as is possible 
from these others. 
VY. The following church instrumentalities are to be 
relied upon, in the order of their importance, in work 
with boys: 
The Sunday-morning service and sermon. 
The Sunday-school. 
A week-day institute for boys affiliated with the 
Sunday-school. 
Home visitation and consultation.

  VI. The following is a practicable 
scheme for the church education of 
boys, which requires only the instru- 
mentalities and workers possessed by an 
average church. A Scheme for 
Church Work 
with Boys 
1. Religious training: 
The sermon. 
Sunday-school instruction. 
The pastor’s class. 
Seeking opportunities for service for children: 
choir, errands, entertainments, individual 
activity, systematic giving, helping at home, 
keeping the Ten Commandments and living 
the old-fashioned virtues. 
The evangelizing of boys by boys. 
Personal and individual care. 
2. Will-training: 
Such as by wood-work, cooperative construc- 
tion, making of games, designing of Bible 
book-covers, games and play. 
Recognitions for church attendance. 
38. Heart-training: : 
Such as by liturgy, music, stories and pictures, 
drama, pets, the Knights of King Arthur, 
Bible and hymn-learning, personality of 
leaders. 
4, Mind-training: 
By collections, printing, saving, missionary and 
general information, talks and tours, super- 
intended reading. 
185
-P-A-G-E-186
  THE BOY PROBLEM   
5. Physical training: 
Marches and drills, tramps and camps, wood- 
work. 
6. Social training: 
Socials, entertaining others, social service, 
missionary giving. 
I have been led more and more to 
exalt the Sunday-morning church serv- 
ice as the chief religious influence upon 
boys. I have received encouraging results from the 
offering of simple recognitions for attendance and from 
a boy choir. I have also been impressed that by “ the 
foolishness of preaching’? much can be done. Mr. 
McKinley, whom I have quoted before, exalts this as 
the divinely appointed agency for the redemption of 
boys. He calls attention to it as the opportunity 
“ where, all unquestioned and all unobserved, he may 
lift up his heart to God, where, without being hastened 
or pressed, he may think out his long thoughts until 
they settle his character for life.” A rich, expressive 
service, thoughtful and generous prayer and fervid, 
luminous preaching — surely these are bread of life to 
the age of wonder and awakening. 
I used to spend considerable labor in that difficult 
task of preparing five-minute “ sermonettes.” They 
require as much work as a sermon. Somehow they 
interrupt the continuity of the service. Recently I give 
the entire time at one morning service a month to a 
sermon to children and young people. I am con- 
sciously addressing children from ten to fourteen. The 
theme, the language and the treatment are solely for 
them. JI find that no sermons are more popular. There

  are many younger children who understand most of 
what is said and there are a great many adults of 
adolescent minds and hearts who are overshot by con- 
ventional, abstruse and scholastic discourses, who are 
refreshed. 
Two or three points are impressed 
upon me as those upon which present- 
day emphasis is needed. The occasion for the need is 
in every case a neglect in the practise of the home or 
in the common ideals of the church. One of these 
emphases should be upon the Bible. The traditional- 
ism of our older thinking made the Bible a remote and 
unnatural book, while the newer treatment has not be- 
come the possession of the layman sufficiently to be 
used in the teaching of children. For reasons aside 
from these the Bible is neglected. I do not find that 
boys often think of it as an attractive book or an 
every-day book. Sometimes they seem to think it is 
rather to be ashamed of if one is found carrying it or 
reading it. Without diminishing its sacredness we 
ought to show that it is truly interesting reading and 
continually practical. To adorn its pages and to own 
a respectable copy of it will make a boy feel differently 
about it. He should see it as a varied literature, as 
sixty-six books rather than as one, as story-book and 
daily hand-book. He should know it in the modern 
language of “ the Twentieth Century New Testament.” 
He should be taught to test it by modern biography and 
daily practise in ethics. It should become more vital 
that Jesus may be more vital to him. 
No more crying need exists in the church than that 
of missionary instruction for children. I consider that 
187 Present Needs
-P-A-G-E-188
  THE BOY, PROBLEM   
the whole future of its home and foreign departments 
depends upon its relation to childhood. The whole 
problem of missions consists in training up future 
givers. We are worrying about the consolidation of 
our too-many societies, our “ twentieth century funds ” 
and our “ forward movements,” and especially about 
our depleted treasuries, the occasion of all the rest, 
when the real lack is the fundamental one of interest. 
We have by each mail some new form of literature 
intended to increase interest, but its statements and 
appeals are not calculated to arouse interest where it 
did not always exist, and it goes to the same place 
where the literature of similar appearance and illus- 
tration, the patent medicine circular, goes — the waste- 
basket. We have missionary secretaries, who may 
either bore us with their annals and figures or melt us 
to sentimental tears with their touching tales, “ touch- 
ing ” to the pocket-book, prudentially emptied before- 
hand of all but lesser coin, but so little touching the 
intelligence that we often forget to what cause we have 
been giving. Now this arousing of interest should be 
all done before adolescence closes, for at that time close 
our keenest memory for facts, the most permanent im~ 
pression made upon the emotions and the formation of 
the ideals. It is a dreary country through which one 
travels who seeks to find a missionary literature that 
children will read, manuals of instruction that are 
practicable and other methods of exciting attention 
that are interesting. We need in our Sunday-schools 
and in our lesson system so to incorporate missionary 
teaching that it shall take the dignity and importance 
of the revealed Word itself. When I speak of “ mis-~ 
188 
 
-P-A-G-E-189
  IN THE CHU CH 
  sionary teaching ” I plead for something really deeper. 
What we want is not money for “ causes,” but loyalty 
to loves. “It is not what you do for him, but what 
‘he does for you and for the crowd,” says Joseph Lee, 
“that makes the boy loyal.” Having won loyalty 
through service you want to ally the boy with all 
social progress. It is a narrow, jealous church that 
gives information only of its own little denominational 
“ boards ”’ when all modern social movements and even 
current history are equally portions of the kingdom of 
God. We want in our week-day organizations dra- 
matic and pictorial methods that shall enthuse and in- 
spire the early love and generosity of boys and girls 
for the great world causes. Our greatest need here, of 
course, is that the home should originate this enthu- 
siasm. Perhaps if we begin with the children now — 
not in mournful little missionary societies presided over — 
by forlorn and lonely workers, but in the central 
educational institute of the church and with an ade- 
quate literature to take the place of the literature 
wasted upon adults — perhaps we shall have fathers 
and mothers some day who will do more of this them- 
selves. 
We need, too, to emphasize that religion is service. 
To gather children when they ought to be helping 
their mothers or studying their lessons is unchristian. 
To foster a desire to be good without being good for 
something is mischievous. To create a committee for 
the purpose of watching its chairman do its work is 
an American fault not confined to children’s societies. 
It is also paralyzing to a child to be set to do work 
that he knows very well is not worth doing. It is the 
189  
-P-A-G-E-190
THE BOY PROBLEM 
  supreme duty and privilege of the helper of boys to 
give him the very highest inspirations possible to the 
soul and then to do the difficult thing of making them 
applicable to that hodden gray, homespun stuff called 
Duty. 
It is my own habit, as a pastor, to 
enroll my Sunday-school in divisions in 
the order of maturity, and to endeavor 
that none shall pass into or through adolescence with- 
out my personal attention. The number in that 
period at once may not be very large, but it embraces 
in a very few years all the children in the church at 
their most susceptible age. I visit the homes and 
schools of these children for conference and information 
as often as possible. As soon as cold weather approaches 
I gather them in informal groups, after school or Satur- 
days, for activities, not previously announced, varying 
each year, in short courses and conducted as much as 
possible out-of-doors and at home. I have been doing 
the only strictly religious work, outside of the preaching 
and securing for them the best teachers in the Sunday- 
school, just before Easter in the form of free Sunday 
afternoon conferences. I rely almost entirely upon 
real friendships thus created, a mutual enjoyment of 
the society of each other, coordination with the home, 
carefully cherished loyalty to the church and salvation 
by displacement. I believe it to be important to gain 
this friendship early in adolescence and to regain it by 
earnest tact in that trying period of independence and 
change which precedes reconstruction, at sixteen to 
eighteen. It is at this latter timethatthe pastorneeds to 
give most personal care to his young people’s societies,

  which, conducted by others and by methods possibly 
not adaptable to boys of that age, sadly lose those who 
most need to be held. At twelve and at sixteen are 
the points for personal work — the former for acquaint- 
ance and association, the latter for meeting restlessness 
and doubt; the former for counteracting evil influences, 
the latter the Golden Age for good influences. This 
latter is the “‘ emigration period ” of life, corresponding 
perhaps in the race-life to the fruitful years of the dis- 
coverers and pioneers. In general, I try to enrich the 
lives of the boys as much as possible, to be of real 
service to them and to know and love them. I become 
so much interested in studying them and in learning 
from them, the only true friends that one in maturity 
is ever sure of, that I scarcely ever think of myself 
as their teacher, except in the pulpit, where I always 
find before me many eager, boyish faces. 
As for results, I find that a considerable group of 
young people always offer themselves to the church as 
fast as they mature, coming spontaneously and to- 
gether. I have had mothers come to me and tell me 
with emotion that their boys were changed in their 
conduct at home, and this was testimony of the most 
satisfying character. I have seen some of these changes 
with my own eyes and have watched young men go 
out into life feeling that my touch had been in their 
molding. 
It is intensive work. Sometimes it 
seems to be small in its reach and grasp.

My message is really this: We must rely less upon 
scheming and method and cease to look for the prophet 
of a miracle movement that shall solve our problem. 
In home and community and church we shall save our 
boys as Jesus did the world, by the sharing of life with 
them. For them we must go down into the Galilee of 
simple-heartedness and the Samaria of commonplace 
and dwell at the Nazareth of childish toil and struggle 
and kneel in the Gethsemane of intercession, yea, and 
climb the sacrificial mound of Calvary, as did the 
fathers and mothers and saints of old, to bring them to 
God and to form in them the eternal life of a new 
creation.

THE BOY IN THE HOME 
One who writes with boldness on the social education 
of boys in general may well hesitate to speak on their 
moral education in particular. A man may in social 
endeavors lay the responsibility for imperfect results 
upon his coworkers, the parents of those with whom 
he works and the boys themselves, but in his own home 
there is no one but himself to bear that responsibility, 
except his wife, who is probably doing her own share 
nobly and a part of his own besides. _He who humbly 
feels the need of setting his own house in order has 
little time to give counsel to others. 
Still, if a man has learned anything, even in humble- 
ness of spirit, he ought to share it. 
It is some time before the true awfulness of parent- 
hood dawns upon a father. He rejoices with exceeding 
great joy and ignorance when his first man-child is born. 
But he has as yet no idea of what is expected of him. 
It is not what the community expects 
of a father that is so alarming; it is 
what his own child expects of him that 
frightens him. It is the unexpected way in which 
young children deify their fathers which startles most 
men into their senses. When a man hears’his babe say

  God to another soul, some day. He recalls that God 
has no bad habits and no blue Mondays. This gives 
him much food for thought. To realize that this young 
creature implicitly expects. of’ his father unvarying 
truth and universal evenness of spirit is disheartening 
to one’s sense of ease. 
The secret of a great fatherhood is the habit of 
incarnation. There is practically nothing else we have 
to do, but this is a thing that may well tax all our 
strength — always to put ourselves in our child’s place. 
And this is something, after all, that nobody else can 
teach you, though many will try. What you learn 
you learn in the laboratory, from the objects of 
experiment themselves. 
The only infallible teachers of fathers are their own 
children; and what most of us keep busy in doing is 
to try te prevent them from finding it out. 
Many people are willing to give everything to boys — 
their own or other people’s — except the priceless gift, 
themselves. They offer their personality to others 
much as that curious South American lizard, which, 
when pursued, shakes its tail off and leaves it in the 
path as a bait, while it flees on to shelter. It is not 
easy to do. Some one remarks that it is a great man 
who can put himself in a small place and not feel 
cramped; and Plato said: “ Many are the wand bearers, 
but few are the true bacchanals.” Yet the weakness 
of most fatherhood is its externalism. 
In the first chapter { laid considerable stress upon 
the imminence of the boy’s physical nature and his 
avidness of life. His response to every impulse is more 
intense than that of girls. This extremity of the boy’s 
194

  feeling often leads to irregular acts. Certain years of 
the boy’s life have been called the semi-criminal years. 
It has been discovered that the very year which is the 
acme of the criminal period is also the height of the 
conversion period. You can-expect anything of a boy 
at-that period, and when he is most susceptible to evil 
he is also intensely susceptible to good. 
But as we study this curious inconsistency we notice 
this one satisfying fact — that every one of these 
instincts and passions connects with something also 
that is good, and there, I think, you have the key to 
the situation. The Master spoke of it in one of his 
parables when he told of the man who had a house in 
which was an evil spirit, and he drove out the spirit 
and swept the house, but instantly seven other spirits, 
each worse than the first, came in. The good drives 
out the evil or the evil drives out the good. Salvation 
by displacement is the great principle for the moral 
development of boyhood. 
All these qualities, if they can only be focused on the 
right things, will drive out the evil. We must offer 
him interpretations of these enthusiasms and ideals. 
We must interpret them to ourselves not as indications 
of total depravity, but simply of abundance of life. 
Now in order to meet this abundant life in my boy 
in the right spirit several things are required of me. 
For my boy’s sake one thing I need is 
health. Not for the purposes of corporal 
punishment, but so that he will not be 
ashamed of me. He wants me to be his hero always, but 
when the great heroic years come on and he believes, 
with his old Greek contemporaries, that the laurel is

that I don’t amount to much in the real world unless I 
am strong and swift on my feet, hold my breastbone 
high and am able to see my toes as I look down across 
my waistcoat. 
I see that as the boys wander through the medieval 
realms which they must traverse before they become 
my contemporaries, I must be much out-of-doors, 
away from the crowd and hard by hills, waters and 
flying clouds. I know that I shall have to camp out, 
try to learn to like what no-one who has outgrown boy- 
hood-ean newly learn to like — to fish, to hunt, to swim. 
I must learn to tell a toadstool from a mushroom and 
a birch from a balm of Gilead. It makes me old to 
think of it, and I lament the boyhood I never had, be- 
cause I was such a good child that they let me read 
books when I should have been roaming God’s wonder- 
land, and made me learn to swim in the bathtub. 
Think for a moment of the things children like in 
the country. What are the elements of a boy’s heaven? 
Pets, things to eat, quiet nooks, homemade toys, 
sportsmanship and a chum. Now these are just the 
simple sort of things we need for ourselves. They take 
us away from hotels, parlors, best clothes and sedentary 
employments, and constitute that change which is itself 
rest. I know it requires a deliberate act of the will 
sometimes to alter one’s winter habits suddenly. I my- 
self find it hard when the cry rings through the upper 
hall in rhy country house at 5.30 in the morning, 
“ The last man out of bed is a nigger,” to get myself 
up quick enough to avoid being the colored gentleman 
for that day. But it is good to do.

\Most parents do not have enough fun with their 
; children; some because they think parenthood is a 
‘“proféssion and take-it too seriously, and most be- 
cause they get all tired out with them in the winter. 
Vacation is a great opportunity to regard the young 
through joyous-eyes, undarkened even by child-study. 
Let a father count that day lost whose low de- 
scending sun has not seen him laugh with his 
children. 
One thing every one of us needs to 
crave constantly is the sense of humor. 
The boys are getting into the awkward 
age, when their nerves and their muscles do not keep 
pace in growth. Now humor among boys-is-a-form of 
awkwardness, an intellectual ungainliness. No boy is 
really irreverent; he is only humorous. A group of boys 
are not consciously noisy-or a nuisance. Their actions 
are expressive of joint humor. It takes humor to see 
humor and to bear with it. George Eliot never said a 
truer thing than when she once remarked that “ there 
is no ae strain of friendship than a different taste 
in jokes.” Ns always need a gift in prayer, but during 
the trying days of adolescence I pray that I may have 
a gift of humor. There is no situation which seems 
serious-that does not have something funny in it. To 
be able to see that will save the situation. Sarcasm is 
wit, not humor, and it has almost no place in a.parental 
vocabulary. The sense of humor in a parent is the 
only thing that can help.a boy live through his moods 
and despairs and that can enable us meanwhile to be 
able to live with him. tated she highest and best

THE BOY PROBLEM   
The key-note to all this is reality. A 
boy is the most real creature alive. He 
sees things straight through and he al- 
ways tells the truth-when he_is not scared into lying. 
He has a horror of moralizing, “ personal work” and 
good advice. He does not like to be wept over by a 
woman or caressed or prayed over by a man. His 
ideals, because of his splendid physical vigor and rapid 
growth, are largely physical ideals. ‘ Nipper Brown 
is the best scholar in my class,” confesses the author of 
“ The Real Diary of a Real Boy,” but adds, with simple 
pride, “ I can lick him with one hand.” Life to a boy 
is, as it is not to us, real all the time. 
Unto such a person it is no use to come with finger 
on lip or frown on face or even with a rosy apple hitched 
to a prayer-meeting — if you would find him at home. 
We must bring to these boys a religion that is as real 
as themselves and that will live among their boyish 
instincts. They must be allowed to be boy Christians 
in a boy’s, not in a man’s, way. 
Reality is the only thing worth working with or for 
in trying to help boys. A boy may be able, as a recent 
writer expressed it, “‘ to disgorge Bible verses like buck- 
shot out of a bag,” or willing to turn his soul inside out 
in a prayer-meeting like a turkey’s gizzard, but if he is 
not honest and clean in his living he has simply become 
a young whitewashed sepulcher. Methods, too, must 
have real ends in view and appeal to real instincts. 
The supreme opportunity of parents with boys is that 
they may make a constant and unadulterated appeal 
to enthusiasm. As this is something every normal boy 
is ready to furnish in quantities, you have only to 
198 Reality

EN THE HOME 
  engage it wholesomely to get hold of the whole 
boy. 
The anthropologist explains most of the moral aber- 
rations of boyhood as the emergence or persistence of 
savage instincts. If these can be prevented from 
functioning, they wither and disappear. They are so 
prevented by filling the life full of the opposite tend- 
encies. It is the filled and not the empty life that is 
morally safe. The boy who has learned the cost of 
making things is not so likely to destroy other people’s 
property. The boy who can be made enthusiastic in 
doing something is never going to have time or desire 
to be obstreperous. The boy who has been stirred to 
live for some large purpose is not so subject to the 
temptations of intemperance or pleasure. 
We are then, in short, to keep busy appealing to a 
boy’s real instincts and in trying to get him to enjoy 
his virtues more than he does his vices. My experience 
is that it doesn’t make much difference what method is 
used. The essential thing is to have hold of one boy 
by as many handles as possible. 
A little girl once moved from the 
The Advantage ¢ountry into Chicago. When the first of a Country 2 Home night came and she knelt down among 
the boxes in the closet that was to be 
her chamber, she put up this petition: “ O Lord, have 
mercy upon us. Thou hast taken us out of the bright 
and beautiful country to this dark and dirty city, 
where we can see thy dear face no more.” Of course it 
is the last phrase that is pathetic. Life with the , 
Divine Companion is difficult to children who live in 
our great cities.

TH BOY PROBLEM 
  While I was hanging to a strap in a car the other day 
I got to thinking about Abraham. A verse in the olden 
story came to me with a sensation of restfulness and 
quiet: ‘And Jehovah appeared unto him by the oaks 
of Mamre, as he sat in the tent door in the heat of the 
day.” The contrast between the patriarch in his tent 
door and the American jammed into a flat seemed to 
me very refreshing. 
Abraham had plenty of leisure. He kept office hours 
with his own heart. He not only got a living, but he 
got time to live. He had so few things that he used 
them allevery day. He lived down through everything 
he had. When he came to a green pasture he did not 
race around it to take bird photographs. He lay down 
in it beside the still waters and restored his soul. He 
had selected a lot of things not to know. Mrs. Whitney 
once said that the test of a man’s life is the things that 
get crowded out. Abraham knew nothing about “ the 
latest,’’ whether scandal, horror, fad, book or evening 
edition. In his day even yeast and fire were hard to 
get. To-day the things worth while need to be put on top 
shelves so that men will have to care to climb for them. 
There isn’t much to see in a tent, therefore tent- 
dwellers are always looking out of the door. They have 
a childish aliveness, joyousness, welcome to all that 
approaches. Now how many men do we know who 
are so interested that they displace books, and how 
many books that displace themselves by the enthusi- 
astic activities they impel? How many people find 
their virtues as interesting as their vices? Who has 
made the simple life so divine that he wonders not to 
find that God is his guest?

  But Abraham did all this by running away from the 
city. The reason he had miracle-children who star the 
sky with their glorious names is because they were born 
and brought up in the country. 
We who cannot live in the country must struggle 
strenuously to provide such substitutes as we may for 
what country life means. 
President Bryan, of Franklin College, 
was for a couple of years at the head of 
the Department of Education in the 
Philippine Islands. I was talking with 
him one day at a teachers’ convention when a typical 
country hoosier pedagogue came up to us and drawled 
out, “ Say, perfesser, that was quite a jant you took 
aout among the Philippians. Did yer see much? ” 
“ Well, I got a few exposures.’’ 
Getting a few exposures is one of the privileges we 
ought to try to give our children. They need them. 
I had entered a boy in: the Boston Latin School. 
One day I received a peremptory summons to the 
school. So I went and asked the principal what was 
the matter. He asked me to sit down and wait and 
see. After I had sat an hour I wanted to take the boy 
out and see that he received proper treatment. He 
acted as if he were patronizing the school. He had 
got what we call “ the college air.”” The boy of twelve 
was already blasé. He had no reverence toward the 
knowledge or even the splendid traditions of the 
school. But he was not the only boy in the room 
afflicted with that disease. 
If this sort of thing keeps on, it is going to be serious. 
The primal thing in education is reverence. Plato said 
— 201 “ Getting 
a Few 
Exposures ”

  so; Jesus said so; Ruskin said so. It is essential that 
the boy should have a chance to find out that there are 
greater and grander things in the world than his own 
self. He must see that the stars do not revolve around 
his own person. 
One of my favorite pictures is a painting called 
“The Lion’s Cubs.” A group of English schoolboys 
standing in Saint Paul’s are looking eagerly at the 
memorial tablet to Lord Nelson. Each face is trans- 
figured with hero-worship. A boy is the only creature 
who can admire anything without thinking how he 
looks when he is doing it. And not many boys nowa- 
days can do it. 
Boys must be exposed to nature, to work, to good 
books. And then I would have children exposed to 
folks. I don’t mean mobs, but just folks. 
There are some folks whose touch upon children’s 
heads isachrism. To entertain such angels is the chief 
thing for which hospitality was invented. I know of 
homes whose furniture is modest but good — much of it 
on the walls in the forms of books and pictures, and 
little of it in the form of things to trip over and that 
have to be dusted — where some of the greatest names 
and some of the best men are being constantly wel- 
comed. Into one such home in Connecticut the other 
day came Saint Charles Wagner, he of the Simple Life. 
The eldest daughter served the table at breakfast, the 
baby asking the blessing at table, at family prayers the 
children were prayed for by the father-priest by name. 
The good saint acknowledged then and there that he had 
once had a vision of the Simple Life, but now he had 
really seen it. And the children, not being told or 
202

IN THE HOME 
  knowing how great were the men who sat at the board, 
to which a father’s shrewd love had invited them for his 
children’s sake, only felt that every guest became a 
blessing. 
And now I want to approach briefly 
The Way of but reverently what Horace Bush- God with ; 
a Child nell when he wrote his own biography 
beautifully called, “The Way of God 
with a Soul.” 
The spiritual life of a little child is like a little cup, 
brimming over with the water of life and easily spilled. 
But it is very little. 
The penitence of children for their misdeeds seems 
usually so slight and temporary. Their little sins are 
as much a surprise to them as they are a grief to us. 
They are mostly the product of childish ailments or the 
result of a web of circumstances in which a child finds 
himself quite innocently entangled. The phrase with 
which Boss Tweed in the Tombs apologized for his 
striped career exactly represents their feelings: “I 
tried to be good, but I had hard luck.” 
This being the case, efforts for maturer qualities 
ought evidently to be avoided. To expect or strive for 
a religious ‘‘ experience ”’ from a young child is as fool- 
ish and pathetic as to seek to secure an apple crop from 
sapplings. A good-hearted little one will, if brought 
up in a minister’s family, for example, try to be as pious 
as his parents, just as a two-year-old apple tree of mine 
bore itself to death one summer in producing some 
precociously fine pound sweetings. We may as well 
realize, as Paul did, that it is first that which is natural 
and afterward that which is spiritual; that a child must 
203 
 
-P-A-G-E-204
  THE B’O YY: PROBLEM 
  
become manly before he can become godly. A normal 
child will say his little incantations which we call 
prayers, invoke his tooth when it aches or his pocket 
fetich when he is in a tight place, and look for miracles 
of deliverance when he is in trouble. We need not 
question or rudely disturb such imaginative and savage- 
like faith. It is faith — the only faith that is genuine 
inachild. In the meantime, we, of course, may habit- 
uate him to right conduct and religious observances, 
rejoice in the dear, uncovenanted graces of his heart, 
furnish him vacant formularies which he will first 
grotesquely and then maturely populate, and give 
him thus the materials and the skill for building 
life. 
Probably if children really do in any way “ rehearse 
the race life” they do it more in their religion than in 
any other way. With them, as with savages, it is prob- 
ably fear which first teaches them really to pray. Thus 
they learn to depend, and for a child to depend, or a 
man to cease to make excuses, is to pray. 
The principal thing that a child has to do morally 
before he is twelve is to grow a conscience. The 
principal thing after that is to get power to use his will. 
I would be very glad, if I were sure it were a good 
one, to be able to button my own moral code around 
my child, knowing that it would probably protect him 
until he was big enough to outgrow it, but I would much 
rather be sure that he had learned to speak the truth in 
his heart. If a boy can always do that, it is about all 
one ought to expect of him before he is twelve. If he 
obeys me, that is discipline, but if he learns to obey 
himself, that is character.

Among all the experiences of early 
boyhood it is in punishments. that a 
father learns most how hard it is to be God to a child. 
Anybody can lick a boy in anger with a good relish, but 
after it is over he knows with shame that he has been 
a coward and a brute to do it. The child may not 
realize all this. The zest with which my father used 
to castigate me gives me now a belated but keen satis- 
faction. Still it is required of a man that in giving a 
licking to the glory of God he should do so after fasting 
and prayer. Those are the modern miracles by the 
laying on of hands, but the father who can perform 
them realizes what it meant for old Abraham to lead 
young Isaac up Mount Moriah. 
It may seem quixotic to say, but I am convinced that 
after a boy is old enough to tussle with his father he 
should only be whipped with his own consent. I have 
known a boy to wait a whole day before he was ready 
to see things in this light, but when he did there were 
thé same kind of tears in his father’s eyes as in his own, 
and when they went downstairs together their arms 
were across each other’s shoulders. 
But after so saying I pause and lay my hand on my 
mouth and am still. If I must not punish when I am 
angry, shall I, on the other hand, wait and seize upon 
my boy a number of hours later when he comes running 
up to me with a smile, and wallop him with calm, 
passionless conscientiousness? Or if I will not perform 
any corporal punishment, how shall I differentiate 
“moral suasion” from ordinary “ jawing”? Or if 
“ self-government ” be my fad, what shall I do when 
the child refuses to obey himself? Shall I make him 
205 Punishments 
 
-P-A-G-E-206
  THE BOY PROBLEM 
  obey me or shall I let him try the expensive and cir- 
cuitous way of his own mistakes? 
With your kind permission, let us now change the 
subject. 
Nothing is more beautiful about a child than his for- 
givingness. As the dog brings his wound to the master 
who has caused it, so, in sweet unconsciousness that he 
is magnanimous, the child clings to the parent who has 
spoken thoughtlessly or cruelly. Oh, for this, my child, 
forgive me, that I have so often deserved your for- 
giveness! And yet I need not pray so, for the child has 
forgiven without being asked and without reluctance. 
But the time is coming when that forgiveness is with- 
holden. Not that the boy would not like to pardon, but 
when he becomes a genuine personality the lad with the 
self-respect which personality implies, and a new sense 
of justice, as yet more sentimental than judicial, cannot 
forgive the wound to himself without consenting to his 
own soul-murder. Here is where the test of parent- 
hood comes. Here is where the insight of a parent is 
best shown, when he knows how to see that the issue is 
not obedience to the parent by the child any more, but 
the lad’s obedience to himself. In a sense it is true that 
after fourteen or so the child cannot obey another if he 
is ever to be more than a child. To break a will now 
is to break a life. The exercise of authority now for 
its own sake means the death of all kindly relations 
between parent and child forevermore. Here is where 
are played the saddest tragedies in some of the most 
Christian homes. 
During adolescence it seems to be a chief task of the 
parent, and especially of the father, to cling to the boy 
206
-P-A-G-E-207
  IN THE HOME 
  with a steady and friendly companionship, minimizing 
as far as possible nagging, faultfinding and volunteer 
advice, preparing for every occasion when guidance or 
rebuke is really necessary by the most careful review 
of the lad’s purposes and conduct from his own stand- 
point, honoring the boy’s sense of justice and his half- 
blown resolves and endeavors, and always keeping 
cheerful but not sarcastic, humorous but not witty and 
both impartial and generous in attitude. Occasionally 
there will be gleams of encouragement, as when the 
parent making a suggestion instead of a command has 
found that it was immensely more effective. For per- 
haps his son says timidly, ‘‘ Father, I wish you would 
tell me I can’t do this, instead of saying that you’d 
rather I’d not. If yow’d command me, I’d have the 
satisfaction of disobeying, but when I know what you 
want, I want to please you.” 
Happy the parent who has grace to 
wait while his child walks through the 
far country of disillusionment and until 
he returns home, no more a boy, but a man. Happy 
he who can outlast “ the equinoctial gales of youth” 
and then meet him with joy and welcome, and sit 
down with him as he clothes his old toys with new 
knowledge, and enjoy with him the dear-bought salvage 
of manhood. 
But, after all, there is one supreme grace of incarna- 
tion that we need, — the grace to suffer. At my best 
I shall misunderstand and I shall be misunderstood. 
The boys must make mistakes, they have a right to, but 
it is father and mother who will suffer because of 
them. They may go very far away from home, and the

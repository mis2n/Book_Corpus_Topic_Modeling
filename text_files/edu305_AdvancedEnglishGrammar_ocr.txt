PREFACE 
This grammar is intended for students who have already 
received instruction in the rudiments. Still, every such text- 
book must begin at the beginning. Part One, therefore, which 
occupies pp. 1-24, gives a succinct treatment of the Parts of 
Speech in the Sentence and of their substitutes, the Phrase 
and the Clause, concluding with a Summary of Definitions. 
Thus it clears the way for what follows, and may be utilized 
as a review, if the student needs to refresh his memory. 
Part Two deals specifically and fully with Inflections and 
Syntax (pp. 25-182). It includes also a chapter on the use of 
subordinate clauses as nouns, adjectives, and adverbs (pp. 157- 
162), as well as a chapter in which such clauses are logically 
classified in accordance with their particular offices in the 
expression of thought (pp. 163-182). 
Part Three (pp. 183-226) develops the subject of Analysis 
in its natural order, first explaining how sentences are put 
together, and then illustrating the process by which they may 
be resolved into their constituent parts. Modifiers and Com- 
plements are classified, and the so-called Independent Elements 
are discussed. There is added a special chapter on Combina- 
tions of Clauses, in which the grammatical and logical relations 
of codrdination and subordination are set forth, and their func- 
tions in the effective use of language are considered. This 
portion of the book, it is hoped, will be especially useful to 
students of English composition. — i 
- The Appendix furnishes lists of verbs, tables of conjuga- 
tion, rules for capitals and marks of punctuation, a summary 
of important rules of syntax, and a brief history of the English 
language.

iv PREFACE 
The Exercises (pp. 227-290) are collected at the end of the © 
text, so as not to break continuity. References prefixed to 
each, as well as page-numbers in the Table of Contents, enable 
the teacher to attach them, at will, to the topics which they 
concern. The passages for parsing, analysis, etc., have been 
carefully selected from a wide range of eminent British and 
American writers. The name of the author is often appended 
to the quotation, when the passage is particularly noteworthy 
either for its contents or its form. In most cases, however, this 
has not been done; but the student may always feel confident 
that he is occupying himself with specimens of English as ac- 
tually composed by distinguished authors. The constructive 
exercises call particular attention to those matters in which 
error is especially prevalent. 
An advanced grammar must aim to be serviceable in two 
ways. It should afford the means for continuous and system- 
atic study of the subject or of any part of it; and it should also 
be useful for reference in connection with the study of compo- 
sition and of literature. With this latter end in view, many 
notes and observations have been included, in smaller type, 
to show the nature and development of the various forms and 
constructions, and to point out differences between the usage of 
to-day and that which the student observes in Shakspere and 
other English classics. The fulness of the index makes it easy 
to find anything that the volume contains. 
In accordance with the desire of many teachers, certain 
topics of importance have been treated with unusual thorough- 
ness. Among these may be mentioned the uses of shall and 
will, should and would, the infinitive and the infinitive clause, 
conditional sentences, indirect discourse, and the combination 
of clauses in sentences of different kinds. ; 
The authors are indebted to several teachers for suggestions, 
and criticism. . Particular acknowledgment is due to Mr. Theo- 
dore ©. Mitchill, of the Jamaica: High School, New York, and 
Mr. C. L..-Hooper, of the Chicago Normal School.

INTRODUCTION 
LANGUAGE AND GRAMMAR 
I. Tue Nature or Laneuace 
Language is the expression of thought by means of spoken 
or written words. 
The English word language comes (through the French 
langue) from the Latin lingua, “the tongue.” But the tongue 
is not the only organ used in speaking. The lips, the teeth, 
the roof of the mouth, the soft palate (or uvula), the nose, and 
the vocal chords all help to produce the sounds of which lan- 
guage consists. These various organs make up one delicate and 
complicated piece of mechanism upon which the breath of the 
speaker acts like that of a musician upon a clarinet or other 
wind instrument. 
Spoken language, then, is composed of a great variety of 
sounds made with the vocal organs. A word may consist of 
one sound (as Ah/ or O or I), but most words consist of two 
or more different sounds (as go, see, try, finish). Long or short, 
however, a word is merely a sign made to express thought. 
Thought may be imperfectly expressed by signs made with 
the head, the hands, ete. Thus, if I grasp a person’s arm and 
point to a dog, he may understand me to ask, “Do you see that 
dog?” And his nod in reply may stand for “ Yes, I see him.” 
But any dialogue carried on in this way must be both fragmen- 
tary and uncertain. To express our thoughts fully, freely, and 
accurately, we must use words, — that is, signs made with the 
voice. Such voice-signs have had meanings associated with 
them by custom or tradition, so that their sense is at once 
xi
-P-A-G-E-12
  xii INTRODUCTION 
understood by all. Their advantage is twofold: they are far 
more numerous and varied than other signs; and the meanings 
attached to them are much more definite than those of nods 
and gestures, 
Written words are signs made with the pen to represent and 
recall to the mind the spoken words (or voice-signs). Written 
language (that.is, composition) must, of necessity, be somewhat 
fuller than spoken language, as well as more formal and exact. 
For the reader’s understanding is not assisted by the tones of 
the voice, the changing expressions of the face, and the lively 
gestures, which help to make spoken language intelligible. 
Most words are the signs of definite ideas. Thus, Charles, 
captain, cat, mouse, bread, stone, cup, ink, call up images or 
pictures of persons or things; strike, dive, climb, dismount, 
express particular kinds of action; green, blue, careless, rocky, 
triangular, muscular, enable us to describe objects with accu- 
racy. Even general terms like goodness, truth, cowrage, coward- 
ice, generosity, have sufficiently precise meanings, for they name 
qualities, or traits of character, with whicheverybody is familiar. 
By the use of such words, even when not combined in groups, 
we can express our thoughts much more satisfactorily than by 
mere gestures. The utterance of the single word “Charles!” 
may signify: “ Hullo, Charles! are you here ? I am surprised 
to see you.” “Bread!” may suggest to the hearer: “Give me 
bread! Iam very hungry.” “Courage!” may be almost equiv- 
alent to, “Don’t be down-hearted! Your troubles will soon 
be over.” 
Language, however, is not confined to the utterance of sin- 
gle words. To express our thoughts we must put words to- 
gether, — we must combine them into groups; and such groups 
have settled meanings (just as words have), established (like 
the meanings of single words) by the customs or habits of the 
particular language that we are speaking or writing. Further, 
these groups are not thrown together haphazard. We must con- 
struct them in accordance with certain fixed rules. Otherwise 
 
-P-A-G-E-13
  
THE NATURE OF LANGUAGE xiii 
we shall fail to express ourselves clearly and acceptably, and 
we may even succeed in saying the opposite of what we mean. 
In constructing these groups (which we call phrases, clauses, 
and sentences) we have the aid of a large number of short words 
like and, if, by, to, in, is, was, which are very different from 
the definite and picturesque words that we have just examined. 
They do not call up distinct images in the mind, and we should 
find it hard to define any of them. Yet their importance in 
the expression of thought is clear; for they serve to join other 
words together, and to show their relation to each other in 
those groups which make up connected speech. 
Thus, “ box heavy” conveys some meaning; but “ Zhe box 
is heavy” is a clear and definite statement. Zhe shows that 
some particular box is meant, and is enables us to make an 
assertion about it. And, in’ Charles and John are my brothers,” 
indicates that Charles and John are closely connected in my 
thought, and that what I say of one applies also to the other. 
Jf, in “ If Charles comes, I shall be glad to see him,” connects 
two statements, and shows that one of them is a mere supposi- 
tion (for Charles may or may not come). 
In grouping words, our language has three different ways 
of indicating their relations: (1) the forms of the words them- 
selves; (2) their order; (3) the use of little words like and, if, 
ts, etc. 
I. Change of form. Words may change their form. Thus 
the word boy becomes boys when more than one is meant; kill 
becomes killed when past time is referred to; was becomes 
were when we are speaking of two or more persons or things; 
fast becomes faster when a higher degree of speed is indicated. 
Such change of form is called inflection, and the word is said 
to be inflected. ’ 
Inflection is an important means of showing the relations of 
words in connected speech. In “ Henry’s racket weighs four- 
teen ounces,” the form Henry’s shows at once the relation 
between Henry and the racket, — namely, that Henry owns or
-P-A-G-E-14
  
  xiv INTRODUCTION 
possesses it. The word Henry, then, may change its form to 
Henry's to indicate ownership or possession. 
II. Order of words. In “John struck Charles,” the way in 
which the words are arranged shows who it was that struck, 
and who received the blow. Change the order of words to 
“Charles struck John,” and the meaning is reversed. It is, 
then, the order that shows the relation of John to struck, and 
of struck to Charles. 
III. Use of other words. Compare the two sentences : 
The train from Boston has just arrived. 
The train for Boston has just arrived. 
Here from and for show the relation between the train and 
Boston. “The Boston train ” might mean either the train from 
Boston or the train for Boston. By using from or for we make 
the sense unmistakable. 
Two matters, then, are of vital importance in language, — 
the forms of words, and the relations of words. The science 
which treats of these two matters is called grammar. 
Inflection is a change in the form of a word indicating some change 
in its meaning. y 
The relation in which a word stands to other words in the sentence 
is called its construction. 
Grammar is the science which treats of the forms and the constructions 
of words. 
Syntax is that department of grammar which treats of the construc- 
tions of words. 
Grammar, then, may be said to concern itself with two main 
subjects, — inflection and syntax. 
English belongs toa family of languages —the Indo-European 
Family '— which is rich in forms of inflection. This richness 
may be seen in other members of the family, —such as Greek 
or Latin. The Latin word homo, “ man,” for example, has 
1 For a brief history of the English language, see p. 316.
-P-A-G-E-15
  GRAMMAR AND USAGE xv. 
eight different inflectional forms, — homo, “a man”; hominis, 
“of aman”; homini, “to a man,” and so on. Thus, in Latin, 
the grammatical construction of a word is, in general, shown 
by that particular inflectional ending (or termination) which 
it has in any particular sentence. In the Anglo-Saxon period,* 
English was likewise well furnished with such inflectional 
endings, though not so abundantly as Latin. Many of these, 
however, had disappeared by Chaucer’s time (1340-1400), and 
still others have since been lost, so that modern English is one 
of the least inflected of languages. Such losses are not to be 
lamented. By due attention to the order of words, and by 
using of, to, for, from, in, and the like, we can express all the 
relations denoted by the ancient inflections. The gain in sim- 
plicity is enormous. 
II. Grammar AND UsacE 
Since language is the expression of thought, the rules of 
grammar agree, in the main, with the laws of thought. In 
other words, grammar is usually logical,—that is, its rules 
accord, in general, with the principles of logic, which is the 
science of exact reasoning. 
The rules of grammar, however, do not derive their authority 
from logic, but from good usage, —that is, from the customs 
or habits followed by educated speakers and writers.) These 
customs, of course, differ among different nations, and every 
language has therefore its own stock of peculiar constructions 
or turns of expression. Such peculiarities are called idioms. 
Thus, in English we say, “It is 1”; but in French the idiom 
is “C’est moi,” which corresponds to “It is me.” Many care- 
less speakers of English follow the French idiom in this par- 
ticular, but their practice has not yet come to be the accepted 
usage. Hence, though “C’est moi” is correct in French, we 
must still regard “It is me” as ungrammatical in English. It 
1 Compare pp. 316-317. 
 
-P-A-G-E-16
  xvi i INTRODUCTION 
would, however, become correct if it should ever be adopted 
by the great majority of educated persons. 
Grammar does not enact laws for the conduct of speech. Its 
business is to ascertain and set forth those customs of language 
which have the sanction of good usage. If good usage changes, 
the rules of grammar must change. If two forms or construc- 
tions are in good use, the grammarian must admit them both. 
Occasionally, also, there is room for difference of opinion. 
These facts, however, do not lessen the authority of grammar 
in the case of any cultivated language. For in such a language 
usage is so well settled in almost every particular as to enable 
the grammarian to say positively what is right and what is 
wrong. Even in matters of divided usage, it is seldom difficult 
to determine which of two forms or constructions is preferred 
by careful writers. 
Every language has two standards of usage, — the colloquial 
and the literary. By “colloquial language,” we mean the lan- 
guage of conversation; by “literary language,” that employed 
in literary composition. Everyday colloquial English admits 
many words, forms, phrases, and constructions that would be 
out of place in a dignified essay. On the other hand, it is an 
error in taste to be always “ talking like a book.” Unpractised 
speakers and writers should, however, be conservative. They 
should avoid, even in informal talk, any word or expression 
that is of doubtful propriety. Only those who know what they 
are about, can venture to take liberties. It is quite possible to 
be correct without being stilted or affected.t 
Every living language is constantly changing. Words, forms, 
and constructions become obsolete (that is, go out of use) and 
others take their places. Consequently, one often notes in the 
older English classics, methods of expression which, though 
formerly correct, are ungrammatical now. Here a twofold 
1In this book, well-established colloquial idioms or constructions are men- 
tioned from time to time, but always with a note as to their actual status in 
the language.

  SUMMARY OF GENERAL PRINCIPLES xvii 
caution is necessary. On the one hand, we must not criticise 
Shakspere or Chaucer for using the English of his own time ; 
but, on the other hand, we must not try to defend our own 
errors by appealing to ancient usage. 
Examples of constructions once in good use, but no longer admissible, 
are: ‘*the best of the two”? (for ‘tthe better of the two’’); ‘tthe most 
unkindest cut of all’’; ‘t There ’s two or three of us’ (for there are); ‘*I 
have forgot the map” (for forgotten) ; ‘‘ Every one of these letters are in 
my name” (for is); ‘tI think it be’? (for is). 
The language of poetry admits many old words, forms, and 
constructions that are no longer used in ordinary prose. These 
are called archaisms (that is, ancient expressions). Among the 
commonest archaisms are thou, ye, hath, thinkest, doth. Such 
forms are also common in prose, in what is known as the 
solemn style, which is modelled, in great part, on the language 
of the Bible. 
In general, it should be remembered that the style which 
one uses should be appropriate, — that is, it should fit the occa- 
sion: A short story and a scientific exposition will differ in 
style; a familiar letter will naturally shun the formalities of 
business or legal correspondence. Good style is not a necessary 
result of grammatical correctness, but without such correctness 
it is, of course, impossible. 
SUMMARY OF GENERAL PRINCIPLES 
1. Language is the expression of thought by means of spoken or 
written words. 
2. Words are the signs of ideas. 
Spoken words are signs made with the vocal organs; written 
words are signs made with the pen to represent the spoken words. 
1In this book, several old forms and constructions which the student is 
constantly encountering in the English classics are treated in their proper 
places, —always with an indication of their difference from the modern 
standard.  
-P-A-G-E-18
  
  xviii INTRODUCTION 
The meanings of these signs are settled by custom or tradition in 
each language. 
3. Most words are the signs of definite ideas: as, — Charles, cap- 
tain, cat, strike, dive, climb, triangular, careless. 
Other words, of less definite meaning, serve to connect the more 
definite words and to show their relations to each other in connected 
speech. 
4. In the expression of thought, words are combined into groups 
called phrases, clauses, and sentences. 
5. The relation in which a word stands to other words in the 
sentence is called its construction. 
The construction of Exglish words is shown in three ways: (1) by 
their form; (2) by their order; (3) by the use of other words like 
to, from, is, etc. 
6. Inflection is a change in the form of a word indicating some - 
change in its meaning: as, — boy, boy’s; man, men; drink, drank. 
7. Grammar is the science which treats of the forms and the 
constructions of words. 
Syntax is that department of grammar which treats of the con- 
structions of words. 
8. The rules of grammar derive their authority from good usage, 
— that is, from the customs or habits followed by educated speakers 
and writers.

PART ONE 
THE PARTS OF SPEECH IN 
THE SENTENCE 
Summary. The Sentence: Subject and Predicate; Kinds of Sentences. 
—Use of words in the Sentence: the Eight Parts of Speech; Infinitives 
and Participles. Comparative Importance of the Parts of Speech in the Sen- 
tence: the Subject Noun (or Simple Subject) ; the Predicate Verb (or Simple 
Predicate); Compound Subject and Predicate. — Substitutes for the Parts of 
Speech: Phrases; Clauses; Compound and Complex Sentences. 
THE SENTENCE 
1. A sentence is a group of words which expresses a complete 
thought. 
Fire burns. 
Wolves howl. 
Rain is falling. 
Charles is courageous. 
Patient effort removes mountains. 
London is the largest city in the world. 
A man who respects himself should never condescend 
to use slovenly language. 
Some of these sentences are short, expressing a very simple 
thought; others are comparatively long, because the thought 
is more complicated and therefore requires more words for its 
expression. But every one of them, whether short or long, is 
complete in itself. It comes to a definite end, and is followed 
by a full pause.
-P-A-G-E-20
  2 THE SENTENCE 
2. Every sentence, whether short or long, consists of two 
parts, —a subject and a predicate. 
The subject of a sentence designates the person, place, or thing that 
is spoken of; the predicate is that which is said of the subject. 
Thus, in the first example in § 1, the subject is fire and the predicate 
is burns. In the third, the subject is rain; the predicate, is falling. In 
the last, the subject is a man who respects himself; the predicate, should 
never condescend to use slovenly language. 
Either the subject or the predicate may consist of a single 
word or of a number of words. But neither the subject by 
itself nor the predicate by itself, however extended, is a sen- | 
tence. The mere mention of a thing (jive) does not express a 
complete thought. Neither does a mere assertion (wrns), if 
we neglect to mention the person or thing about which the 
assertion is made. Thus it appears that both a subject and a 
predicate are necessary to make a sentence. 
3. Sentences may be declarative, interrogative, imperative, or ex- 
clamatory. 
1. A declarative sentence declares or asserts something as a fact. 
Dickens wrote ‘t David Copperfield.” 
The army approached the city. 
2. An interrogative sentence asks a question. 
Who is that officer ? 
Does Arthur Moore live here ? 
3. An imperative sentence expresses a command or a request. 
Open the window. 
Pronounce the vowels more distinctly. 
4, An exclamatory sentence expresses surprise, grief, or some other 
emotion in the form of an exclamation or cry. 
How calm the sea is! 
What a noise the engine makes !
-P-A-G-E-21
  
THE PARTS OF SPEECH 3 
A declarative, an interrogative, or an imperative sentence is 
also exclamatory, if it is uttered in an intense or excited tone 
of voice. 
4. In imperative sentences, the subject (thow or you) is 
almost always omitted, because it is understood by both speaker 
and hearer without being expressed. 
Such omitted words, which are present (in idea) to the minds of both 
speaker and hearer, are said to be ‘“‘ understood.” Thus, in ‘‘Open the win- 
dow,” the subject is ‘you (understood).” If expressed, the subject would be 
emphatic : as, —‘* You open the window.” 
5. The subject of a sentence commonly precedes the predi- 
cate, but sometimes the predicate precedes. 
Here comes Tom. 
Next came Edward. 
Over went the carriage. 
A sentence in which the predicate precedes the subject is 
said to be in the inverted order. This order is especially common 
in interrogative sentences. 
Where is your boat ? 
When was your last birthday ? 
Whither wander you ? — SHaksPERE. 
THE PARTS OF SPEECH 
6. If we examine the words in any sentence, we observe 
that they have different tasks or duties to perform in the 
expression of thought. 
Savage beasts roamed through the forest. 
In this sentence, deasts and forest are the names of objects; 
roamed asserts action, telling us what the beasts did; savage 
describes the beasts; through shows the relation in thought be- 
tween forest and roamed ; the limits the meaning of forest, 
showing that one particular forest is meant. Thus each of 
these words has its special office (or function) in the sentence.
-P-A-G-E-22
  4 NOUNS AND PRONOUNS 
7. In accordance with their use in the sentence, words are divided into 
eight classes called parts of speech, — namely, nouns, pronouns, adjec- 
tives, verbs, adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions, and interjections. 
I. NOUNS 
8. A noun is the name of a person, place, or thing. 
Examprzes: Lincoln, William, Elizabeth, sister, engineer, Chicago, 
island, shelf, star, window, happiness, anger, sidewalk, courage, loss, 
song. 
Il. PRONOUNS 
9. A pronoun is a word used instead of a noun. It designates a per- 
son, place, or thing without naming it. 
In ‘tI am ready,’ the pronoun I is a convenient substitute for the 
speaker’s name. In “ You have forgotten your umbrella,” the pronouns 
you and your designate the person to whom one is speaking. 
Other pronouns are: he, his, him; she, hers, her; it, its; this, that; 
who, whose, whom, which ; myself, yourself, himself, themselves. 
Since pronouns stand for nouns, they enable us to talk about 
a person, place, or thing without constantly repeating the 
name. 
10. Nouns and pronouns are called substantives. 
Nouns and pronouns are very similar in their use. The dif- 
ference between them is merely that the noun designates a 
person, place, or thing by naming it, and that the pronoun 
designates, but does not name. Hence it is convenient to have a 
general term (substantive) to include both these parts of speech. 
11. The substantive to which a pronoun refers is called its antecedent. 
Frank introduced the boys to his father. [Frank is the antecedent of 
the pronoun his.] 
Eleanor is visiting her aunt. 
The book has lost its cover. 
The trappers sat round their camp fire. 
Washington and Franklin served their country in different ways. 
[Their has two antecedents, connected by and.]
-P-A-G-E-23
  ADJECTIVES 5 
Ill. ADJECTIVES 
12. An adjective is a word which describes or limits a substantive.1 
This it usually does by indicating some quality. 
An adjective is said to belong to the substantive which it describes or 
_ limits. 
13. An adjective limits a substantive by restricting the 
range of its meaning. 
The noun box, for example, includes a great variety of objects. If we 
say wooden box, we exclude boxes ‘of metal, of paper, etc. If we use a 
second adjective (small) and a third (square), we limit the size and the 
shape of the box. 
Most adjectives (like wooden, square, and small) describe as 
well as limit. Such words are called descriptive adjectives. 
We may, however, limit the noun box to a single specimen 
by means of the adjective this or that or the, which does not 
describe, but simply points out, or designates. Such words are 
called definitive adjectives.” 
Iv. VERBS 
14. A verb is a word which can assert something (usually an action) 
concerning a person, place, or thing.® 
The wind blows. Her jewels sparkled. 
The horses ran. Tom climbed a tree. . 
The fire blazed. The dynamite erploded. 
Some verbs express state or condition rather than action. 
The treaty still exists. 
The book lies on the table. 
Near the church stood an elm. 
My aunt suffers much from headache. 
1In the technical language of grammar an adjective is said to describe a 
substantive when it describes the object which the substantive denotes. 
2 Definitive adjectives are often called limiting adjectives. All adjectives, 
however, limit, even those that also describe. 
8 The usual brief definition of a verb is, ‘‘ A verb is a word which asserts.” 
But.this definition in strictness applies only to verbs in declarative sentences.  
-P-A-G-E-24
  6 VERBS 
15. A group of words may be needed, instead of a single 
verb, to make an assertion. 
A group of words that is used as a verb is called a verb-phrase. 
You will see. 
The tree has fallen. 
We might have invited her. 
Our driver has been discharged. 
16. Certain verbs, when used to make verb-phrases, are 
called auxiliary (that is, “aiding”) verbs, because they help 
other verbs to express action or state of some particular kind. 
Thus, in “ You will see,’ the auxiliary verb will helps see to express 
future action ; in ‘* We might have invited her,’ the auxiliaries might and 
have help invited to express action that was possible in past time. 
The auxiliary verbs are is (are, was, were, etc.), may, can, 
must, might, shall, will, could, would, should, have, had, do, 
did. Their forms and uses will be studied in connection with 
the inflection of verbs. 
The auxiliary verb regularly comes first in a verb-phrase, 
and may be separated from the rest of it by some other word 
or words.   Where was Washington born ? 
The boat was slowly but steadily approaching. 
17. Js (in its various forms) and several other verbs may 
be used to frame sentences in which some word or words in 
the predicate describe or define the subject. 
1. Gold is a metal. 
. Charles is my friend’s name. 
. The colors of this butterfly are brilliant. 
. Iron becomes red in the fire. 
. Our condition seemed desperate. 
. Bertram proved a good friend in this emergency. 
. My soul grows sad with troubles. —SHAKSPERE. ED TP wD 
In the first sentence, the verb is not only makes an assertion, 
but it also connects the rest of the predicate (a metal) with the
-P-A-G-E-25
  
ADVERBS if 
subject (gold) in such a way that a metal serves as a descrip- 
tion or definition of gold. 
In sentences 4-7, becomes, seemed, proved, and grows are 
similarly used. 
In such sentences is and other verbs that are used for the 
same purpose are called copulative (that is, “joining ”) verbs. 
Is in this use is often called the copula, that is, the ‘t joiner” or ‘‘ link.” 
The forms of the verb is are very irregular. Among the 
commonest are: am, is, are, was, were, and the verb-phrases 
has been, have been, had been, shall be, will be. 
Vv. ADVERBS 
18. An adverb is a word which modifies a verb, an adjective, or 
another adverb. 
To modify a word is to change or affect its meaning in some way. 
Thus in ‘t The river fell rapidly,” the adverb rapidly modifies the verb 
fell by showing how the falling took place. In ‘tI am never late,’’ ** This 
is absolutely true,’’ ‘‘ That is too bad,” the italicized words are adverbs 
modifying adjectives ; in ‘t He came very often,’’ '' He spoke almost hope- 
fully,” ‘* The river fell too rapidly,’’ they are adverbs modifying other 
adverbs. 
Most adverbs answer the question “How?” “ When?” 
“Where ?” or “To what degree or extent?” 
19. Observe that adverbs modify verbs in much the same 
way in which adjectives modify nouns. 
ADJECTIVES ADVERBS 
A bright fire burned. The fire burned brightly. 
A fierce wind blew. The wind blew fiercely. 
A word or group of words that changes or modifies the meaning of 
another word is called a modifier. 
Adjectives and adverbs, then, are both modifiers. Adjectives 
modify substantives; adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, or 
other adverbs.

-P-A-G-E-26
    8 PREPOSITIONS 
VI. PREPOSITIONS 
20. A preposition is a word placed before a substantive to show its 
relation to some other word in the sentence. 
The substantive which follows a preposition is called its object. 
A preposition is said to govern its object. 
In 't The surface of the water glistened,” of makes it clear that sur- 
face belongs with water. In ‘' Philip is on the river,’’ on shows Philip’s 
position with respect to the river. In, or near, or beyond would have 
indicated a different relation. Water is the object of the preposition of, 
and river is the object of the preposition on. 
21. A preposition often has more than one object. 
Over hill and dale he ran. 
He was filled with shame and despair. 
Vil. CONJUNCTIONS E 
22. A conjunction connects words or groups of words. 
A conjunction differs from a preposition in having no object, 
and in indicating a less definite relation between the words 
which it connects. 
In ‘Time and tide wait for no man,” ‘t The parcel was small but 
heavy,’’ ‘‘ He wore a kind of doublet or jacket,’ the conjunctions and, 
but, or, connect single words, — time with tide, small with heavy, doublet 
with jacket. In ‘tDo not go if you are afraid,”’ ‘tI came because you sent 
for me,”’ ** Take my key, but do not lose it,” 't Sweep the floor and dust 
the furniture,’’ each conjunction connects the entire group of words 
preceding it with the entire group following it. 
Vil. INTERJECTIONS 
23. An interjection is a cry or other exclamatory sound expressing 
surprise, anger, pleasure, or some other emotion or feeling. 
Interjections usually have no grammatical connection with 
the groups of words in which they stand; hence their name, 
which means “thrown in.” 
Exampres: Oh! I forgot. Ah, how I miss you! Bravo! Alas!
-P-A-G-E-27
  DIFFERENT PARTS OF SPEECH 9 
THE SAME WORD AS DIFFERENT PARTS OF SPEECH 
24. The meaning of a word in the sentence determines to what part 
of speech it belongs. 
The same word may be sometimes one part of speech, sometimes 
another. 
Words of entirely separate origin, meaning, and use some- 
times look and sound alike: as in “The minstrel sang a 
plaintive lay,” and “He day on the ground.” But the follow- 
ing examples (§ 25) show that the same word may have more 
than one kind of grammatical office (or function). It is the 
meaning which we give to a word in the sentence that determines 
s_a_part of speech. 
25. The chief classes of words thus variously used are 
(4) nouns_ and sdioore, os nouns and verbs, (3) adject 
    prepositions. | 
I. Nouns anp ADJECTIVES 
Nouns ADJECTIVES 
Rubber comes from South America, This wheel has a rubber tire. 
That brick is yellow. Here is a brick house.

The first two examples show how words that are commonly 
nouns may be used as adjectives; the third shows how words 
that are commonly adjectives may be used as nouns.

Consunction. You have plenty of time, for the train is late. 
Intersection. Hurrah! the battle is won. 
Noun. I heard a loud hurrah. 
‘VERB. The enemy flees. Our men hurrah. 
INFINITIVES AND PARTICIPLES 
26. Two classes of verb-forms illustrate in a striking way 
the fact that the same word may belong to different parts of 
speech; for they really belong to two different parts of speech 
at one and the same time. These are the infinitive (which is 
both verb and noun) and the participle (which is both verb and 
adjective). 
27. Examples of the infinitive may be seen in the following 
ntences : Fepeenees To struggle was useless. 
To escape is impossible. 
To exercise regularly preserves the health. 
To struggle is clearly a noun, for (1) it is the subject of the 
sentence, and (2) the noun effort or ewertion might be put in 
the plave of to struggle. Similarly, the noun escape might bé 
substituted for to escape ; and, in the third sentence, regular 
exercise (a noun modified by, an adjective) might be substituted 
for to exercise regularly. 
But these three forms (to struggle, to escape, and to exercise) 
are also verbs, for they express action, and one of them (¢o ex- 
ercise) is modified by an adverb (regularly). Such forms, there- 
fore, are noun-forms of the verb. They are classed with verbs, 
and are called infinitiyes,  
-P-A-G-E-30
  12 INFINITIVES AND PARTICIPLES 
28. The infinitive is a verb-form which partakes of the nature of a 
noun. It is commonly preceded by the preposition to, which is called the 
sign of the infinitive. 
29. The infinitive without to is used in a great variety of 
verb-phrases. 
I shall go. Mary may recite. 
John will win. Jack can swim. 
Such phrases will be studied in connection with the inflection 
of verbs. 
Norte. That go, win, recite, and swim are infinitives may be seen by com- 
paring the following sentences: —‘‘I intend to go,” ‘‘ John is sure to win,” 
“Mary is permitted to recite,” ‘‘ Jack is able to swim.” 
30. The following sentence contains two participles : — 
Shattered and slowly sinking, the frigate drifted out to sea. 
In this sentence, we recognize shattered as a form of the verb 
shatter, and sinking as a form of the verb sink. They both ex- 
press action, and sinking is modified by the adverb slowly. But 
shattered and sinking have also the nature of adjectives, for they 
are used to describe the noun frigate. Such words, then, are 
adjective forms of the verb. They are classed as verbs, and 
are called participles, because they share (or participate in) the 
nature of adjectives. 
81. The participle is a verb-form which has no subject, but which 
partakes of the nature of an adjective and expresses action or state in 
such a way as to describe or limit a substantive. 
A participle is said to belong to the substantive which it 
describes or limits. 
32. The chief classes of participles are present participles and 
past participles, so called from the time which they denote. 
All present participles end in ing. Past participles have 
several different endings, which will be studied in connection 
with the inflection of verbs (§ 334). 
 
-P-A-G-E-31
  \ 
SIMPLE AND COMPLETE SUBJECT 13 
33. Participles are-used in a variety of verb-phrases. 
Tom is coming. Your book is found. 
Our boat was wrecked. They have sold their horses. 
I have sent the money. You have broken your watch. 
He has brought me a letter. The ship had struck on the reef. 
Such phrases will be mere in connection with the inflection 
of verbs. 
Nore. The double nature of the infinitive (as both verb and noun) and 
the participle (as both verb and adjective) almost justifies one in classifying 
each as a distinct part of speech (so as to make ten parts of speech instead of 
eight). But it is more convenient to include them under the head of verbs, in 
accordance with the usual practice. 
SIMPLE AND COMPLETE SUBJECT AND PREDICATE 
34. Our survey of the eight parts of speech has shown, (1) 
that these have very different offices or functions in the sen- 
tence, and (2) that their functions are not of equal importance. 
Clearly, the most important parts of speech are substantives 
(nouns and pronouns) and verbs. 
Substantives enable us to name or designate persons, places, 
or things, and verbs enable us to make statements about them. 
Both substantives and verbs, then, are absolutely necessary in 
framing sentences. Without a substantive, there can be no 
subject ; without a verb, there can be no predicate: and both a 
subject and a predicate, as we have seen, are needed to make 
a sentence. 
Adjectives and adverbs are less important than substantives 
and verbs. Their function is to modify other parts of speech, 
that is, to change their meaning in some way. Thus adjectives 
modify substantives (by describing or limiting), and adverbs 
usually modify verbs (by indicating how, when, or where the 
action took place). Without substantives, there would be no 
use for adjectives; without verbs, there would be little use 
for adverbs.  
-P-A-G-E-32
  14 SIMPLE AND COMPLETE SUBJECT 
Prepositions and conjunctions are also less important than sub- 
stantives and verbs. Their office is to connect and to show 
relation. Of course, there would be no place for connectives 
if there were nothing to connect. 
Interjections are the least important of all. They add liveli- 
ness to language, but they are not actual necessities. We 
could express all the thoughts that enter our minds without 
ever using an interjection. 
35. A sentence may consist of but two words,—a noun or 
pronoun (the subject) and a verb (the predicate). Thus, — 
Charles | swims. 
Commonly, however, either the subject or the predicate, or 
both, will contain more than one word. Thus, — 
Young Charles | swims slowly. 
Here the complete subject (young Charles) consists of a noun 
(Charles) and an adjective (young), which describes Charles. 
The complete predicate consists of a verb (swims) and ar adverb 
(slowly), which modifies swim by indicating how the action is 
performed. The subject noun (Charles) and the predicate verb 
(swims) are the chief words in the sentence, for neither could 
be omitted without destroying it. They form, so to speak, the 
frame or skeleton of the whole. Either of the two modifiers, 
the adjective or the adverb, or both, might be omitted, with- 
out destroying the sentence; for this would still exist as the 
expression of a thought (Charles swims), though the thought 
would be less definite and exact than it is when the modifiers 
are included. 
36. The simple subject of a sentence is a noun or pronoun. 
The simple predicate of a sentence is a verb or verb-phrase. 
The simple subject, with such words as explain or complete its mean- 
ing, forms the complete subject. 
The simple predicate, with such words as explain or complete its 
meaning, forms the complete predicate.
-P-A-G-E-33
  SIMPLE AND COMPLETE PREDICATE 15 
In each of the following sentences the complete subject and 
the complete predicate are separated by a vertical line, and the 
simple subject and the simple predicate are printed in italics :— 
The spider | spreads her web. 
The fiery smoke | rose upward in billowing volumes. 
A nameless unrest | urged me forward. 
Our frantic horses | swept round an angle of the road. 
The infirmities of age | came early upon him, 
The general feeling among the English in Bengal | was strongly in 
favor of the Governor General. 
Salutes | were fired from the batteries. 
The Clives | had been settled ever since the twelfth century on an 
estate of no-great value near Market Drayton in Shropshire. 
I | have written repeatedly to Mr. Hobhouse. 
37. Two or more simple subjects may be joined to make 
one compound subject, and two or more simple predicates to 
make one compound predicate. 
. Charles and Henry | play tennis well.

38. A compound subject or predicate consists of two or more simple 
subjects or predicates, joined, when necessary, by conjunctions. 
Either the subject or the predicate, or both, may be compound. 
In the first example in § 37, two simple subjects (Charles 
and Henry) are joined by the conjunction and to make a com- 
pound subject. In the fourth, four substantives (hats, caps, 
boots, gloves) form a series in which the last two are joined by 
and. In the fifth, sixth, and seventh, the predicates are com- 
pound; in the eighth, both the subject and the predicate. 
39. The following conjunctions may be used to join the mem- 
bers of a compound subject or predicate: and (both ... and), 
or (either... or; whether... or), nor (neither... nor).

PHRASES 
40. A group of words may take the place of a part of speech. 
The Father of Waters is the Mississippi. 
A girl with blue eyes stood at the window. 
You are looking well. 
The Father of Waters is used as a noun, since it names something. 
With blue eyes takes the place of an adjective (blue-eyed), and modifies 
girl. 
At the window indicates, as an adverb might, where the girl stood, 
and modifies stood. 
Are looking could be replaced by the verb look. 
41. A group of connected words, not containing a subject and a 
predicate, is called a phrase. 
A phrase is often equivalent to a part of speech. 
1. A phrase used as a noun is called a noun-phrase. 
2. A phrase used as a verb is called a verb-phrase. 
3. A phrase used as an adjective is called an adjective phrase. 
4, A phrase used as an adverb is called an adverbial phrase. 
In the examples in § 40, The Father of Waters is a noun-phrase ; with 
blue eyes, an adjective phrase ; at the window, an adverbial phrase ; are 
looking, a verb-phrase. 
42. Many adjective and adverbial phrases consist of a 
preposition and its object, with or without other words. 
Your umbrella is én the corner. 
He has a heart of oak. 
A cup with a broken handle stood on the shelf. 
My house of cards fell to the floor in a heap. 
Adjective or adverbial phrases consisting of a preposition and its ob- 
ject, with or without other words, may be called prepositional phrases. 
CLAUSES — COMPOUND AND COMPLEX SENTENCES 
48. Phrases must be carefully distinguished from clauses. 
The difference is that a clause contains a subject and a predicate 
and a phrase does not. 
 
-P-A-G-E-35
  
CLAUSES 17 
44. A clause is a group of words that forms part of a sentence and 
that contains a subject and a predicate. 
The lightning flashed | and | the thunder roared. 
The train started | when the bell rang. 
Each of these sentences contains two clauses; but the relation 
between the clauses in the first sentence is very different from 
that between the clauses in the second. 
In the first example, each of the two clauses makes a sepa- 
rate and distinct statement, and might stand by itself as a 
simple sentence, — that is, as a sentence having but one subject 
and one predicate. These clauses are joined by the conjunction 
and, which is not a part of either. No doubt the speaker feels 
that there is some relation in thought between the two state- 
ments, or he would not have put them together as clauses in 
the same sentence. But there is nothing in the form of expres- 
sion to show what that relation is. In other words, the two 
clauses are grammatically independent, for neither of them modi- 
fies (or affects the meaning of) the other. The clauses are 
therefore said to be codrdinate, — that is, of the same “ order” 
or rank, and the sentence is called compound. 
In the second example, on the contrary, the relation between 
the two clauses is indicated with precision. One clause (the 
train started) makes the main statement, — it expresses the 
chief fact. Hence it is called the main (or principal) clause. 
The other clause (when the bell rang) is added because the 
speaker wishes to modify the main verb (started) by defining 
the time of the action. This clause, then, is used as a part of 
speech. Its function is the same as that of an adverb (promptly) 
or an adverbial phrase (on the stroke of the bell). For this pur- 
pose alone it exists, and not as an independent statement. Hence 
it is called a dependent (or subordinate) clause, because it depends 
(that is, “ hangs”) upon the main clause, and so occupies a lower 
or “ subordinate” rank in the sentence. When thus constructed, 
a sentence is said to be complex. 
 
-P-A-G-E-36
  18 CLAUSES 
45. An ordinary compound sentence (as we have seen in § 44) 
is made by joining two or more simple sentences, each of which 
thus becomes an independent codrdinate clause. 
In the same way we may join two or more complex sentences, 
using them as clauses to make one compound sentence : — 
The train started when the bell rang, | and | Tom watched until the 
last car disappeared. 
This sentence is manifestly compound, for it consists of two 
coérdinate clauses (the train started when the bell rang; Tom 
watched until the last car disappeared) joined by and. Each 
of these two clauses is itself complex, for each could stand by 
itself as a complex sentence. 
Similarly, a complex and a simple sentence may be joined as 
coérdinate clauses to make a compound sentence. ° 
The train started when the bell rang, | and | Tom gazed after it in 
despair. 
Such a sentence, which is compound in its structure, but in 
which one or more of the codrdinate clauses are complex, is 
called a compound complex sentence.' 
46. A clause is a group of words that forms part of a sentence and 
that contains a subject and a predicate. 
A clause used as a part of speech is called a subordinate clause. All 
ie. clauses are said to be independent. 
Clauses of the same order or rank are said to be codrdinate. 
Sentences may be simple, compound, or complex. 
1. A simple sentence has but one subject and one predicate, either or 
both of which may be compound. 
2. A compound sentence consists of two or more independent codr- 
dinate clauses, which may or may not be joined by conjunctions. 
8. A complex sentence consists of two or more clauses, one of which 
is independent and the rest subordinate. 
A compound sentence in which one or more of the codrdinate clauses 
are complex is called a compound complex sentence. 
1 Compound complex sentences are also called complex compound sentences. 
For further treatment of such sentences, see pp. 187, 190, 215-216.

Ciauses As Parts or SPEECH 
47. Subordinate clauses, like phrases, are used as parts of speech. 
They serve as substitutes for nouns, for adjectives, or for adverbs. 
1. A subordinate clause that is used as a noun is called a noun (or 
substantive) clause. 
2. A subordinate clause that modifies a Boe Tele is called an 
adjective clause. 
8. A subordinate clause that serves as an adverbial modifier is called 
an adverbial clause.

The thought in these two sentences is the same, but in the sec- 
ond it is more fully expressed. In the first sentence, the subject 
is the noun success ; in the second, the subject is the noun clause, 
that we should succeed in this plan. This clause is introduced 
by the conjunction that ; the simple subject of the clause is the 
pronoun we, and the simple predicate is the verb-phrase should 
succeed. The first sentence is simple; the second is complex. 
Substantive clauses are often introduced by the conjunction 
that.

Norn. The use of phrases and clauses as parts of speech increases enor- 
mously the richness and power of language. Though English has a huge stock 
of words, it cannot provide a separate noun or adjective or adverb for every 
idea. By grouping words, however, in phrases and clauses we, in effect, make 
a great variety of new nouns, adjectives, and adverbs, each precisely fitted to 
the needs of the moment in the expression of thought. 
SUMMARY OF DEFINITIONS 
Tue SENTENCE 
1. Language is thought expressed in words. 
2. To express thought words are combined into sentences. 
3. A sentence is a group of words which expresses a complete 
thought. 
4. Sentences may be declarative, interrogative, imperative, or 
exclamatory. 
(1) A declarative sentence declares or asserts something as a fact. 
(2) An interrogative sentence asks a question. 
(8) An imperative sentence expresses a command or a request. 
(4) An exclamatory sentence expresses surprise, grief, or some 
other emotion in the form of an exclamation or cry. 
A declarative, an interrogative, or an imperative sentence may also 
be exclamatory. 
 
-P-A-G-E-40
  22 SUMMARY OF DEFINITIONS 
SuBsEcT AND PREDICATE 
5. Every sentence consists of a subject and a predicate. 
The subject of a sentence designates the person, place, or thing that 
is spoken of ; the predicate is that which is said of the subject. 
6. The simple subject of a sentence is a noun or pronoun. 
The simple predicate of a sentence is a verb or verb-phrase. 
7. The simple subject, with such words as explain or complete its 
meaning, forms the complete subject. 
The simple predicate, with such words as explain or complete its 
meaning, forms the complete predicate. 
8. A compound subject or predicate consists of two or more simple 
subjects or predicates, joined, when necessary, by conjunctions. 
Either the subject or the predicate, or both, may be compound. 
Tue Parts or SPEECH 
9. In accordance with their use in the sentence, words are divided 
into eight classes called parts of speech,—mnamely, nouns, pro- 
nouns, adjectives, verbs, adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions, and 
interjections. 
(1) A noun is the name of a person, place, or thing. 
(2) A pronoun is a word used instead of a noun. It designates a 
person, place, or thing without naming it. 
Nouns and pronouns are called substantives. 
The substantive to which a pronoun refers is called its antecedent. 
(3) An adjective is a word which describes or limits a substantive. 
This it usually does by indicating some quality. 
An adjective is said to belong to the substantive which it describes 
or limits. 
An adjective which describes is called a descriptive adjective; one 
which points out or designates is called a definitive adjective. 
(4) A verb is a word which can assert something (usually an 
action) concerning a person, place, or thing. 
Some verbs express state or condition rather than action. 
A group of words that is used as a verb is called a verb-phrase. 
Certain verbs, when used to make verb-phrases, are called auxiliary 
(that is, “aiding ”) verbs, because they help other verbs to express 
action or state of some particular kind.
-P-A-G-E-41
  SUMMARY OF DEFINITIONS 23 
Ts (in its various forms) and several other verbs may be used to 
frame sentences in which some word or words in the predicate de- 
scribe or define the subject. In such sentences, is and other verbs 
that are used for the same purpose are called copulative (that is, 
“joining ”) verbs. 
(5) An adverb is a word which modifies a verb, an adjective, or 
another adverb. 
A word or group of words that changes or modifies the meaning 
of another word is called a modifier. 
Adjectives and adverbs are both modifiers. 
(6) A preposition is a word placed before a substantive to show 
its relation to some other word in the sentence. 
The substantive which follows a preposition is called its object. 
(7 A conjunction connects words or groups of words. 
(8) An interjection is a cry or other exclamatory sound express- 
ing surprise, anger, pleasure, or some other emotion or feeling. 
10. The meaning of a word in the sentence determines to what 
part of speech it belongs. 
The same word may be sometimes one part of speech, sometimes 
another. 
11. The infinitive is a verb-form which partakes of the nature of 
a noun. It iscommonly preceded by the preposition to, which is called 
the sign of the infinitive. 
12. The participle is a verb-form which has no subject, but which 
partakes of the nature of an adjective and expresses action or state 
in such a way as to describe or limit a substantive. 
A participle is said to belong to the substantive which it describes 
or limits. 
The chief classes of participles are present participles and past 
participles, so called from the time which they denote.

PART TWO 
INFLECTION AND SYNTAX 
CHAPTER I 
INFLECTION 
52. Inflection is a change of form in a word indicating some change 
in its meaning. A word thus changed in form is said to be inflected. 
Thus the nouns man, wife, dog, may change their form to man’s, wife’s, 
dog’s, to express possession ; or to men, wives, dogs, to show that two or 
more are meant. 
The pronouns J, she, may change their form to our, her. 
The adjectives large, happy, good, may change their form to larger, 
happier, better, to denote a higher degree of the quality ; or to largest, 
happiest, best, to denote the highest degree. 
The verbs look, see, sing, may change their form to looked, saw, sang, 
to denote past time. 
The examples show that a word may be inflected (1) by the 
addition of a final letter or syllable (dog, dogs ; look, looked), 
(2) by the substitution of one letter for another (man, men), 
or (3). by a complete change of form (good, better, best). 
53. The inflection of a substantive is called its declension; 
that of an adjective or an adverb, its comparison; that of a 
verb, its conjugation. 
Nore. Some forms which we regard as due to inflection are really distinct 
words. Thus we is regarded as a form of the pronoun J, but it is in fact an 
altogether different word. Such irregularities, however, are not numerous, 
and are properly enough included under the head of inflection.

COMMON NOUNS AND PROPER NOUNS 27 
CHAPTER I 
NOUNS 
CLASSIFICATION — COMMON NOUNS AND PROPER NOUNS 
54. A noun is the name of a person, place, or thing. 
55. Nouns are divided into two classes — proper nouns and common 
nouns. 
1. A proper noun is the name of a particular person, place, or thing. 
Examptes: Lincoln, Napoleon, Ruth, Gladstone, America, Denver, 
Jove, Ohio, Monday, December, Yale, Christmas, Britannia, Niagara, 
Merrimac, Elmwood, Louvre, Richardson, Huron, Falstaff. 
2. A common noun is a name which may be applied to any one of a 
class of persons, places, or things. 
Exampres: general, emperor, president, clerk, street, town, desk, 
tree, cloud, chimney, childhood, idea, thought, letter, dynamo, cruiser, 
dictionary, railroad. 
Proper nouns begin with a capital letter; common nouns 
usually begin with a small letter. 
Nore. Although a proper noun is the name of a particular person, place, 
or thing, that name may be given to more than one individual. More than one 
man is named James; but when we say James, we think of one particular 
person, whom we are calling by his own name. When we say man, on the 
contrary, we are not calling any single person by name: we are using a noun 
which applies, in common, to all the members of a large class of persons. 
Any word, when mentioned merely as a word, is a noun. 
Thus, — 
And is a conjunction. 
56. A common noun becomes a proper noun when used as 
the particular name of a ship, a newspaper, an animal, ete. 
Nelson’s flagship was the Victory, 
Give me this evening’s Herald. 
My dog is named Rover. 
The Limited Express is drawn by the Pioneer. 
 
-P-A-G-E-46
    28 NOUNS 
57. A proper noun often consists of a group of words, some 
of which are perhaps ordinarily used as other parts of speech. 
Examp.es: James Russell Lowell, Washington Elm, Eiffel Tower, 
Firth of Clyde, North Lexington Junction, Stony Brook, Westminster 
Abbey, Measure for, Measure, White House, Brooklyn Bridge, Atlantic 
Railroad, Sherman Act, The Return of the Native, Flatiron Building. 
Norr. These are (strictly speaking) noun-phrases (§ 41); but, since all are 
particular names, they may be regarded as proper nouns. 
58. A proper noun becomes a common noun when used as a 
name that may be applied to any one of a class of objects. 
The museum owns two Rembrandts and a Titian. 
I exchanged my old motor car for a new Halstead. 
My fountain pen is a Blake. 
Lend me your Webster. 
He was a Napoleon of finance. 
I am going to buy a Kazak. 
59. Certain proper nouns have become common nouns when 
used in a special sense. These generally begin with a small 
letter. 
Exampies : macadam (crushed stone for roads, so called from Mac- 
adam, the inventor), mackintosh (a waterproof garment), napoleon (a 
coin), guinea (twenty-one shillings), mentor (a wise counsellor), derrin- 
ger (a kind of pistol). 
60. A lifeless object, one of the lower animals, or any human 
quality or emotion is sometimes regarded as a person. 
This usage is called personification, and the object, animal, or 
quality is said to be personified. 
Each old poetic Mountain 
Inspiration breathed around. — Gray. 
Who’!ll toll the bell ? 
*t],”? said the Bull, 
** Because I can pull.’ 
His name was Patience. — Spmnser.  
-P-A-G-E-47
  
SPECIAL CLASSES OF NOUNS 29 
Smiles on past Misfortune’s brow 
Soft Reflection’s hand can trace ; 
And o’er the cheek of Sorrow throw 
A melancholy grace. — Gray. 
Love is and was my lord and king, 
And in his presence I attend. — Tennyson. 
Time gently shakes his wings. —Drypen. 
The name of anything personified is regarded as a proper 
noun and is usually written with a capital letter. 
Nore. The rule for capitals is not absolute. When the personification is 
kept up for only a sentence or two (as frequently in Shakspere), the noun 
often begins with a small letter. 
SPECIAL CLASSES OF NOUNS 
61. An abstract noun is the name of a quality or general idea. 
Examptes: blackness, freshness, smoothness, weight, height, length, 
depth, strength, health, honesty, beauty, liberty, eternity, satisfaction, 
precision, splendor, terror, disappointment, elegance, existence, grace, 
peace. 
Many abstract nouns are derived from adjectives. 
Examptes: greenness (from green), depth (from deep), freedom (from 
free), wisdom (from wise), rotundity (from rotund), falsity or falseness 
(from false), bravery (from brave). 
62. A collective noun is the name of a group, class, or multitude, 
and not of a single person, place, or thing. 
Examp.es: crowd, group, legislature, squadron, sheaf, battalion, 
squad, Associated Press, Mediterranean Steamship Company, Senior 
Class, School Board. 
The same noun may be abstract in one of its meanings, 
collective in another. 
They believe in fraternity. [Abstract.] 
The student joined a fraternity. [Collective.]
-P-A-G-E-48
    30 NOUNS 
63. Abstract nouns are usually common, but become proper 
when the quality or idea is personified (§ 60). 
Collective nouns may be either proper or common. 
64. A noun consisting of two or more words united is called a com- 
pound noun. 
Exampres: (1) common nouns, —tablecloth, sidewalk, lampshade, 
bedclothes, steamboat, fireman, washerwoman, jackknife, hatband, 
headache, flatiron, innkeeper, knife-edge, steeple-climber, brother-in- 
law, commander-in-chief, window curtain, insurance company ; (2) proper 
nouns,—Johnson, Williamson, Cooperstown, Louisville, Holywood, Elk- 
horn, Auburndale, Stratford-on-Avon, Lowell Junction. 
As the examples show, the parts of a compound noun may be 
joined (with or without a hyphen) or written separately. In some 
words usage is fixed, in others it varies. The hyphen, however, is 
less used than formerly. 
Norr. The first part of a compound noun usually limits the second after the 
manner of an adjective. Indeed, many expressions may be regarded either 
(1) as compounds or (2) as phrases containing an adjective and a noun. Thus 
railway conductor may be taken as a compound noun, or as a noun (conductor) 
limited by an adjective (railway). 
INFLECTION OF NOUNS 
65. In studying the inflection of nouns and pronouns we 
have to consider gender, number, person, and case. 
1. Gender is distinction according to sex. 
2. Number is that property of substantives which shows whether 
they indicate one person or thing or more than one. 
8. Person is that property of substantives which shows whether they 
~ designate (1) the speaker, (2) the person spoken to, or (3) the person or 
thing spoken of. 
. Substantives have inflections of case to indicate their grammatical 
relations to verbs, to prepositions, or to other substantives. 
These four properties of substantives are included under inflection for con- 
venience. In strictness, however, nouns are inflected for number and case 
only. Gender is shown in various ways,—usually by the meaning of the 
noun or by the use of some pronoun. Person is indicated by the sense, by 
the pronouns used, and by the form of the verb.
-P-A-G-E-49
  
GENDER 31 
I. GENDER 
66. Gender is distinction according to sex. 
Nouns and pronouns may be of the masculine, the feminine, or the 
neuter gender. 
1. A noun or pronoun denoting a male being is of the masculine 
gender. 
Examptes: Joseph, boy, cockerel, buck, footman, butler, brother, 
father, uncle, he. 
2. A noun or pronoun denoting a female being is of the feminine 
gender. 
Examrtes: girl, Julia, hen, waitress, maid, doe, spinster, matron, 
aunt, squaw, she. 
8. A noun or pronoun denoting a thing without animal life is of the 
neuter gender. 
Examptss : pencil, light, water, star, book, dust, leaf, it. 
A noun or pronoun which is sometimes masculine and some- 
times feminine is often said to be of common gender. 
Examp es: bird, speaker, artist, animal, cat, European, musician, 
operator, they. 
67. A pronoun must be in the same gender as the noun for which it 
stands or to which it refers. 
Each of the following pronouns is limited to a single gender: 
MascunineE : he, his, him. 
Feminine : she, her, hers. 
Neuter: it, its. 
All other pronouns vary in gender. 
Robert greeted his employer. [Masculine.] 
A mother passed with her child. [Feminine.] 
This tree has lost its foliage. [Neuter.] 
Who laughed ? [Masculine or feminine.] 
How do you do? [Masculine or feminine.] 
They have disappeared. [Masculine, feminine, or neuter.] 
I do not care for either. [Masculine, feminine, or neuter.]

68. A neuter noun may become masculine or feminine by 
personification (§ 60). 
Thou who didst waken from his summer dreams 
The blue Mediterranean. — SHELLEY. 
Stern daughter of the Voice of God! 
O Duty !— Worpswortn. 
Nature from her seat 
Sighing through all her works, gave signs of woe. — Miron. 
69. In speaking of certain objects, such as a ship and the 
moon, it is customary to use she and her. In like manner, he 
is used in speaking of the sun and of most animals, without 
reference to sex, although i¢ often designates an insect or other 
small creature, and even a very young child. 
Who and which are both used in referring to the lower ani- 
mals. Which is the commoner, but who is not infrequent, espe- 
cially if the animal is thought of as an intelligent being. 
Thus one would say, ‘‘The dog which is for sale‘is in that kennel,” 
even if one added, ‘‘ He is a collie.’’ But which would never be used in 
such a sentence as, ‘tI have a dog who loves children.” 
70. The gender of masculine and of feminine nouns may be 
‘shown in various ways. 
1 iThe male and the female of many kinds or classes of living 
beings are denoted by different words.

GENDER 33 
2. Some masculine nouns become feminine by the addition 
of an ending.

heir heiress executor executrix 
baron. baroness administrator administratrix 
lion lioness hero heroine 
prince princess Joseph Josephine 
emperor empress sultan sultana

Nor. The feminine gender is often indicated by the ending ess. Fre- 
quently the corresponding masculine form ends in or or er: as, —actor, 
actress; governor, governess; waiter, waitress. The ending ess is not so 
common as formerly. Usage favors proprietor, author, editor, etc., even for 
the feminine (rather than the harsher forms proprietress, authoress, editress), 
whenever there is no special reason for emphasizing the difference of sex. 
8. A few feminine words become masculine by the addition 
of an ending. Thus,— widow, widower ; bride, bridegroom. 
4. Gender is sometimes indicated by the ending man, woman, 
maid, boy, or girl. 
Examptes: salesman, saleswoman ; foreman, forewoman ; laundry- 
man; milkmaid ; cash boy, cash girl. 
5. A noun or a pronoun is sometimes prefixed to a noun to 
indicate gender. 
EXAMPLEs: manservant, maidservant ; mother bird; cock sparrow, 
hen sparrow ; boy friend, girl friend ; he-wolf, she-wolf. 
6. The gender of a noun may be indicated by some accom- 
panying part of speech, usually by a pronoun. 
My cat is always washing his face. 
The intruder shook her head. 
I was confronted by a pitiful creature, haggard and wnshaven. 
Nors. The variations in form studied under 2 and 3 (above) are often re- 
garded as inflections. In reality, however, the masculine and the feminine 
are different words. Thus, baroness is not an inflectional form of baron, but a 
distinct noun, made from baron by adding the ending ess, precisely as barony 
and baronage are made from baron by adding the endings y and age. The 
process is rather that of derivation or noun-formation than that of inflection.

Il. NUMBER 
71. Number is that property of substantives which shows whether 
they indicate one person, place, or thing or more than one. 
There are two numbers, — the singular and the plural. 
The singular number denotes but one person, place, or thing. The 
plural number denotes more than one person, place, or thing. 
72. Most nouns form the plural number by adding s or es to the 
singular. 
EXxaMpPLes: mat, mats; wave, waves; problem, problems; bough, 
boughs ; John, Johns; nurse, nurses; tense. tenses; bench, benches ; 
dish, dishes ; class, classes ; fox, foxes. 
Srecrat Ruies 
1. If the singular ends in s, a, 2, ch, or sh, the plural end- 
ing is es. 
Examp ss: loss, losses; box, boxes; buzz, buzzes; match, matches ; 
rush, rushes. 
2. Many nouns ending in o preceded by a consonant also 
take the ending es in the ‘plural. 
Exampres: hero, heroes; cargo, cargoes; potato, potatoes; motto, 
mottoes ; buffalo, buffaloes ; mosquito, mosquitoes. 
3. Nouns ending in o preceded by a vowel form their plural 
in s: as,—cameo, cameos ; folio, folios. 
4. The following nouns ending in o preceded by a consonant 
also form their plural in s : — 
banjo casino dynamo memento! quarto torso 
bravo chromo halo? octavo solo tyro 
burro contralto junto piano soprano zero 
canto duodecimo lasso proviso stiletto 
73. In some nouns the addition of the plural ending alters 
the spelling and even the sound of the singular form. 
1 Halo, memento, zero also form a plural in es (haloes, etc.).
-P-A-G-E-53
  NUMBER 35 
1. Nouns ending in y preceded by a consonant change y to 
i and add es in the plural. 
Examp tes: sky, skies; fly, flies; country, countries; berry, berries. 
(Contrast: valley, valleys; chimney, chimneys; monkey, monkeys; boy, 
boys; day, days.) 
Most proper names ending in y, however, take the plural in s. 
Examptes: Mary, Marys; Murphy, Murphys; Daly, Dalys; Rowley, 
Rowleys; May, Mays. 
2. Some nouns ending in f or fe, change the f to v and 
add es or s. 
Exametes: wharf, wharves; wife, wives; shelf, shelves; wolf, 
wolves; thief, thieves; knife, knives; half, halves; calf, calves; life, 
lives ; self, selves ; sheaf, sheaves ; loaf, loaves ; leaf, leaves ; elf, elves ; 
beef, beeves. 
74. A few nouns form their plural in en. 
These are : ox, oxen ; brother, brethren (or brothers) ; child, children. 
Nore. Ancient or poetical plurals belonging to this class are: eyne (for 
eyen, from eye), kine (cows), shoon (shoes), hosen (hose). 
75. A few nouns form their plural by a change of vowel. 
These are: man, men; woman, women; merman, mermen ; foot, feet ; 
tooth, teeth; goose, geese ; mouse, mice; louse, lice. Also compound 
words ending in man or woman, such as fireman, firemen ; saleswoman, 
saleswomen ; Dutchman, Dutchmen. 
Nore. German, Mussulman, Ottoman, dragoman, firman, and talisman, 
which are not compounds of man, form their plurals regularly: as,— Germans, 
Mussulmans. Norman also forms its plural in s. 
76. A few nouns have the same form in both singular and 
plural. 
Examptes: deer, sheep, heathen, Japanese, Portuguese, Iroquois. 
Nors. This class was larger in older English than at present. It included, 
for example, year, which in Shakspere has two plurals: — ‘six thousand 
years,” “twelve year since.”

81. When a proper name with the title Mr., Mrs., Miss, or 
Master, is put into the plural, the rules are as follows : — 
1. The plural of Mr. is Messrs. (pronounced Messers*). The 
name remains in the singular. Thus, — 
Mr. Jackson, plural Messrs. (or the Messrs.) Jackson. 
2. Mrs. has no plural. The name itself takes the plural 
form. Thus, — 
Mrs. Jackson, plural the Mrs. Jacksons. 
3. In the case of Miss, sometimes the title is put into the 
plural, sometimes the name. Thus, — 
Miss Jackson, plural the Misses Jackson or the Miss Jacksons. 
The latter expression is somewhat informal. Accordingly, it would not be 
used in a formal invitation or reply, or in addressing a letter. 
4. The plural of Master is Masters. The name remains in 
the singular. Thus, — 
Master Jackson, plural the Masters Jackson. 
Other titles usually remain in the singular, the name taking the plural 
form: as, — the two General Follansbys. But when two or more names follow, 
the title becomes plural: as,— Generals Rolfe and Johnson. 
82. Some nouns, on account of their meaning, are seldom or 
never used in the plural. 
Such are many names of qualities (as cheerfulness, mirth), of sciences 
(as chemistry *), of forces (as gravitation). 
Many nouns, commonly used in the singular only, may take 
a plural in some special sense. Thus, — 
earth (the globe) earths (kinds of soil) 
ice (frozen water) ices (food) 
tin (a metal) tins (tin dishes or cans) 
nickel (a metal) nickels (coins) 
1 Messrs. is an abbreviation of the French messieurs. 
2 When such nouns as chemistry refer to textbooks, they may be used in 
the plural: as, —‘‘ Bring your chemistries to-morrow.”
-P-A-G-E-57
  
PERSON 39 
83. Some nouns are used in the plural only. 
Such are: annals, athletics, billiards, dregs, eaves, entrails, lees, 
nuptials, oats, obsequies, pincers, proceeds, riches, scissors, shears, suds, 
tweezers, tongs, trousers, victuals, vitals; and (in certain special senses) 
ashes, goods, links, scales, spectacles, stocks. 
84. A few nouns are plural in form, but singular in meaning. 
Such are: gallows, news, measles, mumps, small pox (for small pocks), 
politics, and some names of sciences (as, civics, economics, ethics, mathe- 
matics, physics, optics). 
Nor. These nouns were formerly plural in sense as well as in form. News, 
for example, originally meant ‘new things.” Shakspere uses it both as a sin-" 
gular and as a plural. Thus, —‘* This news was brought to Richard” (King 
John, v. 3.12); But wherefore do I tell these news to thee?” (1 Henry IV, 
iii. 2. 121). In a few words modern usage varies. The following nouns are 
sometimes singular, sometimes plural: alms, amends, bellows, means, pains 
(in the sense of “‘ effort’’), tidings. 
Il. PERSON vw 
85. Person is that property of substantives which shows whether 
they denote (1) the speaker, (2) the person spoken to, or (3) the person 
spoken of. 
A substantive is in the first person when it denotes the speaker, in 
the second person when it denotes the person spoken to, in the third 
person when it denotes the person or thing spoken of. 
I, the king, command his presence. [First person.] 
You, Thomas, broke the window. [Second person.] 
Charles, come here. [Second person. ] 
He, the fireman, saved the train. [Third person.] 
The diver sinks slowly from our view. [Third person.] 
The tower suddenly collapsed. [Third person.] 
The examples show (1) that the person of a noun has noth- 
ing to do with its form, but is indicated by the sense or con- 
nection; (2) that certain pronouns denote person with precision. 
Thus, J is always of the first person; you of the second; and 
he of the third. These personal pronouns will be treated in 
Chapter ITT.

IV. CASE 
86. Substantives have inflections of case to indicate their grammati- 
cal relations to verbs, to prepositions, or to other substantives. 
There are three cases,—the nominative, the possessive, and 
the objective. 
The possessive case is often called the genitive. 
The nominative and the objective case of a noun are always 
alike in form. In some pronouns, however, there is a difference 
(as, —I, me ; he, him). 
Deciension or Nouns 
87. The inflection of a substantive is called its declension. 
To decline a noun is to give its case-forms in order, first in the 
singular number and then in the plural. Thus, — 
SineuLar 
Nominative boy horse fly chimney 
Possessive boy’s horse’s fly’s chimney’s 
Objective boy horse fly chimney 
PLURAL 
Nominative boys horses flies chimneys 
Possessive boys’ horses” flies’ chimneys’ 
Objective boys horses flies chimneys 
SINGULAR

Possessive calf’s Jass’s man’s deer’s 
Objective calf lass man deer

Nominative calves lasses men deer 
Possessive calves’ lasses’ men’s deer’s 
Objective calves lasses men deer 
 
-P-A-G-E-59
  NOMINATIVE CASE 41 
Nominative Case 
88. The nominative case is used in the following constructions : 
(1) the subject, (2) the predicate nominative, (3) the vocative 
(or nominative of direct address), (4) the exclamatory nomina- 
tive, (5) appositive with a nominative, (6) the nominative 
absolute. 
1. The subject of a verb is in the nominative case. 
Water freezes. 
Charles climbed the mountain. 
The boy’s face glowed with health and exercise. 
A thousand men were killed in this battle. 
In the third example, face is the simple subject; the com- 
plete subject is the boy’s face. In the fourth, men is the simple 
subject; the complete subject is a thousand men. Both face 
and men are in the nominative case; face is in the singular 
number; men in the plural. 
2. A substantive standing in the predicate, but describing or defin- 
ing the subject, agrees with the subject in case and is called a predicate 
nominative. 
A predicate nominative is also called a subject complement or an attribute. 
Lobsters are crustaceans. 
A good book is a faithful friend. 
Shakspere was a native of Stratford-on-Avon. 
Arnold proved a.traitor. 
Adams was elected president. 
The rule for the case of the predicate nominative is particu. 
larly important with respect to pronouns (§ 119). 
Iam he. Are you she? 
It is I. It was we who did it. 
The predicate nominative is commonest after the copula is 
(in its various forms). It will be further studied in connection 
with intransitive and passive verbs ($§ 214, 252). 
”
-P-A-G-E-60
  42 NOUNS 
8. Asubstantive used for the purpose of addressing a person directly, 
and not connected with any verb, is called a vocative. 
A vocative is in the nominative case, and is often called a 
nominative by direct address or a vocative nominative. 
Come, Ruth, give me your hand. 
Turn to the right, madam. 
Herbert, it is your turn. 
Come with me, my child. 
Norr. A yocative word is sometimes said to be independent by direct 
address, because it stands by itself, unconnected with any verb. That a voca- 
tive is really in the nominative case may be seen in the use of the pronoun 
thou in this construction: as, —I will arrest thee, thou traitor (see § 115). 
4. A substantive used as an exclamation is called an exclamatory 
nominative (or nominative of exclamation). 
Peace, be still. 
Fortunate Ruth! 
A drum! a drum! Macbeth doth come. 
Look ! a balloon! 
The sun! then we shall have a fine day. 
Certain exclamatory nominatives are sometimes classed as interjections 
(§ 375). 
5. A substantive added to another substantive to explain it and sig- 
nifying the same person or thing, is called an appositive and is said to 
be in apposition. 
An appositive is in the samie case as the substantive which it limits. 
Hence a substantive in apposition with a nominative is in 
the nominative case. 
Mr. Scott, the grocer, is here. [Apposition with subject.] 
Tom, old fellow, I am glad to see you. [Apposition with vocative.] 
The discoverer of the Pacific was Balboa, a Spaniard. [Apposition 
with predicate nominative.] 
Nore. Apposition means “attachment” ; appositive means “attached 
noun or pronoun.” An appositive modifies the noun with which it is in appo- 
sition much as an adjective might do (compare ‘‘ Balboa, a Spaniard” with 
“Spanish Balboa”). Hence it is classed as an adjective modifier.
-P-A-G-E-61
FORMS OF THE POSSESSIVE CASE 43 
PossEss1vE CASE 
89. The possessive case denotes ownership or possession. 
John’s yacht lies at her moorings. 
The duck’s feet are webbed. 
The mutineer’s pistol burst when he fired. 
Nortr. Most uses of the possessive come under the general head of posses- 
sion in some sense. Special varieties of meaning are source (as in “ hen’s eggs”) 
and authorship (as in ‘‘ Wordsworth’s sonnets”). 
A possessive noun or pronoun modifies the substantive to which it is 
attached as an adjective might do. Hence it is classed as an adjective 
modifier. 
Forms of the Possessive Case 
90. The possessive case of most nouns has, in the singular number, 
the ending ’s. 
Examp.es : the owl’s feathers, Elizabeth’s hat, the officer’s name. 
Plural nouns ending in s take no further ending for the possessive. 
In writing, however, an apostrophe is put after the s to indicate the 
possessive case. 
Examp.es: the owls’ feathers, the officers’ names, the artists’ petition, 
the engineers’ ball. 
Plural nouns not ending in s take ’s in the possessive. 
Examptss: the firemen’s ball, the policemen’s quarters, the children’s 
hour. 
Norkg. In older English the possessive of most nouns was written as well 
as pronounced with the ending -es or -is. Thus, in Chaucer, the possessive of 
child is childés or childis ; that of king is kingés or kingis; that of John is 
Johnés or Johnis. The use of an apostrophe in the possessive is a compara- 
tively modern device, due to a misunderstanding. Scholars at one time 
thought the s of the possessive a fragment of the pronoun his; that is, they 
took such a phrase as George’s book for a contraction of George his book. 
Hence they used the apostrophe before s to signify the supposed omission of 
part of the word his. Similarly, in the possessive plural, there was thought 
to be an omission of a final es; that is, such a phrase as the horses’ heads was 
thought to be a contraction of the horseses heads. Both these errors have 
long been exploded. 
   
-P-A-G-E-62
44 NOUNS 
91. Nouns like sheep and deer, which have the same form 
in both the singular and the plural, usually take ’s in the 
possessive plural. 
Thus, the deer’s tracks would be written, whether one deer or more 
were meant. 
92. PossEsstve SincuLAR or Nouns ENDING IN S. 
1. Monosyllabic nouns ending in s or an s-sound usually 
make their possessive singular by adding ’s. 
Exampres: Charles’s hat, Forbes’s garden, Mr. Wells’s daughter, 
Rice’s carriage, Mrs. Dix’s family, a fox’s brush. 
Nore. Most of these monosyllabic nouns in s are family names. The rule 
accords with the best usage; but it is not absolute, for usage varies. Hence 
forms like Charles’ and Wells’ cannot be condemned as positively wrong, 
though Charles’s and Wells’s are preferable. In speaking, the shorter form is 
often ambiguous, for there is no difference in sound between Diz’ and Dick’s, 
Mr. Hilis’ and Mr. Hill’s, Dr. Childs’ and Dr. Child’s. 
2. Nouns of two or more syllables ending in s or an s-sound, 
and not accented on the last syllable, may make their posses- 
sive singular by adding ’s, or may take no ending in the pos- 
sessive. 
In the latter case, an apostrophe is added in writing, but in 
sound there is no difference between the possessive and the 
nominative. 
Examptes: Burrows’s (or Burrows’) Hotel, Eneas’s (or /Eneas’) 
voyage, Beatrice’s (or Beatrice’) gratitude, Felix’s (or Felix’) arrival, 
for conscience’s (or conscience’) sake. 
Most of the nouns in question are proper names. In speak- 
ing, one must often use the longer form to prevent ambiguity ; 
for Williams’ and William’s, Roberts’ and Robert’s, Robbins’ 
and Robin’s, are indistinguishable in sound. 
Nore. Nouns of two or more syllables ending in s or an s-sound and ac- 
cented on the last syllable, follow the rule for monosyllables. Thus, — Laplace’s 
mathematics (not Laplace’); Alphonse’s father (not Alphonse’). 
When final sis silent (as in many French names), ’s must of course be added 
in the possessive. Thus, — Descartes’s philosophy (pronounced Daycdrt’s). 
 
-P-A-G-E-63
  USE OF THE POSSESSIVE CASE 45 
Use of the Possessive Case 
93.1 Possession may be denoted by a phrase with of as well 
as by the possessive case. The distinction between the two 
forms cannot be brought under rigid rules, but the following 
suggestions will be of use. 
I. In older English and in poetry the possessive case of 
nouns is freely used, but in modern prose it is rare unless the 
possessor is a living being. A phrase with of is used instead. 
The mayor of Detroit (Nor Detroit’s mayor). 
The top of the post (nor the post’s top). 
The prevalence of the epidemic (Nor the epidemic’s prevalence). 
Contrast the poetic use : — 
Belgium’s capital had gathered then. 
Her beauty and her chivalry. — Byron. 
Other prepositions are sometimes used: as, — ‘‘ the explosion in Vew York” 
(nor ‘* New York’s explosion ’’), ‘‘ the station at Plymouth.” 
II. When the possessor is a living being, good usage varies. 
1. If there is actual ownership or possession of some material thing, the 
possessive case is generally used in the singular: as, — “ John’s hat”? (not 
‘the hat of John’). The possessive plural, however, is often replaced by 
a phrase with of, to avoid ambiguity or harshness: as,— ‘the jewels 
of the ladies’ (rather than ‘the ladies’ jewels’’)®, ‘‘the wings of the 
geese’? (rather than “ the yeese’s wings”’). 
2. With nouns denoting a quality, an act, or the like, either the pos- 
sessive or the of-phrase is proper: as,—‘' John’s generosity,” or ‘the 
generosity of John”’ ; ‘t John’s condition,”’ or ‘t the condition of John”; 
‘the guide’s efforts,” or ‘the efforts of the guide”; ‘* Cesar’s death,” or 
“the death of Cesar.” 
When there is any choice, it usually depends on euphony (that is, agree- 
able sound), and is therefore a question of style. Sometimes, however, 
there is a distinction in sense. ‘t John’s fear,” for example, indicates that 
John is afraid ; but “ the fear of John” méans the fear which John inspires 
in others.

2 Note the ambiguity to the ear though not to the eye. 
 
-P-A-G-E-64
    46 NOUNS 
III. The following phrases are established idioms with the 
possessive. In some of them, however, the possessive may be 
replaced by of and its object. 
(1) The earth’s surface, the sun’s rays, the moon’s reflection, the pit’s 
mouth, a rope’s end, his journey’s end, at his wit’s end, the ship’s keel, 
the water’s edge, the cannon’s mouth, out of harm’s way, at swords’ 
points, for pity’s sake, for conscience’ sake ; (2) a moment’s pause, a 
year’s time, a hand’s breadth, a boat’s length, a month’s salary, a week’s 
notice, a night’s rest, a day’s work, a stone’s throw, a feather’s weight, 
an hour’s delay, a dollar’s worth, not a foot’s difference. 
In the second group of phrases (‘ta moment’s pause,”’ etc.), the pos- 
sessive denotes not ownership, but measure or extent. 
IV. The possessive case of certain pronouns (my, our, your, 
his, her, its, their’) is more freely used than that of nouns in 
expressions that do not denote actual ownership. 
I know him to my sorrow. [Compare : to his loss, to~our detriment, 
to his advantage. ] 
The brass has lost its polish. 
This question must be decided on its merits. 
His arguments did not fail of their effect. 
For the inflection of these pronouns, see§ 115. For the use of whose, see § 152. 
94. When a thing belongs to two or more joint owners, the 
sign of the possessive is added to the last name only. 
Brown, Jones, and Richardson’s factories. [Brown, Jones, and Rich- 
ardson are partners. ] 
It is George and William’s turn to take the boat. [George and Wil- 
liam are to go in the boat together.] 
On the other hand, in order to avoid ambiguity we should say, 
**Brown’s, Jones’s, and Richardson’s factories,’ if each individual had 
a factory of his own; and ‘tGeorge’s and William’s answers were cor- 
rect,’’ if each boy answered independently of the other. 
95. In compound nouns the last part takes the possessive 
sign. So also when a phrase is used as a noun. 
My father-in-law’s home is in Easton. 
We had a quarter of an hour’s talk.

OBJECTIVE CASE 47 
Other examples are the following : — 
My brother-in-law’s opinion ; the commander-in-chief’s orders; the 
lady-in-waiting’s duties ; the coal dealer’s prices; Edward VII’s reign ; 
the King of England’s portrait ; half a year’s delay ; in three or four 
months’ time; a cable and a half’s length ; the pleasure of Major Pen- 
dennis and Mr. Arthur Pendennis’s company (THackuray). 
Nore. Noun-phrases often contain two substantives, the second of which 
is in apposition with the first. In such phrases, of is generally preferable to 
the possessive. Thus, we may say either ‘t Tom the blacksmith’s daughter ” or 
‘the daughter of Tom the blacksmith”; but ‘the son of Mr. Hill the carpen- 
ter” is both neater and clearer than ‘t Mr. Hill the carpenter’s son.” The use 
of ’s is also avoided with a very long phrase like ‘the owner of the house on 
the other side of the street.” 
An objective may stand in apposition with a possessive, the latter being 
equivalent to of with an object. Thus, —‘‘I am not yet of Percy’s mind [ = of 
the mind of Percy], the Hotspur of the North” (SHAKSPERE). 
96. The noun denoting the object possessed is often omitted 
when it may be readily understood, especially in the predicate. 
Conant’s [shop] is open until noon. 
I buy my hats at Bryant's [shop]. 
We will dine at Pennock’s [restaurant]. 
That camera is mine. (See § 122.) 
This construction is common in such expressions as : — 
He was a relative of John’s. 
That careless tongue of John’s will get him into trouble. 
In the first example, ‘ta relative of John’s” means “‘a relative of (= from 
among) John’s relatives.” The second example shows an extension of this 
construction by analogy. See § 122. 
OxsEcTIVE CASE 
97. The objective case, as its name implies, is the case of the 
object. Most of its uses are covered by the following rule : — 
The object of a verb or preposition is in the objective case. 
The object of a preposition has already been explained and 
defined (§§ 20-21).  
-P-A-G-E-66
  48 NOUNS 
98. The object of a verb may be (1) the direct object, (2) the 
predicate objective, (3) the indirect object, (4) the cognate ob- 
ject. Of these the direct object is the most important. 
The objective is also used (5) adverbially ($§ 109), (6) in ap- 
position with another objective (§ 110), and (7) as the subject 
of an infinitive (§ 111). 
1. Direct Object 
99. Some verbs may be followed by a substantive denoting that 
which receives the action or is produced by it. These are called transi- 
tive verbs. All other verbs are called intransitive. 
. That man struck my dog. 
. The arrow hit the target. 
. Cesar conquered Gaul. 
. Mr. Holland sells flour. 
. The farmer raises corn. 
Mr. Eaton makes stoves. 
. My grandfather built that house. NOATP 
WN 
In Nos. 1-4, the verb is followed by a noun denoting the 
receiver of the action. Thus, in the first sentence, the dog receives 
the blow; in the second, the target receives the action of hit 
ting. In Nos. 5-7, the verb is followed by a noun denoting the 
product of the action. For example, the corn is produced by the 
action expressed by the verb raises. 
In each example, the noun that follows the verb completes 
the sense of the verb. “That man struck ——.” “Struck 
whom?” “He struck the dog.” Until dog is added the sense 
of the verb struck is incomplete. 
100. A substantive that completes the meaning of a transitive verb 
is called its direct object, and is said to be in the objective case. 
Thus, in the examples above, dog is the direct object of the transitive 
verb struck ; target is the direct. ‘object of hit, — and so on. Each of these 
nouns is therefore i in the objective case. 
The direct object is often called the object complement, or the object of the 
verb.
-P-A-G-E-67
DIRECT OBJECT 49 
101. Intransitive verbs have no object. 
The lion roared. 
The visitor coughed gently. 
The log drifted downstream. 
We all listened intently. 
Compare these sentences with those in § 99. We observe 
that the verbs (unlike those in § 99) admit no object, since 
their meaning is complete without the addition of any noun 
to denote the receiver or product of the action. “The man 
struck ” prompts the inquiry, “Struck whom?” But no 
such question is suggested by “ The lion roared” ; for “ Roared 
what?” would be an absurdity. 
102. The predicate nominative (§ 88, 2) must not be confused 
with the direct object. They resemble each other in two particu- 
lars: (1) both stand in the predicate, and (2) both complete 
the meaning of the verb. But they differ utterly in their 
relation to the subject of the sentence. For — 
The predicate nominative describes or defines the subject. Hence 
both substantives denote the same person or thing.   
is 
Charles [sussxcr] captain [PREDICATE NOMINATIVE]. wi 
became 
was elected 
The direct object neither describes nor defines the subject. 
On the contrary, it designates that upon which the subject 
acts. Hence the two substantives regularly’ denote different 
persons or things. 
struck James [oBsEcT]. 
Charles [sussxcr] {fre a stone [opsEcT]. 
built a boat [opsEcT]. 
Both the direct object and the predicate nominative are 
classed as complements, because they are used to complete the 
sense of the predicate verb (§ 483). 
1 The only exception is in reflexive action, where the object is a compound 
personal pronoun (‘‘Charles deceived himself”). See § 126.
-P-A-G-E-68
    50 NOUNS 
103. A verb of asking sometimes takes two direct objects, one 
denoting the person and the other the thing. 
She asked the boy his name. 
Ask me no favors. 
I asked the lawyer his opinion. 
2. Predicate Objective 
104. Verbs of choosing, calling, naming, making, and thinking may take 
two objects referring to the same person or thing. 
The first of these is the direct object, and the second, which completes 
the sense of the predicate, is called a predicate objective. 
We chose Oscar president. [Oscar is the direct object of chose; presi- 
dent is the predicate objective. ] 
I call John my friend. 
They thought the man a coward. 
Make my house your home. 
The predicate objective is often called the complementary object or the objective 
attribute. It is classed as a complement. 
An adjective may serve as predicate objective. 
I call this ship unseaworthy. 
Your letter made your sister anwious. 
What makes Edwin so careless ? 
3. Indirect Object and Similar Idioms 
105. Some verbs of giving, telling, refusing, and the like, may take two 
objects, a direct object and an indirect object. 
The indirect object denotes the person or thing toward whom or 
toward which is directed the action expressed by the rest of the predicate.

-P-A-G-E-69
    
INDIRECT OBJECT AND SIMILAR IDIOMS 51 
Most of the verbs that admit an indirect object are included 
in the following list :— 
allot, allow, assign, bequeath, bring, deny, ensure, fetch, fling, forbid, 
forgive, give, grant, guarantee, hand, lease, leave, lend, let, owe, pardon, 
pass, pay, refund, refuse, remit, restore, sell, send, show, sing, spare, 
teach, tell, throw, toss, vouchsafe. 
Pronouns are commoner as indirect objects than nouns. 
They denied her the necessities of life. 
I guaranteed them a handsome profit. 
The king vouchsafed them an audience. 
It is always possible to insert the preposition to before the indirect 
object without changing the sense. 
Since the indirect object is equivalent to an adverbial phrase, 
it is classed as a modifier of the verb. 
Thus, in ‘* Dick sold John his bicycle,” John is an adverbial modifier 
of the predicate verb sold. 
The indirect object is sometimes used without a direct object 
expressed. Thus, — 
He paid the hatter. 
Here hatter may be recognized as an indirect object by inserting to before 
it and adding a direct object (“his bill,” ‘his money,” or the like). 
106. The objective case sometimes expresses the person for 
whom anything is done. 
William made his brother a kite [= made a kite for his brother]. 
Sampson built me a boat [= built a boat for me]. 
y 
This construction may be called the objective of service. o 
Nore. The objective of service is often included under the head of the 
indirect object. But the two constructions differ widely in sense, and should 
be carefully distinguished. To do an act ¢o a person is not the same thing as 
to do an act for a person. Contrast ‘‘ John paid the money to me,” with * John 
paid the money for me”; ‘Dick sold a bicycle to me,” with ‘Dick sold a 
bicycle for me.”
-P-A-G-E-70
  52 NOUNS 
107. The objective case is used after like, unlike, near, and 
next, which are really adjectives or adverbs, though in this 
construction they are often regarded as prepositions. 
She sang like a bird. [Like is an adverb.] 
The earth is like a ball. [Like is an adjective.] 
My office is near the station. [Near is an adjective.] 
That answer was unlike Joseph. [Unlike is an adjective.] 
This man walks unlike Joseph. [Unlike is an adverb.] 
A stream ran near the hut. [Near is an adverb.] 
The use of the objective after these words is a peculiar idiom 
similar to the indirect object (§ 105). The nature of the con- 
struction may be seen (as in the indirect object) by inserting 
to or unto (“She sang like unto a bird”). 
Norte. The indirect object, the objective of service, and the objective after 
like, unlike, and near are all survivals of old dative constructions. Besides 
the case of the direct object (often called accusative), English once had a case 
(called the dative) which meant to or for [somebody or something]. The dative 
vase is easily distinguished in Greek, Latin, and German, but in English it 
has long been merged in form with the ordinary objective. 
4. Cognate Object 
108. A verb that is regularly intransitive sometimes takes as object 
a noun whose meaning closely resembles its own. 
A noun in this construction is called the cognate object of the verb 
and is in the objective case. 
He ran a race. 
The mayor coughed a dubious, insinuating cough. 
A scornful laugh laughed he. 
The trumpeter blew a loud blast. 
She sleeps the’ sleep of death. 
Nore. Cognate means “kindred” or ‘related.’ The cognate object re- 
peats the idea of the verb, often with some modification, and may be classed 
as an adverbial modifier. Its difference from the direct object may be seen 
by contrasting ‘‘The blacksmith struck the anvil” with ‘‘The blacksmith 
struck a mighty blow” (cf. “struck mightily”). For the pronoun it as cog- 
nate object, see § 120. 
 
-P-A-G-E-71
    ADVERBIAL OBJECTIVE 53 
5. Adverbial Objective 
109. A noun, or a phrase consisting of a noun and its modifiers, may 
be used adverbially. Such a noun is called an adverbial objective. 
We have waited years for this reform. 
I am years older than you are. 
The river is miles away. 
The water rose three feet. 
This is an inch too long. 
My brother is twenty years old. 
I will stay a short time. 
Wait a moment. 
Come here this instant! 
Turn your eyes this way. 
This silk is several shades too light. 
- 
A group of words consisting of an adverbial object with its 
modifier or modifiers forms an adverbial phrase (§ 41). 
6. Objective in Apposition 
110. A substantive in apposition with an objective is itself 
in the objective case. 
Yesterday I saw Williams the expressman. [Apposition with the direct 
object of saw.] 
Tom gave his friend John a book. [Apposition with the indirect object 
friend.] 
He lives with Andrews the blacksmith. [Apposition with the object of 
the preposition with.] 
This rule follows from the general principle that an apposi- 
tive is in the same case as the substantive to which it is 
attached (§ 88, 5). 
7. Subject of an Infinitive 
111. The subject of an infinitive is in the objective case. 
This construction will be treated in connection with the uses 
of the infinitive (§ 325).
-P-A-G-E-72
  54 NOUNS 
Parsing 
112. To parse a word is to describe its grammatical form 
and to give its construction. 
In parsing a noun, we mention the class to which it belongs, 
give its gender, number, person, and case, and tell why it is in 
that case. Thus, — 
1. Frank shot a wolf. 
Frank is a proper noun of the masculine gender, in the singular num- 
ber and third person. It is in the nominative case, because it is the sub- 
ject of the verb shot. 
Wolf is a common noun of the masculine or feminine [or common] 
gender, in the singular number and third person. It is in the objective 
case, because it is the object [or direct object] of the transitive verb shot. 
2. Jane, come here. 
Jane is a proper noun of the feminine gender, in the singular number 
and second person. It is in the nominative case, being used as a vocative 
(or in direct address). 
3. The rope is fifteen feet long. 
Feet is a common noun of the neuter gender, in the plural number 
and third person. It is in the objective case, being used as an adverbial 
modifier of the adjective long. 
4, Edgar’s boat is a sloop. 
Edgar’s is a proper noun of the masculine gender, in the singular 
number and third person. It is in the possessive case, modifying the 
noun boat.

PERSONAL PRONOUNS 55 
CHAPTER III 
PRONOUNS 
118. A pronoun is a word used instead of a noun. It designates a 
person, place, or thing without naming it. * 
The substantive to which a pronoun refers is called its Petiocctine, 
A pronoun must agree with its antecedent in gender, number, and 
person (§ 11). 
Pronouns have in general the same constructions as nouns. 
114. Pronouns may be classified as (1) personal, (2) adjective, 
(8) relative, and (4) interrogative. 
Under adjective pronouns are included (a) domonsllll pro- 
nouns and (}) indefinite pronouns. 
PERSONAL PRONOUNS 
115. The personal pronouns serve to distinguish (1) the speaker, 
(2) the person spoken to, and (3) the person, place, or thing spoken 
of (§ 85). 
They are declined as follows : — 
Tue Pronoun oF THE Frrst Person: I 
SINGULAR PLURAL 
Nominative I Nominative we 
Possessive my or mine Possessive our or ours 
Objective me Objective us 
Tuer Pronoun or THE SEconD Person: thou

Nominative he she it they 
Possessive his her or hers its their or theirs

Unlike nouns, most of the personal pronouns have distinct 
forms for the nominative and the objective. 
Norr. The possessive case of personal pronouns never has the apostrophe. 
Thus, —its, yours, theirs. 
The form it’s is proper only as a contraction of it is. 
7 GENDER AND NUMBER 
116. The pronouns of the first and second persons (J and 
thou) may be either masculine or feminine. 
The pronouns of the third person have different forms for 
masculine, feminine, and neuter in the singular (he, she, it); 
but in the plural the form they serves for all three genders. 
Nore. In the oldest English his was both masculine and neuter. The 
neuter use lasted until the seventeenth century. Thus, — 
That same eye whose bend doth awe the world 
Did lose his lustre. —SHAKSPERE, Julius Cesar, i. 2. 123. 
117. Thou, thy, thine, thee, and ye are old forms still found 
in poetry and the solemn style. 
In ordinary prose, you, your, and yours are the only forms 
used for the second person, whether singular or plural. Yet 
you, even when denoting a single person, always takes the verb- 
forms that go with plural subjects. Thus, — 
My friend, you were [Nor was] in error. 
Hence you may best be regarded as always plural in form, but 
may be described as singular in sense when it stands for one 
person only. 
 
-P-A-G-E-75
  
PERSONAL PRONOUNS 57 
Nor. Members of the Society of Friends (commonly called Quakers) and 
of some other religious bodies use thee and thy in their ordinary conversation. 
Ye was formerly the regular nominative plural, and you the objective ; 
but the forms were afterwards confused. Ye has gone out of use except in 
poetry and the solemn style, and you is now the regular form for both nomi- 
native and objective. 
Where an objective form ye is found printed instead of you (as often in 
Shakspere, —‘* A southwest blow on ye”’), it represents an indistinct pronun- 
ciation of you rather than the old nominative ye. This indistinct sound may 
still be heard in rapid or careless speech (‘‘I’ll tell yer the truth”). 
Ye as an abbreviation for the (as in ‘ye old town”) has nothing to do with 
the pronoun ye. The y simply stands for the character } (an old sign for th), 
and the abbreviation was pronounced the, never ye. 
118. They, you, and we are often used indefinitely for “ one ” 
or “ people in general.” 
They say that Joe has gone to sea. ” 
To shut off the steam, you close both valves of the radiator. 
Nore. We, our, and us are used in editorial articles instead of J, my, and 
me, because the writer represents the whole editorial staff. This practice 
should not be followed in ordinary composition. 
A sovereign ruler may use we, our, and us when speaking of himself in 
proclamations and other formal documents. This construction is often called 
‘the plural of majesty.”” Thus, — 
Know that we have divided 
In three our kingdom. —SHAKSPERE. 
The form ’em (asin ‘Tell me your counsels; I will not disclose ’em,”’ in 
Julius Cesar) is not a contraction of them, but of hem, an old objective 
plural of he. 
CASE OF PERSONAL PRONOUNS 
Nominative Case 
119. Nominative constructions of the personal pronouns are the 
same as those of nouns (§ 88). 
Tam ready. [Subject.] 
It is I. [Predicate nominative.] 
Here, you rascal, what are you about? [Vocative, direct address. ] 
Poor you! [Nominative of exclamation.] 
General Austin, he and no other, won the battle. [Apposition.] 
For the nominative absolute, see § 345.

58 PRONOUNS 
Care must be taken not to use an objective form when a 
predicate nominative is required. 
It is I [Nor me]. 
It is we [Nor us] who did it. 
It was he [Nor him] who told us. 
It was they [Nor them] who were to blame. 
120. J¢ has several peculiar uses in the nominative. 
1. Zt is used as the subject in many expressions like “It 
ains,” “It snows,” “It lightens,” “It is cold,” where no 
definite subject is thought of. In this use, it is said to be 
impersonal. 
Nore. An impersonal it also occurs as a cognate object (§ 108) in colloquial 
language: as, —‘‘Hang it!” “Go it!”? “He went it.” ‘He farmed it fora 
year.” Other examples of the indefinite and impersonal it in various construc- 
tions are: ‘‘ We are roughing it.” ‘Keep it up.” ‘ You’ll catch it.” ‘Let 
it all go.” ‘“‘He made a poor job of it.” ‘“‘He made a success of it.” 
  2. It often serves as grammatical subject merely to introduce 
the verb is, the real subject of the thought standing in the 
predicate. In this use it is called an expletive (or “ filler”). 
It is he. 
It is Christmas. 
It was a tiresome ride. 
In these examples, the subject of the thought (he, Christ- 
mas, ride) appears as a predicate nominative. 
3. The antecedent of 7 is often a group of words. 
Wearing tight shoes is foolish. It deforms the feet. 
121. In imperative sentences the subject (yow) is commonly 
omitted: as, —“ Shut the door.” 
Nore. The subject I is sometimes omitted in wishes (as, ‘‘ Would he were 
here!” for ‘tI would that he were here”). So also in ‘“‘ Thank you,” ‘ Pray 
tell me”’ (compare prithee for ‘‘I pray thee”). 
Expressions like ‘t Canst tell?” (for ‘‘Canst thou tell?’’), ‘* Art there?” 
(for ‘* Art thou there ?”) are common in poetry and older English. These come 
from the gradual wearing away and final disappearance of the pronoun thou 
(canst thou, canstow, cansté, canst).
-P-A-G-E-77
  PERSONAL PRONOUNS 59 
PossEsstvE CASE 
122. The possessive forms my, thy, our, your, her, and their 
are used when a noun follows; mine, thine, ours, yours, hers, 
and theirs cannot be followed by a noun, and stand commonly 
in the predicate. His may be used in either way. 
My brother has arrived. The fault is mine. 
Our work is done. Those seats are ours. 
I have torn your glove. This pencil is yours. 
Their turn has come. That field is theirs. 
His hair is black. The book is not his. 
Examples of mine, yours, etc. not in the predicate are: 
Mine was a terrier; yours was a pointer. 
Theirs is a red motor car. 
Ours broke down last night. 
His leaked badly. 
His name is Martin; hers is Smith. 
In such cases the pronoun is always emphatic. The construction is chiefly 
colloquial. 
Nore. In older English and in poetry mine and thine are common instead 
of my and thy before words beginning with a vowel or A: as, — 
‘Mine eyes dazzle: she died young. —JoHN WEBSTER. 
The very minute bids thee ope thine ear. — SHAKSPERE. 
Mine is sometimes used after a vocative noun: as, — brother mine. 
For expressions like ‘ta friend of mine,” ‘that unruly tongue of yours,” 
see § 96. 
123. When two or more separate objects are spoken of as 
possessed, a possessive should precede the name of each if there 
is danger of ambiguity. 
I will send for our secretary and our treasurer. [Two persons. ] 
I will send for our secretary and treasurer. [One person.] 
I have called for my bread and my milk. [Two things.] 
I have called for my bread and milk. [A mixture.] 
Have you Bacon’s ‘' Essays and Apophthegms’’? [One book.] 
Have you Bacon’s ‘t Essays” and his ‘t Advancement of Learning” ?

-P-A-G-E-78
  60° PRONOUNS 
OBJECTIVE CASE 
124. The commonest constructions in which personal pro- 
nouns take the objective case are the following : — 
1. Object of a preposition (§ 97): as, — 
Take it from him. 
2. Direct object of a transitive verb (§ 99): as, — 
I will find you. 
38. Indirect object of a transitive verb (§ 105): as, — 
He gave me a dollar. 
4, Subject of an infinitive (see § 325). 
Nors. In poetry the objective me is sometimes used in exclamations: as, — 
‘* Me miserable!” (Miron). 
In methinks and meseems (‘it seems to me’), me is a remnant of the old 
dative, as in the indirect object (see § 107). 
The compounds thereof, therewith, therefrom, etc., are equivalent to of it, 
with it, from it, ete.: as, — “* Proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all 
the inhabitants thereof” (Leviticus xxv. 10). 
For the impersonal it as cognate object, see § 120. 
THE SELF-PRONOUNS (COMPOUND PERSONAL PRONOUNS) 
125. The three compound personal pronouns are made by adding 
the word se/f to certain forms of the personal pronouns. Thus, — 
myself, plural ourselves ; 
thyself or yourself, plural yourselves ; 
himself, herself, itself, plural themselves. 
To these may be added the indefinite oneself, more commonly written as 
two words, one’s self (§ 139). 
Observe that yourself is singular, and yourselves plural. 
Hisself and theirselves are incorrect forms. Ourself (not our- 
selves) is the compound pronoun corresponding to the royal we 
(§ 118). 
‘What touches us ourself shall be last served. — SHaKSPERE.
-P-A-G-E-79
COMPOUND PERSONAL PRONOUNS ‘61 
126. 1. The compound personal pronouns may be used to emphasize 
substantives. 
In this use they are called intensive pronouns. 
I myself will go. 
King Alfred himself took the field. 
They did the work themselves. 
An intensive pronoun is in apposition with the substantive 
to which it refers. 
2. The compound personal pronouns may be used as the objects of 
transitive verbs or of prepositions when the object denotes the same 
person or thing as the subject. 
In this use they are called reflexive pronouns. 
I have hurt myself. , 
King Alfred interested himself in his subjects. 
These schemers deceived themselves. 
Mary was talking to herself. 
He gave himself a holiday. [Indirect object.] 
These pronouns are called reflexive (that is, ‘‘ bending back ”) 
because they refer back to the subject and repeat its meaning in 
an object construction. 
Norn. A reflexive pronoun sometimes refers to a substantive in the objec- 
tive case: as, —‘‘ Our captors left us to ourselves.” 
In older English the simple personal pronouns me, thee, etc., were often 
used reflexively: as, —‘*I held me [= myse/j’] still”; ‘* Yield thee [= thyself] 
captive”; ‘* They built them [= for themselves] houses” (see § 106). This idiom 
survives in colloquial language (as, ‘‘I have hurt me,” ‘‘I have bought mea 
rifle”), but it is avoided in writing except in a few expressions such as: ‘I 
must look about me”; ‘‘ We gazed about us”; ‘‘ Look behind you.” 
127. The adjective own is sometimes inserted between the 
first and the second part of the sejfpronouns for emphasis. 
ExamprEs: my own self, your own self, his own self, our own selves, 
their own selves. 
In this use, se/f is in strictness a noun limited by the possessive and by the 
adjective own, but the phrases may be regarded as compound pronouns. Other 
adjectives are sometimes inserted between the possessive and self: as,—my 
very self, his worthiess self. 
 
-P-A-G-E-80
  62 PRONOUNS 
128. The intensive pronouns are sometimes used without a 
substantive. Thus, — 
It is myself. [Myself = I myself.] 
You are hardly yourself to-day. 
In poetry and older English, the intensives are even found as subjects: 
as, — “* Ourse/f will mingle with society ”’ (Macbeth). 
129. The intensive pronouns should not be used as simple 
personal pronouns. 
Thus we should say :—‘'He was kind to Mary and me” (nor myself) ; 
“They invited my wife and me (Nor myself).” 
ADJECTIVE PRONOUNS 
130. Some words are used either as adjectives or as pronouns. Such 
words are called adjective pronouns. 
Adjective pronouns are classified, according to their mean- 
ing, as (1) demonstrative pronouns and (2) indefinite pronouns. 
I, DEMONSTRATIVE PRONOUNS 
181. The demonstratives are this (plural, these), that (plural, those). 
They point out persons or things for special attention. 
The demonstratives may be used either as adjectives or as 
pronouns. 
I. As adjectives : — 
This sailor saved my life. These girls are energetic. 
Be kind to this child. I am not alarmed by these threats. 
Give this boy a dime. These cherries are sour. 
This fire is too hot. Look at these acorns. 
That saw is dull. Those trees are dying. 
We must cross that stream, Take those dishes away. 
That train is late. Who are those strangers ? 
Send that dog home. Do you see those rocks? 
I am tired of that tune. I am sorry for those children.
-P-A-G-E-81
  
    DEMONSTRATIVE PRONOUNS 
II. As pronouns : — 
This is a fine morning.? These are cowboys. 
This is my uncle. Robert gave me these. 
Can you do this ? I never saw these before. 
This is the road. Who are these? 
Look at this. These ave our rackets. 
That is Ellen in the canoe. Those are deer. 
That would please him. Those are nasturtiums. 
That must be he. What are those? 
What is that ? Those are kangaroos. 
If the demonstrative is followed by a noun which it limits (as in 
this sailor”’), it is an adjective. If the demonstrative points out some- 
thing which’ it does not name (as in ‘‘ This is a fine morning”’), it takes 
the place of a noun and is therefore a pronoun. The simple subject of 
the sentence ‘This camera is expensive” is the noun camera, which is 
modified by the adjective this. The subject of the sentence ‘* This is 
expensive” is the pronoun this. ie 
Nore. Yon, yond, and yonder are common as demonstratives in older Eng- 
lish and in poetry. Thus,—‘“'Nerissa, cheer yon stranger’? (Merchant of 
Venice). ‘* Question yond man” (As You Like It). “Is not yond Diomed ?” 
(Troilus and Cressida). ‘‘ Call yonder fellow hither” (Henry V). “Is yonder 
the man ?” (As You Like It). 
132. Demonstratives have only the inflection of number. 
They have the same form for all three genders. The nomina- 
tive and objective cases are alike; the possessive is replaced 
by of with the objective. 
SrveuLar PLuraL 
Nom. and Obj. this Nom. and Obj. these 
Possessive [of this] Possessive [of these] 
Nom. and Obj. that Nom. and Obj. those 
Possessive [of that] Possessive [of those] 
Yon, yond, and yonder are not inflected. 
1 The pupil should not ‘supply nouns” in such sentences as these. For ex- 
ample, it is unscientific to expand the first sentence into “ This [morning] is a 
fine morning,” and then to parse this as an adjective. It is even more objec- 
tionable to expand the fifth sentence by inserting thing or the like after this. 
The plan of ‘supplying ” unexpressed words (as being ‘‘ understood”) tends 
to confuse real distinctions of language, and should never be resorted to when 
it can be avoided. 
     
-P-A-G-E-82
     
  * PRONOUNS 
133. A demonstrative pronoun may be used to avoid the 
repetition of a noun. 
My dog and that [= the dog] of my friend John have been fighting. 
Compare these maps with those [= the maps] on the blackboard. 
134. The singular forms ¢his and that (not the plurals these 
and those) are used with the nouns kind and sort. 
I like this kind of grapes. 
I have met this sort of people before. 
That kind of apples grows in Idaho. 
Il. INDEFINITE PRONOUNS 
135. The indefinite pronouns point out objects less clearly or defi- 
nitely than demonstratives do. 
Examp es: each, every, either, both, neither, some, any, such, none, 
other, another, each other, one another. 
Each has its merits. Either is correct. 
Some are missing. He knows neither of you. 
I cannot give you any. I like both. 
136. Most indefinites may be either pronouns or adjectives. 
But none is always a substantive in modern use, and every is 
always an adjective. 
137. None may be either singular or plural. When it means 
distinctly not one, it is singular. In many instances either con- 
struction is permissible. 
None of us has the key. 
None was (or were) left to tell the tale. 
138. Lach other and one another are regarded as compound 
pronouns. They designate related persons or things. 
My neighbor and I like each other. 
We must bear with one another. 
The relation indicated by these pronouns is that of reciprocity. Hence they 
are often called reciprocal pronouns. 
There is no real distinction between each other and one another. The rules 
sometimes given for such a distinction are not supported by the best usage.
-P-A-G-E-83
  INDEFINITE PRONOUNS AK 
139. One (possessive one’s) is often used as an indefinite 
personal pronoun. Thus, — 
One does not like one’s [Nor his or their ] motives to be doubted. 
The use of his (for one’s) to refer back to a preceding one is found in 
respectable writers, but is contrary to the best usage. 
For the indefinite use of we, you, they, see § 118. 
140. All, several, few, many, and similar words are often 
classed as indefinites. They may be used as adjectives or as 
substantives. Everybody, everything, anybody, anything, some- 
what, aught, naught, etc., are called indefinite nouns. 
141. Care should be taken in framing suck sontencc. as the 
following : — 
Everybody has his [nor their] faults. 
If anybody wishes to go, he [Nor they] may. 
If anybody objects, let him [Nor them] speak. 
Every member of this class must hand in his [nor their] composition 
to-day. 
Each hurries toward his [Nort their] home. 
Each of us must lead his [nor their] own life. 
In sentences of this kind, the personal pronoun (he, his, 
him) must be in the singular to agree with its antecedent 
(everybody, anybody, etc.) (see § 113). 
Nore. When the antecedent is of common gender (as in the last example), 
the personal pronouns (he, his, him) may be regarded as of common gender 
also. In very precise or formal language, one may say he or she, his or her: 
as, —‘‘Each of us must lead his or her own life”; but this form of expression 
is to be avoided unless the distinction is clearly necessary. 
142. When used as adjectives, none of the indefinites have 
any forms of inflection. The same is true when they are pro- 
nouns, except as follows : — 
Others is used as the plural of another. The possessive forms are : — 
singular, another’s; plural, others’. The other (possessive, the other's) has 
in the plural the others (possessive, the others’). Each other and one another 
add ’s in the possessive. One has a possessive one’s; the one becomes the 
ones in the plural. 
1 The negative not (§ 190, 4) is merely a shortened form of naught.

  6S PRONOUNS 
RELATIVE PRONOUNS 
148. Relative pronouns have a peculiar function in the sen- 
tence, since they serve both as pronouns and as connectives. Their 
use may be seen by comparing the two sentences that follow : — 
1. This is the sailor, and he saved my life. 
2. This is the sailor who saved my life. 
Each consists of two parts or clauses (§ 44). In No. 1, the two 
clauses are connected by the conjunction and, which belongs 
to neither; the pronoun he, which stands for sailor, is the sub- 
jec of the second clause. In No. 2, there is no conjunction ; 
instead, ‘we fid the word who, which replaces and he. This 
who is a pronoun, since it stands for sailor (precisely as he does 
in No. 1) and (like he) is the subject of the verb saved. But . 
who is also a connective, since it joins the two parts of the sen- 
tence as and does in No. 1. Such words (which serve both as 
pronouns and as connectives) are called relative pronouns. 
In No. 1, the two clauses are cotrdinate. Neither serves as a 
modifier, and each might stand alone as a complete sentence 
(* This is the sailor.” “ He saved my life”). The sentence is 
compound (§ 44). In No. 2, on the contrary, the clause who 
saved my life is a subordinate or dependent clause, for it is used 
as an adjective modifier of the noun sailor, which it limits by 
showing what particular sailor is meant. The sentence is complex 
(§ 44). The dependent clause (who saved my life) is connected 
with the main clause (this is the sailor) by the pronoun who, 
which refers to sailor. 
144. Relative pronouns connect dependent clauses with main clauses 
by referring directly to a substantive in the main clause.! 
This substantive is the antecedent of the relative (§ 11). 
Thus in § 143 the noun sailor is the antecedent of who. 
Relative means “carrying back.” These pronouns are so called because 
they carry the mind back directly to the antecedent. 
1 Because of their use as connectives, relative pronouns are sometimes 
called conjunctive pronouns, _
-P-A-G-E-85
RELATIVE PRONOUNS 
145. The simple relative pronouns are who, which, that, as, 
and what. 
Who and which are declined as follows in both the singular 
and the plural : — 
Nominative who which 
Possessive whose whose 
Objective whom which 
That, as, and what are not inflected. They have the same 
form for both nominative and objective and are not used in 
the possessive case. 
146. As may be used as a relative pronoun when such 
stands in the main clause. 
Such of you as have finished may go. 
I have never seen such strawberries as these [are]. 
Use such powers as you have. 
147. As is often used as a relative after the same. 
This color is the same as that [is]. 
Other relatives are also used after the same. 
This is the same book that (or which) you were reading yesterday. 
This is the same man that (or whom) I saw on the pier last Friday. 
148. Who is either masculine or feminine; which and what 
are neuter; that and as are of all three genders. 
All who heard, approved. 
Here is the lad whose story interested you. 
The first woman whom I saw was Mary. 
He answered in such English as he could muster. 
I saw nobody that I knew. 
This is the road that leads to London. . 
In older English the which is often used for which : as,— 
Our foster-nurse of nature is repose, 
The which he lacks. —SHAKSPERE. 
For other uses of as, see §§ 368, 428-429. For but in such sentences as 
"There was nobody but believed him,” see § 370. 
 
-P-A-G-E-86
PRONOUNS 
149. A relative pronoun must agree with its antecedent in gender, 
number, and person. 
The sentences in § 148 illustrate the agreement of the rela- 
tive with its antecedent in gender. 
Since relative pronouns have the same form for both num- 
bers and for all three persons, their number and person must be 
discovered, in each instance, by observing the number and 
person of the antecedent. 
It is I who am wrong. [First person, singular number : antecedent, I.] 
All you who are ready may go. [Second person plural: antecedent, 
you.) 
Give help to him who needs it. [Third person, singular: antecedent, 
him.] 
The road that leads to the shore is sandy. [Third person singular: 
antecedent, road.] 
The roads that lead to the shore are sandy. [Third person plural: 
antecedent, roads.] 
To determine the number and person of a relative pronoun 
is particularly necessary when it is the subject of the clause, for 
the form of the verb varies (as the examples show) according 
to the number and person of the subject (§ 222). Hence the 
tule for the agreement of a relative with its antecedent is of 
much practical importance. 
150. The case of a relative pronoun has nothing to do with its ante- 
cedent, but depends on the construction of its own clause. 
The servant who opened the door wore livery. [Who is in the nomi- 
native case, being the subject of opened.] 
He discharged his servant, who immediately left town. [Who is in 
the nominative case, since it is the subject of left, although its antecedent 
(servant) is in the objective.] 
The servant whom you discharged has returned. [Whom is in the 
objective case, since it is the direct object of discharged. The antecedent 
(servant) is, on the other hand, in the nominative, because it is the subject 
of has returned.] 
Here is such money as I have. [As is in the objective case, being the 
object of have. The antecedent (money) is in the nominative. ] 
 
-P-A-G-E-87
  
RELATIVE PRONOUNS 69 
151. A relative pronoun in the objective case is often 
omitted. 
Here is the book which you wanted. Here is the book you wanted. 
The noise that I heard was the wind. The noise I heard was the wind. 
The man whom I met was a carpenter. The man I met was a carpenter. 
Nore. In older English a relative in the nominative is often omitted: as, 
—‘There’s two or three of us have seen strange sights” (Julius Cesar), . 
that is, ‘‘ There are two or three of us who have seen,” etc. The same omission 
is often made in rapid or careless colloquial speech. It is approved in clauses 
with there in such sentences as ‘He is one of the best men there are in the 
world ” (§ 232). 
152. Certain questions of gender call for particular attention. 
1. Which is commonly used in referring to the lower animals 
unless these are regarded as persons. This is true even when 
he or she is used of the same animals (§ 69). 
This is the dog which I mentioned. Is n’t he a fine fellow? 
We have one cow which we prize highly. She is a Jersey. 
2. The possessive whose may be used of any object that 
has life. 
This is the man whose watch was stolen. 
I have a cat whose name is Tabby. 
This is the tree whose leaves were destroyed. It is quite dead. 
3. In the case of things without animal life, of which and 
whose are both common. The tendency is to prefer of which 
in prose, but whose is often used because of its more agreeable 
sound. In poetry, whose is especially frequent. 
A broad river, the name of which I have forgotten, forms the northern 
boundary of the province. 
Jack was fishing with a bamboo rod, to the end of which he had tied a 
short piece of ordinary twine. 
She was gazing into the pool, whose calm surface reflected her fea- 
tures like a mirror. [‘tThe surface of which’? would not sound so well.] 
Nore. In older English, which is often used for who or whom: as, —‘*He 
which hath your noble father slain, pursued my life” (Hamlet). 
The compounds whereof, wherefrom, wherewith, etc., are equivalent to of 
which, from which, ete. (cf. § 124). Thus, —‘t Esau hated Jacob because of the 
blessing wherewith his father blessed him ”’ (Genesis xxvii. 41). 
   
-P-A-G-E-88
  70 PRONOUNS 
DESCRIPTIVE AND RESTRICTIVE RELATIVES 
153. The clause introduced by a relative pronoun is an 
adjective clause, since it serves as an adjective modifier of the 
antecedent (§ 143). There are two different ways in which the 
antecedent may be thus modified. 
1. The Italian, who wore a flower in his coat, smiled at me. 
2. The Italian who wore a flower in his coat smiled at me. 
In the first sentence, the italicized relative clause serves 
“simply to describe the Italian, not to identify him. The flower 
is a mere detail of the picture. 
In the second sentence, the relative clause serves not merely 
to describe the Italian, but also to distinguish him from all 
others. The flower is mentioned as a means of identification. 
The relative clause confines or restricts the meaning of the 
antecedent (Jtalian). 
154. A relative pronoun that serves merely to introduce a descriptive 
fact is called a descriptive relative. 
A relative pronoun that introduces a clause confining or limiting the 
application of the antecedent is called a restrictive relative. 
Thus in the first example in § 153, who is a descriptive 
relative; in the second, it is a restrictive relative. 
155. Before a descriptive relative we regularly make a pause 
in speaking, but never before a restrictive relative. Hence 
the rule : — 
A descriptive relative is preceded by a comma; a restrictive relative 
is not. 
Three sailors, who were loitering on the pier, sprang to the rescue. 
A clumsy weapon, which I took for a blunderbuss, hung over the 
fireplace. 
I told the news to the first man that (or whom) I met. 
The coins that (or which) you showed me are doubloons. 
Nothing that I have ever read has moved me more profoundly than 
the third act of 't King Lear.” 
   
-P-A-G-E-89
1 
RELATIVE PRONOUNS 71 
156. Who, which, and that are all used as restrictive rela- 
tives; but some writers prefer that to which, especially in the 
nominative case. 
Nore. That is not now employed as a descriptive relative, though it was 
common in this use not very long ago. Thus in 1844 Disraeli wrote: ‘t The deer, 
that abounded, lived here in a world as savage as themselves” (Coningsby, 
book iii, chapter 5). 
The omission of the relative (§ 151) is possible only when the relative is 
restrictive. 
The boy [whom] I saw at your house has left town. [Restrictive.] 
Charles, whom I saw yesterday, had not heard the news. [Descriptive.] . 
THE RELATIVE PRONOUN WHAT 
157. The relative pronoun what is equivalent to that which, 
and has a double construction: — (1) the construction of the 
omitted or implied antecedent (that); (2) the construction of the 
relative (which). 
lideeg wnien t 28 said is true. [Here what, being equivalent to that 
which, serves as the subject both of was said and of is.] 
hat Tom always remembers{ nf ny aRtch his said to him. [Here what, being 
equivalent to that which, serves as both the object of remembers and as 
the subject of is said.] 
Tom always remembers { that fhe learns. [Here what serves that which 
both as the object of remembers and as the object of learns.] 
In parsing what, mention both of its constructions. 
Nore. Another method of dealing with the relative what is to regard the 
whole clause (what was said; what is said to him; what he learns) as a noun 
clause. Thus the clause what was said in the first sentence would be the sub- 
ject of is; in the second and third sentences, the clause would be the object of 
remembers. What, in the first sentence, would be parsed as the subject of was 
said; in the second, as the subject of is said; and in the third, as the object 
of learns. Neither view is incorrect, and each has its special advantages. The 
student may well be familiar with both methods, remembering that grammar 
cannot be treated like mathematics.
-P-A-G-E-90
  
72 PRONOUNS 
COMPOUND RELATIVE PRONOUNS 
158. The compound relative pronouns are formed by adding ever or 
soever to who, which, and what. 
They are declined as follows : — 
SrvcuLaR AND PLuRAL 
Nominative whoever (whosoever) whichever (whichsoever) 
Possessive whosever (whosesoever) — — 
Objective whomever (whomsoever) whichever (whichsoever) 
Whatever (whatsoever) has no inflection. The nominative 
and the objective are alike, and the possessive is supplied by 
the phrase of whatever (of whatsoever). 
The phrase of whichever (of whichsoever) is used instead of 
whosever exactly as of which is used instead of whose (§ 152). 
159. The compound relative pronouns may include or imply their 
own antecedents and hence may have a double construction. 
Whoever calls, he must be admitted. [Here he, the antecedent of who- 
ever, is the subject of must be admitted, and whoever is the subject of calls.] 
Whoever calls must be admitted. [Here the antecedent he is omitted, 
being implied in whoever. Whoever has therefore a double construction, 
being the subject of both calls and must be admitted.] 
He shall have whatever he wishes. 
I will do whichever you say. 
In such sentences, care should be taken to use whoever and 
whomever correctly. The nominative (whoever) is required 
when the relative is the subject of its own clause. 
He asked whoever came. 
He told the story to whoever would listen. 
He asked whomever he knew. 
He told the story to whomever he met. 
160. The compound relatives are sometimes used without an 
antecedent expressed or implied,
-P-A-G-E-91
  INTERROGATIVE PRONOUNS 73 
Whoever deserts you, I will remain faithful. 
Whomever it offends, I will speak the truth. 
Whatever he attempts, he is sure to fail. 
Whichever you choose, you will be disappointed. 
Nors. This construction is closely related to that explained in § 159. 
‘Whoever deserts you, I will remain faithful,” is practically equivalent to 
‘“Whoever deserts you, let him desert you! I will remain faithful.” No 
antecedent, however, is felt by the speaker, and hence none need be supplied 
in parsing. Compare concessive clauses (§ 401). 
161. Which, what, whichever, and whatever are often used 
as adjectives. 
Use what (or whatever) powers you have. 
Whichever plan you adopt, you have my best wishes. 
162. A noun limited by the adjectives what, whichever, and 
whatever, may have the same double construction that these 
relatives have when they are used as pronouns (§ 159). Thus, — 
Take whichever pen is not in use. [Here pen is both the direct object 
of take, and the subject of is.] 
Whoso for whosoever and whatso for whatsoever are common in older 
English. 
INTERROGATIVE PRONOUNS 
163. The interrogative pronouns are who, which, and what. They are 
used in asking questions.1 
Who is your neighbor? Which shall I take? 
Who goes there ? Which is correct ? 
Whom have you chosen ? What did he say? 
From whom did you learn this? What is lacking? 
Whose voice is that? With what are you so delighted ? ° 
164. Who has a possessive whose, and an objective whom. 
Which and what are not inflected. 
Who may be either masculine or feminine; which and what 
may be of any gender. 
1 For indirect questions, see § 441.
-P-A-G-E-92
  74 PRONOUNS 
165. The objective whom often begins a question (as in the 
third example in § 163). Care should be taken not to write who 
for whom. 
166. Which and what are used as interrogative adjectives. 
Which street shall I take ? 
What village is this? 
167. The interrogative adjective what may be used in a 
peculiar form of exclamatory sentence. Thus, — 
What a cold night this is! 
What courage he must have had! 
What! by itself often serves as an exclamation: as,—‘*What! do you 
really think so?” In this use what may be regarded as an interjection. 
168. In parsing pronouns the following models may be used: — 
1. He was my earliest friend. 
He is a personal pronoun of the third person. It is in the masculine 
gender, the singular number, and the nominative case, being the subject 
of the verb was. 
2. A policeman whom I met showed me the house. 
Whom is a relative pronoun of the masculine gender, singular number, 
and third person, agreeing with its antecedent, policeman. It is in the 
objective case, being the direct object of the transitive verb met. 
3. The corporal, whose name was Scott, came from Leith. 
Whose is a relative pronoun of the masculine gender, singular number, 
and third person, agreeing with its antecedent, corporal. It is in the 
possessive case, modifying the noun name. 
4. Whose birthday do we celebrate in February ? 
* Whose is an interrogative pronoun in the masculine or feminine gender, 
singular number, and possessive case, modifying the noun birthday. 
5. He injured himself severely. 
Himself is a compound personal pronoun of the third person, used re- 
flexively. It is of the masculine gender, singular number, and third per- 
son, agreeing with its antecedent, he. It is in the objective case, being 
the direct object of the transitive verb injured.

CLASSIFICATION OF ADJECTIVES 75 
CHAPTER IV 
ADJECTIVES 
CLASSIFICATION OF ADJECTIVES 
169. An adjective is a word which describes or limits a substantive. 
An adjective is said to belong to the substantive which it describes 
or limits. 
An adjective which describes is called a descriptive adjective; one 
which points out or designates is called a definitive adjective (§ 13). 
Most adjectives are descriptive : as, — rownd, cold, red, angry, 
graceful, excessive, young, sudden, Roman. 
Norr. Many descriptive adjectives are compound (see § 64): as, —stead- 
fast, lionlike, fireproof, downright, heartsick, everlasting, brown-eyed, broad- 
shouldered, ill-tempered, dear-bought, far-fetched, never-ending, self-evident, 
self-important. ‘“‘He was a matter-of-fact person.” ‘Tom is hail-fellow-well- 
met with everybody.” ‘ This is an out-of-the-way place.” ‘A dashing, down- 
at-the-heel youth answered my knock.” 
DP 
170./A proper noun used as an adjective, or an adjective 
derived” from a proper noun, is called a Proper_adjective and 
usually begins with a capital letter. 
Exampres: a Panama hat, Florida oranges, a Bunsen burner ; Vir- 
ginian, Spenserian, Newtonian, Icelandic, Miltonic, Byronic, Turkish, 
English, Veronese. 
Nore. Many so-called proper adjectives begin with a small letter because 
their origin is forgotten or disregarded: as, — china dishes, italic type, mes- 
meric power, a jovial air, a saturnine expression, a mercurial temperament, 
a stentorian voice. 
171. Definitive adjectives include : — pronouns used as adjec- 
tives (as, this opportunity ; those pictures; either table; what 
time is it?) ; numeral adjectives (as, two stars; the third year) ; 
the articles, a (or an) and the.
-P-A-G-E-94
  
76 ADJECTIVES 
Pronouns used as adjectives (often called pronominal ad- 
jectives) have been studied under Pronouns — demonstratives 
(§§ 181-184), indefinites (§$§ 135-142), relatives (§§ 143-162), 
interrogatives (§§ 163-167). 
Numeral adjectives will be treated, along with other numerals 
(nouns and adverbs), in §§ 204-208. 
The articles will be treated in §§ 173-180. 
172. Adjectives may be classified, according to their position 
in the sentence, as attributive, appositive, and predicate adjectives. 
1. An attributive adjective is closely attached to its noun and 
regularly precedes it. 
The angry spot doth glow on Czsar’s brow. 
O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome! 
Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look. 
itive adjective is added to its noun to explain it, 
pposition (§ 88, 5).    
Noun 1x APposiITion APPOSITIVE ADJECTIVE 
The castle, a ruin, stood on the The castle, ancient and ruinous, 
edge of the cliff. stood-on the edge of the cli, 
Bertram, the ringleader, refused Bertram, undaunted; retuséd to 
to surrender. surrender. 
3. A predicate adjective completes the meaning of the predicate 
verb, but describes or limits the subject. 
Predicate adjectives are common after ¢s (in its various forms) 
and other copulative verbs, particularly become and seem (§ 17). 
The sea is rough to-day. 
Burton soon became cautious in his judgments. 
You seem anxious about your future. 
The air grew hot and sultry. 
Our first experiment proved unsuccessful. 
The milk turned sour. 
Our agent proved trustworthy. 
Nore. The construction of the predicate adjective is similar to that of the 
predicate nominative (§ 88,2). Both are known as complements, because they 
complete the meaning of a verb. 
 
-P-A-G-E-95
  ARTICLES 17 
After look, sound, taste, smell, feel, a predicate adjective is 
used to describe the subject. Thus, — 
Your flowers look thrifty. [Nor: look thriftily.] 
Their voices sound shrill. [Nor: sound shrilly.] 
This apple tastes sweet. [Nor: tastes sweetly.] 
The air smells good. [Nor: smells well.] 
The patient feels comfortable. [Nor: feels comfortably.] 
For predicate adjectives after passive verbs, see § 492. 
For the use of an adjective as predicate objective, see § 104. 
THE ARTICLES 
178. The adjectives a (or an) and the are called articles. 
1. The definite article the points out one or more particular objects as 
distinct from others of the same kind. 
The train is late. 
Here is the key. — 
The children are in the next room. 
2. The indefinite article a (or an) designates an object as merely one 
of a general class or kind. 
Lend me a pencil. 
I have a cold. 
A young man answered my knock. 
The article a is a fragment of an (pronounced ahn), the 
ancient form of the numeral one; an keeps the n, which a 
has lost. Zhe is an old demonstrative, related to that. 
174. The with a singular noun sometimes indicates a class 
or kind of objects. 
The scholar is not necessarily a dryasdust. 
The elephant is the largest of quadrupeds. 
The aéroplane is a very recent invention. 
Resin is obtained from the pine. 
Nore. In this use the is often called the generic article (from the Latin 
genus, “kind” or sort”). The singylar number with the generic the is prac- 
tically equivalent to the plural without an article. Thus in the first example 
the sense would be the same if we had, ‘Scholars are not necessarily dryas- 
dusts.”

  78 ADJECTIVES 
175. An adjective preceded by the may be used as a plural 
noun. 
, The brave are honored, 
The rich have many cares. 
The strong should protect the weak. 
176. An is used before words beginning with a vowel or silent h; 
a before other words. Thus, — 
an owl; an apple; an honest man; a stone ; a pear. 
177. Special rules for a or an are the following : — 
1. Before words beginning with the sound of y or w, the 
form a, not an, is used. 
EXAMPLES: a union, a university, a yew, a ewe, a eulogy, a Utopian 
scheme, such a one. 
This rule covers all words beginning with ew and many beginning with u. 
Note that the initial sound is a consonant, not a vowel. An was formerly 
common before such words (as,—an union, such an one), but a is now the 
settled form. 
2. Before words beginning with / and not accented on the 
first syllable, an is often used. Thus, we say — 
a his‘tory; But, an histor’ical novel. 
In such cases, the 4 is very weak in sound, and is sometimes quite silent, 
so that the word practically begins with a vowel. Usage varies, but careful 
writers favor the rule here given. dn was formerly more common before h 
than at present. 
178. With two or more connected nouns or adjectives the 
article should be repeated whenever clearness requires (cf. §123). 
I have consulted the secretary and the treasurer. [‘*The secretary and 
treasurer’ would imply that the same person held both offices.] 
I found an anchor and a chain, [‘tAn anchor and chain ” would suggest 
,that the chain was attached to the anchor.] 
In some towns there are separate schools for the boys and the girls; 
in others the boys and girls attend the same schools. 
He waved a red and white flag. 
He waved a red and a white flag.

  COMPARISON OF ADJECTIVES 79 
179. A is often used distributively, in the sense of each. 
I paid five dollars a pair for my shoes. 
The letter-carrier calls twice a day. 
My class meets three times a week. 
In such phrases a is better than per, except in strictly commercial language. 
180. When used with adjectives, the articles precede, except 
in a few phrases: as, — 
Such an uproar was never heard. 
Many a man has tried in vain. 
For the adverb the, which is quite distinct from the article in use and 
meaning, see § 195. 
For the preposition a (as in ‘‘ He went a-fishing”), see § 352. 
COMPARISON OF ADJECTIVES 
181. In comparing objects with each other, we may use three 
different forms of the same adjective. 
Thomas is strong. 
William is stronger than Thomas. 
Herbert is strongest of the three. 
This inflection of adjectives is called comparison, and the 
three forms are called degrees of comparison. 
182. The degrees of comparison indicate by their form in what degree 
of intensity the quality described by the adjective exists. 
There are three degrees of comparison, — the positive, the compara- 
tive, and the superlative. 
1. The positive degree is the simplest form of the adjective, and has 
no special ending. 
It merely describes the quality, without expressing or sug- 
gesting any comparison. 
Thomas is strong. 
Thus, the positive degree of the adjective strong is strong.
-P-A-G-E-98
  80 ADJECTIVES 
2. The comparative degree of an adjective is formed by adding the 
termination er to the positive degree. 
It denotes that the quality exists in the object described in 
a higher degree than in some other object. 
William is stronger than Thomas. 
Thus, the comparative degree of the adjective strong is stronger. 
8. The superlative degree is formed by adding est to the positive 
degree. 
It denotes that the quality exists in the highest degree in 
the object described. 
Herbert is strongest of the three. 
Other examples of the comparison of adjectives are : — 
Positive DEGREE Comparative DEGREE SuPeRLatIve DEGREE 
rich richer richest 
poor poorer poorest 
fast faster fastest 
firm firmer firmest 
183. Ruzzs or SPELLING. 
1. Adjectives ending in silent e drop this letter before the 
comparative ending er and the superlative ending est. Thus, — 
wise, wiser, wisest; pure, purer, purest; handsome, handsomer, 
handsomest. 
2. Most adjectives ending in y change y to 7 before the end- 
ings er and est. Thus, — 
silky, silkier, silkiest ; glossy, glossier, glossiest ; sorry, sorrier, sorriest. 
3. Adjectives having a short vowel and ending in a single 
consonant double this before the endings er and est. Thus, — 
dim, dimmer, dimmest ; sad, sadder, saddest ; fit, fitter, fittest ; big, 
bigger, biggest ; red, redder, reddest ; hot, hotter, hottest.
-P-A-G-E-99
  IRREGULAR COMPARISON 81 
184. Many adjectives are compared by prefixing the adverbs more and 
most to the positive degree. 
Many adjectives of two syllables and most adjectives of 
three or more syllables are so compared. Thus, — 
recent, more recent, most recent ; terrible, more terrible, most terrible ; 
triumphant, more triumphant, most triumphant ; economical, more eco- 
nomical, most economical. 
Some adjectives may be compared in either way. 
Exampres: intense, intenser, intensest; or intense, more intense, 
most intense. So also— profound, sublime, unkind. 
Nors. The adverbs Jess and least may be used with an adjective, if one 
wishes to run down the scale of comparison : as, — terrible, less terrible, least 
terrible. This idiom, however, should not be regarded as comparison of the 
adjective. ‘‘ Superlative” means ‘‘in the highest degree,” and is not applica- 
ble to least terrible, which means “terrible in the lowest degree.” 
IRREGULAR COMPARISON 
185. Several adjectives have irregular comparison. 
Positive CoMPARATIVE SUPERLATIVE 
bad (evil, ill) worse worst, 
far farther farthest 
— further furthest 
good better best. 
late later, latter latest, last 
well (in health) better a 
little less, lesser least 
much, many more most 
Old has comparative older or elder, superlative oldest or eldest. 
Elder or eldest may be used with certain nouns of relation- 
ship, or in the phrases the elder and the eldest. 
This is my elder brother. My brother is older than yours. 
Jane was the eldest of six children. I shall wear my oldest clothes. 
Elder is also used as a noun: as, — ‘t You should respect your elders.” 
1In some of these cases the comparative and superlative are really differ- 
ent words from the positive.
-P-A-G-E-100
  82 ADJECTIVES 
Neat is a superlative of nigh. It is used only in the sense of 
“the very nearest.” 
I live in the nezt street. 
The neat time he comes, I shall refuse to see him. 
186. A few superlatives end in -most. With these, one or 
both of the other degrees are commonly wanting. 
  
  Positive CoMPARATIVE SUPERLATIVE 
— (former) foremost 
hind hinder hindmost 
— inner inmost, innermost 
outer outmost, outermost 
Kone aaee®) (utter) utmost, uttermost 
(up, adverb) upper uppermost 
— endmost. 
— nether nethermost 
top — topmost 
— oe furthermost 
north — northmost, 
northern (more northern) northernmost 
south southmost. 
southern (more southern) southernmost 
east, eastern (more eastern) easternmost 
west, western (more western) westernmost, 
Nore. The ending -most is not the adverb most. It is a very old superla- 
tive ending -mest changed under the influence of the adverb most. 
187. For adjectives incapable of comparison, see § 202. For 
special rules for the use of comparative and superlative, see 
§§ 199-203. 
188. In parsing an adjective, tell whether it is descriptive or 
definitive, mention the substantive to which it belongs, and 
specify the degree of comparison.

  ADVERBS 83 
CHAPTER V 
ADVERBS 
189. An adverb is a word which modifies a verb, an adjective, or 
another adverb. 
The storm ceased suddenly. 
A very disastrous storm swept the coast. 
The storm ceased very, suddenly. 
190. Adverbs are classified according to their meaning as: 
(1) adverbs of manner; (2) adverbs of time; (3) adverbs of 
place; (4) adverbs of degree. 
1. Adverbs of manner answer the question “How?” “In 
what way?” 
They modify verbs or adjectives, rarely adverbs. Most of 
them are formed from adjectives by adding ly. 
Tom answered courageously. 
The poor child looked helplessly about. 
Softly and silently fell the snow, 
The pain was terribly severe. 
The river rose surprisingly fast. 
2. Adverbs of time answer the question “ When?” They 
usually modify verbs. Thus, — 
The old castle is now a museum, 
He was recently promoted. 
I have been disturbed lately. 
My friend arrives to-day. 
James was then a boy of seven. 
I have already rung the bell. 
Afterwards he regretted his haste. 
1 The four classes are not absolute, for the same adverb may be used in 
different senses and thus belong to different classes. Sometimes, too, there is 
room for difference of opinion. Thus in the fourth and fifth examples under 1, 
terribly and surprisingly are equivalent to ‘in a terrible (or surprising) man- 
ner,” and therefore are classified as adverbs of manner; but they may also be 
regarded as adverbs of degree.  
-P-A-G-E-102
  84 ADVERBS 
8. Adverbs of place answer the question “ Where?” They 
usually modify verbs. Thus, — 
Come here. 
Yonder stands the culprit. 
An old sailor came forward. 
My sister is out. 
I was abroad that winter. 
4, Adverbs of degree answer the question “'To what degree 
or extent?” They modify verbs, adjectives, and adverbs, 
Thus, — 
Arthur is rather tall. 
Father was much pleased, 
Father was very much pleased. 
The task seemed utterly hopeless. 
That is hardly possible. 
That is not possible. 
191. Some adverbs have the same form as the correspond- 
ing adjectives. 
You have guessed right. 
How fast the tide ebbs ! 
The horse was sold cheap. 
Tired men sleep sound. 
Other examples are : — wrong, straight, early, late, quick, hard, far, 
near, slow, high, low, loud, ill, well, deep, close, just, very, much, little. 
Under this head come certain adverbs of degree used to 
modify adjectives. 
His eyes were dark blue. [Compare : very blue.] 
That silk is light yellow. [Compare : rather yellow.] 
These flowers are deep purple. [Compare: intensely purple.] 
The water was icy cold. [Compare : extremely cold.] 
That dark, light, etc., are adverbs in this use appears from the fact that 
they answer the question ‘How ?” Thus, — ‘His eyes were blue.” ‘ How 
blue?” ‘ Dark blue.” 
Norr. In the oldest English many adverbs ended in -é, as if formed 
directly from adjectives by means of this ending. Thus, the adjective for hot 
was hat, side by side with which was an adverb haté (dissyllabic), meaning 
hotly. In the fourteenth century this distinction was still kept up. Thus,  
-P-A-G-E-103
  ADVERBS 85 
Chaucer used both the adjective 2é¢ and the dissyllabic adverb hoté, meaning 
hotly. Between 1400 and 1500 all weak final e’s disappeared from the language. 
In this way the adverb hoté, for example, became simply hot. Thus these ad- 
verbs in -é became identical in form with the corresponding adjectives. Hence 
in the time of Shakspere there existed, in common use, not only the adjective 
hot, but also the adverb hot (identical in form with the adjective but really 
descended from the adverb hoté). One could say not only ‘t The fire is hot” 
(adjective), but ‘‘ The fire burns hot” (adverb of manner). 
The tendency in modern English has been to confine the form without end- 
ing to the adjective use and to restrict the adverbial function to forms in -ly. 
Thus, a writer of the present time would not say, in prose, ‘‘ The fire burns 
hot,” but “ The fire burns hotly.” Nevertheless, a number of the old adverbs 
without ending still remain in good use, and must not be regarded as erroneous. 
In poetry, moreover, such adverbs are freely employed; as,—‘t The boy 
like a gray goshawk stared wild.” [In prose: stared wildly.] 
For adverbial phrases, see §§ 41-42, 475. 
For the adverbial objective, see § 109. 
192. Yes and no are peculiar adverbs used in assenting and 
denying. Thus, — Are you hungry ? 
No. 
Nore. As now used, yes and no stand for camplete sentences. Originally, 
however, they were modifiers, and hence they are still classed as adverbs. 
The original meaning of no was ‘“‘never.” Compare never as an emphatic 
negative in modern English: as, —‘* Will you surrender?” ‘Wever!” The 
oldest affirmative adverb was yea. Yes was originally a compound of yea 
with a form of so, and was used in emphatic affirmatives (like our just so /). 
Other adverbs or adverbial phrases are sometimes used like yes or no. 
Such are certainly, assuredly, by no means, not at all. In these cases, how- 
ever, the modifying effect of the word or phrase may easily be seen when the 
sentence is supplied. Thus,—‘ Will you help me?” ‘Certainly [I will 
help you].” 
193. There is often used merely to introduce a sentence in 
the inverted order (§ 5). 
There is a hole in my shoe. 
There are many strangers in town. 
There rose a thick smoke from the volcano. 
In this use, there is sometimes called an expletive (or “filler”). 
It is unemphatic, and has lost all its force as an adverb of place. 
Contrast ‘Torre [emphatic]stood an Indian under a tree” with, 
“There [unemphatic expletive] stood an Indian under a tree,”
-P-A-G-E-104
  86 ADVERBS 
RELATIVE AND INTERROGATIVE ADVERBS 
194. Relative adverbs introduce subordinate clauses and are ‘similar 
in their use to relative pronouns. 
I know a farmhouse { "7, Ben pre can spend the night. 
Where is an adverb of place, modifying can spend. But it also 
introduces the subordinate clause, as the relative pronoun which 
does. Hence where is called a relative adverb. 
195. The principal relative adverbs are:— where, whence, 
whither, wherever, when, whenever, while, as, how, why, before, 
after, till, until, since. 
Because of their similarity to conjunctions, these words are often called 
conjunctive adverbs. 
He had a fever when he was in Spain. 
Work while it is day. 
As the ship passed, we observed that her decks were crowded with 
Malays. [Time.] 
Keep to the right, as the law directs. [Manner.] 
You started before I was ready. 
Wait until the car stops. 
Since you came, it has rained constantly. 
As and since in the sense of ‘* because,” and while in the sense of “ although,” 
are classed as conjunctions (§ 368). 
The clauses introduced by relative adverbs may be either 
adjective or adverbial ($§ 49-50, 379-382). 
Nore. In ‘t The more you waste, the sooner you will want” (and similar 
sentences) the is not an article, but an old case-form of the pronoun that, used 
as an adverb of degree. We may expand the sentence as follows: ‘t To what 
extent you waste more, to that extent you will want sooner.” Thus it appears 
that the first the has a relative force, and the second the a demonstrative force. 
196. An interrogative adverb introduces a question. 
Where, when, whence, whither, how, why, may be used as 
interrogative adverbs. Thus, — 
Where are you going ? 
Why must you go?  
-P-A-G-E-105
  
COMPARISON OF ADVERBS 87 
COMPARISON OF ADVERBS 
197. Adverbs have three degrees of comparison, — the positive, the 
comparative, and the superlative. 
1. Most adverbs are compared by means of more and most. 
John came promptly. [Positive.] 
Richard came more promptly than John. [Comparative.] 
Henry came most promptly of all. [Superlative.] 
2. A few adverbs are compared by means of the endings er and 
est. Thus, — 
PosivTIve CoMPARATIVE SUPERLATIVE 
near nearer nearest 
soon sooner soonest, 
Further examples are: — cheap, dear, early, fast, hard, high, long, loud, 
quick, slow, deep. 
Some adverbs are compared in both ways. Thus,— 
often, oftener or more often, oftenest or most often. 
198. Several adverbs have irregular comparison. 
Positive ComPARATIVE SuPERLATIVE 
far farther farthest, 
forth further furthest 
ill t dct worse worst. 
F igh nigh nigher { Snak 
well better best 
i 1k latest ate ater ant 
little less least 
much more most, 
These adverbs in the main have the same forms as the adjectives studied 
in §185 above. Note, however: (1) that good and bad are never adverbs; 
(2) that 422 and well, better and best, worse and worst, may be either adverbs 
or adjectives. Rather is now used in the comparative only. 
1 Many comparatives and superlatives in er and est that are no longer 
allowable in prose are still used in poetry.
-P-A-G-E-106
  88 USE OF COMPARISON 
USE OF THE COMPARATIVE AND SUPERLATIVE 
199. The comparative degree, not the superlative, is used in compar- 
ing two persons or things. 
The superlative is used in comparing one person or thing with two 
or more. 
Mary is the more agreeable of the two. 
Mary is the most agreeable of all the family. 
I like both Mary and Jane, but I am fondest of Mary. 
Wrone :< I am studying Latin, history, and geometry, but I dislike 
the latter. Rieut: 
The same principle applies to adverbs. 
John runs faster than Tom. [Here the acts of two persons are com- 
pared. ] 
Which of you three can run fastest ? [Here the acts of more than two 
are compared. ] 
Nore. In older English the superlative sometimes occurs when only two 
objects are thought of. This use is still found in a few proverbial phrases: 
as, —‘* Put your best foot foremost.” 
200. The superlative is sometimes used merely for emphasis, 
without implying any definite comparison: as, —“* My dearest 
Kate!” 
The superlative of emphasis is very common with most. 
Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors. — SHaKsPERE. 
Justice had been most cruelly defrauded. — Worpswortu. 
Excessive use of this construction (like frequent repetition of very) is tire- 
some and weakens style. 
Double comparison (as more worthier, most unkindest) is common in older 
English, but is now a gross error. 
201. When two adjectives or adverbs are contrasted by 
means of than, more is used with the first. 
Such indulgence is more kind than wise. 
This scheme is more clever than honest. 
He acts more boldly than discreetly. 
Nore. The adverb rather is often used with the first adjective or adverb 
(as, —‘‘ rather kind than wise” or “kind rather than wise), but in a slightly 
different sense,
-P-A-G-E-107
  NUMERALS 89 
202. Many adjectives and adverbs are, from their meaning, 
incapable of comparison. Such are : — 
1. Adjectives expressing a quality as absolute or complete, 
and adverbs derived from such adjectives. 
Exampres: unique, universal, single, matchless, instantaneous, trian- 
gular, everlasting, infinite, mortal; uniquely, singly, eternally, mortally. 
2. The adverbs here, there, then, now, when, and the like. 
Nore. Words like perfect, exact, straight, etc., are commonly said to be 
incapable of comparison, but this is an error. For each of these words may 
vary in sense. When perfect (for example) denotes absolute perfection, it 
cannot be compared. But perfect has also another sense: namely, “ partaking 
in a higher or lower degree of the qualities that make up absolute perfection,” 
so that we may describe one statue as more perfect than another, or one of 
three statues as the most perfect of them all. In this use, which is unobjec- 
tionable, we simply admit that nothing in the world is absolutely flawless, 
and assert that the three statues approach ideal perfection in various degrees. 
203. An adjective phrase may sometimes be compared by 
means of more and most. 
I was never more out of humor [= more vexed]. 
I think your last suggestion most in keeping [= most appropriate]. 
NUMERALS — ADJECTIVES, NOUNS, AND ADVERBS 
204. Words indicating number are called numerals. They are adjec- 
tives, nouns, or adverbs. 
There are seven days in the week. [Adjective.] 
Twelve make a dozen. [Noun.] 
I have called twice. [Adverb.] 
205. The chief classes of numerals are cardinals and ordinals. 
1. Cardinal numeral adjectives (one, two, three, four, etc.) are used in 
counting, and answer the question ‘How many?” 
I had to pay three dollars. 
There were forty-two vessels in the fleet. 
Nore. In such expressions as ‘t The boy was sixteen,” the numeral is a 
predicate adjective limiting boy (§ 172, 3). We need not expand sixteen to 
“sixteen years old.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-108
  90 NUMERALS 
2. Ordinal numeral adjectives (Jirst, second, third, etc.) denote the 
position or order of a person or thing in a series. 
Carl plays the second violin. 
Your friend is sitting in the fifth row. 
206. All the cardinal and ordinal numerals may become 
nouns and may take a plural ending in some of their senses. 
One is enough. 
Four are missing. 
The nine played an excellent game. 
Three twos are six. 
The men formed by fours. 
Thousands perished by the way. 
Eight is two thirds of twelve. [So regularly in fractional parts.] 
Nore. Hundred, thousand, million were originally nouns, but are now 
equally common as adjectives. Other numeral nouns are: —twain, couple, 
pair, brace, trio, quartette, quintette, foursome, dozen, score, century. 
207. Certain numeral adjectives (single, double, triple, ete.) 
indicate how many times a thing is taken or of how many like 
parts it consists. 
A double row of policemen stood on guard. 
A fourfold layer of chilled steel forms the door. 
Some of these words may be used as adverbs. 
The cabman charged double. 
His fear increased tenfold. 
208. Certain numeral adverbs and adverbial phrases indicate 
how many times an action takes place. 
Once my assailant slipped. 
I rang the bell twice. 
The river hath thrice flow’d, no ebb between. — SHaKsPERE. 
The only adverbs of this kind in ordinary use are once and twice. For 
larger numbers an adverbial phrase (three times, four times, etc.) is employed. 
Thrice, however, is still common in poetry and the solemn style.

  CLASSIFICATION OF VERBS 91 
CHAPTER VI 
VERBS 
CLASSIFICATION OF VERBS 
209. A verb is a word which can assert something (usually an 
action) concerning a person, place, or thing (§ 14). 
Most verbs express action. Some, however, merely express 
state or condition. Thus, — 
1. We jumped for joy. 
Rabbits burrow into the sides of hills. 
2. While memory lasts, I can never forget you. 
This mountain belongs to the Appalachian range. 
A verb-phrase is a group of words that is used as a verb (§ 15). 
The leaves are turning. 
The money has been found. 
210. Certain verbs, when used to make verb-phrases, are 
called auxiliary (that is, “aiding”) verbs, because they help 
other verbs to express action or state of some particular 
kind (§ 16). 
The auxiliary verbs are is (are, was, were, etc.), may, can, 
must, might, shall, will, could, would, should, have, had, do, did. 
I am writing. He has forgotten me. 
We must go. We had failed. 
You will fall. _ I do see him. 
The auxiliary verb may be separated from the rest of the 
verb-phrase by other words. 
I have always liked him. 
I shall soon send for you. 
Robert was completely bewildered. 
He has hardly ever spoken to me. 
 
-P-A-G-E-110
  92° VERBS 
211. Verbs are either transitive or intransitive (§ 99). 
Some verbs may be followed by a substantive denoting that which 
receives the action or is produced by it. These are called transitive 
verbs. All other verbs are called intransitive. 
A substantive that completes the meaning of a transitive verb is 
called its direct object. 
In the following sentences, the first four verbs are transitive 
(with objects), the last five are intransitive (without objects) : — 
Lightning shattered the oak. 
Clouds darkened the sky. 
Chemists extract radium from pitchblende. 
The orator quoted Tennyson incorrectly. 
Look where he stands and glares! 
The bankrupt absconded. 
The orange sky of evening died away. 
The words differ in a single letter. 
212. A verb which is transitive in one of its senses may be intransi- 
tive in another. 
TRANSITIVE INTRANSITIVE 
(witn Oxsxcr) (wirHouT OBgEcT) 
Boys fly kites. Birds fly. 
The pirates sank the ship. The stone sank. 
I closed my eyes. School closed yesterday. 
Tom tore his coat. The cloth tore easily. 
213. Many transitive verbs may be used absolutely, — that is, merely 
to express action without any indication of the direct object. 
TRANSITIVE VERB TRANSITIVE VERB 
WITH OBJECT EXPRESSED USED ABSOLUTELY 
The horses drank water. The horses drank from the brook. 
The farmer plows his fields. The farmer plows in the spring. 
Charles is drawing a picture. Charles is drawing. 
There is a sharp contrast between a transitive verb used 
absolutely and a real intransitive verb. To the former we can 
always add an object; with the latter no object is possible.
-P-A-G-E-111
  
CLASSIFICATION OF VERBS 93 
214. Is (in its various forms) and several other verbs may 
be used to frame sentences in which some word or words in 
the predicate describe or define the subject (§ 17). 
Such verbs are called copulative (that is, “ joining”) verbs. 
Zs in this use is often called the copula (or ‘‘link’’). 
Time is money. 
Grant was a tireless worker. 
Macbeth became a tyrant. 
His swans always prove geese. 
The current is sluggish. 
Lions are carnivorous. 
This village looks prosperous. 
The consul’s brow grew stern. 
The queen turned pale. 
In the first four examples, the copulative verb (the simple 
predicate *) is followed by a predicate nominative (§ 88, 2); 
in the last five by a predicate adjective (§ 172, 3). 
The copulative verbs are intransitive, since they take no object. Some- 
times, however, they are regarded as a third class distinct both from transitive 
and intransitive verbs. 
215. The verb és is not always a copula. It is sometimes 
emphatic and has the sense of exist. 
I think. Therefore I am. [That is, I exist.] 
Whatever is, is right. [The second is is the copula.] 
Most of the other copulative verbs may be used in some 
sense in which they cease to be copulative. 
The lawyer proved his case. 
Walnut trees grow slowly. 
Mr. Watson grows peaches. 
The wheel turned slowly on the axle, 
He turned his head and looked at me. 
1 Many grammarians regard is and the noun or adjective that follows it 
(is money, etc.) as the simple predicate; but the nomenclature here adopted 
is equally scientific and more convenient.

INFLECTION OF VERBS 
216. Verbs have inflections of tense, person and number, and 
mood. They also have the distinction of voice, which is ex- 
pressed by the help of verb-phrases. a 
Tense indicates time; person and number correspond with per- 
son and number in substantives; mood shows the manner in 
which the action is expressed; voice indicates whether the 
subject acts or is acted upon. 
TENSE OF VERBS 
217. The tense of a verb indicates its time.1 
Verbs have forms of tense to indicate present, past, or future time. 
1, A verb in the present tense refers to present time. 
2. A verb in the past tense refers to past time.” 
8. A verb in the future tense refers to future time. 
The present, the past, and the future are called simple tenses. 
Present TENSE Pasr Tense ’ Fourure Tense 
He lives here. He lived here. He will live here. 
The sun shines. The sun shone. The sun will shine 
Lknow him. I knew him. I shall know him. 
FORMS OF THE PRESENT AND THE PAST 
218. The present and the past tense have special forms of 
inflection. 
For the moment we will consider the form which the verb 
has when its subject is the first personal pronoun I. 
In the present tense the verb has its simplest form, without any 
inflectional ending. 
I like it. I dwell in the wilderness. 
I hope for the best. I find him amusing. 
1 The word tense is simply an English form of the French word for time. 
2 The past tense is often called the preterite (from a Latin word meaning 
“gone by”). Preterite isin some ways a better name for the tense than past, 
since both the perfect and the pluperfect tenses also refer to past time.
-P-A-G-E-113
FORMS OF THE PRESENT AND THE PAST 95 
219. The past tense is formed in two ways, and a verb is 
classed as weak or strong in accordance with the way in which 
it forms this tense. 
1. Weak verbs form the past tense by adding ed, d, or ¢ to the present. 
Examp.es : mend, mended ; select, selected ; fill, filled ; glow, glowed ; 
talk, talked ; revere, revered ; dwell, dwelt. 
2. Strong verbs form the past tense by changing the vowel of the 
present, without the addition of an ending. 
Examptus: drink, drank ; begin, began ; come, came ; rise, rose ; bind, 
bound ; cling, clung ; stick, stuck ; wear, wore.1 
Weak verbs are sometimes called regular, and strong verbs 
irregular verbs. 
For a list of the strong verbs see pp. 291-297. 
Nore. The terms strong and weak were first applied to verbs for a some- 
what fanciful reason. The strong verbs were so called because they seemed to 
form the past tense out of their own resources, without calling to their assist- 
ance any ending. The weak verbs were so called because they could not form 
the past tense without the aid of the ending ed, d, or t. 
220. The ending that is written ed is fully pronounced only 
when d or ¢ precedes (as, — thread, threaded ; attract, attracted). 
Otherwise, ¢ is silent, so that the ending becomes, in pronun- 
ciation, d or t¢ (as,— entered, pronounced enter’d ; rocked, 
pronounced rockt). 
In poetry and the solemn style, however, the silent e in the 
ending ed is sometimes restored to its ancient rights. 
221. Many weak verbs show special irregularities in the 
past tense. 
1. Make has made in the past, and have has had. 
2. Some verbs in -nd and -/d form their past tense by chang- 
ing this d to ¢. 
Exampres: bend, bent; send, sent; lend, lent; rend, rent; spend, 
spent ; build, built. 
1 Silent final e is not counted as an ending.
-P-A-G-E-114
96° VERBS 
3. A few verbs add d or ¢ in the past and also change the 
vowel of the present. Thus, — 
sell sold buy bought 
tell told catch caught 
shoe shod seek sought 
say said (pronounced sed) beseech _ besought. 
hear heard (pronounced herd) teach taught 
bring brought methinks methought 
Work has an old past tense wrought, common in poetry ; its usual past is 
worked. For must, would, etc., see p. 299. 
4, Some verbs that have a long vowel sound in the present 
have in the past a short vowel sound before the ending ¢. 
Examp ss : creep, crept ; keep, kept ; sleep, slept ; sweep, swept ; weep, 
wept ; feel, felt ; deal, dealt (pronounced delt) ; mean, meant (pronounced 
ment) ; lose, lost ; leave, left.1 
5. Some verbs in d or ¢ preceded by a long vowel sound have 
a short vowel in the past but add no ending. 
Examptes: bleed, bled; breed, bred ; feed, fed; speed, sped; lead, 
led ; read (pronounced reed), read (pronounced red) ; meet, met; light, 
lit (also lighted). 
6. Some verbs in d or ¢ have in the past the same form as 
in the present. 
Exampces: shed, past shed ; spread, past spread ; bet, past bet ; hit, 
past hit; set, past set; put, past put; shut, past shut; cut, past cut; 
hurt, past hurt ; cast, past cast. 
Nore. The verbs in 5 and 6 might appear to be strong verbs, since they 
have no ending in the past and some of them change the vowel. They are, 
however, all weak verbs. Their lack of ending is due to the fact that the 
d or t of the termination has been absorbed in the final d or ¢ of the verb 
itself. Thus, the past set was originally setté (dissyllabic), and this form, after 
the loss of -€, became indistinguishable in sound from se¢, the present. 
For lists of irregular weak verbs, see pp. 291-299. 
1 Notice also the change from » to f before ¢.

PERSON AND NUMBER 97 
PERSON AND NUMBER—THE PERSONAL ENDINGS 
222. A verb must agree with its subject in number and person. 
Verbs, like substantives, have two numbers (singular and plural) and 
three persons (first, second, and third). 
The singular number denotes a single person or thing. The plural 
number denotes more than one person or thing. 
The first person denotes the speaker; the second person denotes the 
person spoken to; the third person denotes the person or thing spoken of. 
223. The inflections Peeragh and number in verbs may be 
seen by framing sentences with the personal pronouns as sub- 
jects. Thus, — ee 
Present TENSE 
SINGULAR PLURAL

2. Thou walk-est. 2. You walk. 
3. He walk-s [old form, walk-eth]. 3. They walk. 
Past TENSE 
SINGULAR PLURAL 
1, I walked. 1. We walked. 
2. Thou walked-st. 2. You walked. 
3. He walked. 3. They walked. 
From the sentences it is evident (1) that the person and num- 
ber of a verb are usually shown by its subject only, but (2) 
that some verb-forms have special endings which denote person 
and number. 
224. The endings by means of which a verb indicates person and 
number are called personal endings. 
1. In the present tense a verb has two personal endings, est 
for the second person singular and s for the third person sin- 
gular (old form eth). 
The first person singular and all three persons of the plural 
are alike. The simplest form of the verb is used and no per 
sonal ending is added.
-P-A-G-E-116
  98 VERBS 
2. The past tense has but one personal ending, — est or st in 
the second person singular.? 
The forms in es¢ or s¢ are confined to poetry and the solemn 
style. In ordinary language, the second person plural is used 
to address a single person. 
The following table shows the personal endings of the present 
and the past tense : —

Nors. The English verb formerly had more personal endings. In Chaucer, 
for instance, the typical inflection of the present is: — 
SINGULAR PLURAL 
1. I walké. 1. We walken (or walké). 
2. Thou walkest. 2. Ye walken (or walké). 
3. He walketh. 3. They walken (or walké). 
The disappearance of all weak final e’s in the fifteenth century (§ 191) reduced 
the first person singular and the whole plural to the single form walk. Later, 
walks (a dialect form) was substituted for walketh, and still later the second 
person singular was replaced in ordinary use by the plural. The result has 
been that in modern speech there are only two common forms in the present 
tense, —walk and walks. In poetry and the solemn style, however, walkest and 
walketh are stillin use. The plural in en is frequently adopted by Spenser as 
an ancient form (or archaism) : as, — ‘‘ You deemen the spring is come.”

SrxcraL Rutzs or NuMBER AND PERSON 
226. When the subject is compound (§ 38), the number of 
the verb is determined by the following rules : — 
1. A compound subject with and usually takes a verb in the 
plural number. 
My brother and sister play tennis. 
The governor and the mayor are cousins. 
2. A compound subject with or or nor takes a verb in the 
singular number if the substantives are singular. 
Either my brother or my sister is sure to win. 
Neither the governor nor the mayor favors this appointment. 
8. A compound subject with and expressing but a single 
idea sometimes takes a verb in the singular number. 
The sum and substance [= gist] of the matter is this. 
Nors. This construction is rare in modern English prose. It is for the 
most part confined to such idiomatic phrases as end and aim (= purpose), the 
long and short of it, ete. The poets, however, use the construction freely (as 
in Kipling’s ‘“‘ The tumult and the shouting dies”). 
4, If the substantives connected by or or nor differ in num- 
ber or person, the verb usually agrees with the nearer. 
Either you or he is to blame. 
Neither you nor he is an Austrian. 
Neither John nor we were at home. 
Neither the mayor nor the aldermen favor this law. 
But colloquial usage varies, and such expressions are avoided 
by careful writers. The following sentences show how this may 
be done : — 
Either you are to blame, or he is. 
One of you two is to blame. 
Neither of you is an Austrian. 
He is not afraid; neither am I. 
Both John and we were away from home.
-P-A-G-E-119
  PERSON AND NUMBER 101 
227. In such expressions as the following, the subject is not 
compound, and the verb agrees with its singular subject :— 
The governor with his staff is present. 
John, as well as Mary, is in London. 
Tom, along with his friends Dick and Bob, is taking a sail. 
228. Nouns that are plural in form but singular in sense 
commonly take a verb in the singular number (§ 84). 
Economics is an important study. 
The gallows has been abolished in Massachusetts. 
In some words usage varies. Thus, pains, in the sense of care or effort, is 
sometimes regarded as a singular and sometimes as a plural. 
Great pains has (or have) been taken about the matter. 
229. Collective nouns take sometimes a singular and sometimes 
a plural verb. 
When the persons or things denoted are thought of as 
individuals, the plural should be used. When the collection is 
regarded as a unit, the singular should be used.? 
1. The Senior Class requests the pleasure of your company. [Here the 
class is thought of collectively, acting as a unit.] 
2. The Senior Class are unable to agree upon a president. [Here the 
speaker has in mind the individuals of whom the class is composed.] 
3. The nation welcomes Prince Joseph. [The whole nation unites as a 
single individual to welcome a distinguished guest.] 
4, The American nation are descended from every other nation on 
earth. [The separate qualities of the individuals who constitute the 
nation are in the speaker’s mind.] 
230. A number in the sense of “several” or “many ” regu- 
larly takes the plural; the number takes the singular 
A number of sailors were loitering on the pier. 
The number of tickets is limited. 
1 This rule is not absolute. Sometimes the distinction is unimportant, and 
the feeling of the moment often determines the number of the verb.

231. Half, part, portion, and the like, take either the sin-

Half of a circle is a semicircle. 
Half of the passengers were lost. 
232. A verb which has for its subject a relative pronoun is in 
the same person and number as the antecedent. For examples, 
see § 149. 
Errors are especially common in such sentences as,— 
This is one of the strangest sights that ever were seen. [The antece- 
dent of that is sights (not one) ; hence the relative (that) is plural, and 
accordingly the verb is plural (were, not was).] 
Mr. Winn’s oration was among the most eloquent that have [Nor has] 
been delivered in this state for many years. 
This is one of the finest paintings there are in the hall. [For the omission 
of the relative, see § 151.]

THE FUTURE TENSE 
233. The future tense is a verb-phrase consisting of the aux- 
iliary verb shall or will followed by the infinitive without to 
(§ 29). 
The following table shows the form of the future for each of 
the three persons (1) in assertions and (2) in questions : —

2. Shalt thou fall ? 2. Shall you fall ? 
3. Will he fall ? 3. Will they fall ?
-P-A-G-E-121
  FUTURE TENSE 103 
234. Common errors are the use of will for shall (1) in the 
first person in assertions and questions, and (2) in the second person 
in questions. 
In the following sentences the first person of the future 
tense is correctly formed : — 
I shall [Nor will] drown. Shall [nor will] I drown ? 
I shall [Nor will ] fail. Shall [or will] I fail ? . 
We shall [nor will] sink. Shall [wor will] we sink ? 
The verb-phrases with shail express merely the action of the 
verb in future time. They do not indicate any willingness or 
desire on the part of the subject. 
Contrast the following sentences, in which J will or we will 
is used : — 
I will go with you. 
I will give you what you ask. 
I will not endure it. ‘ 
We will allow you to enter. 
We will have the truth. 
Here the verb-phrases with wild do not (as in the previous 
examples of Z shall) express the action of the verb in future 
time. They express the present willingness or desire or determi- 
nation of the speaker to do something in the future. 
Hence such verb-phrases with wild in the first person are 
not forms of the future tense. They are special verb-phrases 
expressing willingness or desire. 
235. In the first person shall, not will, is the auxiliary of the future 
tense in both assertions and questions. It denotes simple futurity, with- 
out expressing willingness, desire, or determination. 
Will in the first person is used in promising, threatening, consenting, 
and expressing resolution. It never denotes simple futurity.

I will have obedience. [Resolution.] 
Pil and we’ll are contractions of J will and we will and can 
never stand for J shall and we shall. 
I'll meet you at noon. [Promise.] 
I’ll never consent. [Resolution.] 
We'll be revenged on you. [Threat.] 
236. When willingness is expressed by an adjective, I shall 
is correct; when by an adverb, J will. Thus,— 
I shall be glad to help you. 
I will gladly help you. 
Nors. Such expressions as I shall be glad, I shall be willing, I shall be 
charmed to do this, express willingness not by means of shall but in the adjec- 
tives glad, willing, charmed. To say, ‘‘I will be glad to do this,” then, would 
be wrong, for it would be to express volition twice. Such a sentence could 
only mean “I am determined to be glad to do this.” 
On the other hand, in ‘I will gladly help you,” volition is expressed by the 
verb-phrase will help and the adverb merely modifies the phrase by emphasiz- 
ing the speaker’s willingness. Hence J will is correct. 
237. Will, when emphasized, always expresses determination 
on the part of the subject, even in the second and third persons. 
I wit go, no matter what you say. 
You wILi 
Hon act foolishly, in spite of my advice. 
288. In the second person Shall you? not Will you? is the proper 
form of the future tense in questions. 
Will you ? always denotes willingness, consent, or determination, and 
never simple futurity. 
Note that in questions in the second person, the auxiliary 
used is the same as that expected in the answer.

Will you write often? [I will.]

the future tense in declarative sentences. 
It is used in commanding, promising, threatening, and express- 
ing resolution, the volition being that of the speaker. 
Thou shalt not kill. [Command.] 
You shall have the hat before Monday. [Promise.] 
You shall pay for this insult! [Threat.] 
She shall not regret her generosity. [Resolution.] 
In prophetic language, shali is common in the second and

the like.

COMPLETE OR COMPOUND TENSES 
242. Completed action is denoted by special verb-phrases made 
by prefixing to the past participle some form of the auxiliary 
verb have. f 
These are called the complete or compound tenses. 
There are three complete or compound tenses, —the perfect 
(or present perfect), the pluperfect (or past perfect), and the future 
perfect. 
1. The perfect (or present perfect) tense denotes that the action of 
the verb is complete at the time of speaking. It is formed by prefixing 
have (hast, has) to the past participle. 
I have learned my lesson. 
He has convinced me. 
Nore. With several verbs of motion the auxiliary be is sometimes used 
instead of have : as, —‘* My friends are gone” (or “have gone”) ; ‘* Your time 
is come” (or “has come”). 
2. The pluperfect (or past perfect) tense denotes that the action was 
completed at some point in past time. It is formed by prefixing had 
(hadst) to the past participle. 
Before night fell, I had finished the book. 
When Blake had spoken, Allen rose to reply. 
8. The future perfect tense denotes that the action will be completed 
at some point in future time. It is formed by prefixing the future tense 
of have (shall have, etc.) to the past participle. 
Before I hear from you again, I shall have landed at Naples. 
The future perfect tense is rare except in very formal writing.

VOICE— ACTIVE AND PASSIVE 
246. Voice is that property of verbs which indicates whether the 
subject acts or is acted upon. 
There are two voices, active and passive. 
1. A verb is in the active voice when it represents the subject as the 
doer of an act. 
Richard shot the bear. 
Mr. Hardy builds carriages. 
Dr. Wilson has cured my father. 
2. A verb is in the passive voice when it represents the subject as 
the receiver or the product of an action. 
The bear was shot by Richard. 
Carriages are built by Mr. Hardy. 
My father has been cured by Dr. ‘Wilson.

247. The passive voice of a verb is expressed by a verb-phrase made 
by prefixing some form of the copula (is, was, etc.) to the past participle. 
In the passive voice of the complete tenses, the past participle 
been follows the proper form of the auxiliary have (as in the 
third example in § 246, 2). 
The passive of the infinitive is made by prefixing to be (per- 
fect, to have been) to the past participle. Thus, — 
PRESENT INFINITIVE PASSIVE: to be struck.

249. Any sentence of which the predicate is a transitive 
verb followed by an object, may be changed from the active 
to the passive form without affecting the sense. 
Active. Richard shot the bear. 
Passive. The bear was shot by Richard. 
In this change, (1) bear, the object of the active verb 
shot, becomes the subject of the passive verb was shot ; and 
(2) Richard, the subject of the active verb shot, becomes by 
Richard, an adverbial phrase, modifying the passive verb was 
shot. Thus we have the rule: — 
The object of the active verb becomes the subject of the passive, and 
the subject of the active verb becomes in the passive an adverbial phrase 
modifying the predicate verb.

250. Intransitive verbs are ordinarily used in the active voice 
only. 
The bystanders laughed. The watchdogs bark. Snow is falling. 
251. An intransitive verb followed by a preposition is often 
used in the passive, the object of the preposition becoming the 
subject of the verb. 
ActivE VOICE Passive VoIce 
Everybody laughed at him. He was laughed at by everybody. 
The attorney general has not yet This bill has not yet been passed 
passed upon this bill. upon. 
He has tampered with this lock. This lock has been tampered with. 
The cart ran over me. I was run over by the cart. 
Other examples are: talk about (= discuss), look or inquire into 
(= investigate), look upon (= regard), jeer at (= deride), reason with, 
object to, insist upon, act upon. 
Nor. In this idiom, the preposition is treated like an ending attached to 
the verb to make it transitive. In other words, laugh at, pass upon, etc., are 
treated as compound verbs, and the object of the preposition is, in effect, the 
object of the compound. In the passive, this object becomes the subject and 
the preposition (now lacking an object) remains attached to the verb. The 
passive construction is well established, but not always graceful. 
252. The passive of some verbs of choosing, calling, naming, 
making, and thinking may be followed by a predicate nominative 
(8 88, 2).

Nore. In the active voice, these verbs may take two objects referring to 
the same person or thing, —a direct object and a predicate objective (§ 104). In 
the passive, the direct object becomes the subject, and the predicate objective 
becomes a predicate nominative, agreeing with the subject (§ 88, 2).

one of the two is often retained after the passive, the other 
becoming the subject. Thus, —

retained object. 
Nore. This construction, though common, is avoided by many careful | 
writers, except in a few well-established idioms. Its habitual use gives one’s 
style a heavy and awkward air. Instead of ‘tHe was given permission,” one 
may say ‘He received permission”’; instead of ‘tI was given this watch by 
my aunt,” either ‘‘It was my aunt who gave me this watch” or ‘‘ This watch 
was a present from my aunt.” 
254. The verb ask, which may take two direct objects, — 
one denoting the person, the other the thing, — sometimes 
retains its second object in the passive construction (§ 103). 
Active. We asked him his opinion. 
Passive. He was asked his opinion.

PROGRESSIVE VERB-PHRASES 113 
PROGRESSIVE VERB-PHRASES 
255. In addition to the tense-forms already described, verbs 
have so-called progressive forms. 
The progressive form of a tense represents the action of the verb as 
going on or continuing at the time referred to: 
I ate my dinner. 
I was eating my dinner. 
While I was quietly reading by my fireside, strange things were taking 
place in the square. 
Both ate and was eating are in the past tense. But ate merely 
expresses a past action, whereas was eating describes this action 
as continuing or in progress in past time. 
256. The progressive form is a verb-phrase made by prefixing to 
the present participle some form of the verb fo be.

257. In the passive, the progressive forms are confined to 
the present and the past tense. 
He is being helped by his brother. [Present.] 
I am being trained by Arthur Ray. [Present.] 
When I called, tea was being served. [Past.] 
258. In subordinate clauses, the verb és (in its various forms) 
with its subject is often omitted in progressive phrases. 
While waiting for the train, I bought a newspaper. [That is, While I 
was waiting.] 
Though [he was] swimming vigorously, he could not stem the tide. 
When [I am] reading, I like to have the light shine over my left 
shoulder. 
In parsing, the omitted words should be supplied. 
259. For such progressive forms as is building for is being 
built, see § 352. 
EMPHATIC VERB-PHRASES 
260. The present or the past of a verb in the active voice may be ex- 
pressed with emphasis by means of a verb-phrase consisting of do or did 
and the infinitive without to. 
Such a phrase is called the emphatic form of the present or past tense. 
I dosee you’’ and '*I did go”’ differ from ‘tI see you’’ and ** I went” 
merely in emphasis. Heénce do see is called the emphatic form of the present 
tense of see, and did go the emphatic form of the past tense of go. 
261. In questions and. in negative statements the emphatic 
forms are used without the effect of emphasis. 
Did you go? I did not go. 
Nore. Do often stands for some other verb which has just been used: as, — 
** Jack swims better than I do,’ *t You looked as tired as she did.” This idiom 
comes from the omission of the infinitive in the verb-phrase : — “‘ Jack swims 
better than I do [swim].” 
In poetry and older English the verb-phrase with do or did in declarative 
sentences often carries no emphasis, but merely takes the place of the present 
or past: as, —‘‘ The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.”

INDICATIVE MOOD 115 
MOOD OF VERBS 
262. Mood is that property of verbs which shows the manner in 
which the action or state is expressed. 
Mood (or mode) is derived from the Latin word modus, ‘‘ manner.” 
Compare the following sentences, noting the form of the 
verb in each : — 
Richard és quiet. 
Is Richard quiet ? 
If Richard were quiet, I might study. 
Richard, be quiet. 
In the first and second sentences, the form 7s is used to assert 
or question a fact; in the third, the form were expresses a con- 
dition or supposition that is contrary to fact; in the fourth, the 
form be expresses a command or request. 
The difference in form seen in the verb in these sentences is 
called a difference of mood. 
268. There are three moods, — the indicative, the imperative, and 
the subjunctive. 
1, The indicative is the mood of simple assertion or interrogation, but 
it is used in other constructions also. 
2. The imperative is the mood of command or request. 
8. The subjunctive mood is used in certain special constructions of 
wish, condition, and the like. 
Thus, in the examples in § 262, is is in the indicative, were 
in the subjunctive, and de in the imperative mood. 
I. INDICATIVE MOOD 
264. The ordinary forms of the indicative mood in the active 
and the passive voice and in all six tenses, — present, past, 
future, perfect (or present perfect), pluperfect (or past perfect), 
and future perfect, — may be seen in the table on pp. 108-110. 
For the progressive form of the indicative, see § 256; for the 
emphatic form, see § 260.
-P-A-G-E-134
  
  116 VERBS 
265. The commonest uses of the indicative mood are in state- 
ments or questions as to matters of fact; but it may express 
almost any other form of thought. Thus, — 
Time and tide wait for no man. [Assertion.] 
How goes the world with you? [Interrogation.] 
How it rains! [Exclamation.] 
If the river rises, the dam will be swept away. [Supposition.] 
I suspect that he has absconded. [Doubt.] 
I hope that John will come soon. [Desire.] 
Though Ellen dislikes algebra, she never shirks. [Concession.] 
You will report for duty immediately. [Command.] 
Will you allow me to use your knife ? [Request.] 
Nore. The indicative and the subjunctive were originally quite distinct 
in form, and each had its own set of constructions. But, as our language has 
grown simpler in its structure, the forms of these two moods have become 
almost identical, and the uses of the indicative have been greatly multiplied 
at the expense of the subjunctive. Indeed, there is scarcely any variety of 
thought expressed by the subjunctive or the imperative for which the indica- 
tive cannot also be employed. It is therefore impossible to frame any satisfac- 
tory definition of the indicative. Its functions are too varied to be included in 
one general statement. The indicative is often described as the mood which 
asserts thought as a fact, and the subjunctive as the mood which expresses 
thought as supposition (or as mere thought). But the indicative, as well as the 
subjunctive, may express supposition, condition, doubt, desire, concession, etc. 
Hence the definitions in § 263 are as exact as the facts of the language allow. 
All the efforts of grammarians to devise more “accurate” definitions break 
down when tested by actual usage. 
Il. IMPERATIVE MOOD 
266. The imperative is the mood of command or request. 
Hurry! Light the lamp. 
Lie down. Show us the way. 
Shut the door. Wait a moment. 
Have patience. Come to dinner. 
The imperative has both voices, active and passive, but only 
one tense, —the present. It has both numbers, the singular and 
the plural, but only one person, the second. It has the same 
form for both the singular and the plural.
-P-A-G-E-135
IMPERATIVE MOOD 117 
267. 1. The imperative active is the verb in its simplest form. 
For examples, see § 266. 
The imperative of the verb to be is be. Thus, — 
Be brave. Be sure you are right. 
Be careful. Be here at noon, 
2. The imperative passive is a verb-phrase consisting of be and a 
past participle. 
Be trusted rather than feared. 
Study your failures and be instructed by them. 
268. The subject of an imperative is seldom expressed unless it is 
emphatic. 
The subject, when expressed, may precede the imperative: 
as, — You sit here. 
Nore. In older English, the subject often followed the imperative: as, — 
Go thou, Go you, Hear ye. This use is now confined to the solemn style and 
to poetry. 
269. The emphatic form of the imperative consists of the im- 
perative do, followed by the infinitive without to. 
Do tell me what he said. 
Do stand still. 
The form with do is often used when the subject is expressed : 
as, —Do you remain. 
270. Prohibition (or negative command) is commonly expressed 
by means of the form with do. 
Do not open a closed door without knocking. 
Do not forget to say ** thank you.” 
In poetry and the solemn style prohibition is often expressed 
by the simple imperative with not. 
Tell me not what too well I know. 
Devise not evil against thy neighbor. 
Seek not to learn my name.

271. Commands are sometimes expressed. in the indicative 
by means of shall or will (§§ 239-240). 
Thou shalt not steal. 
You will leave the room immediately. 
For such expressions as ‘‘ Forward!” ‘Off with you!” and the like, 
see § 530. 
For the imperative in conditions, see § 418. 
I. SUBJUNCTIVE MOOD 
Forms oF THE SUBJUNCTIVE 
272. The subjunctive mood is used in certain special constructions 
of wish, condition, and the like. 
In older English the subjunctive forms were common in a 
variety of uses, as they still are in poetry and the solemn 
style. In ordinary prose, however, subjunctive forms are rare, 
and in conversation they are hardly ever heard, except in the ~ 
case of the copula be. 
The subjunctive forms of be are the following : —

SINGULAR PLURAL 
1. If I had been. 1. If we had been. 
2. If thou hadst been. 2. If you had been. 
3. If he had been. 3. If they had been. 
Jf is used in the paradigm because it is in clauses beginning with ¢ that 
the subjunctive is commonest in modern English; but if is of course no part 
of the subjunctive inflection. 
273. In other verbs, the subjunctive active has the same forms 
as the indicative, except in the second and third persons singular 
of the present and the perfect, which are like the first person : — 
PRESENT PreRrecr 
1. If I strike. 1. If I have struck. 
2. If thou strike. 2. If thou have struck. 
3. If he strike. 3. If he have struck. 
In the passive subjunctive, the subjunctive forms of the copula 
(§ 272) are used as auxiliaries :— present, [f I be struck; past, 
If I were struck; perfect, If I have been struck; pluperfect, If 
I had been struck. (See table, p. 304.) 
274. Progressive verb-phrases in the subjunctive may be formed 
by means of the copula: — present, If I be striking; past, If I 
were striking. The present is rare; the past is common. 
Usxs or THE SUBJUNCTIVE 
Subjunctive in Wishes and Exhortations 
275. The subjunctive is often used in wishes or prayers. 
Angels and ministers of grace defend us! 
Heaven help him! 
The saints preserve us! 
God bless you ! 
Long live the king ! 
O that I had listened to him! 
O that we were rid of him!
-P-A-G-E-138
  120 VERBS 
In the first five examples, the wish is expressed in an inde- 
pendent sentence. In the last two, the construction is sub- 
ordinate, — the ¢hat-clause being the object of an unexpressed 
“TI wish” (§ 407). 
276. The subjunctive be is often omitted when it may easily 
be supplied. 
Peace [be] to his ashes! 
Honor [be] to his memory ! 
Honor [be] to whom honor is due! 
277. Wishes are often introduced by may or would. 
May you never want ! 
Would that he were safe! 
Would you were with us! [For Would that.] 
May and would in such expressions were originally subjunctives; would 
stands for I would, that is, I should wish. Want in the first example is an 
infinitive without ¢o (§ 311). For wishes expressed by the infinitive, see § 320. 
278. Exhortations in the first person plural sometimes take 
the subjunctive in elevated or poetical style. 
Hear we the king! 
Join we in a hymn of praise ! 
Exhortation is ordinarily expressed by Jet us followed by 
the infinitive without to. 
Let us join hands. 
Let us have peace. 
Let ’s camp here. 
Let is a verb in the imperative mood, us is its object, and the infinitive 
(join, have, camp) depends on let. 
Subjunctives in Concessions, Conditions, etc. 
279. The subjunctive is used after though, although, to express an 
admission or concession not as a fact but as a supposition. 
Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him. 
Though he were to beg this on his knees, I should still refuse.
-P-A-G-E-139
  SUBJUNCTIVE MOOD 121 
When the concession is stated as an admitted fact, the indica- 
tive is regular. 
Although he is a foreigner, he speaks good English. 
Though he sometimes sings, he is not now in good voice. 
280. After if and unless, expressing condition, the subjunctive 
may be used in a variety of ways. 
1. If this be gold, our fortune is made. [It may or may not be gold.] 
2. If he confess, I shall overlook the offence. [He may or may not 
confess. ] 
3. Unless he confess, he cannot be convicted. [He may or may not 
confess. ] 
4, If this were gold, our fortune would be made. [It is not gold ; hence 
our fortune is not made.] 
5. If he stood before me at this moment, I should tell him my opin- 
ion. [He does not stand before me ; hence I do not tell him.] 
6. If he had confessed, I should have overlooked his fault. [He did 
not confess ; hence I did not overlook it.] 
7. Unless he had confessed, he could not have been convicted. [He 
did confess ; hence he was convicted.] 
In conditional clauses, the present subjunctive denotes either 
present or future time. It puts the supposed case doubtfully, but 
not necessarily as improbable. (See examples 1-3.) 
The past subjunctive refers to present time. It implies that 
the supposed case is not now a fact. (See examples 4 and 5.) 
The pluperfect (or past perfect) subjunctive refers to past time. 
It implies that the supposed case was not a fact. (See 6 and 7.) 
For details of conditional sentences, see pp. 167-172. 
281. Concession or condition may be expressed by the subjunctive 
without though or if, the verb preceding the subject, which is 
sometimes omitted. 
I. Concession 
Try as we may, we cannot swim to that rock, 
Say what he will, he can never convince me. 
Come what will, I’ll stand my ground. 
Be that as it may, my mind is made up.

II. Conprrion 
Were I asked, I could tell all the facts. [If I were asked, etc.] 
Had I known, I would have written to you. [If I had known, ete.] 
I shall be twenty years old, come Tuesday. [If Tuesday come, etc.] 
I will go, rain or shine. [If it rain, or if it shine, etc.] 
Be he prince or be he pauper, every guest is welcome here. 
Nors. The subjunctive in these concessive and conditional uses is really 
the same as that in exhortations (§.278). ‘* 7ry [we] as we may ” means liter- 
ally, ‘‘ Let us try as hard as we can,” and this has the force of ‘t However 
hard we try ” or ‘Although we try ever so hard.” 
282. After as if (as though), the past subjunctive is used. 
He looks as if he were about to speak. [Nor: as if he was about to 
speak.] 
I act as if I were crazy. [Nor: as if I was crazy.] 
283. The subjunctive may express not what is or was, but 
what would be or would have been, the case. 
It were safer to travel by day. [It would be safer, etc.] 
I had been wiser had I forded the river. [I should have been wiser if 
I had.] 
This construction is old-fashioned. Modern English commonly uses should 
(or would) be, should (or would) have been, instead. 
284. The subjunctive is occasionally used after that, lest, be- 
fore, until, etc., in subordinate clauses referring to the future 
and commonly expressing purpose or expectation. 
Take heed that he escape not. [Purpose.] 
Give him food lest he perish. [Purpose.] 
Let us tarry until he come. [Expectation.] 
This construction is confined to poetry and the solemn or 
formal style. In ordinary language the indicative or a verb- 
phrase with may is used. 
Take heed that he does not escape. 
Give him food in order that he may not perish. 
Let us wait till he comes. 
 
-P-A-G-E-141
  
SUBJUNCTIVE MOOD 123 
285. The past subjunctive had is common in had rather and 
similar phrases. 
I had rather wait a day. 
You had better leave the room. 
He had as lief go as stay. 
Nors. Had in this construction is sometimes condemned as erroneous or 
inelegant; but the idiom is well-established. 
Might better, would better, and would rather may be used instead of had 
better, etc.; but would better is improper in the first person. 
286.. The subjunctive forms are often replaced by verb-phrases 
containing the auxiliaries may, might, could, would, should. 
1. In wishes (§ 277). 
May you live long and prosper ! 
May he never repent this act ! 
Ah, could I but live a hundred years ! 
2. In concessions and conditions (§§ 279-280).

POTENTIAL VERB-PHRASES 
USE OF MODAL AUXILIARIES 
287. Several auxiliary verbs are used to form verb-phrases indicating 
ability, possibility, obligation, or necessity.” 
Such verb-phrases are called potential phrases, that is, ‘‘ phrases 
of possibility.” 
The auxiliary verbs used in potential phrases are : — may, can, 
must, might, could, would, and should. They are called modal 
auxiliaries and are followed by the infinitive without ¢o. 
We may ask him a few questions. 
I can manage a motor car. 
You must inquire the way. 
He might give you a chance. 
I could show you his house if you would permit me. 
I should enjoy a sea-voyage. 
Nors. The fact that give, etc., in such phrases as can give, are infinitives 
may be seen by comparing ‘‘I can strike”’ with ‘Iam able to strike,” ‘*I may 
strike” with “I am permitted to strike,” “I must strike’? with ‘*I am obliged 
to strike,” and so on. In earlier periods of the language, when the infinitive had 
a special ending (-an or -en), the nature of the construction was unmistakable. 
288. Potential phrases may be arranged in tables of conjuga- 
tion, like that on pp. 108-110. They are often called, collec- 
tively, the potential mood.

the infinitive: as, —‘‘I had to wait for the train.” 
293. Ought with the present infinitive, expresses a present 
duty or moral obligation ; with the perfect infinitive, a past duty 
or obligation. Should is often used in the same sense. 
I ought to write that letter. [Present.] 
You ought not to object. [Present.] 
This roof ought to be mended. [Present.] 
I ought to have known better. [Past.] 
Your dog ought not to have been unleashed. [Past.]

Norte. Ought is really an old past tense of the verb owe, but is now always 
a present. Its former meaning may be seen in Dame Quickly’s ‘ You ought

tainly be expected in the case supposed.

SPECIAL RULES FOR SHOULD AND WOULD 
296. Should is the past tense of shall, and would is the past 
tense of will. Hence the rules for should and would are similar 
to those for shall and will (§§ 233-239). But there is much 
variation, especially in subordinate clauses. 
I. IN SIMPLE SENTENCES AND INDEPENDENT CLAUSES 
297. Except in certain kinds of subordinate clauses, the 
distinction between should and would is practically the same 
as that between shall and will. 
When the auxiliary verb expresses futurity without any idea 
of wishing, consenting, or the like, the forms are as follows : — 
ASSERTIONS (DECLARATIVE) 
SINGULAR PLURAL 
1. I should fall. 1. We should fall. 
2. Thou wouldst fall. 2. You would fall. 
3. He would fall. 3. They would fall. 
Quzstions (INTERROGATIVE) 
SINGULAR PLURAL 
1. Should I fall? 1. Should we fall? 
2. Shouldst thou fall? 2. Should you fall? 
3. Would he fall? 3. Would they fall?
-P-A-G-E-146
  128 VERBS 
298. Common errors are the use of I would for I should in 
assertions, and that of Would I? and Would you? for Should 
I? and Should you? in questions. 
The correct forms are shown in the following sentences. 
L Lshould (we should) and I would (we would) in assertions : — 
1. I should break my neck if I fell. 
2. I should hesitate to try this experiment. 
3. I should n’t wonder if he escaped. 
4. We should regret any misunderstanding. 
5. I should wish to examine the plans again before deciding. 
6. I should be glad to accept any fair offer. 
7. I would give five dollars for a ticket. 
8. I would help you if I could. 
9. I would never agree to such a proposition. 
10. We would rather die than surrender. 
11. We would pay our bill to-day if we had the money. 
12. I would gladly accept any fair offer. 
In the first six examples, J (or we) should is correct, because 
the auxiliary gives no suggestion of the speaker’s will (or 
volition). In the last six, on the contrary, the speaker’s will- 
ingness or desire is plainly expressed by the auxiliary, and J 
(or we) would is therefore used. 
| Nore. In such sentences as the fifth, — ‘t I should wish to examine the plans 
again before deciding,’ — wish expresses volition. Hence ‘I would wish” is 
incorrect, for it expresses volition twice and can mean only ‘*I desire to wish.” 
On the same principle we say “I should prefer,” ‘tI should be glad,” etc. 
(see § 236). 
Sometimes either I would or I should may be used, but with a difference in 
meaning. Thus, in the eighth example, ‘‘I should help you” might be substi- 
tuted for ‘‘ I would help you.” This change, however, makes the remark sound 
less cordial and sympathetic; for I should (unlike I would) gives no hint of 
the speaker’s desire to be of service. 
II. Should I (or we)? in questions : — 
. Should I break my neck if I fell ? 
. Should I be poisoned if I ate those berries ? 
. Should I take cold without my overcoat ? 
. Should I disturb you if I were to practise my music lesson ? 
. Should we run aground if we missed the channel ? oR wD

SHOULD AND WOULD 129 
Notsz. Would I? is confined, for the most part, to questions in which one 
repeats the words or thought of another. Thus, —‘* You would give five dollars 
fora ticket.” ‘* Would I? No,I would n’t!” In this use it is chiefly colloquial. 
III. Should you? and Would you? in questions : — 
1. Should you drown if the boat were to capsize? [Yes, I should 
drown, for I do not know how to swim.] 
2. Should you despair if this plan were a failure ? [No, I should not, 
for I have other resources. ] 
3. Should you think that ten yards of velvet would be enough? [Yes, 
I should think so.] 
4. Should you be offended if I were to speak frankly ? [No, I should 
not be offended.] 
5. Should you wish to examine the plans again before deciding ? 
[Yes, I should (see note under I, above).] 
6. Would you wear a hat ora cap? [I would wear a cap if I were you.] 
7. Would you study Greek if you were in my place? [Yes, I would.] 
8. Would you accept my apology if it were offered? [Certainiy, I 
would accept it gladly.] 
9. Would you be so kind as to lend me your compasses? [Certainly 
I would lend them, if I had not lost them.] 
10. Would you allow me to use your name as a reference? [I would.] 
The choice between should and would in these sentences 
corresponds to the form expected in the answer (§ 238). 
299. The chief occasions on which Would you? is’ correct 
are:— (1) in asking advice in a matter of doubt, and (2) in 
asking consent or permission. 
In examples 6 and 7 in § 298, III, the speaker asks advice; in 8, 9, 
and 10, he asks consent or permission. 
300. Note that the proper forms are J should like, Should I 
like? and Should you like? 
I should like to read that book. 
Should I like to go to Rome? Indeed, I should. 
Should you like to receive a copy of our catalogue? [I should like to 
receive one. ] 
‘Nor. Would is very common in these phrases, even among writers of 
repute, but it is still contrary to the best usage. The reason for should is the 
same as in J should*wish (§ 298, I, note).

301. I’d and we’d are contractions of I would and we 
would. Hence they can never stand for I should and we 
should (§ 235). 
302. Should in the second and third persons may be used in 
simple declarative sentences and independent clauses to ex- 
press the will of the speaker (§ 239). 
If I had my way, you should be prosecuted. [That is: I would take 
care that you were prosecuted.] 
If I had the money, you should be paid immediately. [Compare: You 
shall be paid.] 
If I were you, she should not regret her generosity. [Compare: She 
shall not regret it.] 
Il. SHOULD AND WOULD IN SUBORDINATE CLAUSES 
303. In some kinds of subordinate clauses, the use of should 
and would differs considerably from that in simple sentences 
and principal clauses. 
The following classes require attention : — (1) clauses of pur- 
pose or expectation (§ 304), (2) conditional and concessive 
clauses (§ 305), (3) clauses expressing volition not that of 
the subject (§ 306), (4) clauses stating something as an idea 
(§ 307), (5) indirect discourse (§ 308). 
304. In subordinate clauses expressing the purpose or expec- 
tation with which anything is done, shall and should are used 
in all three persons.

supposed case doubtfully, shal/ and should are used in all three 
persons; but will and would are proper when the subject is 
thought of as wishing or consenting.

persons in subordinate clauses to express volition which is not 
that of the subject.

fact but as an idea to be considered, should is the proper 
auxiliary in all three persons.

[That is: '‘ When I consider the matter, I do not find the idea surprising.”’ 
In “I am not surprised that you find,” etc., the subordinate clause makes 
the statement as a fact.]

trast: That Napoleon chafed.], 
308. For shall and will, should and would, in indirect dis- 
course, see §§ 438-439. 
THE INFINITIVE 
309. The infinitive is a verb-form that has some of the proper- 
ties of a noun (§ 28). Its two-sided character comes out clearly 
when it is used as the subject of a sentence. 
1. To hope is our only resource. 
2. To flatter is not my custom. 
3. To sleep was an impossibility. 
4. To surrender seemed disgraceful. 
5. To choose wisely was my greatest difficulty. 
6. To scale the wall was the work of a moment. 
Each of these infinitives (to hope, to flatter, etc.) is a noun, 
for each is the simple subject of a sentence. Besides, an ordi- 
nary noun may be substituted for each infinitive with no change 
 
-P-A-G-E-151
INFINITIVES 133 
in meaning; as, — ‘Hope is our only resource”; “ Flattery is 
not my custom”; “Sleep was an impossibility.” 
But each of these infinitives is also a verb, —for (1) it ex- 
presses action; (2) it may be modified by an adverb, as in 
No. 5; (8) it takes an object if it is transitive, as in No. 6. 
An infinitive (as the examples show) has regularly no sub- 
ject and therefore lacks both number and person. Hence it is not 
bound by the general rule for the agreement of a verb with 
its subject (§ 222). From this fact it derives its name, infinitive, 
_ which means “ unrestricted” or “ free from limitations.” * 
810. The infinitive is a verb-form which partakes of the nature of a 
noun. It expresses action or state in the simplest possible way, without 
person or number. 
It is commonly preceded by the preposition to, which is called the 
sign of the infinitive. 
To is not, in strictness, a part of the infinitive, but it may 
be so regarded for convenience, since the infinitive, in most of 
its uses, is preceded by to. 
Notr. To sometimes stands for an infinitive in careless speech: as, — 
“You may go if you wish to” (that is, “if you wish to go”). Such expres- 
sions are to be avoided. It is better to say, ‘You may go if you wish.” 
311. The infinitive often lacks to, especially in verb-phrases 
with the auxiliaries will, shall, may, can, must, might, could, 
would, should, do, did. For examples, see pp. 102, 114, 124. 
312. The infinitive has two tenses, —the present and the 
perfect. 
1. The present infinitive is the verb in its simplest form, usu- 
ally preceded by to. as,— ‘to live, to teach, to bind, to strike. 
2. The perfect infinitive is made by prefixing the infinitive of 
the auxiliary verb have to the past participle (§ 243): as, — 
to have lived, to have taught, to have bound, to have struck. 
1¥or the so-called infinitive clause, in which the infinitive has a subject of 
a peculiar kind, see §§ 324-328.

phrase, or an adverbial clause.

They allowed him to go in peace. [Adverbial phrase.] 
To dive among those weeds would be folly.

I expect always to be poor. [Nor: to always be poor.] 
Nore. Careless writers pay slight attention to this rule, and some good 
writers and speakers defy it, hoping to break it down. But it is unquestion- 
ably still in accord with the best usage. 
314. The infinitive may take an object if its meaning allows. 
I long to visit Italy. 
My mother feared to enter the house. 
To launch a boat was impossible. 
To grant your request is a pleasure: 
To give him money is useless. [Money is the direct object of to give, 
and him the indirect object.] 
315. The infinitive is used in a variety of constructions, — 
(1) as a noun, (2) as an adjective modifier or adverbial modifier, 
(3) in the so-called infinitive clause. 
I. THE INFINITIVE AS NOUN 
316. The infinitive is used in various noun constructions, —as 
subject, as predicate nominative, as nominative of exclamation, 
as appositive, as object of certain prepositions, as modifier. 
317. An infinitive with or without a complement or modifiers, may 
be used as the subject of a sentence, as a predicate nominative, or as 
an appositive.

My wish is to see you immediately. 
To decide was to act. [The first infinitive is the subject, and the second

Both alternatives, to advance and to retreat, seemed equally hazardous. 
[Apposition with the subject.]

He has but one aim in life, to succeed. [Apposition with the object.] 
I have written with a definite purpose, to dissuade you. 
I give you three choices, —to buy, to lease, or to build. 
318. An infinitive in the predicate is often in apposition 
with the expletive subject iz. 
It was a pleasure to see him. [Instead of: To see him was a pleasure.] 
It is easy to understand you. 
It will be impossible to forget. 
It proved very difficult to find evidence against him. 
In this use the infinitive, though grammatically in apposition with it, is 
really the subject ofj the thought (see § 120, 2). 
319. The infinitive may be used as the object of the prep- 
ositions but, except, about. 
There was nothing to do but walk (or to walk). 
He will do anything except resign (or except to resign). 
We are about to object. [An idiom expressing futurity.] 
The train is about to start. 
Nore. Can but and cannot but are distinct idioms. (1) In “I can but thank 
you,” but is an adverb (= only). The sentence means: ‘I can only thank 
you—simply that and nothing more!” (2) In “I cannot but thank you,” 
but is a preposition (= except). The idiom is shortened from ‘tI cannot 
choose but thank you,’’— that is, ‘‘I have no choice except to do so,” or, in 
other words, ‘‘I cannot help it.” 
The infinitive after for (now a gross error) was once in good use: as, — "7 
What sweeter music can we bring 
Than a carol for to sing. —HERRICK.

(§ 88, 4). ¥ To sleep! perchance to dream! 
To suffer and be silent ! 
O to be a boy again! [A wish.] 
O to have lived in the brave days of old! 
Il. THE INFINITIVE AS A MODIFIER 
321. An infinitive may be used as an adjective modifier of a noun or 
as an adverbial modifier of an adjective. 
In this use the infinitive is said to depend on the word which it 
modifies. 
Wirn Nouxs Wir ApgEctives 
(Avgective Mop1riEr) (ApvEeRBIAL MopiriEr) 
An opportunity to advance came. The men are ready to advance. 
Determination to win brings success. John is eager to win. 
Willingness to oblige makes friends. I shall be glad to oblige you. 
I wish I had the ability to swim. We are all able to swim. 
Hisanxiety to please us was laughable. He is anxious to please everybody. 
Nors. This use is due to the fact that the infinitive with to is really a 
prepositional phrase (§ 42). Thus, ‘‘determination to win” is equivalent to 
“determination for victory,” and ‘eager to win” to ‘‘eager for victory.” 
The adjective force of the infinitive comes out clearly in ‘‘nothing to eat,” 
where to eat is practically synonymous with eatable. 
In its adjective use, the present infinitive sometimes shows no distinction 
in voice, so that the active and the passive are interchangeable: as,—‘ta 
house to let” or “to be let” ; ‘tan axe to grind” or “to be ground.” In such 
expressions the active form is usually preferable. 
322. The infinitive without to may be used as an adjective 
modifier after the direct object of see, hear, feel, and some 
other verbs of like meaning. 
I saw the policeman arrest him. 
Hear the sea roar! 
Can you feel the ground tremble ? 
Ruth watched the tide come in. 
In this use the infinitive is practically equivalent to a participle. Compare 
“T heard him shout” with ‘I heard him shouting.” Hence the substantive 
may be regarded as an object, and the infinitive as its modifier. But the 
construction closely approaches that of an infinitive clause (§§ 324-325).

or (2) by expressing the purpose of the action.

The rain continued to fall heavily. 
Every boy desires to succeed. 
The officer neglected to watch his men. 
The prisoners attempted to escape. 
You promised to come to-night. 
After dare, the complementary infinitive may or may not have to. Thus, — 
**T dare not do it”; ‘‘ Who will dare to speak?” 
II. Inrinitive or Purpose 
He went to New York to study medicine. 
He opened his lips to speak. 
She closed her eyes to shut out the sight. 
Elsa lifted the cover to see what was inside. 
The conductor signalled to stop the train. 
Harold waited to assist his teacher. 
Both the complementary infinitive and the infinitive of purpose 
may be regarded as adverbial phrases modifying the verb. 
Nore. After some verbs the infinitive approaches the construction of a 
pure noun and is often regarded as an object. Thus, —‘‘I desire to see you” 
(compare ‘‘I desire a sight of you”). It is simpler, however, to regard all 
such infinitives as complementary and to treat them as adverbial modifiers. 
For it is impossible to distinguish the construction of the infinitive after cer- 
tain adjectives (as in “Iam eager ¢o see you”) from its construction after 
such verbs as wish and desire. 
I. THE INFINITIVE CLAUSE 
324. A peculiar infinitive construction often replaces a that- 
clause as the object of a verb. Thus, — 
Vein {ome he should go. 
him to go. 
In the first sentence, the noun clause that he should go is the 
object of wished ; in the second, this clause is replaced by him to 
   
-P-A-G-E-156
  
138 VERBS 
go, but without any change in meaning. This expression con- 
sists of two parts: — (1) him, a pronoun in the objective case, 
which replaces the subject he; and (2) an infinitive zo go, 
which replaces the predicate should go. Thus it is plain that 
him to go is also a noun clause, of which him is the subject, 
and to go the predicate. Such an expression is called an 
infinitive clause. 
325. A kind of clause, consisting of a substantive in the objective 
case followed by an infinitive, may be used as the object of certain 
verbs. 
Such clauses are called infinitive clauses, and the substantive is said 
to be the subject of the infinitive. 
The subject of an infinitive is in the objective case. 
Infinitive clauses are used (1) after verbs of wishing, command- 
ing, advising, and the like, and (2) after some verbs of believ- 
ing, declaring, and perceiving. Thus, — 
The colonel commanded them to charge [= that they should charge]. 
I believe him to be trustworthy [= that he is trustworthy]. 
The judge declared him to be a dangerous man [= that he was, etc.]. 
After a few verbs the infinitive without ¢o is used in infini- 
tive clauses. 
Mr. Esmond bade his servant pack a portmanteau and get horses, 
[Compare : ordered his servant to pack, etc.] 
What makes him cry? [Compare: What causes him to cry ?] 
I let him sleep. [Compare : I allowed him to sleep.] 
Nore. Ordinarily the infinitive cannot assert and hence has no subject 
(§ 309). The infinitive clause is, therefore, a peculiar exception, for him to go 
makes an assertion as clearly as that he should go does. That him is really 
the subject of to go and not the object of wished is manifest, for I wished 
him makes no sense. The object of wished is the whole clause (him to go). 
Originally, to be sure, the noun or pronoun in the objective was felt to be 
the object of the main verb, and this relation may still be felt in ‘\I ordered 
him to go”; but even here the real object of ordered is the clause (as may be 
seen in ‘I ordered the castle to be blown up”). The substantive has come to 
be the real subject of the infinitive, and should be so treated in parsing. 
1 After verbs of wishing, etc., they express purpose (§ 403) ; after verbs of 
believing, etc., they are in indirect discourse (§ 431).  
-P-A-G-E-157
  
THE INFINITIVE CLAUSE 139 
326. A predicate pronoun after ¢o de in an infinitive clause is 
in the objective case, agreeing with the subject of the infinitive. 
Care should be taken not to confuse this construction with 
the predicate nominative (§ 88, 2). 
PREDICATE PRONOUN AFTER 70 BE PREDICATE NOMINATIVE 
I believed it to be her. I believed that it was she. 
We know the author to be him. We know that the author is he. 
f The author is known to be he.

Richard was thought to be I. 
We suspected the intruders to be We suspected that the intruders 
them. were they. 
Note the case of the relatives and of the predicate pronouns in 
the following sentences : — 
A boy whom I thought to be honest deceived me. [Whom is the subject 
of the infinitive to be and is therefore in the objective case.] 
A boy who, I thought, was honest deceived me. [Who is the subject 
of was and is therefore nominative. I thought is parenthetical (§ 502).] 
A boy whom I believe to be him just passed me. 
A boy who, I believe, was he, just passed me. 
327. An infinitive clause may be the object of the preposition 
for. Thus, — 
I wrote for him to come. [The clause him to come is the object of for; 
him is the subject of to come.] 
They are waiting on the shore 
For the bark to take them home. — Noxu. 
I long for him to come back. 
328. An infinitive clause with for may be used as a subject, 
as a predicate nominative, or as the object of a preposition. 
For us to delay would be fatal to your enterprise. [Compare: Our 
delay would be fatal.] 
Our best plan is for the boat to shoot the rapids. [Predicate nominative 
agreeing with the subject plan.]

PARTICIPLES 
329. Certain words unite in themselves some of the prop- 
erties of adjectives with some of the properties of verbs. Such 
words are called participles (§ 31). Thus, — 
Shattered and sinking, but gallantly returning the enemy’s fire, the 
frigate drifted out to sea. 
Shattered, sinking, and returning’are verb-forms which are in 
some respects similar to infinitives : for (1) they express action ; 
(2) they have no subject to agree with, and hence have neither 
person nor number; and (3) one of them takes a direct object. 
They differ from infinitives, however, in that they resemble, 
not nouns, but adjectives, for they describe the substantive 
Srigate to which they belong. 
Such verb-forms are called participles, because they share (or 
participate in) the nature of adjectives. 
330. The participle is a verb-form which has no subject, but which 
partakes of the nature of an adjective and expresses action or state in 
such a way as to describe or limit a substantive.

Clinging to the horns of the altar, voiceless she stood. — Dz Quincey.

331. Verbs have three participles, — the present, the past, 
ard the perfect. 
332. The present participle ends in -ing. It usually describes 
an action as taking place at the same time with some other 
action. 
Tom came sauntering up the path. 
The beggar shambled down the steps, grumbling. 
Reaching for the flower, I lost my balance.

PARTICIPLES 141 
333. The present participle often refers to time preceding 
that denoted by the predicate verb. 
Rising from his chair, he bowed. [That is, when he had risen.] 
Cearning that your brother was in trouble, I hastened to his aid. 
834. The past participle is always associated with the idea of past 
time or completed action. 
1. The past participle of a weak verb has the same form as the past 
tense.1 
Present TENSE Past TENSE Past ParvIiciPLE 
I mend chairs. I mended the chairs. The chairs are mended. 
I sweep the rooms. I swept the rooms. The rooms are swept. 
Z seek treasure. I sought treasure. Treasure is sought. 
I lose money. I lost money. The money is lost. 
2. The past participle of strong verbs shows a change from the vowel 
of the present tense. 
All strong verbs had originally the ending en (n) in the past parti- 
ciple, but this ending has been lost in many verbs. 
Present TENSE Past TENsE Pasr ParriciPLe 
He speaks. He spoke. (He has) spoken. 
He draws. He drew. (He has) drawn. 
He sings. He sang. (He has) sung. 
He wins. He won. (He has) won. 
The forms show great variety and must be learned by 
practice. (See pp. 291-297 for a list.) 
_--335. The perfect participle is made by prefixing having to the 
past participle. 
Having mended the watch, I sent it to the owner. 
Having lost his money, James was forced to walk home. 
336. The present participle is used in forming the progres- 
sive verb-phrases (§$§ 255-259). 
The: past participle is used in forming the complete tenses 
(§§ 242-244) and the passive voice (§ 247). 
1 The only exceptions are trifling differences in spelling.

  142 VERBS 
CONSTRUCTIONS OF PARTICIPLES 
337. Since the participle has adjective properties, its con- 
structions are in the main like those of adjectives. 
338. A participle is said to belong to the substantive which it 
describes or limits. 
Rupert, missing his companion, stepped to the door. [The present 
participle missing belongs to the subject Rupert.] 
Rising, she opened the window. [Rising belongs to she.] 
I heard the rain falling. [Falling belongs to the object rain.] 
Tom’s arm, broken by the blow, hung useless. [The past participle 
broken belongs to the subject arm.] 
Having climbed the hill with great difficulty, I stopped to rest. [The 
perfect participle having climbed belongs to the subject I.] 
339. A participle should not be used without some substantive to 
which it may belong. 
Ricut: Entering the room, we saw a strange sight. [The participle 
entering belongs to the pronoun we.] 
Wrone: Entering the room, a strange sight was seen. [Since there is 
no substantive to which entering can belong, it has no construction.] 
Apparent exceptions are concerning, considering, pending, 
generally speaking, etc. The first three may be classed as prepo- 
sitions (§ 355), the last as an independent participle. 
We fought every day, and, generally speaking, twice every day. —Dr 
QuINcEyY. 
Nore. The rule in § 339 does not apply to such phrases as on entering, 
after investigating, ete., in which the words in -ing are not participles, but 
verbal nouns (§ 348). Thus the following sentences are grammatical: —‘* On 
entering the room, a strange sight appeared”; ‘After investigating the sub- 
ject, the plan was adopted.” Such expressions, however, should be used with 
caution, since they are sometimes awkward or ambiguous. 
340. A participle may be modified by an adverb, an adverbial 
phrase, or an adverbial clause. 
Smiling brigntly, she extended her hand. [Adverb.] 
He leaped forward, shrieking with all his might. [Adverbial phrase.] 
Laughing until he cried, he sank into a chair. [Adverbial clause.]  
-P-A-G-E-161
  PARTICIPLES 148 
$41. A participle may take an object if its meaning allows. 
I found the old man mending his net. 
Lifting the box, he moved toward the door. 
Giving me a friendly nod, he passed on. [Here nod is the direct object 
of giving, and me is the indirect object.] 
The participle, with its modifiers and such other words as are attached to 
it, is sometimes called a participial phrase. 
342. A participle may be used as a pure adjective. 
A grinning boy confronted me. 
A battered hat hung on the peg. 
Kate was playing with a broken doll. 
We could hear a rushing stream. 
Willing hands make light work. 
He was struck by a spent ball. 
343. The past participle is often used as a predicate adjective 
expressing state or condition. 
This construction is easily confused with the passive of verbs. 
The distinction may be seen in the following examples : — 
The rain began to fall heavily, and every time a gust of wind struck 
us we were drenched by it. 
When the rain at last ceased, we were drenched [that is, very wet]. 
In the first sentence, were drenched is the past passive of 
the verb drench (compare the active “every time a gust of 
wind struck us, it drenched us”). In the second, the participle 
drenched expresses mere condition, and is therefore a predi- 
cate adjective. The distiiction, however, is not always sharp, 
and in cases of doubt the phrase may be taken together as a 
passive verb. 
Nore. The real test is the following. Whenever a person or thing is dis- 
tinctly present to the mind as the doer of the action, we have a passive verb- 
phrase. Whenever, on the other hand, the participle merely describes condition 
with no thought of its being the result of an antecedent act, the construction 
is that of a predicate adjective (§ 172, 3). 
 
-P-A-G-E-162
  144 VERBS 
NomInaTIVE ABSOLUTE 
344. A substantive, with the participle belonging to it, is 
often used to make a peculiar form of adverbial modifying 
phrase: as, — 
The wind failing, we lowered the sail. 
Here the wind failing is equivalent to an adverbial phrase (on 
the failure of the wind) or an adverbial clause (when the wind 
failed). Tt defines the time of the action. 
The wind failing, 
On the failure of the win} lowered the sail. 
When the wind failed, 
345. A substantive, with a participle, may express the cause, time, 
or circumstances of an action. 
This is called the absolute construction. 
The substantive is in the nominative case and is called a nominative 
absolute. 
My knife slipping, I cut myself severely. [The phrase my knife slip- 
ping is equivalent to because my knife slipped: it expresses cause.] 
Two days having elapsed, we again set forward. [The phrase in italics 
is equivalent to when two days had elapsed: it expresses time. ] 
Evenings he read aloud, his wife sewing by his side. [The phrase ex- 
presses one of the circumstances that attended the reading.] 
This done, proceed to business. [The phrase this done is equivalent to 
the clause since (or when) this is done, and indicates cause or time.] 
Nors. This construction is called absolute (that is, ‘‘ free ”’ or ‘loosened ”) 
because the substantive is not in any one of the constructions (subject, object, 
apposition, ete.) which ordinarily attach nouns grammatically to other words 
in the sentence. Nevertheless, the whole phrase, though standing apart from 
the rest of the sentence, is in meaning an adverbial modifier of some verb. 
346. The participle being is sometimes omitted in the ab- 
solute construction. 
Allen once mayor, my chance of advancement would be ruined. [That 
is: Allen once being mayor.] 
Peter stood before me, his hands in his pockets. 
His clothing in shreds, he presented a sorry sight.

PARTICIPIAL NOUNS 145 
VERBAL NOUNS IN -ING (PARTICIPIAL NOUNS) 
347. English has a large and important class of verbal nouns 
that end in -ing, and that serve as the names of actions. 
These are identical in form with present participles, for which 
they are frequently mistaken. The distinction, however, is clear, 
for the present participle is never used as the name of an ac- 
tion. Hence no such word in -ing that is a subject or an object, 
or stands in any other noun construction, can be a participle. 
While I was travelling in Mexico, I met with an accident. [Participle.] 
Travelling broadens the mind. [Verbal noun, used as subject.] 
He enjoys travelling. [Verbal noun, used as object of a verb.] 
He spends his time in travelling. [Verbal noun, object of a preposition.] 
Tom’s favorite exercise is swimming. [Verbal noun, predicate nom- 
inative.] 
This sport, fishing, has been called the contemplative man’s recreation. 
[Verbal noun, in apposition with sport.] . 
That nouns in -ing are real nouns may be proved by putting 
ordinary nouns in their place. 
Travelling broadens the mind. Travel broadens the mind. 
Talking is useless. Talk is useless. 
He is afraid of falling. He is afraid of a fall. 
348. From nearly every English verb there may be formed a verbal 
noun in -ing. 
Verbal nouns in -ing have the form of present participles, but the 
construction of nouns. 
They are often called participial nouns. 
Such nouns are freely used, either by themselves or in a 
series along with ordinary nouns. 
Mining is a dangerous occupation. 
Painting and sculpture are sister arts. 
The Indians of Massachusetts spent their time in hunting, fishing, 
agriculture, and warfare. 
Reading, writing, and arithmetic are jocosely called ‘tthe three r’s.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-164

  146 PARTICIPIAL NOUNS 
349. Verbal nouns in -ing have certain properties of the 
verb. 
1. Verbal nouns in -ing may take a direct or an indirect object if their 
meaning allows. 
Digging gold seems to the uninitiated like finding buried treasure. 
Lending him money is useless ; it merely fosters his unthrifty habits. 
[Here the noun lending, which is the simple subject of the sentence, 
takes both a direct object (money) and an indirect object (him), precisely 
as the verb lend might do.] 
2. A verbal noun in -ing may take an adverbial modifier. 
Speaking extemporaneously is good practice. [Here the verbal noun 
speaking is the simple subject ; but it is modified by the adverb extempo- 
raneously, precisely as if it were a verb.] 
But verbal nouns in -ing, like other nouns, may be modified 
by adjectives. ~ 
Extemporaneous speaking is good practice. 
8. To the verbal nouns being and having, past participles may be 
attached, so as to give the effect of voice and tense. 
After being instructed in my duties, I was ordered to wait on the king. 
There were grave doubts expressed as to his having seen the mastodon. 
After having been treated in so harsh a fashion, I had no wish to repeat 
the interview. 
Such expressions are verbal noun-phrases. 
350. Verbal nouns in -ing are similar in some of their con- 
structions to infinitives used as nouns (p. 135). 
InFrinitIve As Noun ‘VERBAL Nown In -ing 
To swim was difficult. Swimming was difficult. 
My business is to make shoes. My business is making shoes. 
To see is to believe. Seeing is believing. 
Nouns in -ing are sometimes called infinitives or gerunds. 
351. A noun in -ing may be used as an adjective, or as the 
adjective element in a compound noun (§ 64). 
The sleeping car was completely wrecked. 
William has plenty of spending money.
-P-A-G-E-165
  PARTICIPIAL NOUNS 147 
Nors. Other examples are: —a working day, an ironing board, drinking 
water, smelling salts, marching orders, a walking tour, a swimming race, a 
vaulting pole. In such cases it makes little difference whether the two nouns 
are taken together as a compound, or whether the tirst is regarded as an 
adjective modifying the second. The difference between this use and that of 
the participle is perfectly clear. A “sleeping dog” is a dog that sleeps; a 
‘* sleeping car” is a car for sleeping. Sometimes, indeed, either explanation 
is possible. Thus, a ‘hoisting engine”? may be understood either as an ‘‘en- 
gine that hoists,” or as an “ engine for hoisting.’? But it is better to class these 
exceptions with the nouns in -ing. 
352. When a verbal noun in -ing is preceded by an article or any 
other adjective, it cannot take an object. 
Shooting song-birds 
The shooting of song-birds 
Launching a ship 
The launching of a ship 
Drawing maps 
The drawing of maps 
Eating confectionery constantly 
Constant eating of confectionery 
driving wells. 
the driving of wells. his forbidden. 
requires care and skill. 
lis a useful exercise. 
is bad for the teeth, 
My business is 
Observe that, in each instance, the object (song-birds, ship, 
maps, confectionery, wells) is replaced by a prepositional phrase 
when an article or other adjective precedes the verbal noun. 
Nors. In such expressions as ‘*I went a-fishing,”’ a is a shortened form of 
the preposition on, and fishing is a verbal noun used as its object. When a is 
omitted we have ‘‘I went fishing,’’ ‘‘The house is building,’’ and the like, 
in which the word in -ing seems to be a participle, but is really the object of 
the omitted a (= on). 
353. The possessive case of a noun or pronoun may be used 
to limit a verbal noun in -ing. 
I was sure of its being he. [Nor: it.] 
I heard of Allen’s being elected. [Nor: Allen.] 
 
-P-A-G-E-166
148 PREPOSITIONS 
CHAPTER VII 
PREPOSITIONS 
354. A preposition is a word placed before a substantive to show its 
relation to some other word in the sentence. 
The substantive which follows a preposition is called its object and 
is in the objective case. 
A phrase consisting of a preposition and its object, with or without 
other words, is called a prepositional phrase. 
On the floor lay a heap of nuts. 
He stood behind the tree for some time. 
From morning till night he remained at his post. 
The fire destroyed everything except a few articles of furniture. 
A prepositional phrase may be either adjective or adverbial. 
Thus, in the first example, of nuts is an adjective phrase modifying the 
noun heap, and on the floor is an adverbial phrase modifying the verb 
lay. In the second sentence, the verb stood is modified by two adverbial 
phrases, behind the tree and for some time. 
355. The following list includes most of the prepositions : 
aboard because of considering 
about before despite 
above behind down 
according to below during 
across beneath ere 
after beside, besides except, excepting 
against between for 
along betwixt for the sake of 
along with beyond. from 
amid, amidst but (= except) from among 
among, amongst by ; from between 
apart from by dint of from under 
around by means of in 
as for, as to by reason of in accordance with

into round about without 
notwithstanding save, saving with reference to 
of since with regard to 
off through with respect to 
Norr. Such expressions as by means of, in accordance with, in spite of, 
etc., are really phrases, but may be regarded as compound prepositions. 
Several participles like concerning, considering, pending, are common in a 
prepositional use and are therefore included in the list (§ 339). 
For a (a form of on) in abed, asleep, afire, a-fishing, ete., see § 352. 
Per is confined to the strictly commercial style except in such expressions 
as perforce, per cent, per annum (§ 179). 
356. A preposition may stand at the end of a sentence or 
clause. 
Whom did you ask for? [Compare: For whom did you ask ?] 
  The box which it came in has been destroyed. [Compare: The box in 
which it came.] 
Nore. This order, though informal, is common in the best authors; but, 
if carelessly used, it may result in awkwardness of style. Sometimes a rela- 
tive which is the object of the preposition is omitted (see § 151). Thus, in the 
second sentence, which might be dropped, and the object of in would then be 
“which, understood.” For ‘tHe was laughed at,” and the like, see § 251. 
In poetry a preposition sometimes follows its object directly: as, —‘‘ Bare- 
foot plod I the cold ground upon” (SHAKSPERE). 
357. Certain adverbial expressions like “on Sunday,” “on 
March first,” occur both with and without the preposition. 
He came Sunday (or, on Sunday). 
We sail March first (or, on March first). 
Nore. The forms without on are good colloquial English, but are avoided 
in the more formal style. No preposition need be supplied in parsing. The 
noun is an adverbial objective (§ 109).
-P-A-G-E-168
  
150 PREPOSITIONS 
358. Care is required in the use of pronouns as the objects of 
prepositions.

Tom’s carelessness makes trouble

359. Several words are used either as adverbs or prepositions. 
As ADVERB As PREPOSITION 
I fell down. I fell down the steps. 
Stand by! He stood by the window. 
A big dog ran behind. A dog ran behind the carriage. 
Keep off! Keep off the grass. 
Other examples are :— aboard, above, after, along, before, below, be- 
neath, beside, between, beyond, ere, in, inside, on, outside, past, round, 
since, under, up, within, without. 
For words used either as prepositions or as conjunctions, see pp. 152-154. 
360. Prepositions show various distinctions in use and 
meaning which must be learned by practice and by the study 
of synonyms in a large dictionary. 
The following groups afford opportunity for such study : —at, in; in, 
into; between, among, amid; on, upon; from, off; round, around, 
about; to, with; beside, besides; agree with, agree to; change for, 
change with; disappoint in, of ; differ with, from; confide in, to; cor- 
respond with, to; part from, with; compare to, with; join with, to; 
connect with, to; come up with, to; talk to, with; speak to, with; 
hang on, from, to; live at, in, on; argue with, against ; contend with, 
against ; depart from, for, at, on, in.

  CONJUNCTIONS 151 
CHAPTER VIII 
CONJUNCTIONS 
861. Conjunctions connect words or groups of words. 
Conjunctions are either codrdinate or subordinate.1 
1. A coérdinate conjunction connects words or groups of words that 
are independent of each other. : 
. Hay and grain are sold here. 
Will you take tea or coffee ? 
He was pale but undaunted. 
The messenger replied courteously but firmly. 
. The troops embarked rapidly but without confusion. 
. Noon came, and the task was still unfinished. 
. We must hide here until night falls and the street is deserted. APD 
TP 
ow 
IwE 
In each of the first four sentences, the conjunction (and, or, 
but) connects single words that are in the same construction 
(subjects, objects, predicate adjectives, adverbs). In the fifth, 
but connects an adverb with an adverbial phrase (both being 
modifiers of the verb embarked). In the sixth, and joins the 
two codrdinate clauses of a compound sentence (§ 44). In the 
seventh, and joins two coérdinate clauses which, taken to- 
gether, make up the subordinate clause wntil . . . deserted ; this 
clause may therefore be called a compound subordinate clause 
(see § 454). 
2. A subordinate conjunction connects a subordinate clause with the 
clause on which it depends. 
Harmon did not quail, though he saw the danger. 
Take this seat, if you prefer. 
I hesitated because I remembered your warning. 
Unless you reform, your career will be ruined. 
1Coérdinate conjunctions are also called coérdinating, and subordinate 
conjunctions are also called subordinating.
-P-A-G-E-170
  152 CONJUNCTIONS 
362. The chief coérdinate conjunctions are : — 
and (both .. . and) moreover 
not only ... . but also therefore 
or (either . . . or) then 
nor (neither . . . nor) yet 
but still 
for nevertheless 
however notwithstanding 
Several of these are much used for transition, whether from 
sentence to sentence or from one paragraph to another. 
Such are :—however, moreover, therefore, then, nevertheless, not- 
withstanding, yet, still. 
363. Then is an adverb when it denotes time, a conjunction 
when it denotes consequence or the like. 
Then the boat glided up to the pier. [Time.] 
Men are imperfect creatures: we must not, then, expect them to be 
angels. [Consequence.] 
364. Yet and still are adverbs when they expres. time or 
degree, conjunctions when they connect. 
We have not started yet. [Time.] 
It is still raining. [Time.] 
This hatchet is dull, but that is duller still. [Degree.] 
I miss him, yet I am glad he went. [Conjunction.] 
I like dogs ; still I do not care to own one. [Conjunction.] 
365. For and notwithstanding may be either prepositions or 
conjunctions. 
PREPOSITIONS Consuncrions 
I am waiting for you. We must go, for it is late. 
Jane is coming, notwithstanding Itisa hard storm. She will come, 
the storm. notwithstanding. 
Nors. For is sometimes classified as a subordinate conjunction, but the 
fact that it may be used to begin an independent sentence (even when such a 
sentence opens a paragraph) justifies its inclusion among the codrdinates. 
 
-P-A-G-E-171
  
CONJUNCTIONS 153 
366. The chief subordinate conjunctions are : — 
although, though if that 
as lest unless 
as if (as though) since (= because) whereas 
because than whether (whether . . . or) 
A few phrases may be regarded as compound conjunctions. Such are: — 
in order that, so that, provided that, in case that, but that, as if, as though, 
even if. Provided, and in case (without that) may also be used as conjunc- 
tions: as, —‘'I will go provided it doesn’t rain.” 
367. The subordinate conjunction that is often omitted when 
it may readily be supplied. 
He said [that] he was starving. 
They feared [that] they were betrayed. 
I cannot believe [that] you would try to injure me. 
Nore. This omission is similar to that of the relative pronoun (§ 151). It 
is extremely common, not only in colloquial language but also in literature, 
whether prose or verse. 
368. As and since in the sense of “ because,” and while in the 
sense of “though,” are conjunctions. 
When denoting time, as is an adverb, while is a noun or an 
adverb, and since is an adverb or a preposition. 
As (or since) you will not listen, I will say no more. [Conjunction.] 
As we crossed the bridge, I looked down at the rushing stream. 
[Adverb.] 
Ten years have passed since my uncle went to sea. [Adverb.] 
The house has been empty since Christmas. [Preposition.] 
369. Conjunctions used in pairs are called correlative con- 
junctions. 
The chief correlatives are : — 
both... and though. . . yet (still) 
not only . . . but also although . . . yet (still) 
either. . . or since. . . therefore 
neither. . . nor if. .. then 
 
-P-A-G-E-172
  154 CONJUNCTIONS 
Examples of correlatives may-be seen in the following 
sentences : — 
Both lions and wolves are carnivorous. 
The culprit looked both angry and ashamed. 
William II is not only German Emperor but also King of Prussia. 
Either brass or copper will do. 
Neither Keats nor Shelley lived to be old. 
He asked me whether I was an Austrian or a Russian. 
Though the roads were very bad, yet he managed to reach Utica before 
midnight. 
Although he has wronged me, still I cannot believe he is my enemy. 
Since four is the square of two, therefore two is the square root of four. 
If Allen’s testimony is true, then Gilbert’s must be false. 
370. But is used as a subordinate conjunction in the sense 
of but that or unless. 
There is no doubt but that they are murderers. — SHELLEY. 
Your uncle must not know but [ = but that] you are dead. — SHaKsPERE. 
Ne’er may I look on day but [= unless] she tells your highness the 
truth. — Suaxsprere. [This use is obsolete.] 
There is not a wave of the Seine but is associated in my mind with the 
first rise of the sandstones and forest pines of Fontainebleau. — Ruskin. 
There was nobody but loved her. 
Nore. In the last two examples the subject of the subordinate clause is 
omitted : — ‘‘ There is not a wave but [it] is associated,” ‘‘ There was nobody _ 
but [he] loved her.” In such cases, but is sometimes regarded as a relative 
pronoun. 
Notwithstanding is used as a subordinate conjunction in the 
sense of though. 
I shall go, notwithstanding the road is said to be impassable. 
371. Relative adverbs are similar in their use to conjunctions, 
and are therefore often called conjunctive adverbs ($§ 194-195). 
Nore. Most conjunctions, historically considered, are merely adverbs (or 
adverbial phrases) which have come to be used in so peculiar a way as to form 
a special class among the parts of speech. Thus the adverbs since and while 
become conjunctions when they cease to denote time; because is a corruption 
of the phrase by cause ; but is developed from an old adverb meaning “‘ outside.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-173
  INTERJECTIONS 155 
CHAPTER IX 
INTERJECTIONS 
372. An interjection is a cry or other exclamatory sound expressing 
surprise, anger, pleasure, or some other emotion or feeling. 
Exampres: O (or oh), ah, hullo (holloa, halloo), bah, pshaw, fie, 
whew, tut-tut, st (often spelled hist), ha, aha, ha ha, ho, hey, hum, hem, 
heigh-ho (heigh-o), alas, bravo, lo. 
When written, interjections are often followed by an ex- 
clamation point (). 
373. Among interjections are properly included calls to 
animals (like “whoa!”) and imitations of sounds such as 
“mew!” “cock-a-doodle-do!” “ding dong!” “swish!” “tu- 
whit-tu-who!” 
374. Interjections usually have no grammatical connection with the 
phrases or sentences in which they stand. 
Hence they are counted among the “independent elements” 
of a sentence (§ 501). 
_ Sometimes, however, a substantive is connected with an 
interjection by means of a preposition. Thus, — 
O for a camera! 
Alas for my hopes! 
Adjectives and adverbs are also found in this use: as, — 
“Good for you!” “Up with it!” 
Nore. All such expressions are often regarded as elliptical sentences, as 
if ‘‘O for a camera!” stood for ‘tO, I wish for a camera!” and ‘‘ Good for 
you! ” for “‘ That is good for you!”” Butit is better to treat them as exclamatory 
phrases.1 Other exclamatory phrases are ‘‘ Dear me!” ‘ Goodness gracious! ” 
“O my!” and the like. 
1 Compare the exclamatory sentence (§ 3) and the exclamatory nominative 
§ 88, 4).  
-P-A-G-E-174
    
156 INTERJECTIONS 
375. Almost any part of speech may be used as an ex- 
clamation. 
Nonsense! I do not believe it. On! 
Fire! Away! 
Halt! Back, villains ! 
Good! I like that! I! not a bit of it! 
Forward ! But——_! 
Such words are often called interjections, but it is better to 
describe them as nouns, adjectives, etc.; used in exclamation, 
and to confine the term interjection to words which belong to 
no other part of speech. 
Norx. Thus nonsense! and fire! are nouns in the exclamatory nomina- 
tive; I/ is a pronoun in the same construction; halt! is a verb in the im- 
perative (compare hark! hush! behold! look!); good! is an adjective; 
forward! on! away! and back! are adverbs; but/ is a conjunction. 
The following examples illustrate various exclamatory expres- 
sions, — words, phrases, and sentences : — 
How late I shuddered on the brink !— Youne. 
‘Right ! right !”’ a thousand tongues exclaimed. — Sournry. 
The pale stars are gone !— SHELLEY. \ 
Poor widowed wretch ! ’t was there she wept in vain. —CamrBELL. 
O heartfelt raptures! Bliss beyond compare !— Burns. 
°T is done! dread Winter spreads his latest glooms. — Tomson. 
Heigh-ho! sing heigh-ho! unto the green holly. — Suaxsrere. 
I had—ah! have I now ?—a friend. — Byron. 
To arms!’ cried Mortimer, and couched his quivering lance. 
Gray. £2008 SUN rte 
10. O for the gentleness of old Romance !— Kzars. 
. Run!” exclaims she, with a toss of indignant astonishment. 
CARLYLE. 
. Can he keep himself still if he would! Oh, not he !—Worpsworru. » e e n

  CLAUSES AS PARTS OF SPEECH 157 
CHAPTER X 
CLAUSES AS PARTS OF SPEECH 
376. A clause is a group of words that forms part of a sentence and 
that contains a subject and a predicate. 
A clause used as a part of speech is called a subordinate clause (§ 46). 
377. A subordinate clause may be introduced by (1) a 
relative or an interrogative pronoun, (2) a relative or an 
interrogative adverb, (3) a subordinate conjunction. 
The relative pronouns are: who, which, what, that (= who or which), 
as (after such or same), and the compound relatives whoever, whichever, 
whatever. Their uses have already been studied (pp. 66-73). 
The chief relative adverbs are: where, whence, whither, wherever, when, 
whenever, while, before, after, till, until, since, as, how, why (p. 86). 
‘The interrogative pronouns are: who, which, what (§§ 163-165). 
The interrogative adverbs are: where, when, whence, whither, how, why. 
The most important subordinate conjunctions are: because, since (= be- 
cause), though, although, if, unless, that (in order that, so that), lest, as, as 
if, as though, than, whether (whether . . . or). 
378. According to their use as parts of speech, subordinate 
clauses are adjective, adverbial, or noun clauses. 
I. ADJECTIVE CLAUSES 
379. A subordinate clause that modifies a substantive is called an 
adjective clause (§ 47). 
Able men 
Men of ability Jean always find employment. 
Men who show ability 
Treeless spots 
Spots without trees } res plainly visible. 
Spots where no trees grew 
In each of these groups, a noun (men, spots) is modified 
(1) by an adjective, (2) by an adjective phrase, (3) by an 
adjective clause. The sense remains unchanged.
-P-A-G-E-176
  
158 CLAUSES AS PARTS OF SPEECH 
380. Adjective clauses may be introduced (1) by relative 
pronouns, (2) by relative adverbs of place (where, whence, whither, 
etc.) or time (when, while, etc.). 
II. ADVERBIAL CLAUSES 
381. A subordinate clause that serves as an adverbial modifier is 
called an adverbial clause (§ 47). 
thoughilessly. 
Jack spoke { without thinking. 
before he thought. 
: there. 
The schoolhouse mana a the crossroads. 
where the roads meet. 
monthly. 
We pay our rene om the first of every month. 
when the first of the month comes. 
In each of these groups, the verb (spoke, stands, pay) is 
modified (1) by an adverb, (2) by an adverbial phrase, (3) by 
an adverbial clause. 
382. Adverbial clauses may be introduced (1) by relative 
adverbs (when, where, before, etc.) ; (2) by subordinate conjunc- 
tions (if, though, because, etc.) ; (3) by relative or interrogative 
pronouns. 
383. Adverbial clauses oftenest modify verbs, but they are 
also common as modifiers of adjectives and adverbs. 
Angry because he had failed, he abandoned the undertaking. {The 
clause modifies angry.] 
Iam uncertain which road I should take. [The clause modifies uncertain. ] 
Farther than eye could see extended the waste of tossing waters. {The 
clause modifies farther.] 
Here, where the cliff was steepest, a low wall protected the path. [The 
clause modifies here.] 
384. An adverbial clause with that may be used to modify 
verbs and adjectives.
-P-A-G-E-177
  
NOUN CLAUSES 159 
He rejoiced that the victory was won. 
Iam glad that you are coming. 
He was positive that no harm had been done. 
They were unwilling that the case should be brought to trial. 
Nors. In this use that is equivalent either to ‘ because ” or to ‘as to the 
fact that.” The clause may be explained as a noun clause in the adverbial 
objective construction (§ 109). 
For the classification of adverbial clauses according to their 
meaning (place, time, cause, concession, etc.), see pp. 163-182. 
III. NOUN (OR SUBSTANTIVE) CLAUSES 
885. A subordinate clause that is used as a noun is called a noun 
(or substantive) clause (§.47). 
Agreement 
To agree Jaume impossible. 
That we should agree 
Victory 
To win jr out of the question. 
That we should win 
loss. 
The merchant tenet lose. 
that he might lose money. 
success. 
I exec succeed. 
that I shall succeed. 
In each of these groups a noun (agreement, victory, etc.) is 
replaced (1) by an infinitive, (2) by a noun clause. In the 
first two examples, the noun clause is the subject; in the last 
two, it is the object of a verb (feared, expect). 
386. Noun clauses may be used in any of the more impor- 
tant constructions of nouns : — (1) as subject, (2) as direct object 
of a transitive verb, (3) in apposition with a substantive, (4) as 
@ predicate nominative. 
That Milton was spared has often caused surprise. [Subject.] 
Brutus said that Cesar was a tyrant. [Object of said.]
-P-A-G-E-178
  
160 CLAUSES AS PARTS OF SPEECH 
Cesar commanded that the prisoners should be spared. [Object.] 
I wish that you would work harder. [Object.] 
The traveller inquired where he could find the inn. [Object.] 
He asked me what my name was. [Second object of asked.] 
My fear that the bridge might fall proved groundless. [Apposition with 
Sear.) 
One fact is undoubted, — that the state of America has been kept in con- 
tinval agitation. —Burxx. [Apposition with fact.] 
The old saying is that misery loves company. [Predicate nominative.] 
387. Noun clauses may be introduced (1) by the subordinate 
conjunctions that, whether (whether... or), and if (in the 
sense of whether); (2) by the interrogative pronouns who, 
which, what ; (3) by the interrogative adverbs where, whence, 
whither, how, why, when (§ 196). 
388. Noun clauses are common as objects of verbs (1) of 
commanding, desiring, etc.; (2) of telling, thinking, ete.; (8) 
of asking, doubting, etc. 
See (1) clauses of purpose (§ 406); (2) indirect discourse (§§ 431-437) ; (3) 
indirect questions (§ 443). 
Object clauses frequently omit that (§ 367). 
Charles said [that] he was sorry. 
I hope you will come. 
I wish he would help me. 
For the infinitive clause replacing a thatclause as object, 
see §§ 324-325. 
389. A noun clause may be used as the retained object of a 
passive verb (§ 253). 
Active Voice Passtve Voice 
(Crause as OpsEct) (Rerainep OxsEcT) 
They informed me that the train I was informed that the train was

-P-A-G-E-179
  NOUN CLAUSES 161 
390. A noun clause may be the object of a preposition. 
I see no reason for a lawsuit except that both parties are stubborn. 
[Compare : except the stubbornness of both.] 
She never studies, except when she can find nothing else to do. 
I could say nothing but [= except] that I was sorry. 
Justice was well administered in his time, save where the king was 
party. — Bacon. 
She could see me from where she stood. 
There is a dispute as to which of the miners first staked out the claim. 
For a noun clause used as an adverbial objective, see § 384. 
391. Noun clauses with hat are common in the predicate 
when the expletive it is the grammatical subject (§ 120, 2). 
It was plain that war was at hand. 
It was clear that this administration would last but a very short time. 
It must be admitted that there were many extenuating circumstances. 
It was by slow degrees that Fox became a brilliant and powerful debater. 
It was under the command of a foreign general that the British had 
triumphed at Minden. 
In such sentences the real subject of the thought is the 
clause. This, however, may be regarded as grammatically in 
apposition with i, as if one said “ J¢ (that war was at hand) 
was plain.” 
Nors. This useful idiom enables us to adopt a kind of inverted order 
(§ 5), and thus to shift the emphasis. Contrast ‘* That war was at hand was 
plain” with “‘ J¢ was plain that war was at hand.” In the former sentence, 
the noun clause is made prominent; in the latter, the adjective plain. 
392. The following sentences, taken from distinguished 
authors of different periods, illustrate the usefulness of the 
noun clause in its various constructions. 
1. That the king would ever again have received Becket into favor is 
not to be believed. — Sourney. 
2. That in education we should proceed from the simple to the complex 
is a truth which has always been to some extent acted on.— SPENCER. 
3. How great his reputation was, is proved by the embassies sent to 
him. — Corzriper.

CHAPTER XI 
THE MEANINGS OF SUBORDINATE CLAUSES 
393. Subordinate clauses may be classified not only accord- 
ing to their use as parts of speech, but also, in quite a different 
way, in accordance with their various meanings. These distinc- 
tions in idea are of capital importance for the accurate and 
forcible expression of thought. 
394. The variety of meanings which subordinate clauses 
may express is great, but most of these meanings come under 
the following heads :— (1) place or time, (2) cause, (3) conces- 
sion, (4) purpose, (5) result, (6) condition, (7) comparison,* (8) in- 
direct discourse, (9) indirect question. 
The general meaning of the clause is usually indicated by 
the word which introduces it. 
I. CLAUSES OF PLACE AND TIME 
395. An adjective or an adverbial clause may express place or time. 
I. ApsectivE CLAUSES 
The house where the robbery occurred is No. 14. 
The bridge over which we rode is in ruins. 
There is a point beyond which you cannot go. 
The day when (or on which) I was to sail arrived at last.

Whithersoever I go, fear dogs my steps. 
Whenever the bell rings, you must take down the receiver. 
Esmond heard the chimes as he sat in his own chamber. 
I have lived in Cairo since my father died. 
1 Including clauses of manner and degree (§§ 428-429).  
-P-A-G-E-182
  164 MEANINGS OF SUBORDINATE CLAUSES 
396. Adjective clauses of place and time may be introduced 
by relative pronouns (see examples above). 
Adjective and adverbial clauses of place and time may be 
introduced by relative adverbs. Thus, — 
Pracz : where, whence, whither, wherever, whithersoever, wherefrom, 
whereto, etc. 
Time: when, whenever, while, as, before, after, until, since. 
For as and since in causal clauses, see §398; for while in concessive 
clauses, see § 399. 
397. Clauses of time are sometimes shortened by the omis- 
sion of the copula and its subject. 
‘When [he was] rescued, he was almost dead. 
Tom was attacked by cramp while swimming across the river. 
II. CAUSAL CLAUSES 
398. An adverbial clause may express cause. 
Causal clauses are introduced by the subordinate conjunctions 
because, since, as, inasmuch as, and sometimes that. 
I came home because I was tired. 
As the day was clear, we decided to climb the mountain. 
Since you will not relent, you must take the consequences. 
We were glad that the wreck was no worse. 
Tom was delighted that his friend was safe. 
Since is a preposition or an adverb when it denotes time; as is an adverb 
when it denotes time. Both since and as are conjunctions when they express 
cause. For as used as a relative pronoun, see § 147. 
IM. CONCESSIVE CLAUSES 
399. An adverbial clause may express concession. \ 
A concessive clause is usually introduced by a subordinate 
conjunction, though, although, or even if. It admits (or con- 
cedes) some fact or supposition in spite of which the assertion 
in the main clause is made.
-P-A-G-E-183
CONCESSIVE CLAUSES 165 
Although I do not like his manners, I respect his character. 
We won the game, though we expected to lose. 
Even if you fail, you will have gained experience. 
Even if you were a king, you would find somebody or something more 
powerful than yourself. 
Though he should read books forever, he would not grow wise. 
Norr. While is often used as a weaker or more courteous synonym for 
although. 
The main clause, when it follows the concessive clause, may 
be emphasized by means of yet, still, nevertheless. 
Although the task was heavy, yet his courage never failed. [Although 
and yet are correlative conjunctions (§ 369).] 
Though his reputation was great at home, yet it was greater abroad. 
Concessive clauses sometimes omit the copula and its subject. 
Though [he was] tired, he was not disheartened. 
This punishment, though perhaps necessary, seems rather severe. 
400. For the distinction between the indicative and the 
subjunctive in concessive clauses, see § 279; for that between 
should and would, see § 305. 
401. A concessive clause may be introduced by the con- 
junction as, or by a relative pronoun or a relative adverb. 
Whatever you say, 
Whichever argument you present, bie will carry his point. 
However much you object, 
Weak as I am, I will make the effort. 
Gay as the scene was, ’*t was but a dreary place for Mr. Esmond. 
Nors. The adverbial use of however is quite distinct from its use as a 
coérdinate conjunction (§ 362). 
402. Concession is sometimes expressed by a subjunctive 
clause without a conjunction to introduce it (§ 281). 
Be it ever so humble, there ’s no place like home. 
I will help you, cost what it may!

404. Clauses of purpose may be introduced by the subordinate 
conjunction that or by a phrase containing it (so that, in order 
that, to the end that, etc.). 
Negative clauses of purpose may be introduced by that... 
not or by lest. For lest with the subjunctive, see § 284. 
Take heed lest thou fall. 
I feared lest I might anger thee. —SHAKSPERE. 
405. Clauses of result may be introduced by the phrase so 
that, consisting of the adverb so and the subordinate conjunc- 
tion that ; or by that alone, especially when so, such, or some 
similar word stands in the main clause. 
406. A clause of purpose or of result may be either an 
adverbial clause (as in § 403) or a substantive clause.
-P-A-G-E-185
  
CLAUSES OF PURPOSE AND OF RESULT 167

My intention is that you shall be appointed. [Predicate nominative.] 
The result is that he is bankrupt. [Predicate nominative.]

407. A substantive clause of purpose is often used as the 
object of a verb of commanding, desiring, or the like. 
The general ordered that the fort should be blown up. 
The prisoner begged that his fetters might be struck off. 
408. For subordinate clauses with shall or should, implying 
purpose or expectation, see § 304.

VI. CONDITIONAL SENTENCES 
411. Aclause that expresses a condition introduced by if, or by some 
equivalent word or phrase, is called a conditional clause. 
A sentence that contains a conditional clause is called a conditional 
sentence. 
If it rains, we shall remain at home. 
I shall attend the convention if I am in town. 
I will take this book, if you please.
-P-A-G-E-186
  168 MEANINGS OF SUBORDINATE CLAUSES 
412. A conditional sentence in its simplest form consists of 
two parts : — 
(1) A subordinate (adverbial) clause, commonly introduced 
by if, and expressing the condition. 
(2) A main clause expressing the conclusion, that is, the 
statement which is true in case the condition expressed in the 
of-clause is true. 
Thus in the first example in § 411, the condition is if it rains; the con- 
clusion is we shall remain at home. 
Either the condition or the conclusion may come first. 
The conditional clause is often called the protasis, and the conclusion is 
often called the apodosis. 
The conclusion of a conditional sentence may be declarative, 
interrogative, imperative, or exclamatory. 
If you go to Philadelphia, where shall you stay? [Interrogative.] 
Sit here, if you wish. [Imperative.] 
If you win the prize, how glad I shall be! [Exclamatory.] 
413. A conditional clause may be introduced by provided 
(or provided that), granted that, supposing (or suppose), on 
condition that. 
I will permit you to go, on condition that you come home early. 
You may have the money, provided you will put it in the bank. 
Supposing (or suppose) it rains, what shall we do? 
Suppose is really an imperative and supposing a participle, the clause being 
the object. 
414. A negative condition is commonly introduced by if... . 
not or unless. 
I will wait for him, if you do not object. 
Unless you overcome that habit, you will be ruined. 
415. Double (or alternative) conditions may be introduced by 
whether... or. 
Whether he goes or stays, he must pay a week’s board. [Compare: If 
he goes or if he stays, etc.] 
He is determined to buy that car, whether you approve or not. [That 
is: ¢f you approve or if you do not approve.]  
-P-A-G-E-187
  
CONDITIONAL SENTENCES 169 
416. A conditional clause may be introduced by whoever, 
whenever, or some similar compound (§§ 159, 195). 
Whoever offends, is punished. [Compare: If anybody offends, he is 
punished. ] 
Whoever shall offend, shall be punished. 
Whomever you ask, you will be disappointed. [Compare : If you shall 
ask anybody.] 
He will come whenever [= if ever] he is called. 
Nore. In older English and in poetry, who is common in this construction: 
as, —‘* Who [= whoever] steals my purse, steals trash” (SHAKSPERE). 
417. A conditional clause sometimes omits the copula and 
its subject. 
I will go if [it is] necessary. 
If [it is] possible, come to-morrow. 
The ifclause is sometimes used as an exclamation, with the 
conclusion omitted. 
If I only had a rifle! 
418. A condition may be expressed by means of an assertion, 
a question, an imperative, or the absolute construction (§ 345). 
We take the receiver from the hook, and the operator answers. We 
replace it, and the connection is broken. [Compare: If we take the 
receiver from the hook, the operator answers, etc.] 
Press that button, and the bell will ring. 
Do you refuse ? Then you must take the consequences. 
We shall sail on Monday, weather permitting. 
Nore. In such cases, there is no subordinate conditional clause. Thus, in 
the first example, we have two independent codrdinate clauses, making a 
compound sentence (§ 44). 
FORMS OF CONDITIONS 
419. Conditional sentences show great variety of form, but 
it is easy to classify them according to the time of the supposed 
case and the degree of doubt that the speaker expresses. 
420. Conditions may be present, past, or future. 
SS  
-P-A-G-E-188
  170 MEANINGS OF SUBORDINATE CLAUSES 
PRESENT AND Past ConpDITIONS 
421. Present and past conditions may be either (1) non- 
committal or (2) contrary to fact. 
1. A condition is non-committal when it implies nothing as 
to the truth or falsity of the case supposed. 
If James is angry, I am sorry. [Perhaps James is angry, perhaps not.] 
2. A condition is contrary to fact when it implies that the 
supposed case is not or was not true. 
If James were angry, I should be sorry. [James is not angry.] 
422. In a non-committal present condition, the if-clause! takes 
the present indicative; in a non-committal past condition, the 
past, the perfect, or the pluperfect. 
The conclusion may be in any form that the sense allows. 
I. Present Conpition, Non-coMMITTAL 
it is valuable. 
guard it carefully. 
you have made a great discovery. 
you will get a large sum for it. 
why are you so careless of it ? 
what a prize it is! 
Tf it is raining, shut the window. 
he is a lucky boy. 
If Jack lives in this house, {zg the bell. 
he has moved since last May. If this pebble is a diamond,

he has done his duty. 
If Tom has apologized, {yo ought to excuse him. 
forgive him. 
If John had reached home before we started, he must have made a 
quick journey. 
1 By ‘‘if-clause”’ is meant the protasis, whatever the conjunction.
-P-A-G-E-189
  CONDITIONAL SENTENCES 171 
In each of these examples, the speaker declines to commit 
himself as to the truth of the supposed case. Perhaps the 
pebble was a diamond, perhaps not; Tom may or may not 
have apologized; whether or not John had reached home, we 
cannot tell. 
423. In a condition contrary to fact, the ifclause takes the 
past subjunctive when the condition refers to present time, 
the pluperfect subjunctive when it refers to past time. 
The conclusion regularly takes should or would (§ 286, 3). 
If John were here, I should recognize him. [Present condition, presents 
conclusion. ] 
If John were here, I should have recognized him before this. [Present 
condition, past conclusion.] 
If I had offended him, I should have regretted it. [Past condition, past 
conclusion.] 
If I had then offended him, I should regret it now. [Past condition, 
present conclusion.] 
In each of these sentences, the speaker distinctly implies 
that the supposed case (or condition) is (or was) not a fact. 
It follows, of course, that the conclusion is not a fact: — John 
is not here; therefore I do not recognize him. 
424. In conditions contrary to fact, the subjunctive without 
if is common. In this use, the subject follows the verb (§ 281). 
Were he my friend, I should expect his help. [= If he were my friend. 
Present condition, contrary to fact.] 
Had he been my friend, I should have expected his help. [=If he 
had been my friend. Past condition, contrary to fact.] 
Norg. In older English, the subjunctive may be used in both clauses: as, — 
‘He were no lion, were not Romans hinds” (SHAKSPERE). 
Future Conpirions 
425. Future conditions always imply doubt, for no one can tell 
what may or may not happen to-morrow. 
426. In all future conditions, some verb-form denoting 
future time is used in both clauses.

172 MEANINGS OF SUBORDINATE CLAUSES 
1. In a future condition which suggests nothing as to the 
probability or improbability of the case supposed, the present 
indicative is regularly used in the ifclause, and the future 
indicative in the conclusion. 
If it rains to-morrow, I shall not go. 
In very formal or exact language a verb-phrase with shall may be used in 
the jf-clause: as, —‘‘If it shall rain to-morrow, I shall not go.” 
2. The present subjunctive is sometimes used in the if- 
clause. This form commonly suggests more doubt than the 
present indicative. 
If it rain to-morrow, I shall not go. 
3. In a future condition which puts the supposed case rather 
vaguely, often with a considerable suggestion of doubt, a verb- 
phrase with should or would is used in both clauses. 
If it should rain to-morrow, I should not go. 
For the use of should or would in such clauses, see § 305. 
A phrase with were to may replace the should-phrase in the 
if-clause. This form often emphasizes the suggestion of doubt. 
If it were to rain to-morrow, I should not go. 
The past subjunctive may stand in the ifclause instead of 
the should-phrase. 
If it rained to-morrow, I should not go. 
Nore. The comparative amount of doubt implied in the different kinds of 
future conditions cannot be defined with precision; for it varies with the cir- 
cumstances or the context, and often depends on emphasis or the tone of the 
voice. Thus, in ‘if it should rain to-morrow,” should may be so emphasized. 
as to make the supposed case seem highly improbable, whereas an emphasis 
on to-morrow would have a very different effect. As to the subjunctive, its 
use is often due rather to the writer’s liking for that mood than to any special 
doubt in his mind. 
427. For even if in concessive clauses, see § 399; for as if 
in clauses of comparison, see § 428; for if (in the sense of 
whether) in indirect questions, see § 442.

CLAUSES OF COMPARISON 173 
VII. CLAUSES OF COMPARISON 
428. An adverbial clause introduced by as if may express com- 
parison. 
You speak as if you were angry.” 
He breathes as if he were exhausted. 
She cared for me as if I had been her son. 
As though is also used, but as if is now preferred by most writers. . 
The subjunctive were, not the indicative was, is used after 
as if (§ 282). 
429. As and than, as subordinate conjunctions, introduce 
clauses of comparison or degree. 
You are as old as he [is]. 
Iam younger than you [are]. 
He weighs as much as I [weigh]. 
I pity you more than [I pity] her. 
When the verb is omitted, the substantive that follows as 
or than is in the same case in which it would stand if the 
verb were expressed. Thus, — 
You are stronger than he. [Nor: than him.] 
I see you oftener than him. [Nor: than he.] 
He plays a better game than I. [Nor: than me.] 
They will miss John more than me. [That is: more than they miss me.] 
VIII. INDIRECT DISCOURSE 
430. A quotation may be direct or indirect. 
A direct quotation repeats a speech or thought in its original 
form. 
I replied: ‘tI am sorry to hear it.” 
* Henceforth,’’ he explained, ‘I shall call on Tuesdays.” 
** You must see California,’’ she insisted. 
1 Clauses introduced by as are often called clauses of manner. 
2 Such sentences are elliptical in origin. Thus, ‘The man acts as if he were 
crazy ” is equivalent to ‘The man acts as [he would act] if he were crazy.” 
But it is not necessary to supply the ellipsis in analyzing.
-P-A-G-E-192
    174 MEANINGS OF SUBORDINATE CLAUSES 
‘* Elizabeth no longer lives here,’’ he said. 
“I know nothing about it,’’ was the witness’s reply. 
‘*Where,”’ thought I, ‘tare the crew? ’?1 
An indirect quotation repeats a speech or thought in substance, 
but usually with some change in its form. 
An indirect quotation, when a statement, is a subordinate 
clause dependent on some word of saying or thinking, and 
introduced by the conjunction that. 
I replied that I was sorry to hear it. [Direct: I am sorry.] 
He explained that henceforth he should call on Tuesdays. 
She insisted that I must see California. 
A direct quotation begins with a capital letter, unless it is a frag- 
ment of a sentence. It is enclosed in quotation marks. 
An indirect quotation begins with a small letter. It usually has 
no quotation marks. 
431. A substantive clause introduced by that may be used with verbs 
and other expressions of telling, thinking, knowing, and perceiving, to report 
the words or thought of a person in substance, but usually with some 
change of form. 
Such clauses are said to be in the indirect discourse. 
For distinction, a remark or a thought in its original form (as in a direct 
quotation) is said to be in the direct discourse. 
432. Statements in indirect discourse, being substantive 
clauses, may be used in various noun constructions: (1) as 
object of some verb of telling, thinking, or the like, (2) as sub- 
ject, (3) as predicate nominative, (4) as appositive. 
He said that the box was empty. [Object.] 
That the box was empty was all he could say. [Subject.] 
My remark was that the bill is a menace. [Predicate nominative.] 
Your remark, that the bill is a menace, has aroused vigorous protest. 
[Apposition.} 
1In analyzing, the direct quotation may be regarded as the object of the 
verb of saying, etc. (or the subject, if that verb is passive); and if it forms 
a complete sentence, this may be analyzed as if it stood by itself. It is not 
proper to regard the direct quotation as a subordinate clause.
-P-A-G-E-193
  INDIRECT DISCOURSE 175 
433. The conjunction that is often omitted. 
Jack said [that] he was sorry. 
I hope [that] you can come. 
I know he is too busy a man to have leisure for me. — CowrER. 
434. In indirect discourse, after the past or the pluperfect 
tense, the present tense of the direct discourse becomes past, 
and the perfect becomes pluperfect. 
1. Direct: I am tired. 
Ix : John { Sd hat hi ired NpiRECT: JObN4 hag said that he was tired. 
2. Direct: I have won, 
Inprrect: Jonn {Fae saia } that he had won. 
But a general or universal truth always remains in the 
present tense. 
Drrect: Air is a gas. 
Inprrect: I told him that air is a gas. 
Invrrecr: I had told him a hundred times that air is a gas. 
435. The clause with ¢hat in indirect discourse is sometimes 
replaced by an infinitive clause (§ 325). 
The jury declared him to be innocent. [Compare: The jury declared 
that he was innocent.] 
Morton admitted them to be counterfeit. [Compare: Morton admitted 
that they were counterfeit.] 
In these sentences, him and them are, of course, the subjects of the infini- 
tives, not the objects of declared and admitted. 
436. When the verb of telling or thinking is in the passive 
voice, three constructions occur : — 
1. A clause with that is used as the subject of the passive 
verb. That Rogers desires the office is commonly reported. 
2. The expletive it is used as the grammatical subject, and 
a that-clause follows the passive verb. 
It is commonly reported that Rogers desires the office. 
 
-P-A-G-E-194
' 
176 MEANINGS OF SUBORDINATE CLAUSES 
3. The subject of the ¢hat-clause becomes the subject of the 
passive verb, and the verb of the clause is replaced by an 
infinitive. 
Rogers is commonly reported to desire the office. 
The choice among these three idioms is largely a matter of 
emphasis or euphony. The first may easily become heavy or 
awkward, and it is therefore less common than either of the 
others. 
Nore. The third of these idioms is often called the personal construction, 
to distinguish it from the second, in which the grammatical subject is the im- 
personal it (§ 120, 1). The infinitive in this third idiom may be regarded as a 
peculiar adverbial modifier of the passive verb. 
Further examples of the three constructions with passive 
verbs of telling, thinking, etc., are the following : — 
That in vivacity, humor, and eloquence, the Irish stand high among 
the nations of the world is now universally acknowledged. — Macautay. 
It is admitted that the exercise of the imagination is most delightful. 
SHELiey. 
It must be owned that Charles’s life has points of some originality. 
STEVENSON. 
Porto Bello is still said to be impregnable, and it is reported the Dutch 
have declared war against us. — Gray. 
He was generally believed to have been a pirate. — Lyrron. 
Pope may be said to write always with his reputation in his head. 
JOuNSON. 
She was observed to flutter her fan with such vehement rapidity that 
the elaborate delicacy of its workmanship gave way. — HAWTHORNE. 
This is said to be the only chateau in France in which the ancient 
furniture of its original age is preserved. — LoncreLiow. 
437. A substantive clause with that is common after it seems, 
it is true, it is evident, and similar expressions. 
It seems that Robert has lost all his money. 
It is true that genius does not always bring happiness with it. 
It is evident that Andrews tells the truth. 
This construction is really the same as that in § 436, 2.  
-P-A-G-E-195
  INDIRECT DISCOURSE TOU 
438. The uses of shall and will, should and would, in in- 
direct discourse are the same as in the direct,’ with the following 
exception : — 
When the first person with shall or should in direct discourse becomes 
the second or third person in the indirect, shall or should is retained. 
Direct: You say, ‘'I shall die.” 
Inpirect: You say that you shall die. 
Direct: You said, ‘I shall die.” 
Inprrect: You said that you should die. 
Drrecr: He says, ‘tI shail die.” 
InpirEct: He says that he shall die. 
Direct: He said, ‘* I shall die.” 
Inprrect: He said that he should die. 
The reason for the retention of shall or should is that, in 
such cases, the second or third person of the indirect discourse 
represents the first person of the direct. 
The change from shall (after says) to should (after said) is 
a mere change of tense, according to the rule in § 434. 
Nors. The general principle is, to retain in the indirect discourse the aux- 
iliary of the direct, simply changing the tense if necessary (§ 434). This prin- 
ciple of course covers the use of you or he shail or should to represent I 
shall or should. There is, however, one important exception to the general 
principle: when its application would result in the use of J will or I would to 
express mere futurity, I shall or I should is employed. Thus, John says to 
Charles, ‘If you fall overboard, you will drown; but Charles, reporting this, 
must say, ‘John tells me that, if I fall overboard, J shall [Nor will] drown.” 
The general rule, then, may be stated as follows: The indirect discourse re- 
tains the auxiliary of the direct (with a change in tense, if necessary), unless 
such retention makes will or would express simple futurity in the first person, — 
in that case, shall or should is used. 
439. The following sentences illustrate the correct use of 
shall and will, should and would, in the indirect discourse : — 
1. He writes me that he believes he shall be at Eton till the middle 
of November.— Gray. [Direct : I shall be at Eton.]

—Macaviay. [Direct: If I apply myself . . ., I shall raise, etc.]

INDIRECT QUESTIONS 179 
IX. INDIRECT QUESTIONS 
440. A question expressed in the form actually used in asking it is 
called a direct question. 
What is your name ? 
*t What is your name ?’’ he asked. 
The direct form may be retained when the question is quoted 
or reported, as in the second example above. Often, however, 
a question is quoted or reported, not in the direct form, but in 
the form of a subordinate clause: as, — 
He asked what my name was. 
Such a clause is called an indirect question. 
441. An indirect question expresses the substance of a direct ques- 
tion in the form of a subordinate clause. 
Indirect questions depend on verbs or other expressions of asking, 
doubting, thinking, perceiving, and the like. 
Franklin asked where the difficulty lay. [Direct question: ‘t Where 
does the difficulty lie ? ’’] 
The sergeant wondered how he should escape. [Direct question : ' How 
shall I escape ? ’’] 
I have not decided which train I shall take. [Direct question : ‘t Which 
train shall I take ? ’] 
442. Both direct and indirect questions may be introduced (1) 
by the interrogative pronouns who, which, what ; (2) by the 
interrogative adverbs when, where, whence, whither, how, why. 
Indirect questions may be introduced by the subordinate con- 
junctions whether (whether ... or) and if. 
The use of tenses in indirect questions is the same as in the 
indirect discourse (§ 434). 
The constable inquired whether (or if) I lived in Casterbridge. [His 
question was: Do you live in Casterbridge ?] 
Your father wishes to know if you have been playing truant. [Direct 
question: Have you been playing truant ?] ~ 
I considered whether I should apply to Kent or to Arnold. [Direct 
question: Shall I apply to Kent or to Arnold ?] 
   
-P-A-G-E-198
  
  180 MEANINGS OF SUBORDINATE CLAUSES 
443. Indirect questions are usually noun clauses. They may 
be used in various noun constructions : (1) as object of some verb 
of asking or the like, (2) as subject, (3) as predicate nominative, 
(4) as appositive, (5) as object of a preposition. 
‘The skipper asked what had become of the cook. [Object.] 
He was asked what his profession was. [Retained object after the 
passive (§§ 253, 389).] 
How we could escape was a difficult question. [Subject.] 
The problem was how they should find food. [Predicate nominative. ] 
The question who was to blame has never been settled. [Apposition 
with question.] 
They all felt great perplexity as to what they should do. [Object of a 
preposition. ] 
An indirect question may be an adverbial clause. 
‘They were uncertain what course they should take. [The clause modifies 
uncertain.] 
Edmund was in doubt where he should spend the night. [The clause 
modifies the adjective phrase in doubt.] 
444. Since the pronouns who, which, and what may be either 
interrogative or relative, an indirect question may closely re- 
semble a relative clause. These two constructions, however, 
are sharply distinguished. A relative clause always asserts some- 
thing. An indirect question, on the contrary, has an interrogative 
sense which may be seen by turning the question into the direct 
form. 
The sailor who saved the child is a Portuguese. [The clause who saved 
the child is a relative clause, for it makes a distinct assertion about the 
sailor, —namely, that he saved the child. Who is a relative pronoun 
and sailor is its antecedent.] 
Iasked 
I do not know ‘ 
It is still a question f 20 saved the child. 
It is doubtful 
[Here the clause who saved the child makes no assertion. On the con- 
trary, it expresses a question which may easily be put in a direct form 
with an interrogation point : t Who saved the child?” Who is an inter- 
rogative pronoun, It has no antecedent.)
-P-A-G-E-199
INDIRECT QUESTIONS 181 
The following examples further illustrate the difference be- 
tween these two constructions : — 
1. I foresee the course which he will take. [Relative clause.] 
I foresee which course he will take. [Indirect question.] 
2. I heard what he said. [Relative clause. What = ‘that which.’’] 
I wondered what he said. [Indirect question. What is an interroga- 
tive pronoun.] 
3. This is the man who brought the news. [Relative clause.] 
The king asked who brought the news. [Indirect question.] 
4. Here is a paper which you must sign. [Relative clause.] 
The clerk will tell you which paper you must sign. [Indirect question.] 
Nore. In such a sentence as ‘Tom knows who saved the child,” the in- 
direct question may at first appear to be a relative clause with an omitted 
antecedent (the man, or the person). If, however, we insert such an antece- 
dent (‘Tom knows the man who saved the child”), the meaning is com- 
pletely changed. In the original sentence, it is stated that Tom knows the 
answer to the question, ‘‘ Who saved the child?” In the new form of the sen- 
tence, it is stated that Tom is acquainted with a certain person, and to this is 
added an assertion about this person in the form of a relative clause. 
445. An indirect question is sometimes expressed by means 
of an interrogative pronoun or adverb followed by an infinitive. 
Whom to choose is a serious question. [Direct question: Whom shall 
we choose ?] 
John asked what to do. [John’s question was: What shall I do ?] 
I know where to go. [Direct question: Where shall I go ?] 
Tell me when to strike the bell. ‘ 
I was at a loss how to reply. 
I am in doubt how to begin this essay. 
In the first four examples the italicized phrase is used as a 
noun (either as subject or object). In the fifth, the phrase how 
to reply is adverbial, modifying the adjective phrase at a loss. 
446. The subjunctive was formerly common in indirect ques- 
tions, and is still occasionally used after ¢f or whether. 
I doubt if it be true. 
Elton questioned whether the project were wise.

  182 MEANINGS OF SUBORDINATE CLAUSES 
447. The rule for shall (should) and will (would) in indirect 
questions is, to retain the auxiliary used in the direct question, 
merely changing the tense (shall to should ; will to would) 
when necessary (§ 442).

Norte. There is a single exception to the rule in § 447. When, in changing 
from a direct to an indirect question, the third person with will or would be- 
comes the first, shall or should is substituted unless volition is expressed. 
Thus, John says to Thomas, ‘* Will Charles die of his wound?” Charles, 
reporting John’s question, says, ‘‘ John asked Thomas whether J should die of 
my wound.” Compare § 438, note.

PART THREE 
ANALYSIS 
CHAPTER I 
THE STRUCTURE OF SENTENCES 
448. Analysis is a Greek word which means “the act of dis- 
solving or breaking up.” In grammar it is applied to the sepa- 
ration of a sentence into its constituent parts, or elements. To 
dissect a sentence in this way is to analyze it. 
The elements which make up a sentence are: (1) the simple 
subject; (2) the simple predicate; (3) modifiers; (4) the complements, 
— direct object, predicate objective, predicate adjective, predi- 
cate nominative; and (5) the so-called independent elements, — 
the interjection, the vocative (or nominative of direct address), 
the exclamatory nominative, and various parenthetical expres- 
sions (§ 501). 
449. The absolute essentials for a sentence are a substantive 
as subject and a verb as predicate (§ 35). By combining these 
two indispensable elements, in various ways, with modifiers 
and complements, the sentence may be extended to any length 
desired. Indeed, the sole limits are the constructive skill of 
the writer and the hearer’s ability to follow the thought with- 
out losing the thread. 
In the present chapter, we shall consider how sentences are 
built up, or constructed. Our starting point in this study will 
be the simple sentence. 
183  
-P-A-G-E-202
  
184 STRUCTURE OF SENTENCES 
SIMPLE SENTENCES 
450. The following statement is a simple sentence, for it con- 
tains but one subject and one predicate (§ 46) : — 
The polar bear | lives in the Arctic regions. 
The framework or skeleton of this simple sentence consists 
of the subject noun bear (the simple subject) and the predicate 
verb lives (the simple predicate). To make the complete subject, 
bear takes as modifiers the two adjectives the and polar; to 
make the complete predicate, dives takes as modifier the adverbial 
phrase in the Arctic regions. 
By attaching another simple subject to bear we make a 
compound subject. Similarly, we make a compound predicate by 
adding another verb (§ 38). 
The polar bear and the walrus | live and thrive in the Arctic regions. 
The compound subject is bear and walrus ; the compound 
predicate is live and thrive. Both verbs are modified by the 
adverbial phrase in the Arctic regions. The sentence itself is 
still a simple sentence. 
In each of the following simple sentences either the subject 
or the predicate or both are compound : — 
Games and carols closed the busy day. — Rogers. 
The stars leap forth, and tremble, and retire before the advancing 
moon, — Grorce Mprepirn. 
Madame Defarge knitted with nimble fingers and steady eyebrows, 
and saw nothing. — Dickens, 
Work or worry had left its traces upon his thin, yellow face. — Dortz. 
Crows flutter about the towers and perch on every weathercock. 
Irvine. 
He gained the door to the landing, pulled it open, and rushed forth. 
Lyrrton. 
Countrymen, butchers, drovers, hawkers, boys, thieves, idlers, and 
vagabonds of every low grade, were mingled together in a dense mass. 
Dickens. 
There stood the broad-wheeled wains and the antique plows and the 
harrows. — LoneFELLow.
-P-A-G-E-203
  
  COMPOUND SENTENCES 185 
Both Augustus and Peters joined with him in his design and insisted 
upon its immediately being carried into effect. — Por. 
Women and children, from garrets alike and cellars, through infinite 
London, look ‘down or look up with loving eyes upon our gay ribbons 
and our martial laurels. — Dz Quincey. 
COMPOUND SENTENCES 
451. If we attach another simple sentence to that in § 450, 
the result is a compound sentence. 
The polar bear |lives in the Arctic regions, || but || it | sometimes 
reaches temperate latitudes. 
This is manifestly a compound sentence, for it consists of two 
coérdinate clauses, joined by the conjunction but (§ 46). 
The framework of the second clause consists of the subject 
it and the simple predicate reaches. To make the complete 
predicate, the verb reaches takes not only a modifier (the 
adverb sometimes), but a complement, — the direct object lati- 
tudes, which completes the meaning of the verb. This noun is 
itself modified by the adjective temperate. Both clauses are 
simple, for each contains but one subject and one predicate. 
452. Obviously, almost any number of simple sentences may 
be joined (with or without conjunctions) to make one compound 
sentence. The quiet August noon has come ; 
A slumberous silence fills the sky ; 
The fields are still, the woods are dumb, 
In glassy sleep the waters lie. — Bryant. 
States fall, arts fade, but Nature does not die. — Byron. 
The court was sitting ; the case was heard ; the judge had finished ; 
and only the verdict was yet in arrear. — Dr Quincey. 
He softly blushed ; he sighed ; he hoped ; he feared ; he doubted ; he 
sometimes yielded to the delightful idea. —THackERay. 
A mob appeared before the window, a smart rap was heard at the 
door, the boys hallooed, and the maid announced Mr. Grenville.—Cowrrr. 
His health had suffered from confinement ; his high spirit had been 
cruelly wounded ; and soon after his liberation he died of a broken heart. 
Macautay.

  186 STRUCTURE OF SENTENCES 
COMPLEX SENTENCES 
453. The simple sentence in § 450 may be made complex by 
means of a subordinate clause used as a modifier (§ 47). . 
The polar bear, which lives in the Arctic regions, sometimes reaches 
temperate latitudes. 
The polar bear sometimes reaches temperate latitudes when the ice drifts 
southward. 
In the first example, the simple subject (ear), besides its two 
adjective modifiers (the and polar), takes a third, the adjective 
clause which lives in the Arctic regions (§ 47). The sentence, 
then, is complex: the main clause is the polar bear sometimes 
reaches temperate latitudes ; the subordinate clause is which 
lives in the Arctic regions. 
The second sentence is also complex. The main clause is 
the same as in the first (the polar bear sometimes reaches tem- 
perate latitudes). The subordinate clause is when the ice drifts 
southward, an adverbial modifier of the predicate verb reaches. 
COMPOUND AND COMPLEX CLAUSES 
454. Two or more codrdinate clauses may be joined to make 
one compound clause. 
The polar bear, which lives in the Arctic regions and whose physical con- 
stitution is wonderfully adapted to that frigid climate, sometimes reaches 
temperate latitudes. 
The polar bear sometimes reaches temperate latitudes when the floes 
break up and when the ice drifts southward. 
In the first example, the italicized words form a compound 
adjective clause, modifying the noun bear. It consists of two 
coérdinate adjective clauses joined by and. These clauses are 
codrdinate because they are of the same order or rank in the 
sentence (§ 46), each being (if taken singly) an adjective 
modifier of the noun. 
In the second example, the predicate verb reaches is modi- 
fied by a compound adverbial clause, similarly made up.
-P-A-G-E-205
  
COMPOUND COMPLEX SENTENCES 187 
455. A clause is complex when it contains a modifying clause. 
The polar bear, which lives in the Arctic regions when it is at home, 
sometimes reaches temperate latitudes. 
Here the adjective clause which lives in the Arctie regions 
when it is at home is complex, for it contains the adverbial 
clause when it is at home, modifying the verb lives. 
COMPOUND COMPLEX SENTENCES 
456. Two or more independent complex clauses may be 
joined to make a compound complex sentence. 
The brown bear, of which there are several varieties, is common in 
the temperate regions of the Eastern Hemisphere ; || and || the polar bear 
sometimes reaches temperate latitudes when the ice drifts southward. 
This is a compound complex sentence, for it consists of two 
complex clauses joined by the codrdinate conjunction and. 
Each of these two clauses is independent of the other, for 
each might stand by itself as a complex sentence. 
The first complex clause contains an adjective clause, of 
which there are several varieties, modifying bear ; the second 
contains an adverbial clause, when the ice drifts southward, 
modifying reaches. 
457. A sentence consisting of two or more independent 
clauses is also classed as a compound complex sentence if any 
one of these is complex. 
The brown bear is common in the temperate regions of the Eastern 
Hemisphere ; || and || the polar bear sometimes reaches temperate lati- 
tudes when the ice drifts southward. 
The brown bear, of which there are several varieties, is common in 
the temperate regions of the Eastern. Hemisphere ; || and || the polar 
bear sometimes reaches temperate latitudes. 
Both of these are compound complex sentences. In one, the 
first clause is simple (§ 451) and the second is complex. In the 
other, the first clause is complex and the second is simple.

  188 ANALYSIS OF SENTENCES 
CHAPTER II 
ANALYSIS OF SENTENCES 
SIMPLE SENTENCES 
458. In analyzing a simple sentence, we first divide it into 
the complete subject and the complete predicate. Then we point 
out the simple subject with its modifiers, and the simple predicate 
with its modifiers and complement (if there is one). If either the 
subject or the predicate is compound, we mention the simple 
subjects or predicates that are joined. 
1. The polar bear lives in the Arctic regions. 
This is a simple sentence. The complete subject is the polar bear; the 
complete predicate is lives in the Arctic regions. The simple subject is 
the noun bear; the simple predicate is the verb lives. Bear is modified 
by the adjectives the and polar ; lives is modified by the adverbial phrase 
in the Arctic regions. This phrase consists of the preposition in; its 
object, the noun regions; and the adjectives the and Arctic, modifying 
regions. 
2. The polar bear and the walrus live and thrive in the Arctic regions. 
The complete subject is the polar bear and the walrus. Two simple 
subjects (bear and walrus) are joined by the conjunction and to make a 
compound subject, and two simple predicates (live and thrive) are joined 
by and to make a compound predicate. Live and thrive are both modified 
by the adverbial phrase in the Arctic regions. 
COMPOUND SENTENCES 
459. In analyzing a compound sentence we first divide it into 
its codrdinate clauses, and then analyze each clause by itself. 
Thus, — . 
The polar bear lives in the Arctic regions, but it sometimes reaches 
temperate latitudes. 
This is a compound sentence consisting of two codrdinate clauses joined 
by the conjunction but: (1) the polar bear lives in the Arctic regions and 
(2) i sometimes reaches temperate latitudes. The complete subject of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-207
    
COMPLEX SENTENCES 189 
first clause is the polar bear [and so on, asin § 458, above]. The subject of the 
second clause is it; the complete predicate is sometimes reaches temperate 
latitudes. The simple predicate is reaches, which is modified by the adverb 
sometimes and is completed by the direct object latitudes. The comple- 
ment latitudes is modified by the adjective temperate. 
COMPLEX SENTENCES 
‘460. In analyzing a complex sentence, we first divide it into 
the main clause and the subordinate clause. 
1. The polar bear, which lives in the Arctic regions, sometimes reaches 
temperate latitudes. 
This is a complex sentence. The main clause is the polar bear some- 
times reaches temperate latitudes ; the subordinate clause is which lives in 
the Arctic regions. The complete subject of the sentence is the polar bear, 
which lives in the Arctic regions; the complete predicate is sometimes 
reaches temperate latitudes. The simple subject is bear, which is modified 
by the adjectives the and polar and by the adjective clause which lives in the 
Arctic regions. The simple predicate is reaches, which is modified by the 
adverb sometimes and completed by the direct object latitudes. This com- 
plement, latitudes, is modified by the adjective temperate. The subordinate 
clause is introduced by the relative pronoun which. [Then analyze the 
subordinate clause.] 
2. The polar bear reaches temperate latitudes when the ice drifts 
southward. 
This is a complex sentence. The main clause is the polar bear reaches 
temperate latitudes ; the subordinate clause is when the ice drifts southward. 
The complete subject of the sentence is the polar bear; the complete 
predicate is reaches temperate latitudes when the ice drifts southward. The 
simple subject is bear, which is modified by the adjectives the and polar. 
The simple predicate is reaches, which is modified by the adverbial clause 
when the ice drifts southward, and completed by the noun latitudes (the 
direct object of reaches). The complement latitudes is modified by the 
adjective temperate. The subordinate clause is introduced by the relative 
adverb when. [Then analyze the subordinate clause.] 
8. The polar bear, which lives in the Arctic regions when it is at 
home, sometimes reaches temperate latitudes. 
This is a complex sentence. The main clause is the polar bear some- 
times reaches temperate latitudes ; the subordinate clause is which lives in 
the Arctic regions when it is at home, which is complex, since it contains 
the adverbial clause when it is at home, modifying the verb lives.  
-P-A-G-E-208
190 ANALYSIS OF SENTENCES 
4. He says that the polar bear lives in the Arctic regions. 
This is a complex sentence. The main clause is he says; the subordinate 
clause is that the polar bear lives in the Arctic regions. The subject of the sen- 
tence is he, the complete predicate is says that the polar bear lives in the Arctic 
regions. The simple predicate is says, which is completed by its direct object, 
the noun clause that... regions, introduced by the conjunction that. [Then 
analyze the subordinate clause.] 
5. That the polar bear sometimes reaches temperate latitudes is a 
familiar fact. 
This is a complex sentence. The main clause (és a familiar fact) appears as 
a predicate only, since the subordinate clause (that the polar bear sometimes 
reaches temperate latitudes) is a noun clause used as the complete subject of 
the sentence. The simple predicate is is, which is completed by the predicate 
nominative fact. This complement is modified by the adjectives a and familiar. 
The subordinate clause, which is used as the complete subject, is introduced 
by the conjunction that. [Then analyze this clause.] 
COMPOUND COMPLEX SENTENCES 
461. In analyzing a compound complex sentence, we first 
divide it into the independent clauses (simple or complex) of 
which it consists, and then analyze each of these as if it 
were a sentence by itself. 
See the examples in §§ 456, 457.

MODIFIERS 191 
CHAPTER III 
MODIFIERS 
462. The various kinds of modifiers and complements have 
all been studied in preceding chapters, —each in connection 
with the construction which it illustrates. For purposes of 
analysis, however, it is necessary to consider modifiers as such 
and complements as such. 
The topics will be taken up in the following order : — (1) mod- 
ifiers, —of the subject, of the predicate; (2) complements ; 
(3) modifiers of complements ; (4) modifiers of modifiers. 
463. A word or group of words that changes or modifies the meaning 
of another word is called a modifier (§ 19).

harmlessly. The bullet passed eNO aoia haere: 
464. Modifiers may be attached not only to substantives 
and verbs, but also to adjectives and adverbs. 
All modifiers of substantives are called adjective modifiers ; all 
modifiers of verbs, adjectives, and adverbs are called adverbial 
modifiers.

      192 MODIFIERS 
Nor. The terms adjective modifier and adjective are not synonymous. All 
adjectives are adjective modifiers, but all adjective modifiers are not adjec- 
tives. Thus, in ‘“‘Henry’s skates are rusty,” the possessive noun Henry’s is 
an adjective modifier, since it limits the noun skates as an adjective might do. 
465. A group of words used as a modifier may be either a 
phrase or a clause ($§ 40-46). 
Able men 
Men of ability fen always find employment. 
Men who have ability 
thoughtlessly. 
I spoke {with thinking. 
before I thought. 
A phrase or a clause used as an adjective modifier is called an adjec- 
tive phrase or clause. 
A phrase or a clause used as an adverbial modifier is called an adverbial 
phrase or clause. 
Adjective and adverbial clauses are always subordinate, because 
they are used as parts of speech (§ 46). 
MODIFIERS OF THE SUBJECT 
ny substantive in the sentence may take an adjective 
i modifiers of the subject are particularly important. 
le subject may be modified by (1) an adjective, an 
ase, OF an adjective clause; (2) a participle; (3) an 
; (4) & possessive ; (5) an appositive. 
I, ADJECTIVES, ADJECTIVE PHRASES, ADJECTIVE CLAUSES 
467. The simple subject may be modified by an adjective, an 
adjective phrase, or an adjective clause.

Trinkets of ivory jas scattered about.

-P-A-G-E-211
  MODIFIERS OF THE SUBJECT 193 
In each of these groups of sentences, the subject of the first 
sentence is modified by an adjective, that of the second by an 
adjective phrase, that of the third by an adjective clause. 
Most adjective phrases are prepositional (§ 42), as in the 
examples. 
468. An adjective clause may be introduced by a relative pro- 
noun or a relative adverb. For lists, see § 377. 
I. ReLtativE Pronouns 
The architect who designed this church was a man of genius. 
The painter whom Ruskin oftenest mentions is Turner. 
A piece of amber which is rubbed briskly will attract bits of paper. 
The day that I dreaded came at last. 
The plain through which this river flows is marvelously fertile. 
The book from which I got this information is always regarded as

bronze eagle. 
The morning when I arrived in Rome is one of my pleasantest memories. 
The year after Ashton left home brought fresh disaster. 
The land whence Scyld drifted in his magic boat will never be known. 
Nore. A preposition and a relative ‘pronoun may often replace a relative 
adverb. Thus, in the second example, on which might be substituted for when.

Il. PARTICIPLES 
469. The subject may be modified by a participle (with or 
without modifier or complement). 
. Smiling, the child shook his head. 
. My aunt, reassured, took up her book again. 
. The prisoner sank back exhausted. 
. Exasperated beyond endurance, the captain cut the rope, 
John, obeying a sudden impulse, took to his heels. oP

6. Having broken one oar, Robert had to scull. 
1. The natives, fearing captivity above all things, leaped into the river. 
8. Albert left the room, looking rather sullen. 
In the fourth example the participle is modified by an adver- 
bial phrase; in the fitth and sixth, it has an object; in the 
seventh, it has both an object and a modifier; in the eighth, 
it is followed by the predicate adjective sullen. In analysis, 
the whole participial phrase (consisting of the participle and 
accompanying words) may be treated as an adjective phrase 
modifying the subject; but it is simpler to regard the par- 
ticiple as the modifier, and then to enumerate its modifiers, 
etc., separately. 
Thus, in the seventh example, the simple subject natives is modified by 
the participle fearing, which has for a complement captivity (the direct 
object) and is modified by the adverbial phrase above all things. 
Nore. A participle, though a modifier of the subject, has at the same time 
a peculiar relation to the predicate, because it may take the place of an adver- 
bial clause. Thus, in the seventh example, fearing is practically equivalent to 
the clause because they feared, which, if substituted for the participle, would 
of course modify the predicate verb leaped. This dual office of the participle 
comes from its twofold nature as (1) an adjective and (2) a verb. In analyzing, 
we treat the participle as an adjective modifier of the noun to which it be- 
longs; but its function as a substitute for an adverbial clause is an important 
means of securing variety in style. 
Il. INFINITIVES 
470. The subject may be modified by an infinitive. 
Eagerness to learn was young Lincoln’s strongest passion. 
Desire to travel made Taylor restless. 
‘The wish to succeed prompted him to do his best. 
Ability to write rapidly is a valuable accomplishment. 
Howard’s unwillingness to desert a friend cost him his life. 
In the fourth example, the infinitive has an adverbial modi- 
fier (rapidly) ; and in the fifth, it has a complement, its object 
(friend). In such instances, two methods of analysis are allow 
able, as in the case of participial phrases (§ 469).
-P-A-G-E-213
  
MODIFIERS OF THE SUBJECT 195 
IV. POSSESSIVES 
471. The subject may be modified by a substantive in the 
possessive case. 
Such a substantive may be called a possessive modifier. 
Napoleon’s tomb is in Paris. 
A man’s house is his castle. 
One’s taste in reading changes as one grows older. 
A moment’s thought would have saved me. 
The squirrel’s teeth grow rapidly. 
The Indians’ camp was near the river. 
His name is Alfred. 
Your carriage has arrived. 
In each of these examples, a substantive in the possessive 
case modifies the subject by limiting its meaning precisely as 
an adjective would do. 
Nors. An adjective phrase may often be substituted for a possessive. 
Thus, in the first example, instead of ‘‘NVapoleon’s tomb’’ one may say ‘the 
tomb of Napoleon” (§ 93). 
V. APPOSITIVES 
472. The subject may be modified by a substantive in appo- 
sition (§ 88, 5). 
Meredith the carpenter lives in that house. 
Herbert, our captain, has broken his leg. 
The idol of the Aztecs, a grotesque image, was thrown down by the 
Spaniards. 
Many books, both pamphlets and bound volumes, littered the table. 
[Here the subject (books) is modified by two appositives.] 
Appositives often have modifiers of their own. 
Thus carpenter is modified by the adjective the, captain by the pos- 
sessive our, image by the adjectives a and grotesque. 
In analyzing, the whole appositive phrase (consisting of the appositive and 
attached words) may be regarded as modifying the subject. It is as well, 
however, to treat the appositive as the modifier and then to enumerate the 
adjectives, etc., by which the appositive itself is modified.  
-P-A-G-E-214
196 MODIFIERS : 
473. A noun clause may be used as an appositive, and so 
may be an adjective modifier (§ 386). 
The question whether Antonio was a citizen was settled in the affirma- 
tive. [Here the italicized clause is used as a noun in apposition with 
question. ] 
The statement that water freezes seems absurd to a native of the torrid 
zone. [The clause that water freezes is in apposition with statement.] 
An adjective in the appositive position is often called an appositive adjective 
(§ 172). “A sword, keen and bright, flashed from the soldier’s scabbard.” 
MODIFIERS OF THE PREDICATE 
474. The simple predicate, being a verb or verb-phrase, can 
have only adverbial modifiers. 
The simple predicate may be modified by (1) an abverb, an 
adverbial phrase, or an adverbial clause, (2) an infinitive, (3) an 
adverbial objective, (4) a nominative absolute, (5) an indirect object, 
(6) a cognate object. 
I, ADVERB, ADVERBIAL PHRASE, ADVERBIAL CLAUSE 
475. The simple predicate may be modified by an adverb, 
an adverbial phrase, or an adverbial clause. 
( monthly. 
The landlord collects his rents4 on the first of every month. 
when the first of the month comes. 
there. 
The old schoolhouse rande{ at the cross-roads. 
where the roads meet. 
early. 
We left the rare the last speech. 
while the last speech was being delivered. 
In each of these groups, the simple predicate of the first 
sentence is modified by an adverb, that of the second by an 
adverbial phrase, and that of the third by an adverbial clause. 
Most adverbial phrases are prepositional (§ 42).

476. An adverbial clause that modifies a verb may be intro- 
duced by (1) a relative adverb, or (2) a subordinate conjunction. 
I. ReLatrve ADVERBS 
Our colonel was always found where the fighting was fiercest. 
When I give the signal, press the button.

The town lies at the base of a lofty cliff so that it is sheltered from the 
north wind. 
Il. INFINITIVE 
477. The simple predicate may be modified by an infinitive

The wind began to subside. 
Jack worked hard to fell the tree. 
Will did his best to win the prize. 
Kate began to weep bitterly. 
That draughtsman seems to be remarkably skilful. 
The infinitive may have a complement or a modifier, as in 
the last four examples. 
I. ADVERBIAL OBJECTIVE 
478. The simple predicate may be modified by an adverbial 
objective (§ 109). 
I have waited ages. 
We have walked miles. 
Arthur practised weeks, 
The addition of modifiers to the adverbial objective makes 
an adverbial phrase. 
Walter ran the entire distance. 
He stayed a whole day. 
I will forgive you this time. 
He came at me full tilt. 
The wind blew all night. 
Come with me a little way. 
In the first sentence, the adverbial phrase the entire distance 
modifies the verb ran as an adverb would do. This phrase 
consists of the noun distance with its adjective modifiers, the 
and entire. 
IV. NOMINATIVE ABSOLUTE 
479. The simple predicate may be modified by a nominative 
absolute (§ 345). 
A substantive in the absolute construction makes with its 
modifiers an adverbial phrase. 
The ship having arrived, we all embarked. 
We shall sail on Tuesday, weather permitting. 
That done, repair to Pompey’s theatre. 
The bridge across the chasm being only a single tree trunk, we hesitated 
to attempt the passage.
-P-A-G-E-217
MODIFIERS OF THE PREDICATE 199 
In the first sentence, the adverbial absolute phrase, the ship 
having arrived, is equivalent to the adverbial prepositional 
phrase, on the arrival of the ship, and defines the time of the 
- action expressed by the verb embarked. 
V. INDIRECT OBJECT 
480. The simple predicate may be modified by an indirect 
object (§ 105). 
He gave me a watch. [= He gave a watch to me.] 
Tom told me the whole story. [= Tom told the whole story to me.] 
In these sentences, the indirect object me, being equivalent 
to a prepositional phrase, is an adverbial modifier. 
The objective of service (§ 106) is also an adverbial modifier. 
VI. COGNATE OBJECT 
481. The simple predicate may be modified by a cognate object 
or by a phrase containing such an object (§ 108). 
The officer looked daggers at. me [= looked at me angrily]. 
The shepherd sang a merry song [= sang merrily]. 
The skipper laughed a scornful laugh [= laughed scornfully]. 
In the first sentence, the cognate object (daggers) modifies 
the predicate verb (Jooked) as the adverb angrily would do. 
It is therefore an adverbial modifier. In the second and third 
sentences the modifier of the predicate verb (sang, laughed) is 
an adverbial phrase consisting of a cognate object (song, laugh) 
with its adjective modifiers (a merry, a scornful).

  200 COMPLEMENTS 
CHAPTER IV 
COMPLEMENTS 
482. 1. Some verbs have a meaning that is complete in itself. 
Such a verb needs only a subject. When this has been sup- 
plied, we have a sentence, for the mere verb, without any 
additional word or words, is capable of being a predicate. 
Birds fly. The man scowled. 
Fishes swim. The girl laughed. 
The sun shines. The owls hooted, 
The moon rose. The clock ticked. 
Verbs of this kind are sometimes called complete verbs, or verbs 
of complete predication. 
2. Other verbs are not, by themselves, capable of serving as 
predicates. Thus, — 
The Indians killed ——. Tom is ——-. 
Mr. Harris makes —-. The man seemed ——. 
These are not sentences, for the predicate of each is unfin- 
ished. The verb requires the addition of a substantive or an 
adjective to complete its sense. 
The Indians killed deer. Tom is captain. 
Mr. Harris makes shoes. The man seemed sorry. 
Verbs of this kind are often called incomplete verbs, or verbs of 
incomplete predication. 
Norr. The meaning of the verb determines to which of these classes it 
belongs. Accordingly, the same verb may belong to the first class in some of 
its senses and to the second in others (§§ 212-215). 
483. A substantive or adjective added to the predicate verb to com- 
plete its meaning is called a complement. 
Complements are of four kinds,—the direct object, the predicate 
objective, the predicate nominative, and the predicate adjective.  
-P-A-G-E-219
    THE DIRECT OBJECT 201 
In the examples in § 482, deer and shoes are direct objects, 
—the former denoting the receiver of the action, the latter 
denoting the product; captain is a predicate nominative, denot- 
ing the same person as the subject Tom (§ 88,2); sorry is a 
predicate adjective describing the subject man. 
Complements may, of course, be modified. If they are sub- 
stantives, they may take adjective modifiers ; if adjectives, they 
may take adverbial modifiers ($§ 464, 494). 
484. For convenience, the definitions of the four kinds of 
complements are here repeated, with examples. 
1. THE DIRECT OBJECT‘ 
485. Some verbs may be followed by a substantive denoting that 
which receives the action or is produced by it. These are called tran- 
sitive verbs. All other verbs are called intransitive. 
A substantive that completes the meaning of a transitive verb is called 
its direct object (§ 100). 
The direct object is often called the object complement, or merely the object 
of the verb. 
Alfred has broken his arm. 
Morse invented the electric telegraph. 
Black foxes command a high price. 
You have accomplished a task of great difficulty. 
Have you lost the dog which your uncle gave you ? 
He asked me the news. [Two direct objects (§ 103).] 
Most of these objects are modified, — arm by the possessive 
his ; telegraph by the and electric ; price by a and high ; task 
by the adjective phrase of great difficulty ; dog by the and by 
the adjective clause which your uncle gave you. 
486. A noun clause may be used as the direct object of a 
verb (§ 386). 
You promised that my coat should be ready to-day. 
The mayor ordered that the street should be closed for three hours. 
I begged that my passport might be returned to me. 
For further examples, see §§ 407, 482, 439, 441.
-P-A-G-E-220
  202 COMPLEMENTS 
2, THE PREDICATE OBJECTIVE 
487. Verbs of choosing, calling, naming, making, and thinking may take 
two objects referring to the same person or thing. 
The first of these is the direct object, and the second, which completes 
the sense of the predicate, is called a predicate objective (§ 104). 
The predicate objective is often called the complementary object or the 
objective attribute. 
The people have elected Chamberlain governor. 
Peter calls Richard my shadow. 
The court has appointed you the child’s guardian. 
John thinks himself a hero. 
488. An adjective may serve as a predicate objective. Thus, — 
I thought your decision hasty 
I call that answer impertinent. 
The jury found the prisoner guilty. 
Your letter made him joyful. 
Care should be taken not to confuse adverbs with adjectives 
in -ly serving as predicate objectives. 
You called him sickly. [Adjective.] 
You called him early. [Adverb.] 
After the passive, a predicate objective becomes a predicate 
nominative (§ 489). 
3. THE PREDICATE NOMINATIVE 
489. A substantive standing in the predicate, but describing or defin- 
ing the subject, agrees with the subject in case and is called a predicate 
nominative (§ 88, 2). ‘ 
A predicate nominative is often called a subject complement or an attribute. 
The predicate nominative is common after is and other copula- 
tive verbs, and after certain transitive verbs in the passive voice. 
Chemistry is a useful science. 
Boston is the capital of Massachusetts. 
Jefferson became President.  
-P-A-G-E-221
  
THE PREDICATE NOMINATIVE 203 
This bird is called a flamingo. 
Mr. Hale was appointed secretary. 
Albert has been chosen captain of the crew. 
You are a friend upon whom I can rely. 
In most of the examples, the predicate nominative has one 
or more modifiers. In the first sentence, science is modified by 
the two adjectives a and useful ; in the second, capital is modi- 
fied by the adjective phrase of Massachusetts ; in the last, 
friend is modified by the adjective clause upon whom I can rely. 
For the distinction between the predicate nominative and the 
direct object, see § 102. 
490. A noun clause may be used as a predicate nominative 
(§ 386). My plan is that the well should be dug to-morrow. 
His intention was that you should remain here. 
The result is that he is bankrupt. 
Ruth’s fear was that the door might be locked. 
491. An infinitive may be used as a predicate nominative. 
To hear is to obey. 
My hope was to reach the summit before dark. 
Their plan was to undermine the tower. 
My habit is to rise early. 
The infinitive may have a complement or modifiers. In the 
second and third examples, it takes an object; in the fourth 
it is modified by an adverb. 
4, THE PREDICATE ADJECTIVE 
492. An adjective in the predicate belonging to a noun or pronoun in 
the subject is called a predicate adjective. : 
A predicate adjective completes the meaning of the predicate verb 
and is therefore a complement (§ 172, 3.) 
Like the predicate nominative, the predicate adjective is 
common after copulative verbs and after certain transitive 
verbs in the passive voice (§§ 172, 3; 252).

John was angry. 
My knife is growing dull. 
The task seemed very easy. 
The report proved false in every particular. 
The boat was thought unsafe. 
The cover was made perfectly tight. 
In some of these examples, the predicate adjective has a 
modifier. In the third, easy is modified by the adverb very ; 
in the fourth, false is modified by the adverbial phrase in every 
particular ; in the last, tight is modified by perfectly. 
493. An adjective phrase may be used as a predicate adjec- 
tive. Thus, — 
Richard was out of health. [Compare: Richard was ill.] 
Rachel seemed in a passion. [Compare : seemed angry.] 
This act is against my interests. [Compare : is harmful to me.] 
The adjective phrase may consist of an infinitive with or 
without the preposition about (§ 319).

MODIFIERS OF COMPLEMENTS AND OF MODIFIERS 
COMPLEMENTS: MODIFIED 
494. Complements, being either substantives or adjectives, 
may be modified in various ways, most of which have been noted 
in Chapter ITI. 
1. A substantive used as a complement may have the same 
kinds of modifiers that are used with the subject (§ 466). 
2. An adjective complement admits only adverbial modifiers. 
495. The following sentences illustrate the modifiers of 
substantive complements : —

the adjectives a and gold.] 
The duke built towers of marble. [The direct object (towers) is modified 
by the adjective phrase of marble.] 
My father built the house in which I was born. [The direct object 
(house) is modified by the adjective the and the adjective clause in which 
I was born.] 4 
I saw a man running across the field. [The direct object (man) is 
modified by the adjective a and the participle running.] 
You have forfeited your right to vote. [The direct object (right) is 
modified by the possessive pronoun your and the infinitive to vote.]

INDEPENDENT ELEMENTS 209 
CHAPTER VI 
INDEPENDENT ELEMENTS 
501. A word or group of words that has no grammatical connection 
with the sentence in which it stands is called an indépendent element. 
Independent elements are of four kinds, — interjections, vocatives (or 
nominatives by direct address), exclamatory nominatives, and paren- 
thetical expressions. 
Ah! why did I undertake this task ? 
Help arrived, alas! too late. 
You are a strange man, Arthur. 
Mary, come here! 
Poor Charles! I am sorry for him. 
Clothes! clothes! you are always wanting clothes. 
Lucky she! we are all envious of her prospects. 
The first two sentences contain interjections (§ 372) ; the 
second two, vocatives (or nominatives by direct address) 
(§88, 3); the last three, exclamatory nominatives (§ 88, 4). 
When the independent word has a modifier (as in the fifth 
and seventh examples), the whole phrase may be treated as 
an independent element. 
502. A word or group of words attached to or inserted in a sentence 
as a mere comment, without belonging either to the subject or the 
predicate, is said to be parenthetical. 
The market, indeed, was already closed. 
Peter, fo be sure, was not very trustworthy. 
The house, at all events, is safe. 
The road is, I admit, very hilly. 
Luttrell’s method, it must be confessed, was a little disappointing. 
Richard was not a bad fellow, after ail. 
503. In analysis, an independent element is mentioned by 
itself, and not as a part of the complete subject or the com- 
plete predicate.

210 COMBINATIONS OF CLAUSES 
CHAPTER VII 
COMBINATIONS OF CLAUSES 
504. The use of subordinate clauses as complements and 
modifiers, and as modifiers of complements and of modifiers, may 
produce sentences of great length and complicated structure. 
Such sentences, if skilfully composed, are not hard to follow. 
Their analysis requires merely the intelligent application of a 
few simple principles, which have already been explained and 
illustrated. 
505. These principles may be summed up as follows : — 
I. All clauses are either independent or subordinate. A clause 
is subordinate if it is used as a part of speech (noun, adjective, 
or adverb) ; otherwise, it is independent (§ 46). 
II. Coérdinate means “of the same rank” in the sentence 
(§ 46). 
1. Two or more independent clauses in the same sentence are 
manifestly coérdinate. 
The fire blazed and the wood crackled. [Two declarative clauses. ] 
_ What is your name, and where were you born? [Interrogative clauses.] 
Sit down and tell me your story. [Imperative clauses. ] 
2. Two or more subordinate clauses are codrdinate with each 
other when they are used together in the same construction, — 
as nouns, adjectives, or adverbs. 
Such a group may be regarded as forming one compound 
subordinate clause. 
The truth is, that I have no money and that my friends have forsaken 
me. [Noun clauses.] 
The Indians, who were armed with long lances, and who showed great 
skill in using them, made a furious attack on the cavalry. [Adjective 
clauses.] 
When he had spoken, but before a vote had been taken, a strange tumult 
was heard in the outer room, [Adverbial clauses.] 
 
-P-A-G-E-229
  COMBINATIONS OF CLAUSES 
    In the first example, we have a compound noun cla 
second, a compound adjective clause; in the third, 
adverbial clause. 
3. Coérdinate clauses are either joined by coérdinate con- 
junctions (and, or, but, ete.), or such conjunctions may be 
supplied without changing the sense (§ 362). 
The good-natured old gentleman, who was friendly to both parties, [AnD] 
who did not lack courage, anv who hated a quarrel, spoke his mind with 
complete frankness. 
III. A subordinate clause may depend on another subordi- 
nate clause. 
The horse shied when he saw the locomotive. [The subordinate clause 
depends upon the independent (main) clause.] 
The horse shied when he saw the locomotive, which was puffing vio- 
lently. [The second subordinate clause depends upon the first, being an 
adjective modifier of locomotive. ] 
In such cases, the whole group of subordinate clauses may 
be taken together as forming one complex subordinate clause. 
Thus, in the second example, when he saw the locomotive, which was 
puffing violently may be regarded as a complex adverbial clause modifyz,- ~ 
ing shied, and containing an adjective clause (which was puffing violently). 
506. From the principles summarized in § 505, it appears 
that — 
Clauses (like sentences) may be simple, compound, or complex. 
1. A simple clause contains but one subject and one predicate, 
either or both of which may be compound (§ 451). 
2. A compound clause consists of two or more coérdinate clauses 
(§ 454). 
3. A complex clause consists of at least two clauses, one of 
which is subordinate to the other. 
507. The unit in all combinations of clauses is clearly the 
simple sentence, which, when used as a part of a more com- 
plicated sentence, becomes a simple clause. 
 
-P-A-G-E-230
      
   COMBINATIONS OF CLAUSES 
The processes used in such combinations, as we have seen, 
are really but two in number, — coérdination and subordination. 
Coérdination of clauses produces compound sentences or compound 
clauses; subordination of one clause to another produces complex sen- 
tences or complex clauses. 
508. Every sentence, however long and complicated, belongs 
(in structure) to one of the three classes, — simple, compound, 
and complex. 
SIMPLE SENTENCES 
509. A simple sentence may have a compound subject or predi- 
cate (or both), and may also include a number of modifiers and 
complements. 
Obviously, then, a simple sentence need not be short. It 
remains simple in structure so long as it contains but one simple 
or compound subject and one simple or compound predicate. 
Thus, — 
1. You leave Glasgow in a steamboat, go down the Clyde fourteen 
miles, and then come to Dumbarton Castle, a huge rock five or six hun- 
dred feet high, not connected with any other high land, and with a 
fortress at the top. — WEBSTER. 
The length of this sentence is due partly to its compound predicate, partly 
to the modifier (and modifiers of the modifier) attached to the noun Dumbarton 
Castle. 
2. He was little disposed to exchange his lordly repose for the insecure 
and agitated life of a conspirator, to be in the power of accomplices, to 
live in constant dread of warrants and king’s messengers, nay, perhaps, 
to end his days on a scaffold, or to live on alms in some back street of 
the Hague. — Macauray. 
This sentence is lengthened by means of a series of infinitives used as 
adverbial modifiers of the complement disposed (a participle used as an adjec- 
tive). Each of these infinitives takes a complement or a modifier (or both). 
3. The arbitrary measures of Charles I, the bold schemes of Strafford, 
and the intolerant bigotry of Laud, precipitated a collision between the 
opposite principles of government, and divided the whole country into 
Cavaliers and Roundheads. — May.
-P-A-G-E-231
  
COMPOUND SUBJECT AND PREDICATE 213 
Both the subject and the predicate are compound. Each of the three nouns 
in the compound subject has modifiers. The two verbs in the compound 
predicate have each a complement, and the second has an adverbial modifier 
(a phrase). 
4. Twenty of the savages now got on board and proceeded to ramble 
over every part of the deck and scramble about among the rigging, mak- 
ing themselves much at home and examining every article with great 
inquisitiveness. — Por. 
The predicate is compound. The sentence is extended by the use of parti- 
ciples (making and examining), which modify the simple subject twenty. 
5. She was tumbled early, by accident or design, into a spacious 
closet of good old English reading, without much selection or prohibi- 
tion, and browsed at will upon that fair and wholesome pasturage. — 
Lams. 
6. The mermaid was still seen to glide along the waters, and mingling 
her voice with the sighing breeze, was often heard to sing of subterranean 
wonders, or to chant prophecies of future events. — Scorr. 
7. With early dawn, they were under arms, and, without waiting for 
the movement of the Spaniards, poured into the city and attacked them 
in their own quarters. — Prescorr. 
8. Arming a desperate troop of slaves and gladiators, he overpowered 
the feeble guard of the domestic tranquillity of Rome, received the homage 
of the Senate, and, assuming the title of Augustus, precariously reigned 
during a tumult of twenty-eight days. — Grspon. 
Nore. A simple sentence with compound predicate often differs very slightly 
from a compound sentence. Thus in examples 4-7 the insertion of a single pro- 
noun (they, she) to serve asa subject for the second verb (proceeded, browsed, 
etc.) will make the sentence compound. 
COMPOUND AND COMPLEX SENTENCES 
510. Every sentence that is not simple must be either 
compound or complex. 
A sentence is compound if it consists of two or more independ- 
ent clauses; complex, if it consists of one independent (main) 
clause and one or more subordinate clauses. 
511. An ordinary compound sentence consists of two or more 
codrdinate simple clauses, 
 
-P-A-G-E-232
  214 COMBINATIONS OF CLAUSES 
Such a sentence may be of great length (as in the last ex- 
ample below), but its structure is usually transparent. 
A cricket chirps on the hearth, | and | we are reminded of Christmas 
gambols long ago. — Hazuirv. 
The moments were numbered ; | the strife was finished ; | the vision 
was closed. — Dr Quincey. 
The old king had retired to his couch that night in one of the strong- 
est towers of the Alhambra, | but | his restless anxiety kept him from

The clock has just struck two ; | the expiring taper rises and sinks in 
the socket ; | the watchman forgets his hour in slumber ; | the laborious and 
the happy are at rest ; | and | nothing wakes but meditation, guilt, revelry, 
and despair. — GoipsmirH. 
The present, indeed, is not a contest for distant or contingent objects ; 
| it is not a contest for acquisition of territory ; | it is not a contest for 
power and glory ; | as little is it carried on merely for any commercial 
advantage, or any particular form of government ; | but | it is a contest 
for the security, the tranquillity, and the very existence of Great Britain, 
connected with that of every established government and every country 
in Europe. — Pirr. 
512. A complex sentence, in its most elementary form, con- 
sists of one simple independent (main) clause and one simple 
subordinate clause. 
The gas exploded when I struck a match. 
Though he is idle, he is not lazy. 
The carpenter who fell from the roof has recovered from his injuries. 
Their eyes were so fatigued with the eternal dazzle and whiteness, 
that they lay down on their backs upon deck to relieve their sight on 
the blue sky. — Krars. 
The shouts of thousands, their menacing gestures, the fierce clashing 
of their arms, astonished and subdued the courage of Vetranio, who 
stood, amidst the defection of his followers, in anxious and silent 
suspense. — GIBBON. 
518. Both compound sentences and complex sentences ad- 
mit of much variety in structure, according to the nature and 
the relations of the clauses that compose them.  
-P-A-G-E-233
  
COMPOUND COMPLEX SENTENCES 215 
COMPOUND COMPLEX SENTENCES 
514. Any or all of the codrdinate clauses that make up a compound 
sentence may be complex. In that case, the sentence is called a compound 
complex sentence. 
Nors. Compound complex sentences form a special class or subdivision 
under the general head of compound sentences.! 
Old Uncle Venner was just coming out of his door, with a wood-horse 
and saw on his shoulder ; and, trudging along the street, he scrupled not 
to keep company with Phoebe, so far as their paths lay together ; nor, in 
spite of his patched coat and rusty beaver, and the curious fashion of his 
tow-cloth trousers, could she find it in her heart to outwalk him. 
HAwrHorne. 
This sentence consists of three coérdinate clauses, each independent of the 
others. These are joined by the codrdinate conjunctions and, nor. The first 
and the third clause are simple, but the second clause is complex. Hence the 
whole forms one compound complex sentence. 
The complex clause consists of two clauses, the second of which is subor- 
dinate to the first. Taken as a whole, however, this complex clause is mani- 
festly coérdinate with the two simple clauses, since the three form a series 
joined by codrdinate conjunctions. 
515. Further examples of compound complex sentences are : — 
1. The people drove out King Athamas, because he had killed his 
child; and he roamed about in his misery, till he came to the Oracle 
in Delphi. — Kinesiery. 
2. Society is the stage on which manners are shown ; novels are their 
literature. —EmErson. 
3. We keep no bees, but if I lived in a hive I should scarcely have 
more of their music. — CowPER. 
4. The same river ran on as it had run on before, but the cheerful faces 
that had once been reflected in its stream had passed away. — FroupE. 
5. There are some laws and customs in this empire very peculiar ; and 
if they were not so directly contrary to those of my own dear country, 
I should be tempted to say a little in their justification. —Swirr. 
6. Here they arrived about noon, and Joseph proposed to Adams that. 
they should rest awhile in this delightful place. — Fie.pine. 
7. I never saw a busier person than she seemed to be; yet it was 
difficult to say what she did.—C. Bronri. 
1Instead of compound complex, the term complex compound is often used. 
‘The terms are synonymous, both meaning ‘‘ compound in general structure, 
but complex in one or more members.”

8. Malaga possessed a brave and numerous garrison, and the com- 
mon people were active, hardy, and resolute; but the city was rich 
and commercial, and under the habitual control of opulent merchants, 
who dreaded the ruinous consequences of a siege. — Irvine. 
9. The Spaniards were not to be taken by surprise ; and, before the 
barbarian horde had come within their lines, they opened such a deadly 
fire from their heavy guns, supported by the musketry and crossbows, 
that the assailants were compelled to fall back slowly, but fearfully 
mangled, to their former position. —Prescorr. 
10. Her cheeks were as pale as marble, but of a cold, cinhealshy ashen 
white ; and my heart ached to think that they had been bleached, most, 
probably, by bitter and continual tears. — Hoop. 
11. The hawk, having in spiral motion achieved the upper flight, fell 
like a thunderbolt on the raven, stunned him with the blow, clutched him 
in his talons, folded him in his wings, and, the hawk undermost, they 
tumbled down like a black ball, till within a short distance from the 
earth. — TRELAWNY. 
In this sentence they were is understood after till. 
VARIETIES OF THE COMPLEX SENTENCE 
516. A complex sentence may be expanded either by com- 
pounding the main clause, or by increasing the number of sub- 
ordinate clauses. Both methods may be used in the same 
sentence. 
517. The independent (main) clause of a complex sentence may be 
compound. 
When they saw the ship, they shouted for joy and some of them burst 
into tears. 
As they turned down from the knoll to rejoin their comrades, the sun 
dipped and disappeared, and the woods fell instantly into the gravity and 
qrayness of the early night. — Stevenson. 
The eye of the young monarch kindled and his dark cheek flushed with 
sudden anger, as he listened to proposals so humiliating. — Prescorr. 
Sharpe was so hated in Scotland during his life, and his death won him

without prejudice or favor. — A. Lane. 
As has been the case with many another good fellow of his nation, his 
life was tracked and his substance wasted by crowds of hungry beggars and 
lazy dependents, — THACKERAY,
-P-A-G-E-235
  VARIETIES OF THE COMPLEX SENTENCE 217 
Note that the subordinate clause depends on the compound 
main clause, not upon either of its members. 
Thus, in the first example, the subordinate clause (when they saw the 
ship) depends upon the compound main clause, they shouted for joy and 
some of them burst into tears. It is an adverbial modifier of both shouted 
and burst. 
518. Though a complex sentence can have but one (simple 
or compound) main clause, there is, in theory, no limit to the 
number of subordinate clauses. 
519. Subordinate clauses may be attached to the main clause 
(1) as separate modifiers or complements ; (2) in a codrdinate series 
of clauses, all in the same construction, and forming one com- 
pound clause; (3) in a series of successively subordinate clauses, 
forming one complex clause. 
520. Two or more subordinate clauses may be attached to the main 
clause separately, each as a distinct modifier or complement. 
The bridge, which had been weakened by the ice, fell with a crash while 
the locomotive was crossing it. [The first subordinate clause is an adjective 
modifier of bridge ; the second is an adverbial modifier of fell.] 
The architect who drew the plans says that the house will cost ten thou- 
sand dollars. [The first subordinate clause is an adjective modifier of 
architect ; the second is a complement, being the object of says.]

clauses are joined to make one compound clause, which is used 
as a complement, —as a predicate nominative in the first sen- 
tence, as the direct object of told in the second. 
In the third example, a’ compound adjective clause modifies 
Filis. In the fourth and fifth, a compound adverbial clause 
modifies the predicate verb (ordered, received). In the seventh, 
four that-clauses unite in one compound clause. 
522. Two or more successively subordinate clauses, forming one 
complex clause, may be joined to the main clause as a modifier or 
complement. 
In such a series, the first subordinate clause is attached di- 
rectly to the main clause, the second is subordinate to the first, 
the third to the second, and so on in succession. 
In the course of my travels, I met a good-natured old gentleman, 
(a) who was born in the village (b) where my parents lived (c) before they 
came to America. 
 
-P-A-G-E-237
VARIETIES OF THE COMPLEX SENTENCE 219 
Here gentleman (a complement in the main clause) is modi- 
fied by the adjective clause who was born in the village (a). 
Village, in clause a, is modified by the adjective clause where 
my parents lived (b). Lived, the predicate verb of clause 6, is 
modified by the adverbial clause before they came to America (c). 
Thus it appears that a is subordinate to the main clause, and 
that }, in turn, is subordinate to a, and ¢ to 6. In other words, 
the three clauses (a, b, c) are united to make one complex clause, 
—who was born in the village where my parents lived before they 
came to America. This clause, taken as a whole, serves as an 
adjective modifier describing gentleman. 
523. Further examples of the successive subordination of one 
clause to another may be seen in the following sentences : — 
I have passed my latter years in this city, where I am frequently seen 
in public places, though there are not above half-a-dozen of my select friends 
that know me. — AppIson. 
In this manner they advanced by moonlight till they came within view 
of the two towering rocks that form a kind of portal to the valley, at the ex- 
tremity of which rose the vast ruins of Istakar. —Brckrorp. 
The young fellow uttered this with an accent and a look so perfectly 
in tune to a feeling heart, that I instantly made a vow I would give him a 
Sour-and-twenty sous piece, when I got to Marseilles. — Sterne. [The con- 
junction that is omitted before I would (§ 388).] 
Three years had scarcely elapsed before the sons of Constantine seemed 
impatient to convince mankind that they were incapable of contenting them- 
selves with the dominions which they were unqualified to govern. — GIBBON. 
Mr. Lewis sent me an account of Dr. Arbuthnot’s illness, which is a 
very sensible affliction to me, who, by living so long out of the world, have lost 
that hardness of heart contracted by years and general conversation. — Swirt. 
Nore. The method of forming complex clauses by successive subordination, 
if overworked, produces long, straggling, shapeless sentences, as in the follow- 
ing example from Borrow:— ‘tI scouted the idea that Slingsby would have 
stolen this blacksmith’s gear ; forI had the highest opinion of his honesty, 
which opinion I still retain at the present day, which is upwards of twenty 
years from the time of which lam speaking, during the whole of which period 
I have neither seen the poor fellow nor received any intelligence of him.” A 
famous instance of the use of this structure for comic effect is ‘‘ The House 
that Jack Built.”

SPECIAL COMPLICATIONS 
524. The processes of codrdination and subordination (§§ 514— 
523) may be so utilized in one and the same sentence as to 
produce a very complicated structure. 
Examples of such sentences are given below, for reference 
(§§ 525-526). Their structure, however elaborate, is always 
either complex or compound complex. 
I. IN COMPLEX SENTENCES 
525. The following sentences are complex. They contain 
either compound or complex clauses, or both. 
1. They preferred the silver with which they were familiar, and 
which they were constantly passing about from hand to hand, to the 
gold which they had never before seen, and with the value of which they 
were unacquainted. — Macautay. 
The main clause of this complex sentence is they preferred the silver to the 
gold. To this are separately attached (§ 520) two adjective clauses, both com- 
pound; (1) with which ...hand, modifying silver ; (2) which they had .. . unac- 
quainted, modifying gold. 
2. All London crowded to shout and laugh round the gibbet where 
hung the rotting remains of a prince who had made England the dread 
of the world, who had been the chief founder of her maritime greatness 
and of her colonial empire, who had conquered Scotland and Ireland, 
who had humbled Holland and Spain. —Macautay. 
The sentence is complex. The main clause is all London crowded to shout 
and laugh round the gibbet. The rest of the sentence (where .. . Spain) forms 
one long complex adjective clause, modifying gibbet. In this complex clause, 
the first clause (where . . . prince) has dependent on it a compound adjective 
clause (modifying prince), made up of four codrdinate clauses, each beginning 
with who. The subordination of this compound clause to that which precedes 
(where . . . prince) produces the long complex subordinate clause where... 
Spain. 
3. As we cannot at present get Mr. Joseph out-of the inn, we shall 
leave him in it, and carry our reader on after Parson Adams, who, his 
mind being perfectly at ease, fell into a contemplation on a passage in 
schylus, which entertained him for three miles together, without suffer- 
ing him once to reflect on his fellow-traveller. — Fre.p1nc.
-P-A-G-E-239
  COMPLEX SENTENCES 221 
In this complex sentence, two subordinate clauses are separately attached 
to the main clause: (1) the adverbial clause as... inn; (2) the adjective 
clause who... fellow-traveller. This latter clause is complex, since it con- 
tains the adjective clause which... fellow-traveller, dependent on who... 
dischylus, and modifying passage. 
4, AsI sit by my window this summer afternoon, hawks are circling 
about my clearing ; the tantivy of wild pigeons, flying by twos and threes 
athwart my view, or perching restlessly on the white pine boughs behind 
my house, gives a voice to the air; a fishhawk dimples the glassy surface 
of the pond and brings up a fish ; a mink steals out of the marsh before 
my door and seizes a frog by the shore; the sedge is bending under the 
weight of the reed-birds flitting hither and hither ; and for the last half 
hour I have heard the rattle of railroad cars, now dying away and then 
reviving like the beat of a partridge, conveying travellers from Boston to 
the country. —THorEAv. 
This sentence is complex. Its main clause is compound, consisting of a series 
‘of six codrdinate simple clauses. The whole of this long compound main clause 
is modified by the adverbial clause with which the sentence begins (as... 
afternoon). 
5, That they had sprung from obscurity, that they had acquired great 
wealth, that they exhibited it insolently, that they spent it extravagantly, 
that they raised the price of everything in their neighborhood, from fresh 
eggs to rotten boroughs ; that their liveries outshone those of dukes, that 
their coaches were finer than that of the Lord Mayor, that the examples 
of their large and ill-governed households corrupted half the servants in 
the country ; that some of them, with all their magnificence, could not 
catch the tone of good society, but in spite of the stud and the crowd of 
menials, of the plate and the Dresden china, of the venison and the 
Burgundy, were still low men, —these were things which excited, both 
in the class from which they had sprung, and in that into which they 
attempted to force themselves, that bitter aversion which is the effect of 
mingled envy and contempt. — Macauray. 
This complex sentence, though very long, is perfectly easy to follow. It 
begins with a long compound noun clause (consisting of nine codrdinate that- 
clauses). This would be the subject of the main predicate verb were, but for 
the fact that the pronoun ‘hese is inserted to act as the subject (referring back 
tothe compound noun clause and summing it up in a single word). To the 
complement things is attached the adjective clause which excited . . . contempt. 
This clause is complex, for it contains three adjective clauses, (1) from which 
they had sprung (modifying class), (2) into which . . . themselves (modifying 
that), and (3) which is .. . contempt (modifying aversion). All three are sepa- 
rately attached to the clause on which they depend, which excited that bitter 
aversion. Thus all that portion of the sentence which follows things forms 
one complex clause, modifying that noun.

6. That I may avoid the imputation of throwing out, even privately, 
any loose, random imputations against the public conduct of a gentleman 
for whom I once entertained a very warm affection, and whose abilities 
Iregard with the greatest admiration, I will put down, distinctly and 
articulately, some of the matters of objection which I feel to his late 
doctrines and proceedings, trusting that I shall be able to demonstrate 
to the friends whose good opinion I would still cultivate, that not levity, 
nor caprice, nor less defensible motives, but that very grave reasons, 
influence my judgment. — Burke. 
This is a fine example of a long, but well-constructed complex sentence. 
The main clause is J will put down, distinctly and articulately, some of the 
matters of objection. Upon this simple clause, everything else in the sentence 
depends in one way or another. 
Il. IN COMPOUND COMPLEX SENTENCES 
526. Any complex sentence, however elaborate, may be 
used as one of the codrdinate complex clauses that make up a 
compound complex sentence. 
1, While the king was treated at this rude rate, Cromwell, with his 
army, was in Scotland, obstructing the motions that were making in his 
favor; but on the approach of the Scots, who were much superior in 
number, he was forced to retire towards Dunbar, where his ships and 
provisions lay. — Burner. 
In this compound complex sentence, both codrdinate clauses are complex. In 
each, the main clause has two subordinate clauses attached to it separately 
(§ 520). 
2. They had seen me cut the cables, and thought my design was only 
to let the ships run adrift, or fall foul on each other; but when they 
perceived the whole fleet moving in order, and saw me pulling at the 
end, they set up such a scream of grief and despair as it is almost im- 
possible to describe or conceive. — Swirr. 
In this compound complex sentence, both of the two codrdinate clauses are 
complex. The first contains the noun clause [that] my design . . . each other, 
used as the object of thought. The second contains two subordinate clauses, 
separately attached to the main clause (they set . .. despair). For the infinitive 
eut, see § 322. The infinitive ¢o let is used as a predicate nominative (§ 491) ; 
it has as its object the infinitive clause the ships... each other, containing 
two infinitives, run and fall (§ 325). 
3. While things went on quietly, while there was no opposition, while 
everything was given by the favor of a small ruling junto, Fox had a  
-P-A-G-E-241
  COMPOUND COMPLEX SENTENCES 223 
decided advantage over Pitt; but when dangerous times came, when 
Europe was convulsed with war, when Parliament was broken up into 
factions, when the public mind was violently excited, the favorite of the 
people rose to supreme power. — Macautay. 
This compound complex sentence consists of two complex clauses, joined by 
the codrdinate conjunction but. In each of these, the subordinate clause is 
compound (§ 521), consisting of several codrdinate adverbial clauses intro- 
duced by relative adverbs (while in the first, when in the second). 
4. The clear and agreeable language of his despatches had early 
attracted the notice of his employers; and before the Peace of Breda 
he had, at the request of Arlington, published a pamphlet on the war, of 
which nothing is now known, except that it had some vogue at the time, 
and that Charles, not a contemptible judge, pronounced it to be very 
well written. — Macautay. 
In this compound complex sentence, the first codrdinate clause is simple, the 
second is complex. In the second, the adjective clause of which nothing is 
known has dependent on it the group of words except . . . well written, con- 
sisting of the preposition except and its object (the compound noun clause, 
that. . . time, and that . . . well written). This group serves as an adjec- 
tive modifier of the noun nothing. The whole passage of which... well 
written forms a complex adjective clause, modifying pamphlet. It to be very 
well written is a complement, being an infinitive clause used as the object of 
pronounced (§ 325).

224 ELLIPTICAL SENTENCES 
CHAPTER VIII 
ELLIPTICAL SENTENCES 
527. Good usage does not demand that all sentences shall 
be absolutely complete. It often allows (and sometimes re- 
quires) the omission of words that, though necessary to the 
construction, are so easily supplied by the mind that it would 
be mere waste of time to utter them. 
528. The omission of a word or words necessary to the grammatical 
completeness of a clause or sentence is called ellipsis. 
A clause or sentence that shows ellipsis is said to be elliptical. 
Ellipsis is a Greek word meaning ‘‘ omission.” 
In the following examples the omitted words are supplied 
in brackets. 
[I] thank you. 
[I] pray do not [you] move. 
[You] pass me that book. 
’ Her hair is light, her eyes [are] dark blue. 
Some of the strangers spoke French, others [spoke] Spanish. 
Some of the patriots were armed with old fiintlocks, others [were 
armed] with swords, still others [were armed] with pitchforks. 
When [he was] a youth, he travelled in the East. 
Though [he is] timid, he is no coward. 
They were amused, though [they were] somewhat vexed. 
While [we were] drifting downstream, we grounded on a sand bar. 
If [it is] possible, send me word to-night. 
You shall have the money this week, if [it is] necessary. 
They marched slowly as if [they were] worn out. 
Why [are] these tears ? 
Why [are you] so dejected ? 
He was ten years of age, his brother [was] eight [years of age]. 
I have more confidence in James than [I have] in Edmund. 
Mary is younger than George [is young]. 
Tom likes you better than [he likes] me. 
You like him better than I do [like him]. 
   
-P-A-G-E-243
  ELLIPTICAL SENTENCES 225 
I like him better than Charles does [like him]. 
This racket is not so heavy as that [is heavy]. 
You are not so old as I [am old]. 
Peace [be] to his memory ! 
This is the only pencil [that] I have. 
Is that the boy [whom] you hired yesterday ? 
They say [that] you are going to Europe soon. 
529. The examples in § 528 show that most cases of ellipsis 
fail under two heads: 
1. To avoid repetition, words are often omitted in one part 
of the sentence when they occur in another part. 
2. Pronouns, the conjunction ¢hat, and some forms of the 
yerb is, are often omitted when they are readily supplied. 
Under the second head come (1) the ellipsis of the subject 
(thou or you) in imperative sentences (§ 268), (2) that of rela- 
tive pronouns in the objective case (§ 151), (8) that of is, are, 
etc. (with the subject pronoun) in subordinate clauses intro- 
duced by when, though, if, and the like (§§ 397, 399, 417). 
Norte. The so-called “telegraphic style’? omits J with any verb or with 
allverbs. It should be confined to telegrams, where space is money. 
530. Adverbs indicating direction (like forward, back) are 
often used without a verb in imperative sentences. 
Forward, brave companions ! 
Down on your knees ! 
Up, guards, and at them ! 
Nore. In older English, the omission of the verb of motion was common, 
even in sentences not imperative, as in the following examples from Julius 
Cesar: —‘* We’ll along ourselves, and meet them”; ‘Shall we on, and not 
depend on you?” 
531. The ellipsis of the subordinate conjunction that is very 
common, especially in indirect discourse (§§ 388, 433). 
I know [that] you are my friend. 
Jack said [that] the boat had sunk, 
He told me [that] he was sorry. 
 
-P-A-G-E-244
  226 ELLIPTICAL SENTENCES 
532. Many constructions, originally elliptical, have become 
established idioms in which no ellipsis is felt. In such cases 
it is usually better to take the sentence as it stands, and not 
to supply the omitted words. . 
Thus, in ‘tHe eats as if he were famished” the italicized words are 
properly treated as a subordinate clause modifying eats and introduced 
by the compound conjunction as jf. Yet in strictness this construction is 
an ellipsis for ‘‘ He eats as [he would eat] if he were famished.”’ 
533. Various ellipses are illustrated in the following sen- 
tences : — : 
1, Although in a friendly country, they marched always as if in a 
land of enemies. 
2. The aspect of the country was as wild and dreary as the climate. 
3. Do not serious and earnest men discuss Hamlet as they would 
Cromwell or Lincoln ?— Lowe tr. 
4, Not so with the others. 
5. Though rather shy and distrustful of this new acquaintance, Rip 
complied with his usual alacrity. 
6. Arras was famed for its rich tapestries, Brussels for its carpets, 
Cambrai for its fine cambric, Lisle for its thread and the fabrics woven 
from it. 
7. Every day brings its task, which, if neglected, is doubled on the 
morrow. 
8. It is not easy to recover an art when once lost. 
9. I wish you would go down with me to Newstead. 
10. The men are all soldiers, and war and the chase their sole 
occupation. 
11. While in this state of irresolution, she was startled by a low knock. 
12. The house was tall, the skylight small and dirty, the day blind 
with fog. 
13. I little thought you would have deserted me. 
14. He is the best Oriental scholar I know. 
15. Cromwell was evidently laying, though in an irregular manner, 
the foundations of an admirable system. 
16. He was a foot taller than I. 
17. This concerns you rather than me. 
18. My father loved Sir Rowland as his soul.

APPENDIX 
LISTS OF VERBS 
In the first list, only such verb forms are given as are indis- 
putably correct in accordance with the best prose usage of the 
present day. The pupil may feel perfectly safe, therefore, in 
using the forms registered in this list.’ 
A few verbs (marked *) which are seldom or never used in ordinary 
language are included in this list. These have various irregularities. 
A few verbs are partly strong and partly weak. 
Weak verbs are printed in italics. 
For the modal auxiliaries, see page 299.

1 The omission of a form from the list, then, does not necessarily indicate 
that it is wrong or even objectionable. There is considerable diversity of usage 
with regard to the strong verbs, and to state thé facts at length would take 
much space. An attempt to include archaic, poetical, and rare forms in the 
same list with the usual modern forms is sure to mislead the pupil. Hence the 
list here presented is confined to forms about whose correctness there can be 
no difference of opinion. Archaic and poetical tense-forms are treated later 
(pp. 297-299). 
2 Born is used only in thé passive sense of ‘t born into the world.”

2 Hanged is used only of execution by hanging. 
8 Usage varies with the context. We say, ‘‘ The crew hove the cargo over-

Bear, break, drive, get (beget, forget), speak, spin, stink, swear, tear, have 
an archaic past tense in a: bare, brake, drave, gat, spake, etc. 
Beat, beget (forget), bite, break, forsake, hide, ride, shake, speak, weave, 
write, and some other verbs have archaic forms of the past participle like 
those of the past tense. The participles in en, however, are now the ac- 
cepted forms. Chid and trod are common participial forms. 
Begin, drink, ring, shrink, sing, sink, spring, swim, often have in poetry a 
u-form (begun, sung, etc.) in the past tense as well as in the past participle. 
This form (though good old English)! should be avoided in modern speech. 
Bend, beseech, bet, build, burst, catch, dwell, rend, split, wet, have archaic 
or less usual forms in ed: bended, beseeched, betted, etc. Builded is common 
in the proverbial ** He builded better than he knew.” Bursted is common 
as an adjective: ‘a bursted bubble.”’ 
Bid, ‘* to command,”’ has sometimes bid in both the past tense and the 
past participle ; bid, ‘* to offer money,” has these forms regularly. 
Blend, leap, lean, have usually blended, leaped, leaned ; but blent, leapt, 
leant are not: uncommon. 
Clothe has commonly clothed ; but clad is common in literary use, and 
is regular in the adjectives well-clad, ill-clad (for which ordinary speech 
has substituted well-dressed, badly or poorly dressed). 
1 It is a remnant of the old past plural. In Anglo-Saxon the principal parts 
of begin were: present, beginne; past, began; past plural, begunnon; past 
participle, begunnen.
-P-A-G-E-316
  298 APPENDIX 
Dive has dived ; but dove (an old form) is common in America. 
* Plead has past tense and past participle pleaded. Plead (pronounced pléd) 
is avoided by careful writers and speakers. 
Prove has past tense and past participle proved. The past participle proven 
should be avoided. ¢ 
Work has past tense and past participle worked. Wrought in the past tense 
and the past participle is archaic, but is also modern as an adjective (as in 
wrought iron). 
Some verbs have rare or archaic weak forms alongside of the strong forms; 
thus digged, shined, past tense and past participle of dig, shine ; showed, past 
participle of show. 
Ate and eaten are preferred to eat (pronounced 2f). 
Quoth, “said,” is an old strong past tense. The compound bequeath has 
bequeathed only. 
Miscellaneous archaisms are the past tenses sate for sat, trode for trod, spat 
for spit; also writ for wrote and written, rid for rode and ridden, strewed and 
strown for strewn. 
II 
The following verbs vary between ed and ¢ (d) in the past 
tense and the past participle. In some of them, this variation 
is a mere difference of spelling. In writing, the ed forms are pre- 
ferred in most cases; in speaking, the ¢ forms are very common. 
bless blessed, blest? 
burn burned, burnt? 
curse cursed, curst + 
dare dared (less commonly, durst)

IV 
The present tense of may, can, shall, is an old strong past. Hence 
the first and third persons singular are alike: — J may, he may. The 
actual past tenses of these verbs are weak forms :— might, could, 
should. Must is the weak past tense of an obsolete mot, and is almost 
always used as a present tense (§ 292). 
Dare and owe originally belonged to this class. Owe has become 
a regular weak verb, except for the peculiar past tense ought, which 
is used in a present sense (see § 298); dare has in the third person 
dare or dares, and in the past dared, more rarely durst. The archaic 
wot “know,” past wist, also belongs to this class. Wéll is inflected 
like shall, having will in the first and third singular, wilt in the second 
singular, and would in the past. 
1 Both forms are in good use.

USE OF CAPITAL LETTERS 305 
USE OF CAPITAL LETTERS 
1. Every sentence begins with a capital letter. 
2. Every line of poetry begins with a capital letter. 
3. The first word of every direct quotation begins with a capital 
letter. 
Nor. This rule does not apply to quoted fragments of sentences. 
4. Every proper noun or abbreviation of a proper noun begins 
with a capital letter. 
5. Most adjectives derived from proper nouns begin with capital 
letters; as, — American, Indian, Swedish, Spenserian. 
Norr. Some adjectives derived from proper nouns have ceased to be 
closely associated in thought with the nouns from which they come, and 
therefore begin with small letters. Thus,— voltaic, galvanic, mesmeric, 
maudlin, stentorian. 
6. Every title attached to the name of a person begins with a 
capital letter. 
Mr. Thomas Smith C. J. Adams, M.D. 
John Wilson, Esq. President Grant 
Miss Allerton Professor Whitney 
Dr. F. E. Wilson Sir Walter Raleigh 
7. In titles of books, etc., the first word, as well as every impor- 
tant word that follows, begins with a capital letter. 
8. The interjection O and the pronoun J are always written in 
capital letters. 
9. Personal pronouns referring to the Deity are often capitalized. 
Nore. Usage varies: the personal pronouns are commonly capitalized 
when they refer to the Deity, the relatives less frequently. The rule is often 
disregarded altogether when its observance would result in a multitude of 
capitals, as in the Bible and in many hymn books and works of theology. 
10. Common nouns and adjectives often begin with capital letters 
when they designate the topics or main points of definitions or simi- 
lar statements. Such capitals are called emphatic (or topical) capitals. 
Norr. Emphatic (or topical) capitals are analogous to capitals in the 
titles of books (see Rule 7), but their use is not obligatory. They are especially 
common in text-books and other elementary manuals.

RULES OF PUNCTUATION?! 
The common marks of punctuation are the period, the interro- 
gation point, the exclamation point, the comma, the semicolon, 
the colon, the dash, marks of parenthesis, and quotation marks. 
The hyphen and the apostrophe may be conveniently treated 
along with marks of punctuation. 
I 
1. The period, the interrogation point, and the exclamation point 
are used at the end of sentences. Every complete sentence must be 
followed by one of these three marks. 
The end of a declarative or an imperative sentence is marked by 
a period. But a declarative or an imperative sentence that is like- 
wise exclamatory may be followed by an exclamation point instead 
of a period. 
The end of a direct question is marked by an interrogation point. 
An exclamatory sentence in the form of an indirect question is fol. 
lowed by an exclamation point ; as, — “ How absolute the knave is!” 
2. A period is used after an abbreviation. 
3. An exclamation point is used after an exclamatory word or 
phrase. 
Nore. This rule is not absolute. Most interjections take the exclamation 
point. With other words and with phrases, usage differs; if strong feeling is 
expressed, the exclamation point is commonly used, but too many such marks 
deface the page. 
I 
The comma is used — 
1. After a noun (or a phrase) of direct address (a vocative nomina- 
tive). Thus, — 
John, tell me the truth. 
Little boy, what is your name? 
Nore. If the noun is exclamatory, an exclamation point may be used 
instead of a comma. 
1 The main rules of punctuation are well fixed and depend on important 
distinctions in sentence structure and consequently in thought. In detail, how- 
ever, there is much variety of usage, and care should be taken not to insist on 
such uniformity in the pupils’ practice as is not found in the printed books 
which they use. If young writers can be induced to indieate the ends of their 
sentences properly, much has been accomplished.
-P-A-G-E-325
  RULES OF PUNCTUATION 307 
2. Before a direct quotation in a sentence. Thus, — 
The cry ran through the ranks, ‘ Are we never to move forward?” 
Norsr. When the quotation is long or formal, a colon, or a colon and a 
dash, may be used instead of a comma, especially with the words as follows. 
3. After a direct quotation when this is the subject or the object 
of a following verb. Thus, — 
“They are coming; the attack will be made on the center,” said Lord 
Fitzroy Somerset. 
"I see it,”’ was the cool reply of the duke. 
Nore. Ifthe quotation ends with an interrogation point or an exclamation 
point, no comma is used. 
4. To separate words, or groups of words, arranged in a codrdinate 
series, when these are not connected by and, or, or nor. 
If the conjunction is used to connect the last two members of the 
series but omitted with the others, the comma may be used before 
the conjunction. 
I found two saws, an axe, and a hammer. 
They were so shy, so subtle, and so swift of foot, that it was difficult to come 
at them. 
It would make the reader pity me to tell what odd, misshapen, ugly things 
I made. 
They groaned, they stirred, they all uprose. 
Nore 1. Commas may be used even when conjunctions are expressed, if 
the members of the series consist of several words, or if the writer wishes to 
emphasize their distinctness. 
Nore 2. Clauses in a series are commonly separated by semicolons unless 
they are short and simple (see pp. 309-310). 
5. To set off words and phrases out of their regular order. Thus, — 
Seated on her accustomed chair, with her usual air of apathy and want of 
interest in what surrounded her, she seemed now and then mechanically to 
resume the motion of twirling her spindle. — Scort. 
6. To separate a long subject from the verb of the predicate. 
Thus, — 
To have passed them over in an historical sketch of my literary life and 
opinions, would have seemed to me like the denial of a debt. CoLERIDGE. 
7. To set off an appositive noun or an appositive adjective, with 
its modifiers. Thus, — 
Thave had the most amusing letter from Hogg, the Ettrick minstrel.
-P-A-G-E-326
308 APPENDIX 
There was an impression upon the public mind, natural enough from the 
continually augmenting velocity of the mail, but quite erroneous, that an out- 
side seat on this class of carriages was a post of danger. — Dx Quincry. 
Nore 1. Many participial and other adjective phrases come under this 
head. Thus, — 
The genius, seeing me indulge myself on this melancholy prospect, told me 
Ihad dwelt long enough upon it.— Appison. 
Nore 2. If a noun and its appositive are so closely connected as to form 
one idea, no comma is used. Thus, — 
My friend Jackson lives in San Francisco. 
Norr 3. An intensive pronoun (myse//, etc.) is not separated by a comma 
from the substantive which it emphasizes. 
Nore 4. A series of words or phrases in apposition with a single substan- 
tive is sometimes set off, as a whole, by a comma and a dash. 
8. To set off a subordinate clause, especially one introduced by 
a descriptive relative. Thus, — 
I am going to take a last dinner with a most agreeable family, who have 
been my only neighbors ever since I have lived at Weston. —CowPEr. 
Norr. No comma is used before a restrictive relative. Thus, — 
I want to know many things which only you can tell me. 
Perhaps I am the only man in England who can boast of such good fortune. 
9. To set off a phrase containing a nominative absolute. Thus,— 
They had some difficulty in passing the ferry at the riverside, the ferryman 
being afraid of them. —DxEror. 
10. To set off however, nevertheless, moreover, etc., and introductory 
phrases like in the first place, on the one hand, etc. 
11. To set off a parenthetical expression. For this purpose com- 
mas, dashes, or marks of parenthesis may be used. 
When the parenthetical matter is brief or closely related to the 
rest of the sentence, it is generally set off by commas. Thus, — 
I exercised a piece of hypocrisy for which, I hope, you will hold me 
excused. — THACKERAY. 
When it is longer and more independent, it is generally marked 
off by dashes, or enclosed in marks of parenthesis. The latter are 
less frequently used at present than formerly. 
The connection of the mail with the state and the executive government — 
a connection obvious, but yet not strictly defined — gave to the whole mail 
establishment an official grandeur. —DE QuiNcEY. 
Nore. Brackets are used to indicate insertions that are not part of the text.
-P-A-G-E-327
  RULES OF PUNCTUATION 309 
seal 
The clauses of a compound sentence may be separated by colons, 
semicolons, or commas. 
1. The colon is used — 
a. To show that the second of two clauses repeats the substance 
of the first in another form, or defines the first as an 
appositive defines a noun. Thus, — 
This was the practice of the Grecian stage. But Terence made an innova- 
tion in the Roman: all his plays have double actions. —DrypEN. 
b. To separate two groups of clauses one or both of which con- 
tain a semicolon. Thus, — 
At that time, news such as we had heard might have been long in pene- 
trating so far into the recesses of the mountains; but now, as you know, the 
approach is easy, and the communication, in summer time, almost hourly: 
nor is this strange, for travellers after pleasure are become not less active, 
and more numerous, than those who formerly left their homes for purposes of 
gain. — WORDSWORTH. 
Nors. The colon is less used now than formerly. The tendency is to use 
a semicolon or to begin a new sentence. 
2. Thé semicolon is used when the clauses are of the same general 
nature and contribute to the same general effect, especially if one or 
more of them contain commas. Thus, — 
The sky was cloudless; the sun shone out bright and warm; the songs of 
birds, and hum of myriads of summer insects filled the air; and the cottage 
garden, crowded with every rich and beautiful tint, sparkled in the heavy dew 
like beds of glittering jewels. —DicKENs. 
3. The comma may be used when the clauses are short and simple 
(see p. 807). 
Norts. The choice between colon, semicolon, and comma is determined in 
many cases by the writer’s feeling of the closer or the looser connection of the 
ideas expressed by the several clauses, and is to some extent a matter of taste. 
EV: 
1. In a complex sentence, the dependent clause is generally sep- 
arated from the main clause by a comma. But when the dependent 
clause is short and the connection close, the comma may be omitted. 
Norr. A descriptive relative clause is preceded by a comma, a restrictive 
relative clause is not (see p. 70).
-P-A-G-E-328
310 APPENDIX 
2. The clauses of a series, when in the same dependent construc- 
tion, are often separated by semicolons to give more emphasis to each. 
Thus, — 
[Mrs. Battle] was none of your lukewarm gamesters, your half-and-half 
players, who have no objection to take a hand if you want one to make upa 
rubber; who affirm that they have no pleasure in winning; that they like to 
win one game and lose another; that they can while away an hour very agree- 
ably at a card table, but are indifferent whether they play or no; and will 
desire an adversary who has slipped a wrong card, to take it up and play 
another. — Lams. 
Vv 
1. A direct quotation is enclosed in quotation marks. 
Nore. If the quotation stands by itself and is printed in different type, 
the marks may be omitted. 
2. A quotation within a quotation is usually enclosed in single 
quotation marks. 
3. Ina quotation consisting of several paragraphs, quotation marks 
are put at the beginning of each paragraph and at the end of the last. 
Nors. For the punctuation before a quotation, see p. 307. 
4. When a book, poem, or the like, is referred to, the title may be 
enclosed in quotation marks or italicized. 
val 
1. Sudden changes in thought and feeling or breaks in speech are 
indicated by dashes. Thus, — 
Eh! —what —why — upon my life, and so it is —Charley, my boy, so it’s. 
you, is it? —Lrvrr. 
2. Parenthetical expressions may be set off by dashes (see p. 308). 
3. A colon, or colon and dash, may precede an enumeration, a direct 
quotation, or a statement formally introduced, — especially with as 
follows, namely, and the like. Before an enumeration a comma and a 
dash may be used. Thus, — 
_ There are eight parts of speech: — nouns, pronouns, adjectives, verbs, ad- 
verbs, prepositions, conjunctions, and interjections. OR— 
There are eight parts of speech, — nouns, pronouns, etc. 
4. The dash is sometimes used to strengthen a comma (as in the 
last paragraph but one).

RULES OF SYNTAX 311 
VIL 
1. The apostrophe is used — 
a. To mark the omission of a letter or letters in contractions 
b. As a sign of the possessive or genitive. 
c. To indicate the plural of letters, signs, etc. 
2. The hyphen is used — 
a. When the parts of a word are separated in writing. 
b. Between the parts of some compound words. (See the 
dictionary in each case.) 
RULES OF SYNTAX 
1. The subject of a verb is in the nominative case (p. 41). 
2. A substantive standing in the predicate, but describing or 
defining the subject, agrees with the subject in case and is called 
a predicate nominative (p. 41). 
3. A substantive used for the purpose of addressing a person 
directly, and not connected with any verb, is called a vocative. 
A vocative is in the nominative case, and is often called a nomina- 
tive by direct address or a vocative nominative (p. 42). 
4. A substantive used as an exclamation is called an exclamatory 
nominative or a nominative of exclamation (p. 42). 
5. A substantive, with a participle, may express the cause, time, 
or circumstances of an action. 
This is called the absolute construction. 
The substantive is in the nominative case and is called a nominative 
absolute (p. 144). 
6. The possessive case denotes ownership or possession (p. 48). 
7. The object of a verb or preposition is in the objective case (p. 47). 
8. A substantive that completes the meaning of a transitive verb 
is called its direct object, and is said to be in the objective case (p. 48). 
9. A verb of asking sometimes takes two direct objects, one de- 
noting the person and the other the thing (p. 50). 
10. Verbs of choosing, calling, naming, making, and thinking may 
take two objects referring to the same person or thing.  
-P-A-G-E-330
  
312 APPENDIX 
The first of these is the direct object, and the second, which com- 
pletes the sense of the predicate, is called a predicate objective 
(pp. 50, 111). 
11. Some verbs of giving, telling, refusing, and the like, may take 
two objects, a direct object and an indirect object. 
The indirect object denotes the person or thing toward whom or 
toward which is directed the action expressed by the rest of the 
predicate (p. 50). 
12. A verb that is regularly intransitive sometimes takes as object 
a noun whose meaning closely resembles its own. 
A noun in this construction is called the cognate object of the verb 
and is in the objective case (p. 52). 
13. A noun, or a group of words consisting of a noun and its modi- 
fiers, may be used adverbially. Such a noun is called an adverbial 
objective (p. 53). 
14. An appositive is in the same case as the substantive which it 
limits (p. 42). 
15. A pronoun must agree with its antecedent in gender, number, 
and person (p. 55). 
16. Relative pronouns connect dependent clauses with main clauses 
by referring directly to a substantive in the main clause. 
This substantive is the antecedent of the relative (p. 66). 
A relative pronoun must agree with its antecedent in gender, num- 
ber, and person. 
The case of a relative pronoun has nothing to do with its anteced- 
ent, but depends on the construction of its own clause (p. 68). 
17. A relative pronoun in the objective case is often omitted (p. 69). 
18. The relative pronoun what is equivalent to that which, and has 
a double construction : — (1) the construction of the omitted or implied 
antecedent that; (2) the construction of the relative which (p. 71). 
19. The compound relative pronouns may include or imply their 
own antecedents and hence may have a double construction (p. 72). 
The compound relatives are sometimes used without an antecedent 
expressed or implied (p. 72). 
20. An adjective is said to belong to the substantive which it de- 
scribes or limits (pp. 5, 75). 
21. Adjectives may be classified, according to their position in the 
sentence, as attributive, appositive, and predicate adjectives (p. 76).
-P-A-G-E-331
  
RULES OF SYNTAX 313 
1. An attributive adjective is closely attached to its noun and 
regularly precedes it. 
2. An appositive adjective is added to its noun to explain it, like 
a noun in apposition. 
3. A predicate adjective completes the meaning of the predicate 
verb, but describes or limits the subject. 
For the use of an adjective as predicate objective, see § 488. 
22. The comparative degree, not the superlative, is used in compar- 
ing two persons or things. 
The superlative is used in comparing one person or thing with two 
or more (p. 88). 
23. Relative adverbs introduce subordinate clauses and are similar 
in their use to relative pronouns (p. 86). 
24. A verb must agree with its subject in number and person (p. 97). 
25. A compound subject with and usually takes a verb in the plural 
number (p. 100). 
26. A compound subject with or or nor takes a verb in the singular 
number if the substantives are singular (p. 100). 
27. Nouns that are plural in form but singular in sense commonly 
take a verb in the singular number (p. 101). 
28. Collective nouns take sometimes a singular and sometimes a 
plural verb. 
When the persons or things denoted are thought of as individuals, 
the plural should be used. When the collection is regarded as a unit, 
the singular should be used (p. 101). 
29. A verb is in the active voice when it represents the subject as 
the doer of an act (p. 107). 
30. A verb is in the passive voice when it represents the subject as 
the receiver or the product of an action (p. 107). 
The object of the active verb becomes the subject of the passive, 
and the subject of the active verb becomes in the passive an adver- 
bial phrase modifying the predicate verb (p. 110). 
31. When a verb takes both a direct and an indirect object, one of 
the two is often retained after the passive, the other becoming the 
subject (p. 112). 
32. The indicative is the mood of simple assertion or interrogation, 
but it is used in other constructions also (p. 115). 
33. The imperative is the mood of command or request (p. 115).
-P-A-G-E-332
  314 APPENDIX 
34. The subject of an imperative is seldom expressed unless it is 
emphatic. 
The subject, when expressed, may precede the imperative: as, — 
You go, You read (p.117). 
35. The subjunctive mood is used in certain special constructions 
of wish, condition, and the like (pp. 115, 118). 
For particulars and examples, see pp. 119-123. 
For modal auxiliaries, see pp. 124-132. 
36. An infinitive, with or without a complement or modifiers, may 
be used as the subject of a sentence, as a predicate nominative, or as 
an appositive (pp. 134, 135). 
37. An infinitive may be used as the object of the prepositions but, 
except, about, (p. 135). 
38. The infinitive may be used as a nominative of exclamation 
(p. 136). 
39. An infinitive may modify a verb by completing its meaning, or 
by expressing the purpose of the action (p. 137). 
40. An infinitive may be used as an adjective modifier of a noun or 
as an adverbial modifier of an adjective. 
In this use the infinitive is said to depend on the word which it 
modifies (p. 136). 
41. A kind of clause, consisting of a substantive in the objective 
case followed by an infinitive, may be used as the object of certain 
verbs. 
Such clauses are called infinitive clauses, and the substantive is 
said to be the subject of the infinitive. 
The subject of an infinitive is in the objective case. 
Infinitive clauses are used (1) after verbs of wishing, commanding, 
advising, and the like, and (2) after some verbs of believing, declaring, 
and perceiving (p. 238). 
An infinitive clause may be the object of the preposition for. 
An infinitive clause with for may be used as a subject, as a predi- 
cate nominative, or as the object of a preposition (pp. 188-139). 
42. The participle is a verb-form which has no subject, but which 
partakes of the nature of an adjective and expresses action or state 
in such a way as to describe or limit a substantive (pp. 12, 140). 
43. A participle is said to belong to the substantive which it de- 
scribes or limits (pp. 12, 142).
-P-A-G-E-333
  
RULES OF SYNTAX 315 
44. A participle should not be used without some substantive to 
which it may belong (p. 142). 
45. An infinitive or a participle, like any other verb-form, may 
take an object if its meaning allows (pp. 134, 1438). 
46. Infinitives and participles, like other verb-forms, may be modi- 
fied by adverbs, adverbial phrases, or adverbial clauses (pp. 134, 142). 
47. Verbal (or participial) nouns in -ing have the form of present 
participles, but the construction of nouns (p. 145). 
48. Verbal nouns in -ing have certain properties of the verb (p. 146). 
1. Verbal nouns in -ing may take a direct or an indirect object if 
their meaning allows. 
2. A verbal noun in -ing may take an adverbial modifier. 
But verbal nouns in -ing, like other nouns, may be modified by 
adjectives. 
49. A noun in -ing may be used as an adjective, or as the adjective 
element in a compound noun (p. 146). 
50. The substantive which follows a preposition is called its object 
and is in the objective case (p. 148). 
51. A codrdinate conjunction connects words or groups of words 
that are independent of each other (p. 151). 
52. A subordinate conjunction connects a subordinate clause with 
the clause on which it depends (p. 151). 
53. Interjections usually have no grammatical connection with the 
phrases or sentences in which they stand. 
Sometimes, however, a substantive is connected with an interjec- 
tion by means of a preposition (p: 155).

  316 APPENDIX 
THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE 
English is a member of the great Indo-European Family of 
languages, which is so called because it includes well-nigh all the 
languages of Europe and the most important of those found in India. 
Within this family, English belongs to the Teutonic (or Germanic) 
Group, which contains also German, Dutch, the Scandinavian tongues 
(icelandic, Danish, Norwegian, Swedish), and some others. 
English of the oldest period is called either Anglo-Saxon or Old 
English. This was the speech of certain piratical tribes whose home 
was in northern Germany, on the eastern and southern shores of the 
North Sea, but who invaded Britain about a.p. 450, and subdued 
the Celtic inhabitants of the island in a series of fierce wars. The 
most considerable of the invading tribes were the Angles and the 
Saxons. Their dominion was well assured by the beginning of 
the seventh century, and their language, which they usually called 
“English ” (that is, “the tongue of the Angles”), gradually spread 
through England and most of Scotland. In Wales, however, the 
native Britons have maintained their own Celtic speech to the 
present day; and in the Scottish Highlands, Gaelic — which is akin 
to Welsh and practically identical with the native language of 
Ireland — is still extensively used. 
At the time of the invasion, the Angles and Saxons were heathen, 
and the Britons, who had been for four centuries under the sway of 
the Roman Empire, were Christians, and much more highly civilized 
than their conquerors. Indeed, they had adopted many features of 
Roman culture, and Latin was spoken to some extent, at least in 
the larger towns. By the end of the seventh century, however, the 
Anglo-Saxons also had embraced Christianity and had made remark- 
able advances in literature and learning. The language of the 
Britons exerted but slight influence upon that of the Anglo-Saxons. 
The Celtic words in English are few in number, and most of them 
were borrowed in comparatively recent times. 
The Norman Conquest (1066) marks a highly significant date in 
the history of our language. The Normans were a Scandinavian 
tribe who had been in possession of Normandy (in northern France) 
for about a hundred and fifty years. They had abandoned their
-P-A-G-E-335
THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE 317 
native tongue, and spoke a dialect of French. From 1066 to about 
the year 1400, two languages were therefore common in England, — 
English, which was employed by the vast majority of the people, 
and French, which was the language of the court and the higher 
orders. French, however, was never a serious rival of English for 
supremacy in the island. It was the speech of a class, not of the 
nation, and its use gradually died out, except as an accomplishment. 
By the time of Chaucer (who was born about 1340 and died in 1400), 
it was clear that the English tongue was henceforth to be regarded 
as the only natural language for Englishmen, whether they were of 
Anglo-Saxon or of Norman origin. 
Still, the Norman conquest had a profound influence upon Eng- 
lish. It is not true — though often asserted — that the multitude of 
French words which our language contains were derived from the 
Norman dialect. Comparatively few of them came into English until 
after 1300, when Normandy had been lost to the English crown for 
a hundred years. Since 1300 we have borrowed freely — not from 
Norman, however, but from Central (or Parisian) French, which had 
become the standard to which the English descendants of the Nor- 
mans endeavored to conform. The effect of the Conquest, then, was 
not to fill English with Norman terms. It was rather to bring Eng- 
land into close social and literary relations with France, and thus 
to facilitate the adoption of words and constructions from Central 
French. 
Further, since literature was in the middle ages dependent in the 
main upon private patronage, the existence of a ruling class whose 
interest wasin French, discouraged the maintenance of any national 
or general standard of English composition. Every English writer 
had recourse to his local dialect, and one dialect was felt to be as 
good as another. 
By 1350, however, the dialect of London and the vicinity had come, 
apparently, to be regarded as somewhat more elegant and polished 
than the others. All that was needed was the appearance of some 
writer of supreme genius to whom this dialect should be native. 
Chaucer was such a writer, for he was born in London. To be 
sure, Chaucer did not “make modern English.” None the less, 
he was a powerful agent in settling the language. Since his time, 
at all events, the fact of a “standard of literary usage” has been
-P-A-G-E-336

undisputed. Dialects still exist, but they are not regarded as authori- 
tative. Educated speakers and writers of English, the world over, 
use the language with substantial uniformity. 
Meantime, however, the English of the Anglo-Saxons had under- 
gone many changes before Chaucer was born. Most of its inflections 
had been lost, and still others have been discarded since. Further, 
there had been extensive borrowing from French and Latin, and this 
continued throughout the fourteenth century. The habit, once 
formed, has proved lasting. Our vocabulary has received contributions 
from many languages, and is still receiving them. Greek may be 
mentioned in particular as the source of many words, especially in 
the various departments of science. But French and Latin remain 
the chief foreign elements in English. 
In the following extract from Scott, most of the words printed in 
Roman type are of Anglo-Saxon origin, whereas the italicized words 
are derived from Latin or French. 
It was not until evening was nearly closed that Ivanhoe was restored 
to consciousness of his situation. He awoke froma broken slumber, under 
the confused impressions which are naturally attendant on the recovery 
from a state of insensibility. He was unable for some time to recall exactly 
to memory the circumstances which had preceded his fall in the lists, or to 
make out any connected chain of the events in which he had been engaged 
upon the yesterday. A sense of wounds and injury, joined to great weak- 
ness and exhaustion, was mingled with the recollection of blows dealt and 
received, of steeds rushing upon each other, overthrowing and overthrown, 
of shouts and clashing of arms, and all the heady tumult of a confused 
fight. An effort to draw aside the curtain of his couch was in some degree 
successful, although rendered difficult by the pain of his wound. 
English has also adopted a good many Scandinavian words, though 
they form no such proportion of its vocabulary as French or Latin. 
Danish and Norwegian pirates began to harry the coast in the eighth 
century. Permanent settlements followed, as well as wars of con- 
quest, and for about thirty years (1013-1042) a Danish family occu- 
pied the English throne. These events explain the Scandinavian 
element in our language. 
1 
1 It is not meant, of course, that an American or Australian of the present 
day should exert himself to imitate the speech of a modern Londoner. The 
point is, that what we now call ‘‘ English” is, in most respects, the direct de- 
scendant of the London dialect of the fourteenth century.
-P-A-G-E-337
  THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE 319 
Despite the freedom with which English has adopted words from 
abroad, it is still essentially a Germanic speech. Its structure is still . 
the native structure. The borrowings have enriched its vocabulary, 
but have had comparatively little effect upon its syntax. The foreign 
words have been naturalized, and their presence in no wise inter- 
feres with the unity and general consistency of the English language. 
It is a strange error to regard English as a combination of Anglo- 
Saxon and Norman French. As for the loss or decay of inflections, 
that is not due to a mixture of dialects. It is a natural tendency, 
which may be seen, for example, in Dutch and Danish, though there 
was no Norman Conquest in Holland or Denmark. The loss, indeed, 
is really a gain, for it is progress in the direction of simplicity. 
The Anglo-Saxon or Old English Period comes down to about a 
century, or a century and a half, after the Norman Conquest. Its 
extreme limit may be set at 1200. The period from 1200 to 1500 
is usually known as the Middle English Period. From 1500 to the 
present time may be regarded as the Modern Period, though within 
these boundaries English has changed enormously in pronunciation 
and in vocabulary, very largely in syntax, and to some extent in in- 
flection. The almost complete abandonment of the subjunctive in 
common speech is one of the latest of these changes. This, too, is 
in the direction of simplicity. 
The people of Great Britain have long been famous as travellers, 
explorers, and colonizers. Their language, once the dialect (or dia- 
lects) of a handful of Germanic adventurers, has spread to all parts 
of the world, so that now it is not merely the language of England, 
but, to aconsiderable extent, that of Scotland, Ireland, North America, 
India, Australasia, and South Africa. In this vast area, numerous va- 
rieties of pronunciation and of idiom of course occur, but, on the 
whole, the uniformity of the language is surprisingly well preserved.

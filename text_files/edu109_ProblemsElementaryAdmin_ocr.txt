  EDITOR’S PREFACE 
HHREE important contemporary problems in the ad- 
ministration of elementary schools are treated in this 
volume by a method which is commending itself increasingly 
to students of Education, and has a special significance for 
all officers of school administration and supervision. These 
problems arise when the establishment of intermediate schools 
(or junior high schools) is under consideration; when we seek 
to ascertain what a satisfactory rate of promotion is, and 
under what conditions we may hope for a maximum rate of 
promotion; and when we try to secure age-grade standards 
that will yield us usable and valid information concerning the 
number of normal-age, over-age, and under-age children in 
the schools: and the method employed in dealing with these 
problems is the statistical or objective method—the method 
that is free from personal bias or general opinion, and seeks to 
arrive at valid conclusions on the basis of incontestable and 
well-organized data. 
Dr. Bachman’s brief but comprehensive introduction states 
these problems clearly, and also the principles of method on 
which his studies are based. The main body of the volume 
consists of three parts, each dealing with one of the problems 
under consideration. Parts I and II constitute Dr. Bachman’s 
contribution to the report submitted by me to the Committee 
on School Inquiry of the Board of Estimate and Apportion- 
ment of the City of New York in 1912; and Part III is a 
report made to that Committee after my term of service had 
closed. 
I welcomed the opportunity to publish these three important 
reports substantially unchanged in a volume of the School 
Efficiency Series, both because they contain comprehensive

data of much intrinsic value, and because they illustrate in 
detail Dr. Bachman’s objective method of reaching con- 
clusions, a method that can be advantageously employed in 
the study of school administration anywhere.

PROBLEMS IN ELEMENTARY 
SCHOOL ADMINISTRATION 
INTRODUCTION 
HE objective or statistical method is applied, in this 
volume, to the solution of certain practical problems 
related to the administration of the elementary schools. 
In the solution of administrative problems there are three 
general methods of procedure in common use. The first of 
these may be called the method of personal judgment. A 
superintendent or principal studies the question of forming 
a class for backward children, and gives his judgment, which 
is essentially his personal opinion. Again, a number of per- 
sons canvass a field—for example, the causes of non-pro- 
motion—and submit a joint report. In such a report, the 
opinion of the individual is modified by the opinion of the 
group. This method may be termed the method of collec- 
tive or group judgment. Finally, there is the objective or 
statistical method. Here the facts collected and presented, 
or the objective standards of measurement employed, be- 
come the prime factor in determining the conclusion reached, 
and there is little place left either for the opinion of the 
individual or of the group. Each of these methods has its 
use and its value. It is conceded, however, that, where ap- 
plicable, the objective or statistical method is the preferable 
one to employ, and that in a judicious use of this method 
lies our hope of education becoming a science. 
Few topics in the field of the elementary school are re-

  4 Introduction 
ceiving to-day as much attention as the intermediate school, 
called also the junior high school. Part I of this volume is 
devoted to a consideration of a number of questions to 
which superintendents want satisfactory answers before 
they are willing to recommend the bringing together of the 
seventh and eighth grade pupils into a central building. For 
example, when children are sent from the home school to a 
distant intermediate school, will fewer or more of them 
continue beyond the sixth grade; will a larger or smaller 
number complete the elementary course of study; will their 
progress through the school be more or less rapid? What 
educational opportunities and advantages does the inter- 
mediate school offer over the ordinary school having all 
grades? What is the difference in the cost when the regular 
seventh and eighth grades are in a central school? These 
and other questions are answered in the light of the experi- 
ence of New York City with the intermediate school. This 
experience should be helpful to those who have under con- 
sideration the segregation of the children of the upper 
grades. 
_ In the management of the elementary school it is of the 
highest importance that children be properly classified and 
that they advance regularly from grade to grade. Accord- 
ingly, Part II of this volume has to do with the classification 
and progress of school children. Progress from grade to 
grade is conditioned on promotion and non-promotion. In 
the first section of Part II, the general problem of promo- 
tion and non-promotion, what the rate of promotion should 
be, and the conditions favorable to a maximum rate of pro- 
motion are treated in detail. An analysis is also made of 
the factors which contribute to non-promotion, such as size 
of class, absence, over age, inability to use the English 
language, and the short school day or part time. The 
data presented in this connection not only shed light on 
the causes of non-promotion, but also on the value of special 
classes, such as classes for children unable to speak the 
English language and classes for backward children.
-P-A-G-E-15
  Introduction 5 
The relation between the age of the child and the grade in 
which he should be enrolled, and the relation between the 
length of time a child has been in school and the number of 
units of work or the grades he has completed, have of late 
years been widely discussed. Indeed, we have come to ap- 
preciate that insight into these age-grade relations is funda- 
mental, not only to the proper classification of children, but 
to the adaptation of the work and the life of the school to 
their capacities and needs. While the value of definite 
knowledge of the relation between the ages of the children 
and the grades they have completed is generally accepted, 
there is by no means a like unity of opinion with regard to 
the method to be employed to determine whether or not a 
child is under age, normal age, or over age. There should 
be a common method of determining over age, both for the 
sake of exactness and for the sake of comparison of one 
system of schools with another. The second section of Part 
II takes up the essential features of such a method, dealing 
with the age-grade standards to be used, when and how to 
make age-grade reports, when to take the ages of children, 
how to take the ages of children, and what children to in- 
clude in an age-grade report. 
This volume thus contains a large amount of data that 
may be used in determining educational policies. Useful par- 
ticularly to those who would base their policies on facts and 
who would measure the results of their work are the ex- 
amples contained herein of the application of the objective 
or statistical method to the solution of administrative prob- 
lems.

  CHAPTER I 
EDUCATIONAL EFFICIENCY OF THE INTER- 
MEDIATE SCHOOL 
A* intermediate school in the City of New York is an 
elementary school which receives only pupils pro- 
moted from the 6B grade,’ and in which the instruction is 
restricted to the seventh and eighth years of the elementary 
school course of study. 
There are three such schools in Greater New York, all in 
Manhattan: Public School Number 24, opened in 1905; 
62, opened in 1905; and 159, opened in 1907.2 These 
schools were organized to relieve congestion. The seventh 
and eighth year classes in several neighboring buildings were 
small, and, by bringing these pupils into one school, it was 
possible to set free a number of rooms for the use of chil- 
dren of the lower grades. The organization of these inter- 
mediate schools at once made clear the worth of this kind of 
school as a means of relieving congestion, also the economy 
of such schools in caring for seventh and eighth year pupils, 
as compared with schools having all grades. The amount 
of congestion is steadily increasing—the number of pupils 
on part time having increased from 69,035, on September 
1In New York City each year of the elementary school comprises 
pro erage A and B. Thus, Grade 6B means the second half of the 
2 Public School No. 159 has classes below the 7A grade. It is, how- 
ever, officially recognized as an intermediate school.

  to Problems in Elementary School Administration 
30, 1907, to 79,338, on September 30, I911,7 but no new in- 
termediate schools have been established. 
Our study of the intermediate schools now in operation 
not only will show that the intermediate school, apart from 
its serviceableness in relieving congestion, affords oppor- 
tunity for economy, but will show besides that it affords 
peculiar opportunities to adapt the education of seventh and 
eighth year pupils to their varying needs. Our investiga- 
tion accordingly comprises (1) a study of the educational 
efficiency of the intermediate school; (2) a study of its 
economy; and (3) a review of the peculiar opportunities it 
affords for adapting the instruction to the varying needs of 
seventh and eighth year pupils. 
SOME OBJECTIONS MADE TO THE INTERMEDIATE SCHOOLS 
The City Superintendent of Schools records the estab- 
lishment of intermediate schools as one of the achievements 
since the consolidation of Greater New York. Both the City 
Superintendent of Schools and the Board of Education are 
favorable to intermediate schools and to increasing the num- 
ber of them. There are, however, supervisors and princi- 
pals who are unfavorable and who express the opinion: 
(1) That, when the seventh and eighth grades are re- 
moved from a school, in order to organize an intermediate 
school, a larger per cent. of pupils leave the 6B grade with- 
out completing it in schools having only 1A-6B grades than 
leave the 6B grade in schools having all grades. 
(2) That a larger per cent. of pupils promoted from the 
6B grade fail to enter the 7A grade when they must go to 
an intermediate school than fail to enter the 7A grade when 
they can advance to this grade in their home school. 
(3) That a larger per cent. of seventh and eighth year 
pupils leave the seventh and eighth grades without complet- 
ing these grades in intermediate schools than leave these 
grades in schools having all grades. 
1 Annual report of the City Superintendent of Schools, 1907, and 
special report made to the Committee on School Inquiry.
-P-A-G-E-21
  Educational Efficiency of the Intermediate School 11 
No data have ever been collected by the Board of Edu- 
cation on these points. 
First Objection: That More Pupils Leave the 6B Grade 
without Completing this Grade 
Do a larger per cent. of pupils leave the 6B grade with- 
out completing it in schools having only 1A-6B grades than 
leave this grade in schools having all grades? 
A final answer to this question would involve collecting 
data for a number of terms on children leaving 6B classes 
in schools having only 1A-6B grades, and on children leav- 
ing the same classes in schools having all grades. With the 
time at our disposal it was impossible to do this. We have, 
however, collected such data for the February-June term of 
1911, not only for the 6B, but also for the 5B and 6A, 
grades. See Table I+ 
Table I shows, for the February-June term of 1911, the 
enrollment ? in the 5B, 6A, and 6B grades, and the number 
of pupils who left * these grades in schools having all grades 
(1A-8B) ; and also, by grades and for the same schools, the 
per cent. of the enrollment leaving. The same facts are 
also shown for neighboring schools having 1A-6B grades. 
1The schools having all grades (1A-8B) compared in this report 
with intermediate schools are attended by about the same type of pupils 
as attend the intermediate schools; hence the cost of operation an 
the educational results achieved in the two kinds of schools should be 
about the same. 
The data in all the tables of this study, unless it is otherwise stated, 
were taken from schools located in the same districts with interme- 
diate schools 24, 159, and 62, or located in districts contiguous to these 
intermediate schools. Also, the data collected are from all the schools 
in the given districts of the particular kind under discussion ; that is, 
from all the schools in the given districts having only 1A~ 6B grades, 
from all the schools in the given districts having all grades (1A-8B), 
and from the three intermediate schools. 
2Enrollment, as used here and throughout this study, includes all 
pupils, exclusive of transfers, on the register during the term. 
8 Leaving, as used here and throughout this study, includes all pupils, 
exclusive of transfers, who left school during the term.

  14 Problems in Elementary School Administration 
It will be observed that the losses, both in schools having 
all grades and in schools having only 1A-6B classes, are 
large. These large losses in the 5B, 6A, and 6B grades are 
due to the fact that many children are fourteen years old 
or over by the time they complete the 5A grade. Twenty- 
five per cent. of the children in these grades of the fore- 
going schools on the lower East Side were found to be four- 
teen years old and above.’ These over-age children, being 
able to obtain labor certificates, leave school, from choice or 
necessity, in large numbers. 
The total loss in the 5B, 6A, and 6B classes of schools 
having all grades is 7.88 per cent. of the total enrollment; 
in schools having 1A-6B grades, 7.99 per cent., or a differ- 
ence of .11 of 1 per cent. in favor of schools having all 
grades. So slight is the difference in the holding power of 
these two kinds of schools in the 5B, 6A, and 6B grades 
that, had the 8,169 pupils in these grades in schools having 
only 1A-6B grades been in schools having all classes, only 
nine fewer pupils would have left these schools during the 
February-June term of 1911. 
It should be observed, however, that the losses in schools 
having only 1A-6B grades are 1 per cent. less in 6A classes, 
and in 6B .43 of 1 per cent. less than in the corresponding 
classes of schools having all grades, and that only in 5B 
classes are the losses in schools having all grades less than 
in schools having only 1A-6B grades. If more 5B pupils 
drop from schools having only 1A-6B grades, there are of 
course fewer left to drop from the 6A and the 6B grades, 
hence it may be that .11 of one per cent. represents the 
actual difference in the holding power of these two kinds of 
schools. Such a difference is, however, too small to serve 
as a basis of judgment. 
There are, however, reasons why schools having only 
1A-6B classes should be able to hold relatively more 6B 
pupils than schools having all grades. The highest class in 
any school is the object of special attention and considera- 
1 From reports to the Committee on School Inquiry, June, 1911.

  Educational Efficiency of the Intermediate School 15 
tion. In schools having all grades this class is the 8B; in 
schools having only 1A-6B grades it is the 6B. Hence, 
more attention and consideration are given to 6B pupils in 
schools having only 1A-6B grades than are given such 
pupils in schools having all grades. The inevitable effect 
of this special attention and consideration is to increase the 
power of schools having only 1A-6B grades to hold 6B 
pupils who might otherwise drop out. 
From the foregoing it appears that there is at least no 
ground in the data collected for the February-June term, 
1gi1, for the prevailing opinion that more children leave 
the 6B classes in schools having only rA-6B grades than 
leave the corresponding classes in schools having all grades. 
Indeed, the reverse seems to be true. 
Second Objection: That More Pupils Promoted from the 
6B Grade do not Enter the 7A Grade 
Do a larger per cent. of pupils promoted from the 6B 
grade fail to enter the 7A grade when they must go to an 
intermediate school than fail to enter the 7A grade when 
they can advance to this grade in their home school? 
Table II shows the total number of 6B promotions Janu- 
ary 31, 1911, in schools having all grades, and the total 
number of 7A beginners? in these schools for the February- 
June term of 1911; also the per cent. of 6B promotions 
entering the 7A grade. The table also shows the same facts 
for contributing schools and for intermediate schools 24, 
159, and 62. (See page 16.) 
Few pupils in the foregoing schools, promoted from the 
6B grade in January, 1911, failed to enter the 7A grade in 
February—only twenty-eight out of a total of 3,008. In 
neither kind of school does the number failing to enter the

7A grade amount to 1 per cent. of the 6B promotions, 
whereas .03 of 1 per cent. measures the difference in the 
total per cent. of loss. This difference is in favor of the 
schools having all grades; but it is so small that, had the 
same rate of loss prevailed as prevailed in schools having

  18 Problems in Elementary School Administration 
The number of children leaving school is always smaller 
between the Fall and Spring terms when there is practically 
no interruption in the work of the school than between the 
Spring and Fall terms when there is a long vacation. It is, 
therefore, not surprising, as shown in Table III, that, in 
the schools having all grades, 4.89 per cent. of the pupils 
promoted from the 6B grade in June failed to enter the 7A 
grade in September, and that 5.56 per cent. of the 6B pupils 
promoted from contributing schools failed to enter the 7A 
grade of intermediate schools. The pupils lost in going 
from contributing schools to intermediate schools were, 
however, greater by only .67 of 1 per cent. (5.56—4.89) 
than the pupils lost between the 6B and 7A of schools hay- 
ing all grades—a difference of ten pupils. 
The factors influencing the exact number of 6B promo- 
tions entering the 7A are so many and so complex that the 
small difference revealed by the foregoing data might have 
been due to the action of any one of several factors. To 
illustrate: In Public School Number 159 ' forty 6B promo- 
tions from contributing schools failed to attend during the 
September-January term a single day: 
Disappeared (moved, leaving no address).

Had the five children that disappeared and the five chil- 
dren that moved to the country asked for transfers, this 
simple fact alone would have erased any difference for the 
September-January term of 1911-12 in the number of 6B 
promotions entering the 7A of these two kinds of schools. 
Apart from losses due to such causes as sickness, entering 
a private or parochial school, moving to another city, there 
1 From special report made by the principal.
-P-A-G-E-29
  Educational Efficiency of the Intermediate School 19 
is only one group of pupils, promoted from the 6B grade, 
that can fail to enter the 7A, viz., children who are fourteen 
years of age and over. There are large numbers of such 
children—approximately each fourth child in the schools 
of the city in the 6B grade has attained his fourteenth year. 
Any considerable difference, therefore, between the number 
of 6B promotions entering the 7A of schools having all 
grades and of intermediate schools must lie in the differ- 
ence in attractiveness of these two kinds of schools for 
pupils fourteen years of age and over. There is no inherent 
reason why intermediate schools should not be even more 
attractive to such children than schools having all grades. 
It has been shown, therefore, that the only ground for 
believing that more pupils promoted from the 6B enter the 
7A of schools having all grades than of intermediate schools 
lies in the fact that for the spring term of 1911 the differ- 
ence in per cent. of 6B promotions entering these two kinds 
of schools was .03 of 1 per cent., and for the September- 
January term of 1911-12 .67 of 1 per cent.—differences so 
small that out of 3,069 promoted pupils from contributing 
schools for the calendar year 1911 only ten fewer pupils 
failed to enter the 7A of intermediate schools than would 
have entered had these 6B promoted pupils been able to 
enter the 7A of their home school. These differences sup- 
ply no adequate basis for the foregoing belief, and hence 
supply no grounds for the City Superintendent and the 
Board of Education to change their favorable attitude 
toward intermediate schools. 
Third Objection: That More Pupils Leave the 7A-8B 
Grades without Completing these Grades 
Do a larger per cent. of seventh and eighth year pupils 
leave the seventh and eighth grades without completing 
these grades in intermediate schools than leave these grades 
in schools having all grades?

  22 Problems in Elementary School Administration 
Table IV shows for the February-June term, 1911, the 
enrollment in schools having all grades in 7A, 7B, 8A, and 
8B grades, and the number leaving each of these grades; 
also grade for grade and for the same schools the per cent. 
of the total enrollment leaving. The table also shows the 
same facts for intermediate schools 24, 159, and 62. (See 
pages 20-21.) 
The per cent. of pupils leaving these two kinds of schools 
varies grade for grade, and is different for boys and girls. 
While the per cent. of loss of boys in the 7A, 7B, and 8B 
grades is slightly greater in intermediate schools than in 
schools having all grades (less than 1 per cent. in each case, 
amounting to a difference of six, one, and one pupils re- 
spectively), when boys and girls are taken together, .71 of 
I per cent. more 7A pupils, 1.93 per cent. more 7B pupils, 
2.05 per cent. more 8A pupils, and 1.03 per cent. more 8B 
pupils left schools having all grades than intermediate 
schools. The highest per cent. of loss, it will be observed, is 
in the 7A in both kinds of schools. The 7A grade is ap- 
parently the most trying of the four upper grades, and par- 
ticularly trying in the intermediate school. Friendships in 
the old school are broken off; new acquaintances need to be 
formed, and the pupil must adjust himself to a new school 
life. Despite these facts, the holding power of the 7A grade 
in intermediate schools is apparently greater than the hold- 
ing power of the 7A grade in schools having all classes. 
The total per cent. of 7A-8B pupils leaving schools hav- 
ing all grades is 1.75 per cent. (8.56—6.81) greater than 
the total losses in intermediate schools. Had the same rate 
of loss prevailed as prevailed in intermediate schools, 122 
fewer pupils, out of the total of 6,973, would have left 
schools having all grades. 
There is, therefore, no basis in the foregoing for the ex- 
pressed opinion that more children leave the seventh and 
eighth year classes in intermediate schools than leave the 
corresponding classes in schools having all grades. 
 
-P-A-G-E-33
  Educational Efficiency of the Intermediate School 23 
FURTHER COMPARISONS 
That further comparisons might be made between schools 
having all grades and intermediate schools, data were col- 
lected on promotions and on terms of work lost and gained. 
Relative Rate of Promotion in the 7A-8B Grades 
Table V shows for the February-June term, 1911, the 
enrollment in schools having all grades in the 7A, 7B, 8A, 
and 8B grades, and the number of pupils promoted June 30, 
IQII, in each of these grades; also grade by grade and for 
the same schools the per cent. of the total enrollment pro- 
moted. The table also shows the same facts for intermedi- 
ate schools 24, 159, and 62. (See pages 24-25.) 
The per cent. of boys promoted in the 7A, 7B, and 8B 
grades, as shown by Table V, is less by 7.87 per cent., 4.97 
per cent., and 4.42 per cent. respectively in intermediate 
schools than in schools having all grades. A larger per cent. 
of boys in the 8A by 4.42 per cent., and a larger per cent. 
of girls in all four grades by 5.78 per cent., 11.40 per cent., 
5.72 per cent., and .73 per cent. respectively were, however, 
promoted in intermediate schools than in schools having all 
grades; so that while in schools having all grades 83.65 per 
cent. of the total enrollment was promoted, in the intermedi- 
ate schools the per cent. of promotion was 85.69 per cent.— 
a clear difference in favor of intermediate schools of 2.04 
per cent. Had the same rate of promotion prevailed in the 
two kinds of schools, 142 more pupils, out of a total of 
6,973, would have been advanced in schools having all 
grades. 
A high percentage of promotion does not necessarily indi- 
cate a high degree of efficiency. Yet when due regard is 
paid to proper standards, that school is best which succeeds 
in advancing the largest percentage of its children.

    26 Problems in Elementary School Administration 
Number of Terms of Work Lost and Gained by 7A-8B 
Pupils 
Table VI? shows, for certain schools having all grades, 
the number of graduates June 30, 1911, the terms of work 
lost and gained in the seventh and eighth years by these 
graduates, and the net terms of work lost; also the same 
facts for intermediate schools 24, 159, and 62. These fig- 
ures were taken from special reports made by the principals 
of the schools represented in the table. (See page 27.) 
Table VI shows that the 881 graduates from the schools 
having all grades together lost, during their seventh and 
eighth years, 186 terms of work and gained fifty-eight, a 
net loss of 128, or the equivalent of a loss of a term’s work 
for each group of seven pupils; the 1,137 graduates from 
intermediate schools, while losing 215 terms of work, gained 
203, a net loss of only twelve, the equivalent of a term’s 
work for each group of ninety-four pupils. Hence, had 
the same rate of loss prevailed in the two kinds of schools, 
the 1,137 graduates from intermediate schools would have 
lost 165 terms of work (128+881 1,137), or thirteen 
times as many terms of work as were actually lost by these 
graduates. 
This difference between the number of terms of work lost 
in schools having all grades and in intermediate schools 
suggests a wide difference in the two kinds of schools in the 
chances of losing or gaining a term’s work. In schools hav- 
ing all grades, during the seventh and eighth years, three 
terms of work are lost to one term’s work gained, whereas 
in intermediate schools the terms of work lost and gained 
are about equal. 
This difference in terms of work lost and gained suggests 
also that schools having all grades afford small opportunity 
1Table VI contains data from certain schools having all grades in 
the same districts with intermediate schools 24, 159, and 62, and in 
districts contiguous to these intermediate schools. It was impossible, 
owing to the rush of work at the close of the school year, to collect 
data from all such schools in these districts.

intermediate schools afford large opportunities to shorten 
the course. The difference in such opportunity is reflected 
in the number of terms required by the foregoing graduates 
 
-P-A-G-E-38
  28 Problems in Elementary School Administration 
to complete the course of the seventh and eighth years. In 
schools * having all grades 6.58 per cent. did the work in 3 
terms; 75.82 per cent. did the work in 4 terms; 14.08 per 
cent. did the work in 5 terms; 3.52 per cent. did the work in 
6 terms. In intermediate schools! .97 per cent. did the 
work in 2 terms; 15.92 per cent. did the work in 3 terms; 
68.07 per cent. did the work in 4 terms; 11.17 per cent. did 
the work in 5 terms; 3.87 per cent. did the work in 6 terms. 
Though terms of work lost and gained and the time re- 
quired to do the last two years of the elementary school 
are not in themselves measures of efficiency, yet, when all 
things are taken into account, that school is the most effi- 
cient which does most to accelerate the progress of its pupils 
and which contributes the least to their retardation. 
In these respects, the superiority of the intermediate 
school over schools having all grades is marked. Only 6.58 
per cent. of the graduates from schools having all grades 
completed the last two years of the course ahead of time; 
this was accomplished by 16.89 per cent. of the graduates 
from intermediate schools. Further, 17.60 per cent. of the 
graduates from schools having all grades were retarded in 
the last two years of their course, while but 15.04 per cent. 
of the graduates from intermediate schools took more than 
the regulation time. 
To be sure, pupils may be advanced from grade to grade 
without regard to their attainments. That pupils are not so 
advanced in intermediate schools is indicated by a study 
made by Mr. Coleman D. Frank.?. Mr. Frank studied the 
successes and failures of pupils entering in 1910 the Febru- 
ary class of the DeWitt Clinton High School. The schools 
selected were 160, 188, and 10, Manhattan, schools having 
all grades, and 24 and 62, intermediate schools. These five 
schools send, as a rule, the largest number of pupils to De- 
Witt Clinton High School.

  Educational Efficiency of the Intermediate School 29 
The per cent. of pupils of these schools who succeeded and 
who failed to do all the work of the first and second terms 
was: 
First Term: School Successes Failures 
160 80% 20% 
188 69% 31% 
10 477 53% 62 72% 28%

Io 52% 48% 
62 727% 28% 
24 96% 4% 
When the schools of the two kinds are grouped, the per 
cent. of successes and failures is: 
First Term: Successes Failures 
Schools Having All Grades 68% 32% 
Intermediate Schools 70% 30% 
Second Term: 
Schools Having All Grades 72% 28% 
Intermediate Schools 82% 18% 
It appears that the highest per cent. of successes was at- 
tained in the first term by pupils from a school having all 
grades; in the second term, by pupils from an intermediate 
school. When the pupils coming from the different schools 
of each of the two kinds are taken together, the highest per 
cent. of successes was achieved in both terms by intermedi- 
ate school graduates—at least partial evidence of the quality 
of the work done in these schools. 
SUMMARY OF THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS 
Schools having all grades and contributing and intermedi- 
ate schools have now been compared with reference to five 
points : 
 
-P-A-G-E-40
30 Problems in Elementary School Administration 
1. Number of pupils leaving the 6B grade without com- 
pleting this grade. 
2. Number of pupils promoted from the 6B grade not 
entering the 7A grade. 
Number of pupils leaving the 7A-8B grades without 
completing these grades. 
Relative rate of promotions in the 7A-8B grades. 
Number of terms of work lost and gained by 7A-8B 
pupils. 
  The difference in the efficiency of the two kinds of schools 
with respect to the foregoing points may be summarized as 
follows: 
1. Number of pupils (per 1,000) leaving the 6B 
grade without completing the grade: 
a. In schools having all grades.......... 90 
b. Inschools having only rA-6B grades.. 86 
2. Number of pupils (per 1,000) promoted from 
the 6B grade not entering the 7A grade: 
a. In schools having all grades......... 49 
b. In intermediate schools............. 56 
3. Number of pupils (per 1,000) leaving the 7A- 
8B grades without completing these grades:

b. In intermediate schools............5 II 
 
-P-A-G-E-41
  
Educational Efficiency of the Intermediate School 31 
Hence, we conclude: 
(a) That fewer pupils leave the 6B classes in schools 
having only 1A-6B grades by .43 of I per cent. 
than leave the corresponding classes in schools 
having all grades. 
(b) That more 6B promoted pupils by .67 of 1 per cent. 
fail to enter the 7A grade of intermediate schools 
than fail to enter the 7A when they can advance 
to this grade in.their home school. 
(c) That fewer pupils leave the seventh and eighth year 
classes of intermediate schools by 1.75 per cent. 
than leave the corresponding classes of schools hay- 
ing all grades. 
(d) That more seventh and eighth year pupils are pro- 
moted in intermediate schools by 2.04 per cent. 
than are promoted in schools having all grades. 
(e) That thirteen times as many terms of work are lost 
by seventh and eighth year pupils in schools hav- 
ing all grades as are lost by such pupils in inter- 
mediate schools. 
In only one respect do schools having all grades show a 
higher efficiency than intermediate schools, and in this 
respect the higher efficiency is slight. In all other points the 
intermediate schools show a greater efficiency than schools 
having all grades. 
The data on which the foregoing conclusions rest, with 
the exception of the data on pupils promoted from the 6B 
grade and not entering the 7A grade, cover but the Febru- 
ary-June term of 1911. These data, however, in the case of 
6B losses cover 4,409 pupils; in the case of losses between 
the 6B-7A grades, 6,270 pupils; in the case of losses from 
the 7A-8B grades, 12,417; in the case of relative rate of 
promotion, 12,417; in the case of terms of work lost and 
gained, 2,018 graduates—numbers sufficiently large and  
-P-A-G-E-42
  
  32 Problems in Elementary School Administration 
taken from schools operating under conditions sufficiently 
similar to the conditions surrounding intermediate schools 
to indicate tendencies. Final conclusions with respect to 
the educational efficiency of schools having all grades and 
intermediate schools would, of course, require the collection 
of data similar to the above for a number of terms.
-P-A-G-E-43
  
CHAPTER II 
ECONOMY OF THE INTERMEDIATE SCHOOL 
pe N should be conducted as economically as 
possible. Hence, in carrying on any given kind of 
school work, the expense of different ways of accomplishing 
the same end should be considered. 
Any difference in the expense of schools having all grades 
and intermediate schools is due almost exclusively to dif- 
ferences in (1) the number of schoolrooms needed; (2) 
the number of teachers required; and (3) the supplies and 
equipment needed to instruct a given number of seventh 
and eighth year pupils. Comparisons with respect to these 
three points will, therefore, bring out the difference between 
the cost of instructing seventh and eighth year pupils in 
these two kinds of schools. 
The schools having all grades selected for the purpose of 
these comparisons are, with few exceptions, the same as 
those selected for the foregoing comparisons with respect to 
educational efficiency. Their selection, however, does not 
imply the suggestion that the 7A-8B pupils in them could 
be brought into intermediate schools. Hence, the compari- 
sons to be made will merely indicate what the probable sav- 
ing would be where conditions are such that 7A-8B children 
in schools having all grades can be brought into intermedi- 
ate schools. 
(1) DIFFERENCE IN THE NUMBER OF SCHOOLROOMS 
REQUIRED 
To instruct seventh and eighth year pupils, at least four 
different kinds of schoolrooms are needed: regular class- 
33  
-P-A-G-E-44
34 Problems in Elementary School Administration 
rooms, manual training shops, cooking rooms, and gym- 
nasiums. 
  Difference in Number of Regular Classrooms Required 
Table VII shows for the February-June term of 1911, 
the enrollment in 7A-8B classes in schools having all grades, 
the number of regular classrooms used in instructing these 
classes, and the average number of 7A-8B pupils per regu- 
lar classroom. The table also shows the same facts for 
intermediate schools 24, 159, and 62. 
The average number of 7A-8B pupils per classroom 
varies, as shown by Table VII, in the foregoing schools 
from thirty-five to fifty-two. These variations are due to 
differences in size of classrooms and to the particular num- 
ber of 7A-8B pupils to be instructed.

  It will also be observed that the average number of pupils 
per classroom in schools having all grades is 43.31, in inter- 
mediate schools, 45.75—an average difference in favor of 
the intermediate school of 2.44 pupils. Hence, had the 
average number of pupils per classroom been the same in 
the two kinds of schools, to provide for the 6,973 7A-8B 
pupils in schools having all grades would have required only 
152.42 classrooms (6,973 -- 45.75) instead of 161, or 8.58 
fewer than were used. 
It therefore appears that when 7A-8B pupils are brought 
together in intermediate schools the number of regular 
classrooms required is 5.33 per cent. (8.58+-161) less than 
when seventh and eighth year pupils are taught in schools 
having all grades.? 
1It will be observed that the average number of pupils per classroom 
in both schools having all grades and intermediate schools is high. 
Because comparisons are made under these conditions, the inference 
should not be drawn that we favor overcrowded classrooms. We

Difference in the Number of Manual Training Shops 
Required 
Table VIII shows, as of April, 1911, for schools having 
all grades the number of single shops, the number of seventh 
and eighth year pupils instructed in each shop, and the 
average number instructed per shop. The table also shows 
the same facts for intermediate schools 24 and 62. Inter- 
mediate school 159 is a girls’ school, and hence has no shop. 
In schools having all grades the average number of sev- 
enth and eighth year pupils instructed per shop is 260; in 
intermediate schools, 358—an average difference in favor 
of intermediate schools of ninety-eight pupils. Had the 
same average prevailed as prevailed in intermediate schools, 
to provide for the 4,945 seventh and eighth year pupils in 
schools having all grades, only 13.81 shops (4,945--358) 
instead of nineteen would have been required, or 5.19 
fewer than were used. It therefore requires 27.32 per cent. 
(5.19 +19) fewer shops to care for a given number of 
seventh and eighth grade pupils in intermediate schools 
than to care for the same number of such pupils in schools 
having all grades. 
Manual training is regularly taught only in the seventh 
and eighth years. The Board of Superintendents, however, 
may authorize the giving of such instruction to other than 
seventh and eighth year pupils. This is done particularly in 
case of over-age boys in the 6A and 6B grades. Manual 
training shops may consequently be used by other than 
seventh and eighth year pupils. 
Table IX shows, as of April, 1911, for schools having all 
grades, the number of single shops, the total number of 
pupils instructed in each shop, and the average number in- 
favor the opposite. The comparisons are made on the assumption 
that whatever the average number of pupils per classroom in theory, 
in practice the difference in the actual number of pupils per classroom 
in schools having all grades and in intermediate schools would be 
similar to the difference found for the February-June term, I911.

structed per shop. The table also shows the same facts for 
intermediate schools 24 and 62. (See page 39.) 
In schools having all grades the average number of all 
pupils instructed per shop was 289; in intermediate schools, 
358—an average difference in favor of intermediate schools 
of sixty-nine pupils. Had the same average prevailed as 
prevailed in intermediate schools, to provide for the total 
of 5,501 pupils in schools having all grades, only 15.37 
shops (5,501-+-358) instead of nineteen would have been 
required, or 3.63 fewer than were used. 
When, therefore, manual training is extended to other 
than seventh and eighth year pupils, thus increasing the 
total use of shops, only 19.11 per cent. (3.6319) fewer 
shops are required in intermediate schools than in schools 
having all grades, to provide for the same number of 
pupils.t 
Hence, intermediate schools require 27.32 per cent. (see 
above) fewer shops than schools having all grades, only 
when the instruction of seventh and eighth year pupils alone 
is taken into account. 
Difference in the Number of Cooking Rooms Required 
Owing to a lack of uniformity in the method of using 
cooking rooms, it is impossible to compare intermediate 
schools and schools having all grades with respect to the 
number of seventh and eighth year pupils taught per cook- 
ing room. In schools such as 13, 71, 72, and 137, Manhat- 
tan, the group method of instruction is followed, i. e., in- 
stead of doing the work themselves, the pupils observe cook- 
ing done in whole or in part by the teacher. In some 
schools, such as 90, 159, and 188 G, due to the lack of ade- 
quate individual equipment, children are given considerable 
theory; this reduces by one half or one third the amount of 
actual cooking. In other schools, the entire time assigned

to the study is given to cooking. It is possible, however, 
to compare schools having all grades and intermediate 
schools with reference to the periods per week cooking 
rooms are used. 
Table X shows, as of April, 1911, for schools having all 
grades the number of cooking rooms; the number of single 
periods each cooking room was used per week for the in- 
struction of seventh and eighth year pupils; and the average 
number of single periods per week in use. The table also 
shows the same facts for intermediate schools 62 and 159. 
(See p. 40.) 
Table X shows that in schools having all grades, cooking 
rooms were used in the instruction of seventh and eighth 
year pupils on the average 27.15 single periods per week; 
in intermediate schools, 32.75—an average difference in 
favor of intermediate schools of 5.60 periods. Had the 
same average prevailed as prevailed in intermediate schools, 
the 353 periods of instruction given in schools having all 
grades could have been given in 10.78 cooking rooms 
(353 + 32-75) instead of thirteen, or in 2.22 fewer than 
were used. 
It therefore appears that 17.10 per cent. (2.22+13) 
fewer cooking rooms are required to provide for a given 
number of seventh and eighth year pupils in intermediate 
schools than to provide for the same number of such pupils 
in schools having all grades. 
Like manual training, cooking is regularly taught only in 
the seventh and eighth years. The Board of Superin- 
tendents may, however, authorize the giving of cooking to 
other pupils. This is done particularly in case of over-age 
girls in the 6A and 6B grades. Cooking rooms may conse- 
quently be used by other than seventh and eighth year 
pupils.

single periods each cooking room was used per week, and 
the average number of single periods per week in use. 
This table also shows the same facts for intermediate 
schools 62 and 159. 
Cooking rooms are used on the average, in schools having 
all grades, a total of 30.69 single periods per week; in inter- 
mediate schools, 32.75—an average difference in favor of 
intermediate schools of 2.06 single periods. Had the same 
average prevailed in the two kinds of schools, the total of 
399 periods of instruction given in schools having all grades 
could have been given in 12.18 cooking rooms (399--32.75) 
instead of thirteen, or in .82 fewer than were used. 
When the total use of cooking rooms in intermediate 
schools is compared with the total use in schools having all 
grades, it appears that only 6.31 per cent. (.82+-13) fewer 
are required in intermediate schools than in schools having 
all grades to instruct the same number of pupils. 
Hence, it is only when the instruction of seventh and 
eighth year pupils is taken into account that intermediate 
schools require 17.10 per cent. (see pages 41-42) fewer 
cooking rooms than schools having all grades. 
The foregoing difference of 27.32 per cent. in the number 
of shops and 17.10 per cent. in the number of cooking rooms 
needed by intermediate schools and by schools having all 
grades, to instruct a given number of seventh and eighth 
year pupils, is due to the fact that shops and cooking rooms 
in the intermediate schools are kept in use practically the 
entire school day. In consequence, they cannot be used to 
instruct pupils below the 7A grade, even were it practical 
to send such pupils to an intermediate school merely for 
manual training and cooking. To provide for the pupils 
below the 7A grade now instructed in schools having all 
grades would, therefore, require shops and cooking rooms 
in addition to those needed in the intermediate schools. 
Hence, in considering the saving in shops and cooking 
rooms that might be effected by bringing 7A-8B pupils into 
 
-P-A-G-E-54
  44. Problems in Elementary School Administration 
intermediate schools, the use of shops and cooking rooms 
to instruct other than seventh and eighth year pupils in 
schools having all grades should be taken into account (see 
the first note, page 45). Moreover, should intermediate 
schools be made universal and manual training and cooking 
be made general for over-age 6A-6B pupils, the saving in 
shops and cooking rooms might be less than the above esti- 
mates, even when the instruction of pupils below the 7A is 
taken into account, because under such conditions, to pro- 
vide manual training and cooking for such over-age pupils 
might require relatively more shops and cooking rooms 
than under present conditions. 
Difference in the Number of Gymnasiums Required 
Table XII gives the number of gymnasiums in schools 
having all grades, the number of single periods per week 
each was used during the February-June term, 1911, for the 
instruction of seventh and eighth year pupils, and the aver- 
age number of single periods per week in use. The table 
also shows the same facts for intermediate schools 24, 159, 
and 62. (See page 45.) 
Gymnasiums, it appears, are used in schools having all 
grades on the average 34.17 single periods per week; in 
intermediate schools, 41.75—an average difference in fa- 
vor of intermediate schools of 7.58 single periods. 
Had the same average prevailed in the two kinds of 
schools, the total of 205 periods of instruction in schools 
having all grades could have been given in 4.91 gymnasiums 
(205-+-41.75) instead of six, or in 18.17 per cent. fewer 
gymnasiums than were used. 
Summary 
In view of the foregoing data, it appears that to provide 
for a given number of 7A-8B pupils in intermediate schools 
requires: 
 
-P-A-G-E-55
  
Economy of the Intermediate School 45 
5.33 per cent. fewer regular classrooms

and

The saving in money, represented by these differences in 
the number of rooms required in intermediate schools and 
in schools having all grades, is brought out, if these differ- 
ences are considered in relation to caring for 20,000 7A-8B 
pupils.2 On the basis of the rooms required to care for the

To care for 20,000 7A-8B pupils, there is a difference of 
forty-nine in the number of rooms needed in these two 
kinds of schools—a difference of 8.70 per cent. (49563) 
in favor of intermediate schools; when the use of shops and 
cooking rooms in schools having all grades to instruct other 
than seventh and eighth year pupils is taken into account, 
there is a difference of thirty-eight, or 6.75 per cent., in the 
rooms required. This difference, at the least of thirty- 
eight rooms, represents not less than $400,000 ? in original

the site $70,000. These estimates are based on the cost of new build- 
ings as given in the Corporate Stock Requirements submitted by the 
Board of Education, March, 1911, and on the cost of sites, as given 
in the annual Financial and Statistical Report of the Board of Edu- 
cation for 1910.

investment, and an annual difference of 6.88 per cent. in cost 
of upkeep and operating expenses. 
(2) DIFFERENCE IN THE NUMBER OF TEACHERS REQUIRED 
In the instruction of seventh and eighth year pupils, three 
kinds of teachers are employed: regular class teachers, man- 
ual training teachers, and cooking teachers. 
Difference in the Number of Regular Class Teachers 
Required 
Table XIII shows, for the February-June term of 1911, 
the enrollment of 7A, 7B, 8A, and 8B classes in schools hav- 
ing all grades, the number of regular class teachers in each 
grade, and the average number of pupils per teacher. The 
table also shows the same facts for intermediate schools 24, 
159, and 62. (See page 48.) 
It will be observed that the number of pupils per teacher 
in schools having all grades ranges from thirty-two to 
fifty-five, and that there were at least twenty over-size 
classes—classes having an enrollment of more than fifty 
pupils. 
The average number of pupils per regular class teacher in 
schools having all grades is 43.31; in intermediate schools, 
45.75—an average difference in favor of intermediate 
schools of 2.44 pupils. Hence, had the average number of 
pupils per regular class teacher been the same as in inter- 
mediate schools, the 6,973 7A-8B pupils in schools having 
all grades would have been instructed by 152.42 teachers 
(6,973-+45-75) instead of 161, or by 8.58 fewer teachers 
than were engaged. Further, had these 6,973 pupils been 
in intermediate schools, it would have been possible, with- 
out increasing the number of teachers, to have reduced the 
foregoing over-size classes, whereas in schools having all 
grades to have done this would have required additional 
teachers.

It therefore appears that to instruct the same number of 
7A-8B pupils, intermediate schools require fewer regular 
class teachers than schools having all grades by 5.33 per 
cent. (8.58161). Also that classes can be made more 
nearly uniform in size. This tends to equalize opportunity 
and to add to the effectiveness of the instruction. 
Difference in the Number of Manual Training Teachers 
Required 
Table XIV shows, as of April, 1911, for schools having 
all grades, the number of seventh and eighth year pupils in- 
structed in manual training, the number of manual training 
teachers giving their whole time to the instruction of seventh 
and eighth year pupils, and the average number of seventh 
and eighth year pupils per teacher. The table also shows 
the same facts for intermediate schools 24 and 62. 
The average number of seventh and eighth year pupils 
per manual training teacher in schools having all grades is 
338; in intermediate schools, 368—an average difference 
of thirty pupils. Hence, had the same number of pupils 
been instructed per manual training teacher in schools hav- 
ing all grades as were instructed in intermediate schools, to 
have taught manual training to the 4,945 seventh and 
eighth year pupils in schools having all grades would have 
required 13.44 manual training teachers (4,945--368) in- 
stead of 14.61, or 1.17 fewer than were engaged. 
It therefore appears that intermediate schools need fewer 
manual training teachers than schools having all grades by 
8.01 per cent. (1.17-+-14.61) to give shopwork to the same 
number of seventh and eighth year pupils. + 
1The extension of manual training and cooking to over-age 6A-6B 
pupils might, as stated above, lessen the estimated saving in manual 
training and cooking rooms, but such an extension would not affect 
the estimated saving in manual training and cooking teachers, because 
this extension would in no wise affect the number of teachers required 
to instruct a given number of 7A-8B pupils in the two kinds of schools.

Economy of the Intermediate School 51 
Difference in the Number of Cooking Teachers Required 
Owing to differences in cooking instruction, it is impos- 
sible to compare the number of cooking teachers needed, in 
schools having all grades and intermediate schools, to in- 
struct the same number of seventh and eighth year pupils. 
Cooking classes are, however, organized and conducted in 
the same way as classes in manual training, and the same 
general conditions affect the size of class and the number 
of pupils per teacher. 
It is, therefore, fair to infer that were it possible to com- 
pare the number of cooking teachers required, in schools 
having all grades and in intermediate schools, to teach a 
given number of seventh and eighth year pupils, the same 
difference would be found in the number of cooking teachers 
needed as is found in the number of manual training teach- 
ers required—that is, it is but fair to infer that intermediate 
schools require fewer cooking teachers than schools having 
all grades by 8.01 per cent. to give cooking to the same 
number of seventh and eighth year pupils. 
Summary 
In view of the foregoing data, it appears that to instruct 
a given number of 7A-8B pupils in intermediate schools, in 
comparison with instructing the same number of such pupils 
in schools having all grades, requires: 
5.33 per cent. fewer regular class teachers 
8.01 per cent. fewer manual training teachers 
8.01 per cent. fewer cooking teachers 
The saving in money, represented by these differences in 
the number of teachers required in intermediate schools 
and in schools having all grades, is brought out, if these dif- 
ferences are considered in relation to instructing 20,000

In caring for 20,000 7A-8B pupils, there is a difference of 
twenty-eight in the number of teachers required in these 
two kinds of schools—a difference of 5.36 per cent. 
(28+-522) in favor of intermediate schools. This differ- 
ence of twenty-eight teachers represents an annual differ- 
ence in cost of not less than $35,000.” 
(3) DIFFERENCE IN THE AMOUNT OF SUPPLIES AND EQUIP- 
MENT REQUIRED 
The term “supplies” is used by the Board of Education to 
include all material aids to instruction. A distinction, how- 
ever, should be drawn between supplies which are directly 
consumed by pupils—for example, paper pads, pencils, ink, 
textbooks, etc.—and supplies which are to a greater or less 
extent permanent—for example, maps, globes, science ap- 
paratus, gymnasium, cooking room, and shop equipment. 
It is obvious that bringing 7A-8B pupils into intermediate 
schools would effect no saving in supplies which are directly 
consumed. It is, however, equally obvious that great sav- 
ing would thereby be effected in supplies which are to a

greater or less extent permanent. The saving on equipment 
in shops, cooking rooms, and gymnasiums would be in di- 
rect relation to the difference in the number of these re- 
quired in intermediate schools and in schools having all 
grades to instruct a given number of 7A-8B pupils. Hence, 
there would be a saving of 19.11 per cent. or 27.32 per cent. 
on equipment for shops; of 6.31 per cent. or 17.10 per 
cent. on equipment for cooking rooms—according as the 
use of shops and cooking rooms in schools having all grades 
to instruct other than seventh and eighth year pupils is 
taken into account or disregarded—and a saving of 18.17 
per cent. on equipment for gymnasiums. 
It was impossible to obtain data on what is spent for 
seventh and eighth year pupils on such permanent equip- 
ment as maps, globes, science apparatus, etc. Hence, it is 
impossible to estimate what saving would be effected by 
bringing 7A-8B pupils into intermediate schools. This sav- 
ing would, however, be no inconsiderable sum. 
SUMMARY OF THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS 
Schools having all grades and intermediate schools have 
been compared with respect to economic efficiency on three 
points : 
1. The number of schoolrooms required. 
2. The number of teachers required. 
3. The amount of equipment required. 
It has been shown: 
(a) That intermediate schools require fewer rooms by 
8.70 per cent. or by 6.75 per cent. + 
(b) That intermediate schools require fewer teachers 
by 5.36 per cent. 
1 According as the use of shops and cooking rooms in schools having 
all grades to instruct other than seventh and eighth year pupils is 
disregarded or taken into account.

(c) That intermediate schools require less equipment 
in shops by 19.11 per cent. or by 27.32 per cent.,? 
in cooking rooms by 6.31 per cent. or by 17.10 
per cent.,? and in gymnasiums by 18.17 per cent. 
In view of these differences in requirements, and hence 
differences in cost, could 20,000 7A-8B pupils be brought 
into intermediate schools? the immediate saving would be 
sufficient to provide at the very least for the erection of a 
school building of thirty-nine rooms, and for the annual 
total cost of operating such a school.®

  CHAPTER III 
EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES AFFORDED BY 
THE INTERMEDIATE SCHOOL 
HE intermediate school should not be judged, how- 
ever, only by what it now is, but also by what it might 
become. 
Intermediate schools, at the present time, are conducted 
in most ways like schools having all grades. The two kinds 
of schools have the same course of study for the seventh 
and eighth years, the same departmental organization, and 
practically the same methods of classifying and promoting 
pupils. In a word, the intermediate school is merely an en- 
largement, with slight modifications, of the seventh and 
eighth grades of schools having all classes. But to limit 
the activities of the intermediate school in this way is to 
fail to take advantage of important educational opportuni- 
ties it may be made to afford. 
These educational opportunities suggest themselves when 
we consider the wisdom of offering to seventh and eighth 
year pupils more than one course of study; of a better adap- 
tation of the instruction to the two sexes; of a more thor- 
oughgoing classification of pupils; of a more just method of 
promotion; and of a better adaptation to the needs of sev- 
enth and eighth year pupils of certain general features of 
school organization. 
OPPORTUNITY TO OFFER DIFFERENT COURSES OF STUDY 
The wisdom of offering more than one course of study in 
the elementary schools of New York City to seventh and 
55
-P-A-G-E-66
  56 Problems in Elementary School Administration 
eighth year pupils is discussed elsewhere.1 By reason of 
the large number of pupils in attendance in the same grade, 
the intermediate school affords peculiar opportunity for 
different courses of study. As is pointed out in our discus- 
sion on the course of study, these courses meet the needs of 
three classes of pupils: (a) those who are planning to go to 
an “academic” or “general” high school, and perhaps to 
college; (b) those who look forward to entering a voca- 
tional high school; and (c) those who intend, as soon as 
they are fourteen years old, to enter an elementary voca- 
tional school, or who must leave or choose to leave school 
as soon as they are legally exempt from further school at- 
tendance. In all these courses the separate educational 
needs of the two sexes, as well as their common needs, 
should be provided for, as is indicated in the next section. 
OPPORTUNITY TO ADAPT THE INSTRUCTION TO THE TWO 
SEXES AND TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF HIGH SCHOOLS 
AND VOCATIONAL SCHOOLS 
The differences between boys and girls point to the neces- 
sity of differences in the instruction they should receive. 
The desirability of making the instruction of boys and 
girls different is already recognized in providing for boys 
manual training, and for girls cooking and sewing; also 
in providing different physical training for boys and for 
girls. This differentiation of work, however, should be 
carried much further in the elementary school than it now 
is. The intermediate school affords particular opportunity 
to differentiate, according to the needs of the two sexes, 
both in the general scope of the different courses of study 
and in their details. 
Good opportunity is also afforded by the intermediate 
school to experiment with courses of study, to the end that 
these may on the one hand be adapted to the capacities, de- 
sires, and intentions of different groups of children, and 
1See Part II, pages 114-117. 
 
-P-A-G-E-67
Educational Opportunities 57 
may on the other hand be brought to articulate so closely 
with the courses in high schools and vocational schools, 
that pupils graduating from the intermediate school are 
well prepared to profit by and do the work of the particular 
kind of subsequent school they may enter. 
Again, by reason of the number of children in intermedi- 
ate schools who are approaching the time when they must 
choose a pursuit, and who need advice that they may choose 
wisely, and by reason of the number of teachers having to 
deal only with such children, the intermediate school affords 
the best possible opportunity to experiment with and to de- 
velop systematic vocational guidance. 
Hence, in judging of the worth of the intermediate school, 
the opportunity it affords to adapt the instruction to the 
needs of the two sexes, and to the needs of different groups 
of children, and to lay the foundation for work in a subse- 
quent school should be given serious consideration. 
OPPORTUNITY TO CLASSIFY PUPILS ACCORDING TO ABILITY 
In schools having all grades, it is impracticable, because 
of numbers, to group pupils within a particular grade, to 
any considerable extent, according to ability. Children of 
widely different capacity must, in consequence, work in the 
same class, with the inevitable result that one part of the 
class is kept comfortably busy; a second part has too much * 
to do, and a third part too little. 
But, so far as possible, every child has the right to work 
at all times up to his capacity. The intermediate schools 
can supply such conditions of work more easily than other 
schools; for, by reason of numbers, the pupils of a given 
grade may at least be grouped as slow pupils, normal pupils, 
and exceptionally bright pupils, and the instruction adapted 
to the requirements of each group. 
Further, in schools having all grades, when a pupil is not 
promoted, he must, because of the relatively few failing in a 
given grade, take the work over with pupils who are in the 
 
-P-A-G-E-68
  58 Problems in Elementary School Administration 
class for the first time. The pupil consequently has no op- 
portunity to pay special attention to the particular subjects 
in which he has failed. In the intermediate school, how- 
ever, it is possible, by reason of numbers, to bring together 
into one class children who have failed in the same branches. 
Such a grouping affords opportunity to help pupils where 
ace is need, and hence to strengthen them where they are 
weak. 
OPPORTUNITY FOR PROMOTION BY STUDIES 
In schools having all classes, children are promoted by 
grades. Hence, if a pupil is not advanced, he must go over 
a second time all the work of the grade instead of having 
to repeat only the studies in which he is deficient. 
The pupil has the right, so far as possible, to be ad- 
vanced as rapidly or as slowly as his several abilities permit 
or require. His advancement in all studies, therefore, 
ought not to be conditioned by his weakness in certain 
branches. Whether promotion by grades is necessarily in- 
herent in schools having all grades should be made the 
subject of consideration. However that may be, the inter- 
mediate school can readily adopt such a system of promo- 
tion that each child may go forward whenever he is pre- 
pared to advance. That is, the intermediate school can be 
so organized that promotions are made by studies rather 
than by grades. The administrative difficulties of promo- 
tion by studies should be no greater in the intermediate 
school than they are in the high school; and no one would 
think of promoting high-school pupils otherwise than by 
subjects. 
OPPORTUNITY TO ADAPT TO THE NEEDS OF SEVENTH AND 
EIGHTH YEAR PUPILS CERTAIN GENERAL FEATURES OF 
SCHOOL ORGANIZATION 
It is well understood that at about the age of twelve or 
fourteen years boys and girls need a kind of care and dis- 
 
-P-A-G-E-69
  Educational Opportunities 59 
cipline different from the care and discipline of younger 
children. In schools having all classes, relatively the same 
organization prevails throughout the school. To be sure, 
certain modifications are made in favor of seventh and 
eighth year pupils—for example, departmental teaching— 
but these modifications must necessarily be few. The inter- 
mediate school, however, having to do only with seventh and 
eighth year pupils, can adapt its organization to the par- 
ticular needs of children passing from late childhood into 
the period of early youth. 
The intermediate school may be so organized that larger 
place is given than it is possible to give in the average school 
having all grades to athletics and competitive games, to 
club work, and to social activities; larger opportunity can 
be given for pupil self-government; larger individual free- 
dom of thought and action can also be permitted. In a 
word, the intermediate school can be so organized, such 
opportunity can be given for the expression of spontaneity, 
and for the exercise of initiative, judgment, and self-direc- 
tion, that school life will make a stronger appeal to seventh 
and eighth year pupils than it now does, as a rule, in most 
schools. The need of this stronger appeal is revealed in 
the fact that 4,218 7A-8B boys and 3,948 7A-8B girls, a 
total of 8,166 7A-8B pupils, left the elementary schools of 
the City of New York during the spring term of 1911 with- 
out completing these grades. 
PROBABLE EFFECTS OF REALIZING THE FOREGOING 
POSSIBILITIES 
Certain of the foregoing possibilities are now being re- 
alized, to a limited extent, in intermediate schools—notably 
in Public School Number 62; but should different courses 
of study be introduced; should a differentiation of the in- 
struction for boys and girls be made and the courses of 
study be made to articulate with high schools and vocational 
1 From reports made to the Committee on School Inquiry, June, 1911.
-P-A-G-E-70
60 Problems in Elementary School Administration 
schools; should pupils within a grade be grouped according 
to ability; should promotion by studies be inaugurated ; 
should an organization be developed, that is adapted to the 
particular needs of seventh and eighth year pupils, and 
should the effects of these innovations be studied carefully 
for a series of terms, it would be found, it is believed, that 
such an intermediate school would not only be far more 
efficient in caring for seventh and eighth year pupils than 
a school having all grades, but also far more efficient than 
are the intermediate schools already established. 
LOCATION AND ESTABLISHMENT OF AN INTERMEDIATE 
SCHOOL 
Finally, there are two fundamental conditions that di- 
rectly influence the location of an intermediate school: first, 
there must be adequate school provision within ready reach 
of the 1A-6B pupils who would live in the immediate vicin- 
ity of the intermediate school; and, second, there must be 
a sufficient number of 7A-8B pupils within ready walking 
distance to justify the establishment of such a school. 
A serious difficulty to be reckoned with in the establish- 
ment of intermediate schools is the attitude of the princi- 
pals and of the teachers in the schools affected. The sched- 
ule of salaries is higher for 7A-8B than for rA-6B teachers; 
also, in schools having from six to seventeen rooms in which 
there are grades above the 6B, the head teacher or as- 
sistant principal in charge is relieved from teaching a class. 
There is necessarily, however, no such exemption in schools 
having the same number of rooms but in which the highest 
grade is the 6B.1_ It is, therefore, only natural, when the 
7A-8B grades are removed from given schools in order to 
organize an intermediate school, that the principals and the 
teachers of these schools feel that their professional stand- 
ing is unfavorably affected. Unless some way is found to 
allay this feeling it will continue to make difficult the active 
1 Schedule of Teachers’ Salaries, 1912, pages 8 and 9. 
 
-P-A-G-E-71
    Educational Opportunities 61 
extension of the intermediate school. In planning to in- 
crease the number of intermediate schools, there is also the 
question, which should be carefully considered, of the effect 
of removing from a school seventh and eighth year pupils. 
The question to be considered is whether the removal of 
seventh and eighth year pupils affects favorably or unfavor- 
ably the conduct, the ambition, and the work of younger 
children. 
RECOMMENDATIONS 
In view of the educational and economic efficiency of the 
intermediate schools now in existence, when judged on the 
basis of the data collected for the February-June term, 
IgI1, and in view of the educational possibilities of such 
schools, we recommend : 
(1) That similar data be collected for a number of 
terms, and should the foregoing findings be sub- 
stantiated, we would further recommend: 
(2) That an immediate study be made by the Board of 
Education of all localities where conditions seem 
favorable to the establishment of intermediate 
schools. 
(3) That intermediate schools be established wherever 
conditions are favorable. 
(4) That, when established, intermediate schools should 
not only serve the purpose they now serve, but 
should be planned and carried on so as to aim at 
the fuller realization of the educational oppor- 
tunities they may be made to afford, as outlined 
in this report. 
(5) That special care be taken to maintain sympathetic 
relations between the intermediate schools and the 
contributing schools on the one hand, and the 
closest articulation possible with high schools and 
   
-P-A-G-E-72

(6) vocational schools on the other; and that the pe- 
culiar opportunity to develop systematic vocational 
guidance be fully utilized. 
That complete records of the work and cost of such 
schools be kept and that these records be used to 
improve intermediate schools and to judge of their 
efficiency.

CHAPTER IV 
THE PROBLEM OF PROMOTION AND NON- 
PROMOTION 
HE State, through its Compulsory Education Law, 
seeks to guarantee to each child of the City of New 
York, by the time he is fourteen years old, an education 
equal to graduation from the elementary school. Physical 
and mental defects, as well as conditions in the home and 
in the school, which militate against children completing 
the elementary school course of study are, therefore, of 
both social and educational interest. 
The factors which contribute to prevent children from 
graduating from the elementary schools of the City of New 
York by the time they are fourteen years of age, as is con- 
templated by the Compulsory Education Law, fall under 
three heads : late entrance into school, slow progress through 
the school, and late entrance and slow progress together. 
Failure to complete the elementary school course of study 
by the fourteenth year, in so far as this is due to slow prog- 
ress, is the direct result of the child’s failure to secure regu- 
lar promotion. To determine the causes which prevent 
children from receiving promotion, eight committees were 
appointed, in the fall of 1909, by the City Superintendent of 
Schools. These eight committees were in substantial ac- 
cord in reporting the following, among others, as the chief 
causes of failure on the part of pupils to secure regular pro- 
motion :?

  66 Problems in Elementary School Administration 
“Part time, which prevents pupils from doing the work 
of the lower grades thoroughly.” 
“Excessive size of classes, which prevents teachers giving 
necessary individual instruction.” 
“Irregular attendance. Due to poor home conditions; 
looseness of parental control; ignorance of parents; 
lack of opportunities for home study; poverty of 
home, requiring pupils’ assistance; sickness of other 
members of the family; lack of proper clothing; 
feeble health of individual pupils; poverty of sur- 
roundings.” 
“Late entrance into school. Due to two causes: the pres- 
ence of immigrant children, and the fact that many 
children are sent to private schools before they 
enter the public schools.” 
“Sluggish mentality. Sometimes this feature takes the 
form of positive mental defect, and sometimes it 
characterizes pupils as slow in receptivity and re- 
sponse. Sometimes it takes the form of moral de- 
fects, such as dishonesty, lying, and cheating, which 
are intensified by improper reading, the following 
of bad examples, and petty defiance of law in the 
streets.” 
“Ignorance of the English language. Due to foreign 
birth and to the fact that English is not the lan- 
guage of the home.” 
From conference with members of the foregoing com- 
mittees, it was learned that no comprehensive study of the 
causes of non-promotion was made by these committees, 
and that their conclusions were based on the personal im- 
pressions of the several members. 
The studies made of the causes of non-promotion up to 
the present time may be characterized as descriptive studies, 
or as preliminary surveys. They are, nevertheless, very 
 
-P-A-G-E-77
  Promotion and Non-Promotion 67 
valuable. Their worth lies, however, in focusing the at- 
tention of teachers and superintendents on the problem of 
non-promotion, in suggesting probable causes, and in indi- 
cating where improvements should be made and the need 
of further investigation, rather than in having determined 
finally the causes of non-promotion and the extent to which 
non-promotion is due to each cause. 
Even the data collected, and herewith reported in the fol- 
lowing tables, supply no adequate basis for final conclusions. 
Because, although there appears to be, for example, a direct 
connection between the per cent. of promotion and the num- 
ber of days absent, there is no way of telling from the table 
on absence whether part of the difference in the per cent. 
of promotion might not be due to causes other than absence 
—to the fact that pupils were in different kinds of classes 
(in part-time classes or whole-time classes), or in classes of 
different sizes, or were of different ages, or were of differ- 
ent nationalities. Until the retarding force of these and 
other probable causes is equalized or neutralized—i. e., until 
the pupils in the several groups, when grouped, for example, 
on the basis of the number of days absent, are from the 
same kind of class, from classes of the same size, are of the 
same age, of the same sex, of the same nationality—until 
this is done—and it was impossible to do it in this investi- 
gation—it is unscientific to draw more than tentative con- 
clusions about the causes of non-promotion and the retard- 
ing force of particular causes. 
Though no final conclusions can be properly drawn from 
the collected data, with regard to the causes of non-promo- 
tion or with reference to what extent non-promotion is due 
to each cause, these data do supply the basis for tentative 
conclusions, and for certain recommendations, and supply, 
also, a fund of valuable information. 
The register in regular classes at the end of the February- 
June term, 1911, the number promoted, and the number not 
promoted—the basis of this report—were, for the several 
grades and the sexes, as follows:

Promotions are, however, also made during the course of

RATE OF PROMOTION IN EACH BOROUGH AND IN THE ENTIRE 
CITY OF NEW YORK 
The City of New York includes the Boroughs of Man- 
hattan, Brooklyn, The Bronx, Queens, and Richmond. 
Table XVI gives for each of the boroughs and for the 
Greater City the per cent. of promotion by grades at the end 
of the February-June term, 1911. 
The difference between the per cent. of total promotion 
in the several boroughs, it will be observed, is small. The 
lowest per cent. of total promotion was, in Brooklyn, 88.22 
per cent., and the highest, in Queens, 89.47 per cent—a 
variation of but 1.25 per cent. 
In each of the boroughs the lowest per cent. of promotion 
was in the 1A, and the highest in the 8B grade, but, within 
the same grade, the rate of promotion varied little among 
the boroughs. The per cent. of promotion ranged in the 
97%—a variation of 1.60% 
13%—a variation of 3.21% 1A from 75.37% to 76. 
1B from 86.92% to go.

In the great majority of the grades in the schools of each |

between 88 per cent. and gt per cent., while the most com- 
mon per cent. of promotion was from 89 per cent. to 90 
per cent. 
In the Greater City, as in the several boroughs, the lowest 
per cent. of promotion was in the 1A, and the highest in 
the 8B grade. In the remaining fourteen grades the rate 
of promotion was from 87 per cent. to 88 per cent., in one 
grade; from 88 per cent. to 89 per cent., in two; from 89 
to 90 per cent., in eight; and from go per cent. to 91 per 
cent., in three. With the exception of the 1A and the 8B 
grades, the most frequent rate of promotion, both in the 
Greater City and in the boroughs, was, therefore, from 89 | 
per cent. to go per cent.

RATE OF PROMOTION IN THE IA GRADE 
The rate of promotion, as we have seen (Table XVI), 
was the lowest in the 1A grade. In the other grades, taken 
together, only one child in ten failed of promotion, but in 
the 1A almost each fourth child failed of advancement, with 
the result that 10,314 1A pupils were left back in June to 
reénter this grade in September, to overcrowd classes, and 
to congest the school.t 
The requirements of the 1A grade should be relatively no 
higher than the requirements of other grades; hence, condi- 
tions being the same, the rate of promotion should be no 
lower. As a matter of fact, however, the rate of promotion 
for the 1A grade is, as a rule, lower than for other grades. 
Whether this is necessarily so is a matter of doubt, and de- 
serves careful investigation. 
From conferences with administrative officials, principals, 
and teachers, it was learned that they held the low rate of 
promotion in the rA grade due to (a) the number of pupils 
unable to use the English language; (b) immaturity of pu- 
pils; (c) over-size classes; (d) part-time classes, and (e) 
irregular attendance and late entrance during the course of 
the term. 
Inability to Use the English Language as a Factor 
The total register of the 1A grade, June 30, 1911, was 
43,012. According to the reports made to us, there were 
3,648 1A pupils who were unable to use the English lan- 
guage on entrance to the grade,” leaving 39,364 1A pupils 
who, in the opinion of the teachers, had no unusual difficulty 
with our language. Of these 39,364, 30,531 were promoted, 
and 8,833 were not promoted. Hence, the rate of promo- 
tion for 1A pupils, when all those unable to use the English 
language are excluded, was 77.56 per cent., which is but 
1See Table XV, page 68. 2See Table XLII, page 157.
-P-A-G-E-83
  ~ Promotion and Non-Promotion 73 
1.54 per cent. higher than the rate (76.02 per cent.) for 
the grade as a whole.* 
Assuming that all other conditions affecting promotion 
and non-promotion were the same for the two groups of 
children—those able, and those unable, to use the English 
language—the per cent. of promotion in the 1A grade was, 
therefore, lower by but 1.54 per cent. than it otherwise 
would have been, because of the presence of 1A pupils un- 
able to use the English language. Hence, inability of pupils 
to use the English language on entrance to the grade is, at 
best, but a minor factor in causing the low rate of promotion 
in the 1A grade.?   
Immaturity as a Factor 
The maturity of a child may be judged (a) in view of his 
physical development; (b) in view of his mental develop- 
ment; and (c) in view of his age. Maturity can be judged 
best in view of physical and mental development, but so diffi- 
cult is it so to judge maturity and so crude is education as 
yet in its methods, thatthe maturity of children is judged 
very largely in view of age alone. Hence, in school prac- 
tice, age is taken as the index of maturity. Accordingly, 
certain age limits have been fixed as the normal age for each 
grade of the school, and a child whose age falls within the 
normal age limits fixed for a grade is regarded as being 
sufficiently mature, both physically and mentally, to do the 
work of that grade. The age-grade standard is therefore 
the only basis we can use here in judging of the maturity 
or immaturity of the children found in a grade. To be 
sure, when maturity is judged by such standards, children 
will be found in all grades who are of the normal age for 
the grade, but who are manifestly immature for the grade. 
1See Table XVI, page 60. 
2The effect of inability to use the English language on the rate 
of promotion in the 1A grade should not be confused with its effect 
on the actual number of non-promotions in this grade. See Table 
XLV, page 161.
-P-A-G-E-84

Table XVII gives, by grades, the number of children out 
of a thousand under normal age, of normal age, under one 
year over normal, between one and two years over normal, 
between two and three years over normal, and three years 
and more over normal, when the distribution is made on 
the basis of the per cent. of children of the corresponding 
age in the grade June 30, 1911: 
TABLE XVII! 
Between|Between| 3 Years 
  
  It will be observed that a larger proportion of the children 
in the 1A grade are of normal age than in any other grade. 
Hence, the ages of the children in the 1A grade correspond 
more nearly to the normal age fixed for the rA grade than 
is the case in any other grade of the elementary school. 
1 Table XVII is based upon Table XXXVII; see page 144. The age- 
grade standards employed in Table XVII are those of the City Super- 
intendent of Schools. 
   
-P-A-G-E-85
  
Promotion and Non-Promotion 75 
When judged by the age-grade standards as determined 
by the City Superintendent of Schools, there is, therefore, 
no ground for holding that 1A pupils, in large numbers, 
are immature for their grade and, consequently, for assum- 
ing that immaturity is any considerable factor in causing 
the low rate of promotion found in the 1A grade. 
Over-Size Classes as a Factor 
1A classes, according to the By-laws of the Board of Edu- 
cation, should not contain more than fifty pupils, and fifty 
is regarded in most cities as too large for the most effective 
work. Hence, 1A classes having more than fifty pupils 
may be considered over-size. 
There were in the 1A grade, June 30, 1911, according to 
the reports made to us, 15,025 pupils in classes having more 
than fifty pupils. The rate of promotion for 1A pupils in 
these over-size classes was 73.46 per cent.1 If the 15,025 
pupils in over-size classes are subtracted from the total reg- 
ister of 1A pupils (43,012), there remain 27,987 pupils in 
classes of fifty and under. The rate of promotion for these 
classes was 77.40 per cent.1 Hence, the per cent. of promo- 
tion in the 1A grade, when all 1A pupils in over-size classes 
are excluded, was 1.38 per cent. higher than the per cent. of 
promotion for the grade as a whole. 
Assuming that all other conditions affecting promotion 
and non-promotion were the same in classes of fifty and 
under, and in over-size classes, the per cent. of promotion 
in the 1A grade was, therefore, lower by 1.38 per cent. than 
it otherwise would have been, because of 1A pupils in over- 
size classes. Hence, it appears that over-size classes are a 
slight factor in causing the low rate of promotion in the 
1A grade. 
Part Time as a Factor 
According to the reports made to us, the per cent. of pro- 
motion in the 1A grade, when all 1A pupils in part-time 
1See Table XXXI, page 129.  
-P-A-G-E-86
  76 Problems in Elementary School Administration 
classes are excluded, was 76.96 per cent.,1 which is but .94 
of 1 per cent. higher than the per cent. of promotion (76.02 
per cent.) for the grade as a whole. 
Consequently, had there been 1A whole-time classes only, 
the per cent. of promotion in the 1A grade as a whole would 
have been 76.96 per cent. Assuming that all other condi- 
tions affecting promotion and non-promotion were the same 
in the two kinds of classes, the per cent. of promotion in 
the 1A grade was, therefore, lower by but .94 of 1 per cent. 
because of 1A pupils in part-time classes.” 
Absence as a Factor 
In the reports made to us it is impossible to distinguish 
between absence due to irregular attendance and absence due 
to late entrance during the course of the term, the reports 
giving merely the days absent. 
Table XVIII gives the number of 1A pupils on register at 
the end of the February-June term, 1911, absent ten days 
and less, absent eleven to twenty, etc. ; it gives the per cent. 
of the total register of 1A pupils absent ten days and less, 
absent eleven to twenty days, etc., and the per cent. of the 
pupils absent ten days and less, absent eleven to twenty days, 
etc,, promoted and the per cent. not promoted:

-P-A-G-E-87
Promotion and Non-Promotion 77 
11.65 per cent. of 1A pupils were absent, it will be ob- 
served, more than a month—that is, more than a fifth of 
the term; 7.41 per cent. were out of school a month and a 
half; and 20.67 per cent. were out more than forty-one 
days, or one 1A pupil out of each five was absent more than 
two-fifths of the entire time. 
The rate of promotion, it will be noted, varies inversely 
with the increase in the days absent. For pupils absent ten 
days and less the rate of promotion was 89.47 per cent.; for 
those absent forty-one days and more, 40.56 per cent. Fur- 
ther, the rate of promotion for pupils absent ten days and 
less (89.47 per cent.) is higher than the rate for the grade 
as a whole (76.02 per cent.) by 13.45 per cent. Conse- 
quently, had all other conditions been the same as among 
pupils absent ten days and less, and had there been in the 1A. 
grade pupils absent ten days and less only, the per cent. of 
promotion for the grade, as a whole, would have been 89.47 
per cent. The rate of promotion in the 1A grade was, there- 
fore, lower by 13.45 per cent. than it otherwise would have 
been, because of pupils who were absent more than ten 
days.? 
Summary 
The foregoing discussion of the assigned causes of the 
low rate of promotion in the 1A grade may be thus sum- 
marized: The per cent. of promotion in the 1A grade, at 
the end of the February-June term, 1911, was lower than it 
otherwise would have been by 1.54 per cent., because of the 
pupils who were unable to use the English language; by 
1.38 per cent., because of pupils being in over-size classes, 
and by .94 of 1 per cent., because of pupils being in part- 
time classes, and by 13.45 per cent., because of absence. 
Immaturity was a negligible factor. It is, therefore, clear 
that absence (including late entrance) was the preponder- 
ating cause of the low rate of promotion in the 1A grade at 
the end of the February-June term, 1911.

INCREASING THE RATE OF PROMOTION IN THE IA GRADE 
The problem of increasing the per cent. of promotion in 
the 1A grade is, therefore, not so much a question of in- 
creasing the number of special classes for pupils unable to 
use the English language, of reducing the number of over- 
size classes, and of part-time classes—all of which should 
be done—as it is a question of getting 1A pupils in school 
at the beginning of the term and of keeping them there dur- 
ing the term. Hence, the problem of increasing the per cent. 
of promotion in the 1A grade is chiefly one of how to im- 
prove attendance among 1A pupils. 
It is to be expected that 1A pupils will attend school some- 
what less regularly than pupils in other grades. Many 
parents do not feel the need of keeping such young children 
in school regularly; the children themselves, not having as 
yet formed the school-going habit, are, at times, inclined to 
remain at home when there is no good reason why they 
should. Infectious and contagious diseases are also more 
prevalent among 1A pupils than among pupils of the other 
grades. Granting all this, there is little doubt but that the 
amount of absence in the 1A grade can be materially re- 
duced. 
To be sure, large numbers of 1A pupils are under seven 
years of age, and are, therefore, not amenable to the Com- 
pulsory Education Law. Indeed, of the 83,766 pupils ad- 
mitted to the 1A grade during the school year 1910-11, 
65,682,1 or 78 per cent., were under seven years of age. 
With these all that can be done is for the Board of Education 
to pass rules and regulations controlling their entrance and 
attendance, and for principals and teachers to use, to the 
utmost, their influence with parents and pupils. (See rec- 
ommendations, page 79.) 
There were, however, among the 1A entries during the 
school year 1910-11, 18,0841 pupils, or 22 per cent. of the 
1 Annual Report of City Superintendent of Schools for 1910-11, Table 
XXXIII, page 61. 
 
-P-A-G-E-89
Promotion and Non-Promotion 79 
total 1A entries, who were seven years of age and older. 
Teachers and principals should not only use their influence 
with the parents to send these pupils to school at the begin- 
ning of the term, but every effort should be put forth to 
keep them regular in attendance. Further, parents having 
children seven years of age and older, who do not send them 
to school at the beginning of the term and keep them regu- 
larly in school, should be made to feel the full force of the 
Compulsory Education Law. It is safe to say that to en- 
force rigorously the Compulsory Education Law in the 1A 
grade would not only avoid much future trouble with 
parents, but cure many an incipient case of truancy. 
RECOMMENDATIONS 
To the end that attendance in the 1A grade may be im- 
proved, and that congestion in this grade may be relieved, 
we recommend: 
(1) That a by-law be passed by the Board of Educa- 
tion which prohibits entrance to the 1A grade, after 
the last day of the fourth week of a school term, to 
children who will not be seven years old until after 
the end of the term; and which provides for the 
exclusion from the school, at the discretion of the 
principal, of such children when they have been ab- 
sent forty days, including days lost by late entrance 
and irregular attendance, during the first half of 
the term. 
(2) That effort be made by the Board of Education to 
have the Compulsory Education Law so amended 
that it will apply to children who will be seven 
years old before the end of a given school term. 
(3) That the Permanent Census Board, prior to the be- 
ginning of each school term, send to the principal 
of each school, along with the name and home ad- 
dress of the parent, the names, for the given school 
district, (a) of all children six years of age who 
 
-P-A-G-E-90
80 Problems in Elementary School Administration 
(4) 
(5) will not be seven until after the close of the given 
term; (b) of all children who are six and who will 
be seven before the end of the given term; and (c) 
of all children seven years of age, who should enter 
school at the opening of the given term. In this 
way each principal will know the number of chil- 
dren that should enter his or her school, and will 
be able to report at an early date to the attendance 
officers all children who have not entered and who 
are subject to the Compulsory Education Law. 
That a poster in the several languages of the city 
be prepared and placed in the several school dis- 
tricts prior to the beginning of each term, which 
will emphasize the importance of sending children 
to school at the beginning of the term, and of keep- 
ing them regular in attendance, which will state 
the rules regarding the entrance and attendance of 
children who will not be seven until after the end 
of the term, and which will point out the provisions 
of the Compulsory Education Law. 
That a new attendance report be prepared for the 
1A grade, which will show for each child the date 
of entrance, the number of days in attendance dur- 
ing the month, and the cause of each absence, and 
that a separate report be made for children not 
amenable to the Compulsory Education Law and 
for children amenable to it, to the end that definite 
information may be had on absence in the 1A 
grade, and on the extent to which the Compulsory 
Education Law is enforced.

  CHAPTER V 
THE RATE OF PROMOTION 
W "8 the exception of the 1A and 8B grades, the rate 
of promotion, both in the several boroughs and in 
the Greater City, was, at the end of the February-June term, 
IQII, as we have seen, uniformly about 90 per cent. The 
fact that the rate of promotion was uniformly about 9o per 
cent. gives weight to the statement made to us repeatedly, 
both by teachers and principals, that they were “unofficially 
expected” to promote at the end of the February-June term, 
IQII, approximately go per cent. of their pupils, and, hence, 
that promotions were forced and were made mechanically 
and without due regard to fitness. 
INCREASING THE RATE OF PROMOTION 
The City Superintendent of Schools did urge upon 
principals, during the school year 1910-11, the importance 
of advancing a large per cent. of pupils. To quote his 
words: “I have been careful to advise the principals that 
the pressure to secure more generous promotions must not 
be construed to mean that pupils who are unfitted to do the 
work of the next higher grade are to be promoted. It means 
only that every effort is to be made to render every pupil fit 
for promotion.” + 
Despite the foregoing uniformity in the per cent. of pro- 
motion, and the assertion of teachers and principals, re- 
ferred to above, there is evidence that, on the whole, princi- 
pals and teachers used discretion in making promotions at 
1 Annual Report of the City Superintendent of Schools for 1910-11, 
page 83.

the end of the February-June term, 1911, and that promo- 
tions were not made on a mere numerical and mechanical 
basis. To affirm that promotions at the end of the Feb- 
ruary-June term, 1911, were not made mechanically is not to 
deny that there was a decided increase in the rate of promo- 
tion over corresponding terms of previous years.

The Rate of Promotion 83 
The rate of promotion for the entire February-June term 
of 1911 was higher in every grade than for the correspond- 
ing term of 1910. It was higher by 1.44 per cent. in one 
grade, by from 3.56 per cent. to 3.93 per cent. in three 
grades, by 4 per cent. to 4.90 per cent. in seven grades, by 
from 5.19 per cent. to 5.71 per cent. in four grades, and by 
6.25 per cent. in one grade. It will also be observed that 
the rate of total promotion was higher for the entire Feb- 
ruary-June term, 1911, by 4.56 per cent., than for the same 
term of IgIo. 
An increase of 4.56 per cent. in the rate of promotion, in 
a single year, is an unusually large increase for the City of 
New York. Table XX gives by grades the rate of promo- 
tion for the entire February-June term of 1906, 1907, 1908, 
1909, 1910, and 1911; the increase in the rate of promotion 
for the entire February-June term, 1910, over the rate for 
the entire February-June term, 1906; also the increase in 
the rate of promotion for the entire February-June term, 
IgII, over the same term, 1910; and, finally, it gives the 
difference between the increase in the rate of promotion for 
the entire February-June term of 1911 over the same term 
of 1910, and the increase for the entire February-June term 
of 1910 over the same term of 1906. (See page 84.) 
There has been, it will be observed, an increase in the 
rate of promotion in the February-June term, in each of the 
grades, from 1906 to 1911. The most decided increase was, 
however, in 1911. So decided was this that the increase in 
IQII Over 1910 was greater, in eleven of the sixteen grades, 
than the increase in these grades for the five years prior to 
1g11. While the increase for 1910, in the rate of promo- 
tion, in all grades taken together, over 1906 was, it will be 
noted, 3.75 per cent., the increase in the rate of total pro- 
motion in I91I over 1910 was 4.56 per cent. Hence, the 
increase in total promotion for the entire February-June 
term was .81 of 1 per cent. greater for the single February- 
June term, 1911, than for the five terms prior to IgIT. 
This extraordinary increase in the rate of promotion for

the entire February-June term, 1911, may have been due 
either to an increase in promotions during the term, or to an 
increase at the end of the term, or it may have been due to 
both an increase during the term and at the end of the term. 
Table XXI gives, by grades, for the February-June term, 
1910, the rate of promotion during the term, and the rate 
at the end of the term; also the same facts for the February- 
June term, 1911. It shows, besides, the increase in the rate 
of promotion during the February-June term, 1911, over the

  86 Problems in Elementary School Administration 
There was an increase in the rate of promotion during the 
February-June term, 1911, over the rate during the same 
term, 1910, in all grades, except the 7A, where there was a 
decrease of 1.52 per cent. The rate during the term was 
higher by from .06 of 1 per cent. to .28 of 1 per cent. in 
two grades, by from .30 of 1 per cent. to .50 of I per cent. in 
four grades, by from .55 of 1 per cent. to .75 of 1 per cent. 
in six grades, and by from .88 of 1 per cent. to .96 of I per 
cent. in three grades—while the increase in all grades, taken 
together, was .51 of 1 per cent. 
It will also be observed that there was an increase, in all 
grades, in the rate of promotion at the end of the February- 
June term, 1911, over the rate at the end of the same term, 
1910. The rate was higher by 1.38 per cent. in one grade, 
by from 3.03 per cent. to 3.93 per cent. in eight grades, by 
from 4.57 per cent. to 4.95 per cent. in three grades, and by 
from 5.09 per cent. to 5.37 per cent. in four grades, while 
the increase in all grades, taken together, was 4.05 per cent. 
Of the 4.56 per cent. increase in the rate of promotion 
for the entire February-June term, 1911, over the rate for 
the entire February-June term, 1910, .51 of 1 per cent., or 
11.18 per cent., of this increase was, therefore, due to the 
larger number of promotions during the term, and 4.05 per 
cent. or 88.82 per cent. of the increase was due to the larger 
number of promotions at the end of the term. 
The fact that the increase in the rate of total promotion 
for the entire February-June term, I91I, over 1910, was 
greater than the total increase for the same term from 1906 
to 1910 inclusive, and the fact that 88.82 per cent. of the 
extraordinary increase in the rate of total promotion for 
the entire February-June term, 1911, was due to the in- 
creased number of promotions at the end of the term, raises 
the question: How was this extraordinary increase in the 
rate of promotion effected? A part of it was, doubtless, 
brought about through an increase in the efficiency of the 
school. The importance of making more liberal promotions 
having been emphasized, teachers and principals put forth 
 
-P-A-G-E-97
  The Rate of Promotion 87 
unusual effort to fit pupils for advancement. Yet, when due 
allowance is made for whatever increase in efficiency there 
may have been, it must be admitted, by all who are ac- 
quainted with school conditions and school work, that the 
extraordinary increase in the rate of promotion in the Feb- 
ruary-June term, I9I1I, was due, in most part, to the “pres- 
sure” exercised by the City Superintendent of Schools “to 
secure more generous promotions.” 
Increase Justified 
The important question, therefore, is: Was the City Su- 
perintendent of Schools justified in using “pressure to secure 
more generous promotions’? In view of the number of 
over-age pupils, and of the amount of elimination in the 
elementary schools of the City of New York, we believe the 
City Superintendent was justified in his endeavor to increase 
the rate of promotion. 
Number of Over-Age Pupils 
The course of study in the elementary schools of the City 
of New York comprises sixteen units, each in theory one- 
half school year in length. Accordingly, a child, entering 
school at six or seven, should complete the elementary school 
by his fourteenth or fifteenth year. If, for any reason, a 
pupil enters school late or remains a whole year or more 
in a single grade, such a child becomes over age for his 
grade. 
Table XXII gives the register in regular classes, after 
promotion June 30, 1911, in the grades of each year, the 
number of pupils in the grades of each year and among the 
elementary school graduates of 1910-11, under normal age, 
normal age, under one year over normal, etc. ; it shows, be- 
sides, the total number of over-age pupils in the grades of 
each year and among the elementary school graduates; also 
the per cent. of the register of each grade and the per cent. 
of the graduates over age:

  The Rate of Promotion 89 
Of the 35,329 graduates in 1910-11, it will be observed 
that 14,477, or 40.98 per cent., were over age, hence were 
fifteen years of age and older on completing the elementary 
school. Despite the fact that the foregoing table has to do 
only with pupils in regular classes, and despite the fact that 
age is judged from the point of view of the age limits fixed 
for being in the grade in which pupils are registered after 
promotion, there were in the regular classes of all grades,

June 30, 1911, according to the City Superintendent of 
Schools, 131,858 over-age pupils, or 23.30 per cent. of the 
pupils on register after promotion were behind their grade 
for their age. The grades of the sixth year show the highest 
per cent. of over age, 34.44 per cent., and the grades of the 
first year, the lowest, 7.96 per cent. 
Were the foregoing over-age pupils registered in the 
grade where they should be by reason of their age, these 
pupils would have been distributed, when distributed accord- 
ing to the age-grade standards as fixed by the City Superin- 
tendent of Schools, among the several grades as follows:

The Rate of Promotion 91 
There are thousands of pupils in each grade, it will be 
noted, who are below the grade in which their age entitles 
them to be. There are pupils in the second grade who, by 
reason of their age, should be in the eighth grade; pupils in 
the third, who should be in the high school; and pupils grad- 
uating from the elementary school, who should be in college. 
In the sixth and lower grades alone there are 15,839 pupils 
who are already fourteen years of age; in the seventh grade, 
17,924; and in the eighth grade, 24,597, or a total of 
58,360 pupils who, instead of dragging along between the 
first and eighth grades, should have their elementary edu- 
cation behind them and be either at work or in high 
school. 
The educational significance of over age lies in the fact 
that just to the degree that pupils in the elementary school 
are over age, just to that degree do they—particularly those 
over age because they have failed to receive promotion regu- 
larly—tend to fail to complete the elementary school course 
of study. Hence, of the pupils on register in regular classes 
June 30, 1911, 34,388, by reason of being over age between 
one and two years, will probably fail to complete the work 
of the eighth year; 12,299, by reason of being behind be- 
tween two and three years, will probably fail to complete the 
work of the seventh year; and 5,151, by reason of being 
behind three and more years, will probably fail to complete 
the grades of the sixth year. 
A certain amount of over age in the elementary schools 
of the city is due to the late entrance of children to the 
grades of the first year; the major portion of it is, however, 
due to pupils failing to receive regular promotion after they 
have once entered school.” This fact in itself supplies ample 
ground for the insistence of the City Superintendent on 
“more generous promotions.”

2See Table XXXIII, page 61, Annual Report of the City Superin- 
tendent of Schools, 1910-11, and Table XVI, page 69 of this volume.  
-P-A-G-E-102
  92 Problems in Elementary School Administration 
Amount of Elimination 
The dropping out of pupils from the elementary schools 
before completing the course of study is termed “elimina- 
tion.” It is doubtful whether any large city of this country 
has, at present, the data at hand to determine with exactness 
the grades of work completed by the children leaving the ele- 
mentary school. At all events, such data are not to be had 
at present in the City of New York.t 
Following the method pursued by writers on elimination, 
the per cent. of pupils entering school who continue to the 
end of each year is estimated by finding what per cent. the 
pupils in a given grade at the end of a given school year 
before promotion are of the number of pupils that should be 
in the grade in view of the first-year beginners for the given 
school year. 
Proceeding in this way,? we estimate that, of the pupils 
entering the elementary schools of the City of New York, 
the per cent. remaining to the end of each year and the per 
cent. completing the final grade are as follows: 
Per Cent. Remaining _ Per Cent. Dropping 
to End of Year Out before End of Year 
    
                First Year. 108 .66 
Second Year. 100.73 
Third Year.. 99.47 
Fourth Year. 98.57 
Fifth Year 96.69 
Sixth Year 88.71 
Seventh Yeai 61.45 
Highth Vear...:...).. 47-57 
Completing Eighth Grade. ... 41.33 
  1The pupils’ record cards, adopted in 1909, will in the near future 
supply these data. 
21In making this estimate the average of the first-year beginners for 
1908-9, 1909-10, and 1910-11 was used as the base. See Annual Report 
of City Superintendent of Schools, 1909, page 72; 1910, Table XLVII, 
page 78, and 1911, Table XXXIII, page 61. For the number of pupils 
remaining to the end of the grades of each year see Annual Report 
of the City Superintendent of Schools, 1911, Table XXXVII, page 66. 
The pupils on register June 30, 1911, in special classes were arbitrarily 
distributed as follows: One-sixteenth to the grades of the second 
year; one-sixteenth to the grades of the third year; three-sixteenths 
to the grades of the fourth year; five-sixteenths to the grades of the 
fifth year, and six-sixteenths to the grades of the sixth year.
-P-A-G-E-103
  The Rate of Promotion 93 
It would appear from the foregoing estimates that, of the 
children entering the elementary schools of the City of New 
York, practically all remain to the end of the grades of the 
fifth year, that one pupil out of each eight leaves before 
the end of the sixth year, four out of each ten fail to remain 
to the end of the seventh year, less than one in two continues 
to the end of the eighth year, and but four out of each ten 
graduate. 
  
          
  
    
Fig. 2. Black indicates the per cent. of pupils failing to complete the grades 
of the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth years, and the per cent. failing to 
graduate. 
All other conditions remaining the same, the number of 
grades a pupil is able to complete during the course of his 
school life is conditioned by standards of promotion. The 
practical problem confronting the City Superintendent of 
Schools was, therefore: Is it better for the children of the 
city to spend their entire time in school in the sixth and 
lower grades, or would it be better to make the standards of 
promotion such that pupils in larger numbers may have op- 
portunity to profit by the work of the seventh and eighth 
grades? The work in the sixth and lower grades is con- 
fined primarily to the school arts—reading, spelling, writing, 
and the fundamentals of arithmetic—and the work of the 
two higher grades primarily to the giving of information 
about our industrial, political, and social life which makes 
for economic insight and personal ideals ; hence there can be 
but one answer to the foregoing question, viz., that it is
-P-A-G-E-104
  94 Problems in Elementary School Administration 
preferable to make the standards of promotion such that 
pupils in larger numbers may enjoy the advantages of the 
work of the seventh and eighth grades. 
FORCED PROMOTIONS 
  While the City Superintendent of Schools was, therefore, 
justified in his endeavor to increase the rate of promotion, 
and while principals and teachers used discretion in making 
promotions, the fact remains that principals and teachers 
feel that promotions at the end of the February-June term, 
Ig11, were “forced.” ! 
No changes were made during this term in the require- 
ments of the elementary school course of study either in the 
quality of instruction or in the quantity of the subject-mat- 
ter to be taught. Yet teachers and principals felt con- 
strained to promote more than the usual number of pupils. 
Teachers and principals were thus placed in a false position 
—that is, they felt under the necessity of promoting pupils 
who, when judged by official standards, were not fit for pro- 
motion. It is safe to say that many such pupils were 
promoted, and this accounts not only for the feeling that 
promotions were “forced,” but also for a large part of the 
extraordinary increase in promotions in the February-June 
term, 1911, over the corresponding term of 1910. 
Teachers and principals should not be put in the position 
of having to promote pupils who, when judged by official 
standards, are not prepared for promotion. If the City Su- 
perintendent of Schools was convinced that it was desirable 
to increase the rate of promotion, it was incumbent upon him 
so to lessen the requirements of the elementary school course 
of study as to quantity that more pupils could meet its re- 
quirements and hence be legitimately promoted in greater 
numbers. 
1As already affirmed, this statement is based on the voluntary tes- 
timony of many teachers and principals who express themselves freely 
on the subject.

CHAPTER VI 
THE MAXIMUM RATE OF PROMOTION 
oe extraordinary increase in the rate of promotion in 
the elementary schools for the February-June term, 
1911, and the fact that this increase was brought about not 
so much through an increase in the efficiency of the school 
as through the promotion of pupils who in former terms 
would not have been advanced, raises the question: What 
should be the maximum rate of promotion? 
THE MAXIMUM RATE ACCORDING TO THE CITY SUPERINTEND- 
ENT OF SCHOOLS 
The City Superintendent of Schools is inclined to believe 
that 90 per cent. of promotion on register at the end of the 
term is the maximum rate for the city as a whole. “It seems 
probable,” to quote from his report, “that little further in- 
crease in the general rate of promotion can be expected. A 
remarkable uniformity is shown in all grades, the rate for 
the year ranging from 90.4 per cent. to 92 per cent., with 
the exception of the 8B grade, which should be excluded, 
because here the unusual incentive of graduation and the 
more selected group from which the graduates are drawn 
tend to raise the 8B rate of promotion above what may be 
normally expected in the grades below. A difference of 
only 1.6 per cent. in the rate of promotion in the remaining 
grades shows so little variability as to indicate a close ap- 
proach to the probable maximum rate.” * 
1 Annual Report of the City Superintendent of Schools for 1910-11, 
page 81. 
95
-P-A-G-E-106
  96 Problems in Elementary School Administration 
That the rate of promotion in the several grades, exclu- 
sive of the 8B, was, for the year 1910-11, uniformly about 
go per cent. does not indicate that go per cent. should be 
regarded as the maximum rate of promotion. The same 
argument would have placed the maximum rate at approxi- 
mately 81 per cent. in 1907; at 84 per cent. in 1908; at 85 
per cent. in 1909; and at 86 per cent. in 1910.1. Moreover, 
while the rate of promotion for the year 1910-11 in the sev- 
eral grades is uniform for both the Greater City and the dif- 
ferent boroughs, there were variations in the several dis- 
tricts, ranging from 93 per cent. in District 2 to 98 per cent. 
in District 24;* also in the several schools, ranging from 
35 per cent. in Public School Number 25, Richmond, to 110 
per cent. in Public School Number 22, Richmond.* Further, 
the rate of promotion at the end of the term in the regular 
classes of given grades ranged, for the February-June term, 
1911, in different schools, from 60 per cent. to 100 per cent. 
in the 8A grade, from 75 per cent. to 100 per cent. in the 5A 
grade, and from 57 per cent. to 99 per cent. in the 1A grade. 
Such variations in the rate of promotion in different grades, 
in different schools, and in different districts give little sup- 
port to the thought that the maximum rate has been at- 
tained. Indeed, these variations suggest that, even with 
prevailing standards, there might be a considerable increase 
in the rate of promotion. 
CONDITIONS DETERMINING MAXIMUM RATE OF 
PROMOTION 
However this may be, the present rate of promotion in 
no wise indicates what the rate of promotion should be. 
The rate of promotion in the elementary schools of the city

Appendix “C,” page 471. 
 
-P-A-G-E-107
  Maximum Rate of Promotion 97 
is at present in large part determined by the requirements 
of its one course of study. 
Conditions are favorable to the completion of an ele- 
mentary school course of study by practically all pupils, 
hence favorable to a maximum rate of promotion— 
(1) When the requirements of the elementary school 
are adapted to the varying abilities and educational needs 
of different groups of pupils, and are such that all normal 
children in regular attendance are able to complete the 
course of study; hence, when there are as many elementary 
school courses of study of varying requirements as there 
are groups of normal children of different abilities and 
educational needs. 
(2) When the total length of each of the different ele- 
mentary school courses of study is determined (a) by the 
length of the period pupils may with profit be kept under 
the régime of the elementary school, and (b) by the length 
of time pupils may reasonably be expected to be in attend- 
ance during this period. 
DISREGARD OF CONDITIONS FAVORABLE TO A MAXIMUM RATE 
OF PROMOTION 
These conditions favorable to a maximum rate of pro- 
motion have, to a considerable extent, been disregarded in 
the development and administration of the present elemen- 
tary school course of study. 
Disregard of the Proper Length of the Elementary School 
Period 
The length of the period children can with profit be kept 
under the régime of the elementary school is determined, 
on the one hand, by the age at which children may well 
enter the elementary school, and, on the other, by pubes- 
cence. While custom sanctions children entering the ele- 
mentary school at six, and while children entering at this  
-P-A-G-E-108

age probably make on the whole better progress than those 
entering at any other age,’ no one actually knows whether 
the best age of entrance is five, six, seven, or older. In 
the present state of our knowledge, the best, therefore, that 
can be done is to follow the custom of admitting children 
to the elementary school at six, and make six the lower age 
limit of the elementary school period. This can at least 
be done until the question of the best age at which to admit 
children to the elementary schools is determined by experi- 
mental investigation. 
Pubescence ® is, as a rule, accompanied by certain physi- 
cal vigor and mental and emotional development which 
make pubescent children susceptible to different materials of 
instruction, different methods of teaching, a different kind 
of discipline, school organization, and life, than are prepu- 
bescent children. Hence, there is general agreement that 
children cannot be kept with profit under the régime of the 
elementary school much beyond the beginning of pubes- 
cence.* 
The age at which pubescence begins varies among normal 
children and the length of the period ranges from one to 
three years. In consequence, in an age group above twelve 
years of age, there will be prepubescent (immature) chil- 
dren; pubescent (maturing) children; and postpubescent 
(mature) children. The per cent. of immature, maturing, 
and mature boys in different age groups are shown in 
Table XXIV. 
It appears from Table XXIV that no one age can be des- 
ignated as the age of the beginning of pubescence. Dr. 
Crampton found, however, from a study of 3,835 cases

8 Pubescence denotes a process covering a period of time. Puberty 
or physiological maturity is the point of time when the ability to pro- 
create is established. A pubescent is an individual who is maturing, 
and hence in the period of pubescence.

(high school boys), that “for the ending of prepubescence 
and the beginning of pubescence, the middle of the mean

variability of, more or less, 1.51 years.” 1 No similar data 
for girls, so far as we know, are available. The average 
age of puberty (maturity) is, however, well established by

While there is need of further data pertaining to both 
boys and girls with respect to the number of prepubescent,

sary a change of school methods and régime. Are these 
concomitant, as a rule, with the beginning, the middle, or 
the end of the period? The general impression is that they 
more often appear at the beginning of the period; yet it 
must be confessed that but little data have been collected 
on this point. 
Making the data at hand the basis of judgment, it appears 
that children, as a class, cannot, with profit, be kept under 
the régime of the elementary school much, if any, beyond 
fourteen. In fixing on fourteen as the upper age limit for 
the work of the elementary school we do no violence to edu- 
cational practice, except in a few large cities,! and are in 
accord with the Compulsory Education Laws of New York 
and of other states; also in accord with a recent declaration 
of the National Education Association.? Even if fourteen 
is accepted as the upper age limit for attendance on the ele- 
mentary school, this age limit should be subjected to an 
experimental test and raised or lowered according as experi- 
ence dictates. Further, the organization and the adminis- 
tration of the school should be made so flexible that chil- 
dren maturing before fourteen may continue their elemen- 
tary education under conditions other than those ordinarily 
found in the elementary school,’ and that children maturing 
after fourteen may, on completing their elementary educa- 
tion, continue their schooling under conditions other than 
those generally found in the high school. For neither 
should the child be kept under the régime of the elementary 
school after maturity,* nor be placed in the high school be- 
fore maturity; ® the one is as detrimental as the other. In 
a word, fourteen may be taken as the upper age limit for

the period of elementary education, but each child should 
be made the subject of consideration; and, so far as possi- 
ble, the organization and régime of the school should be 
adapted to the physiological age of each child. 
Little regard is paid in New York City to the limits (six 
to fourteen) of the elementary school period, for thousands 
of children are subjected to the régime of the elementary 
school long after their fourteenth birthday. Of the children 
thirteen to fourteen years old on the register each year, 
June 30, after promotion, from 1905 to 1908 inclusive, 
64.81 per cent. continued in school one additional year; 
27.41 per cent. continued two additional years; and 7.95 
per cent. continued three and more additional years. (See 
Table XXV.1) In consequence, an elementary school in 
the City of New York, from the point of view of the age 
of its pupils, is not an elementary school, but an elementary 
school, a high school, and a college, all within the elemen- 
tary schools. 
The practice of holding pupils in the elementary schools 
of the City of New York long after they are fourteen years 
of age? should be discontinued and attendance should be 
limited to the period between six and fourteen. To be 
sure, the education of children fourteen years of age who 
are still floundering in the fourth or fifth grade is not to be 
considered complete; but the further education of such chil- 
dren should not be regarded as the legitimate work of the 
ordinary elementary school. 
Late entrance to school is one reason why children con- 
tinue in the elementary schools of the city long after they 
are fourteen years old, but there are other factors, such as 
1 Table XXV, on page 102, shows for each of the years 1905 to 1908, 
inclusive, the number of children on register June 30, after promo- 
tion, thirteen to fourteen; the number one year later, fourteen to 
fifteen; the number two years later, fifteen to sixteen, and the number 
three years later, sixteen and over; also the total number for the 
period in each age group and the per cent. of those thirteen to fourteen 
continuing one, two, and three or more years.

absence, inability to use the English language, retardation, 
crowded classrooms, and poor teaching,’ which, together 
with the requirements of the course of study, make it im- 
possible for the great majority of children to complete the 
elementary school within the limits of the period (six to 
fourteen). That children need to remain one, two, three, 
and even four years after becoming fourteen to complete 
the course of study—and some of them do not complete it 
even then—shows to what extent the proper length of the

2The data for this table were computed from the annual reports 
of the City Superintendent of Schools for the years 1905-11. 
Few children enter the elementary school at fourteen to fifteen or 
older (for those entering the 1A grade, fourteen and above, see Annual 
Report of the City Superintendent of Schools for 1911, page 61), so 
the only childrea fourteen to fifteen there can be on register after 
promotion, June, 1906, are the children thirteen to fourteen on register 
after promotion June, 1905, who remain in school; the same is true 
of each later age group. Hence the children in each later age group 
are the same children that are in the thirteen-to-fourteen-year-old age 
group. Also there may be a few pupils leaving school at thirteen to 
fourteen who return at fifteen to sixteen, but it is unreasonable to 
suppose that the number of such children is large enough to affect the 
per cent. of the children thirteen to fourteen remaining in school 
thereafter one, two, and three years.

period of elementary education has been disregarded, and 
to what extent, considering the conditions under which chil- 
dren have to work, their progress is retarded by the exces- 
sive requirement that all of them shall complete the same 
course. 
Disregard of the Length of Attendance within the Limits 
of the Elementary School Period 
If six is made the age of entrance to the elementary 
school—the present legal age of entrance—and the four- 
teenth birthday is made the upper age limit of the elemen- 
tary school period—practically the present upper age limit 
of the Compulsory Education Law—children will actually 
be in school within the limits of this period somewhat less 
than eight years. In consequence, the actual total length 
of the elementary school course of study should be some- 
what short of eight school years. 
There are no data at hand to show how long children are 
actually in attendance on the elementary schools of the city 
by their fourteenth birthday. This can, however, be esti- 
mated with reasonable accuracy. Children enter the ele- 
mentary schools of the city at twelve to thirteen years of 
age and even older; the number of such children is, how- 
ever, so small that they do not materially add to the num- 
ber of pupils in the twelve-to-thirteen-year-old age group, 
or to the number of pupils in any other age group.1_ There 
are also children entering under six years of age, but the 
number is relatively small, and, for this reason, these pupils 
may be included among those entering at six. Hence, in 
estimating the actual length of attendance by fourteen, chil- 
dren may be regarded as entering the elementary schools of 
the City of New York at from six up to twelve years of 
age.

It appears from Table XXVI that 53.29 per cent. of the 
children in the elementary schools of the city enter at six 
to seven; 27.87 per cent. at seven to eight; 10.85 per cent. 
at eight to nine; 4.46 per cent. at nine to ten; and 1.93 per 
cent. at ten to eleven; and 1.60 at eleven to twelve. Some 
of the children entering at an advanced age have undoubt- 
edly been in the elementary schools of other places, but it is 
1The figures for this table were compiled from the annual reports 
of the City Superintendent of Schools for 1904-11. The only way, 
of course, for the number of children six years of age to be larger in 
1905 than in 1904 is for children seven years of age to enter school 
during 1905. To find, therefore, the number of children entering at 
a given age, i. e., at eleven to twelve, subtract from the number of 
pupils of the given age the number in the next lower age group and 
the remainder will be the number entering at the given age. The 
per cent. entering at a given age is determined by finding what per cent. 
the number entering at a given age is of the eleven-to-twelve-year-old 
group. 
 
-P-A-G-E-115
  Maximum Rate of Promotion 105 
equally true that some of these over-age pupils are entering 
the elementary school for the first time.* 
Using these per cents. as the basis of judgment, we esti- 
mate that, out of each hundred pupils thirteen to fourteen 
years old in the elementary schools of the city, fifty-three 
will have been in attendance eight years by their fourteenth 
birthday ; twenty-eight, seven years; eleven, six years; four, 
five years; two, four years; and two, three years—the 
equivalent of an attendance per pupil of 7.2 years.? 
There are three ways in which the time pupils are in 
attendance by fourteen on the elementary schools of the 
city may be lengthened: (1) by decreasing the amount of 
irregular attendance; (2) by enforcing the Compulsory 
Education Law with a rigorous hand, thereby compelling 
pupils living in the city to enter school at seven; and (3) 
by educating the people of the city to the importance of 
sending their children to school at six. There are, however, 
factors that seriously militate against children entering at 
six, notably, traffic conditions. Yet it ought to be possible 
to increase materially the number entering at this age; the 
further development of the kindergarten alone would con- 
tribute much to this end. It is apparent, however, that, 
after all has been done that it is possible to do, the attend- 
ance of pupils by fourteen would, on the average, be prob- 
ably considerably less than eight years. 
In view of the age limits for the work of the elementary 
school, six to fourteen, and in view of the estimated actual 
average attendance during this period of New York City 
children, the elementary schools of the city are face to face 
with the problem of giving children an elementary educa- 
tion in from 7.2 years to something less than eight years. 
Hence, if children are to be able to complete their elemen- 
1 Annual Report of the City Superintendent of Schools, 1911, Table 
XXXIII, page 61. 
2This estimate takes no account of the time that may have been 
lost by irregular attendance, or of the time pupils entering late may 
have been in the elementary schools of other places. 
 
-P-A-G-E-116
  106 Problems in Elementary School Administration 
tary education by fourteen, the actual total length of the 
course of study in the elementary schools of the city should 
be somewhat short of eight school years. 
But, in determining the actual total length of the elemen- 
tary school course of study for the city, little attention has 
been given to the actual length of time children are in at- 
tendance on school by fourteen, or to the number of years 
it actually takes pupils to complete the present course of 
study.1 While pupils are, as we have seen, probably in 
attendance by fourteen on the average 7.2 years, 64.81 per 
cent. of all pupils thirteen to fourteen, exclusive of those 
graduating, continue in school between 7.2 and 8.2 years; 
27.41 per cent. between 8.2 and 9.2 years; and 7.95 per 
cent. between 9.2 and 10.2 years.? Yet less than 42 per 
cent. of the pupils entering the elementary schools of the 
city ever complete the course of study.® 
Further, of those graduating during the last six years but 
23.36 per cent. were under fourteen; 36.68 per cent. were 
from fourteen to fifteen; 27 per cent. from fifteen to six- 
teen; 10.62 per cent.-from sixteen to seventeen; and 2.34 
per cent. were seventeen and over, or 76.64 per cent. were 
fourteen years old and over. (See Table XXVII on page 
109.) On the assumption that these graduates were in at- 
tendance on the average of 7.2 years by fourteen, it there- 
fore took 36.68 per cent. of them from 7.2 to 8.2 years to 
complete the course; 27 per cent. from 8.2 to 9.2 years; 
10.62 per cent. from 9.2 to 10.2 years; and 2.34 per cent. 
from 10.2 to 11.2 years. Hence, on the foregoing assump- 
tion, the actual total length of the elementary school course 
of study exceeds, by from one to four years, the actual time 
76.64 per cent. of pupils are in attendance by their four- 
teenth birthday. 
1The only data ever collected in the city on the number of years 
it takes pupils to complete the present elementary school course of 
study were those collected by Dr. Leonard P. Ayres of the Russell 
Sage Foundation. While these data were presented to the educa- 
tional authorities of the city, they have never been published in detail.

    Maximum Rate of Promotion 107 
Disregard of Varying Abilities and Educational Needs of 
Different Groups of Children 
The difference between children may be characterized as 
internal and external. Among the internal differences are 
those of interest and capacity. Arithmetic is of interest to 
some children; the heroic and human, in literature and his- 
tory, to others; whereas music, drawing, and manual train- 
ing appeal strongly to others. Some children do well in 
literature; others in mathematics and science; while others 
are gifted with artistic ability and mechanical skill. The 
interests and ability of certain children incline them toward 
the professions; of others toward administrative and man- 
aging vocations; and of others toward industrial pursuits 
and commercial activities. Present methods of determin- 
ing interest and capacity are, to be sure, crude; yet it is 
possible to group children with reasonable accuracy on the 
basis of inclination and ability. 
Among the external differences influencing the educa- 
tional needs of children are the immediate conditions with- 
out the home and within the family. It is obvious that the 
educational needs of a child in a district where the streets 
are clean, where the homes are spacious, where the lan- 
guage of the child’s playfellows is pure, and where life in 
general is permeated with the spirit and ideals of America 
—it is obvious that the educational needs of such a child 
are different from those of a child who lives in a foreign 
and tenement section. It is equally obvious that the educa- 
tional needs of a child from a home where a foreign tongue 
is the prevailing language, where the parents are foreign 
born, and ignorant of American customs, institutions, and 
ideals, are different from the educational needs of the child 
who is born of American parentage and who absorbs from 
birth the spirit of our institutions and life. 
Equally influential, with the cultural conditions without 
and within the family, in determining the educational needs 
of children is the financial status of the home, because it is 
   
-P-A-G-E-118
  108 Problems in Elementary School Administration 
the financial status of the home which determines for a 
majority of children whether the elementary school will be 
the only school they will ever attend or whether they will 
also go to high school, to college, or to the university. So 
great is the economic pressure on the larger number of 
homes that the school life of the majority of children must 
end at the time when they can legally join the ranks of wage- 
earners. Ina word, the majority of children, by reason of 
the economic status of the home, will attend the elementary 
school only. This being true, it should be apparent that 
the educational needs of such children are very different 
from the needs of children who are so situated that they 
may continue their education in higher institutions. 
New York City not only has the largest elementary school 
population in the world, but this population is also the most 
heterogeneous. In the elementary schools of the city there 
are children of each of at least fifty-four! nationalities; 
these children represent the very widest differences in in- 
clination and in native ability, in cultural influences with- 
out and within the family, and in the financial status of the 
home. Yet these differences have been very largely disre- 
garded in the development of the present elementary school 
course of study and in the determination of its requirements. 
There is but one course of study for all children in regular 
classes, whether their ability be of a low or of a high order, 
whether they are of foreign-born or of American-born 
parentage, whether they live on the lower East Side or in 
Queens, whether they will stop school as soon as the law 
permits or will continue in school, whether on graduating 
from the elementary school they purpose to go to work or 
purpose to go to an academic, technical, or commercial high 
school. Whatever the inclination, the ability, the particular 
educational need of the child, each must meet the same re- 
quirements and pursue the same course of instruction. 
The effect of disregarding the varying abilities and edu-

cational needs of different groups of children and of the 
failure to provide a number of different elementary school 
courses of study of varying quantitative requirements is re- 
vealed in the fact that, of the pupils in regular classes thir- 
teen to fourteen years old on register after promotion June 
30, for the five years, 1907-11, inclusive, but 20.82 per 
cent. had attained the eighth grade; 29.92 per cent. the 
seventh; 25.57 per cent. the sixth; 15.44 per cent. the 
fourth; and 2.19 per cent. were still lingering in the third 
and lower grades. (See Table XXVIII on page 112.1) 
The effect is also revealed by the fact that, of all the pu- 
pils on register in regular classes June 30, 1911, after pro- 
motion, 23.30 per cent., or practically each fourth child, was 
behind his grade for his age; ? and further, despite the fact 
that many pupils remain in the elementary schools of the 
city one, two, and three years after they are fourteen, of 
all those entering but 88.71 per cent. reach the sixth grade; 
61.45 per cent. the seventh grade; 47.57 per cent. the eighth 
grade, and only 41.33 per cent. are ever able to complete 
the course.® 
Summary 
It is evident, in view of the foregoing, that the present 
elementary school course of study has been developed and 
is administered, first, without due regard to the length of 
the elementary school period, i.e., to the age limits within 
which children may with profit be subjected to the régime 
of the elementary school; second, without due regard to the 
actual length of time children are in attendance by fourteen, 
hence to the actual length of time the school has in which 
to give children an elementary education; and, third, with- 
out due regard to the varying abilities and educational

needs of different groups of children, hence to the number 
able to complete the course; all of which has reacted to 
keep the rate of promotion below what it might have been 
under more favorable conditions. 
CHANGES NEEDED TO ATTAIN THE MAXIMUM RATE OF 
PROMOTION 
From the foregoing it is apparent that the changes needed 
in order to attain in the elementary schools of the city the 
maximum rate of promotion are: 
(1) That the actual total length of each of the differ- 
ent elementary school courses of study be made to corre- 
spond (a) with the length of the period between six 1 and 
fourteen,” i. e., to the period children may with profit be 
kept under the régime of the elementary school, and (b) 
with the length of time pupils may reasonably be expected 
to be in actual attendance during this period. 
(2) That the requirements of the elementary school be 
adapted to the varying abilities and educational needs of 
different groups of children, and such that all normal ° chil- 
dren in regular attendance are able by fourteen to complete 
an elementary school course of study ; hence as many courses 
of study of varying requirements as there are distinct 
groups of children of different abilities and educational 
needs. A brief discussion of each of these suggested 
changes follows. 
                
        
     
Adjusting the Length of the Different Courses of Study 
While the elementary school course of study is, in theory, 
as a rule, eight years in length, what its actual total length 
is has seldom been taken into account. The course of study               1 Probably the best age of entrance. 
2 Probably the beginning of pubescence and the age when children 
need a régime different from that of the elementary school. 
3 Among normal children are included all pupils other than those 
physically and mentally defective, for whom special classes and special 
instruction should be provided.

is prescribed and pupils wishing to complete it must remain 
in school until its requirements are met, whether this takes 
eight years, ten years, or twelve and more years. The 
course of study could easily be made so long that to com- 
plete it would hold pupils in the elementary school until they 
were twenty-one and older. But it is obviously unwise edu- 
cationally to make the elementary course of study actually 
longer by one, two, or three years than the length of time 
the rank and file of children may be expected to be in 
attendance—between six and fourteen—because, by such 
a procedure, not less than 42 per cent. of all the children 
who enter would ever complete the elementary school. If, 
however, all normal children in regular attendance are to be 
able to finish an elementary course of study by fourteen, it 
should be evident that the actual length of each of the dif- 
ferent courses offered must approximate closely the time 
children may with profit be held under the régime of the 
elementary school. Hence, instead of the length of the 
course of study determining the time children must remain 
in the elementary school, as is now the case, it is the time 
children may reasonably be expected to be in school between 
six and fourteen that must determine the actual total length 
of the course of study pursued. 
The present course of study, with slight modifications, 
has been operative in the elementary schools of the city 
since 1905. Yet no one knows with exactness how long it 
is. The actual length of this course can only be determined 
as data are collected year by year with reference to length 
of time taken by normal pupils completing a given grade to 
do the work of that grade, and as these data are used to 
determine the actual length of each grade and of the entire 
course. Until this is done no one will know whether the 
present course of study is eight, nine, ten, or more years in 
length. Yet this course of unknown length is set up to be 
completed by the children who wish to graduate from the 
elementary school. 
Likewise, no data have ever been collected on how long 
 
-P-A-G-E-124
  114. Problems in Elementary School Administration 
children are actually in attendance. The only way to deter- 
mine this is to collect data, year by year, on the length of 
time children entering have been in attendance on the ele- 
mentary schools of other places and of the city; and to 
collect data on the length of time children entering school 
for the first time in the city actually remain. Until such 
data are collected no one will know definitely how long 
children are actually in the elementary schools of the city, 
or how long they are in school between six and fourteen; 
consequently, it is impossible to determine what the actual 
total length of the courses of study should be. 
It therefore appears that two sets of data fundamental 
to the proper adjustment and administration of a course of 
study in the City of New York are wholly lacking: (a) 
of how long they are in school between six and fourteen; 
consequently, it is impossible to determine what the actual 
total length of the courses of study should be. 
Adjusting the Requirements and Determining the Number 
of Different Courses 
The actual length of the elementary school course of 
study has been determined, in large measure, not in view 
of what the rank and file of children are able to accomplish 
within the limits of the time they may reasonably be ex- 
pected to be in school by fourteen, but in view of certain 
assumptions of what is required of children entering high 
school and of the equally arbitrary assumptions of what 
pupils graduating from the elementary schools ought to 
know. 
Experience has shown that it is impossible to make these 
academic and arbitrary standards real; and investigation? 
has shown that there is no uniformity in such standards 
even within the same system. In consequence, these stand- 
1See Non-Promotion and Failures by Studies, Board of Education, 
Cleveland, 1909.
-P-A-G-E-125
Maximum Rate of Promotion 115 
ards vary, within the system, with the school; within a 
school, with the grade; also with the study. Indeed, there 
are practically as many academic standards in a given sys- 
tem as there are principals and teachers multiplied by the 
number of grades and by the number of studies in the cur- 
riculum. 
Investigation shows also that these standards have been 
developed without regard to their effect. Their effect on 
the elementary schools of the city is revealed by the fact as 
stated above that, although pupils remain in school one, 
two, and three years after they are fourteen. less than 42 
per cent. of those entering graduate; by the fact that, of 
those graduating between 1906-11, inclusive, 74.46 per 
cent. were fourteen and above; and also by the fact that, 
of the pupils thirteen to fourteen years old, exclusive of 
those in special classes, on register June 30, after promo- 
tion, for the five years 1907-11, inclusive, but 20.82 per 
cent. had attained the eighth grade; 29.92 per cent. the 
seventh; 25.57 per cent. the sixth; 15.44 per cent. the fifth; 
6.06 per cent. the fourth; and 2.19 per cent. were still lin- 
gering in the third and lower grades. 
It is obviously unwise educationally for children to pur- 
sue a course of study which is out of proportion to their 
capacities and out of proportion to the time they will remain 
in school, and such that, at fourteen, they find themselves 
still in the fifth, sixth, seventh, or eighth grade. The best 
results can be achieved when children are permitted to pur- 
sue a course of study which they can complete within the 
time they will be in the elementary school between six and 
fourteen. 
Children can be expected, as we have seen, to have been 
in the elementary schools of the City of New York, between 
six and fourteen, at least 7.2 years. Hence, if children are 
to pursue an elementary school course of study which they 
will be able to finish, there must be as many courses of 
study, each complete in itself, in the elementary schools of 
the city as there are considerable groups of children of dif-
-P-A-G-E-126
    116 Problems in Elementary School Administration 
ferent abilities and educational needs; and the quantitative 
requirements of each of these courses must be determined, 
not in view of the demands of higher institutions, or in 
view of what may arbitrarily be thought desirable for chil- 
dren graduating from the elementary school to know, but in 
view of what the given group of children can accomplish 
between six and fourteen. In a word, instead of the quan- 
titative requirements of the course of study determining 
the progress of children through the school, the actual 
progress of children through the school should deter- 
mine the quantitative requirements of the course of study 
pursued. 
Making the actual completion of an entire elementary 
school course of study by all normal children in regular 
attendance the basis of determining the requirements of the 
course of study in no way does away with the need of 
academic standards. It does, however, make these stand- 
ards depend upon the actual progress of children through 
the school, and hence supplies an objective measure of 
whether the prevailing standards are too high or too 
low. 
The adjustment of the course of study to the abilities 
and needs of different groups of children so that all normal 
children, regular in attendance, are able to cover a complete 
course of study between six and fourteen may be done in 
one of two ways: First, there may be one course for all 
schools in which there are both minimum and optional re- 
quirements, the minimum requirements being such as can 
be met by all normal pupils in regular attendance by four- 
teen, the optional requirements providing additional work 
for pupils able to do more than the minimum requirements. 
Second, there may be a number of distinct and complete 
courses, each with minimum and optional requirements, cor- 
responding to the different groups of children of varying 
abilities and educational needs—at the very least, three 
such courses would probably be needed—one for bright 
pupils, one for pupils of medium ability, and one for dull 
 
-P-A-G-E-127
  
Maximum Rate of Promotion 117 
pupils.t The development of different courses of study is, 
we believe, the preferable way of making the necessary ad- 
justments. 
The number of different courses of study needed in the 
elementary schools of the city can, to be sure, only be de- 
termined as data are collected on the abilities and educa- 
tional needs of different groups of children. Similarly, the 
requirements of each of the different courses—that is, the 
character and quantity of subject-matter and the quality of 
the work demanded of pupils—can only be finally deter- 
mined as data are collected on the time taken in each course 
by normal pupils to complete each grade and used to modify 
the requirements so that all normal children in the given 
course in regular attendance are able to complete the course 
by fourteen. 
THE MAXIMUM RATE OF PROMOTION 
Pupils are generally promoted or not promoted according 
as they have or have not met certain academic standards.” 
When the right to promotion is thus determined, as has 
already been pointed out, the rate of promotion varies with 
the school system; within the system, with the school; and 
within the school, with the grade and teacher. Such varia- 
tions in rate of promotion do injustice to the child, because 
work that is rewarded with advancement in one school is 
not so rewarded in another; hence the number of grades a 
pupil is able to complete depends largely on the teacher he 
has and on the school he attends. Nor is there any hope 
that this will not be true so long as the rate of promotion is 
1Demonstrations of the feasibility and effectiveness of providing 
different courses of study in the same school were made by Superin- 
tendent Ettinger when principal of P. S. 147, Manhattan, and as dis- 
trict superintendent in Richmond. Experiments along this line have 
also been carried on in Cleveland, Ohio. : J 
2 These academic standards rest on arbitrary assumptions of what is 
required of pupils entering high school and on equally arbitrary as- 
sumptions of what pupils graduating from the elementary school ought 
to know.  
-P-A-G-E-128
  118 Problems in Elementary School Administration 
determined by purely arbitrary assumptions of what chil- 
dren graduating from the elementary school ought to know. 
However contrary it may be to present ways of thinking 
and to present school practice, arbitrary high school en- 
trance requirements and arbitrary assumptions of what ele- 
mentary school graduates ought to know should not deter- 
mine the rate of promotion in the elementary school. The 
purpose of the elementary school is not to give a few pupils 
favored either by inheritance or by home surroundings, or 
by both, an arbitrarily assumed amount of knowledge, or to 
give 42 per cent. of its pupils a complete elementary school 
course of instruction and to permit the other 58 per cent. 
to flounder about in the lower grades until they finally drop 
from school. The elementary school should give each nor- 
mal child in regular attendance, within the period children 
may with profit be kept under the régime of the elementary 
school, a complete elementary school course, the course 
completed by each child varying with his ability and edu- 
cational needs. In view of this conception of the time lim- 
its on its work, and of this conception of the purpose of 
the elementary school, the rate of promotion can only be 
determined in view of the rapidity with which normal chil- 
dren in regular attendance must advance in order to finish 
an entire elementary school course of study. Courses of 
study, to be most effective, must be planned with reference 
to the entire elementary school period. Hence, the rate of 
promotion in the elementary school ought ultimately to be 
uniformly about 100 per cent. 
The maximum rate of promotion will be about 100 per 
cent., and not 100 per cent., because there are always a 
number of pupils in a system who are not in attendance 
during a given term sufficiently long to enable them to com- 
plete the work of any course that may be offered; but there 
are also a number of pupils who, by reason of beginning 
their school work at an advanced age, or by reason of being 
improperly classified, will be able to cover two terms of 
work in one term; in this way the terms of work lost will 
 
-P-A-G-E-129
  Maximum Rate of Promotion 119 
tend to balance the terms of work gained, and the rate of 
promotion thus maintained at about 100 per cent. 
The maximum rate of promotion cannot be secured, how- 
ever, by one school promoting 150 per cent. of its pupils 
and another school 50 per cent., or, as in the City of New 
York, by one school promoting 110 per cent. and another 
35 per cent., or by the promotion of 98 per cent. of the 
pupils in one grade of a school and 57 per cent. in another 
grade of the same school. Such a procedure, on the one 
hand, enables children to complete the elementary school 
course of study before the beginning of pubescence, which 
is unwise; and, on the other hand, holds children in the 
elementary school beyond this period, and only permits part 
of the pupils ever to complete a course, hence defeats the 
very purpose of the elementary school. Consequently, the 
rate of promotion in each grade and in each school of a 
system should be uniformly about 100 per cent. 
If it is found that a number of normal pupils in regular 
attendance are unable to do the work of a given grade in a 
given course, the remedy is not the non-promotion of these 
pupils. These pupils should either be reclassified with re- 
spect to the course they should pursue or the requirements 
of the course they are following should be lowered. Simi- 
larly, if it is found that children in regular attendance are 
able to do more than is required by the course they are in, 
the remedy is not double promotion and the completion of 
the elementary school before the beginning of pubescence. 
These children should either be put in a more difficult course 
or the requirements of the course they are in should be 
raised. For the constant factors in the elementary school 
are (1) the actual total length of each of the several courses 
of study, and (2) the rate of promotion; the variable fac- 
tors are (1) the abilities and needs of children, and (2) the 
1The rate of promotion for a term in a school is 150 per cent., 
when during the term 50 per cent. of the pupils of the school complete 
one term’s work and 50 per cent. by receiving double promotion com- 
plete two terms’ work. 
   
-P-A-G-E-130
    120 Problems in Elementary School Administration 
particular courses of study that should be offered and the 
requirements of these courses. Hence, it is not the rate of 
promotion, and, in consequence, the actual total length of 
the courses of study, that should constantly vary, but the 
particular courses of study that should be offered and the 
requirements of these courses. It is these that must be 
constantly adjusted to the abilities and needs of the chil- 
dren with which each school has to do. Consequently, 
while the actual total length of the courses of study and 
the rate of promotion should be practically the same in all 
the schools of a system, the particular courses of study 
offered and the requirements of these courses may, and gen- 
erally should, vary with the school.t 
CONCLUSIONS 
That each normal child in regular attendance between six 
(probably the best age of entrance) and fourteen (probably 
the beginning of pubescence and the age when children need 
a régime different from that of the elementary school) may 
be able to complete an entire elementary school course of 
study, hence that conditions may be favorable to a maxi- 
mum rate of promotion in the elementary schools of the 
city, we recommend : 
(1) That data be collected— 
(a) On the best age of entrance to the elementary 
school. 
(b) On the age at which children need a régime 
different from that of the elementary school. 
(2) That data be collected— 
(a) On the number of normal children entering 
and completing the present course of study. 
(b) On the actual total length of the present 
course of study.

CHAPTER VII 
SIZE OF CLASS AND NON-PROMOTION 
O*E of the most important working conditions of any 
school is the size of class—the number of children 
one teacher is expected to instruct. When classes contain 
from fifty to sixty or more pupils it is impossible for the 
teacher to give to each child adequate personal attention 
and direction. Hence, the efficiency of the school may be 
materially reduced by the presence of over-size classes. 
MAXIMUM SIZE OF REGULAR CLASSES 
The maximum size of a regular elementary school class? 
is fixed, by the Board of Education of the city, at fifty. 
Principals, under the By-laws of the Board, are free to or- 
ganize classes up to fifty, but, if it becomes necessary, as 
is often the case, to put more than fifty pupils in a class, 
such a class cannot be formed without the permission of 
the Board of Superintendents.? Fifty is, therefore, recog- 
nized as the maximum beyond which the number of pupils 
in a class cannot be increased without reducing the efficiency 
of the school. While fifty is fixed as the maximum, and 
while the continued lack of adequate school accommoda- 
tions makes it necessary to put tens of thousands ° of chil- 
1 Regular classes are to be distinguished from special classes,—that 
is, from classes for backward, defective, crippled, blind, deaf, and 
anemic children, all of which are smaller than regular classes. This 
report has to do only with regular classes.

dren annually in classes having fifty and above, there is a 
strong feeling among the school officials of the city that, 
if the school is to do its work efficiently, the number of 
pupils per class ought not to exceed forty. We share this 
feeling. 
NUMBER OF PUPILS IN CLASSES OF EACH SIZE 
What the actual size of class was in New York City and 
how the children were distributed at the end of the Febru- 
ary-June term, 1911, among the classes of different sizes 
is shown by Table XXIX. This table gives, by grades, the 
number of pupils in regular classes on register before pro- 
motion June 30, 1911, in classes under thirty-five, thirty- 
five to forty, etc.; also the per cent. of the total register of 
each grade in the classes of each size.” 
The 73,991 pupils in over-size classes—classes having 
fifty-one to fifty-five, fifty-six to sixty, and over sixty— 
were distributed as follows:

Size of Class and Non-Promotion 125 
Twenty and thirty-one one-hundredths (20.31) per cent., 
or one-fifth, of all the pupils in over-size classes at the end 
of the February-June term, 1911, it will be observed, were 
in the 1A grade; 54.56 per cent. in the 1A-2B grades; 87.10 
per cent. in the grades 1A-4B; and 97.78 per cent. in the 
grades 1A-6B. In short, over-size classes were confined, 
at the end of the February-June term, 1911, to the 6B and 
lower grades. 
If comparison is made, grade by grade, between the pu- 
pils within each grade in the classes of each of the several 
sizes (see Table XXIX) it will be noted that the per cent. of 
pupils in small classes gradually increases from the lowest 
to the highest grade. In classes under thirty-five the per 
cent. increases from 7.01 per cent. in the 1A to 28.82 per 
cent. in the 8B, and, in classes having thirty-five to forty, 
from 10.70 per cent. to 26.14 per cent. A corresponding 
decrease will be noted from the 1A to the 8B grades in 
the per cent. of pupils in over-size classes. In classes having 
fifty-one to fifty-six the per cent. decreases from 18.74 per 
cent. in the 1A to 3.12 per cent. in the 8B; in classes having 
fifty-six to sixty from 10.09 per cent. to zero; and in 
classes having over sixty from 6.10 per cent. to zero. 
It, therefore, appears that the size of a class varies with 
the grade; that the rA has the smallest number of small 
classes and the largest number of large classes, and the 8B 
has practically the largest number of small classes and the 
smallest number of large classes. 
The presence of large classes in the grades 1A-6B and 
of small classes in the grades 7A-8B is due partly to policy 
and partly to necessity. There is a feeling among the school 
officials of the city that classes in the upper grades should 
be smaller than in the lower grades. Hence, in schools 
where there are ample accommodations for all pupils, classes 
in the 7A-8B grades are so organized as to have from 
thirty-five to forty pupils, whereas, in the grades 1A-6B, 
classes range from forty to forty-five. In most cases, small 
classes in the upper grades and large ones in the lower grades 
 
-P-A-G-E-136
    126 Problems in Elementary School Administration 
are, however, due to necessity. In many districts, so many 
pupils leave school in the 6B grade and before that the num- 
bers remaining in the 7A-8B grades are small. Unless these 
pupils are transferred to a central school, it is impossible 
to do otherwise than to have small classes. In contrast, the 
lower grades are crowded. To care for all the pupils in 
these grades, it is necessary to make the classes large. 
RATE OF PROMOTION IN CLASSES OF EACH SIZE 
The rate of promotion at the end of the February-June 
term, 1911, in the classes of each of the several sizes is 
shown by Table XXX. This table gives, by grades, the 
per cent. of the register in each size of class promoted at 
the end of the February-June term, 1911; also the per cent. 
not promoted. (See page 128.) 
When the several grades are considered as a whole it 
will be observed that the highest per cent. of promotion was 
in classes under thirty-five, the rate being 89.36 per cent. 
The rate of promotion in classes of thirty-five to forty was, 
however, only .22 of 1 per cent. less, and, in classes of forty- 
one to fifty, only .41 of 1 per cent. less than in classes under 
thirty-five. Hence, for practical purposes, the rate of pro- 
motion was the same in all classes having fifty and under. 
But the rate of promotion in classes of fifty-one to fifty-five 
was lower than in classes under thirty-five by 1.68 per cent., 
in classes of fifty-six to sixty by 5.91 per cent., and in classes 
over sixty by 18.17 per cent. The major part of the dif- 
ference in the rate of promotion, at least in classes of fifty- 
six to sixty, and in classes over sixty, in comparison with 
the rate of promotion in classes under thirty-five, was, how- 
ever, due to the fact that pupils in the classes of these two 
sizes are principally in the lower grades, where the rate of 
promotion is relatively low. No such differences, it 
will be observed, appear, if comparison is made, grade by 
grade, between the rate of promotion in the classes of the 
several sizes. 
 
-P-A-G-E-137
  Size of Class and Non-Promotion 127 
The differences, such as they are, in the rate of promotion 
within each grade, in these different-size classes, become 
clearer, if all classes of fifty and under are combined and 
all classes of over fifty, and comparison is made between 
the rate of promotion in classes of these two sizes only. 
Table XXXI gives by grades the per cent. of promotion in 
classes of fifty and under, in classes of over fifty, and the 
per cent. of promotion in classes of fifty and under, above 
or below the per cent. of promotion in classes over fifty; 
also the increase in number of pupils that would have been 
promoted in classes of over fifty at the rate of promotion 
in classes of fifty and under. (See page 129.) 
In nine out of sixteen grades the higher rate of promo- 
tion at the end of the February-June term, I91I, was in 
classes of fifty and under; in seven the higher rate was in 
classes of over fifty. The rate of promotion was higher 
in classes of over fifty in the 1B by .29 of 1 per cent.; in the 
4B by .59 of I per cent.; in the 5A by 1.29 per cent.; in the 
5B by .og of 1 per cent.; in the 6B by 1.58 per cent.; in 
the 7B by 3.09 per cent.; and in the 8B by 2.18 per cent. 
But the difference in the rate of promotion was either so 
small or the pupils in the given grade were so few that the 
higher rate of promotion in classes above fifty in these seven 
grades is found to make a difference of only 134 promo- 
tions. 
In each grade of the grades 1A-4A—containing 80 per 
cent. of all pupils in over-size classes '—the rate of promo- 
tion, with the exception of the 1B grade, was higher in 
classes of fifty and under. But, with the exception of the 
1A grade, the differences in the rate of promotion are too 
small materially to affect the number of promotions. 
Thus, although the higher rate of promotion is found, in 
the majority of grades, in classes of fifty and under, this 
higher rate is so small that, had promotions in each of the 
several grades been the same for classes of over fifty as for 
classes of fifty and under, there would have been, in classes

  of over fifty, a net increase of only 789 promotions out of 
a total of 73,991 pupils—the equivalent of one additional 
promotion to each ninety-four pupils in classes of over fifty. 
OVER-SIZE CLASSES AS A FACTOR IN NON-PROMOTION AND 
CONGESTION 
There were, as we have seen, only 789 fewer promotions 
among the 73,991 pupils in over-size classes than there 
would have been had these pupils been promoted at the rate 
for classes of fifty and under. But, in the 1A grade alone, 
by reason of the lower rate, the promotions were, as we 
have seen, fewer by 592—the equivalent of one less promo- 
tion to each twenty-five 1A pupils in over-size classes. 
 
-P-A-G-E-140
  130 Problems in Elementary School Administration 
Hence, as promotions were made at the end of the Febru- 
ary-June term, 1911, over-size classes were no material fac- 
tor, except in the 1A grade, in increasing the number of 
non-promotions. 
It is reasonable to assume that the small number of non- 
promoted children (197) caused by the slightly lower rate 
of promotion prevailing in the grades above the 1A was 
absorbed in the classes already found in these grades, and 
that, to care for the non-promotions (592) caused by the 
decidedly lower rate of promotion in the 1A grade, it would 
be necessary to form only a few, if any, additional 1A’ 
classes. Hence, as promotions were made at the end of the 
February-June term, 1911, over-size classes contributed but 
slightly, if at all, to congestion. 
  CONCLUSIONS 
The foregoing discussion may be summarized thus: 
(1) There were, at the end of the February-June term, 
IQII, 73,991 pupils in over-size classes—that is, in classes 
having fifty and above. The greater number of over-size 
classes was in the grades 1A-6B. 
(2) The size of class varies with the grade; the 1A 
grade has the smallest number of small classes and the 
largest number of large classes, while the 8B grade has the 
largest number of small classes and the smallest number of 
large classes. 
(3) The rate of promotion for all grades, with the ex- 
ception of the 1A grade, at the end of the February-June 
term, I9II, was practically the same in the classes of the 
several sizes. 
(4) As promotions were made at the end of the Feb- 
ruary-June term, IQI1, over-size classes were no material 
factor, except in the 1A grade, in increasing the number of 
non-promotions, and contributed but slightly, if at all, to 
congestion.
-P-A-G-E-141
  Size of Class and Non-Promotion 131 
(5) Although there was only a very slight difference, 
with the exception of the 1A grade, in the rate of promotion 
at the end of the February-June term, 1911, for classes 
under fifty and for classes over fifty, and although data de- 
rived from tests of the educational achievements of children 
are not at hand to prove to what extent classes having over 
fifty offer less favorable opportunities for work than smaller 
classes, teachers and school officials are a unit in the opinion 
that classes having over fifty pupils should be eliminated 
and that all classes should be reduced to at least not more 
than forty-five pupils.

  CHAPTER VIII 
ABSENCE AND NON-PROMOTION 
HE school year in the City of New York is forty 
weeks in length, divided into two terms of twenty 
weeks each. Holidays reduce the actual length of a term 
to somewhat less than one hundred days. Any considerable 
absence, due either to irregular attendance or to late en- 
trance, ‘naturally affects the educational progress of chil- 
dren. 
NUMBER OF CHILDREN ABSENT FOR CERTAIN INTERVALS 
For the purpose of studying the effect of absence? on the 
educational progress of children, pupils have been grouped 
on the basis of their being absent a given number of days 
during the February-June term, 1911. Table XXXII gives 
by grades the number of pupils on register in regular classes 
June 30, 1911, absent ten days and less, eleven to twenty, 
twenty-one to thirty, etc.; also the per cent. of the total 
register of each grade absent ten days and less, eleven to 
twenty, etc. (See page 133.) 
Of the 568,612 pupils on register in regular classes June 
30, I9II, 382,406, or 67.25 per cent., were absent during 
the February-June term, 1911, ten days and less; 97,512, or 
17.15 per cent., eleven to twenty days; 39,391, or 6.93 per 
cent., twenty-one to thirty days; 19,297, or 3.39 per cent., 
thirty-one to forty days; and 30,006, or 5.28 per cent., 
forty-one days and above. 
1]t is impossible to distinguish in this report between absence due 
to irregular attendance and absence due to late entrance.

  134 Problems in Elementary School Administration 
The Compulsory Education Law operates primarily on 
children between the ages of seven and fourteen; according 
to its provisions, children between these ages must be in 
attendance the entire time school is in session. The great 
majority of the children in the grades 2A-6B are between 
these age limits. It is, therefore, astonishing that 65,450, 
or 17.10 per cent., of all the children in these grades should 
be absent during the February-June term, 1911, eleven to 
twenty days; 25,359, or 6.63 per cent., absent twenty-one to 
thirty days; 11,939, or 3.12 per cent., absent thirty-one to 
forty days; and 15,705, or 4.10 per cent.—the equivalent 
of one in each twenty-five—absent forty-one days and 
above. 
If comparison is made grade by grade between the per 
cent. of all pupils within a grade absent each of the several 
periods, it will be observed that the per cent. of children 
absent ten days and less is the lowest in the 1A grade and 
the highest in the 8B, increasing from 40.02 per cent. in 
the 1A to 85.03 per cent. in the 8B. With each of the less 
favorable periods of absence, the reverse is true. Absence 
eleven to twenty days decreases from 20.25 per cent. in the 
1A to 10.14 per cent. in the 8B; twenty-one to thirty days 
from 11.65 per cent. to 2.52 per cent.; thirty-one to forty 
days from 7.41 per cent. to .94 per cent. ; and absence forty- 
one days and above from 20.67 per cent. to 1.37 per cent. 
Hence, the largest amount of absence is in the 1A grade; 
this gradually decreases to the 8B, in which grade there is 
the least amount of absence. 
The difference in the amount of absence in the several 
grades and the gradual decrease from the 1A to the 8B 
become clearer if the pupils on register June 30, 1911, are 
grouped according to (1) absence twenty days and less, 
and (2) absence twenty-one days and more. Table XX XIII 
gives the per cent. of the register of each grade in regular 
classes as of June 30, 1911, absent twenty days and less 
and absent twenty-one days and more.

The amount of absence in the two lowest grades, and 
especially in the 1A, is particularly large, because pupils in 
these grades are young; the amount of sickness among 
them is greater than among older children; they have not as 
yet acquired the school-going habit, and parents generally 
do not feel it necessary to keep such young children in 
school regularly. From the 2A to the 6A grade, absence is 
checked to a greater or less extent by the enforcement of 
the Compulsory Education Law. The further decrease in 
the 6B and later grades is probably due to the withdrawal 
of larger numbers of pupils who were more or less irregular 
in attendance,’ and to the more steady habits and fixed pur- 
poses of those remaining. But the amount of absence in all 
grades is large; whether it cannot be greatly reduced is a 
question worthy of earnest and immediate consideration by 
the school authorities.

  136 Problems in Elementary School Administration 
RATE OF PROMOTION IN EACH OF THE SEVERAL 
PERIODS OF ABSENCE 
The effect of absence on the progréss of children is shown 
by Table XXXIV. This table gives by grades and for each 
period of absence the per cent. of the register as of June 
30, I911, promoted; also the per cent. not promoted. 
When the several grades are considered together the high- 
est rate of promotion at the end of the February-June term, 
I9I1, was among children absent ten days and less, the rate 
of promotion being 93.16 per cent. The rate of promotion 
was lower for pupils absent eleven to twenty days than for 
pupils absent ten days and less by 5.56 per cent.; lower for 
pupils absent twenty-one days to thirty days by 11.01 per 
cent.; lower for pupils absent thirty-one to forty days by 
18.62 per cent.; and lower for pupils absent forty-one days 
and above by 40.34 per cent. 
The same relative effect of absence on promotion is to be 
observed in each of the grades. The promotions out of 
each hundred pupils on register ranged in the several grades 
from— 
89 to 97 for pupils absent ten days and less 
82 to go for pupils absent eleven to twenty days 
75 to 86 for pupils absent twenty-one to thirty days 
60 to 81 for pupils absent thirty-one to forty days 
40 to 67 for pupils absent forty-one and above 
The highest rate of promotion at the end of the February- 
June term, 1911, in every grade, was, therefore, for pupils 
absent ten days and less; the rate decreased in every grade 
with each succeeding period of greater absence; and the 
lowest rate of promotion in every grade was for pupils 
absent forty-one days and above. 
The difference in the effect of absence on the rate of pro- 
motion in the several grades becomes more apparent if 
pupils are grouped according as they were absent twenty 
days and less, and twenty-one days and more, and the rate 
of promotion for the two groups is given by grades. (See 
Table XXXV, page 138.)

The effect of absence on the rate of promotion is greatest, 
it appears, in the 1A grade, being more than twice as great 
as in the 1B. From the 1B on, the seriousness of absence 
becomes increasingly greater practically to the 8B. That is, 
in case a pupil has been absent twenty-one days and more, 
his chance of promotion decreases with each grade from 
the 1B to the 8B. 
It therefore appears, as promotions were made at the end 
of the February-June term, 1911, with the exception of the 
1A grade, absence affected more seriously the rate of pro- 
motion in the higher than in the lower grades, and that, in 
all grades, the rate of promotion varies inversely with the 
amount of absence.
-P-A-G-E-149
Absence and Non-Promotion 139 
ABSENCE AS A FACTOR IN NON-PROMOTION AND CONGESTION 
In the group of pupils having the highest per cent. of pro- 
motion absence varied from zero to ten days.1_ Hence, so 
far as our data go, the effect of absence on promotion is 
least among pupils absent from zero to ten days, and any 
difference in the rate of promotion in groups absent a 
longer period may be attributed to the effect of the longer 
absence.” Hence, by making the rate of promotion among 
children absent from zero to ten days the normal, the effect 
of absence on promotion may be estimated within reason- 
able limits. 
Table XXXVI gives the actual number of non-promo- 
tions among pupils absent eleven days and above, the num- 
ber of non-promotions there would have been at the rate of 
non-promotion for pupils absent from zero to ten days, the 
decrease in number and also the per cent. of decrease in the 
number of non-promotions at the rate of non-promotion for 
pupils absent from zero to ten days. (See page 140.) 
There were, it will be observed, 38,194 non-promotions 
at the end of the February-June term, 1911, in all grades 
among pupils absent eleven days and above. Had the same 
rate of non-promotion prevailed for such pupils as among 
pupils absent from zero to ten days there would have been 
but 13,637 non-promotions, a decrease of 24,557, or 64.30 
per cent. The largest numerical reduction would have been 
in the 1A, 5,785; the smallest in the 8B, 522. The lowest 
per cent. of decrease would have been in the 2A, 51.86 per 
cent.; the highest in the 8B, 86.14 per cent. Hence, from 
51.86 per cent. to 86.14 per cent. of the non-promotions in 
1See table on page 137. 
2In attributing differences in rate of promotion to absence, the as- 
sumption is, of course, that all other conditions were the same in the 
several groups of pupils. While this assumption is evidently not exact, 
the results based on it are significant. Only additional data not now 
available and further study can determine exactly the precise effect of 
absence among the other factors determining non-promotion. In any 
case, it is obvious that prolonged or frequent absence of children from 
school must affect their promotion unfavorably.

the several grades and 64.30 per cent. of all non-promo- 
tions among pupils absent eleven days and above may be 
attributed to the effect of absence. 
When judged solely in view of promotions as made at the 
end of the February-June term, 1911, absence appears to be 
a very large factor in increasing the number of non-promo-

absence is, then, that tens of thousands of children are left 
back to go over the same work again, to congest the already 
overcrowded lower grades, to increase the amount and de- 
gree of retardation, and to add to the cost of the elementary 
school. 
 
-P-A-G-E-151
Absence and Non-Promotion I4I 
CONCLUSIONS 
The foregoing discussion may be thus summarized : 
(1) The greatest amount of absence during the Febru- 
ary-June term, 1911, was in the 1A grade; this gradually 
decreased to the 8B, in which grade there was the least 
absence. 
(2) The amount of absence in all grades is large; 
whether it cannot be greatly reduced is a question worthy of 
immediate and earnest attention. 
(3) With the exception of the 1A grade, absence af- 
fected more seriously the rate of promotion in the higher 
than in the lower grades; and, in all grades, the rate of 
promotion varies inversely with the amount of absence. 
(4) Absence is a very large factor in increasing the 
number of non-promotions, and hence in increasing con- 
gestion. 
(5) In view of the effect of absence on the child’s prog- 
ress through the school, the first duty of teachers and princi- 
pals should be to keep children regular in attendance, and 
the corresponding responsibility of the department of school 
attendance is, therefore, very great.

  CHAPTER IX 
OVER ‘AGE AND NON-PROMOTION 
eee ONS carried on within the last five years 
have established two facts: (1) That children in large 
numbers, either from inclination or from necessity, on be- 
coming fourteen years of age drop out of school perma- 
nently; (2) that many of the children leaving the elemen- 
tary school permanently have not advanced farther in the 
course of study than the fifth or sixth year. 
These facts have led to the question of the grade a child 
of a given age should have completed, providing he is to 
finish the entire elementary school course of study by a given 
age. Accordingly, certain age limits have been fixed for 
entering and for completing each of the grades of the ele- 
mentary school. Children finishing a grade before the age 
limit fixed for completing the given grade are termed “under 
age.” Children finishing a grade at the age limit fixed for 
completing the given grade are termed “normal age.” Chil- 
dren finishing a grade at an older age than the age limit 
fixed for completing the given grade are termed “over age” 
—that is, are behind the grade for their age. 
In determining the number of over-age pupils in a school 
system and the degree of over age—that is, the length of 
time children are behind their grade—much depends on 
the age-grade standards adopted and on the method em- 
ployed in making the estimate. It is impracticable at this 
point to consider the many problems involved in an accurate 
estimate of over age;' and it was impossible, with the data 
1See pages 199-266 of this volume for a discussion of over age and 
method of determining over age.

at hand, to do otherwise than to adopt the age-grade stand- 
ards fixed by the City Superintendent of Schools,’ and to 
determine over age, without regard to whether pupils were 
advanced or not advanced, by the age fixed for being in the 
grade in which pupils were registered before promotion at 
the end of the term, the method of estimating over age 
most commonly used. The ages of children are as of June 
30, 1911.7 
NUMBER OF OVER-AGE PUPILS IN REGULAR CLASSES ® 
The number of over-age pupils in the regular classes of 
elementary schools of the city at the end of the February- 
June term, 1911, is shown by Table XXXVII. This table 
gives by grades the number of pupils on register June 30, 
1 Annual Report of the City Superintendent of Schools for 1904, 
page 47. 
2 While the age-grade standards and the ages of the children are 
the same in both estimates, our estimate of over age at the end of the 
February-June term, 1911, differs radically from that of the City 
Superintendent of Schools for the same term. (See table on page 88 
for his estimate.) Our estimate is much higher than his. Even our 
estimate is somewhat too low, because the over age of pupils not 
promoted is determined by the ages fixed for being in the grade in 
which such pupils were registered rather than by the ages fixed for 
completing the grade last finished. The estimate of the City Super- 
intendent of Schools for promoted pupils is based on the ages fixed 
for being in the grades of the several years to which such children 
have just been advanced, and, for non-promoted pupils, on the ages 
fixed for being in the grades of the several years in which such pupils 
were registered during the term, but from which they failed to be 
promoted. In a word, the over age, if any, of all children is judged 
by him as if they had completed the grade which they have just entered. 
(Non-promoted pupils have, of course, been in the grade for the 
term, but for practical purposes are just entering it.) To judge over 
age by the method of the City Superintendent is to lessen the recorded 
number of pupils over age, and to reduce the length of time pupils are 
over age by from a half to an entire school year; to estimate over age 
in this way is clearly wrong. 
8 We are concerned here with over age in regular classes only. We 
are not concerned with over age among the 31,430 pupils in special 
classes at the end of the February-June term, 1911. See Annual Re- 
port of the City Superintendent of Schools for 1911, page 67.

THE DEGREE OF OVER AGE 
The fact that there were at the end of the February-June 
term, 1911, in regular classes 215,333 over-age pupils is in 
itself significant, but the full significance of this fact be- 
comes apparent only in view of the length of the period 
these pupils are behind their grades. Table XXXVIII gives 
by grades the number of pupils over age under one year, 
between one and two years, between two and three years, 
and three years and more; also the per cent. of the total 
number of over-age pupils in each grade under one year 
over age, between one and two years, etc. (See page 146.) 
Of the 215,333 over-age pupils, 120,618, or 56.01 per 
cent., are less than one year behind their grade, 62,247, or 
28.91 per cent., between one and two years ; 22,547, or 10.47 
per cent., between two and three years; and 9,921, or 4.61 
per cent., three years and more.

  Over Age and Non-Promotion 147 
The largest number of pupils between one and two years 
over age is in the 6A grade, 5,934; the number of such 
pupils decreases with each succeeding grade to 2,066, in the 
8B. The largest number of pupils between two and three 
years over age is in the 5A, 2,731; the number then falls to 
439, in the 8B. The largest number of pupils three years 
and more over age is in the 4B grade, 1,329; the number 
declines with each succeeding grade until there are but sixty- 
nine such pupils in the 8B grade. It therefore appears that 
pupils between one and two years over age drop from 
school in increasing numbers after the 6B grade; that pupils 
between two and three years over age leave after the 5A; 
and that pupils three and more years over age find it in- 
creasingly difficult to remain in school after the 4B. 
Of the total number of over-age pupils in each grade, the 
per cent. under one year over age is the highest in the 1A, 
being 68.96 per cent. ; this falls to 47.49 per cent. in the 5A, 
and then rises to 64.87 per cent. in the 8A. The per cent. 
between one and two years over age rises gradually from 
20.56 per cent. in the 1B to 34.20 per cent. in the 6A, and 
then falls to 28.23 per cent. in the 8B. The per cent. be- 
tween two and three years over age is the lowest in the 1A, 
5.34 per cent.; this rises to 14.65 per cent. in the 5A; and 
falls to 5.49 per cent. in the 8A. The per cent. three and 
more years over age rises from 3.95 per cent. in the 1B to 
7.51 per cent. in the 3B, then gradually diminishes to .94 
of 1 per cent. inthe 8B Judged by the length of the period 
pupils are over normal, over age is, therefore, the least seri- 
ous in the 1A grade; grows increasingly serious to the 5A~- 
5B grades; and thereafter gradually declines in seriousness 
to the 8B, but never becomes less serious than in the 1A 
grade. 
The full significance of 215,333 pupils being over age 
lies, therefore, in the fact that, of these 215,333 pupils, 
120,618 are behind their grade less than one year; 62,247 
between one and two years; 22,547 between two and three 
years; and 9,921 three years and more, and also in the 
   
-P-A-G-E-158
  148 Problems in Elementary School Administration 
fact that the tendency among these children—especially 
among those behind their grade because of failure to be 
advanced regularly—to fail to complete the work of the 
elementary school keeps pace with the extent to which they 
are over age. 
RATE OF PROMOTION FOR OVER-AGE PUPILS 
On the assumption that school conditions were the same 
for both classes of children, a materially lower rate of pro- 
motion at the end of the February-June term, 1911, for 
over-age children than for children of normal age can be 
attributed to lack of capacity among over-age children, or 
to home conditions which prevent them from doing their 
best work, or to both. 
Table XXXIX gives by grades the rate of promotion at 
the end of the February-June term, 1911, for pupils under 
normal age, for pupils of normal age, and for over-age 
pupils.t (See page 149.) 
The rate of promotion in the 1A grade was lower for 
children under normal and of normal age than for over- 
age pupils. The higher rate of promotion for over-age 1A 
pupils might be due to the fact that, though the native 
ability of over-age children is less than that of children 
under normal age and of normal age, the greater maturity 
of over-age children enables them to do better the work 
of the 1A. Should investigation prove this to be true, there 
would be ample grounds for modifying, in favor of chil- 
dren under normal and of normal age, the work of the 1A 
grade. 
In each of the grades 1A-4B, inclusive, with the excep- 
tion of the 4A, the rate of promotion was higher for nor- 
mal pupils than for pupils under normal. From the 5B 
on, however, the higher rate in each grade was for children 
1 With the data at hand it was impossible to distinguish between 
pupils over age because of late entrance and pupils over age because 
of slow progress in school.

under normal age. It therefore appears that children under 
normal age, although they must have greater native ability, 
do not do as well in the lower grades, as a rule (probably 
because of immaturity), as pupils of normal age, but that

younger pupils (owing doubtless to superior capacity) do 
better than pupils of normal age in each of the grades from 
the 5A to the 8B. 
With the exception of the 1A grade, the rate of promo- 
tion was higher in each grade from 4.43 per cent. to 10.21 
per cent. for pupils of normal age than for over-age pupils. 
By reason of this lower rate of promotion, it would seem 
that over-age pupils have decidedly less capacity for regular
-P-A-G-E-160
  150 Problems in Elementary School Administration 
- school work than pupils of normal age, or enjoy decidedly 
less favorable home surroundings, or have both less capac- 
ity and less favorable home surroundings. Investigation 
should be made to determine whether this difference in rate 
of promotion for normal pupils and for over-age pupils is 
due to home surroundings or to difference in capacity for 
regular school work; also to what extent over age is due 
to late entrance and to what extent it is due to failure to be 
regularly promoted. 
There is no reason to suppose that the lower rate of pro- 
motion prevailing among over-age children was exceptional 
for the February-June term, 1911. Hence, it would appear 
that the factors, whether late entrance, lack of capacity, or 
conditions in the home, or in the school, which cause the 
child to become over age continue to operate, with the re- 
sult that over-age children tend to fall farther and farther 
behind. The cumulative effect of over age is shown by 
Table XL. 
Whether the decidedly lower rate of promotion, with 
the exception of the 1A grade, for over-age pupils, and the 
decided decrease in the rate of promotion with each in- 
crease in the length of the period of over age, are due to 
lack of capacity, to home conditions, or to conditions in 
the school, or to all these factors together, this lower rate 
is evidence of the wisdom of the special classes (“E” 
classes) in which special attention and direction are given 
to over-age pupils; also evidence of the need of increased 
provisions for over-age children. The 9,921 pupils on 
register June 30, 1911, three and more years over age, the 
22,547 between two and three years behind their grades, 
and the 62,247 between one and two years over age would 
certainly profit from special attention. It does not follow, 
however, that these over-age pupils should all be put in 
“E” classes, which add approximately 50 per cent. to the 
cost of educating an elementary school pupil. An investi- 
gation should be made in each case to determine to what 
extent over age is due to late entrance and to what extent

it is due to slow progress, that is, to retardation. For it is 
obvious that the treatment of a group of pupils over age 
by reason of late entrance and who have received promotion 
regularly should be different from the treatment of a group 
of pupils over age because of failure to be regularly pro- 
moted. 
Further, earnest consideration should be given to the 
question of whether or not large numbers of over-age pu- 
pils (over age merely because of late entrance) and of re- 
tarded pupils (over age because of failure to be promoted) 
could not be cared for quite as well through segregating 
them into classes of standard size and adapting the course 
of study to their abilities and needs, hence without in- 
creased expense, as through segregating them into “E”

OVER AGE AS A FACTOR IN NON-PROMOTION AND CON- 
GESTION 
When over age is taken as the expression of certain per- 
sistent conditions, the extent to which it is a factor in in- 
creasing the number of non-promotions, and hence in in- 
creasing congestion, is shown by Table XLI. This table 
gives the actual number of over-age pupils non-promoted, 
the number that would have been non-promoted at the rate 
of non-promotion for pupils of normal age, the decrease

and also the per cent. of decrease in the number of non- 
promotions at the rate of non-promotion for pupils of nor- 
malage. (See page 152.) 
Had the rate of non-promotion been the same for over- 
age pupils as for normal pupils, there would have been a 
reduction in each grade, with the exception of the 1A, in 
the number of over-age pupils not promoted. The reduc- 
tion would have varied from 30.80 per cent. in the 1B to 63 
per cent. in the 5B. While there would have been more 
non-promotions in the 1A by 233, there would have been 
a total net reduction in non-promotions of 16,784, or 52.07 
per cent.—equivalent to one less non-promotion to each 
thirteen over-age pupils on register. Over age—as the 
expression of persistent conditions—is, therefore, an im- 
portant factor in increasing the number of non-promotions, 
and hence in increasing the amount of congestion. 
CONCLUSIONS 
The conclusions from the foregoing discussion may be 
thus summarized: 
(1) There were 215,333 over-age pupils in regular 
classes at the end of the February-June term, 1911, or 37.87 
per cent. of all pupils on register in regular classes were 
behind the grade for their age. 
(2) Of the 215,333 over-age pupils, 120,618, or 56.01 
per cent., were less than one year over age; 62,247, or 
28.91 per cent., between one and two years; 22,547, or 
10.47 per cent., between two and three years; and 9,921, or 
4.61 per cent., three years and more. 
(3) Pupils between one and two years over age drop 
from school in increasing numbers after the 6B grade; 
those between two and three years over age begin to leave 
after the 5B, and those three years and more over age find
-P-A-G-E-164
  154 Problems in Elementary School Administration 
it increasingly difficult to remain in school after the 4B 
grade. 
(4) Judged by the length of the period pupils are over 
normal, over age is the least serious in the 1A grade; grows 
increasingly serious to the 5A-5B grades; and thereafter 
gradually declines in seriousness to the 8B, but never be- 
comes less serious than in the 1A grade. 
(5) In each of the grades 1A-4B, inclusive, with the 
exception of the 4A, the rate of promotion was higher for 
normal pupils than for pupils under normal age. From 
the 5B on, however, the higher rate in each grade was for 
pupils under normal age. 
(6) With the exception of the 1A grade, the rate of 
promotion was higher in each grade from 4.43 per cent. to 
10.21 per cent. for pupils of normal age than for over-age 
pupils. ; 
(7) When over age is viewed as the expression of the 
lack of ability among children, or of the failure of the 
school to adapt its requirements to the abilities of pupils, 
or of unfavorable home conditions, or of these and other 
factors together, over age is cumulative; that is, over-age 
children tend to fall farther and farther behind. 
(8) Over age is a decided factor in increasing the num- 
ber of non-promotions, and hence increasing the amount 
of congestion. 
In view of these facts, we recommend: 
(1) That classes in which special attention and direc- 
tion are given to over-age pupils be provided at 
least for all pupils two and more years behind their 
grade. 
(2) That an investigation be made of the pupils now 
in “E” classes to determine to what extent the over 
   
-P-A-G-E-165
(3) 
(4)   
Over Age and Non-Promotion 155 
age of the pupils in these classes is due to late 
entrance and to what extent it is due to slow prog- 
ress or retardation; and to determine to what ex- 
tent the pupils in the classes are classified and the 
instruction given is determined according as they 
are over age because of late entrance or slow 
progress. 
That before additional “E” classes are organized 
serious consideration be given to the question of 
whether or not large numbers of over-age children 
cannot be better provided for through segregating 
them into classes of standard size (hence causing 
no increase in cost) and through adapting the 
course of study to their abilities and needs, than 
through segregating them into “E” classes as now 
organized and conducted and increasing the cost. 
That data be collected and so reported that it will 
not only be possible to determine the exact amount 
of over age, but to determine to what extent over 
age is due to late entrance and to what extent it is 
due to slow progress or retardation.

  CHAPTER X 
INABILITY TO USE THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE 
AND NON-PROMOTION 
a are thousands of pupils enrolled in the ele- 
mentary schools of the City of New York who are 
foreign born, or who are of foreign-born parentage. To a 
large proportion of these children the English language is 
essentially a foreign language. Classes have been organ- 
ized—“C” classes—to give special help to such children, to 
the end that they may more quickly acquire a working 
knowledge of the English language and be prepared, at an 
early date, to take their place in regular classes. Despite 
the help given by “C” classes,! there are pupils in regular 
classes who, in the opinion of the teachers, have such diffi- 
culty in understanding and in using the English language 
that this interferes with their progress through the school. 
NUMBER OF PUPILS IN REGULAR CLASSES UNABLE TO USE 
THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE 
The number of pupils in regular classes as of June 30, 
1911, whose inability to use the English language was, in 
the opinion of teachers, interfering with their school prog- 
ress is shown in Table XLII. This table gives by grades 
the number of pupils unable to use the English language, 
the per cent. of the register of each grade unable to use the 
English language, also the per cent. of all such pupils in 
each grade. (See page 157.) 
It will be observed that there were 8,739 pupils, or 1.54

of the teachers, as to interfere with their school work. Of 
these 8,739 pupils unable to use the English language, over 
one-half—s5.87 per cent.—were in the 1A and 1B grades 
(3,648, or 41.74 per cent., in the 1A and 1,235, or 14.13 
per cent., in the 1B); in the 1A-3B grades together there 
were 6,986, or 79.94 per cent. The remaining 1,753, or 
20.06 per cent., were in the grades 4A-8B, ranging from 
354, or 4.05 per cent., in the 4A to eleven, or .13 of 1 per 
cent., in the 8B grade. It will be observed that the per cent. 
of the total register unable to use the English language is 
the highest in the 1A grade, being 8.48 per cent., and that 
the per cent. decreases from 2.48 per cent. in the 1B to .06 
of I per cent. in the 8B.

EFFECT OF INABILITY TO USE THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE ON 
RATE OF PROMOTION 
The number of pupils in each grade unable to use the 
English language is, therefore, relatively small. Hence, 
whatever the rate of promotion for such pupils, this would 
affect but slightly the rate of promotion for the grade as a 
whole. Just what the effect of the presence of such pupils 
in regular classes was on the rate of promotion for the 
grade as a whole at the end of the February-June term,

  1911, is shown by Table XLIII. This table gives by grades 
the rate of promotion at the end of the February-June term, 
1911, for pupils able to use the English language; the rate 
of promotion in regular classes (includes both pupils able 
 
-P-A-G-E-169
    Inability to Use the English Language 159 
and pupils unable to use the English language); and the 
difference in the rate of promotion in regular classes due 
to the presence of pupils unable to use the English lan- 
guage. 
Had there been no pupils in regular classes unable to 
use the English language the rate of promotion at the end 
of the February-June term, 1911, would have been some- 
what higher in every grade. It would have been higher in 
the 1A by 1.54 per cent.; in the 1Bby .42 of 1 per cent.; 
and higher in the remaining grades by from .03 of 1 per 
cent. to .20 of 1 per cent. Such differences—even that in 
the 1A grade—are very small. Hence, the presence of 
pupils in regular classes unable to use the English language 
had no material effect on the rate of promotion at the end 
of the February-June term, 1911, for the grade as a whole. 
RATE OF PROMOTION FOR PUPILS ABLE AND FOR PUPILS 
UNABLE TO USE THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE 
Nevertheless, inability to use the English language ma- 
terially affects the school progress of children. This will be 
seen, if the rate of promotion for pupils able to use the Eng- 
lish language is compared with the rate of promotion for 
pupils unable to use it. 
Table XLIV gives by grades the rate of promotion at 
the end of the February-June term, 1911, for pupils able 
to use the English language; the rate of promotion for 
pupils unable to use the English language; also the differ- 
ence in the rate of promotion in favor of pupils able to 
use the English language. 
The rate of promotion at the end of the February-June 
term, 1911, for pupils able to use the English language 
was higher, it will be observed, in every grade, from 4.49 
per cent. to 58.12 per cent., than for pupils unable to use 
it. The greatest difference in the rate of promotion for 
these two classes of children was in certain of the higher 
grades. By reason of the number of pupils affected, the  
-P-A-G-E-170
  160 Problems in Elementary School Administration 
smaller difference in the lower grades is, however, more 
significant. When measured by the difference in the rate 
of promotion, inability to use the English language seri- 
ously interferes, therefore, in regular classes, with the

child’s chances of promotion, lessening his chances from 
4.49 per cent. to 58.12 per cent. 
The decidedly lower rate of promotion for pupils unable 
to use the English language is evidence of the wisdom of 
special classes (“‘C” classes) for the instruction of such 
children; and the number of such children at the end of the 
February-June term in the regular classes, particularly of 
the 1A-3B grades—6,986—indicates that the number of 
“C” classes should be greatly increased. It also emphasizes 
the necessity of providing a flexible course of study so that, 
 
-P-A-G-E-171
  Inability to Use the English Language 161 
where there is need, additional time may be devoted in 
regular classes to giving children a working knowledge of 
the English language. 
INABILITY TO USE THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE AS A FACTOR 
IN NON-PROMOTION AND IN CONGESTION 
The actual effect on the number of non-promotions of 
the lower rate of promotion for pupils unable to use the 
English language is shown by Table XLV. This table gives 
by grades the number of non-promotions among pupils un- 
able to use the English language, the number of non-pro-

motions there would have been among such pupils at the 
rate of non-promotion for pupils able to use the English 
language, also the decrease and the per cent. of decrease in 
the number of non-promotions among such pupils at the 
rate of non-promotion for pupils able to use the English 
language. 
Had the rate of non-promotion been the same as for 
pupils able to use the English language there would have 
been, among pupils unable to use the English language, a 
decrease in every grade in the number of non-promotions. 
The decrease would have varied from six in the 8B to 662 
in the 1A, and the per cent. of decrease would have ranged 
from 33.33 per cent. to 85.71 per cent.; while, in all the 
grades together, there would have been 1,362 fewer non- 
promotions, or a decrease of 50.35 per cent.—the equiva- 
lent of one less non-promotion to each six pupils on register 
unable to use the English language. 
When viewed in relation to the number of pupils in- 
volved, inability to use the English language is, therefore, 
a decided factor in increasing the number of non-promo- 
tions, but, because of the relatively small number of such 
children, it contributes very slightly in the lower and prob- . 
ably not at all in the upper grades to congestion. 
CONCLUSIONS 
The foregoing discussion is summarized in the following 
conclusions : 
(1) The presence of pupils in the regular classes of a 
grade unable to use the English language had no material 
effect, at the end of the February-June term, 1911, on the 
rate of promotion for the grade as a whole. 
(2) But the rate of promotion for pupils able to use 
the English language was higher in each of the grades, 
from 4.49 per cent. to 58.12 per cent., than for pupils un- 
able to use the English language. 
 
-P-A-G-E-173
  
Inability to Use the English Language 163 
(3) When viewed in relation to the number of pupils 
involved, inability to use the English language is a decided 
factor in increasing the number of non-promotions, but, 
because of the relatively small number of such children, it 
contributes to congestion only slightly in the lower and 
probably not at all in the upper grades. 
(4) Although the presence of pupils in regular classes 
unable to use the English language, because of the rela- 
tively small number of such pupils, does not affect the rate 
of promotion for a grade as a whole or add materially to 
congestion, inability to use the English language does affect 
decidedly the school progress of those pupils who are un- 
able to use the English language. In view of the conclu- 
sions stated above, we recommend: 
(1) That “C” classes—classes for the instruction of 
pupils unable to use the English language—be pro- 
vided at once, at least for all pupils in the 1A grade 
unable to use the English language. 
(2) That the course of study be made so flexible that, 
where there is need, additional time may be de- 
voted in regular classes to aiding children to ac- 
quire a working knowledge of the English lan- 
guage.

CHAPTER. Xf 
PART TIME AND NON-PROMOTION 
MEANING OF WHOLE TIME AND PART TIME 
WING to the chronic lack of sufficient schoolrooms 
there have developed in the elementary schools 
of the city two kinds of classes—whole-time classes and 
part-time classes. Children in whole-time classes are in 
school the standard day—five hours; hence each whole-time 
class requires one schoolroom. Children in part-time 
classes are in school but three hours and three-quarters ;* 
hence two part-time classes are accommodated in one room 
on the same day. By putting large numbers of children on 
part time it has been possible to provide, in a way, for all 
the children admitted to the elementary schools of the city. 
CONDITIONS GIVING RISE TO PART TIME 
In addition to the increase in register, three policies of 
the Board of Education (all to be highly commended) have 
contributed to make the number of pupils (68,610) on part 
time June 30, 1o11, larger than the number (35,347) on 
part time June 30, 1902: (1) The policy inaugurated in 
1903 of admitting to school all children of school age. 
Prior to 1903 when a school was full the principal might, 
at his discretion, refuse admission. In consequence, there 
was in nearly every school in crowded districts a waiting 
list. It was not uncommon for a child to be on this list a 
half year and even a whole year. (2) The policy of re-

Part Time and Non-Promotion 165 
ducing “classes of enormous and irrational sizes”—classes 
having from one hundred to one hundred and fifty pupils; 
also of reducing the register of all regular classes to fifty 
and less. (3) The policy of providing special classes for 
over-age, backward, and defective children. Part time, as 
it now exists in the city, is, therefore, not only the result of 
the continued failure to provide adequate school accommo- 
dations for the increase in register, but also to provide ade- 
quate accommodations to carry into effect the educational 
policies of the Board of Education. 
DIFFERENT ATTITUDES TOWARD PART TIME 
The school authorities have, as a rule, looked with favor 
on part time as a means of doing, under adverse conditions, 
the most for the greatest number of school children; but 
have regarded part time in itself as an evil which should be 
abolished whenever school accommodations became ade- 
quate to give each child a full day’s schooling of the kind 
best suited to his needs. 
The cost of providing modern school accommodations, 
the presence at times of part-time classes even in the sixth 
grade, and differences of opinion among theorists on the 
proper length of the school day for young children have 
led some persons to believe that, while part time is an 
evil in the upper grades, it is preferable to whole time in 
the two lowest grades; and hence, on both economic and 
educational grounds, should be made universal in the 1A 
and 1B grades. That is, it is maintained by some persons 
that the standard school day for all children in the 1A and 
1B grades should be three and a half hours; and the time 
of attending school so arranged that one schoolroom will 
accommodate two classes—one class to attend in the fore- 
noon only, the other in the afternoon only.?

QUESTIONS INVOLVED IN PART TIME 
The questions involved in part time may be thus stated: 
Do the best interests of children demand that each child, in 
whatever grade, shall enjoy a whole day’s schooling? Or 
 
-P-A-G-E-177
  Part Time and Non-Promotion 167 
can the interests of children be equally well conserved by 
universalizing part time in the 1A and 1B grades, thereby 
doing away with it above the 1B grade? Or are the best in-

-P-A-G-E-178
  168 Problems in Elementary School Administration 
is it an evil only above the 1B grade? Or does it do chil- 
dren in the elementary school no harm to be on part time one 
term or more? 
A definite answer to these questions would require an 
investigation exceeding the means and the time at the dis- 
posal of the present inquiry. It would need to consider the 
problem from at least three points of view—the physical, 
the educational, and the social or ethical. It would be 
necessary, among other things, (1) to measure the effect 
of the two kinds of classes on the health and physical devel- 
opment of children; (2) to examine the school achieve- 
ments of the children in each kind of class; and (3) to 
study the differences in the interests, habits, and conduct 
of children in school the whole day (five hours) and of 
children in school only a part of the day (three hours and 
three-quarters). 
With the time and means at our disposal it has been pos- 
sible, in addition to holding conferences with principals and 
teachers, to collect data on but one phase of the educational 
aspect of the problem—the rate of promotion in the two 
kinds of classes. 
RATE OF PROMOTION IN WHOLE-TIME AND IN PART-TIME 
CLASSES 
Table XLVII gives by grades, both for whole-time 
classes and for part-time classes, the per cent. of the register 
as of June 30, 1911, promoted and the per cent. not pro- 
moted ; also the per cent. of promotion in whole-time classes 
over or under the per cent. of promotion in part-time 
classes. (See page 169.) 
In the twelve grades in which there were both whole- and 
part-time classes it will be observed that the rate of promo- 
tion in whole-time classes was higher than in part-time 
classes in nine and lower in three grades. The rate of pro- 
motion was lower in whole-time classes in the 4A, the 4B, 
and the 6B grades and higher in the 1A-3B, the 5A, the 
 
-P-A-G-E-179
  Part. Time and Non-Promotion 169 
5B, and the 6A grades. The largest difference was in the 
6A, where 4.78 per cent. more pupils were promoted in 
whole-time classes than in part-time classes. A difference 
in the rate of promotion in the lower grades is, however, 
more significant than in the higher grades, because 88.84 
per cent of all part-time pupils are in the 1A-3B grades,’

and in each of these grades the rate of promotion was lower 
in part-time than in whole-time classes. 
The significance of the higher rate of promotion in 
whole-time classes than in the part-time classes in nine out 
of twelve grades is clearly seen if the actual number of 
pupils promoted in part-time classes is compared with the

in whole-time classes. 
Table XLVIII gives by grades the register in part-time 
classes as of June 30, 1911, the number in part-time classes 
promoted, June 30, 1911, and the number that would have 
been promoted at the rate in whole-time classes; and also 
the difference between the last two numbers.

(Net Increase)   Had the rate of promotion been the same in the part-time 
classes of the 1A grade as it was in the whole-time classes 
of this grade the number of part-time promotions would 
have been increased, it will be observed, by 406; in the 1A- 
3B grades, which contain 88.84 per cent. of all part-time 
pupils, by 731; and in part-time classes as a whole there 
would have been a net increase of 782. That is, the lower
-P-A-G-E-181
  Part Time and Non-Promotion 171 
rate of promotion prevailing in part-time classes resulted 
in the 1A grade in one less promotion to each forty-one 1A 
pupils; in the 1A-3B grades in one less promotion to each 
eighty-three pupils in these grades; and in part-time classes 
as a whole in one less promotion to each eighty-seven part- 
time pupils. Rate of promotion taken by itself is not a 
satisfactory measure of school achievements; because, as 
stated above, promotions are at times made for other rea- 
sons than that pupils are prepared for the work of the next 
grade—i. e., because of the crowded conditions of a school. 
Hence, there is no reason to believe that the school achieve- 
ments of pupils promoted in part-time classes were higher 
by reason of the lower rate than the achievements of pupils 
promoted in whole-time classes. Indeed, since part time 
indicates congestion, and congestion may tend to “forced” 
promotions, it is quite probable that the achievements of 
the pupils promoted in part-time classes were not higher, 
to say the least, than the achievements of pupils promoted 
in whole-time classes. 
PART TIME AS A FACTOR IN NON-PROMOTION AND CON- 
GESTION 
The lower rate of promotion prevailing at the end of the 
February-June term, 1911, in part-time classes resulted, as 
we have seen, in but 782 fewer promotions out of a total of 
68,610 part-time pupils than would have been the case had 
the rate of promotion been the same as in whole-time 
classes.1 Hence, the direct effect of part time on promo- 
tions, as promotions were made at the end of the February- 
June term, 1911, was small. There may, however, be cer- 
tain important indirect effects, such as indifference to school 
work, bad conduct, and truancy, which affect materially the 
future progress of children. These possible indirect effects 
of part time should be thoroughly investigated. 
Tf part time was a small factor in increasing the number 
1See Table XLVIII, page 170.
-P-A-G-E-182
  172 Problems in Elementary School Administration 
of non-promotions at the end of the February-June term, 
IQII, it was a still smaller factor in contributing to conges- 
tion. At most, owing to the lower rate of promotion pre- 
vailing in part-time classes, there were but 782 additional 
pupils left in the several grades to augment the numbers 
in these grades in September. There is every reason to 
believe that these 782 additional pupils, distributed as they 
were among nine different grades, were all absorbed with- 
out the formation of a single additional class and without 
materially adding to the numbers in any one class. 
Part time, therefore, when judged solely in view of pro- 
motions as they were made at the end of the February- 
June term, 1911, is but a slight factor in increasing the 
number of non-promotions, and probably had no effect on 
increasing congestion. 
KINDS OF PART-TIME CLASSES 
In the foregoing discussion the rate of promotion at the 
end of the February-June term, 1911, in part-time classes 
has been contrasted with the rate of promotion in whole- 
time classes; hence, part-time classes have been treated as 
a whole—that is, as if there were but one kind. There are, 
however, four different kinds of part-time classes: A. M. 
part-time classes, p. M. part-time classes, alternating part- 
time classes, and “Ettinger” part-time classes. 
In a. M. part-time classes pupils attend school for at 
least a term in the forenoon only; in Pp. M. part-time classes 
for at least a term in the afternoon only; while in alternat- 
ing part-time classes pupils attend a part of a term in the 
forenoon only and a part of a term in the afternoon only. 
The length of the school day in these three kinds of part- 
time classes varies from three hours and three-quarters to 
four hours. When the day is three hours and three-quar- 
ters in length, a. M. part-time classes begin work at 8.30 
and stop at 12.15; Pp. M. part-time classes begin at 12.30 and 
continue to 4.15. When the school day is four hours, the 
   
-P-A-G-E-183
Part Time and Non-Promotion 173 
time is divided thus: a. M. part-time classes, 8.15 to 12.15, 
and p. M. part-time classes, 12.15 to 4.15. The hours are 
the same for alternating part-time classes, but the fore- 
noon classes alternate with the afternoon classes. These 
changes from forenoon to afternoon and from afternoon 
to forenoon are made in some schools at the end of each 
fourth week, and in others at the end of each ten weeks. 
While three hours and three-quarters to four hours is 
the length of the school day in these three kinds of part- 
time classes, pupils in each kind, falling behind and in need 
of special help, are brought back for an hour to an hour 
and a quarter for individual instruction. Children in a. M. 
part-time classes return in the afternoon and children in 
P. M. part-time classes come in the forenoon. Any avail- 
able nook or corner of the school building is used for this 
individual work. In this way a considerable number of the 
children in these three kinds of part-time classes not only 
receive a whole day’s schooling (five hours), but receive 
a considerable amount of personal attention.' 
Ettinger part-time classes are distinguished from A. M., 
p. M., and alternating part-time classes by the fact that in 
Ettinger part-time classes the school day is practically five 
hours in length. Children in Ettinger part-time classes are 
not under actual instruction five hours per day, but they 
are under the influence of the school for that length of time 
daily. This is accomplished by alternating each two classes 
between a classroom and the “yard.” When one class is 
receiving instruction in the classroom the other is in the 
“yard,” where they have play, physical training, and drill 
—particularly in the three R’s. Each class is thus kept 
under educative direction the whole day (five hours) .* 
1 Manual of Board of Education, Section 45, Paragraph 12, page 60. 
2“Vard” is the term used in New York City to designate that portion 
of the first floor of a school building which serves as an assembly 
place for children prior to the opening of school and for play and 
physical training. 
8 As the yard takes the place of a classroom for a part of the school 
day, it is obvious that Ettinger part-time classes are to be found only 
in schools having yards.

The reasons why principals prefer one kind of part time 
to another kind are revealed in the following quotations 
taken from special reports from principals to this Com- 
mittee: 
“T do not believe in alternating the time . . . because 
it leads to irregular habits of living, both in sleeping and 
eating. The boys are best in the morning, when they 
come clean and not all tired out with hard play. I find 
that the mothers let the girls sleep later for the after- 
noon work, and they, too, come clean and rested.” 
“Part-time boys are held to better attendance and less 
truancy, from homes where the mother is employed, by 
attendance in the morning classes. If on the street dur- 
ing the forenoon it is hard for the mothers to find the 
boys at 11.30 for luncheon and prepare them for 
school.” 
“The mid-term alternation I have tried thoroughly 
and found impracticable because of the interference 
with the formation of habits of punctuality. It is al- 
most impossible to secure regular attendance and a habit 
of being on time if every ten weeks the time to come 
changes. It also makes serious trouble for the parents.” 
“We aim to alternate them [classes] each term. Any 
more frequent change is troublesome to the home do- 
mestic arrangements for luncheon, work hours, etc. 
Many of the mothers are washerwomen or otherwise 
   
-P-A-G-E-185
  Part Time and Non-Promotion 175 
employed . . . and frequent changes discommode them 
very much.” 
“T believe, in order to be just to every part-time pu- 
pil, it is necessary so to distribute the period of instruc- 
tion that no classes or group of classes will receive 
instruction during an entire term only in the afternoon, 
when physical and mental rhythm are at greater or less 
ebb. Pupils who report in the afternoon are generally 
tired because of a morning’s play on the street. They 
are less receptive than those who come in the morning.” 
NUMBER OF PUPILS IN EACH KIND OF PART-TIME CLASS 
The distribution at the end of the February-June term, 
1911, of part-time pupils among the several kinds of part- 
time classes is shown by Table XLIX. This table gives by 
grades the register and the per cent. of all part-time pupils 
on register June 30, 1911, in Ettinger part-time classes; 
also the same facts for alternating part-time classes, for 
A. M. part-time classes, and for p. mM. part-time classes. 
The 68,610 pupils on part time June 30, 1911, were dis- 
tributed as follows: 5,723, or 8.34 per cent., in Ettinger 
part-time classes; 43,939, or 64.04 per cent., in alternating 
part-time classes; 9,461, or 13.79 per cent., in A. M. part- 
time classes; and 9,487, or 13.83 per cent., in P. M. part- 
time classes. The part-time pupils in each of the grades 
1A-3B were distributed in about the same proportion among 
the different kinds of part-time classes. It will be noted 
also that there were no pupils in Ettinger part-time classes 
above the 4A grade, that the per cent. of all part-time pupils 
of each grade in alternating part-time classes decreases in 
each of the grades above the 4A, and that there is a corre- 
sponding increase in the per cent. in these grades in a. M. 
and in p. m. part-time classes. 
If, therefore, the different kinds of part time are ar- 
ranged in view of the total number of pupils in each kind 
June 30, 1911, the order would be as follows (page 177) :

RATE OF PROMOTION IN A. M. AND IN P. M. PART-TIME 
CLASSES 
Principals are generally agreed that better educational 
results are obtained in a. M. part-time classes than in P. M. 
part-time classes. Table L gives by grades the rate of pro- 
motion in A. M. and in Pp. M. part-time classes at the end 
of the February-June term, 1911; also the rate of promo- 
tion in A. M. part-time classes over or under the rate of pro- 
motion in P. M. part-time classes. 
The rate of promotion was higher, it will be observed, 
in A. M. part-time classes in all grades, with the exception 
of the 2A, the 2B, and the 5A, than in p. M. part-time

classes, varying from 6.51 per cent. in the 1A to 1.04 per 
cent. in the 1B; also the total rate in A. M. part-time classes 
was higher than in p. M. part-time classes by 2.14 per cent. 
It therefore appears that a. M. part-time classes afford more 
favorable opportunities for advancement than p. M. part- 
time classes, and hence, on the assumption that conditions 
of instruction and standards of promotion were the same 
in the two kinds of part-time classes—a legitimate assump- 
tion—a. M. part-time classes are preferable to Pp. M. part- 
time classes. 
It is thus possible to compare the rate of promotion in 
A. M. and in p. M. part-time classes and to judge of the 
relative efficiency of these two kinds of part time; but it is 
impossible to compare the rate of promotion in a. M. part- 
time classes and in Pp. M. part-time classes separately with 
the rate of promotion in whole-time classes or in alternating 
and in Ettinger part-time classes. 
The conditions which give rise to part time require that 
one room accommodate two classes. Hence, that there 
may be classes which attend school for a term in the fore- 
noon only, there must also be classes which attend school 
for a term in the afternoon only. A. M. and P. M. part- 
time classes are, therefore, inseparably connected; they are 
two parts of a whole and one part cannot exist without the 
other. Consequently, a. m. and p. M. part-time classes must 
be combined and viewed as one kind of part time if com- 
parisons are made between the relative efficiency of whole- 
time classes and different kinds of part-time classes.

Table LI gives by grades? the number out of each one 
hundred pupils on register promoted June 30, 1911, in 
1 There were only sixty-two pupils in the 6A and forty-two in the 
6B grades in alternating part-time classes, and only eighty-four pupils 
in the 6A and none in the 6B of A.M. and p.m. part-time classes com- 
bined; hence these grades have been omitted from this table. See table

Whole-Time and Ettinger Part-Time Classes 
It will be observed that one more pupil out of each hun- 
dred was promoted in the 1A grade in Ettinger part-time 
classes than in whole-time classes; in the IB two more; in 
the 2A three more; in the 3A two more; in the 3B four 
more; and in the 4A seven more. In the 2B the number 
promoted was the same in the two kinds of classes. With 
this one exception, more pupils were promoted in Ettinger 
part-time classes in each grade in which there were such 
classes than were promoted in whole-time classes in the 
same grades. 
Judged solely by rate of promotion, Ettinger part-time 
classes appear to be preferable to whole-time classes. But 
part of the difference in rate of promotion in favor of Et- 
tinger part-time classes may be due to the difference in the 
 
-P-A-G-E-190
  180 Problems in Elementary School Administration 
number of pupils on register. There were, for example, 
in 1A whole-time classes, 26,115 pupils and in 1A Ettin- 
ger part-time classes 1,526; in 3B whole-time classes 37,868, 
and in 3B Ettinger part-time classes 370. Also part of this 
difference in rate of promotion might be due to the in- 
fluence of congestion. Further, rate of promotion throws 
no light upon the relative educational superiority of these 
two kinds of classes. To determine their relative superior- 
ity would require an extensive investigation, among other 
things, of the educational achievements, of the punctuality 
and regularity of attendance, of the school conduct, and of 
the health of the children in these two kinds of classes. 
Hence, Ettinger part-time classes cannot be declared pref- 
erable to whole-time classes merely on the ground of a 
higher rate of promotion for the February-June term, 1911. 
Whole-Time and Alternating Part-Time Classes 
If the promotions in whole-time and alternating part- 
time classes are compared, it will be observed (a) that in 
only one grade, the 4B, was the number of pupils promoted 
per hundred in alternating part-time classes higher than 
the number promoted in whole-time classes; (b) that the 
rate of promotion in the 2A, 4A, 5A, and 5B grades was 
the same; and (c) that, in each of the grades 1A-3B (with 
the exception of the 2A, as noted above), containing 90 
per cent. of all the children in alternating part-time classes, 
the number of pupils promoted per hundred was less than 
in whole-time classes. Hence, when judged solely on the 
basis of the rate of promotion at the end of the February- 
June term, 1911, alternating part-time classes afford less 
favorable opportunities for advancement than whole-time 
classes. 
Whole-Time and A. M. and P. M. Part-Time Classes 
Further, it will be observed that in two grades, the 1B 
and the 3A, the number of pupils promoted per hundred 
 
-P-A-G-E-191
  
Part Time and Non-Promotion 181 
in A. M. and Pp. M. part-time classes combined is the same as 
in whole-time classes, but that in all other grades the num- 
ber promoted per hundred pupils is less. Hence, the oppor- 
tunities for advancement in A. m. and p. M. classes combined 
are less favorable than in whole-time classes. 
Ettinger Part-Time and Alternating and A. M. and P. M. 
Part-Time Classes 
Since the rate of promotion was higher at the end of the 
February-June term, 1911, in Ettinger part-time classes 
than in whole-time classes, and the rate of promotion was 
lower both in alternating part-time classes and in a. M. and 
P. M. part-time classes combined, it follows that the rate 
of promotion was higher in Ettinger part-time classes than 
in either of the two other kinds of part-time classes. 
Hence, Ettinger part-time classes afford more favorable 
conditions for advancement than either alternating or a. M. 
and p. M. part-time classes. 
Considering the higher rate of promotion in Ettinger 
part-time classes, also the fact that in these classes children 
are under the influence of the school the whole day (five 
hours), and the favorable experience of teachers and prin- 
cipals with these classes, we are of the opinion that the 
Board of Education should insist, when part time is neces- 
sary, that principals establish, wherever possible, Ettinger 
part-time classes! At least this should be done until fur- 
ther investigation into the efficiency of the different kinds 
of part time affords evidence that it is better to do other- 
wise. 
Alternating and A. M. and P. M. Part-Time Classes 
Finally, it remains to consider the relative efficiency of 
alternating and a. M. and Pp. M. part-time classes. Table 
LII gives by grades the register as of June 30, I9QII, in 
1Ettinger part-time classes can, of course, be introduced only in 
schools having suitable yards.

been promoted in the 1A grade; thirty-eight fewer in the 
1B; and fourteen fewer in the 3A; whereas fifty-eight more 
would have been promoted in the 2A; sixteen more in the 
2B; and eighty-nine more in the grades 3B-6A; or, in all 
grades combined, there would have been a net increase of 
only twenty-nine additional promotions out of 18,948 pupils. 
There is, therefore, no practical difference between the rate 
 
-P-A-G-E-193
    Part Time and Non-Promotion 183 
of promotion in alternating and in a. m. and P. M., part-time 
classes combined. 
It will, however, be remembered that the rate of promo- 
tion in A. M. part-time classes, when considered separately 
from Pp. M. part-time classes, was found to be considerably 
higher in all but two grades than in p. m. part-time classes." 
Hence, the disadvantages of part time fall most heavily on 
those pupils who attend school for a term in the afternoon 
only. A. M. part-time classes and Pp. M. part-time classes are 
alternated—that is, pupils who attend one term in the fore- 
noon only attend the following term, as a rule, in the after- 
noon only. The disadvantages of attending in the after- 
noon only are thus somewhat equalized. There is, how- 
ever, no assurance that a pupil on part time one term will 
be on part time the next; hence, no assurance that the dis- 
advantages suffered by attending school one term in the 
afternoon only will be equalized by attendance the following 
term in the forenoon only. In view, therefore, not only of 
the slight difference in the rate of promotion in favor of 
alternating part-time classes, but also in view of the proba- 
bility of a more equitable distribution of the disadvantages 
of part time in such classes, we are inclined to believe that 
alternating part-time classes are to be preferred to A. mM. 
and p. m. part-time classes. 
CONCLUSIONS 
The conclusions from the foregoing discussion may be 
summarized as follows: 
(1) The rate of promotion at the end of the February- 
June term, 1911, was higher in whole-time classes than in 
part-time classes in nine out of the twelve grades in which 
there were both kinds of classes, but, had the higher rate 
of promotion in whole-time classes prevailed in part-time 
classes, the number of promotions in part-time classes would 
have been increased by only 782. 
1See table on page 176.
-P-A-G-E-194
    184 Problems in Elementary School Administration 
(2) Part time, so far as our data go, is but a very 
slight factor in increasing the number of non-promotions, 
and probably augments congestion not at all. 
(3) The rate of promotion at the end of the February- 
June term, 1911, was not only higher in Ettinger part-time 
classes than in whole-time classes, but higher than in any 
other kind of part-time class. For this reason, and also 
because pupils in Ettinger part-time classes are under the 
influence of the school for five hours daily, the Board of 
Education may well insist, when part time is necessary, that 
principals establish, wherever possible, Ettinger part-time 
classes. 
(4) The rate of promotion differs little in alternating 
and in A. M. and p. m. part-time classes combined, but, since 
the disadvantages of part-time are probably more equally 
distributed in alternating than in a. m. and p. M. part-time 
classes, alternating part-time classes are preferable. 
(5) Considering the difference in rate of promotion in 
favor of whole-time classes, the physical, the educational, 
and the social questions involved in judging of the relative 
merits of whole-time and part-time classes, the custom in 
other cities of the country of making every effort to pro- 
vide accommodations for an all-day schooling for all ele- 
mentary school pupils, the strong demand in the community 
that each child, whatever his grade, have a whole day’s 
schooling, and the legal and social right of each child to a 
whole day’s schooling, the Board of Education is justified 
in attempting to eliminate part time from all the grades. 
But should the Board of Education request the funds to 
eliminate part time from all the grades, the Board of Esti- 
mate and Apportionment, in view of the differences of 
opinion and questions involved, would be justified in re- 
questing of the Board of Education an investigation into 
the relative merits of whole- and part-time classes, to the 
end that a definite policy with regard to school accommo- 
dation may be fixed on and carried out.

    CHAPTER XII 
THE PROBLEM OF PUPILS WHO LEAVE 
SCHOOL? 
1 all the foregoing discussions the pupils on register at 
the end of the term only have been considered. But 
the register at the end of the term does not include the thou- 
sands of pupils, exclusive of transfers, who have been on 
register and who have left before the end of the term. 
FAILURE TO COLLECT DATA ON PUPILS LEAVING SCHOOL 
The By-laws of the Board of Education provide that 
“the principal of each school shall keep a record which shall 
contain the names of all pupils dropped from the school 
register, with a statement of the reason therefor.’ ? But 
no report has ever been made for the city as a whole on the 
number of pupils leaving the elementary schools during a 
term or a school year and on the reasons therefor.

Fifteen thousand eight hundred and fifty-seven (15,857)   boys and 15,148 girls, a total of 30,995, or 5.17 per cent. 
of the total enrollment,’ dropped from the regular classes 
of the elementary schools during the February-June term, 
IQII; or one pupil in each twenty enrolled in regular classes 
left school before the end of the term. The number leaving 
the several grades varied from 761, or 3.75 per cent. of the 
total enrollment, in the 8B grade, to 3,055, or 9.94 per cent., 
in the 7A. 
From the 1A to the 5A the per cent. of boys leaving was 
slightly lower than the per cent. of girls leaving, whereas, 
from the 5B on, the reverse was true. Taking the several

grades together there was, however, little difference between 
the losses among boys, 5.26 per cent., and the losses among 
girls, 5.07 per cent., a difference of but .19 of 1 per cent. in 
favor of girls. 
AGES AND GRADES OF PUPILS LEAVING SCHOOL 
Whether pupils leaving school are out temporarily or 
permanently depends largely on the grade they are in and 
on their age at leaving. Table LIV gives by grades the 
number of pupils leaving the regular classes at each of the 
several ages: under six, six to seven, etc.; also the total 
number leaving at each age, and the per cent. leaving at 
each age of the total number dropping out. (See page 188.) 
The number of pupils leaving the regular classes at each 
of the several ages from six to seven up to thirteen to four- 
teen, inclusive, is quite uniform, varying from 1,843 (12 to 
13) to 2,515 (7 to 8), or from 5.95 per cent. to 8.11 per 
cent. of the total number leaving. The losses from four- 
teen to fifteen were the largest, 6,312, or 20.37 per cent. 
The number dropping out from fifteen to sixteen was like- 
wise large, 4,571, or 14.75 per cent., as was also the number 
from sixteen to seventeen, 2,381, or 7.68 per cent. 
Seventeen thousand three hundred and twelve (17,312), 
or 55.84 per cent., of the pupils leaving regular classes, 
were under fourteen. Of these, 2,190 were less than seven 
years of age and were, therefore, not of compulsory school 
age; 15,122 were, however, between seven and fourteen, 
and, in consequence, were subject to the Compulsory Edu- 
cation Law; 13,683, or 44.16 per cent., were fourteen and 
above. Of these, 822 were between fourteen and sixteen, 
and were also in the grades 1A-5A, hence could not qualify 
for labor certificates; the remaining 12,861 were, however, 
free, by reason of their age and their grade, to drop from 
school permanently. 15,944 (15,122 plus 822), or 51.44 
per cent. of those leaving regular classes, were, therefore, 
subject to the Compulsory Education Law, and 2,190 were

under compulsory school age. Hence, of the 30,995 pupils 
leaving during the February-June term, I911, 18,134 
(15,944 plus 2,190), or 58.51 per cent., will doubtless, in 
most part, return to school; but that 15,944 pupils of com- 
pulsory school age dropped from school during a single 
term is a serious matter and investigation should be made 
as to what extent these pupils had legal reasons for being 
out of school, and to what extent their being out was due to 
inefficiency on the part of the Department of Compulsory 
Attendance. 
EFFECTS ON REPORTS OF TAKING NO ACCOUNT OF PUPILS 
LEAVING 
The fact that no account is taken of the thousands of 
pupils leaving school leads to a defect in certain of the re- 
ports of the City Superintendent of Schools. A report on 
the number of pupils in the elementary schools of each of 
the several ages—under five, five to six, etc.—will illus- 
trate this defect. Table LV gives the number of pupils in 
the elementary school on register June 30, 1911, of each of 
the several ages—under five, five to six, etc.; the number 
of each age, together with the pupils leaving regular classes 
during the February-June term, 1911; also the number of 
pupils of each age leaving regular classes. (See page 190.) 
The number of pupils of each age given in column (1) 
is taken from the Annual Report of the City Superintend- 
ent of Schools for 1911. Excepting that the number of 
pupils of each age is given by totals instead of by sexes, this 
is his entire report on the ages of pupils in the elementary 
school. This report gives an idea of the number of pupils 
of each age on register at the end of the term, but gives no 
idea of the number of pupils of each age on register during 
the whole term. For this number one must turn to column 
(2).1 A report on ages that has to do only with pupils on 
1Column (2) gives the number of pupils of each age on register 
during the February-June term, 1911, with the exception of pupils 
leaving school from special classes.

tent misleading. This is particularly true of the reports on 
promotion and on over age.? 
REDUCING THE NUMBER LEAVING SCHOOL 
There is no reason to assume that the fact that 30,995 
pupils left the regular classes alone during the February- 
June term of 1911 is exceptional. There is every reason 
to believe that a similar number drop from school every 
term. Since, if pupils leave school prematurely, the very 
purpose for which the school exists is defeated, the problem 
of reducing the total number leaving and particularly of 
reducing the number leaving who are subject to the Com- 
pulsory Education Law demands immediate and earnest at- 
tention. 
Though principals and teachers may be doing much to 
keep down the number leaving, so long as the reports of 
the several schools on pupils leaving and on the reasons 
therefor are not tabulated, it is impossible for District Su- 
perintendents, Associate Superintendents, and the City Su- 
perintendent to give the help in the solution of this problem 
that they should give. As a preliminary step in the reduc- 
tion of school losses, we, therefore, recommend that the 
reports from the several schools on pupils leaving and on 
the reasons therefor be collected and tabulated, term by 
term, for the Greater City, to the end that the number 
dropping from school and the reasons therefor may be 
known and that the causes of their leaving, in so far as 
these lie within the school, may be eradicated. 
CONCLUSIONS 
The foregoing discussion may be thus summarized: 
(1) Thirty thousand nine hundred and_ ninety-five 
(30,995) pupils, or 5.17 per cent. of the total enrollment, 
in regular classes dropped from the elementary school dur- 
1See Annual Report of the City Superintendent of Schools for 1911,

ing the February-June term, 1911; or one pupil out of each 
twenty in regular classes left school before the end of the 
term. 
(2) Taking the several grades together, there was little 
difference between the losses among boys, 5.26 per cent., 
and the losses among girls, 5.07 per cent.—a difference of 
but .19 of I per cent. in favor of girls. 
(3) The number of pupils leaving regular classes at 
each of the several ages from six to seven up to thirteen to 
fourteen, inclusive, was quite uniform, varying from 1,843 
(12 to 13) to 2,515 (8 to 9), or from 5.95 per cent. to 
8.11 per cent. of the total number leaving. The losses from 
fourteen to fifteen were the largest, 6,312, or 20.37 per cent. 
The number dropping out from fifteen to sixteen was like- 
wise large, 4,571, or 14.75 per cent., as was also the number 
from sixteen to seventeen, 2,381, Or 7.68 per cent. 
(4) Of the 30,995 leaving regular classes during the 
February-June term, 1911, 15,944, or 51.44 per cent., were 
subject to the Compulsory Education Law.   
(5) Because no account is taken of the number of 
pupils leaving school, certain of the reports of the City Su- 
perintendent of Schools are incomplete. 
(6) The reduction of the number dropping from school 
and particularly the reduction of the number leaving who 
are subject to the Compulsory Education Law demand im- 
mediate and earnest attention. 
(7) To the end that the number leaving and the reasons 
therefor may be known, and that the causes of their leav- 
ing, in so far as they lie within the school, may be eradi- 
cated, we recommend that the reports from the several 
schools on the number dropping out and the reasons there- 
for be collected and tabulated term by term for the Greater 
City.

CHAPTER XIII 
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS AS 
TO NON-PROMOTION AND PART TIME 
SUMMARY of conclusions and recommendations is 
given at the end of each of the several sections of the 
foregoing report. It will, therefore, be necessary to bring 
together only certain of our conclusions and the more im- 
portant of our recommendations. 
THE CHIEF CAUSES OF NON-PROMOTION 
Among the chief causes of non-promotion assigned by 
the eight committees appointed in the fall of 1909 by the 
City Superintendent of Schools were Part Time, Excessive 
Size of Classes, Irregular Attendance, Late Entrance to 
School, Sluggish Mentality, and Ignorance of the English 
Language. 
Basing our conclusions on the rate of promotion at the 
end of the February-June term, 1911, we find, when each 
of these assigned causes is considered apart from the 
others: 
(1) That part time and excessive size of classes are re- 
sponsible for the non-promotion of relatively few 
pupils. 
(2) That irregular attendance is a decided factor in 
increasing the number of non-promotions. 
(3) That late entrance to school and sluggish men- 
tality, as expressed in over age, are material factors 
in causing non-promotion. 
193 
 
-P-A-G-E-204
  194 Problems in Elementary School Administration 
(4) That inability to use the English language increases 
decidedly, in the relatively small group of pupils 
affected, the number of pupils failing of promotion. 
SIZE OF CLASSES 
Considering the slightly lower rate of promotion at the 
end of the February-June term, 1911, for over-size classes, 
but more particularly the acknowledged educational disad- 
vantages of over-size classes, and the prevailing practice in 
other cities of the country, we recommend that whenever 
practicable all classes having more than fifty pupils be re- 
duced to classes of forty-five pupils. 
INABILITY TO USE THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE 
Basing our judgment on the decidedly lower rate of pro- 
motion at the end of the February-June term, 1911, for 
over-age pupils, and for pupils unable to use the English 
language, we recommend: 
(1) That classes in which special attention and direc- 
tion are given to over-age pupils be provided at 
least for all pupils two and more years behind their 
grade. 
(2) That “C” classes—classes for the instruction of 
pupils unable to use the English language—be pro- 
vided at least for all pupils in 1A classes unable to 
use the English language.   
FURTHER DATA NEEDED 
In this report certain of our conclusions and recommen- 
dations—for example, our recommendation to reduce all 
classes having above fifty pupils to forty-five pupils—do 
not rest so much on the facts presented as on educational 
opinion. Educational opinion, to have proper weight, 
should be supported by facts. To determine, on the basis
-P-A-G-E-205
i a a a a a a UR 
Conclusions and Recommendations 195 
of fact, the relative worth of whole-time and part-time 
classes, the proper size of class, and to answer, on the basis 
of fact, other questions raised in this report, such as the 
actual length of the present course of study, the actual 
length of time pupils are in school between six and four- 
teen, inclusive, etc., further data are needed. To collect 
some of the needed data it will be necessary to conduct 
special investigations; other data can be collected from the 
current and cumulative records of the schools. 
Among the more important special investigations we rec- 
ommend are investigations to determine: 
(1) The relative educational achievements of pupils in 
whole-time and part-time classes. 
(2) The relative educational worth of classes of each 
of the several sizes. 
(3) The proper limits of the period of elementary edu- 
cation. 
(4) The different groups of pupils of varying abilities 
and educational needs. 
(5) The extent to which pupils now in “E” classes are 
classified and instructed according as their over age 
is due to late entrance or to slow progress—retarda- 
tion. 
The Blank Form Recommended for the Collection of Fur- 
ther Data 
The more important items of the data we recommend to 
be collected, at least for a time, by terms from the current 
and cumulative records of the school, are shown in the 
blank following page 198. 
All the items called for in this blank are not now both 
matters of current and cumulative school record. The 
causes of absence due to late entrance, for example, are not 
now a part of the current record. Further, owing to the 
   
-P-A-G-E-206
    196 Problems in Elementary School Administration 
fact that the pupil’s record card (a cumulative record) was 
not introduced until June, 1909, it is impossible to give for 
all pupils now in school, who entered the 1A grade, the 
date of entrance and the total number of days in school 
from entrance in the 1A grade to June 28, 1912. These 
facts could be given only for pupils entering the 1A grade 
in the February-June term, 1909, and thereafter. Simi- 
larly, with regard to pupils entering later than the 1A 
grade. It is also impossible to give the total number of 
terms a pupil has been on part-time since entrance to school. 
But the current and cumulative records of the school are 
such, or can easily be made such, that all the items called 
for in the blank could, in due time, be supplied, and it is 
possible even now to supply the major part of them. 
If the recommended blank is adopted and those data 
which can now be supplied are collected and tabulated, data 
will be at hand similar to those presented in this report, and 
additional data as follows: 
(1) Data on the actual ages of children (Item 2), and 
these data, in connection with the data on grade 
(Item C) and on promotion and non-promotion 
(Items rr and 12), will make possible for the first 
time an accurate estimate of the amount and de- 
gree of over age in the entire system (exclusive of 
classes for the deaf, the blind, and crippled and de- 
fective children). 
(2) Data to show the amount of absence due to late 
entrance (“(1)” of “a” of Item 3). These data, 
together with data on absence due to irregular at- 
tendance (“b” of Item 3), will make it possible for 
the first time to determine the actual total amount 
of absence. Should teachers and principals be no- 
tified, at the beginning of a term, it would be pos- 
sible at the end of the term to collect data on the 
causes of late entrance. With a knowledge of the 
causes of late entrance, it would be possible to de-

termine to what extent such absence is due to home 
and other conditions, and to what extent it is due 
to failure to enforce the Compulsory Education 
Law. 
The data supplied on tardiness, conduct, and tru- 
ancy (Items 4, 5, and 6), along with the data on 
absence (Item 3), will go far to substantiate or to 
disprove the prevalent belief that part time has an 
unfavorable effect on the attendance, punctuality, 
and conduct of children. 
The data on pupils leaving school (Item 7), and 
the causes thereof (Item 8), will not only make it 
possible to make a complete report on register, ab- 
sence, promotion, non-promotion, and over age, 
etc., which is not now done, but the knowledge of 
the causes of leaving might make it possible to re- 
duce greatly the number dropping from school. 
Data will also be at hand (Item 14) to determine 
the number of beginners in the 1A grade, hence 
will supply the basis of estimating what portion of 
all pupils entering the school continue to the end of 
each grade. 
Data (Items 10, 11, and 12) to determine, with ac- 
curacy, the actual rate of promotion and of non- 
promotion, also the number of pupils receiving 
double promotion. 
Data (Item 13) to determine the actual length of 
time it takes pupils to complete each of the grades. 
Data (Items 14 and 15) to determine: 
(a) The actual total time pupils are in school 
between six and fourteen; also the total length 
of time they are in school. 
(b)! The actual total length of the elementary 
school course of study, also the actual total 
length of time it takes to complete a given num-
-P-A-G-E-208
  198 Problems in Elementary School Administration 
ber of grades, e. g., the 1A-6B grades, inclusive. 
(c) The best age of entering the 1A grade, 
when judged solely in view of progress through 
the school. 
Although it is impossible, as suggested above, to 
supply now the data called for in Items 14 and 15 
for all pupils, the data that can be supplied now will 
answer for practical purposes. 
(9) Should provision be made to collect the data called 
for in Item 16, some light will be thrown on the 
question whether part time affects unfavorably the 
school progress of children. 
(10) From Items 17 and 18, data will be at hand to 
determine whether the transfer of pupils from 
school to school affects unfavorably their advance- 
ment. 
The blank is drawn so that the data called for can 
be tabulated by a general tabulating machine. This 
method of tabulation deprives teachers and principals of 
the value to be derived from tabulating the data for their 
own school, but it minimizes the work imposed on them, 
and makes possible a larger use of the data than when the 
reports of the several teachers are summarized on a princi- 
pal’s blank. 
Should the data called for in this blank be collected, as 
we recommend, these data would not only supply a reliable 
basis for answering certain of the questions raised in this 
report, but would also supply currently a reliable basis for 
various kinds of administrative action in relation to them. 
Should data also be collected currently, as we would rec- 
ommend, on deficiencies in the several studies of the cur- 
riculum, these would supply the basis of adjusting the 
qualitative and quantitative requirements of the course of 
study to the varying abilities and needs of different groups 
of children.

     CHAPTER XIV 
THE SIGNIFICANCE OF OVER AGE 
HE Educational Laws of the State of New York not 
only make it obligatory on financial and school offi- 
cials to provide such facilities that the children of the state 
may have free opportunity to secure a complete elemen- 
tary education, but these laws also seek to guarantee this 
opportunity to each child of the state. 
THE AGE STANDARD SET BY LAW FOR THE SCHOOLS OF 
NEW YORK 
The Compulsory Education Law, which seeks to guaran- 
tee to the child free opportunity to secure a complete ele- 
mentary education, requires, under certain conditions, that 
children attend school regularly until they are sixteen years 
of age. But it is clearly indicated in this law that normal 
children, who attend school regularly, should be able to 
complete their elementary education by the time they are 
fourteen years old.t_ Hence, the state considers the attain- 
ment of the fourteenth birthday the normal age to com- 
plete the elementary school. 
How impossible it is for children to complete the work 
of the elementary school of the City of New York by their 
fourteenth birthday is revealed by the fact that of the pu- 
pils, exclusive of those in special classes, thirteen to four- 
teen years old, on the register after promotion June 30th 
for the five years 1907-1911 inclusive, only 20.82 per cent.

             had attained the eighth grade; 29.92 per cent., the seventh; 
25.57 per cent., the sixth; 15.44 per cent., the fifth; 6.06 
per cent., the fourth, and 2.19 per cent. were still in the 
third and lower grades.1_ That is, if these thirteen-to-four- 
teen-year-old pupils remained in school and progressed 
regularly, 20.82 per cent. would be between fourteen and 
fifteen years old on completing the elementary school; 29.92 
per cent. between fifteen and sixteen; 25.57 per cent. be- 
tween sixteen and seventeen; 15.44 per cent. between seven- 
teen and eighteen, and 8.25 per cent. eighteen and older. 
Pupils in considerable numbers remain in the elementary 
schools of the City of New York from one to three years 
after they are fourteen in order to complete the course.? 
Still larger numbers on becoming fourteen or on receiving 
employment certificates drop from school permanently, ir- 
respective of the grade they have attained. It is estimated 
that of all the pupils entering the elementary schools of the 
City of New York, 3.31 per cent. drop out before complet- 
ing the work of the fifth year; 11.29 per cent. before com- 
pleting the work of the sixth year; 38.55 per cent. before 
completing the work of the seventh year, and only 41.33 per 
cent. ever remain to complete the eighth or final year.® 
The fact that thousands of children remain in the ele- 
mentary schools of the City of New York until they are 
sixteen, seventeen, and eighteen years of age in order to 
complete the course of study and that tens of thousands of 
children, though remaining until they are fourteen and 
older, drop from school permanently without having been 
able to advance beyond the work of the sixth or seventh 
year, leads to the question of the grade a child of a given 
age should be entering or should be completing by a given 
age. 
  DEFINITION OF AGE LIMITS 
Certain age limits have been fixed for entering and for 
completing each of the several grades of the elementary 
8 See page 92. 1 See page 112, 2 See page 109.      
-P-A-G-E-212
  Significance of Over Age 201 
school. Children entering a grade before the age fixed for 
entering, or completing a grade before the age fixed for 
completion, are termed under age; children entering a grade 
at the age fixed for entrance, or completing a grade at the 
age fixed for completion, are termed normal age; children 
entering the grade older than the age fixed for entrance, or 
completing the grade older than the age fixed for comple- 
tion, are termed over age; that is, are behind the grade for 
their age. 
Had children an indefinite length of time in which to 
secure an education, the fact that they were behind the grade 
for their age would have no educational significance. But 
over age has educational significance, because the state only 
directly secures to the child the opportunity of attending 
school until he is fourteen, and because children in large 
numbers on becoming fourteen, either from necessity or 
choice, drop from school permanently. Hence, for children 
to fall behind their grade one or more years, means that they 
will probably drop from the elementary school without com- 
pleting one or more of the upper grades, and in conse- 
quence enter on some practical pursuit with only a sixth 
or seventh grade education.? 
OVER AGE AS A TEST OF EFFICIENCY OF A SCHOOL SYSTEM 
Since over-age children tend to fail to complete the work 
of the elementary school, just to the extent that they are 
behind their grade for their age, over age becomes one of 
the primary standards of judging the efficiency of a 
school system. When judged in view of the purpose of 
the elementary school, viz., to give each normal child a com- 
plete elementary education, that system of schools is the 
most efficient—all things considered—which has the small- 
est per cent. of over-age pupils, because a large proportion 
of its pupils will continue until they complete the entire 
elementary school course of study; whereas that system is 
1See pages 92 and 188. 
   
-P-A-G-E-213
ee re a er nner at ane en teeee 
202 Problems in Elementary School Administration 
the least efficient which has the highest per cent. of over- 
age pupils, because a small proportion of its pupils will 
continue until they complete the entire course. 
The number of over-age pupils in a school system and 
the length of time these pupils are over age are therefore 
questions of the highest practical importance. The number 
of pupils over age is an index to the probable number of 
children who will drop permanently from school before 
completing the course of study, and the length of time these 
pupils are over age is an index to the extent these over-age 
children will probably fail to complete the course. Hence, 
definite knowledge by grades of the number of over-age 
children in a system and definite knowledge of the length 
of time these pupils are over age, supply the basis of judg- 
ing to what extent the system is succeeding or not succeed- 
ing in giving to each normal child a complete elementary 
education, and also of judging of the efficiency or ineffi- 
ciency of the organization and administration of the par- 
ticular system of schools.   FINANCIAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE OVER-AGE PROBLEM 
The question of over age has, however, not only great 
social and educational significance, but also financial sig- 
nificance. With the recognition of the tendency among 
over-age pupils to drop from school, without having com- 
pleted the entire elementary school course of study, provi- 
sions have been made by school authorities to give over- 
age pupils special attention, to the end that they may be 
able to advance farther in the course of study than it 
would be possible for them to advance were they left in 
regular classes. There were in the elementary schools of 
the City of New York, for example, May 31st, 1912, 888 
1 Over age is much more serious in the upper grades than in the 
lower grades, because, by the proper classification and instruction of 
pupils a considerable portion of the pupils in the lower grades will 
be able to reduce the length of time they are over age by the time 
they reach the upper grades. 
 
-P-A-G-E-214
Significance of Over Age 203 
such classes, with an average register of thirty-two pupils 
per class and a total register of 28,083 pupils. In regular 
classes, one classroom accommodates and one teacher in- 
structs forty-five pupils; special classes for over-age pupils 
are, however, organized, as a rule, on the basis of thirty 
pupils per classroom and teacher. Hence, to organize spe- 
cial classes for over-age pupils is to increase the cost of 
educating such pupils beyond what it would cost to instruct 
them in regular classes. The presence of a large number 
of over-age pupils in a system of schools and the conse- 
quent necessity of providing special classes for the instruc- 
tion of such children, if they are to advance much, if any, 
beyond the fifth grade before dropping from school perma- 
nently, add, therefore, materially to the cost of the elemen- 
tary school; whereas in a system having a small number of 
over-age pupils there is need of but few, if any, special 
classes for such pupils, and hence the ordinary cost of the 
elementary school is increased but little, if at all. 
Further, over-age pupils, by failing to advance during 
their entire school life beyond the lower grades, instead of 
advancing regularly through the school, congest these 
grades. In consequence, the classrooms in the lower grades 
are crowded, whereas those in the upper grades have empty 
seats. In a system of schools having a large number of 
over-age pupils, more classrooms are therefore required 
to accommodate a given school population than are re- 
quired to care for the same number of pupils in a system 
of schools having few over-age pupils. Hence, the finan- 
cial significance of over age. 
THE DETERMINATION OF THE NUMBER OF OVER-AGE PUPILS 
It is not an easy matter to determine accurately the num- 
ber of over-age pupils in a system of schools. To deter- 
mine accurately the number of over-age pupils and the 
length of time these pupils are over age, or to make an 
age-grade report, it is necessary to have clearly in mind:

(1) the age-grade standards to be used; (2) the time to 
make the report—whether for the beginning or for the end 
of the official school year; (3) when to take the ages 
of the children—whether at the end or at the beginning of 
the official school year, or at the close or the opening of the 
schools for instruction; (4) how to take the ages of the 
children; and, finally, (5) what children to include. We 
shall consider each of these points in turn.

AGE-GRADE STANDARDS TO USE IN AGE-GRADE 
REPORTS 
I. AGE-GRADE STANDARDS FOR BEING IN A GRADE 
RITERS on over age and superintendents in making 
age-grade reports have been none too careful in de- 
termining the proper age-grade standards to be used in 
judging whether or not a pupil is under age, normal age, or 
over age. The age-grade standards given in the following 
quotations are typical of those in use: 
“Normal age in this study is defined as follows: Chil- 
dren who are 6 or 7 years of age in the first grade, 7 or 8 
years of age in the second grade, 8 or g years of age in the 
third grade, and so on, are normal.” +

  206 Problems in Elementary School Administration 
It will be observed that the age-grade standards of the 
foregoing quotations are in each case the normal ages for 
“being in the grade” and that in not one of these quotations 
is there an intimation that to determine accurately whether 
or not a pupil is under age, normal age, or over age, there 
is need of ‘age-grade standards fixing the normal age limits 
for entering and for completing each of the several grades 
of the elementary school. What is true of the age-grade 
standards in these quotations is, with but one or two ex- 
ceptions, true of those given in all articles written up to the 
present time on over age and in all school reports on over 
age, viz., the age-grade standards are for “being in the 
grade.” 
The Right Basis for Age-Grade Reports 
“Being in the grade” has to do only indirectly with 
whether or not a child is under age, normal age, or over 
age. To make the age-grade standards for “being in a 
grade” the basis of determining whether or not a pupil is 
under age, normal age, or over age is to use a wrong basis, 
and in consequence to make unreliable and inaccurate age- 
grade reports. 
A child is under age, or normal age, or over age in view 
of the task in hand, viz., completing the entire elementary 
school course of study by a given age. When the whole 
task is subdivided, as it is, into several units or grades, a 
child is under age, or normal age, or over age as he pro- 
gresses through the school, according as he is younger or 
older on finishing a given grade than the normal age limits 
fixed for completing the respective grade. To be sure, 
when the normal age-grade standards for completing each 
of the several grades are determined, these standards may 
in turn be employed as the basis of fixing the normal age 
limits for entering each of the several grades. With these 
age-grade standards in hand, it is possible to determine un- 
der age, normal age, and over age from the point of view of 
 
-P-A-G-E-218
  Standards in Making Age-Grade Reports 207 
entering a grade with the same accuracy as from the point 
of view of completing a grade. Hence, to determine accu- 
rately whether or not a child is under age, or normal age, 
or over age, involves fixing on the normal age limits for 
entering and on the normal age limits for completing each 
of the several grades—which has not as yet been done. 
The following illustrations will suffice to show that age- 
grade standards for “being in the grade” supply an inexact 
basis for age-grade reports. 
The Case of “A” 
The normal ages for being in the seventh grade, accord- 
ing to Dr. Ayres, are 12 up to 14. (See quotation, page 
205.) Were a boy “A,” 13 years and 11 months old June 
3oth, in the 7th grade at the close of the year, when an 
age-grade report was made, such a boy judged by the age- 
grade standards for “being in the grade” would ordinarily 
be recorded and reported as of normal age. As a matter 
of fact, whether or not “A” is actually of normal age de- 
pends (a) on whether the age-grade report is made before 
or after promotion and (b) on whether “A” is to be pro- 
moted or is not to be promoted. 
When the Age-Grade Report Is Made before Promotion 
When the age-grade report is made at the end of the 
year before promotion, pupils are “in” the respective grades 
where they have been registered during the whole or a part 
of the year ending. Hence, were “A” 13 years and 11 
months old in the seventh grade to be promoted, it would 
be correct to record and report him as of normal age. But 
were “A” not to be promoted, it is obvious that it will prob- 
ably be necessary for him to remain an entire year in the 
seventh grade in order to complete it; that is, until he is 
14 years and 11 months old. Instead, therefore, of “A” 
being of normal age, he is, in fact, one year over age.
-P-A-G-E-219
  208 ‘Problems in Elementary School Administration 
Hence, to report “A” of normal age is to give him the 
advantage of the time it will probably take him to complete 
the grade, an entire year. 
What is true of “A” when age-grade reports are made 
before promotion on the basis of the age-grade standards 
for “being in the grade” is true, within limits, of all chil- 
dren whose ages are near the upper age limit for “being in 
the grade.” That is, to determine under age, normal age, 
and over age before promotion on the basis of the age- 
grade standards for “being in the grade” is practically to 
subtract one year from the ages of all non-promoted chil- 
dren or is to give such pupils an age advantage of the time 
it takes to complete a grade, an entire year.1_ In conse- 
quence, pupils are reported as of normal age who are ac- 
tually over age, and this results in an increase in the re- 
ported number of pupils of normal age and decrease in the 
reported number of over-age pupils. (See tables on pages 
213 and 214.) 
When the Age-Grade Report Is Made after Promotion 
When the age-grade report is made at the end of the 
year after promotion, non-promoted pupils are “in” the re- 
spective grades where they have been registered during a 
whole or a part of the year ending, whereas promoted pu- 
pils are “in” the respective grades to which they have just 
been advanced. Hence, were “A,” 13 years and 11 months 
1In a system where promotions are made semi-annually, and an 
age-grade report is made, at the end of each term, before promotion, 
on the basis of the age-grade standards for “being in the grade” for 
each of the sixteen grades, non-promoted pupils are given the advan- 
tage of only a half year, the time to complete a grade. But in a sys- 
tem having semi-annual promotions, where an age-grade report is 
made before promotion on the basis of the age-grade standards for 
“being in the grade” and for the grades of each of the several years, 
at the end of the year only, in such a case non-promoted pupils in 
the classes of all A grades are given the advantage of an entire year, 
while non-promoted pupils in the classes of all B grades and the 
promoted pupils in the classes of all A grades are given the advan- 
tage of a half year. (See tables on pages 213 and 220.)
-P-A-G-E-220
     Standards in Making Age-Grade Reports 209 
old, not promoted, and in the seventh grade, it is obvious 
that although he has been “in” the seventh grade for a whole 
or part of the year ending, for all practical purposes he is 
just entering the seventh grade. To complete this grade, 
it will probably be necessary for him to remain “in the 
grade” an entire year, that is, until he is 14 years and 11 
months old. Instead, therefore, of “A” being of normal 
age as he would be recorded and reported when the age- 
grade report is made on the basis of the age-grade stand- 
ards for “being in the grade,” he is actually one year over 
age, and to report him as of normal age is to give him the 
advantage of an entire year, the time it will probably take 
him to complete the grade. 
Finally, were “A,” 13 years and 11 months old, and pro- 
moted from the sixth grade to the seventh grade, to com- 
plete the seventh grade it will probably be necessary for 
him to remain “in” the grade an entire year ; that is, until he 
is 14 years and 11 months old. Instead, therefore, of “A” 
being of normal age as he would be reported when the age- 
grade report is made after promotion and on the basis of 
the age-grade standards for “being in the grade,” he is in 
reality one year over age, and to report him as of normal 
age is equivalent to subtracting one entire year from his 
age. 
eWhat is true of “A” when age-grade reports are made 
after promotion on the basis of age-grade standards for 
“being in the grade” is true within limits of all children 
whose ages are near the upper age limit for “being in the 
grade”; that is, to determine under age, normal age, and 
over age after promotion on the basis of the age-grade 
standards fixed for “being in the grade” is to give to non- 
promoted and also to promoted children, hence to all chil- 
dren, an age advantage of the time it takes to complete a 
grade, an entire year, and is equivalent to subtracting an 
entire year from the ages of all children.1 In consequence 
1In a system where promotions are made semi-annually and an age- 
grade report is made at the end of each term, after promotion, on
-P-A-G-E-221
  210 Problems in Elementary School Administration 
pupils are reported as of normal age, who are actually over 
age, and this results in an increase in the reported number 
of pupils of normal age and a decrease in the reported num- 
ber of over-age pupils.* 
The Case of “B” 
The age-grade standards for being in the seventh grade 
are, according to Dr. Ayres,” 12 to 14, and for being in the 
eighth grade, 13 to 15. Were a boy “B,” 12 years and 1 
month old, in the seventh grade at the end of a year, 
whether such a boy was reported as of normal age or as 
under age, would depend on whether or not the age-grade 
report was made before or after promotion, that is before 
or after the grades and classes were reorganized for the 
new year, and on whether or not he was promoted or not 
promoted. Were “B,” 12 years and 1 month old, in the 
seventh grade at the end of the year, and the age-grade 
report made before promotion, “B” would be recorded as 
of normal age, whereas were “B” promoted, and the age- 
grade report made after promotion, and were “B” reported 
from the eighth grade, the grade to which he has just been 
advanced, he would be recorded as being under age. What 
is true of “B” is true, within limits, of all children whose 
ages are near the lower age limit for “being in a grade.” 
That is, when the age-grade report is made before promo- 
tion pupils are recorded of normal age, who, when the age- 
the basis of the age-grade standards for “being in the grade,” for each 
of the sixteen grades, all pupils are given the advantage of a half year. 
But in a system having semi-annual promotions, where an age-grade 
report is made after promotion on the basis of the age-grade standards 
for “being in the grade” for the grades of the several years, at the 
end of the year only, in such a case promoted pupils in the classes 
of all A grades and non-promoted pupils in the classes of all B grades 
are given the advantage of a half year, while non-promoted pupils in 
the classes of all A grades and promoted pupils in the classes of all 
B grades are given the advantage of an entire year. (See tables on 
pages 213 and 214.)

grade report is made after promotion, are recorded as 
under age. In consequence, to make age-grade reports on 
the basis of the age-grade standards for being in the grade, 
before promotion, is to increase the recorded number of 
pupils of normal age and to decrease the recorded number 
of pupils under age, and to make such reports after promo- 
tion is to increase the recorded number of pupils under 
age and to decrease the recorded number of pupils of nor- 
mal age. (See tables on pages 213 and 214.) 
To summarize: to make an age-grade report, either be- 
fore promotion or after promotion, on the basis of the age- 
grade standards for being in the grade, is to increase the 
reported number of pupils of normal age and to decrease 
the reported number of pupils over age. Obviously age- 
grade standards which permit such arbitrary changes in 
the recorded number of pupils under age, normal age, and 
over age, are inexact age-grade standards, and it is equally 
obvious that age-grade reports made on the basis of such 
age-grade standards are inexact. 
Reports Based on Age-Grade Standards Used in New York 
City in 1904 and 1905 
The age-grade standards proposed in 1904 by the City 
Superintendent of Schools of the City of New York, and 
used by him now as the basis of his age-grade reports, are 
given below:

  212 Problems in Elementary School Administration 
The age-grade standards proposed and used by the City 
Superintendent of Schools as the basis of his age-grade 
reports are, it will be observed, for “being in the grade.” 
Hence, in view of the foregoing, the age-grade standards 
employed by the City Superintendent of Schools supply an 
inexact basis of determining whether or not a pupil is under 
age, or normal age, or over age, and age-grade reports made 
on the basis of such age-grade standards are not as exact 
as such reports should be. 
In 1904, the year in which the City Superintendent of 
Schools proposed the foregoing age-grade standards for 
“being in the grade,” he made his age-grade report before 
promotion, that is, before the classes and grades were re- 
organized for the new year. There were included in this 
age-grade report only the children on register June 30th, 
when the schools closed for instruction His age-grade 
report for 1905 was made in the same way as the report 
for 1904, with one exception, the age-grade report for 1905 
was made after promotion, that is, after the classes and 
grades were organized for the new year.?_ The effect of 
this change from making his age-grade report before pro- 
motion to making it after promotion, on the reported num- 
ber and per cent. of under-age, normal-age, and over-age 
pupils, is shown in Table LVI. (See pages 213-214.) 
Age-grade Table LVI-1 conforms in every respect to the 
age-grade report of the City Superintendent of Schools for 
1 Annual Report of the City Superintendent of Schools for 1904, 
pages 42 ff. 
pecouel Report of the City Superintendent of Schools for 1905, 
pages 58 ff. 
8In order to make clear the several points of this report, age-grade 
data were collected for all the pupils on the register during the course 
of the February-June term, 1910-11, in five elementary schools of the 
City of New York. These five schools, having a total or net enroll- 
ment of 8,249 pupils, were selected at random from the schools having 
all grades, one school from each of the several boroughs. The data 
used in all the illustrative tables of this report are for the same chil- 
dren. Consequently any differences that appear are due to differences 
in method of determining under age, normal age, and over age, or in 
making age-grade reports.

per cent. of normal age, and 32.24 per cent. over age.

  schools 11.31 per cent. of the pupils were under age, 65.47 
per cent. of normal age, and 23.22 per cent. over age. To 
make an age-grade report before promotion, on the basis 
of age-grade standards for being in the grade, is, therefore, 
in contrast to making it after promotion, to decrease the 
recorded number of pupils under age and to increase the 
recorded number of pupils over age; whereas, to make such 
a report after promotion is, in contrast to making it before 
promotion, to decrease the recorded number of pupils over 
age and to increase the recorded number of pupils under 
age and normal age. 
1It will be observed that in the five schools in question the register, 
as of June 30th in Table LVI-1, is given as 7,500, whereas, as in Table 
LVI-2, the register as of June 3oth is given as 7,128. This difference 
in register is due to the fact that when an age-grade report is made 
after promotion 8B promoted pupils are necessarily excluded. 
2 How typical these five schools are of the system as a whole is 
indicated by the fact that the reported per cent. of over-age pupils in 
the grades of the several years was 23.3 per cent. Annual Report of 
the City Superintendent of Schools for 1911, page 59.

          Standards in Making Age-Grade Reports 215 
In a word, by a change in statistical method, that is, by 
making his age-grade report in 1905 after promotion, in- 
stead of, as in 1904, before promotion, the City Superin- 
tendent was able to report for the elementary schools of the 
city, when judged on the basis of Table LVI-2, 8.86 per 
cent. more pupils under age and 9.02 per cent. fewer pupils 
over age, than he would have been able to report had he 
made his report for 1905, as in 1904, before promotion. 
This being true, there is little wonder that the City Su- 
perintendent of Schools was able to report in 1905 as fol- 
lows: 
“The next table shows the number in each year grade 
above normal age, on June 30th, 1905, and the percentage 
of this number on the whole number of children in the

    216 Problems in Elementary School Administration 
The City Superintendent of Schools points to the im- 
proved conditions with respect to the number of pupils over 
age in 1905 over 1904, his table showing that the per cent. 
of over-age pupils in the grades was reduced from 39 per 
cent. in 1904 to 32 per cent. in 1905, a reduction of 7 per 
cent. The City Superintendent of Schools was undoubtedly 
unaware of the effect of making his age-grade report in, 
1905 after promotion instead of, as in 1904, before promo- 
tion, on the reported per cent. of pupils under age, normal 
age, and over age. At all events, he failed to call attention 
to the change in the time of making his age-grade report 
and to point out that this change alone reduced the reported 
per cent. of over-age pupils approximately 9.2 per cent. Ina 
word, had his age-grade report for 1905 been made as in 
1904, the reported per cent. of over-age pupils would have 
been approximately 41.2 per cent. instead of 32 per cent., or 
approximately 2 per cent. higher than in 1904 instead of, as 
reported, 7 per cent. lower. Consequently, the reported re- 
duction in the per cent. of over age in 1905 over 1904 was 
not an actual reduction due to improved conditions in the 
schools, but probably a reduction due solely to a change in 
statistical method, viz., making his age-grade report be- 
fore instead of after promotion. 
Reports Based on Age-Grade Standards Used in New York 
City since 1905 
There are, in the elementary schools of the City of New 
York, sixteen grades. The City Superintendent of Schools, 
however, does not make a separate age-grade report for 
each of these sixteen grades, the 1A grade, 1B grade, etc., 
but he makes his age-grade report for the grades—the A 
and B grades, of each of the several years, first year grades, 
etc. The effect on the reported number of pupils under 
age, normal age, and over age of the City Superintendent of 
Schools, making his age-grade report for the grades of

  Standards in Making Age-Grade Reports 221 
Age-grade Table LVIII-1 conforms in every respect to 
the age-grade reports as made by the City Superintendent of 
Schools since 1905. Age-grade Table LVIII-2 conforms in 
every respect to the age-grade reports as made by the City 
Superintendent of Schools since 1905, with two exceptions, 
whether or not pupils are under age, normal age, or over 
age is determined before promotion; and the age-grade 
table is for each of the several grades. Consequently, 
Table LVIII shows what the effect was, on the reported 
number of under-age, normal-age, and over-age pupils, of 
the City Superintendent making his age-grade reports after 
promotion and for the grades of the several years. 
Table LVIII-1, in which the number of pupils under age, 
normal age, and over age is reported after promotion and 
for the grades of the several years, shows that 11.31 per 
cent. were under age, 65.47 per cent. normal age, and 23.22 
per cent. over age. Table LVIII-2, in which the number of 
pupils under age, normal age, and over age is reported 
before promotion and for each of the several grades, shows, 
for the same pupils (with the one exception noted) and for 
the same schools, that 3.75 per cent. were under age, 56.73 
per cent. of normal age, and 39.52 per cent. were over age. 
In a word, the City Superintendent of Schools is able to 
report when judged on the basis of Table LVIII, 7.56 per 
cent. more pupils under age, 8.74 per cent. more pupils nor- 
mal age, and 16.30 per cent. fewer pupils over age, than if 
he made his age-grade reports before promotion and for 
each of the sixteen grades separately. 
The age-grade reports of the City Superintendent of 
Schools are, therefore, not only inexact, by reason of the 
inexact basis thereof—age-grade standards for being in the 
grade—but they are rendered still more inexact by being for 
the grades of the several years instead of, as they should be, 
for each of the several grades.

year.

2. AGE-GRADE STANDARDS FOR ENTERING AND FOR COMPLET- 
ING EACH OF THE SEVERAL GRADES 
What the normal-age limits for entering and for com- 
pleting each of the several grades of the elementary schools 
are, when determined, depends on the age accepted for com- 
pleting the entire elementary school course of study. 
Fourteen as the Upper Age Limit 
One group of writers and school officials rest their case 
on the following facts: (1) that the legal age of entering 
the elementary school is six; (2) that children entering at 
six years of age have the best chance of advancing regularly 
and completing their elementary education prior to their 
fourteenth birthday +; (3) that the state only directly guar- 
antees the child to the school up to his fourteenth birth- 
day”; (4) that children in large numbers, either from 
necessity or from choice, drop permanently from school on 
becoming fourteen years old; (5) that, under present meth- 
ods of school administration and organization, children 
dropping from school have not advanced much beyond the 
grade of the sixth or the seventh year; and (6) that chil- 
dren cannot, with the greatest profit, be held under the ré- 
gime of the elementary school much, if any, beyond their 
fourteenth birthday. Resting their case on these facts and 
also on the belief that a democratic school must serve 
equally all the children and all the people of the community, 
this group of writers and school officials fixes the upper 
normal-age limit for completing the elementary school just 
prior to the attainment of the fourteenth birthday.* 
The elementary school course of study of the City of 
New York is divided into sixteen units or grades, each in

By reason of the date of birth and the date of the open-

children to enter school on their sixth birthday. But it is 
possible, so far as the date of birth and the date of the

to enter school between their sixth birthday and the time 
just prior to becoming six and a half years old. Accord- 
ingly, even when just prior to fourteen is accepted as the 
upper normal-age limit to complete the elementary school, 
for the foregoing practical reasons, a range of a half year

form most closely to the actual working conditions and to 
the real purpose of the elementary school, viz., to give each 
normal child of the community a complete elementary edu- 
cation. Hence, these are the age-grade standards accord- 
ing to which under age, normal age, and over age can be 
most accurately determined, and, therefore, the age-grade 
standards which should be used in determining the number

of pupils in a school system under age, normal age, and 
over age. 
Fifteen as the Upper Age Limit 
A second group of writers and school officials rest their 
case on the following facts: (1) that, notwithstanding 
the legal age of entrance, six, children in large numbers 
do not enter school until they are seven years of age and 
older 1; (2) that the child is not directly guaranteed by the 
state to the school until he is seven years old; and (3) that 
to give the child a full eight years’ elementary school course 
of instruction the school must have eight years in which to 
do its work, hence the upper normal-age limit for complet- 
ing the course must be eight years higher than the lower 
age limit of the Compulsory Education Law; resting their 
case on these facts, this second group of writers and school 
officials fixes the upper normal-age limit for completing 
the elementary school just prior to the attainment of the 
fifteenth birthday. If up to fifteen years of age is accepted 
as the upper normal-age limit for completing the elementary 
school, the normal-age limits for entering and the normal- 
age limits for completing each of the several grades are 
respectively as shown in Table LXI. 
If comparison is made between the normal-age limits for 
entering and for completing each of the several grades of 
the elementary school as these are given in Tables LX and 
LXI, two differences will be observed: (1) the normal age 
for entering and the normal age for completing each of the 
several grades are a half year higher in Table LXI than in 
Table LX; and (2) the age-grade standards for entering 
and for completing each of the several grades in Table LXI 
permit a range in ages of an entire year, whereas the age- 
grade standards in Table LX permit a range in ages of only   
1 Twenty-two per cent. of the pupils entering the 1A grade of the 
elementary schools of the City of New York in I910-11 were seven 
years of age and older. See Annual Report of the City Superin- 
tendent of Schools for 1910-11, page 61.

a half year. This difference of a half year in the upper 
normal-age limit for entering and a half year in the upper 
normal-age limit for completing each of the grades, to- 
gether with the difference of a half year in the range of the 
normal-age limits for entering and for completing each of 
the grades, materially affect the reported number of pupils 
normal age and over age.! In consequence, to determine 
whether or not pupils are under age, normal age, or over 
age, in view of the age-grade standards given in Table LXI, 
is to report for a school system a maximum number of pu- 
pils of normal age and a minimum number of pupils over 
age.

  Standards in Making Age-Grade Reports 227 
To accept up to fifteen years of age as the upper normal- 
age limit to complete the elementary school and to use the 
age-grade standards based thereon, as given in Table LXI, 
in making age-grade reports, is not only unwise, because of 
the facts cited (see page 222) in support of making up to 
fourteen and a half the upper normal-age limit for finishing 
the elementary school course of study, but unwise because 
of the following additional reasons: 
(1) Because to make up-to-fifteen the normal age for 
completing the elementary school course and to report this 
as the normal age fails to impress parents with the fact 
that unless their children enter school at the legal age of 
entrance (six), and continue regular in attendance, they 
will probably drop from school without being able to com- 
plete the course. 
(2) Because to make up-to-fifteen the normal age for 
completing the elementary school fails to impress on school 
officials the necessity of so adapting the standards of the 
school and the course of study to the abilities and needs of 
different groups of children, that children entering at six 
but only able to continue until they are fourteen or shortly 
thereafter may complete an entire elementary school course 
of instruction. 
Effect on Statistics for New York City of the Age-Grade 
Standards Used 
Reference to the age-grade standards for “being in the 
grade,” proposed and employed by the City Superintendent 
of Schools (see page 211), will reveal the fact that he is in 
the second group of writers and school officials; that is, 
among those who hold that the upper normal-age limit for 
completing the elementary school is just prior to the attain- 
ment of the fifteenth birthday. Had the City Superintend- 
ent of Schools made up-to-fifteen, together with the legal 
age of entrance (six), the basis of determining the normal- 
age limits for entering and for completing each of the sev- 
   
-P-A-G-E-239
  228 Problems in Elementary School Administration 
eral grades, 1A, 1B, 2A, etc. (see Table LXI), and had he 
determined under age, normal age, and over age from the 
point of view of the normal-age limits for entering and for 
completing each of the several grades, even then he would 
employ the age-grade standards which yield a larger re- 
ported number of pupils of normal age and a smaller re- 
ported number of over-age pupils than when the age-grade 
standards (see Table LX) are employed, based on finishing 
the elementary school just prior to becoming fourteen and 
a half. (See Table LXII.) 
The City Superintendent of Schools, however, did not 
use up to fifteen years of age, together with the legal age 
of entrance (six), to determine the normal-age limits for 
entering and for completing each of the several grades, the 
1A grade, the 1B grade, the 2A grade, etc., but, as we have 
seen, he used these ages to determine the normal ages for 
“being in the grades’ of the several years, first-year grades, 
second-year grades, etc.; he does not make his age-grade 
reports from the point of view of entering or of completing 
each of the several grades, the 1A grade, the 1B grade, etc., 
but, as we have seen, from the point of view of “being in 
the grades” of each of the several years; and finally, since 
1905, his age-grade reports are not only for “being in the 
grades” of each of the several years, but, as we have seen, 
are made after promotion. All of which contribute to one 
end, viz., a very high reported number of pupils of normal 
age and a very low reported number of pupils over age in 
the elementary schools. (See Tables LXII-1, LXII-2, and 
LXIII.)

normal age, or over age is determined after promotion. In 
consequence, age-grade Table LXII-1 shows for the five

and these same schools as would be re-

shows for these same pupils and the same schools the per 
cent. of pupils under age, normal age, and over age, as 
should be reported, when up-to-fourteen-and-a-half is ac- 
cepted as the upper normal-age limit for completing the 
elementary school. Age-grade Table LXIII shows for the 
same pupils and for the same schools the per cent. under 
age, normal age, and over age as would be reported by the

City Superintendent of Schools. (Up-to-fifteen is accepted 
by the City Superintendent of Schools as the upper normal- 
age limit for completing the elementary school.) 
The City Superintendent of Schools, by using the age- 
grade standards for “being in the grades” of the several 
years, and by making his age-grade reports as he does, re- 
cords, therefore, in view of Table LXII-1, 6.55 per cent. 
fewer pupils under age, 25.42 per cent. more pupils of 
normal age, and 18.87 per cent. fewer pupils over age than 
there probably are in the elementary schools of the City 
of New York, and in view of Table LXII-2, he reports 6.55 
per cent. too few pupils under age, 43.66 per cent. too 
many pupils of normal age, and 37.11 per cent. too few 
pupils over age. These differences, varying according to 
whether up-to-fifteen or up-to-fourteen-and-a-half is ac- 
cepted as the upper normal-age limit for completing the 
elementary school, are to be found in all the age-grade re- 
ports made by the City Superintendent of Schools for 1905 
to 1911 inclusive. 
 
-P-A-G-E-245
  CHAPTER XVI   
WHEN AND HOW TO MAKE AGE-GRADE 
REPORTS 
ae or not a pupil is under age, normal age, 
or over age can be accurately determined, as we have 
seen, only from the point of view either of the normal- 
age limits for entering or of the normal-age limits for com- 
pleting each of the several grades. Accordingly, age-grade 
reports to be reliable and accurate must be made either at 
the end or at the beginning of a school term or school year. 
AGE-GRADE REPORTS MADE AT THE END OF A SCHOOL TERM 
OR YEAR 
The laws of most of the states, including the State of 
New York, require superintendents of schools to make an 
annual report for the official school year to the State De- 
partment of Education. With the recognition of their sig- 
nificance, over-age tables showing the ages and grades of 
pupils—the basis of age-grade reports—have been included 
in the annual report required of superintendents of schools 
by the educational departments of several states. Owing, 
at least partly, to the state requirement of an annual report 
for the official school year on the ages and grades of pupils, 
superintendents of schools make age-grade reports, as a 
tule, at the end of the year only. 
When age-grade reports are made at the end of the year, 
to be included in the annual report for the official school 
year, such age-grade reports are based, almost always, on 
the age and grade, at the end of the year, of each and every 
234
-P-A-G-E-246
When and How to Make Age-Grade Reports 235 
pupil who has been on the register during the course of the 
official year, of any one of the several schools of the sys- 
tem.1 Such an age-grade report gives, therefore, for all 
the different pupils who have been on the register during 
the official year, the number, at the end of the year, under 
age, normal age, or over age. 
Indeed, the primary object of state authorities in requir- 
ing such age-grade reports and the primary object of su- 
perintendents of schools in making such reports is to gain 
definite information with respect to the number of pupils, 
at the end of the year, of the total or net register for the 
official year, under age, normal age, and over age, to the 
end that definite data may be at hand on which to base such 
administrative policies and action that the number of over- 
age pupils may be reduced during the succeeding official 
school year. 
Requirements of an Exact Age-Grade Report Where Pro- 
motions Are Annual 
A reliable and accurate age-grade report for the official 
school year for a system of schools having annual promo- 
tion involves: 
(1) That the age-grade report be made for each of the 
several grades. 
(2) That the age-grade report for each grade be based 
on the total or net register of the grade for the official 
school year, that is, be based on the age of each and every 
pupil on the register of the grade at the end of the year 
and on the age of each and every pupil—exclusive of pupils 
transferred or promoted—who has been on the register of 
the grade during the course of the year, but who has dropped 
from school either temporarily or permanently, and conse- 
quently is not on the register of the grade at the end of the 
year.

    236 Problems in Elementary School Administration 
(3) That the age-grade report be made after promo- 
tion and non-promotion, but before the grades and classes 
are reorganized for the new year; that is, both promoted 
and non-promoted pupils should be reported as of the regis- 
ter of the grade in which they have been during the whole 
or part of the official year, and in which they are regis- 
tered at the end of the year before the reorganization of 
the grades and the classes for the new year. 
(4) That whether promoted pupils are under age, nor- 
mal age, or over age be determined in view of the normal- 
age limit for completing the grade in which they have been 
registered a part or the whole of the year ending and hence 
in view of the normal-age limits for completing the grade 
from which they are to be advanced. 
(5) That whether non-promoted pupils are under age, 
normal age, or over age be determined from the point of 
view of the normal-age limits for completing the grade they 
last finished. Since non-promoted pupils are for all practi- 
cal purposes just entering the grade from which they have 
failed to be advanced, whether non-promoted pupils are 
under age, normal age, or over age may be determined prac- 
tically as well from the point of view of the normal-age 
limits for entering the grade in which they have been regis- 
tered during the whole or a part of the year ending, and 
from which they have failed to be promoted.t 
(6) That all pupils—exclusive of those transferred or 
promoted—who have been on the register of a given grade 
sometime during the official year, but who have dropped 
from school either temporarily or permanently, hence are 
not on the register of the grade at the end of the year, be

point of view of the age-grade standards for entering the grade in 
which they have been registered during the whole or a part of the 
year, but from which they have just failed to be advanced, is only 
.028 of one per cent. 
 
-P-A-G-E-248
  When and How to Make Age-Grade Reports 237 
regarded as non-promoted pupils. Whether such pupils are 
under age, normal age, or over age is then determined in 
the same way as in the case of other non-promoted pupils. 
The age-grade report for promoted pupils, for non-pro- 
moted pupils, and for pupils who have dropped from school 
either temporarily or permanently should be made sepa- 
rately in order to distinguish between the per cent. of under- 
age, normal-age, and over-age pupils, among promoted and 
non-promoted pupils and among pupils who have dropped 
out. These separate reports should then be combined to 
show the per cent. of under age, normal age, and over age 
for the grades as a whole. 
Age-Grade Reports Where Promotions Are Semi-Annual 
The foregoing considerations have to do, as stated, with 
the making, at the end of the year, of an age-grade report 
for the official school year, in a system of schools having 
annual promotions. In a system of schools having semi- 
annual promotions, such as in the City of New York, it is 
better not to attempt to make an age-grade report for the 
official year as a whole, but to make a separate age-grade 
report for each of the official terms. If this is done, the 
age-grade report for the official term is made in the same 
way as such a report for the official year. 
If, however, in a system of schools having semi-annual 
promotions it is deemed desirable to make an age-grade 
report for the official year as a whole, the age-grade report 
for each of the grades should be made on the basis of the 
ages of all pupils on the register of the grade, at the end 
of the year; and on the basis of the ages of all pupils, ex- 
clusive of those transferred or promoted, who have been 
on the register of the grade during the course of the official 
year, but who have dropped from school either temporarily 
or permanently, the report itself is made in the same way 
as in a system of schools having annual promotions.

AGE-GRADE REPORTS MADE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 
SCHOOL TERM OR YEAR 
In contrast to age-grade reports made at the end of a 
term or year for the official year, the primary purpose of 
an age-grade report made at the beginning of a term or year 
is to give definite knowledge of the number of pupils ac- 
tually in each classroom and in each school of the system 
under age, normal age, and over age, to the end that this 
information may be used by school officials, principals, and 
teachers in properly classifying pupils and in properly 
adapting the materials and methods of instruction to the 
varying abilities and needs of different groups of children. 
In a word, age-grade reports made at the end of a term 
or year shed light on age-grade conditions in the system as 
a whole and supply the basis of general administrative poli- 
cies, such as making provision for special classes and pro- 
viding different courses of instruction for over-age pupils; 
whereas age-grade reports made at the beginning of the 
term or year place at the disposal of school officials, princi- 
pals, and teachers information which enables them so to 
apply their general administrative policies that the best in- 
terests of each child are conserved. 
An age-grade report for the beginning of a term or school 
year, to be most helpful to principals and teachers in classi- 
fying and carrying on the instruction of pupils, should be 
made on the first day that schools open for instruction, or 
as soon as possible thereafter. Such a report should include 
all pupils who were in the particular class and grade who 
failed of promotion and all pupils who were promoted to 
the particular class and grade when the schools closed for 
instruction at the end of the preceding term or year. There 
should also be included in such a report all pupils who enter 
the particular classes and grades from time to time after 
the beginning of the term.’ In a word, an age-grade report

grade report for a given class see the card prepared by Dr. Leonard 
Ayres of the Russell Sage Foundation. 
 
-P-A-G-E-250
  When and How to Make Age-Grade Reports 239 
for the beginning of a term, to be most helpful, should show 
correctly the age-grade condition in the particular class. It 
also follows from the foregoing discussions that such an 
age-grade report, to be reliable and accurate, must be made 
from the point of view of the normal-age limits for entering 
each of the several grades. 
Where it is deemed desirable to make an age-grade re- 
port at the beginning of the term for the system as a whole, 
sufficient time, after the opening of the schools for instruc- 
tion, must be permitted to elapse, at least one or two weeks, 
so that a large part if not all of the pupils who are to be in 
school are actually in attendance. Otherwise, the report 
will give but a partial view of the actual existing age-grade 
conditions. 
WHEN AGE-GRADE REPORTS ARE MADE BY THE CITY SUPER- 
INTENDENT OF SCHOOLS 
The annual reports of the City Superintendent of Schools 
are for the official year beginning August Ist and ending 
July 31st. The age-grade reports made by the City Super- 
intendent. of Schools appear in his annual reports. This 
being true, it would be expected that his age-grade reports 
would be for the official year, and give, by official terms or 
for the official year as a whole, the number of pupils of the 
total or net register under age, normal age, and over age. 
While this may have been the intention of the City Super- 
intendent of Schools, an examination of his age-grade re- 
ports reveals the fact that they are neither for the official 
term nor for the official year as a whole. Aside from the 
method employed in making them, the age-grade reports 
of the City Superintendent of Schools are based on the 
register as of June 30th, instead of being based on the total 
or net register for the official year, as should be done when 
the report is for the official year. Thus the tens of thou- 
sands! of pupils who have been on the register during the 
1See pages 185-180.
-P-A-G-E-251
  240 Problems in Elementary School Administration 
course of the official year, but who have dropped from 
school either temporarily or permanently, are entirely ig- 
nored; instead of his age-grade reports being made after 
pupils are promoted and non-promoted, but before the 
grades are reorganized for the new year, they are made 
after the grades and classes are organized for the new 
year; hence, pupils are not reported from the grade in 
which they have been during the whole or a part of the- 
year past, but from the grade they will be in at the begin- 
ning of the new year.’ In consequence, the age-grade re- 
ports of the City Superintendent of Schools do not have 
the value for administrative purposes which belongs to age- 
grade reports made at the end of the year for the official 
year as a whole. 
Notwithstanding the age-grade reports of the City Su- 
perintendent of Schools appear in his annual reports and 
for this reason the inference is that they have to do with 
the official year for which the annual report is made, his 
reports have certain of the characteristics of age-grade 
reports made at the beginning of a school term or year for 
the system as a whole. His age-grade reports, however, in- 
stead of being based on the ages and grades of the children 
on the register in the new year, as should be done when the 
report is for the beginning of the new term or year,? are 
based on the ages and grades of the children on register 
June 30th after promotion, and instead of his age-grade re- 
ports being made after the greater part, if not all, of the 
pupils who will be in school during the new term or year 
are actually in attendance, they are made at the end of the 
preceding year when the schools are closed for instruction, 
hence no account is taken of the ages and grades of the 
army of pupils who will enter the elementary schools of the 
City of New York for the first time during the new term 
or year. In consequence, the age-grade reports of the City

Superintendent of Schools are lacking the practical worth 
which belongs to age-grade reports made at the beginning 
of a school term or year, for the system as a whole, or of a 
current age-grade report made at the beginning of a term, 
for a particular class and grade. 
The age-grade reports made annually by the City Su- 
perintendent of Schools since 1904 have, therefore, neither 
the value for administrative purposes belonging to age- 
grade reports made at the end of the year for the official 
year, nor the practical worth belonging to such reports 
made at the beginning of a new term or year, for neither 
do they supply definite information on the age-grade status 
in the system as a whole, nor do they supply definite in- 
formation useful to principals and teachers in the classifi- 
cation and instruction of children.

  CHAPTER XVII 
WHEN AND HOW TO TAKE THE AGES OF 
PUPILS 
F the school term or the school year, i.e., the period 
during which the schools are open for instruction, 
began and ended on the same date as the official term or 
the official school year, there would be no question about 
when the ages of children should be taken in making 
age-grade reports. But the official school year may begin 
August Ist, whereas the schools may not be open for instruc- 
tion until September 1st; the schools may close for instruc- 
tion June 30th, whereas the end of the official school year 
may not be until July 31st. This being so, confusion has 
arisen about the proper time to take the ages of children 
to be used as the basis of age-grade reports. In conse- 
quence, there is no consensus of opinion on when the ages 
of children should be taken, and there is little uniformity 
in the time they are taken; the time often varies within the 
same system of schools and within the same age-grade re- 
port.t 
The time to take the ages of pupils depends on whether 
the age-grade report is for an official school year and made 
at the end of the year or is for the beginning of an official 
school year and made at the beginning of the year. 
WHEN THE AGE-GRADE REPORT IS MADE AT THE END OF 
THE YEAR, AND FOR THE OFFICIAL SCHOOL YEAR 
It should be obvious that when an age-grade report is to 
be made at the end of the school year for the official year

of Philadelphia for 1911, pages 104 ff.

as a whole, the ages of the children cannot be taken as 
of the date of their first enrollment in the schools in the 
given official year Because, should the ages of the pupils 
taken in this way be used as the basis of such an age-grade 
report, the ages of all children would be lower from one to 
eleven months than the actual ages at the time the report 
was made. It is equally obvious that the ages of children 
cannot be taken as of the birthday occurring within the 
official school year for which the age-grade report is made.? 
Because to take the ages of children in this way would be 
to use as the basis of the age-grade report ages lower by 
from zero to twelve months than the actual ages of the 
children. Similarly, and for a like reason, it is incorrect 
to take the ages of children as of a specific date during the 
course of the official school year, e. g., December 8th.* 
When an age-grade report is made at the end of the year 
for the official year as a whole, there are but two dates for 
taking the ages of pupils which need to be considered: (a) 
the date at the end of the year when the schools close for 
instruction; and (b) the date of the close of the official 
school year. 
The argument for taking the ages of children as of the 
date of the closing of the schools for instruction is that 
the real work of the schools is done when they close for in- 
struction, hence this is the proper date on which to take 
the ages of children in judging of their progress through 
the schools. 
The arguments for taking the ages of children as of the 
date of the close of the official school year are: 
(1) The question of taking the ages of children as of 
the date of closing of the schools for instruction only arises 
1See Report of Board of Education of the City of Chicago for 1011, 
pages 147 ff. 
2See Directions of the United States Bureau of Education for 
IQIO-II.

Annual Report of the City Superintendent of Public Schools of the 
City of Philadelphia for 1911, pages 104 ff.    
-P-A-G-E-255
  244 Problems in Elementary School Administration 
when this date does not coincide with the date of the end 
of the official year. For example, in the City of New 
York, the schools close for instruction about June 3oth, 
whereas the official school year ends July 31st. 
(2) The end of the official year remains the same from 
year to year, whereas the date of the closing of the schools 
for instruction fluctuates; hence, to take the ages of the 
children as of the date of the close of the official year gives 
uniformity to the time of taking the ages and gives a corre- 
sponding uniformity to the age-grade reports made on the 
basis thereof. 
(3) The primary purpose of an age-grade report made 
at the end of the year is to show the actual age-grade status, 
at the end of the official school year, of all the different 
pupils who have been in the schools during the course of 
the official year; hence, to take the ages of the children as 
of a date other than of the close of the official year is to 
give the age-grade status as of that date and not as of the 
end of the official year, hence is to lose sight of the object 
of such an age-grade report. 
(4) Finally, the normal length of time to complete 
each of the several grades is fixed and must necessarily be 
fixed, in school systems having semi-annual promotions on 
the basis of the calendar half year (six months), and in 
school systems having annual promotions on the basis of 
the calendar year (twelve months).1_ The normal length 
of time to complete a grade (either six calendar months or 
a calendar year), together with the accepted normal age 
for completing the elementary school and the legal age of 
entrance, serve as the basis of determining the normal-age 
limits for entering and for completing each of the several 
grades. The age-grade standards, in view of which under 
age, normal age, and over age are judged, are, therefore, 
based on calendar units of a half year or a year. 
In making age-grade reports, to take the ages of children 
1See page 223. 
 
-P-A-G-E-256
    When and How to Take Ages of Pupils 245 
as of the date of the closing of the schools for instruction 
at the end of the mid-year, or as of the date of the closing 
of the schools for instruction at the end of the year, is 
equivalent to making the actual length of time the schools 
are open for instruction during the term, or during the 
school year, the normal length of time for completing each 
of the several grades, hence is to introduce a second, and, 
as a rule, a shorter measure of the normal length of time 
for completing each of the several grades, shorter by from 
one to two months, than the calendar unit of time employed 
in fixing the normal-age limits for entering and for com- 
pleting each of the several grades. Or, it is to use one unit 
of measure—a short one—in taking the ages of children, 
and a second unit of measure—a long one—in judging of 
whether or not they are under age, normal age, or over age. 
The result of which is to report too high the number of 
pupils under age and to report too low the number of pupils 
of normal age and over age.! 
For the foregoing reasons, when an age-grade report is 
made at the end of the year for the official year, the ages 
of the children should be taken as of the date of the close 
of the official school year. 
WHEN AN AGE-GRADE REPORT IS MADE FOR THE BEGINNING 
OF THE YEAR 
Confusion about when to take the ages of the children, 
when an age-grade report is made for the beginning of 
the year, arises (a) from the fact that the date of the begin- 
ning of the official school year does not always coincide 
with the date of opening the schools for instruction, and 
(b) from the fact that an age-grade report for the begin- 
ning of the year, to be reliable and accurate, must be made 
at the beginning and during the course of the term, or 
sometime after the schools are opened for instruction. 
There are four possible dates on which the ages of the chil- 
dren may be taken in making an age-grade report for the 
1See Table LXIV, page 248.
-P-A-G-E-257
246 Problems in Elementary School Administration 
beginning of the year: (a) the date of the beginning of the 
official school year; (b) the date of the opening of the 
schools for instruction; (c) the date on which the child 
enters school; and (d) the date on which the register is 
taken for the report, when made for the system as a whole. 
An age-grade report for the beginning of the year and 
for a given class and grade should be made currently as 
children enter the given class, and when for the system as 
a whole, it should be made sometime after the opening of 
the schools for instruction. To take the ages of the chil- 
dren as of the date of their first entrance to school or as of 
the date the register is taken for the report when for the 
system as a whole is, as a rule, to record ages from zero 
to one, two, and three months older than if the ages were 
for the beginning of the official year. In an age-grade re- 
port for the beginning of a school term or year, under age, 
normal age, and over age are determined in view of the 
normal-age limits fixed for entering each of the several 
grades, and these age limits in turn date from the begin- 
ning of the official year. Hence, to take the ages of the 
children as of a date later than the date of the opening of 
the official school year is to increase the reported number 
of over-age pupils. Ages as of the date of the entrance 
of pupils to school cannot therefore be used in a report at 
the beginning of the year for a given class and grade, nor 
can the ages as of the date the register is taken be used for 
such a report when for the system as a whole. 
The remaining possible dates for taking the ages in mak- 
ing such an age-grade report at the beginning of the term or 
year are (a) the date of the beginning of the official school 
year, and (b) the date of the opening of the schools for 
instruction. The respective arguments for using each of 
these dates parallel the respective arguments given above 
for taking the ages of the children, in making an age-grade 
report at the end of the year, as of the date of the closing 
of the schools for instruction, and for taking the ages as 
of the date of the end of the official school year. Conse- 
 
-P-A-G-E-258
    When and How to Take Ages of Pupils 247 
quently, it is not necessary to repeat the arguments for tak- 
ing the ages of the children, to be used as the basis of an 
age-grade report, for the beginning of the year, as of the 
date of the opening of schools for instruction, or to repeat 
those for taking the ages as of the date a the beginning of 
the official school year. 
The primary purpose of an age-grade cen for the be- 
ginning of the school year is, as we have seen,’ to supply 
definite knowledge of the number of pupils in each class- 
room and in each school under age, normal age, and over 
age. In view of this purpose, there can be but one time 
for taking the ages of children to be used as the basis of 
such a report, viz., the date of the beginning of the official 
school year. 
WHEN AGES ARE TAKEN BY THE CITY SUPERINTENDENT OF 
SCHOOLS 
The ages of children used by the City Superintendent of 
Schools, in making his age-grade report for the elementary 
schools for 1911, were taken as of June 28th, the date of 
the closing of the schools for instruction.? 
In making an age-grade report at the end of the year, to 
use as the basis thereof, the ages of children as of the date 
of the closing of the schools for instruction is, as we have 
seen,® to use a short measure of the time to complete a 
grade—the length of time the schools are open for instruc- 
tion, approximately ten months—and to use a long measure 
of the time to complete a grade—twelve months—when 
judging whether or not pupils are under age, normal age, 
or over age. The effect is the same as when goods are 
bought on long measure and sold on short measure. Hence, 
for the City Superintendent of Schools to take the ages of 
children as of the date of the closing of the schools for 
instruction and to use these ages as the basis of his age-

grade reports is for him to report the number of pupils 
under age too high and to report the number of pupils of 
normal age and over age too low.

were under age, 65.47 per cent. were of normal age, and

the same schools and for the same pupils that 8.52 per cent. 
were under age, 66.19 per cent. were of normal age, and 
that 25.29 per cent. were over age. In a word, the City 
Superintendent of Schools, by taking the ages of pupils as 
of June 28th or June 30th, as the case may be, is able to re- 
port, in view of Table LXIV, 2.79 per cent. more pupils un- 
der age, .72 of 1 per cent. fewer pupils of normal age, and    
-P-A-G-E-261
  250 Problems in Elementary School Administration 
2.07 per cent. fewer pupils over age, than he would probably 
be able to report were the ages of the children taken as they 
should be, when age-grade reports are made at the end of 
the year, viz., as of the date of the close of the official 
school year. 
HOW TO TAKE THE AGES OF PUPILS 
But little less confusion exists with respect to how to take 
the ages of pupils than exists with respect to when to take 
their ages. 
The basis of determining the ages of children, as of a 
given date, is the date of birth: year, month, and day. In 
getting the date of birth—year, month, and day—great care 
should be exercised. Under no condition should the teacher 
ask the pupils in her classroom the dates of their births and 
record these dates in her register to be used later in deter- 
mining the ages of pupils. The date of birth—year, month, 
and day—recorded in the teacher’s register should in all 
cases be taken from the pupil’s record card. 
In getting the date of birth—year, month, and day— 
for the pupil’s record card, the parent should be made to 
go on record, and in all cases of doubt documentary evi- 
dence should be demanded, such, for example, as birth cer- 
tificates. To repeat, too much care cannot be exercised in 
getting the exact date of birth, and this should be acquired 
once for all when the pupil enters school for the first time. 
With the date of birth—year, month, and day—as the 
basis, the age of a child as of the beginning or the end of 
the official school term or school year can be readily deter- 
mined. For reasons which will appear later, the ages of 
children should always be computed in terms of years, 
months, and days, thirty days being counted as a month.t 
The normal-age limits for entering and for completing 
each of the several grades are fixed, it will be remembered,” 
1In case pupils are born in the month of February, 28 days should 
be counted as a month.

in terms of years, months, and days. For example, when 
up to fifteen is accepted as the upper normal-age limit for 
completing the elementary school, the normal-age limits for 
completing the 1A grade are from 6 years, 6 months, and 
no days through 7 years, 5 months, and 29 days inclusive; 
for the 1B, from 7 years, no months, and no days, through 
7 years, II months, and 29 days inclusive, and so on. Ac- 
cordingly, if pupils are to be grouped with accuracy on the 
basis of age, it is necessary to have their ages in years, 
months, and days. When their ages are so taken, it is possi- 
ble to group them with absolute accuracy according to the 
age limits fixed for entering or for completing each of the 
several grades.

CHAPTER XVIII 
THE CHILDREN TO INCLUDE IN AGE-GRADE 
REPORTS 
THE BASIS OF THE QUESTION 
A DECADE ago the elementary school was a simple in- 
stitution, having as a rule one organization, one 
course of study, and one general classification of pupils. 
The present-day elementary school is a complex institution 
comprising a number of different schools, each having its 
own organization, its own course of study, and caring for 
a distinct class of pupils. Within the present-day elemen- 
tary school are included: (1) regular classes, to which 
normal children are assigned; (2) rapid-advancement 
classes, in which over-age pupils may do three terms of 
work in two terms; (3) E classes—classes for over-age 
and retarded pupils; (4) C classes—classes for non-Eng- 
lish-speaking pupils; (5) D classes—classes for over-age 
and retarded pupils seeking employment certificates; (6) 
defective-speech classes—classes for children having speech 
defects; (7) classes for anzemic children; (8) classes for 
tubercular children; (9) truant, probationary, and parental 
schools; (10) classes for the blind; (11) classes for the 
deaf; (12) classes for crippled children; (13) ungraded 
classes—classes for mentally defective children; (14) 
trade-schools for boys; (15) trade-schools for girls; and, 
at times, still other classes for children having special needs 
and interests. 
In view of the diversified activities and the complex or- 
ganization of the present-day elementary school, the ques- 
252 
 
-P-A-G-E-264
    The Children to Include 253 
tion arises: What pupils should be included in an age- 
grade report having as its purpose to give, at the end or at 
the beginning of the official school term or year, the number 
of under-age, normal-age, and over-age children in the ele- 
mentary schools? 
THE CHILDREN TO INCLUDE 
In making an age-grade report, in addition to having 
fixed normal-age limits for entering and for completing each 
of the grades and having the ages of the children as of the 
date of the close or the beginning of the official school term 
or year, it is also necessary to have the children classified 
either as to completion or as to entrance to one or the 
other of the grades. Otherwise it is impossible to deter- 
mine whether or not pupils are under age, normal age, or 
over age. Only those pupils, therefore, can be included in 
an age-grade report for the elementary schools who can be 
classified as having completed or as entering one or the 
other of the grades. 
In classes for the blind, for the deaf, for crippled chil- 
dren, for mentally defective, for anemic and tubercular 
children, and in trade-schools for boys and for girls, the 
grades of the elementary school are, as a rule, ignored. It 
is, therefore, impossible to classify with any degree of ac- 
curacy children in such classes as having completed or as 
entering one or the other of the grades, and, in consequence, 
it is impossible to include the children of such classes in 
the body of an age-report.t 
In rapid-advancement classes, in E classes, C classes, D 
classes, in defective-speech classes, in truant, parental, and 
probationary schools, the instruction follows more or less 
1 But the number of such children in each kind of special class and 
the ages of such children should be reported and incorporated in an 
age-grade report as a separate item. In case such pupils can be clas- 
sified with reasonable accuracy on the basis of entrance or completion 
of one or the other of the several regular grades, they should, of 
course, be included in the body of the age-grade report under the 
heading of the respective kind of special class to which they belong.
-P-A-G-E-265
  254 Problems in Elementary School Administration 
along the lines of the regular elementary school course of 
study. In consequence, it is possible to classify the chil- 
dren in such classes with more or less accuracy according 
as they have completed or are entering one or the other of 
the grades. Hence, the children in such classes can be 
included. 
While all pupils, except those in ungraded classes for 
physically and mentally defective children, and probably 
those in trade-schools for boys and for girls,’ should be in- 
cluded in an age-grade report for the elementary schools, 
it adds both to the clarity and to the value of such a report 
if a separate report is made for each sex and for each dis- 
tinct class of pupils; for example, a separate age-grade re- 
port for pupils in regular classes, for those in rapid-ad- 
vancement classes, for those in E classes, and so on. These 
several and separate age-grade reports are then combined 
to show the total number of under-age, normal-age, and 
over-age pupils in the elementary schools, exclusive of those 
in ungraded classes+ for physically and mentally defective 
children and those in trade schools.? 
Finally, in view of the purpose of an age-grade report 
made at the end of the year for the official year, such an 
age-grade report should include not only all pupils, exclu- 
sive of those transferred or promoted, in the foregoing 
classes, on register at the close of the official year, but all 
pupils who have been on the register of these classes for a 
whole or a part of the official year, but who have dropped 
from school either temporarily or permanently ; that is, age- 
grade reports made at the end of the year for the official 
year should be based on the total or net register. (See 
pages 234-237.) Whereas, when an age-grade report is made at the begin- 
ning of the year for a given class and grade, there should 
be included all pupils in the foregoing classes, exclusive of 
1See note, page 253. 
2 For a good example of such separate age reports, see Annual Re- 
port of the Superintendent of Public Schools of the City of Philadel- 
phia for 1911, pages 104 ff.
-P-A-G-E-266
  
  The Children to Include 255 
those transferred, who were in the given class during the 
whole or a part of the previous term or year, and who 
were not promoted, and all pupils promoted to the given 
class at the end of the previous year; there should also be 
included all pupils who have entered the given class for the 
first time during the given term; when such a report is made 
for the system as a whole, it should be based on the total 
or net register for such classes up to and including the day 
on which the register is taken for the report. 
CHILDREN TO BE INCLUDED IN AGE-GRADE REPORTS FOR THE 
ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK 
In view of the foregoing discussion, there should be in- 
cluded in a complete and exact age-grade report for the 
elementary schools of the City of New York, both when 
the report is for the official year, and when the report is for 
the beginning of the term or year, at least the pupils in the 
following classes: 
(1) Inthe regular classes of each of the several grades 
(2) In rapid-advancement classes 
(3) In E classes 
(4) In C classes 
(5) In D classes 
(6) In defective-speech classes 
(7) In truant, parental, and probationary schools 
CHILDREN INCLUDED IN AGE-GRADE REPORTS MADE FOR THE 
ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK 
In making his age-grade reports for 1904 and for 1905, 
there were included by the City Superintendent of Schools 
all the different children on register June 30th, but he did 
not include in these reports all the different children, exclu- 
sive of those transferred or promoted, who were on the 
register during the course of the official school year. While 
 
-P-A-G-E-267
  256 Problems in Elementary School Administration 
there were, therefore, included in the age-grade reports for 
1904, and for 1905, children—a few hundred—who 
should have been excluded, viz., pupils in classes for men- 
tally defective children,t there were omitted from these 
reports the tens of thousands of children who dropped 
from schools temporarily or permanently during the course 
of the official year, and who were not on the register 
June 30th. 
In his Annual Report for 1905 the City Superintendent 
of Schools announces what pupils are to be excluded there- 
after from his age-grade reports, viz., “pupils in special 
classes (classes to teach English to immigrant children) 
and ungraded classes (classes for defective or atypical 
children).” As a matter of fact, the foregoing children— 
a total of 2,115—were not only excluded from his age-grade 
report for 1906, but there were also excluded some 17,544 
pupils on register in the newly formed Special D and E 
classes.2 In a word, the age-grade report of the City Su- 
perintendent of Schools for 1906 included only the pupils 
on the register at the end of the year when the schools 
closed for instruction, in the regular classes of the several 
grades,® and this is true of all his later age-grade reports.* 
In consequence, the age-grade reports of the City Superin- 
tendent of Schools, since 1905, are not age-grade reports 
for the elementary schools as a whole, but merely age-grade 
reports for the regular classes of the several grades, and, 
by reason of taking no account whatever of the tens of 
thousands of pupils who drop from the regular classes dur- 
ing the course of the official year, they are but partial re- 
ports even for the pupils in the regular classes.

Age-grade Table LXV-1 is made as an age-grade table 
should probably be made for the elementary schools of the 
City of New York, if up-to-fifteen is accepted as the upper 
normal-age limit for completing the elementary school. 
Age-grade Table LXV-2 is made as an age-grade report 
should probably be made for the elementary schools of the 
City of New York, if up-to-fourteen-and-a-half is accepted 
as the upper normal-age limit for completing the elementary 
school. Age-grade Table LXVI conforms in every respect 
to the age-grade reports as made by the City Superintendent 
of Schools since 1905. Age-grade Tables LXV and LXVI 
show, therefore, the effect of the City Superintendent of 
Schools making his age-grade reports as he does, on the 
reported number of pupils under age, normal age, and over 
age.  
-P-A-G-E-271
  260 Problems in Elementary School Administration 
The City Superintendent of Schools, by limiting his age- 
grade reports to the regular classes of the several grades, 
by including in his reports only the pupils on the register in 
these classes at the end of the term, and by making his 
age-grade reports as he does, reports, in view of Table 
LXV-1, for regular classes, 1.91 per cent. fewer pupils un- 
der age, 25.60 per cent. more pupils of normal age, and 
23.69 per cent. fewer pupils over age, than there probably 
are in the regular classes of the several grades; while, if 
his reports are taken as age-grade reports for the elemen- 
tary schools as a whole, he reports, in view of Table LXV-1, 
1.49 per cent. fewer under-age pupils, 29.96 per cent. more 
pupils of normal age, and 25.47 per cent. fewer pupils over 
age than there probably are in the elementary schools. 
Whereas, in view of Table LXV-2, he reports 1.91 per 
cent. fewer pupils under age, 44.11 per cent. more pupils of 
normal age, and 42.20 per cent. fewer pupils over age than 
there probably are in the regular classes of the several 
grades, and if his reports are taken as age-grade reports for 
the elementary schools as a whole, he reports in view of 
Table LXV-2 1.49 per cent. fewer pupils under age, 44.84 
per cent. more pupils of normal age, and 43.35 per cent. 
fewer pupils over age, than there probably are in the ele- 
mentary schools of the city. 
Only by including in his age-grade report the children 
that he does, and by making his age-grade reports as he 
does, was the City Superintendent of Schools able in 1911 
to report as follows: 
“That the decrease in the number of over-age children 
in the grades has been steady and progressive since 1904, 
when I first called the attention of the world to this over- 
age problem, is shown by the following table:

  It is possible for the City Superintendent of Schools, 
making his age-grade reports as he does, to report a reduc- 
tion of over-age pupils “in the grades” from 32 per cent.? 
in 1905 to 23.3 per cent. in 1911, a reduction of 8.78 per 
cent. But the City Superintendent of Schools failed to point 
out in connection with “Table XXXII” that the per cent. 
of over-age pupils “in the grades” was only for those pupils 
on register “in the grades” June 30 when the schools closed 
for instruction, and that no account whatever had been 
taken of the thousands of pupils who had been “in the 
grades” during the course of the official year, but who had 
dropped from school temporarily or permanently.* He 
failed to point out the fact that the number of pupils taken 
from the regular classes of the several grades and put into 
special C, D, and E classes had increased from a few hun- 
dred in 1905 to 28,838 in 1911.4 Naturally, when thou-

Pee It should be noted in this connection that the per cent. of over-age 
pupils in the regular classes of the grades was not 32 per cent. as 
given in “Table XXXII,” but that 32 per cent. is probably the per cent. 
of over-age pupils in the elementary schools as a whole, because in 
this age-grade report pupils in certain special classes were included.

sands of pupils—all presumably over age—are taken from 
the regular classes in the grades and entirely ignored in an 
age-grade report, the per cent. of over age in the grades is 
reduced. By the same mechanical methods the per cent. of 
over-age pupils in the grades could be reduced to zero. 
Until an exact and complete age-grade report is made no 
one will know what the actual age-grade conditions are in 
the elementary schools of the city; until such a report is 
made, it is impossible to judge whether the schools are effi- 
ciently or inefficiently administered, to judge whether or 
not the materials and methods of instruction are adapted to 
the varying abilities and needs of different groups of chil- 
dren, or to determine the number of pupils for whom special 
classes should be provided.

CHAPTER XIX 
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
CONCLUSIONS 
elas discussion of over age and the method of deter- 
mining it may be summarized briefly: 
(1) Over age has social, educational, and financial 
significance, because: 
Over-age children tend to fail to complete 
the work of the elementary schools, just to 
the extent that they fall behind their grade 
for their age. 
Over-age children, by tens on tens of thou- 
sands, falling behind the grade for their age, 
enter practical pursuits with only a sixth or 
seventh grade education. 
To provide special classes for the instruc- 
tion of over-age pupils, as is now done, in- 
creases the cost of instructing such pupils, and 
the presence of a large number of over-age 
pupils in a system of schools increases the 
number of classrooms, and, hence, the number 
of buildings needed to care for a given school 
population. 
(2) Age-grade standards for “being in the grade” 
are an inexact basis for age-grade reports, because: 
A child is not under age, normal age, or 
over age by reason of being of a certain age 
and by reason of “being in a certain grade.”

A child is under age, normal age, or over age 
in view of the task in hand, viz., completing 
the entire elementary school course of study 
by a given age. : 
(b) To make age-grade reports on the basis of 
age-grade standards for “being in the grade” 
is to decrease decidedly the reported number 
of over-age children. 
(3) Whether or not a child is under age, normal 
age, or over age can be determined exactly only in view 
of the normal-age limits fixed for entering and for com- 
pleting each of the several grades of the elementary 
school. 
(4) The age-grade standards for entering and for 
completing each of the several grades of the elementary 
school will differ according to whether up to fifteen 
years of age or up to fourteen and a half years of age 
is accepted as the upper normal-age limit for completing 
the elementary school. 
(5) Age-grade reports are most reliable and exact 
when made on the basis of age-grade standards for en- 
tering and for completing each of the several grades of 
the elementary school, and when these age-grade stand- 
ards are determined in view of up to fourteen years and 
a half as the upper normal-age limit for completing the 
elementary school. 
(6) Age-grade reports, to be valuable as a means of 
guidance to the Board of Education and to administra- 
tive officers, should be made at the end of the year for 
the official school year as a whole. Age-grade reports, - 
to be valuable to principals and teachers in the proper 
classification and instruction of pupils, should be made 
at the beginning of the school term or year. 
(7) When an age-grade report is made at the end 
of the year for the official year as a whole, the ages of 
   
-P-A-G-E-276
. Conclusions and Recommendations 265 
the children should be taken as of the date of the close 
of the official school year. When an age-grade report 
is made at the beginning of the school term or year, the 
ages of the children should be taken as of the date of 
the beginning of the official school year. 
(8) In making age-grade reports the ages of the 
children should be based on the date of birth—year, 
month, and day—and taken in terms of years, months, 
and days. 
(9) There should be included in an age-grade re- 
port for the elementary school, all children who can be 
classified with reasonable accuracy as having completed 
or as entering one or the other of the several grades of 
the elementary school. The only pupils in the elemen- 
tary school who probably cannot be included in such a 
report are those in ungraded classes for physically and 
mentally defective pupils and those in trade-schools. 
(10) Age-grade reports, whether made at the end 
of the year, for the official year, or made at the begin- 
ning of the year, for a given class of a given grade, or 
for the system as a whole, should be based on the total 
or net register. 
RECOMMENDATIONS 
In view of the foregoing conclusions we recommend: 
(1) That the methods employed by the City Super- 
intendent of Schools in making age-grade re- 
ports be materially modified. 
(2) That an age-grade report be made at the end 
of the year for the official school year as a 
whole, to supply the Board of Education and 
its administrative officers with the basic infor- 
mation needed for their guidance. 
(3) That an age-grade report be made at the begin- 
ning of the year to supply principals and teach-

(5) 
(6) ers with the facts upon which they may rely in 
making classification and in carrying on the in- 
struction of pupils; that these reports be for the 
several classes of each school and for each 
school, but not for the system as a whole. 
That up to fourteen years and a half be ac- 
cepted as the upper normal-age limit for com- 
pleting the elementary school. 
That age-grade reports be made according to 
the provisions of this report. 
We would also recommend : 
(a) That data be collected at once by the 
Board of Education on the ages and 
grades of children; that complete and ex- 
act information may be had with respect 
to the age-grade condition in the ele- 
mentary schools of the-city. 
(b) That data be collected at once on the 
causes of over age in the elementary 
schools, and 
(c) That an immediate investigation be made 
of to what extent pupils now in special 
classes are classified and are instructed in 
view of the causes of their being over age.

RACQ 
INTRODUCTION | 
Draper in his “Intellectual Advancement of Civilization” says: “Individual 
advancement is the model for social progress. Nowhere is the truth of this to 
be found so fully realized as in these United States, where individual advance- 
ment is marked in every avenue of life. “Excelsior” is inscribed on the banner 
of every man and woman, borne onward and forward through the rush and 
crush, through the whirlpools and fast flowing streams of life’s kaleidoscopic 
changes, ever reaching higher and higher and becoming more and more and 
still more perfect in their particular sphere and in their own individual calling. 
For twenty years the author has devoted his time and study to the compila- 
tion of a book for self-instruction in the art of cutting and designing men’s 
garments, so arranged that any one of average intelligence can master it with 
proper care and necessary diligence. 
The student will find the system extremely simple and entirely free from 
complication; no scale or chart of any kind is used, simply the ordinary divis- 
ioned square and inch tape measure; everything which might have a tendency to 
befog and mislead the student has been eliminated, so that every line drawn and 
applied may be easily grasped and perfectly understood. To produce a method 
of cutting where the points are based on the actual build of a man, and to be 
reproduced as nearly perfect as is possible to human ingenuity is what has been 
sought in this work. The author has so far succeeded that of the many who 
have studied, either by direct instruction or by the aid of this publication, not 
one has failed to enjoy the fullest confidence of their clientage. Particularly is 
this system of value where cutting has to be done without “try-on,” and at no 
time can a garment be spoiled. The perfect points being the fundamental object 
of this method. :

  PREFACE 
In placing this work before the Cutting Fraternity, we feel. confident that 
we have placed before them something that is useful and practical. Unlike any 
other work of its kind, its construction is simple and easy to understand. It has 
been our aim to eliminate all discussion of an anatomical nature, for we do not 
pretend to teach anatomy, nor do we try to convince the student of something 
we are not convinced of ourselves. We do claim that our work is absolutely 
practical, and correct, its measures are simple, and applied on the pattern exactly 
as taken, they will cover any and all points that have heretofore confused the 
cutter. There will be no need for the cutter to mark on the book “R. B.” for 
round back or “O. E.” for over erect or any other sign by which to show the 
shape of his customer, for his measurements will show all such points. We 
feel certain that any cutter following the instruction of the AMERICAN GAR- 
MENT CUTTER will be satisfied with the results obtained.

PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION 
-The publication of the first and second editions of this work marked an-era in 
the history of cutting, as it was the introduction of a Self-Instructor that en- 
abled the student to intelligently understand a system that was Simple, Concise 
and Practical. . 
The many systems that were heretofore published, advanced theories and 
expounded systems that proved to be so intricate and ambiguous they left the student floundering in uncertainty, and necessitated either a course of personal 
instruction, or a return to his former system that had proved unsatisfactory... 
' The great success that attended the sale of the first and second editions 
of this work is evidenced by that fact that many orders have been held: in abey- 
ance pending the publication of this edition, the first and second issues having 
been entirely sold out many months ago. 
That the Author has succeeded in producing a work fulfilling all the re- 
quirements of a Self-Instructor is attested to by the result that not a single 
request for an explanation of any point has been received since the first and 
second issues were presented to the public. 
Whilst the fundamental principles of the system taught.in the previous 
editions have been retained, yet some changes have been made that practical . 
experience has found to be beneficial, and many diagrams of garments added 
that make this the most complete work on Garment Cutting ever published. 
Whether it be a Practical Cutter or Tailor, or one totally unacquainted 
with the art of Cutting, the Author is convinced that any person of average 
intelligence can become a master of the art through the medium of this publi- 
cation. . 
The system as taught does not require changing when the vagaries of 
Fashion decree a different style, but can be used for all time, and embrace 
within its scope every outer garment worn by man. 
The claims made for this work are fully borne out by the success attained 
by those who studied the first and second editions, and we know that it will 
meet with the same favor. as its predecessor, and be of invaluable use to those 
who purchase it.

6 AMERICAN GARMENT CUTTER 
THE MEASURING OF THE HUMAN BODY. 
_ The fact. that in order to perfectly fit the human body perfect measurements are required, 
cannot be too often urged upon the cutter, and not only that, but it requires much tact on 
the part of the cutter to get his customer to forget that he is being measured. A fact well 
known among cutters is, that ninety-nine out of one hundred men will pose, unconsciously 
perhaps, while being measured. It is common to see a man standing erect, with shoulders 
thrown back and chest expanded, and if you were to ask him to stand natural, he would be 
indignant and answer, “why of course this is my natural position,” but if after the garment is 
completed, he stoops forward, his chest sunken in, his back rounded, it will then be necessary 
for the cutter to either make a big alteration or a new garment; so it will readily be seen that 
the cutter who can make his customer forget that he is being measured, has the best chance 
of success. 
If my opinion was asked as to whether actual measurements or proportions were the 
safest method to cut by, my answer would be actual measurements by all means, providing 
you have the ability to take an accurate measurement, otherwise use proportions. Propor- 
tions, therefore, would be my second choice, and judging by the various measuring devices 
that are being studied and invented, it would seem as if a great number of cutters are realiz- 
ing that the proper measurements of the body is one of the greatest, if not the greatest, factor 
in producing that which the cutter is aiming to produce. But so far as I can see, no instru- 
ment has yet been devised that can really give.a good measurement, i. ¢., an instrument which 
the young student, as well as the practical cutter, can handle with an equa! degree of confi- 
dence and certainty. 
From my experience, I find that the only correct line needed for attitude is the horizontal 
line, this being the breast line. If such a line could be definitely located, the difficulty in meas- 
urements would be done away with. I therefore advisé using the floor level for the breast 
line, as is shown in this book, and even if the breast line is taken one-quarter or one-half inch 
lower than the actual depth the armscye calls for, or if taken that much higher than it should 
be, then it will still leave the front and back lengths from the floor level the same. Conse- 
quently, if the scye depth is one-half inch too deep, so is the front shoulder length, and if too 
high, so is the front shoulder length. The balance, therefore must be the same. 
The next important measurement is the waist indentation. We all kuow that the greater 
the waist hollow, the more back length we need, and that length can only be had by hollow- 
ing the backpart at the waist the proper amount to correspond with the indentation; this 
will adjust the lengths of the backpart from the breast line down, the same as the scye depth 
and strap will adjust it from the scye depth up. 
HOW TO MEASURE. 
Before measuring, it is well to see that the sides of the Vest are not too loose; if neces- 
sary, pin up both sides of the Vest, but see that the center seam of the back is in the right 
place. 
Use the ordinary division square. Place square under the arm with the long end down 
and parallel with the body. (See Fig.1). The short end to be close, but not tight, under the 
arm; make a chalk mark on top of it in front. —— oe

Now place the short end of the square under the arm with the long end upward (see Fig. 
2), still keeping the inner edge of it close, but not tight, at the front scye; mark at the outer 
edge of it across the first line, so that it leaves a cross mark at the front scye.

After obtaining this point, place the square and yardstick together (Fig. 4) and measure 
the distance from that square line down to the floor as shown. 
After the length is obtained, proceed as per Fig. 5. Mark the same distance from 
the ground up on the backpart on each side.

Place the square across the two lines and mark on the center seam. (Fig. 6). Now place 
the tape string around the hollow part of the waist and mark the waist length at C. Go 
down from C to D six inches for the hip measure. It is easily understood that no matter 
where the hip may be, ‘50 long as you go down the same distance for the draft as the 
measure, you must be right.

(Fig. 7). Now place the yardstick against the back and seat, and place the square to the 
hollow of the waist to see how much indentation there is between the waist hollow and the 
stick. Now, the average indentation at that place is 114 inches, but this may be more or less. 
We shall explain later on how this measurement is used.

(Fig. 8). Now beginning at the collar button, proceed to measure as follows: first from 
the socket bone or collar button to the seye depth; on to the waist length and full length, 
It is not necessary to call off the seat length for the simple reason that the seat length is 
always 6 inches below the waist. 
    
(Fig. 9). Now take the strap measure from the collar button down to the front mark. 
  
(Fig. 10). The overshoulder measure from the scye depth at the center of back, across 
the shoulder to the front cross mark. 
  
(Fig. 11). The blade measure, from the front cross line under the arm and over the blade 
to the center seam of the backpart as illustrated. The breast measure, which should be taken 
naturally, neither too loose nor too tight, should be taken over the largest part of the blade. 
Then take the waist and seat measure. In taking the seat measure, we always make our ad- 
ditions to the measurements in the following manner: let us assume that the man to be 
measured has two hip pockets in his trousers. If at the time of taking the measure, there 
should be nothing in either pocket, we add 1 inch to the measurements; should the one pocket 
be full and the other one empty, we give %4 inch; should both pockets be reasonably full, 
we take the measurements easy and call it net. 
THE VEST. 
If measured for a suit, all that is needed is the opening and full length measure, other- 
wise take the same measurements as for the coat.

TROUSERS. 
Measure the outside seam from the hip bone to the top of heel and reduce 34 inch. 
For the inseam, have the trousers well drawn up and measure from the crotch to the top 
of heel and reduce 34 inch; then measure the waist, hip, seat, thigh, knee and bottom. 
In measuring the trouser length, it must be remembered that if the trousers were mide 
to come down to the top of heel they would be entirely too long for wear, but if made 3; inecli 
above the heel it will give them the right lengta for medium widths. If the trouser legs arc 
to be very narrow, the reduction may be linch; very wide trousers may be reduced 13 inch 
but trousers with a permanent turn-up should de made from 114 to 2 inches shorter than the 
actual measurements.

THE SQUARE. 
The square used for these diagrams is a plain division square, understood by must cut- 
ters, but for the benefit of those who do not understand it, we herewith give an explanation 
of the divisions of same. 
  The long end of the square is divided into 4, %, '%, 12, 1-24; the short end is divided into 
14,4. 4%, 1-16 and 1-32. Should you try to find $g of any size, say 36, 40 or 48, look at the 
short end of the square marked 4%, and there you will find the number you want, IS for 36, 
20 for 40, or 24 for 48. Should you want % of any size, look at the same short end of square 
marked %, or if you want %, % or v:, look at the long end for the mark }3, !é oro) and you 
will find it. 
In drawing for square lines, be sure that you hold your square on the one line firmly, 
while drawing the right angle, for one line off will spoil the whole drait. 
DIAGRAM I. 
We will now proceed with the first lesson which is the groundwork. The measure- 
ments for this diagram are as follows: 
    Indentation .............202 0.2 114 inches 
Scye depth .............. 0.20. eee 9 inches 
Waist length ..................2. 1614 inches 
Full length ................0.0.008, 30 inches or whatever it might be 
Strap - 12. inches 
Overshoulder .............. 000005 » 1% inches 
Blade ............0--..0..002. .. 12% inches 
Breast ........ 0. cece cece eee . 36 inches 
Waist .. 32. inches 
Hip oo... eee eee ees 38 inches 
Square down and out from A. 
From A to B is the scye depth plus 4 inch; to C is natural waist length; C te D is 
6 inches always; A to E is full length; F is halfway between A and B: G is halfway hbe- 
tween A and F; square out from G, B, C, D and E. 
From C to 2 is one-half the indentation, in this case 34 inch; from E to 22 is one-half the 
distance of C to 2, in this case % inch. This is for body fitting coats. If the coat is to be 
loose, make the distance from FE to 22 the sane as €C to 2, but if the coat is to be a full box 
coat, then draw a line from F through 2 down to the bottom. Draw a line from F to 2 and 
from 2 to 22 and shape the center seam; this locates point 1. 
From 1 to H is one-half full breast; H to Lis 134 inches; 1 to J is 34 inch; W is halfway 
between 1 and H; from K to L is 3% inches always; square down from L; this line drawn 
down from L is used as the waist division an‘l never changes; now apply the blade measure 
from 1 to L which is 1214 inches and make no additions to it, because in taking the measure 
we have made a mark in front of the square which gives us the necessary addition; square 
up from L. 
Now let it be understood that the blade measure does not always come even with the line 
squared down from L, as the increase or decrease of the blade measure may move the linc 
either forwards or backwards from that point. This will be more fully explained as we 
proceed with our diagrams. 
Point M is % of the blade measure, which is halfway between 1 and L; from M to N 
is 114 inches; square up from N; this locates (; point 4 is halfway between M and N, 
but this may be moved forwards to N or further backwards in accordance with the style 
coat desired. If the back is to be very shapely, we can move point 4 back as far as point 
M or if the back is to be straight, we may move it forwards to N. 
From 22 to 7 is the same distance as from 1 to 4; draw a line from 4 to 7; from N up 
to P is t breast; square forwards from P; from P to X is % inch; from A to 8 is 6% 
inches; from 8 to 9 is 1% inches; draw a line from A to 9; from A to 10 is % breast; 
square up from 10 to locate 11; draw a line from about ¥4 inch below 11 to O; from Q to 
Ris % indentation, in this case 34 inch; from Q to S is % waist; place the square to points 
R-S and square down; this will regulate the front edge. 
I consider the waist indentation as normal at 114 inches; if the waist indentation 
is greater than 134 inches, the body is sway back. In such a case, the front edge retreats 
from the waist down and causes the side seam to swing further back. Point T is halfway 
between Q and S; point U is halfway between L and I; draw a line from T through U up.

Measure the distance from A to 11 which is the top width of back; apply this amount 
to point L and measure up to V the strap measure plus 34 inch for seams; draw a line 
from V to O; from V to Z is % inch less than the width of the back shoulder. This is 
not for stretching, but the backpart is to be fulled in against the forepart 3g inch; shape 
the shoulder from about ¥% inch below the line up to V and also the armscye as shown. 
Square forwards from V by line T-U; from V to W is % breast plus % inch; draw 
a rounding line from W to J; this line is necessary for a coat that is to button up to 
the neck; in this case, however, it is only a guide for the gorge. 
From V to Y is % breast; W to X is % breast; this distance may be increased or 
decreased in accordance with the prevailing style; draw a line from Y to X and shape 
the gorge; from J to 12 is 1 inch; S to 131s the same; square down from 13 by line R-s: 
this locates 6; from 6 to 15 is 3 inches.

Apply the seat measure from 23 to 3 and from 15 to 20; the additions to this seat 
have already been made in the measurements, therefore the measurements are applied net. 
From 20 back to 19 is 2 inches; square up from 19 to locate 18; draw a line from 1s 
through 20 down and shape the side of the forepart as shown; from 18 to 21 is the same 
distance as from 5 to 7; from 16 to 17 is 44 breast; shape the bottom of forepart from 
21 to 17%. 
Now if a close-fitting coat is desired, proceed as follows: from S back to If is 2'4 
inches; apply the waist measure from 5 to 2 and from 14 to 18; the surplus that you 
will find between the actual measure and 18 is to be taken out as an under-arm fish as 
shown. Where an under-arm fish is cut out from the forepart, lower the scye as at KN. one- 
half the amount that has been cut out at the waist. This is not for chest effect. — It 
is merely that the side of the forepart should be held short at the waist and even on the 
top. 
THE COLLAR 
If a straight crease collar is desired, proceed as follows: from V to 34 is 144 inches; 
this represents the collar stand; draw a line through 34 to where the top button hole 
is placed; from 24 to 25 is 114 inches; shape the collar stand from 25 through V inte 
the gorge; from V to 25 is 3g inch more than the top width of back; square up from Y5 
to 24; from 24 to 26 is the width of the collar desired plus a seam; finish the collar as 
shown. On another page we will show different kinds of collars. 
To mark the pocket, proceed as follows: place the square to line R-S and square down ; 
from L to 27 is % of the sleeve length plus 4% inch but this may be changed in cases 
where the style of sack coat is extremely short or extremely long. Under these con- 
ditions, the distance may be increased or decreased to correspond with the coat style. 
Measure the distance from the bottom of the forepart up to 28 and also 29; the pocket 
should run parallel with the bottom of the forepart. 
Make the distance from 2% to 28 about % breast and from 28 back to 29 the size 
pocket desired; if a ticket pocket is wanted, place the square to lines 28-29 and square 
up to 30; from 28 to 30 is 3% inches; square forwards and backwards from 30; from 
30 to 31 is 1 inch; 31 to 32 is 3% inches.

After the backpart and before the forepart is cut out place the back shoulder seam 
to the front shoulder as shown on this diagram and apply the overshoulder measure plus 
1 inch, from B to L; if correct, reshape the gorge and also the armscye so as to carry 
-the lines perfectly and cut out the forepart.

Should the overshoulder be too long, overlap it as from Z to Y until the proper 
measurement plus 1 inch addition is obtained and reshape the shoulder as shown on this 
diagram. 
DIAGRAM 6 
In case an artificially high shoulder is desired, proceed as in diagram 6; draw a line 
from the breast line up to A, also draw a line across the shoulder as at F-G; open the 
shoulder from F to G say 3% or ¥% inch, allowing it to overlap at the gorge. This will 
advance the shoulder point as from A to D and raise it as at E; reshape the shoulder, 
gorge and armscye as shown by the broken line.

Should one shoulder be higher than the other, always take your measurements on 
the high side and cut your pattern for that side, but make your changes on the low side 
as shown on diagram 7. : 
Let us assume that the low shoulder is 14 inch low, then proceed as follows: lower 
the back from 13 to 14 say % inch and from 11 to 12 the same; place your regular back- 
part to point 14 and mark it as per broken line from 12 to 14; now pivot your backpart 
at 12 and swing it until point 10 will strike on line 9; reshape the backpart as per broken 
line; shorten the forepart from 15 to 16 the same amount as the backpart has been low- 
ered from 13 to 14. 
DIAGRAM 8 
It ofteri happens that the body swings over to one side, in which case it appears 
that one shoulder is lower than the other and yet if both shoulders were measured sepa- 
rately, the measurements on both sides would be the same. Still onthe low side, the 
coat would strike against the seat and the same amount would swing off on the high side 
in which case the change should be made as shown on this diagram. 
After the forepart and backpart have been cut for the high side, split the backpart 
as from 1 to 2; overlap it from 2 to 3 the amount the one shoulder is lower than the 
other and do the same with the front part; split the front part as from 4 to 5 and over- 
lap it from 5 to 6 the same amount as the backpart has been overlapped from 2 to 3: 
straighten the center seam of the back as shown by the broken line and fill in the side 
seam the same amount.

locate O; N to P is *% breast; point.4 is halfway between M and N; from 22 to 7% is the 
same distance as 1 to 4; draw a line from 4 to 7; from A to 25 is % the distance of L 
to 23 or 4 of the blade increase; shape the center back from 25 into F. 
From A to 8 is 63 inches; 8 to 9.is 1% inches; draw a line from ‘A to 9; from 25 
to 10 is % breast; square up from 10 to locate 11; draw a line from %4 inch below 11. to 
O and shape the back as shown; point T is halfway between Q and S; U is halfway be- 
tween L and I; draw a line from T through U up; from 25 to 11 and L to V is the strap 
measure plus 34 inch; draw a line from V to O; from V to Z is 3 inch less than the 
back shoulder width; drop the shoulder 3 inch below Z and shape the shoulder and arm- 
scye, . 
Now finish this coat in the same manner as described on diagram 3. This slight round 
that we have obtained at the center of back will bring the shoulder width up to the 
normal and will give just enough round to pocket the blade bone, and give it a clear 
side seam.

the backpart is cut out, add from A to B % or % inch and reshape-the backpart as shown 
by broken line. This part of the back is to be drawn in and pressed back; there is no 
wing to be put in on that part of the back in making up coat.

Diagram 13 shows how to increase the width of the shoulder. If an extremely wide 
shoulder is wanted, you may proceed as shown in this diagram. Add from A to B and 
11 to 12 say % inch; add from V to W the same amount; add to the backpart from O to 
N about ¥% inch or 34 inch; add from P to Q \ inch and reshape the back part as per broken 
line. Now place the back shoulder alongside of the front shoulder and reshape the forepart 
as from Y to correspond with the back part asat N. This will increase the shoulder width 
without disturbing or interfering with any other part of the coat. Of course the armhole 
should be measured for the sleeve before the addition has been made.

from 16 to 1% is 4% breast; from 6 back to 15 is 3 inches; this being a stout man’s coat and 
the seat measure being small, we apply the measurements in the following manner: from 
S back to 14 is 2% inches; from 5 to 2 and 14 to 18 is the waist measure net. We always 
make it a rule to cut the stout man’s or fat man’s coat with as little addition as possible

through 20°down and shape the side of forepart; from 18 to 21 is the same distance as 
from 5 to 7; draw a straight line from 21 to 17, 
Now apply the actual seat measure from 24 to 3 and from 15 to 25; the distance from 
25 to 20 is surplus and is to be taken out as will be shown in the next diagram; mark the 
pocket as usual after which split the forepart as from 30 to 24 and cut the pocket open 
as from 24 to 27 and from 27 down to 28. (Now see’ diagram 19).

Place the two parts of the forepart together at 27, and keep the two edges close at 24s 
overlap them between 28 and 29 until the distance from 1 to 2 is the same as the surplus 
is on the previous diagram from 25 to 20; place the square to line 24-27 and square up 
to 30; make the distance from 27 to 30 about 3 inches; cut out a small V of about 14 inch 
between 27 and 30. 
Now clip out a small piece as at 24; this will make up for the two seams which will 
be taken out at 27, and will flatten the forepart at the front corner of the pocket and 
throw a little fulness over the hip as is necessary for a man of this build. 
Notice also the change that has taken place from the thin line to the heavy line at the 
bottom. After the front has been overlapped between 28 and 29, draw a straight line from 
25 to the bottom of the side seam. This will give the amount of excess length that is re- 
quired to go over the round part of the stomach.

Should one shoulder be lower than the other proceed as follows; the frock coat should 
always be measured and cut for the high shoulder, as explained for ‘sack coats, and the 
change should be made on the low side. If the difference between one shoulder and the 
other is 1% inch, lower your sidebody from F to G % inch and from D to E the same. Move 
point G of the sidebody up on a level with the forepart and shorten the side of the forepart

We often hear cutters say our trade is a college trade,—young men o/ athletic build 
with large chests and small waists. The following diagrams will show how the same 
method of cutting will produce a coat for the athlete with a large breast and a small waist. 
The measurements are as follows: 
Indentation ..............000 2 inches Overshoulder ................ 1734 inches 
Seye depth .............00.000. inches Blade .............0.. 0 eee 13 inches 
Waist length inches Breast ...............0 eee 38 inches 
Full length .............. . inches Waist ...... cece eee eee 32. inches

  Square down and out from A. 
From A to B is the scye depth plus 4 inch; C is waist length, C to 1D is 6 inches; 
A to E is full length; F is halfway between A and B; G is halfway between A and I: 
square out from G, B, C, D and E. 
From C to 2 is % the indentation, in this case 1 inch; from E to 22 is % the distance 
of C to 2, in this case % inch; draw a line from F to 2 and 2 to 22 and shape the center 
of back; this locates 1; from 1 to H is % breast: H to I is 134 inches; I to J is 34 
inch; K is halfway between 1 and H; K to L is 3% inches; square down from L to locate 
Q; apply the blade measure from 1 to L which is 13 inches and square up. 
Point M is halfway between 1 and L; from M to N is 14% inches; square up from N 
to locate O; from N to P is %& breast; point 4is halfway between M and N; from 22 to 7 is 
the same distance as from 1 to 4; draw a line from 4 to %; from A to 8 is 63% inches; 8 
to 9 is 1% inches; draw a line from A to 9; from A to 10 is % breast; square up from 
10 to locate 11; draw a line from % inch below 11 to O and shape the back. 
Add an extra 4% inch at 19; from Q to S is 4 waist, in this case 8 inches; point T 
"is halfway between Q and S; point U is halfway between L and I; draw a line from T 
through U up; from A to 11 and L to V is the strap measure plus 34 inch; draw a line 
from V to O; from V to Z is 3% inch less than 11 to O; drop the shoulder 3 inch at Z and 
shape the shoulder and armscye. . 
Square forwards from V by line T-U; from V to W is % breast plus 34 inch; make the 
distance from W to X to suit the style; from V to Y is % breast; shape the gorge; from 
Q to R is 4 the indentation, in this case 1 inch; draw a line from R through S; from ’S to 
13 is 1 inch; J to 12 is the same; square down from 13 by line R-S; this locates point 6 
and 16; from 6 to 15 is 3 inches; S to 14 is 2% inches; apply the waist measure from 5 
.to 2 and 14 to 24; point 18 is halfway between 5 and 24; apply the seat measure from 19 to 
3 and 15 to 20; draw a line from 18 through 20 and shape the side of forepart; this leaves 
the distance between 18 and 24 to be suppressed. 
Cut out an under-arm fish which may be taken out a little larger than usual, and also a 
front fish if desired. In cutting a front fish proceed as follows: start the under-arm fish 
about 1 inch above the pocket; now cut your front fish, which is placed about 1 inch from 
the front of the pocket to strike about the center of the breast pocket; cut the pocket open 
from the front fish to the side fish and take out a small V on a line parallel with the 
under-arm fish as shown; this will take off one seam at the front fish and the V that is 
cut out in the pocket will take up the other seam and make the upper and lower edge 
of the pocket correspond. , , 
From 18 to 21 is the same distance as from 5 to %; 16 to 1% is % breast; shape the front 
edge, bottom of forepart and finish.

THE SLEEVE. 
Diagrams 75 and %6 show how to measure the armhole for the sleeve. Measure the 
armscye closely, beginning at 1 through 2 and up to 3; now let us say that this armhole 
measures 19 inches; proceed as follows: point 2 is 1 inch above the breast line and is the 
front notch; for the back go up %4 of the armscye from the breast line and place the notch 
there. -- / 
Place the back shoulder along the front shoulder as shown on diagram 76; point 5 is 
the back notch; now measure the distance on a straight line from the front notch to the 
back notch; this distance is 914 inches; make your sleeve as shown in the following way. 
DIAGRAM 77 
From A to B is % of the armscye; from B to C is the same distance as from 4 to 9, 
which is the distance from the back notch to the breast line; from B to D is 1 inch always 
which is the same distance as. the front notch from the breast line; B to E is full length of 
the sleeve; square out from C, B and E. This sleeve is to be made up with very little wad- 
ding; should a regular pad be desired for the sleeve head, make the distance from A to B, 
¥% armscye plus % inch, but the distance from B to C always remains the same as from the 
breast line to the notch. 
From D to K is 9% inches which is the same distance as from 2 to 5 on a straight line 
(diagram 76); square down from K; this locates L; point M is halfway between L and B; 
square up from M; this locates points O and N; point P is halfway between A and N; 
draw a line from P to D; place the square to line O-E and square back; from E to U is the 
width of the sleeve desired plus 1 inch for seams. 
In frock coats or. sack coats where an underarm fish is cut out, make the distance from 
K to V ¥% inch; in sack coats or overcoats where no underarm fish is cut out, make the 
distance from K to V, 44 inch; in this case from K to V is % inch; add % inch width on top 
of the undersleeve at V for a seam; draw a line from V to M; from B to G is 1% inches; 
E to H is the same; B to 1 is the same distance as B to G; E to J is the same distance 
as E to H; hollow the upper and undersleeve as at Q and R, 34 inch and add the same amount 
from S to T and shape the sleeve; in shaping the undersleeve go up from 1 to F a full 14 inch.

In a case of measuring the armhole on a frock coat, proceed in the same manner as 
described on diagrams 75 and 76, but before measuring the distance from the back notch to 
the breast line, let the back overlap the sidebody a %4 inch before méasuring same. 
DIAGRAM 79 
This sleeve is made the same as shown on diagram 77 with the exception that it is 
cut half and half, therefore add a seam at D which is an extra 14 inch to the upper and 
under sleeve as shown and finish the same as the other sleeve. 
DIAGRAM 80 
If an extra easy sleeve is desired, make your sleeve.as shown in this diagram. From 
A to B is % the armscye; B to C is the same distance as from the breast line to the back 
notch; from B to D is 1 inch always; from D to K is the width of the sleeve as shown on 
Diagram 76; square down from K; this locates I; M is halfway between I and B; square 
up from M; this locates points O and N; point P is halfway between A and N; draw a line 
from P to D; from I down to S$ in this case is 14 inch; place the square to S-B and square 
down; this locates point-H; square back from H by line O-H and make the width of the

In cutting sleeves for overcoats, the same method is used as for under coats. The only 
change made is that the overcoat sleeve is cut 14 inches larger around the wrist than an 
under coat sleeve of the same size would be. To measure the armhole for a Box Over- 
coat, proceed as follows: do not add the overlap as from 1 to 2 in the measuring of the arm- 
holes, but begin as at A and measure around through 2 straight up to B; for the overlap 
between 1 ‘and 2 there is an addition made on the undersleeve. 
DIAGRAM 82 
SLEEVE FOR BOX OVERCOAT. 
The size of this armhole is 21 inches; the width of the.sleeve on a straight line is 10 
inches. 
Square down and out from A. 
From A-to B is % of the armscye; B to C is 4 of the armscye; B to D is 1 inch; square 
out from C and B; from D to K is 10 inches; square down from K; this locates L; M is 
halfway between-L and B; square up from M; this locates points O and N; point P is half- 
way between A and N; draw a line from P toD; from M back to V is % inch; take out 
nothing at K but draw a line from K to V; this gives the extra 14 inch that is required for the 
overlap of the armhole from 1 to 2 (diagram 81); add | on a seam to the undersleeve as 
shown. 
From B to E is the sleeve length; in the case of an overcoat, the sleeve is cut the 
same length as for the under coat;- there is no need to add any length because the backpart 
and shoulder having become wider and the armhole deeper, this gives sufficient length to 
the sleeve by making it the same length as the under coat; square back from E by line O-E. 
From E to U in this case is 714 inches; this will finish the sleeve 14 inches and will make 
it 114 inches wider than an under coat sleeve of. the same size would be. Add from B to 
G 1% inches and from E to H the same; reduce the undersleeve from B to 1 and E to J 
the same amount as has been added to the upper sleeve; hollow at Q and R, 34 inch and add 
the same amount from S to T.

For a narrow shoulder manipulate the sleeve as follows: first of all cut all your should- 
ers natural width; by natural width, I mean that after the back width is squared up, make 
the distance from 1 to 2 at least 34 inch. 
Now see diagram 83. After the pattern is finished with the natural shoulder, measure 
the armscye and mark the notches; now draft the sleeve for the natural armscye and pro- 
ceed as follows: place the back shoulder along the front shoulder and reshape the shoulder 
width, see diagram 83, broken line, but do not cut out. 
Now see diagram 84. Place the original back notch to the sleeve head as at 3; extend

Measurements for-trousers should be taken in the following manner: the outside 
length should be taken from the hip bone down to the top of heel, minus 34 inch for regu- 
lar trousers. If the, trousers are to be very narrow, the measurements may be made minus 
Linch. Loose leg trousers may always be -made slightly longer than tight leg trousers; 
the inseam should be taken from the crotch down to the top of the heel minus the same a- 
mount as has been reduced on-the outside seam. The waist measure should be taken 1% 
inch closer than the natural measure because the measurements are taken over the trousers 
and the trousers will be worn over the underwear. The seat measure should be taken natu- 
ral, neither too loose nor too tight and knee and bottom should be taken according to style.

18 inches, therefore make the distance from S to T, 8 inches, which is 4 of 16. 
THE BACKPART 
From Q to U is 1 inch; T to V is 11% inches;.S to W is 14 inch; measure the bottom, 
’ plus 1 inch for seams from T to S and V to 3; point 4 is halfway between 3 and W; V to 5 
is the same distance as 3 to 4; V to 1 is 5 inches; W to 2 is the same; shape the backpart 
as shown. 
Diagram 151—This diagram shows how to manipulate the backpart of a pair of trousers 
for a back bow: After the forepart and backpart have been cut out, proceed as follows: split 
the backpart as from 1 to 2; overlap th ebackpart as from 2 to 3, % or 34 inch; now make the 
distance from the inseam notch up to 5 the same distance as.it was before being split and re- 
shape the backpart as shown by the broken line. There are quite a number of cutters who 
claim that in a back bow the forepart should be made longer and the backpart shorter, 
but as a matter of fact, the forepart is made longer because as the backpart becomes shorter 
the front part is in itself comparatively longer.

Trousers for bow-legged men are cut as follows: 
Ascertain the amount the legs are bowed by having your customer stand with his heels 
close together; find as nearly as you can theamount of space there is between the knees. 
Let us say the space is three inches, which means that each leg is bowed 1%4 inches. Now, 
having cut the” forepart in the regular way, proceed as follows: (diagram 154). 
Line A-C is the knee line; cut the forepart open as from A to C; lengthen the outside 
seam by opening the. pattern 34 inch, which is one-half the amount of the bow. Reshape 
the outside and inseam by filling in slightly at Cc and reducing the same amount at A-B. 
After the forepart is finished as explained, cut the backpart according to the forepart 
(see diagram 155).

__. RIDING BREECHES 
Riding breeches are to be measured in the following manner: First take the outside seam length, 
from the hip bone down to the top of the heel in the regular way, then the inseam in the regular 
way, next take the waist and seat measures in the usual way for trousers. 
After the measurements are taken in this manner, proceed as follows: (see sketch)— 
The nieasurements should be taken over the drawers, but if so desired, the trousers’may be pinned 
up close to the leg so as to get the complete outiine of the leg; now make a mark as shown on the 
sketch at 1, which is the regular knee; 2 is the small of the knee; 3 is the largest part of the calf; 
if an extension is desired, make a mark also at 4. © 
Now let us suppose that the measurements are as follows. 
     Outside length .. eee 42 inches 
Inseam ....... . 82% inches 
" Waist . 33 inches Seat .. bese   
39 inches

Around the small of knee as at 2... inches 
Around the largest part of calf as at 3... inches . 
Around as at 4 .. inches 
    Now proceed with diagram. , 
Square down and out from-A. 
From A to C is the rise, in this case 914 inches; C to D is 2 inches always; this is to give enough 
length over the knee while sitting; from D to E is 18 inches; to F is 16 inches; to B is 1914. inches; 
to G let us say 24 inches; square out from C. E, F, B and G. 
From C to H is % seat; H to_10 is % seat; point K is halfway between C and 10; square up from 
H; this locates' W; go down from W to X, % inch and draw a line from X to Y; from X to Y is % 
waist; from H to I is % inch; 10 to J is the same; from B to L is % seat; draw a line from L through 
K up; this locates points O and M; from M to N is 4% knee; O to P is 4 small of knee; from L to Q 
is % calf. If the extension is desired, extend that line down and make the distance from-17 to U, %4 
ankle. . 
From L to T is 1 inch; M to R is 1% inches; draw a line from R through T down; draw a straight 
line from J through N and shape the crotch and inseam; from Y to Z is the waist band; from C to 1 is 
1% inches; draw a line from 1 to R; shape the outside seam as shown. 
THE BACKPART 
Extend all the lines as shown and proceed as follows: from 8 to 9 is 4 seat; draw a line from 
10 through 9 up; from 9 to 11 is % seat; from 11.to 12 is 4% waist plus.1!4 inches;- from 1 to 5 is 
134 inches; from 12 to 13 is % inch; draw a line from 13 to 11; from 18 to 16 is % waist plus 2 inches; 
13 to 15 is the same width as Y to Z; sweep from 10 to 7 pivoting at N. . 
From J to 7 is 1% inches; draw a line from 7 to N and from N down through P and Q to U; 
from U to V and U to 22 is the ankle measure plus 1 inch. If the measurements are taken over 
the trousers they are to be cut without any addition, but if taken over the drawers, there is to be 1 
inch addition. This includes all the measurements, i. ¢., the calf, the small of the knee and the knee 
measurements. 
From Q to T and Q to 2 is the calf measure; from P to S and P to 3 is the small! of knee measure; 
from N to R and N to 4.is the knee measure; shape the side seam of the backpart from 12 through 
5, 4, 3 and 2, extending the line from 2 to 23 so as to give it a regular run. Suppress the distance 
between 22 and 23 by cutting out a V as between 20 and 21, including two seams for making up 
_ same; add from 4 to 24,14 inches; 23 to 25 is the same; this is to be used for a button stand. 
If the cloth is soft and can easily be shaped with the iron, the backpart is to be stretched between 
N and Q, also between 4 and 2, and the front part is to be fulled in above the knee. Usually the 
kind of material riding breeches is made of is hard. to press, in which case split the backpart between 
3.and 4 and N and P; take out 1% inch fish under the knee. . These two pieces are to be sewn together 
and this helps to form the backpart of the trousers. The V which is taken out between 20 and 21 is to 
give the proper round over the calf. . 
From 18 to 20 and from V to 21 is the same distance as has been taken. out between 19 and V and 
19 and 18. When this V is sewn up, it will requirethis much more length in order to give the bottom 
of the breeches a straight run. 
Cut out a % inch V at the top of the waistband and finish. *

Riding breeches without extensions. + These breeches are made the same as shown on 
diagram 156, except that they are made without the extensions, and the material is such as 
can be shaped with the iron, therefore, there is no fish cut out under the knee and the 
backpart is cut one-half inch shorter than the forepart so as to allow for the stretching un-

STRAIGHT-FRONT SACK FOR A BOY 6 YEARS OF AGE 
The Proportion Table comes as near the actual breast and waist sizes for children as it 
does for grown people, but in cutting children’s clothing it is always advisable to cut same 
two sizes larger, as it is not good judgment to have children’s clothing fit as closely as 
men’s garments. This coat, therefore, is increased two sizes.

NORFOLK COAT 
Of course there is no limit to the various styles and ways of producing Norfolk Jackets, 
but no matter what the style may be they must all be made to come up to the original pattern 
after the various plaits are inserted. The two Norfolk coats shown here are merely offered 
as suggestions on how to produce same. 
‘This coat is cut from the ordinary sack coat pattern. After the pattern is cut out as 
usual, proceed as follows: 
THE BACKPART 
Point F is halfway between E and G; from E to A is 1% ‘inches; G to B is the 
same; cut the back through as marked; now add a seam to the lower portion of the back 
and add the same to the yoke. : 
The forepart is made in the same way. From K to J is 1 inch; Lis halfway between 
H and J; from H to Cis % inch; K to D is the same; cut the pattern through as from 
‘C to I and from I to D; add a seam to the lower part of the front and the same to the 
yoke.

_ After the back and forepart are cut out proceed as follows: cut off your yoke as marked 
on the forepart and backpart; this may be cut according to taste. Add a seam each to 
the yoke and to the lower part ; line 1-2 on the backpart represents about the center of the 
back; split the pattern down as from 1 to. 2, also through the waistline as 2-3. 
Now take a thin piece of paper, crease it over in either two or three plaits or as many as 
desired. Lay the piece that has been cut out off the backpart on the folded piece and cut 
it according to the original pattern. That piece when opened up should look as shown here 
1, 2, 3 and 4. 
THE FOREPART 
Split the forepart as from D to E, E to B and B to A; now take a piece of soft paper 
and fold in plaits as explained on the backpart; then take the piece that is cut from the fore- 
part and. place it on the plaited piece; cut it out in accordance with the original piece; 
adding seams as at A-C and B-E. Now set the piece back in again as the broken line shows 
and sew the yoke on.

AMERICAN GARMENT CUTTER 293 
A FEW REMARKS ABOUT MAKING COATS. 
The canvas and haircloth for all coats should be cut on the bias as shown on Diagram 
A; cut in this way, it will give freely at the gorge, shoulder and armhole. Some tailors 
consider the canvas on the bias when cut as shown on Diagram B; this is the wrong 
way, because if cut in this way it will be on the straight around the gorge, shoulder and 
armscye, and unless cut in at several places will produce a stiffness and will not give at 
the shoulder and armscye as it should. 
Sack Coats—Before sewing up the side seams it is well to shrink in the back from about 
four inches below the armscye to the shoulder sc as to form a pocket for the blade bone, 
also put in a piece of stay linen at the back of the armscye so as to keep the blade pocket 
in place. If a close-fitting sack coat, you may stretch the backpart slightly at the waist. 
On a straight hanging sack coat or overcoat the. backpart must not be stretched at the 
waist. In pressing the canvas, stretch it slightly at the gorge and shoulder, but do not 
stretch the cloth because the fulling in of the back at the shoulder seam, also the fulling 
in of the collar will give all the stretching needed. 
The Edges—Always dip the stay tape in water and press before using it. When bast- 
ing stay tape on the front edge, hold it short over the breast and work the front edge in, 
so that the roundness of the breast is pressed into the middle of the front and the edge 
becomes straight. “For a stout person, hold the stay tape short over the most prominent 
rounding, which is over the waist. In all straight front coats, such as overcoats, double- 
breasted sacks, or straight-front sacks, the front edges must be worked in until they are 
straight. : 
The Sleeves—In sewing up the front seams always begin at the top, and, basting on 
-the upper sleeve, keep both upper and under sleeves even for about 3 inches; from there 
down, hold the upper sleeve a little short to about 3 inches from the bottom and from 
there down, hold them even. When sewing up the back seam, begin also on top, and basting 
on the upper sleeve, keep them both even to the elbow; over the roundness of the elbow hold 
the upper sleeve easy, and from there down even. 
When basting in the sleeve, begin with the right one and placing the seam of the sleeve 
to the notch of the back hold it easy to about 1 inch beyond the shoulder seam; from there 
on full the sleeve in until the front notch of the sleeve reaches the front notch of the armhole; 
from there hold the sleeve even until you reach the part of the armscye that is drawn 
in with the stay linen and full the undersleeve in over the back. 
The Collar—Collars are to be put in easy in the hollow of the gorge for normal or 
slim persons. A concave shoulder needs a longer collar than a normal shoulder. A 
stout person needs a shorter collar than a normal person. In either case, don’t stretch the 
collar stand. 
. FROCKS : 
In basting the sidebody to the front always begin and keep them even at the armscye 
and hold straight all the way down. 
THE SKIRT 
After the sideseam and fish are sewed and pressed open, baste a piece of stay tape to 
the bottom, or the waist seam of the sidebody, so as to prevent it from stretching, after 
which baste the skirt on, beginning at the side, hold the skirt and sidebody even to the side 
seam. From there on for about 4 inches hold the skirt full, and from there on even to the front. 
In sewing the, back to the sidebody, begin at the armscye and keep both back and 
sidebody even to about 4 inches from the waist; from there down. full the back in about 4 
inch; don’t stretch the sidebody until after the back is sewed on to it, and then only just 
enough to make the backseam straight; shrink in the sidebody halfway.

AMERICAN GARMENT CUTTER — 295 
THE PLAITS 
The proper way to make plaits is to put a baste in 14 inch or a seam back from the 
mark stitch and press the roundness of the skirt in until the plait is straight; then press it 
open as if it were a seam. Pull the baste out and it is ready to be joined to the back. 
The shoulder, collar and sleeves are the same as in the sack coats. 
In double-breasted frocks or dress coats all the seams are joined the same as the single- 
breasted coats, except that the rever is held slightly short over the breast and the bell 
shape skirt needs but little fulness at the wuist. 
VESTS 
Ali vests cut by this system need no collar stand, as the stand is cut on the vest. 
The Edges—All the front edges are to be made straight with the stap tape, i. e., they 
are to be worked in until the edge is straight and the fullness pressed into the middle of 
the front. . 
The Shoulders—The shoulders ought to be stretched slightly and the back held full 
over them. The Collar, if there be one, should be held easy to about 3 inches from the 
shoulder and from there held short to about 2 inches from the front edge. 
Double-breasted vests, with or without collar, or dress vests with low openings should 
have stay tape laid around the opening and held short so as to prevent the edge sticking 
away from the shirt front. 
Double-breasted vests and double-breasted coats must have more breast worked in them 
than single-breasted vests or coats. , 
TROUSERS 
Avoid stretching trousers, except in the backpart from the knee up and that but slight- 
ly. Any stretching on the forepart is sure to spoil them. Let the notches come together 
evenly; hold the forepart easy over the knee and the backpart hold easy over the calf. 
Peg top trousers should have the roundness from over the hip pressed into the back; 
let the forepart be held easy over the backpart from the hip to the knee; waistbands 
should be held a little short over the forepart, easy in hollow of the waist and even from 
there back; the right fly should be held easy in the hollow of the crotch. Let all the shap- 
ing be done by shrinking. Do not stretch,

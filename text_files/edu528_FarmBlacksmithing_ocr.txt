PREFACE 
HIS book is the direct outgrowth of the author’s experiences 
in teaching farm blacksmithing to farm boys. The objects, 
of which the process of making is described in the book, all 
center about farm activities. 
The purpose of the book is two-fold. It is intended as an 
aid to a teacher of farm blacksmithing, being a source of prob- 
lems, and suggestive of how the work may be carried forward. 
In addition to being a “What” and ‘“‘“How”’ book for instructors, 
the author constantly had in mind its direct use by farmers as a 
means of self-instruction in blacksmithing. This accounts for 
certain details and some repetitions. Because of its intended use 
as a book of self-instruction the author has taken little for granted. 
Farm blacksmithing is a rougher type of work than that 
expected of a city smith on automobile or auto truck work. 
The important question is: ‘‘Does it fit and is it strong enough?” 
In welding the question is not, ‘“How does it look?” but ‘Will 
it hold?” 
The dimensions given on the drawings in this book are such 
that the work will be strong enough and of a size in general use. 
The sizes should, however, be modified when individual needs 
require. There is real value in making these new objects to 
dimensicns, because only in that way will a person learn how 
to make duplicate parts for repairs. 
Repair work in schools is only touched on briefly in this book. 
It should be stressed as much as possible, the students bringing 
broken parts of implements, etc., to school to repair. However, 
one who has forged most of the articles, as shown in this book, 
should be able to do almost any kind of blacksmith repair work 
on a farm.

TOOLS FOR THE FARM BLACKSMITH SHOP 
N EQUIPPING a farm blacksmith shop several things should 
be taken into consideration. The initial cost of the equip- 
ment is always an important item. The amount of work likely to 
be done in the shop, the character of the work, etc., should also 
be considered. Fig. 1 illustrates a group of tools which is con- 
sidered a minimum equipment for starting a farm blacksmith 
shop. All simple forging of iron, and welding, can be done with 
these tools. 
  The forge a has an 18x 4-inch hearth. The fan is operated 
by a hand lever. Many larger and better hand forges are made, 
but this one will answer the purpose very well. Fans have now 
practically supplanted bellows for draft, giving as they do, a 
more steady draft. Thesaunch b has a handle. A common size 
of punch is the one having a 3%-inch point. The hand punch 
illustrated in Fig. 3 serves well for punching, especially for 
smaller sizes of holes. Th hammer or blacksmith hi: er 
is shown at c, Fig. 1. One weighing 2 pounds is a good size for 
general work. The machinist’s or ball pein hammer of similar 
weight is now frequently preferred to the one Shown in the 
illustration. The 11-inch hotchisel, d, and 11-inch cold chisel, 
e, are used respectively for cutting hot and cold iron. These 
are many times called hot and cold cutters. The 40-pound 
7

anvil, f, with tool steel face, will be found sufficient for most 
blacksmithing. However, a full-sized blacksmith’s anvil weigh- 
ing about 120 pounds has considerable advantage over this one. 
A bolt bolt tongs - is illustrated at g and a straight lip tongs at h.

The straight lip tongs can easily be formed into a link tongs, 
Fig. 8, when needed. The hardie for the anvil is shown at 7, and 
a blacksmith’s solid box v box vise at k. In Fig. 2 the cold chisel, hot

chisel, hardie and punch are again illustrated, so that the reader 
may gain a better idea of their shapes. A rule, or better still a 
12-inch steel square, is a necessary part of the equipment of a 
farm blacksmith shop. 
In addition to the above tools the following ones will be found 
of considerable help, and time and labor saving. The link tongs, 
Fig. 3, is used especially for holding round iron when it is being 
shaped and welded into circular articles such as links of chain 
and rings. It is also used for holding iron when the ends are 
being squared or upset. These terms will be made clear later. 
 
-P-A-G-E-9
  
TOOLS FOR THE FARM BLACKSMITH SHOP 9 
A good link tongs is easily made from a straight-lip tongs by 
heating the lips or jaws, placing a piece of round iron between 
them near the end, and then hammering down the lips on both 
sides of the iron. A tongs known as the pick-up tongs, having 
much the same shape, can frequently be used in place of a 
link tongs. 
A blacksmith’s hand punch, Fig. 3, is a- 
handy tool, and can readily be forged from 
a piece of octagonal tool steel. It is especially 
useful for smaller holes than can be punched 
with a punch with handle shown in Fig. 2. A 
center punch for marking dimensions on iron, 
and for centering before drilling with the post 
drill is a tool frequently needed. On Plate 27 
will be found working drawings of a black- 
smith’s center punch and hand punch. Ac- 
companying this plate are instructions for 
making them. A blacksmith’s center punch 
with handle is manufactured. 
  Fic. 4 The post drill, Fig. 4, is a great time-and- 
labor saver when many holes are to be made. 
Drilling is easier than punching, and the holes are better shaped. 
A drill is needed when the holes are to be tapped. The fol- 
lowing drills are used most frequently: 14 inch, 3¢ inch, 1% inch, 
Y inch, 5 inch, and 34 inch. 
Some second-cut files, a good monkey wrench or set of S 
wrenches, and a screw-plate set having taps and dies from 
Y inch to 34 inch, are frequently needed. Where repair work 
is done on farm machinery, the cutting of threads on bolts and 
the tapping of holes is often necessary.
-P-A-G-E-10
ADDITIONAL TOOLS USED IN SCHOOLS 
OR the farm blacksmith work in agricultural and technical 
schools of high school or college grade, tools in addition to 
those mentioned above are to be found. These tools are not 
absolutely necessary in the farm shop, but frequently better 
results can be obtained by using them, and a general knowledge 
of their use will do everyone some good. 
ah as Tor AnD Bottom FULLERS’ » Top AND Bottom SwaGEs 
Fic. 5 
The top and bottom fullers, Fig. 5, are used to shape curved 
notches on one or both sides of a piece of iron. The bottom 
fuller fits into the tool hole in the anvil. The top fuller has a 
handle. Fullers are made in different sizes, the most common 
being 3 inch, 14 inch, 34 inch and 34 inch. 
Top and bottom swages, Fig. 5, are used for smoothing pieces 
of iron round after they have been forged approximately round. 
They are frequently used after two round pieces of iron have 
been welded. The diameters of the grooves are of various 
sizes, the most common being 3 inch, 44 inch, 54 inch and 
34 inch. A top fuller and a bottom swage of a larger size can 
be used to bend or curve sheet or flat iron. 
The set hammer, Fig. 6, is used for shaping square corners. 
Set hammers range in size from 114 inches to 2 inches by eighths. 
The 114-inch size is common. 
The flatter, Fig. 6, has a handle like the set hammer. It is 
used, as its name indicates to flatten flat surfaces after they 
10
-P-A-G-E-11
  
ADDITIONAL TOOLS USED IN SCHOOLS 1 
have been shaped with the hand hammer. Flatters range in 
size from 2 inches to 4 inches by quarters. 
  Set HAMMER FLATTER 
Fic. 6 Fic. 7 
Cast iron swage blocks, Fig. 7, come in various 
sizes and shapes. They are usually about 4 inches 
thick. The block can be used in either an upright 
position or flat. The various grooves, and round, 
square and oblong holes are used for shaping. The 
holes can be used for punching, and for shouldering 
thick stock; also for hollowing sheet-metal. 
In Fig. 8 is illustrated a blacksmith’s mandrel or 
cone. These are used for shaping rings and circular - 
objects of all kinds when a true circle or part of a). 
circle is desired. Mandrels range in height from 32 - 
inches to 50 inches and have top diameters of 1- 
inch, 2 inches and 5 inches. ~A mandrel known as 
“Cheney’s”’ has a slot running up the entire height. 
The slot is wide enough to admit the jaws of a 
tongs, and is advantageous when rings are being shaped. 
  Fic. 8 
A person using a forge and anvil should know the names of 
the principal parts so that he can speak intelligently of them. 
The forge illustrated in Fig. 1 is known as a portable forge, and 
 
-P-A-G-E-12
A 12 FARM BLACKSMITHING 
is the least expensive type. This forge is designed principally 
for farmers whose repair work is only occasional, and of a slight 
nature. The draft is furnished by the fan 3. This forge is called 
  Free 9) 
a hand lever forge, because it is operated by a hand lever 1. 
The shield is shown at 2, and the hearth is at 4. Where a con- 
siderable amount of rather large work is to be done a larger 
forge should be purchased. One that has a crank, geared direct 
to the fan at the rear, a half-hood, and a tuyere iron that pro- 
duces a good draft, should be purchased. Several forges of this 
‘type are designed and manufactured primarily for farm use. 
Every forge should have four fire tools: a coal shovel, rake, dipper 
and straight poker. 
The various parts of the anvil, Fig. 9, are named as follows: 
1, horn; 2, face, usually of tool steel; 3, body; 4, tool hole; 5, 
round or pritchel hole; 6, base of horn.
-P-A-G-E-13
BUILDING A FIRE 
HE first thing one who is going to do blacksmithing must 
learn is to builda fire properly. Place a handful of shavings or 
paper in the firepot. Light and give a little draft and throw 
some fine blacksmith coal over it. Let this burn well and then 
push it to the center and add green coal all around it. Green 
coal is nothing more than blacksmith coal thoroly wetted. As 
this coal changes to coke push it to the center and add more 
green coal around the edge of the firepot, until you have a 
fire that is much like that illustrated in Fig. 10. The iron that 
Coke 
Green Coal     
Fic. 10 
is to be forged should be heated in burning coke, not coal. It 
should be placed in the fire horizontal as shown, and not toward 
the bottom of the firepot. The iron should have burning coke 
below, around and above it while heating. 
A second fire is easier to build because some coke will always 
be left over. “All that is required is to start this coke burning 
and heat the iron. The green coal is placed around the edges 
of the firepot so that the gas may be burned out of it and new 
coke continually be formed to take the place of that burned 
away. 
A good blacksmith coal should be used. Tho slightly more 
expensive than ordinary soft coal it is cheaper in the end, because 
of time and labor saved. Blacksmith coal has very little or no 
13

sulphur in it. While iron can be heated with ordinary soft coal 
and shaped, it is out of the question to try to do welding with a 
coal that has sulphur in it.

READING DRAWINGS 
OR the reader who has’ had no experience in reading working 
drawings or blueprints the following brief explanation is offered: 
The drawings in this book are usually composed of one or more 
views of the object in its natural position. ‘Sometimes the 
front view is given, sometimes the front and top, or front and 
side views. In other words, they are the views that one sees 
when looking at the object from the front, top or side of it. 
In order to show the shape of the iron at certain places, cross- 
sections have been drawn on the object where the iron is of the 
shape indicated by the sectional part. If the iron were cut in 
two at the sectional point it would have the shape shown in 
the section. Fig. 11 may make this explanation a trifle clearer.

RING 
This ring is of size frequently used on a farm. By following 
the method given in the note on page 18 the amount of 
stock necessary for any ring may be found. Be sure to read 
what is written about tools in the first section of this book, 
unless you already know the names and uses of common black- 
smith tools. Read all the directions before you begin work

How to Make the Ring 
1. Cut a piece of stock to the dimensions given on Plate 1. 
2. Heat to a cherry red, no hotter, and square both ends as 
shown in Fig. 12. Use a link tongs. In all blacksmithing always 
square the ends of your stock first.

5. Heat and bend the center so that the two ends will come 
together. 
6. True the ring where necessary over the horn of the anvil, 
or a mandrel if you have one. If the two ends are filed a trifle 
just before the bending is completed they can be brought together 
in a better joint. Fig. 14 shows the completed ring.

Note.—To find the amount of stock needed for a ring add the 
thickness or diameter of the iron to the inside diameter of the 
ring. Multiply this sum by 34. What you really do is to mul- 
tiply the diameter running thru the center of the iron by 34. 
See Plate 1.

FLAT POINT STAPLE 
Two staples such as this one, Plate 2, or the square pointed 
one, and the gate hook shown on Plate 3, will always keep a 
gate closed. Try to figure the amount of stock required. You 
have half of a ring, two straight parts 1 inch long and two flat 
points. Read this entire page before you begin work.

2. Heat and hammer, “draw,’”’ both ends to a chisel edge 
working back from the points until they are just 114 inches long. 
Hammer on both sides of the prongs, and always keep the under 
side flat on top of the anvil. Be sure to keep the points 14 inch 
wide at the same time you are flattening them. 
3. Bend at the center over the horn of the anvil as you did 
with the ring. Be sure to bend the points so that they take the 
position shown in Fig. 15 and Plate 2. Rernember the two sides

Notes.—As small iron heats quicker than large be careful not 
to “burn” the points while the upper part of the staple is being 
heated. 
Do not hammer very much on the curve of the staple or it 
will be flattened and become smaller than the other parts

DOOR PULL 
The door pull of the dimensions shown in the drawing, Plate 4, 
is suitable for a single barn door. For a screen door it can be 
made of smaller stock, and for a large sliding door it may be 
made large enough to accommodate two hands. 
How to Make the Door Pull 
1. Cut the stock to the dimensions given on Plate 4. 
2. Flatten out each end to %@ inch thick and 114 inches long. 
Shape as indicated in the drawing. Hold with a bolt tongs. 
3. Mark with center-punch and drill 14-inch holes in the 
ends as indicated. These might be punched with a blacksmith’s 
punch. See “‘How to Punch Holes” under Gate Hinge, Plate 7. 
4. Mark and bend the handle as at AA. over the horn of 
the anvil. 
5. Mark and bend again at BB. In Fig. 19 is shown the 
completed door pull, the one in the illustration, however, was 
bent in a vise at AA. 
Note.—The oily waste used in blackening—see 7 under “How 
to Make a Ring’”’—covers the iron with a thin film of oil. This 
helps to prevent rusting. It is a good policy to blacken all 
forgings in this way. However, this step will not be mentioned 
in the forging of future articles.

ROPE CLEAT 
This rope cleat, Plate 5, is of small size. It is intended for 
small ropes. For large ropes or where there is great strain the 
stock should be correspondingly larger, as 5 inch or 34 inch round. 
How to Make the Rope Cleat 
1. On each end draw a blunted square point 214 inches long. 
See Square Point Staple. 
2. Round the points making them 3 inches long, Plate 5. 
3. Flatten 3 inches of the rod at the center as shown, making 
it %% inch thick. 
4. Mark with center-punch and drill two Y4-inch holes 1144 
inches apart. 
5. Bend the two ends or horns to the shape indicated on 
Plate 5 and in Fig. 20. 
Notes.—If the link, bolt or straight-lip tongs are not of the 
correct size for any particular job, heat and shape them on a 
piece of iron to make them the right size. They can be shaped 
over and over again. 
When heating a piece of iron, turn it over occasionally, so 
that the entire piece will be heated uniformly.

GATE HINGE 
Two new forging operations, punching and riveting, are used 
in making the gate hinge. The stock is listed on the drawing, 
Plate 7. 
How to Make the Gate Hinge 
1. On the hook part of the hinge, A, draw a square point 
21% inches long. 
2. Bend in the vise or over the anvil to form the 114-inch 
hook. Use a set hammer, if you have one, to shape the up- 
turned part perfectly round at the place it is bent. If this part 
is not round the hinge will ‘‘stick.” 
8. On the strap part, B, mark off the centers for the holes and 
the amount of stock used to go around A. 
4. Heat and bend the strap about A making a loose ne so 
that it will turn easily. 
5. If the holes are to be drilled this should be done now. 
Three 14-inch holes for attaching the hinge to the gate, and a 
14-inch hole for the rivet, are needed. 
6. Heat a rivet of the proper size (make one if necessary), 
and rivet together. Fig. 23 shows the completed hinge, with 
the holes punched instead of drilled.

How to Punch Holes 
Heat the iron to a bright red heat. Place on the anvil and 
drive the punch half-way. thru the piece. Turn it over and 
punch half-way thru again. Then place over pritchel hole or 
tool hole and drive out the burr, Fig. 24. These holes can be 
punched with a hand punch also.

instead of pointed. See drawing and Fig. 23. In Fig. 23 is shown 
a nut which was hand made. A piece of square stock was upset 
to the proper size, a 14-inch hole drilled and the hole tapped 
with a 5%-inch tap. 
Be sure the end is perfectly round before you try to thread it.

SQUARE GRAB HOOK 
This hook, with a ring and chain like the one shown in Fig. 41, 
is a very handy article on the farm. The hook is intended for a 
chain having links made of 3¢-inch iron. The width of the 
opening in a hook of this type (1% inch on this one) is always 
determined by the thickness of the chain it is to be used with. 
  
How to Make the Grab Hook 
1. Upset one end of the piece of stock. 
This is done in much the same manner 
as squaringanend. The end of the piece 
is heated to a bright red (not until it 
sparks). It is then hammered, Fig. 12, 
until the end enlarges to about 34 inch 
or more in thickness and for about 1 inc’ 
in length. : 
2. Flatten and shape the end for the 
eye. See the drawing, Plate 8.

4. Draw a square point 2 inches long. See the Square Point 
Staple. 
5. Mark the place for bending. 
6. To bend, heat to a bright red, place in vise at mark, and 
hammer over with a wood mallet to the shape shown on Plate 8 
and Fig. 25. 
Note.—Be sure to bend the 1k at an angle in the vise, so 
that the two sharp corners, not two flat sides, will be opposite 
each other.

This type of clevis is quickly and easily made, and is, there- 
fore, the kind to make for a “help out’? when another breaks. 
How to Make la Small Clevis 
1. Upset both ends of the 14-inch piece of stock for a distance 
of 1 inch. 
2. Flatten and shape these ends as shown in the top and 
front views, Plate 10. Shoulder in for the flat part, on the

size indicated in the drawing. 
Be sure to bend the iron so that 
the straight side is on the inside 
of the clevis. |

SMALL CLEVIs. 
Note.—Drilling thru round stock requires more care and skill 
than is required on flat stock. Hold the piece firmly. When 
the drill starts to come thru it has a great tendency to catch and 
break. Therefore, when you feel the drill beginning to come 
thru do not apply any pressure to it, but let it go thru slowly. 
A broken drill can often be reground when only a part is broken 
off. Use another drill for a pattern when regrinding.

CLEVIS WITH THREADED PIN 
When a person has sufficient time, and a set of thread plates, 
he will do well to make a clevis of this type. It is more satis- 
factory than the small clevis, Plate 10. 
How to Make the Clevis with Threaded Pin 
1. Upset each end of the stocks for a distance of about 114 
inches. | 
2. Shape the ends as shown 
in the top and front views, 
Plate 11. . To make the 
shoulder, shape over the round |

4. Bend over the horn of the anvil to the proper size, and 
with the holes exactly above each other. 
5. Make the pin. Flatten one end to 5 inch thick, 94 inch 
wide and 214 inches long. 
6. Heat, and clamp in the vise, and bend the flattened end 
over to one side, as in Fig. 16. Then bend over the horn of the 
anvil until the curve for the head is almost completed. Finish 
by hammering down directly on the stock until the end comes 
around and touches. The eye of the gate hook, Plate 3, is 
forged in much the same way. Fig. 28 shows the completed 
clevis. 
7. Thread the pin with a 53-inch die. Be sure the end of the 
pin is perfectly round before trying to thread it. f 
Note.—Use plenty of oil when threading a bolt or tapping a 
hole in wrought iron, or “blacksmith iron” or ‘mild steel.” 
In cast iron no oil is required.

SPRING SEAT HOOK 
The bending of the spring seat hook is more difficult than is 
apparent, unless you have a vise with shallow jaws. Two of 
these hooks are screwed or bolted to the wood base of the seat 
spring and are used to hang the seat on the wagon box. 
  
  Fic. 29. Sprinc Seat Hook. 
How to Make the Spring Seat Hook 
1. Drill the 44-inch hole 114 inch from one end. 
2. Mark on the edge of the iron, the location of A, B, C and 
D, Plate 12. 
3. Bend at A and B, in the vise or over the back or “‘heel’’ of 
the anvil. 
4. It is not likely that corners C and D can be bent in the 
vise or over the anvil. If not, clamp a square piece of iron, 
one inch or less in width, in the vise. Now bend the corners C 
and D about this piece. Fig. 29 is a picture of the completed 
spring seat hook. 
Notes.—In bending about a piece of iron in the vise you will 
have to hammer first on one side of a corner and then on the 
other until the corner is square. 
Reduce the 1-inch distance to 14 inch when the seat is to be 
used on a wagon box made of 1-inch surfaced boards. 
Be sure to turn flat iron over now and then while heating. 
Clean out the ashes and any clinkers in your forge occasionally, 
just as with a stove.

HASP 
The stock from which the Hose is made is known as ‘‘band 
iron.” The thickness is not measured in fractions of an inch, 
but is designated as “‘12-gage’’ or ‘‘14-gage,” etc. It can be 
secured in many different thicknesses. The width is measured 
in inches. 
How to Make the Hasp 
1. Locate, center-punch and drill three %¢-inch holes as 
indicated on drawing. 
2. Heat and cut out the stock between two of the holes with 
a hot chisel. Cut on the base of the horn of the anvil. Do not 
cut to the full 34-inch width. 
3. With a file smooth the sides of the slot. 
4, Heat and cut off the corners to the dimensions shown in 
the drawing. Then smooth the edges with a file. 
5. Heat and bend the point slightly as shown in the top 
view, Plate 13. Fig. 30 shows the completed hasp. 
Notes. —This hasp is of a size that can be used with the staples, 
Plate 2. 
- | ‘ 
The holes in the hasp may be punched, but on such thin stock 
as this better results are obtained by drilling. 
The cast iron swage block, Fig. 7, can frequently be used to 
advantage in shaping articles out of sheet or band iron.

STRAP BOLT 
Considerable care is necessary in shaping the threaded end of 
the strap bolt. The thin metal has a strong tendency to lap 
over on the edges when being hammered down to the 3¢-inch 
round. 
How to Make the Strap Bolt 
1. On one end hammer down about three 
‘inches of the stock until it is almost square. 
Hammer on four sides, when necessary, to prevent 
the edges from folding over. d 
2. Round the end just drawn out square so 
that it will be like the drawing, Plate 15. 
3. If the rounded part is less than 3¢ inch in 
diameter, upset as much as is necessary and round 
the end again. 
4. Drill three 14-inch holes as shown in Plate 
15 and Fig. 32. } 
5. Bend A in the vise or over the anvil.

Should the edges fold over when you are drawing the end 
round bring the iron to a welding heat (see Lap Weld, Plate 18, 
for welding) and hammer all around the end. 
The end of the round part must be absolutely round, or the 
die will fail to catch and will simply cut away the stock around 
the outside.

LAP WELD — 
There are a number of different types of welds used by black- 
smiths, but the lap weld, Fig. 37 and Plate 18, is the most com- 
mon. Try welding a ring, C, Plate 18, first, as that is the easiest 
object to weld. The scarfs can be bent to the position shown 
before actual welding is begun. 
How to Shape the Scarfs 
1. Upset both ends, see A, Plate 18. 
2. Hold the iron with a bolt tongs, and on the rounding edge 
of the anvil, shape the slope of the scarf. Hammer with a back- 
ward stroke, not straight down, Fig. 42.

  56 FARM BLACKSMITHING 
4. Bend the scarf over the horn of the anvil to make the slope 
slightly rounding, as shown in Fig. 43. The scarfs must be 
shaped with a convex curve if the weld is to be successful. 
5. The length of the scarf should seldom exceed one and 
one-half times the thickness or diameter of the iron. 
Always observe the following directions when welding: 
1. Use little draft in your fire. Heat the iron slowly and 
turn occasionally so that both sides rs reach the welding tem- 
perature at the same time. 
2. Have burning coke above, ie and to the sides of the 
iron while heating. 
3. The welding heat has been reached when the iron looks 
like melting ice, and appears to be melting on the surface. When 
tiny explosive sparks shoot off from t the iron is burning. It is 
not too late to weld the iron when the first sparks appear. 
4. Quickly remove the iron from the fire to the face of the 
anvil, place the two scarfs together and strike a couple of light 
blows on the weld, followed by several heavy blows. Strike the 
weld on both sides of the iron. | | 
5. Shape the welded part to con- 
form with the shape of the iron, and 
then shape the object, if that is neces- 
sary. |

Notes.—The scarfed ends are first upset to overcome the loss 
in size by frequent heating. The scale (oxide) which forms on 
the iron and drops off, materially reduces the size. 
The scarf is pointed, on round iron to make welding easier 
and to help prevent unsightly edges which are not wholly welded. 
The scarf is shaped curved so that the centers of the two 
scarfs will touch first in welding. and crowd out any scale that 
may be on the scarf. 
Always add a small amount of stock when a weld is to be made, 
to make up for the loss by scaling (oxidation).

Notes.—Have the method of shaping Fic. 44. 
the scarf and the proper procedure of HIAEGD [BLE Ehojeyi 
welding firmly in mind before you ri this piece of work. 
If you have trouble in making a weld stick use borax on it. 
Sprinkle some on the red hot scarfs, and then 1 bring the scarfs to 
a welding heat. The borax is called a ‘“‘flux.” It tends to pre- 
vent the iron from oxidizing (scaling). 
Clean white sand is sometimes used for a flux. 
Especially prepared welding compounds or fluxes can be pur- 
chased. Borax, however, will usually be found quite satisfactory 
for nearly all work.

  Notes.—You have probably noticed that iron at a welding 
heat is sticky or pasty. Therefore in shaping an object for 
welding be sure to have the cai or parts to be welded just 
where they should be. 
Welds on large iron can aati be made with one heat, due to 
the fact that a large piece of iron retains its heat longer. A cool 
or cold anvil will chill a small piece very quickly, and two or 
even three heats may be necessary to complete the weld.

7. Drill the hole, and make a rivet if you have none. 
8. Make the second half of the tongs and rivet the two to- 
gether. 
_ 9. Offset the handles a trifle just below the weld so that they 
will be opposite each other when the tongs are closed. 
10. Case harden the points. They cannot be hardened and 
‘tempered because wrought iron or mild steel has so little carbon 
in it. Heat a point bright red, sprinkle cyanide of potassium 
over it or rub with a lump held i in a tongs. When the iron has 
lost color reheat quickly and plunge into cold water. 
Note.— Cyanide of potassium is a dead ily poison. Do not let 
it touch an open wound, and do not inhale the fumes when 
sprinkling it on the iron. Wash your hands when you are 
finished. See page 89 for further information about case hard- 
ening. | |

IRON AND STEEL 
All commercial iron and steel contains carbon in varying 
amounts. Such characteristics as hardness, toughness and fusi- 
bility are determined by the amount of carbon contained in the 
iron. The kinds of iron and steel which the blacksmith most 
frequently comes in contact with are as follows: 
1. Mild steel—contains 1/10 per cent to 1/5 per cent of 
carbon 
2. Wrought iron—contains 1/25 of 1 per cent of carbon. 
3. Tool steel—contains 3/5 of 1 per cent to 2 per cent of 
carbon. 
4. Cast iron—contains 2 per cent to 6 per cent of carbon. 
The amount of carbon contained in the various kinds of iron 
and steel is used to help designate it. A ‘‘point” is 1/100 of 1 
per cent. Therefore, what is known as 20-point mild steel con- 
tains 1/5 of 1 per cent carbon. Again, a 150-point tool steel 
contains 114 per cent carbon. 
Mild Steel—Nearly all iron used today by blacksmiths is 
known as mild steel or blacksmith iron. It has almost sup- 
planted wrought iron. Mild steel contains considerably more 
carbon than wrought iron, but not enough to allow for hardening 
and tempering. Some of it will harden a trifle when heated and 
plunged into water, but it is not satisfactory for tools. Mild 
steel can be welded successfully, but not as readily as wrought 
iron. It is made by the Bessemer process which is the quickest 
and cheapest process used in iron making. Mild steel is made 
in rods, bars, bands and sheets and is sold by the pound. The 
shapes are known as rounds, squares and flats. 
Wrought Iron—Wrought iron is light gray or silver in color, 
and is fibrous or stringy. It can be bent, twisted and ham- 
mered cold more successfully than any other iron. After cold 
manipulation it can be returned to its original condition by 
annealing it. This is done by heating to a good red heat and 
allowing it to cool slowly without water. 
85
-P-A-G-E-86
  86 FARM BLACKSMITHING 
Wrought iron is easily forged when heated, and is the best kind 
of iron to use for welding. A very high grade known as “‘Nor- 
way” or “Swedish” iron is the best that can be purchased. It 
is higher in price, but of late is almost unobtainable. Mild steel 
or blacksmith iron has now practically taken the place of wrought 
iron, for all smithing purposes. Wrought iron is manufactured 
in round, square and flat rods. 
Tool Steel—Tool steel has enough carbon in it so that it can 
be hardened and tempered. In addition to having the correct 
shape a tool must have the proper degree of hardness for the use 
for which it is intended. Several different tools all tempered to a 
different degree of hardness may be made from the same bar of 
tool steel. The principal shapes in which tool steel is made are 
square, rectangular (flat) and octagonal bars. It is sold by the 
pound. 
When tools forged from tool steel crack, bend or are blunted, 
the steel should not necessarily be considered defective. The 
trouble can probably be traced to the workman who forged, 
hardened, and tempered the tools. 
Tool steel cannot be heated as highly for forging as wrought 
iron or mild steel It ‘“‘burns” at a glowing white heat and 
crumbles. It should be heated slowly, and frequently if neces- 
sary, to a good red heat—no higher—and forged. Use little 
draft and turn frequently. Do not upset tool steel any more 
than is absolutely necessary as cracks are likely to follow. A 
good tool steel is bluish gray in color. When possible, select 70 
to 90-point steel for making blacksmith tools. Also get it in the 
size and shape which is nearest the finished tool. 
Cast Iron—Cast iron cannot be forged. When heated to a 
bright red or yellow heat it crumbles. It is used for many 
“parts” on farm implements. Cast iron can be readily drilled 
and filed. It is usually gray in color, and cracks easily under a 
blow. A blacksmith does not come in contact with it as fre- 
quently as other kinds of iron.
-P-A-G-E-87
HARDENING AND TEMPERING 
Hardening is making the tool steel as hard as possible, and 
tempering is reducing the hardness to a certain definite de- 
sired degree. 
Hardening—Heat the tool steel to a blood red heat and plunge 
into clean, cool water. The addition of salt in the water has a 
tendency to make the hardness greater. The water should be 
kept cool by changing or adding, when numerous articles are 
hardened. The steel is now as hard as it can be made, and it 
cannot be filed. 
Tempering—After a piece of tool steel has been hardened, a cer- 
tain definite degree of hardness may be obtained by reheating 
it to a given temperature. The temperature is determined by 
the color on a polished surface of the tool. The use for which 
a tool is intended determines the degree to which it is to be 
tempered, and therefore the color to which it is to be heated. 
The first color to appear on the polished surface, when re- 
heating for tempering, is light straw. At this color the steel is 
tempered just a trifle. After light straw the colors appear in the 
following order: dark straw, brown, purple, dark blue and light 
blue. A light blue color indicates that the steel has been tem- 
pered to the softest point before it returns to its original con- 
dition. 
Many tools can be hardened and tempered in one heating. 
The cold chisel, Plate 27, is such a tool. 
Hardening and Tempering the Cold Chisel—First heat about 
2 inches or 214 inches of the cutting end to a blood red heat, 
using a slow fire with little draft. Plunge the point into cool 
water to a depth of about 1 inch. Move backward and for- 
ward, and wp and down slightly. This movement prevents the 
steel from hardening to a definite water line. Such hardening 
to a water line usually results in a break when the chisel is 
87
-P-A-G-E-88
  
88 _ FARM BLACKSMITHING 
struck. When the 1 inch or so of the point has been thoroly 
cooled, remove from the water and quickly polish with a piece 
of emery cloth, tacked on a stick. The heat remaining in the 
upper part of the chisel will now begin to run down into the 
cooled and hardened end, and the tempering will have begun. 
The colors will now appear. The first color to be noted on the 
cutting edge will be light straw. Above this will be dark straw, 
brown, purple, dark blue and light blue. The colors move down 
as the heat from above runs down. The light straw will dis- 
appear on the edge and the dark straw above it will take its 
place. Then the dark straw will disappear, and so on until the 
dark blue color reaches the cutting edge. The moment the edge 
is dark blue plunge into cool water. 
For general use a dark blue is the proper color to temper a cold 
chisel. A hard test is to hammer it straight into a piece of iron. 
If the edge does not bend or crack the tool will give good service. 
The center punch, Plate 27, is hardened and tempered in the 
same manner. 
Tools and Their Tempering Colors—The farm blacksmith has 
little call for tempering to any of the harder colors. Light and 
dark straw and brown are used principally on machinist’s tools 
and fine instruments. 
Brown—Used for ball pein and other heavy hammers. 
Purple—Used on center punches, stone drills, occasionally on 
cold chisels, and the faces of riveting hammers. 
Dark blue—Used on cold chisels, lever or wrecking bars, some 
knives, blacksmith’s cold chisels or cutters, hardies when used 
for cutting cold stock, and the pein of a riveting hammer. 
Light blue—Used on screwdrivers. 
Tools used for cutting or shaping hot stock, such as punches, 
hot chisels and hardies, do not require hardening and tempering. 
Annealing—Sometimes it is desirable or necessary to bring the 
steel back to its original condition. This is a softening process 
and is sometimes used after a tool has been forged, and before
-P-A-G-E-89
  
HARDENING AND TEMPERING 89 
it is hardened and tempered. One way to anneal is to heat the 
iron to a good red heat and bury it in dry lime or ashes and allow 
it to cool. A decidedly quicker method is to heat to a good red 
color and allow it to cool in the air until no heat color is visible 
when held in a dark corner of room. When this point is reached 
cool entirely by plunging into water. Annealing is done to 
eliminate any strains in the steel such as might be caused by 
hammering, bending or hardening. 
Case Hardening—Case hardening isa process of hardening the 
surface of wrought iron or mild steel, which cannot be hardened 
and tempered like tool steel. Where no special furnace and 
equipment is. available the method described under Ice Tongs 
may be used. Case hardening simply hardens a thin layer of the 
outside surface. By repeating the process several times the 
thickness of the hardened part may be materially increased. 
Pay especial attention to the ‘‘Notes,” Page 78, cautioning 
against poisoning from the cyanide of potassium and its fumes. 
It is a good plan for the farmer to save such bolts, nuts, rods, 
sheet iron, etc., which may come to hand in one way of another. 
Such things can sometimes be used as they are, or can easily 
be changed to a size or shape needed. A small supply of various 
sizes of screws, nails, bolts of various kinds, pipe, rivets and 
iron rods should be kept in the farm shop so that repairs and 
new work can proceed without the farmer first having to go to 
town for materials.

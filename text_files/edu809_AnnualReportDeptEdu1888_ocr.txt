REPORT. 
The accompanying statistics, when carefully compared with 
those of former years, will reveal the growth of public educa- 
tion in Tennessee. For, indeed, a school system is a growth, 
and, of necessity, must be a slow growth. But I do not hesi- 
tate to say that if the years from 1873 (the date when our 
present school laws went into effect) to 1888, inclusive, be com- 
pared with the same number of years in any other State in the 
Union greater progress cannot be shown than is manifest in 
these years. The average enrollment and the average daily 
attendance has increased nearly 100 per cent., and the same 
per cent. gain all along the line. In school-houses and school 
furniture the improvement is nearly 500 per cent. 
The length of the school term does not show such a marked 
increase, but when we consider the increased enrollment and 
average daily attendance, and the school term has made some 
gains, it is evident that the amount expended for school purposes 
has increased at about the same ratio. The outlook is very 
encouraging. 
I give the following summaries for the years 1888 and 1885. 
A comparison of these will show the improvements for’ the + 
last three years; but when the statistics of 1874 are compared 
with those of 1888 the improvement shown is simply marvel-

Scnoot Districts. 
In a great majority of the counties of the State the school 
district and the civil district are identical, and I have urged the 
County Courts, as far as practical, to make these districts cor- 
respond, 
Much trouble has arisen from the frequent changes in the 
school district lines in those counties where a departure has 
 
-P-A-G-E-16

been made from the general rule. The forming of one school 
district led to the formation of many, and in some counties there 
are eighty or more school districts when there should not be 
more than ten or twelve. 
Numper or Scuoots. 
Very great damage has been done by establishing too many 
schools. We have, in some counties, fully twice as many schools 
as we should have. j 
When these two defects in the management of our schools’ 
shall have been healed, the formation of new school distri¢ts, 
and the number of schools reduced to the minimum, a step for 
the accomplishment of better results will be achieved. 
GRADING THE County ScHooLs. 
In many counties a graded course of study has been adopted, 
and the teachers are rapidly learning how to use this to advan- 
tage—learning the advantages of a graded school over a class- 
ified school. 
Drrtoma. 
A common school diploma has been prepared, and is now 
ready for distribution. Many orders have been filled already, 
and many very encouraging letters have been received from 
those to whom diplomas have been sent. I take the liberty of 
quoting from a letter received from Superintendent J. H. Allen, 
of Shelbyville, Bedford County: 
“Your ‘diploma’ will meet with universal favor in this 
county. Quite a number of our schools wall take them up at 
once. This ‘diploma’ will have a wonderful influence in the 
direction of correct grading and better teaching. It is really 
the first definite objective point set up in the Public Schools of 
the State. 
« Respectfully, 
“J. H. ALLEN.”

Twenty-two State Normal Institutes were held during the 
year, the expenses of which were met by an appropriation from 
the Trustees of the Peabody Fund. For particulars of said 
Institutes, see copy of report made to the Trustees of the 
Peabody Education Fund herewith submitted 
These Normal Institutes have done much to improve the 
character of the work done by the teachers, hence a direct 
benefit to the children of the State.

as 
No further appropriation, in all probability, will be made to 
Tennessee by the Peabody Board for Institute purposes, unless 
the General Assembly shall make an appropriation for said 
purposes. 
I feel warranted in saying that if the General Assembly will 
make an appropriation of $1,000 for Institute purposes, the 
Peabody Board will also give to the State $1,000. I trust the 
importance of this work will be fully realized and the appro- 
priation made. {

Hon. J. L. M. Curry, Richmond, .Va.: 
Dear Str—I herewith transmit to you a report of the Pea- 
body Normal Institutes held in this State by the aid received 
from your honorable body. 
I was prevented by sickness from attending the Institutes, 
consequently must let you draw your conclusion as to what 
was done from the reports of those who were employed specially 
to represent me at said Institutes. However, I can say that the 
Institutes which have been held in the State for the past few 
years have done more good to arouse, public sentiment and im- 
prove the Public Schools than any other one agency. This is 
clearly seen by the organization of the school teachers and ~ 
school officers, and the monthly meetings held, the County In- ~ 
stitutes which are held from one to four weeks during the sum- 
mer months, and the increased tax levied by the County Courts 
for school purposes. ‘ 
The outlook in Tennessee is very encouraging. I began the 
work of the year with the determination, if possible, to organ- 
MeN. Peel
-P-A-G-E-19
posi (<a 
ize a Teachers’ Institute in each county in the State. The suc- 
cess was simply marvelous. Winety of the ninety-six counties 
responded to my calls and held successfu meetings. Several 
towns organized graded schools; excellent school houses have 
been built; and I repeat, more is due to this condition of affairs 
from the aid received from the Peabody Board than from any 
other source. I could not have done one-third the amount of 
work that I have done (for reasons which are not necessary 
to mention) had it not been for the substantial aid you have 
given me. 
Here let me suggest that if your honorable body can see your 
way clear to continue the appropriation for Institute purposes, 
it will enable my successor to continue the work; and the day 
is not far distant when an educated public sentiment will de- 
mand a liberal appropriation by the State for this office. 
I know it is the policy of your honorable body to help those 
who help themselves, but if the aid that has been given shall 
be withdrawn now I fear that the cause of public education 
will suffer.

REPORT OF PROF. C. 8. DOUGLAS. 
Hon. Frank M. Smith, Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn.: 
Duar Str—Having been appointed by you as one of the 
State representatives in the Institute work for June and July, 
I hereby respectfully submit the following as my report of the 
two Institutes of Pulaski and Doyle Station, the first beginning 
June 18th and continuing four days; the second, July 9th and 
closing 13th. 
The aggregate number of teachers attending these Institutes 
was ove hundred and eighty-five (185), both opening under 
most favorable circumstances and continuing until the close 
with unabated interest. The teachers from each county were 
out in full force, and some from adjoining towns, and all mani- 
fested a lively interest in the work, and seemed bent on culti- 
vating every opportunity to become more proficient in their pro- 
fession and better acquainted with the theory and practice of 
our modern system. 
A very instructive and practical program for each day was 
arranged, of just such work as is most essentially necessary 
toward rendering our teachers more competent and our public 
system more thorough. Again, in addition to the actual dem- 
onstrations upon the board, wherein the safest, nearest, and 
most concise methods, with the principles involved, were fully 
delineated, at the end of each exercise we endeavored to im- 
press and ground them in the work by discussions, which was 
free to all, and in which, I'am glad to say, most of the teachers 
participated. 
Each of the sessions, morning and evening, lasted four hours, 
and the nights were devoted to educational addresses by those 
of large experience and prepared for the occasion, and these 
were interspersed with recitations and music, instrumental and 
vocal, our object being to entertain as well as to instruct, there- 
by rendering our Institutes attractive and inviting, and hence a 
place of enjoyment for the people as well as the teachers.

At Pulaski there were associated with me Professors Myn- 
ders, of the Hartsville Masonic Institute, and Lampson, of the 
State Normal, both of whom are well versed in the work, and 
always ready and willing for duty when and wherever needed. 
I must say that they did their work well, and spared neither 
effort nor exertion to secure a success. 
Prof. Goodman, of the Business College, and Capt. Garrett, of 
Montgomery Bell, were with us two days each, and assisted us 
materially in the execution of our plans, both being experts in 
their special spheres. Superintendent Zuccarello was at his 
post, and discharged every duty with energy, and to him are 
we indebted principally for the interest worked up among the 
teachers. There are many others who did good work, but time 
_and space will not allow special mention. 
Col. Solon E. Rose, Senator Ewing, Capt. Garrett, and Gen. 
McCord entertained the audiences at night during the meeting, 
and quite an interest did their efforts lend to our week’s work. 
Of the Doyle Institute, Iam free to confess that I have never 
attended a meeting in which the people, as well as the teachers, 
seemed more thoroughly alive to the aims and purposes of the 
Institute work. 
On my arrival I was rejoiced to find that splendid and untir- 
ing worker, Prof. T. C. Karns, of the State University, on 
hand, in fine spirits, well equipped, and putting in his best ef- 
forts toward the accomplishment of good results. He, with the 
assistance of Superintendent Billingsley, that live and energetic 
teacher who, as a superintendent, has no superior, had already 
organized a force of one hundred and ten (110) teachers, and 
were hard at work. Nearly eleven hours each day of practical 
school work and discipline were put in, involving nearly every 
question and problem liable to arise in the every-day exercises 
of the school room. The entire curriculum of the public sys- 
tem was taken up during the week, and well handled by expe- 
rienced educators, and I speak but a truth when I assert that 
there was not a teacher present, old or young, that was not ma~
-P-A-G-E-24
gatos aise 
terially benefited by the Institute. There were present at least 
thirty ready and competent teachers, prepared to do whatever 
was asked of them, and by their willingness manifested a great 
desire to become more thorough in their professions. 
Profs. Dodson, Bryan, Huff, and many others, too numerous 
to mention, were present, and added much to the interest of 
the occasion. 
The large and commodious college building was filled day 
and night by an attentive and intelligent audience, which 
seemed to inspire the teachers with renewed energy, and per- 
suade them that the people fully appreciated and endorsed 
them in their progressive march toward a higher and purer de- 
velopment. 
In conclusion, you will permit me to say that many kind and 
complimentary allusions were made of our efficient State Su- 
perintendent, who has worked so faithfully and laboriously to 
organize and maintain these Institutes, which I think should 
be carefully fostered and protected as the best aid and incentive 
to the perfection of the Public School System. I would fur- 
ther add that I am satisfied that you have the hearty endorse- 
ment of all of the best educators of the State in this grand and 
glorious work, and trust that you will continue to go forward 
in the consummation of your plans until the Old Volunteer 
State shall be classed as the equal, if not the peer, of any of 
her more fortunate sisters. Respectfully, 
C. 8. Dovenas, 
Representing State in Institute Work.

  REPORT OF PROF. S. A. MYNDERS. 
Harrsvitiy, Trny., August 21, 1888, 
Hon. Frank M. Smith, Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn. : 
Dear Srr—I have the honor to submit the following report 
of the State Normal Institutes held by me during the summer 
of 1888: ‘ 
At Pulaski, Giles County, beginning June 18th, and continu- 
ing one week, I was associated with Capt. C. 8. Douglas and 
Prof. John L. Lampson, as representatives of the State. 
The Institute was under the supervision of Superintendent J. 
J. Zucearello, to whose earnest work the success is largely due. 
About eighty teachers attended, and we were favored with a 
good audience of citizens at each meeting. I gave daily in- 
struction in primary reading, spelling, and language, using 
about the same methods as in our former Institute work. The 
excellent work of Capt. Douglas and Prof. Lampson, in other 
departments, made the Institute interesting and instructive. 
In Carthage, Smith County, we opened on June 25th, and 
continued one week. We enrolled about seventy teachers, and 
had a very large attendance of citizens. Superintendent Crutch- 
field had done good work in making arrangements for the 
Institute. We found him an earnest and efficient County Su- 
-perintendent. Prof. Gold, of Gordonsville, J. G. Brown, of 
Carthage, Prof. Harris, of Hickman, Miss Ida Hale, of Car- 
thage, and Prof. Mullins rendered valuable assistance. During 
the day sessions I gave instruction’ on teaching the common 
school branches, and lectured on educational topics at night.. 
At the close of the Institute strong resolutions were adopted 
by teachers and citizens endorsing the State Superintendent in 
his Institute work, and urging an appropriation by the Legis- 
lature for carrying on the work. Our Institutes are doing great 
good in strengthening and improving our Public School Sys- 
tem, and our people are beginning to realize the fact. I have 
not found a man who has attended one of the Institutes but:
-P-A-G-E-26
    Cena ees 
what favored an appropriation by the Legislature for Insti- 
tutes. 
In all my Institute work I have been as practicable as pos- 
sible. I paid attention to the organization and grading of the 
district schools, and advanced and urged only such methods as 
I thought could be profitably used in country schools. 
As your representative I was the recipient of every possible 
courtesy and attention. 
I inclose a copy of the resolutions adopted at Carthage. 
Respectfully submitted, 
8. A. Mynpers. 
REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON RESOLUTIONS. 
We congratulate the teachers of Smith County upon the suc- 
cessful Institute which is now about to close, feeling that here 
we have received an amount of instruction never before at- 
tained in the same length of time, and that the good results of 
this session upon the educational interests of Smith County are 
beyond computation; that we have had impressed upon us a 
deeper sense of responsibilities of our calling and of its dig- 
nified and exalted nature; that we have had pointed out to us, 
in a kind way, the errors of our past career as teachers, and 
have made resolves to correct them; that we have had shown 
to us ‘“‘a more excellent way” and better methods of teaching, 
by which we profit; that we have had our hopes inspired, our 
faith in our noble calling renewed, and our energy and de- 
termination for future work greatly strengthened; therefore, 
Resolved, That we most heartily endorse the course of our 
worthy State Superintendent in his work, and especially in 
holding Institutes in the various counties, thereby giving an 
impetus to the cause of education and new inspiration to the 
teachers of the State. 
 
-P-A-G-E-27
a 
  Resolved, That, as Teachers’ Institutes, properly conducted, 
are powerful promoters of the cause of education, we here ex- 
press our desire that the next Legislature make a reasonable 
appropriation for holding Institutes in every county in the State. 
Resolved, That the thanks of this body be tendered to Prof. 
§. A. Mynders for the very entertaining and instructive lectures 
he has given us on almost every educational subject, and we 
also tender our thanks to the State Superintendent for sending 
us so able a representative. 
Resolved, That we award the utmost praise and credit to our 
County Superintendent, Dr. Crutchfield, for the impartial, cour- 
teous, and skillful manner in which, as presiding officer, he has 
conducted this Institute. 
Resolved, That our thanks are due to the people of Carthage 
for their kindness and the friendly interest taken in the pro- 
ceedings and members of this Institute. 
Resolved, That we congratulate the young lady performers 
upon the excellence of the music with which they have favored 
us, and to them, together with the other members of the choir, 
and also to the young people for their entertaining recitations, 
we extend our heartfelt thanks. 
Resolved, That we expresss our gratitude to the Baptist — 
Church of Carthage for the use of their house of worship, in 
which we have been permitted so comfortably to hold the meet- 
ings of the Institute.

REPORT OF PROF. B. A. J. NIXON. 
SHELBYVILLE, TuNnN., September 8, 1888. 
Hon. Frank M. Smith, Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn.: 
Dear Str—TI began an Institute at Murfreesboro, Tenn., June 
25th, and continued a week. I was ably assisted by Mr. Nelson, 
the County Superintendent, and Profs. Carney and Trimble. 
There were nearly a hundred teachers in attendance. [am glad to — 
report to you that the Institue work is growing more and more 
in favor with the people. Each night during the week of the 
Institute educational meetings were held. These meetings were 
largely attended. I sent you a fuller report than this. My ex- 
penses were $9.75. I cannot give items now. I sent them. 
Yours, ete.,

Hon. Frank M. Smith, Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn. : 
Dear Sir—The following is a report of the Normal and In- 
stitute work done in this county this year. There was a three 
months’ (January, February, and March) Normal held at Rock- 
wood under the supervision of Prof. M. L. Morrison. The 
work done in this was very satisfactory, the teachers who at- 
tended being greatly benefited. There were two other Normal 
Classes in this county during the winter and spring—one at 
Kingston, taught by Prof. John W. Crowder; the other at 
Roane College, taught by President Geo. W. Butler. The ob- 
ject of these Normals was to give the teachers a thorough 
knowledge of what they would be expected to teach in the 
Public Schools. Many of the teachers have expressed them- 
selves as to this work, and say that it was of inestimable value 
to them. s

REPORT OF INSTITUTE. 
Then we held two Institutes in June and July of a week 
each—one for the white teachers and one for the colored. In 
these Institutes the time was taken up in lectures and discus- 
sions on theory and practice of teaching. Prof. 8. F. Braiding, 
a man who has for some years made pedagogy a specialty, gave 
a series of lectures on ‘School Discipline,” “How to Teach 
Reading,” and “How to Teach Geography.” These lectures 
were very instructive. Mrs. McClure, of Indiana, lectured on 
“How to Teach Numbers, Language, and How to Treat Be- 
ginners.” The methods set forth by her were “the latest and 
pest.” In addition to these two teachers, from Ohio and In- 
diana, we had lectures by President Butler, of Roane College; 
Henry R. Gibson, of Knoxville; J. C. Pope, of Kingston; and 
Profs. R. C. Maury, M. L. Morrison, J. H. Frith, Jno. W. Crow- 
der, and others. 
The enrollment at white Institute was seventy-six; colored, 
ten. Very respectfully,

County Superintendent.

Dear Srr—I hereby forward my report of Institute work 
last summer. 
By request of Superintendent H. D. Huffaker I was selected 
to represent the State in the State Normal for colored teachers, 
held in Chattanooga, June 25-29, 1888. 
There were forty-three teachers enrolled, about eighteen of 
whom are now teaching in Hamilton County. Although the 
weather was rainy the majority of the teachers were prompt

BEBO 
The first week Prof. W. J. Grannis, of the Preparatory De- 
partment of Cumberland University, lectured upon Arithmetic ; 
Prof. H. L. W. Gross, of the Masonic Normal Institute, Alex- 
andria, English Grammar; Miss Maud Copeland, of the Graded 
School, Hernando, Miss., Orthography and Reading; Miss 
Chloe Dement, of the Peabody Normal School, Nashville, Ge- 
ography and U.S. History; and Prof. C. L. Hayes, Physiology. 
Besides the regular work lectures on vocal music were given 
twice a day by the well-known professional vocalist, Mr. F. 
Cochrane. Critics reported publicly at stated periods the errors 
of the various instructors. Querries upon professional questions 
were freely discussed daily. 
The exercises the second week varied from those of the first 
in few respects, save the following: Prof. Gross being called 
away we had the pleasure of listening to some very interesting 
addresses by your friend, Prof. 8. A. Mynders, of Hartsville. 
His work upon “How to Grade the Public Schools” and “ How 
to Control Bad Boys” was particularly enjoyed. Mr. Hayes 
lectured upon Geology of ‘Tennessee instead of Physiology. 
Owing to several reasons our attendance this year was not so 
good as it has been at other times, but were enough to make it 
a financial success. Our enrollment, including representatives 
from five counties, was something between seventy-five and one 
hundred. The interest from the beginning was excellent, and 
remained so throughout. 
The Colored Institute, held at the same time and in connee- 
tion with the one above, was a decided success. They were 
under the management of the same committee referred to 
above, while they were taught by Mrs. Saline Gale Rivers, of 
Roger Williams University, Nashville. 
Hope you will consent to give us a State Institute here next 
year, and be with us in person. 
Very truly yours, etc., 
C. L. Hayns.

REPORT OF PROF. CHARLES MASON. 
JonusBoro, TENN., September 22, 18 8. 
Hon. Frank M. Smith, Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn.: 
Dzar Str—In accordance with your instructions a synopsis 
of Institutes held during June and July, 1888, is respectfully 
submitted : 
Institute held at Dandridge, Jefferson County, Tenn., under 
the supervision of Capt. G. W. Holtsinger, June 18th to June 
22d, inclusive; number of teachers enrolled, forty; visitors, 
twenty to twenty-five daily. 
Prof. J. M. Bryan was appointed Secretary, to whom we are 
under obligations for an accurate minute of the weeks’ work. 
Assisted by W. K. Gardner, of White Pine, Tenn. (report 
inclosed), Normal opened Monday at 10 a. M., with an attentive 
audience of teachers. Superintendent Holtsinger acted as 
chairman throughout the meeting. Prof. Gardner presented 
primary instruction, history, and arithmetic during the session 
in an entertaining and instructive manner. Geography, lan- 
guage, and school government outlined by myself, 
Our mecting was full of interest from the beginning, all 
teachers participating in the discussion of subjects before the 
body. 
Two lectures were delivered, one by Prof. J. T. Henderson, 
of Mossy Creek—Woman;” the other by Prof. Gardner— 
“Tntellectual Culture *—to an attentive and appreciative audi- 
ence. 
Through the efforts of Superintendent Holtsinger we were 
furnished an abundance of most excellent vocal and instru- 
mental music that enlivened the whole proceedings.
-P-A-G-E-33
  Ee ee 
  Our suecess—such it was—if enthusiasm among the teachers ~ 
and visitors can be counted as a vital element, is due to the 
valuable assistance and hearty co-operation rendered by the 
teachers of Jefferson, together with the friends of education in 
Dandridge. 
Language was taught upon a language basis, beginning with 
the vocabulary each pupil has upon entering the school room. 
Geography in the same way, starting from the child’s home 
and enlarging the boundaries of geographical vision until the - 
whole world is comprehended. 
We owe our thanks to many citizens of Dandridge for favors 
extended in every way to assist in the cause of education. Capt. 
Holtsinger, County Superintendent, had every thing prepared 
for an interesting meeting, and the only regret expressed by 
the teachers was that the time was too short. 
July 2, 1888, Institute met in the Baptist Church at Sevier- 
ville. The house was called to order at 8:30 a. M. by Superin- 
tendent Sharp, who stated the object of the meeting and insisted 
on every teacher in the Normal giving his undivided attention 
to the work during lecture hours. Prof. J. R. Rauhutf was 
elected Secretary. Owing to the serious illness of Superin- 
tendent Cox, of Hamblen County, the services of Prof. 
DeArmond, of the Knoxville schools, were secured to assist in 
the work of conducting the Normal. Because of the intense 
hot weather it was unanimously agreed upon that there should 
be only one week of the Normal, and only one session per day, 
beginning at 8 A. M. and closing at 12 mM. 
Prof. DeArmond presented the subjects of geography, 
school government, reading, writing, and orthography; arith- 
metic, language, history, and geology by Charles Mason; agri- 
culture by Prof. Rauhuff. 
The teachers certainly followed the instructions given by Su- 
perintendent Sharp, and gave their whole attention to whatever 
subject was under discussion. Our main effort was to give the
-P-A-G-E-34
  Bh 
teachers food for thought, that they might present the studies 
of the school room, not to learn text-books, but for mental de- 
velopment. As at Sevierville, the starting point was at home 
with the pupil’s surroundings, “from the known to the un- 
known” in every branch of study. Our meeting was a grand 
success from beginning to adjournment. Enthusiasm for the 
work was infused into every subject. Number of teachers pres- 
ent 107; visitors in daily attendance. 
The kind reception given to us, and the many courtesies 
extended, both at Dandridge and Sevierville, show the high 
appreciation in which the cause of education is held by the 
people. : Very respectfully, 
Cras. Mason. 
PAPERS OF PROF. GARDNER. 
SEVIERVILLE, TENN., July 2, 1888. 
Hon. Frank M. Smith, Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn.: 
Dear Srr—Quite a number of. teachers, together with many 
friends of education, met at the Baptist Church in Sevierville 
pursuant to a circular issued by Frank M. Smith, State Super- 
intendent of Public Instruction. The house was called to order 
at 8:30 by Superintendent Sharp. 
Mr. W. M. Johnson led the congregation in singing No. 304, . 
Gospel Hymns, and devotional exercises by Prof. Mason. Super- : 
intendent Sharp then stated the object of the meeting, and insisted 
on eyery teacher of the Normal giving his undivided attention to 
the work done during lecture hours. He also stated that he 
had secured the services of Professors Mason and Cox, but that 
Prof. Cox could not be present. Prof. Mason took charge of — 
the school and appointed Superintendent Sharp Chairman. On 
motion of Prof. DeArmond, J. R. Rauhuff was unanimously 
elected Secretary, amd, on motion of J. R. Rauhutl, J. H. Ellis 
was elected critic without a dissenting voice. Prof. Mason said

  the way the teachers took their seats in the rear of the room 
very forcibly reminded him of “first day in school,” and asked 
the teachers to please come forward and occupy the front seats. 
After they had responded he, in a very eloquent manner, proved 
to the teachers and visiting friends of education that he was 
the right man in the right place, and that teaching was not a 
recreation, but that it was both physical and mental labor, the 
results of which may only be realized in days to come. 
Prof. DeArmond was employed to do the work assigned Prof. 
Cox. Owing to the intense hot weather it was unanimously 
agreed upon that there should be only one week of the Normal, 
and only one session per day, beginning at 8 a. m. and closing 
at 12 M. 
The school then adjourned to Tuesday at 8 A. M. 
SECOND DAY. 
House was called to order promptly at 8 a.m. Music—Miss 
Nan Atchley at the organ. The school then recited the Lord’s 
Prayer in concert. Prof. Mason took charge of the work, in- 
troducing numbers, showing in a masterly manner some of the 
many methods employed in teaching a child numbers. 
The work was further continued by Prof. DeArmond, who 
introduced the subject, explained when, where, and how geog- 
raphy should be taught, and insisted upon teachers teaching 
the subject practically, and not requiring the pupils to memo- 
rize day definitions. 
Prof. Mason then took up language and discussed it in a 
philosophical manner; showed how retentive the juvenile mind 
is, and how very important it is that the mother, the first and 
best teacher, should use the very best language before her child, 
never indulging in slang phrases. He explained the difference 
between grammar and language. The former for advanced 
pupils, the latter for children. School then adjourned to meet 
Wednesday at 8 a. M, :

THIRD DAY. 
School met and house called to order at 8 4.m. Music—Miss 
Nan Atchley at the organ. School recited Lord’s Prayer in 
coneert. School government was opened and discussed by 
’ Prof. DeArmond, who, in a very able discourse, explained the 
necessity of disciplin®, and that order is very essential in mold- 
ing character, the results of good government being the instill- 
ing of good principles in a child to that degree that the child 
can govern himself. s 
The exercises were continued by Prof. Mason, who intro- 
duced arithmetic, gave his methods of teaching said branch of 
study, and insisted that more mental and less mechanical work 
should be done, the proper results of which are correct precep- 
tion, repetition, practice, and attention, these being mental dis- 
cipline; and accuracy, expertness, and rapidity, these being 
requisite to business life. Prof. DeArmond gave a very in- 
structive talk on how to teach spelling, 
Prof. Mason also gave a very interesting and instructive lect- 
ure on geology, and school adjourned to meet Thursday at the 
usual hour. 
FOURTH DAY. 
School met pursuant to adjournment, and opened in the usual 
manner by singing and prayer in concert. Grammar was 
opened and discussed very logically by Prof. Mason, who, in his 
closing remarks, asserted that any one could teach grammar, 
but it took a teacher to teach language, the avenue to grammar. 
After the exercises in grammar Prof. DeArmond heard the 
teachers read from the N. Y.8. J. Teacher’s Institute. Prof. 
Mason wanted to know something of the history of Sevier 
County. Several teachers gave some interesting history of our 
county from its laying out as a county in 1785 (2) to the present. 
Something of its government, of its most noted men, and the 
particulars of the fire which destroyed Sevierville in March, 
1856. School adjourned to meet Friday at 8 o’clock.

  LAST DAY. 
School met and house called to order promptly at 8 A. M. 
Music and devotional exercises by Prof. Mason. By request of 
Prof. Mason J. R. Rauhuff took up the subject of agriculture 
and spoke for quite a while on the development of scientific ag- 
riculture, the origin, composition, and classification of the va- 
rious soils, the composition of plants, composition and proper- 
ties of the atmosphere, and the general source of plant food, 
and how obtained. Also his methods of teaching agriculture, 
and several questions pertaining to the subject. Then, after 
Prof. Mason had made some splendid remarks on school gov- 
ernment, Prof. DeArmond exhibited a relief map of South 
America, asking several questions upon the same. These ex- 
ercises were interesting and instructive. 
Grammar was again taken up by Prof. Mason, who, in a 
masterly manner, handled the subject as if he were complete 
master of it. Quite a discussion arose among the teachers. 
Prof. DeArmond closed the work of the Normal by requiring 
a specimen of handwriting of all the teachers present. Num- 
ber of teachers enrolled, 107. Number of teachers examined, 
68. School adjourned Friday, July 6th, at 12 m.

INSTITUTE PROCEEDINGS. 
Arithmetic_—Shortly after organization a brief lesson in addi- 
tion was conducted. Tuesday’s lesson was a continuation of 
this subject, and. comprehended the adding of denominate num- 
bers, fractions, and United States money. On Wednesday per- 
centage was taken up and thoroughly discussed. Thursday 
and Friday were given to its applications. Many related sub- 
jects, such as interest, discount, taxes, profit and loss, etc., were 
treated in connection with percentage. Quite a degree of in- 
terest was manifested in this. branch, which indicates thorough 
work on the part of the teachers.

Primary Instruction.—During each day forty minutes were 
given to the discussion of various methods of imparting primary 
instruction. Preference was given to the word and object 
methods, though others were used by some teachers. The use 
of charts was strongly advocated, and all agreed that much de- 
pends upon the manner in which a child is started in school. 
United States History.— Although this branch is generally 
conceded as being very difficult to teach, yet the lessons during 
the Institute were interesting and full of life. Monday was 
given to discoveries and explorations of Spanish, French, 
English, and Dutch. The colonization of America was dis- 
cussed on Tuesday. On Wednesday the four intercolonial wars 
were the leading topics. The causes and results were discussed 
quite fully. Thursday and Friday were spent in naming the 
Presidents, giving their party, date of terms, and important 
events of their administrations. An interesting history of 
Dandridge was written. Biographies of leading men were 
written, chief among whom were David Crocket, Motley, J. L. 
Rogers, D. H. Meek, and Phil. Sheridan. Visitors also assisted 
in the discussions. W. K. Garpner.

Hon. Frank M. Smith, Superintendent of Public Tnstruction, 
Nashville, Tenn.: 
Dear Str—According to your instructions, on the 16th of 
July I organized a Normal Institute at Maynardsville, Union 
County, Tenn. Twenty-two teachers in attendance. I con-- 
ducted the Institute on the same general plan that has been 
adopted in Knox County. Found the teachers up in general 
knowledge of the text-books, but deficient in the art of teach- 
ing. They have not studied with sufficient care the natural 
order of mental development. They need training. It would 
be economy in the great State of Tennessee to send expert
-P-A-G-E-39
  “— 38 — 
   teachers among those mountain people as often as possible. 
You will always find among those people some very sharp men, 
and all they need in order to make them equal to the best is op- 
portunity. Of course they are much behind in school buildings, 
furniture, etc., but, in several respects, the Institute work at 
Maynardsville would compare favorably with Knox County 
Institutes. Yours truly, 
R. P. Rupper.

Hon. Frank M. Smith, men oaiiendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn.: 
Dear Sir—Our State and County Normal Institute opened 
June 25,1888. The State was to have been represented by Prof. 
Price Thomas, but he failed to appear, and Superintendent J. 
W. Hyden and Prof. G. W. Fox represented the State. Quite a 
number of teachers were present from the counties of Loudon, 
Monroe, Roane, and McMinn. The enrollment for the State 
week was about forty. Prof. J. C. Wright, of Grant Memorial 
University, delivered a leeture on Popular Education on Thurs- 
day evening of the State week, which was highly entertaining 
and well received by all. Many were sadly disappointed when 
State Superintendent Smith failed to reach the Institute, but 
Superintendent Hyden explained to the Institute that State 
Superintendent Smith was absent on account of sickness, which 
seemed to satisfy all. 
- Taking every thing into consideration, we consider the State 
Tnstitute a success. The County Normal was in session for 
three weeks. It was conducted by Superintendent Hyden and 
Prof. J. P. Grittitts, of Loudon College. The Institnte was not 
Jargely attended, but the interest was good. At the close of 
the Normal Institute the teachers gave a public entertainment, 
which was favorably spoken of.

Great praise is due Prof. Griffitts for his splendid work in 
the County Normal. <All the teachers went away from ‘the In- 
stitute enthused, and will doubtless do good work. nen

County Superintendent. 
REPORT OF PROF, L. SANDERS. 
Purpy, Tenn., September 1, 1888. 
Hon. Frank M. Smith, Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn.: i 
Dear Str—I submit herewith the following brief report of 
the State Normal Institute held at Purdy, McNairy County, 
beginning June 25th and continuing five days: 
The Institute was held in Chapel Hall of Purdy College, 
_which was kindly tendered by Prof. M. R. Abernathy. The 
Institute was called to order by County Superintendent Sanders, 
and Prof. Abernathy, representing the State, requested to sug- 
gest the order of the exercises during the week. Miss Mattie 
Haynes, of Chuvalla, McNairy County, was appointed Secretary. 
Thirty teachers reported first day. The number increased from 
day to day until about two-thirds of the teachers of the county 
had been enrolled. The attendance from adjoining counties 
was small. 
The attendance of “ outsiders’? was good each day, and very 
great interest manifested in the lectures and special exercises by 
the pupils of Purdy Male and Female Institute, which Prof. 
Abernathy had arranged to distribute throughout the week’s 
work. ; 
Prof. W. B. Romine, of “ Robertson High School for Boys,” 
Columbia, Tenn., delivered two lectures each day during the 
week. His subjects were “ English” and “ Arithmetic.” 
Prof. Abernathy lectured’ on U. 8. History, Geography, and   
-P-A-G-E-41
eA es 
Primary Methods, giving one talk on “ How to Become an Elo- 
cutionist,” and one on “School Management.’ His lectures on 
the study of history were copiously illustrated by charts pre- 
pared by the students of his school—Purdy Male and Female 
Institute. 
The work of the Institute was very satisfactory, both to 
teachers and visitors, and no doubt impressed all that the Insti- 
tute is indispensable, and that it should continue a month rather’ 
than a week. ;

REPORT OF PROF. A. J. STEELE. 
Mempuis, Tunn., June 16, 1888. 
Dr. W. L. Henderson, Superintendent Schools, Shelby County, 
Tenn. : 
Duar Sir—In compliance with your instructions I have the 
honor to submit the following formal report of the Institute- 
for colored teachers held under my supervision June 4-9: 
As you directed, teachers of the county were notified in May~ 
of the purpose to hold a weck’s Institute. The notice was. 
gladly received by all teachers, and our enrollment numbered 
fully 120 teachers of this and adjoining counties. The attend-. 
ance throughout was prompt and regular, and the interest man- 
ifested was excellent. The different branches taught in the 
public schools were reviewed both as to facts and as to methods. 
of instruction, so far as could be done in the limited time we 
had in which to work. I wish to acknowledge the able assist- 
ance given in the instruction of the Institute by Rev. B. A. 
Imes in Reading and Orthography, by Miss E. A. Barnes in U. 
8S. History and Grammar, and by Miss R. E. Stinson in 
Geography and Physiology, the latter subject being presented 
 
-P-A-G-E-42
eae 
with special reference to the effects of aleohol upon the human 
system. 
I would also acknowledge my obligation to yourself for constant 
attendance upon the sessions of the Institute, and for such sup- 
port and assistance as only the Superintendent can give in such 
work. In conclusion I would congratulate you and the county 
upon the permanent and sure basis upon which the Institute 
work for the teachers of Shelby County seems to have been 
placed by your determined efforts. Few teachers in the county 
‘but fully approve and highly prize a work of such benefit to 
the schools and so great advantage to themselves. 
It was my pleasure to be able to place at the disposal of the 
Institute for the occasion the building, apparatus, and the 
library, to some extent, of this institution. I trust that your 
further efforts to render more thorough and efficient the in- 
struction of the youth of the county may continue to succeed 
for the future as in the past. Sincerely, etc., 
A. J. STEELE, 
Institute Conductor. 
P. S.—I add this postscript to acknowledge and commend the 
valuable assistance rendered myself and the Institute by Miss 
M. A. Henderson in keeping the record of attendance and the 
address rolls, etc., of the Institute of this year.

REPORT OF PROF. T, C. KARNS. 
Hon. Frank M. Smith, Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn.: 
Dear Str—With regard to work in the Tennessee State In- 
stitutes for the summer of 1888 I beg leave to report as fol- 
lows: 
I held five Institutes. The first was at Bartlett, in Shelby 
County, beginning June 18th and closing June 22d. The
-P-A-G-E-43
  eae oS 
County Superintendent, Dr. W. lL. Henderson, presided. The 
instructors, besides myself, were Dr. Henderson; Principal 
John Newhardt and Prof. George Newhardt, bothZof Bartlett 
Normal School; Superintendent T. B. Winston, Holly}Springs, 
Miss.; B. T. Reaves, Woodstock, and Mrs. L. R. Milton and 
Mrs. Carrie VanHorn, of Memphis. Methods and, to a limited 
extent, subject-matter of the common school branches were 
taught. Hon. Luke Findley delivered a popular lecture on ed- 
ucation on the evening of the 22d. The number of teachers in 
attendance was fifty-nine, which was good. The estimated 
number of visitors was one hundred and fifty. It was a notice- 
able fact that nearly all the teachers present were females. 
The second Institute was held at Trenton, in Gibson County, 
beginning June 25th and closing June 29th. The County Su- 
perintendent, Prof. J. C. Wright, presided. The instructors 
who assisted me were Prof. G. R. McGhee, of Trenton; Prof. 
C. T. Kellogg, of Milan; Prof. W. A. Hess, of Humboldt ; 
Rev. J. L. Dickens, President of Bethel College at McKenzie ; 
Mr. J. L. Grayson, of Eaton; Miss Maud Ivie, of Trenton, 
and Superintendent Wright. The work was confined almost 
exclusively to best methods of instruction. Forty-four teach- 
ers were in attendance. The number of visitors was perhaps 
_ fifty. Those appointed to deliver popular addresses failed to 
attend. The local and general interest was only moderate. 
The third Institute was held at Sale Creek, in Hamilton 
County, beginning July 2d and ending July 6th. County Su- 
perintendent H. D. Hufiaker presided. The assisting instruct- 
ors were Superintendent OC. D. Arnold, of the Cleveland. 
Schools; Superintendent W. N. Billingsley, of White County ; 
P. A. Wall, Soddy; M. V. Beene, Sale Creek; Walter Q. 
Gregg, Chattanooga, and H. CO. Hartman, Soddy. Both meth~ 
ods and subject-matter of text-books were taught. Rev. James 
E. Rogers, President of Maryville College, gave a most instruct- 
ive evening lecture on Persia, where he had been a missionary. 
Prof. Walter Q. Gregg also lectured at night on his travels in 
South America, and Prof. J. R. Lowry on education. Miss 
Lassie Munsey, Mrs. J. R. Lowry, and Miss Lou Fleming as-
-P-A-G-E-44
age     
sisted with professional readings. The number of teachers 
present was forty-five; the estimated number of citizens two 
hundred and fifty. The evening exercises were especially suc- 
cessful. 
The fourth Institute was held by Capt. C. S. Douglas, Su- 
perintendent of the Gallatin Schools, and myself, at Doyle Sta; 
tion, White County, beginning July ‘9th and ending July 12th. 
Gaunty Superintendent W.N. Billingsley presided. We were 
assisted in lectures by Superintendent Billingsley; President 
J. W. Bryan, of Doyle College; 8. S. Cashdollar, of Darkey 
Springs; Rev. Wm. Houston, Peeled Chestnut; Prof. J. N. 
Hutf, of Doyle College; J. E. Nowlin, Sparta; R. L. Jones, 
Peeled Chestnut; F. M. Grissom, Pollard; J. M. Lewis, Cave; 
J.M. Johnson, Darkey Springs; Prof. P. W. Dodson, Sparta; 
D.S. Pope, Onward. Popular lectures were delivered at night 
by Capt. C. S. Douglas, President J: W. Bryan, D.8. Pope, 8.8. 
Cashdollar, Maj. G. W. Smith, and T. C. Karns. Miss Alice 
Hill conducted the music, assisted by her class. The Onward 
Band, led by Miss Minnie Moyers, also furnished excellent 
music. Various parties, too numerous to mention, assisted with 
recitations, essays, music, etc. ‘The number of teachers present 
was one hundred and twelve. The number of visitors probably 
reached four hundred. The Institute was a most successful 
one. The interest was great from the start. Citizens came 
from all the surrounding country. The great success was due 
mainly to the untiring industry and good management of Su- 
perintendent Billingsley. Friday was devoted to examinations. 
The fifth Institute was held at Elizabethton, Carter County, 
by Superintendent Charles Mason, of the Jonesboro Schools, 
and myself, beginning July 30th and ending August Ist. County 
Superintendent T. F. M. Smoot presided. The assistant in- 
structors were Prof. J. T. Henderson, of Carson College; Supt. 
J. R. Cox, of Hamblen County; Principal E. B. Waller, Eliza- 
bethton; Prof. J. H. Smith, of Butler; C. G. Price and R. F. 
King. Methods were discussed almost exclusively. The num- 
ber of teachers and educational workers in attendance was 
forty-two. The visitors numbered perhaps one hundred. The
-P-A-G-E-45
    eorge 
attendance was not large, but the interest of those present was 
good. We closed on Wednesday evening in order to give the 
teachers an opportunity to go home and vote in the county 
elections. 
The success of the work this year was good. The attendance 
evas, I think, as great as in former years, and in one instance 
much greater. Yet, County Institutes have become so general 
that I think the time has come for the State Institute to do a 
more distinet and higher work. There is a great need over the 
State for trained Institute workers. These the State Institute 
should provide. There ought to be three State Institutes, one 
in each division of the State. These should be centrally lo- 
cated and permanently established for the training of leading 
teachers who shall become experts in Institute work. The teach- 
ers so trained will then go into the various counties of the State 
and hold the County Institutes for the benefit of the masses of 
the teachers. In this way good work can reach all, and in no 
other way. The County Institute feature is growing so strong 
that there is a demand for trained Institute instructors at a 
good salary. If these are not supplied at once the cause of edu- 
cation will suffer. Inefficient Institute instructors are as detri- 
mental to educational success as are inefficient teachers in- the 
school room. 
Respectfully submitted, 
T. C. Karns. 
IN CONCLUSION. 
Permit me to again return my sincere thanks, and the thanks 
of all the people of Tennessee, to your honorable body for the 
substantial aid you have given the cause of popular education 
in this State. ; 
Yours truly, 
Frank M. Smiru, 
State Superintendent.

Ninety of the ninety-six counties of the State held Institutes, 
and 4,350 teachers attended the same. Much of this may be 
attributed to the efforts of the Convention of Public School 
Officers, which was held in this city December 6 and 7, 1887, 
when a definite plan of action was agreed upon. I do not hesi- 
tate to say that this Convention was the cause of more practical 
benefit to the schools of the State than any other one thing 
that has occurred during my administration. 
A circular, giving the plan agreed upon for organizing and 
conducting County Institutes, was issued from this office and 
sent to all the Superintendents and teachers of the State. A 
copy of said circular is herewith submitted, viz. : 
DepartMentT oF Pusiic InstRuction,

To the County Superintendents of Public Instruction : 
At a Convention of County Superintendents, held in this 
city December 6 and 7, 1887, the following plan for organizing 
and conducting County Institutes was unanimously adopted, to 
wit: 
- Your undersigned Committee on County Institutes beg leave 
to submit the following report: 
Recognizing the importance of a thorough organization, and 
the benefits derived from meeting and discussing the best meth- 
ods of conducting classes in the various branches taught in our 
public schools, and for discussing other questions pertaining to 
the general interest of schools, we recommend : : 
First—That two County Normal Institutes—one for white 
and oue for colored teachers—be organized and conducted by 
the County Superintendent, at some convenient place in the 
county, from one to three weeks, between the middle of June 
and the first of August. 
 
-P-A-G-E-47
  - —46— 
Second—That the Superintendent appoint a corps of expe- 
rienced and efficient teachers to assist him, communicate with 
him, make a program of the proposed work, and publish the 
same; also to urge the importance of every teacher in the 
county attending and taking part in the Institute. 
Third—A. President, Vice-president, Secretary, and Commit- 
tee on Arrangements shal! constitute the executive members of 
the Institute, and such questions shall be discussed as will be in, 
keeping with the advancement of education. 
Fourth—We furthermore recommend that Teachers’ Insti- 
tutes shall be held by the County Superintendents, from time 
to time, while the schools are in operation—these meetings to 
hold from one to two days. 
J. W. Savior, 
H. D. Hurraxsr, 
J. J. ZuccaRELyo. 
I know of no better plan, therefore I earnestly urge the 
County Superintendents to adopt this, and at once take the 
necessary steps to organize and to hold an Institute in their 
respective counties during the coming summer. 
CERTIFICATES, 
I hereby request that no certificate shall be issued until the 
close of the County Institute. 
Devote the last day of the Institute to a written examination 
of all applicants for certificates. Do not examine any one at 
this ‘time who has not attended the Institute at least three days, 
but fix a time later when applicants can be examined who did 
not attend the Institute. 
Use every means possible to improve the qualifications of the 
teachers of your respective counties, for in so doing you will 
improve the Public Schools. Do not issue a certificate to an 
incompetent person. 
 
-P-A-G-E-48
  ppc is 
Please notify me at your earliest convenience if you will hold 
an Institute. : 
Make all certificates issued expire at the same time, and let 
the date be that at which the Institute is held, or the close of 
the first examination. No matter if the certificate is not issued 
until September, make the date of issuance correspond with the 
date of the, Institute. 
Yours truly, 
Frank M. Suir,

During the past two years the following towns have organ- 
ized what are termed City Schools—that is, have elected a 
Board of Education to manage the schools within the corpo- 
rate limits, and levied a corporation tax for school purposes, and 
made the necessary arrangements for running the schools ten 
months in the year:

  Tracy City, Grundy County, has now in course of erection 
a public school building which, when completed, will be equal 
to any other in the State, and a good system of schools will be 
organized there. 
The schools at Johnson City have not opened yet, but all the 
necessary organization has been had, and the schools will open 
in September, 1889. 
University or TENNESSEE. 
A continued effort has been made to have all the counties of 
the State to send a full quota of cadets to this Institution. The 
improvements made by the management of this Institution 
during the past two years have been marvelous. I cannot
-P-A-G-E-49

   enumerate the improvements, but for particulars refer you to 
the report of Dr. Chas. W. Dabney, Jr., President, which is 
herewith submitted, and ask that it be read, long though it 
may be, for it is full of information valuable to all friends of 
education. 
I regard this Institution as the capstone of the Public School 
System in Tennessee, and I have urged County Superintendents 
to advertise its advantages. Tv this end the following circular 
was issued and sent to all the people: 
Srate or TENNESSEE, 
DEPARTMENT oF Pusiic InsrRucTION, 
Nasuvitie, Teny., May 1, 1888. 
To County and City Superintendents of Schools : 
Dear Strs—I have the honor to call your attention to a por- 
tion of your official duty as contained in Chapter 3, Article 
IV., Sections 327 to 329 of the Code. 
In accordance with the law you are hereby required to give 
public notice thereof, and to hold such examination, or examina- 
tions, of candidates for appointments as State Cadets in the 
University of Tennessee as may be necessary in your county 
or city. 
The University has been fully reorganized, and several hew 
chairs have been added. Three new buildings are being erected, 
and all the older ones are to be thoroughly renovated. The Agri- 
cultural Experiment Station, recently established by Congress, is 
connected with the University, and adds much to its advantages 
for scientific study. The University offers thus to the young 
men of Tennessee unsurpassed opportunities for study, espe- 
cially in the direction of technical, scientific, and industrial 
education. ‘i 
Under the laws of the State and of the University each State 
Senator can appoint two and each Representative three Cadets 
from the list of qualified candidates reported by County or City
-P-A-G-E-50
  pest ea 
Superintendents from their counties; and each County and City 
Superintendent can recommend a number, not limited, to the 
President of the University for other appointments. ® 
Such appointees become State Cadets when registered at 
the University, and are entitled to free registration and tuition 
for five years, or until graduation. Since registration and tui- 
tion amount to $60 per session, an appointment is worth $300 to 
any young man toward his education. With such an appoint- 
ment the total necessary expenses of « Cadet at the University 
are only about $180 per session o | n months, which is little 
more than it would cost him to stay at home. Many oppor- 
tunities are offered young men at the University to earn some- 
thing by which they can reduce their expenses further. 
The young men of the State will embrace this splendid 
opportunity to get an education when it is known to them. 
Publish a notice like the following in your county papers, or 
otherwise : 
EXAMINATIONS FOR APPOINTMENTS TO STATE CADETSHIPS IN THE 
UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE 
  
will be held in accordance with law by the undersigned, at ‘ 
on the [give several dates] —— of June. Applicants must be 
at least fifteen years of age; must show a good moral character 
and be prepared to pass an examination in Arithmetic, English 
‘Grammar and Composition, Geography, and United States His- 
tory. All who pass can receive an appointment, with free tui- 
tion, good for five years, and worth $300 in tuition and fees, as 
compared with other Institutions. The expenses of a State 
Cadet at the University are about $180 for a session of ten 
months. Courses in Civil and Mechanical Engineering, Agri- 
culture, General Science, Chemistry, aud Literature. The Uni- 
versity has been thoroughly reorganized and enlarged. New 
buildings and new professorships. For particulars of courses 
of study and expenses, address the President, Dr. Charles W. 
Dabney, Jr., at Knoxville, Tenn. This is an unsurpassed op- 
portunity for young men to get a splendid education. It will . 
not be so easy to get an appointment after this year, as the 
4—s, 8, P. I.
-P-A-G-E-51
. nn BOS 
  
University will be filled up. (Signed) , County (or City) 
Superintendent of Schools for County (or City).   
When young men present themselves give them thofough 
examinations in the branches named. The regulations of the 
University say, “No person shall be admitted to any department 
of the University who does not possess a thorough knowledge 
of Arithmetic, English Grammar and Composition, Geography, 
and United States History, as far as taught in Common Schools 
of the State.” The University cannot do any portion of the 
work that the Common Schools should do. It is especially im- 
portant that they should be well trained in arithmetic, and be 
able to write and speak English correctly. It will be mistaken 
kindness to send boys up to the University to find out there 
that they cannot enter even the lowest classes. 
You are expected to see to it, also, that the young men you 
recommend are of good moral character, and earnest in their 
desire for more education. It is not enough that you do not 
know any thing against a candidate. He should prove a good 
character by testimonials from his teachers, or other reliable 
persons. 
Make out a list of the candidates you find qualified and rec- 
ommend, on the inclosed blank, and forward it to me by 
July 1. By attending to this matter faithfully you will not 
only perform your official duty, but confer an everlasting bene— 
fit upon the young men of your county. 
Iam, respectfully yours,

This institution is the grand master wheel that will soon rey_ 
olutionize the system of public education in the South. « 
few short years ago, and in many localities at the present time, 
it was thought that anybody could teach school, and the ideq 
of trained teachers was unknown; but, thanks to the memory 
 
-P-A-G-E-52
    SOBEL 
of George Peabody, we are beginning to realize the value of 
normal training. I say beginning, for we are still in infancy as 
regards the great influence this institution is destined to wield 
in the educational field. None but those who have come in 
contact with the work in the school room of the graduates of 
this institution can properly appreciate the value of a trained | 
teacher over one who has not had normal training. 
Tennessee now has fourteen Peabody scholarships in this in- 
stitution, worth $200 per year each; scholarship good for two 
years. These scholarships are under the control of the State 
Superintendent of Publie Instruction, and are disposed of as’ 
follows: A competitive examination will be held in each county 
in the State, August 8th and 9th, by the County Superintend- 
ents. The examination questions will be sent from the office of 
the State Superintendent, in sealed envelopes, to the County 
Superintendents, with instructions not to break the seal until 
the morning of the examination, and then in the presence of 
the applicants. The answers to the questions must be written, 
and all the papers forwarded to this office, when a special com- 
mittee will decide who are the successful competitors. The ap- 
pointments are made in the following manner: The applicant 
making the highest per cent. will be appointed from the State 
at large; then the three grand divisions of the State. The one 
receiving the highest per cent. from each of the three grand di- 
visions will be appointed. Then, in the same manner, each 
congressional district will be considered. Applicants will be 
examined on Orthography, Reading, Writing, Arithmetic, Geog- 
raphy, United States History, English Grammar, Elementary 
Geeology of Tennessee, Elementary Principles of Agriculture, 
Elementary Algebra, Book-kceping, Rhetoric, Physical Geog- 
raphy, and Physiology. 
For particulars as to the workings of the Normal College I 
refer you to the reports of Prof. Frank Goodman, Secretary of 
the State Board of Education, and, Prof.‘W. H. Payne, Presi- 
dent of the College. 
One word, however, as to President Payne. He is a grand
-P-A-G-E-53
  GBs 
man, and knows his business, and hesitates not to discharge it; 
and, if he is spared us, in less than five years at least one thou- 
sand young men and young women will be looking to him for 
light.

Lerrer to THE County Courts. 
On November 1st last a circular letter was sent from this 
department to the various County Courts of. the State, calling 
attention to the important relationship the courts bear to our
-P-A-G-E-54
      
Seip aee 
complex Public School System. I herewith submit a copy of 
said “letter.” One item in said letter, “ Eligibility,” caused 
some criticism, especially in those counties where women had 
been elected County Superintendents. This ruling was not 
hastily made, nor was it made until after receiving good legal 
advice. The question was also submitted to Hon. G. W. Pickle, 
Attorney-General, for an opinion, and his ruling is also sub- 
mitted : 
State or TENNESSEE, 
DepartMEeNT oF Pusiic Instruction, 
Nasuvitte, Tenn., Jan. 3, 1889. — 
To his Excellency, Robt. L. Taylor, Governor : 
Duar Str—There was issued from this department, November 
1, 1888, a “circular letter” addressed to the County Courts of 
the State, in which letter I ruled that a woman is not eligible 
to the office of County Superintendent of Public Instruction in 
the following language, to wit: 
“ BLIGIBILITY.” 
“A woman is not eligible to the office of County Superintend- 
ent of schools. A few counties have elected women to this 
position, thinking they were eligible, but this is a county office, 
and a woman is no more eligible to this office than to that of 
sheriff or any other county office.” 
It was absolutely necessary to make a ruling upon this ques- 
tion on account of the demand which was made from many 
counties of the State. 
T desire to submit this question to you, and ask that the same 
be submitted by you to the Hon. G. W. Pickle, Attorney- 
General for the State, with the view of securing his official 
opinion as to the correctness of said ruling. 
Yours truly,

January 3, 1888. Rost. L. Tayior, 
> Governor. 
NASHVILLE, TEnn., January 3, 1889. 
Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn. : 
Sir—Your favor, transmitted to me through the Executive, 
requesting my opinion touching the eligibility of women to 
the office of County Superintendent of Public Instruction has 
been carefully considered. 
The Legislature has created the office of County Superin- 
tendent of Public Instruction, and made provision for filling it 
in one of the methods recognized by the Constitution, to wit: 
An election by the County Court. (See Constitution, Art. XT., 
Sec. 17; Public School Laws, pamphlet, p. 6). 
Incumbents of this office should possess those qualifications 
for office-holding prescribed by the general laws of the State. 
The Code, under the title of ‘‘ Eligibility of Officers,” defines 
those qualifications in the following language: “All free white 
males of the age of ‘twenty-one years, who are citizens of the 
United States, and of this State, and have been inhabitants of 
the State, county, district, or circuit, the period required by 
the Constitution and laws of the State, are qualified to hold office 
in this State.” Code (T. & 8.), Sec. 748. 
By Acts of 1866-67, Ch. 31, all disqualification on account 
of “race or color” was remoyed. Code (T. & §.), See. 748a. 
The Legislature having named the qualifications for holding
-P-A-G-E-56
Soyer ee 
office, all are necessarily excluded who do not possess those 
qualifications. 
The requirement that those holding office in this State shall 
be “ males” has never been repealed. It ‘applies to all offices. 
It is found in juxtaposition with the requirements that persons 
holding office shall be twenty-one years of age, and citizens of 
the State and United States, and residents of the county or 
district. 
. 
All these requirements should be observed until repealed or 
altered by the Legislature. If one may be dispensed with all 
may, with equal propriety, be disregarded. 
If a change in the laws be desirable the remedy is with the 
Legislature. Such has been the course in other States. 
My conclusion is that under the existing laws women are not _/ 
eligible to the office of County Superintendent. 
Respectfully, 
G. W. Pickin, Attorney-General 
CIRCULAR LETTER TO THE COUNTY COURTS OF THE STATE. 
State or TENNESSEE, 
DEPARTMENT OF Pusiic InstRUCTION, 
NasHviLiz, Trnn., Nov. 1, 1888. 
To your Honorable Bodies, the County Courts of Tennessee : 
I desire again to call your attention to the important part you 
have to perform in our complex Public School System : 
The election of a County Superintendent is the most impor- 
tant duty you have to perform in this connection, and I do 
most earnestly urge you to elect the best man that can be had 
for the place. The school laws define his qualifications, to wit : 
“We shall be a person of literary and scientific attainments, 
and, when practicable, of skill and experience in the art of 
teaching.” :
-P-A-G-E-57
  eh Ge 
The County Superintendent should be paid a salary sufficient: - 
to enable him to discharge the duties of the office. 
Do not require the teachers to pay a fee to the County Super- 
intendent for the certificates issued. You have no authority to 
do this, and it is very unjust to assess such a tax. 
It is certainly enough for the teacher to undergo an annual 
examination, without having to pay for the certificate. 
The law directs how the County Superintendent shall be p&id, 
viz.: “And shall receive such pay for his services as may be 
allowed him by the County Court, to be paid upon the order of the 
Chairman or Judge of the County Court by the County Trustee.” 
I trust that in those counties where the teachers have been 
required to pay for the certificate that this custom will be abol- 
ished at once. . 
ELIGIBILITY. 
A woman is not eligible to the office of County Superintend- 
ent of Schools. A few counties have elected women to this 
position, thinking they were eligible; but this is a county office, 
* and a woman is no more eligible to this office than to that of 
Sheriff, or any other county office. 
I suggest that where you have had a good man in this place, 
one who has discharged his duties to the best of his ability and 
to the satisfaction of the people, that it may be well to re-elect 
him. 
There is danger in changing from a good man, who has been 
tried and proved to be successful,-to one who has not been 
tried. A good lesson can be learned on this point from our 
city boards of education. A city superintendent who is a com- 
petent man holds his place as long as he wants it. The pupils 
suffer by the changes. 
Remember, you cannot have good schools unless you seleet 
competent men for the position of County Superintendent and 
pay liberal salaries.
-P-A-G-E-58

LEVYING SCHOOL TAX. Fy 
In order that you may know what a liberal provision made 
for the public schools in your respective counties will do, and 
that in a short time, I take the liberty of herewith embodying 
a letter received at this office from Mr. D. E. McCorkle, County 
Superintendent of Dyer County, to wit: 
“Hon. Frank M. Smith: 
“Dear Sir—In submitting my annual report I point with 
pride to some of the signs of progress that have made them- 
selves conspicuous during our scholastic year just closed. There 
has been a general awakening all along the line, and our Free 
School System has thrown a new blood-current into the arteries 
of the body-politic, and aroused it to a new life and new hopes. 
This new impetus, instinct with enérgy, enterprise, and happi- 
ness, has made itself felt in many directions, and has manifested 
itself in increased population, increased facilities, and, what is 
most important, increased school funds. 
“ Dyer County now and for some time has regarded our Public 
School System as among the permanent institutions of our 
country, to which we might look for development and progress 
in all things pertaining to a higher civilization. It is regarded 
as the matrix, so to speak, in which our national character and 
civilization are cast. Our people realize that in a great republic 
like ours, where individual liberty and individual responsibility 
are made paramount to our relations to government, the safety 
and happiness of society depend upon the hearts of our people, 
and that, unless the people are educated, we cannot expect 
them to have a proper appreciation of and respect for the rights _ 
of their fellow-men. They also recognize the fact that it is only 
to the free schools we can look for the education of the com- 
mon masses of the people. _ Accordingly, our County Court, at _ 
its January term, 1887, raised our county school tax from fifteen 
to twenty cents on the one hundred dollars’ worth of taxable — 
property; and so well were our people pleased with the in-_ 
creased advantages thus given to the common schools of the 
county that when the question of making os taxes lighter
-P-A-G-E-59
age 
came up at the January term of the County Court in 1888 the 
reduction was made on the tax raised for county purposes, and 
was permitted to remain at twenty cents for school purposes. 
Or, to put it a little differently, so dear are our common free 
schools to our people that, rather than sacrifice any part of the 
fund raised for their support, they prefer to retrench general 
county expenses, and cut down burdens in other directions, in 
order that they may keep the banner of education floating 
proadly above the waves. 
“We note, too, the very happy effects of our Free School 
System upon our scholastic population. Last year we reported 
6,861 children of school age in the county; this year we report 
7,464, showing an increase of 603 over last year. Thus we con- 
clude that our liberal provisions for free education are constantly 
attracting the attention of people of other parts of the country, 
and drawing them to our borders, who, when they come among 
us, make valuable citizens and members of society; for it may 
be truthfully said that the low and vicious care but little for 
education, and never seek localities that have improved educa- 
tional advantages. 
«“ We have now a splendid army of well equipped teachers at 
work inthe county. We have gradually worked out the class of 
teachers very pertinently and significantly denominated ‘moon- 
shiners’ by my predecessor, and have replaced them by a high- 
bred, well-educated class of teachers, who stand their examina- 
tion and get their certificates before entering upon their worls. 
“In conclusion, while the schools of Dyer County are not all 
that we desire and hope to make them, still we are very well 
satisfied with the progress we have been making, and could not, 
under any circumstances, be induced to part with our Free 
School System, even though it should never be better than it is 
at present. One may it live and prosper. ‘ 
. “ Very respectfully, 
“D. E. McCorxte, 
“ County Superintendent for Dyer County.?? 
 
-P-A-G-E-60
ap Oes 
Many others have reported facts similar to those made by Mr. 
McCorkle; and I am pleased to know that the letter sent from 
this office one year ago to the County Courts was received with 
favor had.the effect of increasing the school tax in many in- 
stances. 
T again call your attention to the language of the law on this 
subject: “That when the money derived from the school fund 
and taxes imposed by the State on the counties shall not be 
sufficient to keep up the public schools for five months in the 
year in the school districts of the county, the County Court shall 
levy an additional tax sufficient for this purpose, or shall sub- 
mit the proposition to a vote of the people.” 
THE SCHOOL DISTRICT. 
There is trouble in some counties in the State growing out of 
the fact that the District Directors thought that they had the 
right to form a new school district at pleasure. The directors 
have no such authority. 
The County Courts of their respective counties alone have 
this authority. The District- Directors can subdivide their re- 
spective school districts, i. ¢., the directors can say to which 
house certain pupils shall attend school. 
The school district and the civil district should be identical. 
This should be the general rule. There are some instances 
where it may be necessary to depart from this. 
In all the counties in this State where the public schools have 
reached the highest point of excellence, the districts, as above 
mentioned, are identical. 
The same can be said of all the States of the Union. You 
will find the best schools in those States where the “township” 
plan prevails. I therefore most earnestly urge your honorable 
bodies to make as few changes in the school district lines as 
possible, and at all times strive to make the school district and 
the civil district identical. The most serious defect in the man-
-P-A-G-E-61
‘eae 
Egy 
agement of our schools has grown out of this changing of 
shool districts and establishing too many schools. We have 
more than twice as many schools as we should have. 
The formation of new districts, and the location of school 
houses in localities where there were twenty-five or thirty chil- 
dren, have done more to damage the schools in some counties 
than can be repaired in a life-time. We must have fewer 
schools and more children numbered to each house, if we wish 
to have better schools. 
THE SCHOOL FUND. 
There is something radically wrong, in many counties in the 
State, in the management of the school fund, and the County 
Courts are, in a great measure, responsible for this. Trustees 
should be required to obey the law. I again call your attention 
to Section 43, Chapter 25, of the Acts of 1873, to wit : 
“That the County Trustee shall keep separate accounts of the 
State funds and county funds, showing whence and on what 
account the moneys were severally derived, and by what order, 
on what account, and to whom they were distributed; and, as 
soon as said moneys are received, he shall report the same to the 
County Superintendent, and to the District Directors of each schook 
district.” 
In some instances Trustees will not report the amount of 
school funds on hand oftener than once a year. My attention 
has been called to the fact that, in at least one instance, the 
County Trustee makes an annual disbursement about January, 
and the schools of the county open in July, and, the teachers 
who receive warrants on the Trustee are forced to have the 
warrants discounted in order to obtain money for current ex- 
penses, and these warrants are discounted by a bank where the 
Trustee has money on deposit, when, in fact, the teachers’ war— 
rants are discounted and paid from the school fund. 
The Chairmen of the respective counties should demand of 
the Trustee a disbursement of the school fund at least once a 
- quarter.
-P-A-G-E-62
  Eee 
The Couty Trustee is also required to make an annual report 
to the County Superintendent, on or before the 15th day of 
September, of the amount of money received by him for school 
purposes, and the disbursements of the same. This, in many 
instances, is grossly neglected, and a few Trustees absolutely re- 
fuse to report to this office. In some instances there are’such 
discrepances made from year to year in the reports sent here as 
to readily lead one to the conclusion that the school fund needs 
better protection. ’ , 
THE ANNUAL CONVENTION OF COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS. 
Teall your especial attention to the Convention of Superin- 
tendents that meets in this city the second Tuesday of Decem- 
ber next. This will be a very important meeting—one that 
each Superintendent should attend. Many living in the remote 
parts of the State cannot attend on account of the expense. 
The County Courts can pay the expenses of the Superintend- 
ents while attending said Convention. Many counties did so 
last year, and I ask all to do so this year. The County Court 
pays the salary of the Superintendent, and this expense can be 
tixed as a part of his salary. Retrenchment and reform does 
not mean that you shall deprive your officers of the necessary 
means to meet expenses while in the discharge of duty. 
I ask the Chairmen of the County Courts of the State to 
read this circular, or cause it to be read, to their respective’ 
courts at their January term, 1889. 
Very respectfully, 
: Frank M. Smrrn, 
State Superintendent of Public Instruction. 
AssoctaTion or Pusiic Scuoon OFFIcERs. 
One year ago the County Superintendents, upon the call of 
the State Superintendent, met in the Senate Chamber of the 
State Capitol in this city and effected a permanent organization 
to be known as the Association of Public School Officers, and - 
the second Tuesday in December was fixed as the date of the 
annual meeting.
-P-A-G-E-63
— 62—_ 
  This Association is destined to do much good in systematiz- 
ing the work. in the counties and improving the condition of 
our schools. Five thousand copies of the printed proceedings 
have been distributed throughout the State, thus you see all are 
more or less influenced by the work of this Association. Some 
provision should be made by the County Courts to pay the ex- 
penses of the County Superintendents to this annual meeting. 
A copy of the progeedings of said Association is herewith 
submitted. (See Appendix.) 
FINANCIAL. 
Here we need legislation. Some provision should be made 
for the better collection of the 
POLL TAX. 
This tax goes to the Public Schools, and at the very lowest 
estimate the loss is not less than $100,000 annually because of 
the non-collection of said tax. This should not be, and it would 
not be if this tax went to the State. 
Again, legislation is needed to better protect the school fund 
that is collected. See letter to County Courts on this subject. 
All I have to base this assertion upon is the statements made 
-by the County Trustees to this department. 
When a County Trustee submits a report showing that he 
had so much on hand June 80th, the date of the report, and 
the close of the school year, and then when the next report, by 
the same officer, is submitted with the statement that he had so 
much on hand when the last report was submitted, and these 
two amounts fail to agree, and the Trustee refuses to make any 
explanation, then the book-keeping should be regulated. 
But to make this clearer, say a Trustee reports: Balance on 
hand June 30, 1887, $20,008.79; then when his report is sub- 
mitted for 1888, he says: Amount on hand, July 1, 1887, $9,- 
636.94. The amount should have been the same as that first
-P-A-G-E-64
  2 Gee 
given, because his report should begin each year just where it 
left off the year preceding. A tabulated statement was pub- 
lished in the report for 1887 which may be of interest just now. 
Lalso submit a statement for the years 1886 and 1887. These 
statements show bad book-keeping, to say the least. 
It frequently occurs that a Trustee reports amount on hand 
at last report much larger than was reported asa balance on 
hand the year previous. How this can be I am not able to ex- 
plain. In the tabulated statements above referred to the ex- 
cesses are given as well as the deficits.

The following letter is self-explanatory : 
“ Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruc- 
tion: 
“ Dear Sir—I desire to bring to the attention of the school 
authorities and teachers of Tennessee a fact not generally 
known by them. Teachers of one year’s approved standing, 
who design to make teaching a profession, may be admitted 
to free tuition in the Academic Department of Vanderbit Uni- 
versity, if prepared to enter the Freshman class. Applicants 
for admission upon these terms must present to the faculty 
suitable testimonials of their fitness to receive these Teachers’ 
Scholarships. 
“Tt gives me pleasure to state that scores of young men from 
various portions of our Southern country have availed them- 
selves of the advantages so generously afforded by Vanderbilt 
University, and they have gone forth from her walls to advance- 
the great cause of education. Let others come; they are always 
gladly welcomed. The highest degrees conferred by the Uni- 
versity are open to them upon this line.

“ Wits WILLIAMS, 
“Secretary Vanderbilt University.”

S. A. Link, A. M., is Superintendent, and this institutionis a 
part of the Public School System of the State, intended for the 
education of those who, on account of deficiency of sight, can- 
not attend other schools. It is a school of high grade, free of 
charge to all the blind and partially blind children of the State 
between the ages of seven and seventeen, who are of good 
morals, reasonable health, and free from epilepsy or any con- 
tagious disease. There are three departments—Literature, 
Music, and Handicraft. In almost every county the superin- 
tendent and teachers may find children who cannot be educated. 
at home on account of blindness, or without causing permanent 
injury to the sight. It is a humane act of far-reaching conse- 
quences to such children to notify the Superintendent of the 
School for the Blind of their whereabouts. The attendance is 
twenty per cent. larger than ever before, though many more 
are entitled. Address,

REPORT 
OF THE 
STATE BOARD OF: EDUCATION. 
: LIBRARY 
MIDDLE TENNESSEE STATE COLLEGE 
MURFREESBORO, TENNESSEF
-P-A-G-E-101
 
-P-A-G-E-102
  REPORT OF THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION. 
Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction 
Sor Tennessee: 
I hereby submit my report of the State Board of Education 
for the two last years, a period which constitutes an era of 
critical importance in the history of the State Normal College. 
TWO EVENTFUL YEARS. 
At the opening of this period Hon. Robert L. Taylor was in- 
augurated Governor of Tennessee, and became President of this 
Board. The beginning of his administration was characterized 
by one of the most trying ordeals through which any educa- 
tional institution of the State has ever been called to pass. 
In this emergency the Governor showed himself not only an 
able executive officer, but a wise and strenuous advocate of the 
highest interests of education in his native State. 
Immediately after his induction into office circumstances 
arose which threatened, at one time, to retard the growth if not 
to endanger the successful continuance of the College. 
The first and most deplorable of these was the 
DEATH OF DR. EBEN 8S. STEARNS, 
which occured April 11, 1887. He had been President of the 
Normal College from its organization, a period of twelve years, 
and had seen it grow from a small institution into a flourishing 
college that will be a lasting monument to his memory. 
(101) :

og 
The Board met on the following day, April 12, and passed 
suitable resolutions, and requested Mrs. Mary E. W. Jones, a 
member of the Faculty, to represent the Board by accompany- 
ing the family, with the remains of the deceased, to Boston, at 
the expense of the Board. 
CHANGES IN THE BOARD. 
At this time the term of Hon. Leon Trousdale and Dr.‘J~ 
Berrien Lindsley, as members of the Board, expired. They 
had been honorably and actively associated with Dr. Stearns. 
ever since the Board was organized in 1875. 
' Here again arose an important duty, which the Governor 
met by appointing Rev. J. W. Bachman, of Chattanooga, to sue- 
ceed Col. Trousdale, and Supt. Charles 8. Douglas, of Gallatin, 
to succeed Dr. Lindsley. 
Frank Goodman, who had been a member of the Board for 
four years, was elected Secretary. 
. 
PROMPT AND CAUTIOUS ACTION NECESSARY. 
The first duty devolving upon the reorganized Board was to 
select some one to take charge of the College, and see that the 
school work of the year, then drawing to a close, should be- 
carried to a successful conclusion, and to take charge of the 
business matters, and arrange for the opening of the following 
session, or until a President should be elected. 
The Board elected Prof. B. B. Penfield, who was a member 
of the Faculty, as President pro tem. He accepted the respon— 
sible trust, and performed every duty to the entire satisfaction 
of this Board. 
SELECTING A NEW PRESIDENT. 
This Board at once communicated with the Peabody Board, 
being desirous to ascertain its wishes in the selection of the 
new President. ‘ 
 
-P-A-G-E-104
  neg = 
That body requested the State Board to await its recommen- 
dation, and invited representation from this Board to meet 
with them in New York. ’ 
The State Board accepted the invitation and 
GOVERNOR TAYLOR AND SUPERINTENDENT SMITH 
attended the meeting of the Peabody Board, and the result of 
that conference was that a full and explicit understanding was 
reached with respect to their mutual relationships. 
The Peabody Board manifested its profound satisfaction’ at 
this auspicious conclusion, and expressed its appreciation, of 
the interest exhibited by the State Board in sending represen- 
tatives to their meeting. This will doubtless result in perma- 
nent gootl to the Normal College, and to the State at large. 
THE RESULT. 
After mature deliberation the Peabody Board nominated 
Prof. W. H. Payne, of the University of Michigan, who was _ 
highly recommended by Dr. J. L. M. Curry, whereupon our 
Board elected him President of the State Normal College; and 
the Trustees of the University of Nashville, who so generously 
furnish the grounds and buildings for the Normal College, 
elected him Chancellor of the University of Nashville. 
W. H. PAYNE, THE NEW PRESIDENT. 
.Professor Payne is well known to the profession as a man 
of exceptional ability in his special line of study, and of 
teaching. He has been a profound and diligent student of we 
history, philosophy, and science of education. 
As a pioneer in pedagogical science, and as a successful 
exponent of modern methods, he has won general recognition — 
from the profession. His recent work on tite “Science and Art — 
of Teaching” has given him a wide celebrity as a thoughtful, © 
suggestive, and practical educator.

INDUCTED INTO OFFICE. 
The ceremonies of the installation of Professor Payne were 
held in the spacious chapel of the college on Wednesday, Octo- 
ber 5, 1887. A representative body of leading citizens occu- 
pied the platform. . 
Professor Penfield, who, since Dr. Stearns’ death, had been 
acting President, presided over the mecting. After a brief 
introductory from him a statement on behalf of the University 
of Nashville was made by Col. W. B. Reese, a member of the 
Board of Trustees, and by Dr. W. P. Jones on behalf of the 
State Board. 
_ Professor Payne was then introduced, and read an inaugural 
paper, which was marked by modesty of tone, kindliness of 
sentiment, and a wise conservatism in reference to the future 
plans and purposes of his incoming administration, and he 
clearly showed that he realized. the arduous duties that would 
devolve upon him as President of the Normal College. é » 
DISCOURAGING FINANCIAL OUTLOOK. 
‘When Prof. Payne took charge of the College on October 5, 
1887, the books of the Comptroller showed there was a balance 
of $27,187 due the College by the State, but the Comptroller 
claimed that $12,458.34 of this amount could not be paid, as it 
was not drawn by March 31, the end of the fiscal years for 
which appropriated. 
The reasons why this sum of $12,458.34 was not drawn by 
the end of the fiscal years were that the State was at times 
short of funds, having the extra expense of funding the State 
_ debt, and providing to meet the interest on same. And fur- 
_ ther, because Dr. Stearns and the State Board had confidence 
in the willingness of the State to meet its part of the following 
contract, which appears in an amended act, approved March 30, 
1883, and reads as follows:
-P-A-G-E-106
— 105 — 
CONTRACT OF THE STATE WITH PEABODY BOARD. 
«“ Wurreas—The Trustees of the Peabody Education Fund 
have voted that their General Agent be empowered to allow to 
Tennessee a proportionate number of scholarships whenever 
and so long as Tennessee shall give $10,000 annually to the 
College, free from all incumbrance ; therefore, 
“Sec. 2. Be it enacted, That the $10,000, as annually appro: 
priated, shall be used by the State Board of Education to sup- 
port’said Normal College, at Nashville, exclusively; provided, 
that the General Agent of the Peabody Board of Trustees shall 
allow to this State Peabody Scholarships on the same condi- 
tions as those granted other States.” 
The President of the Normal College and the agents of the 
Peabody Board of Trustees have kept their part of the above 
contract, and have paid regularly, since the above act or con- 
tract took effect, $200 per annum to every Tennessee scholar- 
ship student. 
UNEXPECTED EXPENSES PRESENT THEMSELVES. 
From the foregoing it will be seen that instead of President 
Payne having $27,187 to use for the two years upon which he 
was about to enter he had only $14,728.66 that he was allowed 
to draw from. ; 
Not only this, but there had been some $1,500 extra expense 
incurred, caused by the death of Dr. Stearns, and in filling his 
place. t 
This left little more than $13,000, with which President Payne 
has been expected to run the College for two years. 
He has already paid out, as per vouchers filed with the Board, 
$12,141.74, and has in his hands $2,367.66, which leaves $219.26 
still in the State Treasury, and the College has more than half 
a year yet to run.
-P-A-G-E-107
— 106 — ’ 
Tt is, therefore, evident that steps should at once be taken to 
secure the remaining $12,458.34. This necessity is the more 
urgent as his annual report shows a large increase in attendance, 
éhiefly from the State of Tennessee, and that the College de- 
mands more teachers and enlarged facilities. 
A SUCCESSFUL FINANCIER AS WELL AS EDUCATOR. 
For the first time since the College was established every 
Southern State is now represented, and the attendance is 261 
this year, compared with 177 last year. 
When the small amount of funds at the command of Presi- 
dent Payne is taken into consideration this increase of about 
fifty per cent. in one year is truly wonderful. 
While more teachers and additional facilities are needed, yet 
there have been results accomplished, and a degree of satisfac- 
tion unanimously expressed, by the students and all connected 
with the institution. 
All this goes to show that the Faculty, while greatly over- 
crowded with work, has done a surprising amount of labor, re- 
reflecting the highest credit upon the management of the Presi- 
dent and his able assistants. 
STUDENTS’ EXPENSES REDUCED. 
President Payne has not only managed the financial matters 
of the College with marked ability, but he has already succeeded 
in reducing the expenses of the young men three dollars per 
month, and the young ladies at least one dollar per month, and 
he is still devising plans to reduce their expenses to a still lower 
figure. 
THE COLLEGE NAMED. 
The Board has named the institution the Peabody Normal 
College. This was done at the suggestion of Governor Taylor, 
_to commemorate the name of George Peabody.
-P-A-G-E-108
  — 107 — 
   If there is any virtue in commemorating the philanthropic 
labors of our fellow-men, assuredly it is most fitting that the 
State of Tennessee and the entire South should unite in this 
memorial to the illustrious benefactor whose munificent be- 
quests have gladdened so many homes, and carried light and 
knowledge throughout all the borders of our Southern land. 
NEW LIBRARY AND A LIBRARIAN. 
During the past year the Trustees of the Peabody Education 
Fund have appropriated $2,000 for a Library for the Normal 
College, and also an additional amount toward paying the 
salary of a Librarian. 
THE OPENING AND CLOSING SESSION. 
The Board, in its official capacity, has attended all the public 
_ exercises of the College, both opening and closing, and has ob- 
served, with the liveliest pleasure, the evidences of the thorough - 
and scholarly work accomplished by the institution. 
Individual members, including the Secretary, have visited the 
class exercises of the College, and noted with interest and satis- 
faction the work daily going on in the recitations and drills of 
the College. 
COLORED STATE NORMAL SCHOLARSHIPS. 
In 1881 the Legislature appropriated $2,500 per annum for 
colored normal scholarships, and in 1883, and again in 1885, 
appropriated $3,300, making each scholarship worth $50. 
In 1887, however, by what seems to have been an oversight, 
the appropriation was only $1,500 per annum, making each 
scholarship worth but $22.70, instead of $50, as in the four 
years previous. 
Numerous petitions from students and the officers of the col- 
leges for training of colored normal students have been received 
by the State Board requesting the Board to render some kind 
of relief, but it could not.
-P-A-G-E-109
oss 
The following extracts are from a letter from one of. SSE 
- institutions, and present the case in a clear light: 
. “When the appropriation was $50 for each scholarship it 
a been found, on the whole to be satisfactory, although 
small. 
2. “ With scholarships only worth the sum of $22.70 it is | 
found too small an amount to meet the case of these normal 
students. 
3. “The State Board of Education is respectfully requested 
to secure suitable action, and have the mistake of the last Leg- 
islature corrected, and secure to each normal student the 
amount of $50 annually in the future.” 
SCHOLARSHIPS PAID. 
During the part year the Board has paid scholarships to the 
amount of $1,293.90, to the various colleges as follows : 
Knoxville College, 9 students at $22.70.... 
Morristown Normal Institute, 1 student.. 
  Central Tennessee College, 14 students at $22.70 ........ 317 80 
Fisk University, 16 students at $22.70................00008 363 20 
Roger Williams University, 17 students at $22.70 ...... 385 90 
  
  
Total number students 57, total amount paid......... $1,293 90 
This leaves nine scholarships not presented to the colleges or 
the Board. : 
The bills for the present year have not yet been presented to 
the Board. 
Each of the thirty-three State Senators are entitled to make 
two appointments. Some have neglected to make the number 
of appointments they were entitled to, although written to sey- 
eral times and requested to do so, while some other Senators
-P-A-G-E-110
  — 109 — 
have attempted to appoint six; but of course the Board could 
only accept the two first received and recorded by it. These 
oversights on the part of some few of the Senators have caused 
much annoyance, and in some cases confusion. 
It is therefore hoped that Senators will carefully examine 
and comply with the instructions from this Board, as found on 
the back of scholarships, before they sign and deliver them. 
Some of the appointees have never used their scholarships, 
which, in part, accounts for only fifty-seven sholarships being 
presented to the Board. 
Respectfully submitted, 
Frank GoopMaN, 
Secretary State Board of Education.

This, our first session, being but a half term, we neither could 
nor did expect results that we are gratified to report. 
The schools were organized and graded in the midst of win- 
ter, our teachers, for the most part, unaccustomed to the graded 
work, and immediately after the organization the community 
was visited by several epidemics, which made telling inroads 
upon the attendance, scholastic discipline, and general routine 
work of the schools; and yet, in the face of all this, our suc- 
cess, I think, was splendid. We feel that our labors were well 
repaid in the discipline and solid advancement of the pupils, 
and from the generous manifestations of our patrons and the 
universal indorsement of the Board of Education, we feel and 
trust that general satisfaction has been given to all. 
The City Council, in their cordial co-operation given us, has 
created a substantial influence for and in behalf of the “graded 
system” of schools, and will assist materially in removing the 
doubts and prejudices of enemies and sustaining and strength- 
ening the efforts of friends. We are fully convinced that this 
Council, thoroughly alive to the future outgrowth of our city, 
will maintain their schools as one of the most important inter- 
ests of Gallatin. In truth, we would assert, from all the sur- 
roundings, that the schools have “ come to stay.” 
DISCIPLINE. 
Whilst our discipline has been gradual—kind, though posi- 
tive—and its results noticeable and satisfactory, yet in this line 
we feel that a decided advance must be madeif we would assure 
those results so essential toward the perfection of the system. 
' As to this feature Iam glad.to report that our patrons almost 
universally have indorsed us, thereby assisting materially-in the 
accomplishment of this very important part of our work.

BUILDINGS. 
The Main Street building, for whites, was completed in the 
beginning of this year, and is a model of modern architecture, 
beauty, and convenience. It is thoroughly heated by the large 
Grosins stoves, and well ventilated, winter or summer. There 
are two large halls, and eight recitation rooms opening into 
these, thereby rendering easy and convenient the passing of 
classes to and fro, which, as you are aware, is a strong point 
toward maintaining good discipline. The building for the col- 
ored is also new and of brick—comfortable, convenient, and well 
adapted to its purposes. Therefore we would assure you that 
we are highly blessed in the comforts and conveniences of good 
houses. 
The graded system—while you are aware that this is the 
pioneer effort toward the establishment of graded schools in 
this city—has, I am gratified to report, thus far given universal 
satisfaction, and, from the cordial indorsement of our people, 
am prone to assert that if it be properly managed the system 
becomes not only a fixture, but the schools will become the 
pride and pleasure of our citizens.   
TEACHERS. 
On account of the addition of an eighth grade by promo- 
tion we were compelled to secure the services of another 
teacher. We are now running with five teachers in the Main 
Street School (white), and for the present find that number suf- 
ficient to do the work. There being but five grades thus far in 
the colored school, we are using but three teachers in that work. 
Of the teachers of both schools who have labored under me 
during the past session I cannot speak too highly, as they have 
discharged their duties faithfully, cheerfully, and energetically, 
and, I am satistied, spared no efforts that would be profitable to 
the pupil or redound to the success of the schools. 
BOARD OF EDUCATION. 
To the liberal and progressive men who constitute our 
Board the gratitude of our citizens is certainly due, for they 
have labored unceasingly ‘“‘ without money and without price,’
-P-A-G-E-123
  — 122 — 
and though at first surrounded by much opposition, their un- 
yielding efforts and strong determination to succeed has been 
crowned with a grand and glorious success. 
CONCLUSION. 
In conclusion, permit me to say that I feel that should the 
future be as generous as the past, and should the co-opera- 
tion of our people be as strong, and their indorsements as 
warm as heretofore, that success is surely ours, and these 
graded schools, by yielding a rich and plenteous harvest, will 
not only prove in the future a great blessing to the children 
and a pride to the city, but an enduring monument to the lib- 
erality and educational advancement of its founders. 
Respectfully, 
C. 8. Dovenas,

Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn. : 
Dear Str—You will find herewith my statistical report. Our 
schools are in a pre-eminently flourishing condition, Last year 
we were under somewhat of a load from building, buying fur-
-P-A-G-E-133
Segoe 
niture, ete., but are now in a good financial condition, with a 
good Board of Education. We propose to push to the front. 
All of our private schools have practically gone under, and we 
expect to enroll in the graded schools all children who can be 
induced to attend school. Tullahoma don’t expect to be lurk- 
ing in the rear of any city in our State. Our schools are our 
pride, and we shall forge ahead. You are doing a noble work, 
and have my congratulations and best wishes.

REPORTS OF COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS. 
AwnprERson County. 
Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn.: 
Dear Srr—Inclosed find my report for the year. It is as full 
as circumstances will permit. The Directors will not attend to 
their business. They do not report the value of school property 
only in a few of the districts. 
T wish to get your advice in regard to the election of a Di- 
rector. This county has twelve voting districts and fifteen 
school districts, so in three districts the Directors have to be 
appointed. In the last August election in the eleventh district 
there was two votes difference in the candidates for Director. 
The fifteenth school district was made from the eleventh and 
first. There were two votes cast in the eleventh which live in 
the fifteenth. Had they any right to vote? Is it my duty to 
appoint another? Let me hear from you as soon as possible. 
Respecttully yours, 
P. M. Hosxtns, 
Superintendent.

Duar Sir—In submitting my fourth annual report of the Pub- 
lic Schools of Bedford County I could truthfully repeat all that 
Thave written in previous reports concerning improvements and 
progress. While we have not yet secured a standard of satisfac- 
tory efficiency, and still realize the necessity of other improve- 
- (135)

  — 136 — 
ments at various points along the line, the results of the work of 
the past year are very encouraging and gratifying. Weare evi- 
dently losing nowhere, but gradually gaining everywhere. We 
are studying true educational economy, the school law, works 
on teaching, and school journals more than we have been doing 
in the past. Most of the baseless, threadbare theories and cus- 
toms of other times have been abandoned and their places filled 
with something modern and better. Buildings, methods, public 
interest, and general results are such as prove that public schools 
have merited and won the respect, confidence, and support of 
all the people. 
Our county has every necessary educational organization. 
They are all in good working condition, and each is entitled to 
a liberal share of the honors due for the present excellent con- 
dition of our schools. 
The annual meeting of Directors was well attended, and the 
discussions were more interesting and profitable than usual. 
The leading object of these meetings is the discussion of ques- 
tions of general interest for the purpose of securing uniformity 
of thought and action throughout the county as regards such 
questions. They are profitable, however, in many other re- 
spects. 
The Normal Institute continued in session ten days, begin- 
ning’June 18th. Through the kindness of Prof. J. P. Hamil- 
ton we enjoyed the many comforts and conveniences of Shel- 
byville Female College. The Secretary, in his report of the 
work, says: ‘We feel safe in saying it has been the most suc- 
cessful Institute ever held in Shelbyville.” Officers were 
elected and arrangements made for a successful session next 
year. 
The colored teachers continued their Institute work fifteen 
days. Their enrollment was forty-five, and the daily attendance 
good. The teacher employed to take charge of the classes was 
well qualified, and succeeded in making the. work very practical 
and interesting. All seemed anxious about the success of the 
Institute, and were well pleased with the result.

The Reading Circle is entering the fourth year of its exist- 
ence. A meeting has been held the first Saturday in each 
month since its organization. It has been a source of much 
pleasure and profit to teachers, and is still growitig in numbers 
and in interest. 
Arbor Day was profitably observed in several schools. The 
law is favorably regarded by most teachers and directors, and 
will be more extensively applied next November. School 
rooms, as well as school grounds, will receive attention.

Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn. : 
Dear Srr—I have the honor of transmitting to you this my 
eighth annual report of the Benton County schools, and 1 can 
safely say that I have witnessed the gradual improvement that 
has been going on here in educational matters for the last ten 
years. Our teachers attend Normal Schools and Institutes 
more now than ever before. We held an Institute here the last 
week in June, as you directed, which lasted five days. We had 
in attendance forty-five teachers. Four ministers of.the gospel 
attended all of our meetings and opened them with prayer, and 
we had the legal talent of Camden to déliver to us some good 
educational addresses, while the citizens of Camden gave us ma- 
terial aid, and it was decidedly the best educational meeting ever . 
held in the county. We have had several meetings of the 
School Directors of the county, and I think directors and patrons 
are more enthused than ever before in this county. I visit — 
as near all of the schools of the county as I can, and after con- 
ferring with the teachers in regard to the school interest I then 
address the students and give them some encouragement. 
The question of building several fine school buildings is to 
be agitated, and there is one being built at Holladay which, 
when completed, will speak well for the people of that com- 
munity.
-P-A-G-E-139
  — 138 — 
But while there is a gradual improvement going on here in 
educational circles, there is yet a great deficiency, and that can 
only be supplied by setting apart more money for school pur- 
poses. Our school term only averages seventy-five days in 
Benton County, and we should have eight months in every sub- 
district in the State, and I yet hope and trust and pray that the 
time will soon come when all children of school age can have ~ 
free access to at least an eight months’ school.

Hon, Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Publie Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn.: 
Dear Str—I now have the honor of submitting my second 
annual report. My statistical report does not show much im- 
provement over last year, yet we are doing better. We have 
organized a County Institute, which is doing efficient work. 
Our Institute lasted five days, with as good attendance as could 
be expected, it being the first of the kind ever held in the 
county. We have a good number of efficient teachers enlisted 
this year, who are dving a good work. All we tack now is 
more money. If our,County Court could be induced to levy a 
_ sufficient tax to support our schools five months in the year we 
could do much better. We have some good school houses, but 
a majority of them are of an inferior class. 
Our report will be rather late on account of Directors and 
Trustees not reporting in due time. I received Trustees’ report 
this morning, and hasten to make my report. 
Respectfully submitted, 
‘ W. J. KERLEY, 
Superintendent.

  Buount County. 
Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn.: 
Dear Str—My report shows very littlé change since last 
year, yet we are moving onward. We have built about six new 
houses within the last year, still we are not fully supplied with 
comfortable houses. A few outlying districts have not con- 
formed to our uniformity of text-books, hence a few “dark 
corners” yet. July next our adoption of text-books expire. 
Then we hope to make the adoption general, including every 
district and school in the county. The schools complying with 
our adoption nine years ago are 50 per cent. in advance of those 
not complying. 
Our prescribed course of study adopted or prepared last June 
seems to be working itself in favor with teachers and patrons. 
Our County Institute, held in June, was a success, and some 
real good instruction and lectures to the teachers were given by 
Prof, Will A. Cate, the principal, and others. We are hopeful 
that the State will do something for Blount in 1889 in the way 
of Institute work. 
Tam looking forward to the Convention of Superintendents 
to be held in your office in December. Secure the best terms 
you can on the roads and at the hotels. I hope there will be a 
full attendance, and many of the knotty problems pertaining to 
our Free School System discussed. I would like to hear “ the 
payments of directors handled” by the superintendents. It ap- 
pears to me that the law, to say the least, on that point, is in- 
definite. The manner of electing Directors in odd years deserves 
a passing notice and a little legislation, I think. 
Your activity and energy in the education of the rising gen- 
eration prompt me to hope that you may be the successor of the 
present State Superintendent.

Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Ten. : 
Dear Srr—Inclosed you will find my fourth annual. report 
to the State Superintendent of Public Instruction. The interest 
manifested in education is much better in our county than in 
any preceding year of my administration. We have our An- 
nual Normal. Institute of one week for whites and the same 
length for colored teachers. The colored Normal convened at 
Cleveland in June, and was well attended. The Institute for 
whites was held at Chatata in July, and was attended by about 
fifty teachers. We have institutes throughout the county dur- 
ing the autumn of each year which are well attended by teachers 
and people. 
The value of school property is steadily on the increase by 
the building of new houses. The length of school terms are 
being increased in some places by the consolidation of small 
schools. 
During the past year séven new school houses have been . 
built in the county, which has increased the value of property 
$2,000. 
‘We have nearly a uniform series of text-books throughout 
the county. 
The State Teachers’ Association met at Cleveland in August, 
though providentially hindered from attending, and many of 
the schools being in session prohibiting the teachers of the 
county from attending, I learn that it was an interesting ocea- 
sion, and much good was accomplished in the cause. 
Every thing taken into consideration we have nothing of 
which to complain, but rejoice in the progress we are making, 
and hope ere long to be among the foremost in the State.

Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn.: 
Dear Str—I forward my annual report by to-day’s mail, as I 
- want to be prompt; and in making this, my fourth, report will 
say that our schools are in a good condition, both financially 
and in the matter of text-books. In the month of January, 
1888, at the Quarterly Court, I had commissioners appointed to 
lay off or redistrict the county, so as not to have so many 
school districts; for we, at that time, had sixty-eight, and 
we now have only fifteen. We elected three Directors, at 
our August election, for each school district. We had a 
good Normal in July, and discussed the subject of text-books, 
and our Directors signed an agreement to have the Helectic Se- 
ries adopted for five years. So the teachers all went to work 
to have the order carried out, and we have a uniform series of 
text-books. Our schools are well attended, and we can boast 
of better schools and attendance this year than ever before. 
Our teachers are all up with the times. They are readers of 
the Southwestern Journal, and love to attend Institutes and 
Teachers’ Meetings. When our schools started I made an ap- 
pointment at each school house for the school patrons to meet. 
I made two school speeches a day—one at 10 4. M. and one at 
3 Pp. M.—and the school men of the county met with us, and 
had various debates on the school interest. Since that time I 
have visited all the schools and made a school speech. Much 
of my success depends upon the good school teachers and Di- 
rectors. 
I attended the County Superintendents’ Convention at Nash- 
ville, last December, and I intend to be there next December if 
nothing prevents. So you see I want to be obedient to the 
State Superintendent’s orders, for he has been so kind to me in 
his advice. 
In conclusion I will say there are six candidates for County 
Superintendent in Campbell County, and it may be that I am 
the man to be beaten; if so I want to return my thanks for
-P-A-G-E-143
  — 142 — 
past favors, and trust that old Campbell County will elect a 
man that will keep the schools on a boom. 
Yours in truth, 
W. J. McGzs, 
Superintendent.

Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Snperintendent of Public ae uction, 
Nashville, Tenn.: 
Dear Str—I have the honor of submitting herewith my sta- 
tistical report for the school year ending June 30, 1888. While 
it is not pretended that the report is accurate in every part, 
still it is approximately correct, and shows substantially in all, 
and accurately in most respects, the status of the county schools. 
Until the District Directors and Trustees become more thor- 
oughly aroused to the importance of making prompt and cor- 
rect reports of their respective districts it cannot be hoped that 
the County Superintendent will be able to escape the necessity 
of, in some instances, making estimates based upon the data 
he has before him. It is with great pride and gratification that 
I point to the increased attendance in our public schools of 
those listed as being entitled to the benefit of the public funds. 
Last year the average daily attendance was about thirty-tive 
per cent. of the scholastic population of the entire county, and 
but little over half the enrollment; this year the average daily 
attendance is about thirty-seven per cent. This increase in 
daily attendance is flattering. Among the most encouraging 
signs of progress is the fact that.more of our teachers are grad- 
uates of tirst-tlass institutions of learning, and give more at- 
tention to the science of pedagogy than formerly. When 
teachers study teaching as a science for the purpose of making 
it their life-work, and work at it for the love of the work, and 
with the view to aiding in the development of a noble and bet- 
ter race of men and women, then will we find efficient and 
skilled work in the school room. That such is the tendency - 
now no one who has watched the public sentiment for the past 
few years can doubt. Our greatest difficulty is the lack of 
money. We only have money to run our schools on an aver-
-P-A-G-E-144
  — 143 — 
  age of three anda half months each year. If our county could 
be induced to lay a special tax for school purposes sufficient to 
run our schools five months in the year at least, our schools 
would then be a success, yet, as it is, we are gaining some 
ground. 
I must return my thanks to you for your, kind assistance and 
favors tendered me. 
James H. Knox,

Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn. : 
Dear Str—I have the honor of herewith transmitting to you 
my second annual report for the scholastic year ending June 
30, 1888. Since my last report we have made considerable im- 
provement in the way of buildings, seats, repairs, etc. There 
seems to be a great deal more interest manifested in schools of 
a higher order than ordinary district schools. As an evidence 
I will mention some of them: Macedonia Graded School, Hol- 
low Roek High School, Huntingdon High School, Clarksburg 
Youths’ Training School, Concord Graded School. In addition 
to these we have Bethel and McT. Institutes, situated at Mc- 
Kenzie, which are doing a good work in developing mind and 
- morals. We also have an institution of learning at McLemore- 
ville, which bids fair to take the lead in West Tennessee in the 
near future. 
The teachers of our county are endeavoring to improve 
themselves in the science of teaching by reading journals and 
books on theory and practice in teaching. Our Directors, 
generally speaking, are the best men in the county. They 
look after the school interest with the same care and attention 
they give their private business, though I regret to say that 
some of them cannot discard the idea of cheap teachers, 
without regard to their experience or proficiency. I have 
made my examinations very rigid this summer, making it
-P-A-G-E-145
— 144— 
a point not to grade higher than the applicant deserved. Our 
school buildings, with present repairs and improvements, Ithink, 
will be quite comfortable for winter schools. We:have several 
good school buildings inthe county. Ihave the honor of re- 
porting the first brick school building since the present school 
law went into effect. This building is in one of the rural dis- 
tricts; well seated, and furnished with apparatus. 
‘T have held two Institutes this summer, which were tolerably 
well attended, but not so well as they should have been—due 
to the teachers not having been well organized. I have visited 
every school in the county since my last report, and in most in- 
stances find the teachers doing all in their power to promote 
the educational interests of their respective communities. 
Our retiring Trustee, A. E. Hastings, deserves much credit 
for the way he has handled our school money during his stew- 
ardship. 
In conclusion, I will say we need longer school terms, and the 
County Superintendent paid a salary that will justify him in 
devoting his entire time to the business. 
Yours truly, 
: J. P. JOHNSON,

Carter County. 
Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn: 
Dear Str—I have the pleasure herewith to submit my second 
annual report. The “circular of information” to County Su- 
perintendents and District Directors, issued by you in the fall, 
1887, has eliminated several of our school houses. We will 
now have longer and better schools. You will notice also the 
County Court has added another school district to our number, 
making fourteen in this county. You have my hearty co-oper- 
ation in your earnest efforts to lift our common schools to 
higher basis. I have received copies of school laws, your 
 
-P-A-G-E-146
  — 145 — 
“annual reports,” “circular letters for the County Court,” and 
' eirculars of information to County Superintendents and Direct- * 
ors, sufficient to supply all of the Directors, teachers, and mag- 
istrates, for which we are thankful. Our school interests are 
booming. The State Institute, though short, gave us a good 
start, and did much good. 
Yours respectfully, 
T. F. M. Smoot, 
Superintendent. 
Custer County. 
Hon. Erank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn. : 
Duar Sir—By reference to my third statistical report, which 
I forward with this, and comparing it with the report for 1887, 
a decreased enrollment and attendance is shown. This is due, 
as anticipated in my report for that year, to the debts con- 
tracted by the Directors of many of the districts of the county. 
The interest in schools and the demand for longer terms pre- - 
vented them from stopping the schools when the funds were 
exhausted. And still the meagerness of our school funds is our 
chief embarrassment. The remaining districts that opened 
their schools show an increased attendance and enrollment of 
about fourteen per cent. 
The School Directors of the county have been more prompt 
than ever before in filing their reports. They will soon hold a 
convention, in which it is to be hoped every district in the | 
county will be represented, for the purpose of adopting rules + 
and regulations for the government of the schools of the 
county, and adopting text books, and counsel together about 
our great trouble—the want of money to run the schools for 
longer terms. 
The consolidated schools of this place, Henderson, are doing 
effective work in their normal classes. A large number of 
young men and ladies are attending, though this attendance is 
not entirely from this county or State. Neither can we hope 
10—s. 8. P. 1.
-P-A-G-E-147
- — 146 — 
to retain many of them in the county unless the Legislature or 
our County Court can be induced to provide larger funds with 
which to pay them larger salaries. It can be no exaggeration 
to say that we have lost at least half of our most efficient 
teachers from this cause. By leaving the county in any direc- 
tion they increase their salary at least fifty per cent., and not 
unfrequently from one hundred to three hundred per cent., 
with school terms from double to five times as long. The re- 
sult is that with all our labor and efforts, as far as the teachers 
and the schools of this county are concearned, they are but 
little benefited. In practical effect it is the exemplification of 
the unnatural policy of the survival of the unfittest. 
in the work of superintendence my efforts have been di- 
rected principally in improving the classification of the county 
schools. While I have accomplished much improvement, yet 
the work has not been commensurate with the needs of the 
schools. In fact, our county schools make slow headway in 
any thing that even approximates systematic grading. There 
are great difficulties in the way. I find many of the teachers 
giving individual lessons to individual pupils, using almost as 
many different text books by as many different authors in the 
same grade as they have pupils. In some instances the Direct- 
ors require the teacher to use any book that the parent may 
supply the pupil. In arithmetic, by topical instructions and 
lessons, this difficulty may be somewhat avoided, but in all other 
branches it necessitates the waste of much time and energy. 
By it the greatest amount of labor is required to produce the 
least results. It is useless to allude to the further evils of such 
courses; they are too well known to all educators. 
What is the remedy? In your circular of information to 
County Superintendents and Directors it is said that the power 
is in the Directors. In nine cases out of ten the Directors are 
the cause of the continuance of the evil, and actually forbid 
the remedy. 
The Supreme Court of the State says that the matter is ex- 
clusively within their discretion, and from this there is no ap- 
 
-P-A-G-E-148
  a4 = 
peal. But why cannot and why ought not our State laws to 
prescribe some uniformity of classification as well as rules for 
the government of the schools? In all seriousness, why cannot 
the rules for the government of the Public Schools of Knox . — 
County be incorporated into the laws of the State of Tennessee ? 
Or why cannot the rules so successfully adopted by many of the 
other States be consulted and improved, if need be, and made 
the law of this State, thereby giving the schools of Tennessee 
a possible system of classification, or at least make possible the 
enforcement, in counties and by counties, and not districts, 
rules of classification, government, and text books? In Knox 
County, by untiring efforts, a great result has probably been ac- 
complished, but it has required the major part of a life-time of 
the best and most active educators of the State. But under 
the law as it is now the whim of a new body of Directors may | 
at any time annul all that has been done, and re-establish the 
primitive method. ‘ 
Besides, there are not ten counties in the State where such 
rules and government could be adopted after ten years of as- 
siduous efforts with the material to deal with in the office of 
School Director as they now exist. 
The plain and direct remedy is to so amend the school law as 
to embrace forthe schools a code of government, proper classi- 
fication, sufficient funds, and uniform text books. 
Respectfully, 
J. 8S. Wurre, 
Superintendent. 
CrarBoRNE County.

Dzar Sir—I have the honor of transmitting to you my 
second annual report. The schools are. all progressing very 
well in the educational work. My report is very incomplete, 
as the County Trustee has not made his financial report, though 
Isent him printed blanks in due time. Some of the District”
-P-A-G-E-149
— 148 — 
Directors have failed to report. Our County Court should levy 
an additional school tax sufficient to run our schools five months 
each year. When this is accomplished Claiborne will glitter as 
a bright star in the firmament of thought. I think it a public 
necessity that physiology and hygiene should be taught in the 
public schools, as physical health is necessary to the highest. 
mental and moral culture. We succeeded, by earnest efforts 
and considerable expense, in holding a Normal Institute for the 
mutual instruction and benefit of our teachers. It was fairly 
successful for the first year. It received favorable comments 
from all teachers who attended. I heard-many of them declare 
that they would attend our institute next year, if possible. I 
feel very grateful to the worthy efforts of Prof. Dodson and 
the other leading citizens of Tazewell for their words of en- 
couragement. We sincerely hope and believe that, by due care 
and labor on our part, aided by the co-operating work of pa- 
trons, teachers, and Directors, 1 may be enabled to report it a 
greater success if I should be re-appointed next year, and that 
my general report may be more correct, encouraging, and com- 
plete than this one is. Each pupil receives eighty cents. There 
are two reasons why the cause of education is not advanced 
more in this county. . One is that we should secure better pro- 
fessionally educated teachers, when possible, who are fitted not 
only by their mental and moral attainments, but who are suited, 
by their natural talents and dispositions, to control, manage, 
and give such physical, mental, and moral instruction as will 
‘arm and equip our young people for the great battle of life. 
We live in a practical or utilitarian age. The educator should 
train each pupil especially for a certain work or profession 
which they are adapted to fill by natural endowment and ineli- 
nation, and thus gain an honest livelihood and lead an intelli- 
gent, honorable, upright, and successful life. The teachers 
should receive more remunerative salaries for their chosen 
work. W.M. Carr, ; 
Superintendent.

Duar Str—I have the honor herewith to submit my annual 
report of the Public Schools of Clay County for the scholastic 
year ending June 30, 1888. 
My report is as nearly correct as possible for me tomake. It 
is almost impossible to get all teachers to fill and return ab- 
stracts, and Directors to make full reports. We have some good 
private and high schools, but Directors fail to report them. 
Trustee has not reported, therefore “receipts” and “ expend- 
itures”’ are left blank in this report. 
Theld three institutes in different parts of the county. All 
were well attended with teachers and patronized by the people. 
The best teachers on all occasions have labored to develop our 
educational interest into a well-ordered system.

Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn. : 
Dzar Str—I have the pleasure of submitting herewith my” 
statistical report of the schools of Coftee County for the pres- 
ent year, 1888. 
I am of opinion that the Public Schools of Coffee County are 
in better condition than they have ever been before. Many of _ 
the teachers of my county are beginning fully to realize the du- 
ties and responsibilities of school teaching, and are up with the —
-P-A-G-E-151
  — 150 — 
best methods, and have their schools under good order and dis- 
cipline, without which no school can possibly be a success. 
I have been quite busy in school work ever since June. I 
held a Teachers’ Normal for the term of six days at Manches- 
ter, ending the 30th day of June last. I enrolled during the 
term the names of about sixty teachers. Quite an interest in 
the cause of education was manifested among those present, 
and I feel assured that the educational interests of my county 
was greatly advanced in consequence of said meeting. 
The most of the public schools in my county open in the 
month of July. Since they opened I have been kept all the 
time busy visiting and lecturing said schools and holding a 
Teachers’ Institute somewhere in the county on Saturday of 
each week. I do not think a County Superintendent can en- 
gage in any school work better calculated to promote the inter- 
est of the public schools of his county than that of holding 
Teachers’ Institutes in the different portions of his county ; 
have all teachers to show their methods of teaching; also 
have them to discuss school topics, which will bring out many 
thoughts and suggestions of much interest and value to’ all. 
Teachers cannot afford to be tardy ; the duties and responsibil- 
ities of school teaching are too great for them to be idle, for 
the best of teachers, if weighed in the balance, will find they 
are wanting. 
In conclusion, I will say while the public schools in my county 
are not altogether what I desire them to be, yet with the sur- 
rounding obstacles they are, I think, doing extremely well. 
The old-time style of teaching in my county has almost 
faded into oblivion. New and better methods of teaching are 
rapidly developing in our midst. I have done all in my power 
to advance the school interests of my county, and feel that my 
labors have not been in vain, but my efforts so far this year 
have been crowned with decided success. We have several fine 
schools running in my county. The graded school of Tulla- 
homa, being in the front rank, is the pride of Coffee County,

Dear Str—I have the honor herewith to present my annual 
report of the Public Schools of Crockett County. The report 
is as nearly correct as I can make it from the papers at my 
command. Our schools are improving, our teachers are more 
efficient, and comfortable school houses are sufficiently conven- 
ient to every child in the county. The prospects for the future 
are brighter than at any time heretofore.

Dear Sir—Inclosed find my report for the scholastic year 
ending June 30,1888. Ido not vouch for the correctness of 
said report in all particulars, since it is almost impossible to 
gather primary facts. School Directors and teachers are gen- 
erally slow about sending in their reports, and there are so 
many who do not understand the dates, instructions, ete., on 
the blanks, that they often give the wrong facts. And again, 
since the scholastic years do not coincide with the official terms 
of the County Superintendents, so that one superintendent is 
obliged to report as to the labors of his successor, and often: 
the record of said labors are not on file.
-P-A-G-E-153

The educational work in old Cumberland is gradually im- 
proving. Our teachers are pursuing better methods of teach- 
ing than formerly—more are taking up the worg-method, 
blackboard drills, written recitations, object lessons, phonetic 
spelling, ete., but we are greatly in need of good school 
houses, apparatus, and money. We cannot expect teachers to 
work for only $22 per month, and for a short term at that. 
Little money means short terms, poor teachers, and poor 
schools. I think a good teacher should have living wages, and 
be kept at the same place at least five years. Letting the school 
to a new teacher every year is like letting a farm every year to 
a new tenant. 
Would it not be better, for awhile, at least, to do less work 
in trying to get up statistics about males and females, and at- 
tendance, and do more trying to procure blackboards, desks, 
seats, stoves, books, slates, pencils, etc.? What is the use of going 
to any great pains to know how many days a boy goes to the 
school house, and doing nothing for his convenience and benefit 
while he is there? The school law should require the school 
houses to be well furnished with blackboards, benches, windows, 
floors, desks, buckets, brooms, maps, charts, chalk, and all 
other necessary furniture, ‘as well as a teacher who will vigor- 
ously make use of said necessities, before the school is allowed 
to begin, and then there could be something to report besides 
blankness. 
If I should suggest a revision of our school law I would say, 
Take about $10,000,000 from the “surplus,” and set it apart 
as a permanent school fund to supplement our own small and 
totally inadequate fund, so that our allowance for current ex- 
penditures would be four or five times what it is now. Then, 
on that foundation, build a structure meeting the demands in 
the way of facilities, system, etc. 
Why not have the first day of January for the first day of 
the scholastic year, and then require reports of Superintendents 
at close of year?

Why not modify the Register of Teachers, so that a teacher 
can classify and grade his school from the record left by his 
successor? What is a record good for if it does not serve some 
such purpose? Why not substitute physiology and hygiene for 
geology, and political economy for the rudiments of agriculture?

Nashville, Tenn. : 
Drar Str—I herewith transmit you my statistical report for 
the year ending June 30, 1888. It is as correct as I can make 
it with the data before me. 
We have 142 public schools in this county, 129 of which are 
in my jurisdiction. During the year I visited most of these 
twice, and some of them three times. I observed their work- 
ings closely and studied them carefully. My “headquarters 
were in my saddle.”” My whole time was given to the work, 
and I have about come to the conclusion that the reason why 
some schools are not more efficient is not because the teachers 
are incapable of properly imparting instruction, nor is it be- 
cause the children are wanting in ability to receive and appro- 
priate good and wholesome instruction, but simply because the 
teachers are afraid of offending somebody; they are too easy; 
they are trying to please everybody at the risk of displeasing 
themselves; they let their pupils do too much as they please. 
Order was the first law of the universe, and it must be the 
guiding star of every teacher who expects to succeed. Indeed, 
successful teaching cannot be done without it. 
I have observed that our most successful teachers are those 
who command the respect of their pupils. 
We had a few schools that accomplished very little, and a lack
-P-A-G-E-155
  —154— « 
of good order was the cause in every instance. I have no doubt 
that I voice the sentiment of all county superintendents when 
I say that good government is the great need of those schools 
that are inefficient. The great body of our schools did most 
excellent work, and I can truthfully say that I am proud of our 
teachers and schools, and point to their achievements with 
pleasure. 
The last Legislature increased the school tax five per cent. on 
the $100 worth of property. Our County Court made an equal 
increase, thus augmenting our school money $32,000 over the 
previous year. This had a fine effect. It gave new life to our 
school work. It stimulated teachers, directors, and schools. 
During the school term two institutes were held each month ; 
one for the white teachers on the first Saturday, and one for the 
colored teachers on the second Saturday. Besides, I held a four 
days’ institute for the white teachers in June, and one of four 
days for the colored teachers in July. All of these were well 
attended, much interest was manifested in them, and I think 
much good accomplished by them. 
I called the School Directors of the county together last year. 
They organized and now meet quarterly. They discuss various 
subjects connected with our schools. Their meetings are very 
interesting, and I think all have been benefited by them. A 
similar organization ought to be effected in every county in the 
_ State. 
I congratulate you on the calling of the County Superintend- 
ents together last December. That was an important step. As 
far as I am capable of judging, I regard it as the most im- 
portant educational move that has ever been made in this State. 
I hope you may be kept at the helm many years. You are the 
right man in the right place. Yours respectfully, 
W. Mack Fugua, 
Superintendent.

Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn.: 
Dear Srr—I have the honor herewith to transmit my report 
of the public schools of this county for the year ending June 
30, 1888. 
It affords me pleasure to state that the schools of this county, 
with a few exceptions, have been doing very good work during 
the past year. Our schools are gradually growing better, but 
the great need of more means and better school houses greatly 
hinders our efforts in educational work. 
In accordance with your instructions I held a County Nor- 
mal Institute of one week’s duration, embracing the first week 
in July. 
Prof. J. A. Hanna, of Saltillo, was with us during the last 
three days of the institute, and rendered valuable service in the 
way of lectures and demonstrations upon blackboards. 
Thirty-six teachers were enrolled and in attendance most of 
the time. The people also manifested more interest than usual, 
and showed their appreciation by a constantly increasing at- 
tendance until the close. 
Several of our teachers were engaged in farming, and owing 
to the previous wet weather were very busy at work during the 
time of the institute, and consequently could not attend the 
necessary three days to admit them to examination. 
For their accommodation I appointed a written examination 
to be held in the Academy at Decaturville on the 27th and 28th 
days of July, 1888. The examination was well attended, and, 
although it was said to be a harder one than the first, I believe 
that it gave general satisfaction to all who attended. Many of 
the teachers were enthusiastic, and said that they must have a 
Normal again next summer.
-P-A-G-E-157
    — 156 — 
Two years ago Prof. M. R. Abernathy, of Purdy, held a 
State Normal Institute here, at which time the teachers adopted 
or recommended a uniform system of text-books, which books 
are now in almost universal use here. 
Directors and people here look to the teachers to take the 
_ lead in regard to what books are used. 
The two District Institutes that I held were well attended by 
teachers and people. At the last one we were favored with a 
sumptuous dinner served upon the grounds on both days of 
the meeting, which, of course, made us feel the hearty weleome 
that had been extended to us in an address by Prof. J. M. 
Moore, one of the teachers of the neighborhood, to whom we 
are greatly indebted for valuable assistance in educational work.

Duar Str—I have the honor herewith to transmit my annual 
report for the scholastic year ending June 30, 1888. Our 
school work has been much improved by the efficient teachers 
sent out last fall. I find, in most districts, the patrons are 
taking a greater interest than any year before. The teachers 
of our county deserve much credit for the interest and energy 
displayed in their school work. We have adopted, or recom- 
mended to our Directors and teachers, a course of study, and in 
most of the schools the books recommended are being used. I 
am glad to say our schools are much improved over last year. 
The only trouble now is the meagerness o our school fund. 
Our schools are so short the teachers cannot do as well as they 
could if the schools were longer. ‘The County Court, it seems, 
are hard to make understand that it is to the interest of the 
county to levy a tax sufficient to run our school five months.

quired by law. , Cheerfully submitted,

Dear Str—I have the honor to herewith transmit my an- 
nual report of Dickson County. I could not say it is strictly 
correct, but it is as nearly so as I could get it. It is nearly an 
impossibility to report this county accurately, on account of 
negligence on the part of clerks and teachers. I have only been 
connected with the schools of this county since July, but I 
think I can say we are making some progress in the educa- 
tional work. We have some tolerably good educators in our 
county, and we also have a few that are a great drawback. 
They are good clever people, and have some learning, but they 
are fifteen or twenty years behind time in the methods of in- 
struction. Upon the whole, though, I would say our schools 
are improving. The attendance has been real good so far. I 
have visited all the schools two or three times.

Deak Sirn—This is my second annual report. I hesitate not 
in stating that this scholastic year has been a success. Our 
people looked well to their balloting last August, the result of
-P-A-G-E-159
  — 158 — 
which is plainly seen. Our schools have improved greatly this 
year. Our teachers have been more energetic, and the tide of 
education has been rapidly flowing in some parts of the county 
allthe year. Our report from the Trustee shows a balance on 
hand of $8,723.53, while the report of my predecessor only 
shows $378.23 in 1886, which is a gain of more than’$8,000 in 
two years. Our Directors are very zealous in the work, and 
our schools have improved at least 25 per cent. this year, and 
it is probable that we will have a ten months’ school next year. 
We have dashed from $13,000 to $21,000 in round numbers in 
two years, with an increasing fund, which is very flattering. 
Surely this is business. We have now as much money as is 
necessary to run our schools eight or nine months, and we ex- 
pect next year, under the assessment law, to run ten months. 
Would to God the people would determine to send their chil- 
dren ten months annually. The day is not far distant when 
the mountain peaks of old Franklin will glow with intelligence 
equal with some of her rich valleys. There are now but few 
obstacles in any superintendent’s way in this county, provided 
he is not afraid of good honest labor.

Duar Str—Herewith I submit to you my second annual re- 
port. I am happy to say that Gibson County is taking no 
backward steps, but is steadily advancing in the improvement - 
and excellency of her schools. The Couns Court, with usual 
liberality, assessed a tax of 30 cents on the $160, and this, 
added to the funds of the State, enables our schools to run 
from six to eight months in a year, according to the number of 
schools in a district. In some instances, by a judicious distribu- 
tion of the houses, we are enabled to run ten months in the 
year on the public funds alone.

  Visitine ScHoous. 
As you will observe, I have visited all the schools in our 
county. During the scholastic year I have made the rounds: 
twice. I can say, with great pride and pleasure, that these 
visits are received with great interest by the teachers and chil- 
dren. In many instances I have prevailed upon the Directors 
to accompany me to their schools, and the examination of the 
scholars in their presence enables them to form an adequate 
idea of the fitness of the teachers. If his work has been either 
good or bad it will come to light by this method. 
But in these examinations I have managed to render myself 
interesting and pleasant to the schools, and have studiously 
avoided a harsh or dictatorial manner. This course enables 
me to secure the good will of the teachers and school, while I 
can find out very accurately what the teacher is worth in his 
theory and practice. I have usually addressed the school before 
leaving, giving words of, cheer and encouragement. 
TracuErs’ INSTITUTE. 
Ihave held an institute about every month, outside of the 
one held the 18th of June under appointment by your authority. 
In that institute, lasting during the week, I am especially in- 
debted to Prof. T. C. Karns, on the part of the State, for’ his 
valuable services, and to Prof. G. R. McGee, of this county; for 
his most excellent series of lectures on the “Science and Art 
of Teaching.” The institute was a decided success. The 
county institutes during the present year have been eminently 
practical. I have always made out the programme for them, 
assigned such work as would prove beneficial in the every-day 
of the school room, and have avoided long-winded, high-flown, 
theoretical papers. Asa result I can report a steady advance 
on the part of our teachers in methods and government. 
Gravina ScHooLs. 
In the beginning of the present year I called the Directors of 
the county together and submitted to them for ratification a 
grade and course of study for our public schools. This, with a
-P-A-G-E-161
    — 160 — 
uniform series of books, was adopted, a printed form of which| 
was placed in the hands of the teachers, and our Directors have 
pledged to see that their teachers conform to its requirements. 
So far I can report that fourteen schools in the county are 
thoroughly and perfectly graded, while many others are mak- 
ing progress in this direction, as well as the length of the school 
in days, the irregularity of attendance, and other unfavorable 
circumstances, will permit. With the present start made I 
think, under the proper supervision, that Gibson County, in the 
next two years, can make considerable progress in the classifica- 
tion of her schools. 
EXAMINATION oF ‘l'HACHERS. 
In this department of my work I have endeavored to con- 
form, as the law requires, myself to your directions. I find, 
however, in this county, it is impracticable to have only two ex- 
aminations, from the fact that constant changes are made in our 
teachers—some going out and some coming in the county. 
Hence, my examinations are more frequent, are always public, 
and are conducted by written and oral questions. In them I 
have tried to be just to the applicant and a friend to the county — 
have endeavored to bring out what the applicant knew, rather 
than what he did not know, and in no instance have I conde- 
scended to petty catches to trap and confuse. 
Buinpine anp Improvement oF Hovszs. 
In my first visit to the schools of the county I found so many 
of our houses too small, improperly constructed and arranged, 
that I determined to give special attention to their improve- 
ment, and, so far as I could, to see that every one built during 
my term of oftice should be properly arranged and furnished. 
I have succeeded in this beyond my expectation. Every house 
newly built is an ornament to our county, and practical im- 
provements in our houses already built have been made, and 
are making all over the county. Many districts are removing 
the old-time desks and replacing new and modern ones, and 
giving larger and better accommodations in the way of black- 
boards, charts, etc. It especially affords me great happiness to  
-P-A-G-E-162
—   — 161 — 
make this part of my report, for to me nothing presents a 
greater evidence of the taste and refinement of a community 
and their love for their public school than a neat and well- 
arranged school building. It is a pity that models for the 
building of our houses had not in the beginning been furnished 
by our County Superintendents to the Directors for the erection 
of our houses. Many errors might have been avoided by this 
course, 
Directors’ Martina. 
I have made it a rule to call the Directors together semi- 
annually to discuss those subjects which affect the good of our 
public schools. In these meetings we have discussed the fol- 
lowing subjects: The Power of Directors; The Distribution of 
the Public Money; Transfers; Uniform Series of Books; 
Course of Study and Grade; The Salary of Teachers, etc. On 
all these subjects the Directors have come to a harmonious 
conclusion, and are uniform in their course and practice. The 
last meeting of this kind was the largest ever held in the 
county, and is certainly a compliment to their zeal and interest 
in our public schools. 
CotorED ScHoots. 
Tam glad to report our colored schools, as a rule, in a pros- 
perous condition. We have some very excellent teachers in 
them, and they are doing a good work. We have one graded 
school in the town of Trenton, in the charge of Prof. Daniels, 
who is an honor to his race. The drawback, however, among 
these schools, especially in the country, is irregularity of at- 
stendance. 
On the whole, we have much to encourage us to go forward 
in the discharge of our duties in educating the minds and 
hearts of the children of our good county. 
With a heart full of love for the work, I have left nothing 
undone in my power to do to raise the standard of education 
in Gibson. I have not only kept the books and discharged 
the office work, but I have been going nearly two-thirds of my

time, visiting schools, holding institutes, and looking after 
such duties as I have heen called upon to do, and as it seemed 
fit that I should do; and if I have been instrumental in doing 
any good for the children of Gibson, I shall feel doubly re- 
warded for the little I have done.

Dzar Sir—In submitting this, my second annual. report of the 
schools and educational work in Giles County, I am glad to say 
that there have been considerable improvements made during the 
last year. I have visited nearly every school in the county, and. 
some of them twice; and find that we need a longer school 
term and more uniformity in text-books and general manage- 
‘ment. The majority of the schools taught have given satisfac- 
tion, and the people in general are taking more interest in 
education. 
Many noble teachers are laboring earnestly for the develop- 
ment of the minds of the youths in their charge. Several new 
school houses have been erected this year, and the old log cabin, 
with its long benches, is giving way to neat school houses with 
patent desks. 
The State Normal Institute held at Martin College, in 
Pulaski, under my supervision, with the assistance of Capt. 
Chas. Douglas, Prof. 8. A. Mynders, Prof. J. L. Lampson, Prof. 
Frank Goodman, and Capt. W. R. Garrett, was quite a success. 
About eighty teachers were in attendance, and a considerable 
interest was manifested on the part of the teachers and the 
citizens of Pulaski. Four other institutes, or teachers’ meetings, 
were held in the four sections of the county, which were very 
well attended.

The institute for the colored teachers held in June was the 
most interesting one ever held in the county. Of the eighty 
colored teachers seventy-two were in attendance. Our colored 
teachers are becoming very much interested in the education of 
their people, and are doing some good work in their schools. 
A meeting of the Directors was held in Pulaski on the 13th 
of October, at which nearly all the districts were represented by 
one to three Directors. A great deal of interest was shown on 
. the part of the Directors, teachers, and a few members of the 
County Court. A uniform system of text books was adopted, 
and a permanent organization was effected to meet quarterly. 
In conclusion, I will say that the educational topic has been 
agitated in our county papers, through the educational column, 
of which I am editor, and I am endeavoring to create a more 
_ favorable popular sentiment in regard to public graded schools.

Dear Str—Inclosed find my second annual report for Grain- 
ger County. I have had several difficulties to contend with in 
getting up the necessary papers to make the report correct. 
Not more than half the clerks handed in their reports, and 
some could not even produce them when I called for them, 
which gave me a great deal of unnecessary trouble. 
We are making considerable progress in the way of having 
better qualified teachers and more suitable houses. Our teach- 
ers generally seem more interested in their work, and many 
more pupils are in school this year than heretofore. Our public 
schools, on the whole, are advancing rapidly in this ‘county. 
Two of the greatest difficulties in our way is lack of money to
-P-A-G-E-165
  — 164 — 
run our schools longer and pay our teachers a better salary, and 
for want of interest among the patrons. Our institutes have 
been well attended this year, and much interest manifested by 
the teachers. 
Our State Normal was a grand success in every respect, ex- 
cept we were disappointed on account of the absence of our 
State Superintendent. Respectfully submitted,

Dear Srr—It is with a very high degree of pleasure that I 
can, with much consistency, inform our honored State Superin- 
tendent of Public Instruction that the good work still goes 
_bravely on in this, the county of Greene. 
In my opinion much more good has been accomplished by 
our public schools than during any year since my election in 
1885. 
From my annual report, which is hereby sent, it will be seen 
that the enrollment, average daily attendance, and length of 
school term is a decided improvement upon last year. “As the 
teacher, so is the school.” As a result of good teaching and 
correct discipline, the schools of our county are, in the main, 
most excellent. This is true, though many have missed their 
calling. We have our imperfections as in days gone. Our 
most reasonable expectations have been, in a few instances, most 
sadly disappointed. Our most earnest and entirely reasonable 
expectations have not, in every case, been met. We need many 
things that, for the many nearer future years, we shall not get. 
Notwithstanding our many disappointments, we continue to 
improve in methods of teaching and of governing as the years 
go by; parents and teachers continue to take a deeper interest
-P-A-G-E-166
  — 165 — 
in the cause of true education as darkness disappears. May 
the Lord bless the children. The heavy weight of responsi- 
bility that does rest upon every true teacher is not, by far, 
fully appreciated. 
The task of shaping the destinies of those who shall direct 
the weal or the woe of this great State, and of the grandest 
republic in the years to come, is neither fully appreciated nor 
compensated. : 
Many who claim to be teachers fail to fill aright this position, 
which is, in point of importance, socially and morally, second 
only to that occupied by the father and mother. But still, the 
good work goes on, and it will continue until the highest degree 
of civilization and enlightenment shall have been obtained. 
. When low, dark, gloomy school houses shall entirely disap- 
pear, as they have already nearly done; when we shall have a 
greater number of school houses constructed in accordance 
with the latest and best models; when the trachers’ position 
shall be an honored and a rumunerative profession, and when 
light and love shall supremely reign—when these welcome days 
shall have come, then those who happily live shall know for 
themselves and not for another, that through good citizenship 
there will be good government. 
All of which is most respectfully submitted.

Duar Str—The school question is being discussed in a gen- 
eral way, and a better feeling is apparent. Ourschools are gen- 
erally in much better condition than formerly. We havea better 
grade of teachers, and more interest, generally, in the schools
-P-A-G-E-167
  — 166 — 
is manifested by the people. I have visited all the schools, 
both public and private, and found them in better condition 
than for a considerable period in the past. Most of the teach- 
ers are well qualified, and I invariably found the schools well 
disciplined, pupils attentive, though the greatest trouble I 
found is to get District Directors interested in the schools; as a 
general thing, they seldom visit the schools of their respective 
districts, and very rarely make their reports in the manner in- 
dicated by law, therefore our statistics are, to some extent, in- 
complete on account of the negligence of the district, clerks. 
But, upon the whole, the schools have and are giving general 
satisfaction. Public opinion is still advancing in favor of pub- 
lie schools. Our greatest needs are good houses and improved 
furniture of the school room. We have established a uniform 
series of text books, and I have been more particular in the 
examination of teachers that they should be graded according 
- to true merit. 
In conclusion, I am proud to report that our County Court, 
as the representatives of the people, has been zealous in sus- 
taining a.good sentiment by levying a liberal tax to carry on 
the noblest work of a county, but hope ere long that we can 
have sufficient funds to have schools eight or ten months 
yearly. Respectfully,

Dear Str—I hereby transmit to you my fourth annual re- 
port of the schools of Hamblen County for the year ending 
June 30, 1888. This report is not absolutely correct, but ap- 
proximately so. With the present facilities for gathering 
Statistics it is impossible to get a correct report. Could the 
Superintendent personally superintend the keeping of every 
register, be in every school the day it closes, and get teachers’
-P-A-G-E-168
  — 167 — 
abstracts, then visit every Director and get his report, he could 
have his own correct. The director, getting no remuneration 
for his services, is rather to be excused than the teacher. If 
every officer were paid for his services, and then required to — 
do that service, under penalty, our schools would be much bet- 
ter, more satisfactory. Q 
Our Normal Institute, held this year, avas the most satis- 
factory we have ever had. More than sixty teachers were in 
attendance. Teachers from other counties were present. 
Among those of our home teachers who delivered lectures 
were Prof. J. G. McFerrin, Rev. A. B. Phipps, and Miss Sallie 
Loop. Among those from a distance were J. D. Bible, War- 
rensburg; Prof. Chas. Mason, Jonesboro; Prof. MeCord, 
Texas, and Mrs. McKinney, Kentucky, all of whom ren- 
dered valuable service, and added much to the interest. The 
latest, most approved methods were presented, and, in visiting 
the schools, I find the teachers using them as best they can in 
their schools. In fact, most of our teachers have departed 
. from the old “twenty-years-ago-style,” and teach the “new ed- 
ucation ” altogether. 
I should do the colored teachers an injustice not to say that 
the outlook for them is not less hopeful. They are not on a 
“stand-still,” neither far behind in methods. Many of them 
are working faithfully, as I believe, for the good of their race. - 
Of course our schools are not what we would wish them, but 
in this age of development they cannot but be better. The 
time was when, to teach a public school, was considered dis- 
graceful, but that is a Silurian idea, and is giving way to the 
more modern—better men and women enter the work, and are 
making the people feel that the public schools are a necessity. 
I but do justice to some of my teachers to say that they pre- 
pare many of their pupils for college, teaching branches far 
above the public school curriculum. There is no reason why 
the public school may not be as efficient as any other. 
Efficient teachers can make them so. The public school ought 
 
-P-A-G-E-169
  — 168 — 
to give the child a practical business education. Such things 
as he will need should be taught, and in such a way as to make 
them practical. J. ReCox;

Dear Srr—I beg leave to submit herewith my annual report 
for the scholastic year ending June 30,1888. With pleasure do 
we invite our worthy State Superintendent to pass along the 
line and see what has been done during the past year. 
At a convention of School Directors held in Chattanooga, 
April 2d, a uniformity of text books and a course of study 
were adopted for a period of six years. The books are now 
uniform in nearly all of the schools, and not a school in the 
county is left ungraded. The course of study embraces seven- 
grades—the first being the primary grade. Under this system 
all pupils who complete the studies prescribed, and pass a satis- 
factory examination, will be entitled to a diploma signed by the 
teacher, the School Board, and the County Superintendent. 
Three pupils, Miss Mollie B. Varner, Mr. John W. Roberts, 
and Mr. B. K. Reynolds have already graduated and received 
their diplomas. Some fifteen or twenty pupils will complete the 
course during the present term. In this respect Hamilton 
County stands first, as no other county in the State has a system 
of graduating pupils from the public school. One great end to 
be obtained by offering diplomas is to increase the average at- 
tendance of the larger pupils, and it is having the desired effect. 
Two State Normal Institutes, one for white and one for col- 
ored teachers, were held during the summer, in which much 
good was accomplished. The institute for white teachers was 
the first ever held in the county, and its effects have already
-P-A-G-E-170
  — 169 — 
been realized in the various schools. The teachers were highly 
pleased with the efficient work of Prof. T. C. Karns and other 
prominent educators who were present. It was unanimously 
agreed that a Normal Institute be held in the county annually. 
The teachers’ monthly meetings have increased in attendance 
about one hundred per cent. over that of last year, which indi- 
cates very clearly that our schools are being improved, for “as 
the teacher is so is the school.” 
I cannot close this report without saying that great credit is 
due our teachers and Directors for valuable assistance rendered 
in working so harmoniously with us in every undertaking. 
With few exceptions they have been faithful in discharging 
their duties, and have one common end in view—the propaga- 
tion of the Public Schools of Hamilton County. We feel that 
our efforts have been crowned with at least some degree of 
success, and hope that better results may be obtained in the 
near future. Very respectfully submitted, 
Huen D. Hurraxnr, 
Superintendent.

Duar Str—L hereby transmit to you my annual report, which 
Iam forced to say is not as correct in every instance as it should 
be, but I can do no better under the circumstances. Ourschools, 
it seems, are prospering exceedingly well this year, the greatest 
and only trouble is that we have not a suflicient amount of 
school money. Hope our court will open up on this question 
uext year. ‘

Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction,

Duar Srr—I herewith present my second annual report, and 
I take great pleasure in stating that there is very little guess 
work in it, as it is made up strictly from the Trustee’s report, 
the teachers’ abstracts, and the Directors’ reports. 
The State Institute held here last summer by Ex-Superin- 
tendent Paine, although it came off at a very unpropitious time, 
had a very beneficial effect on the teachers of the county; and 
the universally expressed desire is that we may have another 
next summer. 
Upon reviewing the whole ground, I think we are steadily 
advancing’ at every point. Teachers are grading higher and 
doing better work, the children are more docile, and the parents 
are manifesting greater interest in having good school houses 
and in obtaining better teachers. Directors, since they have 
been “qualified,” are more particular to visit the schools under 
their care, and to exercise greater promptness in making their 
reports. P 
I respectfully submit that many of the districts are very 
sparsely settled, and have oftentimes very few colored people in 
them, and that their “pro rata” is insufficient even to pay a 
“second grade teacher.” Would it not be better to authorize 
County Superintendents to issue a “third grade certificate” in 
certain cases, limited to first four branches, than for them to 
grow up in utter illiteracy ? 
And, I would respectfully ask, would it not be better for the 
“scholastic year” to conform to the ‘calendar year,” that the 
school work might be shown up in a form readily seen and of 
present interest? By the present system, schools taught since 
“June 30th,” or during the summer and fall, will not be re- 
ported until next October, and it will be the second summer be- 
fore they are tabulated and published in the State Superintend-
-P-A-G-E-172

ent’s report. By that time they are not likely to present a cor- 
rect view of the educatignal status, and they will be so very 
ancient as to excite no particular interest. 
Respectfully submitted, 
W. B. Smita, 
Superintendent.

Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn.: 
Duar Sin—Notwithstanding the fact that our school term was 
shorter than on previous years, our teachers have made con- 
siderable progress. 
Your State Normal gave the impetus, and our institutes, to- 
gether with rigid written examinations, have kept up a con- 
tinual forward movement. 
By persistent effort our County Court was induced to raise 
the rate on realty from ten to twenty cents on the hundred dol- 
lars. This, together with the increase in the rate of the State, 
gave us $3,000 more funds than we have ever had before—an 
amount sufficient to have carrried on the school nearly five 
months; but the school fund was overdrawn over $4,000 previ- 
ous to 1887, and the greater part of this amount had to be paid 
from funds due for 1887. The outlook, financial and otherwise, 
is very favorable. 
I send with this letter the report which the Trustee made to 
me. You will see that he has not kept any record of how the 
money was expended, and my report is made out from my own 
knowledge of the expenses, and includes $126.50 paid me for 
certificates, which his does not contain. 
The rate on privileges is thirty-three and one-third per cent. 
My report does not contain this. 
Yours respectfully, 
P. L. Cos,

Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn. : 
Dear Str—Inclosed you will find my fourth annual statistical 
report. It is necessarily imperfect, but it is approximately cor- 
rect. Our schools have improved in efficiency; our policy has 
been to concentrate the schools into as few as practicable; this 
has, in many of the districts, been accomplished. It will be 
completed during the next year, and cannot fail to greatly im- 
prove the schools of this county. The schools are better, but 
there is one cause of dissatisfaction among the white portion 
of our population. The whites have to pay nearly all of the 
taxes, and the colored people get the lion’s share in the distri- 
bution. This condition is not favorable to the public schools, 
and prevents them from having the support of popular favor. 
Our money matters have also been managed badly. When the 
schools are left to the direction and control of the several coun-
-P-A-G-E-174
    — 173 — 
ties the public schools must necessarily suffer from unfortunate 
conditions existing within the county. The school system can- 
not be uniformly healthy and prosperous in all the counties 
alike under the present arrangement. We should have an ef- 
ficient State system or abolish them. . 
It is conceded that supervision is indispensable to efficient 
schools, but why should superintendents continue to visit them 
without any power over the schools? If any thing is wrong, 
can he correct it? Can he make any changes that he deems 
necessary? He should have some power besides the simple 
right to suggest and persuade Directors. Institutes are an ac- 
complished fact in this county, and considering the time since 
they have been inaugurated have been well attended, but still 
there should be provision made by the Legislature for insti- 
tututes and requiring teachers to attend. 
Directors should be required to meet once in each year to 
consider school matters of the several districts. 
Respectfully, 
W.R. Lerten, 
Superintendent. 
Henperson County. 
Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn. : : 
Dear Str—In sending you my statistical report of the schools 
of Henderson County I might safely rest ny case and let them 
teach their own lesson; but as I see some improvement—a 
larger daily average attendance—I feel that I ought to say so 
and gladly report that fact. While the schools are nothing like 
what they ought to be, I have done, and I am still doing, all I 
know how to do, with our limited means, to make them more 
efficient and to increase the public interest in their behalf. I 
am glad to be able to report that our cause is growing, and I 
sincerely believe that our efforts are sure to succeed. 
Our greatest difficulty is the want of money, and not until
-P-A-G-E-175
    —174— 
we can secure a larger fund can we make that progress that is 
so much desired. 1 hope our wise men and statesmen will de- 
vise some means to raise the necessary funds to educate every 
child in the State, so that at an early day there will be none 
unable to read the Lord’s Prayer. 
If Henderson, with many other counties similarly situated, 
had that portion of the school fund that rightfully belongs to 
her, her schools would be much, more prosperous. Under the 
present school law the taxes levied for school purposes are col- 
lected und disbursed in the respective counties where collected. 
Hence, the counties through which the railroads run that were 
built by State aid are now taxed solely for the benefit of these 
fortunate counties, which works a great injustice to the poorer 
counties. When the State collects taxes to pay the interest on 
the bonds that were issued to build these roads she does not 
stop to collect it all in the counties through which the roads are 
operated, but collects it from all the people of the State alike, 
and it is but a simple act of justice that all the people and every 
county in proportion to its population should share alike and 
be made equal with every other county in the State in the ben- 
efits derived from the revenue raised by taxing this railroad 
property built by a common people. It only has to be stated to 
be admitted that it is a wrong that ought to be speedily cor- 
rected, to suffer a few rich counties through which these roads 
run and have otherwise received the greatest benefits from their 
construction, to withhold the money that rightfully belongs to 
the children of other counties and to appropriate it to them- 
selves. I hope the attention of the next Legislature will be 
specially called to this glaring act of injustice, and that this 
wrong will be promptly corrected by the representatives of a 
generous people. 
Too much credit cannot be given to our able and energetic 
State Superintendent of Public Instruction for his untiring and 
zealous efforts to make our schools something like they ought 
to be. He has organized annual meetings of the County Su- 
_perintendents, which will doubtless .be useful and beneficial to 
_ those who attend. Indeed, he has done nobly in trying to cre- 
ate a grand State system of public schools. ®

Dnar Srr—Inclosed find my second annual report. You will 
find the attendance not so good as it was last year, owing to the 
following: The County Court appointed a Commission to lay 
off the county into “school districts.” The Commissioners 
went to work and effected the desire of the court. This gave 
rise to great dissatisfaction among the people, and the court 
received a great many appeals to rescind the action. This they 
finally did, but not until the whole school interest was in a de- 
moralized and unsettled condition. 
It would consume too much time and space to enumerate all 
the troubles through which we have passed in consequence of 
the above. 
The schools are moving on all right now, and, with few ex- 
ceptions, we have more efficient teachers than ever before. 
Our Institute in July was pronounced a brilliant success by 
all who attended, and, I think, by another year there will not 
bea “ moss-back” in the county. New methods are being in- 
troduced with good results, and progress seenis to be the watch- 
word of most of our teachers. 
Lhave started out this fall with the intention to visit every 
school in the county, and to give tone and direction to the whole 
educational work of this county. 
Very respectfully,

Hon. Frank M. oe State Superintendent of Public eee 
Nashville, Tenn.: 
Dear Srr—In submitting to you my second annual report I 
feel that no effort has been withheld to make it complete. How 
well this has been done is for you to decide. 
All the sub-districts have been contirmed by our County Court 
this year, making a total of thirty-four. The teachers do not 
pay two dollars for.a certificate now as they did. The County 
Court voted a salary for the first time in many years. Visiting 
schools has been a very special feature in my work. Theories 
of teaching should receive much attention, yet I find much de- 
pends upon my visit to the school to see how well these theories 
are executed. 
Examinations receive due consideration. No time is spared 
in this work, as I find by experience that some teachers attempt 
too much in preparing to teach; the result—much gone over and 
litile learned. It is a fact beyond controversy that all graduates 
who hold diplomas are not qualified to teach. A teacher of 
real merit is willing to show in his examination the knowledge 
he possesses. Hence it is growing to be.a maxim that good 
teachers like to stand on real merit, while inferior ones must 
do so. 
Humphreys County needs a State Normal. We have not 
asked before we could accommodate teachers in every respect, 
In Waverly, which is unsurpassed for health and all that is de- 
sirable, there is a good college building, hotels, and nice private 
boarding houses. 
If I could say “money to educate” so loud that it would 
ring in the ears of our Representatives and Senators from Car- 
ter to Shelby, I feel that a mighty chorus would be ready to 
redouble its volume and sincerity till money would come. Small 
salaries drive instead of drawing good teachers. Humphreys 
County cannot afford to lose good teachers. i

Dear Str—I herewith transmit to you my annual report for 
the year 1888, which has been delayed on account of some of 
the District Clerks of my county failing to make their reports 
on time. 
I am glad to make a favorable report of the condition of the 
schools in my county. I have devoted a great deal of my time 
in securing good teachers, in fact, it has been my principal 
work. I announced last year that I would not give any person 
a certificate this year who did not fully come up to the standard 
prescribed by law, and I am now fully prepared to state to you 
that I have adhered to that resolution strictly, which I think 
has been attended with satisfactory results not only to myself, 
but with the people. I have had the nerve to refuse incompe- 
tent persons certificates in every instance, believing that we 
had better have no schools rather than have them toughp by 
incompetent persons. 
I have visited most of the schools of my county. I was ac- 
companied by my friend, Hon. James Haigs, our present 
Chairman of the County Court, who made the duty more pleas- 
ant to me, and he also gave to the teachers and children of the 
county words of encouragement and advice that will, no doubt, 
sink deep into their minds, and prove of great benefit to them 
in forming their future characters and making them useful 
men and women in society. If our county was filled up with © 
such men we would make more rapid strides in point of educa- 
tion and enterprise, and a revolution from the lethargetic spirit 
to that of activity would take place, forming an “epoch” of 
Jackson County’s school interest which has never yet dawned — 
_ upon us. I must, before I close, compliment the various Dis- 
trict Directors of my county for their promptness in visiting 
the schools of our county, which had, no doubt, a good effect 
on teachers, students, and the people.

Dear Str—I herewith submit my second annual report of 
James County for the scholastic year ending June 30, 1888. 
This report is full, but approximately correct. From the fail- 
ure of Directors to make full reports, I am forced to say ap- 
_ proximately correct. I find, upon examination, that teachers 
have failed to make full abstract reports, and, as I desired to 
make a full report, I had to ride over the county and get the 
report as best I could; and it is as nearly correct as I could 
make it under the circumstances. 
Our schools are doing good work this year, but there is room 
for improvement. Last June I held a Normal School of tive 
days, and I find that it has promoted our schools wonderfully. 
While our scholastic population has increased only about sev- 
enty-five, our enrollment has increased two hundred. Our 
average daily attendance has increased about one hundred and 
thirty-four over last year. I want this normal work to con- 
tinue to grow in our thriving little State until the fogies, with 
their whip-lash method of bossism, to the neglect of drawing out 
the mental faculties, shall have faded away, and there shall be 
none left to advocate the cause of fogyism. But while I am 
strongly indorsing the normal method, I as strongly denounce 
the abuse of it practiced in some of our so-called normals. 
I find two kinds of work under the head of normal instrue- 
tions; the one is the how, and the other the do. One theorizes 
and lectures on how.to instruct, and the other has the subjects
-P-A-G-E-180
—179 — 
  themselves and performs the work (small children are the best 
subjects). Some teachers can go to these so-called normals and 
tell all about how to teach from some little item he has seen in 
some one’s writing on theory, and make grand displays on 
teaching. These teachers are never awake to their duty, except. 
on the institute days in most cases. Go to their schools and 
find them dead to the interests of their pupils. 
My conception of a normal is, a do-the-work, or rather have 
it done by the pupils, and not a tell-the-how, and do all the 
telling yourself. Teachers and superintendents, lets have a do 
normal in every cuunty in the State next year. 
It was my official duty to appoint eight School Directors last 
year, as they failed to hold an election, and I appointed literary 
men, when they could be had—men who are competent. Quite 
a dissatisfaction prevails with some of the favorites, knowing 
that the appointments are for three years, and that the appoint- 
ees are men who pay but little attention to those egotistical 
statements, but more to merit—that is what we need. 
One of the greatest impediments in our school work is in- 
competent, short-sighted, prejudiced School Directors, who want 
the office that they may wreak vengence and appease their prej- 
udices. The Legislature ought.to enact some law by which 
this can be ratified, by saying that no man shall be eligible to 
the office of School Director unless he possesses certain qualifi- 
cations, and that he shall make his report to the County Su- 
perintendent on or before the first of September, and that the 
Clerk and Directors shall receive some fees for their official 
work, and shall be subject to a fine if they fail to attend to this 
work. 
I have spent the past two weeks visiting schools, and I must 
say they are doing well. Our colored teachers also are wide- 
awake. Iam sorry the County Court cannot pay me to make 
my “ headquarters in the saddle,” but am glad that I can spend 
some of my time in the delightful work of county schools with 
my limited salary.

You will notice that the amount on hand July 1st is $916.02, 
subject to releasements of the County Court, and I do not 
know how much that is; hence I cannot make the receipts and 
expenditures balance. 
T conclusion, I would not suggest the exchange of geology 
for physiology, as some have suggested, but would suggest that 
we amend the public school course so as to include algebra 
(elementary), physiology, hygiene, vocal music, and Peterson’s 
Familiar Science. This would make our public schools better, 
and would save sending the children to the academy, and we 
could pay the teachers more, and thereby elevate the standard 
of public schools. Respectfully,

-P-A-G-E-182
— 181 — 
  blanks left under the ‘“‘ Receipts and Expenditures” that I have 
not reported those items, which is from no other cause than that 
I vould not get a report from the Trustee. I furnished him 
with two blanks, and made repeated calls on him for the 
same, but could not get the report. Our schools are very good. 
You will see, by comparing the number of days taught for 
1888 with the sathe for 1887, that there is a considerable increase 
in the length of our school term. I think there will still be a 
greater increase in the future, so we may have at least seven 
months of public free schools. The schools for the present 
year have nearly all been in operation from five to eight weeks, 
and seem to be in good condition, with as great a number en- 
rolled as usual, if not greater. There seems to be a disposition 
among a great many of the districts to establish graded schools. 
Some ‘have built houses for that purpose, and many more are 
being erected, the purpose of which is to supplement their 
school terms, and give nine to ten months in the year. I hope 
to see the day when our school system of Tennessee may be 
equal if not superior to any system in other States.

the scholastic year ending June 30, 1888. I am glad to say 
that our schools are in a very prosperous and healthy condi- 
tion, and running without much friction. My official report 
will show that we have a scholastic population of 13,000, out- 
side of Knoxville, 132 schools, 150 teachers, a uniform system 
of text books, and all the schools graded. All of our school 
houses, with a few exceptions, are frame, neat and spacious, and 
wearing a beautiful “coat of white.” Our scholastic popula- 
tion has increased 1,123 since my last report. During the year 
we have erected six splendid frame school houses at an ex- 
pense of $3,750, and furnished them with good desks and black~ 
boards and other apparatus.

Each teacher and Director is furnished with a copy of the 
“ Course of Study and Rules for the Government of the Schools,” 
consequently the same system and methods are taught in every 
school in the county. 
Last July I held two Normal Institutes, one for the white 
and one for the colored teachers. We endeavored to make 
each institute a model school, interesting and practical. There 
were a large attendance of teachers in each, all of whom were 
deeply interested, and Iam confident that great good was ac- 
complished. : 
I visited all of our schools except a few that closed earlier 
than usual, and some I visited a second time. I made a short 
talk in about 125 schools, to which the children always listened 
attentively—seemed anxious for advice. I never was more 
pleased with the result of our Normal Institutes than I was last 
year. In the schools of those who attended the institutes I ob- 
served that they had better order, more interest, and were doing 
better and more systematic work; and also had a good attend- 
ance. Whispering in many of our schools is entirely sup- 
pressed. 
The outlook for our schools is more favorable than ever be- 
fore. They are a fixed thing, and regarded as indispensable by 
all classes. The sentiment in their favor is gradually growing 
stronger. Our Honorable County Court, at its January term, 
levied an additional school tax of five cents on the hundred 
dollars’ worth of property. Under the new assessment law the 
property of the county is assessed nearly 40 per cent. higher 
than it was last year. It was raised from $10,632,718 to $14,- 
631,850, so our school fund will be nearly doubled by reason of 
the additional tax levied and the increased valuation. of the 
property. Our school tax is as follows: From the county on 
property, 25 cents; on privileges, 10 cents; on polls, 50 cents; 
and from the State on property, 15 cents; on polls, 100 cents; 
and from the Permanent State School Fund, about 25 cents per 
capita of the scholastic. So we shall soon be operating upon a © 
safe financial basis. The majority of our School Directors
-P-A-G-E-184
  — 183 — 
are honest men, worthy and well qualified, prompt in business, 
and work in concert with the County Superintendent, and ex- 
pend the school fund of their district judiciously; but we have 
a few ignoramuses who contend that a teacher should teach for 
the wages of an ordinary farm hand, and by reason of their 
dark, impenetrable ignorance, are not controllable. 
Ido not hesitate to say that the greatest barrier to public 
schools is the election of illiterate and totally unqualified men 
for School Directors. ; 
The school law should be so amended as to give County Su- 
perintendents more power, and School Directors less. 
We have a large corps of earnest, energetic teachers, ladies 
and gentlemen, who are laboring zealously for the amelioration 
of our youth from the bondage of illiteracy, and instilling into ~ 
their young minds lessons of morality, for which they will not 
receive a full compensation till their work here is ended and 
they hear from the great Teacher, “ Welldone, good and faith- 
ful servants.”

Dzar Str—I have the honor to transmit to you my annual 
report of the Public Schools of my county for the scholastic 
year ending June 30, 1888. A comparison of my last with the 
previous reports shows a decidedly improved condition of our 
financial management, a large enrollment, increase in the num- 
ber of schools, and teachers employed, ete. ae 
I recommend, or rather suggest to you for recommendation — 
to our next General Assembly, a re-enactment of the law re-
-P-A-G-E-185
   — 184— 
quiring school warrants to be approved by County Superintend- 
ents, as this will give exact financial accuracy to our reports, 
tend to prevent careless drawing of school warrants, and at the 
same time give County Superintendents the necessary informa- 
tion as to amount of district funds on hand from time to time, 
so they can impart it to the Directors and thereby prevent their 
overdrawing and getting in debt. This is the only way I see 
to retnedy the evil. I hope that you may see fit to recommend 
this to our Legislature. Proper blanks should also be furnished 
the Directors to draw their warrants on, as their offices are not 
lucrative, and this expense of the office ought not to fall on 
them. Respectfully, 
L. Donatpson, 
Superintendent. 
LavupurpaLe County. 
Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashwille, Tenn.: 
Dzar Sir—I regret exceedingly that I have necessarily been 
delayed in sending in my report, but the trustee only gave me 
his report on the 28th (he promised surely to let me have it last 
week, hence my promise to yourself). I also regret that my 
report is not accurate in regard to several items, owing to a 
failure on the part of Directors to send in their reports, and 
teachers to send in abstracts, and my report is made from such 
as have been sent in and from my own observation. As to pri- 
vate schools I have to rely wholly upon my own observation. 
You will see that the average attendance at school is de- 
plorable, owing to the indifference on the part of parents to 
make use of educational advautages for their children. 
There is no. charge for the examination of teachers, but I 
think there really ought to be, if for no other purpose than to. 
supply suitable desks and seats, together with blackboards, ete. 
I think you would agree with me could you see some of the 
primitive furniture for school rooms—slabs laid across sassafras 
blocks for seats and a plank put up by the side of the house for 
writing, and no desks at all.

This is a very large county, and it is almost impossible for a 
superintendent to visit all the schools during the short duration 
of school term, unless he give every school day for that pur- 
pose, and the salary is not by any means adequate for that pur- 
pose. I have endeavored to raise the standard for teachers, for 
which there was, and is still, much room, which has caused 
some dissatisfaction in some localities. I have endeavored in 
my work this year to comply with-your suggestions in your 
cireular letter as far as possible.

Dear Sir—Gathering public school statistics, as County 
Superintendents are forced to do, is a slow, tedious, and vexing 
task. This is the eighth annual report I have made. I find it 
a hard task to get Directors to respond when asked for their 
reports. This report shows an increase in enrollment and daily 
attendance. We think the educational outlook in this county 
is much better than ever before. Our State and County Normal 
Institute was a success. Quite a number of teachers were 
present, and all showed a deep interest in their calling. Our 
teachers are on the right line and pressing forward; most of 
them are worthy men and women, and well qualified. When a 
uniformity of text books has been thoroughly established in all 
our schools, when the equalization plan has been established 
throughout the county, when all our public schools are graded, 
when the General Assembly passes a compulsory school law, 
and the Blair Educational bill has become a law, then the pub- 
lic schools in our county and throughout the State will reach 
the height of their glory. May the good Lofd hasten the time 
when these things shall be so. 
Very respectfully, 
Joun W. Hypen, 
Superintendent.

Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn. : 
Dear Srr—I herewith submit my second annual report. By 
comparing with my report for last year you will find that the 
enrollment and average attendance are less this year, though 
the length of school and pay of teachers are greater. The 
attendance at the present time is not what is desired, however 
there is more interest manifested by the public than heretofore. 
The work of building goes on slowly, but the time is not far 
distant when this county will have comfortable school houses. 
It is difficult to get the Directors to see the utility of building 
good size houses; however, the number of good houses is in- 
creasing encouragingly. 
In September, 1887, we held a meeting of the teachers and 
Directors of the county to select and adopt a uniform series of 
text books, and since that time have been using every effort 
possible to get said series introduced throughout the county, 
though I have not been as successful as I desired, yet most all 
schools have introduced a part of the series with some prospects 
for the remainder to follow soon. 
The institute work for the year has been a success. I report 
four teachers’ meetings, one of which was a meeting of teachers 
and Directors for the selection and adoption of a series of text 
books. In the institute the teachers seemed anxious to learn 
the’ best methods, and afterward were willing to put them into 
practice. The teachers for the present year are mostly young 
men and women of undisputed ability, who are deeply interested 
in the cause of education, and are determined to discharge their 
duties faithfully. However, we still have some teachers that 
take no pains to keep up with the advancement in educational 
thought. The teachers and people of the county are very 
anxious to have a State Normal next summer at Latayette. 
And should our ‘present State Superintendent be re-appointed 
I hope he will take the matter into earnest consideration and, 
if possible, send us some help next year.

Dear Str—In submitting my second annual report I take 
pleasure in stating that there is a marked improvement in the 
schools of my county. This results mainly from the fact that 
our teachers are yearly becoming better qualified for their 
chosen work. 
Sixty teachers attended our County Institute this year, every 
one of whom seemed not ouly to find pleasure in the exercises, 
but to manifest a lively interest in every thing that was said and 
done. The discussion of primary teaching excited the greatest 
interest, and I have already seen the good result in many of our 
county schools. The teachers are beginning to take and read 
good educational journals, and I regard this as affording prom- 
ises for the future. Wherever I find a good, enthusiastic teacher 
I find a full attendance of pupils and interested patrons. Good 
teachers certainly make good schools, and our greatest need is 
more such teachers. Respectfully, 4

Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn. : 
Dear Str—I herewith submit my annual report of the Pub- 
lic Schools of McMinn County. I am very much gratified with 
the schools this year. With a few exceptions they are good, 
and moving on nicely. The majority of the Directors and peo- 
ple are working hard to improve and build up their schools. 
The annual Normal Institute, which was held in this county 
last June, was well attended—about forty-five teachers in at- 
tendance. Many questions pertaining to the school work were 
discussed. The teachers’ monthly meetings, which are held in 
different parts of the county, add very materially to our suc- 
cess. We consider these educational meetings indispensable in 
the propagation of our public schools, and would recommend 
them to be held in every county in the State. 
During the past two years I have done every thing in my 
power to advance the educational interest of my county, and I 
am proud that many changes for good have been wrought. It 
affords me much pleasure to say that the schools of McMinn 
County are steadily pressing their way to the front, and we 
hope ere long to see them take the lead. 
Very respectfully,

Dear Srr—In submitting my annual report for the year end- 
ing June 30, 1888, I have tried to make it as accurate as pos- 
sible. Unfortunately our County Court, at its January term, 
1887, subdivided our county into eighty-seven school districts, 
making it necessary to elect three Directors in each one of these 
divisions, which has been the cause of much confusion. It has
-P-A-G-E-190
— 189 — 
    
- thrown a great deal of unnecessary labor on the Superin- 
tendent. To the shame of this age of progress and advance- 
ment, a large per cent. of these Directors can neither read 
nor write, and in nearly every instance they failed to make any 
statistical report to me of matters of interest required of them 
by our school laws. I had to get up these items myself, by much 
labor and self-sacrifice, which has delayed my report nearly two 
weeks. Under the present inefficient school law many teachers 
failed to send in their abstracts, and when we did not visit such 
districts we could only approximate our report. I hope the 
time is not far distant when the school law will be so amended 
that every officer connected with our Free School System will be 
forced to make a full statistical report of all matters of any in- 
terest to our schools. We are happy to report that we can see 
a marked improvement in our schools from year to year. Our 
. schools are well organized, and generally pretty well graded. 
They have the confidence and the earnest support of the masses. 
Too much cannot be said in praise of the majority of our 
teachers, both white and colored. Many of them are graduates 
of high seats of learning, and have done much to popularize 
and give education a great impetus in this section. We have 
- discarded all old methods, and they lie buried in the great ocean 
of the past, and new and more practical methods have taken 
their places. The Teachers’ Institute is a great power in the i 
land for good. It has done much to awaken intelligent thought 
in the teachers, and it has also done much to arouse the latent 
energies in the masses, and would direct them in intelligent 
action. I have held two Teachers’ Institutes in this county 
during this scholastic year. Two of these were County Nor- 
mals; one for the white and one for the colored teachers. 
They were well attended. Much good was done. Too much | 
cannot be said in favor of these Teachers’ Institutes. They are 
the very life of the progressive teacher, and have done more to 
educate the masses and mold the public mind in favor of a 
higher education than any other one power extant. We wish, — 
in this public manner, to return our sincere thanks and the 
thanks of the public to Profs. W. B. Romine and M. R. 
Abernathy for their disinterested, devoted, and efficient labors 
in our County Normal Institute last June. They have done
-P-A-G-E-191
  — 190 — 
much by their earnest, intelligent, and enthusiastic labors in in- 
stitutes, and also by teaching, to introduce advanced thoughts 
and methods into our schools, and thus helping much to place 
them upon a higher plane of efticiency.

Dear Str—I have the honor herewith to submit my second 
annual report. It gives me pleasure to know and be able to 
state that our schools are a decided success this year. A ma- 
jority of our teachers have enlisted in the work heart and soul, 
and apparently have determined to maintain the dignity of the 
profession, regardless of obstacles that may be encountered. 
Our school fund is not sufficient to support our schools as 
fully as they ought to be. I hope our County Court will supply 
the deficiency in the future by levying an additional tax. The 
people, generally, are taking unusual interest in educational 
affairs, which will undoubtedly lead to greater conquests in the 
future. 
I held a Normal Institute at Decatur, beginning July 2, and 
continuing five days. It was well attended by the teachers of 
the county. Quite a number of teachers and educational friends 
from adjacent counties were also in attendance. Prof. S. W. 
Gage, Superintendent of Roane County, was with us in-our 
Normal, and represented the State. Prof. Gage is an able man, 
and his services were invaluable. Others skilled in the art of 
teaching were present, and rendered effective aid. 
Our schools, with but few exceptions, are using the adopted 
series of text-books, hence they are being very well classified. 
Yours respectfully, 
J. L. Bucknar,

Drar Str—While the school work of the present year, 
1887-8, has not been crowned with that success so much de- 
sired by enthusiastic educators, yet it has . moved along 
smoothly and in a progressive manner. The Directors, as a 
class, are prompt, efficient, and capable, and in nearly every in- 
stance have sent in their various reports on time. They are 
beginning to realize the fact that teachers who have no higher 
ambition than just to teach a short term, at a small salary, 
merely to enable them to do something else, are really the most 
costly teachers that can be employed, and that to meet the ap- 
probation of an inquiring and discerning public, competent, 
energetic, and wide-awake teachers, who are earnestly enlisted 
in the work, must be secured. As a consequence, during the 
past year I have not been able to supply the demand for first- 
class teachers. I am much gratified to note the marked im- 
provement in the colored teachers of the county. Education 
among the colored people is certainly on the upward incline. 
During the past year we have built nine neat frame houses, and 
two comfortable log ones, and repaired and otherwise made 
comfortable others heretofore used. Many of these and others 
are seated with. the improved desk, and furnished with all of 
the conveniences of the modern school room. 
Financially, we are in good condition. Our county is en- 
tirely free from any school debt. We had on hand June 30, 
1888, a cash balance of $22,893.92, which is $5,376 more than 
we had last year at same date. Our efficient Trustee makes _ 
regular reports of all school money on hand due the different 
districts, and has these reports published in the county papers. 
The clerk of any district, any day, can know the exact amount 
due his district. 
In my opinion, no better evidence of the healthy condition 
of our schools exists than the fact that they are receiving aid 
and encouragement from all classes of our people. As an evi-
-P-A-G-E-193
— 192 — 
dence of this, the attendance during the past year has in- 
creased nearly 14 per cent., while there has been but a slight 
gain in the scholastic population and enrollment, this too, in 
face of the fact that in two districts the schools were suspended 
that new and better houses might be built.

Drar Sir—Inclosed you will find my report for Monroe 
County for the scholastic year ending June 30,1888. It is as 
full as I can get it. Some of my teachers failed to return me 
an abstract of their school. I had to approximate forthem. I 
think, however, it is correct in the main. 
‘We have had some trouble over the equalization system. 
Some of our best lawyers argue that as the money comes from 
the State to counties by the head, and then from counties to 
the districts according to scholastic population, it should con- 
tinue on down from the district to the subdistrict by the same 
law. Our county is so mountainous that it is impossible to 
locate the houses so as to give each an equal number of pupils.

delay—I herewith submit this my second report of Moore 
 
-P-A-G-E-194
  — 193 — 
  County. I have tried to be as accurate as possible in every 
particular. As some of the Directors and teachers did not 
make any report, while I rode and visited some to get their re- 
-port, I did not have time to see them all, but.hope that my re- 
port will be satisfactory. As my salary is very small I cannot 
devote as much time to school interests as I desire, yet I have 
visited all of my schools but two or three, and they are all do- 
ing very well. I think I can see a considerable improvement in 
the interest taken in schools since I become Superintendent. 
We had quite an interesting time at our Teachers’ Institute, 
and think that we will have a better, if possible, next summer. 
Very respectfully, 
Joun W. Beprorp, 
Superintendent. 
Morean County. 
Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn. : 
Dear Str—I have given you the financial report as given me 
by County Trustee. The condition of our county is such that 
the money for 1888 must pay for the schools of 1888. In giv- 
ing you amount of county debt to school, I gave you amount 
as shown by my books, although the Trustee claims that there 
are outstanding warrants which have not been charged as yet. 
The amount due the different districts, as shown by my books 
at present, is about $1,126, but probably. when I receive and 
charge outstanding warrants our books will balance. You 
will observe we have no colored school. The greatest number 
of colored pupils in any school district is about seven. I tried 
to get them together this year and give them a school, but have 
failed as yet. The school tax on privilege tax is one-fourth 
of privilege tax. You will also observe that some of our 
schools are not in session. These are schools that are indebted. 
Furthermore, some of the teachers engaged in schools have not 
been licensed this year. These parties claim that they hold 
first-class five-years’ certificates, issued by former Superintend- 
ent. This, I suppose, is legal. Should there be any deficiency 
dS: s. P, I: \
-P-A-G-E-195

in this report please notify me, and I will try to make it out 
satisfactory. I did not hold Teachers’ Normal in June, as there 
were seventeen teachers already licensed when I came into 
office, and I knew those parties would not attend.

Dear Srr—Inclosed find my report. A majority of the 
schools of Obion County opened during the month of Septem- 
ber. They are moving along with more energy and vim than 
ever before. We havea Monthly Teachers’ Association, which 
has accomplished much good. Such teachers as Fred. J. Page, 
k. E. Crockett, W. T. Moore, and M. F. Cloys are always on 
hand at these meetings to give teachers the benefit of their ex- 
- perience. 
During the summer a Normal Institute was held at Troy. 
Fred J. Page, Principal of Obion College, and a graduate of 
the State Normal College, was chief instructor. About thirty- 
five teachers were enrolled during the term. Much interest was 
manifested, and we hope to have a better attendance next sum- 
mer. 
Every two years the election for School Directors occurs on 
the same day as the general election. The consequence is the 
general election absorbs the attention of the people, and the 
election for School Directors goes by default. There was not a 
single Director elected in Obion County at the last August elec- 
tion. If the Legislature would change the time for holding 
the election for Directors it would save much trouble to the 
County Superintendent, and would be far more satisfactory to 
the people. Iam, very respectfully,

all. Some of our best teachers have failed to return their ab- 
stracts. In my opinion we are in need of a law to compel 
teachers to return their abstracts directly to the County Super- 
intendents, and thus avoid delay and failure in making reports. 
Our Trustee cannot. report from the fact that he got his books 
burned previous to the time for making his report. 
My report is as near correct as I can get it from the informa- _

Dear Srr—I have the honor to transmit herewith my annual 
report for the year ending June 30, 1888. The report is as full 
and accurate as can be made from the returns of the Directors, 
and from notes taken from visitations to every part of the 
county. 
I am glad to report that our schools are in much better con- 
dition now than they were last year, and, I think, better than 
they ever were in this county. 
I have just visited all the schools of the county, and have 
endeavored to give them all the instruction I could to help them 
up the way in a scientific course. _ I find patrons and Directors 
manifesting a greater interest than they have formerly been 
doing. Our teachers this year are a much better class than 
last year, are giving more satisfaction, and are doing much 
better labor in the school room. Our schools, I think, are at 
least ten per cent. better than last year. Still, our schools are 
not what they ought to be, for we have so many disadvantages 
in this mountain country, and we need more money. 
We have been trying to do all we could these two years of 
our official labor to promote the cause of education in this 
county, though we have had a good many difficulties to contend 
with and against. Yet we think that we have accomplished a 
great deal of good, and hope results may yet follow. ~

our schools are doing better than usual. As a general thing,

Dear Str—I have the honor to submit herewith my report of 
the Public Schools of Putnam County for scholastic year ending 
June 30, 1888. 
I am gratified to say that our schools in the main are in a 
more prosperous condition than ever before in the history of 
Putnam County. 
Teachers are working with a zeal heretofore unknown. Di- 
rectors are taking more interest in schools than formerly, em- 
ploying better qualified and, as far as practicable, experienced 
teachers and paying better wages. The result of this course — 
has been to bring the best teaching talent into the schools, — 
thereby raising the standard of teaching to a higher plane. 
However, the cheap teacher is sought by some yet. I had a very ~ 
interesting four weeks’ Normal for the training of teachers dur- 
ing the month of July, a brief synopsis of which I will give 
here. 
The Institute met at Cookeville, July 2d, and was called to 
order by the County Superintendent. The State was repre- 
sented by Prof. J. C. Brooks, of Franklin, who addressed the
-P-A-G-E-199
  ~ — 198 — 
teachers present upon the object and importance of institutes, 
after which the institute proceeded to organize by electing a 
President, Secretary, and Committee of Arrangements. 
Upon roll call thirty-five teachers responded. This number 
ywas augmented almost daily until the last two weeks of the in- 
stitute saw the number swelled to sixty-five. Prof. Brooks di- 
vided the institute into sections, assigning the daily work to 
each division in all the branches included in the public school 
curriculum, except geology and agriculture. 
The work was freely interspersed with daily recitations, class 
drills, blackboard work, calisthenics, lectures, ete. The even- 
‘ing sessions were devoted to miscellaneous discussions on edu- 
cational topics, in which most all of the teachers engaged. 
These meetings were very animating and instructive to the 
teachers. On Thursday night of each weck the institute gave 
a public entertainment, in which speeches, recitations, readings, 
_music (instrumental and vocal) were had. All of these meet- 
ings were well attended by the citizens of Cookeville and the 
surrounding country. Many speeches of approbation and en- 
couragement were made by citizens and local speakers attend- 
ing. 
At the close of the Normal I held a two days public written 
examination of all teachers attending the institute. The week 
following I held another examination for all teachers who did 
not attend the institute. 
Since the opening of the schools I visited nearly all the 
schools in the county, and, generally speaking, find the schools 
doing passably well. Ihave endeavored to arouse an interest 
among the people, and to this end have held educational meet- 
ings in different parts of the county. Much good has been ac- 
complished by said meetings, judging from the expressed senti- 
ments of the people. I am still holding these meetings, and 
will continue to hold them during the entire year. Directors, 
in many instances, are repairing or rebuilding their school 
houses, making them more commodious and comfortable.

  Having for a number of years been a teacher in the public 
schools of the county, and having, in a general way, given some 
attention to the school interests of the county, I am in an atti- 
tude to know the extent of progress made; and in view of what 
‘they have been in the past, are doing a good work. The signs 
of improvement are: better school houses are being built, bet- 
ter qualified teachers are in charge, better methods of teaching 
prevail, and more interest is manifested by the whole people. The 
most efficient means of improving the schools, in my opinion, 
is the Coanty Normal and its counterpart, the local or District 
Institute. Upon the whole our schools are growing better year 
by year. The Free School System now has an abiding place in 
the hearts of the people. However, in some sections a wonder- 
ful apathy still exists, but by persistent and untiring effort upon 
the part of school officials this may be overcome and the schools 
built up to that degree of efficiency destined and contemplated 
by the law. SB. De PTON,

Dear Str—I herewith submit my annual report for the year 
ending June 30, 1888. As yet we have not been able to get a 
sufficient number of suitable school buildings in this county, 
but have built some this year, and arranged for others. 
There seems to be more interest manifested in schools, both 
on the part of parent and child, this year than last. Still, there 
is not the interest taken in schools that ought to be. Certainly; 
our schools ought to be made of first importance. 
The work done in our schools will always be very unsatisfac- 
tory while the present school law, or rather want of school law, 
exists. All power is in the hands of the District Directors. 
Many of these are wanting in discretion, both in spending the 
public funds and in employing teachers. The majority of
-P-A-G-E-201
  O00 
Directors in this county do not discriminate between an ex- 
perienced and inexperienced teacher, one well informed and one 
uninformed, one who has natural tact for school work and one 
who has no ability at all for this work. They will take an ig- 
norant lad rather than the most successful teacher, if she hap- 
pens to be a woman. Again, a large part of those employed to 
teach in our publie schools are employed not on account of 
their competency to teach, but because they happen to be a 
brother or sister or near relative to the Director. When, oh 
when will man “cease to do evil and learn to do well?” Be- 
lieving that you have done more for our schools than any pre- 
vious man who has filled your place, I cannot help hoping that 
you will be retained to continue the good work you have in 
progress. Very respectfully, 
L. W. Gace, 
Superintendent.

Dezar Str—I have the honor to submit herewith my annual 
report for Robertson County. I have visited about half our 
schools, and I find some of them are not now as well attended 
as they should be, owing to i very heavy crop of tobacco now 
on hand, x 
Our people appreciate the public schools very much, and Iam 
satisfied they would be willing to pay a tax sufficient to run the 
schools eight months a year, instead of eighty -four days, if our 
County Court would levy it. 
Eight new houses, all neat, comfortable frame, besides some 
additions, have been built this year. These houses were built 
partly by subscription aud partly by use of the public fund. 
The old-time log and dirt house, with its puncheon seats, is 
rapidly giving place to the more modern frame, with its com- 
fortable seats and desks.

Our teachers are mostly wide-awake, energetic men and 
women, and I am glad to report that they are steadily improv- 
ing in all those qualities and acquirements that enter into the 
make-up of the modern teacher. 
I have conducted this year, beginning June 11th, two Nor- 
mal Institutes of four weeks each, one for white and one for 
colored teachers. I acknowledge the valuable assistance of 
Professors Hooker, Willett, Walton, Clinard, and Empson, and 
Miss Callie Johnson in the one, and of Prof. W. 8. Thompson, 
of Nashville, in the other of these institutes. Both of these 
meetings were well attended, and much interest was manifested.

Dear Sir—After a month’s delay, caused by the failure on 
the part of the County Trustee in making his report to me, 
Itake pleasure in sending you this, my second annual report 
of the schools of Rutherford County. I am_ exceedingly 
glad to be able to report that the schools are in a fair state 
of improvement, except in a few districts. The per cent. of 
attendance is much better this year than last. We have 
made many changes in teachers, all for the better, getting 
better ones, which gives us better schools—schools that bring 
about much more interest. We have done away with some of 
the old discommodious houses and built new and capacious 
ones in their stead, furnishing them with improved desks, ete., — 
and forming consoldidated schools of high grade. 
A great many of the Directors are changing the old-time 
schools to the modern, which caused a demand for teachers in 
our county this year. Some teachers have lost their places this 
year for the first time in life. Some resigned rather than un-
-P-A-G-E-203
  — 202 — 
dertake to undergo the examination; these, of course, were 
long-standing pets. 
We have some high schools that would be of high reputa- 
tion to any town or city. Prof J. M. Savage, of Eagleville, 
has a school in which most all the sciences are taught by prac- 
tical experiments. Prof. Savage had a graduating class this 
year that would reflect credit on any college. 
Prof. J. B. Powell, of Lascasas, N. D. Overall, of Milton, 
‘and A. J. Brandon, Jr., of Jordan’s Valley, will be sending 
out graduates soon. Then comes Walter Hill, Readyville, 
Cedar Hill, Oakwood, Kingswood, Union Hill, Stuart’s Creek, 
‘Rockvale, Salem, Fosterville, Millersburg, aud Rutherford 
College, all high schools, and in fine working condition. In 
Murfreesboro we have a high school for boys and one for girls, 
and last, but not least, is Soule College, a female institute. — 
I held two summer normals, one for the white and one for 
the colored, each being in session one week. The enrollment 
at the white was sixty teachers, all of whom were deeply in- 
terested in the work. At the colored, which was conducted by 
your representative, Rev. B. A. J. Nixon, colored, were en- 
rolled sixty-six, and was one of the best institutes ever held in 
_ the county. 
Since the normals we have had regular meetings by both the 
white and colored. These meetings are of much interest, and 
a great good is being done by them, though such work is in its 
infancy in this county. The enrollment was double this year 
of that of last year. 
All of which is very respectfully submitted,

Denar Sir—Find inclosed my fifth annual report for Se- 
quatchie County. 
I have had a great deal of trouble in getting the necessary 
papers to make my annual report. 
School Directors are so careless in my county that the whole 
business is almost dependent on the County Superintendent. 
Why not allow the County Superintendent to take the census 
of the whole county in which he lives instead of allowing care- 
less Directors to go along and make reports that no man can 
tell any thing about? 
I would suggest that the County Superintendent be allowed 
to do the whole school work, selecting and hiring teachers, 
spend his whole time in the interest of the schools and school 
fund.

SHELBY County. 
Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn. : 
Dear Str—In submitting this report I feel very grateful for 
the signal improvement in all departments. 
Our scholastic population has steadily increased for several 
years past, and this year shows a greater ratio of increase than 
any previous year. 
While in many districts the location of the schools has been 
changed, thereby giving fewer schools to the district—which I 
very much approve—in the whole county, owing to the increased 
scholastic population, enrollment, and average attendance, I find 
that we have an increase of two schools. Owing to my per- 
sistent effort the location of many schools in populous districts 
has been changed, in many instances throwing three schools 
into one, requiring more teachers in the school, making the 
schools much more interesting and more emulative, also giving 
an opportunity to grade the schools. Last year I learned from 
the district clerks’ reports that the colored pupils were making 
a better average attendance than the white pupils. I insisted 
that the Directors call the white teachers’ and parents’ attention 
to this. In my visits through the districts and schools I used 
this as a spur to produce an emulative interest between white 
and colored pupils to secure from both a better average attend- 
ance. The result has been that the reports this year show a 
better average attendance on the part of both, and a largely 
increased per cent. of average attendance on the part of the 
whites. I would very respectfully call your attention to the 
fact that while our enrollment, average attendance, and number 
of teachers employed, shows a large increase, the term of our 
schools have been extended from five months to five and a half 
months. Again, our average compensation of teachers per 
month has increased from $33.30 to $35.25, with a fair prospect 
next year of larger salaries to the teachers and a longer term 
of the schools. Our assessor, in assessing our property this 
‘year, reported about thirteen million dollars more property than
-P-A-G-E-206
— 205 — 
  his predecessor. This called for a readjusting of the rate of taxes 
to be collected on the hundred dollars.. Our County School taxes 
were ten cents on the hundred dollars. The County Court con- 
yened and appointed a committe of three, composed of their 
honorable body, to meet a committee of the tax-paying citizens 
to formulate a rate of tax per hundred dollars. The two com- 
mittees were unanimous in their conclusion to reduce all the 
county taxes one halt, thus reducing our school tax to five 
cents on the hundred dollars. A severe blow, you will admit. 
I saw a notice of this conclusion in that staunch friend of the 
public schools, the Memphis Appeal. I hastened to Memphis, 
and secured the assistance of several prominent citizens, friends 
of the public schools, who went into the County Court and de- 
feated this part of the committee’s report. Thus, while all © 
other rates are reduced one-half, our school tax remains the 
same, ten cents on the hundred dollars. Many assert that this 
will nearly double our county school fund—it certainly ‘will in- 
erease it very much—thus giving us better salaries for our 
teachers, longer terms for our schools, better houses, more 
desks, blackboards, charts, wall maps, and other pedagogical 
appliances. For this act of the County Court I tender them 
my heartfelt thanks. During the last year I held three monthly 
institutes, two County Normals, and one State Normal. 
One County Normal was for the colored teachers. The con- 
ductor or principal was Prof. A. J. Steele, President of the Le- 
Moyne Institute. He very kindly tendered me the use of the 
LeMoyne building; also the library, maps, charts, geological 
specimens, philosophical apparatus, and other pedagogical ap- 
pliances belonging to the Institute. He also gave me for one | 
week the services of his corps of excellent teachers—teachers 
trained to Normal work. 
At this Normal more than one hundred teachers enrolled 
their names. Probably at no time in the county has more or 
better work been done in one week. I must here express my- 
self as having been very pleasantly surprised at the proficiency 
of many of the colored teachers.
-P-A-G-E-207
  / — 206 — 
At the close of the Normal I held a public examination for 
two days. I now hasten my preparation for the summer Nor- 
mal for the white teachers for the term of two weeks; one 
week a State Normal, under the auspices of a State agent, and 
one week a County Normal. The statistical and narrative re- 
port of the State work was forwarded you. I again take this 
opportunity to thank that grand old Roman, Prof. Karns, for 
his good work. : 
After closing the State Normal, the County Normal lasted 
one week. It would be tedious to give the names of all who 
took an active part, for it was indeed a hive of working bees ; 
such zeal, such earnest efforts, such hearty good will and social 
feeling, such unbounded enthusiasm never had a parallel. 
During the term many of the School Directors attended, and 
hundreds of the citizens of Shelby and adjacent counties visited 
the Normal, and all expressed satisfaction at the good that was 
being done ultimately for Shelby and adjacent counties. At 
the close of the term I held two days’ examination. At this ex- 
amination a large per cent. secured first grade certificates. The 
reason for this was that the teachers had been notified that the 
examination would be more rigid; they had therefore prepared 
themselves, by hard study, in the branches required to be taught, 
and also by the thorough and complete drill in the Normal. 
I again beg you to allow me to thank the Memphis Appeal for 
the accurate daily report made by the State and County Nor- 
mal. I also thank all of the Memphis papers for their kind- 
ness in publishing notices of public examinations, reports of 
schools, and educational articles. Much of the good work here 
reported is due to your vigilant supervision and good advice. 
In expressing my sincere hope that you may be retained in your 
present official position for many terms, I am only echoing an 
expression from all over the State.

Dear Srr--Inclosed you will find my annual report. I am 
glad that Icansay many of our schools are doing well. We have 
quite a number of teachers in this county, of whom we feel 
proud. We have a very interesting Teacher’s Association that 
meets the last Saturday in every month. It is well attended by 
live, energetic teachers. 
Since my report to you last year we have introduced a uni- 
form system of text books, which makes our schools at least 30 
per cent. better. We have lately adopted a system of grading 
- which is being used successfully in many of our schools. 
There is a growing educational interest felt in every community 
in the county. In fact, a new era is dawning upon us, and we 
feel that in the near future Smith County will be placed among 
the first in the State.

Dear Str—My report is complete except as to “average

possible to obtain reports from all the private schools of the 
county. j 
The Dover High School (consolidated), under the manage- 
ment of Prof. M. H. Hogan, is doing good work for the 
county. Many of his last year’s pupils are now teaching in 
the public schools of the county, and we expect in this way to 
. be able in a few years to furnish nearly all the teachers for our 
public schools.

Ihave held a Teachers’ Institute once a month through the 
year, beginning with April. We alternate at different points 
through the county, and usually have a good attendance. In 
some communities the people attended the institute in large 
numbers, and I am sure that they, as well as the teachers, were 
benefited. Respectfully,

Duar Str—I have the honor to submit to you my annual re- 
port for the scholastic year ending June 30, 1888. This makes 
the fourth year I have served as superintendent of the schools 
of this county, and confidentially say that I have never. known 
them to be in a more prosperous condition. They have com- 
menced this year with a fuller attendance than I ever knew 
them. 
Our teachers are preparing for their work, and the County 
Court, I believe, will do its whole duty at the next quarterly 
meeting. Although the Trustee reports no balance, I am in- 
formed by the Chairman of the County Court that there re- 
mains in the treasury of the.county a balance on school fund of 
$2,112. Our Trustee wil! pay this year $1.50. Our prorata has 
been for the past three years from $1.30 to $1.35 per scholar. 
The last County Normal is said to have been our best. The 
examinations were conducted upon the plan given by our State 
Superintendent in his circular dated about March ist. The 
names of seventy-five teachers were enrolled. Profs. N. B. 
Sherfey, R. F. King, and John K. Shyley did the principal 
part of the teaching. Prof. Charles Mason, of Jonesboro, vis- 
ited the Normal and did some excellent work. At the close 
sixty-five applicants were licensed to teach in the county.

Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn. : 
Dear Sir—It gives me great pleasure to submit to you my 
- annual report for the year ending June 30, 1888. The schools 
of the county generally have been and are now working well. 
Considerable advancement has been made. A better feeling is 
manifest, and a growing interest is gradually developing. At 
no period of the existence of public schools has a more decided 
stand been taken by the people in favor of general education. 
The talk in many parts of the county is becoming quite com- 
mon that we must have a higher tax for school purposes. The 
desire for good graded schools is taking strong hold on both 
teachers and people. The people well understand that in order 
to establish these schools we must have more money—money 
enough to have longer terms, and, in many instances, better 
teachers. The schools are improving in popularity and useful- 
ness. Although we held no Teachers’ Institutes yet there has 
been in many teachers a decided improvement in knowledge 
gained, and in manner of imparting instruction. In addition 
to these facts there is a great desire for better houses, and those 
houses better furnished. . 
At Hendersonville a good graded school is in successful opera- ~ 
tion. At Rural Academy, Beech Hill, Number One, and Liberty, 
good consolidated schools are being taught. At Westmore- 
land, Bethpage, Fairfield, and Portland, vigorous efforts are be- 
ing made to establish graded high schools. I have never before 
seen as much interest manifested. The public sentiment now 
being formed strongly appeals to the County Court for a more 
liberal.course toward our-schools. Many of the magistrates 
are giving more time andsthought to the schools, and say they 
are willing to raise the school tax. With all these encourage- 
ments our schools are not what they should be, and are not 
meeting the demands of our growing population. As I have — 
said, we need more money, and many more better qualified 
teachers. All these additions could be secured if we had the 
money.

Although these schools have been in operation but a short. time 
their good effects are being felt. An academy of high grade 
for boys will open in a few days. It will be quite an addition 
to our town and county in the way of educational advantages. 
My report would be incomplete without some reference to 
Howard Female College. Thisis a private school, conducted as 
an individual enterprise by Prof. A. M. Burney, under the con- 
trol of Independent Order Odd Fellows. It is now entering

have had some difficulty in getting up the necessary papers to 
make a correct report, owing to some teachers failing to make 
out abstracts, and Directors failed to make their reports accord- 
ing to law. Until Directors are more prompt and correct in 
making their reports, we will be troubled in making our reports. 
That has been the cause of my delay. 
Tam glad to say that our schools are in a more healthy con- 
dition than they were last year—better attendance, according to 
enrollment, than last year.

Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction,

Dear Srr—I have the honor to submit my second annual 
report of the schools of Unicoi County, ending June 30, 1888. 
The report shows very little change from last year. We need 
not expect much until we have more money, in order that we 
may run our schools longer. Money is what we need, and 
money is what we must ave to educate our mountain boys and 
girls. The majority of our parents depend on the public fund 
to educate their children, which is very insufficient in this 
county. After considering the great need of public funds, as 
well as good school houses, we are on the road to improvement. 
The Directors have become more interested and are employing 
a better class of teachers generally. The teachers’ salaries have 
been increased. The per cent. of attendance has been better 
the last school year. There is a brighter dawning for little 
Unicoi, and that will ke when we get the three O’s Railroad 
through our county. 
Respectfully submitted, 
" , G. E. Swapuezy,

Unton County. 
Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn. : 
Dear Sir—In transmitting to you my annual report it makes 
me sad to note the condition of the public schools of this 
county. On an average the schools are run about three months 
in the year. Observation teaches me that under such a system 
the children are not doing well. They forget from the close of 
one session until the commencement of another all they 
learned in the former, consequently no advancement to boast of. 
The people are already so burdened with taxes that the County 
Court does not think it wise to levy any more tax for school 
purposes. So I see no remedy unless ‘the State would increase 
her funds. Education is certainly the antidote for crime. If
-P-A-G-E-214
    eee: — 213 — 
we fail to keep pace with the improvement of the times in our 
educational departments crime will certainly be on the in- 
crease. To make our schools efficient we should have at least 
six month’s sessions in the year instead of three. 
Will the great State of Tennessee let the children of her re- 
mote counties grow up in ignorance because they are poor? 
Give us more funds, if the bondholders do claim the ‘ pound 
of flesh.’ Have our fathers sold the State to a few money 
sharks, and made slaves of our children for all time to come? 
I close this report by saying we have as good a corps of 
teachers as any county in the State, considering us to be a 
mountain county. But they are very much discouraged to get 
employment three months in the year. Give us more money 
to educate our children and give less to monopolies, trusts, cor- 
porations, and syndicates.

Dear Sir—In the report sent you a few days since there is 
shown to be an increase of about three hundred in the enroll- 
ment of pupils in the public schools over that of last year, and 
the average daily attendance is shown to be greater by about 
four hundred. In addition to this favorable showing there 
should be considered the numbers enrolled in two or three pri- 
vate schools which were in session at the same time the public 
schools were. z 
Four institutes were held at different points in the county 
while the schools were in session. These were attended by 
about forty different teachers. The earnest discussion of edu- 
cational topics, and the methods of teaching illustrated in these 
meetings, I tind to be of marked benefit to the young and in-
-P-A-G-E-215
  — 214 — 
experienced teacher; besides, a favorable influence is exerted on 
public sentiment in the community where an institute is held. 
I visited seventy-four of the seventy-seven schools of the 
county while they were in session. Some twenty-five or thirty 
of these I visited the second time. In most of them there was 
evidence of earnest, conscientious work being done on the part 
of the ‘teachers, so that I feel warranted in saying that we are 
approaching a higher degree of excellence in the shool work 
of the county. 
It is true much remains to be done before the county schools 
give us the most desirable results and accomplish what should 
be expected of them. Hitherto there has been a want of sys- 
tem in our work, and to remedy this a manual containing 
general suggestions, rules, and regulations, and a course of 
study, has been placed in the hands of the teachers and School 
Directors of the county. 
We are not so sanguine as to expect that the difficulties at- 
tending the introduction of a graded course of study into the 
county schools can be overcome at once, but we do expect good 
results from the steps taken, and in time we hope to have all 
the schools come up to the requirements of the system. 
The general outlook at this time is favorable. 4

Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn.: 
Dear Srr—I herewith submit my second annual report of 
White County Public Schools. Although we have not yet ac- 
complished all that should be done, still we have made grand 
strides in the right direction within the past year.
-P-A-G-E-216
oe 
  Our school record shows an increase of school interest, popu- 
lation, enrollment, daily attendance, and more system, better pay 
to teachers, and longer school terms'than any previous year in 
the history of our county. 
During the past year we have built six large, neat frame 
school houses, besides painting and repairing several others. 
There has been a considerable waking up al] over the county. 
This is due mainly to our State Normal Institute and to our 
monthly County Institutes. 
The public school system never had so deep a hold on the 
affections of our people as now, and our future grows brighter 
and brighter. 
I have held throughout the year regular monthly meetings of — 
the county teachers. Teachers, patrons, pupils, and Directors 
have attended them in large numbers, and manifested great 
interest in the efforts which have been made to improve our 
schools. Iam certain great good has been accomplished in.this 
way. 
A session of the State Normal Institute was held at Doyle 
College, in this county, beginning July 9th and holding six days, 
and during the entire time, day and night, immense crowds 
filled the large college building. There never was such an edu- 
cational awakening in the county as was witnessed during the 
session. 
Too much praise cannot be spoken in regard to the instruct- 
ors, Messrs. C. S. Douglas and T. C. Karns, for they succeeded 
most admirably in making the meeting a grand success. Several 
of the teachers of the county took part in the programme of 
the meeting with pronounced success and ability. The State 
Normal was a powerful engine in arousing the dormant energies 
of the people and interesting them in the cause of education. 
It also accomplished much good in stirring up the teachers to — 
greater energy and proficiency. We had one hundred and ten 
teachers in attendance, and the institute was a success in every
-P-A-G-E-217
    — 216 — 
respect. Hope we may be favored with another soon? Accept 
our many thanks for this one, and our deep regrets that, on 
‘account of sickness, you were prevented from being with us. 
We have seventy schools in this county this year, two more 
than ever before. I have visited all the schools this year, and 
am glad to say they are improving, though in many instances 
far behind what they should be, yet the teachers are not alto- 
gether to blame. The Directors have not always done their 
duty in preparing and furnishing the school houses, and the 
people do not send their children as regularly as they should. 
1 found the houses generally. in better condition than last year, 
and the schools better attended. Our teachers are, most of 
them, doing good work; but while we have some excellent 
teachers there are also fogies in the school room as well as 
other places. I notice in my visits to the schools that those 
teachers who take and read school journals and good books on 
theory and practice are leaching school, while those who do not 
are only keeping school. I have called several meetings of the 
District Directors and confered with them in regard to the pro- 
motion of the school interests. We have some active, wide- _ 
awake Directors, but many who are careless, indifferent, and 
negligent about their duties. We have adopted a uniform 
system of text books, and want svon to adopt a system.of grad- 
ing our schools. , 
I have delivered several “ public addresses” during the year, 
and “talked” from twenty to forty minutes to nearly all of the 
schools on my round of visits. The children in all of the 
schools gave me most respectful attention, and seemed anxious 
_to profit by any good advice given them. Believing that earnest, 
effective county supervision is extremely necessary to the suc- 
cess of the public school system, I have tried to give all of my 
energy and talent to the work. I have enjoyed the hearty co- 
Operation of teachers and directors. As a result of our labors, 
we have the pleasure of knowing that our schools are better 
than they have been in any previous year. 
I tried to conduct our teachers’ examinations exactly accord- 
ing to your directions, and was pleased to find most of the
-P-A-G-E-218

Oe 
  teachers better prepared than they were last year. Our greatest 
need is more money, and then we can have better teachers, 
longer school terms, better houses, desks, apparatus, etc. The 
amount of money we receive is not sufficient to run our schools 
long enough. Our County Court was kind enough to increase 
our school tax from twenty-five cents on the hundred dollars’ 
worth of property to thirty cents. Still this gives us only 
seventy-eight days as the average length of our schools for this 
year, against seventy-two days for last year. Our schools ought 
to continue at least six months. , 
We have several good private schools in the county which 
run ten months in the year, and are accomplishing much good. 
Dibrell Normal Institute, Doyle College, Onward Seminary, 
Anderson Seminary, and Shady Grove High School, are all in 
successful operation and well attended. | 
Having worked under the present school law ever since it 
was enacted in 1873, and having tried to fill the office of County 
Superintendent for the last two years, I beg permission, if it. 
will not be out of place, to suggest the following changes and ° 
amendments to our present school law: 
1. That it be changed from a County to a State System; 
2. That liberal provision be made for State Normal Insti- 
tutes and County Teachers’ Institutes ; 
3. That the law requiring County Superintendents to approve 
of school warrants be re-enacted ; 
4. That the scholastic year and the term of office of County 
Superintendents close on the same day ; 
5. That a County Superintendent’s salary be fixed at a certain 
rate per capita on the scholastic population; 
6. That no man be eligible to the office of School Director 
who cannot read and write. 
7. That physiology and civil government be added to the list 
of Free School studies ; 
8. That the County Trustee be required to make quarterly 
settlements with the County Superintendent concerning the 
school fund;
-P-A-G-E-219

9. That the law require teachers to attend State Normal 
Institutes and County Teacher’s Institutes; $ 
10. That some system of grading the public schools be 
adopted and published. 
Success to you—hope you may be re-appointed to the posi- 
tion you have so successfully and ably filled. 
Yours truly, 
W. N. Bruiinesiey, 
Superintendent. 
Wintramson Country. 
Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn. : : 
Dear Sir—In submitting my second annual report for this 
county it affords me great pleasure to note the many improve- 
ments which have taken place since my last report. In point 
of attendance, our schools show a marked improvement over 
any previous year. 
One of the greatest drawbacks to many of our districts, for 
many years, has been their indebtedness; this I have labored 
hard to remedy, and have been rewarded by seeing all of these 
delinquent districts in 50 per cent. better condition than for 
many years past. Over $16,000 of these old debts have been 
paid in the last two years, and still our average session has in- 
creased ten days.. 
We have a splendid corps of professional teachers, and many 
of them remain at one place for several years, and are able 
thereby to build up excellent graded schools. 
We still lave more schvols than necessary, and nothing 
would assist us more than to abolish at least 20 ey cent. of 
what we now have. 
Our annual Teachers’ Institute, which lasted two weeks, one 
for the white, and one for the colored teachers, was well at- 
tended, and awakened much interest among both the teachers 
and patrons. of our schools. In the work of our white in-
-P-A-G-E-220
  — 219 — 
stitute, which was held in the chapel of the Tennessee Female 
College, we had the assistance of Prof. M. Thomas Edgerton, 
and most of the faculty of the college. The colored institute 
was a success in every partiular, every colored teacher in the 
county being present and taking part in the work of the in- 
stitute. Our institutes are well organized, and meet monthly 
except in the winter months. 
In every department of our system we are pleased to note a 
sure and steady progress, and we are free to say that it is ac- 
complishing as much or more than could reasonably be ex- 
pected. 
Our schools are not such as we wish, or such as we hope to 
make them in the near future, but such as they are, we could 
not possibly dispense with them. May they ever grow and . 
prosper. Most respectfully, 
R. Suire Battow, 
Superintendent. 
‘Witson County. 
Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn. : 
Dear Str—I herewith present my second report of the school 
work of Wilson County. 
Iam proud to state that our county is now in better condi- 
tion than ever before. The teachers are improving in every 
respect. Our County Institute this year was not as well at- 
tended as heretofore, but the interest manifested was never 
better. The teachers are becoming to realize the responsibility 
and importance of their work. The Directors are performing 
their duty much better, but not as well yet as we would like. 
The people are also becoming aroused on the subject of educa- 
tion, and are visiting the schools more and coming out to hear 
the Superintendent. The county is in better condition finan- 
cially than ever before. The future prospects are bright for the 
children of this county. We are very proud that we can make 
such a report. Respectfully, 
J: J. BAIRD, 
Superintendent.

ma   REPORT OF PEABODY NORMAL COLLEG 
Hon. Frank M. Smith, Superintendent of Public Instruction : 
In accordance with your request I make the following report 
- of the condition and prospects of the Peabody Normal College: 
My lamented predecessor, the Rev. Eben 8. Stearns, Chan- 
cellor of the University of Nashville and first President of the 
College, died in office on April 11, 1887. In the history of this 
Institution the presidency of Dr. Stearns may be characterized 
as the period of organization. In this difficult and perilous 
work he consecrated the last and best years of his life, and it is 
just that this College should be regarded as a memorial of his 
wisdom, patience, and heroic devotion to duty under cireum- 
stances that often must have been most trying. 
To An an institution of an unfamiliar type and then to cre- 
ate the conditions necessary for its development and growth, is 
one of the most difficult feats of human wisdom; and unusual 
credit is to be given to those who succeed in an enterprise so 
arduous and so liable to mischances. During the twelve years 
of this formative period of its history Dr. Stearns held the 
College steadily and firmly to its one distinctive purpose—the 
preparation of young men and women for the more responsible 
positions in the public school service of the South. How well 
he succeeded in his efforts is attested by the high standing of 
the school wherever it was known, and by the almost uniform | 
success of its graduates. 
On the death of President Stearns the administration of the 
College was entrusted to Prof. Benjamin B. Penfield, whose 
good judgment and executive skill preserved the institution - 
from dangers that are liable to follow the withdrawal of the 
guiding hand of an accustomed leader. 
Daeg, Seb. 1,
-P-A-G-E-227
   
— 226 — 
The overture made to me in person by Dr. Curry, the former 
General Agent of the Peabody Education Fund, and at that 
time United States Minister to the Court of Spain, was un- 
sought and unexpected, and, after careful deliberation, was de- 
clined; but negotiations were resumed, I visited Nashville out 
of deference to the Peabody Board of Trust and against my 
inclinations, but, out of a sense of public duty, I finally accepted 
the Presidency of the College, after having tendered to Presi- 
dent Angell my resignation as Professor of the Science and Art 
of Teaching in the University of Michigan. My resignation was 
accepted on the condition that I should conduct my classes in the 
University through the work of the first semester. This condi- 
tion was accepted by the Peabody Board of Trust, and I was 
formally inaugurated as Chancellor of the Univerity of Nashville 
and President of the Normal College on October 5, 1887. I re- 
mained in Nashville for a few days following the opening of the 
College, returned for a brief period at Thanksgiving, and as- 
sumed my active duties on February 5, 1888. During my ab- 
sence the affairs of the College were administered by Prof. 
Penfield, and, as before, without perceptible friction or jar. 
Ata meeting of the State Board of Education held in my 
absence, on motion of Gov. Taylor, a committee was appointed 
to consider the propriety of changing the name of the institution 
from “State Normal College” to “Peabody Normal College ;” 
and at a subsequent meeting, on the recommendation of the 
committee, the change in designation was made by a unanimous 
vote. The motive leading to this resolution was in every respect 
commendable. It was felt that the College, by its very desig- 
nation, should perpetuate the name of its honored founder and 
be a memento for all time of one of the most princely benefac- 
tors of his country. Again, it.was felt that the designation 
“State” did not fitly represent the intent and scope of the 
school, which are not local, but national. While the College 
was intended to serve the State of Tennessee as a State Normal 
School, and in fact does perform this service, its advantages are 
open to the entire South, and even to the nation at large. From 
its very locality the benefits of the College will accrue to the 
State of Tennessee in much larger measure than to any other 
 
-P-A-G-E-228
— 227 — 
  State; but the fact must be kept in mind that the privileges of 
the school are not limited by State lines. 
The extent to which the State of Tennessee has employed the 
advantages of the Normal College may be seen from the follow- 
ing table, which shows the enrollment by States, from the found- 
ing of the College in 1875 to January 1, 1889:

From this table it will readily be seen that up to the present 
time 48 per cent. of the advantages offered by the Normal Col- 
lege have accrued to the State of Tennessee. 
In this connection there is another fact that deserves par- 
ticular attention. If, in imitation of those ates where public 
instruction is most prosperous, the State of Tennes-ce should 
found a Normal School of its own, the outlay for ;uildings, 
for grounds, and for furniture, would not be less than $100,000, 
and the annual cost of maintenance not less than $30,000, 
while, under the present arrangement, with an annual endow- 
ment from the Peabody Board of Trust, and with buildings 
and grounds furnished by the Trustees of the University of 
Nashville, Tennessee, has every advantage that could possibly 
come from a normal school of its own at an annual expense 
of only $10,000. At the present time the Normal College re-
-P-A-G-E-229
aa) ie 
— 228 — 
  ceives trom the Peabody Board of Trust, each year, $22,£00 
for scholarships, and $10,000 for salaries; and at the last meet- — 
ing of the Board an appropriation of $2,000 was made for 
purchasing books for the library. In the distribution of 
scholarships among the Southern States fourteen were allotted 
to Tennessee. These scholarships are awarded through the 
State Superintendent by competitive examinations held in 
each county of the State, and the successful competitors are ad- 
mitted to the College without further examination, and receive 
from the President $25 a month ($200 a year) for two years. 
These fourteen scholarships will be vacant at the close of the 
present college year (May, 1889), and the competitive examina- 
tion will be held in August, 1889. ‘ 
The opinion has prevailed to a considerable extent that none 
but scholarship students will be admitted to the College. This 
is an error. Any white youth of either sex, of proper quali- 
fications, will be received. Applications from students of the 
Southern States shall have preference, but while there is room 
in the College students from any other State will be received. 
By moditying the present plan of reorganization it is thought 
that five hundred students can be accommodated in the build- 
ings as they now stand. 
Save an incidental fee of $6 a year, a student’s only expense 
is for board and room, lights and fire, washing, ete. Tuition 
and the use of text-books are free. The price of board in pri- 
vate families, with furnished room, light, and fire, ranges, for 
young men, from $15 to $18 a calender month; and, for young 
women, from $17 to $20 a month. There is a limited number 
of furnished rooms in Lindsley Hall that will be rented next 
year at $2.25 a month for each student, with two students in a 
room. Table board in such cases costs $9 a month, so that, on 
this plan, the cost of maintenance will fall within $13 a month. 
For the years 1889-90 students from Tennessee shall have the 
first choice of rooms in Lindsley Hall; but rooms that are not 
thus engaged by the Ist of October will be rented to students 
from other States.
-P-A-G-E-230
  = 90Gre= 
During the last years of Dr. Stearns’ administration bills 
amounting to more than twelve thousand dollars were tempo- 
rarily paid out of other than State funds; but when an adjust- 
ment of accounts was made it was held by the Comptroller 
that State funds not used during the year for which the appro- 
priation was made revert to the State. By reason of this de- 
cision there has been withheld from use by the College, for the 
years 1887-8, 1888-9, $12,000 of the funds appropriated by the 
State Legislature. The consequence has been that the College 
has been seriously crippled in its efficiency, and:if relief is not 
given a considerable debt must needs be incurred by the close 
of the present year. At the present moment at least three ad- 
ditional teachers are needed. The impossibility of doing a high 
class of recitation work, with classes numbering from forty to 
fifty pupils, is too evident to require argument. 
Somewhat contrary to its general policy, the Peabody Board, 
in view of our great need of books, appropriated $2,000 for 
library uses. The University Board has put at our disposal its 
collection of old and valuable books; and it would seem most 
reasonable that the State should do its share toward the main- 
tenance of a thoroughly good library. 
Next to additions to our teaching force and a good working | 
library, the great need of the College is a well equipped model 
school, a graded school of two departments, with pupils from 
six to twelve years of age, taught by accomplished teachers, 
where our pupils can observe the very best models of school | 
roomwork. In the College our students have the opportunity of 
teaching pupils of their own age and attainment; but they 
should also have the opportunity of studying the most approved 
primary methods as they are applied in a model school. 
Appearances seem to indicate that in the history of the Nor- 
mal College the period of organization has passed, and that 
the period of development and growth has begun. The aim of 
the school is to give to young men and women, who propose to 
devote themselves to teaching, an education of the liberal or 
collegiate type, supplemented by a course of instruction of the
-P-A-G-E-231
t — 230 — 
highest professional type. With this aim the Peabody Normal 
College has no competitors, its field is the entire South, and 
there seems to be no reason why its membership should not be 
reckoned by several hundreds. At the expiration of about ten 
years the principal of the Peabody Education Fund, about 
$2,000,000, will be permanently invested; and there is no doubt 
that, at present, the desire of the Board of Trust is to bestow 
this princely endowment on the Normal College at Nashville. 
In the meantime, however, it is the plainest dictate of prudence 
for the local Boards to foster the institution by hearty and gen- 
erous co-operation with the Peabody Board. 
At the opening of the present college year, on October 3, 
ceremonies were observed appropriate to the presentation and 
reception of the portraits of George Peabody, the Honorable 
Robert C. Winthroop, and the Honorable Edwin H. Ewing. 
The portraits of Mr. Peabody and Mr. Winthroop were pre- 
sented by the Peabody Board of Trust, and that of Mr. Ewing 
by Trustees of the University of Nashville. Addresses were 
made by Hon. Samuel Watson, Hon. Thomas D. Craighead, 
Hon. Frank M. Smith, and the President of the College. 
These portraits, richly framed, have been appropriately hung 
on the walls of the chapel, and, together with the portrait of 
Dr. Stearns, presented in May last by the Alumni, they will 
preserve in the minds of the succeeding generations of students 
the memory of their illustrious benefactors. For the informa- 
tion of those who may wish to compete for Peabody Scholar- 
ships, I take this opportunity to publish the following Circular 
of Information: 
I.—The intent of the Peabody Board of Trust in establish- 
ing these Scholarships in the Normal College is to effect public 
education in the South through a high grade of professionally 
educated teachers. 
1. The reatization of this intent implies, on the part of teach- 
ers, high moral aims; natural aptness to teach, an education of 
the liberal type, a knowledge of the history, theory, and art of 
education, and the pursuit of teaching as a vocation.
-P-A-G-E-232
oe — 231 — 
II.—A Peabody Scholarship is worth $200 a year, and is 
good for two years. The College year consists of eight 
months, beginning on the first Wednesday in October, and 
closing on the third Wednesday in May, and Scholarship 
students receive from the President of the College $25 at the 
end of each of these eight months. 
1. No payment will be made except for time of actual at- 
tendance. 
2. Scholarships will be withdrawn from students who allow 
bills for board to go unpaid. 
III.—These scholarships are distributed to the several States 
by the President, and are awarded to students through the 
State Superintendent of their respective States. The whole 
number of scholarships is 114, and they are distributed at pres- 
ent as follows: 
Alabama, 13; Arkansas, 10; Georgia, 14; Louisiana, 8; 
North Carolina, 14; South Carolina, 10; Tennessee, 14; Texas, 
9; Virginia, 14; West Virginia, 8. 
1. No State can claim scholarships as a right. They are 
gifts from the Peabody Board of Trust, and as such the ratio 
of their distribution, as well as their amount, may be changed, © 
or they may be withheld altogether. 
2. At the close of each college year the President will notify 
State Superintendents of the vacancies which are to be filled in 
their respective States for the ensuing college year. 
1V.—Scholarships are awarded on competitive examination, 
and persons who desire tq compete for them should make ap- 
plication as early as June 1 to their State Superintendent, 
who will forward information as to the time and place of 
examination. 
1. It is recommended that State Superintendents delegate to
-P-A-G-E-233
— 232 — 
their respective County Superintendents the conduct of these 
competitive examinations. 
V.—For the purpose of securing to all applicants a uniform 
basis of competition, the questions for examination will be pre- 
pared by the President of the College and sent to the State 
Superintendents for distribution to the examiners whom they 
may appoint. 
1. These questions, with specific instructions for their use, 
should be sent to the examiners in sealed envelopes, which are 
not to be opened till the hour for the examination has come. 
VI.—The qualifications for becoming a competitor for a 
scholarship are as follows: The applicant must be not less 
than 17 years of age, nor more than 30; irreproachable moral 
character; good health; no physical defects, habits, or eccen- 
tricities which would interfere with success in teaching; a pur- 
pose to follow teaching as a vocation. 
1. The task of the examiners will be simplified by making a 
preliminary examination, as suggested above. 
2. The President would prefer not to receive young men who 
use tobacco in any form. 
3. If it should appear that a candidate intends to use his 
scholarship chiefly as a means of securing an education, or of 
ultimately preparing himself for some profession other than 
teaching, he should not be allowed to compete. 
4. Persons of sluggish or indolent temperament, of slovenly 
or indolent habits, or of vicious disposition, should be at once 
rejected. 
5. When a choice must be made between a young man and a

  VIL—The minimum literary qualifications for securing a 
scholarship are the following: The ability to read fluently, to 
write a fair hand, to spell correctly, and to express thoughts in 
grammatical English; to solve problems of moderate difficulty 
under all the ordinary rules of arithmetic, and to demonstrate 
any ordinary arithmetical principle; to locate the principal 
cities, rivers, and mountains of the world, and to give the 
boundaries of any specified State of the Union; to parse the 
words of any ordinary English sentence, and to correct ungram- 
matical English ; to solve equations of two unknown quantities ; 
to describe the leading events in the history of the United 
States. 
1. In the main, the examinations should be written, but cer- 
tain intellectual qualities can best be treated in the oral way. 
2. The ability to think and to reason is of more importance 
than mere attainment of facts and rules. General intelligence 
and brightness may offset some deficiencies in mere book- 
learning. 
3. Good breeding, politeness, and a pleasant manner should 
be counted in a candidate’s favor. 
VIII.—A scholarship is good for any two consecutive years 
above the Junior Class—that is, for Middle and Senior, or for 
Senior and Baccalaureate, or for Baccalaureate and Post Grad- 
uate. 
1. When scholarship students reach the college they will not 
be re-examined for admission. 
2. As the number of scholarships is small compared with the 
number of competitors, it will often happen that some of those 
who miss the prize are competent to enter the Middle Class of 
the College. When persons of this class desire to enter the 
College they will, on application, receive from their State Su- 
periutendent a specraL cEertirtcaTE, which will admit them to 
the College without further examination. County Superintend-
-P-A-G-E-235

ents in Tennessee will be furnished with special certificates to 
be used as above. 
3. Students who have gained admittance to the Middle Class 
have the privilege of being examined for any of the high 
classes. 
4. The completion of the senior course entitles the students 
to the degree of Licentiate of Instruction (L. I.), of the Bac- 
calaureate Course, to the degree of A. B., and of the Post 
Graduate Course, to the degree of A. M.

‘ RE POR 
OF THE 
MoARD OF TRUSTEBS 
OF THE UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE. 
Hon. F. M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction : 
Dear Str—The Board of Trustees of the University of Ten- 
nessee respectfully present, in accordance with law, this, their 
biennial report for the period ending December 20, 1888. 
This period has been marked by important changes and by 
many improvements in the University. 
For the want of the proper equipment, which was never pro- 
vided by the State, and which it was prohibited by law from 
providing, even in a small part, from its income, the Univer- 
sity has long been prevented from undertaking much of that 
scientific and technical instruction which it desired to, and 
should have undertaken, under the Land-grant Act. - It re- 
quired buildings, machinery, tools, scientific instruments, farm 
buildings, stock, etc., to carry on an agricultural and me- 
chanical college of the best kind. Under the terms of the 
grant referred to, and which was accepted by the State of Ten- 
nessee, it was clearly the duty of the State to provide these 
things. 
Under the contract made with the State this Board was also 
prevented from purchasing such equipment with its original 
 
-P-A-G-E-241
     — 240 — 
property. That contract would not allow us to sell any of this, 
so there were no funds left for improvements of this nature, 
except such as could be saved from the small earnings of the 
University. As we were bound by our contract with the State 
to give free tuition to a large number of Tennessee students, 
those earnings have always been and must continue to be very 
small. 
REORGANIZATION. 
During the past two years the Board has taken advantage of 
the opportunity offered it, incidentally, by the appropriation 
made to this State by the Congress of the United States, under 
the so-called “Hatch Bill,” the proceeds of which were be- 
stowed, in due course, upon this University by the last General 
Assembly, to reorganize the course of instruction and the entire 
operations of the Agricultural Department of the University. 
Encouraged by this aid, some friends came forward and 
agreed to advance the University some twelve thousand dol- 
lars, provided the Board would invest an equal amount, to be 
saved out of earnings over which it had control, in a building 
for the Agricultural and Natural History Departments, a build- 
ing for the Mechanical Department, and some other much 
needed improvements. This proposition was accepted, and the 
improvements suggested were made. 
For a description of these buildings and the improvements 
made, you are respectfully referred to the accompanying re- 
ports of the President and the Professor in charge of the 
Mechanical Department. 
When these facilities for doing more and better scientific, 
agricultural, and technical work were offered, the Board de- 
cided promptly to reorganize all the Courses of Study and the 
entire Corps of Instruction, so as the better to carry out the re- 
quirements of the Act to “provide colleges for the benefit of 
Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts,’ and “where the leading 
object shall be, without excluding other scientific and classical 
studies, and including military tactics, to teach such branches
-P-A-G-E-242
— 241 — 
  of learning as are related to agriculture and the mechanic arts, 
* * * in order to promote the liberal and practical educa- 
tion of the industrial classes in the several pursuits and profes- 
sions of life.” 
The reorganization was thorough and complete. The courses 
of study in agriculture and the related sciences were made more 
perfect, and that in mechanics was made practical and effective. 
Several new courses of study, too, bearing directly upon the 
other gréat industries of the State, like mining and manufac- 
turing, were arranged. 
The President has explained and described these courses of 
study in his report, to which you are referred. 
In order to carry out these new courses of study effectively, 
the corps of instruction was rearranged and four new chairs in 
subjects connected with agriculture and mechanic arts were 
established. 
Dr. Charles W. Dabney, Jr., at that time State Chemist of 
North Carolina, and director of the North Carolina Agricul- 
tural Experiment Station, was elected President of the Uni- 
versity, and entered upon his duties in August, 1887. Some 
delay in getting the expected appropriation under the Hatch Bill 
embarrassed us greatly, but this was finally secured last spring, 
and the work was commenced on the new plan in September of 
this year. 
The new faculty consists of nine professors, three associate 
professors, two assistant professsors, and five instructors— 
eighteen in all. 
These were selected with regard to fitness alone, and repre- 
sent thirteen of the leading universities and colleges of this 
country and Europe, and ten different States. 
The instruction at the University is now arranged in ten 
schools, as follows: Agriculture, Mechanical Engineering, An- _ 
16—s. ‘8. P. 1.
-P-A-G-E-243
TS ONOVa 
  cient languages, English and Modern Languages, Mathematics 
and Civil Engineering, Analytical Chemistry and Metallurgy, 
Agricultural Chemistry, Botany and Horticulture, Biology and 
Zoology, and Military Science and Tactics. Each of these 
schools has a professor at its head, with assistant professors and 
instructors, as may be necessary. 
Some of these schools are very much crowded, and need to be 
divided. The School of Mathematics, for instance, has one 
hundred and ninety-six students, divided into twelve sections. 
Three instructors are occupied for the whole of their time, and 
two others for a portion of their time. Means should be pro- 
vided to divide this school into two, 
The School of English is also too full, and the professors 
and instructors in charge find it very difficult to do the students 
justice. There are, for example, ninety-three Freshmen in 
English, divided into two sections. There is work for another 
‘man in this school. 
_ Physics is connected with Mechanical Engineering at present, 
but should be established as an independent chair, and have a 
building properly furnished to itself. In an institution which 
has to make a specialty of the sciences this important depart- 
ment should certainly stand on an independent basis. 
Mineralogy and Geology are at present connected with the 
chair of Analytical Chemistry and Metallurgy. In the Uni- 
versity of a State so largely interested in mining as ours is, 
these subjects should surely receive at least all of one man’s 
time. It would pay the State magnificently to establish a 
School of Mineralogy and Geology in this the center of Ten- 
nhessee’s mining interests. With this addition to the corps of 
instruction, and the new chemical and metallurgical laboratory, 
which we now ask for, the University could organize a school 
for mining engineers and metallurgists equal to any in the 
country. It is known to the Board that there are now sixteen 
young mining engineers in East Tennessee at work to-day, all 
of them from the North. We are informed that there is work
-P-A-G-E-244
— 243 — 
  enough in Tennessee for fifty. Tennessee’s own young men 
might do this work, and it is plain that it would be of incaleu- 
lable value to the State in unlocking these hidden treasuries of 
wealth. 
The great need of the University at the present time is a 
new chemical and metallurgical laboratory. It is evident that 
an institution designed to promote agriculture and the other 
industries of the State must provide for good and practical in- 
struction in chemistry, first of all. You are earnestly petitioned, 
therefore, to make an appropriation at this session of at least 
twenty-five thousand dollars to build and properly furnish and 
equip a chemical laboratory. The rooms used for a laboratory, 
heretofore, were in a damp basement, and were totally unsuited. 
The erection of a good, working laboratory would, we believe, 
contribute more to the development not alone of the mining, 
but also the agricultural and general resources of the State, 
than any thing which could be done here. 
The report of the Building Committee shows that the new 
buildings and improvements made at the University this year 
cost—

Four thousand five hundred dollars of the amount advanced

  egies 
by friends of the University bears no interest. The General 
Assembly is earnestly petitioned to make an appropriation to 
pay off this indebtedness. It is only an act of simple justice 
to do so, aid to do so at’once. The State, which has never 
given any thing toward buildings and equipment for the Uni- 
versity, will certainly not consent for private parties to carry 
burdens which are some inconvenience to them, but will 
amount to almost nothing to it. 
The Mechanical Building erected this year is only partially 
equipped with machinery and tools. Those things were ob- 
tained which were necessary for the lowest classes in the school, 
and these classes have made an excellent start. There are 
nearly one hundred students in the various classes of this 
school at present, though the majority of them are in the low- 
est class, taking lessons in drawing and wood-work, in prepara- 
tion for the Mechanical Course proper. Next term and the 
term following they will need much better facilities in the way 
of tools and machinery, and the General Assembly is requested 
to make an appropriation of ten thousand dollars to complete 
the equipment of this school. 
Since the establishment of the Agricultural Experiment Sta- 
tion here it is more than ever desirable to have better buildings 
at the farm. Only three thousand dollars out of last year’s ap- 
propriation to the Experiment Station could be used for the 
purpose of erecting a building, or repairs to buildings; only 
seven hundred and fifty dollars can be taken for this purpose 
out of each annual appropriation. The buildings at the farm 
are entirely unworthy of the State, and are not in any sense 
proper models for the farmers of the State. Eight thousand 
dollars would be the lowest amount with which proper build- 
ings can be provided, and you are earnestly requested to set 
this amount aside for this purpose. 
STATE SCHOLARSHIPS. 
Considerable misunderstanding has existed in the minds of 
your members with regard to the method of appointing young 
men to State Scholarships. For an explanation of the details
-P-A-G-E-246
  — 245 — 
  of this subject reference should be made to the report of the 
_ President. These State Scholarships secure to the student 
free tuition, worth sixty dollars a year. Under the law the 
University is only required to take two hundred and seventy- 
five students from the State of Tennessee, free of tuition at one 
time, this being the number required to allow three to each 
Representative and two to each Senator at the time the law 
was passed. The number of Senators and Representatives in 
the present General Assembly has increased considerably over 
the number at that time, and these scholarships need to be re- 
apportioned among the members of the Legislature. The ap- 
portionment of two to each: Representative and two to each 
Senator would be as accurate as it can be made. It is hoped 
that the General Assembly will relieve the confusion which ex- 
ists on account of the false apportionment now made, or else 
make an appropriation to the University to cover the tuition of 
the additional ninety-one scholars which would be called for by 
an apportionment on the basis of three to each Representative 
and two to each Senator in the present General Assembly, 
making a total of three hundred and sixty-six (366) scholar- 
ships. The income on the proceeds of the sale of land, amount- 
ing to $23,760 per year, is allowed the University to cover the 
tuition of two hundred and seventy-five students. If the Leg- 
islature increases the number of free scholarships to three hun- 
dred and sixty-six it would be necessary for it to make an ap- 
propriation of about $8,000 per annum to cover the free tuition 
of ninety-one additional students. 
It is earnestly desired that this shall be done, and, if it is, the 
University will bind itself to establish the three new chairs 
above mentioned, and so much desired, to complete its organiza- 
tion—namely, the additional chair in the School of Mathematics 
and Civil Engineering, one for Physics, and another for Miner- 
alogy and Geology. In this manner free tuition can be extended 
to a large additional number of young men, and the character of 
instruction can be greatly improved at the same time. The ad- 
visability of this step will be apparent to all, we hope. 
During thé year 1888 two hundred and twenty-eight young
-P-A-G-E-247
— 246 — 
men enjoyed these free scholarships in the several departments 
of the University. Of these, one hundred and eighty-three were 
whites, and forty were colored. This is nearly a hundred more 
students than were in attendance two years ago; it is found 
that there will be demand for more free scholarships next year 
than are now in existence. The State should make provision 
for the free tuition at the University of all young men who are 
able to take its advantages. 
The instruction and other advantages provided for colored 
students at the Knoxville College, the established colored de- 
partment of the University, are fully equal to those provided 
for the whites, and to their demands for educational training. 
In respect of buildings, furniture, and equipments, they are 
probably better provided for than the whites. An arrangement 
has been made with the Knoxville College under which it sup- 
plies the general, mathematical, literary, and classical instruc- 
tion, while the agricultural, mechanical, and military instruction 
is provided directly by this Board. The colored appointees 
have regular and systematic instruction in sciences pertaining to 
agriculture, in practical agriculture, in practical mechanics, and 
in military tactics as required by law, under the direction of 
the Faculty of the University. The general instruction has al- 
ready been established with much success, but funds are greatly 
needed to provide them with a suitable industrial building, to 
contain drawing rooms and shops, similar to that put up at 
the University this year through the efforts of some of its 
friends. It is earnestly desired to erect such a building, at the 
earliest possible date, on a lot of land which has already been 
provided by the University, conveniently near the Knoxville 
College, and the General Assembly is urgently petitioned to 
make an appropriation of at least six thousand dollars for this. 
purpose. 
Arrangements have been made to give the same students 
practical instruction in military science, and as soon as the 
arms promised by the State, and expected to be delivered 
within a short time, are received, a proper quota of them will 
be set aside for the use of these students. The University has 
 
-P-A-G-E-248
  — 247 — 
  been unable, up to this time, to secure more than about half 
enough new and suitable arms for her students, but it is ex- 
pected that they will soon be provided through the Military De- 
partment of the State, or through the War Department of the 
United States. 
A resolution of the last General Assembly ordered this Board 
of Trustees to make arrangements for the tuition of colored 
appointees at both Knoxville College, Knoxville, Tenn., and 
Fisk University, Nashville, Tenn, As this Board had already 
made a contract with the management of Knoxville College to 
receive and educate all the colored appointees, and had entered 
into an obligation with tliem to pay them the tuition of such 
persons, the Board found itself unable, for this and other rea- 
sons which will be stated, to obey, at this time, this direction. 
In its embarrassment and desire to do all that it could do, 
under the law and its contract with the State, the Board sought 
the advice of a number of the most eminent attorneys in the 
State, and among others that of the Attorney-General. All these 
advisers concur in the opinion that the Academic Department of 
the University of Tennessee or State Agricultural and Mechan- 
ical College, had been located at Knoxville, and that none of its 
funds can be removed from this place; that the University could 
not establish two departments for the convenience of the colored 
students without subjecting itself to the demand for the same 
number for the whites, and that to recognize the authority of 
the Legislature to remove a portion of this fund from the Uni- 
versity at Knoxville would be the same as to acknowledge the 
power of the Legislature to remove the whole of the fund, be- 
fore proying that the University has failed to comply with the 
Act of Congress, as required by the law of the State. In the 
language of the Attorney-General, “The resolution of the Leg- 
islature, in my opinion, does not affect the question. An Act of 
the Legislature could not authorize the action insisted upon by 
Fisk University. Either would violate the obligation of the 
contract between the State and the University of Tennessee, 
and would therefore be void. Neither would be, in my opinion, 
within the .power over the University fund, reserved by the 
Legislature, ‘to control and manage’ it so far as ‘may be
-P-A-G-E-249
— 248 — 
deemed necessary for its protection and safety.’ (Code, See. 
340.) It would be, in effect, an exercise of power of removal of 
the fund which does not exist until the University shall forfeit 
its rights by failure to comply with the Acts of Congress.” 
This Board presents the claims of the University upon the 
State of Tennessee, at this time, with perfect candor and confi- 
dence, because it believes the people of the State should know 
that the State is responsible for its present condition, and must 
supply its needs. The General Assembly of the State of Ten- 
nessee had charge of the land granted to the institution by the 
Congressional Act of 1806, and again by that of 1862, and the 
present needy condition of the University, in respect of build- 
ings and equipment, is to be attributed to the neglect and mis- 
management of these grants by the General Assembly. 
The first grant made to the State, that by the Congress of 
1806, was almost entirely lost to the University through gross 
mismanagement, which extended over a long period of years. 
Squatters were allowed, by the State authorities, to settle on 
this land, and their rents or interest were remitted by nu- 
merous successive acts of the General Assembly until finally 
they had title by virtue of continuous possession. The State 
compelled the University to take a much smaller number of 
acres of land, of much inferior value, in place of that of which 
they had been deprived. For detailed history of this matter 
see the report of the President, and for the Acts of the General 
Assembly, see “Scott’s Revisal.” 
A part of the interest on the second Land-grant, that of 1862, 
was also lost to the University. The reports of the Treasurer 
of the University, between the years 1873 and 1877, show that 
it lost a total of $12,122.87 on State warrants given the Uni- 
versity in settlement of coupons. Reference to the Congres- 
sional grant of 1862 will show that the State was required by 
Congress, if it accepted the grant, as the State of Tennessee 
did, to pay all expenses of handling the land-scrip out of the 
treasury of the State, “so that the entire proceeds of the sale of 
said lands shall [should] be applied, without any diminution 
 
-P-A-G-E-250
      — 249 — 
whatever, to the purposes hereinafter mentioned” (section 3), — 
and “the annual interest sHall [should] be regularly applied 
without diminution to the purposes mentioned” (see section 5, 
paragraph 5, of the Act, in the Appendix). In paying this part 
with State warrants, which were not worth their face value, or — 
could not be cashed at the State Treasury at the time issued, 
the State has caused the University to lose this much of the in- 
interest it was bound to pay, and agreed to pay when it ac- 
cepted the grant. 
It is hoped that the Legislature will make an appropriation 
to discharge this equitable claim immediately. en 
Believing that the General Assembly will deal justly and 
generously with the University, to which it has intrusted the 
education of so many of the State’s sons, this report and accom- 
panying documents are respectfully submitted.

  REPORT OF THE PRESIDENT. 
To the Honorable the Board of Trustees: 
I have the honor, in accordance with your instructions, to 
submit this report on the present condition and needs of this 
University, and to append thereto the reports of the heads of 
the several departments of instruction: 
As the University has recently undergone, under your 
guidance, considerable change in its policy and a complete re- 
organization of its courses of study, and in connection there- 
with of its faculty and corps of instruction, these reports have 
been made full and explicit, not merely in the statement of facts 
as to the condition and needs of the institution, but in the dis- 
cussion of its history and policy as well. We cannot expect to 
succeed in the great work we have undertaken without the 
support of the intelligent people of the State, and to gain this, 
we believe that a full statement of the history, aims, and pur- 
poses of the University is all that is necessary. What is needed 
more than any thing else is to have every citizen of the State 
know correctly what the University of Tennessee is now doing. 
‘We are willing for the people of Tennessee, when thus in- 
formed, to be the final judges of its worth and work. 
ORGANIZATION OF THE UNIVERSITY. 
The University of Tennessee is an integral part of the public 
educational system of the State. As at present established it 
forms the capstone of this system, and is designed to com- 
plete the work begun in the public schools. It is intimately 
connected with the common and high schools by the law which 
provides that the best graduates of these schools shall receive 
appointments to State scholarships at this University. 
(256)
-P-A-G-E-258
  one 
The University, as at present constituted, rests upon two 
foundations, as we shall see below, first, the old East Tennessee 
University; second, the so-called “Land-grant” fund appro- 
priated to the several States by Act of Congress of July 2, 1862. 
This Act was designed to provide in each State “at least one 
college where the leading object shall be, without excluding 
other scientific and classical studies, and including military 
tactics, to teach such branches of learning as are related to 
agriculture and the mechanic arts.” 
The General Assembly of the State of Tennessee donated 
the proceeds of the sale of the lands granted to what was then 
the East Tennessee University, upon the condition that its 
Trustees should establish ‘an agricultural college so as to 
strictly conform to the Congressional enactment making the 
appropriation, and the fund hereby appropriated shall be used 
only according to the terms of the Congressional enactment 
making the appropriation to the State.” (The Code, Sec. 323.) 
The East Tennessee University supplied certain buildings and 
land, which was required to be supplied by the State under the 
original Act of Congress. The foundation was thus laid for 
the State University ; but the University has received no further 
aid from the State. 
The present organization of the Collegiate Department is 
designed to meet the requirements of the laws which provided 
this foundation. 
The departments of instruction comprise the following : 
A. Acapemic Department—AtT KNoxviLiz. 
I. The Collegiate Department, with the following Courses of 
Study: 
(a) Literary—Scientific Course. 
(6) Latin Science Course. , 
(¢) Course in Agriculture. 
(d) Course in Civil Engineering. 
(e) Course in Mechanical Engineering. 
(f) Course in Chemistry. 
(g) Course in Mining Engineering. 
£728 8..P)1.
-P-A-G-E-259
  — 258 — 
II. University, or Post-graduate Department. 
1. With courses for the graduate degrees of M. A., M.S., 
and Ph. D. 
2. With professional courses leading to degrees of C. E., 
Min. E., and Mech. E. j 
3. With courses for special students in the several depart- 
ments. 
B. ProrgesstonaL DepartmMent—Av NASHVILLE. 
First—A course in Medicine, leading to the degree of M. D.; 
and 
Second—A course in Dentistry, leading to the degree of D. 
D.S. 
The public funds are devoted exclusively to the maintenance 
of the College of Agriculture, Mechanic Arts and Sciences, 
‘forming the Collegiate Department of the University, at Knox- 
ville. When the State provides the means other university 
departments will be added, and those in existence will be fur- 
ther developed. 
The requirement of the Code (Section 339) that “ the accom- 
\\ modation and instruction of persons of color shall be separate 
_ from the whites” is met by providing corresponding “ accom- 
modations and instruction in such branches of learning as are 
related to agriculture and mechanic arts, and including mili- 
tary tactics,’ at Knoxville College, in Knoxville, Tennessee, 
for colored youths who pass the required examinations and 
receive appointments. (See below.) 
Tue Facutry. 
~The Faculty of the Academic Department consists of a 
President, Professors, and Associate Professors, and is aided 
by Assistant Professors, Instructors, and Assistants. It com- 
prises the following schools: 
1. School of Ancient Languages, with one professor and one 
instructor.
-P-A-G-E-260
Song 
  2. School of English and Modern Languages, with two pro- 
fessors and one assistant professor. 
3. School of Mathematics and Civil Engineering, with two 
professors and one instructor. 
4. School of Mechanical Engineering and Physics, with one 
professor and two instructors. 
5. School of General and Analytical Chemistry and Metal- 
lurgy, with one professor. 
6. School of Agricultural and Organic Chemistry, with one 
professor. 
7. School of Agriculture, with one professor and one assist- 
ant professor. 
8. School of Botany and Horticulture, with one professor. 
9. School of Biology and Zoology, with one professor. 
10. School of Military Science and Tactics, with one profes- 
sor, who is an Army Officer detailed by the U. S. Government. 
The Faculty as now organized consists, thus, of nine profes- 
sors, three associate professors, two assistant professors,- and 
five instructors, including an instructor in book-keeping. 
The Faculty of the Academic Department, Agricultural and 
Mechanical College, was organized in this form in June of this 
year. Heretofore there had been only six courses of study, 
viz.: The Agricultural, General Science, Engineering, Applied 
Chemistry, Classical. and Latin Science; and six chairs, viz.: 
Ancient Languages and Literature, Mathematics, Chemistry, 
and Mineralogy, Agriculture, Horticulture, and Botany, and 
Natural History (all in one chair), and a chair of Military Sci- 
ence (also Commandant of Cadets), with five instructors and a 
principal of the Preparatory Department. 
Let us notice the changes made in the courses of study and 
schools somewhat more in detail. 
Tue PREPARATORY DEPARTMENT 
has been abolished. Such a department has no place in a Uni- 
versity. A department of this kind, with a special head, would 
scarcely find place in a good college. As a separate department
-P-A-G-E-261
— 260 — 
the preparatory school has been, we hope, finally done away 
with. Such changes must be gradual, and we have had this 
Term a few “sub-Freshmen” classes in those subjects in which 
young men are most often deficient, but have only admitted 
those students to them who had a fair chance of catching up 
with the Freshman standard in these subjects in one year. The 
want of thorough preparatory schools in this State renders this 
necessary at present. 
These extra “sub-Freshman’’ classes will be dropped as soon 
as possible. 
Four new schools of study have been established, as follows: 
Mechanical Engineering and Physics, Agricultural and Organic 
Chemistry, Botany and Horticulture, Biology and Zvology. 
Mucuantcat Enainnertna 
was heretofore connected with the School of Mathematics and 
Engineering, and Physics was taught in connection with Chem- 
istry. These subjects were united, for the present, and the 
School of Industrial Mechanics and Physics was formed. A 
fine new building was erected for this school, which has been 
equipped with machinery and tools. Mr. J.S. Coon was elected 
Professor, and entered upon his duties the first of July. Prof. 
Coon isa graduate, with the degree of Mechanical Engineer, 
from Cornell University, and has had eight-years’ experience in. 
building and testing mining, water-works, and railroad ma- 
chinery, for the Calumet & Hecla Copper Mines, City of Chicago, 
and the Lehigh Valley Railroad, among others. 
Upon the petition of the Board of Trustees and the request 
of our Senators and Representatives, the Secretary of the Navy 
has detailed an engineer officer to serve as instructor at the 
University. The statute allows only twenty-five of these 
officers to be detailed for this duty at institutions having Schools 
of Engineering, and the University of Tennessee is very fortu- 
nate in haying the services of such an officer as Mr. Theodore 
¥F. Burgdorft, Passed Assistant Engineer of the U. 8. Navy. 
Mr. Burgdorff is Associate Professor of Engineering, and is a
-P-A-G-E-262
  — 261 — 
doing admirable work for the University. Every one would 
expect such an officer to do his duty, but for his untiring zeal 
in his work and his interest and assistance in the affairs of the 
University outside of his immediate classes, this gentleman, 
who stands to us very much in the position of a guest, deserves 
our heartiest thanks. 
AGRICULTURAL AND ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 
were made into a separate chair. The chair of Chemistry, as 
formerly constituted, included too much work. In an agri- 
cultural college these subjects should receive special considera- 
tion, and this is not likely to be secured in any other manner. 
The studies in this school all begin in the Junior year in the 
several courses, and a number of students are now preparing 
for them. The President has charge of this school. 
Tuer Scuoot or AGRICULTURE, 
which had Botany and Horticulture, all the Natural History, 
including Geology, connected with it heretofore—a sort of 
dumping ground for all the subjects not otherwise provided for— 
has been rid of all these burdens, and established on an inde- 
pendent basis. Prof. Charles 8. Plumb, who fills the chair, is a 
graduate of the Massachusetts Agricultural College, and was 
formerly one of the editors of the Rural New Yorker, and As- 
sistant Director of the New York. Agricultural Experiment 
Station. Prof. Plumb edits now a journal for agricultural ex- 
perts’ and scientific farmers entitled “‘ Agricultural Science.” 
It is the only professional journal of the kind in our language. 
Borany anp HorticuitTurg, 
which had heretofore been associated with Agriculture and 
the et ceteras, was made into a school to itself, as was abso- 
lutely necessary in such an institution. Prof. F. Lamson 
Seribner, who was elected and has entered upon his duties in 
connection with this school, is a graduate of the Maine Agri- 
cultural College. Prof. Scribner was formerly a professor in 
Gerard College, Philadelphia, and was recently at the head of
-P-A-G-E-263
— 262 — 
the Section of Vegetable Pathology of the Department of Ag- 
riculture at Washington. His school has been fairly well 
equipped with microscopes and other apparatus. It has re- 
cently acquired the very fine herbarium collections of Dr. A. 
Gattinger, of Nashville, Tenn., which are unrivaled for South- 
ern plants. 
BioLtogy and Zooiocy 
were erected into a separate school, with a professor in charge. 
This includes the physiology of domestic animals, economic 
entomology and human physiology, and forms a very full school 
still. Prof. Henry E. Summers, a graduate in Natural His- 
tory, and formerly a Fellow and an Instructor at Cornell Uni- 
versity, is at the head of the school. 
The chairs formerly in existence here have been greatly 
strengthened and improved. 
Tue Ancrent Lanevuaces 
are now in charge of Prof. T. W. Jordan, A. M., a graduate 
of the University of Virginia, formerly a professor in the Ken- 
tucky Wesleyan College, and more recently President of 
Emory and Henry College, with an instructor to assist him- 
Prof. Jordan has wisely decided, as few students elect the 
Greek, which is optional at present, to push the instruction in 
Latin and Literature as far as possible. Latin is now required 
through the Junior year in the Latin Scientific Course, and 
every effort will be made by the Professor to-make the instrue- 
tion in this language, its literature and history, as thorough as 
possible. When this has been well done we believe it will be 
time to insist upon the work in Greek. And for this another 
professor should then be provided. 
. 
Tue Enotish anp Mopern Laneauaces 
are under the direction of Prof. Charles W. Kent, a Master of 
Arts and Licentiate of the University of Virginia, and a Doc- 
tor of Philosophy of the University of Leipzig. Believing 
that instruction in our native tongue is just as valuable for
-P-A-G-E-264
— 263 — 
training as that in either the Latin, the Greek, or the German, 
the Professor has arranged a course of study in English which 
will equal, in point of time required and work to be done, 
those provided for either of the other languages. A class has 
been organized already for special studies in Old English, and 
the interest manifested by the students, in this and the other 
classes, is very encouraging. The French and German are the 
only other modern languages taught at present. - 
  History, Lireraturs, and PourrrcaL Science. 
Prof. Thomas ©. Karns,-a graduate of the University of 
Tennessee, and formerly Superintendent of Schools for Knox 
County and at Union City, Tennessee, and professor in Carson 
College, is associated with the School of English, and has, be- 
sides, charge of the instruction in Literature, History, and Po- 
litical Economy. Prof. Karns has introduced the laboratory or 
seminary plan of study in history and political science, and the 
good results are appearing already in the improved interest 
and thoroughness maintained, even in classes which have only 
tried these methods for one term. 
Tur Scnoot or Matuematics AND ENGINEERING 
is terribly crowded in the lower classes. There are one hun- 
dred and eighty-six students taking Algebra, Geometry, and 
Trigonometry, and we could not have possibly carried on the 
work in these subjects but for the valuable and most timely aid 
of Prof. Burgdorff, Associate Professor of Engineering, and 
Lieut. Gayle, Professor of Military Science and Tactics. The 
school needs more men init. It would be best, if possible, to 
divide the school into two, one of Pure Mathematics, and an- 
other of Applied Mathematics. There are now eight classes 
and twelve sections in this school, taught by five men, and 
there is demand for still other classes. Prof. William W. Car- 
son, the head of the school, is a Civil and Mining Engineer of ; 
Washington and Lee University, and a practical engineer of 
experience. He was formerly Professor of Mathematics at 
Davidson College, North Carolina.
-P-A-G-E-265
  eed 
Tue ScHoon or CHEMISTRY 
has been reorganized, as explained above. General and Ana- 
lytical Chemistry, Metallurgy, and Mineralogy and Geology, are 
now included in this school. Prof. Charles E. Wait, C. and M. 
E., of the University of Virginia, and formerly Professor in St. 
John’s College, and in the School of Mines of the Missouri 
University, is the officer in charge, and he has arranged a most 
profitable and attractive course of instruction and practical 
work, which has been commenced in spite of the inadequate 
laboratory and lecture room facilities. Among the many needs 
of the University, the greatest is this one of a chemica! labo- 
ratory. 
Tue Scnoon or Mrnrrary Scirunce anp Tacrtres, 
which has existed here in name, at least, for many years, has 
recived a strong impulse through the practical instruction of 
our present Commandant. The Board of Trustees sent a pe- 
tition over a year ago to the President to detail an officer of 
the army, as he was empowered to do by law, to serve as Pro- 
fessor of Military Science and Tactics in this University. The 
petition could not be granted until Congress increased the num- 
ber, and the officer was not secured until after the present term 
had commenced. The officer detailed is First Lieutenant Ed- 
ward E. Gayle, of the Second Artillery, U.S.A. Lieut. Gayle 
is a graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, 
and has the great advantage of having served as instructor, in 
addition, at West Point and at the U.S. Artillery School at 
Fortress Monroe. The University is already indebted to Lieut. 
Gayle for admirable services rendered it, and expects to derive 
very great benefit from his residence and work here. Lieut. 
Gayle will arrange the instruction in this school before the be- 
ginning of another session, so as to place it upon a permanent 
and strong basis. The University will soon receive her quota 
of cadet rifles, field pieces of artillery, accoutrements, imple- 
ments, ammunition, etc., from the U.S. Government, and the 
artillery and other kinds of drill will then be introduced. 8  
-P-A-G-E-266

Tue GovERNMENT AND DISCIPLINE 
of the students is vested in a Governing Committee of the 
Faculty, consisting of the President, the Dean of the College, 
and the Commandant of Cadets. 
The Commandant is the executive officer for discipline and 
government during study hours and in the dormitories. Capt. 
Kenneth G. Matheson, the Commandant, was trained in his 
profession at the South Carolina Military Academy, and served 
as Commandant of Cadets for several years at the Georgia 
Agricultural College, at Milledgeville. He has, by careful at- 
tention, firmness and zeal, combined with an excellent system 
and method of organization, made already a great improvement 
in the order, quiet, and attention to duty of the students. We 
have had this Term not a single case of serious disorderly con- 
duct. 
The Dean conducts the entrance examinations, classifies . 
students, and keeps the rolls and records, By asystem of very 
complete quarterly reports to parents he brings the University 
and its patrons much closer together, and makes the labot of 
educating their sons much more satisfatory to both parents and 
teachers. 
Tue Facurty. 
It will be interesting to notice the institutions represented 
in the present corps of instruction of the University Academic 
Department and the Experiment Station. 
The following Universities and Colleges are represented 
among the professors, instructors, and officers: 
German Universities (Leipzig and Goettingen), three; Uni- 
versity of Virginia, four; Cornell University, three; Massa- 
chusetts Agricultural College, two; University of Tennessee, 
three; Washington and Lee University, one; West Point, one; 
U. 8. Naval Academy, one; Maine State College, one; South 
Carolina Military Academy, one; Alabama Agricultural and 
Mechanical College, one; Miller School of Virginia, one.

  The representation by States is of less importance, though it 
has interest also. The above professors and instructors are na- 
tives of the following States: Four of Tennessee, five of Vir- 
ginia, three of New York, two of Massachusetts, one of 
Arkansas, one of Maine, one of New Jersey, one of Georgia, 
one of South Carolina, and one of Ohio. This shows beyond 
question that a broad and liberal policy was pursued in their 
selection. Your board has evidently sought for men, good in 
their professions, wherever they could be found. 
Reparrs. 
The University buildings have all been quite thoroughly 
overhauled and repaired during the last two years. This had 
been sadly needed for a number of years. These improvements 
have put these buildings in condition to be used for a while 
longer. But they can never be made what they should be, as 
they were all badly planned and poorly built. 
New Buornprnes. 
A substantial and convenient building was erected the past 
season for the School of Industrial Mechanics’ (see the report 
of this School). A large addition was made at the same time to 
the Agricultural Building, and the whole was completely re- 
modeled, as described below, to accommodate the Experiment 
Station and the connected University Schools of Agriculture, 
Botany, and Biology. 
A residence for the President has also been erected upon the 
University grounds. 
AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION. 
A matter of special importance to the University, and to the 
State at large, was the final appropriation last winter of funds 
for the Agricultural Experiment Station established here under 
the Hatch Bill. This resulted in the University securing, at 
last, the promised appropriation of $15,000 per annum.  
-P-A-G-E-268

The Tennessee Agricultural Experiment Station, established 
by the Board of Trustees of the University of Tennessee on 
June 8, 1882, has been reorganized in accordance with this Act 
and the Act of the General Assembly of Tennessee of March | 
28, 1887, which endowed this station with the benefits of the 
said Act of Congress. 
The Station already had the use of an excellent farm, but 
there were no suitable laboratories, or apartments for library or 
offices. These had to be provided first of all. 
The three thousand dollars, out of the first year’s appropria- 
tion for the Station, which was allowed to be used for this pur- 
pose, was insufficient to provide a building which would con- 
tain the needed laboratories. But the Board determined to put 
the Station immediately upon a broad foundation, and, at some ~ 
considerable sacrifice of other interests, set apart some additional 
funds for this purpose. 
A building for the Agricultural Department of the University 
had been started some years since, but never entirely finished, 
and not furnished at all. The walls, roof, and wood-work were 
completed when the work on it stopped. It was determined to 
build a wing to this considerably larger than the original 
structure, and to complete and furnish the whole for the ac- 
commodation of both the Experiment Station and the Agri- 
cultural Department. The original building, which forms the 
north end of the completed new building, was thirty by sixty 
feet, with a hall and staircase addition, and two stories high. 
The addition is sixty-two by fifty feet, with an entrance and 
staircase hall connecting it with the older building, and is two 
stories high, over a large, well-lighted and dry basement. é 
The necessary laboratories have been provided in the new — 
building, and the Station is now fully prepared to undertake 
any of the work required of it by the laws under which it is 
established. 
This Station is a bureau of information for farmers, and every
-P-A-G-E-269
    
Ao 
Tennessee citizen interested in developing our agricultural in- 
dustries or resources has the right to apply to it for any assist- 
ance that comes within its province, and the Station will re- 
spond to all applications as far as lies in.its power. 
The Station will have good facilities for analyzing and test- 
ing fertilizers, cattle foods, milk, and dairy products; seeds, 
with reference to their purity or germinating power; for identi- 
fying grasses and weeds, and studying forage plants; for in- 
vestigating the diseases of fruits and fruit trees, grains, and 
other useful plants; for making reports on injurious insects, 
and the best means of combating them; and for investigating 
the diseases of domestic animals. The Station will make such 
analyses, seed tests, reports, etc., for the citizens of Tennessee 
without charge. 
PUBLICATIONS. 
Besides the usual catalogues and announcements it is pro- 
posed i in future to issue the following publications from the 
University: 
“The Bulletins of the Agricultural Experiment Station of 
the University of Tennessee” are issued quarterly from that 
bureau, and sent to all persons actually engaged in agriculture 
who apply for them. ‘ 
The annual report of the Station will be sent to the same 
persons. ‘“ The Tennessee University Student” isa purely student 
journal, published by the young men of the Collegiate Depart- 
ment. It, is desired to issue occasional “ Circulars” consisting 
of short articles giving the results of research or discussions of 
points of interest to specialists as often as the material is supplied. 
Longer treatises on scientific or literary subjects will be pub- 
lished, if the means are provided, under the general title of 
ee University of Tennessee Publications.” Several such circulars 
and treatises are now ready, and others are in course of prepa- 
ration.

   ADMISSION. 
Under recently amended rules of the Board of Trustees all 
candidates for admission must be provided with credentials from 
their last school or instructor, giving evidence of good moral 
character, and must be at least fifteen years of age. 
For requirements for admission to the Freshman Class see 
the report of the Dean, which follows this report. 
Examinations for admission and classification will be held at 
the University according to law, beginning Monday, September 
3d, at 9 o’clock 4. M., and continue for three days. . All candi- 
dates for admission to the Collegiate Department must report 
to the Dean at that time. 
At the opening of the second term another opportunity for 
admission will be given, and the same rules will prevail. 
STaTE STUDENTS. Ve 
The method of appointment of State students is as follows: 
The State Superintendent of Public Instruction issues notices 
to the County and City Superintendents in the month of May 
of each year, requiring them to hold public examinations of 
candidates for appointments in their respective counties or 
cities, and giving directions as to their examinations, which are 
designed to select the best students, and to make sure that 
those appointed are prepared to enter the University. 
The County and City Superintendents are required to give 
public notice of the examinations and the advantages offered 
by the University, and to hold such examinations as may be 
necessary during the month of June. From the list of candi- 
dates found qualified and numbered in order of merit each 
State Senator can appoint two, and each State Representative 
three, to scholarships in the University. State Senators and 
Representatives can appoint other persons not on this list, but
-P-A-G-E-271
  -- 270 — 
in doing so they take the responsibility for their preparation. 
The students thus appointed must be at least fifteen years of 
age, and prepared to enter regular collegiate classes, as described 
above. Senators and Representatives are requested, as far as 
practicable, to make their appointments subject to these com- 
petitive examinations of applicants by the County or City Su- 
perintendents of Public Schools. As the usefulness of the Uni- 
versity is so largely dependent on the appointments of members 
of the Legislature, they are earnestly urged to give attention, 
that its benefits may be secured as widely as possible to the 
youth of the State in their respective counties and districts. 
In order that no worthy and qualified young men shall fail to 
get the advantages of the University, the President of the Uni- 
versity is authorized by law to appoint such qualified candidates 
to any vacancies which may remain to be filled in any county 
or district on the 10th of August of each year, after the Sen- 
ators and Representatives have completed their appointments. 
These appointments are only good for one year. 
The State scholarships secure the student free tuition. 
Under the law the University is required to educate two hun- 
dred and seventy-five students free of tuition at one time. 
This number needs to be reapportioned among the present 
number of Senators and Representatives. The apportionment 
of three to each Representative and two to each Senator was 
based upon the number of members in the General Assembly 
of 1869, when the law was passed. 
An apportionment of two to each Senator and two to each 
Representative would be, I believe, as near correct as it can be 
made for the present number of Senators and Representatives. 
Senators and Representatives must appoint from their own 
counties and districts. They can only appoint persons from 
other counties when none have been found qualified at the 
Superintendent’s examination in their own county, and then 
the person appointed must have first been examined and found 
qualified in his own county.
-P-A-G-E-272

  Tur APpPpoINTMENTS 
in force during the year ending may be classified as follows: 
Representatives appointed ninety-eight students who received 
free tuition. Of this number sixty-five were whites and thirty- 
three colored. Senators appointed twenty-one, nineteen of 
whom were whites. . 
Senators and Representatives together only appointed one 
hundred and nineteen out of the possible two hundred and 
seventy-five. This shows a very limited interest. The friends 
of the colored youth have taken decidedly more interest in the 
matter than the friends of the whites. 
During the year now closing, including some who were in 
attendance last session and are not attending now, State, 
County, and City Superintendents recommended one hundred 
and nine young men who were duly appointed by the President 
for one year, in accordance with the law, not including those 
examined by them and appointed by Representatives and, Sen- 
ators. Of this number one hundred and four were white, and 
five were colored.

The State Superintendent has recommended six. Only seven- 
teen Superintendents have aided in sending students to the Uni- 
versity, but the results in these cases show what might be done 
if all the Superintendents gave this matter their attention. 
A list of the counties and districts, showing the number of 
appointments made from each by Representatives and Senators, 
will be published with the annual catalogue soon. As a num- 
ber of appointments are now in the hands of persons who wilk 
present them at the beginning of the next term, it is impossible 
to make up an accurate statement at this moment. 
_ It may be stated now, however, that,. as the record stands at 
this writing, fifty-two Representatives have made no appoint- 
ments at all during their term. Twenty-one Senators have 
made no appointments.

Ihave the honor to submit below a history of the relations 
of the State to the University, with special reference to its 
finances. 
Tue UNIVERSITY AND THE STATE. 
This has always been in name a State institution. Its name 
has been changed several times, but every name, as well as 
every act of the General Assembly with regard to it, has_ 
marked it as‘a Tennessee institution, pure and simple. It was | 
chartered first in 1807 as Hast Tennessee College. Becoming | 
more ambitious, the General Assembly, in 1840, changed this 
to East Tennessee University. In 1879 it was made the Univer- 
sity of Tennnessee. But the astounding fact is that the State 
which gave it birth, and has undertaken to preside over its des- 
tiny, has given it, during three-quarters of a century, not one 
dollar of support, voluntarily and from its own treasury, Oth- 
ers have bestowed gifts upon it by permission of the State ; it 
has been repeatedly the recipient of Congressional or Federal 
aid, for transmitting which the State claims much credit; but 
the State itself has never once put its hand into its own vaults 
and drawn hence a gift for this child of its creation. 
The interest paid the University on money borrowed from it 
by the State is not a gift, but merely rent for the use of funds, 
which the State pays and would be required to pay to any other 
debtor, and which the Congress of the United States will re- 
quire the State of Tennessee to pay so long as it holds the prin- 
cipal, which constituted the gifts of Congress to this institution. 
The only money now received by this University from the State 
treasury is this interest money, paid in settlement of coupons 
eut from bonds which she holds, just as any private person 
might hold them. 
As surprising as it may be, this is the exact relation of the 
State and the University, as we shall directly show from the 
records and the laws. But the most amazing fact of all is, 
BS. 8.4 P. I.
-P-A-G-E-275
  EO 
that without ever having given it one dollar of its own to aid 
it, the State has charged this institution with the duty of edu- 
eating fhe youths of every and all sections of Tennessee, and 
during the last twenty years this institution has had to hold 
itself ready at all times to give “accommodation and instruc- 
tion ” free of charge to “two hundred and seventy-five students 
from the State of Tennessee.” 
This neglect of the institution was not excusable on the 
ground that others had endowed it amply, as will be shown be- 
low. It was the misfortune of the institution, to have been 
founded upon a Congressional grant, which looked great, but 
never yielded any considerable endowment, and, in a certain 
sense, it has been its misfortune to have received the proceeds 
of the so-called Land-grant, of which the State appears to have 
made an excuse for not giving it any thing. A consideration of 
these grants, their conditions and outcome, will show why the 
support they gave was totally inadequate to the needs of an in- 
stitution required to educate two hundred and seventy-five stu- 
dents, free, at one time. 
~ As has been stated above, this institution was established as 
a State College. Its foundation is intimately connected with 
the earliest history of the “Territory South of the Ohio” and 
the State of Tennessee, which grew out of it. The First Gen- 
eral Assembly of the Territory charted the College in 1794, and 
named it Blount College, in honor of William Blount, the then 
Governor of the Territory, and afterward one of the first two 
Senators from the State of Tennessee. 
Tue Lanp Grant or 1806. 
In the year 1806 the Congress of the United States passed an 
act entitled “ An Act to authorize the State of Tennessee to issue 
grants to certain lands therein described,” ete., which provided 
that there should “be one hundred thousand acres of land laid off 
on the south side of the Holston and French Broad and west 
side of Big Pigeon Rivers, to which the Indian claim had been 
extinguished, and that the proceeds of the sales of the said one
-P-A-G-E-276
— 275 — 
  hundred thousand acres of land should be appropriated in such 
way by the Legislature of this State that the profits thereof 
should be applied to the support of two colleges in this State— 
the one in East, the other in West Tennessee, to be established 
by the Legislature of this State. (See Appendix A—“An Act 
to establish a College in East Tennessee. Passed October 26, 
1807.”) 
In accordance with this Act of Congress the General Assem- 
bly of 1807 proceeded to establish “a college in Hast Tennes- 
see capable of receiving that part of said donation designed 
by said act to be given to the college to be established in East 
Tennessee.’ A charter was issued to “a body-politic and cor- 
porate by the name of the Trustees of East Tennessee Col- 
lege,” and setting forth that the said trustees * * * shall 
be endowed with, and receive in such manner as the General 
Assembly of this State may, from time to time, direct, that 
part of the donation aforesaid, which was designed for the col- 
lege in East Tennessee.” Blount College was merged into this 
at the same time. 
The college received. no other donation at this time. The 
land granted the State was supposed to be valuable, and it was 
thought that the proceeds of its sale would make each college 
quite wealthy. This expectation was not realized. The sales 
were badly managed by the State, and East Tennessee College 
received a very small fund from this source. Squatters oceu- 
pied the land of the college, and the General Assembly repeat- 
edly, for political effect, passed acts excusing these squatters 
from paying any rent for the land they held, and finally, when 
they had gotten possession by continued occupancy, it com- 
pelled the college to take a considerably less number of acres, 
of much inferior land, in another portion of the State in lieu of 
that turned over to the squatters. These are the simple facts. 
In this way a magnificent grant was lost for purposes of educa- 
tion. 
The General Assembly in 1840 changed the name of East
-P-A-G-E-277
  — 276 — 
Tennessee College to Hast Tennessee University, but it did not 
give it any additional funds; another misfortune. 
How the institution survived these trials and lived through 
these days. is almost a miracle. The truth is it, at times, 
scarcely lived at all. It was a constant struggle for existence, 
the most of the time it barely dragged itself along, while, at 
long intervals, it enjoyed brief periods of increased vigor, dur- 
ing which it carried itself hopefully and erect. 
That the institution survived at all is due to its favorable 
location at the gateway to the then growing and prosperous 
south-west, which had no institution of its own as yet, but had 
money to pay for the education of its sons; to the zeal, fidelity, 
and self-sacrifice of its friends, and to the energy, enterprise, 
and ability of its professors and officers. It is simply wonder- 
ful that the institution attained what it did in those days. Its 
supporters may well be proud of the good work accomplished 
“through many tribulations,’ but the State of Tennessee, as 
such, has small, if any, share in the credit. 
Tue Seconp Lanp-Grant—or 1862. 
In 1869 the General Assembly bestowed another Congres- 
sional grant upon this institution, the so-called Land-grant of 
1862. This produced a great deal larger fund than the first 
land grant, but it imposed such heavy obligations and such em- 
barrassing conditions upon the college at the same time, that it 
has been able to do but little more than barely live under this 
contract. As will be explained, this contract required so much 
free tuition, and tied up the already limited resources of the 
university in such a manner as to render development and 
progress almost an impossibility. 
The Act of Congress, entitled “ An Act donating public lands 
to the several States and Territories, which may provide col- 
leges for the benefit of agriculture and mechanic arts,” ap- 
proved July 2, 1862 (see appendix B.), was accepted with all of 
its conditions by the General Assembly of Tennessee in 1869
-P-A-G-E-278
  — 277 — 
(see 321 of the Code). This act, as is well known, donated 
certain land, or landscrip, to the several States and Territories, 
the proceeds of the sale of which should “ constitute a perpet- 
ual fund, the capital of which shall remain forever undimin- 
ished (except so far as may be provided in fifth section of this 
act), and the interest of which shall be inviolably appropriated 
by each State which may take and claim the benefit of this act, 
to the endowment, support, and maintenance of at least one 
college, where the leading object shall be, without excluding 
other scientific and classical studies, and including military tac- 
ties, to teach such branches of learning as are related to agricul- 
ture and the mechanic arts, and in such manner as the Legisla- 
ture of the States may prescribe, in order to promote the liberal 
and practical education of the industrial classes in the several 
pursuits and professions in life. (See section 4 of the Act, ap- 
pendix B.) 
One of the conditions of this act was that “no portion of said 
fund, nor interest thereon, shall be applied directly, under any 
. pretense whatever, to the purchase, erection, preservation, or 
repair of any building or buildings.” 
An AgrRIcULTURAL AND MECHANICAL COLLEGE. 
Another condition of this act states that “any State which 
may take and claim the benefit of the provisions of this act 
shall provide, within five years, at least not less than one college, 
as described in the fourth section of this act, or the grant to 
said State shall cease; and said State shall be bound to pay the 
United States the amount receivél of any lands previously 
sold.” 
This proposition is a plain one. The State must provide 
“not less than one college,” as described, and when it has done 
so the United States will endow it. The State must bind itself 
to provide all buildings and land. The only exception to this 
condition is that “one-tenth of the amount received by any 
State may be expended for the purchase of lands for sites of 
experimental farms” (sec. 5). This exception only proves the
-P-A-G-E-279
_ — 278 — 
  rule and shows that the State was expected, under the contract, 
to make appropriations for all the material portion of the col- 
lege, the buildings, land (except experimental farm), furniture, 
library, instruments, and apparatus for scientific laboratories, 
tools, and machinery for the mechanical department, barns, im- 
plements, and stock for the agricultural department, ete. 
The State was to provide “the College” with all that per- 
tained to it, while the United States provided a perpetual fund, 
the interest on which (to paraphrase the language of the act) 
was to endow, support, and maintain it. 
Let us see how the State of Tennessee performed its part of 
-the contract which it entered into when it accepted this land- 
scrip (the Code, Sec. 321), sold it, used the money, and issued: 
its bonds for the amount. 
Having done this it was its duty to pay the interest to sup- 
port a college of the kind described. The only institution hav- 
ing any thing like a State character, and in position to assist the 
State at all, was the then East Tennessee University. To the 
Trustees of this University the State made this proposal. See 
Code Sees. 322, 323, 824, and 326, as follows: 
322. The proceeds of the sale of the agricultural scrip, ap- 
propriated by Congress for the establishment of an institution 
fo learning devoted to agriculture and the mechanic arts, are 
appropriated to the University of Tennessee upon the restric- 
tions and conditions herein mentioned. 
e 
323. It shall be the duty of the Trustees of said University 
to establish an agricultural college so as to strictly conform to. 
the Congressional enactment making the appropriation; and 
the fund hereby appropriated shall be used only according to 
the terms of the Congressional enactment making the appro- 
priation to the State. 
324. As soon as the Trustees of said University shall have 
eompleted buildings for the accommodation of two hundred
-P-A-G-E-280
      — 279 — 
and seventy-five students, and shall have furnished the same 
with appropriate school furniture, and shall have provided 
suitable lands, not less in extent than two hundred acres, at a 
fair yon of values, not less than one hundred and twenty- 
five thousand dollars, it shall be lawful for the Governor of the 
State to issue to the Trustees of said University the bonds of 
the State in which the proceeds of the sale of the agricultural 
scrip have been invested. 
326. Two hundred and seventy-five students from the State 
of Tennessee shall, at all times; be entitled to receive free tui- 
tion in’said college, the said students to be appointed by the 
several Senators and Representatives in the General Assembly 
of the State, each Senator being entitled to appoint two, and 
each Representative three students, according to the population 
of counties represented by them. ? 
This proposal threw the burden of providing the dormitories 
and land necessary, including the land for the experimental 
farm, for which the Act of Congress allowed one-tenth of the 
amount resulting from the land sales, upon the Trustees of this 
institution, but it leaves the equipment, library, instruments, 
and apparatus for the scientific laboratories, the tools and ma- 
chinery for the mechanical department, and the barns, imple- 
ments, and stock for the experimental farm entirely unprovided 
for. The fact is, that it took all of the slender resources of the 
University of that day, with the exception of about ten thou- 
sand dollars, to acquire the additional land and put up the addi- 
tional buildings necessary to meet the terms of the proposal 
which looked so favorable to the friends of an institution who 
had struggled with severe poverty for over fifty years, and who 
had a complete faith that the State would supplement the aid 
now tendered, and enable them to do the exact work required. 
As what the Trustees of the institution were to do was 
clearly defined, viz.: Prepare dormitories for two hundred and 
seventy-five students and acquire not less than two hundred 
acres of land, “so that the whole property shall be worth, at a 
fair estimation of values, not less than one hundred and twenty- uw
-P-A-G-E-281
  — 280 — 
five thousand dollars,” it is plainly implied that the State bound 
itself to do all the rest that might be necessary in order to 
establish the College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts de- 
scribed in the Act of Congress. The Trustees were bound to 
provide only one hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars’ 
worth of the material equipment of the proposed College, and 
the State was bound, by its acceptance of the fund, to provide 
all the rest. 
We recur again to that third condition of section five of the 
act (Appendix B), which says: “Any State which may take 
and claim the benefit of the provision of this act shall provide, 
within five years, at least not less than one college, as described 
in the fourth section of this act, or the grant to said State shall 
cease,” and ask if any one will say that dormitories for two 
hundred and seventy-five students and two hundred acres of 
land makes a “college” within the understanding of the law? 
It takes buildings for recitation rooms, assembly hall, and 
library; furniture, apparatus, books, and a vast lot of accesso- 
ries to make an ordinary literary college. It takes scientific 
instruments and apparatus, with specially-designed laborato- 
ries, barns, implements, and stock, a machine-shop and tools, 
with a thousand other things in addition, to make a respect- 
able Agricultural and Mechanical College. It is ridiculous to 
talk about having a college like that described in section four 
of the act without these things. 
The fact is, the State has never provided this additional equip- 
ment. The Trustees of the University, having stripped them- 
selves of every thing they had in order to provide the land and 
dormitories required, have had no means with which to get 
any thing. They could not provide most of these things out 
of the income. 
The second condition of section five of the act says: “No 
portion of said fund, nor interest thereon, shall be applied, di- 
rectly or indirectly, under any pretense whatever, to the pur- 
chase, erection, preservation, or repair of any building or build-
-P-A-G-E-282
        Panos 
ings.” When the above contract was closed with the Staté the 
Trustees had, besides the buildings for the two hundred and 
seventy-five dormitories, as required, and a refectory connected 
therewith, only one college building, 60 x 60 feet, and two 
stories high, with three large and three small rooms. They 
needed a library, assembly hall, reading room, and about 
twenty recitation rooms, for the ordinary use of a college with 
two hundred and seventy-five students. They had only six 
rooms. 
The chapel, assembly hall, library, reading room, and two reci- 
tation rooms were located in the old building referred to, and 
ordinary dormitory rooms were taken for the rest. For twenty 
years nine-tenths of the lectures and recitations at this Univer- 
sity have been held in the common dormitories. The Univer- 
sity has no suitable academic building whatever. The buildings 
used are very old and dilapidated, and are poorly ventilated 
and lighted, being in no way adapted to the uses to which 
they are put. ‘The operations of the University are cramped 
and embarrassed in every way on account of them. Some of + 
them are fit for nothing except to be torn down for the brick in 
them. One of the great, the crying needs of the University is 
a commodious, convenient, well lighted and ventilated, central 
building for general academic work, and for a large hall and 
library, unless a separate building can be provided forthe last, 
purpose. We have now no single hall on the premises which 
will hold all of our own officers and students at one time.   
But it is impossible to mention here all of the needs of the 
University. The truth is, it needs nearly every thing in the way 
of equipment which it takes to make a good modern institu- 
tion. Perhaps the most needed separate building is a chemi- 
cal laboratory. The students of the University have worked ~ 
for over twenty years in a dark, badly-ventilated basement— 
an entirely unsuitable place.

The State has never provided any. The barn and the other

buildings on the farm are totally inadequate and unsuitable- 
New buildings are specially required there since the establish- 
ment of the Agricultural Experiment Station under the Hatch 
Bill. Only a small per cent. of that fund can be used for build- 
ings after the first year. 
‘We mention the needs of the University in these special di- 
rections merely as illustrations of the point made that the State 
has never really “established” the “college” in the full sense 
described in the Act of Congress. 
The requirements of the Mechanical Department supply us 
perhaps with a better illustration still. This fund was offered 
by Congress and accepted by the State of Tennessee for the 
purpose of establishing a College “for the benefit of Agri- 
culture and the Mechanic Arts” (title of the Act). For the 
purpose of teaching the mechanic arts workshops for wood,, 
iron, steel, and brass, forges, foundries, and drawing-rooms, 
equipped with tools, models, and machinery, are absolutely re- 
_ quired. Without these things there can be no instruction in 
these subjects. The State has never provided the means for 
this purpose; the Trustees had none. What has recently been 
accomplished in this direction was done by the assistance of 
friends. Herein alone the State has failed in one-half its duty 
under the engagement to establish a College “for the Benefit 
“of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts.” 
What other States have done for their agricultural colleges 
will illustrate what it takes to establish one on a proper basis. 
President Chamberlain, of the Iowa College, sent out a cireu- 
lar letter asking for information on this subject. The inform- 
ation obtained he has compiled, for a few States, in this form:

  Tf we had answered this circular letter, Tennessee would have 
stood at the bottom with a long line of zeros opposite her. 
These points are suflicient to show that it was a one-sided 
bargain which the ‘Trustees made with the State of Tennessee 
in this case. It was an ungenerous bargain because— 
First—It required them to give free tuition to two hundred 
and seventy-five State students (it has increased to three hun-_ 
dred and sixty-six now). Under easy appointment laws this de- 
prives the University practically of all tuitions. 
Second—It tied up nearly all the little property they pos- 
sessed in unproductive land and buildings. 
It may be justly claimed further that the University has been 
disappointed and positively wronged by the State in at least 
two respects : : 
First—By failing to provide the buildings, laboratories, shops, 
barns, ete., which it was bound to provide under its contract 
with the United States; it has placed the University under the 
odium of pretending to do what was impossible for it to do. 
Second—The contract with the State was on the basis of two 
hundred and seventy-five free students, or two for each Sena- — 
tor and three for each Representative, as the Houses were then 
formed. This principle, carried out as now proposed, would 
require the University to give free tuition to three hundred and
-P-A-G-E-285
  — 284 — 
sixty-six, or three for each Representative and two for each 
Senator, as the Houses are now constituted—that is, we are 
now required to educate free ninety-one more students than 
was first proposed. The State has grown, as it will and must 
grow for a great while to come, and there are more youths to 
be educated. But neither the endowment nor the income have 
been increased. The University has a just claim against the 
State on this score. An easy calculation will show that if an 
endowment of four hundred thousand ($400,000) dollars was 
necessary to educate two hundred and seventy-five students, 
about. one hundred and thirty thousand more would be re- 
quired to educate ninety-one more students. This illustrates, in 
a numerical manner, the unfairness of the theory that in endow- 
_ ing it with the proceeds of this land-grant the State had settled 
with this institution for all time. 
Third—A most palpable wrong was done this institution be- 
tween 1873 and 1877, when the interest coupons were paid in 
warrants and State money instead of currency. These war- 
rants were worth only ninety-two and ninety-eight cents on 
the dollar. The Treasurers’ reports for these years show that 
the University lost twelve thousand one hundred and twenty- 
two dollars and eighty-seven ($12,122.87) cents in this way. 
Ordinary justice would seem to require the State to make this 
good to the University. 
But enough has been said to show how poorly the State has 
done its part of the work of establishing a “ college for the ben- 
efit of agriculture and mechanic arts,” etl how badly the Uni- 
versity has heen supported in its efforts to do so. In what it 
has done the State may, perhaps, meet the technical require- 
ments of the act of Congress, but it has certainly fallen far 
short of its duty under the act. 
It is true that States are frequently but loosely bound by con- 
tracts and laws. The law-maker is too often the law-breaker. 
It is too frequently useless to plead laws and contracts with 
commonwealths and municipalities. But there is a general 
_-and economic argument for a real College of ‘Aperture and 
Mechanic Arts in Tennessee, which must not be patted:
-P-A-G-E-286
— 285 — 
  Tue Opsecr or Tuts CoLiEcE. 
The “leading objects” of these colleges were to be, in the 
language of the act, “to teach such branches of learning as are 
related to agriculture and the mechanic arts eae es anor 
der to promote the liberal and practical education of the indus- 
trial classes in the several pursuits and professions of lite.” 
As interpreted by the best authorities and illustrated by the 
best institutions, this means that these colleges are to teach the 
sciences, and train youth in the methods, of the two great pro- 
ducing industries, farming and manufacturing, including plant- 
ing, stock raising, mining, engineering, both mechanical and 
civil, and general business. They were to be polytechnic insti- 
“tutes, not mere manual labor or industrial schools—though sci- 
entific men, engineers, and farmers should all be trained to 
work with their hands—but schools of the natural sciences, 
of engineering and technology ; not schools to train farm labor- 
ers, miners, mechanics, and mere artisans, for these can be best 
trained on the farm, in the mine, or the shop, but institutes for 
the education, in the broadest sense of that word, of the future 
scientific agriculturist, the mining engineer and metalurgist, 
the mechanical engineer, and the manufacturers of our country. 
It would be entirely unnecessary to stop to show that our 
country, and especially our State, needs such trained experts. 
We have boasted about the “wonderful resources of the 
South” and their “development” until we are sick of the very 
words. But we do want to see something made out of them. 
What are our boasted climate, our fertile soils, forests of 
timber, or mountains of ore to us, until turned into wealth ? 
We are more weary still of this wretched twaddle about the 
“need of the immigration of skilled labor and of capital” to 
the South. Our best “resources” are our robust young men 
and women. We want to “develop” the power that is in them. 
This can only be done by education, and if we want to “ de- 
velop our resources” we must educate our youth in the sciences 
and the useful arts.
-P-A-G-E-287
  Eg86 
Tue Demand ror Practica, Magn. 
Nine-tenths of the engineers in our mines and on our rail- 
roads, and the skilled mechanics in our shops and factories, are 
imported. Our chemists, electricians, architects, and mechan- 
ical engineers, all come from the North, or abroad. This is well, 
but not best. The mechanic who comes from Pittsburgh with 
his kit of tools to set our boilers, adjust our engines, and 
arrange our factories, will do his work, pack his kit, and, like 
the Chinaman, take himself and his earnings back to the land 
he came from. Foreign capital acts in very much the same 
way. It is well enough to have English speculators buy up our 
valuable mineral and timber lands and work them, even if the 
“profit goes back to London, but it would be a great deal better, 
even if it came not quite so soon, if our own young men sup- 
plied the brains to open up, and the money to own, these prop- 
erties. 
The only sure way to develop a country is by developing its 
people. The boys of to-day are the men of to-morrow. The 
only permanent development is the education of, the develop- 
ment of power in, the man. To this end we need more schools 
of science and technology in the South. Custom and tradi- 
tions are leading our Southern colleges and universities to de- 
vote their attention too exclusively to languages and literature. 
It is folly to continue, as Huxley expresses it, “in this age of 
full modern artillery to turn out our boys to do battle in it, 
equipped only with the sword and shield of an ancient gladi- 
ator.” The chemist’s balance or the engineer’s transit are better 
instruments for these times. 
In a scientific age and an industrial section an exclusive ed- 
ucation in the dead languages is a curious anomaly. The flow- 
ers of literature should indeed be cultivated, but it will not be 
wise to send men into our fields of industry to reap the harvest 
when they have been taught only to pick flowers and push 
aside the wheat. 
Our youth have the capacity and taste for these pursuits equal
-P-A-G-E-288
  Soe 
to any others. President Walker, of the Massachusetts Insti- 
tute of Technology, makes, in a recent report, the following re- 
marks, which are most pertinent to this subject. Says he: 
«Among the gratifying features is the appearance of students 
from eleven Southern States. Believing, as I do, in the almost 
boundless possibilities of industrial growth in that portion of 
our country, it is with keen delight that I see so many of the 
generous youths of the South turning from the rhetorical and 
dialectic exercises, which so engrossed the educational interests 
of the generations past, to qualify themselves, by scientific and 
technological study and practice, to lead and direct the develop- 
ment of the industrial energies and the natural resources of 
that fair land.” 
It is a trite but true remark that we need to diversify our in- 
dustries. Industrially and commercially our.country is not in 
a healthy condition. We buy too much abroad and make too 
little at home. This subject is so important, and so intimately 
connected with our industrial and technical college, that a 
fuller consideration of it is justified. 
InpustRiaAL Cuances or THE Last Turrty YEARS. 
All of the important industries were represented on the old- 
time Southern farm. The wagon, plow, and blacksmith shop, 
the mill, the tannery, and the spinning and weaving house were 
the farm factories. In those days our people lived on the pro- 
ducts of the farm to a great extent. Now-a-days they live out 
of the stores. 
There was not such a need for technical schools in those | 
good days as there is now. The boy saw the illustrations of - 
simple industries everywhere, and daily opportunity was af- 
forded him of trying his hand at some of them. Though he 
had far less familiarity with books, he had a much better ac- 
quaintance with the realities of life. 
Every observer must see that the manufacturers are steadily 
leaving the farms and firesides of our people, and with them
-P-A-G-E-289
ae ; eo 
the best opportunities for the industrial training of youth. 
Now the tendency everywhere is toward the concentration of 
industries. Even the small factories in the towns are dying 
out. Great combinations of capital choke out the small ones, 
and all the manufactures are collecting in the great cities. 
This movement tends to make an agricultural section more and 
more dependent and helpless. 
  Now, do not the people of the South know what this means 
by this time? Have we not learned that the farming profession 
bears a very undue share of the burdens of all kinds? The 
farmers are the only people who do not “combine.” We are 
yet to hear of a farmers’ cotton “trust” or corn “ trust.’ The 
result is that the financial system of the country, the corpora- 
tion laws, the tariff laws, the railroad, and nearly all the laws 
are against the land and the land owners. That property, 
which is the foundation of all prosperity, is made to bear 
“nearly all the burdens, and that man who should be the freest 
in the world is made the “ hewer of wood and drawer of water” 
for every other class. To remain an exclusively agricultural 
people, and to buy all we need, means continued financial and 
commercial dependency, continued slavery to every other class 
and interest—continued poverty. 
We hear a good deal in the cotton growing sections, particu-~ 
larly, about the poor, shiftless farmer who mortgages his farm, 
his mules and implements, his very crop itself, six months 
before it is made, to the commission merchant who “runs” 
him. He is but a type of the country, or State, which lives, in 
these days, upon farming alone. The State with only one in- 
dustry, or one leading means of making a living, is just as 
badly off as the farmer with only one mortgaged crop. I have 
somewhere seen this illustration used: The South produced, 
we will say, $300,000,000 of cotton last year. Suppose we 
keep the whole crop, for one year, at home for manufacture and 
distribution. You begin by scattering $300,000,000 through 
our land, the price of the raw cotton. Next, let us spin it 
. into yarns, and we almost double its value, and in doing so put 
nearly $300,000,000 in the pockets of our people. You have
-P-A-G-E-290
  pao — 289 — 
= now about $600,000,000 worth. Now weave these yarns into 
the best cloth, and you again double its value. You have 
$1,200,000,000 worth of property, or four times what your 
crude material was worth. Sell it now and you have almost 
enough money to pay the National debt. This is the possibil- 
ity. It is an ideal case, and the commerce of the world does 
not work in an ideal way, but the nearer we approximate this, 
the better it will be for us. 
There is a great deal of meaning in what Emerson said, 
“Tf you do not use the tools, they will use you.” If you do 
not use machines yourself, the men who do use them will 
make a tool and a slave of you. : 
The genus homo has been described by the naturalist as the 
tool-using animal. Certainly the higher he gets up in the 
scale of being the more does he use tools. Ours is the age of 
tools. I believe it was Sir John Lubbock who said: “The 
old poet chose for the theme of his song‘ Arms and Men.’ 
‘Tools and Men’ should be the theme of the epic of this 
century.” 
The State must promote higher education in all departments, 
but there are these great economic reasons why it is especially 
interested in scientific and technical education. Science and 
technology have direct influence upon the lives and fortunes of 
the people, and promote the industries which it is the Pee 
duty of the State to cherish. 
Stare anp Cuurcu CoLuecEs. 
In our country there are two great classes of Universities, or 
institutions for higher education: 1, the State Schools; 
2, the Denominational or Church Colleges. Each class has . 
most excellent reasons for its existence. On the one hand, the ~ 
Christian parents of any denomination have a perfect right, 
and a sound motive, for desiring that their sons shall be 
trained, especially in their earlier years, according to their own 
peculiar ideas as to religion and morals. On the other hand, 
Poe 8. P. ‘I:
-P-A-G-E-291
— 290 — 
  the State must see to it that all young men are educated for 
the greatest usefulness and the highest success in life. State 
aid to higher education has become an established fact, and a 
leading portion of the policy of all enlightened governments, 
though the time was when it was vigorously attacked by the 
clerical element, as it rarely is now, except in the most back- 
ward and ignorant communities. All true religion and philos- 
ophy teach us that we are our “ brother’s keeper,” and, amidst 
all these classes and sects among men, there is no other omni- 
present and impartial agent except the State, to see to “our 
brother’s”’ proper education. 
The clerical influence has, properly enough, caused denomina- 
tional colleges to devote themselves in the past, almost exclu- 
sively, to the cultivation of literature and the classics. In this 
field, this class of institutions has done an unspeakably vast and 
far-reaching work in America. Nearly all of our American 
universities were founded upon church schools. The devoted 
' pastor who taught the children during the week, and the grown 
people on the Lord’s day, laid the foundations for good educa- 
tion in this country. The old Dominie did the pioneer work, 
and did it well. But he and his schools can never, from the 
nature of his training, become a leader in scientific research 
and in making correct interpretations and applications of 
science. It is his business, following St. Paul, to fight “science 
falsely so-called,” and while doing this, history shows that he 
is not a particularly good friend of true science or of any thing 
new in science. Hence it has become the special province of 
States to promote the natural sciences, both general and eco- 
nomic. Without neglecting languages, literature, or philoso- 
phy, as the church colleges do not omit the natural sciences 
altogether from their courses, State institutions are particularly 
charged with the advancement of knowledge in this depart- 
ment. Ina measure the one class of institutions is the comple- 
“ment of the other. It is safe to say that neither can, or should, 
tale fully the place of the other in our American system of 
education, though the State school is steadily tending to and 
must ultimately become, everywhere, the broadest and the most 
liberal, and realize most fully the true university idea.

   Tuomas JEFFERSON ON Stave Epucation. 
In the famous report of the Commissioners of the State of 
Virginia, appointed to organize the University of Virginia, Mr. 
Jefferson gives us an argument for higher education by the 
State which has never been surpassed, and a plan which 
American institutions have taken over a half century to even 
approximate in execution. He classifies the objects of the 
higher education as follows: 
“1, To form the statesmen, legislators, and judges, on whom 
public prosperity and individual happiness are so much to 
depend. 
“2. To expound the principles and structure of government, 
the laws which regulate the intercourse of nations, those formed. 
munieipally for our own government, and to promote a sound 
spirit of legislation, which, banishing all unnecessary restraint 
on individual action, shall leave us free to do whatever does not 
violate the equal rights of another. 
«3. To harmonize and promote the interests of agriculture, 
manufactures, and commerce, and by well-informed views of 
political economy to give a free scope to the public industry. 
“4. To develop the reasoning faculties of our youth, enlarge 
their minds, cultivate their morals, and instill intotthem the 
precepts of virtue and order. 
«5. To enlighten them with mathematical and physical 
sciences, which advance the arts and administer to the health, 
the subsistence, and comforts of human life. 
«6, And, generally, to form them to habits of reflection and 
<orrect action, rendering them examples of virtue to others, 
and of happiness within themselves.” 
Dr. Adams, in his paper on Thomas Jefferson and the Uni- 
__ yersity of Virginia, says: “There is so much doubt in the mind 
 
-P-A-G-E-293
— 292 — 
of the average American citizen as to the duty of government 
to foster science and education of the highest sort, that it is 
worth while to call attention to the views of Jefferson upon 
this point. If the father of American democracy could enter- 
tain such views as these, the sons of the people need have no 
fears that the functions of the State are abused when directed 
toward the maintenance of a university or the advancement of 
science. Jefferson said, in his report to the Virginia Legisla- 
ture: ‘Some good men, and even of respectable information, 
consider the learned sciences as useless acquirements; some 
think that they do not better the condition of man; and others 
that education, like private and individual concerns, should be 
left to private, individual effort; not reflecting that an estab- 
lishment embracing all the sciences which may be useful and 
even necessary in the various vocations of life, with the build- 
ings and apparatus belonging to each, is far beyond the reach 
of individual means, and must either derive existence from 
public patronage or not exist at all. This would leave us, then, 
without those callings which depend upon education, or send 
us to other countries to seek the instruction they require. * * 
* Nor must we omit to mention the incalculable advantage of 
training up able counsellors to administer the affairs of our 
country in all its departments, legislative, executive, and judi- 
cial, and to bear their proper share in the councils of our Na- 
tional Government; nothing more than education advancing 
the prosperity, the power, and the happiness of a nation.’”’ 
  Renation or Epucatton to Morats anp Res icion.. 
The strongest side of Jefferson’s educational philosophy was 
its bearing upon good morals and social progress. “ Educa- 
tion,” he said, “generates habits of application, of order, and 
the love of virtue, and controls, by the force of habit, any 
innate obliquities in our moral organization. We should be far 
from discouraging the persuasion that man is fixed, by the 
law of his nature, ata given point; that his improvement is a 
chimera, and the hope delusive of rendering ourselves wiser, 
happier, or better than our forefathers were. As well might it 
be urged that the wild and uncultivated tree, hitherto yielding
-P-A-G-E-294
  — 293 — 
sour and bitter fruit, can never be made to yield better; yet 
we know that the grafting art implants a new tree on the 
savage stock, producing what is most estimable both in kind 
and degree. Education, in like manner, ingrafts a new man on 
the native stock, and improves what in his nature was vicious 
and perverse into qualities of virtue and social worth. And 
it cannot be but that each generation, succeeding to the 
knowledge acquired by all those who preceded it, adding to it 
their own acquisitions and discoveries, and handing the mass 
down for successive and constant accumulation, must advance 
_ the knowledge and well-being of mankind, not infinitely, as 
some have said, but indefinitely, and to a term which no one can 
fix and foresee. * * * What but education has advanced 
us beyond the condition of our indigenous neighbors? And 
what chains them to their present state of barbarism and 
wretchedness but a bigoted veneration for the supposed super- 
lative wisdom of their fathers, and the preposterous idea that 
they are to look backward for better things, and not forward, 
longing, as it should seem, to return to the days of eating 
acorns and roots, rather than indulge in the degeneracies of 
civilization?” 
Tue University and THE Common Scuoots. 
In another place Dr. Adams justly says: “Jefferson never 
advocated the university at the expense of common schools. 
He labored for both forms of popular instruction, although he 
always maintained that primary education should be based 
upon local taxation and self-help with, perhaps, some assistance 
from county or State sources where local means were inade- 
quate. As to the relative importance of the university and 
common schools for the people of Virginia, he once said, in a 
letter to his friend Joseph ©. Cabell, January 13, 1823: 
“Were it necessary to give up either, the primaries or the 
university, I would rather abandon the last, because it is safer 
to have a whole people respectably enlightened than a few in a 
high state of science, and the many in ignorance. This last is 
the most dangerous state in which a nation can be. The na- 
tions and governments of Europe are so many proofs of it.’
-P-A-G-E-295
Heo9o4 
“Tt is, however, a matter of historical’ fact that civilization 
began with the higher education of a few, and that all forms 
of popular culture have proceeded from higher sources. New 
England and Virginia both began with classical schools and - 
‘colleges. Jefferson himself was compelled to repeat the uni- 
versity experiment of the Old World for the higher education 
of democracy in Virginia. In the development of popular ed- 
ucation, as of popular government, there have always been rec- 
ognized leaders. Neither science nor religion could have gone 
forth in fertilizing streams for the benefit of mankind unless. 
there had been mountain sources above the plain. The wisdom 
of the Egyptians was that of ‘afew in a high state of science.” 
Moses was trained in one or more of those sacred colleges. 
In no way can we better account for the mental, moral, and re- 
ligious improvement of the race than by recognizing the influ- 
ence of chosen men, chosen tribes, chosen peoples, and chosen 
institutions that have served to train the masses to a knowledge 
of higher things. The common schools of America sprang 
from sources higher than themselves, from lakes far back into. 
historic mountains, more remote and mysterious than were once 
the sources of the Nile. The history of education is one long 
stream of continuous, inexhaustible flow from such high springs: 
of science as the schools of Thebes, Memphis, Alexandria, the 
Greco-Roman world, and from such fountain heads of learn- 
ing as the Benedictine monasteries, the Cathedral schools, col- 
leges, and universities of medieval Europe. 
  “Tt will be disastrous for American democracy and for Amer- 
ican educators when they begin to level their high schools and 
higher education in the interest of what may be thought more 
popular and practical for the passing moment. To level the 
higher education in our towns and States in the alleged interest 
of the people would be as dangerous as for the General Goy- 
ernment to level the great light-houses along our coast and 
suffer our ships to depend upon the friendly rays that shine out 
from the lowly cottages of men along the shore. 
“This country needs to-day all the light which scholars can 
afford. While every State should be full of school-houses as it
-P-A-G-E-296
  2 0G5 
is of villages and hamlets, and as rich in local colleges and clas- 
_ sical academies as circumstances may require, there will always 
"be need of a few men and a few institutions in a ‘high state of 
science.’ Universities are the light-houses of popular educa- 
tion. They show all educators on what course to steer. All 
knowledge, like all science, ‘moves but slowly, slowly, creeping 
on from point to point.’ ”’* 
A Srare Unrversity a Necessity. 
No people can prosper who do not support institutions of 
higher education. If the people of Tennessee are to keep pace 
with the people of her neighboring Commonwealths, and to ac- 
complish the high destiny which Nature appears to have 
promised they might attain, they must have a great University. 
A State whose chief interests are “ agriculture’? and “ com- 
merce” should be a faithful patron of the arts and sciences, as 
taught in schools of technology. 
  Our State has fallen far behind her sister States in the last 
twenty-five years in the work of higher education. It is doing 
less for higher education to-day than any State of its wealth 
and population in this country. Virginia supports her great 
University, which is the pride of all her citizens, besides her 
Military Institute, her Agricultural College, and her two Nor- 
mal Colleges; North Carolina has her University and her Col- 
lege of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts; South Carolina has 
recently given liberally to her University and Military Acad- 
emy; Georgia has just established an Institute of Technology 
at a cost of several hundred thousand dollars, besides support- 
: ing her University and Agricultural Colleges ; Alabama has 
given as much to her Institute of Technology and Agricultural 
College at Auburn, and maintains a separate University ; Mis- 
sissippi supports a University, an Agricultural College, and an 
Industrial School for young women, by liberal annual appro- 
priations, and so on all around us. Meanwhile Tennessee has 
  
* Dr. H. B. Adams in Thomas Jefferson and the University of Virginia. 
 
-P-A-G-E-297
— 296 — 
not given her University a dollar in appropriations during the 
eighty years of its existence. Besides a small appropriation to 
the Peabody Normal College, the State is doing nothing at all 
for higher education. The question is: 
Can Tennessee afford, in any sense, to live longer without a 
great university? : 
The fact that philanthropic men have endowed institutions 
within her borders does not excuse the State of Tennessee from 
doing her duty. We may accord to private beneficence the 
warmest praise, but it surely does not become a great State to 
depend on charity wholly for the education of her sons and the 
development of her industries. In the language of Mr. Ever- 
ett: “This dependence on single and private bequests of rich 
individuals is a relic of a state of society which never existed 
among us, and to which we have nothing else corresponding. 
In Catholic ages, when men thought their peace with Heaven 
could be made, at dying, for lives spent in violation of all its 
laws, by founding or endowing public institutions for religion 
‘and literature, there was not so much need of the interference 
of the State for the erection of these establishments. Enlight- 
ening, instructing, and elevating the nation is the most sacred 
of public duties.”* What patriotic citizen will not feel a deep 
sense of shame when he sees his State doing nothing for the 
education of its sons, but relying upon private institutions en- 
tirely for their training ? 
Present NegEps. 
It would be almost impossible to make a list here of all the 
present needs of the University. It needs almost every thing 
in the way of buildings and equipment. As explained above, 
it has never had any means with which to provide these things, 
and was not allowed to use any of its income for such purposes. 
The University needs a building, or buildings, for general

  academic purposes, a chapel or assembly hall, lecture rooms, 
society halls, library, ete. It needs an armory building and 
gymnasium. It needs a good system of séwerage and sanitary 
arrangements. If the dormitory system is to be continued, it 
needs more and better dormitories, etc. 
Some of the most urgent needs of the University, some im- 
provements which are absolutely necessary at this time, to put 
the institution in position to do respectable work, are: 
1. A chemical laboratory. Twenty-five thousand dollars 
would be required to build and equip the proper kind of a 
laboratory. 
2. Ten thousand dollars to complete the equipment of the 
Mechanical Department, which has been erected and partially 
furnished at considerable sacrifice on the part of the Board and 
kind friends of the University. 
3. For suitable farm buildings, barns, stables, dairy, quarters 
for agricultural students, etc., eight thousand dollars would be 
required. This is the least amount that would furnish the 
farm with respectable buildings. 
4. Funds should be provided to build and equip a separate 
physical laboratory, and an appropriation should be made for 
the support of a chair of Physics. 
5. Provision should be made for a separate chair of Pure 
Mathematics. 
6. An appropriation of fifty thousand dollars a year for two 
years should be made to begin the erection of permanent aca- 
demic buildings such as would be worthy of the State. 
Respectfully submitted,

President.

REPORT OF THE DEAN. 
Only such information as is not contained in the reports of 
individual professors will be given here. 
Conpirions For ADMISSION. 
For. admission to the Freshman Class a student must have a 
good working knowledge of English grammar and composition, 
arithmetic, algebra to quadratic equations, and the first four 
books of geometry. In Latin he must be familiar with the 
forms and inflections, and have read the reader and three books 
of Cresar, or equivalent. For the accommodation of those who 
could not meet these requirements Sub-Freshman Classes were 
organized. It is proposed to admit to these such students only 
as give evidence of their ability to enter the Freshman Class 
after one year’s work. Although this standard for admission to 
the University is low enough, a number of candidates had to be 
rejected on account of their inability to meet them. The stand- 
ard should be raised as soon and as fast as the conditions will 
admit. The University ought not to be expected to do the 
work of a preparatory school. 
Courses or Srupy. 
In the arrangement of courses of study it was desired to 
combine, as far as possible, the advantages of the two systems 
known as the Curriculum and the Elective. It is clear that 
students, especially the more mature, should have some option 
in their studies and some reference, more or less direct, to their 
_ probable avocations. It is equally clear that, left entirely to 
themselves, they are unable and frequently unwilling to choose 
those studies which they ought to pursue. Having selected one 
principal subject, such studies as are cognate to it and necessary 
(298) 
 
-P-A-G-E-300

  for its successful prosecution ought to be selected for them. 
With this in view, seven courses of study have been arranged. 
The student may select his course, but he must then confine 
himself to the studies laid down for that course. Some of these 
are the same in the lower classes, diverging at different stages 
of advancement. No students are reported for two of them 
because, while they are preparing for them, there are none now 
sufficiently advanced to take the distinctive work. 
  Of the two hundred and one matriculates, seventy-four are 
inthe Literary Scientific Course, seventy in the Latin Scientific, 
twenty-seven in the Civil Engineering, ten in the Mechanical 
Engineering, ten in the Agricultural, and ten unclassified. It 
must be borne in mind that the Chemical Course and those of 
Mechanical Engineering are new, and the students now prepar- 
ing for these, as well as for the Agricultural, furnish good 
grounds for believing that these technical schools are meeting 
and will meet with a success which will compare very favorably 
with other similar institutions. 
SpeciaL Srupents. 
Tn order to still further liberalize and extend the work it is 
proposed that young men of suitable age and advancement 
shall be received as special students in any of the departments. 
They will be afforded all facilities for the prosecution of any 
line of work under the guidance and direction of the professor 
‘in charge. In order that they may be untrammeled in their 
investigations they will be released from military duty and sub- 
ject only to such general requirements in the way of discipline 
and deportment as are necessary to the protection of the Uni- 
versity. But to prevent conflict of embarrassment in our regu- 
lar discipline such student will not room or board on the — 
grounds, and they must be at least twenty-one years of age, 
and give to the faculty satisfactory evidence of their ability and 
willingness to profit by the privileges granted.

  ~ REPORT OF KENNETH G. MATHESON, 
CAPTAIN AND COMMANDANT OF CADETS. 
Dr. Charles W. Dabney, Jr., President: 
Str—I have the honor to submit the following report as 
Commandant of Cadets. In accordance with the election held 
by the Board of Trustees in August last, I reported to you for 
duty, as Commandant of Cadets, on August 16, 1888. 
ORGANIZATION. 
All students in the Academic Department, Agricultural and 
Mechanical College, not physically disabled, are subject to 
military duty. During the present term one such student was 
exempted from said duty. The students have been organized 
into a battalion of infantry consisting of four companies, each 
company being officered with one Captain, one First and one 
Second Lieutenant, and necessary non-commissioned officers. 
In addition, a full staff is attached to the battalion, all offi- 
cers being selected from those students most exemplary in con- 
duct, studies, and military bearing. 
Pracricat Instruction. 
Practical military instruction consists, at present, of company 
drills of one hour’s duration on four afternoons in the week, fol- 
lowed by undress parade every afternoon. On Friday after- 
noon the weekly inspection of arms is held, followed by dress 
parade. 
Company drill will be followed by battalion and skirmish 
drills, and target practice; and, if practicable, by a short session 
of artillery drills also. 
(302)
-P-A-G-E-304
— 303 — 
   The students have entered heartily into this practical work 
of the department, and have made remarkably fine progress 
since the opening of the session. 
While not interfering in the slightest with their academic 
pursuits, the healthful exercise incident to drills develops the 
students physicially, and at the same time renders them pro- 
ficient in a useful and popular branch of instruction, which 
cannot fail to reflect credit upon themselves and the Institution. 
Banp. 
Sixteen students have organized a brass band among them- 
selves. The band is required to practice during each drill hour, 
and is making fine progress. Besides heightening musical cul- 
ture among the young men themselves, it adds greatly to the 
effect of dress parades, inspections, etc., and has an animating 
effect upon the corps generally. 
ARMS. 
The Cadet Quartermaster cares for the arms, and is respon- 
sible for their return in good condition. He is assisted, ma- 
terially, by the Cadet Quartermaster Sergeant. As before 
stated, weekly inspections are held, and the arms are kept in 
the best possible condition. The arms now consist of— 
119 cadet rifles and accoutrements, new pattern (State). 
160 cadet rifles and accoutrements, old and suitable patterns 
(State). 
80 rifles unfit for use (State). 
12 U.S. A. regulation swords in poor condition eae 
2 brass field pieces unfit for use. 
The University has just received from the War Department 
a complete equipment consisting of two field pieces of artillery 
with a full set of accompanying implements, 150 Springfield 
cadet rifles, with accoutrements, ammunition, etc.
-P-A-G-E-305
— 804 — 
Untrorms. 
A dress uniform of the United States Military Academy 
(West Point) pattern was introduced at the opening of the fall 
term, and adds much to the appearance of the battalion. Slight 
changes, also, were made in the fatigue uniform. The uniforms 
are very neat, and combine the desirable qualities of being both 
serviceable and cheap. 
Barracks. 
During the past summer extensive and much needed repairs 
were made in the dormitories, and since that time each 
student has been charged with any damage he may have 
caused to publie property. The Commandant attends to this 
in person, inspecting at regular times during the week, and 
regularly on Saturday mornings. 
There are at present 127 students quartered in the dormito- 
ries. One or more instructors live in each dormitory building 
with the students. From two to three students occupy one 
room. It was formerly the custom here to put three or four 
inaroom. Experience has demonstrated that, for health, and 
in order to attain the best results from study, not more than 
two students should be allowed in one room. If this system 
is to be continued the University will soon need more dormi- 
tory space. In the absence of proper academic buildings, a 
large number of domitory rooms are now used for lecture 
rooms. The erection of a suitable building for lecture rooms 
would meet this demand in part, though the dormitory build- 
ings are old and poorly arranged, so that. complete new build- 
ings are very much needed. Greatly increased dormitory room 
is urgently needed, and unless provision is promptly made 
many applicants for the opportunities offered by the Uni- 
yersity will necessarily be turned from its doors. 
FurnNITURE, 
The furniture is of prescribed pattern, and while serviceable, 
is of sufficiently moderate price to place it within the reach of
-P-A-G-E-306
    PO a a Ce i >S Sy. wi Es i ~ ne 
— 805 — 
-'l students rooming together, unite to pay the expense of ar- 
-es of furniture in general use, and in this way lessen the 
outlay considerably. 
DIscrpLine. 
The military discipline of the University, while not severe, 
is firm, and permeates every department. Entirely uniform in 
character, it treats all students alike, and has been found a 
most effective method for obtaining the best results in the gen- 
eral and academic, as well as military, duties. Besides con- 
ducing to the above ends, it has the effect of making the young 
man punctual, orderly, and neat in his habits, obedient to law 
and proper authority, self-reliant and manly, and of elevating 
his moral tone—points which are being strongly demonstrated 
by the formative results noticeable in this corps. 
Asa means of correcting habits of carelessness and neglect 
of duty, so common among young men, the system of military 
discipline has no superior, and in thus fitting the student for 
the successful discharge of the duties of a business life, its im- 
portance cannot be overestimated. 
The discipline of the University is good, and is steadily in- 
creasing in effectiveness. As a result, we have had during the 
past term almost nothing to complain of in the conduct and 
order that has prevailed. 
ATTENDANCE. — 
The enrollment of students in the Academic Department 
subject to military discipline for the present term has been two 
hundred and twenty-six, a considerable increase over last ses- 
sion’s entire enrollment, which, in turn, was greater than that 
of several preceding years. 
In conclusion, allow me to say that indications point to a 
very successful session in this department. The cadet officers, 
generally, are quite zealous and efficient in the discharge of 
their respective duties; the students, as a rule, manifest a high 
20—s. s. P. 1
-P-A-G-E-307
  — 306 — 
  regard for law, and with such promises it is hardly possible f 
good results can fail to follow. 
Expressing to you my keen appreciation of the courtesy 
and assistance which you have ever tendered me in the dis- 
charge of my duties, and which have proven valuable in good 
results. 
I am very respectfully, your obedient servant, 
Kenyetu G. Maruuson, 
Captain and Commandant of Cadets.

REPORT OF THE LIBRARIAN. 
Dr. Charles W. Dabney, Jr., President of the University of Ten- 
nessee : 
Dear Str—I herewith transmit you a brief account of the 
condition of the library of the University of Tennessee. 
On taking charge of the library in July, 1888, [immediately be- 
gan arranging the books therein on the well-known Dewey Dec- 
imal Classification System. This system originated with Prof. 
Melvin Dewey, of Columbia College, New York, and has been in 
most successful operation since 1875 in some of the leading col- 
lege libraries of the country, and at the. present time is reyarded 
as the most comprehensive and satisfactory method of manag- 
ing libraries. All books are divided into ten grand divisions, 
viz.: general literature, philosophy, religion, sociology, natural 
science, useful arts, fine arts, literature, and history. The 
books in each class are numbered at intervals of 100, so that, 
for example, natural science is numbered from 500 to 599, and 
following this the useful arts extend from 600 to 699. Hach 
division is further divided and subdivided into classes and sec- 
tions, so that each book can be placed on the shelf among the 
books of its class and section. Each book has numbered on its 
back the division, class, and section number, combined into one, 
and beneath this the number of this book in said class. This 
system is giving us much satisfaction. All students desiring 
books are obliged to fill out a slip, which is placed in a pocket, 
and upon the return of said book this slip is filed away. The 
system provides for the record of the book, so that at the end 
of the college term or year the librarian has a complete record 
of all the books drawn from the library, with precise informa- 
tion concerning the character of books read by each student. 
All of the books in the library are recorded in our accession 
(307)
-P-A-G-E-309
— 308 — 
book and card catalogue, excepting about 100 volumes at the — 
book-binders, and 1,000 government periodicals. The present _ 
number, fully catalogued, is 8,596. Within a month this num- 
ber will be increased to 4,500. This does not include the 2,000 | 
volumes in the library of the Agricultural Department, in a 
separate building. The library possesses quite a number of 
valuable magazines, that should be bound, so as to be accessible 
to students. The general condition of the books is most satis- 
factory, and they represent only the cleanest sort of literature, 
and the most advanced scientific thought. 
The reading room is well supplied with leading current mag- 
azines and papers. Our subscription list includes thirty-nine 
of these ; in addition many are presented by the publishers. 
Very truly yours, 
C. S. Piums, 
Librarian.

PEPORTS FROM SCHOOLS. 
I.—_SCHOOL OF ANCIENT LANGUAGES. 
To the President of the University of Tennessee: 
T have the honor to submit to you the following report of 
this department, of which I took charge September 1, 1888: 
Latin. 
The following table will show the number of students who 
haye entered upon this work, and the classes and sections into , 
which they have been divided: 
Class. No. of Students. No. of Sections. 
Sub-Freshman, 42 2 
Freshman, 17 1 
Sophomore, 9 1 
Junior, a £ 
Total, 69 5 
The only important change in the organization has been to 
require the study of Latin through the junior year for gradua- 
tion in the Latin Scientific Course. Less than that I did not 
think would justify the University in bestowing its diploma. 
Only one student has been found prepared to enter upon that 
work. Butit is already certain that there will be a good class 
for it next year, and that the numbers in the other classes will 
be considerably increased. Such increase will absolutely re- 
quire a larger lecture room and equipment. : 
The large majority of the cadets have entered upon this work 
with enthusiasm, and are making gratifying progress. We 
have to contend with the fact that there are almost no prepara- 
tory schools in our territory that will properly train young men 
(309)
-P-A-G-E-311
— 310 — 
for our Freshman Class. Until that is done the University can- 
not meet the wishes of its patrons without continuing the Sub- 
Freshman work in Latin. 
The plan of work has been fully outlined in the announce- 
ment for 1888-9 and need not be repeated here. It is sufficient 
to say that great emphasis will be laid upon the writing of En- 
glish into Latin throughout the course so as to secure a thor- 
ough understanding of its syntax not only for its own sake, 
but as a basis for the study and use of language in general. Itis 
not only an important, but an essential contributor to the results 
aimed at in the departments of English and modern languages, 
but scarcely any would deny that no high stand in technical 
instruction can be taken without it. 
GREEK. 
I regret to say that while the desire and demand for Latin 
seems to be increasing that for Greek seems to be declining. 
Perhaps that was to be expected in a school organized more 
specially for technical instruction. Only seven students asked 
for the study, and these of different degrees of advancement. 
They have been accommodated this year. Without yielding 
my personal opinions or judgment on the question, I suggest 
that the wishes of the people will be more nearly met by dis- 
continuing the Greek and putting the whole force of the de- 
partment on Latin. 
Psycnonoey. 
This class was put under my charge for the current year. 
Five of the young men, mostly members of the Senior Class, 
reported for it. They have just completed Hopkins’ “Outline 
Study of Man.” This will be followed by Psychology proper 
(four months) and Logic (three months). In this hurried way 
it will be my object to introduce these young men to the 
highest field of human investigation, and to interest them in 
those questions which bear so constantly upon life and char- 
acter. Respectfully submitted, 
T. W. Jorpan.

II._SCHOOL OF ENGLISH AND MODERN LANGUAGES. 
1. Eneuisu. 
The study of English has not always met with its deserved 
encouragement, and even now there are many who attach more 
importance to ancient languages and deem the acquisition of a 
modern foreign tongue a greater good. But of late the unmis- 
takable tendency is to encourage English as not only a lan- 
guage of paramount practical importance, but as a means of 
mental discipline fully equal at least to other languages. Little 
need be said of the practical value of the study of English. 
The extent of the language, its rapid growth, and the power of 
the nations who speak it, render it a matter of incalculable 
value to know English. But to know a language is to be able 
to use it correctly, readily, and intelligently. Now to correct 
usage training in orthography, orthoepy, reading, and grammar 
are essential. Only constant exercise in composition and speak- 
ing can give that coveted readiness, without which. correct 
usage will always be hampered. Intelligent use of one’s mother 
tongue implies a true apprehension of its possibilities, powers, 
and means. Every evidence in literature of its power is a 
revelation of its possibility, and every realization of its possi- 
bilities is an exhibition of its most powerful means. Every 
monument of literature is a memorial stone of progress and a 
summons to emulation of its author. 
Furthermore, it is admitted by all scholars that the most 
earnest, active, and successful work in Old English is. being 
done in Germany first and America next. There has been a 
decided impetus given to this study in recent years and by liv- 
ing scholars, and no university, if it value its own standing, can 
fail to provide means for thorough study of the origin and 
growth of our language. But is it only a fashion that now 
sustains and encourages the study of English philologically ? 
By no means; it is of the greatest practical value as giving 
that thorough mastery which can only come from a compre- 
hensive grasp of the language as a whole, and it is essentially
-P-A-G-E-313
— 312 — 
disciplinary. This last fact has been frequently denied, tacitly 
if not openly. Let us see. German is usually looked upon as 
the most valuable modern language for training the mind, be- 
cause it has best preserved the marks of a synthetic language 
once common to the Teutonic tongue. Further, we often hear 
it urged that German, with its varied forms, its clear rules of 
argument, generally applied, requires strict attention, accurate 
analysis, painstaking effort, and nice discrimination; that in 
these respects it is equal to Latin or Greek as mental training. 
Now, it must be recognized that Old English, a strictly syn- 
thetic language, is, in these regards, in nowise inferior to the 
German. The study of ancient or modern language in our col- 
leges is usually materially crippled in its disciplinary effects by 
the fact that it begins with forms, of which the origin, and in 
the case of ancient languages investigates these forms or the 
literature only for a limited period. Approaching the study of 
Old English from a fair knowledge of modern English one not 
only has all the benefits of this excellent drill, but is led at once 
to the origin of the forms and the explanation of the facts that 
meet his eye every day. Beginning, then, with Old English, or 
better still, with Gothic, the investigation of the changes these 
words undergo in getting from these forms to their present has 
all the fascination of historical research, much of the discipline 
of philosophical examination, and the practical importance of 
wielding the full force of our modern tongue. In the study of 
English so as to get a complete view of its origin, structure, 
and gradual development, keen attention, accurate investiga- 
tion, philosophical research, historical examination, sound judg- 
ment, enlightened reflection, and reasonable imagination must 
be involved ; while a thorough knowledge of our tongue cannot 
be effected without an exploration of all the tributaries of in- 
fluence, be they Celtic, Scandinavian, French, Latin, or what 
not, that pour into the stream of our English tongue, once a 
small, insular brooklet, now a continental river of majestic 
sweep. 
This University has mapped out the following work, which 
will be added to and expanded as rapidly as wisdom dictates: 
In the Freshman Class Composition and Rhetoric. The 
 
-P-A-G-E-314
    — 313 — 
Sophomore devotes itself more particularly to the History of 
Literature. In the Junior the time is first given to the History 
of the Languages, then to an introduction to Old and Middle 
English, after which the History of English forms is studied 
more in detail. Later the class is occupied with advanced 
work in Rhetoric, and special periods of English Literature. 
The Senior Class continues the study of special periods, - 
giving particular attention to Chaucer and Shakespeare inter- 
pretation. This class also makes original investigations as 
bases for reports, essays, etc. ‘ 
At no time during the course is exercise in writing omitted, 
and the further advanced the student the more important is it 
considered that this work should be based upon his own inde- 
pendent research. At present there are ninety-three Fresh- 
men, eighteen Sophomores, and twelve Juniors. 
This session, owing to a redistribution of work, there is no 
Senior Class in English, but the next session will witness not 
only the introduction of Senior work, but the inauguration as 
well of special work in Old and Middle English. To prose- 
cute this latter work better library facilities are much needed, 
while a seminary room, where this class can meet for discus- 
sion and to examine periodicals, will soon be a necessity. 
Moreover, it must be added that the present lecture room of 
the professor will be too small to contain his classes of next 
session, and there is no other lecture room on the grounds 
available. 
2. Mopern Laneuaaes. 
It is an unsatisfactory makeshift to class two languages as 
divergent as French and German under one broad head, and 
limit that genus to these two individual species. 
The only scientific diversion that can meet with the recog- 
nition of scholars is that of Teutonic and Romance Languages.

Besides English, the only Teutonic language to which any 
special attention has as yet been paid is New High ‘German, 
though it is contemplated particularly in special and post 
graduate work, to take up the study of other branches of the 
Teutonic languages, and more particularly other periods of 
German. 
In the class work the aim is primarily to drill in the forms, 
both orally and in writing, make preparation by reading for an 
intelligent introduction to the master pieces of German litera- 
ture, and spend some time on an exposition of these. To reap 
the practical value of a modern language, practice in speaking 
cannot be omitted, and while the difficulty of learning to speak 
a language by a few hours weekly practice is clearly recognized, 
the benefit to be desired from even this limited practice is not 
underrated, 
In the Romance Languages, the regular courses require only 
Latin and French, though special work may be done in Italian 
as well. The general plan of work in French is the same as in 
German, except that the relation of Latin and French should be 
kept constantly in view. Special work in this department will 
involve the study of Old English, and the comparison of Ro- 
mance tongues.

III.—HISTORY, LITERATURE, AND POLITICAL ECONOMY. 
Dr C. W. Dabney, Jr., President of the University of Tennessee : 
Dear Sir—I have the honor to make the following report of 
my work in the University this year: 
During the present term I have been teaching five classes. 
For class in Composition and my two classes in Rhetoric, I refer 
you to the report of Dr. C. W. Kent, Professor of English and 
Modern Languages. All I would myself say is, that the sec- 
tions in Rhetoric are too large. Some new arrangment is much
-P-A-G-E-316

needed, or some provision should be made for increase of the 
teaching force in English studies. 
Enenisn Itsvrory. 
Eighteen young men of the Sophomore class have been en- 
gaged in the study of English History. They first took a gen- 
eral course, reaching from the earliest period to the present. 
At no time were they taught to commit the words of the text 
or to do any routine work. The leading facts and principles 
were impressed. Details were used only to fix what was more 
important. Dates and location received due attention. How, 
when, and where, was the working motto. Such dates as only 
from the great landmarks of history were demanded. Fre- 
quent reviews fixed the essential facts. Ideas were always 
taught rather than mere verbal forms; and customs, manners, 
and the progress of the people in civilization, rather than 
routine of wars and intrigues of kings. 
The class is now making a special study of particular 
periods. This is the seminary plan followed so successfully in 
Harvard, Cornell, and other leading institutions, The methods 
resemble laboratory work in chemistry. The members of the 
class go to the University library for all the works on English 
History that can be obtained. I also bring to the lecture room 
my own private library. With these materials, a portion of 
the recitation hour is devoted to critical research, each student 
working independently. Sometimes the whole hour is given 
up to this work. Again, a portion or all of the recitation hour 
will be devoted to lectures by the students, in which they com- 
municate to the class, in the form of discourse, the results of 
their research. Some write out their addresses, others speak 
from notes, and a few speak without any guide whatever. The 
young men take the greatest interest in these exercises. In 
addition to the acquisition of historical knowledge, the ability 
to collect and deliver thought is in this way greatly improved. 
Through the study of English History students are pointed to 
the origin of our own social and governmental institutions. 
It completes a ground work for the study, next year, of
-P-A-G-E-317
      — 316 — 
_ English and American Constitutional History. During the 
_ rest of the present year the class will study English Literature. 
PotrricanL Economy. 
Political economy has been completed by a class of eight. 
This is a senior study. No subject is more important in this 
day of rapid sociologic development. The labor question, co- 
operation, national debt, protection, free trade, socialism, and 
other questions which now agitate the country were thoroughly 
studied in the light of latest development. The instruction 
was directed toward preparing the young men to grapple suc- 
cessfully with their difficult problems when they go out into 
practical life. During the rest of the year the class will study ~ 
the history of civilization and the American Constitution. 
This department needs a set of well mounted maps; also a 
good working library, suitable for original research and parallel 
reading in connection with the subjects taught. 
Respectfully submitted, 
T. C. Karns, 
Associated Professor of English, ete.

New classes will be organized after the intermediate exam- 
ination, and new subjects will be taken up by most of the 
classes named above. 
The two classes in Mechanics, that in Civil Engineering and 
the class in Junior Mathematics, are taught by the Professor. 
The class in Descriptive Geometry, that in Sophomore Mathe- 
matics, and one of the sections of the class in Freshman Math- 
ematics are taught by Passed Assistant Engineer T. F. Burg- 
dorff, of the United States Navy, who has been detailed to act 
as Associate Professor of Mathematics and Engineering. Two 
sections of the class in Freshman Mathematics are taught, as 
the class shortly to commence Land Surveying will be, by First 
Lieutenant E. E. Gayle, of the United States Army, who has 
been detailed primarily to give instruction in military tactics. 
One section of the class in Sub-Freshman Mathematics is 
taught by the Commandant, Capt. K. G. Matheson, and the 
other two sections by Instructor W. R. Ellington. 
The department stands in great need of a testing machine 
for determining the strength of the different materials of con- 
struction—of plates, working drawings, and models of engineer- 
ing structures arid appliances, and of specimens of building 
materials. The testing machine would cost about $1,000, and 
an equal amount would procure a reasonable supply of the 
specimens, drawings, ete. Great inconvenience now results 
from the lack of a drawing hall, and of a sufficient number of 
recitation rooms and rooms for the engineering instruments. 
A new building would be required to supply these wants and 
to furnish suitable quarters for the machine specimens, etc., re- 
ferred to above. Very respectfully, 
‘Wo. W. Carson.

V.—REPORT OF THE SCHOOL OF INDUSTRIAL MECHANICS. 
Our first report of the equipment, work, aims, and purposes 
of the department of Industrial Mechanics is respectfully sub- 
mitted. 
EQuipMENT. 
The equipment of the newly inaugurated Mechanical School 
at this date comprises a plain, substantial, three-story brick 
building, thirty-eight feet by eighty feet outside, with a one- 
story thirty feet by thirty feet annex, and a sixteen feet by 
eleven feet tower at one corner, all well lighted, and having an

excellent system of steam heating throughout. The building 
was ready for occupancy in the latter part of September, 1888, 
and most of the machinery, etc., ordered to date is in place, 
while important additions to the plant are now being made.
-P-A-G-E-320
  — 319 — 
In the basement story, at one end, is the metal-working ma- 
chine shop, thirty-six feet by forty-three feet. Around the 
outer edge, on three sides, are vises and benches for the opera- 
tors of chipping, filing, scraping, fitting, ete. In one corner of 
this room is a very fine six inch by twelve inch “Straight Line 
Engine,” driving the main lines of shafting in the metal-work- 
ing and wood-working shops. This engine is also to be fitted 
up with a dynamometer for experimental work. There are now 
in place a twenty-four inch by twenty-four inch by sixty inch 
planing machine, a twenty-five inch upright drill, and an eight- 
een inch emery tool-grinding machine, all of the highest class 
of their kind; while two lathes, a shaping machine, a universal 
milling machine for plain and spiral gear cutting, etc., will be 
added before the close of the present school year. 
At the other end of the basement story is the wood-working 
machine shop, thirty-five feet by thirty-six feet, containing 
fifteen twelve-inch wood-turning lathes, two iron frame saw 
benches, a twelve-inch hand planer and jointer, a jig-saw, and 
benches with wood vises. 
In the basement story are washing lavatories and clothes 
closets. In the thirty feet by thirty feet annex are six forges, 
with anvils, hammers, dies, ete., for working heated metal, tool- 
dressing and tempering. A power pressure blower supplies air 
to the forges, and an ample exhaust power blower conveys the 
smoke from the forge funnels to a chimney. 
In the annex is also a forty-two-inch by twelve-foot return 
tubular steel boiler, double rivited, amply strong for a working 
steam pressure of two hundred pounds per square inch. The 
boiler setting is to be supplied with a forced draught for burning 
bituminous slack, somewhat similar to that used in the anthra- 
cite districts of Pennsylvania for burning culm. This arrange- 
ment furnishes steam for power and heating eros at a 
merely nominal cost. 
The arrangement of the heating apparatus is such that either 
live steam direct from the boiler, or the exhaust steam from the
-P-A-G-E-321
— 320 — 
   engine may be used for heating the building. It may be of in- — 
terest to note that the engine does not require enough steam to 
heat the building. : 
On the second floor, at one end, is the hand wood-working 
shop, thirty-five feet by thirty-six feet, supplied with twenty- 
four vises and benches, each bench being equipped with three 
planes of the best make, saws, chisels, squares, ete. The vises 
are so arranged as to admit the easy and proper use of that im- 
portant tool, the drawing knife, a feature not common to other 
manual training schools. This feature is considered of great 
importance, as it is not our purpose to confine ourselves solely 
to exercises peculiar to the cabinet-maker. 
At the other end of the second floor is a drawing room 
thirty-six feet by forty-three feet, where free-hand drawing 
and sketching, drawing from models, shades and shadows, and 
perspective are taught. The equipment for this room is nicely 
started, and is being rapidly added to. 
On the upper floor is a draughting room for more advanced 
work, thirty-six feet by forty-one feet, well lighted at the sides 
and by sky-lights. Here the student receives instruction in the 
various branches of mechanical drawing, beginning with pro- 
jections, and passing step by step to finished working draw- 
ings. 
Connected with this draughting room is a blue print room, 
fourteen feet by sixteen feet, where students become expert in 
taking copies of tracings by the “blue process,” and also in 
preparing the sensitised paper for the heliographic (blue print) 
process. 
On the upper floor is also a lecture room, twenty feet by 
thirty-seven feet, and a room sixteen feet by twenty-three feet, 
at present occupied as a physical laboratory. 
On each of the three floors are oftices in the tower, fourteen 
feet by fourteen feet.

  Metruops anp AImMs. 
It has often been repeated by those in charge of mechanical 
schools that they do not aim to turn out expert machinists, — 
blacksmiths, or carpenters. To those who, by experience, are 
familiar with the years of patient toil necessary to become an 
expert in any thing, this statement is unnecessary. But it is 
repeated here in order that the facilities we offer for instruction 
in wood and metal working, in drawing and machine designs, 
may be interpreted correctly. It must be distinctly borne in 
mind by those intending to avail themselves of the advantages 
of a technical school of this nature that the object of the man-_ 
ual labor in the workshops and drawing rooms is to give a 
course of systematic instruction and training which it would 
be impossible to obtain in the best managed commercial work- 
shops or engineering office. In the engineering school every 
process is based on the idea of imparting instruction, while in 
the manufacturing establishment the object is to turn out the 
largest product of work at a minimum cost. To this latter end 
a workman is kept for years, perhaps all his life, performing 
over and over a single operation, in which he may become very 
expert, to the entire exclusion of knowledge in some other 
equally important allied branch of work. 
In general, however, the work in the training school is in- 
tended only to precede the more important work of the trade 
workshops or the expert’s office, for it is believed that only in 
the latter can the student properly gain a knowledge of the 
commercial conditions under which the financial practicability 
of his work will be tested. 
Thus it may be seen that while we shall not aim to perform 
merely mechanical tasks and exercises of the so-called manual 
training school, neither shall we, at present, attempt to enter 
into competition with commercial workshops by turning out 
manufactured articles for the trade. Our purpose will be to at- 
tain a compromise of these extremes, for, on the one hand, it 
stands to reason that a student will feel more zeal, will take 
more interest in his work, if he is aware that the piece upon 
21—s. f   
tage:  
-P-A-G-E-323
  — 322 — 
which he is working is to form a part of some useful, actual 
machine, than if it were a merely mechanical task. And on 
the other hand, in order that any profit might be derived com- 
mercially from a student’s work, the scope or range of manipu- 
lation and processes must be extremely limited, which would, 
in our opinion, be undesirable. 
Then, too, the quality and kind of manual work which 
should be assigned a technical student depends as much upon 
his age and previous training as does the purely mental work. 
So long as it is the policy of the University to admit students 
_ at so young an age, and so deficient in rudimentary education, 
the work in the shops cannot differ so much from that of the 
regular manual training school as we could wish. 
It has been decided to adopt one feature of the manual train- 
ing schools, viz.: To require all students, during their first 
or freshman year, to pursue a thorough course of manual 
exercises in the wood-working shops, and also in free-hand 
drawing, no matter what regular course of study they may ulti- 
mately pursue. The ability to use asaw and plane properly, and 
with some skill, cannot fail to be of value to any man, no matter 
what his situation in life may be ultimately, and who passes a 
year or a month without being called upon to either make or 
interpret a free-hand sketch? The ability to do-so is fully as 
valuale to the farmer as to the machinist. 
The general policy which we hope to pursue being thus 
briefly outlined, it may be stated more in detail that students 
in Industrial Mechanics (Mechanical Engineering) will receive 
practical instruction in the several shops throughout their 
entire course (of four years) by manual labor therein. They 
will begin with a series of exercises in wood-working, the aim 
of which will be to give both familiarity with the proper use 
and skill in the handling of the tools in common use by ecar- 
penters, joiners, and pattern-makers. Such as attain to pro- 
ficiency in this branch will, for a short time, be engaged in 
making useful articles, as desks, tables, etc., and also in pattern 
and core box-making. - 
 
-P-A-G-E-324
    aigog tt 
From the carpenter shop they will next take up exercises in 
wood-turning, and also become familiar with the care and use 
of wood-working machinery, as saws, planes, mortising ma- 
chinery, etc. The time devoted to this department will enable © 
the diligent student to become quite expert in the use of the 
wood-turning lathe. 
The next shop work to be taken up will be exercises in the 
blacksmith shops, where the student will be afforded an oppor- 
tunity to become familiar with the various operations of working 
heated metal, as forging, welding, tool-dressing and tempering, 
the management of a blacksmith’s fire, etc. The instruction 
received in this department will not only enable the student to 
acquire considerable skill in the blacksmith’s handicraft, but to 
more readily grasp the situation should he be introduced to 
operations of a more extended character in his subsequent 
career. 
Lastly, the student passes to the metal-working machine 
shop, where he passes through a system of graded exercises in 
chipping, filing, scraping, and fitting, and work on machine 
tools, and finally in the construction of useful articles. It is 
intended that the student shall devote more time to this depart- 
ment of shop work than to any of the others, as more practice 
and experience is needed in it in order to acquire skill. 
Practice in the various departments of drawing, like work in 
the shops, will extend over the entire course in industrial me- 
chanics. To become proficient as a draftsman requires not 
only practice of the right sort, but a great deal of it. Aside 
from some exercises in the abstract mechanism and the kine- 
matic relations of connected parts, the drawing will, for the 
most part, comprise a careful study of the latest and best prod- 
ucts in actual structures, machine designs, ete. Too much im- 
portance cannot be laid on the fact that the best place to acquire 
a knowledge of shop methods is in the careful study of the 
best examples of engineering work, as the leading types of 
steam engines used in driving dynamos, ice and refrigerating 
machinery, triple and quadruple expansion engines, the latest
-P-A-G-E-325
  — 324 — 
“types of locomotives, ete. It is intended to not only study 
such machinery as a whole, but from detail working drawings. 
By the time the student leaves the University it is hoped that he 
may be able to work out a design from sketches and specifica- 
tions. Much attention will also be given to laboratory and ex- 
perimental work in making accurate observations and the 
working up of results from experiment data. Excellent facili- 
ties will be afforded for making dynamic, calorimetric, and other 
experiments with steam, and in the near future it is hoped 
facilities may be offered for experimenting on the strength of 
materials. 
In the equipment of this department of the University no 
effort whatever has been made toward display. Every dollar 
at our disposal has been anxiously invested where it would do 
the most good. It is confidently asserted that at no other me- 
chanical college in this country can so much be shown on so 
small an investment. It is contidently believed that the ulti- 
mate standard by which we are to be judged by the public is, 
not how many fine buildings we have, nor how many students 
we may turn out, but by the capability and helpfulness of the 
students who graduate from the department. It is not our 
purpose or wish to try to give unruly, lazy boys a reformation 
discipline in manual tasks. Indeed, such will early be dis- 
couraged from pursuing the studies of this department. But 
our hope is to offer facilities where earnest, industrious young 
men, who feel that they must make their own future for them- 
selves, in advancing the various industries of the “‘New South,” 
can obtain a thorough and valuable preparation for their life 
work, At least $10,000 is needed at once to properly equip the 
present building with such tools and appliances as shall enable 
the greatest good to be derived from the money already in- 
vested. x 
Puysics. 
The course of instruction in Physics is given to those stu- 
dents whose courses of study require it, throughout the junior, 
or third year. The modern method of teaching Natural Phi- 
losophy is largely by experimental demonstration. The appa-
-P-A-G-E-326
  : SABO 5 ee 
ratus for such teaching, when taken charge of by the present 
instructor, was found to be in a terrible state of demoralization. 
Some very valuable instruments had been almost entirely ru- 
ined. This apparatus can only be repaired, and replaced where 
necessary, at considerable expense. 
While there are some very satisfactory pieces of apparatus 
for illustrating electrical phenomena, there is almost nothing 
for carrying out experiments in optics, acoustics, heat, and 
dynamics, and what little there is is nearly ruined by former 
neglect. Then, too, the expense of fitting up proper quarters 
in the new mechanical building for a physical laboratory and 
lecture room will be considerable. 
It is urgently recommended that the pressing needs of this 
department be recognized and provision made for additional 
equipment. This department of instruction is certainly of 
prime importance in the education of a farmer, a mechanic, or 
for any kind of professional life. And one of the most efficient 
means of acquiring a knowledge of the laws of nature is by ex- 
perimental work in the physical laboratory. There is no pro- 
vision whatever for such laboratory investigation at the present 
time, and not less than $1,000 should be immediately placed at 
the disposal of this department, and to which large additions 
should be made yearly. a

VI-REPORT FROM THE SCHOOL OF GENERAL AND ANA- 
LYTICAL CHEMISTRY AND METALLURGY. 
Dr. Charles W. Dabney, Jr., President University of Tennessee : 
Dear Sir—I present herewith for your consideration the fol- 
lowing facts concerning the School of Analytical Chemistry 
and Metallurgy in this University : 
Since the opening of the present session daily lectures in 
general chemistry have been delivered to the Sophomore Class. 
The same class has entered upon chemical practice in the lab-~
-P-A-G-E-327
  - — 826 — ees 
oratory, which work will suitably prepare them for systematic 
qualitative analysis, to be commenced the next term. . 
The Junior and Senior Classes are making fairly rapid and 
satisfactory progress in quantitative analysis; they are doing as 
well as could be expected under the circumstances. 
The Senior Class, after some preliminary instruction, has un- 
dertaken some very interesting and profitable work in the 
identification of minerals after the system of Von Kobell. 
In chemistry and metallurgy much work has been planned, 
which, however, cannot be carried out with the present facili- 
ties at hand. The present laboratory is dilapidated and too 
indifferent, as well as totally inadequate, to meet the require- 
ments of this or any other progressive University. 
A new and modern laboratory is an immediate and pressing 
need ; a properly constructed one with facilities for doing good 
work, with an assay and metallurgic laboratory properly 
equipped with modern appliances and reduction furnaces, will 
prove an incalculable benefit and honor to the University, as 
well as to the State at large. 
It seems strange, indeed, yet it is a deplorable fact, that this 
University is so very far behind in regard to its chemical equip- 
ment and its facilities for instruction in this important branch. 
It would seem that of all the colleges in the country those 
which have received aid from the National Government under 
the act of 1862 should, above all others, be provided with 
thoroughly equipped laboratories and lecture rooms for instruc- 
tion on chemistry, mineralogy, geology, the chemistry of man- 
ufacturing, assaying, metallurgy, etc., and also for prosecuting 
investigations designed to promote the success of the local in- 
dustries of the State. 
The necessity for this kind of work is apparent, for within 
the last month application has been made to this department 
of the University, by representative parties, to carry on a series
-P-A-G-E-328
BO iiee 
  of experiments with a view of determining the coking proper- 
ties of the coals found in this State. Under the existing condi- 
tions such experiments cannot be undertaken. 
In this University the importance of chemistry has certainly 
been overlooked and very much underestimated. If we look at 
our manufacturing industries it is difficult to point to one 
where chemical principles do not form the very essence itself 
of the industry, and where a proper understanding of these 
principles leads to greater success. 
We find it the underlying principle involved in the profita- 
ble extraction of all the metals from their ores, as iron, zine, 
lead, copper, gold, silver, ete. For the production of our 
modern steel we are indebted to this chemical art. In this 
same connection may be mentioned industries leading to the 
manufacture of glass, porcelain, paints, oils, cements, wines, 
beer, paper, also tanning, bleaching, calico printing, ete., and 
even the production of coke, as well as the utilization of 
the refuse coal or slack for the production of generator gases 
used in the puddling, reheating, and rolling of iron. Indeed, 
just here may be very profitably mentioned the coal tar colors, 
which have been produced by the most diligent and profound 
research, and it has been said that “no rule of thumb work, if 
carried on for centuries, would ever have given us artificial 
alizarine.” 
In order to promote Agricultural Science, at least from a 
chemical standpoint, the National Government has seen the 
wisdom in appropriating funds with which to erect a chemical 
laboratory in each of the several States which accepted the 
land-grant; it is fully believed by those conversant with the 
facts that the agriculturist would be very much thwarted in 
his experimentation should he be deprived of the services of 
his chemist. 
The manufacturer and the agriculturist alike owe their suc- 
cess directly or indirectly to these principles—without such 
knowledge, it has been asked, “ where would be not merely our
-P-A-G-E-329
— 328 — 
industry, our technology, but our whole modern civilization?” 
In our every-day walks of life we are everywhere surrounded 
by the triumphs of chemical art. 
It is our desire to make this work practically useful to the 
students of this University by having them prosecute courses 
of study and practical work, such as will prepare them for the 
work in the field, in the mine, at the furnace, or in the factory. 
It seems unreasonable to expect this State to remain behind 
in this very important matter. That we are behind to-day is a 
well established fact. To be convinced of this it is only nec- 
essary to look around us and see what our neighboring States 
are doing in this important work. We will find in Virginia, 
North Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Missouri, and other States 
new and elegant laboratories, only recently constructed for the 
benefit of their colleges and universities. 
This University, above all others, located in the midst 
of a mining region, rich in deposits of coal, iron, zine, 
marble, ete., deserves, from a technical and industrial stand- 
point, a modern laboratory equipped for doing the best possible 
work, and for keeping up with the live industries of the day. 
My experience in planning and in constructing the elegant 
laboratory at the Missouri School of Mines justifies me in the 
assertion that not less than twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,- 
000) should be expended in the construction of a new Chemi- 
eal and Metallurgical Laboratory for this University at the 
earliest possible day.

VII—SCHOOL OF AGRICULTURAL AND ORGANIC CHEMISTRY. 
The instruction in these subjects begins in the junior year in 
the several courses. Students must have had the course in 
general chemistry before they can take either of the subjects in 
this school. This session, the first one after the reorganiza- 
tion, no students were found prepared to take these courses. 
But they will be prepared to take these studies by September, 
1889, when the instruction will begin. The instruction in

begins in the (1) junior year. Lectures on agricultural chem- 
istry; chemistry of plants and plant products; relation of soil 
and air to plants; nutrition of plants, from the soil, from the 
air; inorganic ingredients, ash analysis; physics and plants, 
mechanism of nutrition and movement of sap; chemistry of the 
germination and development of plants, ete. 
Physics and chemistry of soils, their origin and classification ; 
movements of water in the soil, soil temperatures, chemical 
composition, relation to plant nutrition ; soil analysis, methods 
and signification of results; exhaustion of soils, maintenance

agents ; study of the properties of classes of compounds; special 
methods for analysis of organic substances and original re- 
search. 
This school needs specimens, models, and illustrative material 
very much.

VIII.-REPORT OF THE SCHOOL OF AGRICULTURE. 
Dr. Charles W. Dabney, Jr., President University of Tennessee: 
Dear Str—I below present for your consideration a report 
of the Agricultural Department of the University of Tennessee : 
Farm. 
The work of the farm has been conducted on a strictly busi- 
ness basis. Market garden crops have been grown, and sales of 
produce daily made in the Knoxville market. While the income 
from these sales has been considerable, the expenses of labor 
have also been very considerable. In view of the labor, ex- 
pense, and the low prices paid in this region for vegetables and 
fruits, I deem it wise that the farm gradually change from mar- 
ket gardening to stock growing and general farming, a field 
which yields, as I believe, the greatest profit. However, I 
should advise the testing of fruits and vegetables upon the 
farm, and have now on trial a large collection of varieties of 
small fruits, especially strawberries. While we are not grow- . 
ing wheat on a large scale, we have a number of acres planted 
to experimental plats, under different methods of cultivation ; 
_we have also some forty varieties of wheat in plats, their va- 
rious points of excellence being carefully studied. 
During the past year, and my connection with the farm, a
-P-A-G-E-332
  — 331 — 
number of experiments have been conducted of more or less 
interest. A series of plats have been grown to millet or Hun- 
garian grass, testing different fertilizers. Five plats of one 
acre each in size were grown to ensilage corn, the seed used 
being of different amounts. Twenty plats of one-twentieth of 
an acre in size each were planted to different varieties of 
grasses. Other experiments are in progress with field plants. 
With the cattle of the farm several experiments of impor- 
                  
  
        
  NEW AGRICULTURAL AND NATURAL HISTORY BUILDING, 
tance have been conducted the past year. Large numbers of 
cattle have been dehorned over the country during the past 
few years, but no experiments of importance have been con- 
ducted, to note the effect on the animals, until this institution 
took the matter in hand. During the winter of 1887-8, two 
sets of feeding experiments, on both milch cows and fattening 
steers, were conducted under the supervision of two agricultural 
students residing at the farm. 
At the present time we have forty head of cattle, of which
-P-A-G-E-333
— 332 — 
  twelve are registered in herd books, being either Jerseys or 
Holstein-Friesians. These are, as a rule, average animals, 
though we possess a few extra good specimens. The past sum- 
mer, through Messrs. Smiths, Powell & Lamb, of Syracuse, 
New York, I secured what I believe to be the best Holstein- 
Friesian bull in the South. This animal is being used to build 
up a herd of choice grade Holstein-Friesians, to serve as an 
example to the farmers of the State of what can be done in 
live stock breeding with a good sire. Mr. Lawson Valentine, 
of Houghton Farm, New York, has presented the farm with a 
young Jersey buil, a grandson of the famous Eurotas, which 
we shall place at the head of our Jersey herd in about a year. 
The milk from the cattle is at present either sold at retail or 
skimmed and butter made, for which we secure the highest 
price in the Knoxville market. This milk and butter is entirely 
cared for by an agricultural student, who, previous to coming 
to the University, had never made butter. 
On a stock farm it is always essential to grow roots, such as 
potatoes, turnips, carrots, ete. Until this fall the farm has never 
had a suitable place for storing such things. However, we now 
have a large root cellar, built of brick, located in the northeast 
side of a steep hill. The walls are double, and so arranged as 
to give good ventilation in the wall, and thus keep the room 
dry and cool. This cellar will always be an object of interest 
to farmers, as being the only one of its kind, I believe, in East 
Tennessee, if not in the State. 
The cellar of a new dairy has been dug, and at an early day 
T hope that we shall have located on the farm a model dairy, 
containing the most sensible and improved utensils. This 
dairy it is my purpose to place in the care of another student, 
who will receive much benefit from the practical instruction 
gathered there. 
The farm implements, I regret to say, are exceedingly 
antique, with few exceptions, though in a fair state of repair. 
Some of our tools have been used nearly a score of years, and
-P-A-G-E-334
  — 333 — 
are decidedly behind the times. However, it would not be ad- 
visable to have many valuable implements until we can have a 
suitable building to keep them in, the only place we have at 
present being under a shed on a dirt floor. 
The farm buildings are in a good state of repair, but are ex- 
ceedingly poorly constructed and badly arranged, and not 
nearly large enough for our purpose. We need one large barn, 
arranged in the most convenient manner, such as will answer 
for the four unpainted ones we now possess, and serve as models 
for our agricultural students and the farmers of the State. 
Such a barn can be built for $5,000, and is a positive necessity. 
Other farm buildings to cost $5,000 additional are sadly needed. 
    Certain students, who take unusual interest in agriculture, 
are allowed to live at the farm, if they will, and are placed in 
charge of regular farm duties or experimental work. This has 
been the case for the past year. However, we have accommo- 
dation for only three. It seems to me that it would be a wise 
provision to erect a suitable house for these agricultural 
students to live in, and room, boarding with the farm superin- 
tendent. Until some such provision is made we shall be unable 
to accommodate more such permanent agricultural farm stu- 
dents. We should have room for ten, at least. 
The university is to be congratulated upon possessing the 
yaluable farm it does. It is in most excellent condition, and 
with the necessary working equipments, such as buildings and 
implements, would be second to none in the State. 
GREENHOUSE. 
Upon taking charge of the greenhouse I found it in very 
poor condition. It sadly needed the services of painter and 
carpenter, and the collection of plants was in many respects 
inferior. The hot water heater was simply placed in a hole 
in the ground, and a roof placed over it on a level with 
the surface of the ground. During the past summer a neat 
work house has been erected over the boiler, and a good brick
-P-A-G-E-335
me Song 
ga 
cellar built to accommodate necessary fuel and heating appa- 
ratus. The glass house has been glazed and repainted, the rot- 
ting wood-work replaced by new timber, and the collection of 
plants rearranged and added to, by contribution and purchase. 
At the present writing the contents of this building are in bet- 
ter condition, and more servicable for class room work, than at 
any time since its erection. The sales from the greenhouse the 
past year have approximated two hundred dollars. 
GRounDs. 
An important improvement on the.grounds was made, with 
the aid of the Freshman Class in Agriculture, during the fall of 
1887. The south-east exposure of the hill, between the green- 
house and the summit, was graded off and a roadway and foot- 
path built. This adds greatly to the beauty of the place, and 
the path to its convenience. There being no outdoor orna- 
mental shrubs on the place, excepting near the greenhouse, one 
hundred and fifty were purchased and planted in various suit- 
able locations. Most all of these are doing well. On the lower 
slope of the hill, south of the agricultural building, has been 
planted about two hundred and fifty fruit trees and shrubs. 
This experimental orchard, composed of leading representatives 
of the various fruits, will be carefully cared for, and the varieties 
reported upon from time to time. On the north and upper slope 
of the hill has been built a substantial tool house for small im- 
plements, which is a model of its kind. There has been some 
necessary thinning out of trees about the grounds in order to 
allow others to develop to best advantage, and a tile drain has 
been laid about the base of the hill near the greenhouse, which 
carries off the water which would otherwise stand on the sur- 
face. A very large portion of this work was done by students. 
AGRICULTURAL INSTRUCTION. 
An effort is constantly being made to interest the students in 
the work. In view of the fact that there is no suitable text 
book on agriculture for college students, the instruction is 
either by lectures or in the field. The following is the 
lecture work :
-P-A-G-E-336
    — 335 — 
Freshman Year.—Chemistry of the farm, soils, manures, 
tillage. 
Sophomore Year.—Cereals and grasses, farm needs, fences, 
rural architecture, agricultural implements, and road-making. 
Junior Year.—Feeding stuffs, and herding and managing 
live stock. 
Senior Year.—Dairy husbandry, rural law and hygiene, and 
review of past work. 
The students are taken to the farm and given there practical 
instruction and work, wherever they can learn to advantage. 
They also visit, with the Professor, leading farms of the vicinity. 
The students are earnest, and compare favorably with those of 
any department in the University, I believe. 
While no effort is spared to make the class room instruction 
thorough, it is not so effective as it would be if the Uni- 
versity had a sufficient agricultural museum, containing the 
various models of tools, animals, and fruits, which go so far. to- 
ward making clear certain points in class room instruction. 
In connection with class instruction the greenhouse should 
be enlarged or rebuilt, so that it will be adapted to the growth 
of trees and plants which it will not now contain, and have 
sufficient space for conducting experimental work. 
Tn conclusion, notwithstanding the unsettled condition of 
the University during the past year, incident to reorganization, 
rebuilding, etc., the Agricultural Department bids fair to at- 
tain a high degree of success in the future. 
Iam very respectfully yours, 
C. 8. Piums, 
Professor of Agriculture.

IX._SCHOOL OF BOTANY AND HORTICULTURE. 
Botany treats of plants; their specific characteristics; their 
affinities with one another; their relation to soil and climate; 
their geographical distribution; their uses or the uses of their 
products ; their influence upon climate and upon health; their 
origin, manner of growth and reproduction; their minute 
structure, chemical composition and processes of nutrition; 
their diseases and conditions which favor or are unfavorable to 
their development—in fact, any and all questions that have to 
do with plants belong to the Science of Botany. 
The field for observation and acquisition of knowledge is a 
broad and fertile one, and even with students of mature years 
the work which can be done in an ordinary collegiate course 
must necessarily be limited in extent and elementary in char- 
acter. The mental training which the systematic prosecution 
- of the study affords, however, is of the highest order, and it is 
especially suited to cultivate the powers of observation; but 
aside from this, if the graduate has learned how to prosecute 
independent and original researches in any of the various 
branches of the science, all will have been accomplished that 
could be possibly expected. The course published in the An- 
nouncement for 1888-89 was planned with this end in view. 
Instead of adopting, without reserve, the “new method” of 
instruction, which consists in the exhaustive study of a few 
types, going into their minutest structure and physiology, or 
adhering solely to the old method, which was confined to the 
study of external forms, and gaining an acquaintance with the 
systematic relationship of the members of the plant kingdom, 
the two methods will be combined, beginning with the old, 
which is unrivaled for awakening an enthusiastic interest in 
the subject and proceeding to the second, which the student 
will then be prepared to take up without pressure or discour- 
agement. : 
The course will begin during the second half of the fresh-
-P-A-G-E-338
  7. 
man year, the time being occupied in the study of or- 
ganography, determination of species of phanerogams from the 
local flora and the preparation of herbarium specimens. — 337 — 
Continuing the course in the Sophomore year, the “new 
method” of teaching, or laboratory method, will be adopted. 
During the year types will be selected from the chief groups 
of the vegetable kingdom, beginning with the phanerogamia, 
and their development, reproduction, .and minute anatomy 
carefully studied. Some time will be given to the identifica- 
tion of species of thallophytes, especially in the important 
groups of parasite fungi. This work will necessitate the use 
of the compound microscope, and instruction.in handling this 
instrument, and in the use of microscopical re-agents will be 
taught. 
Physiological botany will oceupy the first half of the Junior 
year, and general systematic and economic botany, with labo- 
ratory exercises in the investigation of the fungus diseases of 
plants, the second half. 
Some of these subjects may be continued by special students 
during the Senior year and by post graduates, but the work of 
the school for the fourth year will be in horticulture. Horti- 
culture is one of the branches of applied botany, and the pre- 
vious work in the course will form a basis for and greatly 
facilitate an intelligent understanding of the subject. Graft- 
ing, budding, layering, and other methods of propagation and 
studies in pollination and hybridizing will enter into the 
course. Attention will be given to outdoor culture, culture 
under glass, the management of hot-beds, cold frames, etc., as 
well as the management of vines and fruit trees, and the dis- 
eases of cultivated plants. 
To those desiring to become physicians, assistance will be 
given in the acquisition of a knowledge of plants and plant 
products used in medicine, and especially of those low yege- 
table organisms known as_ bacteria, whose causal relation with 
  
-P-A-G-E-339
— 338 — 
many of the diseases of man and the lower animals is now 
well established. 
Those in the agricultural course will be taught to recognize 
the useful plants, and to distinguish these from those that are 
injurious, and to intelligently care for, in health and disease, 
plants cultivated in the field or garden. They will receive 
special instruction in grasses, and in the investigation of field 
and garden seeds. 
The students in Civil Engineering will be taught how to ex- 
amine the minute structure of various woods, and investigate 
the decay of timber arising from the attack of fungi. 
During the course special subjects for research will be as- 
signed individual students, to be prosecuted under the direction 
of the instructor. This will give the student a feeling of re- 
sponsibility and an independence of thought and action that 
will inspire interest and lead to practical methods of original 
work. 
The work of the school, as here planned, is in accord with 
the most approved systems, and equal in grade to that pursued 
in any of the most advanced and best equipped of our higher 
colleges and universities, and the hope is expressed that the 
Board of Trustees will provide the means for its successful 
prosecution. When in full operation it will demand all the 
time and energies of the professor and a skilled assistant. 
Lecture rooms are now provided, and a well lighted room, 
thirty feet by nineteen feet, supplied with gas and water, is 
now partially furnished for a working laboratory. Recently 
the large and exceedingly valuable collection of plants of Dr. 
A. Gattinger, of Nashville, has been purchased for the Uni- 
versity, giving us at once an excellent herbarium, numbering 
between three and four thousand species, containing nearly all 
of the flowering plants and ferns of the State, and doubtless 
the majority of those belonging to the South. Immediate pro- 
vision should be made for the proper disposition and display of 
this collection, in order to render it accessible to students who 
    
-P-A-G-E-340
— 339 — 
  may wisli to consult it. In order to properly study and identify 
the numérous species of fungi, plants familiarly known as rust, 
smut, blight, mildew, mold, rot, etce., it is of very great im- 
portance to have at hand named collections for comparison, and 
the expenditure of a few hundred dollars in the purchase of 
some of the collections of these plants now on sale will be a 
wise investment. I would especially urge the immediate pur- 
chase of such fungi as can be obtained from the collections of 
the late Dr. Ravenel, of North Carolina, and from Rev. A. B. 
Langlois, of Alabama. 
A small collection of fungi has recently been contributed to 
the museum by Mr. W. C. Stevenson, of Philadelphia, and an- 
other has been added by the professor. 
In addition to the collection of flowering plants from Dr. 
Gattinger, some of the fascicles of Southern plants distributed 
by Mr. A. H. Curtis, of Florida, have been secured, as well as 
a small lot of South Carolina and Georgia plants collected by 
G. McCarthy. 
One of the most valuable acquisitions of the Botanical Mu- 
seum is a named collection of plant seeds embracing nearly 
one thousand varieties. As this collection contains the majority 
of our grass and weed seeds, its educational value to the student 
in agriculture is apparent. 
The laboratory outfit, simple microscopes, tweezers, scalpels, 
ete., necessary for the class beginning botany, have been pur- 
chased, and some of the apparatus, including seven compound 
microscopes (made by Leitz), with accessories required in the 
second year, have also been procured. 
A small but excellent working botanical library, belonging 
to the Experiment Station and to the professor, will be open to 
consultation by special and advanced students. A number of 
the leading botanical journals are now being received. 
Nothing will more surely conduce to the excellence of the
-P-A-G-E-341
  ; - esa yy 
botanical and horticultural department than a large and well 
stocked library, and I feel that I cannot too strongly urge the 
necessity of making a liberal appropriation for this purpose. 
Some of the most needed works of reference are costly, but 
their possible value to the State through the young men who 
may here have an opportunity to consult them is a far greater 
consideration. This State must afford its students equal educa- 
tional advantages and opportunities with those offered in other 
States if it would keep its young men at home, or hope to pro- 
duce more than second rate scholars.

X._SCHOOL OF BIOLOGY AND ZOOLOGY. 
To the President of the University of Tennessee : 
In accordance with instructions received, | hereby make the 
following report upon the objects, scope, present condition, and 
future needs and prospects of my department: 
When the school was taken in charge, at the beginning of 
the present collegiate year, it was found that in consequence of 
there having been previously no distinct department of zool- 
ogy, and of the instructions having been given for several years 
previous by professors in other departments, whose best efforts 
had of course been reserved for their own work, the knowledge 
of the students was in a very confused state. This state of af- 
fairs rendered it necessary to begin teaching the elements to 
classes of juniors and seniors, and made it impossible to pursue 
any work of a really advanced character. It was felt that un- 
der these circumstances the chief attention should be paid to 
~ the lower classes, and it is believed that a foundation is being 
here laid for work of a high class in the future. 
The impossibility of getting the necessary apparatus and 
supplies immediately has also somewhat hindered the work.
-P-A-G-E-342
  © te eens ae 
: ce — 341 — 
The objects that it seems desirable to accomplish in this de- 
partment are: 
1. To develop the observing and comparative powers of the 
mind, and awaken an interest in living forms. 
2. To give a sufficient knowledge of the main facts in the 
morphology of the various groups of animals to enable the stu- 
dent to comprehend and discuss intelligently the proofs of or- 
ganic evolution, and the theories that have been advanced to 
account for this evolution. 
3. To give at least an elementary knowledge of human phys- 
iology, and, with this as a basis, a sufficient knowledge of hy- 
giene to enable the student to cope intelligently with the pre- 
ventable causes of disease. 
4. To give those intending to become practical farmers a 
knowledge of the structure, life, habits, and classification of in- 
sects, especially of those beneficial and injurious to agriculture, 
with the best means of preventing the ravages of the latter. 
5. To give to those intending to become farmers such a 
knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of the domestic ani- 
mals as will enable them to profit by the instruction in veteri- 
nary medicine, given by the Professor of Agriculture. 
6. To offer to those intending to study medicine a compara- 
tively full course in the methods of investigation and subject- 
matter of physiology and histology, and thus to relieve, to 
some extent, the overcrowded condition of the medical curric- 
ulum. 
7. To give those intending to become teachers of and inyes- 
tigators in zoology a personal acquaintance with the facts and 
principles of that science, to imbue them with the true spirit of 
scientific research, and to train them in the methods of original 
investigation. 
 
-P-A-G-E-343
on 
For the accomplishment of these purposes the following 
courses of instruction have been planned. All except the 
second are given this year; the second it is purposed to add 
next year. 
Coursr 1—Inrropuctory Zoonoey. 
Two exercises in field and laboratory work per week through 
the year. During the present year the time up to Christmas 
vacation is being spent in the collection, preservation, and clas- 
sification of insects, and the detailed structure of the structure 
of one typical species. Hereafter the minute study of structure 
will be reserved until a later part of the course, and the whole 
time until Christmas devoted to the collection, preservation, 
and classification of specimens, as an introduction to the 
methods of systematic zoology, and also as an introduction to 
the more advanced course in entomology (Course 5). 
The remainder of the year will be spent in the study of a 
typical manual, in order to instruct the student in anatomical 
and histological methods, and to serve as a basis*for his further 
studies in comparative anatomy, systematic zoology, and the 
physiology of man and the domestic animals (Courses 2, 3, 4, 
and 6). 
This first year’s work is required of all who intend to take 
any of the other courses in this department. During the 
present year it is being taken by twenty students. 
Course 2—ANatomy AND PuystoLoay or tux Domestic ANIMALS. 
One lecture per week during the first term, to be given after 
the present year. 
Coursz 8—Sysrematic Zoonoey. 
In this course the chief facts in the structure of the different 
groups of animals are observed, and the resulting classification 
and the philosophical basis for this classification studied. Three 
exercises per week, partly laboratory work, partly lectures, ex-   
-P-A-G-E-344
  — 843 — 
tending through the year. The course in this year taken by 
six students. 
Coursr 4—Human Puystonoey. 
This course has, during the present year, owing partly to a 
lack of previous preparation in the students taking it (here- 
after to be supplied by courses 1 and 8), and partly to a lack of 
facilities for laboratory work, been confined to lectures upon 
the general facts and principles of human physiology. It is 
hoped that hereafter it may be practicable to make it consist 
largely of laboratory work of a more advanced character. Five 
exercises per week during the first term. This year taken by 
seven students. 
Course 5—EnromoLoey. 
Practical field and laboratory work with special reference to 
noxious and beneficial insects. Five exercises per week during 
second term. 
YoursE 6— ADVANCED HistoLoey. 
This course is designed to give to those who intend to study 
medicine a thorough knowledge of histological methods, and 
as much of the subject-matter of histology as the time devoted 
to it will permit. Five exercises per week during the second 
term. 
Tn addition to these courses, the vast importance of bacteria 
in their relations to man would render it very desirable that a 
course in the methods of bacteriological research, designed for 
those who intend to study medicine, and for physicians who 
graduated before the subject had risen to its present importance, 
should be established. But with the present instructing force 
this is impossible; indeed, the work already inaugurated de- 
mands, for its satisfactory accomplishment, more time than the 
instructor can well devote to it. 
The apparatus belonging to the department at the beginning 
of the year was confined to two dissecting microscopes, in good
-P-A-G-E-345
— 344 — 
   condition, and one compound microscope, of an old pattern, 
and nearly worn out. There have since been added ten sets of 
good dissecting instruments, twenty dissecting trays, glassware 
necessary for making and keeping re-agents, fifteen insect nets, 
and a few other inexpensive things. 
The department is in urgent need of apparatus and supplies; 
among these ten compound microscopes, costing about $400 
(this number would necessitate the using of each one by three 
students the present year, and probably by more than that num- 
ber next year). Also injecting apparatus, entomological cases 
for student collections, more insect nets, chemicals for preserv- 
ing specimens for dissection, and museum and general labora- 
tory re-agents, and considerable small apparatus for students’ 
use, the whole aggregating not less than $150 more, or a total 
of $550. H. E, Summers. 
XI.SCHOOL OF MILITARY SCIENCE AND TACTICS. 
Dr. Charles W. Dabney, Jr., President University of Tennessee : 
Dear Str—I have the honor to submit for your considera- 
tion the following report : 
In compliance with orders from the War Department, of date 
October 1, 1888, I reported at the University for duty early in 
the month. As the term had commenced in September I found 
the schedule of time for recitations already arranged, and it 
was impracticable to give such theoretical instruction in mili- 
tary art and science as was contemplated by the orders under 
which I was acting. 
It is my desire, during the remainder of my tour of duty, to 
make this department as thorough as possible, as well for the 
interests of the University and my own gratification as. for 
a conscientious performance of duty. «
-P-A-G-E-346
  — 345 — 
  The details of the work in the department are, as you know, 
reported to the Secretary of War from two different sources, 
namely, my own report rendered quarterly, and the report of a 
regular inspector, submitted at least once a year. My first re- 
port will be forwarded on the 31st inst. 
The Military Department of the University has, however, re- 
cently undergone a minute inspection by Maj. Menry W. Law- 
ton, of the Inspector General’s Department. He made inquiry 
concerning every detail relating to the Military Department of 
the University—its organization ; its efficiency, as regards dis- 
cipline and drill; the means for enforcing discipline; methods 
of instruction, both practical and theoretical, and the interest 
manifested in military instruction and exercises, both by the 
faculty and students. As the University had not yet received ~ 
arms and accoutrements from the Government his inspection 
would have been limited but for the privilege extended him of 
visiting the dormitories, mess-hall, hospital, and other buildings. 
It affords me much pleasure to state that the result of his in- 
spection was, in every respect, most satisfactory to himself, and 
his approval of the management of the Military Department 
was emphatic. 
For theoretical instruction, as soon as the time can be suita- 
bly arranged, I would suggest recitations in United States In- 
fantry and Artillery Tactics, to be confined to students of the 
Junior and Sophomore Classes. Following this will be recita- 
tions in army regulations, or such part of them as is essential to 
a thorough understanding of its organization and government 
of our own military forces. It will be concluded by a series of 
lectures, which will embrace the following subjects: 
Minor Tactics—Organization, location, and management of 
pickets and outposts; military reconnoisance. 
The duties of the different arms and their relation to each 
other in active operations. 
Grand Tacties—Organization, marches, and maneuvers of 
armies.
-P-A-G-E-347
846 — 
Strategy—Principles of attack and defense. 
A description of typical campaigns from maps illustrating 
military principles. 
The foregoing is a brief outline of a course which embraces 
many details not necessary to enumerate, and one which, while 
it will not consume a great deal of time, will convey a fair idea 
of military science. Very respectfully, 
Your obedient servant, 
E. E. Gayuz, 
First Lieutenant, Second Artillery, U. 8. A.

AN ACT to establish a College in East Tennessee. Passed October 26, 1807. 
Wuereas, it is provided by an act of the Congress of the 
United States, entitled “ An Act to authorize the State of 
Tennessee to issue grants to certain lands therein described, and 
to settle the claims to the vacant and unappropriated lands 
within the same,” passed the 18th day of April, 1806, that 
there shall be one hundred thousand acres of land ‘laid off on 
the south side of Holston and French Broad, and west side of 
Big Pigeon rivers, to which the Indian claim had been extin- 
guished; and that the proceeds of the sales of the said one 
- hundred thousand acres of land should be appropriated in such 
way by the Legislature of this State that the profits thereof 
should be applied to the support of two colleges in this State, 
the one in East and the other in West Tennessee, to be estab- 
lished by the Legislature of this State ; and whereas, it is expe- 
dient that this General Assembly should establish a college in 
East Tennessee, capable of receiving that part of said donation

THE JAMES K, SHOOK SCHOOL BUILDING. 
Traey City has secured: this school building through the lib- 
erality of Mr. A. M. Shook, one of its prominent citizens, who 
will present it to the town as a gift, the citizens having agreed 
to permit themselves to be assessed a sufficient amount an- 
nually for its support.

——_EIRST FLOOR — 
THE JAS.K.SHOOK. SCHOOL BUILGING. 
The building will be called the “James K. Shook School 
Building,” in honor of the father of the donor. The lot on 
which it will be erected is 346 feet by 247 feet, is bounded by 
three streets, and occupies a commanding position in the town. 
24—s, 8. P. I.
-P-A-G-E-363

It is designed to accommodate four hundred pupils, there 
being eight class rooms, 24 feet by 32 feet, each of which will 
accommodate fifty pupils, thus giving to each pupil fifteen 
square feet of floor area. There is a superintendent’s office on 
the first floor and a teachers’ room on the second floor convenient 
to the class rooms; also an assembly room 48 feet by 72 feet on 
the first floor, which takes up in height both stories of the 
building. This is designed to be used by the school on special ee ane 
  
  
  
  Se aon EL oOR, —— 
occasions, and for public gatherings by the citizens of the town. 
The class rooms are grouped in the most convenientemanner, 
and. are so arranged as to admit of windows on two sides of six 
of them. Where this could not be done in two of the rooms, 
the windows are of a different size and are differently arranged, 
but all the class rooms will have the same area of window space. 
The second floor is accessible by two broad platform atair- 
  
oe
-P-A-G-E-364

ways which are centrally located and easy of ascent, and the 
facilities for ingress and exit from the building are convenient 
and ample. 
The basement will be used for the heating and ventilating 
apparatus, and for storage purposes. In the basement will be 
located also the closets and vaults. 
The system of heating and ventilation adopted is that known 
as the Ruttan-Smead system, whereby a large volume of fresh 
air, warm or cold, as may be desired, is made to pass in con- 
tinuous motion through the rooms, completely changing the 
atmosphere in them once every fifteen or twenty minutes with- 
out affecting their temperature. The air thus removed from 
each room is collected into the foul air shafts and escapes into 
the outer air several feet above the roof of the building. 
“The Smead Dry Closet System,” which has been used with 
such satisfactory results in the public school buildings of 
Washington City, D. C., Toledo and Columbus, Ohio, and in 
school buildings of many other cities of the North and South, 
will be used in this building also. This system of dry closets, 
aside from the trifling cost of their construction, and cost to 
maintain, is of incalculable value when constructed in con- 
nection with the Ruttan-Smead system of heating and ventila- 
tion. 
After the pure air has been introduced into the class rooms 
and auditorium, and after it has circulated through each room, 
it passes out through grated openings which are placed at short 
intervals in the baseboards on the outer boundaries of the room. 
This warm air then passes under the floor, heating it sutticiently 
to warm the feet, and is carried to the foul air room in the 
basement. From thence it is drawn by way of arched open- 
ings in the brick wall through the privy vaults beneath the 
seats to the foul air shafts, whence it escapes into the open 
air at the rate of several thousand cubic feet per minute. With 
this system of closets there are no noisome odors, no pipes, no 
water-works, no plumbers’ appliances, and no sewerage system

  By 
Any one who shall be present who has not been given a 
place on some committee will be assigned to the committee of 
his choice. 
Ido most earnestly urge the County Superintendents to be 
present. The meeting held one year ago was the most impor- 
tant educational convention ever assembled in the State; the 
work done the most beneficial. , 
The County Courts, in many instances, paid the expenses of 
the County Superintendents, and the same will be done this 
year. 
You cannot afford to stay away if you are in earnest in the 
work to build up the educational interests of your respective 
counties. Some have written me saying the salary received will 
- not justify the expense; then I say resign, and let some one be 
elected who will attend, salary or no salary. 
Address all communications to Prof. Frank Goodman, Sec- 
retary, Nashville, Tenn. 
_ Yours truly, 
FRANK M. SMITH, 
Superintendent. 
The annual meeting of the Association of Public School 
Officers of 'ennessee convened in the Senate chamber, at the 
State Capitol, Nashville, Tuesday morning, December 11, 1888, 
shortly after 10 o’clock. 
President W. Mac Fuqua called the meeting to order, and 
announced that the proceedings would be opened with prayer 
by Mr. Wm. H. Morrow, of Nashville, Tenn. 
The President said: 
“T need not remind you of the objects of this convention. I
-P-A-G-E-373
Berge 
  _ regard this as the most important.educational meeting ever held 
in the State of Tennessee. I therefore hope that our delibera- 
tions will all be characterized by calmness and proper consider- 
tion. I now introduce to you a gentleman well known to you, 
and one who really needs no introduction, Prof. Z. H. Brown, 
Superintendent of the City Schools of Nashville, who will de- 
liver the address of welcome.” 
PROF. Z. H. BROWN, of Nashville, 
spoke as follows: 
“Mr. Chairman and Members of the Convention : 
“When it was made known to me, by the circular issued by 
the Executive Committee, that I was expected to deliver the ” 
welcome address on this occasion, I am free to say I should 
not have been more astounded had I been notified that on 
the 11th day of December I was to deliver, in one of the lead- 
ing churches of the city, a sermon on ‘infant baptism.’ Those 
who know me best are well aware I have never sought to be 
conspicuous nor aspired to be a public speaker, but have ever 
been content to be an humble worker in the Master’s vineyard. 
“But, fellow superintendents, representing as you do the 
dearest and most sacred interests of the people at large, you 
need no formal welcome at my hands, for you should be as the 
glad sunshine in dreary winter, or the genial showers in early 
spring. Every town and hamlet, and every hearthstone within: 
this Commonwealth, should ever extend to you a generous hos- 
pitality. Were I even an orator I should consider it worse 
than folly to strive to entertain you with figures of rhetoric or 
flights of oratory. The responsibilities of the hour are too 
weighty and time is too precious to be fritted away in glittering 
theories or impracticable vagaries.

energies in efforts to dispose of the surplus in the United States. ’

treasury, a proper adjustment of a system of tariff reform, the 
navigition of the Cumberland River, the development of the 
agricultural and mineral resources of the States; yet it has 
never occurred to them that the unknown quantity for which 
they have been so earnestly seeking, in all these problems, is 
education—and that solution is attainable only through the en- 
lightenment of the masses—morally, mentally, and physically; 
and if Tennessee is ever to reach that high plane to which she 
is entitled by virtue of her climate, her soil, and her natural ad- 
vantages, the conditions must be made such that this desidera- 
tum is possible. , 
“What, then, is the duty of the hour? Plainly, to take bear- 
ings to ascertain where we are, to look around us to see if we 
have kept pace with that progressive spirit which has charac- 
terized our surroundings. A casual survey will reveal to us 
that modes of travel have rapidly increased, inventions have 
multiplied ‘ad infinitum,’ and science has dug deeper into hid- 
den mysteries and brought to the surface truths heretofore 
undiscovered. 
“Books on the ‘theory and practice of teaching, educational 
journals, and simplified text-books,’ are as numerous as leaves 
in autumn ; but are we keeping abreast with the onward march? _ 
Half a century ago the only qualifications required at the hands 
of an applicant to teach were, that he should be equipped with 
a blue-back speller and a bunch of rods. A man who had 
failed at stage-driving or toll-gate keeping, was thought emi- 
nently fitted to keep school—especially so if he had sufficient 
muscle to manage the big boys. How isit now? Fortunately 
for the children and the cause of education there are no such 
monstrosities in existence. Teaching has become a profession 
and education an art, and the teacher, as in other professions, is 
expected to make some preparation before permitted to practice 
the art. Superintendents, teachers’ associations, and normal 
schools were unknown in olden times, but progress has brought 
with it inéreased facilities for advancement; and as the tele- 
phone has minimized the intricacies of business, so these valu-
-P-A-G-E-375
  Sui yeni 
able adjuncts have had a like tendency in the successful man- 
agement of schools. 
“Tt has been said that ‘camp-meetings bring the people to- 
gether, who make new acquaintances and revive old associa- 
tions; that they create religious excitement, and are great 
pioneers in the propagation of religion.’ This meeting of 
superintendents, brought together at the instance of Captain 
Frank Smith, will, doubtless, kindle enthusiasm and awaken an 
interest which will be felt throughout the State. I take it, you 
have come to make your annual contribution, to the general 
benefit fund. You are here to add your experience, your 
methods, your success, and to present your needs, your difficul- 
ties, and your environments, all of which should enlist the 
earnest attention of this body.. A free and mutual interchange 
of opinions will go far to remove seeming insurmountable diffi- 
culties, and to inspire fresh zeal. 
“That which most dampens ardor and chills hope is the ab- 
solute indifference of the Legislature. Had there been as much 
money spent by the people in the last decade for education as 
has been used for electioneering purposes, to-day school houses 
and normal colleges would dot the entire State.. There are 
those who claim to be patriots and philanthropists who would 
cheerfully contribute hundreds of dollars to the campaign fund, 
but would not give one cent to properly equip every boy in the 
land for citizenship. Others are willing to give more of their 
time to elect a constable in their district than to secure the serv- 
ices of the best superintendent or teacher in America, though 
the interest of every boy and girl in their county is involved. 
This is to be regretted, but he who holds the handles of the 
plow must ever look forward. The goal for which we are aim- 
ing is not behind, but ahead of us. 
. e 
“Superintendents, yours is indeed a most trying position. 
To be held responsible for the success of a system of schools in 
your respective counties, and to have your efforts, often par- 
alyzed if not wholly destroyed by the appointment of incom-
-P-A-G-E-376
  ee 2 
petent teachers, is most deplorable. Ignorant and self-conceited 
trustees are impediments which, if possible, should be removed. 
In your dealings with pupils, patrons, or teachers, ever hold the 
scales of justice in equipoise. In your estimate of teachers be 
merciful, remembering that it is human to err. Set the ex- 
ample of promptness in the performance of all your duties, 
and expect those under you to be likewise. Let young and in- 
experienced teachers be the especial objects of your attention 
and sympathy. Endeavor to inspire your teachers with enthu- 
siasm and interest in their work, and to come before their 
classes with each lesson fully in hand. Cultivate a cheerful 
and happy disposition, and be consoled in the thought that the 
outlook is growing brighter. 
“During your stay in the city allow me to assure you the 
doors of the public schools shall not simply stand ajar, but will 
be thrown wide open to receive you, should inclination so direct 
your footsteps. And now, my co-laborers, in the language of 
Mansfield, I close, ‘When I read the prophetic delineations of 
ahappy future and behold the beautiful pictures drawn by in- 
spired writers; when I look upon the visible universe and see 
every law perfect—every animate or inanimate thing fulfilling 
its functions—every orb rolling with unvarying accuracy 
through its appointed circuit; and when I feel and know that 
man has every faculty of soul and every taste adapted to per- 
form, bring out and en oy the same perfect round of beautiful 
harmonies; nothing wanti ; but his own will. I also feel that 
the prophetic picture is not a delusion; that the time will come 
when humanity will exhibit the same beautiful order and har- 
mony; when the perverted mind will be restored to its recti- 
tude, and this earth exhibit the scene of a happy and a rejoicing 
people.’” 
At the conclusion of his address Prof. Brown extended a cor- 
dial invitation to the members of the Association to visit the 
schools of Nashville. He said he desired to get better ac- 
quainted with them, and if they would come to his office and 
see him he would take pleasure in giving them the benetit of his 
experience.

  J. W. SAYLOR, of Knox County, 
responded as follows: 
“ Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 
“The cordial welcome that has just been extended us to the 
queen city on the Cumberland, with its increasing population, 
its many points of interest, and numerous enterprises, is to us 
a source of profound gratitude and pleasure. Nashville is a 
city not only noted for its beautiful women and gallant men, 
but is famous for its churches and institutions of learning. 
Here are situated Vanderbilt University, Fisk University, Cen- 
tral Tennessee College, University of Nashville, Peabody Nor- 
mal College, Nashville College for Young Ladies, the city 
schools, among them the famous Howard School, which is not 
excelled by any on the American continent, and other excellent 
schools. Nashville certainly deserves the title of the ‘ Atbens 
of the South,’ 
«We are glad to meet our companions in arms, these dis- 
pensers of knowledge in the various counties of Tennessee, in 
such a grand city, and while here we hope to hear glorious re- 
ports of victories over the powers of illiteracy. I hope our 
mingling together, and the exchange of ideas, will prove both 
pleasurable and profitable, and that such a fire of enthusiasm 
will be kindled that will burn, and, as Prof. Brown says, will 
permeate every county in the State in favor of education, and 
that ere long Tennessee will shine as the brightest star in the 
galaxy of States.” 
JOHN S. WHITE, of Chester County, 
in responding to the address of welcome, said: 
“Prof. Brown had made the best speech, and had said more 
in the fewest words of wisdom, he had ever listened to, and 
that he hailed it as an omen of success equal to that which 
marked the Sixteenth Century Reformation led by that silent 
councellor known in history as William of Orange, king of the 
Netherlands.”

JOHN H. ALLEN, of Bedford County, said: 
“T do not know exactly what that item on the programme 
means, but I presume it means the progress we have made in 
the work in which we are engaged since we entered into it. I 
have only to say for Bedford that we are all at work, and that
-P-A-G-E-379
  —14— 
we love the public school system. We are advocating it, de- 
fending it, and moving forward. 
«“ We have a new academy building in the county that is 30 x 
60, neatly and tastefully painted, well ventilated, well furnished 
with boards, modern desks, maps, and charts, and it is a credit 
to the community. By the side of it stands the old school build- 
ing. I wish I had a picture of these two buildings here this 
morning. It would present a clearer picture of our work than 
I could give in a two hours’ address. The old building is 20 x 
380, It has no paint about it. The picture is not overestimated 
in the progress of our work within the last four or five years. 
“Four years ago Shelbyville did not have one dollar’s worth 
of public school property, now look at what she owns. The 
colored people have a splendid school building there now. 
Across at Wartrace, where four years ago they did not have 
$350 worth of public school property, they now own more than 
seven or eight thousand dollars worth. At Bellebuckle three 
years ago there was not a dollar’s worth of public schogl prop- 
erty; now Bedford College belongs to the public, and besides 
they have an excellent school for the colored people. The 
same may be said of Cottage Grove. The building interest in 
my county is still moving forward. 
“Four years ago, when I called the first teachers’ meeting, I 
succeeded in getting out fifteen teachers, and we met in a room 
nearly as large as this, and had a profitable time. We have 
made wonderful progress, and it is going to burn on as long as 
American liberty prevails.” 
DANIEL ALLEN, of Benton County, said: 
“There is some improvement in the school work in our 
county. Our county is not as wealthy as some of the other 
counties in the State. My connection with the schools began 
about ten years ago, and am glad to say that we are making 
some progress, but not as fast as I anticipated. I have en-
-P-A-G-E-380
  etter) 
deavored to do all I could to build up the public school system. 
I think there is a great deal more to be done. We have not as 
many high schools as some of the surrounding counties have. 
I like the public school system as far as it goes, but I do not 
think we have money enough to run the schools sufficiently. 
We will not have that success in the poorer counties of the 
State unless we have more money. I hope the time is not far 
distant when we will have eight or nine months’ schools in 
Benton County.” 
J. W. DUGGAN, of Blount County, said: 
“T am happy to say that the children of Blount County are 
pretty well cared for. Our county seat, a little town of 2,500 
inhabitants, is often said to be a town of schools. We have 
two colleges, two or three academies or high schools, and some 
good free schools in town. The schools in the county are pro- 
gressing very well. We are not as well furnished with houses 
throughout the county as we would like to be. We have com- 
petent teachers for the work. In some of the districts the terms 
are short, some of them only three months long, while in others 
the children go to school for five months. Our salaries are not 
as good as we would like to have them, but they average about 
$27 per month.” 
W. J. McGEE, of Campbell County, said: 
“T feel it my duty to tell you that within the last four years 
Campbell County has gone from fifty-seven school days to 
ninety-three. I want to tell you that we have five excellent 
schools. One seminary has about one hundred and eighty 
boarding pupils; Franklin Academy, located at Jacksboro, is 
in a flourishing condition. When I was elected Superintendent 
we had one hundred and eighty school directors and sixty-four 
school districts. I got the County Court to redistrict the county 
so as to give us the same number of school districts as there 
were civil districts.

_ “We adopted a series of text-books. I have done all the 
State Superintendent has told me to do, and I am so zealous in 
this work that I would have walked here if I could not have 
- come any other way. 
“JT stand here a poor man, but my heart is in the cause of 
education. I have two of my sons with me. One of them has 
just completed his education at the University at Knoxville, 
and the other one I want to send until he is educated. 
“Do away with crime, build more school-houses and churches, 
and you will have a prosperous country.” 
J. S. WHITE, of Chester County, said: 
“T represent the youngest county in the State, and it is the 
highest point, topographically, in West Tennessee. There are 
a great many impassable streams which necessitates more school 
districts and schools than we ought to have. Some of our 
school districts are too small, and I have tried to have this 
remedied. 
“‘My principal work has been with the teachers, not that I 
can improve their knowledge in various branches, but that they 
may have more tact in government, and more facility in‘com- 
municating knowledge. 
“Our teachers have outgrown the schools, and the result is 
we cannot keep them. They have gone to the four winds, 
where they can get increased salaries. When the money gives 
out the directors will discontinue the schools. 
“Our County Court has made a liberal appropriation for 
school purposes for such a poor county, considering that they 
have had to build a court-bouse, public buildings, a vast num- 
ber of bridges to put up, and levees that have cost thousands 
of dollars. I am looking forward to the time when all that 
will be remedied, and when schools will not only run ten 
months but will be paid for.
-P-A-G-E-382

  “As far as the schools in our county are concerned we have 
every reason to congratulate ourselves, with the exception of 
the want of funds. We are also trying to remedy this by get- 
ting up subscription schools and uniting them with the public 
schools in every part of the county. It is not the want of in- 
terest in our schools, but the lack of funds that is troubling us 
just now.” 
JAMES WOMMACK, of Coffee County, said: 
“Tn regard to schools in Coffee County I am glad to say that 
they have gained ground, although it is a poor county. We 
have some very good schools—the Beech Grove College, the 
city schools at Tullahoma, the Manchester College, and at 
Hillsboro we have a good school, Stevens Institute, where a 
young man or young lady can complete their education, al- 
though it is away from: the railroad. There they can get a 
thorough commercial course if they want it, and shorthand and 
typewriting is taught there. The Institutes are well attended, 
and I take it there is no more important work than holding 
Institutes in various portions of the county. I find that it cre- 
ates an interest everywhere. I am glad to be able to meet so 
many able teachers here from Tennessee. Upon our labors rest 
the educational interests, morally, religiously, and politically. 
T hope ere long to see the grand old State of Tennessee unfurl 
her banner as the leading educational State in the Union. I 
think the public schools in Coffee County are in a better condi- 
tion than they were when I found them, yet I am not satisfied 
with them so far as my work is concerned.” 
W. MAC FUQUA, of Davidson County, said: 
“We have 142 schools in this county, 13 of them in the city 
of Nashville. If I should say every school in my jurisdiction 
was doing well I would be telling a falsehood. They are not, 
and there has never been a time when every school in the 
county was doing well, because every teacher does not do his

proud of our achore 
W. H. McMILLAN, of Decatur County, said: 
“JT have not very much to say. I represent a very small 
county, lying on the Tennessee River in West Tennessee. We 
have no excellent schools in that county. The academy at the 
county seat is a very good school. The school work over the 
county is progressing very well. Our school terms are, of 
course, short. We have fallen into the fatal error of having too 
many school districts. We have many creeks in Decatur 
County, and, of course, have to have many bridges, and on ac- 
count of these natural obstructions the directors seem to think 
there ought to be a school-house in every corner of the county. 
One member spoke of his earnest desire to be at this meeting, 
and said if he could not have gotten here any other way he 
would have walked. I did not have to walk, but I started here 
a week ago, but on account of delays along the Tennessee River 
I did not reach here until last Sunday night.” 
A. J. GOODSON, of DeKalb County, said: 
“TJ think my county can boast of her schools. She has three 
prominent schools within her borders. As a general thing 
the schools are doing well, and the teachers are up with the 
new methods of instruction. Like the Superintendent from 
Davidson, if I should say that all of my schools were doing 
well I would simply be telling a falsehood, consequently I shall 
not say it.” 
D. E. McCORKLE, of Dyer County, said: 
“T shall not attempt to give a detailed account of the school 
work in Dyer County. She has some excellent schools and 
some that are not so excellent. We have at Dyersburg and
-P-A-G-E-384
  a cero 
Newbern high schools perfectly arranged and as well systemized 
as any schools in the State outside of the city of Nashville. 
We have splendid teachers at both of these places, and the 
pupils seem to be thoroughly drilled and trained in the work. 
In regard to the country schools, they are continually improving. 
We have worked out of the old inconveniences, the old log 
school houses and the old rude and imperfect desks. We have 
splendid brick buildings at Dyersburg and Newbern. Some of 
the rural districts are still behind, with log school houses, and 
the old method of teaching is yet pursued. Most of the schools 
have maps and charts and improved facilities for instruction. I 
do not take any credit to myself for this improvement. My 
friend from Chester County says he is from the highest point 
in Tennessee. I can say that I live at the lowest, but we have 
begun to work up.” 
S. B. ADAMS, of Fayette County, said: 
“Tam aman of some age, yet Iam the youngest Superin- 
tendent in this body, having been elected last October to fill out 
an unexpired term. Since my election I have endeavored to 
devote myself earnestly aud heartily to my work. I have tried 
to observe, in every particular, the instructions of our State Su- 
perintendent. Our public schools have not been in operation 
since I have been in office. I have, however, been visiting the 
private schools as much as possible, and I find that some of 
them are doing excellent work. While I am free to admit that 
some of our teachers are not up to the standard, yet we have 
some as good teachers as can be found anywhere. I am sorry 
to say that we have not got very much school property in my 
county. The public schools are generally consolidated with 
other institutions. There isa male and female school in my 
town, and there is a mixed school at La Grange, and schools at 
various points in the county, and I think they are all doing good 
work. I have been all over the county conferring with the 
directors and trying to get up an interest, and I think it will 
result in much good. I found, to my sorrow, that there was
-P-A-G-E-385
eo 
  not that conformity to the law that I thought ought to be ob- 
served. My idea is to be a law-abiding man. If we have a 
good law, let us observe it, and if we have one that is not so 
good, let us not try to get clear of it by breaking it, but let us 
appeal to the proper authority and get a better one substituted 
in its place. The school directors have universally pledged me 
a more rigid observance of the law and more diligence in pro- 
moting school interests. Most of the directors are noble men 
and men of intelligence, but they have just been running along 
thinking that nothing could be accomplished, but I have been 
giving them some of the documents that have been sent out 
by the State Superintendent, and have been trying to work 
them up to a more intelligent action. I find that the greatest 
difficulty with us is the need of more money. This is a money 
world, and you cannot do anything without money. 
- SCOTT ANTHONY, of Franklin County, said: 
“TJ have heard that a still tongue makes a wise head, and I 
do not think it necessary for me to make any extended remarks 
to show you the work that is being done in the way of educa- 
tion in our county. She represents herself. We have some 
good schools that we can boast of; some of them are not such 
as we would like to have them, but we hope for much improve- 
ment in the future.” 
J. J. ZUCCARELLO, of Giles County, said: 
“Tam happy to represent one of the leading counties of the 
State. Our scholastic population is 14,000. We havea good 
number of schools in our county, more than we need, in fact, 
but they are making progress. 
“We have an organization which meets to discuss the im- 
portance of public schools, and we have also organized a County 
 
-P-A-G-E-386
  es 
Teachers’ Association, which meets in different parts of the 
county in order to create enthusiasm. 
“We have a graded school which has taken the place of our 
old Giles County College. 
“Our Institute work is making rapid progress. I have vis- 
ited 120 schools out of 150.” 
0. L. WEST, of Grainger County, said: 
“The schools of my county are not what they ought to be, 
but for the past few years they have been increasing slowly. 
We have sixty per cent. better houses now than four years 
ago, and fifty per cent. better teachers than two years ago. 
There is a great deal more interest manifested now than a few 
years ago. 
“While we have a poor county so far as wealth is concerned, 
we hope in the near future to have a rich county in the way of 
public schools.” 
H. D. HUFFAKER, of Hamilton County, said: 
“Tam very glad to represent Hamilton Couuty in this meet- 
ing. When I took charge of the schools there two years ago 
we had no uniform system of text-books in the public schools. 
We have one now. 
“We have granted diplomas to five pupils in the public 
schools. The schools in Hamilton County are progressing very 
well. We held the first Normal Institute last July. 
“We have monthly meetings for both white and colored 
teachers. Our teachers are live and progressive, and improving 
in every sense of the word.”

W. R. LEIGH, of Haywood County, said: 
“Our schools are laboring under more disadvantages than 
probably any schools in any other county in the State. It has 
been impossible to get the County Court to increase the school 
tax. We have two populations there, and the one that is in 
the majority is the one that pays no taxes, or a very small por- 
tion of them. This creates dissatisfaction and an unwillingness 
on the part of the white people to pay taxes any longer in sup- 
port of the schools, as the colored people get most of the money. 
The white people absolutely refuse their sanction, and the opin- 
ion of the members of the County Court is against public schools 
in that county. The schools have improved. Two years ago 
they ran forty-nine days, and the terms average now nearly 
three months. My effort has been to secure an increase of sala- 
ries of teachers, and to make the money go further by decreas- 
ing the number of schools in the districts. This was necessary 
in order to get more money and to concentrate the money in 
certain central places. In that way we have managed to pay a 
little more to each teacher and to run the schools a little longer. 
The Institutes in Haywood County have become a success.” 
R. H. THORNE, of Henderson County, said: 
“JT have endeavored to discharge my duties as faithfully as I 
knew how. My county is a poor one, away from railroads and 
great water courses, and has not the advantages that many 
other counties have in the way of wealth and large and success- 
ful schools, but we are struggling honestly and faithfully to 
build up our school system, and I believe we are making some 
progress. I have visited a number of schools this year, and my 
report last year was perhaps the first one that has been made 
since the war. I have made my report again this year. We 
_ have had some very good schools. We had some young men 
    attending the Normal College in this city, and I sent one or two 
to the University at Knoxville. We are struggling every way 
we know of to build up the schools in our county. No mem-
-P-A-G-E-388
  Sere ay 
ae 
ber on this floor is more earnestly in favor of the public school 
system than I am, and I take this occasion to thank the State 
Superintendent for calling us together here.” 
GEO. T. GREGORY, of Humphreys County, said: 
“T have to say that while Humphreys County is not one of 
the wealthiest and largest counties in Tennessee, she is one of 
our medium-sized counties with some as productive soil as can 
be found in the State of Tennessee. She is famous for produc- 
ing more peauuts to the square acre, and more fat hogs than 
any other county that can be named. She is not behind in edu- 
cational matters. We have not all good schools. We must 
have some bad and some good things in this life. A seminary will 
open up at Waverly this coming January that promises to meet 
with good success. We have good high schools, and schools at 
various points in the county that are doing well. Some of them 
back in the rural districts are not doing as efficient work as we 
would like to see. I have come here to get all the information 
I can on the weak points in our work. The greatest difficulty 
with us is the small attendance. Some of the schools will start 
out pretty well and will continue this way for four or five weeks, 
when the attendance will commence to decrease. In addition 
to that we are troubled with lack of money. We do not have 
as long terms as we would like. This year the County Court 
thought they needed a new jail, and although I argued that 
schools were just as necessary, through the influence of the bar 
the jail was built. Our Institute work is not as good as I would 
like to have it. I can conscientiously say that our teachers are 
improving. We are always ready to do our best, and to show 
the work we have done.” 
J. W. SAYLOR, of Knox County, said: 
“The scholastic population of Knox County is about 19,000, 
and outside of the corporate limits of Knoxville we have 13,000. 
We have about 150 teachers and 130 schools, all of which are
-P-A-G-E-389
og 
thoroughly graded. We have new school houses throughout 
the county. I believe we have only one log school house in the 
county, and that is in a back district, and we are making ar- 
rangements to build another house in its place, and then all the 
houses will be large-and commodious. I think we are making 
some progress in Knox County, and we boast of it being the 
banner county in the State. We have worked earnestly for 
public schools and the public school system, and we have suc- 
ceeded in arousing a sentiment that is permeating the whole 
county. The school fund has been doubled in the last four 
years. This year we have had eight months’ school, nine 
months in some places and ten months in others. At the open- 
ing of our schools I furnish each pupil with blank reports, and 
one report is made to answer for the whole term. At the close 
of the school I furnish all the teachers with questions for final 
examination, representing the seven grades; also furnish them 
with other school literature and blanks. We have in Knox 
_ County the University of Tennessee, of which we are very 
proud. The colored schools are all graded, and are doing well.” 
MRS. R. H. WATKINS, of Lauderdale County, said: 
«“ Although our schools are not exactly as we would have 
them, I am glad to report great improvement. The first Insti- 
tute our county ever had was held last summer. There is great 
room for improvement in our schools. There is great lack of 
attendance. I would like to know if there is not something 
that can be done to keep up the interest in the schools.” 
J. W. McDANIEL, of Lincoln County, said: 
«J think the schools in Lincoln County have improved some 
in the last four years. They are not what they ought to be. I 
think the worst thing we have to contend with is the school- 
book question. We tried to get a uniform system, but the 
teachers would pay no attention to it except the colored teach- 
 ¢rs,and T think they ought to be commended. They would 
 
-P-A-G-E-390
  a 
_ have no other books except those we adopted. I think they 
have done much more work according to their chances than the 
white teachers. Another trouble with us is that we have to 
contend against all the leading men of Fayetteville. Ido not 
think there are more than two or three men in that place but 
what are opposed to public schools.” 
THOMAS H. DRAKE, of Madison County, said: 
“My efforts during the two years I have been in office have 
been directed, principally, in trying to secure an increase of the 
school fund, and to elevate the standard of qualification in 
teachers. I have succeeded in having our county appropriation 
doubled, and hope to maintain it; and we have a fund sufficient 
to run our schools about five months in the year, and in those 
districts that are favorably situated, geographically, we are able 
to run our schools eight or nine months in the year. Some of 
the members of our County Court who opposed a heavy taxation 
for school purposes have charged me with being somewhat arbi- 
trary and dictatorial in this matter, but I have not hesitated to 
use any honorable means to have the school fund increased. 
“JT made the first effort in our county last year that was ever 
made to organize a County Institute. We had an attendance - 
of sixty members. I have already seen throughout the county 
the good that resulted from that meeting. The outlook in my 
county is brighter for educational prospects.” 
J. U. TYLER, of Montgomery County, said:, 
“T think we have moved along in a satisfactory manner. We 
have some very zealous, earnest, efficient teachers who are doing 
good work for the cause of education; and, again, we have 
some that are not what they ought to be. Go off from the 
railroad, out in the country, and you will meet with the old log 
school house and crude method of teaching. 
“We have built during the past year nine new school houses,
-P-A-G-E-391
pO gt 
   and repaired and made comfortable those heretofore in use. In | 
many of these we have good seats and desks. 
“Our directors are earnest, efficient, and capable men, and I 
think they are beginning to realize the fact that we need wide- 
awake, first-class teachers. I have been censured by some for 
being too rigid in my examination. 
“Tn some of our country districts we run from eight to ten 
months, and in nearly all we run five months. 
“Our county, as far as school debts are concerned, is entirely 
free. Speaking candidly, the school interests in my county are 
improving.” 
S. D. UPTON, of Putnam County, said: 
“The first work done since I was elected Superintendent was 
the adoption of a uniform series of text-books for use in our 
public schools. Among many of the schools the books have 
been introduced and others have partially put them in use. 
The next work was to organize Institutes or training schools to 
improve our teachers. During the past two years I have held 
two Normal Institutes, aggregating seven weeks. . In addition 
to that I have organized a system of local or District Institutes 
in different parts of the county during the session of the schools. 
But the most prominent improvement in our county is the in- 
crease of the school fund. At the time of my election the 
county was divided into sixty-two districts and one hundred 
and eighty-six directors. We have reduced the number of 
directors to fifty-four and the districts to eighteen, making 
the number of civil and school districts identically the same. 
We have never had an Institute ,in the county; never had 
a teachers’ meeting, and there was but little interest taken 
in the advancement of the schools in our county. I am happy 
to say that we have grown some in grace since then. Con- 
siderable interest is now manifested by the directors, and a 
harder fight is being made among the teachers to excel each

    pe 
other in their respective schools. The school tax for the last 
few years, and as far back as I can remember, has never ex- 
ceeded 10 cents on the $100. Last January, in a pitched battle 
with the County Court, we got it raised to 25 cents, conse- 
quently we have had a longer school term. We have sixty odd 
schools in the county (more than we should have), but we are 
consolidating them as fast as possible. The high school facili- 
ties in Putnam are not so good. While our schools are not 
what they should be, they ure on. a high way of improvement, 
and I hope, as has been suggested by the State Superintendent, 
that they will become so efficient as to absorb all other institu- 
tions so far as the public school curriculum is concerned. 
J. E. RUFFIN, of Robertson County, said: 
“The public schools of Robertson County are slowly but 
surely improving from year to year. We have this year forty- 
eight public schools for white children, and eleven private 
schools in districts where they have not sufficient funds to hold » 
public schools for any length of time. We have also twenty- 
three public schools for colored children, making a total of 
seventy-one public schools in the county exclusive of the eleven 
already referred to. Three or four of these schools are graded 
asacademies. These run the year round. We are improving 
somewhat in school buildings and furniture. During the past 
year we built eight or nine new frame school houses, and these 
are well painted and furnished. I have to report, however, that 
there are a few houses in Robertson County yet that are a dis- 
grace to any civilized community. I held a Normal Institute 
of four weeks’ duration last June at Cedar Hill for the benefit 
mainly of young teachers, at which I was assisted by some of 
the best teachers in the county. It was attended regularly by 
about thirty young teachers. At its close we held a public ex- 
amination, and licensed twenty-five teachers. In the month of 
July I held a Normal Institute at Springfield for the benefit 
of the colored teachers. It lasted four weeks, and there were 
about twenty teachers licensed at the close of this. Our school
-P-A-G-E-393
  eel eect 
term averages about four months. The greatest hinderance we 
haye to the public schools is the shortness of the term. The 
children go to school three or four months one fall, and learn so 
much, and the next fall they start again about where they left 
off. The teachers in our county are mostly natives. We have 
had to borrow only a few teachers from other counties. An- 
other hinderance is the great diversity we have in text-books. 
There is no uniformity there in text-books. Another hinder- 
ance is, we have too many school districts. We have eighteen 
civil districts and twenty-nine school districts, and in some of 
these the scholastic population is only forty or fifty. We have 
sent four pupils to Tennessee University at Knoxville. Our 
schools are greatly improved, and if our County Court had 
backbone enough to double the tax we have now our schools 
could run eight months in the year.” 
J. D. NELSON, of Rutherford County, said: 
“ Our schools are in a good condition. We held very success- 
ful Institutes this summer. We had a County Institute for the 
white teachers, at which there was a regular attendance of about 
sixty, and then we had an Institute for the colored teachers. 
We have sixteen graded schools in Rutherford County outside 
of Murfreesboro.” 
JOHN E. DEAKINS, of Sequatchie County, said: 
‘“T have been trying to serve the people of the little county I 
represent for the past ten years. We have fifteen schools, all 
white. Some of them are good, and some are like some of our 
teachers, worthless. All men cannot teach school, because they 
are not adapted to the art of teaching. Our county is in a bet- 
ter condition now than at any time during the past ten years. 
At New Hope we have a splendid academy, and also at Dunlap 
we have a good high school.”

  W. L. HENDERSON, of Shelby County, said: 
“The public schools in Shelby County are on a boom. The 
citizens throughout the county are deeply interested in educa- 
tion. This interest has been aroused through the institutes that 
T have held throughout the county, and as we have many towns 
in the county that could accommodate the people they would 
flock there to see what was being done. I had educators who 
understood the work to assist me, and they talked to these peo- 
ple and interested them in school work. Knowing that we 
could not accomplish anything without money, our idea was to 
get the school fund increased. I went before the County Court 
and got them to vote just double the amount that they had been 
appropriating before. We have been running our schools about 
one hundred days, and after the first of January we think we 
ean have continuous schools. Our public school system is so 
popular that, although we have several chartered towns in the 
county, we have only one place where there are chartered 
schools, and that is Memphis. Some of our schools are incor- 
porated. I do not suppose there is a county in the State where 
there is more enthusiasm in educational work than Shelby 
County. We held a County Institute for white teachers, and 
there were over one hundred in attendance. We also held a 
colored institute. I am proud to say that there is not a second 
grade teacher in the county. 
RICHARD FRANKLIN, of Trousdale County, said: 
“Our scholastic population is 2,100. I have been superinten- 
dent for two years. There has been some improvement in that 
time, but there is still room for improvement. Our school 
property is not such as it should be. I have visited the schools 
from time to time, and have interviewed the directors, and this ~ 
year there has been a marked improvement. We have too 
many schools, and when that is the case it does not do the chil- 
dren or teachers justice. I am endeavoring to have this rem- 
edied, and think I will succeed at the next meeting of the 
County Court.

W. T. DAVIS, of Weakley County, said: 
“T have the honor to represent 12,612 children of the Weakley 
County of the State, and at the same time I have the honor of 
tipping the beam at 207 pounds avoidupois. I am here as the ~ 
representative of the common school interest of my county. 
The majority of the Superintendents in this Convention have 
had more to say in the way of boasting of their colleges than 
any thing else. I fear my brethren have not been out in the 
brush to look after the little fellows. They boast of sending 
their sons off to college; but we are going to educate our chil- 
dren in the common schools of the country, and we are going 
to uphold the common schools in Weakley County until they 
shall be called the best schools in the State. The best schools 
there now are the public schools. The school at Martin is a pub- 
lic school, and it runs ten months every year, and excels any 
school in Weakley County. We are here to work in the interest 
of the children of the country. 
“The schools in my county are on an upward tendency, and 
we have a sufficient amount of money to run them eight months 
in every year.” 
W. N. BILLINGSLY, of White County, said: 
“Tam proud to represent the grand old county of White in 
- this Convention. We have a scholastic population of 5,057. 
The Normal Institute held in White County last summer did a 
great deal to arouse interest in our schools. There were one 
hundred and ten teachers in attendance. 
“We have built twelve new school houses in the county, two 
brick and ten frame, most of them well furnished and neatly 
painted, and all in good order. We have had the school tax 
raised from ten cents to fifteen cents. We have a uniform series 
of text-books. 
“Our schools lasted eighty days this year on au average, eight       
 
-P-A-G-E-396
    Bop 
  days longer, I believe, than ever before. Taking the schools as 
a whole they are progressing well. We have some school 
houses and some schools that are almost worthless, but the out- 
look is brighter than at any time in the past.” 
R. $8. BALLOW, of Williamson County, said: 
“Tam proud to be here to-day to say for Williamson County 
that her schools are in 25 per cent. better condition than they 
ever were before. We increased our school average last year 
nearly 2,000. I am certain I am correct when I say that the 
schools of our county have grown more in every particular in 
the last six years than ever before. Altogether, we have a 
good prospect for the future.” 
J. J. BAIRD, of Wilson County, said: 
“Our schools are in a better condition than they were ever 
before known to be. We have better teachers and better at- 
tendance. Our directors take more interest. Our County Court 
is becoming enthused on the subject of education. The attend- 
ance at the normal and county institutes is better.”

-P-A-G-E-398
      WORK OF COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS. 
Your undersigned Committee on Work of County Superintendents beg leave to 
report the following: 
Recognizing the great importance of the work of County Superintendents, and 
the inestimable benefits to be derived from it, and knowing that the State demands 
the very best work,*the interests of the children demand it, society demands that 
the youth of the State be properly trained, mentally, morally, and physically, and 
believing that more thorough county.supervision is needed in many parts of the 
State, we recommend, 
First—That County Superintendents study closely the school Jaw, and strictly, 
carefully, and diligently perform all their duties as therein expressed. 
Second—They should visit each school in the county at least once during the 
year, inspecting and observing closely the work of the teachers and pupils, and, 
when necessary, point out defects and make suggestions privately in methods of 
teaching and school government, instruct Directors in their duties, and endeavor to 
create in the minds of the people a greater interest in the public schools of their 
respective counties. 
Third—They should move continuously among the schools, teachers, pupils, and 
parents in thorough sympathy with them and with their work, animating the 
despondent, stimulating the slow, enlightening the inexperienced, showing this one 
how to manage, that one how to teach, cheering skill by kind encouragement, aid- 
ing uncertainty with wise advice, infusing new life, bringing order out of whatever 
confusion may exist, and molding the various elements under their influence into 
one accordant and harmoniously working whole. 
Fourth—They should do all in their power to encourage Teachers’ Institutes and 
reading circles by organizing and holding them at least monthly in various parts 
of the county, and should procure State Normal Institutes as often as possible, 
and should hold County Normal Institutes from one to four weeks between the 
middle of June and the first of August, and see that the teachers attend all of 
these meetings. 
Fifith—They should call meetings of the Directors and advise with them as to 
the promotion of the school interests, iustruct and encourage them in their work, 
_ and ag far as possible organize them into a general Board of Education, whose 
duties it shall be to adopt a uniformity of text-books, a graded course of study, and 
~ 8ee that they are enforced. They should visit the patrons and urge them to send 
their children to school, showing them that they cannot afford to let their children 
grow up in idleness and ignorance without even the rudiments of a common school 
education 
S—APP, 8. 8. P. L.
-P-A-G-E-399
  ae 
Sixth—They should make publie speeches, and urge the people generally to a 
lively interest in educational affairs, and as far as practicable visit the schools of 
any particular district in company with the Directors of that district; they should 
consult with the Directors whenever difficulties or disturbances arise, and lend 
their aid to settle these troubles, they must be ready to give their views as to the 
establishment of schools and the location of school houses, they should urge 
District Directors to build good school houses and furnish them with improved 
school furniture and other school apparatus. 
Seventh—In brief, they must visit the schools, visit the patrons, advise with the 
Directors, hold Institutes, pass upon the merits of text-books, maps, globes, and 
other apparatus, hold examination of teachers, and issue certificates to the qual- 
ified applicants only, require them to make monthly reports to the County Super- 
intendent, who shall furnish blanks for this purpose, issue circulars, address the 
people, write for the press, make and publish reports, and mightily awaken and 
quicken the public mind on educational subjects. 
By their influence and efforts districts must be consolidated, schools gra ed, 
superior teachers employed, courses of study perfected, controversies settled, 
school houses built and furnished, and the whole aspect of affairs changed for the 
better; in fact, every thing practicable must be done to elevate and improve the 
schools. W. N. Biiuinesty, Chairman,

The Association met at 9 o’clock a. M., President Fuqua in 
the chair. 
J. 8. White, Chairman of the Committee on Mode of Ex- 
amining and Licensing Teachers, and their Necessary Qualifica- 
tions, submitted a report consisting of six sections: ‘The fol- 
lowing was the only one adopted: 
  REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON MODE OF EXAMINING AND LICENSING 
TEACHERS. 
Inasmuch as four-fifths or mere of the teachers in the rural district schools in 
this State are mere apprentices in the business of teaching, and inasmuch as tact 
in government and skill in the work of instruction is as much needed by the 
teachers as literary and scientific attainments, therefore, it is the sense of this 
Committee: 
First—Vhat successive written examination should be required and so directed 
as to induce improvement in the knowledge of the required branches as well as in 
the art of teaching, and that certificates issued to teachers should be for gne year, 
and should all bear the date of close of an Annual Institute for both white and 
colored.

  DR. YOUNG'S ADDRESS. 
“Mr. Prestpent: I suppose, sir, that you do not know the 
object of my coming to the Senate Chamber this morning. I 
came to ask the Convention to excuse me. That was the only 
thing I came for, and I will give you the reason for it. Some - 
months ago my friend Ray asked me to address an assembly 
here in the month of December, but I confess to you that I 
mistook the character of the assembly. In other words, I mis- 
took the gravity of the occasion when I made the promise. 
This is a Convention of scholars, and I am not a scholar. This 
“is a Convention of educators, and Iam not an educator. There- 
fore I should be very grateful this morning if you would just - 
proceed with the objects of your Convention and excuse me 
from making an address.” 
State Superintendent Smith—* Mr. President, I move that we 
do not excuse him.” Carried. 
Dr. Young—“ Well, gentlemen of the Convention, I never 
knew but two men in my life that could make a better speech 
without preparation than with preparation. One was a clergy- 
man, and the other wasa lawyer. The lawyer is still living, 
and the clergyman is dead. 
“ Of all the countries on the face of the earth I think we are 
living in the country where the children and the youth onght 
to be educated, for I am very well satisfied, indeed, that North 
America is the best grand division upon the face of the earth. 
It has been my fortune or misfortune one to see all these grand 
divisions, and I am very well satisfied that we are on the best 
side of the Atlantic. 
“ Please to look at the coast of North America. It is the 
largest and longest indented sea coast of any grand division on 
the face of the earth, and you will notice that all these grand 
divisions of the earth that have the best indented sea coast have 
reached the highest point of civilization and the highest culti- _
-P-A-G-E-402
    ee eas 
vation. Africa has scarcely any indented sea coast, conse- 
quently a low civilization and a low state of culture. South 
America comes next in the comparison; Asia comes next and 
Europe next, and we have the most prominent sea coast on the 
face of the earth. ‘ 
“T am very well satisfied, indeed, that the United States is 
the best part of North America. Since the Norman conquest 
England has been the great wealth-producing country of the 
world until the year 1870. From the year 1870 to 1880 the 
United States surpassed the mother country twenty-five mil- 
lions in the production of wealth, and of course this is one of | 
the factors in a high state of civilization and high state of re- 
finement. 
“Tam very well satisfied, indeed, that Tennessee is the garden 
spot of the United States. I remember that one of our early 
common school histories, produced by a man that had traveled 
all over the world, had seen everybody and knew everything, 
said that the climate of East Tennessee was the most desirable 
inthe world. I met the celebrated Dr. Durbin on his return 
from the East, and asked him where he had rather live than 
any other place on the face of the earth, and he promptly 
responded, ‘Nashville, Tennessee.’ So, gentlemen, you are 
holding your Convention in the garden spot and center of 
the world. [Applause.] 
“Now, if North America is the best grand division, and the 
United States is the best part of North America, and Tennessee 
is the most desirable place on the face of the earth, why, you 
are deliberating for the education of the youth in the garden 
spot and centre of the world. 
“TI do not know of any subject that would interest a foreign 
audience more than two or three things that I shall now men- 
tion toyou. Ihave tried it on several small companies of men 
_ that could understand my language in any of the nations of the 
world, and the most astonishing things I could tell them were 
the following: In other words I will describe the company on
-P-A-G-E-403
  SR 
one occasion, and you can imagine how many times I could call 
such a company as that together. I was walking from the 
House of Parliament once, down the Thames embankment, and 
just as I approached the obelisk, Cleopatra’s needle, there came 
a shower of rain, which, I might say, is very common to that 
climate, and I took shelter there; and directly quite a company 
of plain people took shelter in the same place, as none of us 
had umbrellas, and, seeing that I was a foreigner, they began to 
ask me about my country. The most astonishing thing I could 
mention to them was the space a poor man had to live on in 
this country. When I described the home of a poor man in 
the United States I limited it to two hundred acres, and then I 
described his dwelling house, and his outhouses, and his stock, 
and other appurtenances, and they absolutely wondered if I was 
describing a dukedom, and were surprised that there was a 
country on the face of the earth where the people had so much 
space to live. That was in a country where the population is 
five hundred to the square mile. The preachers and missionary 
speakers have gone about over the country describing China as 
the most heavily populated country in the world. Take the 
area of China and you have one hundred and eighty-five to the 
square mile, but if you tuke the area of the British Isles, the 
population, including the city of London, will average five 
hundred to the square mile. Think of our mother country 
with five hundred people to the square mile! What an aston- 
ishing thing it is to the average man there to tell him of the 
space we have to live in in this country! 
“The next most astonishin thing I could tell them was that 
we had fuel over here to keep our families warm, and our chil- 
dren warm while they were studying. I showed them that I 
lived in a country where every man in the station of a daily 
laborer had fuel enough to warm every room in his house. A 
serious question in those heavily populated countries (I do not 
mean England now), is fuel to keep one’s family comfortable. 
I recollect when I landed at the Mediterranean Hotel in the 
city of Jerusalem, the first thing I said to my courier was to 
order a rousing fire. It had been raining that day. Courier: 
brought up some fuel just like that described in the Scriptures.
-P-A-G-E-404
  39s 
I thought he had only brought the kindling. I found that I 
was in a country where fuel had been exhausted for years and 
years. 
“The next astonishing thing I told them was that I lived in 
a country where families could have meals three times a day. 
Whoever thought of having meals three times a day in that 
country. 
“An old country looks old, and an old population looks like 
an old population, and a man feels like, when he gets in their 
way, brushing them aside like egg-shells and spiders, Now, in 
a country like this, with all its promises and possibilities, it 
would be an unpardonable sin not to educate and feyiee to 
the highest civilization our posterity. 
“Stranger, stay thee, and the scene 
Around contemplate well, and 
If, perchance, thy home salute 
Thee with a father’s honored 
Name, go tell them what a 
Debt they owe to their ancestors. 
“The people of this country belong to the very best blood in 
the world, also we are the descendants of the English, the best 
blood in the world. If you will carry yourselves back in 
imagination two thousand years in the British Isles, you will 
find them inhabited by a savage race, the descendants of the 
Celts and Ancient Britains. So begin with that fifty-four years 
before the year of our Lord, Cesar and his Romans came in 
and held that country for about four hundred and ninety-nine 
years, and it would be impossible for a dominant people to hold 
such a country as that for five hundred years, more or less, with- 
out leaving a very large infusion of blood. So you have,asa 
basis, the ardent and restless Celt who, when he gets to heaven 
and looks around, will wonder after awhile if there is not some 
land further West where his ardent and restless soul may find 
satisfaction than there. This infusion of blood, left by the Ro- 
mans, was from a law-making and governing people. Four 
hundred and ninety-nine years after the coming of Christ there 
   
-P-A-G-E-405
  nape oC 
came to that country a race of people—a home-loving, wife- 
loving, children-loving race. In 1066 William the Conqueror 
and his Normans came in—a cultivated people, a reflective peo- 
ple. The highest class of people in England to-day boast that 
there is not a drop of Anglo-Saxon blood in them, but that 
they are the descendants of William the Conqueror. What a 
fine mixture of blood this is. The ardor of the Celt, the cour- 
age of the Roman, the domestic virtues of the Saxon, and the 
high contemplative trait of the Norman. We are of the best 
blood in the world., No question about that. 
“T mention this as another reason why the children of ihis 
country should be educated. The possibilities are so great that 
they will be something and do something in the world of life 
and in the world of thought. So I would encourage you in 
this respect in the work of education. Then we are the de- 
scendants of, I will not say the best colony that settled over 
here. I have read Neal’s history of the Puritans. It is the 
history of grand old heroes, but you must permit me to refer 
particularly to the character and virtues of the colony that set- 
tled at Jamestown, Va., as we are educating in the Southern 
States. The colony that came over in 1607, thirteen years be- 
fore the Mayflower landed at Plymouth Rock—you remember 
when they landed. The very first thing that was done they 
went ashore, and the Rev. Robert Hunt administered the holy 
communion to the entire company. You will remember that 
one of the first houses they built was a church, which they dec- 
orated with wild flowers of the country. You will remember 
that one Rolph fell in love with Pocahontas, but was not al- 
lowed to marry her until she was christianized and baptized 
with water dipped out of a fount made of the trunk of a tree. 
We are living in that part of the country which was settled by 
a colony that had some traits of character that I like better 
than the Plymouth Rock colony, with all the heroic virtues of 
those Puritans. Our country was settled, I think, at the exact 
time after the invention of printing and after the reformation. 
I have often wondered what such a large country as this would 
have been if it had been settled before these two epochs. I 
faney it would have been very much like New Mexico. New
-P-A-G-E-406
  ir oe 
Mexico may be described about thus: Adam concluded once 
upon a time that he would revisit the earth, so the story goes, 
and he came to the British Isles, and looking upon that heavily 
populated country, with its busy industries and toiling millions, 
shook his head and said: ‘This is not my country.’ So he 
eame over to the United States and looked at the splendid cities 
and temples, the railroads and civilization of our country, and 
shook his head again and said, ‘ This is not my country,’ but 
when he went over to Mexico he just took off his broad- 
brimmed hat and said: ‘This is my country. It is just as I 
left it 6,000 years ago.’ [Laughter.] Now, I take it for granted 
that if this country had been settled before the two epochs I 
referred to awhile ago it would have presented the appearance 
of New Mexico. 
«We have the best language for the expression of thought 
in the world. Celtic, Latin, Anglo-Saxon, Norman, French, 
and an infusion from a few of the other languages, give to us 
the power of expressing thought better than any other people 
on the face of the earth. So I just simply mention to you that 
of all the countries upon the face of the earth where the pos- 
terity should be educated, and where education promises so 
much, it is this country, just where we are in the United States 
of America. It is a country so vigorous that we plan and 
execute, and we execute so soon after we plan that we are the 
astonishment of the nations abroad. 
“Tt does not occur to the nations that live on the other side 
of the sea that there is any country comparable to this for its 
wealth and power. Why, they take it for granted that every 
traveler from this country leaves a California gold mine at 
home. This is so rich and prosperous a country they treat you 
in that way. 
“Now, gentlemen, if you please, as I did mistake the char- 
acter of the assembly and the gravity of the occasion, as you 
area company of scholars and educators, met here for the pur- 
pose of deliberating with a view to the prosperity of the schools 
of Tennessee, I beg that you will excuse me, that I may not

Educate the epties of this country, and you do great ones 
for the human race.” [Applause.] 
Prof. Goodman moved that a vote of thanks be tendered Dr. 
‘Young for his able and interesting address, which was carried 
unanimously. 
Superintendent Glenn, President of the State Teachers’ As- 
sociation of Kentucky, was introduced, and spoke substantially 
as follows: 
‘“‘GENTLEMEN—I live one hundred and seven miles north of 
the center spot of creation [laughter], or the garden spot, as 
Dr. Young called it. I had been under the impression that I 
lived just in the center, but one hundred and seven miles, when 
it comes to the size of this earth of ours, is near enough. I 
am glad that I live so near here as I do, and am glad to be here 
on this oceasion. I am not here for the purpose of talking. I 
fecl that there is business of greater importance than simply 
listening to what I have to say. I live in an adjoining State— 
we are all one people. My heart is in the cause of education. I 
am also editor of a paper which I call The Hustler. That may 
seem a strange name to you for a newspaper, but it is the best 
paper published in Hopkins County, and it is the only paper 
published there. Now, I am not here for the purpose of ad- 
vertising my paper, but I believe in hustling for subscribers and 
job work, and as Superintendent I believe in hustling out in the 
county and looking after the schools that are scattered over my 
county. I believe in boys and girls hustling to get an educa- 
tion. I believe in all classes hustling. I am glad to be able to- 
day to meet so many of those who are engaged in the same 
noble work. I feel an interest in the education of the seven 
hundred thousand boys and girls in the State of Kentucky. 
You, of course, feel an interest in the education of the half 
million or more in your own State, and we all feel a common 
- interest in the education of the fifteen million boys and girls in 
the United States. The wife of Scipio, who had many offers of 
marriage but refused all of them because she had two boys to.

educate, was once visited by a nobleman who asked her to show 
him some of her rare gifts of jewels that had been presented to 
her, and especially those she admired the most. She retired 
into an ante-chamber and presently returned with her two boys 
and said to the nobleman: ‘These are my jewels.’ The seven 
hundred thousand boys and girls of my State are jewels more 
precious than any of the gems that ever bedecked the crowns 
of royalty. 
‘ 
“T understand the National Teachers’ Association is to meet 
at this place next year. I was glad when I heard it, and I pro- 
pose that Kentucky shall furnish quite a large number of dele- 
gates to that meeting, especially my county. I propose to 
bring thirty-five or forty of my teachers here to show you 
what kind of material we have in Hopkins County.” 
Superintendent Zuccarello, of Giles County, moved that a 
vote of thanks be tendered Prof. Glenn for his able address, 
which was agreed to unanimously. 
Dr. Chas. W. Dabney, Jr., of Knoxville, Chairman of the 
Committee on University of Tennessee, presented the following 
report: 
REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON THE UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE. 
Your committee are glad to be able to report that there has been a great improve- 
ment since the last meeting of this Convention in the matter of the examination 
and appointment of young men to scholarships at the University of Tennessee. 
There is still, however, much misunderstanding on this subject and need of atten- 
tion on the part of County and City Superintendents, and of Senators and Repre- 
sentatives, to their duty in this matter. Under the law and the contract between 
the State and the University, that institution must give free tuition to two hundred 
and seventy-five students from Tennessee, to be admitted according to regulations, 
as to preparation, age, etc., to be made by the Board of Trustees of the University. 
Applicants for these scholarships must report to their City and County Superin-_ 
tendents in June of each year, or at other times, if the Representative or Senator 
request it, and be examined according to rules sent out by the State Superintend- 
ent. The candidates who pass are listed in the order of merit, aud these lists are 
forwarded to the State Superintendent, who lays them hefore the Representative 
and Senator for that county. From these lists each Senator can appoint two and 
each Representative three students to free scholarships. This was the apportion- 
ment made when the law was passed (in 1869). But it should be changed now so
-P-A-G-E-409
  Sag. 
as to distribute the two hundred and seventy-five appointments among one hundred 
and thirty-two Senators and Representatives of the present time. Provision is 
made in the law for all who are properly prepared and want the places up to the 
full number. After the 10th of August of each year the President of the University 
is authorized to appoint the young men recommended by Superintendents and re- 
maining on the lists after the Representatives and Senators have made their ap- 
pointments, to the vacancies still existing in other counties. These appointments 
are good only for one year, but may be renewed from year to year if vacancies 
continue to be found for them in any counties. On this account Cuunty and City 
Superintendents should encourage all young men to try to pass the examinations, 
even if the quota for their counties are filled. ,They can all get appointments 
until the full number (two hundred and seventy-five) is reached. 
Senators and Representatives can appoint young men at other times, if the 
“vacancies continue to exist, but they should have their men examined first by the 
Superintendent of the county. 
a 
We find there has been much irregularity and disobedience of the law in this 
regard. It was probably misunderstood. We advise Superintendents to give care- 
ful attention to the law and the instructions regarding this matter sent out by the 
State Superintendent and the University authorities. They will be notified in May 
each year and receive blank lists. 
The young man who receives such an appointment is entitled to free tuition at 
the University until he completes his course. This saves him sixty dollars a year, 
and secures him other advantages which cannot be reckoned in money. With 
such an appointment the expenses of a student at the University will amount to 
one hundred and eighty-six dollars for a session of ten months boarding at a 
boarding house, or one hundred and thirty-six dollars per sessior boarding in the 
students’ mess. These figures include two suits of uniform and the average cost 
of fuel, lights, washing, books, and all necessary expenses. Many opportunities 
are offered students to earn, by work in the shops, on the grounds, or on the farm, 
something to aid them. Students have earned from a few dollars to one hundred 
and fifty dollars a session, besides attending to all their classes and other duties. 
We believe, however, that it is best for every young man to have at least fifty dollars 
at his command for the first term. 
Examinations for admission and classification are held at the University during 
the three days preceding the opening of each term—that is, beginning the first 
Monday in September and the last Monday in January. These examinations will 
be thorough, and Superintendents should be careful that they do not send students 
up who are not prepared. The University has no preparatory department at 
present. ‘If they cannot enter the lowest class provided, they will have to return 
home. We believe that the University is not intended to do the work of the 
common schools and the high schools, and that it should not take students until 
they have gotten all which these lower schools can do for them. 
This committee are pleased to be able to testify that the Superintendents who
-P-A-G-E-410
          
fora e Te 
attended this Convention last year did their duty well. That Convention did the 
attendance at the University more good than any thing which has happened in the 
State during the year. 
We find that the following improvements have been made at the University dur- 
ing the past year: 
A new Faculty has been organized, consisting of a President, Dean, and Com- 
mandant, with nine full professors of Ancient Languages, Mathematics, English 
and Modern Languages, Chemistry, Physics and Mechanics, Agricultural Chemis- 
try, Botany, Agriculture and Military Science (an officer detailed from the United 
States Army), and three associate professors of Engineering (an officer detailed 
from the United States Navy), English Literature and History, and Mathematics, 
with six assistant professors and instructors—eighteen in all. A new building for 
the Mechanical Department has been erected and equipped with tools and machin- 
ery. Another new building has been erected for the laboratories of Botany, Biol- 
ogy, Agricultural Chemistry, and for Agriculture. The microscopes and apparatus 
for these laboratories were bought by a representative of the University in Harope. 
Large additions have been made to the library in the Department of Sciences. A 
splendid collection of Southern plants, that made by the distinguished Botanist, 
Dr. Gattinger, of Nashville, and many other natural history specimens have been 
acquired by the University. 
The enrollment the present session has reached the number of two hundred and 
four already. This is fully eighty more than were present at this time last year. 
The Freshman Class numbers ninety-three. One nundred and eighty-nine students 
are from Tennessee, and one hundred and eighty-eight of them are free State 
students. The fifteen other students are from Iowa, Dakota, Ohio, Kentucky, 
Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas, 
The following County and City Superintendents have examined and recommended 
students who are attending the University this year: 
Cleveland, Bradley County, 1; Carroll, 1; Davidson, 2; Fayette, 1; Giles, 4; 
Hamilton, 10; Haywood, 1; Henderson, 1; Jefferson, 4; Knox County Superin- 
tendent, 60; Knoxville City Superintendent, 10; Roane, 3; Rutherford, 3; Shelby, 
3; Anderson, 2; Fentress, 2; White, 2; James, 1; Montgomery, 1; appointed by 
the State Superintendent, 6. 
A few other Superintendents did their duty faithfully under the law, but failed to 
get any candidates. Still others examined and recommended young men who 
were, for various reasons, prevented from getting to the University this term. 
Only nineteen County and City Superintendents have sent students to the Uni- 
yersity. The other seventy-five or eighty appear to have done nothing at all, 
although fully instructed by the State Superintendent. 
Superintendents should understand that this is as much a part of their official 
duty as any thing else they have to do. These scholarships are waiting for your 
young men, and the law you are pledged to obey makes it your duty to inform
-P-A-G-E-411
    4G 
them of it, and help them to get these places. Total neglect of this duty should 
be considered a serious dereliction. 
The report of the State Superintendent will show the vacancies in counties and 
districts. Fifty-six Representatives have failed to appoint any at all, and twenty 
Senators have made no appointments. All these officers are earnestly sought and 
urged to inform themselves about their duty in this respect, and perform it faith- 
fully. They will thus, as we believe, bring a great blessing upon the young men of 
their counties and districts. 
Respectfully submitted, Cuas. W. Dazyey, Jr., 
W. BR. Letcu, 
J. W. Dugean. 
State Superintendent Smith asked Dr. Dabney if the Uni- 
versity admitted pupils who have completed the public school 
course and have a certificate of qualification showing such to 
be the fact. 
Dr. Dabney said: 
“The law says that the State Superintendent shall instruct 
the County Superintendents about these examinations, and I 
suppose that will be done next May, in circulars. In the mean- 
time we are making improvements at the University, and want 
to put the University in the reach of the best students from the 
common schools and high schools, but it ought not to under- 
take to do the work that these schools can do themselves. The 
faculty are determined to use a certain amount of discretion. 
In cases where there are high schools and graded schools in 
town we are*going to apply some common sense. We intend 
that the boys who belong to the high schools and graded schools 
of the town shall stay there until they graduate. We want 
country boys who have successfully passed through the com- 
mon school course.” 
Superintendent W. A. Haynes, of Sumner County, said that 
he had made one hundred and eight speeches since they met 
here last, and that he mentioned the University in those one 
  hundred and eight speeches. He was aware of the importance 
of the, University, and was glad that the meeting last year had 
 
-P-A-G-E-412
  ae 
done it so much good. He would know better how to speak 
hereafter. 
Superintendent Ruffin, of Robertson County, asked Dr. Dab- 
ney if applicants who receive their appointment from Senators 
and Representatives had to be examined by the County Super- 
intendent. 
Dr. Dabney replied: ‘ 
“Tt certainly ought to be done. The law requires it to be 
done at any time they are cal ed upon by the Senator or Repre- 
sentative. If the student has not been examined before he 
comes to the University we will examine him, and it may be 
that he will be thrown out and have to be sent home.” 
Prof. Kent, of the University, said they intended to get out, 
before another year, a full set of examination questions which 
will be sent, through the kindness of the State Superintendent, 
to all of the County Superintendents, so they will be able to see 
ata glance what pitch of requirement a young man will have to 
attain to enter the University. We do not want to compete 
with the primary schools, consequently we have no preparatory 
department. We must work in perfect harmony with the pri- 
mary schools, and we think we ought to get the very best young 
men from those schools. 
Superintendent McCorkle, of Dyer County, said that when 
the time came for him to advertise for applicants to the Uni- 
versity he did so. One young man talked about standing the 
examination but did not do so because, upon interviewing the ~ 
Representative of the county, he was told that he could get an 
appointment from the Representative without standing an ex- 
amination. 
Dr. Dabney—< That is just what has been the matter hereto- 
fore. In our Charter we have authority to make rules and 
conditions for admittance to the University.” If the County 
Superintendents will stand up to us in this matter we will stand
-P-A-G-E-413
  as 
by them. Young men will have to pass a final examination at 
the University before they are admitted. When an applicant — 
has been examined and the papers sent to us, we will correspond 
with the Superintendent and indicate to him what will probably 
be the result of such examination before the applicant is sent 
to Knoxville. We did not reject a single young man this year 
that was examined by the County Superintendents.” 
Capt. C. 8. Douglas, Chairman of the Committee on How 
to Increase Interest in Public Schools, submitted a report, and 
spoke as follows: 
“At some school houses the superintendent will find about a 
dozen to hear him speak. In some districts the directors will 
visit the school once in two years. The fathers and mothers, 
although they love their clrildren tenderly, will take more care 
of the spotted calf than they will of John or Mary. I mean 
educationally. I want you to take this report and consider it 
‘carefully, and give us all the light on it you can. I know there 
is not a Superintendent, who travels the hills and valleys of his 
county, who does not feel almost despaired at the want of in- 
terest taken in the schools by his people. The foundation stone 
to this is a live and active Superintendent, one who does not fear 
to do his duty. As the State Superintendent says, you must 
study the law and then execute it. I am satisfied that the meet- 
ing held here twelve months ago has created an impetus that 
has done good in every county in the State. When you return 
to your respective homes do not be afraid to discharge the du- 
ties incumbent upon you.” 
The following report was then adopted : 
HOW TO INCREASE INTEREST IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 
Your committee appointed to suggest the best means of increasing the interest 
in public schools beg leave to submit the following: 
_ > Recognizing the vast importance of this question, and the absolute necessity of 
taking some steps toward accomplishing this good work, we would most respect- 
fully suggest as,
-P-A-G-E-414
  = Ages 
First—And as an essential requisite, the increase of the school fund, which, of 
course, gives us a longer session, thereby assuring time to build up a greater inter- 
est among both the parent and the pupil. Hence, we would strongly recommend 
that the public school officers would lend their best efforts toward increasing the 
school tax of the county. 
Second—That every effort should be made to secure a live and thoroughly active 
_ Superintendent, who shall be paid a sufficient salary to give his entire time to his 
work, and “knowing his duty dares to do it,” and that Directors be the best qualified 
men that can be secured for the position. 
; _Third—We recommend a stricter examination of teachers, and the employment 
of only those whose experience and competency will insure confidence on the part 
of the patrons. 
Fourth—The organization of a County Board, consisting of the Superintendent. 
and all of the Directors, who shall meet at least twice a year and thoroughly in- 
vestigate the school affairs of their respective counties, and that each Director 
be allowed one dollar for his attendance. 
Fifth—That the visits of the Superintendent and Directors be made as often as 
possible to their schools, more especially to those conducted by young and inexpe- 
rienced teachers. 
Sixth—That the Superintendent visit his people as often as possible, confer with 
the Directors, and speak to them upon school affairs. 
Seventh—That we do earnestly recommend the adoption of a uniform system of 
text-books, and, when space will allow, by all means suggest that the schools be 
graded. 
Eighth—And lastly, we do believe that our County Superintendents ought to study 
and comply strictly with the law, and see that the same is done by their subordinates, 
law and order being the especial essentials that characterize a deep interest and a 
thorough success. C. §. Dovenas,

AFTERNOON SESSION. 
The Association met pursuant to adjournment, President Fu- 
qua in the chair. 
State Superintendent Smith asked the Association to hear 
Capt. W. R. Garrett, of the Local Executive Committee of the 
National Educational Association, at 8 o’clock to-morrow af- 
ternoon. Agreed to. 
Capt. Douglas offered a resolution, which was unanimously 
adopted. (See Resolution No. 8, in report of Committee on 
Resolutions, page 71.) 
Prof. John L. Lampson, of the Peabody Normal College, 
Chairman of the Committee on English in the Public Schools, 
submitted the report following. 
Prof. Chas. Kent, of the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, 
delivered an eloquent address in favor of the adoption of the 
report. 5 
On motion of Supt. Saylor, of Knox County, the report was 
adopted unanimously. 
The following is the report of the Committee: 
ENGLISH. 
Within the last fifteen years wonderful progress has been made in teaching the 
“common school branches, and in no particular has more advance been made than 
in teaching our mother tongue. 
The best instructors everywhere have almost revolutionized their methods. We 
now teach good English from the first day in school till the last. He is taught to 
speak correctly and to unite correctly in all his work. To teach a correct use of 
(50)
-P-A-G-E-416
  i 
English we do not now wait for technical rules and formal grammar. Ideas are 
taught, and with ideas the correct expression of the thought. 
The teacher of elementary English in the past met many difficulties. In the 
first place, it was thought that a good use of English could be taught only through 
some system of formal grammar. No attention was, therefore, given to language 
till the child reached sufficient maturity to study technical grammar. The result 
was that incorrect habits of speech were contracted which were not broken up 
even in the study of formal grammar. Pupils would commit the grammar to 
memory, parse all the sentences, repeat the rules of syntax from I to XLIX, and 
still write extremely bad English. 
Our writers of elementary text-books for teaching English have at last suc- 
ceeded. The language lessons and practical grammars of the present day are 
on the right line. They give much practice and only so much theory as will ena- 
ble the child to know when he is practicing correctly. 
When Demosthenes was asked for the first secret of successful oratory, he an- 
swered, “action!’’ When asked for the second, he said again, “action!” When — 
asked for the third he still replied, “action!” If a teacher asks for our plan of 
teaching, successfully, good English, the answer is practice! practice!! practice!!! 
Now, it is not meant in this report to undervalue technical grammar. Grammar 
is the science of language. It is all-important. It records the laws of language, 
and must be the teacher’s guide. It has its place even in a common school course 
of study. The trouble is that teachers so often fail to get it into its right place. 
The failure to properly place the study of technical grammar in the common 
school course arises from the teacher’s ignorance of the conditions of mental de- 
velopment. Grammar is the most abstract and most difficult of the common 
school branches. It should, therefore, come latest in the course. Much of it 
should be left over for the advanced work of the high school and the colleges. 
Your committee would recommend that the common school course be divided 
into seven periods, each period corresponding to one full year’s work. This is, 
perhaps, the more common division outside of the cities. The correct use of En- 
glish should be taught during every day of the seven years. The cardinal prin- 
ciple throughout the course should be, “ Facts first and principles afterward.” Not 
a word should be put before the child without a clear understanding of the idea it 
conveys. Develop thought, and with this the power to express thought. Thought 
must be developed in all branches of the child’s course of study. Language cul- 
ture will teach the proper expression of this thought. Thus we see the necessity 
of teaching the use of language, at least incidentally, at évery recitation. There 
will, of course, also be special lessons in language. 
During the first year the teacher should take special care to develop the oral ex- 
Pression of thought. This may be effected through conversation, the’oral repro-
-P-A-G-E-417
eye 
duction of stories told by the teacher, and by similar exercises. The child will, of 
course, be taught to write every word he learns to read. In this way a written vo- 
cabulary is soon acquired, and as soon as possible the little learner writes his 
thoughts just as he would speak them. In other words, he acquires the art of 
talking with the pencil instead of with the tongue. Every new word is first written 
for him by the teacher. He copies it till he can reproduce it without the copy. 
This is learning to spell. He learns the use of capitals as they occur. He always 
puts a capital at the beginning of a sentence, because he never sees it any other 
way. If he makes any mistake the teacher corrects it and tells him what is right. 
He does not need to commit to memory arule. His teacher's statement is clear 
enough to guide him. Committing the words of a rule would deaden his power to 
think, and impede him. This principle will apply through the whole course of 
study. If taught by a progressive teacher, the little fellow will, before the end of 
the year, be writing simple letters to his cousins and to his grandmother. All his 
thoughts are a child’s thoughts, and his expression must correspond. He should 
not be taught any words that he cannot adopt in his own vocabulary and use. 
Like capitals, punctuation will be taught as it is needed and used. He will be 
taught that the punctuation is a part of the expression. It helps to indicate the 
thought, and is as necessary as the letters of the words. 
If, at the beginning of the second year, the child cannot write all he can speak 
the teacher should work him up to this power as soon as possible. The ability to 
record all his spoken thoughts should be the objective point of language culture 
for the first year to a limited extent, afterward complete and exact work should be 
done. 
The teacher will relate stories and the pupil will reproduce them in writing. 
Dictation exercises and various other work will be devised by the qualified teacher. 
Keep in mind that additional power to think and additional power to express 
thought should go hand in hand. One is correlative to the other. The receptive 
powers must not be cultivated exclusively. Creative power is the objective point 
of education. Most teachers attend to the receptive only. Their pupils learn all 
the rules of grammar but do not write any thing correctly. i 
During the third year the work continues in a manner similar to that of the 
second. Language exercises should accompany all the reading lessons. Care 
should be taken that every thing done shall be done well. Assign no mere task 
work. Make the expression of thought by writing the most popular exercise. As 
the pupil advances the work broadens. As his thought becomes more complex, 
the expression will be elaborated. New uses of capitals and punctuation will be 
demanded and taught. 
In the fourth year the pupil still learns and pursues the plan of previous years. 
He has learned to think more elaborately, and can express his thoughts with credit 
to himself and his teachers. He has plenty of written exercises, but not too many. 
He has oral exercises also. In his education so far, routine and mere formalism 
have been avoided. He is a thinker, and not a parrot. He has creative power. 
He can use the knowledge he has gained. 
 
-P-A-G-E-418
  Say OY ar 
Technical grammar has not yet been introduced, but the teacher, in an informal 
way, points out the different classes of words and some of their most obvious 
properties. This may, however, better be deferred till later. Many exercises and 
devises for language culture cannot be detailed in this report. Every intelligent 
teacher will originate many especially adapted to his own work, 
During the fifth year our pupil writes page after page of good English. There is 
rarely a mistake, and yet he has not studied a page of grammar in any book. All 
that he needed to enable him to write correctly he has learned, in practice, from 
his teacher. He cannot parse or give rules, but he can do what is far better. He 
can write good English. If, in the latter part of this year, the pupil is taught some 
of the principles of technical grammar in oral exercises, it may be well. It would, 
however, be more profitable, perhaps, to have him read numerous easy histories, 
biographies, and books of travel. 
Tn the sixth year put an easy text-book of grammar into the pupil's hand. Let 
him learn the foundation principles in the science of language. See that he has 
a clear understanding of all points, because this is a noble and important science 
which he is studying. He is now capable of more abstract reasoning, and should 
understand the subject. As before, thought and the expression of thought guide 
the work. Every principle is to be studied throngh the example. The number of 
aYrule is not important. The principle is the great thing. The teacher should 
dictate sentences involving a principle he would teach, have them written by all 
the class, and then call some one to explain and formulate a rule. The whole sub- 
ject of technical grammar should be taught in a practical manner and without 
routine and dead formalism. The parts of speech are to be picked out of sentences, 
and the office of every word in the sentence shown. 
During the seventh year expand the subject of English grammar. A text-book 
somewhat more advanced may be taught, but in most district schools the text-book 
should contain only the elementary principles. 
We have not: spoken of formal composition writing. Composition is merely the 
written expression of thought, and should be a daily exercise, especially in the first 
years. It is important to have reception days for the exhibition of results to the 
public, but the essays should be specimens of honest school work only, the same as 
that of other departments. Teachers want to guard against the idea that compo- 
sition writing is something outside of the regular work. In schools where it is so 
regarded the exercise becomes a great task and bugbear. On the contrary, chil- 
dren should find it one of the easiest and most delightful of tasks. 
Tf the course indicated above could be carried out in our district schools we feel 
sure the result would be fruitful. Students would be better prepared for practical 
life. They would also come into our high schools and colleges better fitted to do 
advanced work. 
We are aware that the great impediment in the way of gaining our ideal is a 
want of properly trained teachers. ‘To furnish these we need more Normal Schools

and Institutes. Educational literature must be more extensively circulated. 
County Superintendents must elevate the standard of teaching. There must be 
an advance all along the line.

Superintendent J. W. Saylor, of Knox County, Chairman of 
the Committee on State and oe Institutes, submitted the 
Caaving report: 
STATE AND COUNTY INSTITUTES. 
To the President and Members of the Association : 
We, your undersigned Committee on State and County Institutes, beg leave to 
submit the following report: 
We consider the true position of teaching to be one of the highest dignity and 
responsibility, and one to which men of pure and earnest ambition can well aspire ; 
that we recognize the importance of a higher standard of excellency and efficiency 
in the teachers of our public schools, and that the very basis of fitness for teach- 
ing is a broad and accurate scholarship, coupled with professional training and a 
knowledge of the best methods of doing the work of the school. We, therefore, 
consider the Teachers’ Institute to be an invaluable aid to the teacher in giving 
methods of class work, school organization, sustaining good order, inciting to dil- 
igence, and arousing enthusiastic effort. We, therefore, recommend, 
First—That two Teachers’ Institutes, one for the white and one for the colored 
teachers, be organized and conducted by the County Superintendent at some con- 
venient place in the county, from one to four weeks, between the middle of June 
and the first of August, and when a State Institute is held it shall be under the su- 
pervision of the County Superintendent. 
Second—That the Superintendent select a corps of experienced and efficient 
teachers to assist him in the Institute, and to make a programme of the proposed 
work and publish the same; also to urge the importance of every teacher in the 
county attending and taking a part in the Institute. 
_ Third—That the County Court of each county shall annually appropriate a 
sum, not less than fifty dollars, which shall be placed in the hands cf the County 
Superintendent to employ his assistants to conduct the Institute, which sum shall 
not be applied to any other purpose. 
Fourth—We recommend that the District Directors of the va:iors districts be 
requested to not employ any teacher to teach in their respective districts who fails 
- to attend the Teachers’ Institutes held in their respective counties. 
Fifth—That a President, Vice-president, Secretary, and a Committee on Ar- 
 
-P-A-G-E-420
. 
  rangements shall constitute the executive members of the Institute, and such 
‘questions shall be discussed as will be in keeping with the advancement of edu- 
cation. J. W. Saytor,

THIRD DAY—MORNING SESSION. 
Tuurspay Mornine, December 13, 1888. 
The Association met at 9 o’clock a.m., President Fuqua in 
the chair. 
Superintendent White, of Chester County, offered the follow- 
ing resolution, which was adopted unanimously: 
Wuereas, State Superintendent Frank M. Smith has, by his great activity and 
efficiency in the entire work of practicable supervision of the internal and statis- 
tical work of his. office, effected great progress and unprecedented success in the 
public schools of the State; therefore, 
Resolved, That it is the sense of this Convention of the School Officers of 
the State that he deserves great commendation therefor, and that he may have 
the opportunity to extend and perfect the work so energetically commenced and 
successfully advanced; that in justice to the school interests of the State we deem 
it proper that he be continued in office for the succeeding term of office, and so 
commend him to His Excellency Goy. R. L. Taylor and the Honorable Senators 
of the State of Tennessee. :

which was unanimously adopted: 
GRADING SCHOOLS, 
Your Committee on Grading Schools beg leave to submit the following report: 
Realizing the great importance of more unity of thought and action upon the 
part of school officers, teachers, patrons, and pupils, and knowing that to obtain 
these there must be some systematic arrangement of the work, some definite plan 
by which all parties concerned may be governed, we recommend, 
First—That every school in the State should be graded as nearly as possible in 
accordance with the course of study and system of grades as adopted for use in 
any county, a uniform system of text-books being used in all cases. 
Second—That the course of study shali include seven grades, the first being the 
primary grade, and that all pupils shall be classified according to their degrees of 
proficiency and placed in the proper grade, regardless of age, size, etc., and their 
names enrolled in the Register according to grade. 
Third—That pupils be permitted to pass from any grade to the next higher on 
examination only, and that no one shall be allowed to pass who falls below fifty in 
any branch, or fails to make a general average of at least sixty-five. 
Fourth—That at the close of the term the teacher shall be required to furnish 
every pupil with a certificate showing the grade in which he stands, and his profi- 
ciency, which shall be determined by an examination held for that purpose. 
Fifth—That all pupils who complete the branches prescribed to be taught in 
the public schools show evidence of good moral character, and on final examina- 
tion, held by the County Superintendent, merit a general average of seventy, shall 
be entitled to a diploma signed by the teacher, the School Board, and the County Su- 
perintendent, and that the diplomas furnished by the State Superintendent be used 
in all cases. H. D. Hurraxer, Chairman,

Superintendents White, Horr, and Billingsley were appointed 
a committee to wait upon the Governor and escort him to the 
hall for the purpose of delivering an address to the Association. 
The Governor soon appeared, and, upon being introduced by 
President Fuqua, spoke as follows: 
GOV. TAYLOR’S ADDRESS. 
« Gentlemen of the Convention : 
«“T am scarcely able this morning to stand upon my feet, and 
have not come here to make you any address, but I would feel 
that I had failed to discharge my duty if I did not extend that 
courtesy which is due from me to this honorable body if [ 
should fail to appear before you and bid you Godspeed in the 
grand work in which you are engaged. 
“ Since I have been Governor of Tennessee I have had my 
heart set upon elevating the standard of public education in my 
beloved State. I began by appointing the Hon. Frank M. 
Smith, of Jackson, Tennessee, as Superintendent of Public In- 
struction. [Applause.] I would not allude in your presence to 
any of the unpleasantness of the past, but I believe before my 
second term expires that the State, and especially the educators 
of the State, will see the wisdom of that appointment. [Ap- 
plause.] I want to say to you further that, if I live to be in- 
augurated, Frank M. Smith will be your Superintendent for 
two more years. [Applause.] 
“ Now, I believe that this is one of the most important meet- 
ings ever held in the State. I think this is one of the best 
steps in the educational field that was ever taken in the State— 
the organization of the Superintendents of the public schools 
of the State to meet annually to confer with each other and 
interchange opinions, and make rules for uniformity of action 
_ and with uniformity of method. 
“TI do not think that any step could have been taken which 
 
-P-A-G-E-424
  Sab Oe 
will give more impetus to education in Tennessee. We have 
our great universities here which are a pride and a glory to the 
State. We have our colleges in almost every town and on 
every hill top. I am proud of Tennessee as an educational 
State. She is the leader of the South to-day in education, in 
colleges, and universities, but I hold that our colleges and uni- 
versities cannot prosper as they ought to prosper unless they 
are backed and fed by good common schools. [Applause.] 
“Now, Mr. President and gentlemen of the Convention, I did 
not intend to say as much as I have said. I wish you all God- 
speed in your work. Tennessee may well feel proud of her 
County Superintendents, and her State Superintendent, for the 
past shows that you have been at work, and society is feeling 
to-day the effect of your work in Tennessee. The prosperity 
of Tennessee, and its happiness, and its future, depend upon the 
education of its people. The preacher in the pulpit does much 
for society and the State, but I hold that in your position you 
do as much for the civilization, amelioration, happiness, and 
the growth of our society and our State, as the ministers of the 
gospel in the pulpit or in their profession. [Applause.] 
“Go on in your work. Let the world see that Tennessee is 
alive in educational matters, and that will invite the best ele- 
ment from other States to our borders. Our State lies on God’s 
golden zone. It has its mountains in the east, where I was 
born, that kiss the skies, and ten thousand rivers and rivulets 
pouring forth from their sides and laughing on to the seas. 
Here is the basin of Middle Tennessee with its blue grass, fine 
stock, handsome residences, beautiful women, and gallant men. 
And then there is the great cotton belt in the west—every ele- 
ment of wealth in our borders to build up a grand civilization 
and a grand people. We already have a glorious civilization 
and grand people, but I want to see education permeate the 
darkest corners. I believe we must rely more for the education 
of the people, and their civilization upon the public schools of 
the country, than anywhere else in the world [applause], be- 
cause they affect the poor people out in the country.

“Tet us build up a high standard of education in the public 
schools, and if they cannot get a college education, let them get 
a good common school education. History demonstrates the 
fact that if a Tennessean can get a common school education 
he is all right, because he has the brains to back it. 
“TJ cannot say any thing more. I trust that your meeting here 
will not only be profitable but pleasant to you all, and that you 
may all carry home with you happy memories of your mingling 
here together, and that next year will tell of the effect of this 
meeting of the County Superintendents of the public schools of 
Tennessee.” [Applause.] 
Superintendent Nelson moved that a vote of thanks be ex- 
tended the Governor for his excellent address. Carried. 
Superintendent T. F. Smalling, of Bedford County, Chair- 
man of the Committee on School Laws, submitted a report, 
which was taken up section by section and adopted, as follows: 
EPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON sCHOOL LAW. 
Recognizing the fact that since the enactment of the General Assembly in 1873. 
to establish a uniform system of public schools, the public welfare requires some 
revision of the school law, we, your Committee, beg leave to submit the follow- 
ing suggestions, and request that a committee be appointed to present them to the 
next General Assembly : 
First—That section 4 be so amended as to add these words: ‘And his traveling. 
expenses shall be paid by the State.” 
Second—That section 9 be so amended as to add one more subsection, No. 8, 
which shall read as follows: ‘fo organize the District Directors into a county 
board, which shall hold its meetings semi-annually for the purpose of investigating 
the condition of the schools, and each director shall be paid $1 for his attendance 
at each meeting by order of the County Superintendent. 
. That the District Clerks be allowed $1 per day for actual services, in addition to 
_ two cents per capita for taking scholastic population.

TEACHERS’ READING CIRCLE. 
Your Committee on Teachers’ Reading Circle beg leave to submit the follow- 
ing brief report: 
The Teachers’ Reading Circle is a pleasant, effective, and indispensable means 
of professional improvement. Such an organization should exist in every county 
in the State, and should have the endorsement of all friends of educational prog- 
ress. 
A course of study best adapted to the wants of each county should be selected. 
Lessons should be assigned monthly, and monthly meetings held for the purpose of 
discussing the merits of such lessons. 
The organization should be the same as similar bodies.

J. U. Tyxer. 
Superintendent G. T. Gregory, of Humphreys County, Chair- 
man of the Committee on Work of School Directors, submitted 
the following report, which was adopted unanimously : 
WORK OF DISTRICT DIRECTORS. 
We, your Committee on Work of District Directors, beg leave to submit the fol- 
lowing: 
First—Realizing the fact that the School Directors are one of the important fac- 
tors in the Public Schools, and knowing that their work is occasionally done with- 
out knowledge of its effect, we therefore recommend the election of men of intelli- 
gence, and ardent supporters of the public school system—always ready to pro- 
mote the school interest in any reasonable way. “ 
Second—That Directors should study closely their duties as required by law, and 
fearlessly execute them. 
Third—That they should use every means in their power to secure wide-awake 
and successful teachers who love the work. 
Fourih—That they should see that each school in their district is properly sup- _ 
plied with desks, black-boards, crayons, etc., and urge that comfortable school _ 
houses be erected if possible. 
Fifth—That it is their duty to require uniformity of text-books, a system of
-P-A-G-E-429
  LAS pares 
gradation, and see that each school is graded in accordance with the course of 
study. 
Sixth—That they should visit a/7 schools in their districts and see their teachers 
are what they pretend to be—teachers—and not simply school keepers. 
Seventh—That they urge upon the patrons of the school the importance of reg- 
ular attendance, as we know non-attendance to be one of the greatest evils to our 
public schools. 
Highth—That they in all cases examine teachers’ certificates before signing their 
contracts, and the salaries should be regulated according to etfliciency. 
Ninth—That when two or more teachers apply for the same position preference 
should be given to the best qualified, regardless of kindred or favorites. 
Tenth—That they should co-operate with the County Superintendent in having 
all teachers’ abstracts and directors’ reports promptly forwarded to the County 
Superintendents, and thus materially aid in the propagation of public school educa- 
tion. 
All of which is respectfully submitted to your consideration. 
G. T. Grecory, Chairman. 
J. W. Ducean, 
H. J. McCoou, Directors. 
W. H. Payne, Chairman of the Committee on Peabody Nor- 
mal College, made the following verbal report : 
PEABODY NORMAL COLLEGE. 
“Mr. Prestpent: I have’no written report to present. My 
health has been such, and my duties so pressing, that I have 
not had time to commit any thing to writing. I will make a 
very brief report as to the condition of the Normal College. 
“Tn the first place, allow me to observe that the Normal Col- 
lege sustains the same relation to the State at large that the 
Teacher’s Institute does to the county. It is simply a school 
for preparing young men and women for a quality of work in 
the public schools. Since I stood before you last year I have 
become better acquainted with affairs in Tennessee, and the
-P-A-G-E-430
  ee iy ee 
South generally, and am able to know more about the work of 
the institution. So far as numbers are concerned the progress 
of the school has been considerable. We have now enrolled 
two hundred and fifty-four students, an increase of seventy-five, 
more than the school has ever had before. The extent to which 
‘the Normal College is serving the State of Tennessee may be 
seen from the fact that just one-half of the present enrollment, 
viz., one hundred and twenty-seven, are from the State of Ten- 
nessee. At an annual expense of $10,000, the Normal College 
is doing the same service for the State that any other college 
would at a cost of $30,000 or $40,000 per year. The cost of a 
plant for a normal college would be $100,000, and its running 
expenses would be $30,000 or $40,000 per year. A brief history 
of: the college is this: 
“George Peabody left $2,500,000 for the support of public 
schools in the South. We receive in this school about one-half 
of the net revenue of this fund. The Peabody fund pays for 
the support of the school between $30,000 and $40,000 per year. 
The expense to the State is $10,000 per year. The University — 
Board furnishes the buildings and grounds, and this can be es- 
timated at not less than $100,000. Every cent of their income 
is spent in maintaining the buildings and keeping the grounds 
in good repair. 
“JT wish I could speak to all of the County Superintendents 
in Tennessee, for if there is any question in Tennessee that 
ought to interest these Superintendents it is this College. Young 
people must be trained to teach, and that is our purpose. In 
every county in this State there is some bright and ambitious 
young man or woman who are turning their attention to the 
avocation of teacher, having become dissatisfied with their 
present employment. We will take care of such a young man 
or woman at the College. There is no expense for tuition, the 
books are furnished free, and the only cost is the nominal 
charge of $6 per year. 
“There is the same difference between teachers as there is 
between artists. There is a great difference between a man

Eegpee 
that can whitewash a barn and one that can paint a $10,000 pic- 
ture. The same applies to the art of teaching. We give stu- 
dents a sound English education with professional instruction 
and that practical experience that will enable then to teach a 
school when they return home. 
“Tam greatly obliged to the Superintendents for the atten- 
tion they paid to the circular I sent out last year. I think we 
got an increase of students in consequence of that circular. It 
would give me extreme pleasure to have all the members of this 
Association to visit the Normal College at any time they may 
seem convenient.” 
Superintendent Smith moved that the report be received and 
adopted. Carried. 
State Superintendent Smith said that the fourteen scholar- 
ships from Tennessee would be vacant at the close of this year, 
and that examinations would be held under the supervision of 
the County Superintendents on the second Thursday in August. 
Questions would be sent out from his office, and these papers 
would be graded and a committee appointed to pass upon their 
merits. There will be one scholarship for the State at large, 
one for each grand division of the State, and one for each Con- 
gressional District, making in all fourteen. The questions 
would be prepared by President Payne, and sent in a sealed en- 
velope to each County Superintendent, with instructions not to 
open that envelope until the day of the examination and in the 
presence of the applicants. ‘This is done so there can be no 
unfairness charged against the County Superintendent. Appli- 
cants must be seventeen years old and under thirty. 
President Payne said the average cost for board, room, fire, 
and light for a young lady was $17 or $18 per month. The 
price had been decreased somewhat since last year. The cost 
of a young man’s board would be $12 per month, including 
room. He said he would send to the Superintendents some cer- 
tificates of admission, and if they had a young man or woman 
who fell just a little short of getting a scholarship they could 
 
-P-A-G-E-432
  Gps 
give them this certificate, and they would be admitted to the 
College without any further examination. 
Prof. W. R. Garrett, President of the Local Executive Com- 
mittee of the National Educational Association, was introduced 
to the association, and spoke as follows: 
Mr. President aud Gentlemen of the Association : 
“T want to say a few words with reference to the next meet- 
ing of the National Educational Association in this city next 
summer. 
“T think and believe that it isa general feeling among all 
our educational men that the meeting of this association here 
will mark an era in the history of education in this State, and 
possibly in the whole South. 
“This National Educational Association has reached wonder- 
ful proportions. TI believe it was established in 1857, and it has 
grown until its membership now runs up into the thousands. 
It is an educational conference, and brings together the most 
matured thought of the ablest educators not only from the 
United States but from foreign countries. It is in session gen- 
erally a little less than a week, and there are from ten to fifteen 
thousand in attendance. It is divided into ten or twelve de- 
partments. In the morning a general meeting is held, at which 
they consider educational questions of a general character. The 
afternoons are devoted to the meeting of the different depart- 
ments. There is a department of kindergarten, elementary in- 
struction, secondary instruction, high schools and colleges, in- 
dustrial training, musical training, department for Superintend- 
ents, normal school department, and some others. In the after- 
noon the body separates into these various departments, and 
these are specially interesting. The papers that are read are 
very valuable, and at the close of the session are bound together — 
in a large volume. This volume becomes the property of every 
member of the Association, and is furnished to each member 
without cost.
-P-A-G-E-433
pee 
“The second valuable feature of the Association is the expo- 
sition. If we secure the capitol for the meeting we will have 
the building full of educational exhibits, and it will be the first 
distinct educational exposition ever held in the South. 
“Tn this it is to be hoped that every part of Tennessee will 
be represented in the form of examination papers, and any 
character of work, maps that are drawn by pupils, or any thing 
that the schools, public or private, are doing. We want to call 
on everybody that feels an interest in such work and a pride in 
Southern progress, to make such an exhibit of school work 
that will surprise our visitors. In connection with this school 
work there will be an art exhibition, and also an exhibit by the 
State of its mineral resources. 
“The third great feature of this Association is that it is the 
largest, most respectable, and the best organized prominent ex- 
cursion party in the world. There have been excursions to 
Alaska, Sandwich Islands, Mexico, and various other places. 
Some excursions have already been arranged for the coming 
meeting. There will be excursions all over our section of the 
country—to Mammoth Cave, Birmingham, Chattanooga, Look- 
out Mountain, Cloudland, and all over our magnificent mountain 
country. The high peaks and the fine scenery over on the 
- North Carolina, as well as that in Tennessee, will all be visited. 
_ There is no such scenery in the country east of the Mississippi 
River, and very little superior to it on the other side. 
“ These visitors feel an especial interest in visiting the battle 
grounds and manufacturing points. An idea prevails among 
them that the mining interests of this country are wonderful, 
and are just beginning to be developed. We will have with us 
not only those interested in education, but capitalists seeking 
investments, and representatives of the press from the leading 
papers in the United States, and at the close of the meeting 
there will be a large press excursion of men who will want to 
visit the mining regions, the manufactories and fine stock farms 
of this country.

“ This is the character of the meeting that will be held here 
next year. They are coming with a feeling of enthusiasm, and 
when they return to their respéctive homes they will write and 
publish glowing descriptions of our wonderful State. 
“This invitation was made by the State Legislature, and the 
Governor wrote a strong letter, and when it was read in the 
presence of at least five thousand people in the largest hall in 
San Francisco, I am sure that every Tennessean would have 
been proud to have seen the enthusiasm with which it was re- 
ceived. The invitation from the State was accompanied by one 
from the State Teachers’ Association, written in very strong 
terms. There was also an invitation from the institutions of 
learning in different parts of the State, and from the School 
Boards of Nashville, Jackson, and other cities in the State. 
‘In addition to these there was an invitation from the City 
Council of Nashville, Board of Education, from the institutions 
of learning located at Nashville, and from various other sources. 
In addition to that the entire delegation from the South, con- 
sisting of two or three hundred, held a mecting in San Fran- 
cisco, and made these invitations an invitation from the solid 
South. 
“We all know how Tennessee came to be the University 
State. Religious denominations were seeking to establish 
~ schools for the whoie gulf country. They looked around to 
find a central location for these schools, and each of these de- 
nominations found that the place to locate an educational in- 
stitution was in the State of Tennessee. Thus it is that all over 
our State, not only at Nashville, but in the eastern and western 
parts, are located the main universities for the Southern States. 
Upon the invitations so unanimously presented by the Southern 
delegation this meeting was established here in Nashville. 
This is a meeting not for Nashville alone, but for the whole 
State of Tennessee and the entire South, and I want to ask the 
school officers to unite as one body to make this meeting a 
success. We want aid, fellow-teachers. We must have enthu- 
siastic co-operation. Publish it abroad everywhere, and bring 
here not only teachers, not only school officers, but all friends 
of education. We shall formulate and send out circulars, etc.,
-P-A-G-E-435
epee     giving full information. We want a committee in every county. 
The railroad arrangements have been made at half fare rates, 
plus $2.00, which secures you a ticket of membership in the 
Association. If you wish to take excursions after you reach 
Nashville you can purchase excursion tickets at simular rates. 
Tickets will be good for ninety days, and will be put on sale 
about the first of next July. : 
“There will be a bulletin published, and one hundred thou- 
sand copies circulated all over the United States. In that bul- 
letin will be written up every thing about Tennessee. There 
will be advertisements on a few of the pages. 
“Now, fellow teachers, I hope you will all write to us about 
this matter, and furnish us a list of men who will be willing to 
serve on these committees.” 
Capt. Garrett then read some extracts from a distinguished 
educator in New England, giving some facts about the arrange- 
ments that had already been commenced there for the meeting, 
and stating that there would be a large attendance from that 
section of the country. 
State Superintendent Smith moved that the address of Capt. 
Garrett be embodied in the report of the proceedings of the 
_ Association, which was agreed to. 
Superintendent Zuccarello, Chairman of the Committee on 
Resolutions, made the following report, which was unanimously 
adopted : 
REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON RESOLUTIONS.

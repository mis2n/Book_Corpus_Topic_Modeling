re INTRODUCTION SS

HERE is no subject in the Elementary Course 
more important than language. It is taught 
all through the grades, and yet pupils pass from 
the graded schools into the high school and into 
life unable to use it with any particular degree of 
force or grammatical correctness. Their speech 
is full of errors. It is because pupils have not 
formed the habit of talking and writing correctly. 
There is a vast difference between knowing how 
to do a thing and always doing it. It is not mere 
knowledge, but habit that we want. 
The use of correct English is a habit. To geta 
habit thoroughly rooted in a child’s life takes 
careful drill and constant repetition. Children 
like to repeat; they enjoy doing and saying things 
over and over again. There are only twenty or 
thirty errors in grammar that persistently occur, 
and if we can put the correct expression for these 
errors in the form of a game, we shall have an 
excellent motive to get these correct forms fre- 
quently repeated and their use a fixed habit on the 
part of pupils. This is the purpose of this little 
book, ‘‘Language Games For All Grades.’’ 
The keynote of teaching correct composition in 
all the grades, but especially in the lower ones,

lies in giving children practice in expressing their 
ideas correctly and clearly,—orally—not on paper. 
Pupils can go over a troublesome expression 
orally a dozen times while they are writing it 
once. The games described in this book will give 
teachers interesting material for fine oral drill on 
troublesome words and forms of expression. 
The author of ‘‘Language Games For All 
Grades’’ has been principal, for several years, of 
one of the largest schools in Winona, Minn. 
During all that time she has taught a class in 
English and has been most successful in super- 
vising this subject in all the grades. As her super- 
intendent of schools for two years, I know that 
not only has she conscientiously tried out all these © 
games, but that they have done much to eliminate 
the common errors in grammar of oral and writ- 
ten speech among her pupils and to inculcate in 
them the language sense and habit of correct 
speech. 
In the brief trial that I have given with several 
of these games in this city, I am sure they will be 
of great assistance to all elementary school teach- 
ers in their struggle to better the English of their 
pupils.

LANGUAGE GAMES FOR ALL GRADES 
WHY THEY WERE WRITTEN 
‘Aun teachers are aware that simply teaching 
that certain forms of speech are correct does not 
go far toward eliminating errors in grammar. 
Children adopt the forms of speech used by the 
majority of the people about them, regardless of 
what they have been taught. It is the constant 
repetition of certain forms, which molds the 
speech of the child. ) 
If, therefore, some method be discovered by 
which children may be brought frequently to use 
the correct forms in a natural manner, and under 
conditions which strongly appeal to them, there 
is great hope that the use of these forms will 
become a fixed habit. 
In the strong belief that these games, if rightly 
used, will, in a great measure, bring about the de- 
sired results, I offer them to those earnest teachers 
whose work along these lines, has, at times, seemed 
so hopeless. 
THEIR GENERAL AIMS 
1 To secure much repetition of correct forms

HOW TO USE THEM 
1 Select the games adapted to, and needed by 
your grade. The grading is in no wise arbitrary. 
Some first or second grades might take a game 
listed for the fourth grade and some fourth 
grades might get much out of a first grade game. 
Experiment. As far as was possible, the games 
have been listed in order of sequence. 
2 Do not attempt to use all the cards iu one 
game. Select those most needed. At the begin- 
ning use very few, especially in the lower grades. 
3 Do not wear out the interest by too frequent
-P-A-G-E-15
  LANGUAGE GAMES FOR ALL GRADES 15 
use. The games are supplementary, and should 
be used but once or twice a week. 
4 Insist upon the full statement, in the exact 
words for which each game calls. When we play 
games we must follow ‘‘the rule of the game.’’ 
Use this term in directing. 
5 Teach the children the name of the game 
played, so that after becoming familiar with sev- 
eral games, they may choose them by name. When 
pupils speak ungrammatically after becoming 
familiar with the games the teacher may say, 
“Which game has John forgotten?”’ or ‘‘ John has 
broken the rule of the ‘Wish’ game,’’ or whatever 
it may be. The name is primarily for the child’s 
use. 
6 Only two games (XXVIII and XXIX) need 
to be written. The aim of the game is primarily 
to correct oral expression. 
7 ‘The technical terms used in the description 
are for the teacher, not the pupils. 
8 Prepare for the game as you would prepare 
for any other lesson. Know it before you attempt 
to teach it, and teach it before you expect the 
children to know it.

THE “IF I WERE” GAME 
GRADES I-III 
Aim: (a) To teach ‘‘I was’ and ‘‘If I were.’’ 
(b) To cultivate the imagination. 
Merxop: Teacher gives following directions. 
Tracuer: ‘‘Children, all sit back in your seats. 
Close your eyes. Go to sleep. Dream that you 
‘are not a boy or a girl but are some animal or 
flower or tree. [Waits while they dream.] Wake 
up! What did you dream that you were, John?’’ 
Jonny. ‘‘I dreamed that I was a fish.’’ 
Tracuer. ‘‘If you were a fish what would you 
do, John?’’ 
Joun. ‘‘If I were a fish I would swim.”’ 
Tracuer. ‘‘Mary, what did you dream that you 
were?’ ; 
Mary. ‘‘I dreamed that I was a butterfly.’’
-P-A-G-E-18
  18 LANGUAGE GAMES FOR ALL GRADES 
Treacuer. ‘‘If you were a butterfly what would 
you do?”’ 
Mary. “If I were a butterfly I would fly high 
in the air.’’ 
Continue as long as the children are interested. 
If they fail to dream of a variety of things the 
teacher may be a fairy and whisper a name to 
them while asleep.

THE ‘‘I SHALL”? GAME 
GRADES I-III 
Arm: (a) To teach the use of ‘‘I shall’’ (to 
foretell) in place of ‘‘I will.’’ 
(b) To accustom the child to use ‘‘drew’’ 
| instead of ‘‘drawed.”’ 
(c) Incidentally to inculcate generosity. 
Mertuop: Use either the cards containing the 
following words or small mounted pictures of the 
things named. Objects may be used. 
apple lemon penny book 
cherry candy nickel doll 
orange popeorn dime box 
pear basket quarter ball 
peach picture dollar pencil 
If cards or pictures are used, shuffle and let 
pupils draw. If objects, put them into a large 
box and have the children close their eyes while 
drawing. As each pupil draws the teacher asks, 
“John, what did you draw?’’ 
19
-P-A-G-E-20
  20 LANGUAGE GAMES FOR ALL GRADES 
Joun. ‘‘I drew a lemon.’’ 
Tracuer. ‘‘What shall you do with your 
lemon?’ 
Joun. ‘‘T shall make some lemonade and give 
you all a drink of it.’’ 
Tracuer. ‘‘Thank you, John, I am glad that 
you are not selfish,’’ or ‘‘It is very kind of you to 
share your lemonade with us.’’ 
It will add to the interest of the game to let the 
child do the thing he says. For instance, if he 
draws the basket and says, ‘‘I shall fill it with 
flowers,’’ let him pretend to pick flowers for it. 
The teacher should suggest things to be done by 
adroit questions, particularly with the younger 
children. Use but few words when the game is 
new.

pils, asking each to choose some one who has no 
card for a partner.

circus church moving picture show 
farm park icehouse 
woods party wedding 
At a signal all holding cards rise and find part- 
ners, and walk with them to any part of the room 
that they imagine represents the place named on 
the card. (Or the teacher may designate a place 
for each, or simply let them march around the

room.) A bell is rung when all must run to school 
(meaning their seats). 
Tracuer [then asks]. ‘‘James, where did you 
go 9 ” 
Jamus. ‘‘Mary and I went to the circus.’’ 
Tracuser. ‘‘What did you see at the circus?’’ 
Jamus. ‘‘I saw a monkey at the circus.’’ 
If pupil says ‘‘Me and Mary’? or ‘‘I seen’’ take 
the card from him. When several have been col- 
lected pass them out to persons not previously in

but in sight of the children she says to them, ‘‘Do 
as I do,’’ and then performs some simple action, 
such as rising on the tiptoes, raising hands above 
head or clasping hands over head. She might 
close her eyes or make a funny face. 
She then steps out from behind the ‘‘Watcher’’ » 
and asks different individuals, ‘‘Did you see what 
I did?’’? The children say, “Yes, Miss Clark, I 
saw what you did.’’ She then asks, ‘‘Did you do 
as I did?’’ and they answer, ne I did as you 
did.”

After enough repetition has been secured the 
teacher asks the ‘‘Watcher,’’ ‘‘Can you do as I 
did?’’ and the answer it, ‘‘Yes, I can do as you 
did,’’? and then the ‘‘Watcher’’ performs the 
action. The teacher then asks the school, ‘‘Chil- 
dren, did the ‘Watcher’ do as we did?”’ and the 
children (or some one selected) answers, ‘‘ Yes, 
Miss Clark, the ‘Watcher’ did as we did.’’ ‘‘Then 
she has won the game and may be seated.’’ 
If the ‘‘Watcher’’ fails, the teacher may ask 
the children to repeat the movement until it can 
be performed by the ‘‘Watcher’’ when a new 
‘““Watcher’’ is chosen.

body left the cage door open and my bird flew 
away. John, have you seen my bird?’’ 
If John does not hold the card containing the 
word ‘‘bird’’ he replies, ‘‘No, Miss Green, I 
haven’t seen your bird.’’ This continues until the 
teacher finds the pupil who holds the right card, 
when that pupil replies, ‘‘Yes, Miss Green, I have 
seen your bird.’’ Teacher then asks, ‘‘Where is 
my bird?’’ When the pupil replies, ‘‘It is at my 
house’’ (meaning desk). Teacher then says to any 
selected pupil, ‘‘George, go to John’s house and 
get my bird for me.’’? George then fetches the 
card to the teacher, saying, ‘‘I have brought your 
bird,’’? whereupon the teacher responds, ‘‘ Thank 
you, George, for bringing my bird to me.’’ 
After pupil says, ‘‘Yes, I have seen your bird. 
It is at my house,’’ the teacher may say, ‘‘ Please 
keep it at your home until I call for it,’’? and con- 
tinues until all have answered, when she collects 
the cards herself.

White, I haven’t your ball, but I think James has 
it.’? [Naming pupil behind him.] Teacher then 
asks James the same question, who gives the same 
answer and this continues until the pupil who 
holds the card containing the word ‘‘ball’’ is 
reached, when he answers, ‘‘Yes, Miss White, I 
have your ball.’’ Teacher then says, ‘‘ William, 
will you please return my ball to the box?’’ (which 
will be placed in a convenient place). When it 
has been returned teacher says, ‘‘Thank you, Wil- 
liam, for returning my ball.’’ | 
If a child fails to respond when he holds the ? 
card the teacher should take it away saying, ‘‘I | 
am sorry Jennie found my ball, because she did

pencil or pointer) is her wand. Remember that 
a fairy’s wand touches one very lightly. Now, | 
all put your heads down on your desks, close your 
eyes, and sleep. Do not wake up until I call you.’’ 
Jennie, previously instructed, passes up and 
down the aisles, lightly touching several children 
with her wand, then returns to her place, which 
may be a chair called her throne. 
The teacher then says, ‘‘Wake up, childrén!’’ 
and begins to question: ‘William, was it you 
that the fairy touched while you slept?’’ 
Wut. ‘No, it was not I.”’ 
Tracumr. ‘‘James, was it you?’’

Tracuer [says to the Fairy]. ‘‘Why did you 
touch these children with your wand?’’ 
Famy. ‘‘Because I wanted them to follow me.’’ 
Tracuer. ‘‘Very well, they may go with you.’’ 
‘Whereupon they follow the fairy on tiptoe up 
and down the aisles, imitating everything she does,

Circus. The teacher then says, ‘‘Children, look 
at your ecards. If you do not know the word 
printed on it I will whisper it to you. Think care- 
fully. Would you see what your card tells you 
about at the circus, on the farm, or in the woods? 
“Now we will play that these cards are tickets to 
take us to those places. When I clap my hands 
the first time all the children who have tickets for 
the circus run to the cireus.’’ [Teacher claps and

THE ‘‘WHAT DID YOU DO?”’ GAME 
GRADES I-IV—SELECT TO SUIT GRADE 
Aim: (a) To teach the children to use the past 
forms of troublesome verbs, asso- 
ciating them with their present 
forms. 
(b) Incidentally to teach them to follow 
written directions. 
Meruop: Pass one card to each pupil. As soon 
as the card has been carefully read, the teacher 
gives a signal and all pupils, at once, do what 
the card tells them, and then return to their seats. 
When all are seated, the teacher calls by num- 
ber, asking, ‘‘What did you do?’’ and pupils re- 
spond, using past tense of verb. For example: 
(6) ‘‘I arose and stood in the aisle.’’ 
At the beginning, with low grades, but few cards 
should be used. 
Teacher may conduct this as a race, saying,— 
“Get ready, Go!’’

the Leader reading one word. All who have words 
that rhyme with the word read rise quickly. They 
may be given orally or written in a column on the 
blackboard, or, the children who ‘‘rhyme’’ (if 
very young) may skip into groups before giving 
their words. Pupil forfeits card on making a mis- 
take. t

tioner may choose someone to answer his question. 
Two lines are formed as in spelling down. The 
pupils are numbered from one to ten and ques- 
tions passed. When the teacher calls No. 1, the 
questioner reads his question; his partner replies. 
If the answer is in any way incorrect the teacher 
says—‘‘Wrong,’’ and the pupil is seated, when the

THE ‘“‘T AM NOT”? GAME 
GRADES II-VI 
Aim: (a) To afford repetition of ‘‘I am not’’ 
until it sounds as familiar to the 
child as ‘‘I ain’t.”’ 
(b) Incidentally to familiarize pupils 
with names of birds, animals, 
explorers, musicians, artists, 
poets, authors, ete. 
(c) To accustom pupils to use name in 
addressing people. 
Mernop: At the beginning, the teacher will 
write on blackboard ten or twelve of any three of 
the above, according to grade, having pupils name 
them as she writes. Leave them on board during 
the game. 
A ‘‘Guesser’’ is sent out of the room. Pupils 
_ select one child to be ‘‘It,’’ after which they de- 
cide whether he shall be a bird, animal, plant, ete. 
If a bird, which bird, as oriole. Guesser returns 
and asks in any order he desires, ‘‘Are you It, 
_ John?’’ until the right one is found, when he 
answers, ‘‘Yes, James, I am It.’’

so on until he says bird, when the answer is, ‘‘ Yes, 
I am a bird.’’ Then, ‘‘Are you a robin?’’ and 
so on until the correct bird is guessed. 
It is interesting to have a ‘‘Teller’’ at the black- 
board keep tally of the number of questions asked, 
permitting only ten birds or animals to be named, 
when he calls ‘‘Ten!’’ and the game is over. The - 
person who is ‘‘It’’ then says, ‘‘I am an oriole,’’

  xy THE GAME OF ‘“‘HAS AND HASN’D”’ 
GRADES II-VIII 
Aim: To substitute ‘‘has’’ and ‘‘hasn’t’’ for 
‘oot’? and ‘‘hain’t got’’ in the child’s vocabulary. 
Meruop: Send one pupil called ‘‘ The Guesser’’ 
from the room. Teacher gives one pupil a penny 
or some small object previously agreed upon. The 
guesser returns and asks, ‘‘Has Mary the 
penny?’’ The question may be asked of pupils 
consecutively, of some one appointed, or of the 
class as a whole. The answer is, ‘‘No, Mary hasn’t 
the penny.’’ The guesser continues the ques- 
tions until the penny is located when of course the 
answer becomes, ‘‘Yes, John has the penny.’’ An- 
other person is then appointed guesser. 
Interest is added by sending a ‘‘Teller’’ to the 
blackboard to record the number of questions the 
guesser must ask.

THE “WHO IS IT?” GAME 
GRADES III-VIII 
Am: To familiarize pupils witb the correct 
forms of pronouns used as attribute complements. 
Mernop: Teacher as ‘‘guesser,’’ leaves the 
room. Children choose one pupil to be ‘‘It.’’ 
Teacher returns, points to different pupils, herself 
or groups, asking as she does so,— 
“Ts ithe??? ‘Is it she??? “Isit you??? ‘Is it 
wel”? ‘Is it I?’ ‘Is it they?”’ 
As each question is asked one pupil previously 
appointed (or class in concert) must respond, 
“No, it isn’t he,’’ ‘‘No, it isn’t she,’’? and so on, 
until the guess is correct, when the answer be- 
comes, ‘‘ Yes, it is she.’’ 
It adds to the interest of the game to have a 
“‘Teller’’ appointed who shall keep tally on ‘the 
blackboard of the number of questions asked be- 
fore the right person is guessed. 
After asking ten or twelve as above, it is well to 
change the order and ask the pupil directly,

  THE “WISH” GAME 58 
The teacher passes a card to each pupil, taking 
one herself. Teacher begins game by saying, ‘‘I 
wish I were an apple-tree. If I were an apple-tree 
I would give a big, red apple to each little boy who 
passed by.’’ 
Each child follows in the same manner, using 
his own word. Later, pupils may use these sen- 
tences as beginnings of imaginative stories. 
This game may be varied by putting appro- 
priate adjectives before the noun—as, ‘‘I wish I 
were an old, gnarled, wide-spreading apple-tree,’’ 
ete. 
Teacher must insist upon correct form and cor- 
rect use of ‘‘a’’ and ‘‘an.’’ Refer to these as 
“Rules of the Game.’’ 
Or, choose partners as in Game II. Pass cards 
to questioners. No. 1 asks, ‘‘If you were a 
what would you do?’’ His partner replies, ‘‘If I 
were a——,’’ etc. [Follow directions in Game IT.]

THE ‘“‘I SAW IT’’ AND ‘‘WHAT IS IT?”? 
GAME 
GRADES IV-VIII 
Aim: (a) To help the pupils form the habit of 
using ‘‘saw’’ instead of ‘‘seen,’’ 
in the past tense. 
(b) To sharpen their wits in questioning. 
Mertuop: The ‘‘guesser’’ is sent from the 
room. The teacher calls several pupils to her and 
shows them some small object, as a coin, pencil, 
letter, ring, or book. Pupils then return to their 
seats. The guesser enters and asks any pupil, 
“Did you see it?’’? Pupil addressed answers, 
“Yes, I saw it,’’ or ‘‘No, I didn’t see it, but Mary 
saw it,’’ ete. Each time a pupil says, ‘‘ Yes, I saw 
it,’? the guesser stands him up in front, until all 
who saw it are inarow. The guesser then begins 
to question each one to find what the object is, 
asking only one question of each pupil, such as, 
“Ts it good to eat?’ ‘‘Can you wear it?’’ ‘‘Can 
you spend it?’’ ‘‘Can you write with it?’’ and the 
pupils questioned must respond, ‘‘Yes, it is good 
to eat,’’ or ‘‘No, it is not good to eat.’’

-P-A-G-E-55
  ne 
“IT SAW IT” AND “WHAT IS IT?” 55 
If the guesser fails to discover the object the 
pupils who did not see the object may each ask a 
question, and guess it if they can. 
If the latter part of the game is too difficult for 
the lower grades, it may be omitted and the 
guesser may ask all who saw it, ‘‘What did you 
see?’’ and they may answer in concert, ‘‘We saw 
a penny,’’ or whatever the object was.

THE ‘DID YOU DO IT?” GAME 
GRADES V-VIII 
Atm: (a) To familiarize the pupil with the 
correct verb-form, through fre- 
quent repetition, and to eliminate 
‘‘done’’ in the past tense. 
Meruop: Send the ‘‘guesser’’ out of the room. 
Teacher assigns some inconspicuous action, such 
as putting arm in certain position, crossing feet 
or holding book in left hand. About one-third of 
the class are appointed to do this. The guesser 
returns and asks any pupil, ‘‘Did you do it?’’ 
Pupil answers, ‘‘Yes, I did it,’’ or ‘‘No, I didn’t 
do it, but John did it.’? As soon as the guesser 
thinks he knows the action he sits down and imi- 
tates it, asking, ‘‘Did I do it?’’? If correct, the 
pupils all answer, ‘‘Yes, you did it.’’

all whose words fit in the sentence, to rise. Test 
words, having pupil repeat sentence each time. 
Continue until all words are used.

THE “SYNONYM” GAME 
GRADES VI-VIII 
Arm: ‘To increase the pupil’s vocabulary and 
secure variety in expression. 
Mztnop: Use the two sets of cards, I and II. 
Divide the class into two divisions, arranged in 
lines, as for spelling down. Pass the I’s to one 
side and the II’s to the other, after choosing an | 
umpire on each side. 
The first pupil in I gives his word, and the one 
on the opposite side who has the synonym, gives 
it. If correct he passes to the head of his line, so 
that he stands opposite his synonym. The first 
one in II now gives his word and the same order 
is followed as on side I, synonyms standing oppo- 
site each other. 
The umpires stand at the foot of their respec- 
tive lines. If a failure is made on either side the 
one failing takes his seat after handing his card 
to his umpire. The umpire must be ready to give - 
all the synonyms he holds when the time for them 
comes.

number standing when all words have been given. 
This game may be played by pupils standing 
beside their seats, the one giving the word and 
the one responding being seated, while those who 
fail remain standing. 
After it becomes somewhat familiar it may be 
varied by the first pupil giving a sentence contain- 
ing his word, and the one holding the synonym 
repeating the sentence, substituting the word he 
has for the one given.

Atm: To accustom children to a variety of 
phrases fittingly used. c 
Mernop: Use the same sentences used for the 
“‘How’’ Game, passing the phrases instead of the 
adverbs. The same method may also be used. 
In older classes the phrases may be passed to 
some pupils and the sentences to others, lines be- 
ing formed as in ‘‘spelling down.’’ The first pupil 
reads a sentence and the ones having appropriate 
phrases, on the opposite side, raise hands, giving 
them in the order in which they stand. The one 
failing hands his card to the teacher and takes 
his seat. Any good combination should be ac- 
cepted, although a phrase may be used more than 
once.

rhythm, and the beauty of poetry. 
Before taking this game, write on the black- 
board simple couplets from several poets, such as, 
“The sun that brief December day 
Rose cheerless over hills of gray.’’ 
from Snow-Bound, and, 
“We may shut our eyes, but we cannot help 
knowing 
That skies are clear, and grass is growing.’’

‘Was bathed in floods of living fire.’’

The daylight fades; fast falls the night, 
The birdies have flown to their nest, 
Come, for all our work is done,

Blue is the sky and soft is the air, 
Over the frozen lake we glide,

  PREFACE 
This course, in its entirety, has been in daily use for nearly three years in the Richard T. Crane Manual Training 
High School, Chicago. The greater part of it has been in use many years longer. It is the result of an experience 
of nearly fifteen years in high school manual training work. 
It was prepared originally to save time spent by a pupil in writing in his shop note book the many helpful 
points suggested by his instructor. Such facts, and even the demonstrations, ought to be at the pupil’s disposal 
for future reference, since young people cannot grasp fully even very slow and careful explanations and demonstra- 
tions involving the use of unfamiliar tools and appliances. 
The description of the equipment and prices and supplies was added to become a part of the boy’s wider 
knowledge of his shop, and in the hope that the items may be helpful to other instructors or schools contemplating 
manual training. 
The short studies on trees and wood are supplemented by lectures on wood, given in the assembly hall, and 
illustrated by two hundred lantern slides, the property of the school. These lectures take up the preservation 
of forests, the effect of forests on rainfall and climate, on floods and drought, tree planting, lumbering, milling, 
transporting, seasoning.

MANUAL TRAINING BENCHES 
Two styles of double benches are shown (fig. 1). 
Thirty-six benches of the first style have been in use 
for several years at the R. T. Crane School—the English 
High and Manual—and have given perfect satisfaction. 
The cost was $40.00 each, including two Tole’s vises. 
The tops are glued up of alternate strips of hard maple 
and cherry, or hard maple and walnut, and each is 
supplied with a Tole’s vise and a tail-screw vise on each 
side. 
The cupboard door swings on L shaped pivots, in the 
center, at the ends, and when open displays the ‘ gen- 
eral” tools conveniently in sight, and still back in the | 
cupboard far enough to prevent striking the knees. 
Three deep, slender pockets, to the right of the door, 
hold the three saws. There is room back of the door 
for two plane stocks, the bench brush, and the bench 
hook. 
as the width of the base of the bench. 
In the second style of bench a sliding door covers the 
cupboard for the “‘ general”’ tools. This style of bench has 
somewhat more drawer room, since the loss in depth, | 
taken off for the cupboard, is more than made up by 
gain in width. 
Three deep pockets, between the drawers and cup- 
boards—as in the other bench—serve to hold the saws. The three drawers are roomy and deep, as deep | WOOD SHOP OUTFIT 
Each bench is outfitted with two sets of “‘general”’ 
tools, for the use of every boy who works at the bench, 
and six sets (the lower bench eight sets) of ‘‘individual”’ 
edged tools, each set for the use of one particular boy 
only, for the whole year. 
The keeping of these tools in perfect condition, es- 
pecially the individual, edged tools, is one of the chief 
features of the boys’ manual training.

   THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
and a Board of Trustees to be constituted as hereinafter provided. Any friend of 
education may become a life-director by the donation of one hundred dollars to the 
Association at one time, either by himself or on his behalf; and any educational 
association may secure a perpetual directorship by a like donation of one hundred 
dollars, the director to be appointed annually or for life. Whenever a life-member 
desires to become a life-director, he shall be credited with the amount he has paid 
for his life-membership. 
Sxo. 2. The President, Vice-Presidents, Secretary, Treasurer, Directors, Life- 
Directors, President of the Council, and presiding officers of their respective depart- 
ments shall constitute the Board of Directors, and, as such, shall have power to 
appeint such committees from their own number as they shall deem expedient. 
Sxc. 3. The elective officers of the Association shall be chosen by ballot, unless 
otherwise ordered, on the second day of each annual session, a majority of the votes 
cast being necessary for a choice. They shall continue in office until the close of 
the annual session subsequent to their election, and until their successors are chosen, 
except as hereinafter provided. 
Sxc. 4. Each department shall be administered by a President, Vice-President, 
Secretary, and such other officers as it shall deem necessary to conduct its affairs; 
but no person shall be elected to any office of any department, or of the Association, 
who is not, at the time of the election, a member of the Association. 
Sxc. 5. The President shall preside at all meetings of the Association and of the 
Board of Directors, and shall perform the duties usually devolving upon a presiding 
officer. In his absence, the first Vice-President in order who is present shall pre- 
side; and in the absence of all Vice-Presidents, a ‘pro tempore chairman shall be 
appointed on nomination, the Secretary putting the question. 
Sxc. 6. The Secretary shall keep a full and accurate report of the proceedings of 
the general meetings of the Association and all meetings of the Board of Directors, 
and shall conduct such correspondence as the Directors may assign, and shall have 
his records present at all meetings of the Association and of the Board of Directors. 
The Secretary of each department shall, in addition to performing the duties usually 
pertaining to his office, keep a list of the members of his department. 
Sxo, 7. The Treasurer shall receive and under the direction of the Board of Trus- 
tees hold in safe keeping all moneys paid to the Association; shall expend the same 
only upon the order of said Board; shall keep an exact account of his receipts and 
expenditures, with vouchers for the latter, which accounts, ending the first day of 
July each year, he shall render to the Board of Trustees, and, when approved by 
said Board, he shall-report the same to the Board of Directors. The Treasurer shall 
give such bond for the faithful discharge of his duties as may be required by the 
Board of Trustees; and he shall continue in office until the first meeting of the 
Board of Directors held prior to the annual meeting of the Association next suc- 
ceeding that for which he is elected. 
Sxo. 8. The Board of Directors shall have power to fill all vacancies in their own 
body; shall have in charge the general interests of the Association, excepting those 
herein intrusted to the Board of Trustees; shall make all necessary arrangements 
for its meetings, and shall do all in its power to make it a useful and honorable in- 
stitution. Upon the written application of twenty members of the Association for 
permission to establish a new department, they may grant such permission. Such 
new department shall in all respects be entitled to the same rights and privileges as 
the others. The formation of such department shall in effect be a sufficient amend- 
ment to this Constitution for the insertion of its name in Article II, and the Secre- 
tary shall make the necessary alterations. 
Sxo. 9. The Board of Trustees shall consist of four members, elected by the
-P-A-G-E-7

Board of Trustees, whether by resignation or otherwise, shall be filled by the Board 
of Directors for the unexpired term; and the absence of a Trustee from two con- 
secutive annual meetings of the Board shall forfeit his membership therein. The 
Board of Trustees thus elected and constituted shall be the executive financial officers

ration under the provisions of the Act of General Incorporation, Class Third, of the 
Revised Statutes of the District of Columbia, dated the twenty-fourth day of Feb-

ing and investment of all funds which the Association may receive from life-direct- 
orships, or from donations; and the income of such invested funds shall be used 
exclusively in paying the cost of publishing the annual volume of Proceedings of 
the Association, excepting when donors shall specify otherwise. It shall also be the 
duty of the Board to issue orders on the Treasurer for the payment of all bills ap- 
proved by the Board of Directors, or.by the President and Secretary of the Associ- 
ation acting under the authority of the Board of Directors; and, when practicable,

random. Matters should be left entirely to the Executive Committee. He 
moved as a substitute that the President, Secretary and Treasurer locate the 
next meeting at St. Paul if all conditions are favorable, and if not, then 
* locate it at some suitable point entirely at their own discretion.

read or printed elsewhere prior to the meeting should be printed in the re- 
ports of the Association.

President be requested to adhere to it strictly, unless an extension was 
granted by previous arrangement with himself, and for good cause. 
Carried.

in the work of the coming year, assurance of which was cordially given.

Dr. C.C. Stratton, Mills Seminary, Cal.; Aaron Gove, Denver, Col.; LeRoy 
D. Brown, Reno, Nev.;— total, four hundred dollars ($400). 
Transferred from receipts for 1888, as per art. IV, sec. 10 of the Consti- 
tution, the sum of eight thousand seven hundred and twenty-five dollars 
($8,725). Total additions made, from the net income of 1888, the sum of 
nine thousand one hundred and twenty-five dollars ($9,125). 
Total Amount of Permanent Fund.—The present amount of the permanent 
fund is twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000). Of this amount the sum of 
twenty-three thousand four hundred and twenty-five dollars is invested as 
stated in the certificate hereunto attached. The remaining fifteen hundred 
and seventy-five dollars, just transferred to the fund, will be duly invested 
at the earliest practicable opportunity. 
Interest—Seyven thousand dollars of the school bonds yield seven per 
cent. interest. The balance of the invested funds yields six per cent. inter- 
est. The interest on all of the school bonds is payable semi-annually, at a 
national bank in New York City; and the bonds are payable, on maturity, 
at the same place. The amount of interest received from the permanent 
fund during the year ending June 30, 1889, was nine hundred and forty- 
three dollars and fifteen cents ($943.15), all of which is included in the 
Treasurer’s report of receipts for this period.

  REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON RESOLUTIONS. 37 
REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON RESOLUTIONS. 
To the National Educational Association : 
The Committee on Resolutions offers the following report: 
Resolved, That universal education is a public necessity in a free government, 
and, as a consequence, is a matter of national interest and concern. Universal 
suffrage without universal education is a national peril. As a necessary means to 
universal education, an efficient public school should be placed within easy reach of 
all American youth—its doors open to all, and its beneficent tuition free to all. 
Resolved, In order that the result expressed in the foregoing resolution may be 
speedily realized throughout the United States, this Association reaffirms its former 
declarations in favor of national aid for public education; and, in view of the long 
delay in granting such aid and the attending increase in population and illiteracy, 
it urges that the appropriations hitherto designated in bills passed by the Senate 
be correspondingly increased. 
Resolved, That the efficiency of the public school is primarily tested by its results 
in moral character, and hence its highest duty is effective moral training. The aim 
of the school is not the training of the mind alone, but the training of the man —the 
forming, ennobling and enriching of manhood: manhood is the highest and best 
product of the school. In the public school, the school of the people and for the 
whole people, moral character must ever stand before intellectual culture. As a 
means to this end, moral training must rise above the mechanical virtues; it must 
touch the conscience, and make it regal in the life; and to this end, it must be per- 
meated and vitalized, as it always has been in the American school, by religious 
sanction and influence. 
Resolved, That we express the hope that this meeting of the Association may 
exert a salutary influence in the settlement of those school questions which are now 
enlisting public interest and discussion, and to this end it is urged that its volume 
of Proceedings, containing, as it will, many able papers and discussions on these 
questions, be as widely distributed as possible. It is recommended that as many as 
one thousand (1,000) extra copies be printed for gratuitous distribution to important 
libraries, leading papers and magazines that give attention to education, and to so- 
cieties devoted to educational reform. 
Resolved, That the executive officers of the Association richly deserve its hearty 
thanks for the able and efficient manner in which they have discharged their duties. 
They have spared neither time nor labor to make this meeting of the Association 
one of the most memorable in its history; and our worthy President is to be con- 
gratulated on presiding at a meeting in which no sectional lines have appeared, and 
which has so happily illustrated the fact that we are one people. 
Resolved, That this Association hereby expresses its high appreciation of the 
generous and hospitable reception extended to it in this beautiful city of the South, 
and especially of the admirable arrangements made for the meetings of the Asso- 
ciation and its several Departments, and for the entertainment and comfort of its 
members — arrangements never excelled in the history of the Association, with pos- 
sibly one exception: those of the California meeting. Our especial and hearty 
thanks are due and are herepy extended to Captain W. R. Garrett, president of the

REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON BUREAU OF EDUCATION. 39 
REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON THE NATIONAL BUREAU OF 
EDUCATION. 
The special committee to whom was referred the need of legislation to 
increase the efficiency and usefulness of the Bureau of Education, beg leave 
to submit the following report: 
The act of Congress creating the Bureau, passed March 2, 1867, estab- 
lished it as an independent Department of Education, and entrusted its 
management to a Commissioner of Education, with a salary of $4,000 per 
annum, 
In 1869, a strong opposition to the new Department of Education mani- 
fested itself in Congress, and the act creating it was so amended as to reduce 
the department to the subordinate position of an “Office of Education” in 
the Department of the Interior, and to make the management of the office 
by the Commissioner “subject to the direction of the Secretary of the In- 
terior,” and the annual salary of the Commissioner was reduced to $3,000. 
Under these unwise limitations the Bureau of Education has been con- 
ducted for nearly twenty years, and the fact that it has been able to render 
such valuable service to the cause of education is due largely to the fidelity 
and self-sacrificing spirit of the men who have filled the position of Com- 
missioner. Few realize the embarrassments which have beset the duties of 
the office, and fewer know how greatly its possible efficiency has been less- 
ened by the lack of official appreciation and adequate pecuniary support. 
But in spite of all limitations and embarrassments, the Bureau of Edu- 
cation has fully justified the wisdom of its creation. Its great value as an 
educational agency of the General Government is no longer questioned by 
anyone who knows its history and work. It has not only furnished needed 
assistance to those entrusted with the organization and conduct of schools 
and school systems, but it has from time to time responded to the calls of 
Congress itself for valuable information on school affairs. 
It is believed that the time has now come when the Bureau of Education 
should be restored to its original position as an independent department, 
and its management be again entrusted to the Commissioner in charge. 
The salary of the Commissioner should be increased to not less than $5,000 
—the present salary of the Commissioner of+Labor, and the recent salary 
of the Commissioner of Agriculture. The position of the Commissioner of 
Education never can assume its proper dignity at the seat of Government 
as long as the Commissioner is obliged to live on the present salary, and it 
is certainly too much to ask the Commissioner to supplement this salary by 
private means.

40 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
The Department of Education should receive an annual appropriation 
sufficient for the efficient discharge of the important duties entrusted to it; 
and all its reports, circulars, and other information respecting educational 
progress, should be promptly published and distributed. The practical 
value of the successive annual reports of the Bureau has been greatly 
' lessened by their tardy issue and circulation. 
It is recommended that a committee be appointed by this body to memo- 
rialize Congress to these ends, and if possible, secure necessary legislation. 
It is also suggested that this committee make an effort to secure such 
supervision of the educational schedules in the next decennial census by 
the Commissioner of Education, as will result in more accurate and valu- 
able statistics in this department.

history of the Council. Present, 34 of the 60 members. 
2. Seven sessions were held, following a program prepared in February 
last. But one failure is to be reported, and for that a satisfactory reason 
was given. The subject-matter assigned to the committee was discussed, so 
that no failure really occurred.

THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON PEDAGOGICAL INQUIRY. 
  To the National Educational Association : 
The Committee on Pedagogical Inquiry begs leave to offer the following 
report: : 
A paper read before this Association last year suggested that this body 
encourage observation and experiment in psychology and pedagogy by giv- 
ing opportunity to persons who were engaged in making such observations 
to present at some general session of this Association brief accounts of the 
work upon which they had been engaged. In accordance with this sugges- 
tion, the following resolutions were introduced: 
Resolved, That at the next meeting of the Association, one of the sessions of the 
general body be set apart for hearing such papers on psychology and pedagogical 
observation as shall have been received and approved by the Executive Committee 
of this Association. 
Resolved, That the President is hereby requested to appoint a committee of three 
to examine such contributions to psychology and pedagogy as may be received, and 
report the same to the Executive Committee with recommendations. 
The notice of the appointment of this committee not reaching its mem- 
bers until the first of January, 1889, thus leaving only two months for its 
work, made the solicitation of such papers impracticable. This committee 
therefore suggested to the Executive Committee that the persons who are to 
speak this morning be invited to present papers on the subjects announced 
upon the program. 
Your committee thinks the educational value of pedagogical observation 
and experiment of sufficient importance to warrant encouragement. The 
program of the American Association for the Advancement of Science is 
made up entirely of papers voluntarily contributed by investigators, and 
"many advances in physical science are doubtless due to ideas suggested by 
such papers. 
But your committee thinks that before any portion of the general pro- 
gram can be profitably made up as proposed, some special encouragement 
must be given to this kind of work. It would, therefore, suggest that the 
President be requested to appoint a committee of those persons who have 
successfully carried on such investigations and are willing to do what they 
can to encourage others to undertake them. It would also suggest that this 
committee be empowered — 
1. To prepare a circular for the volume of Proceedings, indicating im- 
portant lines and methods of investigation. 
2. In the name of the Association to offer a prize of $50 for the best

paper embodying the results of a series of personal observations and experi- 
ments in pedagogy, provided any paper of sufficient merit be presented. 
3. To arrange for the reading before this Association of such of the papers 
presented as are of sufficient value.

REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON NECROLOGY. 
Your committee would respectfully report that they have made every 
effort in their power to ascertain who of our number have been called away 
by death during the past.year. As an Association, we are especially called 
upon to be humbly thankful to our Heavenly Father for His sparing mer- 
cies and His watchful care of the thousands who have heretofore been en- 
tered upon our rolls. With unfeigned thanksgiving, we are’ permitted to 
announce that only a small number of co-workers have received their last 
summons during the year now closed. 
ELI TODD TAPPAN, LL.D.* 
Dr. Tappan was born in Steubenville, Ohio, April 30, 1824, and was the 
son of Judge Benjamin Tappan, a United States Senator from 1839 to 
1845. His early education was obtained in the schools of his native town, 
and from family tutors. His higher education was obtained in St. Mary’s 
College, in Baltimore, Md. Though he left the college in 1842, he received 
from it the degree of A. M. in 1860. He studied law under the late Edwin 
M. Stanton, and was admitted to the bar in 1846. - For about two years he 
published the Ohio Press, and afterwards practiced law in Steubenville for 
about nine years. During this period, he became attracted to the profession 
of teaching. 
In 1851 he married Lydia I. McDowell, of Steubenville. In 1854 he 
delivered his first educational lecture, on “Arithmetic,” before the “Union 
Institute of Teachers, and Friends of Education,’ etc. In this lecture, and 
in subsequent lectures, he put the pedagogical idea in the chief place, and 
showed his thorough knowledge of the underlying principles of teaching, 
which were not generally recognized in that day. In 1856 he entered into 
codperation with the Ohio Teachers’ Association, in which he took a prom- 
inent part. In 1857 he began teaching in Steubenville, and was superin- 
tendent for a short time. In 1859 he was made Professor of Mathematics 
in Ohio University, at Athens. He soon after left this position, and became 
teacher of mathematics in Mt. Auburn Young Ladies’ Institute, during which 
time he wrote his geometry and trigonometry for Ray’s text-books. In 1865 
he was called to the Professorship of Mathematics in Ohio University, which 
position he filled until 1869, when he was elected President of Kenyon Col- 
lege, and remained there until 1875. He then resigned that office, to take 
the chair of mathematics and political economy. He continued in this posi- 
tion until he was chosen to fill the office of State Commissioner of Common

REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON NECROLOGY. 
Schools of Ohio, in 1887. His twenty-two years of school experience fitted 
him eminently for the discharge of the responsibilities of State Superin- 
tendent. In 1866 he was President of the Ohio State Teachers’ Associa- 
tion. For two years, 1880 and 1881, he was the Treasurer of the National 
Educational Association, and was its twenty-second President, in 1883. 
He was from the beginning a member of the National Council of Edu- 
cation. Dr. Tappan was a clear and ready writer, which may be seen in 
his frequent essays-and addresses on educational subjects. The degree of 
LL. D. was conferred upon him by both Williams College and Washington 
and Jefferson College. 
With regard to his religious character, Dr. Hancock says of him: “ Re- 
ligion was wrought into the very fiber of his being. He was for many 
years a member of the Episcopal Church, but no one could be less sectarian, 
or more broadly tolerant of the religious views of others. His was that 
charity that suffereth long and is kind. No one ever lived nearer the line 
of perfect rectitude. He never, for a moment, swerved from that line, even 
under the most trying circumstances. He was the soul of honorable deal- 
ing in every relation of life.’ The transparency of his character was such 
as is seldom seen, and revealed a soul of wonderful strength and purity. 
He was very frank in speech, and never left one in doubt for a moment as 
to what his meaning was. He always met the occasion with perfect cour- 
age, and never lowered his eyes in the presence of any man. He had no 
charity for evasions, or for those who were guilty of them. He hated mean 
men, but his friendship for those he believed worthy was strong and lasting; 
and this friendship was an inspiration to high thinking and doing. 
Dr. Tappan’s health had been somewhat infirm for a year or more, but 
his final illness was short. He died, after ten days’ confinement to his bed, 
of brain paralysis, the result of heart disease, October 23, 1888, and leaves 
a wide space in the ranks of Ohio educators. 
  ALLEN ARMSTRONG. 
Superintendent ArmsTRonG was born in Bellville, Ohio, July 21, 1838, 
and died in Sioux City, Iowa, on the field of his labor, in the latter part of 
the year 1888, and was therefore a little over fifty years old. He was 
made a member of this Association at the first annual meeting, in Cincin- 
nati, in 1858, and has attended most of its annual meetings ever since, tak- 
ing great interest in them as long as he lived. 
The “Memorial” of him prepared by a committee of the Iowa State 
Teachers’ Association, furnishes the following facts: 
“During the last nineteen years we believe he was never absent but once 
from attendance at this Association, and was ever ready to perform faith- 
fully and earnestly every duty imposed upon him by the Association or its 
officers. He-was born at Bellville, Ohio, July 21, 1838, and was conse-

quéntly at the time of his death over fifty years of age. He was a graduate 
of Baldwin University, also of the Ohio State Normal School. 
“The last thirty years of his life were devoted exclusively to educational 
work, and, with the exception of one year, for twenty-one consecutive years 
he filled the office of city superintendent, and twenty of these years he spent 
in the State of Iowa. He became city superintendent at Council Bluffs in 
1868, where he remained until 1876, at which time he was made city super- 
intendent at Sioux City, which place he still held at the time of his death. 
“The members of your committee were so intimately acquainted with 
him, that they feel as if they had not only lost a friend and co-worker, but 
indeed a brother. Those of us who knew him so well can testify that it 
was ever his highest and greatest ambition that his work should be well and 
thoroughly done; no man possessed a keener dislike for superficial work. 
He was ready at all times to raise his voice, in his plain but emphatic 
manner, against everything that even in the slightest degree verged upon 
professional discourtesy. He was, indeed, a true Christian, animated by the 
broadest, warmest Christian charity. His home relations were of the hap- 
piest kind, and no more faithful or earnest friend ever existed than Allen 
Armstrong. During the year 1874 he served as President of this Associa- 
tion, and from the time of its formation to the time of his death he was a 
member of the Educational Council, where he exerted an influence which 
had a most wholesome effect upon its deliberations.” 
The National Educational Association has also lost an earnest friend, a 
true educator, and one of its most valuable members. 
MERRICK LYON, LL.D. 
Dr. Lyon was born in Sturbridge, Mass., April 7, 1815, and died in Prov- 
idence, R. I., on the field of his life’s labors, during the past year, and was’ 
therefore seventy-three years old. The following sketch of him was mostly 
prepared by Mr. W. E. Sheldon: 
Dr. Lyon’s father was a respectable and well-to-do farmer, who had a 
large family, all of whom lived to maturity. Four of his sons received a 
collegiate education. The subject of this memoir prepared for college at 
Hopkins Academy, in Hadley, Massachusetts, and at Worcester Academy, 
in Massachusetts. He entered Brown University in 1836, and graduated 
in 1841. He immediately began his life-work of teaching, in Rhode Island, 
and continued it without interruption for forty-seven years, and until a 
few weeks before his death. 
He was, for forty-three years, one of the principals of the University 
Grammar School, which was a sort of preparatory department of Brown 
University. His entire life was devoted to preparing boys for college. He 
was sincerely devoted to “sound learning,” and was several times offered 
 
-P-A-G-E-47
  REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON NECROLOGY. AT 
professorships in colleges— once, in the University of Michigan, but he in- 
variably declined these positions. 
In 1855 he occupied the chair in Greek, in Brown University. In 1873 
he traveled extensively in Great Britain, and on the continent, and was ap- 
pointed “honorary commissioner” to the “ World’s Fair” at Vienna. He 
was always interested in whatever related to matters of education, and the 
welfare of city and State where he resided. He was a member of the Com- 
mon Council of Providence in 1855, and was chairman of the committee on 
education. 
For more than thirty years he was an active and an efficient member of 
the school board of Providence, doing a great amount of gratuitous labor, 
thereby meriting and receiving the gratitude of his fellow-citizens. He was 
President of the Rhode Island Institution of Instruction in 1873 and 1874, 
and was also President of the American Institute of Instruction in 1875 
and 1876. He was Trustee of Brown University for three years, and from 
1877 to his death was a member of the Board of Fellows of this renowned 
institution of learning. 
During the whole of his active life he was prominent in all kinds of re- 
ligious work, and especially in the Baptist denomination. For thirty years 
he held the office of deacon, and at the time of his death he was connected 
with the Union Baptist church, of Providence, and was President of the 
society. : 
He was married August 23, 1842, to Miss Caroline Brown, daughter of 
Dr. Nicholas Jenks, of Middleborough, Mass. She died a year before him, 
leaving two daughters. His death takes from us a staunch friend of sound 
learning. 
MICHAEL WILLIAM SMITH, A.M. 
Micuaret Wi111AM Samira was born of Irish parentage, at Port Robin- 
son, Canada West, October 14, 1836. While he was yet a child, he removed 
with his parents to Ohio, where he grew up to manhood. He lived for sev- 
eral years in Cincinnati, and received an important part of his early educa- 
tion in the schools of that city. Having completed a preparatory course 
of study, he entered the University of Nashville, at that time presided over 
by General Bushrod Johnson, and was graduated with the highest honors 
from the military department of that institution in the class of 1856. Im- 
mediately after graduation he went South, and taught for two years as a 
private tutor in a planter’s family on Bayou Teche, in Louisiana. He then 
returned North, was married, and taught for a time in the public school of 
Defiance, Ohio, after which he removed to New Harmony, Ind., where he 
opened a private school. It was while he was engaged here that the War 
of the Rebellion broke out. 
He at once left his school, and enlisted in the 15th Indiana Infantry, of 
which he was made adjutant, and served with his regiment in West Vir-

ginia. He was soon transferred to the 1st Ohio Cavalry, in which he held 
the rank of major. He was with this regiment until June, 1862, when, his 
health failing, he resigned and returned home. Having in a measure re- 
covered his health, he engaged in teaching in a military institute situated 
at Fulton, in northern Illinois. In the spring of 1864 he entered the 
hundred-day service as lieutenant colonel of the 140th Hlinois Infantry, 
Before the expiration of his term he was appointed colonel of the 66th 
Colored Infantry, and joined his regiment at Duvall’s Bluff, Arkansas. He 
continued in command of this regiment until the spring of 1866, when 
he was mustered out, and returned again to his profession of teaching, in 
northern Illinois. He remained here as teacher and as County Superin- 
tendent of Whiteside county until September, 1874, when he received the 
appointment of Instructor in English Literature in the Hughes High 
School of Cincinnati. He found here congenial work, in which he labored 
with unremitting zeal till the time of his death. He died of consumption, 
complicated with other maladies contracted in the army, on the 26th of 
May, 1889. Although he had long been in feeble health, he was absent 
from his regular duties but five weeks. He was twice married. His second 
wife and three daughters survive him. : 
As a man, he was genial, frank, sincere, and straightforward. As a 
teacher, he was patient, painstaking, and thoroughly devoted to his profes- 
sion. He wrought: out a method of teaching English literature that was 
peculiarly his own, and by means of which he awakened the enthusiasm of 
his classes and accomplished very flattering results. This method he em- 
bodied in his work entitled “Studies in English Literature,” designed as a 
text-book in that subject, and also in his “ Elements of English,” prepared 
as an introduction to the larger work. Mr. Smith was by taste and choice, 
as well as by natural aptitude, a teacher, and he will long be kindly re- 
membered by those associated with him and by the large number of students 
who have enjoyed the advantage of his instruction. 
FRANCIS W. PARSONS. 
Francis W. Parsons, for some years a member of this Association, was 
born in Buffalo, N. Y., in 1840, and died at Tuscumbia, Ala., July 5, 1889. 
He was educated at Fort Plain Seminary, Fort Plain, N. Y., and afterward 
taught in Boscobel and Hurricane Grove, Wisconsin. 
nin 1861, at the opening of the war, at the first call for troops, he went 
out as adjutant of the Milwaukee Light Guards for three months’ time. 
Being discharged at the end of his term of service, he reénlisted as lieu- 
tenant of Company I, 91st New York Infantry. He was in the battles 
of Manassas, Culpepper Court-house, and many other equally important 
engagements, being with General Banks all through the Red river expedi- 
tion, in Opelousas county, and finally at Port Hudson. He was wounded

  four times: once in Virginia, and three times during the siege of Port Hud- 
son, in May, 1863. After three months in the barracks hospital at New 
Orleans, Mr. Parsons was taken to his home at Niagara Falls, where it was 
ten months before he was able to be about, even then walking on crutches, 
which he was obliged to use for the next three years. In the fall of 1864 
he was married to Louise A. Shaw, at Pekin, N. Y. 
The nature of his wounds disabling him from more active physical labor,’ 
he turned his attention to educational work, for which he seems to have been 
peculiarly fitted. His name is well known in Wisconsin, Illinois, Kansas, 
Missouri, Nebraska, Texas and Alabama, in which States he has labored as 
teacher, superintendent and institute conductor with marked success. In 
connection with his school work, he found time to study law, and was ad- 
mitted to the bar of Missouri in 1888. 
During the last three years of his life, his old wounds became very trouble- 
some, and, finding that the Southern climate agreed with him better than 
that of the North, in the fall of 1888 he left Missouri and accepted a posi- 
tion as Superintendent of the Tuscumbia city schools. He immediately 
began a reorganization of the schools, which had been rather neglected for 
some years. Through his influence, a bill was passed by the Legislature, 
enabling the city to bond itself for the erection of suitable school buildings. 
Mr. Parsons was selected by the school board to draft the plans for the new 
building; these plans were accepted, and under his personal supervision 
the grading was completed and the foundation walls were well under way 
at the time of his death. 
A friend who knew him well says: “Mr. Parsons was a man of large 
resources, untiring industry, never-flagging persistence and determination 
of purpose, and withal a thorough gentleman of many social and literary 
accomplishments. Strong in his conviction of right, failure was to him 
unknown; the greater the obstacle, the greater the strength developed to 
combat and overcome it.” 
Mr. Parsons leaves a wife and five children, who are at present residing 
at California, Missouri. 
BENAIAH G. ROOTS.* 
Benaran G. Roors was born in Onondaga county, New York, April 20, 
1811, and died at his home near Tamaroa, IIl., May 8, 1888, aged 77 years. 
He.commenced teaching in 1827, and continued in the work until his death, 
thus having completed a period of over sixty years. To Illinois and her 
teachers has been given the rich fruit.that has followed the labors of more 
than fifty of these years. In 1839 he began to teach in Perry county. It 
would be a work of supererogation to enumerate the labors, the trials and 
the triumphs of this half-century of earnest and faithful effort. They are 
the wonder and admiration of this commonwealth.

THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  It is worth while, however, for us to stop and think of the surroundings 
of the man who thus pushed on high ideals. In a new and sparsely-settled 
country education is, of necessity, a matter of secondary consideration. 
The wants of the body are of prime necessity. Houses must be built, farms 
opened, and mills erected. In all such work our friend did valiant service; 
but he did not stop with these things. It is an old legend, that where the 
fruits of culture are to grow, there must be leisure and wealth. The primal 
prairies of Illinois afforded neither. Notwithstanding these disadvantages, 
he at once commenced to plan for building up human character and vital- 
izing the general intelligence of the community. The homes of the early 
settlers contained but few “spare rooms;” but the dwelling of Father Roots 
was large enough for a school-house. Into it were gathered the children of 
his neighbors. It is probable that this school had but few of the modern 
appliances, but it can be said that it had what many a modern school lacks 
—a living teacher. 
In later years this school developed into an institution of higher grade, 
where many received an education that admirably fitted them to do life’s 
work well. It is the universal testimony of the pupils of this school, that 
it gave inspiration and lofty aims to those who came within its influence. 
But the labors of our friend did not end with this home school. His 
power and influence extended over the State, and in consequence he became 
one of the founders of the free-school system of Illinois. He helped to 
organize the State Teachers’ Association, and was chosen its fifth president 
at the meeting held at Decatur in 1857. From that time till his death he 
missed scarcely a meeting of that body. He worked earnestly with voice 
and pen to secure the establishment of our two Normal universities. 
In February, 1865, the Governor appointed him a member-of the State 
Board of Education, and he continued to fill the position by successive 
reappointments until his death. It is safe to say that no one took a deeper 
interest in its proceedings or wielded a more potent influence in shaping its 
policies. The pupils and teachers at Normal came to regard him as indeed 
a father to the institution. He was always ready with a kindly word to 
reward the successful or to strengthen those who needed encouragement. 
It is not necessary to enter into fuller particulars. It is safe to say that 
B. G. Roots rendered invaluable services to the cause of education in this 
State. No movement has been inaugurated during the past fifty years for 
the improvement of the means or methods of popular education that did 
not receive his cordial support and aid. He never “sulked in his tent,” but 
was ever ready to “lend a hand,” whoever might lead. 
The lessons of his life are worthy the thoughtful consideration of every 
young man and woman who contemplates becoming a teacher. “ Patient 
continuance in well-doing” was the motto of his life. He was never too 
old to learn. He never wearied in discussing with those who had the 
pleasure of his friendship the various methods proposed for the improve-

ment of the schools. Although his special field was the primary school, 
yet his mind was broad enough to take in the whole field of education. By 
a careful reading of educational journals and a constant attendance upon 
teachers’ meetings, he kept himself fully abreast with the discussions of 
this busy age. He was always ready to learn. His enthusiasm was the 
wonder and admiration of his friends. He was never discouraged; if a 
favorite measure met an undeserved defeat to-day, he was ready to cham- 
pion it on the morrow. 
But he was not a teacher only—as a churchman, he never wavered in 
his loyalty to that body of Christian believers to which he had so long been 
attached; in Sabbath schools and temperance organizations his voice was 
always heard in favor of earnest and progressive work; as a citizen, he be- 
lieved in equal and exact justice to all. When the name of “Abolitionist” 
was a term of reproach in Illinois, he was not afraid to espouse the cause 
of the colored man, and to insist that he should receive all the rights which 
the laws of the land vouchsafed to him. 
We shall not appreciate the full worth of this man if we do not recall 
the home life which he lived. It was not my privilege to know the mother 
of his children, but I-did know and esteem that noble Christian woman 
who walked by his side during these later years. It was our good fortune 
to be permitted to entertain them frequently at our house. The remem- 
brance of the chivalric devotion of one to the other has been a perpetual 
benediction in our home. I believe that I am a kinder, more patient and 
better husband and father because of the example thus brought before me. 
Permit me, in closing this address, to quote— 
“With weary hand, yet steady will, 
In old age as in youth, 
Thy Master found thee sowing still 
The good seed of his truth. 
“As on thy task-field closed the day 
In golden-skied decline, 
His angel met thee on the way, 
And lent his arm to thine. 
“Thy latest care for man—thy last 
Of earthly thought a prayer — 
Oh, who thy mantle, backward cast, 
Is worthy now to wear?”

REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON EXHIBITS. 
  Your committee beg leave to say that they have examined, as carefully 
as the limited time would admit, all material placed on exhibition. While 
the amount and variety of work shown is not large, the quality-in most 
cases is excellent, and in many cases very superior. 
Kindergarten Exhibits—In Kindergarten work the Springfield, Mass., 
public schools, the Forestville public schools, Chicago, Miss Trousdale’s 
Kindergarten, of Nashville, and Mrs. Whorley’s, of South Nashville, as 
well as the Louisville Free Kindergarten, exhibit good work, both by chil- 
dren and by pupil-teachers. 
Mrs. Hailman, of La Porte, Ind., has an exhibit of work from her Train- 
ing School for Kindergartners, including all the different varieties done by 
her pupils, which is probably the most complete and artistic display of the 
kind yet made. While all of her exhibit was new and original in charac- 
ter and design, the work of Miss Viola Ewers, of Milton, Ind., and that of 
Miss Carrie Friedman, of La Porte, Ind., seems to deserve special mention. 
The exhibit made by Miss Emma Marwedel, of the Pacific Kindergarten 
Training School, San Francisco, was also very full and very creditable, 
especially her color charts and the work of the children instructed by the 
use of them, and the wood-work cut out by the knife. All of this work, 
with much other, she calls the “missing link” between the kindergarten 
and the schools. 
Nashville Public Schools, Nashville, Tennessee.—This was probably the 
fullest display on exhibition, and was certainly very creditable. It con- 
sisted of a large collection of drawings and bound volumes of examination 
papers from all the different grades, including the high school. Photo- 
graphs of all the public and private school buildings in the city of Nash- 
ville were an interesting feature of the exhibit. 
The Oregon Exhibit.—This consisted of free-hand and mechanical draw- 
ings, crayon work, and work in geography and history, from the Roseburgh 
and Baker City public schools and from the Portland high school. The 
State Agricultural College sent specimens of the first year’s work in crayon 
and pencil-drawing. The major portion of the exhibit was furnished by 
the Portland high school — Miss E. §. Sabin, city superintendent, and Miss 
Turner, drawing teacher. 
» The Evanston Township High School, Cook County, Iiltinois—This school 
showed a fine collection of drawings in zodlogy, physiology, historical orna- 
ment, and work from casts and other objects.
-P-A-G-E-53
  REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON EXHIBITS. 53 
The Higbee School, Memphis, Tennessee—The work from this school in- 
cluded language lessons; color and form lessons, illustrated by modeling and 
water-color pictures; object studies from nature, toys and other objects; also, 
geography and history lessons, and lessons on cotton, rice and flax, illustrated 
by drawings. Relief maps in putty, chemistry studies illustrated, note-books 
bound, some very beautiful pieces of wood-carving on frames, and some flat- 
surface designs, with much other beautiful and creditable work, completed 
this fine display. 
The Montgomery Bell Academy, Nashville, Tennessee—This institution 
showed some beautiful work in map-drawing, and a case of fine geological 
specimens from their cabinet. 
The Cook County Normal School, Englewood, Illinois —The exhibit from 
this school included some very fine relief maps in putty and plaster of 
Paris— twenty-six different maps, ranging in size from 22x28 inches to 
52x56 inches; six volumes of lesson plans to be used in training classes, 
being original papers treating of the following subjects: one volume on 
geography, one on physics, one on literature, one on universal history, and 
two on ancient history; specimens of class work in the eighth grade of the 
public schools; also, samples of work in drawing and making proper, be- 
sides a large collection of water colors in history and botany, and colored 
drawings illustrating geology. 
The Santee Normal Training School, Santee Agency, Nebraska.—This dis- 
play consisted of samples of the work of the pupils in metal, wood, leather, 
and other materials. There were also some bound volumes of examination 
and class papers. 
The Nashville College for Young Ladies.—This college showed bound vol- 
umes of examination papers and daily class work, all grades of the institu- 
tion being represented. ; 
Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee—In this exhibit appeared a show- 
case containing the different mathematical instruments used by the pupils 
in their work and the tools used in the School of Carpentry. The plats in 
surveying done by the pupils were very creditable; also, the work in botany, 
the patch-work and other needle-work from the model school, and the 
chemicals made by the pupils in the laboratory. Thirteen bound volumes 
of examination papers from all grades in the college gave a good idea of 
the work accomplished there. ‘ 
Straight University, New Orleans—This display contained specimens of 
needle-work done by the pupils, both plain and ornamental. Of the work 
in wood, a desk made by a boy is deserving of special notice. 
Watkins Institute, Nashville—In addition to the above, the art depart- 
ment of Watkins Institute had a very fine display in their art rooms, con- 
sisting of drawings from casts and still life, and work done by the sketching 
club.

  54 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  
The Prang Educational Company, Boston—This company showed work 
done by their classes instructed by correspondence; also, samples of models 
and other supplies kept by them. 
Dixon's Crucible and Pencil Company, New Jersey, made a very fine dis- 
play of pencils. 
M. A. Olmsted, Chicago.—In this exhibit were shown Johnson’s wall 
maps; relief maps; globes; sixty-five natural-history plates, to be used in 
the study of natural history, composition and drawing; twelve industrial 
charts, to be used in composition exercises and oral instruction in the in- 
dustries; also, geological and botanical charts, dissected geometrical blocks, 
and many things which cannot be noted. 
Mr. Smith, of Peoria, Illinois, had on exhibition Smith’s American Man- 
ikin, which has removable metal plates, making it easy to handle and dur- 
able in use. 
The following Publishing Companies made displays of educational books 
and papers, music books and charts, school books, etc.: A. Hanagan, Chi- 
cago; E. L. Kellogg, New York and Chicago; Ellsworth, New York; Silver - 
Burdett & Co., Boston; R. 8. King Publishing Company, Chicago; Good- 
year & Palmer, Cedar Rapids, Iowa; and D. F. Ames & Co., New York.

  OPENING SESSION. 
ADDRESSES OF WELCOME. 
HON. ROBERT L. TAYLOR, GOVERNOR OF TENNESSEE. 
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen of the National Educational Associ- 
ation: Tennessee, with open doors, receives the nation’s professors to-day, 
and with open arms the ladies. In the name of all the people, I bid you 
welcome, thrice welcome, to our hearts, our hearths, and our homes. 
We are happy to greet you, not alone to be honored by so distinguished a 
body of men and women, and not alone for the privilege of being permitted 
to aid in the consummation of the exalted’ purposes which you have in view; 
but also that we may know you personally, and that you may learn some- 
thing of our people, our institutions and our country; that you may see 
this God-favored land, where fruits and flowers in rich luxuriance grow, 
aud where majors and colonels and sweet politicians bloom and blossom 
like the rose forevermore. 
We are especially delighted to welcome you, because we believe that this 
great meeting will-bind us together in a closer and more intimate relation- 
ship and fraternity of spirit, and will powerfully convince and impress us 
with the great truth that we are one people with a common destiny, and 
_ With interests inseparable. This immense presence, and the eminent char- , 
acter of its constituents, impresses me as a wonderfully conclusive demon- 
stration of the fact that the thought of the country is rapidly and grandly 
progressing in the great field of education. Improvement in method, and 
the marvelous achievement and development all along the line of educa- 
tional effort within the past quarter of a century, are glorious evidences of 
the advancement of our civilization and the perpetuity of our government. 
All honor to the teachers of America! Like the light of the morning, 
they bring to our homes the blessings of health, happiness and life; and to 
the nation they bring prosperity and peace. 
Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, the peculiar work committed to 
your charge as an Association is, to infuse a broad national fraternity of 
sentiment and feeling into our educational system; and this happy meeting 
of so many educators of broad and comprehensive views, this bringing to- 
gether of the representatives of widely separated localities and divergent in- 
terests and opinions, is the wisest and best movement that could have been 
(87) 
   
-P-A-G-E-58
    58 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  
inaugurated to reach that result. The nation will be stronger, and the 
people happier and more prosperous, as society approaches that ideal state 
of solidity and harmony of sentiment and effort which wipes out sectional 
lines and local prejudices, and makes us one and inseparable. Teach the 
rising generation that we are one people, with one destiny, with equal duties 
and equal privileges; that obligation is reciprocal; that as the harmony of 
the spheres is the absence of friction, so the harmony of humanity is the 
absence of conflict and hatred; that the whole fabric of our beautiful sys- 
tem of free government can. rest alone upon an enlightened Christian public 
opinion. 
In this lovely city, Mr. President, you will find the waters of knowl- 
edge flowing freely. It is the “Athens of the South,” because its institutions 
of learning are unexcelled and the énthusiasm of its people is unequaled ; 
and all over the State, from the mountains that kiss the eastern skies to 
the plains that border the Father of Waters, the fountains forever flow. 
The people are athirst for the blessings of education. Our teachers are 
alert and at work, and there is a grand harmonious movement throughout 
our State to elevate the standard of education, and to extend its blessings 
to all, which gives prophecy of a new régime: a more solid foundation upon 
which society may build the fabric of her institutions, and upon which the 
State may more securely rest. 
Ladies and gentlemen of the National Educational Association, I present 
you with the keys of this city and with the end of the latch-string of all the 
doors of the people of the Volunteer State. I invite you to go, when you 
would rest from your labors here, and climb our mountain-peaks that bathe 
their towering heads in the violet morning, and look out upon as rich a 
heritage as God ever gave to man. I invite you to walk out into our fertile 
valleys, where Nature in her most lavish mood has decked the land with 
richest fruitage; to drink deeply of the crystal waters and bare your brows 
to the softest zephyrs that sweep up from flower-land, and to enjoy the hos- 
pitality of our happy people. 
“Again I welcome you to the land of the free and the home of the brave.

North, South, East, and ocean-bound West 
Amongst us now has each an honored guest; 
Then ring out, bells, your most jubilant chimes

Naught do we withhold; but place in your reach 
All the goods that our Father has so 
Lavishly bestowed on His creatures below.

Education’s the altar at which*all sacrifice, 
Do duty, pay homage, and, like incense, arise 
Universal prayers; for ’tis now, as in days of old, 
Centuries past, are gathered the good, the brave, and the bold. 
Athens, the seat of learning, of science and arts, 
To her center would, from the world’s greatest marts, 
Inyite men of letters—pupils, tutors and sages — 
On whose intellect, works, wisdom and valor were wages; 
Not chiefly for value, but for honor conferred, 
As the victor was crowned for excellence or power preferred, 
Let it be physical or mental, for both were revered. 
And unto this “Athens of the South” you have come, 
Seeking honor and good for a Nation, now one; 
States bound by the bonds of brotherly love and devotion, 
One great people swept by the same noble emotion. 
Channels for thought will be opened, and through them will flow, 
In fullest fruition, the current to lands that lie low; 
As the clouds arrested by towering crags and peaks 
To disperse their fullness, which then flows and creeps 
In by-way places and to thousand valleys, giving 
One source of life, one free-born gift of Heaven— 
Naught is more like than the master-minds of learning. 
New impulse thus inspired, and genius will arise 
Above the ten-fold barriers youth’s modesty supplies; 
Such make the paths green that lead beside 
Heaven’s stream of knowledge-—a crystal tide. 
Virtue and intelligence must go hand in hand 
If society is to exist or government in the land; 
Let us mark and remember what this obligation entails — 
Learning without honor, truth and justice fails ; 
Education, with religion and virtue, prevails. 
To the “sons and daughters of the golden West,” 
Eastern brothers and sisters along with the rest; 
Northern, also, as broad and as vast as our main— 
Nashville bids you all welcome, thrice welcome again! 
Ere you leave us we trust that you still can maintain 
Southern homes and hospitality are not merely a name; 
So, with cordial friendship, we give you our hand, 
Earnestly hoping that this meeting may ever stand 
Educationally, nationally, socially, the first in the land. 
HON. C. P. M’CARVER, MAYOR OF NASHVILLE. 
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen of the Association: It is my pleas- 
ant duty and honor, on behalf of the citizens of Nashville, to tender to you 
a kindly greeting, and to welcome you to our city. I will not undertake to 
tell you of the many advantages we claim for our section and city; but I 
will say that we believe that Tennessee is destined to be one of the grandest 
States in the Union, and that her capital is, and will be, the greatest city in 
the South.

We believe that our public-school system equals that of any city in the 
country. Weare proud of our schools and colleges. Our teachers have 
the confidence and esteem of our people, which was thoroughly demonstrated 
by their response to the call of the committee when it announced the fact 
that the National Educational Association had accepted an invitation to 
hold its annual session in Nashville. When our local committee informed 
our citizens that the hotels of the city might fail to accommodate the vast 
multitude that would be in attendance, they replied: “Our doors are open ; 
bring them on; we will take care of them.” ‘This did not come from one 
class or one section, but from all classes and from every section of the city. 
This fact alone speaks more welcome to the teachers who have met here 
to-day, than any words that can be uttered. I feel that this city, in wel- 
* coming you as it does through her mayor, has given you a grander assur- 
ance of welcome than any words at my command, in the fact that she is the 
educational Athens of the South; and in her schools, colleges and univer- 
sities she has provided for the culture and tuition of her youth of every 
race and every color. 
I hereby tender to you the hospitalities, and give into your custody the 
keys of our capital city, assuring you of our friendship and profound esteem. 
TENNESSEE'S MESSAGE OF WELCOME. 
MISS DOLLY FINNEGAN, NASHVILLE. 
Traveling through the marts all burdened 
With the fruit of manhood’s toil; 
Through the fields where nature showers 
Richest gifts o’er Southland soil, 
Come you from the “Land of Flowers ”— 
From the haunt of Hiawatha— 
And our hearts unite in greeting — 
Filled with joy at such a meeting. 
“Welcome!” proudly shout the people— 
Echo gladly answers “Come!” 
Bounding from our eastern mountains, 
Murmuring in our eity’s hum, 
Bubbling up in lovely fountains 
Where our western river rushes, 
Comes the message forth to greet you, 
“Tennessee is proud to meet you.” 
Sits she on a throne of honor, 
Famous for her children’s deeds; 
Shows with pride the long, unbroken 
Record of their wondrous meeds. 
Yet is ever free, outspoken 
In her praise of noble action; — 
Northern genius, Western daring, 
Ever hold for her attraction.

  ADDRESSES OF WELCOME. 61 
Glorious tribute to old Wisdom 
Is this vast, assembled throng; 
Men and women still are toiling 
To arrest the tide of wrong. 
And not one is found recoiling 
From the awful, surging billows; 
Looking o’er the ranks this hour, 
Think you knowledge is not power? 
Labor omnia vincit! hear the 
Cry resound so loud and clear; 
On each brow is writ a purpose 
Sacred to the heart, and dear. 
As the years their course are winging, 
Each its special duties bringing, 
May that purpose find its answer 
In‘the heart of every youth; 
Till proudest of all flags shall be— 
Waving o’er a land of truth— 
The stars and stripes of Liberty. 
W. R. GARRETT, CHAIRMAN OF THE LOCAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE. 
Fellow-Members of the National Educational Association: The Governor 
of Tennessee has greeted you in the name of the citizens of the State; the 
Mayor of Nashville has expressed to you the pleasure which your visit af- 
fords to the people of the city; the Superintendent of Public Instruction 
has offered to you the welcome of the teachers of Tennessee; a representa- 
tive of the ladies has spoken to you in poetic words; and on behalf of the 
Local Executive Committee, I appear as a witness to testify to the sincerity 
of the sentiments which have been expressed. 
For the past eight months, the members of our committee have performed 
a double office. As your representatives, we have looked to the interests of 
the Association; as the agents of our own home people, we have labored 
on their behalf to perfect the local arrangements for your reception. It 
has been to us a source of congratulation and pleasure that these two offices 
have been harmoniously blended. The sentiments which have been’ ex- 
pressed by those who have preceded me are not suddenly inspired by the 
presence of this vast and grand assembly. For many months our people 
have looked forward with cordial anticipations to your visit. All classes of 
our citizens— not teachers only, but our business men, our professional 
men, our ministers of the gospel, and the entire corps of the press—have 
evinced the liveliest interest in this meeting, and have aided us in our prep- 
arations. Our young men have entered upon the work of reception with 
enthusiasm, and have prepared, at West Side Park, a military encampment 
to emphasize your welcome, to which I am requested to invite your attend- 
ance. We have received assistance from another source, which doubtless 
you have already suspected, but I believe you will hear it confirmed with

especial pleasure. The ladies have cheered us with unfaltering sympathy 
and invaluable aid. They have formed clubs and sociéties to provide for 
your entertainment, and they have manifested their interest in many ways. 
I have exposed these secrets of the committee-room, for the purpose of 
showing that the hearts of our people are open to you, and that all our 
words of welcome are sincere. 
We welcome you not only as teachers, not only as brethren in the great 
work of education, but we welcome you as friends and as guests. Our peo- 
ple wish to greet you not only in formal utterances from the speakers’ stand. 
Mingled in this immense concourse, our citizens are among you. They will 
wait for no formal introductions, but will welcome you individually and 
socially. They wish to welcome you in their homes, and to form your per- 
sonal acquaintance. 
The barbecue introduces you to one phase of Southern social life. It is 
said to be a peculiarly Southern institution. Ido not know how true this 
may be, but I do know it is typical of Southern life. The barbecue is not 
only, as defined in dictionaries, ‘an animal roasted whole:” it is some- 
thing more. It includes rural scenery, the open air, the canopy of heaven, 
and social enjoyment. We can have no barbecue in the crowded limits of 
the city, or in the fashionable park, where nature has been expelled by art. 
The Southern people were originally a rural people, and with the recent 
development of their cities they have not outgrown their strong rural tastes, 
and may they never outgrow them. They love to select a spot where the 
trees were not planted by the hand of man, where the spade has never 
turned the soil, and where the landscape gardener has not dressed nature 
in gaudy ornaments. In such a place they love to assemble, to recline on 
the grass beneath the shade of the trees, and to mingle in social intercourse 
as free and untrammeled as the scene they witness, and the air they breathe. 
Our committee have chosen such an occasion and such a scene as a fitting 
place where our citizens may form the acquaintance of their guests, and 
‘where we ourselves may lay down our temporary authority. 
RESPONSES. 
THE PRESIDENT OF THE ASSOCIATION. 
Mr. Chairman, Your Excellency, and Ladies and Gentlemen: I thank you 
on behalf of the National Educational Association of the United States, 
for the kind words with which you have welcomed us, and for the ample 
provisions you have made for our entertainment. We are glad to assemble 
in the beautiful city of Nashville, famed throughout the country for its 
institutions of learning, and for the culture and refinement of its citizens; 
we are glad to meet in the State of Tennessee, the home of two Presidents, 
and the first State to give us a President emphatically for the people —that

man of iron nerve, Andrew Jackson; we are glad to come together as a 
body for the fourth time in the South, for this body has met at Louisville, 
in Atlanta, and once before in Nashville. 
This section of the country has been much maligned, especially for its 
climate. People at the North, the East, and the West, have hot weather 
in July; and when the mercury stands 90° they make the mistake of always 
thinking that it is ten or fifteen degrees higher in the South. We find here 
no less comfort than in our far New England or Minnesota homes, and we 
propose to tell our friends about it. Nor is this the only wrong impression 
that prevails, more or less, in the remote sections of our country about the 
people of this. 
To know you, to feel the warm pressure of your hands, and to partake of 
the savory roasted fat ox, to listen to your public addresses and to sit in 
friendly conversation by your side and partake of your generous hospitality, 
opens to us a new view of your character and purposes, and binds us in 
friendship and love to you. And, in like manner, as you become more and 
more acquainted with the real character and purposes of the communities 
which we represent, you will, I doubt not, be warmed with a new feeling of 
admiration and love. 
The trouble is, that remote sections of our Union, if they do not visit each 
other and mingle freely with each other, often take that to be representative 
which is not so. For example, it would be unfortunate for you to take the 
great John L. Sullivan as a representative of his State of New York. 
At its meeting here in 1868 the National Educational Association was a 
feeble infant. I doubt if many citizens remember that meeting; but like the 
infant Hercules, it possessed the elements of power; it was organized by men 
possessed of a great idea—the importance of universal education—men 
who are still on the ground, and whose names are known on two continents. 
And now this body is numbered by the 10,000; it has met in Chicago, it 
has crossed the continent and met on the'shores of the Pacific, where the 
meeting under my immediate predecessor, President Gove, was unparalleled 
in the history of this or any other similar body. 
The favorable auspices under which we now meet here are due, your Ex- 
cellency and Mr. Chairman, to your untiring efforts in our behalf, and to 
the cordiality of the people of this city and neighborhood. If we do not 
enjoy ourselves, it will not be your fault. From the results so far shown 
there is no room for doubt that this will be a profitable meeting, and that 
every section of the country will alike be benefited; for the discussions and 
proceedings of the National Educational Association will be distributed to 
all parts of the country. 
THE SECRETARY OF THE ASSOCIATION. * 
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: We are here to-day because of a 
unity of thought and a unity of purpose; because we recognize that in this

land there is no king, but that there are sixty million sovereigns; because 
we believe that in a free country its future, its safety, rests back upon no 
favored class; but upon all the people. We are here to-day because we 
understand that in a free country intelligence is the only safeguard; because 
we believe that the life of this nation lies along the great middle line of the 
intelligence of the masses, and that every man who can be lifted above 
that line at any time or at any point lifts the whole line higher; because, 
as a free country, we are facing problems magnificent and grand and awe- 
inspiring; and because we know that without intelligence a free State ceases 
to exist. : 
We believe to-day that education is cheaper than a military system. We 
believe to-day that education is cheaper than police. We believe to-day in 
schools rather than in penitentiaries. We believe to-day that the State must 
educate, or the State must perish. - : 
And we are here because we propose to dedicate our lives, all that we are 
or hope to be, to the service of a movement of this character, without which 
no nation can endure. We are here to-day from the North, the South, the 
East, and the West, in order that we may uplift the standard of intelligence 
and instruction, and in order that the teacher and his vocation may stand, 
as it should, among the most honored of the land. : We are here to-day be- 
cause we believe that the pen is mightier than the sword. And we are here 
because, thank God, the sword is sheathed, and sheath and hilt are entwined 
with the garlands of an everlasting peace. 
History brings to all people, the fairest and the bravest and the wisest 
and the truest, reverses. Time is the great healer, however, and time again 
and again reverses the verdict and the situation. To-day, people of Nash- 
ville, of Tennessee, and of the South, the reverse has come to us. You have 
made the “movement upon our works,” and it is with us to make the “un- 
conditional surrender.” 
W. E. SHELDON, OF MASSACHUSETTS. 
Mr. Chairman and Friends: There are special occasions in our lives when 
we are brought into such relationships with those animated by kindred aims 
and purposes that they give us inspiration, uplift our feelings into the realm 
of oneness and congeniality and fill our hearts with supreme delight and 
satisfaction, and this “unique” festival of educators from all sections of our 
Republic is one of that nature. We feel with Pope as though we were as “a 
whole barbecued.” For thirty years this association. has held its meetings 
in different sections of the United States, and has everywhere been received 
as a power for good in schools. It was our pleasant privilege in 1884 to 
extend the.greetings of the friends of education of the “land of the Pil- 
grims” to the multitude of educators who gathered five years ago in the 
charming city of Madison, Wis., nestled among the beautiful lakes of that 
State, where began a remarkable series of great meetings of the National
-P-A-G-E-65

Educational Association. Two years later we again voiced the greetings 
and congratulations of the representatives of the East at Topeka, Kan., the 
enterprising capital city of the great prairie State. Two years ago, as some ~ 
here will remember, we spent a few warm days in the great City of the — 
Lakes—that marvel of enterprise and growth—Chicago, with the ex- 
pectation of being refreshed “by the cool breezes from off Lake Michigan.” 
We quote the words of one who enthusiastically invited the Association to 
meet there; but we received with hydropathic fullness a baptism of perspira- 
tion’ some of us will never forget. Last summer we crossed the Rocky 
Mountains, 4,000 strong, and enjoyed the sublime scenery and more sub- 
lime hospitality of the friends of popular education on the. Pacific coast. 
The vast ocean west of them only adequately symbolized the length, the 
breadth, the height and depth of California’s generous hospitality to Amer- 
ican educators visiting that wonderful State: Now we come to the Sunny 
South, the land of our dreams, chivalrous, hospitable, and warm. Its 
Athenian State of Tennessee, the center of its educational influence and 
progress, has opened its homes, and its people their hearts, to welcome the 
educators from every section of our common country. 
This unique entertainment, the “barbecue,” where the “big animal” is 
served up whole, fitly typifies the size and grandeur of the welcome here 
extended. Now, in behalf of the friends of education from New England 
(we wish we were “a voice,” a trumpet voice), we bring to you here the 
sincere and hearty greetings of the educators of the East. Asa son of the 
Green Mountain State, and one of its ever-verdant products, we bring you 
the congratulations of the sons and daughters of old Ethan Allen and the 
heroes of Bennington; of the Granite State, the gigantic peaks of whose 
white hills immortalize the names of the patriot Presidents of the early 
history of the Republic from Washington down; this State also gave to 
the nation the boy Daniel Webster, who became later the great expounder 
of the constitution of the United States; of the old Bay State, with its 
rich historic record, the home of the Puritans and the Pilgrims, the Rock, 
the Plymouth, Bunker Hill, Lexington, Concord, and Faneuil Hall; of 
Harvard College, and Horace Mann, Ralph and George B. Emerson, and 
hundreds of other distinguished educators who more enhanced the real 
fame of the State which enjoys the proud distinction of the literary glory 
of Hawthorne, Longfellow, Holmes, James Russell Lowell,and Whittier; 
some of whom were born in the land of her oldest daughter, the Pine Tree 
State, who sends her representatives, loyal to the heritage of her ancient 
love of learning; Connecticut, “land of steady habits,” which fosters its 
ancient “Yale” and a common-school system that has made possible the 
“Yankee notions and the clock universal’ in wood and brass, and which 
in spite of its old “blue laws” reverences the sound Democratic principles 
of your peerless Andrew Jackson, even to this day; and Rhode Island, the 
dear little sister State, with its handy bathing resorts, its “clam bakes” and

its grand educational spirit, Brown University; and Providence, rich in 
this world’s goods, and richer in its school record. Yes! my Southern 
friends, all, we the representatives who have come to your sunny South 
and thousands who could not come to this educational festival, extend to 
you the cordial greeting and the right hand of fellowship, whose firm grip 
but faintly expresses our deep interest in your welfare and success in all 
that appertains to your glory as a part of our united republic. 
We of the East, in common with you, believe in the public-school system, 
and in universal education as the only true foundation and sure guaranty 
of the perpetuity of our free Republic. Let us be in sympathy with all 
wise measures, State and National, that may be proposed that will tend to 
make the whole people intelligent, virtuous, and loyal to the spirit of the 
founders of this Nation. Security, harmony and the future glory of our land 
will be promoted best by fostering the broadest culture, the most catholic 
spirit of toleration and sympathy. We are glad to meet here the friends of 
education from all sections on this common ground, and especially those 
from the South, from the State of Tennessee and the beautiful city of Nash- 
ville, whose fame is known in the remotest hamlet of New England, as the 
home of one of the peerless women of the world, Mrs. James K. Polk. We 
also remember it as being the residence of Leon Trousdale, who more than 
twenty years ago joined the ranks of this Association, and who by word and 
speech gaye character to its proceedings and influenced the whole Nation 
upon a great subject of vital consequence to us all. We are proud to be 
your guests, and congratulate you upon the hopeful auspices of this meeting 
of the National Educational Association. Our gratitude is especially due to 
the energetic local committee of your beautiful city, and to its citizens, for - 
the deep interest manifested in the promoting of the good aims and high 
purposes of this national gathering of educators. 
We would in conclusion voice the genuine delight of this unusual prelim- 
inary occasion. May the wisdom, zeal and devotion of all the representa- 
tives of the cause of learning present, be harmoniously combined in a grand 
effort to make universal the rich blessings of a high civilization for every 
section of our land, North, South, East, and West. 
Again thanking you in behalf of the representatives of New England 
commonwealths for your cordiality and unbounded hospitality to their del- 
egations, we give you the salute of fellowship and fraternity — 
“One in heart, one in hope.” 
BE. B. M’ELROY, OF OREGON. * 
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: I would rather be seen than heard. 
It is not my intention to boast. If I were boastful, I would apply to Ore- 
gon all that has been said of New England by our friend Mr. Sheldon, for 
you can place all the New England States in Oregon, and hardly miss the   
The remaining addresses are from the official stenographer’s report.

area. Last year we had the pleasure of meeting very many citizens from 
this city and this State, as well as from the South generally, and we did the 
best we could to entertain them. Some of the speakers have referred to 
the reception received on the Pacific Coast. To that I need not allude. We 
have all long known of the hospitality of the Southern people—that is 
historical; and so it affords us of Oregon very Sreat pleasure to meet you. 
We have come, ladies and gentlemen, a long way—almost three thousand 
miles—and in behalf of the teachers of Oregon we thank you and all with 
whom we have come in contact, for the courtesies that you have extended 
to us, and for the pleasure we have had in meeting you. I desire to extend 
to you, also, the greetings of Superintendent Hoitt, State Superintendent of 
Public Instruction of California, in whose place I appear to-day. We had 
the pleasure of a visit from Mr. Hoitt just prior to our coming here, and he 
expressed an exceedingly active interest in the work of this meeting. 
Now, ladies and gentlemen, it is beyond my power, in three or four min- 
utes, to say anything that will express what we would like'to say. I only 
make the announcement, if you please, that when you come to Oregon we 
hope to meet you. We have been asked by very many as to our country, 
our cities, our mountains, and our climate. All this is more than I can de- 
scribe to you. The Valley of the Willamette alone contains five millions 
of the most arable acres under God’s sun—I do not wish to brag, ladies 
and gentlemen. Our friend from New England talks about the bathing- 
places of the East—a few ponds on the shores of Rhode Island. Come 
out with us, if you please, where we bathe in the great Pacific—and where 
we doused our friend a few times when he was out there. Time fails to tell 
of such height and breadth as is ours in every direction. 
Will you permit me for a moment to speak one or two words of the great 
results of the meeting of this Association last year on the Pacific Coast? To 
my certain knowledge—lI cannot account for it—but to my certain knowl- 
edge, in the State of Oregon alone, acquaintances sprang up there with 
Eastern people, both with the young men and with the young women; and 
it is an absolute fact that one of the great results of that grand meeting has 
been twenty-three weddings in the State of Oregon. 
Now we brought a delegation of ladies with us. We do not claim that 
we have the prettiest girls in the world, but I think we can claim a grade 
of beauty equal to that of New England. As far as we will go, is to ac- 
knowledge that the ladies of the South are more beautiful than the women 
of Oregon. So much for the ladies. But we do claim to produce the best- 
looking men on the face of the earth, and I appear here as a representative 
of that class. 
J. L. PICKARD, OF IOWA. 
Mr. President, Your Excellency the Governor, and others who have so cor- 
dially welcomed us: As I represent the largest portion and the fairest por- 
tion of the United States, it can speak for itself, and I shall not need to use

  any such flattering: words as were necessarily uttered in support of New 
England, by my friend Sheldon. As I came from my home towards Nash- 
ville, the sleeper in which I was resting quietly was reversed, without my 
knowledge, and I have been unable since that time to “orient” myself. It 
is not a comfortable feeling to find the whole order of nature reversed, but 
it has its compensations. Can.I not say that the intellectual sun is now 
rising in the West? It is pleasant, too, to feel that the old ideas of North 
and South are reversed. With my face set Southward, I am sure that I am 
looking Northward, and that when I shall start toward my Northward home 
my feeling will still cling to the South; nor shall I desire that another re- 
versal of the car shall dispel the illusion. 
This grand, central plain between the Alleghanies and the Rackiee has not 
its equal upon the globe elsewhere. Jetierson appreciated its possibilities; 
the ordinance of 1787 forecast its intellectual and moral purpose. Once 
only, a generation ago, was its future endangered. There opened a rift, 
from which sulphurous exhalations and dismal thunderings arose; with 
these clouds obscuring the vision, some who are here to-day with hands 
clasped in friendship sought each a brother’s blood. 
Men’s blood and women’s tears flowed freely into this rift, and it is now 
closed forever. But now another rift appears not far from the same line, 
out of which coal and iron, chief factors in a nation’s progress, are rapidly 
poured forth through channels of industry to the development of this entire 
land. May we not congratulate each other in national prosperity and in 
the reinstatement of lost opportunities? 
Let it be ours to make the intelligence of the people keep pace with the 
opportunities opened for accumulation of wealth once not even dreamed of. 
Your struggles, of the South, have been heroic. We bring you cheer, and 
pledge you our hearts in true friendship and unity so long as this common 
aim of lifting the people by education shall secure our highest energies. 
D. L. KIEHLE, OF MINNESOTA. 
Mr. President, Your Excellency the Governor, Ladies and Gentlemen: At 
the last moment I have been asked to take the place of a gentleman who is 
absent, to speak a word in behalf of the Northwest. In the movement 
westward of our great centers of population and of commerce, it is only 
reasonable that the Twin Cities. have been asked to assume an independent 
position. The honor comes to us so newly, that you will sympathize with 
me in my apparent embarrassment in undertaking to represent the North- 
west here upon this accidental occasion. 
The magnitude of the territory, for part of which I am called upon to 
speak, is illustrated in the fact that while New England finds it necessary 
to put forward only one man, it takes three men of various sizes to repre- 
sent the great central territory. But the unity of the Nation is better ex- 
emplified by our territory than by any other. In New England, everything

seems to be mixed up individually, from high up to low down; here the 
great central thought, the great central purpose of our civilization is beau- 
tifully illustrated by the great river, the Father of Waters. There is no 
unity among any people, except.there is a unity of purpose, which implies 
a unity of intelligence. In a great country like ours, there seems to be 
- corresponding breadth of intelligence and thrift. The unity of our Nation, 
which is its foundation, is providentially shown in the very physical geog- 
raphy of the country. The future success of this great land depends upon 
the development of our educational facilities, by which we shall have a 
people that can comprehend the very complicated whole, understand the 
laws of our social life and growth, and each one feel that he is a member of 
the whole, with an important duty to perform. I have the honor to repre- 
sent that part of the country which lies farthest north— which some of you 
hold only in imagination and idea—so magnificent in its proportion that 
you know it best by the songs of our poets. I desire merely to express 
that it is our purpose to invite the teachers and friends of education in 
Tennessee, together with the friends of education in the entire country, to 
our part of the Northwest, to the Twin Cities, and especially to enjoy the 
hospitality of the city of St. Paul next year; we ask you to come to a State 
of five thousand lakes full of fishes; we ask you to enjoy the beautiful 
breezes, the last end of which you get here, in this beautiful climate. We 
have a hospitality there which is commensurate with all the demands of the 
most captious people. 
With high anticipations of the pleasure of that meeting, with great con- 
fidence in our ability to meet the utmost demands of your expectation, I 
extend a cordial invitation to the people of Tennessee and the friends of 
education in our great country to meet with us next year. 
J. M. GREENWOOD, OF MISSOURI. 
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: A hundred years ago there were 
three million people in the United States. To-day, sixty-five million; with 
prospects before them that no one can anticipate. If we go on increasing 
at the same rate, one hundred years hence our population will exceed five 
hundred million of human beings: The question that then comes up before 
the teachers of the United States, before the educators of this land, is one 
of most momentous importance: Where are all these people to be located? 
Will there be one hundred million in the Mississippi Valley, between the 
mountains of the Kast and the great plains of the West, or even more than 
that? Will this State of Tennessee at that time have a population of ten 
million? Why, it will support twenty million. Other States lying up and 
down the Mississippi river, and others on our eastern shores, and those on 
the western coast must supply a footing for all this teeming populace that is 
to come. But why even suggest this important matter, when the President 
has said that I can have but fifteen seconds in which to speak? I have just 
5—N.E. A.

one thought, and that is this: here is a people speaking the same language 
and worshipping the same God, actuated by the same principles, members 
of a common humanity and moving forward under one general impulse and 
to one great destiny. Friends, this is an important hour, and an important 
subject. I haven’t time to say a tithe that this calls for, but I tell you that 
the outlook is more cheerful than it has ever been before in the history of 
our whole country. Education is at work, and the destiny of our country is 
assured. 
THOMAS KIRTLAND, OF TORONTO, ONTARIO. 
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: I come here, the representative of a 
country as large as yours—the country north of the Great Lakes contain- 
ing millions of acres that have never seen the plow, inhabited by people 
who call you their cousins, who feel a warm affection for you, and would 
like very much to have a visit from you. You have heard a great deal 
about a little unpleasantness which existed between the North and the 
South, but it is happily ended forever. We in Canada have long thought 
that the estrangement between brothers ‘and sisters of a common country, 
which occurred about a-hundred years ago, should be blotted out. We see 
no reason now why a subject of Queen Victoria should not take as great 
pride in Bunker Hill, Saratoga and Yorktown as the Scotchman takes in 
Killicrankie, where his ancestors ran like sheep. We of the Dominion are 
with you, one in destiny, one in blood, one in common hope. 
I come here more especially to ask you not to accept the invitation of the 
eloquent gentleman from St. Paul, but to invite you to come to us to see 
your cousins that are waiting to receive you, north of the lakes. He has 
told you about his five thousand lakeg. We have one into which you could 
dump his whole five thousand, and not raise the water five feet. I bring 
with me an invitation from the friends of education on the shores of the 
Atlantic—Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec, Ontario, the far North- 
west, and British Columbia. We invite you to a city of two hundred thou- 
sand inhabitants, situated on the shores of Lake Ontario, with Niagara 
Falls on the other side; a city of three universities, four or five theological 
colleges, a normal college, and various other educational institutions. We 
will show you a system of education, beginning with the kindergarten and 
ending with the university, and we will try and welcome you with as warm 
hearts and open hands as you have extended to us to-day. 
J. A. B. LOVETT, HUNTSVILLE, ALABAMA. 
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: Responding to the words of wel- 
come so beautifully and so eloquently expressed by the gentlemen who have 
preceded me, it affords me a peculiar pleasure to say, on behalf of the South 
whose appreciative people I have the distinguished honor of representing 
on this notable occasion, that we gratefully accept the warm welcome ex-

tended to us, and we shall ever cherish in our minds the kindly sentiments to 
which you have given utterance to-day. 
When I remember the cordial and pressing invitation the citizens of Ten- 
nessee made through their representatives at San Francisco last summer for 
the National Educational Association to meet in Nashville, and knowing as 
Ido that this invitation came from those whose hearts and hands were 
anxious to extend the highest degree of hospitality to this great national 
convocation, I am not surprised at the assurances we now have of a soul- 
cheering welcome to this city and State, and of the hospitable entertainment 
which awaits us. 
It is gratifying to know that we come from all parts of this great Ameri- 
can Union with minds united and hearts full of enthusiasm. in the great 
cause of education, the fostering of which has long since entitled Nashville 
to be denominated the,“Athens of the South.” 
In Nashville you have the highest type of schools, managed by the high- 
est type of men and women, and supported by the highest type of our na- 
tional citizenship; and these facts will contribute, in no small degree, to 
the pleasure and profit of the thousands who have assembled on this great 
occasion. 
Hitherto, the attendance from the South upon the National Educational 
meetings has been meager; in a great measure this has been owing to the 
depression consequent upon the devastations of the late war. But our con- 
ditions have materially changed within the past few years. We have been 
signally fortunate in the discovery of new avenues of wealth, and successful 
in launching gigantic enterprises which have had a magical influence in 
bringing the South into such prominence as to cause the keen eye of the in- 
dustrial and business worlds to favorably glance in this direction; and we 
have enjoyed more than a mere glance of theeye. Millions of capital from 
the North and East is now reaping in the South large incomes for the in- 
vestors, thus uniting the great powers of the various sections of our country 
in making the South truly grand in material prosperity. 
While our material prosperity is very gratifying, we also have reason to 
be encouraged in the fact that the cause of education with us is keeping 
step with the progressive march of the times. Popular education in the 
Southern States, while it is not all that we would wish it to be, is rapidly 
gaining strength as the wheels of material prosperity roll on. Year after 
year our system of public education is gaining on the confidence and receiv- 
ing the support of all classes of our citizens. We rejoice to say that in 
most of our cities, at least, we have systems of public education that would 
do honor to Boston, or any of the cities of the North and. West. We have 
reason to boast of our high schools, colleges and universities. From these 
noble institutions men and women are annually sent out with well-trained 
minds and hearts to bless the world. And to-day, on this grand occasion, 
with our common schools, colleges and universities, we are present in large

numbers from every State in this fair Southland, to extend cordial greetings 
to our brethren from the North, the East, and the great West; and we would 
assure you of our fidelity to the great common cause which has brought us, 
with one accord, to this beautiful city, which is so thoroughly in sympathy 
with us in our efforts to advance American education. 
It is a pleasant fact with us, that, notwithstanding the bitterness of other 
days, when New England was rampant against the South, and the South 
had no love caresses for New England, we have in our midst to-day, in the 
most honored position in this national assembly, a “Marble” shaft taken 
from the best quarries of the old Bay State. This shaft is chiseled into the 
most symmetrical proportions, and beautified by the polishing touches of 
those grand institutions of the East, which have so greatly enriched the 
thought and literature of the world. 
And now, Mr. President, I will not consume your time longer. Iam almost 
a citizen of Tennessee, consequently a lengthy response from me to addresses 
of welcome from Tennesseeans would seem almost absurd.

  MANUAL TRAINING. 73 
THEME: MANUAL TRAINING, 
THE RESULTS OF THE ST. LOUIS MANUAL TRAINING 
SOHOOL.* 
Cc. M. WOODWARD, ST. LOUIS, MO. 
In common with many institutions of college grade, Washington Uni- 
versity had manual training in its Polytechnic School eighteen years ago, 
but it was not till 1880 that the Manual Training School was opened. This 
latter school for boys from fourteen to eighteen years of age is the St. Louis 
school to which reference is so often made. It was established under the 
charter of the University, with money contributed by private citizens. Over 
a quarter of million of dollars have been given to erect, equip, conduct and 
endow this school. 
Its daily program covers six full hours, and an average of two hours of 
home study. Two hours are given to the theory and use of hand and ma- 
chine tools on woods, metals and plastics; one hour is given to pen, pencil 
and brush work; the work in mathematics, science, language and literature 
is substantially that of a high school. The length of the course is three 
years. 
The school has just finished its ninth year, and has graduated 279 young 
men in seven classes. The enrollment by years has been: 67, 107, 176, 201, 
218, 233, 226, 223, 241. Its capacity, which has been twice increased, is at 
present 248 pupils. During the coming year the enrollment will probably 
reach that figure. The one hundred seats in the “first-year” room were 
full from the beginning to the end of last year. 
The school has exhibited its shop-work and drawing every year in St. 
Louis; at the meetings of the N. E. A. in ’82, ’83, ’84 and ’88; and at the 
Paris Exposition, by special request, in 1889. 
From the start the school has been under the general charge of a director 
selected by the University Board of Trustees. The instruction in all branches 
was given last year by a corps of twelve teachers. Such in brief is the his- 
tory of the school whose results I am to discuss to-night. 
What are the “Results”? They are many and momentous. I shall not 
attempt to name, much less discuss them all. 
I. It has had great influence on education. This is shown — 
1. In the establishment of similar schools elsewhere. 
*Subject assigned by President Marble.  
-P-A-G-E-74
  74 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
‘2. In the adoption of the manual elements into high schools and acade- 
mies, and in some cases into the highest grade of the grammar schools. 
38. In the adoption of certain elementary forms of manual training for the 
lower grades in many schools. 
4. In suggesting improvements in methods of teaching the natural sciences 
and drawing in schools which do not admit what is commonly known as 
manual training. 
It is not necessary for me to specify these points in greater detail; every 
observer of what is now going on in the educational world can do that for 
himself. I do not claim that our school should have the credit for all that 
has been done in these directions—there has been a spirit of advance all 
along the line —but that our influence has been great, there can be no rea- 
. sonable doubt. 
II. An important result has been the extension of the period of schooling 
wherever manual training has been judiciously tried. I predicted this in 
1883, and the prediction has been verified in a score of cities. Not only do 
boys enter high schools or their equivalents who would not have done so 
had manual training not invited them, but to a degree very unusual for 
such grades they have persisted to the end. This happy result foreshadows 
a great achievement in the near future. When a judicious manual training 
shall have been incorporated into the curriculum of all schools which admit 
pupils of thirteen years and upward, the attendance of boys in such schools 
will be increased fourfold. 
Some of you shake your heads at this, and mentally declare that the tax- 
payers will not endure the expense of such an attendance. You are wrong; 
they will pay their taxes cheerfully, willingly. When not the few, but the 
many, go into the higher school; when the high school becomes clearly 
and without argument preparatory to all avenues and all callings requiring 
and rewarding intellectual vigor, culture and yersatility, instead of prepara- 
tory to a few of such callings, no one will complain of its cost. Philadel- 
phia is showing this most emphatically, as perhaps are many other places 
less widely known. If high-school people, who are put regularly upon their 
defense, would secure the introduction of manual training, they would find 
their positions much strengthened. 
III. Another result has been a stronger taste for study and a greater zeal 
for higher education. To some this result is quite a surprise. I even ex- 
pect that some will deny that there is or can be any such result. Let us 
examine the facts first, and account for them afterwards. 
Of the 239 graduates of the St. Louis Manual Training School, ( previously 
to last June,) representing about 500 students entering the school, 87 have 
gone on into higher education in the line of the professions or teaching. 
The professional lines are law, more often medicine, dentistry and surgery, 
and still more often architecture and engineering. Our graduates enter col- 
lege and polytechnic classes as freshmen. Washington University draws

MANUAL TRAINING. 75 
  
students from the city high school, from a classical academy, (under the 
charter of the University and on the same “block” as the Manual.Training 
School,) from the Manual Training School, and from exterior institutions. 
Fifty-one per cent. of all the young men in the freshman and sophomore 
classes last year came from the Manual Training School. 
Moreover, this result was in the face of all the presumptions and prear- 
ranged plans. In many preparatory schools a majority of the students ex- 
pect from the first to go to college, and their preparation for higher education 
is deliberately made. With us the case is quite the other way. Not one- 
third of those who have gone on expected to do so when they entered the 
school.* 
A newly-awakened desire for study and a determination to secure the 
boon of higher education are characteristics of our school. Scores of parents 
have come to me to discuss situations developed by these new ambitions. 
Now what is the explanation? It is not far toseek. The course of study 
and training has these capital properties: 
1. The interaction of the recitation work and the laboratory (shop) work 
is such that many studies which in ordinary schools are obscure and unat- 
tractive, here become clear and inviting. This is particularly true of math- 
ematics, science, and mechanical drawing, and to a certain extent, of language. 
Consequently, the pupil approaches every new exercise with confidence and 
a pleasant anticipation. He is in a condition to do excellent work. It is 
an established canon in psychology that ‘intellectual activity is natural and 
economical when one works with the support of an emotional stimulus.” + 
This emotional stimulus is due partly to the strong light which the facts 
and experiences of the shop and drawing-room throw upon the printed pages, 
of the text-books, and partly to the indirect influence of the enthusiasm 
which boys bring out of the shop, and which encourages the lad to labor 
hard and patiently in other fields. 
2. The second capital property of our program is the combination of 
physical and intellectual exercise, while neither is carried to the extent of 
weariness. We aim to place shop between hours of hard study and close, 
attentive recitation, bringing grateful change and relief. Our program 
has six full hours, but the day is not too long. 
3. A third reason for the tendency of our work to stimulate advanced 
education, already hinted at above, is this: The exercises and the short 
familiar lectures of the shop illustrate to pupils in a thousand ways the 
value of much that they learn from books. The pupils are accordingly 
satisfied with the outlook, and fall into the habit of accepting without serious 
question the program of studies laid out before them in higher courses. 
*“Tt is to be remembered that not a few of the boys who come toa manual-training school come 
there for the express purpose of cultivating the mechanical side to the exclusion of everything else. 
In many cases these lads are finally converted to the broader views of life.”—Prof. C. H. Henderson, 
Phila, Man, Train, Sch. 
William H. Burnham,— Seribner’s Magazine, March, 1889.

  76 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  
Much less than in ordinary schools do teachers in a manual-training school 
hear the old, old question, “ What is the use of my studying this and that?” 
I think these three reasons quite fully account for the observed influence 
of manual training in favor of higher education. In view of this fact, I 
cannot but smile at the groundless fear and anxiety that manual training 
would introduce caste and class distinctions, and tend to deprive the poor 
of present opportunities for higher education. 
One critic says manual training is largely in the direction of keeping the 
poor in their sphere; and another says that to introduce manual training 
is to take from the masses the boon of higher education.* When I compare 
such dire predictions with actual facts, I recall what Mr. George 8. Mills, 
of Toledo, recently said to me of the opposition to manual training in their 
high school. He knew of but one man in the city who opposed it, and he 
refused ever to go and see what it was and how it worked.. In St. Louis 
the only unflinching opponent our school ever had was a rich manufacturer, 
who had little education, but who had spent several years in learning the 
trade of a machinist. He insisted that unless we aimed to turn out me- 
chanics, we had no business to put in tools, and that the only way to teach 
a boy practical mechanics was to put him in a shop ten hours a day, and 
continue that course for four or five years. He told me I was doing a great 
deal of mischief, but never till the day of his death would he visit the 
school. 
4. The fourth “Result” to which I can here only call brief attention, 
involves the question of economics. During the past two years the discus- 
sion of manual training has been largely on intellectual grounds. Its moral 
influence has been seldom dwelt upon, and its economic bearing has been 
generally waived. In nearly every paper I have written during the past 
two years, I have urged only its educational value. Not that I have lost 
any faith in its value as a source of practical power; its value in enabling a 
man to make a good living; to earn money; to rise in the world; to meet 
as a citizen his obligations to his family and to the State; to command the 
means whereby life-long culture may be gained, science be cultivated, and 
art be encouraged. 
Because I believe more and more in the intellectual, moral and physical 
value of manual training, I believe in its economic value none the less. 
On the contrary, I have within the past year seen the most unmistakable 
evidence of its high industrial value: I have never presented the practical 
side as it can be presented. I do not need it; parents do not need it; they 
see it even more quickly than I do, and come to me in delighted surprise at 
the success of their sons in securing good places and in earning good salaries. 
As I write this I see before me a letter from the President of a manufactur- 
ing company already employing three manual graduates. He wants a fourth. 
Names of two other graduates had been sent him, but before he could en-

MANUAL TRAINING. : de 
  gage one of them they had both been snapped by other parties. This letter 
says: 
“Our agent wants a young man to make himself useful in canvassing for boilers, 
pumps, etc., as well as taking measurements, making sketches, drawings, etc., occa- 
sionally, and also in erecting entire steam plants under his direction. The place is 
one in which a good, smart young man can make a record, and work up to pretty 
good pay. A graduate of the manual-training school will be preferred.” 
I get many such letters from all sorts of people: manufacturers of engines, 
shoes, houses, street cars, railroads, glass—in fact all the worthy enterprises 
of a great city. Hither go many of the boys who do not enter higher edu- 
cation. 
I could fill a volume with interesting evidence of the pecuniary, business 
value of manual ‘training, but I refrain. Nevertheless, I must say this in 
answer to those who appear to think that it condemns any study, to show 
that it has bread-winning value—or as they prefer to put it, “ bread-and- 
butter” value: The economic argument is a perfectly valid one. If it were 
admitted that other results were no better, and no worse, than those pro- 
duced by the old system, we should still have in the economic results an 
unanswerable argument in favor of manual training. If in the clash of 
arguments and the marshaling of evidence, I shall hold in reserve what 
some doubtless consider my strongest battalions, it will only show how con- 
fident I am of maintaining my position against all the assaults of the 
enemy. 
V.—Is Manual Training a Failure ? 
But I have no wish to ignore the objections and arguments urged by those 
opposed to manual training, or at least, those not yet prepared to advise its 
adoption into any grade of the public schools. My ability to meet some of 
these objections, and to answer some of these arguments, may be regarded 
with some liberality as one of the results of the St. Louis school. 
In a paper read by Supt. A. P. Marble, of Worcester, Mass., in Washing- 
ton, D. C., in March, 1888, but which I did not know about till those pro- 
ceedings were published a few weeks ago, it was said that “The attempt to 
make manual training general in the public schools would, if successful, 
tend to break up the whole system; by overloading the schools we may 
easily create a revolt from the burden of taxation. In St. Louis that revolt 
has come, for out of several causes to which the recent diminution of the 
appropriation has been attributed, this seems to me most probable.” 
This cool presumption that the appropriation was cut down on account of 
the cost of manual training in the St. Louis public schools, can hardly be 
called a “presumption of brains.” In the first place the appropriation was 
not cut down on account of manual training, because there was no manual 
training in the public schools;* and, secondly, the appropriation was not 
cut down at all. What the people of St. Louis did was to sit squarely down   
* Unless the kindergartens.established by Mr. Harris are manual training.

78 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  upon the custom of spending large sums of money for the teaching of a 
foreign language in her schools, and upon the proposition to spend half a 
million dollars upon an extravagantly planned high-school building, while 
children of grammar and primary grades were roaming the streets from lack 
of school room. In so far as the people pronounced any judgment upon 
manual training, it was in the shape of 150 applications for the 100 places 
in the entering class of my school last September. It is altogether probable 
that Mr. Marble would find similar “revolts” in Toledo, Philadelphia, and 
Chicago. 
But after defending the entire sufficiency of the old curriculum, and 
showing up the worthlessness of manual training as characteristic of the 
new; after recounting the St. Louis revolt, as explained above, Mr. Marble 
interrogates history — What of manual training? Back comes the response 
like the oracle of a god —“‘A/ready it has failed !”” And because the Bureau 
of Education did not publish that dreadful verdict till fourteen months 
afterward, we poor deluded believers in the beneficent mission of manual 
training went on’ with our busy, happy schools, sweetly innocent and pro- 
foundly ignorant of the terrible fact that manual training had already 
failed !! 
But where had it failed? At Gloucester, and at North Easton, Mass. 
The experiment at the former place I was familiar with; the latter was new 
to me. As these two cases are all that Mr. Marble quotes in reaching the . 
conclusion that “already it has failed,” I must examine them somewhat 
minutely. 
In September, 1878, Miss Marian Hovey, of Boston, placed money at the 
disposal of the school committee of Gloucester for the “industrial education” 
of boys. A shop, tools and teacher were furnished, and four classes of boys 
from the two upper grades of the grammar schools were given one lesson a 
week, and that on Saturdays. At the end of two years the experiment had 
worked so well in the estimation of all people concerned, that a substantial 
extension was effected, all at the expense of Miss Hovey. Afternoon classes 
on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays, two each day, were organ- 
ized, eight classes in all. The shop could accommodate but twelve pupils, 
and every class was full—ninety-six pupils all told. Two of the classes 
were girls, and the superintendent at the time reported that they did as 
good work as the boys and enjoyed it as heartily. 
At the end of the third year Miss Hovey stopped furnishing money, and 
the experiment ceased. Whether she went elsewhere to spend her summers, 
or whether she thought the infant was old enough and strong enough to go 
alone, or whether for some other reason her bounty was cut off, I am not 
informed, nor does Mr. Marble appear to know. 
“You take my house, when you do take the prop 
That doth sustain my house.” 
No salary, no teacher; no teacher, no shop. That is the entire story of
-P-A-G-E-79
  MANUAL TRAINING. 79 
what Mr. Marble calls a “failure” of manual training. True, it did fail to 
appear after three successful years, but Mr. Marble certainly gave the im- 
pression that the experiment had shown that manual training was educa- 
tionally a failure. He quoted the new superintendent as saying, “The 
novelty wore off and it was dropped,” a statement singularly deficient in 
candor. The explanation for this want of candor is found in Mr. Marble’s 
words a little farther on. 
He quotes the new superintendent as saying: “I have since heard much 
discussion pro and con, but I am by no means convinced that the public schools 
should undertake this work”! There you have it! There was the failure! 
The new superintendent was “not convinced.” The people who had seen 
it wanted it, and were willing to pay for it; but the new superintendent, 
who had not seen it, did not want it, and didn’t think the public schools 
should undertake it. So much for Mr. Marble’s first instance of failure. 
The second case, at North Easton,* Mass., is even more interesting. Mr. 
Marble quotes the principal as saying, that in consequence of the introduc- 
tion of some manual work, his first Latin class went to pieces when he came 
to the subjunctive mood. The French class followed suit, but the physics 
class “suffered most.” The principal then adds, with the air of a martyr: 
“Policy would dictate silence; but I have counted the cost. ‘It is not all 
of life to live, nor all of death to die’”! This plainly suggests a different 
opinion on the part of the authorities. Accordingly, I wrote to the super- 
intendent, Mr. William C. Bates. I find that the town has the benefit of a 
fund which yields $4,000 a year, which is spent for manual training. They 
have some manual work in all the grades. It is nearly two years since the 
high school “went to pieces,” as Mr. Marble puts it, and yet the manual train- 
ing continues in-all grades, and with great popular favor. The superintend- 
ent says that in the lower grades the programs were so arranged that there 
was no conflict of hours, but that in the high school no such arrangement 
was made. ‘The principal, “with all the intensity of his being, was opposed 
to the union of manual training with a purely mental drill,’ and “he could 
not bring himself to give the new order of things a fair trial.” Whenever 
the pupils went to shop or laboratory, they were absent from recitation, 
(half a day each week,) and the lessons must be made up. ‘When the 
girls left the room to go to the class in cooking, the principal so plainly 
showed his disapproval, and showed so little disposition to give the new de- 
partment a fair show, that many of the girls were forced to give the work 
up altogether.” Cooking is now taught regularly to the grammar grades, 
but the first year the high-school girls, who had never had cooking, were 
allowed to take it. The class in mechanical drawing is held on Saturdays, 
because no time can be found for it on other days; and yet “it is well at- 
tended.” “The school committee and the superintendent know that the 
trouble was greatly exaggerated in the letter of the principal to Mr. Marble.”   
*North Easton is a small town with a high school of about 65 pupils, and a sum total for all schools 
of $12,600 per year.
-P-A-G-E-80
THE NATIONAL ED UCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  In his report for the year 1888 the principal says (and the manual train- 
ing continues to date): “In conclusion, allow me to express my firm convic- 
tion that the Easton high school never was in a more satisfactory condition.” 
The superintendent indorses this statement, and adds: ‘At no time in the 
last five years has the school varied from its uniformly satisfactory condi- 
tion.” 
So here we have a school that “went to pieces” doing splendidly, and yet 
the boys go to shop every week on an unaccommodating program. It is 
evident that the explanation of this second failure is akin to the former. 
There was one man who was opposed to it. He told the superintendent at 
the start that it would be better to burn the money than to spend it on 
manual training. 
A fellow-teacher of many years’ acquaintance writes of the principal: 
“He was bound to disapprove of manual training, and will as long as he lives. 
It was introduced without any consultation with him. He disapproves of normal 
schools; never visits one, and doesn’t know what they are doing, but is always 
‘down’ on them, and on any teacher who comes from them and introduces new 
methods. Manual training still lives and prospers here in spite of his opposition.” 
Here I must leave Mr. Marble. Manual training can survive many more * 
such failures as Gloucester and North Easton. 
V1.—The Views of Editor Brown and Dr. Harris.* . 
A careful study of the St. Louis school, the “mechanical processes it em- 
ploys, and the activities they stimulate,” throws much light upon the 
discussions of psychology. This flood of light is a result of no little 
importance at the present crisis. 
Placed as Messrs. Brown and Harris are, without the circle of actual 
contact with the matter under discussion, they have no resource but that of 
speculation. Valuable as their discussions are, however, they do not in my 
judgment compare with the light thrown upon the questions at issue by 
actual experience. I appeal with all confidence to the school itself, to its 
fruits in the community, to that increasing band of students whose lives 
are daily witness to the three-fold benefit of manual training in their edu- 
cation, to the wide circle of parents who volunteer unanimous and enthusi- 
astic approval of the system of training which they find so valuable to 
their sons. The tremendous strength of this public opinion is one of the 
results which the cause of education must feel. 
I touched fully upon the intellectual and physical results in my paper _ 
read in Washington in March last. As this paper is now in print, I must 
refer those interested in this subject to its contents. [See Circular of Infor- 
mation No. 2, 1889.] 
I have read and re-read several times Mr. Brown’s very interesting and 
able resentation of the eee ae ne observation and reflection in the growth 
*See June Education for “The Educational Value of Manual Training,” and May and June Education 
for “The Psychology of Manual Training.”
-P-A-G-E-81
  MANUAL TRAINING. 81 4 
and development of intelligence. I should be false to my convictions if I 
did not cheerfully admit that I heartily indorse the greater part of what he 
says on this point. The parts I cannot indorse consist of conclusions drawn 
from false premises in regard to the nature and methods of manual training. 
To begin with, he misinterprets my remark that, “I do not say that every 
public school should have a shop and teach the use of tools.” He appears 
to understand from that, that I do not recommend manual training for all 
pupils; and yet I said ten lines farther on, “every boy in his teens should 
have systematic manual training, and no instrumentality, no opportunity 
can compare with that of the school for giving it. Moreover, the school can 
afford all that is generally desirable without loss of dignity or efficiency 
in other directions. Eventually some manual elements, duly modified, should 
appear in all the grades, but it is folly to insist that manual training, properly 
so called, should go at once into all the grades or none.” Because I would 
not put fully-equipped shops and the severe drawing of my school into all 
grades, he remands manual training to special schools. Would he put 
Cicero’s orations, quadratic equations, and practical chemistry into every 
public school? If not, then they must be remanded to special schools, ac- 
cording to Mr. Brown’s method of reasoning. 
Mr. Brown fails to rightly conceive the nature and methods of manual 
training. So long as he discourses upon the nature and educational neces- 
sity of observation and reflection, Iam with him. He even makes a most 
important concession: “See something —then draw it—then make it. * This 
is the sequence of steps by which the child is to come into a mastery of the 
world through the manual-training process. The importance of this study 
and construction of things in primary grades is concealed. . . . While 
in this lower intellectual stage [of observation], objects of sense and of the 
imagination must command his attention. It is not probable that too much 
emphasis will be given to the necessity for persistent and systematic train- 
ing by skillful teachers in the observation and construction of things. Mr. 
Woodward does not place too high an estimate upon teaching a child the 
meaning of a ‘process.’” 
This would appear to be a great step forward. Once admit the educa- 
tional value of such a sequence of steps, and we shall soon come to an agree- 
ment as to the proper time and place for introducing it. 
But Mr. Brown italicizes the word “primary” in the above passage, and 
later on he gives us to understand that the period for this lower intellectual 
stage of what he denominates “concrete thinking” ends when the child is 
ten (10) years old. 
“To learn to observe by observing does not seem the most economical use 
of time after the child has reached that maturity that makes reflection 
practicable. . . . The workshop ought not to go into the upper grades 
of a general educational system, for the reason that the time of the pupils 
can be better employed.” He speaks of the three hours devoted to manual

82 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  
work (shop-work and drawing) and the “three hours to studies that train’ 
to reflection,’ as though there was no question about the non-reflective 
character of our manual features. 
These extracts clearly show that Mr. Brown thinks, (1) that workshop 
training involves observation, but not reflection—at least, no reflection 
that could not be had without the shop; (2) that the intellectual operations 
of the workshop are within the capacity of children under ten years of age. 
~ He bases all his arguments on these premises. 
  TRAINING EXECUTIVE FACULTIES. 
Dr. Harris makes a similar mistake, while setting up and then knocking 
down a theory in regard to the culture of the executive faculties in manual 
training. He says “that it has been claimed by some of its advocates that 
we have in manual training an executive action of the mind while we have 
only a receptive activity in the other school studies,” and that “the distine- 
tion between executive and receptive activities seems to be based on” the dif- 
ference between the efferent and afferent nerves, i.e., the motor and sensor 
nerves. “It would be assumed,” he says, “in the first place, that the most 
essential forms of human activity are sensor and motor. The individual 
should be receptive of impressions from without through his nerves of sen- 
sation, or else he should be executive through using his muscles. Moreover, 
in order to make this theory [t.e., his theory] apply to manual training, it 
must be held that manual training covers the ground of the motor, or ex- 
ecutive.” 
He then proceeds to demolish this theory of his as follows: “But the 
psychology on which this distinction of executive and receptive activities is 
based is-not sound. It omits the elaborative faculties of the mind alto- 
gether.” So down goes the theory, as it ought, for it is a very poor theory. 
What I object to is not that he demolishes his theory, but that he ever set 
it up. 
I find it hard to believe that either Dr. Harris or Editor Brown ever 
supposed it possible that any of us could advocate as a part of secondary 
education a feature which involves not brains but muscles alone, which 
leaves out the reflective, elaborative faculties of the mind. 
Now let me say to these gentlemen, that if there is no reflection in man- 
ual training, if we do leave the elaborative faculties of the mind out of the 
exercises of the shop and drawing-room, then there is nothing in manual 
training worthy of the name. 
But we do not leave them out. Mental activity in the shape of thoughtful, 
deliberate, logical reasoning is the great characteristic of our exercises, par- 
ticularly for those which call for invention and executive action. Could 
these men spend a single week in a manual-training school they would see 
how wide of the mark their assumptions are. The shop of a manual-train- 
ing school properly so called is full of intellectual life. Thoughts of the
-P-A-G-E-83
  MANUAL TRAINING. 83 
playground, the theater, the circus, the dance, the loafing rendezvous, enter 
less frequently into the shop than they do into the study hours. While 
mentally recreative, from the fact that it calls into activity parts of the 
brain either not employed or but little exercised in book-work, shop-work is 
still brain-work. Very often it is obvious that at the end of two hours the 
shop students are on the borderland of mental, not physical, fatigue. To 
actually get over into the realm of mental fatigue is harmful. For a boy 
of twelve, an hour or an hour and a half of shop-work at a time is a great 
plenty, if the object is education; at fourteen he may have two hours, but 
no more; at eighteen he may have three hours. These figures, which may 
be taken as approximately correct for average boys, are the result of long 
experience on the part of many men. All recognize that the limit of time 
is fixed by mental and not muscular considerations. 
This activity is inevitably in the nature of close attention, sharp com- 
parison of present conditions with former conditions, generalization, and 
inyention—in short, in the use of all the faculties. I do not hesitate to 
say that students engaged upon the five lines of study—mathematics, 
science, literature, drawing, and tool-work— reflect as much and as profit- 
ably upon their shop-work as upon any other branch.* 
It is this reflection upon the force and meaning of every new step and 
process, this elaboration of the impressions of personal experience and the 
pictured experience of others into a basis for the execution of a new and 
untried step—I say it is this mental activity which sufficiently accounts 
for the rapid progress students make in mastering the secrets of tool con- 
struction and use. Competent judges declare that our boys of sixteen years 
learn as much of the theory and practice of iron and steel forging and tem- 
pering, for example, in 250 hours as ordinary shop apprentices do in two 
‘years, spending eight or ten hours daily in and about the shop. As a rule, 
the apprentice boy reflects very little upon his work; he is not taught nor 
stimulated to think and reason. Excepting at rare intervals when he is 
put at something new, what fills his hands fails to occupy his mind; his 
thoughts are absent, and he is learning nothing except muscular autom- 
atism. In a well-conducted school, shop instruction and practice stop short 
of the point where the mind would tire of the work in hand and fly for 
relief to other fields. 
Both Mr. Brown and Dr. Harris fail to see this mental element in manual 
training. The former thinks of every boy with tools in his hands as the 
victim of a system which dispenses with brains and “reduces him to a mere 
machine.” Speaking of a man he has seen or heard of in a manufacturing 
town, Mr. Brown says: “Ten hours per day for twenty years has matured 
the turning of plow-handles into a mental and physical habit which domi- 
*Says Dr. W. Gotze, before the Eighth Congress of German Educators: “Manual instruction teaches 
the child to contemplate, to observe —gives him opportunity for personal experience. The clear look 
[insight], the active sense which the boy acquires in practical work, acts advantageously on the rest of 
his studies, for his whole being is transformed.”
-P-A-G-E-84
84 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  nates and even constitutes his life.” He then draws this lesson from the 
sad spectacle: “When two-thirds or three-fourths of the curriculum of lower. 
grades and one-half of the higher is devoted to work akin to turning plow- 
handles, is it not a serious question whether it gives the preparation which 
that man most needs who is to turn plow-handles all his life?” (The italics 
are mine.) 
Similarly, Dr. Harris invariably associates with manual training no ade- 
quate mental activity, but the stolid monotony of long-continued repetitions 
such as one easily finds connected with modern manufactories. While at- 
tempting to disprove the general economic value of manual training, he 
speaks of “a long apprenticeship to blacksmithing,” “too much planing and 
sawing,” “the long-continued and one-sided training” necessary to the ac- 
quisition of a certain delicacy of touch, ete. 
So long as these men persist in imagining that manual training, both as a 
science and as an art, is altogether different from what it is, it is to be ex- 
pected that they will draw wrong conclusions as to its intellectual and its 
economic value. : 
I desire, however, to thank Mr. Harris for introducing a certain illustra- 
tion in his discussion of executive training. He says: “The general who 
plans the battle and directs the movement of his troops so that they secure 
victories is of course the executive man in a far higher sense than the pri- 
vate soldier who mechanically obeys what he is ordered to do.” We shall 
not differ on that point; but if he wishes me to accept the general as the 
representative of pupils whose school education is limited to books, and 
the private soldier as the representative of those pupils whose school educa- 
tion has included both books and manual training, I respectfully but firmly 
decline todoso. The illustration shall do me excellent service nevertheless. 
Does Mr. Harris know how in this country we train generals so that they 
are able to plan battles and secure victories? Does he not know that every 
successful general of the late war had been trained at West Point in all the 
duties of the common soldier? The method of West Point is the method 
of manual training. Not merely do students read of camp life, of rifle-firing, 
of throwing up breastworks, and of making bridges, but every cadet reads 
and draws and puts his hands to the actual work—not for long apprentice- 
ships, not for ten hours a day for twenty years, but just long enough to cul- 
tivate the intelligence to give the future commander that knowledge of 
details which is essential to the formation and execution of sound plans of 
battle and campaigns. The U.S. Military Academy at West Point and 
the U. S. Naval Academy at Annapolis are essentially manual-training 
schools of high grade. 
Whatever may be the future demand for generals in the great armies of 
civilization, there can be no doubt as to our duty to train every man in our 
civil academies in the most thorough, all-round manner. Give him a har- 
monious rather than an inharmonious development; educate the whole boy 
rather than certain parts of him.

  MANUAL TRAINING. 85 
It must be evident to all that these opponents of manual training think 
not only that manual work is unreflective, unelaborative, long-continued, 
narrow and dwarfing in its nature, but that the pupil gets little else but 
manual training. Mr. Brown’speaks of giving three-fourths of the cur- 
riculum to work akin to an endless turning of plow-handles, and while he 
gives credit to the St. Louis school for a fairly full reflective program, he 
denies it to others. I do not know that the demand for intellectual life in 
my school is any greater than it is in other fully organized manual-training 
schools. In fact, I believe that in several of them the number of lessons to 
be learned and recited daily is more than in ours, and that the manual 
features are simply added to the usual curriculum. 
GENERALS versus PARTICULARS. 
Dr. Harris institutes a comparison with which I am far from satisfied. 
While contrasting “the learning of arithmetic and geometry” with “learn- 
ing how to make a box or a joint, or to weld two pieces of iron,” Mr. Harris 
compares generals with particulars. He places the whole science of mathe- 
matics in opposition to two or three special problems of tool-work. If, in 
reply, adopting his style of comparison, I should say something like this: 
“Compare the learning of the principles and methods of combining parts 
according to the nature of tools and materials, and the forces to be trans- 
mitted or sustained in the infinite variety of constructions devised by man 
—compare all this with learning the number of cubic inches in a bushel ; 
how to compute the cost of carpeting a room with an ideal carpet that can 
be cut without waste; and that but one perpendicular can be drawn from a 
given point to the same straight line,” I should blush at my own unfairness 
to put forth such a comparison; and I fail to see how Dr. Harris can with 
dignity thus evaluate claims which he assumes to be in opposition. The box, 
the joint, the weld, are only examples in the great volume of construction; 
they are rounds in the long ladder which leads up to the pinnacle of human 
achievement in the material world. As the boy solves a particular example 
in the equation of payments with close attention to details, so the same stu- 
dent during the laboratory hour makes a particular joint with close atten- 
tion to the details of form and the proper sequence of steps. Neither the 
equated day of payment nor the joint has any intrinsic value after the work 
is done, but the doing of it has given him an insight into a thousand examples 
which may arise in his dealings with his fellows, and which will find him 
more completely master of the situation in consequence of these school-day 
experiences. Do not suppose for a moment that one example is a type, 
while the other is not; that one solution requires brains, reflection, and 
elaboration, while the other does not; that one is universal, the other par- 
ticular; that one deals with mind, the other with matter. There is no essen- 
tial difference in dignity; both are learned in the first instance by imitation, 
6—N.E. A.

  then the reasonableness of every step is made to appear. Both require close 
attention, intelligence, and accuracy; and they are equally human. 
‘When Mr. Harris read his paper, he interpolated the remark that the 
making of a box might “be valuable if the boy should ever have occasion 
to make another box of the same size and shape”! He did not print the 
remark, I am happy to say, and perhaps I ought not to quote it; but, 
uttered on the spur of the moment, without premeditation, it clearly showed 
that he held the narrowest possible conception of the nature and value of 
manual work, whether considered intellectually or economically. I could 
parallel his admission only by conceding that the boy who calculated the 
cost of carpeting a room might find the exercise of value provided he ever 
wished to carpet a room of the same size and shape. 
But Mr. Brown thinks that while Ido not place too high an estimate 
upon teaching the meaning of a process, I do estimate too highly the rela- 
tive value of the process of mechanical construction. In the paper to which 
he particularly referred, I said: “I do not find it necessary to contrast the 
mental effect of tool-work with that of mathematics or literature—all are 
necessary in a rounded education.” But I clearly indicated the course we 
should adopt if we hope to secure a maximum intellectual result. I said: 
“Tntellectual growth is not to be gauged by the number of study hours, nor 
by the length of recitations. So long as one gives undivided attention to 
his work, his mind grows. When attention flags, or is divided, healthy 
growth stops. The statement is equally true for the lad who poses over 
books and the one who handles tools. If either is kept at his task after 
his interest has ceased, he forms the stupefying habit of thoughtless, unin- 
telligent action which approaches automatism, and is fatal to intelligent 
progress. It is for this reason that over-schooled pupils and drudging ap- 
prentices get on slowly mentally. Their chief interests and their chief 
enjoyments are outside their line of study and their daily toil. The sharp 
distinction modern society makes between the boy who works with his 
hands and the boy who works at his books, has driven both to extreme 
positions, which are unfavorable to the healthy development of either. 
There is no question but that the untaught, unreasoning, unscientific laborer 
is extremely stupid; neither is there any doubt that bookish people whose 
personal experiences are at a minimum, whose ideas and opinions and con- 
victions(?) and information are derived from books and the statements of 
others, are extremely stupid and helpless when face to face with the world 
for which their education is supposed to fit them.” The point of maximum 
intelligence and intellectual power lies somewhere between these two ex- 
tremes. 
Now let me turn to Dr. Harris again, and consider somewhat this ques- 
tion of relative values. 
LEARNING TO READ. 
Dr. Harris has much to say of the value of learning to read, and yet I
-P-A-G-E-87
  MANUAL TRAINING. ors 
doubt if he puts more into the process than I do, or sees more clearly than 
I how much is required to enable one to really read. With St. Paul I 
would rather read (speak) five words with my understanding than ten 
thousand in an unknown tongue. Dr. Harris says: “Each man may re- 
ceive the whole of human experience if he will only learn the symbols in 
which it is stored up.” That is a pregnant sentence. The word “symbols” 
must be interpreted very liberally, for he assumes that all human experi- 
ence is stored up in them. As I reflect upon it, I fail to exhaust the cata- 
logue of symbols in which human experience is stored. It is evident that 
the characters on the printed page form one set, but there are many more; 
so that when Dr. Harris adds, “If the child will learn how to read and 
write, he may learn the experience of the race through the countless ages (?) 
of its existence,” he falls far below the pitch of his former statement. And 
when he goes on to assert that he who reads the writings of trained specialists 
sees with their eyes, feels with their senses, and reflects with their brains, 
his assertions need so much qualification that they appear to be very gen- 
erally untrue. Who read the writings of trained specialists? To ordinary 
readers they are in great part unintelligible, sealed books. When I 
chance to see the records of biological research, I feel utterly incapable of 
reading them appreciatively on account of my lack of experience in those 
fields. It is so in all technical periodicals. Take our industrial journals 
(and their name is legion), and the most valuable, characteristic parts are 
beyond the ken of those who have no knowledge of the processes, the sym- 
bols, the forces, and the appliances with which the writers assume the readers 
to be familiar. It is easy to pronounce words, to speak names which are 
used to characterize processes and to symbolize personal experience, and yet 
the speaker may be as innocent of their full force and meaning as the child 
who learns to read and spell, and perchance to define “ psychology.” 
Of course we all believe in learning to read. I yield to no one in my es- 
timate of its preéminent value. I am accustomed to say to my pupils in 
mathematics and mechanics: ‘“ When you have acquired the power to read 
any book you meet, you no longer need my assistance.” To test them, I 
give them a difficult book and tell them to return the next day or the next 
week and read it to me with such interlineations and amplifications and 
illustrations as my dull intellect and limited experience may be supposed to 
require before I can fully grasp the thought. To read human experience 
in a book means a great deal. It requires great and elaborate preparation. 
Dr. Harris appears to fail to see in manual training anything of value in 
learning to read. He does not see that it helps “to give to the pupil the use 
of the means for availing himself of the mental products of the race.” In 
his estimation, “its whole educative effect is exhausted in a brief time at 
the manual-training school;” it has no perennial usefulness. In all this 
Dr. Harris shows that he has not yet caught the meaning of manual train- 
ing. He not only fails to appreciate the typical nature of its subject-matter, 
 
-P-A-G-E-88
  
  88 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
but he does not detect in its round of personal experience that discipline of 
the individual which is absolutely essential to the learning ‘of the symbols 
in which is stored up, in one form and another, the vast and varied experi- 
ence of the race. i 
Last summer I visited the Yosemite and the Yellowstone. I had read 
them up as fully as possiblé before my visit. I had endeavored “to learn 
the experiences” of other men who had seen them, and “to receive the 
whole of human experience” in those places from poring over printed 
pages: to see with other men’s eyes, to feel with other men’s nerves, and to 
think with other men’s brains. How stale and flat my reading was com- 
pared with the vigor and color of my subsequent personal experience! 
When next I read of such wonders in some land inaccessible to me, I shall 
interpret what others say through the medium of my late experience, and 
with far better chance of success. 
The application of this illustration is easily made. A manual-training 
school gives one a wealth of personal experience with which to interpret 
the experience of the race. Every properly conducted manual exercise is 
a lesson in learning to read the language of human life, human activities, 
and human conflicts. That part of human history which finds its way into 
books is not all of history, and he who would understand men must read 
more than books; he must not neglect to study those manifold relations 
and experiences which do not admit of verbal expression. Many of these 
greatly important matters are systematically arranged under the head of 
manual training. 
In assuming a judicial attitude, Dr. Harris is not singular; we all ought 
to do the same. He who unduly advocates or unduly condemns an educa- 
tional feature, is unworthy of confidence. If I should maintain that one 
study is so superior to another—e.g., that rhetoric is so superior to chemis- 
try that it ought to drive the latter from the curriculum, or that projection 
drawing is so inferior to reading that it ought not to appear at all in com- 
petition with it—everyone would see that my judgment was unsound. In 
preparing food for the body, the skillful cook puts in a little of this, more 
of that, and most of a third, because such proportions produce the best re- 
sult. Can we say that one element is more necessary than another where 
all are essential? It is the same in preparing food for the mind. Is there 
any conflict between learning to read books and learning the arts of con- 
struction? Does anyone propose to stop teaching reading for the sake of 
any feature or all the features of manual training? Certainly not; and 
this Dr. Harris knows full well. Must I then admit that reading is so very 
valuable that there shall be nothing but reading in the school? Because 
bread is so very valuable must we leave meat out? That is really the drift 
of Dr. Harris’s argument. “The aggregate experience of mankind,” he 
says, “has chosen for the work of the school the mastery of letters.” In 
this realm of letters he finds mathematics, geography, history, literature,
-P-A-G-E-89
  MANUAL TRAINING. 89 
  
and language itself. These are so supremely necessary that all else must 
be excluded to give them all possible room and time. 
It is this extravagant one-sidedness which I strongly protest against. I 
believe, first, that after two-thirds or three-fourths of the curriculum have 
been given to the mastery and use of books (including books of science), 
it is less necessary to give the remaining third or fourth to more books than 
it is to devote it to manual training, including rational drawing; and sec- 
ondly, I believe that such a combination results in a more complete mastery 
of those same books than now follows from the exclusive program which 
Dr. Harris appears to approve. 
WHEN TO TAKE UP AND WHEN TO LAY DOWN TOOLS. 
But I am not through with Mr. Brown. He too introduces an illustra- 
tion which he does not make the most of. Speaking of the child’s increasing 
power to rely upon experience, and his ability to learn mechanical processes 
from drawing, he says, parenthetically: “Who will say that the educational 
value of constructing a railroad bridge with his pencil is essentially less to 
an engineer than if he constructed it with tools?” 
Now, first, I suppose he means the educational value of learning to con- 
struct, etc. If the man is already an engineer, and knows how to design 
and execute the drawings of a bridge, there is little educational value in so 
doing. Again, if he already knows how to construct a bridge with tools, 
there is little educational value in so constructing it. Hence, if we make 
anything out of the illustration, we must suppose that Mr. Brown is com- 
paring the educational value of learning how to design a bridge without 
either learning or knowing how to construct it, with the educational value 
of learning how to construct with tools a bridge designed by another. I 
suppose this is what Mr. Brown means, in spite of the fact that, as every 
engineer knows, no one can.properly design a bridge in all its details without 
knowing substantially the processes of its construction. One cannot prop- 
erly draw a piece (strut or tie) of a bridge without knowing its material, its 
exact shape and dimensions, the most minute details of its connection with 
other pieces, the strength of the piece and the strength of all its connections. 
This exact knowledge is in part what one learns in manual training. 
Hence, I will submit for comparison with the above, a third proposition, 
which more nearly than either of the two given represents the manual- 
training idea, viz.: compare with the above the educational value of learn- 
ing both to design a bridge with pencil, and to construct it with tools. Is 
not this third superior to either of the others? 
The engineer who is competent to design a bridge, is like Mr. Harris’s 
general who is competent to plan and win a battle: he is competent only 
when he is familiar with the details of the execution. 
But Mr. Brown does not do himself justice. He means that when one 
learns how to construct things he may cease to construct them. Precisely ;  
-P-A-G-E-90

  sosay I. That is just the manual-training idea. When a boy has learned 
to make a plow-handle, he stops making plow-handles and learns something 
new either in kind or degree. Moreover, after he has been over generous 
courses of processes in widely different fields, so that his experience is as 
wide and as deep as the demands of intelligence, and after he has had op- 
portunity to exercise his executive faculties by duly reflecting upon and 
elaborating the ideas obtained from his large personal experience, and the 
ideas which that experience has enabled him to draw from the recorded ex- 
perience of others, he may lay aside his tools, or use them only as aids in 
scientific investigation. 
But when shall he first take up these tools, and this pencil, and when 
shall he lay them down? If I understand Mr. Brown correctly, he would 
do both in the primary school or not at all! Incredible as this may appear 
to those who know something about the maturity required to grasp the 
theory of tools and mechanical processes, this appears to be Mr. Brown’s 
position in the paper published in June Education. 
As for Mr. Harris, I do not think he admits manual training anywhere 
into the general education of the ordinary boy. It occupies a position so 
low in his scale of educational values that it is far out of sight. Mr. Brown’s 
second period in the development of the intelligence is from ten to seventeen 
or twenty years of age, during which period observation and reflection are 
necessarily combined. In my judgment this is the period for manual train- 
ing. Before the age of reflection, manual training is purely superficial, all 
hand-work is mere imitation, all sequences of steps are purely arbitrary, and 
there is neither logic nor rationality in tool-work. The young child’s time 
is better employed in studying external nature. Hence I say, till twelve 
years children need only knives and scissors, clay and pasteboard, micro- 
scopes, and facilities for arranging, classifying and sketching leaves, seeds, 
flowers, insects, birds, etc. No regular workshop with logical exercises in 
the elements of construction, no systematic study of forms and the graces of 
ornament, should be introduced till the maturity involved in reflection is 
reached. 
I entirely agree with Mr. Brown in this, that when the learner has reached 
the stage where his experience with the concrete is sufficiently extensive to 
enable him to fully see mechanical processes mentally, and to abstract his 
thinking from individuals, and to deal with universals, he should certainly 
pass beyond the realm of ordinary shop-work. He thus reaches the period 
and sphere of free activity; he has laid the foundation, and may securely 
build his structure of higher education. Manual training deals with foun- 
dation stones; and let me tell you who would leave them out, you are not 
building wisely. There is something vital in this rational personal experi- 
ence with that material world which forms the environment of our lives, 
which broadens the mind, which heightens the intelligence, and which 
strengthens and ennobles both intellect and character.

CONCLUSION. 
I have spoken of some of the results of the St. Louis school. They are 
greater than I can grasp; they are more in number than I can count; they 
are found in a thousand homes, and in the lives of a thousand boys and men, 
These timid conservatives endeavor to reason away our success, and ascribe 
it to physical exercise, to enthusiastic and able teachers, to a concentrated 
curriculum of book studies, to pupils of unusual ability, and to a general 
craze which blinds people’s eyes and warps their judgments. 
Individual instances are, I know, of doubtful utility in establishing the 
value of a course of training, but thinking people do not omit their evi- 
dence. Is it nothing that the student who outranks all others in the fresh- 
man class of the polytechnic school of Washington University is from the 
Manual Training School, that the ranking sophomore is a manual graduate, 
and that the ranking junior is also a graduate of the same school, and that 
this last is one of the finest mathematical scholars the University has seen 
for twenty years? Is it nothing that the only student graduating from the 
St. Louis Law School this year with the grade of Summa cum Laude was a 
graduate of the Manual Training School ? 
Do these instances gratify that gloomy conviction which Mr. Brown says 
is ever becoming stronger among those educational critics who are best fitted 
to judge of educational values—*that one of the baneful effects of the 
workshop as an educational factor is its tendency to so limit the pupil’s field 
of view that should his vocation be any of these industrial arts, he will be- 
come mentally as well as physically its slave” ? 
Is it not rather to be expected that when all boys are enabled to have 
the benefits of a rational course of manual training between the ages of 
twelve and eighteen, this slavery of vocations will cease to exist? When 
all men will be lifted just high enough on the scale of intelligent freedom 
to do away with all those lower forms of human activity which now approx- 
imate to automatism, and to substitute in their stead with a wealth of inven- 
tion surpassing our wildest dreams the willing forces of nature. 
Ancient civilization could not imagine a people cultivated and refined 
who did not depend upon the labor and service of a horde of slaves. Every 
Spartan had his Helot, and every Athenian citizen commanded the labor of 
three slaves. 
We recognize no slave either of body or mind. If we would emancipate 
the race on the one hand from that intellectual bondage which lingers in 
the traditions of education and which closes our eyes to the force and value 
of personal contact with the activities of modern life, and on the other hand 
from that modern slavery which denies to those who must labor with their 
hands that sort of mental cultivation which can lift the humblest occupa- 
tions to a higher level, and invest them with new dignity, while the forces 
of nature become our only drudges— if we would work to this glorious end, 
we must recognize in our system of universal education the conditions of 
healthy growth and development.

THE INTELLECTUAL VALUE OF TOOL-WORK. 
W. T. HARRIS, CONCORD, MASS. 
Man, like the animal, has natural wants, which he must gratify in order 
to live on the earth. While the animal needs food, and to some extent 
shelter, man needs food, and shelter, and clothing. In order to get posses- 
sion of these things, he must struggle for them and wrest them from nature, 
depriving plants and animals of their vital principles and converting them 
to his own uses. Whereas the plant feeds upon soil and atmosphere in so 
far as it finds them in immediate contact with itself, and the animal is able 
to seek a new environment and use its limbs as tools or instruments with 
which to seize upon the means of supplying its wants,— man on the other 
hand, although less endowed with strength than many of the animals, and 
with scanty natural provision for clothing, yet is able to surpass the animal 
in gratification of his wants, by cunningly aiding his natural forces and 
instruments by invented ones. He devises instruments out of natural ma- 
terials, mineral, animal and vegetable substances and their chemic elements, 
of such efficiency as to enable him to command the resources of land, and 
sea, and air. 
Whatever seems at first a limitation to him or a hostile might threatening 
him with destruction or imposing upon him the necessity of drudgery for 
daily assistance, becomes by-and-by an auxiliary power friendly to man 
after he has conquered it by the magic of his intellect. 
Man as inventor of tools and machines, and the combiner of nature’s 
forces, presents for us the most interesting object ih the universe. Let us 
take a survey of him asthe maker of tools and the wielder of them. Intel- 
lectual and moral power unite to give man this power of invention. It is 
intellectual cunning which discovers the powers and adaptations of things 
and converts them to his uses. It is the moral power of self-conquest that 
enables man to sacrifice the ease and comfort of the present moment and to 
endure privation, in order by industry and patient attention to accumulate 
a capital of physical means and acquired experience sufficient to produce an 
invention. 
The first step above the brute instinct begins when man looks beyond 
things as he sees them existing before him, and commences to consider their 
possibilities; he begins to add to his external seeing an internal seeing; the 
world begins to assume a new aspect; each object appears to be of larger 
scope than its present existence, for there is a sphere of possibility environ- 
ing it, a sphere which the sharpest animal eyes of lynx or eagle cannot see, 
but which man, endowed with this new faculty of inward sight, perceives at 
once. To this insight into possibilities there loom up uses and adaptations, 
transformations and combinations in a long series stretching into the infinite
-P-A-G-E-93
  MANUAL TRAINING. 93 
behind each finite real thing. The bodily eyes see the real objects, but can- 
not see the infinite trails—they are invisible except to the inward eyes of 
the mind. 
What we call directive power on the part of man, his combining and or- 
ganizing power, all rests on this power to see beyond the real things before 
the senses to the ideal. possibilities invisible to the brute. The more clearly 
man sees these ideals, the more perfectly he can construct for himself another 
set of conditions than those in which he finds himself. 
Men as tool-workers, as managers of machines, participate in this higher 
kind of perception in different degrees, but all have it to some extent. The 
lowest human laborer has the dimmest notions of these ideals; they are fur- 
nished him by others; he is told what to do; he furnishes the hands to work 
with, and someone else furnishes the brains or most of the brain-work. 
Unless a directing mind is near by to help at every moment with the details 
of some ideal, the rude laborer ceases his work, having no knowledge of 
what is required next. His capacity to grasp an ideal is very small; he can 
only take it in tiny fragments —small patterns dealt out to him as a hand 
by the directing brain of the overseer or “ boss.” 
It seems a waste of power to have two brains to govern one pair of hands. 
It is evidently desirable to have each laborer developed in his brain so as 
to be able to see ideals as well as to realize them by his hands. 
The development of this desirable power we call education of the intellect, 
and its chief means is science. Science is the systematized results of obser- 
vation. Each fact in the world is placed in the light of all the other facts. 
All facts are made to help explain each fact. This is science. Now each 
fact represents only one of the many possible states of existence which a 
thing may have. When one state of existence.is real the others are mere 
possibilities, or, as they are called, “ potentialities.” Thus water may exist 
as liquid, or vapor, or ice, but when it is ice, the liquid and vapor states are 
mere potentialities. 
Science collects about each subject all its phases of existence under dif- 
ferent conditions; it teaches the student to look at a thing as a whole and 
see in it not only what is visible before his senses, but what also is not 
realized and remains dormant or potential. The scientifically educated la- 
borer, therefore, is of a higher type than the mere “hand-laborer”’ because 
_ he has learned to see in each thing its possibilities. He sees each thing in 
the perspective of its history. Here then in the educated laborer we have 
a hand belonging to a brain that directs, or that can intelligently compre- 
hend a detailed statement of an ideal to be worked out. The laborer and 
the “boss” are united in one man. 
There are, as we have said, different degrees of educated capacity, due to 
the degree in which this power of seeing invisible potentialities or ideals is 
developed. The lowest humanity needs constant direction, and works only 
under the eye of an overseer; it can work with advantage only at simple
-P-A-G-E-94
  94 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
processes; by repetition it acquires skill at a simple manipulation. The 
incessant repetition of one muscular act deadens into habit, and less and 
less brain-work goes to its performance. When a process is reduced to 
simple steps, however, it is easy to invent some sort of machine that can 
perform it as well or better than the human drudge. Accordingly, division 
of labor gives occasion to labor-saving machinery. The human drudge 
cannot compete with the machine, and is thrown out of eniployment and 
goes to the almshouse, or perhaps starves. If he could only be educated 
and learn to see ideals, he could have a place as manager of the machine. 
The machine requires an alert intellect to direct and control it, but a mere 
“hand” cannot serve its purpose. The higher development of man pro- 
duced by science therefore acts as a goad to spur on the lower orders of 
humanity to become educated intellectually. Moreover, the education in 
science enables the laborer to easily acquire an insight into the construction 
and management of machines. This makes it possible for him to change 
his vocation readily. There is a greater and greater resemblance of each 
process of human labor to every other, now that an age of machinery has 
arrived. The differences of manipulation are grown less, because the ma- 
chine is assuming the hand-work, and leaving only the brain-work for the 
laborer. Hence there opens before labor a great prospect of freedom in 
the future. Each person can choose a new vocation and succeed in it with- 
out long and tedious apprenticeship, provided that he is educated in general 
science. 
If he understands only the theory of one machine he may direct or man- 
age any form or style of it. He could not so easily learn an entirely dif- 
ferent machine unless he had learned the entire theory of machinery. The 
wider his knowledge and the more general its character, the larger the 
sphere of his freedom and power. If he knows the scientific theory of 
nature’s forces he comprehends readily not only the machines, but also all 
nature’s phenomena as manifestations of those forces. Knowledge is edu- 
cative in proportion to its enlightening power or its general applicability: 
The knowledge of an art is educative because it gives one command in a 
sphere of activity; it explains effects, and enables the artisan to be both 
brain and hand to some extent. A science lifts him to a much higher plane 
educatively, because he can see a wide margin of possibilities or ideals out- 
side of the processes in use, and outside of the tools and machines employed. 
Education then takes these three steps: first, to do what is directed by 
authority; secondly, to know the theory of the art or trade as it is and has 
come down by tradition; thirdly, to know the general science of the sub- 
ject, and comprehend not only the processes that have been realized, but the 
possibility of others. 
The civilization in which we live is well characterized as a scientific one, 
and it is making great strides towards the conquest of nature. It demands, 
too, as we see, an education for all people. There is less and less place left
-P-A-G-E-95
  MANUAL TRAINING. 95 
for the mere drudge, all hands and no brains. Machinery can do his work 
so cheaply that his wages must be very slender. The education demanded, 
moreover, is not the training in technical skill so much as in science. For 
the more general training emancipates the laborer from the deadening 
effects of repetition and habit, the monotony of attending the machine, and 
opens up a vista of new invention and more useful combinations. 
While the student is learning a method of doing something his brain is 
exercised; when the process has become a habit it is committed to his hand, 
and his intellect is not required again except for new combinations. This 
is true of all machine-work, of all tool-work. Its theory is soon exhausted, 
and the deadening process of habit sets in. Science is perpetually living, 
always educative. The mind goes from principle to principle; it discovers 
and inventories new provinces of nature, and applies its principles to their 
explanation. In reaching vaster unities of nature it finds deeper principles. 
Not the study of tools and machinery, but that of natural science, is more 
educative, therefore, because it keeps the mind in perpetual activity. 
If we pause here and ask ourselves, what is the scope of the inquiry thus 
far made? we shall be obliged to confess that we have regarded man only 
in his animal nature, possessing bodily wants of food, clothing, and shelter. 
We see at once that this is no inventory of man’s wants—it falls infinitely 
short of his requirements as a spiritual being. If machinery were invented 
so that he could get food, clothing and shelter in abundance and of the 
finest quality at the cost of a moment’s labor each day, all this would be of 
small account as an item of civilization unless the human energy saved from 
drudgery had found channels of expenditure in the vocations relating di- 
rectly to the education of the spiritual nature of man. 
Here we come to the all-important distinction between that which belongs 
only to the nature of a means instrumental to something else different from 
itself, and that which is an end for itself. The human mind or soul is an 
end for itself. Matter and the body are only instrumental, only means for 
the perfection of the soul. 
What, we inquire, are the ideals of perfection of the soul, then? For it 
would seem that all through our industrial processes there should have pre- 
vailed a guiding purpose to subordinate all human endeavor to the interest 
of the mind. We have already taken note of the science of nature as a 
purely theoretical study, more educative than any form of art because it is 
the source of inexhaustible activity in the intellect. Nature in time and 
space is one world for man’s scientific mastery. Over against this there is 
another world for his science: the world of mind. 
Nature is before us as organic and inorganic realms. Mind reveals itself 
in three forms, thinking, willing, and feeling. Leaving this psychological 
point of view, it will be more interesting for us to look at the world of hu- 
manity in three aspects. Human nature has revealed itself in institutions, 
social structures organized so as to make the strong help the weak; the ma-

ture assist the immature; the wise the simple: these institutions are the 
family, civil society, the state or nation, and the church. These institutions 
are the outgrowth of the human will. In the business of education the 
youth learns human nature as will in studying history —history taken in a 
very broad sense. But even history in a narrow sense gives him glimpses 
of all these institutions acting and reacting upon each of these. One sees 
the evolution of civilization by the study of history. Here then is a branch 
of study which we must regard as educative in the highest possible degree. 
Natural science, valuable as it is in emancipating us from drudgery, is rather 
ascience of that which is a means for the development of man as a spiritual 
being. But history is a science of that which is an end for itself, because 
it is the exhibition of the structure and evolution of civilization. 
History is only one of the spiritual sciences. There are sciences that 
relate to mind as intellect in its essence such as philosophy and psychology 
and logic, with kindred sciences like comparative philology offering to us the 
revelations which different peoples of the earth have made of their mental 
structure in language. This study deals also with that which is an end for 
itself. Again, there is the department of literature and art, in which man 
has portrayed for himself his human nature in the form of feelings and con- 
victions leading outward and upward to thoughts and actions. For the 
heart is in a certain sense the primitive fountain from which flows the life- 
thread before it is divided into the strands of intellect and will. Literature 
shows us this deepest source of civilization. Homer, Dante, Shakespeare, 
and Goethe reveal prophetically what after ages work out into clear thoughts 
and actions. Here then is another, and a very important study of what is 
always an end for itself. 
History, the revelation of the nature of human will; philology and phi- 
losophy, the revelation of what is essential in the human intellect, or the 
divine part of it; literature and the fine arts, the revelation of the human 
heart! 
First, human nature evolves a dim feeling; then develops it into an idea; 
then realizes it in a deed, and it becomes an institution to bless the race. 
There are three departments to the world of human nature, and two de- 
partments to the world of nature below man—organic in plant and animal, 
inorganic in matter and force. 
With this survey of human learning, we are now prepared to see what 
the school has done in the past and present to provide an educative process 
for the child by giving him a survey of the two worlds in which he lives, 
the material and spiritual worlds—the world of means to an end outside 
of itself, and the world which is an end for itself. 
School education should open five windows of the soul, and let it look 
out upon the two departments of nature and the three departments of mind. 
Now it surprises us at first to see that school education has done this very 
thing by its course of study. Arithmetic gives the first glimpse of inor-
-P-A-G-E-97
  MANUAL TRAINING. 97 
  
ganic nature, for it reveals the nature of quantity, and quantity gives the 
law to time and space, and to all bodies. Then in geography a glimpse is 
given of organic nature as related to the inorganic on the one hand, and as 
related to man on the other—a very educative study indeed! Then there 
is grammar, which looks into the logical structure of the intellect as re- 
vealed in language; history, which reveals the human will; literature in 
the school readers, showing how the great geniuses of the language have 
revealed the aspirations of the people in impassioned prose and poetry. 
The school does something more than give this all-round glimpse of man’s 
five-fold world. The school teaches the pupil how to restrain his animal 
impulses to prate and chatter, disturbing the work of others, and himself 
idle; it teaches him the great lesson of industry and perseverance ; it teaches 
him regularity and punctuality, the great virtues that lie at the basis of all 
human combination; it teaches courtesy and good social behavior; it lays 
greatest stress on truth-speaking, by showing the pupil in every recitation 
how important it is to be accurate in statement, and to fix the exact facts 
by verification and research. 
The studies and disciplines of the school therefore open the windows of 
the intellect upon all points of the horizon of existence, and they train the 
will to labor at what is most difficult because most unusual for the animal 
nature. The lower organized human being can work with his hands with 
pleasure, while it is still a task of great difficulty for him to contemplate 
ideas or undertake any sustained trains of thought. If youth can be taught 
to bring their powers to bear on such ideal subjects as arithmetic, grammar, 
history, and literature, they certainly can with ease give their mind to any 
form of manual training or the work of external observation, because the 
“ greater includes the less, and the studies of pure science are far more diffi- 
cult to carry on than studies in applied science. 
If we now ask the question, What is the comparative value of tool-work? 
we may see our way to reply: Tool-work without the theory of construction 
is educative to some extent, especially in the first stages of its practice. 
Tool-work taught with the theory of machinery, with applied mathematics, 
is far more educative than mere tool-work, and its educative influence lasts 
for a much longer time. Tool-work with its theory and with natural sci- 
ence is permanently educative, and it does much to raise manual labor above 
drudgery, and especially is this the case if it is studied with the history of 
ornamentation and with careful cultivation of zsthetic taste. 
But when compared with the present course of study in the schools it 
cannot be claimed that manual training opens any new windows of the soul, 
although it may give a more distinct view from the window that opens to- 
wards inorganic nature. 
There remains, notwithstanding, a permanently valid place for the man- 
ual-training school side by side with apprentice schools for all youths who 
are old enough to enter a trade, and who are unwilling to carry on any

further their purely culture studies. Cultivate the humanities first, and 
afterwards the industrial faculties. In our civilization there ascend out of 
the abyss of the future, problems of anarchy on the one hand and of social- 
ism on the other; individualism carried to such extremes that all sub- 
ordination to peaceable and established law is deemed a fetter to freedom. 
This centrifugal tendency to anarchy is paralleled by a centripetal tendency 
that wishes to have the central government perform not only all the duties 
of establishing justice and securing the public peace, but also to have it 
own all the property and manage all the industries. In short, the nation- 
alists propose abolishing the sphere of competition and individual enter- 
prise. Education in the history of the world, and in the literature that 
reveals the aspirations of the human heart, is well calculated to prepare the 
youth for a rational verdict on the extreme issues that will continually arise 
among a free people. Above all, we must never yield to the economic 
spirit that proposes to curtail the humanizing studies in our schools for the 
sake of adding special training for industries. Rather must we do what we 
can to extend the period of study in pure science and the humanities, know- 
ing as we do that all which goes to develop the ability of the youth to see 
possibilities and ideals, goes to make him a more productive laborer in the 
fields of industry. 
THE VALUE OF TOOL-INSTRUCTION AS RELATED TO 
THE ACTIVE PURSUITS IN WHICH PUPILS MAY 
SUBSEQUENTLY ENGAGE. 
SELIM H. PEABODY, CHAMPAIGN, ILLINOIS. 
  In a report formerly presented to the National Council of Education, I 
endeavored to draw the distinction between. the pedagogic and the economic 
value of tool-instruction. The difference lies chiefly in the ends sought; 
the first aims at a higher training, discipline, culture, in the worker; the 
second aims at a larger excellence in the workmanship. Better- workmen 
or better work. t 
It is not presumed that either of these results can exist in the absence of 
the other. Better workmen, better in the sense of having larger and higher 
intellectual power, should produce better work; while in the individual, the 
constant effort to improve the quality of the work, should elevate in some 
degree the power of the worker. 
If we seek to estimate the value of tool-instruction as related to the active 
pursuits in which the pupils may hereafter engage, the valuation must be 
made as to these elements, viz.: 
1. The pedagogic or intellectual value, or influence, in strengthening, en-
-P-A-G-E-99
  MANUAL TRAINING. 99: 
  
larging, and balancing the pupil himself; that is, in fitting him generally 
to be better able to cope with the difficulties inherent in any active pur- 
suit. Or— 
2. The economic, often called, without sufficient reflection, the practical 
value, which may in specific ways enable him the better to enter upon special 
pursuits, and to accomplish large and useful results; to which may be added 
some inquiry into the moral influences of tool-instruction, if any such in- 
fluences exist. . 
If I correctly understand the distribution of the topics to be discussed 
this evening, the first portion, as I have made the analysis, is that assigned 
to Dr. Harris, the second to myself. Whatever results of value are likely 
to be produced in furnishing intellectual growth and fertile vigor to the 
pupil receiving them, will be found bearing practical and economic fruitage ; 
for power is power, and intellectual force will make itself felt. It is pre- 
cisely this larger intellectual factor which is wanted in practical affairs, in 
active pursuits. And this we understand to be one important claim made 
in behalf of tool-instruction: that, waiving the question of intellectual 
discipline — which question we have laid aside as not belonging to the work 
of the moment— whatever mental growth is assured receives in this way a 
more useful, economic, practical bent, makes the student more intimately 
and fruitfully acquainted with things and affairs, and thus fits him for more 
immediate and efficient service in the active pursuits of life. In the com- 
mon phrase, the student is given power to do something, and this doing 
something is made the standard by which his dynamic energies are to be 
measured. J am not now to stop and inquire whether these standards of 
measurement are philosophic and just—they may be, or may not be; but 
they are very commonly used, and the question is raised as to the influences 
and results of tool-instruction when measured by these standards. If it be 
true that the intellectual powers thus strengthened may be more readily 
turned to practical account, in so much and so far as this claim can be made 
good so much may be set down upon the credit side of the account with 
tool-instruction as a factor in education. 
That which we rather vaguely call practical ability exhibits two distinct 
elements, often united in very varied proportions in thé same person. The 
first is a large and prolific intelligence, which recognizes the relations of 
parts to wholes; of means to ends; of causes and effects; of purposes, and 
the processes of thought and action needful to crystallize them into events. 
The second is the possession and control of some technical skill that can do 
some specific thing. The first of these is directive; it devises, plans, lays 
out work to be done by self or others; it designs houses, lays down the lines 
for ships, sees bridges spanning streams and chasms, in visions which it 
transmutes into substantial realities; it is the motive power of the engineer, 
and of the man of business who plans and executes great enterprises. The 
second is operative; it has acquired skill in manipulation; drives a nail;

strikes a baseball; touches the strings of a viol or the keys of a piano; 
operates for cataract; and puts the tenderest touches upon the palpitating 
flesh-tints of a painting, or the fine scorn upon the marble lips of an Apollo. 
The first works through the intellectual, constructive, logical faculties. 
One may think out all the details of an enterprise, or of a structure, and 
determine all the steps necessary to bring either to completion, in the still 
darkness of the night, when not a single item of actual performance is pos- 
sible. The second works often under the forces of habit, of muscular and 
tactual sense, mingled with subtle influences of feeling—I had almost said 
instinets—that do not follow logical direction or control. There are mul- 
titudes of acts that cannot be taught logically —one neither bows nor fingers 
a violin by anything analogous to the rule of three. There are many things 
that no man can teach me; he may show me how he does them, but I must 
learn to do them by myself. For example, learning to ride a bicycle, or to 
strike a base-ball. In short, the peculiar ability of the so-called practical 
man consists either in aptness of planning, or deftness of execution, or in a 
combination of the two. Now the first of these elements rests on strong 
and vigorous intellectual power — power that is vigorous by nature, and has 
been strengthened by culture and discipline. It is not the only one, but it 
is one of the crowning glories of all well-directed and scholarly culture, 
that produces in men such capacities. It is exhibited by men of affairs in 
all the commanding walks of life. This class is full of men of liberal, 
literary, and scholarly culture, graduated from colleges and universities. 
It includes, also, men of superb natural gifts, who have not enjoyed such 
scholarly opportunities. Side by side, alike in eminence, different in ser- 
vice, stand Whitney, Henry, Fourneyron, with the Stephensons, and Erics- 
son, and Edison. I shall not suggest, even by implication, that the 
manual-training schools which have been able to fill their desks with the 
brightest boys in our large and wealthy cities, will not aid in producing 
many such large-minded men. They ought to do so, for in each case care 
has been taken to make these schools first-class high schools, in every re- 
spect equal to the best, plus the specialty of tool-instruction. It is scarcely 
just to credit all the valuable results which might reasonably be expected 
to come from the other departments, to this one specialty which bears the 
palm of novelty. 
All vigorous intellectual training aids to secure the qualities referred to, 
but especially is it aided by instruction in the sciences, natural and mathe- 
matical, when taught, as they should be, with constant reference to their 
relations to existing and practical things. In certain respects nothing can 
be more fruitful than work done in the drawing-room, particularly in such 
forms of drawing as lay hold on dimensions and relations, as well as on the 
expression of things as they seem. The method of projection involves and 
cultivates insight into forms and relations. It helps marvelously towards 
that perception which sees through the concrete to the essence, and, there- 
‘ 
 
-P-A-G-E-101
101 
  
  fore, if one may use the metaphor, looks into the souls of things through 
their cruder external forms. The purer mathematical concepts are the fine 
creations of the intellect, in which the imagination is aided by the methods 
of correct drawing much more than by the concrete cutting of wood or metal. 
I am persuaded that tool-instruction has very little to offer in aid of that 
large development which I have described as the first form of practical 
ability. I think so, first, because I observe that tool-work has to deal with 
detail; with minute items of measurement and exactness of fit; with the 
removal of substance, here a little and there a little; all of which activities 
lead from, not toward, the broader and more general view of the relations 
which make up the whole, and its nearer and more remote adaptations. I 
shall not go to the workman who fits and polishes ivory keys, and adjusts 
their delicate movements, when I wish a man to plan a grand organ. I 
shall not ask the smith who turns eye-ends upon steel rods, and does it well, 
too, when I want a design for a bridge that will span the waters of the Mis- 
sissippi. The master bridge-builder may know how to forge and weld 
steel: I doubt if Eads, or Roebling, or Sooy-Smith did know that; but if 
they did, while it might aid in working out details which might have been 
left to subordinates, that knowledge would not make them the master engi- 
neers they were. I know something of the personnel of the great Baldwin 
locomotive works, and I am quite sure that one of the most practical men 
of the firm that controls that immense manufactory is one who has little or 
no personal knowledge of hand tool-work in any of its many departments. 
I think so, secondly, because I find that very few workmen, even of those 
called skilled, are competent to plan and arrange work for themselves and 
others. A great many superintendents and managers do come up from the 
ranks, but they rise for the very reason that they show in themselves ca- 
pacities for something more than being the mere manipulators of tools. 
Not every first-fiddle can be a Theodore Thomas. I once heard a reverend 
gentleman of note, but one fond of paradoxes, say that a good trade is a 
liberal education. I cannot accept the proposition, because I rarely find 
good trades-workers who show even the elements of that large and broad 
understanding which is the evidence of good education. 
Toward the second form of practical ability, that which may be called 
technique, tool-instruction has much to offer, but usually in limited direc- 
tions. We may make a boy skillful in a fair degree at joinery, at the turn- 
ing-lathe, at the file-bench, at the anvil, at the manipulation of machine 
tools. I question whether this last item ought not to be omitted from the 
list of'examples of pure tool-instruction. I think it a much easier, and at 
the same time a more intellectual accomplishment, to learn to run an engine 
lathe exactly, than to learn to use the file with precision. But there is a 
series of mechanical arts which can be taught in schools, and taught fairly 
well. Wherever these arts touch the needs and uses of practical life, the

  learners have acquired something that they can put to practical use. So 
far, good. 
The forms of tool-instruction which have been chosen are doubtless those 
most readily available in the school workshop. But they touch only a very 
small part of either the tools or the methods which come into use in the 
active pursuits of life. They are those with which less than ten per cent. 
of the world’s workers win their bread. All forms of work in leather are 
omitted, and most of them must remain so. All work in which mortar is 
used is for the most part omitted. A long list might be made of trades for 
which the tool-instruction now gives no preparation. 
I very well know that I shall be met right here with the very earnest dis- 
claimer, in the statement that the tool-instruction of the schools was never 
meant to teach trades. In my judgment, so much the worse. I wish that 
they taught carpentry, for example, to such as might themselves be or might 
control carpenters, etc. It is said that the true purpose of tool-instruction 
is to obtain such a control of the physical powers, notably those of the hand 
and eye, as shall develop a series of faculties hitherto neglected in our gen- 
eral instruction, but of great value in the harmonious development of the 
whole man. If that statement be true—and I venture to express my dis- 
sent—then it removes this part of the subject from my field of inquiry. 
Another assertion may be more pertinent to my discussion, namely, that 
the tools whose use is taught in the school shops are the exemplars or types 
of all tools, so that a pupil who has obtained mastery over these has there- 
fore command over all; that he has acquired not simply the use of these 
tools, but the use of all tools—that indefinite something so frequently eulo- 
gized, “the use of tools.” 
To this proposition I demur. I would not refer to it, if I had not found 
it so often insisted upon by the advocates of tool-instruction. If any of them 
have come to think otherwise, I shall take courage in the countenance they 
give to so much of my opinions. I am glad to feel assured that there are 
more than seven typical tools; and that there are tools which from their 
varied uses may really be counted as several and distinct as they are used. 
But I still think that there is something more than science to be learned in 
learning the use of a tool, and that something is habit. Habit comes slowly, 
with much and patient practice; and the very essence of habit is, that while 
it makes one form of action easy, it, pari passu, makes any other form of 
action difficult. If the one use of a hammer which the boy has acquired 
does not interfere with the use of it in a different way, or for a different 
purpose, then I much doubt whether he has really learned that one use. 
Certain kinds of skill require that a man stop thinking, and put himself as 
nearly as possible into the condition of a machine, and carry through a 
series of movements like a machine. Many things in the technique of that 
most refined art, music, are mechanical, and the learner takes long and mo- 
notonous rehearsals to insure the formation of correct habits.
-P-A-G-E-103
  MANUAL TRAINING. 103 
One thing, however, should be conceded: While the habits acquired 
with one tool, or in one of its uses, may for a time stand in the way of other 
acquisitions, the methods used in acquiring those habits—that is, of learn- 
ing that tool—may assist to show the proper steps with which to approach 
the next tool problem, and thus subsequent progress may be the more read- 
ily made. : 
Certain collateral and most useful acquisitions may be made in the use of 
all tools—such as method, accuracy, perseverance, industry, ete., about 
which I am led to a brief word. Doubtless all good tool-work inculcates 
these most excellent qualities, and so does every other form of good instruc- 
tion. But Dr. Harris well says that “these are formal and not substantial 
powers—that is, they derive their value from what they are applied to, and 
they may be mischievous as well as beneficial.” Accuracy, for example, is 
of first importance, and no tool-work that fails to show it in a reasonable 
and constantly refining degree ought for an instant to be tolerated. But 
accuracy, nakedly and without relationships, has no ethical quality. <Ac- 
curacy and truth are not synonyms. Accuracy is good or evil according to 
its purpose. Accuracy in fitting a jimmy, that it may be used for house- 
breaking, means burglary. Accurate pistol practice, on the night before a 
duel, means murder, and nothing less. In like manner, industry is good or 
evil, according to its relationships. The old Scotchwoman was known to 
haye ever a good word for all persons, no matter how vile in the thoughts 
of other people. Somebody said she would speak well even of the devil. 
“Tndeed,” said she, “ye’ll no deny that the de’il’s a vary industrious patr- 
son!” A skillful workman is not necessarily an honest man. If his hon- 
esty is merely the complement of his workmanship, it is but a superficial 
finish, and not the outcome of a just conscience and a pure heart. 
I conclude this paper with this brief summary: 
1. Whatever there may be of general intellectual character in tool- 
instruction, must have a direct and useful bearing upon any or all of the 
active pursuits of life in which pupils may subsequently engage. 
2. Whatever is found therein of special and peculiar quality, will be re- 
stricted mainly to such of the active pursuits as are in nature cognate to 
the specific forms of training acquired in the schools. 
38. Tool-instruction is essentially specific in its character, and its valuable 
service must be sought in special rather than in general discipline. 
I add, as a corollary, the opinion that instead of saying, “ We will not 
teach trades,” we should aim to provide a large and constantly increasing 
series of trade-schools, until all boys, and girls, too, in all-trades, shall have 
the benefits of well-devised and thorough instruction therein.

MANUAL TRAINING IN THE PRIMARY AND THE 
GRAMMAR SCHOOLS. 
HENRY A. WISE, BALTIMORE, MARYLAND. 
  When man fell from his high estate he was told: “In the sweat of thy 
face shalt thou eat bread.” Though this was said centuries ago, it is as true 
to-day as it was then. Those who obey the divine command, and learn to 
labor, not only secure their own happiness, but they also contribute to the 
support and order of society. 
In the work of education the effect to be attained is, to cultivate and fix 
habits of self-activity which will endure to the end of life; to teach pupils to 
labor and to make industry the law of their being. The man who gives his 
children habits of industry, provides for them better than one who gives his 
children a fortune. The problem to-day that many are endeavoring to solve 
is, how they may be able to get along in life without working. Our land is 
so blessed above all others with opportunities for securing the necessaries of 
life—a living can be obtained with comparatively so little effort —specula- 
tion is so rife by which fortunes are made more by chance than by assiduous, 
well-directed effort, that many wait for something to turn up, or devote them- 
selves to speculative methods to obtain a livelihood, rather than to intelli- 
gent industry. To correct this is manifestly desirable, and in order to do so 
the young must be trained in habits of industry. They must be taught to 
know that unless they labor neither can they eat. Labor must be dignified. 
‘Labor of some kind is as necessary to life and happiness as motion is to the 
purity of water. There is no such thing as health or happiness without well- 
formed habits of industry, and in the instruction of youth the chief business 
of the educator lies in training his pupils in good habits. This is the true 
interpretation of the well-known maxim that education is arousing a pupil 
to self-activity ; he must not only be aroused, but he must continue in habits 
of self-activity; it must not be an evanescent arousing, it must be continuous, 
life-enduring. 
Manual training at this time occupies the most prominent place among 
the subjects claiming the attention of educators. The term has not been 
satisfactorily defined, so that what one means when he uses it is not neces- 
sarily what is meant by another. The reasons urged for its introduction 
are by no means the same. Many advocate its introduction into the schools 
with the sincere desire to benefit them; while others, who are unfriendly to 
the public-school system, do so in the hope that their efficiency may be im- 
paired, and that ultimately they may be abolished and every man be com- 
pelled to pay for the education of his child. It is hoped by some that 
cooking-schools, trades schools, and schools for the training of servants will 
be instrumental in solving the labor question, and in fitting the hewers of
-P-A-G-E-105
MANUAL . TRAINING. 105 
  wood and drawers of water to be the efficient servants of the rich, of those 
who in the scuffle for money have been successful. 
True educators, though, cannot consider the matter from these stand- 
points, and they oppose the introduction of anything into the schools which 
will not enhance their usefulness to the people and the state. It would be 
pertinent at this point to discuss the function of the public schools, and the 
limits between which their operations should be confined, but the time 
allowed for the reading of this paper will not permit an examination of 
these questions. Suffice it to say, it is generally conceded by the great body 
of the people of this country that to preserve our institutions there must 
be a system of public education to train the young of the land to be good 
citizens; that the system must embrace in its course all that will most suc- 
cessfully accomplish this purpose, and that its extent must be controlled by 
the length of time necessary for the attainment of the object sought. Those 
who oppose any attempt to introduce manual work into the schools, and those 
closet-pedagogues who would at once convert all the schools into carpenter 
and blacksmith shops, constitute the extremists in this discussion; and as is 
usually the case under such circumstances, the true position lies somewhere 
between the two extremes. The most enlightened community will employ 
every means within its power to discover and train for use all the talent 
born into it; and the proportion of well-educated persons found in any com- 
munity is the measure of its wisdom and civilization. : 
Manual training seems to be the natural outcome or extension of Froe- 
bel’s kindergarten methods, and is essentially objective teaching. The de- 
mand for manual and technical instruction in European countries was 
caused by the decay of the apprenticeship system and the desire of govern- 
ments to supply skilled labor in order to enable their manufacturers to 
compete successfully with those of other countries. 
So far as I am informed, manual training has not been successfully un- 
dertaken in connection with government schools in which pupils below the 
age of twelve or fourteen years are taught. 
In order that what is said in this paper may be understood, it is necessary 
to give an explanation of what the school board of Baltimore city has done 
in regard to manual training. 
In September, 1884, they established a manual-training school after the 
plan of the school at St. Louis, connected with the Washington University. 
In addition to a three-years high-school course of study in the English lan- 
guage, history, mathematics, book-keeping, science, and a thorough course 
in drawing, this school gives instruction in carpentry, wood-turning, pattern- 
making, chipping and filing, forge-work, moulding, soldering and brazing, 
the use of machine-shop tools, and such other instruction of a similar char- 
acter as it may be deemed advisable to add to the foregoing from time to 
time,—it being the intention to divide the working hours of the students as 
nearly as possible equally between the mental and manual exercises. - The

  school differs from the Boys’ High School in omitting from its course of 
study modern and ancient languages, and in giving prominence to mechan- 
ical drawing, and particularly in affording scientific instruction by the 
laboratory method, and practice in the care and use of tools. Those enter- 
ing the school are required to be at least fourteen years of age, and to pass 
a satisfactory examination in reading, writing, spelling, geography, and the 
fundamental operations of arithmetic as applied to integers, fractions, de- 
nominate numbers, and the extraction of the square and cube root of num- 
bers. The school is very popular, and has been successful in a marked 
degree. It began in 1884 with 62 enrolled pupils, and its roll on the 31st 
of December, 1888, was over 500. The cost per pupil for the year 1888 
was $23.23. 
Pupils attending the school pay no fees—the school is absolutely free. 
The school has met with so much success that the old building is found to 
be too small for its accommodation, and an addition, to cost $35,000, is about 
to be erected for the use of the school. 
‘Young men graduating from the school seldom have difficulty in obtain- 
ing employment— most of them engaging in mechanical pursuits. One ap- 
parent good effect of this school is, that boys who were indifferent and 
neglected their literary work soon became interested in the shop-work, and 
afterwards made more satisfactory progress in their literary studies. It is 
also noticeable that the boys trained by the methods used in this school do 
not need so much overlooking by their teachers—that they are more to be 
depended upon to go ahead in the successful accomplishment of their tasks 
in both kinds of work—that they become more reliable as well as more 
self-reliant and capable. Rosenkranz says that, “The end and aim of edu- 
cation is the emancipation of youth. It strives to make him self-dependent, 
and as soon as he has become so it wishes to retire and to be able to leave 
him to the sole responsibility of his actions.” Locke advises us when a boy 
is dull, that “to stir up vigor and activity in him, you must employ him in 
_ some constant bodily labor, whereby he may get a habit of doing something.” 
After this habit of doing something has in this way been acquired, it may 
be utilized in intellectual as well as manual labor. There seems to be strong 
evidence of the fact that, if manual work of the right kind, under proper 
conditions, could be engaged in by pupils in connection with literary work, 
better results would ensue than if the curriculum were limited to the 
same amount of literary work alone. Although this may seem paradoxical, 
yet it may be accounted for on psychological principles, for the pleasure and 
interest occasioned by the manual work greatly increases the attention, and 
consequently the impressions are much more firmly fixed in the mind. When 
the two courses are so codrdinated and arranged that the one supplements 
and illustrates the other, as should be the case as far as possible, the object- 
ive character of the teaching prevents the pupils from learning words alone, 
but words and their corresponding ideas are learned at the same time, and 
greater progress secured.
-P-A-G-E-107
  MANUAL TRAINING. 107 
The Manual Training High School which I have briefly described pro- 
vides manual training for pupils fourteen years of age who have completed 
the studies of the grammar schools. And now I come to the subject of my 
paper—‘“ How shall manual training be introduced into the grades of the 
primary and grammar schools?” In some of the large cities of the country 
an effort has been made to solve this question, so far as the grammar schools 
are concerned, by sending a certain number of pupils, for about two hours 
a week, to shops equipped for the purpose, where, in charge of a carpenter, 
they receive instruction in shop-work. Under these circumstances the work 
in the shop, directed by an instructor who knows little about and has no 
sympathy with the literary course, must be done with little, if any, refer- 
ence to its being supplemental to the literary course pursued in the gram- 
mar school. 
This plan, of course, cannot be successful, and seems to be a mere expedi- 
ent. to quiet the demand for manual training in the grammar schools. One 
of the strongest arguments in favor of manual training is, that the study 
of words and the ideas they represent is carried on together, the manual 
work being made, as far as it can be made, the objective teaching of the 
literary work; and the plan pursued in these cities, failing to arrange the 
two kinds of work in accordance with this idea, is not a good one, and in 
time must be abolished, as it fails to secure the advantage of the most bene- 
ficial feature urged in favor of blending manual with literary work. 
In connection with the Manual Training School there has been organized 
a preparatory department, to which pupils from the sixth and seventh grades 
of the grammar schools are admitted. This department of the school at 
this time numbers 165 pupils. 
The graded course of study arranged for two years embraces: language, 
reading, writing, arithmetic, algebra, geometry, geography, history, drawing 
(45 minutes daily), wood-work (75 minutes a day for twenty weeks), and 
sheet-metal work (75 minutes a day for twenty weeks). This department, 
it is intended, shall be allowed to increase in proportion to the demand. It 
does not interfere with the grammar schools proper as they are at present 
organized, and it may be abolished or extended, if found necessary, without 
embarrassment to the system. 
It is generally admitted that the introduction of sewing into grammar 
schools in which girls are taught, is both feasible and desirable, and that its 
instruction does not decrease the thoroughness of the other work done in 
the schools; but great difference of opinion exists as to the extent to which 
manual training should be introduced into the grades of the primary and 
grammar schools. It is urged by some that its introduction would cause 
the literary course to be slighted. Experience has shown this to be a mis- 
take. Wherever manual has been judiciously connected with literary work, 
the literary standard of the school has not been lowered. Mr. Philbrick 
says in one of his reports: “The remarkable success which has attended the
-P-A-G-E-108
108 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
experiment of extending instruction in sewing to all the classes of the Win- 
throp school, furnishes an illustration of the principle long known among 
educators, that a change from mental to manual exercises within limits is 
favorable to the best intellectual attainments —for the children of the Win- 
throp school have surpassed their former standing in scholarship, while they 
have gained in addition a most beautiful accomplishment.” 
It is found to be the case that pupils engaged in such exercises become 
more interested in school, they attend better, and look upon their exercises 
more as realities than is the case in other schools. 
When any kind of manual work can be done in a school so as to supple- 
ment and aid the acquirement of the literary work, its introduction is highly 
desirable. For this reason we may introduce into the primary grades the 
construction of forms in clay, pasteboard, or other suitable material, for use 
as models in drawing, and teach the pupils how to represent these forms by 
drawings. The forms should be handled and studied by the pupils, that 
they may learn their names and the names of their parts. In the grammar 
grades we imay introduce a continuation of the work begun in the primary 
grades, of constructing forms, and teaching the pupils how to represent them 
by drawings. 
It is said “That when the art of drawing shall be permanently established 
in all the public schools the cause of industrial education will be nearly 
accomplished, and its place marked in the new order of studies.” Grammar- 
school pupils may also be taught to make in sand, clay, or other material, 
contour maps showing the physical features of the countries studied by the 
grade. They should also be required to construct the simple apparatus used 
in the study of physics. Scientific investigations have established the fact 
that manual work gives development to portions of the brain in a manner 
that literary work alone fails to secure. 
For the purpose of inculcating the scientific method of investigation, as 
well as to train the hand and eye in connection with the brain, all students 
of the-Johns Hopkins University, offering for the A. B. degree, are required 
to study drawing, and to pursue one branch of science taught by the labo- 
ratory method. 
There should be introduced, also, in the grades of the primary and grammar 
schools elementary science lessons, by which pupils are taught by competent 
teachers to observe accurately; to express clearly, concisely and grammati- 
cally, either orally or in writing, what they observe; to make drawings of 
the specimens studied or the apparatus used; to find and read what writers 
have said about the subject they are investigating; to acquire a simple 
logical method of grouping their observations, and the power of generaliza- 
tion from specific facts. Each lesson in such a course should be related to 
the lessons which precede and follow it, as they are of little value when given 
at random without reference to each other. One lesson must not be allowed 
to exist as an isolated thing, but must form an important part of a complete 
   
-P-A-G-E-109
  MANUAL TRAINING. : 109 
course. In connection with the study of form, pupils should also be prac- 
ticed in making measurements, and in the computation of areas and volumes. 
Such work greatly aids the pupils in acquiring an intelligent knowledge of 
arithmetic, and when it has preceded the study of geometry it is wonderful- 
to note how readily and successfully pupils of the advanced grades engage 
in the study of that subject. 
In order to establish this work successfully in the schools, it is necessary 
to provide better programs and more highly trained teachers. Frequent 
complaint is made of over-pressure in the schools, but the trouble is due not 
so much to over-work, as to the lack of interest on the part of pupils, and 
' the want of conscious progress. President Eliot, of Harvard University, 
has called attention to these facts and has well said in connection with the 
programs in use, that it is an abominable waste of time and effort to put 
children to doing in a difficult way that which in a year or two they will be 
able to learn to do much more easily. 
The agitation of this question has been productive of good. Heretofore 
we have been wasting much valuable time and effort in doing work, in many 
instances, without any appreciable return in power gained; especially is 
this the case in regard to arithmetic, geography, and grammar. Much un- 
necessary work has been eliminated from the programs, and that remaining 
is taught more successfully by means of better methods. 
Our schools are daily becoming more efficient in getting pupils to be able 
to do something, and I think we may indulge in the hope that vast improve- 
ment of the schools will be made in the near future. To accomplish this, 
though, teachers must be improved—they must have more knowledge of 
the subjects to be taught, and possess more aptitude and skill in teaching. 
Those who are intrusted with the duty of training teachers must learn 
that it is necessary for teachers to know more than they are required to 
teach; that the explanation of simple things often lies hidden in things that 
are profound; and that scholarship, which many of them deride, is an in- 
dispensable requisite to success in teaching. Our programs should be so 
arranged and the teachers so trained that no effort would be wasted in in- 
struction, and that all our aims and efforts would converge toward the one 
common purpose of giving our pupils a symmetrical development which 
will fit them in the best possible manner to be industrious, successful and 
virtuous citizens. “Hasten slowly” is a sound maxim as well in the school- 
room as elsewhere, and it is necessary to test thoroughly the usefulness of 
manual work to be engrafted on the primary and grammar schools before 
rashly interfering with the programs of these schools. By the aid of the 
work we are successfully accomplishing in our Manual Training School, and 
by that of the Industrial Educational Association recently established in 
Baltimore, of which many of our public-school teachers are members, we 
shall arrive at a better knowledge of this subject in all its varied bearings; 
but with our limited knowledge of the kind of work to be introduced, the

method of introducing it and the inability to obtain well-instructed teach- 
ers, after doing what has been mentioned as possible at this time, we can 
only wait and study the subject, and modify our present course as our in- 
creased knowledge justifies us.

  DENOMINATIONAL SCHOOLS. 111 
  
THEME: DENOMINATIONAL SCHOOLS, 
SHOULD AMERICANS EDUCATE THEIR CHILDREN IN 
DENOMINATIONAL SCHOOLS? 
CARDINAL GIBBONS, BALTIMORE, MARYLAND. 
I am persuaded that the popular errors now existing in reference to edu- 
cation spring from an incorrect notion of that term. To educate means to 
bring out, to develop the intellectual, moral and religious faculties of the 
soul. An education, therefore, that improves the mind and the memory, to 
the neglect of moral and religious training, is, at best, but an imperfect and 
defective system. According to Webster’s definition, to educate is “ to instill 
into the mind principles of art, science, morals, religion, and behavior.” 
“To educate,” he says, “in the arts, is important; in religion, indispensable.” 
It is, indeed, eminently useful that the intellect of our youth should be 
developed, and that they should be made familiar with those branches of 
knowledge which they are afterward likely to pursue. They can then go 
forth into the world gifted with a well-furnished mind, and armed with a 
lever by which they may elevate themselves in the social scale, and become 
valuable members of society. It is most desirable, also, that they should, 
in the course of their studies, be made acquainted with the history of our 
country, with the origin and principles of its government, and with the 
eminent men who have served it by their statesmanship and defended it by 
their valor. This knowledge will instruct them in their civic rights and 
duties, and contribute to make them enlightened citizens and devoted patriots. 
But it is not enough for children to have a secular education; they must 
receive a religious training. Indeed, religious knowledge is as far above 
human science as the soul is above the body, as heaven is above earth, as 
eternity is above time. The little child that is familiar with the Christian 
catechism is really more enlightened on truths that should come home to 
every rational mind than the most profound philosophers of pagan antiquity, 
or even than many of the so-called philosophers of our own times. He has 
mastered the great problem of life. He knows his origin, his sublime des- 
tiny, and the means of attaining it—a knowledge that no human science 
can impart without the light of Revelation. 
God has given us a heart to be formed to virtue, as well as a head to be 
enlightened. By secular education, we improve the mind; by moral train- 
ing, we direct the heart. 
 
-P-A-G-E-112
  112 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
It is not sufficient, therefore, to know how to read and write, to under- 
stand the rudiments of grammar and arithmetic. It does not suffice to know 
that two and two make four; we must practically learn, also, the great dis- 
tance between time and eternity. The knowledge of book-keeping is not 
sufficient unless we are taught, also, how to balance our accounts daily be- 
tween our conscience and our God. It will profit us little to understand all 
about the diurnal and annual motions of the earth, unless we add to this 
science some heavenly astronomy. We should know and feel that our future 
home is to be beyond the stars in heaven, and that, if we lead a virtuous life 
here, we shall “shine as stars for all eternity.” 
‘We want our children to receive an education that will make them not 
only learned, but pious men. We want them to be not only polished mem- 
bers of society, but also conscientious Christians. We desire for them a 
training that will form their heart, as well as expand their mind. We wish 
them to be not only men of the world, but, above all, men of God. 
A knowledge of history is most useful and important for the student. 
He should be acquainted with the lives of those illustrious heroes that 
founded empires, of those men of genius that enlightened the world by 
their wisdom and learning, and embellished it by their works of art. 
But is it not more important to learn something of the King of kings, 
who created all those kingdoms, and by whom kings reign? Is it not more 
important to study the Uncreated Wisdom before whom all earthly wisdom 
is folly, and to admire the works of the Divine Artist who paints the lily 
and gilds the clouds? 
If, indeed, our soul were to die with the body, if we had no existence 
beyond the grave, if we had no account to render to God for our actions, 
we might more easily dispense with religion in our schools; though even 
then Christian morality would be a true source of temporal blessings, for, 
as the apostle teaches, “ Piety is profitable to all things, having promise of 
the life that now is, and of that which is to come.” 
But our youth cherish the hope of one day becoming citizens of heaven, 
as well as of this land; and as they cannot be good citizens of this country 
without studying and observing its laws, neither can they become citizens 
of heaven unless they know and practice the laws of God. Now it is only 
by a good religious education that we learn to know and to fulfill our duties 
toward our Creator. p 
The religious and the secular education of our children cannot be divorced 
from each other without inflicting a fatal wound upon the soul. The usual 
consequence of such a separation is to paralyze the moral faculties and to 
foment a spirit of indifference in matters of faith. Education is to the soul 
what food is to the body. The milk with which the infant is nourished at 
its mother’s breast feeds not only its head, but permeates at the same time 
its heart and the other organs of the body. In like manner, the intellectual 
and moral growth of our children must go hand-in-hand; otherwise their
-P-A-G-E-113
  DENOMINATIONAL SCHOOLS. 113 
  
education is shallow and fragmentary, and often proves a curse instead of a 
blessing. 
Piety is not to be put on as a holiday dress, to be worn on state occasions, 
but it is to be exhibited in our conduct at all times. Our youth must put 
in practice every day the commandments of God as well as the rules of 
grammar and arithmetic. How can they familiarize themselves with these _ 
sacred duties if they are not daily inculeated ? 
Guizot, an eminent Protestant writer of France, expresses himself so 
clearly and forcibly on this point that I cannot forbear quoting his words: 
“Tn order,” he says, “to make popular education truly good and socially 
useful, it must be fundamentally religious. . . . It is necessary that 
national education should be given and received in the midst of a religious 
atmosphere, and that religious impressions and religious observances should 
penetrate into all its parts. Religion is not a study or an exercise to be re- 
stricted to a certain place or a certain hour. It is a faith and a law, which 
ought to be felt everywhere, and which, after this manner alone, can exer- 
cise all its beneficial influence upon our mind and our life.” 
In this country, the citizen happily enjoys the largest liberty, and I should 
be sorry to see his freedom lessened or infringed. But the wider the liberty 
the more efficient should be the safeguards to prevent it from being abused 
and degenerating into license. To keep the social body within its orbit, 
the centripetal force of religion should counterbalance the centrifugal 
motion of free thought. The ship that is to sail on a rough sea and before 
strong winds, should be well ballasted. The only efficient way to preserve 
the blessings of civil freedom within legitimate bounds, is to inculcate on 
the mind of youth whilst at school the virtues of truth, justice, honesty, 
temperance, self-denial, and those other fundamental duties comprised in 
the Christian code of morals. 
The catechetical instructions given once a week in our Sunday schools, 
though productive of very beneficial results, are insufficient to supply the 
religious wants of our children. They should as far as possible breathe 
every day a healthy religious atmosphere in those schools in which not only 
is their mind enlightened, but the seeds of faith, piety and sound morality 
are nourished and invigorated. This would be effected if the denomina- 
tional system, such as obtains in Canada, were applied in our public schools. 
The combination of religious and secular education is easily accomplished 
in denominational schools. To what extent religion may be taught in the 
public schools without infringing the rights and wounding the conscience 
of some of the pupils is a grave problem beset with difficulties, and very 
hard to be solved, inasmuch as those schools are usually attended by chil- 
dren belonging to the various Christian denominations, by Jews also, and 
even by those who profess no religion whatever.

THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
SHOULD AMERICANS EDUCATE THEIR CHILDREN IN 
DENOMINATIONAL SCHOOLS? 
RIGHT REY. JOHN J. KEANE, WASHINGTON, D. C. 
  In accepting the courteous invitation of the President of the National 
Educational Association to treat before it the question of denominational 
schools, my motive has been the firm conviction that a candid statement of 
facts, and an honest weighing of arguments, must naturally redound to the 
advantage of the truth, and tend to the promotion of the kindly feelings 
which ought to exist among fellow-citizens. 
At the outset it is obvious that the question may be considered as limited 
to schools which profess to be distinctively Christian schools. While the 
term “denominational” might indeed be applied to other forms of religion, 
yet it is so commonly employed to designate the various professions of the 
Christian religion only, and this is so evidently the idea here principally 
had in view, that I trust I may with propriety limit these considerations to 
Christian schools. This generic name, Christian schools, would be clear 
enough if all Christians were united. But since Christians are divided by 
their various understandings of Christianity into different denominations, 
the term “denominational schools” conveys the idea more explicitly. 
This limitation as to the class of schools intended, implies a correspond- 
ing limitation as to the class of parents regarded by the question. It obvi- 
ously applies only to Christians of the several denominations. And in 
asking whether they should educate their children in denominational schools, 
it regards them not only as Christians, but also as Americans. Under these 
two aspects, therefore, we will seek the correct answer. And we will seek 
it by the light of facts, the light which beams from the very nature of 
things. ‘ 
In the hard and unequal struggle of human existence, every budding life 
stands sorely in need of wise unfolding, of judicious direction. In the life 
‘of nearly every child there are wrapped up endless capabilities of both good 
and evil, for himself and for others. In which of these two directions the 
life is to be developed,—which of these two sets of capabilities is to rule it, 
—which of these two sets of results it is to produce: here is the great prob- 
lem facing each human being at the threshold of existence. And its solu- 
tion for each child must, above all, depend on its parents, or on those who 
hold towards it the place of parents. Human society is indeed provided 
with many wise helps and encouragements for the good capabilities and 
tendencies, with many restraints for the evil; but upon parents it must es- 
pecially depend to what influences the child shall be subjected, and how he 
shall be fitted to receive their action. The office of parents lies at the very 
root of character, at the very basis of civilization. This is the dictate and
-P-A-G-E-115
  DENOMINATIONAL SCHOOLS. 115 
plan of nature itself, the universal law which, in the harmonious arrange- 
ments of Divine Providence, reaches from end to end of the visible creation, 
through all the economy of life. 
And this is especially true in the plan of Christian civilization. The sys- 
tems of civilization which existed before the time of Christ, counted the in- 
dividual life as of little moment, save as it was a cog in the machinery of 
the body politic. The grandeur and domination of the state was the ruling 
consideration. The individual and the family were of importance in pro- 
portion as they were factors towards that result. Christianity reversed this, 
and gave a new direction to social ideas and civil polity. Its initial idea is 
the worth, the dignity, the welfare and destiny of the individual. It is no 
longer he that belongs to the state, but state and church belong to him— 
exist only for his good. 
“All things are yours,” writes St. Paul to the Christians of his day; “all 
things are yours, whether it be Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or 
life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours, and you 
are Christ’s, and Christ is God’s.” And that self-same glorious declaration 
Christianity shall proclaim to the children of men, forever. No amount 
of state grandeur, or of state domination, can henceforth be considered 
praiseworthy, which costs the welfare of the individual citizens. They in- 
deed must be ever ready to sacrifice their means, and even their life, for 
their country; but this is no longer loyalty towards a domination to which 
all belong, but loyalty towards a common weal by which all are benefited, 
towards a community of homes by which all are blessed. The glory of a 
Christian nation is not in its ability to surpass all around it in martial 
prowess and in the returns of trade, but in the intelligence, the morality, 
the comfort, and contentment of its people. These are its true honor; nay, 
these are also its impregnable rampart, for that nation must be invincible 
which is strong in the grateful devotedness of a happy, prosperous, and vir- 
tuous people. This is the idea of Christendom. This is the reign of the 
Prince of Peace. Hence the true notion of a Christian community consists 
in these two elements: First, individual lives aiming at their best develop- 
ment and best welfare here below, and at their eternal destiny hereafter; 
and then, every form of social organization, from the family up to the 
church and the state, helping them toward the realization of one or other 
or both of these aims. 
But before the individual can know and will these aims for himself, his 
parents must will them for him, and shape the moulding and direction of 
his character and life towards them. It is the constant care of a good 
parent that his child’s intellect should be stored with sound knowledge, en- 
lightened with correct ideas, formed to clear and true and firm convictions; 
and that, at the same time, his morals should be resolutely turned away 
from the vicious tendencies which would debase his character, offend his 
Creator, and injure his fellow-beings, and be as resolutely turned in the way
-P-A-G-E-116
  116 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  
of the upright and virtuous qualities which will ennoble his nature, make 
him a credit to his family and a benefit to the community, and bring him 
safely at last to his destiny in the bosom of his Creator. 
Well he knows that this life-moulding of his child is no easy task; that 
all the time of childhood and youth will not be too long for its thorough 
and lasting accomplishment; that a judicious employment of all the influ- 
ences which surround the young life and tell on the young mind and heart, 
will be none too much to secure it. It must be the aim of home, of com- 
panionships, of books, of church, of school. In all these agencies there is 
one influence which he considers indispensable, which he wishes to be the 
habitual element of his child’s life, since on it, above all things else, must 
the moulding of the child’s character, the securing of his temporal and 
eternal welfare, depend—and that is the influence of Christianity, the guid- 
ing and helpful action of the Christian religion. He knows from history 
and experience that without the light of Christianity the human intellect 
is in darkness as to the all-important questions which well up from the 
depths of the human soul, as to the all-embracing vital problems which 
.ever force themselves on the attention of mankind. He knows, too, that 
without the restraining, chastening, and elevating influences of Christian- 
ity, human morals never have been, and never can reasonably be expected 
to be, honorable to human nature, and conducive to either private or public 
welfare. He is deeply convinced that its principles and its helps can alone 
make the relations of man with man, and of man with God, what they 
ought to be. He is sure that without its intimate and abiding and all- 
pervading influence, human life must wither and civilization rot. There- 
fore is he above all things desirous that the mind and heart and life of his 
child should be gently, sweetly, steadily, all the time penetrated and shaped 
by the action of Christianity; that it should grow in him with his growth, 
and be the life of his life; that so his life may approach the nearer to that 
great Model Life, which beyond all others honors God and humanity, and 
which says to every Christian life, “Follow me.” 
But now, like a sensible man, he fully understands the important part in 
the shaping of his child’s mind and character which the school is to have— 
the school, in which is spent so large a portion of the moulding-time of child- 
hood and youth; the school, which, among all the influences that tell on 
life, is, or ought to be, so specially efficacious. What, then, could be more 
natural than that he should wish for his child a school in which, besides all 
other educational excellences, the light, the tone, the spirit of Christianity 
should sweetly influence and mold the child all the time? 
If there were any necessary incompatibility between secular instruction 
and Christian training in a school—if one of these advantages had to be 
secured at the cost of some sacrifice of the other —his principles as a Chris- 
tian would be apt to make him decide that the sacrifice should be of the 
material and worldly rather than of the spiritual and eternal. But he

  knows full well that there is no such necessary incompatibility, since God 
is the author both of the material and the spiritual, both of the temporal 
and the eternal, and that, as the apostle writes, “Piety is profitable unto all 
things, having the promise both of the life that is and of that which is to 
to come.” A school is not made a Christian’ school by taking up a great 
deal of time in doctrinal instruction or in devotional exercises which would 
otherwise be spent in acquiring secular knowledge. Some time, indeed, 
must be given to these, and it ought to be, and can be, made the most in- 
structive and beneficial part of the school hours; but that time need not be, 
and should not be, so long as to be wearisome to the pupils or damaging to 
other studies. What above all make it a Christian school are the moral 
atmosphere, the general tone, the surrounding objects, the character of the 
teachers, the constant endeavor, the loving tact, the gentle skill, by which 
the light and the spirit of Christianity —its lessons for the head, for the 
heart, for the whole character—are made to’ pervade and animate the whole 
school-life of the child; just as the good parent desires that they should 
animate his whole future life in all his manifold duties and relations as man 
and as citizen. This is the kind of a school which a parent anxious as in 
duty bound to give his child as thorough Christian training as possible will 
naturally choose. 
But will he judge differently because, being a Christian, he is also an 
American? Let him suppose so who imagines that between being a good 
Christian and a good American there is any incompatibility. But such, 
assuredly, is not my conviction, nor that of any member of this Association, 
nor that of any one who has an intelligent understanding of what is meant 
by the terms Christian and American. On the contrary, the ideas which, 
as said this moment, were given to the world and to civilization by Chris- 
tianity, are the very idgas on which has been reared the edifice of American 
liberties. Our social structure rests on the declaration of man’s natural 
worth; of the inalienable rights bestowed on every individual by his Cre- 
ator; of the great principle that the government is for the governed, not 
the governed for the government. The intelligent Christian parent knows 
well that what ought to be true of every nationality within the pale of 
Christian civilization is preéminently true of ours—that the best Christian 
is sure to be the best American, and that the school which aims at sending 
forth his child a model Christian, in equal degree tends to send him forth a 
model American; and he knows, besides, that if under every form of gov- 
ernment a man needs to be a good Christian in order to be fully trustworthy 
and self-sacrificing and faithful as a citizen, much more is that true in our 
blessed land of popular institutions, where the virtues or the vices of each 
individual must tell more than elsewhere on the healthfulness or the un- 
soundness of the whole system. Hence, his convictions of duty toward his 
child as a Christian parent are intensified by his principles as an American. 
The schools of America ought to be the most truly Christian schools in the

  world. Our civilization is essentially a Christian civilization. Our country 
indeed should tyrannize over no one’s conscience, but she herself ought to 
be consistently, fearlessly, always Christian. Should she ever ignore this 
fact; should she ever, yielding to clamor from any quarter, turn her back 
on the Prince of Peace and declare herself indifferent or neutral as to 
Christ and Christianity, then will she have cut from beneath her feet the 
groundwork of her prosperity and her glory, and surrendered the guaranty 
of her liberties—which may God forefend! But Christian civilization has 
for its natural foundation Christian homes and Christian schools. Again, 
therefore, a good Christian-American parent, if he is true to his principles, 
will be sure to choose for his child a good Christian-American school. 
Doubtless he will find many to differ with him, and to urge objections. 
It will be said to him: “Can you not trust religious training to the church 
and home, and let the school have for its function the imparting of secular 
knowledge?” Consistently with his view of human life, and of the training 
needed by a child’s character, he must say: ‘No; while home and church 
are potent agents in the formation of character, the school counts for very 
much in the work. Why, then, should I not wish to have the influences of 
the school thoroughly Christian, as well as those of church and home? The 
school fills so large a part in the serious hours of a child’s life, that it would 
be fatal to omit from it the all-essential element in character-moulding. 
There is not such a superabundance of Christianity in the lives of men to- 
day that we can afford to omit it from school-training, on which the shaping 
of life so largely depends. No,” says the Christian parent, “Christian com- 
mon sense warns me to give my child Christian schooling.” 
“But,” retorts his friend, “had we not better, according to this logic, have 
Christian banks and Christian shoe stores, too?” “Surely,” he answers, 
“you must be jesting; a bank or a shoe store is not intended for forming the 
character of youth, while a school is. Pardon me, if I call it silly to insti- 
tute a parity between them. Please let us have an argument with some 
. seriousness in it.” 
“Well, then,” it will be urged, “does not experience show, as in France 
and Germany, that the mixing of religious instruction, with secular learning 
in the schools acts to the detriment of Christian belief?” “Not at all,” he 
will reply; “this could not be said by one who has seriously examined the 
facts. The decline of religious belief in France and Germany.is not owing 
to the presence of religious instruction in the schools, but to its absence from 
the high schools and universities, where religion is pushed aside into some 
obscure corner and is openly or covertly scoffed at by the bulk of the pro- 
fessors. ‘No wonder,’ boastfully exclaimed a radical leader in the German 
Parliament not long since, ‘no wonder, when the leaders of public thought 
are thus formed by the state itself, that the thought of the nation should 
follow in their wake.’ No; let the light of Christianity be the radiance of 
the school-room, that the feet of the children may learn to walk always by
-P-A-G-E-119
DENOMINATIONAL SCHOOLS. 119 
  its guidance; and let it not less but all the more be the radiance of the in- 
stitutions of highest learning, that brilliant and influential minds may not, 
from materialistic one-sidedness in their studies, topple over into an abyss 
of darkness, and drag the minds of the many with them.” 
“But,” it is objected, “does not your theory turn over education to the con- 
trol of the church?” “Truly,” he replies, “if your understanding of Chris- 
tianity convinces you, as in fact it convinces the bulk of Christians, that 
the Christian religion and the Christian church are made inseparable by 
the Divine Founder of Christianity, that his ‘fulness of grace and of truth’ 
is forever to be dispensed to the world through the agencies of His church, 
then indeed your conclusion that the Christian church should be a recognized 
spiritual influence in the school, is a logical one. And, in fact, you must 
know that such has been the conclusion of the Christian world in all ages 
—that the contrary notion is quite a recent invention, which has by no 
means proved its right to supersede the old Christian idea, and which, in the 
nature of things, never can prove it. And,” he would add, “if in the spirit- 
ual atmosphere of my home and of my own life I love to feel the influence of 
my church, why should I not equally love to have it felt throughout all the 
school-life, throughout all the character-moulding, of my child?” 
“But,” it is urged, “is not this encouraging sectarianism, to which the 
spirit of our age and of our country is so opposed?” “No one,” must a sin- 
cere Christian reply, “can regret more than I the divisions existing among 
Christians. But we have to accept the fact, and do the best we can with it. 
When I go to the church of my belief on Sunday, rather than to the church 
of some other denomination, I am following my conscience and doing no 
harm to anyone else. And surely the same may be said of the school to 
which I send my child.” 
“But,” it is still objected, “will not the child’s education be thus made 
narrow and one-sided, and without freedom of thought, whereas a broader 
view and a broader system would give greater largeness to his mind’s de- 
velopment?” “Really,” must a Christian parent of good sense reply, “this 
is most singular logic. Am I then to conclude that clearness and definite- 
ness narrow the mind, and that vagueness and indefiniteness broaden it? _ 
Or am I to forget that there is a broadness which leaves the mind a wide 
trackless moor, over which life’s journey can be made with but little secur- 
ity? Horace was right when he said: 
‘Sunt certi denique fines, 
Quos ultra citraque nequit consistere rectum.’ 
‘For certain metes and bounds there are in things, 
Which marks the limits of the true and right.’ 
These plausible generalities about largeness and broadness are lurking- 
holes of fallacy, and I want none of them. Truth cannot be too clear and 
explicit for me. There was nothing vague and indefinite about Christ, and 
there is nothing vague and indefinite about Christianity. And as to free-   
 
-P-A-G-E-120
120 
  
  dom of thought, surely true freedom of thought, like the freedom of the 
American people, is not license, but supposes law and order. There can no 
more be a liberty —that is, a right—to think as you please, than a right to 
do as you please. No one can claim the right to do wrong, and no one can 
claim the right to think wrong. This is by no means to appeal to coercion, 
but to avow the need of a guide in thought as well as in action; and I re- 
joice to find that guide in ‘the fulness of truth’ given by Him who truly 
calls Himself the Light of the World.” 
“But,” persists his adversary, “could you not be content with that incul- 
cation of Christian morality which exists in our public schools, or which, at 
least, it is proposed to introduce into them?” “My answer,” he replies, 
“is furnished by an abundance of competent and unexceptionable witnesses. 
‘You must know how, again and again and almost continuously for the last 
twenty years, thinkers of every religion and of no religion have lamented 
that the inculeation of morality and religion in the public schools was not 
what it ought to be. The discussion now widely prevailing about the pos- 
sibility and means of needed moral and religious training in them, is suffi- 
cient acknowledgment of the lack hitherto existing. You must then excuse 
me,” a Christian parent will logically say, “from considering their training 
just what I want for my child, till the methods now urged shall have been 
tried and proved efficacious. And,” he would add, “that the result ever 
can be satisfactory, I am not prepared to believe. The whole of Christianity 
is needed as the basis, the mould, the restraint, the incentive of a Christian 
life. There is nothing in it superfluous, nothing that is not eminently prac- 
tical in its bearings ; and no minimized, compromise Christianity can ever 
suffice in its stead. Such moral teaching as you might get from Cicero and 
Seneca can never suffice for the moral teaching of Christ, and for the mo- 
tives, means, and sanctions of morality which he bestows. All this vague, 
indefinite, nen-committal moralizing and religiousness, is simply religious 
moonshine, which might be useful if we were in the darkness of religious 
night, but which it is absurd to wish to substitute for the Light of the 
World. No, I want his radiance clear and full in the school-room where 
my child spends his days.” 
“But,” it is still argued, “do you not see that a denominational system of 
schools could never suit America, where a heterogeneous population needs a 
unifying, and not a dividing system of education, and where it is all-important 
that a right understanding of our republican institutions and hearty devot- 
edness to them should be inculcated?” “And do you really believe,” our 
good Christian parent will answer, “that, because I go on Sunday to a dif- 
ferent church from my neighbor, he and I will therefore meet less trustingly 
and cordially on Monday in the ways of trade and of social relations? 
Surely not, if in his church and mime the spirit of Christianity is inculcated, 
which is that of universal charity and justice. Suspicions, antagonisms, an- 
imosities, ought never to be instilled in any Christian church; and if they
-P-A-G-E-121
  ‘DENOMINATIONAL SCHOOLS. 121 
are, that church has not the spirit of Christ in it, and ought to be deserted. 
And, once more, what I say of the church I say of the school. Every 
Christian school should teach justice and charity towards every fellow-citi- 
zen, and you may be sure that I will choose no school for my child where 
that spirit is not imparted. And as I, in all the walks of life, meet all de- 
cent members of the community with amity and public-spiritedness, so will 
my child, trained to the character of a true Christian, go forth into the walks 
of practical life, looking kindly on every decent associate, and eager to 
codperate with all for the public good. Beyond that, the homogeneousness 
of our people never can go, in the nature of things. We are not aiming at 
the communism of Sparta. Home will be distinct from home, and circle 
from circle in society, say what you will. It is nature, and you cannot 
eradicate it. But social distinctions are no reason for popular dissension ; 
and least of all should religious distinctions be such. Do you suppose that 
it was in any public undenominational schools that Washington and the 
founders of our liberties, our models of patriotism, were reared? You know 
it was not so. And do you suppose that there will be a Christian denomi- 
nation in all this land that will not vie with every other in inculcating de- 
votedness to our country, to her liberties, to her institutions? The supposi- 
tion is contrary to all existing facts and to all good sense,—so away with it.” 
“But,” urges his friend, “is not the Catholic Church, at least, committed 
to the Christianity of Hildebrand and of the Middle Ages, and is it not 
therefore antagonistic to the Christianity of the nineteenth century and of 
the American Republic?” In the name of the Catholic Church I answer, 
that she is committed neither to Hildebrand and the Middle Ages, nor to 
the policy of any man or of any age whatsoever, because she is for all men, 
and therefore for all ages and for all forms of social conditions. In the 
Middle Ages she blessed the social and religious conditions then existing — 
the only ones possible in that transition period of human society—and 
through the mouth of Hildebrand she protested against the feudal des- 
potism which would fain have turned the ministers of God into tools and 
minions of Cesar. Czsarism and feudalism are gone, thank God, or going 
fast, from the whole world. They have no place, surely, in our America, 
and the church has no desire for them, nor for the conditions and relations 
which they implied. Wherever in other lands those conditions partly lin- 
ger, she has to treat with them as best she can, ever saying to them, as she 
said to Henry IV, “Render to Cesar the things that are Cwsar’s, but to 
God the things that are God’s.” The same will be her lesson to every age; 
and every age will need it. But she could no more wish to put the nine- 
teenth century and our American Republic back into the swaddling-clothes 
of the thirteenth century and feudalism, than you could wish to take the 
full-grown man and condemn him to the frock and cradle of babyhood. 
She is as fit to deal with the mature manhood of humanity as with its child- 
hood; and she loves the manhood best, because its development is the plan

  of Providence, the will of God. It is the lively imagination of our kind 
objectors which would apply to the conditions existing in our country facts 
and utterances referring only to circumstances of ages and countries totally 
different. And you know that there have not been wanting hot-headed and 
mistaken men, animated, as the apostle says, with “zeal, but not according 
to knowledge,” who have fostered and disseminated these unjust impressions 
concerning the Catholic Church by publications teeming with perverted 
facts, garbled quotations, and absurd, oft-refuted inventions. But our con- 
fidence is in truth, in justice, and in the good sense of the American people, 
who, instead of heeding these dreamers, will look for themselves and hear 
for themselves, and discover, as they assuredly must, that in all our land 
there is no element more identified with America, more devoted to our 
country and her institutions, than the clergy and people of the Catholic 
Church; and, as our good Christian parent has just shown us, we are all 
this—not one whit the less, but all the more—because of our giving our 
children the blessing of a thoroughly Christian, as well as thoroughly 
American, education. 
I beg leave to conclude with words uttered by me last November in the 
Cathedral of New York: 
“Tn our blessed America, God has opened to the nations of the earth a 
new world, in which social readjustments should be wrought out without 
strife and confusion; in which the fullest freedom should be wedded to 
authority and peace; in which the rights of man should be inviolable under 
the wgis of the rights of God; in which the power of the masses should be 
exerted for the welfare of all. 3 
“But the fulfillment of that high destiny depends necessarily on the true 
enlightment of the masses. Here, more than anywhere else, the popular 
might, if misguided by influences of darkness, would plunge the nation into 
hopeless ruin. But here, too, more than elsewhere, the sovereignty of the 
people must conduce to general prosperity and happiness, if only the minds 
and hearts of the people are guided in ways of light by the Light of the 
world. A distinguished orator of our day has truly declared that the civil- 
ization and prosperity of our country depend on its Christianity, and that 
its Christianity depends on education. But, alas! how illogically he con- 
cluded from these premises that therefore the welfare of our country was 
to be safeguarded by a system of education in which it is not permissible to 
teach Christianity!’ Surely the logical conclusion from such evident prem- 
ises is, that the prosperity and civilization of our country depend on Chris- 
tian education. 
“Look now at the people of our country and we see them divided into 
two classes. On the one side, the Catholic church emphatically declares for 
Christian education; and with us side all those non-Catholics, whatever may 
be their denomination, who believe in Christian schools, and in them are 
giving their children an education, leavened and animated by Christianity
-P-A-G-E-123
  DENOMINATIONAL SCHOOLS. 123 
as they understand it. On the other side are the upholders and advocates 
of a national system of schools in which Christian truth and duty cannot be 
taught. Can anyone in his senses hesitate which of these two sides is for 
the real welfare of our country ? 
“We must cling to this sacred cause, and uphold it at any cost. We must 
carry aloft before the eyes of our country the banner of Christian education. 
We must multiply and perfect Christian schools, till all our children and 
all our youth can have in fullest abundance all the blessed intellectual and 
moral advantages which are the essential condition of Christian civilization. 
We must stop at no difficulties; we must count no cost. At any cost the 
work must and shall go on, for we are called to it both by a love of God 
and love of country. Our country may for a while misunderstand and mis- 
judge us; she may treat us unfairly; she may tax us doubly, may suspect 
our motives. But, like the Grecian hero of old, we will look her lovingly 
in the face and say: ‘Strike, but hear me!’ And we will persevere, until 
the good sense and the noble heart of the American people give the victory 
at last where it is rightly due, and all ranks of our fellow-citizens who be- 
lieve in Christian civilization will join with us in securing it by Christian 
education — will vie in guiding all the youth of the land in the gladsome 
ways of Him who alone is or can be the Light of the World.” 
HAS THE PAROCHIAL SCHOOL PROPER PLACE IN 
AMERICA? 
EDWIN’ D. MEAD, BOSTON, MASS. 
  
There was published in London in 1883—and subsequent editions have 
appeared, both in England and America—a work of 900 pages, entitled 
“A Catholic Dictionary: Containing some account of the Doctrine, Disci- 
pline, Rites, Ceremonies, Councils and Religious Orders of the Catholic 
Church,” by William E. Addis and Thomas Arnold, both fellows of the 
Royal University of Ireland. This Thomas Arnold is a son of the great 
master of Rugby. He was a distinguished scholar at Rugby and at Oxford, 
and is the author of various learned works on English literature, which are 
well known to teachers. He is the brother of Matthew Arnold, and the 
father of Mrs. Ward, the author of “Robert Elsmere.” He is therefore a 
Roman Catholic of sch antecedents, such training and such connections as- 
guarantee that this Catholic Dictionary or Encyclopedia, prepared with 
singular thoroughness and care, will state the doctrines and claims of the 
church in terminology less offensive than some Catholic terminology to the 
Protestant mind,-and in a-manner most likely to commend the Catholic po-

  sition to thoughtful and fair-minded Englishmen. The reliable and author- 
itative character of the book is vouched by the imprimatur of Cardinal 
Manning and the approbation of Cardinal Newman. In this Catholic Dic- 
tionary there is an article on Education, so fair, so firm, so thorough, so true 
to the indisputable position of the Catholic Church, that I shall ask you to 
keep a part of it in mind as a sort of compass, while we navigate together 
some rather troubled Catholic waters. 
“As man is a complex being,” says this article, “and has himself various 
ends—e. g., as a subject of God, as a subject of Czsar, as a member of a 
family, ete——so the education of man must propose to itself several ends. 
Of these, some one must be chief and paramount, and must direct the form 
and measure in which the other ends are to be pursued; otherwise the school 
would be the battle-ground of independent forces, each struggling for the 
mastery; and the result would be confusion. Now, since the object of edu- 
cation is to form man, the prime end, in subordination to which it must be 
conducted, must be identical with the prime end of man himself. What 
this is we learn from the catechism: it is to know and serve God in this life, 
and to enjoy him forever in the next. In subordination to this main end 
all educational processes are to be carried on. . . . How are human 
beings to obtain this necessary knowledge? The Catholic answer is that 
they must seek and receive it at the hands of the one divinely-appointed 
and infallible witness of the revelation by which God has made himself 
known to mankind—the Catholic and Roman Church. It thus appears 
that, in the logical order, the first and highest authority in all that regards 
education is the Church. With her sanction it should be commenced, and 
under her superintendence it should be continued; for were her interven- 
tion to be excluded at any stage, there would be danger lest those under 
education came to mistake one of the subordinate ends of man for his main 
end, to their own and others’ detriment.” 
From the church the writer turns to consider the claims and rights of the 
state in education. Man being by nature a social being, and society being 
impossible without government, then political power is aboriginal; is, as St. 
Paul says, “from God.” “Its main object,” says our writer, “is to secure 
the permanence and temporal welfare . . . of the society itself and of 
each member of the society. . . . It is therefore entitled to take all 
measures required to enable it to fulfill its functions. Now, one of the con- 
ditions without which these functions could not be effectively discharged is a 
control over education. The organized power in society—in other words, 
the state—may reasonably require that all its citizens should early receive 
that mental and moral training which may dispose them to restrain anti- 
social passions, to obey the laws, and by industry to promote their own and 
the public welfare. Whatever control over the machinery of education may 
be necessary to secure the attainment of this end, that control the state may 
reasonably pretend to. Its claims only become unjust and oppressive when,
-P-A-G-E-125
  DENOMINATIONAL SCHOOLS. 125 
ignoring the still more sacred right of the church to secure in education the 
attainment of man’s highest end, it compels or tempts Catholics to place 
their children in schools which the ecclesiastical authority has not sanctioned. 
The end pursued by the church is primary; that pursued by the state is 
secondary. Each may justly demand that its authority be recognized; but 
the injury caused by disallowing the authority of the church is more serious 
than in the contrary case, by how much that which affects man’s eternal 
interest is more important than that which affects his temporal interest 
only.” 
“A third authority in education is that of the family”—and the author 
briefly touches the obligations of parents to educate their children in the 
ways of decency, of dignity, and of thrift. ‘Catholic parents,” he adds, 
“are, of course, bound also to see that the teaching in the schools to which 
they send their children has ecclesiastical sanction, and to resist all attempts 
to make them patronize schools without that sanction.” 
“Tt thus appears,” he concludes, “that education has three principal 
ends— the first religious, the second political, the third domestic— but that 
among these the religious end takes the lead and dominates over the other 
two, on account of its intrinsically greater importance. And since, as ex- 
plained above, we cannot walk securely in religion one step except in union 
with and obedience to the church, every well-instructed Catholic understands 
that the church must preside over the education of Catholics at every stage 
and in every branch, so far as to see that they are sufficiently instructed in 
their religion.” 
I wish to say that I like this Catholic article on education, in this book 
which Cardinal Manning has stamped with his official approval. I do not 
believe that human beings have to seek and receive their moral and re- 
ligious education from the “Catholic and Roman Church.” I do not believe 
in any “one divinely-appointed and infallible witness” of God’s revelation 
to men. I do not believe that union with and obedience to any church is 
necessary to stepping securely in religion. I do not believe in any institu- 
tion more divine in its origin and authority, more moral in its true definition 
and office, than the state. I do not believe in any institutional authority 
superior in any respect to the authority of the state, and what the state 
creates and sanctions. But I do believe—and this is why I like this article, 
irrespective of its dialect and its particulars—that what concerns character 
is more important in this world than what concerns the prudences and the 
amenities, and that anything that claims to be education, in any large or 
worthy sense, must take.account of the moral and religious nature of man. 
That which affects man’s eternal interest, all will agree who believe in eternal 
interests at all, is certainly more important than that which affects his tem- 
poral interest only. Without stickling too closely here about nice defini- 
tions of religion and of politics, let us consent —I at least am quick to do 
it—that “education has three principal ends, the first religious, the second
-P-A-G-E-126
  126 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
political, the third domestic, and that among these the religious end takes 
the lead.” All certainly will agree in this, that what concerns character, 
what concerns pure and noble living, is the principal thing. And, without 
here discussing how expressly the state ought to educate its children in what 
pertains particularly to the religious or domestic life,— without discussing, I 
say, to what extent the state ought to do or may properly do this, so much 
we may say: that if the state sustains and sanctions a system of education 
which, by its constitution and essential character, works detriment to the 
religious life or to the family life, then those who have at heart the interests 
of religion and the family may properly complain and demand reform. If 
such a situation exists, or if we think we see it, then it is our duty, no less as 
citizens than as lovers of our homes and as men who fear God, to declare 
that the state itself is not secure, that it is not true to its own true definition, 
while doing injury or injustice to any valid institution, or any necessary, 
useful factor in the general life. Injustice in the state, let it be well taken 
to heart, is not what any sour or selfish party chooses to call injustice. The 
state is not concerned with the particular interests of any sect or any man. 
Like Gallio at Corinth, the state “cares for none of these things.” The 
complainant against the state cannot undertake to figure as judge in its own 
business. The appeal is to the state itself, to public opinion, to the powers 
that be,—in the republic to the majority. If the majority is wrong, then 
the complainant must wait. until it is right—else anarchy. If the cause is 
honest and good, the complainant can afford to wait. For there is one bar 
to which even the state must come—the future. To-morrow, if there is 
real injustice, even the state must yield —that is the way the world is made. 
Only in justice, only in proportion and in harmony, does a true politics itself 
consist; only in these can any given state endure. 
I like this Catholic article on education for recognizing this many-sided- 
ness of man and this necessity of harmony between the three great realms 
with which education chiefly has to do. I like it for its clear recognition of 
the fact that the authority of the state in education is superior to that of 
the family, and for the common sense with which it shows why this must 
' beso. I have said that I like it for declaring that the prime end of educa- 
tion must be identical with the prime end of man himself. I also like the 
boldness and the honesty with which it declares that “the first and highest 
authority in all that regards education is the church,” “the Catholic and 
Roman Church.” ‘The conflict which is involved in certain phases of the 
parochial school question here in America and elsewhere is a conflict be- 
tween the state and the church. I like the boldness and the honesty with 
which our book, with Cardinal Manning’s imprimatur, recognizes that this 
is likely to be the character of our modern conflicts concerning the schools, 
and with which it asserts the superior authority of the church in all that 
regards education, both as against the state and against the family. I do 
not like the attempt of Cardinal Manning, writing over his own name, in a
-P-A-G-E-127
  DENOMINATIONAL SCHOOLS. 127 
  
recent number of one of our American magazines, to represent the conflict 
as one between the state and the family. This is not bold and it is not 
honest; it is sly, sophistical and ad captandum; and, like almost all the 
attempts of a mere craftiness, it overleaps itself and lands the author amidst 
generalities from which he would be the quickest to steal under the suffi- 
ciently tight pressure of an exigency, not necessarily a very great exigency. 
‘Whatever be the necessary or proper adjustment of authority between the 
state, the church and the family, it is quite sure that it is in the family that 
most of us are nearest home, and that what affects the family touches most 
closely the sympathies of men. If the champion of the parochial school can 
appear as the champion of family rights and family freedom, and can man- 
age further to throw over his adversary or the state the guise of coercion, he 
is certainly a good strategist, for that moment he certainly gains an advan- 
tage. Home is a powerful word to conjure with. “Home,” says Cardinal 
Manning very truly, “is the school divinely founded for the first and deepest 
formation of men. . . . The society of mankind springs from the unity, 
authority and obedience of homes. . . . Filial duty is the root of civil 
obedience.” ‘By the law of nature,” he says, “fathers and mothers have 
by right the guardianship of their own children.” And coming directly to 
the question of education, he adds, “Parents have the right to control the 
education of their children. They are bound to select such schools and 
instructors as they believe to be safest and best for their children.” “By 
the law of nature and of revelation, parents are charged with the duty, and 
have also the right, to nurture and train their own offspring, to rear and to 
educate them, to choose the teachers, companions, schools and kind of edu- 
cation their children shall receive.” “No education law can prosper,” he 
says, “which is not in conformity with parental rights and liberty of con- 
science;” and these he declares to be “violated and subverted at one blow 
in the public-school system.” Expatiating with tender eloquence upon “the 
power of a home, with all its charities, chastities and sanctities over sons and 
daughters, not only in childhood, but after they have entered into the perils 
and perplexities of life,” he applauds another writer for contending that “of 
this the public-school system robs the rising generation of the American 
people.” This assembly of American people and of public-school teachers 
will doubtless be surprised to learn that the public school is robbing their 
children of home and home life and influences, and I confess that it is a 
puzzle to me how the public school “withdraws the child from the control 
of the parent” to any greater extent than the parochial school does it; but 
precisely this is the Cardinal’s contention. “The state,” he says, “withdraws 
the child from the control of the parent, thereby making it impossible for 
the parent to confide the child to teachers of his own choice.” “The 
authority and right to educate their children”—this is the generality to 
which the Cardinal comes—“are by the divine and natural law, inalienably 
in the parent, against all civil authority.” The duty and right of the state

in education, he contends, are limited simply to children abandoned by 
careless or criminal parents. The theory that the children are the children 
of the state he declares to be “paganism,” a theory “which has no right in 
Christian or even natural society.” “Nature,” he says, “knows nothing of 
‘school directors.’ ” 
Now, ladies and gentlemen, this all appears to me—I wish to speak very 
plainly here—a poor piece of special pleading by one not making an ear- 
nest effort to reconcile great conflicting claims and establish sound and useful 
general principles, but laboring to weaken men’s allegiance to the state and 
the reverence of families for the state, that so they may be unfortified, con- 
fused and weak when the claim of the church to control education is pres- 
ently advanced against these same families, whose “liberty of conscience” 
and “inalienable rights” are here talked about so glibly. About this claim 
of the church the Cardinal here says nothing, for that claim is not popular 
with the American audience which he was addressing. He talks only of 
the family, seeking to represent this conflict as one between the state and 
the family, seeking to get a little immediate wind for the sails of his cause 
by a poor and false appeal to an easily excited sentiment, carrying this 
appeal so far as to permit himself to represent the family as the supreme 
and ultimate authority in education —a position which every well-instructed 
Catholic and every well-instructed man knows he does not hold for a mo- 
ment. This, I say, is not brave, and it is not honest. 
“Nature,” says the Cardinal, “knows nothing of ‘school directors.’” 
Neither does nature know anything of cardinals, or popes, or priests. Na- 
ture knows nothing of shirts, or petticoats, or knives and forks, or the bath- 
tub. Nature knows nothing of the alphabet, the book, the library, the 
state, or the church. Nature, knows nothing of Plato, or Augustine, or 
Angelo, or Shakespeare, or Gladstone. It knows nothing of gentlemen and 
scholars; it knows savages. It knows nothing of the family, in the sense 
in which Cardinal Manning speaks of the family, with its “liberty of con- 
science” and “inalienable rights.” A great deal of grace had been super- 
induced upon nature, the theologian might say; civilization had made a 
very considerable start, before anything very presentable or impressive in 
the family line answered the roll-call in this world. Civilization had doubt- 
less brought us a good way farther from “nature” when the first priest 
appeared; and it had made a very great advance indeed when it ushered 
in the first “school director.” If we ruled out of our American society 
everything of which “nature knows nothing,” we should rule out much 
more than school directors or cardinals: On the whole, most of us grow 
inclined to celebrate the state of nature less than the means of grace; and 
our eyes get gradually opened to see that the home, the friend, the book, 
the song, the ship, the railroad, the newspaper, the prophet, and the school- 
master are all alike true means of grace, all revealers and arms of the in- 
finite God, all workers together with Him in the long transformation of 
mankind from the rude, crude state of nature into the divine commonwealth.

In truth, Cardinal Manning believes no more in the state of nature than 
does the United States Commissioner of Education. When he resorts to 
such an argument against the public schools as this, that “nature knows 
nothing of school directors,” he resorts, it seems to me, to clap-trap. He 
resorts to convenient generalities about the family, in his conflict with the 
state, which be would instantly trim and repudiate in asserting against the 
family the claims of the church. As I ask you, Catholic and Protestant 
alike, to admire with me the honesty and bravery of our Catholic Dictionary, 
so I ask you alike to condemn with me the clap-trap of the Cardinal. 
Cardinal Manning, I have said, resorts to generalities about the family, 
which, consistently and thoroughly applied, are far more fatal to the 
parochial school and the methods by which it is now sought to establish it 
in America than they can possibly be shown to be to any system of public 
education which exists on earth. The control of education, he says, is, by 
natural and divine law, the inalienable right of the family. It is for 
parents to choose such schools for their children as they believe best. In- 
terference with this parental freedom and authority, is interference with 
liberty of conscience. The sin of the state, in maintaining a system of 
public schools, is in this interference with family choice. 
I propose to show that all this talk about coercion and injustice on the 
part of the state in maintaining public schools, of which we have heard a 
great deal too much, although happily not so much, I think, in these latest 
days as a dozen years ago, is just as valid, and no more so, as talk against 
the principle of taxation itself; and I shall show that this interference with 
liberty of conscience and family choice, with which Cardinal Manning 
charges the state, but of which the state is not in the least guilty, is in truth 
the capital sin of the Roman Church, pervading its whole policy in the es- 
tablishment of parochial schools in this country, from New England to New 
Mexico. 
The argument against maintaining public schools with public money, when 
perhaps this man has no children to send to school and this other chooses to 
send his children to a private school, is a very paltry argument. It is the 
same kind of talk as that of the man who is ruffled at having to pay his tax 
for the new city hall, or the public park, or the public library, which the 
majority has decreed, but which he doesn’t want. Is not the library for 
education, and is not education the office of the family and of the church? 
May the state spend public dollars for what does not relate to “temporal 
welfare,” to the quartermaster’s department of life? Let it at least not buy 
sermons and poems for its library, only cook-books, and guide-books, and 
Cushing’s Manual. Let it not build the art museum, for each family may 
buy its chromo and its photograph of the Madonna in the Vanderbilt man- 
sion. Let it not send out the scientific expedition, with perchance some 
student from the school of mines, who will neglect to submit his proof-sheets 
to Moses. This thing is public education, for which divine or natural law 
cannot be quoted.

130 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  If the city voted that no citizen should take books from any library but 
the public library, that would be coercion; that would be interference with 
the inalienable rights of the citizen. And if the Christian association or 
the Masonic lodge around the corner, pronouncing the public library an 
illegitimate and demoralizing institution, dangerous to Masonry or to young 
Christians, voted that no member should take books from any library but 
that provided by itself—none, under pain of expulsion, from the public 
library, that would be interference with the inalienable rights of the indi- 
vidual; that also would be coercion, and sooner or later, if serious collision 
arose, the state—which, because it is the whole people, while the lodge, the 
’ association, the church, is but a part of the same, is and must be the final 
efficient appeal—sooner or later the state would surely stop it. It would 
be likely to stop it the sooner if these same Masons, for instance, demanded 
that the cost of their separate and anti-social institution should be remitted 
from their taxes, weakening the public institution to that extent, and if this 
offensive general policy of the lodge was a policy unpopular even with the 
mass of its own members, forced upon them by their superiors—TI say it 
would stop it the sooner under these circumstances, for these circumstances 
consolidate that public opinion which is the strong sanction of law. The 
state would not stop the Mason from reading at his lodge, it would not lock 
up the lodge’s library, although it surely would do that sooner or later if 
_ that alone would stop the lodge’s contumely. The lodge might resist, the 
master might remind the mayor, the grand master might remind the gov- 
ernor, the great grand master might remind the President, that Masonry 
was an international affair; but that threat would have no potency until 
backed up by a contingent of Hessians. Should the Hessian Masons come 
in sufficient force, with Russians enough, and with enough Frenchmen, Turks, 
and Prussians, then the lodge’s library would undoubtedly be opened. But 
when that happened, something else would happen. There would then be 
no state at all, and with no state no order at all. That state of nature of 
which we have heard something would loom up so near as to put an omi- 
nous silence for a time to discussions of any distinctions so fine as even that 
between mayors and Masons. The comfortable conditions under which men 
in conventions or at dinners compare their notions of the proper gradation 
_ of authorities come to a very uncomfortable and summary end when once 
. the authority of the state is destroyed. The authority of the state is the 
ground and the reinforcement of all other legitimate authority, because the 
state is the all-comprehensive institution. Every man belongs to the state 
of necessity, is a citizen by virtue of being alive. This citizen or that be- 
longs to this church or that if he will, or he belongs to no church. The 
church of an age, often indeed some individual in the age, may see a truer 
truth, may stand for a better system, than that embodied in the existing 
state. The fact that this is so, indeed, is the very condition of progress. 
Every church and every reformer is at liberty to convert every. citizen, but 
no citizen may be baptized by force, like the old Saxons. The appeal of
-P-A-G-E-131

the apostle of better things is to history and the future; his legitimate en- 
gine for transforming the state is public opinion. For above every state is 
the eternal right, is fundamental justice, against which, if a state be war- 
ring, be it ever so unwittingly, it must finally succumb, though the cham- 
pion of the right be but a single soul. But while order reigns the state is 
the ultimate institutional authority, and necessarily so. The attempt to 
transform the state by violence or threats, instead of by the appeal to pub- 
lic opinion, is incipient revolution. The subversion of the state is anarchy ; 
and with anarchy the occasion of discussions like the present, ceases. 
I have somewhat outrun’ myself in thus attempting to lay down a few 
general principles, and show you where certain courses logically and neces- 
sarily end; and I return to show you that the policy of the Roman Church 
in establishing parochial schools is characterized throughout by precisely 
that spirit of compulsion and coercion, so far as “family choice” is con- 
cerned, by precisely that disregard of “liberty of conscience” with which, 
and not alone at the mouth of Cardinal Manning, it has so groundlessly 
charged the state. But I wish these general principles to be kept clearly 
in mind as we return to this examination. 
Do not think Cardinal Manning’s representation of the family as the su- 
preme authority in education to be a representation in any way peculiar to 
himself. It is a representation often made in these days. It was made by 
Father Conaty, of Worcester, perhaps the ablest parish priest in Massachu- 
setts, at the dedication of a parochial school in the suburbs of Boston last 
July. “By all laws, human and divine, education belongs to parents,” 
argues the late Bishop Baltes, of Alton, in one of his pastorals, as summa- 
rized by a Catholic authority —his aim being, like that of a score of bishops 
whom I might quote to the same effect, to show that for the state to attempt 
to control the family in the field of education is tyranny. This recognition 
of the family as the supreme authority in education characterized the whole 
Roman Catholic argument at the recent hearing before the Massachusetts 
Legislature, which has attracted so much attention, and was so representa- 
tive a discussion that I shall make considerable reference to it here. The 
act which was under discussion, as many will remember, was an act relat- 
ing to the conduct and inspection of private schools, and one of its sections 
provided for the punishment of “any person or persons”—TI quote from the _ 
act —‘“ who shall influence or attempt to influence any parent or other per- 
son having under his or her care or control any child between the ages of 
eight and fourteen years, to take such child out of, or to hinder or prevent 
such child from attending, such public or approved schools, by any threats 
of social, moral, political, religious, or ecclesiastical disability.” A constant 
effort of the Roman Catholic party in this hearing was to represent itself as 
the champion of family freedom, and to show that from the Catholic side 
this freedom was not endangered. By one the bill was expressly denounced 
as aiming at the family. “Legislation which aims at the family,” he said,  
-P-A-G-E-132
132 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
    
“ig wicked. Individuals and parents have the first right as factors in so- 
ciety.” One of the priests who was present as a witness similarly complained 
of the bill as cutting off parents from the exercise of their rightful alterna- 
tive in educating their children. “The parent owns the child direct from 
God.” Father Bodfish declared the act to be “useless and unnecessary,” a 
specimen of the kind of legislation that simply irritates by talking —such 
was his implication—of evils which do not exist. This witness and that 
were introduced to declare that if a Catholic person wanted to send his 
children to the public school, the priest “had no right to forbid it;” that 
no threat of excommunication for attending public schools was ever heard 
in Lowell; that if a parent desired to send his child to the public school 
and the pastor desired him to be sent to the parochial school, “this is a free 
country.” “If a priest tried to exercise further authority,” said one, “I 
would not obey.” ‘TI don’t care whether I am threatened or not,” said an- 
other; “TI shall send my children to whatever school I choose.” “TI never 
heard of a priest who refused the sacrament to the parent for refusing to 
send his child to the parochial school,” said another. “Catholics know 
what their religion is,” said the legal gentleman in his closing speech, “and 
they know that they have the liberty to send their children to any school 
they wish.” 
And yet, ladies and gentlemen, nothing of this kind is the truth. This 
Roman Catholic talk about parental authority and family freedom in the 
choice of schools is all pure fiction. If strict definition is what we are con- 
cerned with, and that, I take it, is what we want here, the sole “liberty” 
which the Roman Catholic parent has, when the command of the church 
comes to him to send his children to the parochial school—and the com- 
mand is issued that every parish shall have its school, and that every child 
of Catholic parents shall leave the public school for it as soon as it is 
efficiently organized—is the liberty to “get out” if he chooses to disobey 
the command. I use the phrase of one of the more jaunty Catholic wit- 
nesses at the recent Boston hearing. “Ifa man joins the Catholic Church,” 
he said, “he is bound by the rules, but is not obliged to remain in the church 
any longer than he chooses.” “Do you believe the parent should exercise 
his conscience apart from the priest ?” was asked him. “ Yes, sir.” ‘‘ Whether 
or not the conscience of the parent interferes with that of the priest?” “It 
cannot interfere with that of the priest, for parents will not remain in the 
church if they do not follow the guidance of the priest. . . . The 
Catholic Church doctrine,” he continued, “is a doctrine of authority. If 
the church makes a rule to refuse the sacraments to a parent who will not 
withdraw his children from the public school, the law could be enforced. 
The law of the church is to obey or get out.” 
Do you know what it means, ladies and gentlemen, for a simple Roman 
Catholic to “get out” of the church? From his infancy up he has declared 
every time that he has repeated his catechism, “All are bound to belong to 
 
-P-A-G-E-133
  DENOMINATIONAL SCHOOLS. 133 
the church, and he who knows the church to be the true church and remains 
out of it cannot be saved.” You will find that declaration in the eleventh 
lesson of the common catechism, as enjoined by the Third Plenary Council 
of Baltimore. In other popular expositions of the faith the doctrine is 
stated in sharper terms. In a little work entitled “Familiar Explanation 
of Christian Doctrine,” adapted expressly for Catholic schools, and pub- 
lished with high approbation, you will read (p.88) that all. the Fathers of 
the church, “without exception,” pronounce those who die out of the church 
“infallibly lost forever.” “Since the Roman Catholic Church alone is the 
true Church of. Jesus Christ,” it is here said, “can anyone who dies outside 
of the church be saved? He cannot.” Now, in respect of fine workman- 
ship, these statements are those of cobblers. The theologian has several 
qualifications and comfortable explanations ready. Cardinal Gibbons and 
Bishop Keane, for instance, would not unqualifiedly tell you or me, who 
stand outside the Catholic Church, that if we die as we are, we are “infalli- 
bly lost forever.” That, they would say, depends. But in the highways 
and byways it is not the custom to draw fine lines; and even the theologians 
would indorse the catechism to this extent, that “he who knows the church 
to be the true church and remains out of it cannot be saved.” And the 
simple Catholic that we are talking about, to whose door comes the problem 
of the parochial school, does believe the church to be the true church. He 
may be learned enough to know, what the theologians could tell him is 
Catholic orthodoxy, that excommunication, if he is really true to his con- 
science, does not, in the ultimate sense intended by the catechism, place him 
really “out of” the church. He may also not be learned enough to know 
this. He realizes the serious danger, in any event, of cutting himself off 
from the regular channels of grace; and he is sure to have such notions of 
the gravity of defying the church as to fill his mind with forebodings of por- 
tentous purgatorial periods whenever he ventures to entertain the thought 
of defiance. ; 
What kind of “liberty,” I ask, has such a man to whom the mandate of 
the church is brought that he shall withdraw his children from the public 
school and send them to the parochial school, on pain of having the 
sacrament and absolution denied him? What does all this fine talk about 
parental authority and family freedom in education amount to under such 
a condition as this? And precisely this is the condition of the American 
Catholic world to-day. If the condition does not exist here or there de facto, 
it is simply because the church, for purely prudential reasons, does not deem 
it wise here or there at this moment to assume an attitude toward the family 
which it claims as its right everywhere and always, and which it may assume 
at any moment anywhere. To the well-instructed Catholic it is not necessary 
to support this statement by proof. But this audience is largely a Protestant 
audience, and for many such substantiation may be instructive and essential.

  134 | THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
Bishop Gilmour, of Cleveland, who has been such a leader in the parochial- 
school movement. 
In his Lenten Pastoral of 1873, which was chiefly devoted to this subject, 
and which raised very much of a storm at the time, Bishop Gilmour said: 
“Tt is our most solemn injunction and most positive command that every church 
in the diocese have its school. Where a congregation cannot at once build both 
eburch and school, let them build the school-house, and wait for the church. 
We solemnly charge and most positively require every Catholic in the diocese to 
support and send his children to a Catholic school, where good Catholic schools exist 
and where it can be honestly said a child will get a fair common-school education. 
If parents, either through contempt for the priest or disregard for the laws of the 
church or for trifling and insufficient reasons, refuse to send their children to a Cath- 
olic school, then in such cases, but in such cases only, we authorize confessors to 
refuse the sacraments to such parents.” 
Parents who for social reasons chose to keep their children in public 
schools, mixing with Protestant children, were expressly pronounced “ un- 
worthy of the sacraments,” and told that they “need not wonder if they will 
be denied them.” The late Archbishop Purcell declared: “We see not“how 
they who willfully and deliberately neglect this duty of sending the chil- 
dren under their care to a Catholic school, when in their power, can worthily 
approach or be conscientiously admitted to the sacrament.” Bishop Me- 
Closkey, of Louisville, in 1879 prohibited the admission to confirmation 
and the eucharist of children who had not passed at least two years in a 
Catholic school; and on January 3, 1880, he issued a decree in which are 
these words: “Now it is our will and command, that where there is a Cath- 
olic school in the parish, parents and guardians in such places should send 
their children or wards who are under nine years of age to such Catholic 
schools; and we hereby direct that this obligation be enforced under the 
pain of refusal of absolution in the sacrament of penance.” The late 
Bishop St. Palais, of Vincennes, in his Lenten Pastoral of 1872, instructed 
the pastors in his diocese to “refuse absolution to parents who, having the 
facilities and means of educating their children in a Christian manner, do, 
from worldly motives, expose them to the danger of losing their faith”— 
meaning by sending them to the public schools. Bishop St. Palais’s suc- 
cessor, Bishop Chatard, said to his people in 1879: “The atmosphere of the 
public schools is not one congenial to the Catholic faith, . . . Were 
you, without very grave and weighty reasons, to send your children to these 
schools, you would sin grievously against charity to your children, and 
therefore would not be in a condition to receive the sacraments, and your 
confessor could not absolve you.” The twelfth statute of the diocese of St. 
Joseph’s, Missouri, declares “that the sacraments are to be refused to Cath- 
olics unworthy the name, who in the education of their children, caring 
nothing for Catholic schools, patronize the secular schools.” “In the late 
case of Rew. Fr. Scully, at Cambridgeport, in the suburbs of Boston, who 
dared follow the teachings of the church [I am quoting a Catholic account]
-P-A-G-E-135
DENOMINATIONAL SCHOOLS. 135 
  and refuse absolution to parents rebelling against their pastor in the matter 
of sending children to certain public schools, when a committee waited on 
Most Rev. Archbishop Williams, the pastor was sustained in his action, and 
the rebels were let to understand that their Bishop considered himself in- 
sulted by the bare suspicion that they would find any support from him as 
favorable to public schools.” Soon after the Cambridgeport commotion the 
Archbishop issued a pastoral address on the general subject, in which, while 
cautioning moderation and the reference to himself of cases where decided 
differences of opinion arose between pastor and parent, he nevertheless dis- 
tinctly authorized every priest to give or withhold absolution at his own 
discretion in disciplining his flock in this matter as in all others. This was 
in 1879, and this remains the status in Massachusetts to-day. The same is 
true of the diocese of Buffalo. In his special Pastoral on Education, issued 
in September, 1882, Bishop Ryan said: “If there be any among our people 
who, having suitable Catholic schools within easy reach, refuse to send their 
children to them, we hesitate not to say that they should not and cannot be 
admitted to the sacraments.” 
Ihave here quoted only passages—they could easily be multiplied —in 
which the condemnation of the public schools by bishops is accompanied 
by distinct threats of ecclesiastical disability to parents continuing to send 
their children to them. If I added passages in which, while not accompa- 
nied expressly by this threat of disability, the denunciation of the public 
schools as Godless and wicked is made in such terms as are equally drastic 
to the ordinary Catholic mind, I might prolong the list almost endlessly. 
I might quote Archbishop Elder, of Cincinnati: “ Where Catholic schools 
can be established, it is sin to send Catholic children to other schools;” the 
late Bishop Toebbe, of Covington: “The public schools are infidel and God- 
less, and must therefore be avoided;” Bishop Janssens, of Natchez: “The 
public-school system should be looked upon by every Christian not only as 
insufficient, but as positively dangerous;” the late Bishop Rosecrans: “He 
who pertinaciously holds the doctrine that Godless schools”—that is the 
common complimentary Catholic term for the public schools—“are good 
enough for Catholic children ceases to be a Catholic, as thoroughly as if he 
denied the Real Presence or the Divinity of Jesus Christ;” Bishop Mc- 
Quaid, of Rochester: “The Bishop who fails to teach and enforce with 
pastoral zeal and vigilance the church’s law of Catholic schools for Catholic 
children, sins; the pastor of a flock who neglects, being able, to provide 
such a school, sins; the members of a parish who refuse to codperate accord- 
ing to their means in the establishment of a Catholic school for their children, 
sin.” 
It is from no one quarter that these utterances come. They are inspired 
by no peculiar circumstances. The legal gentlemen who conducted the 
Catholic case at the recent hearing in Boston objected, when the declaration 
of the late Archbishop Perché, of New Orleans, was quoted, “Our public-
-P-A-G-E-136
136 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  
  school system, as organized in this State, is emphatically a social plague,” 
that this declaration was inspired by the defective organization of the public- 
school system in the Southwest, and must not be treated as representative of 
Catholic sentiment in New England and elsewhere, where the schools are 
better. But it is perfectly plain that when the Archbishop goes on to speak 
of the system as “vicious” and “mischievous” and “nefarious,” he is speak- 
' ing of the public-school system as such, and not of any poor schools in Louis- 
iana in 1872; and the passages which I have cited here have shown you one 
feeling in the New England village and the Louisiana canebrake, in Boston 
and Buffalo and Cleveland and Milwaukee and St. Paul, and in Louisville, 
Natchez and New Orleans. “The doctrine of the church is simply the same 
East and West on educational as on other matters,” says the Catholic 
authority from whom I have made all these quotations, “and doubtless cir- 
cumstances mostly have caused the dearth of Catholic schools farther north 
in the home of the Puritan.” 
“Bishops on Bishops,” he says, “with Archbishops, with provincials, gen- 
eral councils, nay, the very Supreme Head of the Church, inculcate this 
truth in most clear and unmistakable tones. . . . . Verily it would 
seem to be time for Catholic parents to finally understand that they cannot 
approach the sacraments unless they send their children to Catholic schools 
where they have them; and cannot remain without sin, if they do not pro- 
cure themselves the means to the end to which they are bound, viz.: Cath- 
olic schools, in which to raise their children as Catholics. The line is drawn, 
and pastors cry to their flocks: Are you Catholics? Come over to me and 
send your children to Catholic schools.’ Are you not Catholics? Then go 
away about your business; we want no such black, scabby sheep to infest 
the flock of Christ.” : 
This is our author’s pleasant and graceful way of putting what our Bos- 
ton friend meant by obeying the law of the church or “getting out.” This 
is the condition described by Cardinal Manning as “liberty of conscience” 
and the “inalienable right of the family” to choose and control in educa- 
tion. This is the truly orthodox idea of the “freedom of the parent from 
all coercion.” 
The book from which I quote is “The Catholic Educator’s Manual on 
Schools,” by Thomas J. Jenkins (John Murphy & Co., publishers, Baltimore). 
I shall make further use of it. If my address served for nothing else than 
‘ to thoroughly advertise this book, in which the teachings, the claims, the 
program, and the commands of the church on the school question are care- 
fully presented, not by enemies, but by a friend, by one thoroughly com- 
mended and indorsed by the highest church authorities —if my address could 
lead every American teacher and parent and citizen whom it may reach to 
invest thirty cents in this little book and learn at first hand precisely what 
this parochial school-question is, I should feel that it was a very great ser- 
vice.

“These pages,” says the author in his preface, “contain the conciliar or 
single rulings of no less than 380 of the high and highest church dignitaries. 
There are brought forward 21 Plenary and Provincial Councils; 6 Diocesan 
Synods; 2 Roman Pontiffs; 2 Sacred Congregations of some 20 Cardinals 
and Pontifical Orders; 7 single Cardinals— who with 33 Archbishops make 
40 Primates and Metropolitans; finally, nearly 80 single Bishops and Arch- 
bishops deceased or living in the United States. All documents and rulings 
are from the last half-century.” 
The book, I have said, has the highest official indorsement. It bears the 
imprimatur of Cardinal Gibbons, who pronounces it “an excellent repertory 
for those who wish to supply themselves with ready materials for treating 
the subject of Christian education,” and offers the author his “congratula- 
tions on the manner in which he has handled this vital question.” Cardinal 
Newman writes from England —his letter, in fac simile, is printed immedi- 
ately after the title-page—to pronounce the volume “as seasonable and 
important in England as it can be in America.” Bishop Janssens praises 
the author’s mingling of “sound reason with gentleness of expression,” as 
more apt to “convince the American mind” than certain more violent 
Catholic writing on the subject. Monsignor Preston writes that “being a 
compilation of unquestionable authorities, it must do much good.” The 
commendations of numerous bishops, including Bishop Keane and Bishop 
Spalding, are cited; and the newspaper notices wind up the long procession 
of praise. “It is the best work on the subject,” says one. “In it,” says 
another, “the voice of the church on Christian education is made to speak.” 
Another praises it for bringing to the front “what is after all the most 
cogent of all arguments for the Catholic, the judgment of those who have 
been divinely made ‘bishops to rule the church of God.’” 
I marshal to this unusual extent the credentials of this little book, from 
which I quote so freely, because I wish all to clearly understand that I am 
not here repeating things which enemies of the Catholic Church have raked 
together to make capital against the church, but authoritative utterances 
carefully gathered with the warm approval of the highest dignitaries of the 
church for the purpose of adequately impressing upon the people the sinful- 
ness of attending the public schools and the duty of withdrawing from them. 
“We are sure,” says another of the newspaper notices, ‘that nobody who 
peruses this little work can have any doubt but that the Episcopate of the 
Catholic Church is unanimous in condemning the Godless system of educa- 
tion.” And the author himself, at the beginning of one of his chapters, re- 
marks: ‘“Non-Catholics, perhaps, are astonished that our bishops are so bold 
in denouncing the public State schools. It might be answered them that 
they have yet to learn what a bishop is.” 
And yet this is not a matter of individual bishops. As Bishop McQuaid, 
of Rochester, says frankly: “It is not left with ’bishops to choose in this 
matter. They receive commands from an authority higher than their own.”

  138 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
The author of our little manual, where he speaks of Archbishop Williams’s 
support, followed presently by his still more pronounced support of the 
policy of Father Scully in refusing absolution to the parents at Cambridge- 
port who refused to withdraw their children from the public school, says: 
“Though it was thought by the more conservative that the time had hardly 
arrived for anything like a general reversal of former toleration of even the 
best common schools for Catholic uses, it was not long until there were dis- 
covered many more practical supporters of the change than was at all sus- 
picioned—thanks, perhaps, to certain Roman hints.” 
Roman hints! The policy of the church as to American schools, let it 
be remembered, as well as to other things, is determined at Rome, and the 
bishops here have simply to fall into line. As Bishop McQuaid says, “It is 
not left with them to choose.” What are the most important “Roman hints” 
as concerns the relations of Catholies to our public-school system? The 
most important “hint” of all, as is known to most of you, was the Instruc- 
tion of the Sacred Congregation to the Bishops of the United States, on the 
Public Schools, approved and confirmed by Pius IX, November 24, 1875. 
This famous document pronounced our school system “a most pernicious 
system,” and declared that “the most honored prelates must use every pos- 
sible endeavor and means to protect the flock committed to them from all 
contact with the public schools.” It explained the conditions under which, 
pending the provision of parochial schools, the clergy might permit their 
people to continue their children in the public schools, and concluded as 
follows: 
“Whoever, having in their locality a good Catholic school, fitly appointed to 
teach their children, or, having the opportunity of educating their offspring in an- 
other place, nevertheless send them to public schools, without sufficient reasons and 
without the necessary precautions by which the proximate danger of perversion 
may be made remote —all these, it is evident from Catholic moral teaching, if they 
are contumacious, cannot be absolved in the sacrament of the penance.” 
This question of the proximate and remote danger of perversion is a rather 
interesting one, upon which something may profitably be said. But without 
delaying to say anything here, I would remark to this very plain “hint” of 
Pius IX is to be added the declaration of the present Pope, in 1884, that 
the church “has always openly condemned schools called mixed or unsec- 
tarian, and admonished heads of families again and yet again carefully to 
avoid them.” This declaration was in an encyclical letter to the French 
bishops. The pope had previously addressed the Italian clergy to similar 
effect, protesting against the removal of the Catholic catechism from the 
public schools of Rome. ‘“ Not content with these plain, strong instructions 
to the Italian and French clergy, and people,” says the author of our valuable 
little repertory, “the wise and benevolent pontiff has turned his gaze di- 
rectly upon the English-speaking Catholic world, and opening his infallible 
mouth, deigned to teach even the minutiz of the duties of all, in his short,

  DENOMINATIONAL SCHOOLS. 139 
  
comprehensive letter to Cardinal Manning and the English bishops. The 
America-loving Prince has mailed to our Catholic papers in the United 
States a certified translation of this document.” 
Even before this, in the same year, 1885, the pope had revised the decrees 
of the Third Plenary Council of Baltimore, which embodied the following, 
which remains the authoritative general word of the church in America 
concerning the schools: “ We exhort and command our faithful people . 
to regard the parochial school as an essential adjunct of the parish. . . . 
The school is nowise a matter of choice with the priest. . . . Itisa duty 
and burden imposed by the church.” The decree proceeds to condemn as 
something to be “uprooted from the minds of the laity,” “with zeal and 
prudence,” “the erroneous opinion that the solicitude for the school is to be 
confined to that portion of the congregation actually and directly, making 
use of it for their children. It must be plainly demonstrated that the profits 
and blessings accruing from the preservation of faith and morals in parochial 
schools redound to the benefit of the whole community.” Let this word be 
‘noted in connection with certain current objections to the taxation of all 
for advantages accruing directly only to a part of the community. 
I shall not quote any of the generalities from the letter of the Pope to 
Cardinal Manning. I shall refer simply to its report of the maintenance 
in Rome, “ with the greatest effort and at great cost,” of Catholic schools to 
counteract “the prevailing license of opinion and of action,” which it is im- 
plied the municipal schools help to breed, and which had been the especial 
theme of the earlier letter to the Italian clergy; and its declaration that 
“in these schools”—apparently in contradistinction to the other—‘the 
liberty of parents is respected.” I make the first reference because it 
prompts a comparison so broad and instructive that we cannot here afford 
not to make it. The second reference brings us back to our point of de- 
parture. 
The condemnation by the pope of the municipal schools of Rome is 
simply a part of the general papal condemnation of New Italy; it is a 
part of the general condemnation of Victor Emmanuel and Garibaldi and 
Cavour, and of the whole course of Italian politics for the last thirty years; 
it is the voice of one who can find more to admire in the Italy of 1850, 
where such abuses were daily and lawful under the sun as those with whose 
story Gladstone, in his letters of that year from Naples to the Earl of 
Aberdeen, made Europe ring, than in the Italy of 1889, which is the theme 
of Gladstone’s article in the last number of the Nineteenth Century. The 
“America-loving Prince,” to whom our Catholic bishops turn for instructions 
as to the education that shall make America what it ought to be, looks out 
upon New Italy from the windows of the Vatican, and only denounces and 
laments. The great Englishman, whose word also comes to us commended 
by a love for America, which some of us believe equally warm and intelli- 
gent, looks upon New Italy, remembering the history of these thirty years,
-P-A-G-E-140

and wonders and exults. He sees that the removal from the church of 
temporal power is largely what has wrought this marvelous renovation of 
Italy; he knows well that any social or intellectual disorder or extrava- 
gance, known to the envious ecclesiast as “license of opinion and of action,” 
is as nothing to that license of great and petty tyrannies and monstrosities 
in every province of life under which Italy groaned thirty years ago with- 
out provoking any dyspepsia in the Vatican, and without much disturbing 
anybody’s sleep there; and he asks men to pray that Italy may “detect and 
renounce every temptation to'sink back to the level of lower ideas and of 
narrower aims.” 
If this intense zeal on the part of the Roman Catholic Church for the 
good education of her American children be indeed zeal for education, and 
not chiefly zeal for church, how does it happen that the zeal is not equally 
intense where the church has things all her own way? How does it happen 
that this zeal for the good education of the masses in each given country is 
directly proportioned to the excellence of the public schools in that country ? ° 
How does it happen that the chief object of anxiety is the United States of 
America? Are we poor above all men in reading, writing, and arithmetic? 
Is America, on the whole, in greater danger from ignorance than South 
_ America and Spain? Is popular education here, on the whole, behind that 
of Italy thirty years ago? 
The question of Italy, ladies and gentlemen, is the question of the world. 
Deep down, this whole question of parochial and public schools is the ques- 
tion whether we shall admire most the Italy of 1850 or the Italy of 1889.” 
The attempt of the Catholic Church in America to-day to force the children 
into parochial schools by threatening parents with religious disabilities, is a 
galvanic assertion of the old ecclesiastical claim to temporal power—the last 
poor exhibition of thé hoary old claim of the priest to empire and the sword. 
Against all this stands the modern state, the people, jealously respecting 
the rights of every religion and the sane scruples of every man within its 
body; keeping an open ear to every complaint, and pledging itself to redress 
every real grievance, leaving with strict impartiality to every sect the re- 
ligious training of its own children; permitting private schools, with how- 
soever much etiquette and tone, or with prayers many and catechisms many, 
to any who desire them and will keep them to the standard which the state 
prescribes; but insisting that every child shall be well educated in those 
things which belong to the good education of all citizens alike; providing 
schools in which this education shall be given, and insisting that every child 
shall have the privilege of attending these schools; and that in the exercise 
of this common privilege no threat of disability and no intimidation of any 
sort whatever to any child or any parent from any source, religious or polit- 
ical, barbarian or Yankee, Know-Nothing or Fenian, Jesuit or Jew, shall 
be permitted for an hour. 
No man can properly speak of this impartial attitude of the state as 
 
-P-A-G-E-141
  DENOMINATIONAL SCHOOLS. 141 
“compulsion” or “coercion,” who.is not prepared to speak so of the prin- 
ciple of taxation itself and of republican government altogether. The man 
who does it discredits his common sense and advertises himself as a bank- 
rupt with an ax to grind. No man has done it in America, I think, whose 
motive has not quickly been ‘found to be some sectarian ambition or some 
private greed. The objection is not possible to the mind that is public. 
The objection would be valid and would be imperative if the rights of the 
minority were not respected; for respect for the rights of the minority is the 
democrat’s sacred duty. His more sacred duty, however, is to remember 
always that the minority cannot have its way. It must help build the road, 
although it must not be compelled to march up and down it, if it prefers to 
tramp the fields, and, so doing, will not meddle with the turnips. It must 
help build the school, but every family in it must be allowed to teach its 
children in its own kitchen, if, so teaching them, it can only satisfy the state 
that it has taught them well. a 
Some of the truths here briefly hinted are now so obvious to the American 
mind that, whatever other demands may be made from any quarter and 
whatever collisions may yet arise in the schools, I think we shall soon hear 
the last of the demand—which was a very common one a dozen years ago, 
when the parochial schools began to multiply—that the public-school 
money itself should be divided, or that those who chose to support private 
schools should have the cost of the same remitted from their taxes. Of that, 
* Isay, I do not think it likely that we shall long continue to hear. Were 
our answer to the question, Has the sectarian school proper place in America? 
an answer to the question whether the sectarian school should be supported 
by the public money, by the remission of taxes to any church or class, the 
answer would be a very short one. I have sometimes thought that the 
practical absurdities to which the attempt to carry out in America the sys- 
tem of sectarian schools supported by public money would quickly reduce 
us, would, if those who propose it would take one all-round look at it, be 
the most effectual way and a sure way to show them how utterly they have 
confounded the various provinces of education. The practical absurdities 
at once condemn the theory. The support by the state of the Catholic 
school is the support of the Baptist school, of the Jewish school, of the 
Buddhist school; the remission of taxes to the millionaire of Murray Hill 
or the Back Bay, to any group, religious or social, which asks support and 
elects to combine for a school of its own. For the State can show no favor- 
itism; it cannot make exceptions. I am not painting any extravagant pict- 
ure; I am not indulging in rhetoric; I am speaking of what every student . 
of history and politics knows would be inevitable and quick results. The 
_ public support of any’sectarian school, the exemption of any sect or class 
from the school tax, means the confusion and debasement and then the de- 
struction of the public-school system — means England before 1870. I take 
   
-P-A-G-E-142
    142 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
it that America does not desire to gravitate toward the condition of England 
before 1870. 
Whenever, therefore, the parochial school or any school accompanies its 
demand for place in America by a petition for public money or remission 
of taxes, by any claim that is opposed to the integrity of the public-school 
system, we may say very plainly that it has not proper place in America; 
it is fundamentally out of harmony with the American idea, and with our 
genius as a nation. So much, I think, it is not necessary to argue in this 
National Educational Convention. But I wish to say more than that. I 
wish to say, returning to the reference of the present pope, to the “liberty 
of parents” in education, which also brings us back again to Cardinal 
Manning’s declaration about “liberty of conscience,” and the right of par- 
ents to choose for their children the schools they think best, that anything 
that interferes with that right of the family or that individual liberty, has 
no proper place tn America, and will not be permitted in America. I have 
shown you conclusively that the Roman Catholic Church in America, in 
the carrying out of its policy of establishing parochial schools, has entered 
upon a systematic course of ignoring and defying those rights. I have 
shown you that its talk about family authority and the liberty of conscience 
is fictitious and fraudulent, and that the Catholic people of America to-day 
are everywhere under the extremest form of coercion—everywhere under 
the law, to be practically enforced here or there as any priest or bishop may 
decree, to withdraw their children from the public schools under pain of 
such religious disabilities as they believe endanger the safety of their souls. 
This thing, I say, is not proper in America, and this thing cannot be per- 
mitted in America. It is a flagrant violation of the rights of citizenship, 
as citizenship is conceived in this republic; and the great Roman Catholic 
masses, to whom this thing is hateful, to whom the parochial-school system 
is hateful, who are by a vast majority to-day the staunch and grateful sup- 
porters of the public school, to which they and their children owe so much 
—the Roman Catholic citizens of America, because they are citizens of 
America as well as members of the Roman Catholic Church, are entitled 
to be freed from this coercion. I wish that every one of us might go home 
from this convention resolved that upon the statute-books of his State 
should be written such laws against these threats of religious disabilities as 
.I have spoken of in Massachusetts, and, as Iam glad to know, are being 
written elsewhere. There can be no imperium in imperio in this American 
republic. 
The Roman Catholic school, parochial or other, does properly have the 
same place in America (and this right must everywhere be firmly secured 
it) which the Episcopal school has, the Unitarian ‘school, the Lutheran 
school, or any private school whatever—the right to open its doors, to 
make itself as. attractive as it can, and to invite anybody it will. Like 
every other private school, it must satisfy the standards of the State, but
-P-A-G-E-143
  DENOMINATIONAL SCHOOLS. 143 
it has the same right as every other to resent all officious meddling; it 
has the right to be Roman Catholic, as Baptist has the right to be Bap- 
tist; it has the right to criticise the public school, and to say as much as it 
pleases of the superiority of the education which itself gives. But it must 
not threaten, it must not coerce; that is not proper, and that will not be 
permitted in America. 
Strength and endurance in America depend on love of sunlight and the 
air. Whatever believes in itself will here keep open doors. Bishop Keane 
rejoiced, in a recent number of the Catholic World, that the new Catholic 
University was to be at Washington, because there public attention centers, 
there everything is most under the eyes of men; and thus the church chal- 
lenged and invited closest inspection of its system of higher education. 
Let that noble word be echoed by every parochial school. Let every visitor 
be welcome, let every book be on the table. I sympathize, to a great ex- 
tent, with the Catholic Church’s dislike of secret societies; it is seemly, at 
any rate, in this republic, that when the city hall is built the mayor lay the 
corner-stone. Let the church, then, by great boldness, if it believes in itself, 
do everything in its power to lay every suspicion, whatever its ground, that 
it is itself a secret society. Let not the parochial school, when the visitor 
knocks, refer him, as I read in a Milwaukee paper was recently the case in 
that city, “to the archbishop.” 
There are two kinds of propriety. In considering here whether the de- 
nominational school has proper place in America, I have been considering 
whether it be permissible, or properly lawful, and the conditions under 
which it is permissible; and I have confined myself to the Catholic paro- 
chial school, because no other raises any serious problem in our society. 
But much that is permissible and lawful is not proper or right. 
It is not proper nor right for anything in this world to support itself by 
false or harmful arguments, or to live by the perpetuation of evils. The 
arguments. by which the parochial-school system is being forced upon the 
Catholic people of America are many of them—and those main arguments 
—false and most harmful. Its friends are constantly betrayed into a reck- 
lessly exaggerated criticism of the public schools which is vastly more im- 
moral and demoralizing than any possible evils complained of. Here is the 
picture of, the public schools given in our little book: “They everywhere 
banish religion from the school-room and school-grounds; pretend to instruct 
in such branches only as will sharpen the wits to make money by trafficking, 
and cultivate the brains at the expense of the heart — placing man’s destiny 
in the enjoyment of food or the amenities of ‘culture.’ Text-books and 
teachers profess to impart only that which regards what is called ‘secular’ 
education alone, and how to make life comfortable by excluding eternity — 
excluding, therefore, everything that has reference to religious faith and 
religious practices. ‘Let us eat, drink, and be merry —to-morrow we die, 
is a fit escutcheon for every public-school door.” I pronounce that—and  
-P-A-G-E-144

it is not the worst passage I could quote—a gross libel upon the public 
school. It seems to me that the bishops who bless that are engaged in doing 
what is spoken of in the Old Testament as “cursing that which God hath 
not cursed”—a business into which even Balaam refused to go. Cardinal 
Manning himself has argued that the public-school system has demoralized 
New England, and attempted to substantiate it by the statistics, comparing 
crime in New England with that in the South under the old régime—sta- 
tistics which have been so completely demolished by Judge Tourgée, and by 
General Walker in his letter to Professor Fisher. In truth, whatever the 
relation of the facts, increase of crime in New England has been almost 
exactly proportioned to Roman Catholic immigration. Cardinal Manning 
quotes with approval the statement that the moral tone of the public schools 
is sinking through the gradual withdrawal from them of good and efficient 
teachers. One Catholic authority remarks that the Protestant children are 
the immoral and wicked in the public schools, and the Catholic children the 
chief sufferers. Bishop Spalding has well said, that “a sophistical mind is 
as immoral and irreligious as a depravéd heart,” and that “when a man per- 
suades himself that a lie may be useful, he becomes the foe of all that makes 
life high and God-like.’” “The faultfinder,” he has said again, “is hateful 
both in life and in literature,” and “a Christian, of all men, is without ex- 
cuse for being fretful and sour.” The public schools are the great moral- 
izing institution in America to-day. This is shown by the simplest analysis 
of the discipline and essential methods of the schools—the training which 
they give in habits of punctuality, order, obedience, industry, courtesy, and 
respect for simple merit. 
There is nothing more moralizing than history well and truly taught, 
showing the operation of the stern laws of cause and effect in the lives of 
nations and of men. The appeal-is to this great convention of teachers. 
The appeal is to the public schools of this city which we visit to-day — equal 
in every moral quality, I venture to assert, while knowing little of them in 
particular, to the parochial schools of any city in the land. Much in the 
loose indictment is slander upon the noblest men and women of America. 
The criticism has miserably failed. The superiority of the parochial school 
to the public school in any moral quality has not been shown. The talk 
about the public schools as “ Godless,” which is common in Catholic mouths, 
should also be severely dealt with. As well talk of the newspaper or the 
shoe-shop as “Godless,” because work is not begun with a prayer-meeting. 
It is true that work and prayer should go hand in hand, but there is a time 
for work and a time for prayer; and so is there a time for arithmetic and a 
time for catechism. There is no educational maxim, perhaps, better than 
“A sound mind in a sound body,” but it does not follow that the school is 
not competent to teach physiology without supporting a gymnasium. It is 
true enough that the religious education of vast numbers of children is sadly 
deficient; but this accuses chiefly the family and the church, and not the

public school. There is nothing in the life of the school that militates 
against religion; there is much in the life of many families, even Roman 
Catholic families. Let us begin our reforms at home. The school cannot 
do everything. It is an evil thing to confound provinces in education; and 
it is a distinct harm, both to intellectual training and to religion, to mix 
religious exercises carelessly with ordinary school-work. No science, no 
realm of education, is “Godless.” God is the God of Winthrop and Wash- 
ington and Lincoln as truly as of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, the God 
of geometry as well as of the calendar of the saints. “The brighter the 
torch of science,” said Bishop Ireland, dedicating the new cathedral at 
Providence the other day, “the clearer is the pathway to God’s throne. 
Wherever science penetrates, with geologist’s hammer, with astronomer’s 
telescope, with biologist’s microscope, everywhere there is order and har- 
mony and beauty.” Then is it impious to call the public schools “God- 
less”? “Stupidity is more to be dreaded than malignity,” said Bishop 
Spalding at the laying of the corner-stone of the Catholic University, at 
Washington, “for ignorance and not malice is the most fruitful cause of 
human misery. Men in becoming wiser will become nobler and happier. 
The evils that spring from enlightenment of mind will find their remedy in 
greater enlightenment. Since morality is practical truth, increasing knowl- 
edge will make it at once more evident and more attractive. To be dis- 
trustful of science is to lack culture.” The public school is America’s 
Amen. . 
A parochial school can never give anything else than a parochial educa- 
tion; it cannot make the mind public and large. The state may justly 
complain of it as anti-social. The public school is the great conserver of 
our democracy, best bringing all classes into understanding of each other. 
The priest complains that the Catholic boy is ridiculed at school. Doubt- 
less he often is, and it is a wrong — we are still savages to someextent. Shall 
he then be fenced in, or live it down like a little man? So is the Irish boy 
ridiculed —“ Paddy” is an epithet much oftener hurled than “Catholic”— 
and the Chinaman, the Negro and the Jew. Shall they then be herded by 
themselves? Rather it is a reason why they should stay. The Jew at the 
head of the class must be reckoned with; in the Ghetto he is a starveling 
and a menace, The fact that so many of our Roman Catholics are still es- 
sentially “foreigners” is a reason why they above all others should be kept 
long in the public schools. The state cannot encourage insulation, and 
none of us can afford it. Parochialism fosters the narrowness and dispro- 
portion which are falsehood. The Methodist boy is being maleducated and 
wronged, to whom the chief thing told of Oxford in his geography is that 
Wesley studied-there; the Catholic, who learns of Lima only that it is 
noted as the birth-place of St. Rose, or in whose “English Literature” 
Dennis F. McCarthy —the illustration is from a common text-book—has 
equal space with Hawthorne, and Kildas and Bishop Doyle crowd out en-

  tirely Shelley and Keats. It is not good for the Catholic boy to read in 
his history — my references are all to common text-books — that “ Catholicity 
' has ever appealed to reason; Protestantism, like Mohammedanism, to force 
and violence ;” to have Luther and the Reformation explained by the word, 
“Wicked men are always disposed to rebel against authority ;” to be told 
that almost all valuable inventions have been by Catholics; to learn much 
in his geography of Pere Marquette and the Jesuit missionaries at Mt. 
Desert, and little of the Pilgrim Fathers, of Winthrop, and Penn, and Capt. 
John Smith. Such teaching of history is not moralizing. I shall not here, 
however, enter in detail into the faults of the parochial-school text-books, 
because I have done that elsewhere. The Catholic schools are in the danger 
in which Brownson, the best Catholic mind we have had in America, declared 
them to be in his day, of keeping their pupils in the Middle Ages instead 
of in the Nineteenth Century. I am ‘conscious of differing sharply in my 
theories of education, and of church and state, from some who are present, 
from whom in much I would gladly learn. But no motto is so good for the 
scholar as that old word of Aristotle, “The truth.before Plato;” and, in 
discussions like the present, the plainer we are, and the quicker we fully 
understand each other, the better. If I have misstated any fact, I shall 
quickly be corrected in this newspaper age. About Roman Catholic relig- 
ion I have nothing to say. This is a political and social question. I have 
spoken as I would speak of the Presbyterian synod, if it took the same po- 
sition which I here condemn in the Catholic. I have before now earned 
dislike by the sharp words with which I have more than once defended Ro- 
man Catholics, in this school controversy, from the Protestant bigotry that 
sought to make religious capital out of it, and I am willing to earn more. 
But the Roman Catholic masses need now to be shown plainly just where 
they are being led; and they should be made to feel their duty, as Ameri- 
can citizens, of reminding priests and popes that the control of “faith and 
morals” cannot be extended to the how their children shall get their arith- 
metic and history, or to any province that priests may elect. 
This is a bad time’ to urge that the state should not educate its children, 
but leave that work to be attended to as it may. We are now advancing 
to a higher and not a lower view of the state and of its functions and duties. 
We all need to feel as citizens that we are as truly our brothers’ keepers as 
the churchman used to feel himself as churchman. I find in most of the 
Catholic utterances on education no sense of obligation to the whole, no 
civic breadth, no thought of any children but their own. We should all 
know and take:to heart that, by the very nature of the case, all are children 
of the state, as all are children of families and some are children of the 
church. To be educated, is to be able to stand outside ourselves. No man 
is so uneducated or so dreary as the high-churchman whose only talk is of 
surplices and stoles and Sexagesima Sunday, and whose only book is Keble; 
or the Boston Unitarian whose only sentiment for the Baptist around the

corner is a pale, supercilious pity, and to whom Henry Ware is a greater 
name than Maurice or Newman. The Baptist College cannot give a proper 
education with none but Baptist professors; no college can that fosters the 
notion that astronomy or political economy or Greek has anything to do 
with church polity or creed. We hear much in these days of a National 
University at Washington; and just now a Catholic University is being 
opened at Washington. I wish it well if it pursues a truly catholic course, 
as I wish well to Wesleyan University and to the Congregational College 
at Amherst. It is a good augury that at the head of this Catholic Univer- 
sity is to stand the eloquent scholar whom we have heard to-day. There is 
no bishop in the church, save Bishop Spalding alone, who seems to me so 
truly in harmony with what I have called the American idea. But I feel 
that no university at Washington under the auspices of any church can ever 
be such a university as that which Washington, in his last message to Con- 
gress and in his will, commended to the American people. Let us at least 
see to it that the public schools, the schools of the whole people, are ever 
kept informed by that broad public spirit which was the spirit of Washing- 
ton, and in any danger to which he saw our greatest danger. 
RESPONSE TO MR. MEAD. 
BY BISHOP KEANE. 
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: I thank you heartily for this addi- 
tional courtesy. I believe, under the rules of the common law, when a case 
is opened and then counter-argued, the side that opens the case has the right 
to close it. 
I have listened with a great deal of pleasure to the very able argument 
of Mr. Mead. As he said of those whom he quoted, “I like his plain-spoken 
honesty.” That sort of a thing I am never afraid of. The only thing that 
I fear is that lurking criticism that sneaks behind you, and tells lies behind 
your back. I am willing to face the biggest kind of a lie provided it is said 
to my face. 
It would of course be impossible for me, in an impromptu reply, to attempt 
a full analysis of a discourse embracing so. many details as that to which we 
have all listened with pleasure. I can only take the three or four salient 
points upon which I think all the rest can be considered to hang. First, © 
to begin with what has been said concerning Cardinal Manning. The two 
points dwelt upon were Cardinal Manning’s honesty and Cardinal Manning’s 
logic. As to Cardinal Manning’s honesty and candor and character, the 
question reminds me of a little story that I heard quite lately, and which I
-P-A-G-E-148
  148 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
hope I may be allowed to repeat without seeming to be discourteous to Mr. 
Mead. In one of our Eastern cities a literary critic, whose name we will 
suppose to have been Wilson, wrote a criticism upon Tennyson, to prove ° 
that Tennyson was simply no poet at all. Our critic’s criticism was com- 
mented on by one of the leading papers of the country. “We all know 
Wilson,” said this newspaper, “we have all heard of him; but who in crea- 
tion is Tennyson?” We can safely leave Cardinal Manning’s character and 
honesty to the judgment of the English people and of the world. 
But now as to Cardinal Manning’s logic. It has been shown how egre- 
giously Cardinal Manning has misunderstood the very nature of things, 
since, it is alleged, he has upheld the “state of nature,” which of course 
must fail to accord with a state of civilization. The truth is that Cardinal 
Manning was not talking about the state of nature at all: Cardinal Man- 
ning was talking about the law of nature, about the natural law; and that 
natural law is the basis of all the legislation that will ever be true and just 
in this world. And the truest and the highest civilization is that which 
comes closest to the application to all human beings of all the requirements 
of the natural law. That natural law lays down the inalienable relation- 
ship between parent and child, which, as it exists in a state of nature when 
the natural law is applied in its most primary manner, must also hold true 
in a state of the highest civilization where the natural law has its fullest 
and most. beautiful development. And when the church reminds the state 
of this, it is unfair to say that the church is thereby antagonizing the state. 
Next, the gentleman took up Leo XIII, and with that perfect intuition 
into character which so characterizes Mr. Mead, he passed immediately from 
what the Pope said to what the Pope meant, declaring that the Pope, in 
passing condemnation upon the exclusion of religion from the municipal 
schools of Rome, meant not what he said, but aimed at asserting the old 
political condition which preceded United Italy, as better than that which 
had followed the year 1870; nay, more, that not only the utterances of the 
Pope, but also our indorsements of them, when, rightly understood, were ° 
really a re-assertion of priestly dominion. 
Now, my dear friends, I hope that my statement can be trusted as that of 
an honest man. If I believed that what I would say here would be accused 
of insincerity, then indeed ought the President of this Association to be 
seriously blamed for having invited me into your presence. I therefore, as 
an honest man, speaking the truth and the whole truth and nothing but the 
truth, honestly and before God, say that that interpretation of the words of 
Leo XIII is false and unjust. Again, I mean no unkindness to him who 
has just spoken. My desire is to meet everyone with an outstretched hand 
and with true friendliness; but as Mr. Mead has just said, it is well to 
speak the truth, to speak it clearly and plainly; and because what I say is 
true, because I know it to be true, I say with all the vehemence of my 
being, that it is false to say that Leo XIII, in condemning the exclusion of 
 
-P-A-G-E-149
  DENOMINATIONAL SCHOOLS. 149 
religion from the schools, was simply uttering an argument in favor of tem- 
poral power; and it is doubly false to say that we, in indorsing the pope’s 
condemnation of the exclusion of religion from the schools, are seeking to 
establish a condition of priestly dominion and empire. As an honest man, 
as an American citizen before this American assemblage, I declare that in 
the heart of priest or bishop or Catholic in the United States, though 
heartily indorsing the pope’s condemnation of the exclusion of religion 
from the schools, there lurks no such intention, no such hidden motive, no 
such insidious aspiration as that which has just been imputed to us: it is 
false, and there is no truth in it. 
Mr. Mead then took up the action of the bishops of this country, and 
condemned severely their action in refusing the sacrament to parents who 
refused to give their children a Christian education by sending them to the. 
Christian schools provided for them. Friends, we have been discussing this 
morning the part that Christianity ought to have in moulding the heart and 
the mind, the character and the life of the child who is to be the father of 
the man. Now the Catholic conviction which I maintain, is by no means 
exclusively a Catholic conviction. I have heard it declared in tones that I 
could not pretend to rival in force, in reviews and newspaper articles, from 
Christians of every shade of denominational belief. One of the very 
strongest articles on that subject that I have recently read, appeared a short 
time ago in the Presbyterian Review, from the pen of the Reverend Mr. 
Jenkins, a Presbyterian minister of Illinois. This is not a Catholic ques- 
tion; it is a Christian question; and it is not logical to narrow a debate 
which concerns denominational schools, down to an attack upon the Catho- 
lic church. Christians believe that the Christian influence, the Christian 
spirit, ought to run as an integral element through the whole school-life of 
the child, as I tried to unfold and explain this morning. Christians there- 
fore believe that it is the bounden duty of Christian parents to give such an 
education to their children. Christians therefore believe that any Christian 
parent who has the opportunity to give his child such an instruction, and 
will not do it, does wrong. Christians believe that any parent who delib- 
erately does wrong to the life, the character, or the soul of his child, is no 
fit person to receive holy communion. If a Catholic parent had the op- 
portunity to give his child Christian education, and would not do it, the 
Catholic Church would consider herself guilty of sacrilege if she gave that 
person holy communion. This is Christian belief, and the Christian church 
throughout the world has the right to act on that belief. If the Catholic 
church says to a parent who refuses to do his first of all duties to his child, 
“Because of your delinquency in regard to your child I cannot give you 
communion,” what power is there in this world that shall say to the 
Church, “You must give him holy communion”? It has indeed been said, 
and it was a considerable part of the discourse that we have just heard, that 
“there is no authority on earth superior to the authority of the state.” 
10—N. E. A..  
-P-A-G-E-150
  150 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  
Friends, that is exactly the theory that was held more than 1,500 years ago, 
when the head of the state called himself “the Divine Emperor.” In that 
epoch it was said to the Christians: “You are enemies of the public weal ; 
we command that you come forward here and show your loyalty to the state 
by offering divine homage to the statue of the Emperor.” But the Chris- 
tians replied: “Render to Cesar the things that are Cxsar’s, but to God the 
things that are God’s; we are ready to go to prison, we are ready to go to 
the gibbet, we are ready to be thrown to the lions in the amphitheater, but 
never will we, with our belief in a God, submit to subscribe to the declaration 
that there exists no authority superior to that of the state.” A man who 
utters such sentiments is just 1,500 years behind the times. That thing was 
settled in the Roman amphitheater, where solitary men and solitary women 
stood up before the power of the great Roman Empire, the greatest embod- 
iment of stateship that ever existed, and said, “I cannot do it, and you will 
never conquer me.” Friends, that state of things will never come in our 
American republic. As I said awhile ago, the spirit of our American re- 
public is essentially Christian; and a Christian republic like ours will never 
try to base its policy on a heathen axiom. 
Friends, but a few years ago this principle was put to a mighty test in 
our country. A great question was raised, involving morality and hu- 
manity. Voices clamored, “Thus and so says the law of the land, and that 
is the end of it.” But a mighty voice cried out, “There is a higher law,” 
and in facts which history will never forget, our country set her seal on 
that assertion forever. Yes, friends, there is a “higher law,” and that 
higher law says that the parent is bound in duty to remember that his child 
is going forth. into human society, capable of being a benefactor, or capable 
of being a hyena, and that he has before him at the end of his earthly career, 
a hereafter; that it is the parent’s duty to see that his child shall receive 
such training as shall fit him to be a benefactor to his race, by having in 
his heart the spirit and character of his Divine Master, and to reach safely 
hereafter the destiny that he was made for. In order that his child may be 
thus fitted for his life nere and hereafter, he places him in a Christian 
school. But now comes some man who says, “Ah! but it is the business of 
the state,”—to enforce the principle that the state shall be supreme—“it is 
the business of the state to go into those Catholic schools and see whether 
that principle is there inculcated, and if it is not, then, regardless of any 
higher law, to close those schools.” Friends, I am not exaggerating. Mr. 
Mead has just told us of that controversy that was lately before the Legis- 
lature of Massachusetts. He quoted one of the clauses of contention, but 
he did not say anything about the others. Suppose you let me read them 
to you: 
“Ex-Governor Long, for the petitioners, said in substance, after some discus- 
sion, that the petitioners abandon all proposed legislation except the following: 
“First: Absolute right of inspection and supervision, by the local school com-
-P-A-G-E-151
DENOMINATIONAL SCHOOLS. © 151 
  
  mittee, of every private school in which any children between the ages of eight and 
fourteen were being educated. 
“Second: That every parent or other person in control of a child able to attend 
a school, and between the ages of eight and fourteen, who would not cause such 
child to attend a public school, or a private school approved by the local school 
committee, would be subject to a penalty of twenty dollars, whether it appeared 
that the child was receiving a good education elsewhere or not.” 
Now I say this is the most outrageous impertinence and intrusion into the 
rights of the family that I ever read of. With cool effrontery they propose 
that, “whether a parent could show or not that his child was receiving”— 
mind you the words of the law as proposed—* receiving a good education 
elsewhere” —even if he could show this, yet, unless the little “school com- 
mittee” would give their indorsement to that school, the child is to be 
dragged out and the parent fined twenty dollars. Ok, how we love liberty, 
when it means coercing others into what we choose! 
“Third: That the local executive committee shall only approve of a private school, 
when the teaching therein is in the English language, in the branches provided by 
law, and the text-books used therein are such as may be approved by the commit- 
tee, [Oh, those wonderful committeemen!] and when they are satisfied otherwise of 
the progress and condition of the school.” 
It would not have been pleasant for Mr. Mead to tell you that all this 
was in the law as proposed. But I believe you know as well as I, that the 
great good sense of the commonwealth of Massachusetts treated this pro- 
posed law as it deserved, and that the law and its upholders were, substan- 
tially speaking, kicked out of court, as they deserved to be. 
Friends, my confidence is that such will always be the case with the people 
of America. They are not going to allow any clique—whether it be a re- 
ligious clique, or whether it be a political clique, or whether it be a school- 
board clique, or whether it be any other clique—they will not allow them 
to form by themselves some little theory of just what instruction ought to 
be, and then force that upon the whole American people. The American 
Republic is too big a thing to have narrowness of that sort forced upon it. 
An appeal has well been made to the authority of our great Washington. 
Washington well said that the people in educating their youth must be on 
their guard against the delusion that morality could be preserved without 
religion. ‘These are the words of Washington, and these words should, be 
nailed to the masthead of the bark of the Republic. © With this motto, please 
God, we are willing to sink or swim— but with it there is no sinking: it is the 
truth, itis right, it is the law of nature, it is the law of God, and it must prevail. 
When that progress of the American States takes place which has been so 
freely spoken of here, that progress on the road to which we are advancing, 
what is going to be the result? The American people will open their eyes, 
and no longer be hoodwinked nor be duped by “clap-trap” of which we 
have heard so much this morning; “clap-trap” which would make men 
believe that by crying out for an existing system they were doing all that

  was necessary for the public good. The public are going to look into this 
system; they are going to see whether the system is the best that could be; 
they are going to criticise it; and I thank the gentleman for having so pos- 
itively declared that it is the right of every American citizen to discuss and 
criticise the system. Discussion must go on, criticism must go on, and 
assuredly the time must come when the intelligence and conscience of our 
people, guided by this wise principle of our immortal Washington, will de- 
cide wisely to which of these two sides popular education is to be intrusted, 
to which of those two classes that have stood represented before this conven- 
vention to-day—one class saying, “I don’t believe in the dominion or control 
or direction of any church; I don’t believe in submitting one’s proof-sheets 
to Moses”—in England they call this Agnosticism; the other class insist- 
ing on the clear-cut and plain declaration that our country’s civilization is 
a Christian civilization, that its basis must be Christian education, and 
that such education can be given only by making our schools more Christian 
than they are. Surely our country cannot hesitate which of these two sides 
is for her welfare; she has but to look closely, to reason calmly, and then, 
through no coercion, through no wheedling, through no clap-trap, but through 
the force of common sense, through an understanding of the whole facts, she 
will nail to her masthead the banner of Christian education, and steer on 
under its guidance to that blessed destiny the most glorious God ever gave 
to a nation—the destiny of our American Republic. 
PUBLIC AND PAROCHIAL SCHOOLS. 
JOHN JAY, NEW YORK CITY. 
There is perhaps no subject personal and political in its bearings and 
national in extent, of more profound interest to a vast majority of our 
countrymen than the common-school system, which is recognized at home 
and abroad by intelligent people of all creeds and parties as the chief basis 
of our government of the people, by the people, and for the people, and the 
chief source of our undoubted strength and unsurpassed prosperity. 
The hereditary conviction of Americans on this point, their unbounded 
confidence in its excellence and its permanence, and the preference shown 
by intelligent Roman Catholics for the common school, has hitherto tended 
to make Americans view with careless indifference the assaults of the papal 
government upon the American system. But that indifference has been 
overcome by the political deals and Jesuitical methods resorted to in the 
corruption of our legislatures for illegal grants and unconstitutional con- 
cessions, and by the policy which has of late been exhibited in so pronounced
-P-A-G-E-153

and unmistakable a manner by papal encyclicals, the decrees of provincial 
councils,* and ultramontane clericals, books and newspapers, denouncing 
the common school as a Godless and heathenish institution that must be 
destroyed. This assault made simultaneously along the line of states, and 
the significance of which is enhanced by the growing opposition of loyal 
American Roman Catholics to the attempts to force them to withdraw their 
children from the public schools, has given to the question a national im- 
portance. The extent to which it appeals to American sympathies was 
illustrated by the recent uprising of the citizens of Boston and the over- 
throw of a municipal government which was thought to have betrayed 
American principles; and new force has been given to the national convic- 
tion of the necessity of extending and perfecting the common school to 
counteract foreign association, as little in harmony with American institu- 
tions as the Clan-na-Gael. 
THE ATTEMPT TO EXCLUDE THE BIBLE. 
A preliminary and significant step in the war upon our common-school 
system was taken a few years since, when it was complained of by some 
Roman Catholic ecclesiastics connected with the mission to America as be- 
ing sectarian in its character, for the reason that there was allowed the 
reading of passages from the Holy Scriptures in a version deemed by their 
church as erroneous and heretical. Many Americans, both clerical and lay, 
the most devoted to the Bible as the grand foundation of our liberties and 
our civilization, in their devotion to equal religious rights were disposed to 
recognize the justice of the complaint, and to secure harmony by excluding 
the Bible. When in some places on this ground ‘the ultramontanes had 
obtained a partial victory, the extent of which has been much exaggerated, 
their able organ, the Freeman’s Journal, with a frankness that had not been 
conspicuous in the earlier discussion, made this outspoken admission No- 
vember 20, 1869: 
“Tf the [Roman] Catholic translation of the books of the Holy Writ which is to 
be found in the houses of all of our better educated [Roman] Catholics, was dis- 
sected by the ablest Catholic theologians in the land, and merely lessons taken from 
it, such as Catholic mothers read to their children, and others added with the highest 
Catholic indorsements; and if these admirable Bible lessons, and these alone, were 
to be ruled as to be read in all the public schools, this would not in any substantial 
degree lessen the objection we [Roman] Catholics have to letting Catholic children 
attend the public schools.” : 
Lord Brougham, in parliament, while insisting on the reading of passages 
from the Bible as a proper religious exercise, suggested that the Hebrew 
and Roman Catholic children whose parents might object to their presence 
during the reading should be allowed to retire. The occasion for this pro- 
vision as regards the enlightened Hebrews of our country would seem to be

slight in view of the notable action of Rabbi Isaacs and others of their an- 
‘cient faith in New York City, who protested against the assumption that 
they were in favor of excluding the Bible from the common school, and 
who gave as the historic explanation of their position, that they had never 
been persecuted in lands open to its teachings. That interesting and most 
significant fact with its logical consequences is worthy of remembrance; and 
the avowal of the Freeman’s Journal verified the wisdom and far sight of 
Horace Greeley when he said: 
“The great body of those who seek to drive the Bible out of our schools will not 
be satisfied after they have driven it out, but will insist on breaking our common- 
school system into sectarian fragments. . . . Hence, if we give up the Bible, we 
only weaken our common-school system, . . . while we fail to conciliate its ene- 
mies and only excite them to new and inadmissible exactions.” 
The admission of the Freeman’s Journal gave force also to the clear argu- 
ments of our statesmen and divines that while the public schools should be 
kept absolutely free from all denominational and sectarian influence, it 
would be cruel and wrong to exclude the children from the knowledge of 
those broad and general precepts and principles which are admitted by all 
Christians. Daniel Webster with simple logic said: 
“This objection to the multitude and difference of sects is but the old story, the old 
infidel argument. It is notorious that there are certain great religious truths which 
are admitted and believed by all Christians. All believe in the existence of a God. 
All believe in the immortality of the soul. All believe in the responsibility in another 
world for our conduct in this. All believe in the divine authority of the New Testa- 
ment. . . . And cannot all these great truths be taught to children without their 
minds being perplexed with clashing doctrines and sectarian controversies? Most 
certainly they can.”* 
The same idea has been expressed by President Adams, of Cornell, when 
he said: 
“T take it there is no sectarianism in the Sermon on the Mount, nor in what may 
be called the etrictly moral teachings of the New Testament. There can be no diffi- 
culty in getting at the source of obligation in a hundred ways other than by tread- 
ing upon grounds in regard to which Christian sects are not agreed.” 
The latest judicial decision in regard to the Bible in the public schools, is 
that of Judge Bennett, of Wisconsin, in the case of Weiss vs. School Board 
of Edgerton. : 
The action was brought by Roman Catholic parents for a peremptory 
writ of mandamus directing the board to cause the reading of King James’s 
version of the Bible in the public schools to be discontinued. The reading 
was not compulsory, nor the plaintiffs’ children required to be present at 
the reading. The exclusion was demanded on the grourd that the reading 
was “sectarian instruction,” and an unconstitutional interference with the 
rights of conscience. Judge Bennett reviews all the cases and discusses

  PUBLIC AND PAROCHIAL SCHOOLS. 155 
the principles in an opinion of seventy pages, and comes to the following 
conclusion : : 
“T have never in any book found thoughts expressed with greater clearness, or 
in a style at once more beautiful and sublime, than in those quotations from the 
Psalms of David, the writing of the great apostle of the Gentiles, and in the lan- 
guage of our Saviour taken from the Gospels. I am unable to find anything in them 
tending to sectarian instruction, or that can be justly said to interfere with the ten- 
derest and most sensitive religious conscience in the slightest degree. The reading- 
books, as well as those treating of the sciences, are constantly changing in our 
public schools. Those in which I read and studied when a lad are, with the excep- 
tion of the Bible, almost entirely unknown to the present generation, save only those 
in the dead languages. But the Bible remains, and it would seem like turning a 
good, true and ever-faithful friend and counselor out of doors, to exclude it from 
the public schools of the state; and I have been unable to find any authority in the 
decisions of the courts for so doing. No court has ever held, that I am aware of, 
that it is unconstitutional to read the Bible in the public schools. The Supreme 
Court of Ohio have held it may be excluded from the public schools by the trustees 
and boards of education, but not by the courts; while in Maine, Massachusetts and 
Iowa, under constitutional provisions similar to our own, the courts sustain the 
trustees and school committees in adopting it as a book in every way suitable and 
proper to be read on the opening of the schools of each day.” 
The manner in which the Bible is spoken of by those who would sup- 
press its general reading may be seen by an extract from Cardinal Wise- 
man, who says it is: “The school-boy’s task-book ; it is the gaoler’s present; 
it is the drunkard’s pawn-pledge;, it is the dotard’s text-book; it is the irrey- 
erent jester’s butt; it is the fanatic’s justification for every vice, blasphemy 
and profaneness which he commits. If, therefore, we be asked why we do 
not give the Bible indifferently. to all, and the shutting up (as it is called ) 
of God’s word be disdainfully thrown in our face, we will not seek to elude 
the question, or to meet the taunt with a denial, or attempt to prove that 
our principles on this subject are not antagonistic to those of Protestants, 
They are antagonistic, and we glory in avowing it. The experiment has 
been tried on a great scale of what the indiscriminate reading of the Bible 
will make a people. It has transformed a mild and promising race into a 
pack of lazy, immoral infidels.” * 
The proposition is now made in the name of the Roman hierarchy that 
we shall modify our common-school system by admitting parochial schools, 
under ecclesiastical control, to an equal share of the school moneys, as a 
part of the system of the American State. The proposition is accompanied 
by an argument in favor of the fitness of each religious denomination teach- 
ing its own doctrines at the expense of the state, and by charges against the 
common-school system as established by law as being Godless and heathenish, 
and the fosterer of immorality, ignorance, pauperism, vice, and crime. This 
view is presented by the court and hierarchy of Rome as essential to the

- olic Belief,” in Collette’s Letters to Cardinal Manning, London, John F. Shaw & Co., 1886, page 26,

rights and interests of the Roman Catholic laymen of America, who are 
represented by the clergy as being in favor of the parochial schools. But 
that this is true of only a small part of those laymen, is shown by the Roman 
Catholic press complaining of the many Roman Catholic parents who openly 
advocate the public schools. 
Cardinal Manning’s paper in the Forum for March has revived the 
memory of that contest, and His Eminence, it seems, misled by statements 
on which he had relied, has erroneously assumed that because the entire 
separation of church and state is a fundamental principle of the Republic, 
therefore the state knows nothing of Christianity, is unable to teach morality, 
and to allow the Bible to be read in the public schools. 
A study of our constitution and political history would have saved the 
regret which His Eminence felt for our heathenish condition. 
He would have learned from Prof. Dwight, the learned President of the 
Law School of Columbia College, that “it is well settled by the decisions of 
the courts of the leading States of the Union that Christianity is a part of 
the common law of the State. . . . Not Christianity founded on any 
particular religious tenets, not Christianity with an elaborated church and 
titles and spiritual courts, but Christianity with liberty of conscience to all 
men.” 
Dr. Woolsey, whom the country now mourns, eminent alike as scholar, 
jurist, and divine, would have advised him of the duties of the public-school 
teachers as laid down by the Massachusetts statute instructing them “‘to 
exert their best endeavors to impress the youth committed to their care and 
instruction in the principles of piety and justice, and a sacred regard for 
truth; love of their country, humanity, and individual benevolence; sobriety, 
industry, and frugality; chastity, moderation, and temperance, and those 
other virtues which are the ornament of human society, and the basis on 
which a republican institution is founded.” 
The question now presented to us touching the denominational school re- 
fers as I understand not so much to the various schools of religious denomi- 
nations, established and supported by the several denominations for the 
inculcation respectively of their peculiar doctrines, for such have long ex- 
isted in our country without any question of the right of the founders to 
establish them or the right of parents to send their children to them. So 
long as such schools are established in pursuance of our laws, with a recog- 
nition of the right of visitation by the State, to see that the general educa- 
tion given therein is such as the welfare of the State requires for all its 
citizens, and that nothing is taught therein which is dangerous to the morals, 
the peace or the safety of the commonwealth, there would seem to be no 
- valid objection to their maintenance by those interested, so long as they 
impose no tax, and inflict no injury on the people at large. 
I suppose, therefore, that the question refers to the proposition occasion- 
ally urged upon us by the promoters of the parochial school —that the state 
 
-P-A-G-E-157
  PUBLIC AND PAROCHIAL SCHOOLS. 157 
should recognize denominational schools as part of the school system of the. 
state, and make appropriations for their support from the school fund now 
devoted exclusively to the public schools. 
In approaching this discussion with the fairness due to a constitutional, 
political, and social question so intimately connected with our national wel- 
fare, I think we may assume that our thoughtful citizens, of whatever faith, 
whether native or naturalized, who are devoted to the interests, the princi- 
ples and the honor of our country, that they are perfectly agreed with 
reference to the millions of foreigners already here and the millions yet to 
come, that our only safety is in perfecting and extending our common-school 
system on a basis that will serve to Americanize the children of these for- 
eigners, to fit them socially, mentally, and morally for their responsibilities 
as American citizens; and to make the schools so fitted for this great work, 
that while we may agree with Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes that a child’s 
education should commence an hundred years before it is born, we may still 
find much truth and consolation in the assurance of Henry Ward Beecher, 
that “the children of all nations of the earth go into our common schools 
and come out Americans.” 
A tidal-wave of immigration has already overtaken our large cities. New 
York, we are told, has eighty per cent. of persons of foreign birth or for- 
eign parentage. New states of gigantic extent are waiting for admission, 
and besides the Dakotas, Montana, and Washington, already authorized by 
Congress, Utah, New Mexico, Idaho, Wyoming, and Arizona will soon de- 
mand recognition. 
Some imagine as looming in the future, Canada, Mexico, and Central 
America; and for all who may come with their peculiar languages and 
customs, habits, constitutional beliefs and foreign civilization, it is for us by 
unceasing vigilance and wise forethought to meet the new requirements, and 
to continue in the future as in the past, by God’s help, an homogeneous 
people, the loyal citizens of an undivided republic. It is for us to provide 
an effective system of training to make them American citizens, and that 
system should be marked by the broad Christian ethics to which we owe our 
high civilization, and which are the only guaranties of civil and religious 
liberty. 
Whether the adoption of the proposed scheme of substituting for the com- 
mon school, with a simple and uniform system of education, moral, intel- 
‘lectual and physical, under the charge of educational experts responsible to 
the State for keeping the elementary system at the highest standard of ex- 
cellence, a system of denominational schools in private hands, teaching 
varying sectarian and perhaps clashing doctrines, religious and political, 
will tend to harmonize and unify the rising generation, native and foreign, 
and make them distinctly American, is a question which to Americans 
generally would seem hardly to admit of discussion. 
But one characteristic of Americans is their readiness to expose and
-P-A-G-E-158
  158 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
analyze every error and abuse that may be discovered in their institutions, 
no matter how wounding the exposure to American pride, as has been shown 
in the civil service reform exposures of political corruption, and to consider 
fairly every remedy that may be proposed. 
In this spirit the American people are ready to listen to all advice, re- 
membering that its admissibility will depend on its accordance with Ameri- 
can constitutions and American law; with the rights that they give, and 
the duties they impose. The advice given should, of course, be unaccom- 
panied by the slightest shadow of dictation. “A real state,” as Mr. Glad- 
stone says, “must be supreme within its own sphere.” The American state 
rests upon the sovereign will of the people constitutionally expressed, and 
any shade of menace in word or tone toward the sovereignty of the people, 
is not only an affront to the national honor, but to the self-respect of every 
loyal citizen. But while Americans will naturally resent all attempt at 
dictation or underhand intermeddling by the agents of any foreign power, 
they are perfectly willing to hear the distinguished experts and representa- 
tives of the sovereign pontiff, no matter how absolutely their views of gov- 
ernment, theology and education differ from our own. We know the wisdom 
of the broad and ancient maxim that teaches one to learn from one’s ene- 
mies. On the subject of public schools, their duties and their dangers, we 
have gathered many useful ideas and the most important information from 
Dr. Brownson, Father Hecker, Dr. McGlynn, Archbishops Kenrick and 
Purcell, Bishop Cosgrove, the Catholic Review, the Freeman’s Journal, and 
various other presses, prelates and laymen of the Roman Catholic faith on 
this side of the water; from the late Popes Gregory XVI and Pius IX, and 
from His Holiness Leo XIII; from that astute diplomat, Antonelli, and from 
Cardinals Manning and Newman, who at the time of the Vatican Council 
strikingly represented the extreme antagonism in the Roman Church; from 
* Lord Acton, whose manly devotion to the truth of history presents an hon- 
orable contrast to the pitiful subserviency to pelf and popularity which 
has occasionally led Protestant authors and publishers to allow works pre- 
tending to be historical to be colored and perverted with Jesuitical men- 
dacity. 
We are also greatly indebted for the authoritative information afforded 
us by the Civilta Cattolica, the Papal Encyclicals, the decrees of Provincial 
Councils, and especially to the Syllabus, that remarkable treasure-house of 
Roman dogmas, which should be studied with care by American scholars 
and statesmen, students, and thoughtful citizens. Intelligent observation 
will show them that a clear idea of the political bearings of the Syllabus is 
of greater importance to the Americans and their children than the laws of 
ancient Greece or of pagan Rome. It throws a flood of light on various 
erafty schemes professedly in accord with American ideas, and in favor of 
equal rights, liberty of conscience, freedom of worship, of charity, education, 
and reform, but which are in fact prompted by a foreign court in the interest
-P-A-G-E-159

of an alien civilization. It discloses the dangers threatened by legislative 
deals for foreign votes in exchange for unconstitutional grants and conces- 
sions; it explains the vicious legislation by which our taxes have been 
enormously increased, and thousands of children entitled to an American 
education have been subjected to foreign control. It discloses dangers that 
threaten us in the future, and forcibly reminds us of Burke’s remark that a 
nation may lose its liberties in a day and not discover it for years. 
Recalling the advantages thus afforded us of gaining an accurate knowl- 
edge from high sources of the real doctrines and designs of the Society of 
Jesuits, the condemnation of whose maxims and methods by the Church of 
Rome we well remember, we welcome to-day to the field of free discussion 
before the sovereign citizens of the Republic, a Prince Cardinal and Right 
Reverend Bishop of that church which holds Pope Clement XIV to have 
been infallible. They are here, as we understand, in charge of the Roman 
mission for the conversion of America, claiming like ambassadors from a 
foreign power to be governed by the edicts of their own sovereign, and 
claiming in addition, that the authority of the potentate whom they repre- 
sent is supreme also in this land, and above all constitutions and laws. 
But we trust that they have learned from their knowledge of American — 
history, American law, and American character, gained during their resi- 
dence in our country —an advantage which we believe Cardinal Manning 
has never enjoyed —to appreciate the historic devotion of this people to the 
principles of their constitution, popular sovereignty, liberty of conscience 
and of worship, of speech and of the press, to the fitting education and in- 
dependence of the voter, and to a complete separation of church and state. 
As in this view it is pleasant to turn from the more disagreeable features of 
the school question with which, in New York, we are unpleasantly familiar, 
the barter of American principles for foreign votes, the secret deals of un- 
scrupulous politicians, whether clerical or lay, foreign or native, to meet in 
the open these eminent ecclesiastics, the accredited representatives of the 
court of Rome, who as we understand accept a public discussion, and who 
come to avow and justify before the American people their views, sentiments, 
methods and aims in desiring to revolutionize our school system, and who 
will know how to appreciate and reciprocate in this distinguished American 
presence the frankness in the presentation of facts and arguments blended 
with personal courtesy that lends so much of grace and dignity to public 
discussions between American gentlemen. 
It is needless to remind you, for the debates in this contarehod proclaim 
the fact, that to-day the gravest charges have been made against our com- 
mon-school system, and that for the education and protection of the morals 
of Roman Catholic laymen in America the court of Rome has resolved 
upon its destruction, and has authorized spiritual censures to be enforced 
against American citizens who in disregard of her orders continue to send 
their children to the public schools.

  160 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  Like our national and State constitutions, our common school has been 
the growth of centuries, and recalls to us the interesting period so well de- 
scribed by Dr. Storrs in his graphic and impressive sketch of “The Early 
American Spirit and the Genesis of it.”** Tracing the outline of our revo- 
lution, he showed that it was the spirit behind our little force that compelled 
the events and gave them importance in history; he recalled the fact that 
the early settlers of this country were not one stock, but of several; and 
that they brought with them a power and a prominence from the greatest 
age of European advancement. Portraying that brilliant century which 
saw at its beginning the coronation of Elizabeth and ending with the death 
of Cromwell, Dr. Storrs recalled it as a century marked by extraordinary 
genius, amazing achievements, the decay of authority, and the swift advance 
of popular power. It was the age of Raleigh, Drake, Bacon, Shakespeare, 
and Milton, an age illumed by poetry and stirred with the tumultuous force 
of the Reformation. Glancing at the vehement public life of modern Eu- 
rope, in England, the Netherlands, Germany, and Sweden, he showed that 
out of this century, so full of enterprise and productive force, came the early 
settlers of America, attracting little attention, but bringing with them the 
energies of the continent, and with the push of a century behind them. 
When we follow the history of our country through its colonial, revolu- 
tionary and constitutional periods, we can mark at every step the effective, 
elevating and ennobling influence of the common school, however unobtru- 
sive and unobserved, as the instructress, protectress, and, as it were, the 
guardian angel of the infant nation. We note the beneficent result of its 
early teaching in developing manly thought and elevating personal char- 
acter; on home life, on moral, social, intellectual and material progress, and 
especially in the training of its statesmen who from generation to generation 
have assisted in the gradual formation of the national constitution, forming 
in their constituent moral life one people—fearless, reflective, energetic, 
constructive, industrious, and martial; intensely practical, politically active, 
religiously free—the heir to a great past, with before it the uncertainties of _ 
an obscure future, with incessant labor as their primary teacher. Hence 
came the early constructive spirit in whose light rose the Republic which as 
Dr. Storrs reminded us “interlinks our annals with those of the noblest time 
in Europe, and makes us heirs to the greatness of their history.” Such were 
the people, representing the best blood, the purest morality and the highest 
intelligence of Europe, whom Burke described as “of that kind which is 
most adverse to all implicit submission of mind and opinion,” as exhibiting 
a refinement of the spirit of resistance, “the dissidence of dissent, and the 
protestantism of the Protestant religion.” Such were the men to whom 
America owes that elementary source of its Christian civilization, broad en- 
lightenment, manly patriotism, and world-wide influence, the common 
school.

  PUBLIC AND PAROCHIAL SCHOOLS. 161 
THE PUBLIC SCHOOL IN AMERICAN HISTORY. 
The American public school, however humble and obscure it may have 
seemed to superficial observers, has grandly illustrated in its teachings the 
two great features of the Republic, which some of our foreign friends may 
have found it difficult to understand—that our common law is broadly 
Christian, and that, as a consequence of that broad Christianity, it affords, 
the fullest scope for liberty of conscience and freedom of worship by a com- 
plete separation of church and state; and its history shows that these com- 
bined and harmonious principles have secured peace, prosperity and strength 
by a popular government based upon the divine ethics of the Bible which 
all denominations of Christians profess to recognize. 
While other nations, where church and state have united for the repres- 
sion of religious freedom and popular education, afford startling examples, 
in their natural and inevitable order, of despotic rule, religious persecution, 
and national decadence, our annals illustrate Dr. Johnson’s remark, that 
no part of history is so generally useful as that which relates to the history 
of the human mind. 
As regards our republic, its history without an appreciative recognition 
of the part borne in it by the common school, would be as “the shell with- 
out the kernel.” 
It has been a wise thought, happily adopted by some recent historians, 
and which will give new light and value to our future histories, that the 
most important part of history relating to the social life of the people should 
no longer be sacrificed to a record of governmental acts; and that the quiet 
undercurrent of private life, keeping “its depth and steady course in the 
eternal channel,” should not be overlooked in marking the storms that have 
agitated its surface. The world is at last awakening to the fact which our 
fathers saw so clearly, that upon the right direction of the undercurrent of 
elementary education in every country depends the future of that land. As 
Lecky well says, “ History is not a mere succession of events connected only 
by chronology. It is a chain of causes and effects,’ and in a republic 
especially the education of the nation is the chief cause that determines its 
destiny. The boy is father of the man, and the children of to-day are the 
society of to-morrow. We see in our infant sons the coming voters, and in 
our girls the mothers of the next generation of sovereign citizens. It is not 
a matter of surmise, but the conclusion alike from history and philosophy, 
that every principle contains the germ of a prophecy, and that the policy 
which controls the American school will presently control the government 
of the nation. 
‘What the American school has been in the past, only those who have 
studied its history may thoroughly understand; but its results are before 
the world. It has revolutionized the ideas of some of the ablest publicists 
and cabinets of Europe, as the Monitor and the Merrimac revolutionized 
naval warfare and wooden battle-ships. Lord Brougham announced, while
-P-A-G-E-162
  162 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
England was slow to appreciate the truth, that in our age the schoolmaster 
is abroad, and that more trust may be reposed in him armed with his primer 
than in the soldier in military array, for upholding and extending the liber- 
ties of the country; and Germany and America have shown that the edu-. 
cation of a people for the duties of peace adds greatly to their efficiency in 
time.of war. Macaulay, in his speech on education for Great Britain, re- 
ferred Parliament to the early example of the Puritans of Massachusetts 
requiring every township, when it numbered fifty houses, to appoint one to 
teach the children to read and write, and every township that numbered an 
hundred houses to set up a grammar school; and he added that this doc- 
trine was not confined to New England, but “Educate the people” was the 
first admonition of Penn, the legacy of Washington, and the unceasing ex- 
hortation of Jefferson. : 
The honor due to the far-sighted Christian founders of our common 
schools, among whom the Dutch and Huguenots of New Netherlands are 
entitled to a much larger share than has been generally awarded them, was 
frankly acknowledged by the Roman Catholic World when it said, in April, 
1870: 
“Tt is to the credit of the Americans that they have, at least the Calvinistic por- 
tion of them, from the earliest colonial times taken a deep interest in the education 
of the young. The American Congregationalists and Presbyterians, who were the 
only original settlers of the Eastern and Middle colonies, [here the Dutch and 
Huguenots are entirely ignored,] have from the first taken the lead in education, and 
founded, sustained and conducted most of our institutions of learning.” 
The Puritans of New England appreciated the necessity of public schools, 
and that feeling was shared by the Huguenots and the Hollanders, by the 
Walloons from Flanders, by the Vaudois‘and Waldenses from the Italian 
Alps, Protestants from Germany and Scandinavia, by the followers of Huss 
from Bohemia and Zwinglius from Switzerland, by the United Brethren, the 
Moravian brothers, the Salzburg exiles, with Christian reformers of every 
race and tongue who had contended at home, even to the death, for the open 
Bible as the true standard of Christianity and the only sure foundation of 
civil and religious freedom. Touching the instruction given in our Ameri- 
can schools during the colonial period, the teaching of Christian ethics was 
from the first an essential feature. 
We may recall also with pleasure, that about the same time when Clem- 
ent XIV condemned the Jesuits, and, in Mr. Gladstone’s words, “leveled 
with the dust the deadliest foes that mental and moral liberty have ever 
known,” Charles Carroll was a signer of our Declaration of Independence, 
and that Washington subsequently recognized the patriotic services of the 
Roman Catholics who served in the war of the Revolution, and the assist- 
ance we received “from a nation in-which the Roman Catholic faith, as 
defined by the Gallican Church, prevailed;” and Washington declared to 
them in words which should not be forgotten, whatever questions may here- 
after arise, “May the members of your society in America, animated alone
-P-A-G-E-163

  by the pure spirit of Christianity, and still conducting yourselves as the 
faithful subjects of our free government, enjoy every temporal and spiritual 
felicity.” Mr. Gladstone, in reply to his critics on the Vatican decrees, paid 
a tribute to the loyalty of the lay Roman Catholics of England, from Eliza- 
beth to Victoria, adding at the same time, that they had been “eminently 
noted for their thorough estrangement from ultramontane opinions, and 
their clergy down to the period of the emancipation act felt with them.” 
The movement for religious liberty by separating church and state began, 
nearly simultaneously in New York, Virginia, and Pennsylvania, soon after 
the Declaration of Independence; but in separating church and state they 
were careful not to separate Christianity from the common law. The dis- 
tinction between Christianity and “church,” in the relation of the latter to 
the state, is plainly shown by the constitution of the State of New York, 
established during the war, in 1777. While adopting the common law as it 
stood on the 29th of April, 1775, of which Christianity was a part, the state 
was careful at the same time to ordain that “such parts of the common law 
as might be construed to establish or maintain any particular denomination 
of Christianity or their ministers are hereby abrogated.” The state, while 
making Christianity a part of its common law, refused to allow such parts 
as might be construed in favor of the establishment or maintenance of any 
particular denomination of Christianity or their ministers; and every act 
which has been passed by the legislature of that state, under whatever name 
or pretense, which assists, establishes, or maintains any particular denomi- 
nation of Christianity or their ministers, is in violation of the constitution, 
for-every part of the common law which might be construed as authorizing 
such establishment or maintenance has been abrogated. 
The erroneous ideas that have been of late so industriously circulated, on 
the subject of Christianity and the state, may justify here a reference to the” 
supremacy of the common law, the connection of Christianity and the state 
under that law, coupled with the absolute establishment of equality of re- 
ligious right and the prohibition of any establishment or maintenance of 
any particular denomination. (See Appendix A.) 
The adoption in 1789 of the first constitutional amendment, jostaenen 
Congress from making any law respecting an establishment of religion, was 
followed in 1875 by the movement originated by General Grant and formu- 
lated by Mr. Blaine, for a further amendment, extending that prohibition 
to the states. The vote of the House in its favor of 180 ayes to 7 noes, and 
the fact stated by Senator Blaine that it was defeated in the Senate by the 
Jesuits—the vote being 28 to 16, wanting the necessary two-thirds—are 
_ significant as showing the deep conviction of the American people that such 
an amendment (and one is now pending before Congress) should be adopted. 
(See Appendix B.) 
Apart from the provisions and meaning of American constitutions, (on 
which we may be pardoned for preferring the decisions of our own courts 
 
-P-A-G-E-164
  164 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
to the interpretation which Cardinal Manning and the Italian Council of 
the Vatican proffer for our acceptance,) when our foreign opponents point 
to the public school as having made us an irreligious and immoral nation, 
we may refer without impropriety to the counter opinions of distinguished 
and impartial experts. 
The approval by Americans who are thoroughly American in their ideas 
of the civilization which illustrates the principles and ideas which they hold 
and cherish, may naturally suggest that their judgment is biased by their 
training, and that ‘the wish is father to the thought. This remark will 
hardly apply to so accurate an observer and critic as Dr. Orestes A. Brown- 
son, who is regarded by Roman Catholics as the “most original and philo- 
sophic thinker that America has produced.” Dr. Brownson expressed his 
firm conviction that “the American civilization is the highest civilization 
that the world has ever seen, and comes nearer to the realization of the 
Catholic ideal than any that has been heretofore developed and actualized.” 
“Tn this respect,” he added, “American civilization is, we say not the term 
of human progress, but in our judgment, the farthest point in advance as 
yet reached by any age or nation.” * 
More than half a century ago DeTocqueville remarked that the American 
people combined the notions of Christianity and liberty so intimately, that 
it was impossible to make them conceive of the one without the other, and 
as indicating that they hold religion to be indispensable to the maintenance 
of republican institutions. 
Prof. Bryce, in his recent able work on the “American Commonwealth,” 
adds this striking confirmation of De Tocqueville’s views, based on his care- 
ful observation at the very time: 
“They are also a religious people. It is not merely that they respect religion and 
‘its ministers, but that they have an intelligent interest in the form of faith they 
profess, and pious without superstition, and zealous without bigotry. . . . Chris- 
tianity influences conduct not indeed half so much as in theory it ought, but prob- 
ably far more than it does in any other modern country, and far more than it did 
in the so-called ages of faith. Nor did their moral and religious impulses remain 
in the soft haze of self-complacent sentiment. The desire to expunge or cure the 
visible evils of the world is strong.” 
Of these tributes that of Brownson has peculiar weight from his devotion 
to the Roman faith, and his views that our civilization “comes nearer to 
the realization of the Catholic ideal than any which has been heretofore de- 
veloped and actualized.” 
To these we may add a significant opinion from Herbert Spencer. Brown- 
son spoke of the great past when he said, “The American civilization is the 
most advanced civilization that the world has ever seen;”. Herbert Spencer " 
of the boundless future when he said, “I think whatever difficulties they 
may have to surmount, and whatever tribulations’ they may have to pass

through, the Americans may reasonably look forward to the time when they 
will have produced a civilization grander than any the world has ever 
known.” 
THE COMMON SCHOOL AND THE PAROCHIAL SCHOOL. 
The aim of the American public school and of the Roman parochial 
school are as antagonistic as the constitution and the syllabus, as the doc- 
trine of popular sovereignty and the dogma of papal supremacy. The 
duties of the American citizen for which the public school is intended to fit 
‘him, are those of a sovereign ruler. He is to be independent of the world, 
and especially of every foreign prince or potentate; he is to be governed by 
allegiance to the Republic, and is to obey its constitution and laws expressed 
in the constituted will of the American people; and to maintain the funda- 
mental principles of civil and religious freedom, and the separation of church 
and state. 
The public school, if faithfully maintained as established by our fathers, 
teaches not only the elements of education, but teaches personal responsi- 
bility, freedom of conscience and of thought, loyalty to American principles 
and constitutions, love of country, and duty to our fellow-men. 
Such teaching with no taint of sectarian doctrine, but in a pure atmos- 
phere of Christian ethics, and our duty towards our neighbor as recognized 
by all Christian sects, their teaching is unblended with human dogma and 
denominational differences. 
If in any case sectarian dogma should be taught, public opinion would at 
once correct it, and the utmost vigilance should be observed to see that no 
denominational teaching shall ever enter a public school, and that the char- 
acter and capacity of the teachers are such as to fit them for their responsi- 
ble work. 
The common school properly conducted has been well described as the 
surest condition to the healthy and progressive life of the Republic, “on 
which order, confidence, credit and stability permanently depend.” It cul- 
tivates and enlarges the mental vision, invigorates the understanding, trains 
the reasoning powers, quickens and purifies the imagination, lays the founda- 
tion of American thought and character, inspires an honest ambition, teaches 
self-control, obedience to law, right and kindness to our fellows; while it 
instructs the pupil insensibly but surely with a regard for learning and cul- 
ture and moral excellence as the sure foundation of national prosperity and 
happiness and of the institutions so wisely founded by our patriotic ances- 
tors. If these advantages are important for the young American, born and 
bred among American influences, they are if possible more important still 
for the children of foreign emigrants in their tendency to rub off the foreign- 
ism in tone and feeling and manner, to train them for a higher civilization, 
to Americanize them in their youth, to encourage in all a kindly feeling of 
brotherhood, a common pride of country, and a common resolve to support, 
perfect and perpetuate her institutions.

    166 THE NATIONAL ED UCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
In the struggle for existence which awaits them, would it not be the height 
of injustice toward them, as well as the height of folly for the nation at 
large, to refuse them the elements of instruction that-are given in the public 
schools? To that instruction they have all a right, and that right the state 
has no right to deny herself, or to allow it to be interfered with by any for- 
‘eign prelate, under any pretense whatsoever, by threats temporal or spir- 
itual, for in such a case such threats are undue influence, and should be 
restrained by law. 
Let our public schools develop and Americanize all that is bright and 
beautiful in the Irish character, with its traits of poetry, wit and imagina- 
tion, blended with energy, hope, and love. Let them assimilate to American 
feelings the best qualities of the German character, as a Boston orator lately 
described them, “the religious principlés, deep thinking, their family love, 
and home life.” 
The aim of the parochial school is to form a subject of the pope, and not 
an independent citizen of the American Republic, and the character of the 
education is admirably fitted for this purpose. Why so large a part of the 
Roman laymen in America refuse to send their children to the parochial 
schools, and incur excommunication and anathema rather than obey the 
papal order, plainly appears when the Catholic Review gives the explana- 
tion: “We do not prize so highly as some of our countrymen seem to do 
the ability to read, write, and cipher. Some men are born to be leaders, 
and the rest are born to beled. The best-ordered and administered state is 
that in which the few are well educated to lead and the many are trained 
to obedience.” 
Dr. McGlynn describes a parochial school in New York as so cheaply 
conducted that one woman teacher had some eighty children. And one can 
understand the indignation felt by Roman Catholics ordered to send their 
children to the parochial schools when they could réad in the Freeman’s 
Journal, (March 12, 1881,) that “a smattering of the catechism is supplied 
to fit them for the duties of life,’ with the intimation that they were only 
“apologies, compromises, systemless pretenses.” 
In these features of the parochial school, the intelligent Roman Catholic 
finds the seeds of “the enervation and emasculation which are the insep- 
erable companions of Roman ascendency,” which go to form the perfect 
Jesuit of whom Father Hecker speaks, as the antithesis of the thinking, 
responsible American citizen. He desires for his children an education fitted 
for the hopes, trials and responsibilities of American life, and not one pre- 
pared with the opiates of Rome, “with the stillness of death and the silence 
of the grave.” 
He desires his sons to speak in the manly tones of an American citizen, 
and not as Taine describes it, “the infantile and snuffling tone of the Middle 
Ages.” But above all he desires his children to have the characteristics of 
the country to which they have come, while as Dr. Brownson declares of
-P-A-G-E-167

the parochial schools: “These schools must be taught chiefly by foreigners, 
or if not by foreigners, at least by those whose sympathies, connections, 
tastes, and habits are un-American, because what is wanted by their founders 
and supporters is not simply the preservation of orthodoxy, but the preser- 
vation of the foreignism associated with it.” 
As an American author who has studied the question well remarks: “Ro-

one is death to the other.” * : 
; THE PROPOSITION FOR DENOMINATIONAL SCHOOLS. 
The proposition that American States, with their constitutional guaran- 
ties of liberty of conscience and freedom of worship, of the right of free 
speech and personal security, and all the rights and principles distinctly 
American, should tax the people for the establishment of public schools, in 
which shall be taught the doctrines of the Syllabus, the infallibility and 
supremacy of the pope, the subjection of the American law to the Roman 
pontiff, the invalidity of all marriages unsanctioned by the pope, reducing 
American wives to concubines, and children to the position of bastards, 
placing their estates at the mercy of the Roman church, and breaking up 
the family life of the Republic; teaching that the civil power must yield in 
case of conflict to the ecclesiastical which can avail itself of force; that 
there should be no more liberty of speech, of the press, of conscience, or of 
worship; and with the closing proposition of the Syllabus forbidding all 
hope of amelioration in the dogmas of the papacy from the enlightening 
influence of our Christian civilization, since it is declared as a thing which 
all must believe or be damned, that the sovereign pontiff “should not become 
reconciled to progress, liberalism, and the spirit of the age.” (Some inter- 
esting Roman Catholic testimony in regard to the policy and designs of the 
Jesuits in America can be found in Appendix C.) The entire proposition 
seems to answer itself, and to suggest the question, Why should the Ameri- 
can people commit such an act of national suicide as to surrender the pub- 
lic schoals to the enemies of the Republic for the demoralization of the 
nation and the subjection of the government? Why should the American 
people be taxed to support the schools and dogmas, services and ceremonies 
of the court and church of Rome, and to invest its representation in fact 
with the national powers they claim the right to exercise? Why should 
the nation surrender to the papal power their sovereignty, their honor and 
their rights, and undo in a day what their fathers secured through the sac- 
rifices of centuries, and on the battle-fields of Europe? Why should they 
change the system of education which has secured them a civilization and a 
prosperity without parallel for one which has reduced the older parts of the

  world to the depths of degradation, to which we have been pointed by 
Macaulay, Lavely, and Gladstone? 
Think of an American government, with its pride of nationality and of citi- 
zenship, resting its security not on a standing army but on patriotism —love 
of country and obedience to law —establishing foreign schools to teach this 
primary political doctrine as thus defined by the Civilta Cattolica, (VII, 
page 26): 
“Catholics, be they French, German or Spanish, or whatever else, are more sub- 
jects of the Pope, as the head of the church and their spiritual prince, than they 
are of the king or the emperor as their temporal prince: the ties which bind them 
as subjects in the first respect being beyond comparison more intimate and more 
elevated than those which bind them to the second.” 
But apart from these profound and overwhelming considerations, which 
speak for themselves and require no legal authorities to sustain them, comes 
the thought that the national constitution and the common law absolutely 
forbid such a proposition. Judge Cooley, in his “Constitutional Limita- 
tions,” (page 409,) enumerates among the things concerning religion which 
are not lawful under any of our State constitutions: 
“J, Any law respecting an establishment of religion. The legislatures have not 
been left at liberty to effect a union of church and state, or to establish preference 
by law in favor of any one religious denomination or mode of worship. 
“2. Compulsory support, by taxation or otherwise, of religious institutions. 
“3. Compulsory attendance upon religious worship. 
“4, Restraints upon the free exercise of religion according to the dictates of 
conscience. 
“5, Restraints upon the expression of religious beliefs.” 
But apart from these constitutional objections, there are two preliminary 
ones which are sufficiently grave, and which it may be well to consider. 
The first is, that the proposition for the amendment of the existing school 
Jaw—to allow each denomination to teach its own peculiar doctrines, and 
to receive its share of the school moneys—which is presented as a matter of 
equal fairness to all denominations, treating them all alike, is converted into 
an act of inequality and unfairness to all other Christian denominations 
besides the Roman Catholic, by the fact that the Roman pontiff claims as 
belonging to the Church of Rome, and subject to its teaching and discipline, 
all persons whomsoever who have been baptized, no matter by whom the 
ceremony was performed, so that all the baptized members of the Episcopal, 
Presbyterian, Congregational, Baptist, or Methodist churches may be claimed 
for the parochial schools, leaving only the unbaptized members to be in- 
structed by those denominations—a scheme which would greatly enlarge 
the Roman Catholic Church in America at the expense of the rest. 
Then comes the serious objection, that the eminent cardinals and prelates 
of the Roman Church, who make this proposition to tax the people for the 
support of the parochial schools, however correctly they may represent in 
this suggestion the wishes of the pope in this matter, do not represent the

great body of Roman Catholic laymen in this country, for the reason that 
a large number of their laymen decline to sanction the parochial schools, 
and decline to send their children to the parochial schools, calmly disre- 
garding the orders and threats of the ecclesiastical body which commands 
them to obey on pain of exclusion from the sacraments. 
The extent of the opposition of our Roman Catholic citizens to the paro- 
chial school, is shown by the Roman Catholic press and by the futile eccle- 
siastical attempts to compel them to obedience. In their determination to 
protect their children from the adverse influences of the parochial school 
there may be reason to believe that they are occasionally encouraged by 
the quiet sympathy of bishops and clergy, who are not’ all disposed, it 
seems, to relinquish entirely their rights as American citizens. Reported 
extracts from Dr. McKain, bishop of Wheeling, Bishop Foley, Dr. McGlynn, 
the Catholic Review, Catholic Standard, W. McGurrin in the North Ameri- 
can Review, W. Carrigan of Boston, Mr. McElrone in the Independent, 
throw no little light on the subject as reasonably explaining the position of 
those who decline to accept for their children the parochial schools. 
One remarkable testimony, given by Father Hecker in his latest work, 
“The Church and the Life,’ published in 1887 shortly before his death, 
may well have a great and controlling influence upon the minds of Roman 
Catholics in America. He explained the downfall of the Roman Church 
in France, Austria, Italy, Spain, Bavaria, South America, and Brazil, which 
he said were controlled by hostile minorities, and sometimes the minorities 
were very small, by attributing it to the habit of personal dependence re- 
quired for the defense of the church, “at the expense necessarily of those 
virtues which go to make up the strength of Christian manhood.” 
Then came the further admission, the admission, the truth of which all 
can recognize who have reflected on the startling facts of history which have 
forced the conviction on a mind like Hecker’s, that here is “the explanation 
why fifty millions of Protestants have had generally controlling influence for a 
long period over two hundred millions of Catholics in directing the governments 
and destinies of nations.” (See Appendix D.) 
One other fact demands our attention. as of first-class importance in the 
discussion, and that is the fact incontestably established by.statistics both in 
America and Europe, that the Roman schools produce a large excess of 
crime and pauperism, as well as of illiteracy, over Protestant schools; and a 
partial recognition of this fact by Roman Catholic papers may be found in 
Appendix E. 
If any reasons were necessary to justify our intelligent Roman Catholic 
citizens in their preferences for our public schools and their refusal to sur- 
render them, they would be afforded by such statistics; and in addition to 
the considerations which forbid us as a nation to surrender the integrity of 
our common schools, it is our duty to protect our adopted citizens against 
every attempt to infringe their liberties by threats, temporal and spiritual,
-P-A-G-E-170

  which are properly held to be undue influence. It is our duty to protect 
the children of these naturalized Roman Catholic citizens who have re- 
nounced allegiance to every foreign prince and potentate, and who have 
sworn allegiance to the United States, in their constitutional right to enjoy 
freely and without restraint the advantages of our public schools; and it 
should not be forgotten that the right to protection of a naturalized citizen 
against unlawful interference by a foreign government is an acknowledged 
principle of American law. 
The interesting considerations suggested by the proposition of the adoption 
by Americans of the parochial school have also a direct bearing on the ques- 
tion now before the American people, how far the proposed Roman university 
at Washington, in which the Jesuits at Rome are reported to be greatly in- 
terested, will tend by its teachings to strengthen the family relation as it 
now exists, to maintain the dignity and independence of the States, the civil 
and religious freedom of the people, and the unity, peace and harmony of 
the Republic. 
APPENDIX A. 
THE COMMON LAW OF AMERICA, AND THE CHRISTIANITY WHICH IS A 
PART OF IT. 
The common law of England, which Coke held to be of greater antiquity 
than any other human law, based upon the laws and customs from the times 
of the Roman, Saxon, Danish and Norman .conquests, and embodying the 
great principle defined in the Magna Charta of John which was anathema- 
tized by Pope Innocent ITI, in the Petition of Rights in the time of Charles I, 
in the Habeas Corpus in the reign of Charles II, in the Bill of Rights under 
William and Mary, and the Act of Settlement under William III—of this 
common law Kent said:* “It is the common jurisprudence of the United 
States, and was brought with them as colonists from England and estab- 
lished here.” 
Chief Justice Shea says of this great fact in our history:} “The original 
thirteen States inherit and continue in legal succession and amplitude of 
jurisprudence the common law; and as to the courts of the national govern- 
ment, their limitations concern subjects of jurisdiction, and not the applica- 
bility within that jurisdiction of the rules of thé common law.” 
“There has never been a period,” said Mr. Justice Story,} “in which the 
common law did not recognize Christianity as lying at its foundation. It 
repudiates every act done-in violation of its duties of perfect obligation.

It pronounces illegal every contract offensive to its morals.” _And after a 
further enumeration, Story added: 
“The error of our government, it has been asserted, is in reality of a different 
character; it tolerated nothing but Christianity.” 
Chief Justice Shea, in quoting these words of Story, said: 
“Story might have added to this enumeration, that laws in the spirit of our con- 
stitution prohibit, under penalties, the name of God being blasphemously uttered; 
and will not allow the worship of God to be wantonly and openly reviled to the an- 
noyance of believers and bad example to the public. The sanctity of the Lord’s 
day is acknowledged, and contracts made on that day invalidated. The conscience 
of each public servant is bound by ‘that adamantine chain, an-oath,’ to the throne 
of God; in the legislature, in the judicial, in the executive departments, . 
from the President of the United States, from the Chief Justice of the United 
States, from the senators down to the humblest officer in the nation, state, munici- 
pality, and village. The constitution expresses, in these visible signs, the substantial 
idea; it shows the reality of its Christian character; and it finally and affirmatively 
declares, in express terms, that the enactments which compose the constitution were 
‘done . . . in the year of our Lord, 1787.’ It was the deliberate issue of religious 
traditions, circumstances, convictions, and acknowledgments.” 
What the Christianity was and is, whic! in the sense declared by the 
courts is a part of our common law, the judges have amply explained. As 
Kent decided, it is “Christianity in its enlarged sense as a religion revealed 
and taught in the Bible.’ As Mr. Justice Story declared, “Its divine 
origin and truth are admitted.” It is as defined by the Supreme Court of 
Pennsylvania, “ Not Christianity founded on any particular religious tenets, 
not Christianity with an established church and titles and spiritual courts, 
but Christianity with liberty of conscience to all men.” 
It is the Christianity which Daniel Webster portrayed when he said :* 
““There is nothing that we look for with more certainty than the general principle 
that Christianity is part of thelawoftheland. . . . The dead prove itas well as the 
living. The generations that have gone before speak it, and pronounce it from the 
tomb. We feel it. All, all proclaim that Christianity, general, tolerant Christianity, 
Christianity independent of sects and parties, that Christianity to which the sword 
and fagot are unknown, general, tolerant Christianity, is the law of the land.”

THE SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE ORDAINED BY THE FIRST 
AMENDMENT TO THE NATIONAL CONSTITUTION. 
Recurring to the adoption of the national constitution, the celebration of 
whose centennial has so vividly recalled the men and the principles of that 
day as presenting an example for Americans for all time, we find this fact 
interesting and significant in its bearings on the pending question of popu- 
lar education. The ethics of Christianity as the religion of the people, the 
right of all to religious freedom, and the complete separation of church and

state, were regarded as axioms of American thought, so essential, as they 
were reminded by history and by their family traditions, to liberty of con- 
science and to the natural rights of man, that it does not seem to have 
occurred to the Constitutional Convention, amid the serious questions as to 
the new government they were to establish, that it was necessary to forbid 
Congress to intermeddle with religion. But when the new constitution came 
before the States for their ratification, the omission of a bill of rights was at 
once remarked by the people in their broad discussion of the protection of 
their liberties under the national government; and the State of New York, 
among the last to adopt the constitution, did so “in full confidence” that 
such amendments would be adopted. The first Congress, which met at New 
York in 1789, adopted a bill of rights in their amendment to the constitu- 
tion, which was afterwards confirmed by the States, and the first clause of 
the first amendment declared: 
“Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohib- 
iting the free exercise thereof.” is 
Of this clause it has been said by Dr. William R. Huntington, that “in 
this short sentence lies wrapped the secret of our national destiny;” and 
this suggests a reference to a more recent incident in history, which has a 
profound significance as indicating the continued devotion of the American 
people to this great distinguishing feature of the Republic which they are 
again being called to protect by a further amendment as essential to its 
peace and harmony, imposing upon the States the same restriction which 
they had imposed on Congress. 
The changes brought by a century from the Declaration of Independence, 
and especially the wave of immigration which followed the abolition of slavery 
and the more firm establishment of the Union, developed a new danger to 
religious freedom and to the American character of our common schools with 
Christian ethics untainted by denominational dogmas, from the possible 
action of some of the States where the foreign element, uninstructed in 
American civilization, might temporarily prevail. To this point the atten- 
tion of our intelligent and patriotic citizens was directed, and led to the at- 
tempt so nearly successful in the year 1876, for the adoption by Congress of 
the constitutional amendment recommended by President Grant, and pre- 
sented in the House by Hon. James G. Blaine, on the 14th day of December, 
1875. The amendment was as follows: 
“No State shall make any law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohib- 
- iting the free exercise thereof; and no money raised by schoo! taxation in any State, 
for the support of public schools, or derived from any public fund therefor, nor any 
public lands devoted thereto, shall ever be under the control of any religious sect; 
nor shall any money be raised, or land so devoted, be divided between religious sects 
or denominations.” 
On the adjournment of Congress it became the subject of popular discus- 
sion, and the two national parties expressed their views upon the principles it
-P-A-G-E-173
  PUBLIC AND PAROCHIAL SCHOOLS. 173 
involved. The Republican National Convention, on the 15th a June, 1876, 
at Cincinnati, declared: 
“The public-school system of, the several States is the bulwark of the American 
Republic, and, with a view to its security and permanence, we recommend an amend- 
ment to the constitution of the United States, forbidding the application of any 
public funds or property for the benefit of any schools or institutions under secta- 
rian control.” 
The Democratic national platform, adopted at St. Louis, Hn 28, 1876, 
declared : 
“We do here affirm . . . our faith in the total separation of church and state, 
for the sake alike of civil and religious freedom.” 
And the platform then alluded to — 
“the public schools, of which the establishment and support belong exclusively 
to the several States, and which the Democratic party has cherished from their fuun- 
dation, and is resolvedto maintain without prejudice or preference for any class, sect, 
or creed, and without largesses from the treasury to any.” 
These platforms show that both of’ the national parties distinctly approved 
in their national conventions of the principle of the amendment; and the 
Republican party recommended its adoption, and the Democratic party de- 
clared for a total separation of church and state, and the maintenance of the 
public schools by the States without prejudice or preference for any class, 
sect, or creed, and without largess from the treasury to any. When the 
amendment came up for action in the House, a clause was added by the 
judiciary committee touching the power of Congress, and the House, 4th of 
August, 1876, passed the whole by the extraordinary vote of 180 to 7 
In the Senate it was further amended by the judiciary committee, and 
defeated by a vote of 28 to 16, wanting a majority of two-thirds. It was 
stated in the Senate by Senator Blair, as a matter of history, on the 15th 
of February, 1888, that the defeat of this amendment was brought about 
by the Jesuits. 
The overwhelming vote in the House, as well as the vote of a majority of 
the Senators, including among the distinguished names those of Roscoe 
Conkling, Geo. F. Edmunds, John A. Logan, Frederick Frelinghuysen, 
Justin S. Morrill, and Oliver P. Morton, in addition to the decided pledges 
of both parties, show the deep conviction of the American people that such 
an amendment should be passed, and the rapid increase of our foreign pop- 
ulation since that period, bringing political views and habits and methods 
utterly at variance with American ideas and incompatible with the Ameri- 
can principle of American government and civilization, is giving day by day 
new warning of the necessity of immediate action in embodying the prin- 
ciple of the Grant and Blaine amendment in the national constitution. It 
is again pending before Congress.

APPENDIX C. 
ROMAN CATHOLIC TESTIMONY BEARING ON PAROCHIAL EDUCATION. 
  The subject of parochial education is closely and inevitably connected 
with the political aims of the Roman court in America, and the character 
of her policy and her methods are matters so essential to be fitly under- 
stood by Americans at this time that an American in stating and discussing 
these, may perhaps naturally enough be supposed to be influenced by preju- 
dice, and to err however unconsciously in his facts or his conclusions. — It 
seems, therefore, the safest and fairest plan in this discussion to quote with 
but slight comment the statements and opinions of eminent American Ro- 
man Catholics whose characters, and abilities, and devotion to the Roman 
church give to their testimony the highest authority. The first is Dr. Brown- 
son whose exactness in statement, and the soundness of whose judgment are 
widely recognized. Dr. Brownson says in his Review :* 
“We often boast of the progress of our religion in this country, but we deceive 
ourselves; . . . what we call her progress is, only the augmentations of the for- 
. eign colony. Catholic missions to the American people have not yet been opened. 
The missions in this country are to the foreign colony of Catholics settled here. No 
doubt a few converts are made, but the number all told we should judge not a tithe 
of the . . . of Catholics that take place; . . . so that in reality, our Catho- 
lic progress consists not in Catholicizing but in foreignizing the country. 
We need the Catholicism but not the foreignism, for that foreignism which Catholics 
bring with them, and perpetuate in their foreign colony, is un-Catholic and antago- 
nistic to the American idea, and has done more injury to our American advance of 
civilization than their Catholicity has done to aid it.” 
Referring to our civil war, Dr. Brownson said: “To their shame be it 
said, the old American Catholics in this struggle of the nation for life have 
proved themselves far less American, far less loyal, than the foreign-born 
Catholics settled among us.” 
In a paper on “ Protestantism and Infidelity,” (April 6, 1862,) Dr. Brown- 
son‘said: 
“The worst governed cities in the Union are precisely those in which Catholics 
are the most influential in elections and have the most to do with municipal affairs. 
We furnish more than our share of the rowdies, the drunkards, and the vicious pop- 
ulation of our large cities. The majority of grog-sellers in the city of New York 
are Catholics, and the portion of the city where grog-selling, drunkenness and filth 
most abound are those chiefly inhabited by Catholics; and we scarcely see the slight- 
est effort made for a reformation.” 
As bearing upon the religious instruction on which so much stress is laid 
as being taught in the parochial schools, Dr. Brownson says: 
“We have found people whose ancestors for fourteen hundred years have been 
Catholics, who have yet to be taught the simplest principles and precepts of Chris- 
tian morality, and who scarcely have any conception of duty except going to con- 
‘fession and receiving holy communion. We have found those who seemed to think

-P-A-G-E-175
  PUBLIC AND PAROCHIAL SCHOOLS. 175 
if they escape the censure of the priests, they need give themselves no further 
trouble. . . . Yet, in moral culture, and by moral intelligence, the Catholic pop- 
ulation are below the better class of non-Catholics.” 
“We want the living church of Christ, not the dry bones of the medieval church. 
‘Why seek ye the Lord among the dead? Know ye not that He is risen, and dies 
no more?’ We believe that there is amongst us an unwise and hurtful resistance 
to modern civilization, to modern liberty, to the freedom and activity of the mind. 
Are not her most zealous and influential members everywhere arrayed against the 
onward progress of modern civilization, and doing all in their power to arrest it? 
Do they not do their . . to repress every movement of humanity, and brand her 
irrepressible instincts as anti-Christian and satanic?” 
Dr. Brownson’s sound advice has been equally disregarded, and here in 
America, where loyal people resented every public expression of sympathy 
with the slave power during our civil war, politicians of both parties are 
being tempted to secure Irish votes by intermeddling with the national 
politics of Great Britain. Dr. Brownson said: 
“No naturalized Irishman has any right to continue after naturalization to re- 
gard Ireland his country, or himself as free to labor for her especial interest as his 
own country. No doubt he may retain his affection for the land of his birth, and 
feel an interest in her prosperity he feels in no other; but he has no right or obliga- 
tion.to her that any other American citizen has not.”— (April, 1862.) 
Alluding to the fact that “the Roman to-day holds that the temporal 
government of the world belongs to his city,” Dr. Brownson said: 
“Even Americans trained to the priesthood in the Roman colleges imbibe a half 
conviction that the spiritual _primacy and the temporal in some sense belong to 
. Rome, and look upon trans-Alpine states, especially of the north, as barbarians 
whom Rome has not yet civilized. With them, of European nations Italy stands 
first, France second, Spain third, Great Britain fourth, and Germany last, notwith- 
standing Catholic Germany is almost the only part ‘of the Catholic world where 
Catholic thought is really living and active—where Catholic erudition, science and 
philosophy are up to the level of the non-Christian world. . . . Germany was 
converted to the church, but never was and never will be converted to Rome.— 
(April, 1862.) 
Of Roman intermeddling in our civil government so conspicuously shown 
by the letter of Pope Pius IX to Jefferson Davis as “the illustrious and 
honorable President of the Confederate States of America,” on the 3d of 
December, 1863, which assumed that the Republic was dissolved, and alluded 
to “the other people of America and their rulers.” 
Dr. Brownson refers to an earlier proof of papal intervention “in a letter 
from a distinguished French gentlemen, a friend of the President’s corre- 
spondent, praying us not to insist on immediate emancipation, and assuring 
us that he did so in consequence of an interview with the Archbishop of 
New York.” 
Of the Jesuits, to whom Father Hecker attributes the adoption of the 
dogma of infallibility, Dr. Brownson’s unflattering opinion seems to recall 
the solemn judgment of Pope Clement XIV. He says:
-P-A-G-E-176
176 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
“We regard their system as the weakest and the least philosophical of all the sys- 
tems of Catholic theology that have been emitted. . . . Under the influence of 
the society, as we believe, theology has become a dead science, and the Catholic 
world has shrunk to very narrow dimensions which are daily becoming narrower; 
while under the influence of the profounder and more comprehensive theology of 
earlier times, the clergy conquered the world and led the human race.” 
Again he said, and the thought has its deep significance in connection 
with the question of parochial schools, the elementary education of the 
American people: 
“No small amount of the bigotry and sectarianism we complain of are of our 
creation. We live, speak, write and act as if we were ourselves a sect relegated to 
some by-corner of the land, taking no interest in the affairs of the nation or civil- 
ized society any further than our special denominational interests are affected.” 
(October, 1862, page 548.) 
  ROMAN ASCENDENCY IN AMERICA—HOW IT IS TO BE ACCOMPLISHED, AND 
WHAT IT WOULD MEAN. 
A paper entitled “The Catholics of the Nineteenth Century,” published 
in the Catholic World, (Vol. XI, No. 64, July, 1870, New York Publication 
Society,) gives an interesting sketch of the means by which the ascendency 
is expected to be accomplished, and the changes it would bring. It says on 
the first point: 
“An offer and promise are as distinctly made to the Catholics of this age as they 
were to the chosen people when released from Egyptian bondage. A land of promise, 
a land flowing with milk and honey is spread out before them, and offered for their 
acceptance. 
“The means placed at their disposal for securing this rich possession are not the 
sword or war of extermination waged against the enemies of their religion, but instead 
the mild and peaceful infiuence of the ballot, directed by instructed Catholic conscience 
and enlightened Catholic intelligence. . . . He has been furnished with an om- 
nipotent weapon with which to accomplish this great work, and he is provided with 
an unerring guide to direct him to the administration of this important trust. We 
do not hesitate to affirm that in performing our duties as citizens, electors and pub- 
lie officers, we should always and under all circumstances act simply.as Catholics. 
That we should be governed by the immutable principles of our religion, and should 
take dogmatic faith and the conclusions drawn from it as expressed and defined in 
Catholic philosophy, theology, and morality, as the only rule of our private, public, 
and official conduct. . . . The finger of the Pope, like the needle of the compass, 
always points to the pole of eternal truth. . . . The will of God is expressed as 
plainly through the church as it was through Moses and the tables of the law. 
The supremacy asserted for the church in matters of education implies the 
additional and cognate function of the censorship of ideas, and the right to examine 
and approve or disapprove all books, publications, writings and utterances intended 
for public instruction, enlightenment, or entertainment, and the supervision of places 
of amusement. This is the principle upon which the church has acted in handing 
over to the civil authorities for punishment criminals in the world of ideas.”

APPENDIX D. 
HECKER ON THE SACRIFICE OF CHRISTIAN MANHOOD, AND THE CONSE- 
QUENT DECAY OF ROMAN CATHOLIC NATIONS. 
Father Hecker in his last volume (“The Church and the Age, an Expo- 
sition of the Catholic Church in view of the needs and aspirations of the 
present age” )* said: 
“Countries in which Catholics outnumber all other Christians put together, as 
France, Austria, Italy, Spain, Bavaria, Baden, South America, Brazil, and until re- 
cently, Belgium, are for the most part controlled and governed by hostile minorities, 
and in some instances the minority is very small. 
“Her adversaries with the finger of derision point out these facts and proclaim 
them to.the world. Look, they say, at Poland, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, Bavaria, 
Austria, Italy, France, and what do you see? Countries subjected and enervated, or 
agitated by the internal throes of revolution. Everywhere among Catholic nations 
weakness only, and incapacity are to be discerned. This is the result of the priestly 
domination and hierarchical influence of Rome.” 
Father Hecker, after speaking of the bitter agony suffered in secret, of 
the doubts, and fears, and hopes, and of faith already lost, asks: 
“What, then, has brought about this most deplorable state of things? How can 
we account for this apparent lack of faith and strength on the part of Catholics? 
Can it be true, as their enemies assert, that Catholicity, wherever it has full sway, 
deteriorates society? Or is it contrary to the spirit of Christianity that Christians 
should strive with all their might to overcome evil in this world? Perhaps the Cath- 
olic Church has grown old, others imagine, and has accomplished her task, and is no 
longer competent to unite together the conflicting interests of modern society and 
direct it toward its true destination.” 
In his search for the true answer, he seeks the “remote cause of present 
difficulties” in the councils of Nice and Trent, and in the errors of Protest- 
antism, making it clear that “to overthrow the papacy, was to conquer the 
church,” (page 11,) and the fact that “in this pressing necessity of defend- 
ing the papal authority of the church, the Society of St. Ignatius was born.” 
—(Page 13.) 
“Men whose wills should never conflict with the authority of the church, perinde 
cadaver. The distinguishing traits of a perfect Jesuit form the antithesis of a 
thorough Protestant.”— (Page 13.) 
Then comes the interesting remark: 
“The logical outcome of the existence of the society [of Jesuits] founded by St. 
Ignatius of Loyola, was the dogmatic recognition of papal infallibility.”— (Page 15.) 
And next, his explanation of the cause and his acknowledgment of the 
effect of the Jesuit doctrines: 
“The weight of authority was placed on the side of restraining rather than that 
of developing personal, independent action. 
“The exaggeration of personal authority on the part of Protestants brought 
about in the church its greater restraint, in order that her divine authority might

have its legitimate exercise and exert its salutary influence. The errors and evils 
of the times sprang from an unbridled personal independence, which could only be 
counteracted by habits of increased personal dependence. Contraria contrariis 
curantur. The defense of the church and the salvation of the soul were ordinarily 
secured at the expense necessarily of those virtues which go to make up the strength 
of Christian manhood. 
“In the principles above briefly stated may, in a great measure, be found the 
explanation why fifty millions of Protestants have had generally a controlling in- 
fiuence for a long period over two hundred millions of Catholics, in directing the 
movements and destinies of nations.” 
We can scarcely wonder that the Italians who compose the Council of the 
‘Vatican and those who are commissioned to execute their orders in our Re- 
public should so cordially dislike and fear our common-school systém when 
they see the extent to which its early training is recognizable in the common 
sense and truthful admissions which, despite all subsequent and ultramontane 
education, occasionally mark the utterances of American Roman Catholics. 
It must also be a source of profound satisfaction to the old-fashioned Cath- 
olics of America who cherish American principles and who have held with 
that illustrious prelate Pope Clement XIV, in his condemnation as scan- 
dalous of the doctrines and methods of the Jesuits, to find that such great 
authorities in the American church as Brownson and Hecker have given 
new strength to the grave reasoning on which that venerable pontiff con- 
demned and dissolved the order forever and forever; and have afforded new 
reasons why Americans should shun the counsels of those whose advice has 
brought to grief, as Father Hecker reminds us, so many of the nations of 
the old and new world by a system of training which limits the exercise of 
the moral powers to commanding and obeying, and necessarily sacrifices 
“those virtues which properly go to make up the strength of Christian man- 
hood,” and which have enabled fifty millions of Protestants to exercise a 
controlling influence over four times the number educated under Romanist 
methods. 
  APPENDIX E, 
ROMAN CATHOLIC ACKNOWLEDGMENTS OF AN EXCESS OF CRIME FROM 
PAROCHIAL EDUCATION. 
Of Canada, the Toronto Mail says (November 13, 1886): 
“Of the common people not one in twelve can read the simplest sentence, and 
the bulk of them know little or nothing beyond the duties imposed by the church.” 
The Catholic Times of April 17, 1885, said: “The criminal returns of 
Her Majesty’s prison at Liverpool for the year ending March 31, 1885, 
discloses a state of things which the Catholic public cannot contemplate 
without feelings of sadness and humiliation,” and after giving a series of sta- 
tistics, the Catholic Times added: “Thus our people, though forming less 
than one-third of the population of Liverpool, constitute nearly one-half of 
the total number of prisoners.”
-P-A-G-E-179
  PUBLIC AND PAROCHIAL SCHOOLS. 179 
In Scotland, where the Roman Catholics in 1871 amounted to one-twelfth 
of the population, it was stated by Mr. Cross, Home Secretary, on the 23d 
of July, 1877, that “about one-third of all the prisoners in Scotland were 
Roman Catholics.” : : 
Some of the Roman opponents of our common schools have declared them 
schools of immorality, and Father Miiller intimated that in our cities loose 
girls frequented the public schools that they might the more readily ply 
their vocation. 
On the other hand Father Nugent, the Roman Catholic chaplain of the 
prison at Liverpool, alluding to the morality prevailing in that city said, as 
reported in the Catholic Times, November 12, 1886: “Nine out of ten of 
the girls to be seen at night along the London Road, a Line street, were 
Catholics; there was no use hiding it.” 
From Australasia comes the same story of disproportionate crime. As 
recorded in the Parliamentary report for 1885 three-tenths of Roman Cath- 
olics contribute as many criminals as seven-tenths of Protestants. 
The Tablet, a Roman Catholic paper of high authority, so recently as 
November, 1888, published an article in leader type, in which the writer 
says: 
“T was astonished to find, when engaged in another matter, that the percentage 
of juvenile criminals of Catholic parentage was out of all proportion in England to 
the relative Catholic population. Upon looking into the matter, I found that we 
Catholics contribute more young criminals than any other religious denomination.” 
And then comes from the writer of the Tablet, as suggested ‘by such sta- 
tistics, these remarks: 
“The stock excuse among our people for painful disclosures in the morning 
papers is, that we Catholics are such a poor body, quite unable to carry the offices 
of religion and charity to the extent of many Protestant denominations. But is 
this so? Are we poorer as a whole body than the Baptists, or Primitive Meth- 
odists? No! we can show a considerably larger proportion of wealth, ability 
and leisure—we are as numerous as the two bodies together. Yet their control of 
their poorer population is more complete, socially as well as morally, than our own.”

THE LEGAL STATUS OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 
ANDREW S. DRAPER, ALBANY, NEW YORK. 
First, let us note the exact phraseology of the subject we are to consider. 
It is “The Legal Status of the Public Schools.” The term “public schools” 
has a special and technical meaning with us. It designates schools sup- 
ported by general taxation, managed by public officers, taught by teachers 
having legal authority; institutions in which all the people have entire 
equality of responsibility and of right. We are to consider the constitu- 
tional, the statutory, and the common-law relations which these institutions 
sustain to our system of government, to our civil organization in its various 
departments, and to citizenship in the country. 
The American public school is a unique institution. It is true that some 
of its characteristics are from time to time being copied in other countries. 
The common schools of France and Germany have recently been made free. 
But the distinguishing features of our public schools do not, and in the 
nature of things cannot, obtain in other lands without revolutionary changes 
in their systems of government. The common schools of America have 
been of gradual growth, and have come to their present state only in recent 
years. That state has been evolved out of the intelligence and the experi- 
ence of our people, as well as out of the necessities of our plan of govern- 
ment. We tax all people and all property for the support of our schools, 
and we take the management of the schools into the public hands for the 
protection of property and the safety of the Government. 
Civil liberty and self-government are dependent upon the strength and 
successful operation of certain guaranties of rights and checks upon power 
which the text-writers call “institutions.” Each of these institutions has 
an autonomy of its own—an individuality and a completeness by itself. 
Taken separately, these institutions will not avail much to promote the 
public weal; but taken collectively, acting as a system, they will support 
the temple of liberty. The more of them there are, the more firmly will 
they support it. Institutions spring from conscience and intelligence, and 
are the result of years, frequently of centuries, of growth and development. 
The more substantial they become—that is, the more strongly rooted in 
the intelligence and conscience of the people—the greater and the more 
enduring will the liberty be. 
When Government comes to exercise its powers in the maintenance and 
management of a system of general education; when it taxes all the people 
for the support of schools and guarantees one within practicable walking 
distance of every home, that system rises to the importance and dignity
-P-A-G-E-181
  Se “LEGAL STATUS OF PUBLIO SCHOOLS. 
  
of a governmental institution, and receives recognition as such, and such 
recognition brings with it the support, the restraint, the regulation and 
direction of the law of the land. 
Institutions do not ordinarily owe their existence to any express law, but 
arise spontaneously out of existing conditions and circumstances. In time 
self-grown usage and positive legislation mingle with each other in deter- 
mining their character and the scope and nature of their work and influ- 
ence. So it has been with our public schools. In the beginning the schools 
were purely private enterprises for gain, or were supported by charity, either 
private or public. As the population has advanced and become more and 
more heterogeneous in character, the necessity of governmental support and 
_ supervision has become more and more manifest, until, by a gradual process, 
they have reached their present status. That status is fixed and defined by 
a body of laws, arising out of common custom and long usage, written in 
the constitutions and statutes of the country, construed and declared by the 
determinations of authorized courts and officers. 
We inherited and brought away with us the common law of the mother 
country at the time we separated and set up a new sovereignty, but there 
was no portion of that law relating to our public schools, unless incidentally 
or collaterally, for neither there nor here had there been, up to that time, 
any public schools in the sense in which we use the term. 
From the time when the importance of governmental support and super- 
vision of education first began to attract public attention and discussion, it 
seems to have been the policy of the country to submit the matter to the 
charge of the several States. 
No mention is made of the subject in the Federal constitution. The pro- 
ceedings of the convention which framed that instrument reveal but a bare 
mention of it. On the 29th of May, Mr. Charles Pinckney, of South Caro- 
lina, submitted for consideration a draft of a constitution for the General 
Government. The sixth article of such draft provided that “The legisla- 
ture of the United States shall have power . . . to establish and pro- 
vide for a national university at the seat of government of the United 
States.” The entire paper was referred to a committee of strong and emi- 
nent ability. The report of the committee contained no mention of the 
proposition for a national university. The proposition with some other 
matters was then referred to a second committee, which reported in a few 
days, but made no reference to the matter of a university. Although it is 
true that the public-school idea of our day had no existence at that time, it 
is not possible to think that these foremost men of the nation were not alive 
to the importance of general culture. Indeed, the history of many of them 
clearly reveals their interest in just such institutions as that contemplated 
in the proposition submitted to them, and which, in that connection, they 
declined to approve. The inference therefore is inevitable that, while recog- 
nizing its importance, it was their deliberate and substantially unanimous 
12—n. E. A.  
-P-A-G-E-182
182 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  
  judgment that that was not the place to discuss the subject, as the Federal 
constitution was not the place to make provision for it. In the accumulat- 
ing and deepening interest attaching to the subject in succeeding years, 
there has been no serious effort to modify that conclusion. 
It naturally follows that the schools or their concerns have not been in 
issue in the Federal courts to any extent, and then only collaterally. The 
only determinations of interest by the United States courts, as fixing the 
status of the public schools, are those construing the fourteenth amendment 
to the constitution, known as the civil-rights clause. These decisions ex- 
pressly recognize and declare the right and duty of the States to provide 
for and manage schools, but hold that the Federal authority will intervene 
to insure equal advantages to both races. In one case it is held that the 
two races may be provided for in separate schools, the classification being 
left to State authority, so long as schools are provided for colored children 
equally as good as those provided for whites. (Bertonneau vs. Directors, 
ete., 3 Woods, 177.) 
In another case a United States court enjoined and forbade the payment 
to a school used exclusively for white children of such portion of the State 
school moneys as was apportioned upon the basis of colored children of 
school age residing in the district. (Claybrook vs. Owenboro, 28 Fed. Rep., 
634.) 
Again, where a city levied a tax for school purposes, but provided that 
money collected from whites should be used only for white children’s schools, 
and money collected from colored persons, only for schools for colored chil- 
dren, the result of which was to afford enlarged facilities for one class as 
against the other, it was held that the arrangement was in violation of the 
fourteenth amendment, and unconstitutional. Taxation must be equitable, 
and facilities equal. (Claybrook vs. Owenboro, 16 Fed. Rep., 297.) 
But only in the enforcement of the civil-rights clause of the constitution, 
and then only incidentally and for the same reason that they would look 
into the acts of common carriers, places of amusement or of entertainment, 
or any other interest in which all inhabitants have common rights and by 
express provision of the Federal constitution are entitled “to the equal pro- 
tection of the laws,” do the United States courts take any cognizance of the 
management of the public schools. 
Upon the several States does our governmental policy devolve the duty 
of supporting and supervising common schools. Prior to the adoption of 
the Federal constitution of 1789, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Pennsyl- 
vania, North Carolina and Georgia had sufficiently appreciated the duty of 
the State, to foster and supervise educational interests, to solemnly provide 
for it in their several constitutions. No one of the original States but had 
recognized this principle in legislation, and all which had not previously 
done so have since put it into their constitutions. 
As the new States have been admitted to the Union, they too have, I
-P-A-G-E-183

  think without exception, written this sacred guaranty in their constitutions 
that it might be neither ignored nor abridged, except through the deliberate 
and cumbersome process of amending the organic law. 
As the duty of the States to promote education is declared in their con- 
stitutions, so the manner in which they severally perform that duty is found 
in their statute laws and in the decisions of their courts and officers. Even 
a casual study of these brings out in the most interesting way the different 
stages in the development of our free public schools. By a gradual process 
of change the tuition fees have been abolished; the idea of charity to such 
as were unable to pay tuition has been discarded; the highest power of the 
state has been exercised to raise taxes for free schools; the tax levy has 
been increased from time to time in order to provide still larger accommo- 
dations and still better equipment; and permanent funds have been estab- 
lished and added to in order to protect against any possible emergency. On 
the other hand, the supervision of the state has gradually become closer 
and closer. It is destined to become much more so. The schools have been 
related to each other under county or district supervisory officers, and the 
whole body in the state has been brought under the general supervision of 
state superintendents or boards. Although much more needs to be done 
toward making a more perfect system, it is none the less true that much 
care has been taken to see that public-school accommodations are within a 
reasonable distance of every home, and of a character suited to the cireum- 
stances and needs of all the people. The state determines the character and 
the powers of the boards of education in the cities, as it does the number 
and size of the districts in the county. It controls the character of the 
buildings; it says who may teach, and what shall be taught. It says who 
may attend, and it frequently, also, says who shall attend. It collects 
statistics for the guidance of its lawmakers, to the end that the whole sys- 
tem may be so directed as to produce the best results for its whole people. 
It does not leave the matter to the uncertain care of local communities. 
By a wise policy of local administration, in full accord with our American 
self-governing way of doing public business, it leaves certain matters to the 
qualified electors, or officers chosen by them, in each city or district; and 
thus it educates the people to self-government, and ordinarily produces 
schools best suited to the needs of each locality. But it leaves no more of 
this power to each locality than experience shows it may with safety and 
not hazard its general policy to maintain a school in character with its gen- 
eral system, free and accessible to all its people. It encourages each locality 
to raise local moneys for school purposes, but through state school funds it 
makes sure that schools of its own creation, and subject to its own manage- 
ment, shall dot the face of its entire territory, whether they are enlarged 
and improved. by additional local taxation, or not. 
To a clear understanding of the legal status of the public schools, I deem 
it important that it be expressly declared, that while they are not national,  
-P-A-G-E-184
  184 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
neither are they local institutions; rather they are state institutions, main- 
tained and controlled by the state, that they may contribute to its greatness 
and the happiness of its people. This is unquestionably the law. 
It is not only enunciated in a general policy which has obtained in every 
commonwealth and found illustration in thousands of acts, but it is expressly 
declared in the laws, in the debates and acts of the lawmakers, and in the 
decisions of the courts. Permit me to instance one or two such acts and 
decisions. Some years ago the writer had occasion to give the subject special 
examination. The constitution of the State of New York provides that no 
person shall be eligible to the Legislature who is “an officer under a city 
government.” Being elected a member of the Legislature while serving as 
a member of the board of education of the city of Albany, his seat was 
contested on the ground that he was not eligible because of the constitutional 
provision referred to. Although the charter of the city of Albany enu- 
merated members of the board of education among the city officers, the com- 
mittee on privileges and elections, after the fullest argument by counsel, 
reported unanimously that a member of a board of education of a city was 
in no sense a city officer but was an agent of the State, engaged in carrying 
on the educational system and policy of the State, and therefore not within 
the constitutional limitation; and the report was approved in the House by 
all parties and without a division. 
It has been held in the courts that the trustees of school districts are 
neither city, county, town nor village officers. (People vs. Bennett, 54 
Barb., 480.) 
In an action brought against the city of New York for the acts of an offi- 
cer of the board of education of that city, it was decided in the court of 
last resort, after a stubborn contest, that the city was not liable, as it had 
no control over the board of education, and could not be held liable for the 
acts of any of its officers or agents. (Ham vs. The Mayor, etc., 70 N. Y., 
459.) 
These are not isolated cases; there are many of them. They are not pe- 
culiar to New York; the principle is the same everywhere, and will be found 
enunciated in the judicial decisions of all the States. - 
Then, too, the public schools of each State have become related to each 
other in a common system or organization, maintained, supervised and con- 
trolled by the authority of the State government, pursuant to constitutional 
and statutory provisions, with such additional local help as the people of 
localities will voluntarily extend. They are supported by general taxation, 
andare free to all children within specified ages, and together form one of 
the institutions which guarantee the liberties of a self-governing people. 
The precise legal status of this institution in each State is dependent upon 
the provisions of the several State constitutions and legislative enactments. 
It is, of course, inadmissible in this connection to attempt any examination 
in detail of these different systems of laws. The different States inherited
-P-A-G-E-185
LEGAL STATUS OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 185 
a common jurisprudence. Naturally’enough they have extended it along 
the same general lines. Legislation has been copied. Like conditions beget 
similar legislation, and similar construction and interpretation of the same. 
So the school laws of the newer States have been largely copied on the 
models furnished by the older ones, and the decisions of the older have been 
commonly accepted in the newer. Therefore there are certain principles 
common to the entire country, which may be set forth as fixing and defining 
the legal status of the public schools. Indeed, it may be said that the laws 
concerning the school system of the country have a completeness in them- 
selves, that the system stands upon its own basis, and has an autonomy pe- 
culiar to itself. 
Persons charged by law with the management and supervision of the 
schools have authority to'do allfthings necessary to promote the general 
purpose of the system. Subject to special statutory provisions, which vary 
but little in the main, they may provide buildings, purchase supplies, certify 
and employ teachers, fix the time of sessions, regulate the attendance of 
and classify pupils, determine the course of instruction each pupil must 
pursue, and do whatever else is incidental to the attainment of the general 
object of the institution. The schools do not stand helpless before the de- 
mands of individual parents. Patrons must conform to the system, and not 
expect the system to conform to their individual whims. It must be assumed 
that the school system is more likely to determine rightly the mental devel- 
opment of the child, and is better qualified to say what classes it should 
enter and what studies it should pursue, than the parent. If the particular 
teacher to whom the subject is presented falls into error, the avenue of ap- 
peal to the highest school authority is wide open. The parent who brings 
his child to the public schools must submit him to the arrangement and 
discipline of the school. Attendance of reasonable regularity and proper 
punctuality may be expected, and the child must be free from contagious 
diseases, and in such a state of cleanliness as not to be injurious or obnox- 
ious to other pupils, or he may be debarred from the privileges of the 
-schools. So, too, may a child be refused admission to the schools, who is so 
vicious or morally impure as to be beyond control or likely to corrupt the 
lives of his associates. The thing always to be kept in view is the interest 
and advantage of the great body of pupils who come in condition, physically 
and morally, fit for association with others, or who can be brought to such 
condition without the help of either the board of health or the police. The 
operations of these departments must be upon their own ground. If the 
regulations, written or unwritten, are unreasonable, they may be called in 
question in the appropriate place and overridden. If the school system 
itself requires modification, it may be brought about either by legislation 
or election, as we ordinarily make changes in our public affairs in this 
country. But until modifications are made, the system as it is must be re- 
spected, and its regulations must be observed by all persons seeking its ad- 
vantages, or in any way coming in contact with it. :
-P-A-G-E-186
  186 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  
On the other hand, the school system has responsibility and liability as 
well as authority. It is bound to provide suitable school buildings—that 
is, buildings suited to their uses, and constructed and maintained with refer- 
ence to the health and comfort of pupils. The public cannot assume the 
care of children in its schools without exercising caution in protecting them 
from physical harm. Discipline may be maintained, by force, if need be, 
in places where the better way has not yet been learned. The common law 
of the land has always recognized the right of school authorities to inflict 
corporal punishment, and this rule has not yet been much interfered with 
by statute, although it has to some extent by authorized local regulations. 
But where such punishment is inflicted, it must not be excessive or brutal, 
or it becomes an assault, which may be avenged both by the civil and crim- 
inal law. So school officers are subject to the same general rules of law as 
apply to all official conduct, though it must be admitted that they very 
commonly manifest a deplorable amount of ignorance of the fact. They 
cannot be personally interested in any agreement or understanding to which 
they are officially a party without violating the criminal law. They are 
personally liable for any exercise of authority beyond that conferred upon 
them, as they are also for any loss to their city or district by reason of neg- 
lect of official duty. If this fact causes any surprise, it is only because of 
the extreme leniency with which school officers have been treated. Indeed, 
the legal liability of the public-school system, its officers and teachers, is 
much greater than is generally understood, and must inevitably be still 
greater in the future as the institution settles down into more orderly and 
systematic methods of procedure, when its powers and obligations must 
’ become more thoroughly fixed and more completely enunciated and under- 
stood. 
The public schools stand in precisely the same relation, not only to every 
citizen, but to every inhabitant of the land. What the high seas are to the 
sailor, what the king’s highway is to the landsman, the public schools are 
to every child on the road to knowledge. Equality of obligation in the 
maintenance, and equality of right in the enjoyment, is the legend which 
the law would write across the front of every public school-house. This 
road to learning is the common property of a people differing widely in in- 
telligence, in traditions, in opinions, in morals, in means, in creeds, differing 
even in the power to improve their conditions, and the power to influence 
circumstances about them. But no matter what one’s rank or station, no 
matter whether the president of a railway or the man who watches the 
track, no matter with what church he worships or whether he worships at 
all, no matter whether a Republican or a Democrat, or a Prohibitionist or 
a Greenbacker, or a labor agitator or a mugwump, his legal obligations and 
his legal rights are as fixed and as inviolable in the schools as upon the 
king’s highway. In each case he must help make the road for all; in each 
case he must put nothing in it which will prevent or interfere with another's
-P-A-G-E-187
  
LEGAL STATUS OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 187 
  
use; in each case he must use it in a way consistent with like use by all 
the rest. 
Even more than this. The law forbids anything in connection with the 
public schools which invalidates or abridges any of the rights of citizenship 
or of domicile guaranteed by our other American institutions, Being upon 
contested soil, I deem it better to make a direct rather than a covert refer- 
erence to a disputed question. Moral development must inevitably accom- 
pany intellectual growth in training humanity for good citizenship. Every 
influence of the school-room promotes moral growth. A system which com- 
mands regularity, and punctuality, and cleanliness, and studiousness, and 
obedience, which exacts politeness and generosity towards associates and 
respect for authority, which arouses ambition and inspires courage, which 
exalts the truth and is administered with justice, which rests upon the hearts 
of a Christian people and reaches up into the realms of heaven, can, in its 
beneficent operations, produce nothing less than moral growth and develop- 
ment. The theologians will tell us that there is no sound morality which 
does not rest upon religious truth. It is safer for a layman to admit than 
to dispute it. If they are right, then the school system rests upon a foun- 
dation of religious truth. 
In any event, further than this the public cannot go. The high govern- 
mental power which levies and collects taxes cannot be invoked to promote 
or repress the interest of any section of the population or for any purpose 
less than the highest good of all. If the people will divide into sects and 
creeds—and they always will—then the special interests of each sect must 
be promoted by its own effort and at its own cost. 
If it be asked why this -high power should be invoked to compel the sup- 
port of a public-school system when some sects or denominations object to 
educating their children in common schools, and assert their desire and 
ability to assume the burden of such education, the answer is ready, and it 
is this: Because it is not deemed prudent to leave the support and control 
of the schools to any power short of the government itself. It is not public 
policy to promote class and sect distinctions, but to build up and consolidate 
a homogeneous people. Any division of educational responsibility along 
sectarian lines, or any failure to maintain public schools by the government 
and for all the people, promotes class interests, makes vicious teaching pos- 
sible, endangers entire lack of school facilities in some quarters, leads away 
from our cherished traditions and our confident beliefs. The public school 
is the logical.and necessary sequence of our American plan. It is the essen- 
tial accompaniment of our other institutions. {It is a requisite pillar in our 
governmental temple.) This is the deliberate ‘conclusion of our people as 
declared in words and in the manifest spirit and purpose of our law. 
Permit me briefly to recapitulate. It is an obligation resting upon Gov- 
ernment, as upon individuals, to foster and encourage all good works, of 
which education is by no means the least. But such is not the only rela-

tionship in which the public-school system stands to the Government in this 
country. Its life is dependent upon no such uncertainty as the faithful dis- 
charge of a moral obligation, either by individuals or that aggregation of 
individuals called the Government. It is warp and woof of our govern- 
mental system as much as the franchise, the judiciary, the post-office, the 
militia, or the revenue service. In a legal sense, as well as a moral one, it 
is deemed more important than many of our other institutions, for some of 
them could be dispensed with, while this one is believed vital to the endur- 
ance of a social organization where the “will of the people is’ the law of the 
land.” It rests upon conscience, and is the outcome of experience and fore- 
thought. It has a completeness by itself. It is hedged about by a system 
of laws, already well defined, but continually becoming more complete, har- 
monious, and substantial. These laws impose equal obligations and pledge 
equal privileges. Our plan leaves the maintenance and care of the public 
schools, neither with the general government nor with local settlements, 
but with the several States. The States accept it with common accord. 
They administer it largely through local officers, as all other affairs are 
managed, and they welcome and encourage additional local support, but 
each undertakes to make sure of a suitable free school near every home, 
whether the home is willing to support it or is blessed with children to at- 
tend it or not. The system has all the power requisite to the attainment of 
its general purpose, viz., the permanence of the State through good and in- 
' telligent citizenship. It may draw from the people the means for its sup- 
port, and it may make all lawful regulations conducive to the desired results. 
It has responsibility as well as authority, a moral responsibility, perhaps 
above any other branch of the public service, and a legal accountability no 
less stringent than any other. Supported by all, and free to the use of all, 
there must be nothing about it to which any can object for conscience’s sake, 
and each must use it so as not to interfere with like use by all the rest. 
If the school system would justify the theories upon which it proceeds, 
it must accomplish what it undertakes. The task of supplying free educa- 
tional facilities to a great people is, of itself, a vast undertaking. But it is 
not all that falls, or must soon. fall, upon the authorities of the public 
schools. If not already in the law, and not already assumed, then, at no 
distant day, the work of requiring all persons having the care of children 
to send them to the public schools, or give them equivalent school facilities 
elsewhere, must be taken up. For reasons not necessary here to enumerate, 
but known to all, there seems to be ground for thinking that the difficulties 
confronting the schools may grow more serious in coming years unless met 
with a stronger hand and more vigorous determination. However,the true 
American feels little apprehension. He knows the boundless resources of 
the Republic, the marvelous and spontaneous energy with which our people 
rise to meet new circumstances and to circumvent new emergencies. If the 
school authorities will but appreciate the responsibility of their position,
-P-A-G-E-189

will but understand the purpose and functions and powers of the school 
system, and will but go forward moderately, wisely, firmly, courageously, 
progressively, doing what needs to be done, asking for what may be neces- 
sary in a business-like way, repelling opposition whether manifested by open 
assault or underground process, perfecting a system which shall be simple 
in its plan, definite in its action, and sure in its results, they may be assured 
that the common-school system so reaches down and entwines itself about 
the heart-strings of the American nation, that it will respond overwhelm- 
ingly to any proper call upon its resources and its energy, to the end that 
the result shall be an educated, a homogeneous, a liberty-loving, a self- 
governing people, whose flag shall be respected around the world. 
A NATIONAL UNIVERSITY. 
  
WILLIAM A. MOWRY, BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS. 
Education in the United States has experienced within the last century 
a rapid growth and a remarkable development. Many circumstances have 
been favorable, and many unfavorable. The early settlers of this country 
from Europe were generally of hardy and vigorous races, intelligent, ambi- 
tious, many of them possessing high attainments and strong character. Sev- 
eral of the English colonies early manifested a broad interest in learning, 
with rare good judgment appreciating the fact that a new country especially 
must depend greatly for its success upon the intelligence of the masses and 
the higher education of the learned professions. The public-school system 
of New England dates back almost to the beginning of the several settle- 
ments. The Boston Latin School was founded in 1635, Harvard College 
in 1636, and a tax was laid by the town of Dorchester for the support of a 
publie school in 1639. Jefferson’s plan, which he advocated at an early 
day, was that the state should take the control of the higher and secondary 
education, while the elementary education should be carried on by local taxa- 
tion and private philanthropy. The general public-school system, supported 
by tax upon the inhabitants of the state and the towns, gained a strong 
foothold quite early in the history of the eastern and northwestern States. 
Since the reconstruction of the southern States, after the close of the late - 
war, every one of these States has established and put in operation a system 
of public schools. We have therefore to-day a well-established system of 
public instruction for the masses of children, which furnishes a good ele- 
mentary education, in every State and Territory of this country, except 
Alaska—and there the system in a modified form has lately been put in 
operation by the President. The general diffusion of the elements of learn-  
-P-A-G-E-190

  ing among all the people is the pride and boast of this Republic. In our 
political system we have reached so near to universal suffrage, that it has 
been easily apparent to all that the stability of the state absolutely demands 
the general intelligence of all the people. The large number of newspa- 
pers, especially the dailies, the immense circulation of the great magazines 
and other periodicals, together with an unprecedented quantity of books 
issued from the American press, especially within a few years past, are sig- 
nificantly indicative of the strong fact that we are emphatically a reading 
people. There is possibly no other nation to-day where the elements of an 
education are so generally diffused, or where all classes of the people do so 
much general reading. 
These statements are trite and common-place. They are disputed by 
none, but admitted by all. They are mentioned here for the purpose of 
laying a basis for several deductions later on. When we turn to the sec- 
ondary and the higher education we find their history no less remarkable. 
Harvard College was established in 1636, William and Mary in 1693, Yale 
College in 1700, the College of New Jersey in 1748, the University of 
Pennsylvania in 1749, Columbia College in 1754, Brown University in 1765, 
Dartmouth College in 1770, Rutgers College in 1771, Hampden-Sidney Col- 
lege in 1775. Prior to the Revolution, then, the thirteen infant colonies had 
established ten colleges. In Massachusetts alone, the following, which may 
be termed academies, were established before 1800, and are in successful 
operation to this day: The Boston Latin School, established in 1635 ; Elliott 
School, Jamaica Plain, 1691; Dummer Academy, South Byfield, 1763; 
Phillips Academy, Andover, 1778; Leicester Academy, Leicester, 1784; 
Derby Academy, Hingham, 1785; Westford Academy, Westford, 1792; 
Lawrence Academy, Groton, 1793; New Salem Academy, 1795; Bristol 
Academy, Taunton, 1796; Deerfield Academy, Deerfield, 1799. 
The history of academies in this country makes a chapter of profound 
interest to all educators. Within the last forty years in many sections of 
the country, especially in New England, the academies have in many in- 
stances given place to the public, town, high school. The establishment of 
this public high school has marked an important era in the development of 
the higher education. While it is true that evolution of education is neces- 
sarily from above downwards, from the college to the ancient “grammar” 
school, and from that to the “dame” school, yet the reflex influence is also 
well marked. The establishment, in Massachusetts or in Michigan, of a 
vigorous public high school in every considerable town, largely increases the 
number of students in the colleges. 
The foundation and growth of the colleges of America also furnish many 
lessons of importance to the student of education. Not merely is the foun- 
dation of the colleges in the colonial period to be noted, but the rapid 
establishment of. colleges and so-called universities in the newer Northwest 
reflects great credit upon the intelligence and enterprise of the pioneers.
-P-A-G-E-191
  A NATIONAL UNIVERSITY. 191 
The latest report of the Commissioner of Education, 1886-7, names three 
hundred and sixty-one colleges of liberal arts, including twenty-four state 
universities; thirty-three schools of science endowed with the national land 
grant, and thirty-two not endowed with the national land grant. In addi- 
tion should be mentioned seven colleges for women. This makes a total of 
four hundred and thirty-three collegiate institutions in this country. The 
number of academies and other secondary schools for both sexes, given in 
the commissioner’s report, is five hundred and fifty-one; the number for boys 
alone two hundred and thirteen, for girls alone one hundred and seventy- 
two; of similar schools supported wholly by public funds, four hundred and 
nineteen ; and institutions for the superior instruction of women, one hundred 
and fifty-two— making a total of fifteen hundred and seven, provided some 
of these are not reckoned twice. With all these various classes of institu- 
tions for the higher and secondary education—not to mention the profes- 
sional schools, and their name is legion—and with our total of twelve 
million children, or nearly so, in schools of all grades, it might almost be 
said that we are a nation composed of schoolmasters, schoolma’ams, and 
school-children. 
During the last twenty-five years vast strides of improvement have marked 
the progress and development of our schools, seminaries and colleges through- 
out the country. Compulsory laws have been enacted, the length of the 
school-year has been increased, the qualifications of teachers have been raised, 
normal schools have to a marked degree elevated the character of the 
teachers and the teaching, methods have been decidedly improved, and 
special attention has been given on all hands to the study of the principles 
of psychology and didactics. 
But among all the points indicating growth, progress, development, and 
improvement, none is more striking than the ever-increasing attention paid 
to scientific subjects. The study of natural science, especially of physics 
and chemistry, has made marvelous improvement, and produced astonishing 
results. The application of science to inventions, especially to inventions 
of labor-saving machines and new methods of communication and transpor- 
tation, is without parallel in the history of the world. The business of the 
United States Patent Office is simply gigantic. Possibly in no other way 
may the improved and increased educational facilities be more thoroughly 
tested or more accurately measured than by the patent office. I am not 
unobservant of the advance made of late in Johns Hopkins, Harvard, Yale, 
Cornell, Michigan, and other colleges. Indeed, the college curriculum in 
general has been decidedly improved and elevated; but all this does not 
meet the requirements of the case—something more and higher is impera- 
tively demanded. : 
Within the last twenty-five years it has become more and more apparent 
that the great need of this country, educationally, is in the way of advanced 
learning. Relatively we have primary schools enough, and grammar schools  
-P-A-G-E-192
192 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
enough, and possibly enough of the secondary schools, if they were only 
better; and surely we have colleges and universities enough, and to spare. 
But what means Cornell University, and Johns Hopkins University, and 
now what means Clark University? The establishment and remarkable 
success of Johns Hopkins University, at Baltimore, are strongly indicative 
of the absolute necessity of pushing our American education forward into 
new fields, and upward to more elevated plateaus. It is a common remark, 
and notoriously true; that in America the elements of education are more 
widespread than in Europe, yet the higher education of the Old World is 
far in advance of anything to be found with us. Moreover, our situation 
and our circumstances are such, our necessities, our needs, our opportunities, 
that precisely the reverse of this ought to be true. Do not lose sight of the 
fact that this is a very large country. ‘It is energetic, enterprising, wealthy, 
and fast becoming populous. There is a greater demand, a stronger neces- 
sity to-day with us for higher knowledge, deeper insight, a more thorough 
study and apprehension of all branches of knowledge and learning, than 
exists in any other nation under heaven. We could to-day utilize to a 
greater degree than any other people, profound researches in nature, in art, 
in the humanities. There is no department of the higher education which — 
is not needed to-day by our people to be pushed to its utmost limit. In 
how many cases does the aimless searching after truth among us remind one 
of a staunch vessel, strong and well-equipped, drifting in mid-ocean, without 
a pilot, without a chart, without a compass, even without a rudder. In 
natural science, including all its departments, in history, in classical learn- 
ing, in philology, in the useful arts and the fine arts, in law and medicine 
and divinity, in telegraphy, in telephony, in telephoty, in social science — 
especially economies and civics—in all the range of the metaphysics, and 
in fine, in every department of human learning, thought, and investigation, 
there is a marked necessity for higher study and higher instruction than 
this country has yet produced. 
Pause a moment with me to observe a few of these crying necessities. 
With all the advance which we have made in the study of natural phe- 
nomena, there is yet no man living who understands the theory of storms; 
no man living who can satisfactorily explain the ocean currents; nobody has 
yet discovered a satisfactory explanation of the tides; no complete, rational 
theory of medicine exists, but we are still tied down largely to empiricism. 
Psychology is based on physiology, but no one yet comprehends the rela- 
tions and the action of the two lobes of the brain and the two sets of nerves. 
No satisfactory theory is yet agreed upon with respect to bacteria and the 
germs of disease in general, epidemics, epizodtics, and the like. No man 
has yet arisen who can successfully untie and untangle the knots and snarls 
which Adam Smith, more than a century ago, pushed before the learned 
men of the world, and over which they have ever since been quarreling. 
Our politicians and our statesmen are still discussing with great vigor and 
 
-P-A-G-E-193
  A NATIONAL UNIVERSITY. 193 
force the question of protection and free trade, mono- and bi-metallism, of 
state rights and national unity, of home consumption and foreign markets, 
national subsidies and natural currents of trade, and possibly they are now 
as far from agreement as ever. 
It is not to be expected that any one panacea can be discovered or any 
one patent medicine can be compounded which will free the body politic 
from all these ills and all this ignorance that the nation is heir to, but the 
question is a fair one and certainly one of great importance whether it is 
not possible, by proper means and reasonable efforts, to diminish to a con- 
siderable extent the difficulties and dangers here pointed out. 
The success of Johns Hopkins University has been phenomenal. It has 
given opportunities for a higher standard of scholarship than we before 
possessed ; it has helped to elevate the work of all the colleges. But it has 
also served to show clearly the necessity of still further advances. What 
is needed now is an institution far beyond Johns Hopkins. The liberality 
of wealthy Americans has been so great as almost to make it seem that it 
had no limit, but it certainly is not without limit. It can hardly be ex- 
pected that private munificence will be able to establish a university in this 
country with sufficient means to perform adequately the service required in 
the higher realms of learning. We are therefore shut up to the necessity 
of having this needed institution established by the whole people as repre- 
sented by our national government. That, and that alone, will be able to 
accomplish this great work. 
Such an institution as is needed ought to be endowed with productive 
funds to the extent of at least two hundred million dollars. This, at three 
per cent. interest, would bring an annual income of six million dollars. If 
the Government of the United States should set apart this amount of money 
for this specific purpose, to be placed at interest, so that there might be a 
reliable permanent annual income of at least six million dollars, the prob- 
lem of the much-needed higher development of profound learning would at 
once be on the way toward a solution. 
The first question in the discussion of a proposition of such proportions . 
deals with the ability and the advisability of the national government to 
make and endow such an establishment. There is an opinion, more or less 
prevalent in every community, that our national government had better 
not meddle with educational affairs. It is true that the national govern- 
ment, as such, is not committed to any general system of education, because 
it was the policy of the framers of our constitution to leave in the hands of 
the States and the people of the States all rights and duties which did not 
seem necessary to be conferred upon the national government. 
The general government has, however, in various ways, committed itself 
to the cause of education. In addition to setting apart the 16th and 36th 
sections of each township for educational purposes, appropriations of land 
in the newer States have been made for State universities. Fifty years ago
-P-A-G-E-194
194 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  a surplus fund of about thirty millions of dollars had accumulated in the 
national treasury. This surplus revenue was distributed, by act of Con- 
gress, among the States then existing. Many of the States set apart their 
share of this fund for school purposes. The government has maintained 
at its own expense a military academy at West Point, for the education of 
army officers; a.navy academy at Annapolis, to educate officers for the 
navy; a school for deaf mutes at Washington; a school for instruction in 
the signal service at Fort Whipple, Virginia, near Washington; and Con- 
gress has from time to time, during later years, done much for the education 
of the Indians. It has made liberal appropriations for the excellent schools 
for the Indian youth now maintained at Hampton, Virginia; Carlisle, Penn- 
sylvania; Salem, Oregon; Santa Fé, New Mexico; and other places. It 
has maintained common schools at various military posts, and the President 
has lately established a system of education for the Territory of Alaska. It 
has established and for many years maintained, with great profit to the 
nation, a bureau of education, which, by the collection of statistics and the 
publication of useful circulars of information, has done much to elevate 
the general status of education. 
The founders of the Republic were strongly impressed with the necessity 
of a national university. Washington, in his last will and testament, made 
a liberal bequest “towards the endowment of a university, to be established 
within the limits of the District of Columbia, under the auspices of the 
general government,” and he said “that the accomplishment of the object 
will be obtained, I have not the smallest doubt, before many years pass 
away.” In making his bequest, Washington thus clearly and fully set forth 
his views concerning a national university: 
“Tt has always been a source of serious regret with me to see the youth of these 
United States sent to foreign countries for the purposes of education, often before 
their minds are formed or they had imbibed any adequate ideas of the happiness of 
theirown; . . . for these reasons it has been my ardent wish to see a plan de- 
vised, on a liberal scale, which would have a tendency to spread systematic ideas 
through all parts of this rising empire, thereby to do away local attachments and 
state prejudices, as far as in the nature of things would or indeed ought to admit, 
from our national councils. Looking anxiously forward to the accomplishment of 
so desirable an object as this is, (in my estimation,) my mind has not been able to 
contemplate any plan more likely to effect this measure than the establishment of 
a university in a central part of the United States to which the youths of fortune 
and talents from all parts thereof might be sent for the completion of their educa- 
tion in all the branches of polite literature, in the arts and sciences, in acquiring 
knowledge in the principles of politics and good government; and, as a matter of 
infinite importance in my judgment, by associating with each other, and forming 
friendships in juvenile years, be enabled to free themselves in a proper degree from 
those local prejudices and habitual jealousies which have just been mentioned, and 
which, when carried to excess, are never-failing sources of disquiet to the public 
mind, and pregnant with mischievous consequences to this country.” 
The project has from time to time been entertained and plans proposed
-P-A-G-E-195
  A NATIONAL UNIVERSITY. 195 
by many of our greatest writers, most profound thinkers, and wisest states- 
men. It was discussed at length by this Association at. Elmira and at 
Detroit fifteen or sixteen years ago. Several articles of great value have 
lately appeared in our magazines. Some of our most eminent educators, 
like ex-President White of Cornell University, Dr. William T. Harris, and: 
others, have discussed the subject with great ability. No valid objections 
against the general idea have yet been made. The great difficulty has been 
to devise a plan sufficiently well defined and free from objectionable features 
which would seem feasible, and especially a plan so formed as to insure its 
perpetuity, entirely freed from politics, political parties, jobbery and fluctu- 
ations, thereby insuring a wise, and steady, and permanent management. 
I shall content myself in the remainder of this paper with the purpose, 
without quoting from authorities, plainly and concisely, and I trust intelli- 
gently, to set forth a plan on which it has seemed to me possible for the 
government to establish a national university which should meet the wants. 
of this great country, and elevate to a high degree good learning in every 
desirable direction with the wisest and happiest results. f 
1. Permanent Investep Funps.—According to the census of 1880, the 
estimated true valuation of the property in the United States was forty- 
three thousand million dollars. The’ estimated true value in 1870 was 
thirty thousand million dollars. These figures show an increase of forty- 
five per cent. in ten years. Doubtless the wealth of the country has in- 
creased during the present decade fully as much. This estimate would give 
for the entire true valuation of the property of the country in 1890, sixty- 
three thousand million dollars. If the government should set aside for the 
purpose of a national university two hundred millions, it would be equiva- 
lent to an assessment of less than one-third of one per cent. on the estimated 
valuation of the property of the country. Please bear in mind that this is 
not to be an annual assessment, but this appropriation, once for all, of two 
hundred million dollars, would be the permanent endowment of this great 
university. This endowment could be effected without any direct tax, by 
turning over to the trustees of the university that amount of government 
bonds. It is estimated that this sum would be ample for all purposes for 
a long period of years. The institution must be a growth; it must begin 
with a few students, and increase year by year in numbers and in the 
breadth of the instruction. Should such an institution succeed in accom- 
plishing what it is confidently believed it would accomplish, then fifty years 
hence, more or less, if a larger endowment was required, it could be made. 
with the greatest ease. At that time there would be doubtless no difficulty, 
should the amount be needed, in raising this endowment to five hundred 
million, or even a thousand million dollars. 
2. Tue Scorr or tHe Untversiry.—I do not think there would be sufti- 
cient reasons for establishing by the government a national college of the 
ordinary type. The State universities and the large number of colleges es-
-P-A-G-E-196
196 
  tablished in the several States by private munificence are sufficient for the 
needs of the people. If the proposed national university were to be modeled 
after the plan of Harvard or Yale, Cornell or Ann Arbor, or even Johns 
Hopkins, it had better not be founded. The purpose and scope of such an 
institution should be for higher and broader work than can be done in any 
existing institution; its object should be largely for original investigation; 
it should, in many departments at least, aim primarily to reach out to the 
unknown; its standard should be higher than that of any institution in the 
world; it should have no undergraduate courses, but all its work should be 
above and beyond the ordinary college curriculum. The institution should 
be closely connected with the Smithsonian Institution, the National Museum, 
the Bureau of Light-houses, the Geological Survey, the Coast Survey, the 
Department of Agriculture; all the scientific investigations of the Depart- 
ment of the Navy, such as deep-sea soundings, ocean currents, tides and the 
like, the Weather Bureau, the Congressional Library, and all other depart- 
ments of the government where the connection would be mutually advan- 
tageous; it should include the Bureau of Education, the work of which 
should be broadened and strengthened. 
3. Irs Courses or Srupy.—The plan for such a university as here con- 
templated proceeds on the supposition that the funds at its disposal from 
year to year are amply sufficient to allow its members and fellows to pursue 
lines of study for any number of years, even through a lifetime. 
(a.) In-Natural Science. The lines of study to be pursued in this uni- 
versity in the department of natural science should include the higher 
realms of investigation in geography, in physics, chemistry, meteorology, 
zoology, and natural history, physiology, biology, botany, astronomy —in- 
cluding especially the investigation of the laws and phenomena of the solar 
system, and various lines of.study in relation to the fixed stars, nebule, and 
theories of the universe —and special studies in whatever direction it might 
seem, from time to time, wise to undertake. In mentioning the foregoing 
list, classification of the sciences is nqt intended, but only to call special 
attention to certain lines and topics which seem especially to need investi- 
gation. 
(b.) The Mathematics. Here the effort should be to push this branch of 
study, like all other branches, to the farthest limit—the higher mathemat- 
ies: algebra, geometry, trigonometry, analytical geometry, the calculus; the 
mathematics of the earth, e. g., its quantity of matter, weight, size, diameter, 
circumference, absolute length of a degree of longitude at different latitudes, 
absolute length of a degree of latitude from the equator to the poles, sys- 
tems of measurements, etc.; astronomical mathematics, with all its varied 
applications in different directions; and, in short, the study and investiga- 
tion of any and every department of mathematical inquiry which might 
seem wise, necessary, or useful. 
(c.) Language Study. Under this head should be included the greatest
-P-A-G-E-197
A NATIONAL UNIVERSITY. 197 
  
facilities for the study of every language, ancient or modern, that might 
seem desirable, and to such an extent as might seem desirable; the litera- 
ture of all nations and of all times; all questions of profound inquiry into 
the Latin and Greek languages and literatures; the investigation of intri- 
cate and disputed questions concerning modern or ancient languages; .and 
all branches of the study of philology. 
(d.) History. Here is a branch of learning which is even now but begin- 
ning to be developed and pursued scientifically. Instruction should be 
given in the philosophy of history, the laws of history, the history of nations 
and peoples, with special reference to the causes and accessories of their de- 
velopment, growth, strength, and decay; the characteristics of races, the 
influences of climate, the effects of institutions, and in fine the general laws 
and philosophy of the development of mankind. Special attention should 
be paid to the study of our own history, and to the types of mind necessary 
for successful historians and the underlying laws and principles that should 
govern the writing of any history, bearing in mind the practical advantages 
which would accrue from the introduction of better and more scientific 
methods of studying and writing history. 
(e.) The Metaphysics. In this department should be elaborated the best 
methods of study and of teaching the most profound philosophy of all meta- 
physical inquiry. An historical investigation should be early made into 
the various leading schools of philosophy in the past, their strength, their 
weaknesses, and their influence upon human thought. Farther analysis 
here is unnecessary. 
(f.) Social Science. Under this head might perhaps be included the study 
of economics, civics, labor and capital, penal and reformatory institutions, 
the state and education, and many other subjects which need not be specific- 
_ally mentioned. 
(g.) The School of Law. There should be connected with this institution 
a department for the study of law, which should include a more scientific 
and complete investigation of the underlying principles of this important 
line of human inquiry than has ever been attempted. The department of 
international law should be made prominent; the principles of arbitration 
and peaceful settlement of international difficulties should be elaborated. 
The principles of common law and of the various branches of law-practice 
as applicable to business and to the development of the state, should receive 
special consideration. The history of the leading systems of law, ancient 
and modern, should be carefully studied. Improvements in our code should 
_be suggested. There should be a school of diplomacy, for instruction in the 
principles and duties of statesmen, foreign ministers, consuls, etc. : 
(h.) The School of Medicine. It should not be the province of the school 
of law in this institution to make lawyers, but to study the intricate ques- 
tions of the higher range of topics relating to the fundamental principles 
and practices, especially in reference to their bearing upon national and 
13—N. E. A.
-P-A-G-E-198
  198 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  
governmental matters; nor should it be the province of the school of medi- 
cine to fit young men for the ordinary practice of the healing art, but to 
develop a higher range of thought and knowledge and work along the line 
of specialties, in which so great advance and improvement have been made ~ 
of late, particularly in the schools of the Old World. In connection with 
the medical department of the army and navy, there should be’ furnished 
in this institution the best. facilities for this study which the world can 
afford. Suppose that one man, or ten men, should devote their entire life- 
time to the study of bacteria, what important results might be among the 
possibilities! What might not such an institution have done for Jackson- 
ville! 
Gi.) Engineering. In connection with the corps of engineers in the army 
there should be furnished in this institution the best facilities for the study 
of the highest range of thought and practice in railroad engineering, mining 
engineering, topographical engineering, bridge-building, and every part of 
this practical and useful science and art. The matter of river and harbor 
improvements by the general government might be placed under the care 
of this institution. 
(j.) The Science of Warfare. It is possible that the military school at 
» West Point and the naval school at Annapolis might be made departments of 
this institution, receiving thereby great advantages, and without transfer- 
ring the immediate control from the departments of the army and the navy ; 
or the West Point cadets —such as might be the best qualified — might, after 
graduating, go to Washington to study for professorships. In addition to 
these schools, there might be established courses of lectures and studies for 
superior army officers, and others perhaps, for the investigation of advanced 
modes of carrying on war whenever the necessity may arise. 
(k.) The Weather Bureau. This bureau of the government should be- 
come a part of the national university, and form a regular department in 
its study and work. The most learned professors which the world affords 
should here give instruction and pursue investigations in this intricate 
science. ‘ 
Cl.) The Census Bureau should be a permanent department under this 
university, and there should be in connection therewith a well-organized 
bureau of statistics. 
The foregoing list of branches for study and for investigation are in no 
sense designed to be scientifically arranged, or to be exhaustive or complete ; 
but they have been introduced only for the purpose of giving a general 
idea of the plan and scope which might characterize such an institution. 
All that is intended to be conveyed in this direction is simply the fact that 
if our government should establish a national university, it should be the 
principal design and aim of such an institution to investigate in the broadest 
and deepest manner possible all branches of higher learning, and to carry 
this investigation to the farthest possible limit. I have not mentioned the  
-P-A-G-E-199

  study of fine arts—music, painting, and sculpture—although they might 
perhaps as well be included as any of the courses named. The Civil Service 
Bureau, and from time to time other bureaus, should be added to this uni- 
versity —indeed, there seems to be no good reason why the courses of study 
should not be coéxtensive with the limits of human thought and investiga- 
tion. ; ‘ 
This is not the place or the time to discuss the problem of the education 
of women. It would seem plain, however, that a great national university 
like that here advocated should not ignore the claims of women to a superior 
education, and should not omit to make provision for the highest intellectual 
education of women in this country. There are at least many branches 
of study, if not all, to which they should be invited. The recent death of 
Professor Maria Mitchell, the eminent astronomer, emphasizes the right and 
the necessity to make proper provision for women in such an institution. 
The details, however, must necessarily be left to the wisdom of the board of 
trustees. 
4. Irs Puan or OrGANIZATION.—I am not unaware of the fact that con- 
cerning every one of the topics here discussed there will naturally be found 
very different opinions and views from those here given. I am only aiming 
to express as clearly as I may, the plangwhich lies in my mind; I do not 
anticipate that this scheme will be at once adopted by our government, nor 
do I even ask the approval of this Association. My sole object is a desire 
to present for further thought and general consideration a broad plan such 
as if carried out might be found of great advantage to the country. It has 
seemed to me that the following might not be an unwise plan for its organ- 
ization, and everyone will see at a glance that this would give us the greatest, 
and broadest educational institution in the world. It should be established 
by the United States Government; it should be at once placed upon an in- 
dependent financial basis; its funds should be two hundred million dollars ; 
the entire amount should be invested as permanent funds, with an unchange- 
able provision that only the income of the whole amount should be used. 
Of course it would require several years to get such an institution into full 
working order, and during these years the income of six or seven millions 
each year would be sufficient to erect and equip the proper buildings and 
furnish the necessary apparatus. These buildings should be located in 
Washington; it were better to have them on government lands, although 
this is not essential; it might be thought advisable to have branches in the 
various sections of the country for experiments, and the study of agriculture, 
floriculture, arboriculture, and for the study of the flora and fauna in the 
different latitudes. It has already been said that the university should be 
beyond the reach of politics and political influence. For this purpose its 
government should be in the hands of a board of trustees who could be re- 
moved only by impeachment and trial before the Supreme Court of the 
United States; thirty members of this board should be selected and nomi-  
-P-A-G-E-200
200 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  nated by the President and confirmed by the Senate, and then confirmed by 
the Supreme Court of the United States; the remaining members of the 
board of trustees should be ew officio the President of the United States, the 
Vice-President, the Speaker of the House, the Chief Justice of the Supreme 
Court, the Commissioner of Patents, the Secretary of the Smithsonian Insti- 
tution, the Commissioner of Education, the Librarian of Congress, and pos- 
sibly one or two others; the term of office of the ex-officio members should be 
during the term in which they hold their official positions respectively. The 
thirty members in the first instance should be elected for the following 
terms: Three for one year, three for two years, three for three years, and so 
on— the last holding office for ten years; afterwards every member is elected 
for ten years. Members are eligible for reélection; the board fills all 
vacancies. It might be desirable for the president of the university to be a 
member of the board of trustees. It might perhaps add to the strength of 
the management if the presidents of ten of our leading colleges or universities 
should be e2-officio members of this board. This would make sure of the 
element of high scholarship and practical acquaintance with the best college 
work of the country, and keep these leading institutions in close touch. and 
sympathy with the university. It should be the duty of the board of trus- 
tees to shape the policy of the university; to inaugurate or sanction new 
methods, new departments, new movements; appoint the president and fac- 
ulty, and to have the general oversight which is generally invested in such 
a board. Each separate school, like law, medicine, science, should have a 
dean and a separate faculty. The design of this plan of organization is to- 
free the university from all political influence, disconnect it from any and 
every department of the government, and permit its management to be un- 
trammeled, wise and efficient. It would be proper for this board, when the 
university has come into successful operation, to devise methods by which 
the faculty of the ditferent schools or departments of the university may 
propose to the trustees plans for their consideration and approval or rejec- 
tion. 
5. Irs Mempurs:—The next two topics are the most difficult to deal 
with. How the members and fellows of this university should be selected, 
and what should be the terms of admission, are questions which lie at the 
bottom of success for the institution. I venture to suggest in a tentative 
way some such plan as the following, as well calculated to secure the broadest 
and most generous patronage, and the highest quality of talent possible. 
In the first place, let students be appointed to membership from the different 
congressional districts in the country, after being nominated by competitive 
preliminary examinations. In that way every member of the House of 
Representatives will have an opportunity to present to the people of his 
district the chance of selecting from their scholarly young men one to be a 
candidate for admission to the university through its regular examination. 
In the next place, I would propose that every college in the country, of
-P-A-G-E-201
  A NATIONAL UNIVERSITY. 201 
good reputation for high scholarship, and which has the power to grant ~ 
degrees, should have an opportunity to send one candidate for admission ; 
but it must be distinctly borne in mind that no one can be admitted a 
member of the university except by passing in a creditable manner a rigid 
examination, such as shall be laid down by the trustees, or the faculty act- 
ing under the direction of the trustees. No tuition shall be charged for 
such students as have now been indicated, but, on the other hand, as the 
entire aim and design of the university is to benefit the country, and hence 
the work of the students is to be in a certain sense for the public welfare, 
it will probably be deemed wise and just to allow to each student thus rec- 
ommended by the member of Congress, or by the faculty of the colleges; a 
fixed sum annually, sufficient, with the strictest economy, to defray his nec- 
| essary expenses— perhaps five hundred dollars a year. Still another class 
of students may be admitted on their own application, each one passing, of 
course, the regular examination. This class, however, will be expected to 
pay a reasonable tuition, and will not receive pay from the university. The 
students thus selected will pursue the regular courses of «study, some in one 
direction, some in another, not merely by election, but by the most careful 
consultation between the student and the faculty. It is to be understood that 
no student is to be admitted to this university except such as have com- 
pleted successfully courses of study equivalent to what is required in our 
best colleges for the master’s degree; but graduation from college or any 
other educational institution is not essential for admission. Qualifications 
for admission are to be determined only by the regular examinations. 
6. FeLLowsurps.—Under this department the most important work of 
the university is to be done. There should be a class termed “Fellows of 
the University,” who have taken the regular courses of study in this insti- 
tution in some one direction, or by exception without having taken them — 
for example, the line of sciences, or of classical study, or the metaphysics, 
or economics, etc. Every fellow of the university is to be selected and 
approved by the faculty and appointed by special vote of the trustees to 
carry on some line of broad study. These fellows shall pursue studies in 
classes or groups or singly, as the case may require, under the direction of 
that branch of the faculty having charge of the particular line of study 
pursued. The object of this work shall be to add something original to 
the sum total of human knowledge. Their studies may be continued so 
long as the faculty in charge shall deem it advisable; whether for one year 
or for a lifetime. Let me outline some of the possibilities of work which 
might be done by the faculty and fellows of this university: The depart- 
ment of geological survey should be established on such a basis that this 
whole country should be mapped out, and its geological features and miner- 
alogical riches should be carefully studied and published for the benefit of 
the country. The weather bureau should be organized in such a way as in 
a series of years to collect facts sufficient to form the data for a complete 
   
-P-A-G-E-202
  202 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  and scientific theory of tempests, tornadoes, storms of all kinds; the entire 
theory of evaporation and rainfall, of the winds as to their direction and 
force, and all matters relating to the meteorology of the country, should be 
elaborated and made plain. The coast survey should be reorganized, and 
its work continued; expeditions should be planned and executed for the 
study of ocean currents and tidal waves, and in fact of the entire theory 
and practical operation and effects of the tides. The most elaborate prepa- 
rations should be made for the observation of eclipses and other astronom- 
ical phenomena. In cases of disaster—for example, the breaking down of 
a railroad bridge, the destruction in the Conemaugh valley, a great fire, an 
epidemic, a blizzard, or a tornado—an expedition should be immediately 
sent to the spot for careful investigation into the causes, circumstances, and 
results, and all this would be tabulated for future use. In short, the object 
constantly in mind for the work of the fellows of the university would be 
to take advantage of all remarkable phenomena, and so applying the full 
power of the microscope of all science as to educe in every instance such 
knowledge as shall be for the benefit of mankind. Among these fellows 
we should expect to find our poet laureate, our best writers of fiction, phi- 
losophers, inventors, discoverers, benefactors. Fellows of the university 
should receive a fixed salary, according to their grade and experience—a 
salary sufficient to induce them to remain permanently at their work. In 
this way we should have clustering around the national university the ablest 
men, the highest scholarship, the soundest philosophy, the deepest science in 
the world; and who can measure or weigh or estimate the advantages which 
would accrue to society and the world at large from such concentration of 
scholarship and learning! 
The United States should be not only the greatest and strongest of the 
nations, but she should be the wisest and most beneficent. She has laid a 
broad foundation for a pyramid, which should be larger and more enduring 
than those of Egypt, in the general diffusion of the elements of learning 
for all her youth in our beneficent system of public schools. Let her now, 
by the establishment of this national university, build securely and strongly 
upon this basis, and extend upward this great pyramid till its apex shall be 
high up in the heavens, above all mists of ignorance, superstition, vice, and 
crime. 
EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS OF THE COLORED PEOPLE 
IN THE SOUTH. 
JOHN H. BURRUS, RODNEY, MISSISSIPPI. 
In the summer of 1868 I went to Woodbury, Tenn., to a big meeting to 
see the people about opening a school. The leaders of the colored people, 
after some time spent in investigating the matter, expressed a strong desire
-P-A-G-E-203
  EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS OF THE COLORED RACE. 203 
  
to have a school, but said they had no house of their own, and could not 
rent one for school purposes. They also said they were afraid, from what 
had been told them, that if I remained and opened school I would be 
kukluxed. On my return to Nashville, I attended church one night in 
Murfreesboro, and while returning to my lodging-place I met a leader and 
then a company of kuklux—all, both riders and horses, heavily masked. 
We did not molest each other, however, and I was rather pleased by that 
fact. 
I am informed that the colored people of Woodbury long since have 
bought church and school property, and that many of the best white people 
thereof are outspoken friends of justice and knowledge for all classes of 
citizens. Why should the best people of any civilized and Christianized 
community be anything else than outspoken friends of justice and knowl- 
edge for all struggling humanity —natives, certainly, as well as foreigners. 
Twenty years ago the first of August my first school was opened, seven 
miles from this city. I had walked more than one hundred miles within a 
radius of twenty miles of Nashville, and invariably found the colored people 
anxious to have a school, but unable to get a house in which to have it, till 
a cologed man gave up one of his two small rooms that the school might be 
taught. At one place, some sixteen miles away, the chairman of the board 
of school directors said an old building on a neighbor’s farm had served as 
a colored school-house the session of 1868, but that the house had been 
burned by incendiaries, and that consequently the land-owners were afraid 
to permit any building on their places to be used as a colored school, lest it 
should be burned by those white people of the neighborhood who were op- 
posed to negro education. These personal observations and experiences in 
the locality of Nashville twenty years ago are mentioned by way of intro- 
duction, for the two-fold reason that they give a faint picture of the hard 
position from which the colored people had to start on their journey of edu- 
cational progress; and further, because Nashville has made such material 
progress toward the equitable and patriotic recognition of the educational 
rights of all citizens, that she can afford to have held up some of the un- 
righteous intolerance of those angry days without feeling bound to fly into 
a towering passion. 
Everywhere I went seeking a school, the people were seen just as emanci- 
pation found them, with no property, no books, no newspapers, no schools, 
no education; no pictures in their houses, no flowers in their yards, no 
houses fit for American citizens to live in permanently; but the smallest 
experience in or knowledge of affairs, little money and less knowledge of 
how to make money an invaluable servant; an exceedingly limited idea of 
what being free men and women and American citizens meant, even a more 
imperfect idea of their American citizenship rights and how to maintain the 
same; no house of worship they could call their own; enthusiastically relig- 
ious, but with an idea of religion much more crude and traditional than

Biblical, and much better adapted to the condition of slaves than of freemen. 
To-day there are colored salesmen and saleswomen, clerks, book-keepers, 
compositors, engineers, typewriters, authors of text-books, historians, poets, 
biographers, theologians, journalists, story-writers, painters, sculptors and 
sculptresses, engravers, photographers, contractors, inventors, bank directors, 
sea captains, politicians, missionaries, teachers, educated preachers and 
farmers; successful business men and women, whose financial standing is 
constantly moving upward; musicians and musical artists, who are attract- 
ing more and more attention and drawing larger audiences; lawyers and 
doctors, the bread-winning results of whose labors are steadily improving; 
and every now and then the papers show that new fields of skilled and in- 
tellectual labor, heretofore barred against them, are being thrown open, be- 
cause their educational progress has demonstrated their claims to admission. 
To have liberally bestowed upon them in constitutions, in acts of, legisla- 
tures, and in resolutions of city school boards, equal educational advantages 
is a very nice thing perhaps for those who put the awards on paper, but the 
colored people need and want suitable school buildings, well equipped with 
improved furniture and apparatus, and manned by competent, interested 
and progressive teachers. * 
The nation, under act of Congress of 1862, appropriated land for agricul- 
tural and mechanical education in the various States, and they want their 
equitable share of the benefits of that fund, because they know they need 
such education. To be fairly treated in the distribution of that fund as they 
are in Mississippi, and perhaps in South Carolina and Virginia, is not satis- 
factory; they need their equitable share in all the States. Congress by an 
act in 1887 appropriated $15,000 annually to each State for agricultural 
experiment purposes, and they feel that they need the benefits of just such 
training, and want their equitable share thereof. 
Rey. C. B. Curtis, of Alabama, recently said that “of the 450,000 negroes 
who live outside of the cities in Alabama, scarcely any have any educational 
facilities, and most of them are without any knowledge whatever of the im- 
proved agricultural and industrial methods.” Does Alabama give her colored 
population their equitable share of the national agricultural appropriations, 
under the acts of Congress of 1862 and 1887? It is said, upon what seems 
good authority, that they pay taxes on $10,000,000 of property in Georgia, 
$12,000,000 in Alabama, $25,000,000 in Louisiana, and so on in the other 
States. As laborers, renters and consumers they indirectly pay much more 
taxes than that; hence they want to have their children enjoy educational 
privileges through the common schools of their respective States, not exactly 
as non-tax-paying paupers, but as law-abiding, industrious, tax-paying citi- 
zens, whose children’s education will greatly benefit the State as the years 
roll by. 
Many a man who twenty years ago would fly into a frenzy of rage when 
told that the State should offer educational advantages to the newly-made 
 
-P-A-G-E-205
  EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS OF THE COLORED RACE. 205 
citizens, is now an honest and earnest advocate of liberal school privileges 
for every child in the land, because he believes patriotism, humanity and 
Christianity all demand it. Many a man who then held the idea that col- 
ored people could not master the higher studies, mathematics especially, 
has since found reason to change his opinion and join in sentiments Mr. W. 
H. Baker, the superintendent of public schools in Savannah, Georgia, who 
writes: “I desire to have it known that, as a result of my observation, which 
has been extensive, I am convinced that the colored people are exceedingly 
anxious to educate their children. The colored children in the schools of 
this city are making rapid progress. They not only show ability for learn- 
ing what are termed the elementary branches, but seem to grasp without 
difficulty those studies which are included in the curriculum of what is 
classed as secondary education. I write this,” adds he, “because for many 
“years I held a contrary opinion.” Though a large part of the impulsive 
enthusiasm which just after the emancipation proclamation put a blue- 
back spelling-book into the hat or great-pocket of nearly every colored 
man in the land long since spent itself, the desire is still almost universal 
among parents to have their children enjoy some school privileges. This 
fact is so forcibly illustrated by a narration found in the report of the 
Commissioner of Education for 1886-7, that the language is here intro- 
duced. Speaking of the administration of the John F. Slater fund through 
the agent thereof, Dr. Haygood, of Georgia, the report says: “In February, 
1887, Dr. Haygood sent out 300 circular letters, ‘asking the best judgment 
of those to whom they were sent on the matters inquired about.’ Two of 
the inquiries made are connected with the subject of education: ‘Do colored 
parents manifest interest in the education of their children? Are the com- 
mon schools attended by colored children improving in their character?’ 
From the 300 letters of inquiry thus sent to officials, educators, and profes- 
sional and business men, white and colored, 236 replies had been received 
by May, 1887. To the inquiry as to the interest of colored people in the 
education of their children, 230 answered ‘Yes.’ . . . To the second 
query, a very material one, as to the improvement in the character of the 
common schools as educational institutions, 199 respond affirmatively, and 
only four think not. Personal and diligent inquiry throughout the South 
causes Dr. Haygood to believe ‘that the answers given by the majority of 
those who replied to his circular letter give the true view on the questions 
asked.’” 
The same report gives 15,815 teachers and 1,118,556 pupils in the com- 
mon schools for colored children in the various States. Scanning these 
reports for some years, it will be seen that the experience of the colored 
people as free men and women has rather crystallized than dampened their 
zeal to have their children educated, since the number of pupils enrolled 
has steadily increased, and would have been greater if the school facilities 
had been ampler. This increase in the number of teachers and pupils in
-P-A-G-E-206

their public schools may also be taken as a hopeful sign that the illiberal 
and unchristian spirit of caste that would foster ignorance and all its at- 
tendant follies and vices, rather than rise sufficiently above prejudice to 
advocate just and impartial school privileges for every child in the State, is 
surely, though slowly, being driven back where it belongs—into the bar- 
barism of bygone ages. This report also tells us there are 83 colleges, 
professional schools, and academies, with 615 teachers and 11,267 students, 
scattered through the country. 
These figures, instructive though they are, do not furnish the fullest in- 
formation on the subject. I know of about four high schools and colleges 
owned and run by colored people themselves in my own State, Mississippi, 
and have learned of several such schools in Louisiana and Arkansas, none 
of which seem to be accounted for in the report of the Commissioner. It 
is reasonable to suppose that similar schools in other States have not been 
reported. Complete reports from all such schools would swell the number 
of both teachers and students credited to the colored colleges, etc. Still 
the number of young colored women and men who are striving for higher 
education would not be completed till all those who attend the great uni- 
versities, colleges, academies, grammar schools and high schools of the 
North and West, where separate colleges are not required, had been ac- 
counted for. A certain newspaper, commenting upon the number of times 
within the past few years that colored women and men have carried off 
high honors among their white fellow-students in these great institutions of 
learning, uses this language: “If anyone is inclined to doubt the ability of 
the negro to master the intricacies of science and learning, let him watch 
the commencement reports of the various institutions of learning through- 
out the country, and it will convince him that a black skin can cover, and 
does cover, as much brain, culture, and physical prowess as a white one.” 
Col. Van Horn, of the Kansas City Journal, speaks thus of the Colored 
Press Convention recently held in Washington: “To me the most remark- 
able event of the inaugural year, is a convention of negro editors from all 
parts of the United States. To give an idea of its size, the executive com- 
mittee alone represents twenty newspapers. And now let us see what this 
means,” says the thoughtful Colonel. “It will be twenty-four years next 
month since Appomattox, when the negro could say he was a free man; 
save here and there a black man who had been educated at Oberlin or some 
Quaker school, or was self-taught, the colored race was an unrelieved mass 
of ignorance, appalling to the thoughtful and a menace to the timid. And 
to-day we have this national convention of negro editors, representing a 
formidable list of newspapers, and its discussions up to the literary standard 
of any popular assembly. In the annals of civilization there is nothing 
like it.” It is now claimed that there are in the United States in the neigh- 
borhood of 250 newspapers and one magazine owned and published by col- 
ored men and women. One of these is a well-gotten-up illustrated paper.
-P-A-G-E-207
  EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS OF THE COLORED RACE.- 207 
Some of these papers are feeble, spasmodic and uncertain; but the Ameri- 
can idea is, “No venture, no success.” The colored newspapers are filling a 
niche in the American temple of enlightened liberty which even now com- 
mands attention. Their influence will expand, and be more and more a 
potent factor in shaping public sentiment in the future, as the colored people 
progress financially and intellectually, and more fully comprehend the im- 
portance of having strong, ably-edited newspapers to bring their grievances 
before the bar of the enlightened and Christian sentiment of their own 
country and of the civilized world. 
Last January, Prof. Joseph Anderson, of Alcorn A. and M. College, wrote 
to the Commissioner of Patents for the number of inventions patented by 
colored persons, and received a reply dated January 29th. This letter gives 
the registered numbers of twenty-two inventions, the names and residences 
of the inventors, and the things invented, together with the dates of the 
inventions, but says a separate list of colored inventors is not kept. Last 
April a letter was addressed to the Commissioner of Patents for the purpose 
of satisfying a group of gentlemen, among whom was the editor of the Georgia 
Wesleyan Christian Advocate, of the Church South, whether the negro has 
any creative faculty, or not. The reply to this letter was dated April 10, 
1889, and sets forth in full thirty-five inventions by colored persons. Going 
over the list, it will be found that the latest invention mentioned was patented 
December, 1888; yet this letter credits to colored persons thirteen more in- 
ventions than did the one first mentioned, though it was dated January, 1889. 
The explanation is clear: between the date of the first and the date of the 
second letter, inventions were found to be the work of colored people which 
previously were not credited to them. 
I have been informed of four inventions by colored men, that are not 
found in either of the lists furnished by these letters. One of these is a 
plow which The Apostolic Guide says has netted its inventor, a Mr. Arthur 
Read, $50,000. Here, then, is a list of thirty-nine inventions by colored 
persons, with a high probability that the list is incomplete. 
Among the inventions given will be noticed a dough-kneader, improved 
gridiron, cornstalk harvester, shoe, shield for infantry and artillery men, 
locomotive smokestack, fire extinguisher, cotton cultivator, joiner’s clamp, 
process for preparing cocoanut for domestic use, life-preserving stool, furni- 
ture caster, range, treating cocoanut, rotary engine, printing press, library 
table, fire-escape, ladder-scaffold support, fife holder, eye protector, life- 
saving apparatus, corn-planter check-rower, window ventilator for railroad 
cars, shutter and window fastener, combined truss and bandage, hand corn- 
shelling device, steam-boiler furnace, telephone transmitter, apparatus for 
transmission of message by electricity, horseshoe, biscuit cutter, receptacle 
for storing and preserving papers, and gong-and-signal chair for hotels. 
Commenting upon these inventions and their significance, The Wesleyan 
says: “(A wise man who is also a good man wants to know the facts bearing
-P-A-G-E-208
  208 * THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
upon any moral, social or political problem he is concerned to solve. Only 
a fool ignores facts; only a bad man willfully perverts them.” That excel- 
lent paper sums up thus: “The reader will notice, (1) that, with one excep- 
tion, the list begins with the year 1870, and covers, therefore, only eighteen 
years; (2) that most of the inventors are Northern negroes, and have prob- 
ably had one or two generations of freedom and education back of them, 
which would indicate the development of the creative faculty with increas- 
ing years of education; (3) and also that the subjects cover a very consid- 
erable range of scientific principles. He must be very incredulous who can 
read the list and continue to doubt the negro’s ability, with fair opportunity 
given, to create and maiatain a Christian civilization.” If the reasoning 
of this Georgia paper is sound, will it not abundantly pay, as a patriotic 
investment, for the States in which the colored people are mostly congre- 
gated to materially enlarge the higher educational advantages provided for 
their colored youth, that these States in future may reap the rich reward 
of having more intelligent and productive citizens? 
These are certainly undeniable evidences of educational progress for 
twenty-four years of partially-thwarted opportunities. Their progress has 
probably not been entirely satisfactory to some sanguine friends. They 
have likely not made the most perfect use of all their opportunities and 
privileges. I will not undertake the useless task of extenuating their ao 
comings, but will venture the suggestion that if the couplet, 
“Be to their faults a little blind, 
Be to their virtues very kind,” 
is to he departed from in their case, and they are all to be stoned by the 
rest of their fellow-citizens for the follies, vices and non-progressiveness of 
some, or even of many, supposed or real, then let that class of the American 
people who have perfectly improved all their opportunities and advantages 
for becoming honest, industrious, intelligent, humane, virtuous and progress- 
ive, cast the first stone. Their teachers and ministers are not all perfect; 
but it is encouraging to know that there is a desire for better teachers and 
better preachers widespread, and spreading as it becomes more and more 
recognized that intellectual efficiency and moral purity among the teachers 
and preachers of a people struggling for progress should be rigidly insisted 
upon. 
Of late the Catholics have begun to establish denominational schools for 
the instruction of colored children; so haye the Episcopalians; the Southern 
Methodists, the Presbyterians, and perhaps other denominations, are also 
beginning to do the same. I believe the Baptists of my State for several 
years have been rendering some aid in this direction, and are looking toward 
something more substantial. There is work enough yet for all who may feel 
moved to enter the field; but it is especially gratifying to have these denom-

of their efforts as for the actual amount of dollars and cents they may feel 
able and willing to-invest in it. 
The mere contemplation of the immense distance still to be traversed ere 
the goal of a perfect intellectual and moral manhood and womanhood is at- 
tained, is enough to make one’s head dizzy. Linger not too long upon that 
thought, but mentally sweep back over the almost limitless and unrelieved 
desert of poverty, ignorance, superstition, inexperience and thoughtlessness 
which, by the unalterable decree of the God of Battles, was turned loose at 
the close of the late war to survive or perish; dwell more leisurely upon the 
little army of educated ministers, teachers, editors, artists, inventors, business 
and professional men and women, and men and women of affairs, many of 
whom are winning commendations for their successful labors and upright 
lives. Notice, yet not too exactingly, here and there, established, officered 
and supported by the colored people themselves, high schools and colleges 
that are hard at work teaching the rising generation to think and reason 
correctly. So great and pleasing a change would have been impossible 
except for the benevolent educational institutions planted here and there 
over this beautiful Southland since the war. 
I feel sure I but feebly express the gratitude of the thousands thus bene- 
fited, directly or indirectly, toward the Northern and English people and 
children who have given and are yet giving so liberally of their means for 
the establishment and support of these schools, and toward the women and 
men who have so freely devoted the best years of their lives to the work of 
enlightening and inspiring the colored people and their children, when I 
say with all the devoutness of a full heart, may the God of truth, justice 
and love bless them, prosper them, and make them truly wise and good unto 
eternal happiness. Vast indeed is the improvement yet to be made, partic- 
ularly away from great railroad centers and in interior regions, but the 
difference between twenty-four years ago and to-day is stupendous. In the 
language of a last March issue of the Philadelphia Press: 
“There is no achievement of the present generation, probably, which will awaken 
more admiration fifty years hence than the change accomplished in the social and 
intellectual condition of the ex-slave population of the South. The transformation 
of these millions of men and women, who by force had been kept ignorant and de- 
graded, into an educated and refined people, will justly rank among the wonders of 
the nineteenth century.”

THE CULTURE VALUE OF THE HISTORY OF EDUCATION. 
  
B. A. HINSDALE, ANN ARBOR, MICHIGAN, 
The appearance on the morning’s program of the subjects following my 
own will cause no surprise. That the history of education contains lessons 
of great practical value for the educational statesman, for the school admin- 
istrator, and for the teacher, are propositions by no means novel, even if 
their importance is not fully appreciated. That this history also has great 
culture value may not be an absolutely novel proposition, but it is certainly 
much less familiar than the others, and is much less appreciated. This is 
the proposition that I am to bring into the foreground. 
First of all, let me explain that by the culture value of the subject is 
here meant its total value separate and apart from guidance or practice. 
Everything that the history of education does for the mind as such, whether 
training its powers, storing it with information, or planting it with fruitful 
ideas, is included in the topic. In this discussion, however, it will not be 
necessary or advantageous to separate the total culture product into these 
several parts. 
Possibly it is commonly supposed that the history of education consists 
of dry bits of information relating to studies, methods of school organiza- 
tion, teaching, and discipline, school legislation, and school appliances, to- 
gether with personal notices of some quite peculiar and uninteresting men 
called schoolmasters and educational reformers. It does indeed embrace 
all these subjects, that are of such great practical value; however, if this 
were all, we could not make a very large culture claim for the study. But 
this is far from being all; it is, in fact, but husk and rind, so far as culture 
is concerned. It would not be easy to name a division of the history of 
philosophy, or of the philosophy of history, that brings before the mind a 
richer store of facts, or a more interesting group of problems. 
First, educational systems in the legal sense are an important department 
of law, and an interesting branch of institutional history. Education is 
recognized in every one of our State constitutions, in some of them at much 
length; while our State school laws are among the most characteristic parts 
of American legislation. It is an obvious remark, that these laws reflect 
the character and temper of our people, and partake of the nature of our 
institutions as a whole. It may not be equally obvious that these laws, so 
far from being based on certain a priori principles, conform throughout to 
our local political institutions. 
For example, there are in the United States two radically different sys- 
tems of local government. In New England, the unit of government is the 
town; in the South, it is the county. In the one section, the county is used
-P-A-G-E-211
  VALUE OF THE HISTORY OF EDUCATION. . 211 
for judicial purposes only; in the other, the town is nothing but the juris- 
diction of a justice of the peace and an election district. A third system 
has sprung from the combination of these two. The compromise system of 
the old Middle States, and of the West, makes less of the town and more 
of the county than New England, and less of the county and more of the 
town than the Southern States. Our State school systems, corresponding to 
these large institutional facts, are also divisible into three groups. Until 
the recent Vermont legislation in relation to the county superintendency, I 
am not aware that the word “county.” was found in the school law of a 
single New England State. At the South, again, school officers and school 
machinery belong mainly to the county. And finally, the compromise- 
system States use both the town and the county for educational purposes, 
just as they do for the other objects of local government. 
Examples of the correspondence between school systems and their social 
and political environments are plentifully furnished by the states of Europe. 
In France and Germany, the administration of the schools and of educa- 
tion is highly centralized, like every other department of public affairs; 
while that vast piece of patch-work called the Elementary Education Acts 
illustrates as well, perhaps, as any legislation that can be mentioned, the 
slow process of evolution by which the institutions of England haye been 
produced, the heterogeneous elements of which they are composed, and the 
extreme conservatism of the English mind. 
Education, therefore, is deserving of study as a part of the institutions 
of nations. The education of youth is certainly a much more important 
element of civilization than the punishment of criminals; but educational 
institutions have been less studied than penal institutions by others than 
professional educators. 
In the second place, educational systems considered as mental and moral 
discipline are developments of ideas; they are born of philosophies, religions, 
civilizations. This can be shown adequately for the occasion by an outline 
map of the territory that the history of education covers. Frequently the 
division lines will overlap. But my object is to give a general view of the 
field, and not a close, logical analysis. 
1. How education has been influenced by particular civilizations. This 
inquiry would include the effects of national ideals, as those of Athens, 
Sparta and Rome in ancient times, and Prussia and America in modern 
times. It would embrace also the educational results of the caste system 
in the valley of the Nile, of democracy in the Grecian republics, of absolute 
monarchy in France under the ancien régime, of constitutionalism in Eng- 
land, and of republicanism in the United States. Nor would the inquiry 
end with the influence of the several factors in the particular countries 
where they existed; many of their most interesting results would be found 
in remote lands and in distant times. China did not make any contribu- 
tion to the current Western educational history until, a few years ago, we
-P-A-G-E-212

began to study her civil-service and her examination systems; but Greece, 
from her character and geographical position, has profoundly influenced 
the education of every Western country since the days that she sent her 
colonies to Italy, Gaul, and Spain. 
2. The educational effects of schools of thought. Exclusive of theology, 
human thought has moved in two main channels. The first Greek thinkers 
occupied themselves with physical problems. They sought to understand 
and to explain nature; but their explanations, as was natural, are now 
thought rather curious than valuable. Socrates at first studied the same 
subjects; but failing to reach results that satisfied him, and becoming con- 
vinced that the gods had withheld the causes of material things from the 
knowledge of men, he applied himself to human problems, and so became 
the founder of philosophy. His motto was, “Know thyself;” and although 
the scientific treatise of Aristotle and the physical discoveries of the Alex- 
andrian philosophers were promising anticipations of modern science, thought 
continued to flow mainly in the humanistic channel for. two thousand years, 
In the largest sense, Socrates was the first and the greatest of humanists. 
In the seventeenth century we come upon the main stream of the second 
great intellectual movement. In English-speaking countries, and in all 
countries where the empirical philosophy has made a deep impression, the 
name of Lord Bacon has been and still is more closely identified with this 
movement than that of any other thinker. In late years there has been a 
tendency to challenge Bacon’s claims, but we must in fairness acknowledge 
the force and justness of Professor Fowler’s words: “He called men as 
with the voice of a herald to lay themselves alongside of Nature, to study 
her ways, and imitate her processes. To use his own homely simile, he rang 
the bell which called the other wits together. Other men have said much 
the same thing in whispers, or in learned books written for a circle of select 
readers; but Bacon cried it from the housetops, and invited all men to come 
in freely and partake of the feast.. In one word, he popularized the study 
of nature. He insisted, both by example and precept, on the influence of 
experiment as well as observation. ' Nature, like a witness, when put to the 
torture, would reveal her secrets.”** Thus the name of Bacon stands for 
science as the name of Socrates stands for philosophy. It is impossible to 
name subjects more unlike than the subject-matter of philosophy and science. 
They present also strong differences of process and method in both inves- 
tigation and exposition. The historian of education is not concerned with 
these great intellectual movements as such, or with humanist or scientist ; 
but he is intimately concerned to know and to explain how they have affected 
the study of mind and shaped theories of human nature; how they have 
moulded educational ideals and furnished the materials of study; how they 
have influenced the scale of educational values, and determined methods of

teaching and school government. Who shall estimate the pedagogical. con- 
sequences of such Baconian utterances as these: “Man is the servant and 
the interpreter of nature;” “We can only conquer nature by first obeying 
her;” and, “The kingdom of man, which was founded on the sciences, can- 
not be entered otherwise than the kingdom of God—that is, in the spirit of 
a little child.” ‘ 
3. A still more particular inquiry as to philosophy is this: How has 
education been affected by its various systems, as the Platonic and the Aris- 
totelian; by sensationalism and idealism? 
4, How has education been influenced as respects its ideals, its subject- 
matter, its methods and custom, by the religions and churches of the world, 
and by particular movements and organizations within them? To be more 
specific, what has been the influence of historical Christianity, and of such 
currents within its wide stream as asceticism, scholasticism, mysticism, Prot- 
estantism, and the Catholic revival? M.de Laveleye, the distinguished 
Belgian publicist and economist, once said: “The Reformed religion rests 
on a book—the Bible.” ‘Catholic worship, on the contrary, rests upon 
sacraments and certain practices, such as confessions, masses, sermons.” 
What, if any, is the educational significance of these two facts? 
No man competent to deal with this fourth problem is likely to question 
that, as a whole, Christianity far transcends any other force or movement 
that has acted upon education. Consider for one moment the tremendous 
momentum that the enthusiasm of humanity has given to educational effort. 
“A new commandment I give unto you, that you love one another; as I 
have loved you, that ye also love one another.” Undoubtedly, men who 
approached education on the secular side have done educational work of 
very great value. But the men who have burned with educational zeal— 
the evangelists of new fields, the heroes of new conquests, the martyrs of 
the cause—have been Christian men, filled with the spirit of Him who was 
moved with compassion on the multitude, when He saw that they fainted 
and were scattered abroad as sheep having no shepherd. Nor, as the cen- 
turies pass away, does this flame burn less pure or bright. It warmed the 
heart of Pestalozzi as well as of St. Boniface. All in all, the educational 
influence of John Amos Comenius has been greater than that of any other 
man of recent times. And Comenius was a Moravian bishop, impelled in 
all his undertakings by the same spirit that sent some of his brethren 
as missionaries to the snows of Greenland, others to the forests of Ohio. 
“As Comenius increased in years,” says Professor Laurie, “the religious 
element in his educational theories assumed more and more prominence. 
But he never lost sight of his leading principles. The object of all educa- 
tion was to train children to be sons of God, but the way to do this was 
through knowledge, and knowledge was through method.” * 
5. Next may be mentioned the educational consequences flowing from the

intellectual eras or epochs; as the reaction of Greece upon Rome, the Re- 
naissance, the modern scientific era, the ascendency of the French mind in 
the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and the wonderful growth of Ger- 
man influence since the downfall of Napoleon. There are conjunctions in 
the world’s history where we find real new educations; such as the intro- 
duction of the Greek learning into Italy following the conquest of Greece, 
the introduction of ancient letters into western Europe, and the expansion 
of modern science. : 
6. The rationalistic movement. Rationalism, which Mr. Lecky well char- 
acterizes as, “not any class of. definite doctrines or criticisms, but rather a 
certain cast of thought, or bias of reasoning,” began with the revival of 
letters; but it has continued its resistless sweep until it has sapped the basis 
of authority, greatly weakened faith, swept vast mass of dogma into the 
limbo of things forgotten, set up new standards or modified old ones in 
almost every department of life, and fully restored to civilization the old 
Greek spirit of inquiry. How has this yeast not worked since the time 
when the disciples of Abelard prayed their master to give them “some phil- 
osophical arguments, such as were fit to satisfy their minds; begged that he 
would instruct them, not merely to repeat what he taught them, but to un- 
derstand”! How great the distance that separates us from the day when 
Scheiner, the monk, was told by his superior that he could not have seen 
spots on the sun, since Plato and Aristotle mentioned nothing of the kind 
in their writings! 
7. Then there is modern democracy, or the universal spirit, that, repudi- 
ating the old theological theories of government, and basing the state on the 
dogma of contract, has profoundly modified every department of life. 
8. The secularizing tendency, which, as well as democracy, is a part of 
the rationalistic movement, has changed educational ideals, broken up old 
courses of study and made new ones, and, to a very great extent, compelled 
the clergy to pass the educational torch to laic hands. 
9. Last of all may be mentioned material progress, perhaps the greatest 
fact ina time of great facts. The opening up to civilization of the vast 
regions of the earth unknown before the Age of Maritime Discovery, or 
unoccupied, together with the power over Nature that discovery and inven- 
tion have conferred upon man, has piled Ossa on Pelion until we no longer 
even guess what the surprises of the future will be. However, we shall 
hardly dissent from the opinion of Mr. Spencer: “Throughout the civilized 
world—especially in England, and above all in America—social activity 
is almost wholly expended in material development. To subjugate Nature, 
and bring the powers of production and distribution to their highest per- 
fection, is the task of our age; and probably of many future ages.” * It 
is true that material progress, like many other parts of modern civilization, 
is largely a product of modern education; but it has reacted upon its cause,   
* Essay on “The Morals of Trade.”
-P-A-G-E-215

changing ideals, substituting new subject-matter for old, and modifying the 
school methods. “It is impossible,” says Mr. Leckey, “to lay down a rail- 
way without creating an intellectual influence. It is probable that Watt 
and Stephenson will eventually modify the opinions of mankind almost as 
profoundly as Luther or Voltaire.”* While the transforming educational 
power of material progress has already been very great, it is certain to be 
still greater. Men are not wanting who tell us that an education based on 
books, no matter how it may have answered the demands of civilization 
hitherto, is ill-suited to the wants of an industrial and commercial age, and 
that we must create a new education based on things and manual processes. 
This is an extreme claim; but we readily see how it has originated, and why 
it is pressed with such persistence. 
But we must look at our subject under a third aspect. The school is a 
product of civilization, and historically a late one, later than the family, 
state, and church. But it has reacted with marked power and effect upon 
civilization, modifying its forms, changing its spirit, reconstructing its ideals, 
and altering its character. Moreover, this reflex influence is constantly 
growing in strength. More and more is the school-master getting abroad. 
Stronger and still stronger becomes the thread of education in the strand of 
civilized life. Formal argument is hardly called for to prove these propo~ 
sitions, but one or two historical illustrations will not be out of place. 
Says Mr. John Fiske: 
“The Puritan theory of life lay at the bottom of the whole system of popular ed- 
ucation in New England. According to that theory, it was absolutely essential that 
every one should be taught from early childhood how to read and understand the 
Bible. So much instruction as this, was assumed to be a sacred duty which the com- 
munity owed to every child born within its jurisdiction.” 
The results of the system of schools that sprang from this root idea are 
before the world. Mr. Fiske finds the same theory of life acting in Scot- 
land; “and he goes so far as to say: 
“And one need not fear contradiction in saying that no other people in modern 
times, in proportion to their numbers, have achieved so much in all departments of 
human activity as the people of Scotland have achieved. It would be superfiuous to 
mention the preéminence of Scotland in the industrial arts since the days of James 
Watt, or to recount the glorious names in philosophy, in history, in poetry and 
romance, and in every department of science, which, since the middle of the eigh- 
teenth century, have made the country of Burns and Scott, of Hume and Adam 
Smith, of Black and Hunter and Hutton and Lyell, illustrious for all future time.” ¢ 
Back of and causing all these splendid developments were the parish and 
burg schools that date from John Knox. Renan may have overstated the 
truth when he said the German universities conquered at Sedan; but all 
men recognize that education played a most important part in the tremen- 
dous war that, in 1870 and 1871, materially changed the map of Europe,   
*“ Rationalism in Europe,” 1, 8: August, 1866. 
+The Beginnings of New England, 151, 152: Boston, 1889.  
-P-A-G-E-216
216 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
and still more the adjustment of its political and military forces. On the 
opening of the Paris Exposition, two months ago, keen observers began at 
once to study the products there exhibited with reference to their educa- 
tional bearings. Moreover, they have promptly told us that they find clear 
proof that, in some lines, America is falling into the rear. Thus every day 
the impression deepens that education and schools are essential elements of 
national power and progress. 
There are certain divisions of knowledge a fair acquaintance with which 
is deemed essential to a well-educated man. Reference is not now made to 
the mere technical subjects that are taught in schools, as languages, math- 
ematics, and sciences; but to those more general branches of knowledge 
that constitute what we commonly call “general information,” and some- 
times “fact-lore.” Mention may be made of military history, politics, ma- 
terial progress, religion under its doctrinal and institutional forms, art, and 
literature. Now it cannot be denied, either that education is a subject of 
at least equal importance and dignity with these, or that it is much less 
understood. Educational knowledge has never taken rank with the other 
large divisions of knowledge; and, if the paradox may be allowed, educa- 
tion is the one great subject about which educated men generally are most 
ignorant. The fact is, of course, a part of that undervaluation of education 
which is so patent a fact in the history of civilization. Two series of facts 
will set the general proposition in a clear light. 
Intelligent men are almost universally ill-informed concerning contem- 
porary educational history. Men who can give you a particular account of 
the progress of political events in France since 1870, can give you no ac- 
count whatever of the almost equally remarkable series of educational 
“events. Americans understand German schools and education better than 
those of any other foreign country; and yet with the exception of a small 
number of cultured men this understanding is extremely vague and general. 
Men in numbers can explain, with much fullness and accuracy, that won- 
derful complex of precedents, documents and institutions which make up 
the English constitution, who know nothing of England in an educational 
aspect beyond the bare fact that it is the land of Oxford and Cambridge. 
Nor do we find a happier state of things when we change from contem- 
porary to historical events. Here at least, however, it must be confessed 
that the materials of information are not easy of access. The man who 
has never read the common books of history with the subject in mind can 
poorly appreciate their barrenness of such materials. One dependent solely 
upon these sources of information would hardly get the idea that there were 
schools and teachers in antiquity, or that they have been of much conse- 
quence in modern times. He will search the copious indexes of Grote’s, 
Thirlwall’s and Curtius’s histories of Greece in vain for the words “teacher,” 
“school,” “study,” and “education.” Merivale and Mommsen do better. 
Some very interesting views of Roman education are found in their works,
-P-A-G-E-217
  VALUE OF THE HISTORY OF EDUCATION. 217 
  
but by no means the full views that the student of educational history de- 
sires. Macaulay created a new historical school. He said the historian of 
England should be a combination of Henry Hallam and Sir Walter Scott. 
He introduced into his history—for example, into the celebrated third 
chapter—much material that writers before him had neglected and de- 
spised, thus imitating the artist mentioned by himself, who made the most 
beautiful window in the Cathedral of Lincoln out of bits of glass that his 
fellow-workmen had cast aside. And yet Macaulay did nothing for the 
history of education beyond some accounts of the universities, and a half 
page devoted to female education at the Restoration. Mr. J. R. Green, as 
he says in his preface, strives throughout that his book shall not sink into a 
drum-and-trumpet history. He gives more space to Chaucer than to Crecy, 
to Caxton’s press than to the Yorkist and Lancastrian strifes, to the rise of 
Methodism than to the Young Pretender; and still, except some interesting 
views of the universities, and the sentence, “The Sunday schools established 
by Mr. Raikes, of Gloucester, at the close of the [eighteenth] century, were 
the beginnings of popular education,” I recall nothing in his “Short His- 
tory,” or in its later expansion, directly touching the education of the Eng- 
lish people. Mr. Leckey does a little better; he gives between two and 
three pages in the last of his six volumes to popular education—which, by 
the way, is just twice the amount of space that he gives to the introduction 
of the umbrella into England. I know of no history of England that 
gives any account whatever of the ancient grammar schools, or of the great 
public schools that are such a very important factor in the civilization of 
the country. Even when full allowance has been made for the former feeble 
state of education, and particularly public education, such remissness as 
this is inexcusable. Apparently, war and politics are still themes so attract- 
ive as to draw the attention of historians from such a splendid theme as 
national education. 
Finally, to guard against possible misapprehension, a few words of cau- 
tion. It may be said that my program is too ambitious; that interesting 
and important as are the facts and problems presented, they belong to the 
history of civilization or philosophy rather than education; that they lie 
above the level of normal-school, or even of college and university teach- 
ing; and that they have more interest and value for the philosopher and 
the historian of philosophy than for the practical teacher and school officer. 
This view is not without truth. I have sought to assign to Education her 
proper place in the family of philosophical studies. No doubt my pro- 
gram is not at present fully attainable in even our best-equipped uni- 
versities. At the same time, this program should be kept in view as an 
ideal. No doubt our professors of the history of education must not allow 
their instruction to evaporate in philosophical speculations; they must re- 
member our practical aims, and especially our practical needs; they must 
keep the teacher’s school-room and the superintendent’s office constantly in  
-P-A-G-E-218

view. But if they are wise, they will at all times push their own studies 
along the higher levels of the subject; they will present their facts in the 
light of reason; they will be philosophical as well as pragmatical; they will 
not fail to connect educational facts and problems with the important phil- 
osophical, social, scientific and religious facts and problems with which they 
are so closely bound up. If at all fit to occupy his chair, the professor un- 
derstands that there are two classes of elements in the practice of educa- 
tion—the temporary and the permanent, the necessary and the contingent; 
he will by analysis separate these classes of elements, one from the other; 
and he will so establish his pupils in this distinction that they will not be 
apt to follow noisy educational prophets who, losing sight of this distine- 
tion, either fall into utter charlatanry or so exaggerate some elements of 
education as to make the whole product monstrous. The teacher of the 
history of education is the man to establish in the minds of those fitting to 
teach a proper educational perspective. 
THE PRACTICAL VALUE OF THE HISTORY OF EDUCA- 
TION IN LEGISLATION AND ADMINISTRATION. 
W. H. PAYNE, NASHVILLE, TENN. 
In common with history in general, the major value of the history of edu- 
cation is of the culture type; it extends the intellectual horizon, broadens 
the basis of human sympathy, fortifies effort by putting back of it the moral 
support of large ideas, and furnishes material for contemplative delight. 
But as the biographical part of general history suggests rules for personal 
good conduct, and as its higher generalizations determine the safer rules of 
statesmanship, so the history of education, in addition to its chief and char- 
acteristic office, has a lower and a higher education value of the practical 
type—its biographies may serve for personal guidance, and its larger gen- 
eralizations may determine the lines of educational policy in the way of 
administration and legislation. It is this aspect of the study that now 
claims our attention. 
The generalizations fit to serve as the basis for legislation should repre- 
sent the consensus of human opinion as expressed through long periods of 
time, and over wide areas of territory; for it may be assumed that a policy 
that has received the long sanction of the wise and the good has a large 
element of truth in it, and that for this season it is safe to apply it to the 
regulation and development of civil society. At this point it is necessary 
to hold fast to the distinction between what is local or special, and what is 
general or universal, and to recollect that the typical legislation is catholic, 
 
-P-A-G-E-219

based on large truths and calculated to serve universal needs. The moni- 
torial system grew out of local and narrow needs, and within this sphere it 
was defensible; but when, by forced effort, it was generalized into a system 
for whole peoples and continents it became an educational vice* The 
phenomenon of absorption is also worthy of notice. Twenty-five years ago 
object teaching was the fashionable educational craze, and was made the 
test of pedagogic orthodoxy. A whole literature sprang up in its wake, and 
it was thought by some that the final chapter in the educational envangel 
had been written; but the “system” has gone to the limbo of “good old 
has-beens,” and the books for the most part have gone out of sight and 
mind, save as curiosities of literature. Now there is an undoubted truth 
lying at the basis of object teaching, and it was perhaps well that this truth 
should be brought to popular recognition by developing it into a pretentious 
system; but it was soon discovered that all real instruction is vitalized by 
the principle involved in the object lesson; and now, though the “system” 
has disappeared, its spirit has been absorbed into the current of rational 
practice. 
What has preceded amounts to saying that practical education has been 
an experimental field for sprouting and testing new ideas, some of which 
were predestined to die from the very start, others to live for a time, and 
still others to a vigorous immortality. The history of education is strewed 
with wrecks of systems and exploded methods; but through all there are 
traceable the lines of eternal truth and the broad highways of rational 
practice. _ 
One of the best-established inferences from the history of education seems 
to be this: Wherever government has become democratic, education has become 
a function of the state; and as the tendency of civilization is toward free gov- 
ernment, the general tendency is toward universal education supervised and 
controlled by legislation. 
As we may notice in the “Rrpusuic,”’ a mere theory of democratic gov- 
ernment requires the interference of legislation in order to educate youth 
for the duties of citizens. Children belong to the state; they are officially 
examined at birth, the fit are allowed to live, the unfit are exposed, or, accord- 
ing to modern euphemism, “removed ;” attendance at school is compulsory, 
and the pursuit of certain studies, as arithmetic, is enforced by law. The 
citizenship of the ideal state must be cast in a common mould, and this mould 
is the common school, a civil institution created and administered by legis- 
lative act. 
What Plato found necessary in theory, the French revolutionists found 
necessary in fact. When autocratic government had been destroyed, and 
the experiment of democratic government was to be tried, a conspicuous

part of the new organization was lay instruction, created and controlled by. 
law; the citizenship of the new republic must be cast in the republican 
mould, and this mould was the common school. 
In England, progress in popular government has been followed, almost 
part passu, by progress in popular education administered and aided by 
Parliament. When ignorance holds the ballot, it becomes a peril which 
must be removed by the exercise of authority. Self-preservation is the first 
law of civil society as well as of nature, and in all democratic societies the 
condition of self-preservation is universal enlightenment. It may be predi- 
cated as a general law that all forms of absolutism are best promoted by 
popular ignorance, and that the very condition of democratic government is 
universal intelligence. 
-A second induction from the course of educational history is that, sooner 
or later, some form of compulsion must be employed to secure that kind and 
degree of popular education which is demanded for the safety and progress 
of free societies. In theory, Plato employed compulsion; it was resorted to 
by the ancient Hebrews; has been enforced for a long period by Prussia;- 
has been found nécessary in every free government in Europe; and in some 
form is embodied in the legislation of seventeen of the American States. 
There is no country in the world where compulsory school attendance is of 
such vital necessity as in the United States. This is due to the joint fact of 
the great extension of the right of suffrage and of the peculiar nature of our 
population, the most heterogeneous on the face of the earth. We not only 
receive vast shoals of ignorant, degraded and vicious immigrants, but in 
many cases these aliens constitute distinct societies in our large cities, which 
are in reality foreign colonies planted on American soil. It would be thought 
a reckless experiment to allow the residents of a Bohemian or a Polish vil- 
lage to cast their votes for the municipal officers of an American city; but 
- this, in kind, is just what is going on in all the chief cities of this country. 
I see but one remedy for this imminent peril, and this is to cause this heter- 
ogeneous material to pass through the mould of the American public school. 
We must resort to the historical remedy of compulsion. 
The undoubted right of the state to require of each future citizen a cer- 
tain kind and amount of instruction, necessarily carries with it the right to 
supervise and in some degree to control the instruction given in private 
schools. Under date of December 17, 1888, a Chicago paper reported the 
following: 
“Der Freisinnige Schulverein, which may be translated as the Free-Thinking 
School Society, was organized yesterday afternoon at a meeting of anarchists and 
socialists. With the ultimate design of forming a system of day schools as well, its 
object for the present is the establishment of secular Sunday schools in Chicago. 
Discarding the Bible as unfit to be put into the hands of children, it proposes to 
teach, as a substitute, history, science, and socialism. The movement is part of the 
most important work now in progress among the socialists of the country. Similar 
organizations are perfecting in New York, Milwaukee, and other cities.”

  VALUE OF THE HISTORY OF EDUCATION. 221 
  
Here is a concrete and typical illustration of one of the imminent perils 
of free immigration, and a comment on the remark just made, that state 
supervision and control of private schools is justifiable in theory, and may 
become necessary in fact. Churches and other corporations certainly have 
the right to establish schools; but there may be cases where what they teach 
or what they fail to teach may become the subject of official scrutiny by the 
state. 
There has been an historical development of a typical public-school 
system. This was proposed as a theory by Comenius, was realized as a 
practical fact by Prussia, and has been copied by the States of the North- 
west organized since 1836. The most perfect realization of this typical 
public-school system has been made by Michigan and Minnesota, though the 
general plan is seen in other States—as in Wisconsin, Iowa, Texas, and 
West Virginia. The three main elements of this system are a university, 
secondary or high schools in cities and villages, and an indefinite number 
of common schools, all correlated somewhat as the cerebrum, the cerebellum, 
and the nervous ganglia of the human system are. The perggnial source of 
inspiration and strength is the university; and wherever it is weak, or 
wherever it is not vitally correlated with secondary schools, public educa- 
tion will languish, and the general movement will be labored and halting, 
stationary, or retrogressive. Practical legislation will consist in establishing 
universities where they do not exist, in strengthening universities that are 
weak, and in bringing the three parts of the system into vital correlation. 
One of the most hopeful incidents.of modern educational history is the 
resumption by universities of one of their ancient functions—that of sup- 
plying the world with teachers. It is well known that in the ancient uni- 
versities a Bachelor must have taught as a necessary condition of graduation, 
and that a Master must have made a pledge to teach after his graduation. 
There is but little hope for a system of public instruction which is not ani- 
mated by the university spirit. Fifty years ago the typical Scotch school- 
master held a diploma from Glasgow, Edinburgh, or Aberdeen, and the 
Scotch were the best-educated people in Europe; but a decadence in public 
education set in when a lower and narrower grade of learning was substi- 
tuted for university training. 
The modern normal school has brought with it many undoubted advan- 
tages and blessings; but to the extent to which it has substituted method 
for broad scholarship as a preparation for teaching, it has abased the stand- 
ard of instruction. There is some ground for thinking that method has 
become a sort of fetich. Certain it is that a modicum of learning secured 
by an expeditious patent process, eked out by school-room devices, and sup- 
ported by that assurance which often accompanies ignorance —it is certain, 
I say, that this vile pretense has in some instances brought normal schools 
and normal instruction into contempt, and is the greatest obstacle to a high 
grade of professional instruction. The characteristic function of these

0s “independent” institutions is the perpetuating of the race of pedants. They 
thrive best where the state has not organized and endowed institutions for 
the education of teachers, and particularly where university training of a 
high type has not made its catholic influence felt. The history of education 
for the last century has shown that public education is in its most satis- 
factory condition where the lower schools are vitalized and inspired by the 
university spirit, and where the state has organized normal schools for the 
purpose of giving to the common schools teachers whose academic training 
is of the secondary type. The spirit of this paragraph is embodied in this 
quotation from Chancellor Tappan: 
“Where only the lower grades of education are found, a nation must ever remain 
imperfect in its civilization, must fail in the higher ends of social and national ex- 
istence, and must be in a condition of servile dependence upon the cultivated nations 
for those works of science, art and literature which are indispensable to even mate- 
rial prosperity. But more than this, where only the lower grades of education are 
found, even these cannot be brought to perfection. The highest institutions are 
necessary to supply the proper standard of education, to raise up instructors of the 
proper qualifigations, to define the principles and methods of education, to furnish 
cultivated men to the professions, to civil life, and to the private walks of society, 
and thus to diffuse everywhere the educational spirit. The common school can be 
perfected only through competent teachers; these can be provided only by institu- 
tions like the normal school, which belong to the intermediate or second grade of 
education. But the teachers of the normal schools, again, require other and higher 
institutions to prepare them, such at least as the academy, gymnasium, or college; 
and these, the highest forms of the intermediate grade, can only look to the univer- 
sity for a supply of instructors.” 
“He who has passed through a common school is not fitted to teach a common 
school. He who has passed through a normal school is not prepared to teach a 
normal school. He who has passed through a union school or an academy is not 
prepared to teach it. The graduate of a college is not prepared to become a college 
professor. But the direct object of a university is to prepare men to teach in the 
university itself or in any other institution. Hence, those who in the university be- 
come doctors—which simply means teachers—are by that degree admitted to the 
vocation of a university instructor.” * 
From the practical point of view, the history of popular education is a 
history of school supervision. The turning-point of success in a system of 
public instruction is intelligent supervision of the scientific type; and the 
question of questions from the administrative point of view is, how to en- 
courage the education, training and selection of a body of efficient school 
superintendents—state, county, city, and township. I think the singular 
fact must be admitted that the contemporary normal school does not pro- 
duce men and women of such catholic and original structure as to make 
them capable of moulding educational opinion and practice in accordance 
with rational ideals. I believe that the highest type of professional ability 
is requisite for wise supervision. It is a vulgar error to imagine that a good 
teacher is certain to be a good superintendent. It is more certain that a   
* Annual Report to Board of Regents of the University of Michigan, 1856,

liberally-educated, broad-minded lawyer is better qualified for state super- 
vision that even an excellent teacher or school principal who has not the 
main qualities of the statesman. In its wider aspects, school supervision 
might be defined as educational statesmanship. 
Current history shows that the most hazardous of liberal employments is 
city school superintendence. Probity, competence and efficiency seem not 
only to be no safeguards against arbitrary removal, but even prejudicial to 
tenure of office. 
In all state systems of public instruction, the point of greatest weakness 
is in what may be called the lower supervision—that is, township and 
county. It is charitable to say that a great part of this is worthless. Mere 
education will not remedy this evil, but vigorous legislation which will put 
a premium on education. 
The general vice that runs through all supervision, especially the higher, 
is lack of authority. In the United States there is not centralization enough 
in educational affairs. For example, a state superintendent should be much 
less than an autocrat, but much more than a clerk. As a rule, he is merely 
a clerk. 
Ancient Jewish education was characterized by the intense spirit of 
nationality or patriotism which it inspired; and this spirit has survived 
eighteen centuries of disaster and dispersion, and to-day we have the 
curious spectacle of a nation without a country. The Roman virtus was 
in great part the result of Roman education, a most important feature of 
which was the memorizing of the twelve tables. The Englishman abroad 
misses no opportunity to remind strangers of that magnificent empire on 
which the sun never sets; and wherever he goes, in Asia, Africa, or America, 
his ardent loyalty ever sings the praises of queen and country. 
I fear that there may be ground for thinking that the American public 
school has not set before itself the distinct aim of imbuing all its pupils with 
an intelligent and ardent patriotism. It is not to be supposed that mere 
legislation can inspire the young with patriotic emotions and purposes; but 
it should be counted as a distinctive aim of public-school administration, 
through history, geography, literature and civics, to furnish the nation with 
loyal, country-loving citizens. 
These are a few of what might be called obvious “indications” of the 
history of education.

8. G. WILLIAMS, ITHACA, NEW YORK. 
Our present standpoint of educational attainment is obviously the result 
of past efforts. Our entire stock of effective appliances, of approved methods, 
of tested and confirmed principles, and of valued schemes of organization,
-P-A-G-E-224

has its roots in the past, and often a very remote past; as have also the 
various branches of learning which are used as means of intellectual train- 
ing. So, too, the means which are suited for the higher and more important 
work of developing character, have been discussed and tested by our prede- 
cessors; their fitness and the conditions under which they are useful have 
been in some degree ascertained; and the limits of their efficiency have been 
measurably determined. 
Viewed therefore in the most general way, we should reasonably expect 
that an acquaintance with the history of education would be of great value 
to all teachers who aim to be something better than mere slaves of routine 
—and happily the number of such teachers is rapidly increasing. Not only 
is it true that “the better one knows the rules and principles of his art, the 
more boldly he practices them,” but also it is certain that the more thor- 
oughly one understands as teacher the history of the methods he uses, of the 
principles that he applies, and of the branches that he teaches, the bolder, 
more intelligent, more ingeniously varied, and more efficient will be likely 
to be all his operations, and the greater the probability of beneficial im- 
provement; whilst the possibility that he may be tempted, by a false notion 
of originality, to the repetition of discredited experiments will be reduced 
to a minimum. 
1. What is doubtless the most valuable and essential service that may be 
rendered to teachers by familiarity with the history of education, is one that 
is but too likely to be overlooked, viz.: the enhancement of the ability to 
take a broad and unprejudiced view of pedagogical questions. The acknowl- 
edged tendency of the teacher’s vocation is to produce a certain limitation of 
ideas to a narrow circle, and to foster prejudices in favor of certain familiar 
lines of work, or certain usual modes of doing work. This tendency is inci- 
dent to the very nature of his calling, which brings him into intimate con- 
tact chiefly with immature minds, and usually limits his professional activity 
to the elements of a few branches, which, when they become familiar, seem 
to the narrowed vision to fill the entire round of desirable knowledge. From 
this limitation of view, since narrowness is proverbially zealous, spring an 
_ abundance of pedagogical treatises, discussions and polemics, which too com- 
monly are pretentious rather than valuable, and which by their distortion 
and exaggeration of some phase of truth produce all the effects of error. 
Such works have given occasion to a writer, in a recent issue of an influen- 
tial journal of education, to say with some display of bitterness, in treating of 
“Low Tone in Teachers”: “There is another incubus upon us that may be 
noted in a word, and that is pedagogical literature. The educational psychol- 
ogists offer us the most dreadful impositions upon simple-minded teachers 
who are not learned in philosophy. . . . Of books on general pedagogy, 
almost all should be eschewed: the attempt to read them is purely injurious.” 
It is to be hoped that this statement is a pedagogical exaggeration — an illus- 
tration of a tendency to exaggerate so strong as to display itself even in a 
rebuke of the results of distorted and one-sided views.
-P-A-G-E-225
VALUE OF THE HISTORY OF EDUCATION. 225 
The most effectual corrective to the tendency in question is to be found 
in such an enlargement of the horizon of thought and of the limitations of 
individual experience, as is likely to be gained by a thoughtful study of the 
history of education. There we may see depicted gropings after improve- 
ment and conflicts of opinion, which were possibly no more futile or causeless 
than those in which we are actors. In its pages we may, with unprejudiced 
vision, see mirrored the images of struggles wholly analogous to our own 
“conflict of studies” and of ideas—the struggle of scholasticism against the 
noble monuments of classic literature; the struggle of Latinists against the 
growing literary use of vernacular tongues; the struggle against the culti- 
vation of mathematical science in old European universities; the stolid re- 
sistance of the barbaric methods of mere memory-cramming, which, in the 
witty words of Montaigne, made of boys “mere asses loaded with books, to 
whom, with blows of a whip, was given a pocketful of science, not to use 
but to keep,” to all efforts to utilize the youthful instinct for a knowledge 
of nature, and so to gain access to the memory through the understanding; 
in brief, the perennial warfare which in every age is waged by a narrow 
conservatism entrenched in prescriptive use against even the most enlight- 
ened efforts for a closer conformity to nature in methods, or for a truer 
conformity to the present state of culture in the choice of the subject-matter 
of studies. If such a study should serve as a salutary warning against our 
reluctance to reconsider and, if need be, to revise our means and methods of 
instruction, and against our natural disposition to think that what we are 
accustomed to is part of the necessary scheme of things; if it should dispose 
us to take a broad and unprejudiced yet not hasty view of all educational 
questions, a view in which self counts for little and the advancement of our 
profession for much; if it should incline us to lay a less exclusive emphasis 
on attainment, and more on the development of character; and if, further- 
more, as in all other vocations which have to deal with vital human interests, 
it should confer that justness of judgment, that unerring sagacity, that open- 
ness of mind to consider all questions impartially on their merits, and that 
far-seeing comprehensiveness of intelligence which views subjects in all their 
bearings, thus making teachers truly statesmen in all that concerns their 
calling, who will say that the history of education would not do to our pro- 
fession a service of the greatest possible moment? 
2. The study of educational history can hardly fail to enhance in every 
true teacher his sense of the dignity and importance of his calling, in its re- 
lations not merely to the welfare of individuals but to the elevation and 
true greatness of societies and states. It will reveal to him how closely 
every advance in civilization has been correlated with a corresponding ad- 
vance in the education of youth —a correlation so intimate that it would be 
difficult to determine which is effect and which cause. This relation is 
shown not merely in the effects of education, recently somewhat studied, in 
increasing the efficiency of labor and in diminishing those twin blots on
-P-A-G-E-226

civilization — pauperism and crime; but, on a broader scale, in the entire 
history of civilization and of education. In this it becomes manifest that 
the depth and validity of any civilization can be truly estimated only by the 
thoroughness with which all social ameliorations and humanitarian develop- 
ments reach and permeate the masses of the community through an efficient 
education. For a civilization may easily be very brilliant, and yet exceed- 
ingly superficial; it may exhibit a high degree of perfection of social arrange- 
ments, the benefits of which may reach but a very limited class; it may be 
adorned by many individual examples of refinement and elevation of senti- 
ment and of nobleness of character; it may be made illustrious by a brilliant 
and enduring literature; and yet beneath this shining exterior may seethe 
a vast mass of popular ignorance, superstition and semi-barbarism. Such 
civilizations, whose benefits are limited to a small educated class, either 
perish from their own limitations, or are forced by intestine convulsions to 
educate and elevate the masses as a condition of their own continuance. 
The vital influence of education on national welfare, which the Germans 
have embodied in the well-known maxim that whatever you would make 
deeply influential in a nation’s life you must first embody in the education 
of a nation’s youth, is no discovery of modern times. Plato and Aristotle, 
the two greatest philosophers of antiquity, show their thorough comprehen- 
sion of it by incorporating their weighty views on education in treatises of 
political philosophy, of which they clearly saw that it is an essential part. 
Plato was so deeply impressed with its importance, that in two remarkable 
passages of “The Laws” he proposes that the education of all citizens of both 
sexes should be made compulsory; and, despairing of the stability of states on 
any other terms, he would even fix its subject-matter by unalterable laws. 
This lofty view of education as the twin sister of civilization, and as the 
most vital factor in the elevation and transformation of societies and states, 
needs to be deeply impressed on the consciousness of every teacher, that he 
may rise to the full dignity of his calling; and in no way can it be so 
effectually inculcated as by a thoughtful study of the history of education: 
for here, as elsewhere, the well-known maxim of Seneca holds good, “Longum 
iter est per precepta, breve et efficax per exempla.” Already we are begin- 
ning to utilize this powerful reformatory influence in instruction on the 
nature and effects of stimulants, in impressing on young minds the impor- 
tance of the preservation of forests by the exercises of Arbor Day, and in 
inculeating respect for labor by some training in constructive work. We 
shall do our duty in these and other respects more efficiently, the more 
deeply we are penetrated with a sense of the far-reaching effects of all im- 
pressions made on youthful minds. 
3. Akin to what has just been considered, is the value of the historic les- 
son that education like civilization has been a gradual evolution, whose 
progress has been marked by a growing adaptation of man, at first to his 
physical and then to his social and spiritual environment. The course of 
 
-P-A-G-E-227
  VALUE OF THE HISTORY OF EDUCATION. 227 
  
this evolution may indicate to the educator along what lines future efforts 
for improvement should be made, and how they may be made successful. 
It should teach him not to undervalue physical development and a famil- 
iarity with nature’s laws, through obedience to which alone man has been 
enabled to make nature subservient to his will. It will assure him that 
when he habituates children and youth to social requirements and to obedi- 
ence to justly-exerted authority, he is taking no mean step toward their 
complete spiritual development and emancipation. So too, the slowness of 
progress, in which the Divine will has determined that every advance step 
shall be fixed by heredity and made permanent only by the slow lapse of 
time, may serve to restrain his impatience when his duty calls him to labor, 
as it often must, amidst ignorant and relatively undeveloped surroundings; 
and may give him the needful courage to work in God’s own way, patiently 
elevating one generation, if but a little, that the succeeding generation may 
start from a somewhat higher level. 
4. Again, if the past has taught any lesson with more than usual clearness, 
it is this: that the hopes of our race for a brighter and happier future de 
pend solely on the increasing culture of the largest possible number of its 
members; and that this culture must receive its impulse from the higher 
centers of learning. Nay, more: it teaches that every step of educational 
progress has resulted not from the efforts of ambitious ignorance to struggle 
upward, but from a helpful influence reaching downward from what is 
highest in education, and aiding to lift toward itself masses otherwise inert 
and unprogressive; and that hence the chief hope of mankind for intellectual 
and spiritual elevation must be found in the spread and activity of high-class — 
schools. And this is precisely what might be expected; for, without such 
stimulus, the.average unlettered man is but dimly conscious of his limita- 
tions and of his higher needs, if indeed he has any consciousness of them at 
all. Feeling keenly only the wants and knowing only the enjoyments which 
appeal to the lower side of his nature, unless some impulse comes to him 
from above, rousing him to an ennobling discontent and pointing him to 
gratifications for the higher nature that is dormant within him, what hope 
can be found for his elevation? Give now to this man even no more than 
the ability to read fluently, and at once the horizon of his life is enormously 
enlarged and his pleasures elevated, by bringing him into a possible com- 
munion with the brightest spirits of all times; and every added enlargement 
of his mental and spiritual culture, by increasing his capability of deriving 
a larger pleasure from the best stores of the past and present and by en- 
hancing his sense of personal dignity, diminishes measurably the temptation 
to satisfy himself with low and sensual enjoyments. But-this elevating 
stimulus comes always from the highest culture of the times: thus Solon and 
Socrates, Plato and Aristotle in Greece; the emigrant Greeks in Rome; the 
Saracens in their great Spanish schools; the scholars whom the early uni- 
versities of Italy, France and England sent widely over Europe; Luther
-P-A-G-E-228
228 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  
  and Melanchthon, Sturm and Comenius in Germany; Erasmus and Ramus 
and Montaigne and the self-sacrificing La Salle in France and Holland; and 
Bacon, Milton and Locke in England—not to mention less prominent 
worthies, nor those of more recent days, all men endowed with the best 
learning which their times afforded—have scattered the beneficent seeds 
from which has sprung the widely-diffused culture that we enjoy; a culture 
whose fruits reach or may reach the humblest homes. 
From this, the teacher versed in educational history may gain a higher 
motive, not only for cherishing and defending secondary schools when he 
hears their interests assailed on the low grounds of supposed present utility, 
but for reverencing all higher seats of learning, and hailing with joy their 
advancement, being assured that as they rise they will not only elevate with - 
them the entire system of schools below, but will illumine a wider horizon 
with a brighter radiance. 
5. To these highly valuable yet, possibly, somewhat renfote considerations . 
which the study of educational history will be likely to press upon the at- 
tention of teachers, may be added some of a more immediate character, in 
the way partly of suggestion, partly of caution. Assuredly the history of 
Greek education should direct our attention forcibly to the need of a greater 
care in the cultivation of our vernacular, and in familiarizing our youth 
with the treasures of its literature. We shall learn that the Athenian 
schoolmaster bestowed admirable care on securing purity of pronunciation, 
of accent and of rythm in his pupils, and promoting an exact and harmoni- 
ous use of their native tongue; that the poems of Homer were their inspired 
reading-book, to which were added the works of the cyclic and lyric poets, 
and other gems of their national literature; and that, from the lack of 
books, much of this literature was firmly imprinted on the memory of youth, 
‘there to germinate and bear its fruit in an unsurpassed national taste. A 
large part of the scholastic training of boys was thus in the literature of 
their language; and Plato deemed the careful selection of this literature of 
so great moment, from the permanence of the impressions made on young 
minds, that he devotes a considerable part of the second and third books of 
the “Republic” to an exposition of the principles that should govern the 
selection of reading for the young. He plainly indicates, both here and 
in “The Laws,” that the multitudinous writers whose books infest all the 
highways and bypaths of modern literature, warping the ideas and lower- 
ing the taste of youth, would have had but a sorry reception in his ideal 
state, in which the teacher was expected so to preoccupy the minds of the 
young with what was best in both poetry and prose, that there would be no 
encouragement for the writing of trash. 
The practice of the Athenians, and its well-known results, should suggest 
to us the expediency of early directing the minds of children to such of our 
best authors as are most. nearly level to their comprehension, trusting that 
if at first they do not clearly understand, they may at least feel their excel- 
 
-P-A-G-E-229

  lence, as was said by the erratic Rousseau of the literature by which his 
young fancy was nourished; indeed, it should be said that more mature 
minds, even, meet many things in the best books which they feel rather 
than fully understand, and which must await the chance of some favoring 
experience for their complete elucidation. Should the Athenian example 
need a more recent enforcement, it may be found in the well-known preva- 
lence among educated Frenchmen of a keen sense for literary form, due 
largely, no doubt, to the continuing influence in the best French schools of 
Rollin’s “Traité des Etudes,” in which the careful teaching of the mother 
tongue, with exposition of its best literature, is strongly emphasized and 
clearly illustrated. : 
I of course know full well that a movement in the right direction has 
already been initiated among us, and that, as is usual, it has received its 
most vigorous impulse from our higher institutions of learning. How much 
of depth or extent this movement has, many of you have good means of 
knowing; but it is certain that it is accompanied by the discouraging inti- 
mation that our teachers are unable to present fitly the best specimens of 
our literature without the aid of editions stuffed to twice or thrice their 
original bulk with explanatory notes, mostly on points that should need no 
explanation. A distinguished professor of English literature very recently 
said to me, that such editions are admirably fitted to repress all literary 
taste. Let'us hope that our teachers may soon vindicate their ability to 
present the literature of their mother tongue without such adventitious 
aids. Probably few things that may be taught in our schools are of such 
transcendent importance as the inculcation of a taste for good reading; 
and none seems to be more generally neglected. The example of the 
ancient Greeks may teach us a most valuable lesson in this regard. 
6. This same Athenian example may also serve, both to diminish some- 
what our confidence in the efficacy of mere grammar study in promoting 
practical skill in the use of our language, and to lessen the emphasis with 
which we are wont to demand the study of other languages, not only for 
their utility and as a means of intellectual culture, but also as well-nigh 
indispensable for the mastery of our vernacular, and for assuring correctness 
of taste. For it was long after Greek literature had passed the meridian 
of its splendor, before the first Greek grammar,* or indeed any formal 
grammar made its appearance. The grammar of the Greek school-boy was 
literary study, without any formal separation of words into classes or analy- 
sis of their relations, things which even the wisest philosophers had not yet 
fully conceived. They learned to use their language correctly by persistent 
practice; they acquired delicacy of taste by familiarity with good models. 
Likewise the Greeks neither knew nor cared to understand any language 
but their own; and yet, knowing only their own language, their poets,

orators, and philosophers are still considered almost unapproachable models 
of literary excellence. 
Here let me not be misconceived by any enthusiastic grammarian or poly- 
linguist; nor let a covert attack upon favorite branches, which is by no 
means intended, be read into this paragraph. Probably few who hear me 
value such studies more highly than I, for their undeniable merits. They 
are, when rightly employed, a very effective means of intellectual discipline; 
and, in the case of many, they become essential as sources of valuable 
knowledge; but the assumption that their study is indispensable to the for- 
mation of a correct and delicate taste, or to gaining the mastery of one’s 
vernacular, is shown to be untrue, not merely by prominent individual ex- 
amples, but by the history of a nation remarkable for its literary excellence. 
Such a fact should lead us all to a truer estimate of the value of our mother 
tongue, and to a more discriminate and effective use of its resources, not 
only in the attractive presentation of its literature, but also in securing 
from pupils its correct use, and its enrichment during the entire period of 
their school life. In this respect, our German brethren, orthodox classicists 
as they are, could teach us a valuable lesson. It is poor educational econ- 
omy, to say the least, to bestow so much time on the study of formal gram- 
mar, which is only a means, as to leave little or none for those exercises 
that serve to rectify and enlarge the pupil’s use of speech, which is the end; 
or to neglect the literary treasures of our own language, that we may impart 
to pupils a knowledge too often very imperfect, of some other language. 
The very proper and reasonable time limit fixed for such dissertations as 
this, will preclude me from doing more than hint at some further sugges- 
tions which the perusal of educational history will be likely to convey to 
intelligent teachers, without going into even the small amount of illustration 
that has thus far been attempted. I will therefore mention a few points 
very briefly. | c 
7. Much emphasis is just now rightly laid in many quarters on the teach- 
ing of civics in our schools. The history of Roman education in the better 
days of the republic, illustrates well the importance of such instruction; 
both Plato and Aristotle strongly enforce it as essential to good citizenship, 
as do also our own Milton and Locke, and not a few others. 
8. The advocates of manual training will be pleased to meet the views 
of their early friends, in the proposal of Sir William Petty, 1647, and in 
the works of Comenius and Locke, Rousseau and Pestalozzi; and to note 
the well-omened and successful efforts of Ferdinand Kindermann, 1771, to 
elevate the condition of the Bohemian peasantry by introducing into the 
schools. which he established, rural employments and feminine handiwork. 
9. The power and the extent of influence of moral and religious ideas, 
which will be found to give a strong coloring to all educational systems, 
and even to condition their form in many oriental nations, should rivet the 
attention of teachers on the necessity of sparing no pains in the development
-P-A-G-E-231

of a right type of character, a duty of the very first importance, and yet 
which they are but too apt to neglect amid the wearing preoccupations of 
the school-room. 
10. We are repeatedly reminded how much for success or failure depends 
on the personality of the teacher, until the well-worn lesson falls on un- 
heeding ears. With what new force then does not this lesson strike us, 
when it.is embodied in the life-history of men like Ratich and Basedow, 
both gifted with unusual ability, and the originators of great and promising 
educational projects, yet both doomed to failure by the defects of their moral 
organization; or, when we see Pestalozzi emerging from the ruins of all 
his undertakings—ruins caused by his various “unrivaled incapacities” 
and limitations—his head crowned with a garland of victory by virtue of 
“his inexhaustible love for the people, his pure heart, his glowing enthusi- 
asm, and his restless efforts and sacrifices for human welfare through human 
culture.” 
11. A caution against supposing that all that is now worth knowing 
should be crowded into-our school programs, may be conveyed to us by the 
history of all earlier schools, in which men so disciplined their powers as to 
become wise and great, by diligent attention to a list of studies which we 
would think meager— possibly finding it even an advantage that subjects 
were so few as to leave the current of their progress to an untroubled flow. 
12. And, finally, the pains-taking care that we may see exercised in more 
recent times, by the wisest and most experienced educators, in weighing, 
selecting, proportioning, and arranging the schemes of study for great com- 
munities, should be, to those among us who are charged with the adminis- 
tration of schools, both an aid and an encouragement in the discharge of 
their difficult and perplexing duties, inspiring them to labor zealously and 
prudently in building up what will ultimately be a great American system . 
of schools—the best and most effective, let us hope, that the world has 
hitherto seen. 
Such, then, are some of the aids, the suggestions and the inspirations 
which the history of education can offer to all teachers who will study it 
aright. Will they not richly repay the trouble of securing?

W. H. VENABLE, CINCINNATI, OHIO. 
When the embattled farmers at Concord Bridge “fired the shot heard 
round the world,” the swift report, flying westward, saluted the ears of a 
party of hunters encamped near the Kentucky river. These, one of whom

was Simon Kenton, were genuine “Long Knives,” rangers, clad in garments 
stripped from the deer, the bear, and the wolf, and armed each with rifle, 
tomahawk, and scalping-knife. By patriotic consent they named the place 
of their encampment Lexington, and four years later, in April, 1779, a vil- 
lage was begun on the spot. Founded but five years after Boone led the 
vanguard of immigration through Cumberland Gap, and broke the old wil- 
derness road through primeval solitude, Lexington is only less ancient than a 
few stations like Harrodsburg and Boonesborough. It is now but one hun- 
dred and ten years since the pioneers, “chopping out the night, chopped in 
the morn,” and took the forest trees to fashion the rude stockade which was 
the beginning of the “Athens of the West.” The town is interesting his- 
torically as having been a center of traffic in early days—a place of im- 
* portance when Cincinnati was but Fort Washington. 
A higher distinction than that derived from its rapid material growth 
belongs to this town. Thither from the East, with commerce, went culture. 
There was formed the first island of civilization in the green ocean of the 
Western wilderness. Just outside the fort the settlers built a school-house 
—perhaps the first in the Ohio Valley. The stockade was a defense against 
savages, the school-house a redoubt against ignorance and a magazine for 
mental stores. John McKinney, the schoolmaster, deserves a monument or 
a statue. One morning John, waiting for his pupils, was surprised by a 
visit from a most unwelcome examiner, a monstrous wildcat, which stealthily 
came in at the open door and sprang at the pedagogical throat. The un- 
armed man of letters, after a terrific combat, killed the powerful beast by 
choking and crushing it upon his desk; and while its fierce teeth were yet 
locked in the flesh of his side, he said placidly to some men who rushed to 
his rescue, “Gentlemen, I have killed a cat.” The progress of civilization 
is symbolized by the picture of McKinney slaying the wildcat in the rude 
hut dedicated to the education of children. 
About the year 1783 there appeared upon the scene of affairs in Kentucky 
a schoolmaster from the banks of the Brandywine—another John, whose 
figure, like that of McKinney, stands in picturesque relief in the mixed 
light of history and tradition. He wrote the first annals of Kentucky, and 
surveyed the first road from Lexington to Cincinnati, or Losantiville, as 
he named the town; he it was who, in the Kentucky Gazette, proposed to 
organize a seminary in Lexington, in which should be taught the “French 
language, with all the arts and sciences used in the academies,” for a fee of 
“five pounds per annum, one-half’ cash, and the other property,” and who 
offended certain citizens by announcing his intention to employ “Northern 
teachers;” John Filson, who, a century ago, wandered from his comrades, 
encamped on the northern shore of the Ohio, and took a lonely walk in the 
Big Miami woods—a walk from which he never returned. Conjecture says 
he was killed by Indians; but nothing authentic is known of his fate, nor 
was any trace of him ever seen after the day of his mysterious departure.
-P-A-G-E-233

“Deep in the wild and solemn woods, 
Unknown to white man’s track, 
John Filson went one autumn day, 
But never more came back. 
“The Indian, with instinctive hate, 
In him a herald saw 
Of coming hosts of pidneers, 
The friends of light and law. 
“In him beheld the champion 
Of industries and arts; 
The founder of encroaching roads 
And great commercial marts: 
“The spoiler of the hunting-ground, 
The plower of the sod, 
The builder of the common school 
And of the house of God. 
“And so the vengeful tomahawk 
John Filson’s blood did spill: 
The spirit of the pedagogue 
No tomahawk could kill.” 
The founders of our nation, whether residing in New England, the Middle 
States, or the South, were advocates and promoters of popular education. 
Franklin, Washington, the Adamses, Jefferson, however they might differ 
on other questions, were united in the conviction expressed by Washington 
to Congress, that “ Knowledge in every country is the surest basis of public 
happiness.” Jefferson’s writings are saturated with the doctrine that learn- 
ing and thought are the safeguards of democracy. National and state legis- 
lation planned schools in the wilderness, and provided for their support by 
grants of land, the one thing most valuable in a new country. 
In the year 1780, the Legislature of Virginia passed “An Act to vest cer- 
tain escheated Lands in the County of Kentucky, in Trustees for a Public 
School.” The passage of this bill, which was brought about chiefly by 
Colonel John Todd, led to the founding of Transylvania University, the first 
important college in the Ohio Valley. Other laws, enacted by the Ken- 
tucky Legislature in 1796, provided for the establishment of an academy in 
every county of the State, and endowed twenty-six academies, each with six 
thousand acres of land. These academies were to become feeders of the 
great central university. Those patriots who conceived the splendid project 
of a school system for Kentucky, “knew better than they builded.” 
The famous Third Article of the Ordinance of 1787 declares that 
“Schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged.” Con- 
gress granted lands for the endowment of colleges in the Northwestern 
Territory, and the Legislature of Ohio established in 1802 the Ohio Uni- 
versity, at Athens, Ohio, the oldest college north of the Ohio river; and in 
1809, the Miami University, at Oxford, Ohio. Vincennes University, In-

diana, was also endowed in a similar way, and chartered within the first 
decade of this century. Common-school education, as it is now conceived 
—that is, primary instruction for the mass of children—was not possible 
in pioneer days. Even now in States where the public-school system has 
been in operation for half a century, the rural districts are far behind the. 
cities and towns in educational advantages. Almost the only ‘efficient 
schools in the Ohio Valley, in the early period of its history, were located 
in centers of thick settlements, in enterprising villages— capitals and county 
seats. The purpose of the fathers when they chartered universities to be 
organized in the woods, before the Indians were out of sight,"seems to have 
been to afford ambitious youths an opportunity to fit themselves for. intel- 
lectual leadership; and to keep alive and spread abroad the desire for learn- 
ing until secondary and primary schools could be started in every settlement. 
They were guardians of the sacred flame. Though the whole peoplé might 
not at first reap the harvest of education, the fittest young men could go 
forth and gather the sheaves that the seed should not be lost. Therefore 
colleges were projected, and academies were founded. In fact, the colleges, 
or universities as they were ambitiously called, began as preparatory acade- 
mies, and many of the collegiate institutions of these Central States yet 
retain a preparatory department, which is a survival of the original semi- 
nary out of which the college grew. Transylvania Seminary began its 
existence in 1783, fifteen years before it was chartered as a university. 
Twenty-seven years after Congress endowed Ohio University, that institution 
first conferred college degrees. Miami University served a probation of 
nine years as a preparatory school. Cincinnati College was a development 
of the Lancastrian Seminary, the first important academy of the Queen 
City. I have spoken of the organization of academies in Kentucky. The 
commonwealth of Ohio is known to have had at least. two hundred acade- 
mies. Indiana and Illinois were dotted with similar schools. The first 
half of the century was the golden age of private academies for boys, and 
of “female seminaries.” 
Rufus Putnam wrote to Manassah Cutler, from Marietta, in 1790: “There 
are several academies in the neighboring parts of Pennsylvania, Virginia, 
and Kentucky, where the Latin and Greek are taught, and the Muskingum 
Academy at Marietta is at present, and I trust will always in the future be, 
supplied with a master capable of teaching the languages; and I think it 
cannot be long before Latin schools are established in several other places 
in the territory.” Judge James Hall records in his “ Romance of Western 
History,” that the “classical school” was among the earliest institutions of 
Virginia and Kentucky; that “in rude huts were men teaching not merely 
the primer, but expounding the Latin poets, and explaining to future law- 
yers and legislators and generals the severe truths of moral and mathemat- 
ical science. Many a student who was preparing himself for the bar or the 
pulpit, held up the lamp to younger aspirants for literary usefulness and

| 
honor in those primitive haunts, while the wolf barked in the surrounding 
thickets and the Indians were kept at bay.” 
The following advertisement, copied from the Western Spy of date Octo- 
ber 22, 1799, gives some idea of the state of education in the metropolis of 
the Ohio Valley ninety years ago: 
“Enexish Scuoon.—The subscriber informs the inhabitants of this town that his 
school is this day removed, and is now next door to Mr. Thomas Williams, skin- 
dresser, Main street. Gentlemen who have not subscribed may send their scholars 
on the same terms as the subscribers, (commencing this day.) He also intends to 
commence an evening school, in the same house, on the third day of November next, 
where writing and arithmetic, &c., will be taught four evenings in each week, from 
6 to 9 o’clock, during the term of three months. The terms for each scholar will be 
two dollars, the scholars to find firewood and candles. He also furnishes deeds and 
indentures, &c., on reasonable terms.— James WHITE.” 
The Spy for March 26, 1800, sets forth the superior advantages of a Ken- 
tucky school conducted by a Mr. Stubbs, Philomath, an Englishman, who 
said “forms” instead of grades or classes. This is his card: 
“Newport Acapemy.—The Academy at Newport will be commenced on the Ist 
of April. The Rev. Robert Stubbs is President of said Academy, in which will be 
taught reading, writing, and arithmetic, at eight pounds per annum; also, the Eng- 
lish grammar, the dead languages, the following branches of mathematics, viz.: 
Geometry, astronomy, mensuration of superfices and solids; also logic, rhetoric, 
book-keeping, &c., at four pounds per annum. Board can be had in Newport and 
its vicinity on very reasonable terms, and the greater part received in produce.” 
Had the people waited for college and academy walls to be built before 
entering upon the work of educating their youth, an ignorant generation 
would have grown up in the Valley of the Ohio. They did not wait. They 
made tentative provision for schooling youth. Not in every new settlement 
was a regular school-house built, as in Lexington, nor a John McKinney 
found in the woods ready to kill the wildcats and tame the wild children. 
The place of instruction was frequently a room within a block-house. Not 
seldom the pioneer house of worship served also as school-room, especially 
in neighborhoods settled by New England families. Cabins originally oc- 
cupied as places of residence, when abandoned by their owner for better 
homes, were often made over to the public for the accommodation of the 
school-keeper and the school he kept. Any hut or hovel was considered 
available for educational purposes. Doctor Daniel Drake, a distinguished 
pioneer, tells us that he went to school in a Kentucky still-house. Rev. 
John Mason Peck, writing of the hardships of frontier life in southern Ili- 
nois, in early days, says: “The opportunity for these Illinois pioneers to 
educate their children was extremely small. If the mother could read, 
while the father was in the corn-field, or with his rifle upon the range, she 
would barricade the door to keep off the Indians, gather her little ones 
around her, and, by the light that came in‘from the crevices in the roof and 
sides of the cabin, she would teach them the rudiments of spelling from the

fragments of some old book. Even after schools were taught, the price of 
a rough and antiquated copy of Dilworth’s Spelling Book was one dollar, 
and the dollar equal to five now.” 
Timothy Flint, describing the North Carolina school-house in which Daniel 
Boone learned his letters, says it “stood as a fair sample of thousands of 
west-country school-houses of the year 1834. It was of logs, after the usual 
fashion of the time and place. In dimensions, it was spacious and conveni- 
ent. The chimney was peculiarly ample, occupying one entire side of the 
building, which was an exact square. Of course, a log as long as the build- 
ing could be ‘snaked’ to the fire-place, and a file of boys thirty feet long 
could stand in front of the fire on a footing of the most democratic equality. 
Sections of logs, cut out here and there, admitted light and air, instead of 
windows. The surrounding forest furnished ample supplies of fuel. A 
spring at hand, furnished with various gourds, quenched the frequent thirst 
of the pupils. A ponderous puncheon door, swinging on substantial wooden 
hinges, and shutting with a wooden latch, completed the appendages of this 
primeval seminary.” 
It appears that the “frequent thirst” of the Irish master of this school 
was not quenched from a gourd dipped into the spring, but from a bottle of 
whisky which the bibulous Hibernian kept hidden under a mat of vines in 
the greenwood. x 
The picture of the Boone school house is matched by that of the log 
cabin on the Virginia “slashes,” in which Henry Clay was taught the rudi- 
ments by an English schoolmaster, who, says Carl Schurz, “passed under 
the name of Peter Deacon—a man of uncertain past, and somewhat given 
to hard drinking.” 
Lincoln, writing his experience as a boy, said of Perry county, Indiana: 
“Tt was a wild region, with many bears and other wild animals still in the 
woods. There were some schools, so called, but no qualification was ever 
required of a teacher beyond ‘readin’, writin’, and cipherin’ to the rule of 
three.’ Ifa straggler, supposed to understand Latin, happened to sojourn 
in the neighborhood, he was looked upon as a wizard. There was absolutely 
nothing to excite ambition for education.” 
Those familiar with the history of education in Ohio will recall Jeremiah 
N. Reynolds’s description of the school-house in which his preceptor, the 
celebrated Francis Glass, author of the Life of Washington; in Latin, ex- 
pended enthusiasm and erudition upon a mob of Buckeye urchins. ‘The 
school-house now rises fresh on my memory,” wrote Mr. Reynolds. “The 
building was a low log cabin, with a clapboard roof, but indifferently 
lighted —all the light of heaven found in this cabin came in through aper- 
tures made on each side of the logs, and these were covered with oiled paper 
to keep out the cold air, while they admitted the dim rays. The seats or 
benches were of hewn timber, resting on upright posts placed in the ground 
to keep them from being overturned by mischievous lads who sat on them.
-P-A-G-E-237

In the center was a large stove, between which and the back part of the 
building stood a small desk, without lock or key, made of rough plank over 
which a plane had never passed, and behind this desk sat Professor Glass 
when I entered his school. There might have been forty scholars present: 
twenty-five of these were engaged in spelling, reading and writing, a few in 
arithmetic, a small class in English grammar, and a half-dozen like myself 
had joined the school for instruction in Greek and Latin.” 
The evolution of the modern highly “differentiated” and often palatial 
school edifice from its humble prototype of pioneer days, is wonderful to 
contemplate. The low-eaved, “chinked,”’ and “mud-daubed” hut, with 
clapboard roof, stick chimney, greased-paper window, latch-stringed door, 
with no floor but the natural clay of the earth, was certainly as primitive 
as can be conceived. Such aschool-house stood in Zanesville, Ohio, in 1805, 
containing within it a large stump which served admirably for a “dunce- 
block.’”’ On one occasion Mr. Samuel Herrick, a teacher in this educational 
institution and Great Western University, was foiled in his attempt to flog 
an incorrigible boy, who, weasel-like, resorted to the expedient of crawling 
under the lower log in the cabin and escaping into the free forest. The 
first developed form, or “primordial cell” of school architecture, gave place 
to an improved structure of hewn logs, with puncheon floor, stone chimney, 
and some attempt at clumsy furniture. This type of school-house is not yet 
extinct in Ohio. A few specimens of the pioneer fold for pupils may still 
be seen, though I am not aware that any log cabin is now used in the State 
for school purposes. As one views the tumbled ruins of such a relic of the 
past, he is reminded of the Anglo-Saxon word for schoolmaster, namely, 
“child-herd.” Our fathers and mothers were herded and sheltered in 
wooden pens; but they were often fed on the bread of life. Garfield’s im- 
mortal saying, that a bench with Mark Hopkins seated as teacher on one 
end of it is a university —how true it is! Socrates walking in the groves 
of Academe, was better than any pile of college buildings. 
James K. Parker, an honored educator, now past threescore and ten, but 
still teaching in Clermont county, Ohio, graphically described in a private 
letter the log school-houses in which he began his studies: “The first two 
were built of round logs, chinked with blocks of wood, and daubed with 
clay mortar. The roofs were of split clapboards, weighted down with small 
logs. The third I helped to build. It was of hewn logs chinked with stone, 
and more neatly daubed with clay. The chimney was built of stone laid in 
lime and sand mortar. The others were what was known as ‘cat-and-clay 
chimneys.’ The floor was of boards—many were of puncheon —i. e., split 
and hewn. Our seats were long benches made of slabs with long pegs for 
legs. Our writing-desks were long, broad boards resting on long pegs in- 
serted in the log walls. The next log above this shelf was either left out in 
the building, or sawed out afterwards. In this long space was inserted 
sash, one light wide, filled either with glass or oiled paper. The writing-

seats were usually so high that our feet did not touch the floor. There were 
no such things as supports for the back. Our ink was mostly home-made— 
from oak-bark ooze and copperas. Our pens were all made from goose- 
quills, and our paper unruled—each pupil ruled for himself, with a plum- 
met made of common metallic lead. Copies were all set by hand. I never 
saw ruled paper until I had been a teacher several years, nor a letter en- 
velope until this academy was eight years old. My first steel pen cost me 
25 cents. My first box of lucifer matches (100), while I was at South 
Hanover College, cost 18} cents— postage on a letter from home the same 
price.” 
Many of the backwoods teachers were Irish, others Scotch, others English. 
Often they were adventurers, adrift upon the world —fair scholars it might 
be, but worthless men —impecunious and addicted to the pipe and the bottle, 
like Boone’s preceptor, and Henry Clay’s. The drinking habit appears to 
have been a pedagogical qualification exceedingly prevalent. An old gentle- 
man in Vevay, Indiana, told me last winter that it was not uncommon, in 
the days of his boyhood, for a school-teacher to manifest his good-will 
towards the big boys by freely offering them the use of pipes and tobacco, 
and also the refreshment of occasional drafts from his whisky-jug. So, you 
see, time has changed public sentiment on the question of narcotics and 
alcohol. I imagine that such jolly pedagogues as Master Halfpenny and 
Peter Deacon thought little on the subject of “temperance physiology.” 
In the course of time, foreign teachers lost popularity, or rather they were 
ousted by the pervasive Yankee schoolmaster, who asserted himself in the 
Western wilderness, claiming almost a monopoly of the business, and giving 
to the “people’s colleges” a decidedly New England character. 
The method of “getting up” a school in the period preceding the mode 
by taxation and the appropriation of public funds, was this: The applicant 
for a school would draw up an article of agreement, stating what branches 
he would teach, and for what rate of compensation. This paper was passed 
around from house to house for signatures, and for subscriptions payable partly 
in money and partly in “produce.” The tuition of the children of the poor 
was customarily paid by public-spirited individuals of comfortable fortune. 
The school terms were usually short, from ten to fifteen weeks of six days 
each; but the daily sessions were very long, extending over eight and even 
ten hours. 
I scarcely need allude to the custom of “boarding round,” which prevailed 
long before and long after the memorable days of Ichabod Crane. It was 
a custom that came from the East. It had this advantage, that it enabled 
the teacher to become well acquainted with his patrons, and they with him. 
In the work of the school-room not much system was used in management, 
or method in instruction. The pupils brought to the school such books as . 
they could obtain, or no books at all. A county judge in Warsaw, Kentucky, 
told me that his father learned the alphabet from a shingle upon which the

letters were scrawled with charcoal. Classification and grading were next 
to impossible; the scholars studied in their own way, with irregular and 
incidental help from the teacher. ‘There were as many classes in a subject 
as there were pupils studying it. Ambitious farmer boys, “ciphering 
arithmetic,” ran races to see who should first get through old “Pike.” An 
odd miscellany of dog’s-eared volumes came from cabin closets to furnish 
reading-text. Happy he who possessed a copy of the English Reader, or 
the Columbian Orator. Wanting these, he must put up with Asop’s Fables, 
or Gulliver’s Travels, or a dream book, or even a tornalmanac. ‘The Bible 
was in general use as a reading-book, and numerous are the stories told of 
ludicrous blunders made by blockheads in pronouncing hard scripture words. 
At an uncertain hour, all hands engaged in scribbling copies, which the 
master had “set” in advance, beginning with “pot-hooks” and ending with 
moral sentences in “round hand.” With penknife sharpened to the keenest 
edge, the master skillfully fashioned into pens the goose-quills brought to 
his desk. But the culminating exereise was the spelling-match, which usually 
closed the duties of the day. The scholars, ranged in order along the walls: 
spelled or “missed” the words pronounced with syllabic precision by the 
master, who stood with ferule in one hand and Dilworth’s Spelling Book in 
the other, like the genius of education holding up the emblems of power and 
knowledge. The spelling-school at early candle-lighting, that nocturnal 
annex to the social and scholastic day, is embalmed in Eggleston’s story of 
the “ Hoosier Schoolmaster.” 
The three R’s, the trivium of a log-cabin course of study, are rudimental 
—basilar—essential. Where demand existed or was created for other 
branches, they were added, and manuals of information were forthcoming. 
In 1784, Jerediah Morse prepared a text-book on geography, for the schools 
of New Haven. This was issued from a Boston press in 1789, and by the 
year 1811 it had passed through sixteen editions, and was in use in all the 
States. Lindlay Murray’s English Grammar held the field as a popular 
text-book until about 1830. Supply is ever swift to form the acquaintance 
of Demand, and competition is never long idle. Dilworth’s field was soon 
invaded by Webster and Walker. Authors and compilers in Boston, Phil- 
adelphia and New York put themselves to the task of supplying a “long- 
felt want,” by preparing series upon series for the use of schools, and soon 
rival authors and publishers appeared in the West —in Lexington, Cincin- 
nati, and elsewhere. In 1795, John Wood, of New York, published the 
“Mentor, or American Teacher’s Assistant.” Dilworth’s ‘‘Schoolmaster’s 
Assistant” was of earlier origin. In 1811 was issued, in Philadelphia, 
William Daune’s “Epitome of the Arts and Sciences, being a Comprehen- 
sive System of the Elementary Parts of a Useful and Polite Education ;” 
Albert Picket’s series of “American School Class-Books,” including works 
on spelling, reading, grammar, geography, and writing, came out early in 
the century, published by D. D. Smith, New York. “Gummere’s Survey-

ing,” and James Ross’s Latin Grammar, popular guides in their day, were 
not published until the year 1814. ‘ 
The school-books which I have just named or alluded to, and others from 
the Atlantic States, were used in the schools of the Ohio Valley, and stray 
copies of them may be found in old libraries and second-hand bookstores. 
They are now dead leaves, fallen from the deciduous tree of educational 
literature. 
The pioneer schools were the best that pioneer circumstances would allow. 
They gave boys and girls a start in life. The children learned in order to 
read, write and cipher in practical ways. Harsh, crude, direct, were the 
instruction and the discipline. Among the branches not neglected by teacher 
nor forgotten by the pupil were birch and hickory. Flogging was a specific 
in well-nigh universal use, both as cure and preventive. Our good fathers 
had to “toe the mark;” but sometimes they got even with a despotic master 
by “barring him out” on Christmas, or smoking him in with burning sul- 
phur, if he would not come out, or even by ducking him in a pond, or such- 
like playful familiarity. 
But a hundred years ago, as now, and as it will be a hundred years hence, 
the good teacher made a good school. There are always difficulties to over- 
come. Relatively, our ancestors did as well as we are doing now. Cadmus 
finds a dragon in his way, but Cadmus conquers, and founds his city, and 
dispenses arts and letters and laws. 
THE RECITATION. 
  GEORGE HOWLAND, CHICAGO, ILLINOIS. 
Whether we regard the prime purpose of the school as mental or moral 
instruction and discipline, the formation of character, or the manual skill 
that shall aid in securing a comfortable livelihood, the recitation is that 
about which center all the activities of school-life, giving it success or 
stamping it with failure. 
The personal influence of the teacher is of the first importance; the 
power to control and direct, invaluable; the magnetism which shall inspire 
and incite to earnest, loving effort, a necessity to the accomplished, success- 
ful teacher; but all of these qualifications find full scope in the recitation, 
and without this end they have little cause or reason to be. 
The recitation is the controlling influence, determining the length and 
character of the lessons, the manner of their preparation, the conduct of 
the pupil, his hours of study, his interest in school, and his regard for his
-P-A-G-E-241

teacher, and gives the color, the value to all his school-days—his waking 
and his sleeping hours. 
Tt is the recitation, with its direct or indirect influences, which makes him 
a trusty friend or a hopeless truant, a student or a scamp, and which will 
guide him along the paths of honest and successful industry or into the by- 
ways of indolence and worthlessness. 
Here he finds the rewards of well-doing, or the condemnation of his neg- 
ligence; an incitement to renewed effort, or an excuse for feeble exertion 
and lax endeavor. 
In the recitation, too, the teacher gives proof of her calling or shows her 
unfitness for her position. In the recitation is concentrated the devotion, 
the thought, the life of the teacher, and the work, the purpose, the zeal, and 
the performance of the pupil. Here is displayed the life of the school, and 
here is decided whether the school shall be a means of growth and develop- 
ment, or a source of unworthy motive, of false aims, and ignoble character. 
There is a common and flippant charge made against the public graded 
school, that the individual is neglected; that all are recklessly run through 
the samé mill, without regard to the personal peculiarities of the pupil, or 
to the purpose of his life; that the alert and the sluggish mind receive the 
same stupefying potions; that to the future senator and the incipient slugger 
are administered the same dull and dismal doses of dreary didactics and 
deadening discourses. 
But the intelligent teacher soon discerns the differences of character and 
disposition, and distinguishes the slow and logical thinker from the ready, 
but unreasoning, reciter; the cultured heir to wealth and winning ways from 
the child of sturdy toil and untrained manners; and adjusts herself and her 
instructions to the equally imperative, but differing needs of each. 
And in the varying characters and contrasted thought of each. may the 
other derive a knowledge of society and real life which shall fit him for the 
duties and responsibilities of his after calling, that no exclusive training 
could impart. Not because they are in the same class, or grade, do they 
receive the same impressions or benefits, or learn the same lessons of science, 
of truthfulness, or right. 
One acquires the love of learning and the principles which shall urge him 
onward to assured success, while the other simply tastes of the cup that shall 
cheer his ifle hours and give him higher thoughts of humanity and life. 
One is awakened to the full use of his powers in the grand struggle of ex- 
istence, which shall bring him a glad fruition; the other merely finds an 
adornment of his leisure hours—a pleasing resource from the weary de- 
mands upon his time and attention. 
To the one, his study becomes an important part of his life-work, while 
to the other, his acquisitions are but a grateful relief from perplexing and 
troublous cares. To one, the recitation is an inspiring duty; to another, a 
wearisome task, or, perchance, a diversion.

Notwithstanding the pleasing picture so often drawn of Garfield and Dr. 
Hopkins upon their log, it somehow happens that our pupils are not all 
Garfields, and it may perhaps with equal safety be admitted that we are not 
all Hopkinses. And however useful a proper amount of such familiar in- 
tercourse might prove, (and the relation of teacher and pupil should, I 
think, contain the possibility of this intimate converse,) yet, for the common 
instruction of the school, I confess for myself a firm and abiding faith in 
the power of class-teaching. 
We do not all grow into the same likeness of form or feature by sitting at 
the same table, and supplying our daily wants from the same bill of fare. 
In the college and university, with more mature minds and more definite 
purposes of life, with habits of thought and investigation already formed; 
the literary or philosophic lecture or the scientific dissertation may fulfill 
their purpose; but in the public school, including the high school, the skill 
and power of the teacher find their best expression in the well-conducted 
recitation. 
In the right recitation should be sought, and by some means secured, the 
close and fixed attention of each and every pupil. To it he should come as 
a seeker, a discoverer of hidden treasure. Every power should be awake, 
the interest aroused, to get some clue to assist him in his future search, some 
data to verify the conclusions of his own efforts. He should be on the alert 
to perceive any wrong statement, to note any undue coloring, and be ready 
to correct the false deductions and refute the empty argument by a clear 
presentation of real or supposed truth. The recitation of one should be 
the recitation of all, and thus class instruction become truly individual in- 
struction, with the added interest and power that can come only from con- 
tact of mind with mind. : 
The pupil who merely rises and repeats with close fidelity the words of 
the book, has done nothing but exhibit an exercise of the memory—a 
power not to be despised, but lamented here as so far short of the aim of 
the recitation. : 
This power of memory is one of inestimable value—this power to repeat 
with strict accuracy the words of an author; a power fitted to hold in its 
fast and fond embrace the immortal words and sentences which spring only 
from inspired hearts and minds—and should not be wasted upon the frivo- 
lous and belittling lines so often found upon the pages of our*educational 
papers; too grand a power for a trifling triplet of words, or for the paltry 
passages of unimportant history. 
The teacher greatly underrates his opportunities and mistakes his calling, 
who simply puts forth his questions, and signifies his assent or dissent to the 
correctness of the recital with an accompanying mark of merit or demerit. 
A very ordinary text-book can do all that for the boys and girls, and much 
more. They are there to be taught, to be directed, to be encouraged, in- 
spired to the prosecution of their purpose, and the dull, dead “ Not correct,”
-P-A-G-E-243
  THE RECITATION. 248   
with no indication of the nature of the error, no suggestion, falls like a blow 
upon the defenseless head-of a young ambition that might have been guided 
to a worthy, useful life. 
This recitation is much more than a test of the pupil’s memory: he is to 
be taught to think, to consider the reasons for or against the statements of 
the book or the teacher, and clearly and thoughtfully express his views. 
He may be all wrong in his conclusions, and yet show a strength, a power 
of reasoning and statement, fairly entitling him to a high rank as a student. 
His knowledge may be insufficient, his data incorrect, but his deductions, 
from his premises, conclusive. 
The clear and correct expression of his opinions and judgments is to be 
encouraged, as an important part of the recitation. I recollect how, in the 
old days—and some of the old fellows, I fear, still live——when we ventured 
to essay our unfledged wings in feeble flight, we were brought up all stand- 
ing with the supposed unanswerable remark that “it was written by Dr. 
So-and-so, and it was hardly worth while to try to improve upon his lan- 
guage.” And perhaps the eminent Doctor, too, was but repeating the words 
of some preceding eminent dullard. 
True thought is more than compiling facts, and the correct expression of 
that thought in well-chosen words, and moulded phrase and sentence, better 
than glib recital; and whether the pupil agrees with the author should cut 
a small figure in determining the worth of his recitation. 
The worth of the recitation, who shall tell? What does it show of the 
power of application acquired, of the careful analysis, the thoughtful in- 
vestigation? Has he a firm grasp of the subject, any correct principles to 
aid him hereafter, any living idea that is to germinate and develop into 
anything of worth in forming his mind or heart? And the mark which he 
shall secure—the penciled record of his worth! Oh, the blight of this 
marking upon all true scholarship and healthful growth !—blighting alike to 
teacher and pupil—presenting to the pupil unworthy and dwarfing motives, 
and barring the teacher from his proud privilege of instructing and mould- 
ing the character and life, and reducing him to the low level of the billiard- 
marker. 
Not for a mark is the recitation held, but to give a new impulse—to 
point the way to more assured success. ‘ 
But this fixed attention, this keen thought and close reasoning, however 
secured, and however pleasing and inspiring it may be, is work, and the 
stronger the magnetic force the more exhaustive the effort. Mental exer- 
tion, too, like physical, has its limits. 
An hour of true recitation, discussing topics of interest, giving the argu- 
ments pro and con, enlivening the dry statement with lively illustration, 
should have had quite as much time for preparation. No student should 
come to the recitation —to the elaboration of a subject in history, literature,
-P-A-G-E-244
  244 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  
mathematics, or science —who has not had the time to examine the matter 
thoroughly, and, to his ability, exhaustively. 
A limit, then, is set to the work of the school. I recently looked over the 
course of study of a large city, in which 21 hours of ‘the 25 was prescribed 
as the minimum amount of time for recitation for the week. 
Why do our pupils spend so many years over their arithmetics and geog- 
raphies without getting into them? Isn’t it a greater wonder that so many 
of them stay with us all these years? 
My fellow-teachers, let us not willingly blind ourselves to the truth! Our 
pupils in the cities have too much school. From six years of age to ten, 
twelve, or eighteen, according to their endurance, they go to school, till 
they weary of the very name of school, generally by the time they reach 
the age of ten or twelve, and entreat their parents to let them do something. 
Three hours a day of recitation should surely be enough for any pupil in 
the grammar grades. It is all the colleges demand. Nor need the high 
schools require more: We stultify our pupils by asking of them more than 
a bright, earnest boy or girl can safely perform, and stand amazed at-the 
result. We absorb all the time in recitation, and devote it largely to dawd- 
ling listlessness, leaving little time for good, close, personal effort in fruitful 
study. Is this overdrawn? 
And what of the teacher who is to secure this attention? Ever alert, 
watchful, patient, courteous, alike to pupil and parent, even the post of 
teacher in the common school, though of sound lungs, of digestion unim- 
paired, with the ruddy glow of youth still undimmed, is no sinecure. 
In the early grades, before the little ones can study by themselves, save in 
some little diversion, some busy work with objects, the recitation is not, in 
any true sense, a recitation, but an exercise, which should be brief, bright 
and interesting. Five or ten minutes will be enough for the little work, 
speedily to be repeated. 
And in the higher primary grades, no lessons should be assigned, I think, 
for home study. The confinement of the school hours is enough, and the 
leisure time out of school should be employed in developing their physical 
nature, in becoming familiar with their surroundings, in learning something 
of life, of nature, and in searching out the hidden, the mysterious meaning 
of the thousand things around them. 
In the grammar grades, too, at least one-half, or in the higher classes one- 
third, of the school hours should be left for study. No lessons for home 
study in the primary grades should be possible, and in the grammar and 
high-school grades, very little should be assigned for preparation out of 
school. : 
Give the little fourth-grader a book to read, if you will, a book that he 
cannot help reading; that he will want to read aloud to his parents; but 
not a spelling-lesson to be learned, to be written ten times; a page of his- 
 
-P-A-G-E-245
  THE RECITATION. 245 
tory to memorize, some puzzling problems to solve, some composition to be 
written by his parents or older sisters. 
The lessons should, for the most part, be prepared in school. The hours 
before and after school are little enough for healthful growth, for becoming 
acquainted with the inner and the outer duties of home and real life, and 
for that knowledge above and beyond all school instruction, which every 
boy, who is a boy, must have, and for which many a girl might barter much 
of her acquirements in music and drawing. 
The teacher, who allows the pupil after answering a question or two, to 
turn to some other pursuit, may not be wholly wrong; she leaves some time 
for study; but she greatly discounts her own power and influence, and sinks 
herself into a very insignificant factor of the real school-life. 
The pupil should have his close, strict and accurate recitation, but should 
also haye, in school hours, the time and the opportunity for preparing him- 
self for the proper presentation of the assigned subject, for the day and 
the hour of recitation. There can be no true performance without due 
preparation. 
Closely connected with this home study, is associated in my mind, another 
practice once so common, and which can hardly be too strongly condemned. 
I mean the practice of keeping after school, formerly the reserve force of so 
many a teacher, and one of the greatest wrongs in the schools of to-day; 
doing more to hinder progress, to deaden interest, to dwarf ambition, and 
cause a distaste, a hatred of school, school duties, and school privileges, than 
all other influences combined. fi 
Keeping after school fails, and must fail, to promote good conduct, to 
secure well-prepared lessons, to incite ambition, to awaken exertion, or en- 
courage good attendance. The results are, in my judgment, like the early 
thoughts of the sons of men, evil and only evil continually. I sometimes 
wish I had the gift to express, in a way to be fully understood, my utter 
abhorrence of this practice of keeping after school. Never have I known 
of a pupil renewed, reformed, reclaimed or reconciled to his surroundings 
by being kept after school—by making education a punishment, that first 
resource of the incompetent teacher. 
By some chance or mischance he comes in five minutes late: “Fifteen 
minutes after school.” He stumbles in hurrying to his seat: “Remain after 
school.” He makes a mistake in recitation: “Make it up after school.” 
He whispers, winks with one eye: “Stay after school.” He asks to leave the 
room: “Twenty minutes after school.” He fails to respond to a querulous 
or sarcastic question: “TI will see you after school.” And if he ever succeeds 
in any business or calling or has any interest or happiness in life, it will 
assuredly be after school, school methods and schoolma’ams have gone by. 
If the room cannot be controlled, why prolong the agony after teacher and 
pupil should have been relieved of the unwholesome air and vicious influ- 
ences of weary hours and unrestrained disorder? If the lessons are unpre-

pared, quicken the ambition and revive the spirit of improvement and useful 
acquisition by some curious inquiry, some ingenious device, and by prompt 
and pleasant dismissal, with an inspiring “Good-night;” but do not look 
for a renewed love of learning and a higher respect for authority from this 
ruinous resort of the incompetent— keeping after school. 
To secure this close, untiring attention—the first essential of a successful 
recitation — there must be in the mind of the teacher a clear and well-defined 
conception of what is to be done, the points to be gained, and the conclu- 
sions to be reached, so that ambition may not be dulled and curiosity ex- 
tinguished by misdirected effort and fruitless endeavor. The truth, as yet 
ungrasped, should be placed so temptingly near that indifference to its pos- 
session shall become an impossibility, and earnest exertion a delight. 
We do not expect the blindfolded child to develop useful strength or 
secure available wisdom by groping with outstretched hands and tripping 
feet among misplaced chairs and tables, however he may while away a few 
idle minutes for the amusement of his elusive playmates. Nor is he the 
wise tourist who, for the larger experience, dismisses his Alpine guides, ex- 
pecting himself to find the safer paths and the wider outlooks, the better 
resting-places, and to gain the loftier peaks; he is likely to return, however, 
if he return at all, a sadder if not a wiser man. 
A thorough knowledge of the subject to be considered, much beyond the 
limits of the lesson; a knowledge of what will be important in the future, 
and what forms a mere stepping-stone to what lies farther on; its relations 
to other topics, will greatly aid the teacher in guiding the eager pupil to 
the speediest and best results; will save from many a fruitless digression, 
wearisome repetition, and empty recital. 
For the older as well as the younger pupils, the proper method of ap- 
proaching a subject, the logic of the exercise, is often quite as important as 
the facts to be learned. In many cases the recitation may well be little 
more than a reading of the unstudied lesson, with a running commentary 
by the teacher, briefly showing the bearing of this or that fact, the reason 
of one statement and the meaning of another, suggesting certain lines of 
thought, and ready references for their better comprehension. Here and 
there a question may be started, perhaps some incident related, to quicken 
and arouse the interest and thought. For this work the teacher needs, like 
the commander of an army, to have her well-trained powers and her mental 
resources well in hand, with perhaps a skirmish-line of fine instincts and 
keen perceptions, protected on either wing by a well-assured confidence and 
a wise discretion, secured against unforeseen emergencies by a large reserve 
force of general information, ready wit, and close logic. 
Of quite as much importance, too, she should have learned, or discerned, 
the character of those with whom she has to do—their mental powers, their 
dispositions, their habits and modes of thought, their likes and dislikes; a 
knowledge of their associates, their employment out of school, their home- 
   
-P-A-G-E-247
  THE RECITATION. 247 
life: all this should be as open and plain t6 her as the book from which she 
prepared for her work. She must adapt herself to the bright, easy learner, 
and to the duller, but, it may be, the deeper student; to the flippant reciter 
and the slower stammerer; to the pliant fawner and the sturdy independ- 
ent; and devise means to encourage, chasten and direct, with an ever-hopeful 
trust and kindly charity; an unsuspecting watchfulness, and an unfailing 
personal interest. 
Sometimes, too, the firm authority and timely severity find their true 
place. The mere hearing of lessons, the asking of questions, however 
scholarly, and couched in choicest language, with no apparent personal in- 
terest in the success, the individual welfare of the pupil, will not win in 
this mental conflict. How many a young, earnest heart has lost its fond 
ardor, wearied of its high and honest purpose, and fallen back into the 
ranks of the careless and undeserving, from the real or supposed lack of the 
teacher’s interest in his progress. The sharp censure, so that it come from 
the indignant heart of a friend at some delinquency, will awaken and ex- 
pand the young spirit, and fill it with stronger purposes and better hopes, 
than the cold indifference of the calm, uncaring critic. 
A great barrier to success, too, cutting her off from any sympathetic rela- 
tions with her class, does she raise who calls upon her pupils by the card — 
one of those self-imposed restraints that hold the hands, the heart, the 
thoughts of the teacher, depriving her of much of her power for good. 
No teacher, I think, can well command the attention of her class who is 
shut in to this practice; and no pupil, unless urged on by some superhuman 
impulse, can fix his thought upon the recitation, whose fate is fixed by the 
run of a handful of cards. 
To be interested, he must feel responsible for every topic presented, for 
every question asked. But when his name has once been drawn, what 
further personal interest can he have? And if, by some chance—as I have 
sometimes seen —he is called upon a second time, he has a ready and safe 
refuge in the reply, “I have recited once.” And why may he not be ques- 
tioned a second, a third time, or any number of times, when needful ? 
Two or three years since, after I had discouraged this use of the cards, 
one of our active, working teachers came to me with the inquiry, what she 
should do with them? I told her that the best use of them that occurred 
to me was, to open the drawer of her desk, quietly drop them in, and close 
the desk. A few weeks later she told me that she had adopted my plan, 
and for the first time felt herself freed to conduct a recitation. 
If the pupil’s attention is to be held, he must feel that he is at any time 
to be called upon for an explanation, a correction, an illustration; and 
every day, as a rule, should he have the opportunity to recite. Sitting 
silent and unnoticed day after day, he soon loses all interest, becomes list- 
less or restless, and ere long ceases to prepare the lesson for which he has 
no use.
-P-A-G-E-248

Though it be nothing more than a simple yes or no, he has had his say, 
has shown himself a living entity, and goes home at night with a higher 
satisfaction with himself and the school for just that one small word. 
What an opportunity, too, does the recitation furnish for imparting infor- 
mation —for giving the pupil an insight into the rich fields of literature, 
science, history, and real life. 
The recitation, as we have said, is more than a rehearsal of memorized 
pages—it is a discussion of subjects that have been already carefully stud- 
ied. It may be that very little attention need be given to the reading of 
the text, which will be already clearly understood, but may suggest rela- 
tions and conditions well worthy the consideration of teacher and pupil. 
The mere fact may be nothing to the student, but indirectly bring about 
results of surpassing interest. An exercise in reading may suggest subjects 
in history, in biography, in botany, and astronomy. As an extreme exam- 
ple, take Macaulay’s essay on Warren Hastings, found in so many of our 
readers : 
“The place was worthy of such a trial. It was the great hall of William Rufus — 
the hall which had witnessed the just sentence of Bacon, and the just absolution 
of Somers; the hall where the eloquence of Strafford had for a moment awed and 
melted a victorious party inflamed with just resentment; the hall where Charles 
had confronted the High Court of Justice with the placid courage which has half 
redeemed his fame. There were seated the fair-haired daughters of the house of 
Brunswick; there the historian of the Roman Empire thought of the days when 
Cicero pleaded the cause of Sicily against Verres, and where, before a senate that 
still preserved some show of freedom, Tacitus thundered against the oppressors of 
Africa.” 
As mere words, one might as well recite the alphabet, or the multiplication 
table. Who and what were Macaulay, Hastings, William Rufus, Bacon, 
Strafford, the Historian of the Roman Empire, Brunswick, Cicero, Verres 
and Tacitus? What did they do, and why are their names introduced here? 
What has Cicero, or William Rufus, to do with Hastings’ doings with the 
Begum? 
All this is beyond the grammar grades, and yet without some definite 
knowledge, some fair idea of these characters, wherein is it more valuable 
reading than the prognostics of last year’s almanacs? The recitation is a 
reading-lesson, in which the pupils should give expression to intelligent 
thought and true sentiment. But the investigation of all this history and 
biography is beyond them. The teacher must intervene, and by a few 
graphic touches place before them these pictures so vividly that they shall 
remain as a part of their mental constitution. Nor is it so difficult a task 
for him who is fitted for his place. With an almost inappreciable inroad 
upon the reading-exercise, these illustrations can be placed within the pupil’s 
grasp, as no stolid study of cyclopedia can do, and enliven the work with an 
interest which no professional technics can impart. 
In the reading of a class are the possibilities of a liberal education, of an
-P-A-G-E-249

art and a culture beyond what the graduates of high school and college 
often so carefully enfold in their diplomas. 
If we but knew our opportunities, the professor of elocution and the 
countless exemplars of what Delsarte never dreamed of would soon find 
their occupation gone, and our boys and girls, instead of thoughtless mouth- 
ers, would sometimes become intelligent learners and thinkers. 
The reading-lesson is not to be turned into a study of biography or his- 
tory, nor are all these allusions to be learned at once. Enough can be done 
to give the character of the essay, and inspire the class with the spirit of 
the matchless essayist —one suggestion here, and another there, without 
serious hindrance or interruption. Some of the characters can be more 
fully studied at home, or in the school library; not, indeed, in any exhaust- 
ive way, but surely enough for an intelligent reading; enough to awaken 
the desire to delve deeper into the exhaustless mines of literature, and to 
enlarge the pupil’s mental horizon, and prepare him for the more thorough 
work of his school-life, and furnish some food for thought during the leisure 
hours of an active or laborious life. 
One of the most accurate and scholarly of my college friends told me 
that he never sought thoroughly to prepare the whole of a lesson—in Latin, 
for instance—but having done enough for the purpose of a fair recitation, 
he then studied one or two lines exhaustively. This habit, long before his 
college course was completed, had made him a model for nice, discriminat- 
ing scholarship. 
It is not often in lumps, in masses, that wisdom or learning is to be ac- 
quired. The nuggets of knowledge in the school-room are as rare as those 
of gold in the hearts of the hills. The love of learning, of knowing, for- 
tunately, is a common inheritance, from which few are shut out. To keep 
alive this love—to turn this curious, inquiring nature into the right paths, 
where the search shall be more sure of the reward in the speedy gratifica- 
tion of desire, and show something of the relative worth of the different 
objects of desire, and how to distinguish these—is the teacher’s work; and 
to lead the pupil to see that small, but continuous accretions, from worthy 
effort, hour by hour and day by day, make up the sum total of our work. 
And before those little limbs are strong enough to mount the rugged roads, 
or those laughing eyes have sadly learned to discern the miry ways, shall 
we never reach out a friendly hand, or sometimes even lift them up the 
steep, lest they dash their feet against the stones? 
But are not the lessons assigned to be learned? and how can it be known 
that they are learned unless they are recited? If we only could know that 
they are learned after the recitation! The subject is indeed to be under- 
stood, comprehended, made a part of the pupil’s self—to be converted into 
something that shall avail him in his future work. But whether it is to be 
learned in the style of this or that author, is of little importance. Our 
school histories and geographies are generally but enumerations of a few 
 
-P-A-G-E-250
250 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
    
bare facts, some important events, but even in these rately show by the re- 
lations of facts and events why those mentioned are of more importance 
than a thousand others, of which no mention is made. Other authors have 
expressed their views in different verbal signs; and the pupil, if indeed a 
student, should give his views in a still different form of words, more con- 
sonant with his own mental condition, and delicate shading of thoughts, 
opinions and judgments. 
A lesson is learned when the student has a clear, well-founded opinion of 
the subject-matter, but not necessarily when the page can be declaimed. 
The restriction of a pupil to a single book, after he is old and strong enough 
to think, to study, is a misfortune, if the teacher is equal to the place. From 
the reading of one text-book the pupil is liable to receive a very limited, a 
narrow idea of the subject; and when, after school days are over, he falls 
upon a different version of some event, he begins to doubt of the wisdom of 
the schools, and of authors, and perchance to question whether there be any 
truth in the world. 
He should be taught in school, in the recitation, to compare different au- 
thorities, different mathematical definitions, to weigh carefully the evidences, 
and to form his own judgments as to their worth and correctness. 
But can he, will he do this, with the cold, unimpassioned teacher before 
him at the desk, with the well-pointed pencil in hand to enact the part of 
the recording angel upon his effort, with never a sympathetic tear to blot 
the unhappy entry? 
The arithmetic lays down certain principles, with examples enough for the 
pupil to ascertain whether he comprehends them. It is for the teacher to 
see, by the use of the same examples, or by others involving the same prin- 
ciples, if he truly understands them aright. We adopt the topical method, 
and place upon the blackboard a column of a dozen or fifteen topics for each 
State or country —a very paltry and belittling device, as it seems to me, if 
carried too far. The pupil should learn, should have a method, it is true; 
but let him determine what are the important points to be presented. These 
points do not always come up before the mind in the same order, or in the 
same numbers. Sometimes the water-ways, sometimes the railroads, now the 
productions, and again the scenery, stand out in distinctness, and should en- 
list the interest and control the thought of the pupil. To one, the civil de- 
velopment of the people, to another the social, presents itself; while again 
the industrial, the commercial, the artistic development, claims attention. 
The dictionary, the cyclopedia, the map, all find a useful place, and even 
the novel, the romance, present valued pictures of life and manners, and 
sometimes aid in the solution of social and political problems, beyond the 
scope, the possibility of the text-book. 
The lesson, as I have indicated, is not something to be merely recited, 
but a subject, or subjects, to be studied and investigated, to which the pupil 
is to give his best thought and best powers, that when the hour of recitation 
comes, he may be prepared to take an intelligent part in the discussion.

  THE RECITATION. 251 
  
First of all, he must learn to think, and to express himself in a clear, 
systematic and logical way; to adduce facts to sustain his opinions; to be 
ready with crayon, metaphor or incident to illustrate his argument. His 
mental powers must be aroused, quickened, disciplined, and strengthened 
for future use; and for those ends, the oral recitation presents the best, if 
not the only efficient means. 
The written recitation, in such favor with many teachers, is in no true 
sense a recitation. It is simply an examination, useful, nay, in a limited 
way, indispensable, but not a recitation. The real uses of a recitation have 
no play in the written exercise. The power, the personal magnetism of the 
teacher, and the fruitful suggestion, find no place here. She sits idle and 
useless. The pupil might familiarize himself with the mechanical parts of 
a written performance, might improve his penmanship, his spelling and ac- 
curacy of expression, but these are the very points that the written exercise 
commonly ignores. “Shall a pupil in geography receive a deduction from 
his credits merely because his spelling is abominable?” “Spelling is not 
geography.” “Because he cannot paragraph correctly, is his knowledge of 
history diminished?” His punctuation and his capitals are problematical, 
but what has that to do with his knowledge of numbers, of personal char- 
acter, of climate and productions. 
The recitation should be oral, instinct with life, and full of interest, with 
an occasional examination, written briefly, carefully, and correctly, with all 
the elements of a written exercise carefully noted and corrected. 
So important a part does the recitation, under the skillful teacher, play 
in the school economy, that in comparison, as it seems to me, the written 
examination is nowhere; and I am coming more and more to the opinion 
that a pupil who has acquitted himself with credit in the daily recitations 
should pass on to the next grade unquestioned, despite any failure in the 
stated written examination of his class; that a class which has shown itself 
qualified for the work of the grade should, on its completion, be passed to 
the next grade without the test examination. 
The written examination, without any intent, or fault of the examiner, 
may be and often is outside the qualifications of the pupil. The teacher 
may have erred in her instructions, but should the pupil suffer? The prin- 
cipal should be so well acquainted with the quality of the instruction, and 
the application of the class, that it should not be possible for it to come to 
the end of its grade-work without some fitness for advancement. Rarely, 
I think, should a pupil be put down, or kept back, by a formal examina- 
tion, when the daily recitations have been satisfactory. The examination 
is valuable, chiefly, in relieving the teacher from the charge of partiality, 
or prejudice. I have often wished that pupils, that classes, might be pro- 
moted, not on the results of any formal examination, but on the promise of 
their daily work for future success. No one, in preparing a set of ques- 
tions, can say much of their worth in determining the scholarship, the power,

of the pupil. He may strike points, important indeed, but which had been 
partially neglected by the teacher in her zeal in other directions, and the 
pupils will fail, while exhibiting a power of thought, a skill in analysis of 
character, a discrimination and judgment, of more worth than an accurate 
statement of the facts involved. I recall an instance in which the pupil 
showed an utter ignorance of the subject required, but at the same time, in 
admitting the disqualification, gave such an evidence of elegant diction, of 
clear, distinct thought, so much originality, that my better judgment would 
not permit me to pass any other than a meritorious judgment upon her 
ability. 
I have not dwelt much upon the methods, the details of the recitation; 
these must depend largely upon the individual teacher and the subject. 
There is, I think, no best method for all teachers, in presenting any subject. 
There are certain underlying principles that should always direct and con- 
trol, certain things to be forever avoided. 
Nor should the same method be followed at all times; now should come 
the topical recitation, in which the pupil can present his views in some full- 
ness and elegance of language; now the quick, short question and answer; 
the pupil now feeling his way along thoughtfully and carefully, and now 
prompt with the ready rejoinder; now with the crayon in hand illustrating 
his descriptions, and again essaying the abstract argument in concise, dis- 
criminating terms; at one time promptly and accurately performing a pre- 
pared example, and again applying the principles to a problem with different 
but similar conditions; taking our pupils out of the ruts of routine, and 
leading them into ways of thought and intelligence; not machines, but 
coming men and women. But there should always be, in all these exer- 
cises, a tendency, a nearer approach to a distinct enunciation, correct lan- 
guage, pleasing tones, and plain reason. Nor is ease and grace of manner 
to be forgotten, as shown in rising and sitting, in walking across the room, 
in standing, holding the book, and handling the pointer. Little things, all, 
and not to be made the means of annoying the pupil, but to be encouraged, 
cultivated, cherished; not to be brought into too great prominence, or re- 
garded as the absolute need of the statesman or the successful workman, 
but as attractive in the school as in the home, and having a larger influence 
upon the conduct, the character, than is often imagined, and almost insep- 
arable from those kindly relations between teacher and pupil without which 
no school can attain to its true position as an educating, civilizing institu- 
tion. 
When our tables of statistics show us 28,000 in the first grade, 16,000 in 
the second, 9,000 in the fourth, it would seem that we can hardly begin the 
good work too soon or too lovingly. 
Entering the lowest room, while in those sweet, childish tones come up 
the simple words, “ Where do all the babies go?” I often find myself invol- 
untarily coupling with it the daisy line, “Largely underneath the snow.” 
Where are the remainder of the 28,000 who came to us last September?

, four pupils could be, from six to fourteen years of age, under the kindly 
care and have their recitations under the wise guidance and inspiring breath 
of earnest, sympathetic teachers, such as may be found in our own schools» 
whose names answer promptly to my thought, some whose faces have long 
been familiar in our schools, and some who can count their length of service 
only in months, this love of knowing, of learning, would, it seems to me, be 
kept alive; the eye would kindle at the thought of school and teacher; the 
hand, the heart, the mind and soul would all grow quicker, stronger, ten- 
derer; more sensitive to good influences and suggestions, more skillful to 
do, more hopeful to dare, and stronger to resist evil; truer to the right. 
And where, with her sixty pupils, restless with young life, glowing with 
childish ardor to do, to try, to know; coming from homes of penury, or of 
plenty, but all alike hungering for that which shall respond to their wants— 
where can there be a field of more absorbing interest, of brighter promise, 
and to the truly chosen, of richer reward? And where should there be 
awakened a deeper sense of duty and responsibility, brightened by a tinge 
of higher hope and fonder expectation, than in the recitation-room of the 
Public Graded School? 
LITERATURE FOR CHILDREN TO THE FRONT. 
MARY E. BURT, CHICAGO, ILLINOIS. 
“Tf I were asked to make a symbol of God,” says the author of Ben 
Hur, “I should represent Him by a long line, whose beginning might be 
extended into the eternal past, and whose end might be prolonged into the 
eternal future; whereas if I were to draw a symbol of man, I should rep- 
resent him by a circle, since man, with all of his progress, always comes 
back to the point whence he started.” 
That a long line is a fitting symbol of the Eternal, we do not doubt; and 
looking back over the sweep of the centuries—those centuries whose his- 
tory is surely recorded —it is questionable whether, instead of the circle as 
an appropriate symbol of man, a creature forever doomed to follow his own 
track to an original starting-point, the long line may not be an equally ap- 
propriate sign of the divinity within him, walking straight forward, hand- 
in-hand with the All-Father, stumbling, wavering, perhaps, but keeping on. 
“Education,” says President Eliot, of Harvard, “is a long line; it is not 
a something to be received in sections—a little of something completed 
here, a bit of something perfected there —it is a growth, long and continu- 
ous.” 
The long line which means education to the one, is most suggestive of 
that which means God to the other, and closely parallel to it, since educa-

tion is a growing into the knowledge of truth. To recognize the Eternal 
Love as revealed to us in His glorious works throughout the countless ages 
of the past, or through the visions of the present, or as suggested by the 
intimations of the future; to see the truth—truth as written by the finger 
of the great Creator, on the rocks and in the rivers, on the blossom and 
in the bird’s song, and, above all, in the development of human thought as 
we find it in the songs of men—this is education. 
It is to this long line we must look for a standard, that, measuring the 
lines we are drawing by the long line of truth, we may see where we stand 
in the pathway of progress. 
“Tt seems to me,” says Max Miiller, “the highest aim of all knowledge 
to try to understand what is, by learning how it has come to be what it is. 
That is the true meaning of history, and that seems to me the kind of 
knowledge which schools and universities are called upon to cultivate and 
to teach.” 
The “long line” is that which shows how mankind has come to be what 
it is. ‘The proper study of mankind is man.” Not man, the American, 
as we see him walking in our streets, not him alone; not man, the English- 
man only, as he comes to us in the pages of Addison or of Shakespeare; not 
man, the German, as we find him in Schiller’s works; not man, the Roman, 
as Livy has portrayed him; not man, the Greek, as Plutarch has recorded 
him; not the kings and queens of court-ridden history in any age or any 
clime ;— but man in his walk with God adown the ages; man in his growth 
from “the childhood of the world” to his taller stature, his present, his 
future; man in his moral progress as revealed in his own writings. 
To think in centuries, to think in vast sweeps of time, where perhaps we 
have thought in days or in years—this is to comprehend the life of man- 
kind. 
The babe in his cradle measures life by the short periods during which 
he waits to have his hunger satisfied. The little child measures life by the 
distance between the breakfast and the dinner bell, until he is old enough 
to think in days, counting time by the rising and the setting of the sun; 
he can think in weeks when he measures existence by the length from one 
Sunday to another. “I know a year because it is all the time from one 
Christmas till the next,” said one child; and “I can think a whole year, 
because it’s when I am in school, and it’s my vacation, too,” said another. 
To think in seasons, from the sowing to the reaping, and never to think in 
larger measure, is the fate of many a farmer; in periods of four years, from 
one election to another, the fate of politicians; to think in days, from the 
opening of school to its close, or in periods of four weeks, from one pay-day 
to another, the habit of an occasional teacher—the teacher who is more 
concerned with the getting of daily bread than with the giving of the bread 
of life. It is when we reach the truly earnest student, the philosopher, the 
scientist, that we find man thinking in centuries, thinking in ages, with a

greater definiteness of purpose and a clearer vision than is possessed by the 
artisan, the limit of whose thought is the material in which he is working 
and an eight-hour law. It is when we come to such men as Goethe, Max 
Miiller, Guyot, and John Fiske, that we realize that the true scientist is not 
the man who holds up to us some victim slain, “bloody side out,” for our 
inspection, but the man whose mind sweeps up and down the centuries as 
the hand of the skillful musician sweeps over the keyboard, touching 
always the right key, proving more for the spiritual world than does the 
physical scientist for the physical world. How the pages of history, the 
songs of poets, the writings of nature, range themselves panorama-like 
before us at the bidding of such men, and teach us that a real study of 
literature must stimulate the curiosity as it has stimulated their curiosity, 
and beget a scientific habit of thought as it has in them. 
We call the man who, with microscope and knife in hand, bisects, dissects, 
vivisects, and inspects some poor, bleeding animal, a scientist. He shows us 
the science of life, we say. But what has he done? He has catalogued into 
orders and families and series and classes and divisions and groups; he has 
given us descriptions and descriptions, and words and words and words with- 
out end, but he has not given us the secret of physical life. 
We call Aeschylus a poet. Passing through a conflict on which hung the 
emancipation or the enslavement of the civilized world, with eyes whose 
more than microscopic clearness had descended into the depths of human 
consciousness, discerning the motives that move mankind, he has given us 
in his drama, “The Persians,” the results of a keener insight and a larger 
vision than is required to discover and classify every muscle and bone in 
animal organism. And A®schylus is a “poet,” while your worker in the 
physical is a “scientist.” 
Is he, then, so much more of a scientist who, with his microscope, discovers 
the relation of two atoms, or without his microscope discovers the relation 
of the bone to the muscle, than the one who, studying the actions of men, 
singly and in masses, discovers and records the relations between their mo- 
tives? Down with such assumption! 
There are ninety-nine missing links to every one that is found in the world 
of matter to prove the evolution of the higher physical form from the lower. 
And there is not one missing link in literature—this greatest of all the 
sciences—the science which proves the evolution of the human soul out of 
the lowest form of. intelligence in the direction of the God-like. 
Herbert Spencer, in his “Education,” speaks quite deprecatingly of the 
man who knows more about Iphigenia than he does about his eustachian 
tubes, and in this connection writes about the ornamental overriding the 
useful. 
“Wesympathize more with Iphigenia than we do with Prometheus,’ writes 
a little girl in a review of the two poems, “ because she sacrifices herself for 
the good of men with less complaint.”
-P-A-G-E-256
  256 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  
Eustachian tubes versus self-sacrifice. The world lived millions of years 
and its eustachian tubes got on very well, and men did not know they had 
any; but men never did and never will get on without self-sacrifice. 
And yet eustachian tubes are useful, while the study of self-sacrifice is 
ornamental! We can all take Iphigenia to heaven with us, but our 
eustachian tubes we must leave behind. Let us hold fast to the eternal. 
“Literature is the best expression of the highest life of man,” the best 
expression of his accumulated experience in his long walk upon the earth; 
and it holds the keynote by which man must find his relation to the uni- 
versal. The teacher who regards it as a science, the science of the evolu-— 
tion of human thought, the development of morality in its progress through 
the ages, will so place it before the child. And she can well trust that its 
innate power, appealing to the child’s intelligence, will awaken a greater 
sympathy with moral progress than any superimposed rules of conduct. 
In looking over the abstracts of pupils, both younger and older, I find 
the strongest points made and the most constant interest expressed in the 
influences which have come into the world to further on the progress of 
good, and a decided tendency of purpose to join the line of march. And 
nothing less than some knowledge of universal literature, the thought of 
mankind in its evolution from the early ages to the present day, is sufficient 
to supply the subjects whose comparison shall furnish all the evidences 
necessary to prove that there is such a line of march. And so, to get on 
faster, and show the material from which lessons can be drawn, I have 
made and present to your consideration a rough and most unpsychological 
chart; and for fear that some of you who have not studied psychology may 
mistake these symbols for the real thing, I will say, (as did Snug, the joiner, 
who, in playing the lion’s part, showed half of his face through the lion’s 
neck lest he should scare the ladies, and told them plainly he was Snug, the 
joiner,) this black line is not really Dante—it is only a black line drawn 
in the form of a triangle, whose base shows when and how long Dante lived, 
and whose altitude represents his height in my affections. 
Looking over the long line, we find that more than forty centuries lie 
within our ken, and of these forty about twenty-four are lighted with au- 
thentic history, while sixteen glimmer through the ignis fatwus of legend. 
Taking, then, the four thousand years as a starting-point in the long line 
whose beginning and end are in eternity, let us take the birth of Christ as 
the culminating point—the point from which to reckon both before and 
after. Placing a landmark at 450 B.C., a second at about 1000 B.C., and 
a third from ten to any number of centuries further back, let us say that 
before Christ was born man lived through three great periods of life and 
thought. Placing a landmark between twelve and fourteen centuries after 
Christ, a second at 1600, a third at 1750, and a fourth which shall cover 
the nineteenth century, let us say that up to the present time man has lived 
through seven outbursts of brilliant thought, these epochs being preceded

each by decades or centuries of germination—slow, quiet, sure stages of 
growth, such as the plant knows in its warm earth-bed ere it sends forth its 
blossom to delight with its odor, while it surprises with its increased size 
and multiplied petals. 
Man starts out on this long line in the myth-making age, wondering who 
he is and where he came from, wondering at everything; unclothed, living 
in caverns, with no tools, with nothing but the great stage on which he is 
to play his drama, the great drama of human life in its eternal develop- 
ment, the drama in whose third act you and I to-night take a part. As our 
primitive actor steps forth on this great stage, on whose every part the 
Eternal has painted his messages; this stage over whose lofty land-masses 
he shall climb, in whose fertile valleys he shall find food and rest, through, 
whose mountain-passes he shall march as a conquering host, and before 
whose fierce storms he shall be driven as are the leaves of the wind, he 
begins to examine his stage, and he finds that his life is to be a geographical 
drama—a drama which must fit itself to his stage from the beginning to 
the end—and that only so far as he understands his stage can he play his 
part. Let us not, then, ignore man’s stage, if we hope to understand his 
drama; let us not expect to know the mental and moral consequences, un- 
less we know the physical causes which have in part forced them. 
If we follow man’s destiny adown the long line of his development in 
such a manner that our knowledge of him may be a scientific knowledge, 
we shall look upon his stage in its gigantic proportions, the arrangement of 
its terrestrial masses played upon by the forces of nature, and while pictur- 
ing its green slopes and its golden plains, “rise to causes and descend to 
consequences, without which there is no true science.” It is through a 
proper study of geography, connecting literature constantly with it, that 
we get at a correct knowledge of the drama, without which the stage would 
be a mockery. Geography—physical geography—has much to do with 
literature; and literature has everything to do with geography. Since all 
the forces of nature have tended toward man’s development, those same 
forces have tended toward the production of his literature; and as through 
a scientific study of literature we may see what has produced the man of 
the present century, so must we find in geography the conditions which pro- 
duced much of the literature. 
During ten years I took forty minutes a day, for one hundred days in the 
year, to stand at the blackboard and teach children to draw from memory 
each State and Territory in the United States on the usual plan, asking 
such questions as: What and where is Okefinokee? Spell Chattahoochee, 
Ocmulgee, Oconee, Tugaloo. Describe the Ogeechee. Bound Georgia. 
All this, and more, on the supposition that I was teaching geography. As 
if spelling Chattahoochee, Ocmulgee, Oconee, Tugaloo, or locating Okefino- 
kee had very much to do with our study of mankind, past, present, or 
future! Four thousand minutes to teach a few meaningless names, a few

dotted lines, and a few unrelated facts, when under the same school system, 
and in the same time, I might have pictured forth the whole stage of man, 
and-made it alive with his drama, if I had only appreciated the oppor- 
tunity. 
Guyot says: “The first glance we cast upon the annals of the nations en- 
ables us to perceive a singular but uncontestable fact, that the civilization 
representing the highest degree of culture ever attained by man, at the dif- 
ferent periods of his history, do not succeed each other in the same places, 
but pass from one country to another, following a certain order. This order 
may be called the geographical march of history.” And he proceeds to set 
forth in rapid review the great geographical phases through which human 
societies have passed in their gradual improvement. In the same manner 
might he trace the geographical march of literature. For aside from the 
fact that local geographical conditions have always furnished literature with 
the features which have made it graphic—low, marshy countries giving 
dread giants or evil spirits, such as the imagination pictures in fogs and 
mists, the winds furnishing sometimes heavenly messengers and sometimes 
demons of pestilence, the rivers hundred-handed serpents and fruit-giving 
gods— aside from these facts are the larger relations between literature and 
geography. Level off the plateaus of Asia and you have leveled off the 
conditions that led up to Homer and to A%schylus and made their poems 
possible. Level off the plateaus of Europe and you have leveled off all that 
gave us a Shakespeare, a Goethe, a John Fiske. Geography and history 
have no value in education except as they serve some moral end. How im- 
portant is it, then, that they fall in line, working hand-in-hand with litera- 
ture to the highest purpose: the moral development of the child; the earth, 
instead of a colored paper marked off into sections with dotted lines—a 
glorious picture of fields, forests, mountains, with the golden sun sinking 
from out the sky, the home of mankind; and history, instead of being “the 
mere tissue of names and dates, and dead, unmeaning events,” or a catalogue 
of court intrigues—the record of the heart-beats of humanity, an exposition 
of the principles which have directed the masses of mankind, literature, in 
fact, for that is what the science of literature is. 
Like the earth in its development from a gaseous condition to a liquid, 
from a liquid state to a solid, human thought has passed from the floating 
vagaries of mere perception to the flowing condition, fancy and imagination 
in the myth, and from that to its stately land-masses in the epic and the 
drama. 
Having lingered long to notice the adjustment of the drama to its won- 
drous stage, let us look more closely at the drama itself and see what it con- 
tains that shall from year to year broaden the child’s mind and lead him on 
to that “comparative study, without which there is no true science;” for to 
read for reading’s sake is no better perhaps than to drink for the sake of 
drinking.

  LITERATURE FOR CHILDREN. 259 
  
The myth-making age is the “childhood of the world,” the ages when the 
spirit of man expressed itself in the myth; the ages when did man as does 
the little child of to-day, “see God in the clouds, and hear him in the winds.” 
Here did man think in pictures and record in stories; here did man con- 
ceive the powers of nature to be persons, and dignify them with superhuman 
attributes. In like manner, the child of to-day lives through the myth- 
making period. The minds of children revel in the big, the marvelous, the 
mysterious, and every nursery has its own home-spun mythology. A little 
blue-eyed three-year-old, with a face of cherubic sweetness, looked up at his 
mother and said, “Please tell me a story, and I want it very fierce!” A 
little five-year-old invited me to walk with him to a frozen river, on condi- 
tion that we should go where it was dangerous. He took along a small 
whip, and, running against a bush covered with dead leaves and snow, 
whipped it until it was bare, saying, “There! I have killed a giant!” To 
show that his myth-making faculty and his valor were fully balanced by 
his prudence and reason, I will add that he sent me on the ice first, to 
make sure that it was not too dangerous for himself. A little girl recently, 
on hearing thunder, wanted to know how the fire-engine got up into the 
sky; and on the fourth of July a small neighbor asked, “What does God 
think when He sees the skyrockets coming up?” Mythology always ap- 
peals to children, for it is near to their own lives; and we have found that 
those children who are outgrowing their own myth-making period, in pri- 
mary grades, take an increased interest in it when looking at it as the early 
life of mankind. Immediately they set about comparing it with later sto- 
ries, “true stories,” to make sure that they themselves can discern which 
is fact and which is mythology; and they watch the prattle of their little 
brothers and sisters at home with a new pleasure; it begins to mean some- 
thing to them. Mythology has many ends to serve in the child’s education. 
Appealing to the child’s fancy and imagination, his brain begets the power 
of picturing, and on this power of picturing depends in later years his 
ability to reason. Take this from the child, and you have induced stu- 
pidity. Probably the most practical thing mankind ever did toward econo- 
mizing the energies of the human race, was to give itself in its infancy to 
myth-making. 
Passing to the age of Homer, we see the floating masses of thought tak- 
ing form in the substantial epics, the Iliad and Odyssey. The name of 
Homer covers a whole period of literature. “It is from the poems of 
Homer alone that the historians gather those pictures through which they 
present to our imagination the state of society in prehistoric Greece.” 
“At this point of history,” says Symonds, speaking of the age of Pericles, 
“the drama was a necessary product. The forces which had given birth to 
other phases of art were abundant and awaiting further development. 
Here, nothing but the presentation of humanity in action could possibly 
have satisfied the men who had themselves fought at Thermopyle, Mara-
-P-A-G-E-260
  260 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL sbnowi carte 
thon and Salamis, thereby enacting that drama of real history whereon 
hung the fate of future civilization. Here, gods and heroes no longer ap- 
peal to man’s wonder and imagination, but they stand as types of human 
nature — representatives on a grand scale of that humanity common to all 
men in all ages.” “Thus did mythology become a text-book on morality ” 
—a prophecy of Christ. “If you work, you will get flocks and herds, and 
folks will envy you. Do right and abstain from wrong, in order that you 
may be richer than your neighbor. Call your friend to your banquet, and 
leave your enemy alone; invite him most who lives nearest to you, for he 
will be most useful in time of need; love him who loves you, and give to 
him who gives to you.” With such a clownish beginning in Hesiod, (700 
to 800 B.C.,) the moral progress of mankind shows itself in Socrates and 
Plato in an almost Christian form. “Punish my sons, O judges, if they 
care for riches before virtue.” “It is. not right to return an evil to any 
man, however one may have suffered from him.” “TI choose to suffer un- 
justly, rather than to act unjustly.” 
In the age of Pericles, too, did the problem, “What is the origin and 
destiny of man?” begin to peal out as the one great problem of mankind— 
the problem which, centuries before, was suggested in the low complainings 
of Hesiod, in the dawn of ethical inquiry, and issued forth in the teach- 
ings of the philosophers and poets of the two succeeding centuries. That 
“everything is evolved from water;” that “the elementary principle of the 
universe is earth;” that “fire is the basis of all things;” that “air is the 
groundwork of creation;” that “the multiplication table is the beginning 
and end;” that “the form-giving activity of the mind is everything;” that 
“opinion is the great all;” that the universe was “a great void, in which 
an infinity of atoms moved and met, like attracting like, until therefrom 
were developed all known forms”—these were the questions of the sixth and 
seventh centuries B.C.; these the portals for the emergence of science and 
philosophy out of the myth. Here did forty thousand pairs of eustachian 
tubes assemble to listen to the patriotic teachings of Iphigenia, the wail- 
ings of Philoctetes, the moralizings of Prometheus; and here did Socrates, 
drinking the poisoned cup for truth’s sake, lay himself down “calmly, as to 
a night’s repose.” 
Following this era are the centuries leading up to Christ —the years which 
gave us an Alexander the Great, a Pyrrhus, a Hannibal, a Caesar —these, 
and many more important factors in preparing the soil wherein the seeds of 
Christianity should take root; centuries of satire in writing, centuries of 
Greek decay, of Roman struggle and conquest; ages of military action, 
followed by the “Golden Age” of Latin writing, the age when Christ was 
born. Now for the first time can the child say, “I know a year, because it 
is all the time from one Christmas to another.” Here is the turning-point 
of history, in the midst of a brilliant epoch of writing, where the songs of 
the past are softened down, smoothed, polished, imitated, and too often cor-

rupted. Four centuries further, Rome declining, Christianity growing; 
Mohammed and one hundred eighty millions of followers. Two centuries 
more and a Charlemagne; a gateway has opened between the Northern 
barbarians of Europe and its Southern culture, and the fresh vitality of the 
North-men circulates through humanity, bringing to it new strength and 
life. Four centuries more, ages of chivalry, feudalism, crusades. The wor- 
ship of the Madonna has led to the growth of chivalric feeling toward 
woman; not woman, the human being who toils with her hands, not the 
plain, real woman of everyday life, but woman the angel, who never was 
and never will be except in the vain fancies of the unphilosophic. Thirteen 
hundred years to produce a Dante, a Chaucer, and a Niebelungen Lied; 
and just as the Iliad and Odyssey may be taken as a faithful mirror of one 
age of the civilized world, so does the Niebelungen Lied represent a corre- 
sponding era of Teutonic, Saxon, and hence of English life. Another hun- 
dred years for a Luther and a Reformation. Here, again, deep living leads 
to great writing, and the drama becomes a necessity. The spirits of 
ZXschylus and Sophocles live again in Shakespeare and Marlowe; the spirit 
of Aristotle is revived in Bacon; and Science, shaking off her lethargy, 
calls forth from its mysterious hiding-place the eustachian tube. ¢ 
But the drama of the Elizabethan period is not the drama of the age of 
Pericles. Then the theater was the place of worship—comedy springing 
from revel songs, and tragedy from songs of suffering. Now the drama is 
contented with bringing close before our eyes the manifest spectacle of hu- 
man existence, leaving mankind to draw such lessons as can be learned from 
life itself. Another sweep of a hundred years to Goethe, in whom Teutonic 
life culminates — Goethe, who throws open the door, that thought may take 
a new direction—the direction of the science of physical evolution, whereby 
the spirit of progress goes marching on. Thought becomes more subtle ; 
the lines furnished by preceding ages interweave; the simple wild flowers of 
Homer, Euripides, Ovid, Mohammed, the ages of chivalry, bloom again in 
the many-petaled blossoms of Browning, Tennyson, Hawthorne, Longfellow, 
and James Russell Lowell, always striking a higher key in morality, ever 
teaching a deeper ethical lesson. 
And how shall this long line of life be so used and adapted as to form a 
powerful instrument in teaching a child to economize his own energy? By 
teaching him a few of the important and many of the unimportant events 
at this end of the world’s history —events which lie within one or two cen- 
turies of himself—so that he shall go forth into the world thinking that he 
has had all there is of history, or at least all worth the knowing, and that 
only because it circles about his all-important self? 
By acquainting him with an occasional poem of one or two good nine- 
teenth-century poets, (with perhaps a rare mention of some early English 
poet,) and selections from several third or fourth-class prose writers of this 
age, and setting him afloat with the idea that he has been taught reading,

everything back of the sixteenth century being as carefully hidden from 
him as is his eustachian tube? 
Shall we destroy his artistic perception by giving him a few pages from 
the middle of some masterpiece, so teaching him to form opinions from frag- 
ments, instead of teaching him to see a total—to grasp an entirety —which 
is the key-note of power in the author as well as his reader? 
Shall we thrust upon him reading which involves the abstractions and 
complications of modern thought, instead of allowing him to enjoy the sim- 
ple and palpable truths which have been fundamental in the process of 
forming those complications? 
Or, descending to the depths of literary degradation, shall we conciliate 
with the money-making publisher, who would fill his purse by peddling to 
the public the platitudes of the most common-place minds—the “ Up-up-up, 
up-we-go!— Has-the-cat-a-rat?” literature—the veriest twaddle ever in- 
vented? 
This is a school reader, [holding up a worn-out, dog-eared school-book,] 
a genuine specimen, a fair sample of all the primary reading-books published ; 
a book from which thousands of children are reading; and it is nearly all 
the reading they have. 
And here is one lesson from the book: The picture shows two children 
quarreling. A little girl is trying to push a boy out of the room. Another 
little girl, sitting on the floor, is in grief over a bottle of spilled ink. 
The lesson reads: 
No, you shall not get in. 
You hid my hat, and you let Belle spill the ink. 
I will not let you in, and I will tell that you hit Belle. 
I think you are a bad, bad boy, and I will not let you in. 
In barrenness of thought, in grossness of style, in poor quality of moral 
purpose, and in its lack of relation to the universal, this lesson is a fair type, 
not only of the majority of lessons in first readers, but also (taking into 
consideration the ability of older pupils) a type of a majority of reading- 
lessons presented to children during the first six years of their school-life. 
The motive of this lesson, the book tells us, is to teach the child ‘to rec- 
ognize words at sight,” or the word-calling motive; and the introduction to 
the book informs us that “there is nothing more important in any vocation 
in life than a ready and correct use of language.” The book claims to be 
simple also, and nearly monosyllabic, I believe. 
Now I deny that word-calling is ever a sufficient motive in the teaching 
of reading, and I deny that monosyllabic reading is easy, and I deny that 
such reading leads on to a ready and correct use of language, or that a 
ready and correct use of language is the most important thing in any voca- 
tion in life. There is nothing whatever in such reading to economize any 
of the child’s energies, make him self-directing, build up his character, or 
lead him to see the present through the great lessons of the past. Being
-P-A-G-E-263

flat and stupid, the child will be nauseated with it and fail to gain the abil- 
ity to grasp good thought in later years. That book, torn and dog-eared, 
has been treated with all the dignity it deserves. 
In contrast with this kind of reading, let me place the following classic tale 
as only one of a great family of stories having some other mission than to 
teach children to recognize words at sight merely: 
“While Jupiter watched the earth and did what he could to make men happy, he 
noticed that, while they wore cloaks and coats, they had no pockets; nor had they 
any record of their good or bad deeds. So this all-wise father made them two 
pockets, one at each end of a long scarf which they might hang around their necks, 
to hold their good and bad actions. At first the people were delighted, and wore the 
pockets dangling where everyone might see them; but by-and-by the pocket that 
held the bad actions grew so large and heavy, and the good one looked so flat, that 
most of the people grew ashamed and did not like to carry them. ' But Jupiter said 
they must, and this is the way they managed: they covered the good pocket with 
ornaments until it looked very beautiful, and hung it in front, while the bad one 
was hung underneath the cloak, where no one could see it, and where it might grow 
very fat and cause them no shame.” 
Now what advantage has this lesson over that of the reader? First, the 
child, ever so young, can draw out the moral for himself with very little 
talk about it, and instead of having morality thrust upon him, work out the 
problem of good and evil for himself. Second, he can connect the story 
with two ages, watch an old seed from the myth-making age bloom forth 
into a blossom in the age of Christ, and so, before he knows it, begin the 
study of universal history. Third, the child can learn to distinguish be- 
tween a truth and a myth; and there is need enough of this, since the ma- 
jority of people still live in the myth-making age. Fourth, through such 
lessons the child would form a habit of grouping his facts in logical sequence 
—a habit strengthening to the memory—since the memory would always 
appeal to a chain of well-ordered events. Fifth, the young teacher who has 
never had a chance to read the classics can acquaint herself with permanent 
literature, cultivate a literary taste both in herself and in her pupil, share 
her own life with him, enjoy the best thought with him; instead of being 
bored with commonplaces, corrupting her own taste, spoiling her love for 
her work, while thrusting imbecility upon the child. “But teachers are 
not educated up to this point; it needs an expert to teach classic reading,” 
cries your objectionist; and this I deny. An ignorant teacher can do fairly 
well with any material which tends toward self-improvement, but it takes a 
supreme teacher to make anything out of bad material. When superin- 
tendents cease to come down to the level of poor teachers, they will find 
the poor teachers coming up to their own level. “What do you read?” I 
said to a ten-year-old boy who had left school to earn his living. “Oh, 
nothing,” was the reply. ‘And what did you read in school?” “Just my 
reader.” “And what did you find in your reader?” “Oh, subjects and 
predicates.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-264
    264 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  
Imagine Homer invoking his heavenly muse into a revelation of a nation’s 
deepest religious life just to provide little boys with subjects and predicates! 
“What are your pupils reading?” I asked a school principal. “Oh, I 
have no time to find out,” he said; “just look at that pile of examination 
papers,” pointing to a stack almost a foot high; “it takes all my time to 
mark them,” and he might have added that a sick teacher gave her vacation 
to help him. 
Think of a man deliberately picking a bushel of green apples and biting 
each one to ascertain its exact stage of greenness, an abundance of ripe fruit 
being within easy reach; as if his bite could make the green apple ripe. 
‘When the written examination comes in, the classic goes out. 
Among other educational delusions are these: That a dose of epigrams, 
taken periodically, is more conducive to growth than is a masterpiece; that 
easy science reading supplements the child’s observations in nature more 
effectually than does a masterpiece; that a rousing declamation of some 
patriotic “selection” will develop greater patriotism. Against all of these 
hallucinations I protest. The office of the epigram is to destroy breadth of 
vision, to beget an inability to find bottom principles or leading thoughts in 
writings whose parts are correctly arranged and related. The epigram has 
no educational value, except to serve as a text for discussion. The office of 
easy science reading is (with some exceptions) to discover for the child what 
he can discover for himself, and to destroy his sense of artistic unity; it be- 
ing at the best but a painfully labored series of pictures which do not make 
a complete picture. 
The office of the patriotic selection is to superimpose a superficial patriot- 
ism, which, according to psychological laws, a child cannot feel. I deny 
that the child is less patriotic who, after a careful reading of Shakespeare’s 
Julius Cesar, Livy’s account of Hannibal, The Philoctites of Euripides, 
and a Life of Washington, quietly says, “To me, George Washington seems 
the noblest of them all,” than the one who shouts “ Down with the traitor!” 
for the mere love of shouting. The one is the deep conviction of him who, 
looking up and down the’‘long line, sees the influences which have devel- 
oped the present out of the past, while the other is the expression of a spas- 
modic emotion, which would just as soon shout on one side as on the other. 
The masterpiece in literature is more than an inspiration to patriotism— 
more than a text-book on spelling, punctuation, pronunciation, subjects and 
predicates, rhetoric and oratory. It is more than a text-book on morality. 
It is more than a heart-history of the age in which it is written; more than 
a summing-up of all the ages preceding it; more than a prophecy of the 
ages to follow it. It is all of these, and more. 
As the physical scientist watches the plant that he may discover the 
secret of plant-life, that he may account for the form-giving energy which 
seizes on external forms and digests them, that it may reach its ideal in the 
blossom; so does the scientist in the world of thought search the master-
-P-A-G-E-265

piece for the form-giving energy of the soul which lays hold of the immor- 
tal past and the infinite present that it may place its own stamp upon the 
eternal future. 
“What is the destiny of man?” “What shall I do to be saved?” This 
is the great question of to-day, and it has always been the great question of 
the human race. It is not “How shall I best preserve my physical exist- 
ence for threescore years and ten?” but “ What assurance have I of eternal 
life?” “Shall the mind of man be put to permanent intellectual con- 
fusion?” 
Literature to the front! Out with “readers”! in with reading! Down 
with “pieces”! up with the masterpiece! “Let the great ring out great, 
and the small ring out small.” Let us find the evolution of the human 
soul. To him who has carefully read and compared the masterpieces of the 
different ages—to him it is given to know what the brightest star in our 
southern constellation, Sidney Lanier, has so nobly sung: “The catholic 
man hath mightily won God out of knowledge.”

MINNIE CAROLINE CLARK, KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI. 
There is no lack of evidence as to how English is taught. It is to be 
hoped that many here may have carefully viewed and considered this evi- 
dence, gleaned by the National, the Massachusetts, and Northern Illinois 
associations, and circulated, with important additions from school reports 
and colleges, through the Academy and other educational papers. 
There seems to be but one conclusion: that literature is gaining atten- 
tion; that it is ignorantly, indifferently, taught. 
The most hopeful thing, about, is our—hope, aided by undirected or ill- 
directed interest. 
If there be no retreat from this conclusion, it is fair to suppose that either 
there are teachers still unconverted, or that, by clinging to old customs, they 
“would not play false, yet wrongly win.” 
A nebulous enthusiasm is imagined to surround the whole subject. If any 
point is clear, it is the one so often admitted in general terms, such as “Oh, 
yes, literature is a good thing!” 
Pardon a little argument on an admitted point. 
What is the object of literature? 
The surprising answer has been given so often of late, that there can re- 
main only a few in this audience to be shocked by it. First and always, 
the object of literature-teaching is to educate a taste for the best books.

There shall be pleasure, unconscious acquirement of language, thought, 
and, perhaps, self-mastery therein. ~ 
Tell me, what is the hidden treasure of your soul? What is it most like? 
In the silence of your own nature, can you fancy a school —a stwdy—where 
that which you know to be nearest the divine spark within you might have 
been enlarged, brightened? 
Do you find the truth in summing the angles of a triangle greater than 
the truth in this: “He that ruleth his own spirit is greater than he that 
taketh a city”? I can see how the majority of students might get along 
without knowing about the sum of the angles; but certainly in my school- 
room there is no individual that has not daily need to demonstrate the lat- 
ter. The mental and moral pressure of circumstance comes heavily enough 
upon us all. Perhaps we may not agree with Victor Hugo, that a man is 
seven-eighths circumstance. However, that is no excuse for not modifying 
the part we may control. The fine grain of gold is beaten thin in the shop, 
the street, the home, the school, unless someone, somewhere, somehow, can 
help preserve it. It becomes superficial, and is worn away by life; your 
own experience will tell you how. 
Listen to the words of Bishop Huntington: 
“Tt is not scientific doubt, not atheism, not pantheism, not agnosticism, that in 
Our day is likely to quench the light of gospel. It is proud, sensuous, selfish, luxuri- 
ous, church-going, hollow-hearted prosperity.” 
It is said that angels only smile upon the deflections of men of upright, 
clean aims. But how many pupils come to us with clear ideas, clear state- 
ments, pure aims? ‘ 
Though there are all grades between, humanity is of two classes as to 
mental quality: those whose minds feed upon themselves, and those in 
whom this interior self-breeding power is lacking. Many worthy, useful 
people belong to the latter class; but the barren majority must associate 
with the prolific mind. This is done in two ways: through the direct in- 
fluence of books; through intercourse with those whose appreciation and 
sympathy are greatest. 
The bright, imaginative pupil is usually one of sound sensibilities; and if 
his nature be large and fine, he imparts to his class something of the inner 
vigilance that nourishes his own mind and quickens its productive power. 
Here we have an active, inspiring presence, moved through the cultivated 
genius in books. The weaker mind and speech is emboldened. To all who 
have eyes for the school-room, the flame that ascends from the kindling of 
disinterested thought in student, teacher, author, appears a pillar of light. 
Aside from the practical aid that arises, such an example alone becomes 
a purifying element. The clearness of reason, the up-flaming spirit of dis- 
interested thought, seem smothered in the wealth-worshipping incense where 
young ambition is cast. Do not boys and girls, men and women, learn 
through their daily desires— whether in Boston or Kansas City? What-

ever is most conspicuously before the eyes of the community becomes its 
chief educator. Therefore I would insist upon paying great attention to 
studies best adapted to counteract the taint of social atmosphere. 
I do not mean to make ascetics or mere readers of books, but through the 
media of varied reading to let the student find himself and the world about 
him. If he can peer into all places and learn to know truth under what- 
ever disguise, let one door and one eye after another be opened for him. 
Make the weak boy vigilant by arming him against the forms that his weak- 
ness must cope with. “The truth shall make thee whole,” should be to usa 
text sublime, if it holds any meaning at all. 
The Shakespeare that read and wrote in Stratford would have been a fine 
poet and teller of stories; but the Shakespeare we know let eye and ear 
catch in the London streets the realities that his genius reflects in the book- 
world. 7 
I glean from certain sources that the reading of books is a ‘“‘supertficial 
study,” to be classed with wax-flower-making and other accomplishments. 
It may be superficial, as all secondary school training is. Yet we have not 
decided to abolish high schools, because Pope says “A little learning is a 
dangerous thing.” A “little learning” for little learners is as essential in 
one branch as in another; and, O my brother schoolmaster, I believe one 
ean see where a “little” shallow reading would be a blessing upon you and 
upon your pupils! 
Do you know, sister colleagues, the Rhine legend of the seven beautiful 
sisters that, for their hardness and cruelty, were converted into the seven 
rocky islands, called the Schénbergs? Perhaps, if the sisterhood were to 
allow more of this pure “superficiality” to play over their natures and re- 
flect in the sunny faces of children, we should less often hear of the “hard, 
stony, teacher’s expression.” Helen Hunt is not the only critic, moreover, 
to tell us of the joyless, smileless, rayless American visage. 
The profundity of the book depends upon its relative size to the reader. 
You know Gulliver was the manikin in one country and the man-mountain 
in another. 
‘What books shall be read? There are plenty to be read in class together, 
and with pleasure and profit, as might be demonstrated from pupils. More- 
over, certainty and success may be assured from a superintended reading, 
outside of class. : 
This has to depend upon the individual, and the judgment of a teacher 
that is able, like the physician, to judge of “symptoms.” Let the pupil 
take his choice of several books brought before the class for outside reading ; 
let him change his mind, provided that, by the time set apart for home-read- 
ing, he can satisfy his physician—the teacher—after due consultation, of 
sufficient pleasure and regular progress. It isn’t the number of languages 
or books that determines the quality of their extract.

language learned.” A comparison of our facilities with those of the Middle 
Ages, seems to throw great weight on the side of modern languages and liter- 
ature. 
The chemist no longer seeks the philosopher’s stone. If you should ask 
the astronomer to cast your nativity, or predict from the stars the success of 
your latest stock venture, he would smile at the insult to his intelligence. 
There are those who refuse to be shut out of sympathy with our day and 
our generation, through too strict confinement in that “intellectual monas- 
tery” called the “ancient classics.” 
Montaigne tells us how, in the third story of his tower, he loved and ab- 
sorbed the little library —“ five rows of ancient volumes.” From these and 
the life about him he wrote those delightful essays. Still, it would be loss 
immeasurable to us, for the sake of ancient lore, to exclude an intimate 
knowledge of that noble circle at Weimar, where thought, activity, and an 
aristocracy superior to birth or wealth held sway! 
Through French I would look into a wonderful literature, enriched by all 
that could be gotten from a composite people after centuries of power, wealth, 
art and a culture such as never comes to the American. And I feel the new 
soul within me stirred by the strong, faithful, tender touch of the master — 
Balzac. 
However, if I have not had the discipline of learning to read the Comedie 
Humain, and Faust in all the perfection of the original, these things which 
Montaigne and Erasmus and Dante might envy me, are my inheritance 
through English; and from Bacon to Bellamy is a very rich legacy. 
Not far from here is the national cemetery. I will read “Rodman, the 
Keeper,” and “My Hunt after the Captain.” But Waterloo is full of mean- 
ing for me, too; and I shall give my class the story of Jackanapes, and “A 
Country Doctor.” Pity and tears follow these unknown heroes as readily 
as they do the “Blue and the Gray,” for love and hero-worship are of no 
country; and the broadest patriotism my boys and girls can learn is the 
spirit that teaches them to be their brother’s keeper wherever a wrong is to 
be set right. 
One of my colleagues, whom I delight to honor, asked me: “ But how do 
you mean to teach them literature through books?” I replied: “Exactly 
as you teach them physics and chemistry. Their reading is a touchstone to 
power. Your pupils are required to make their own apparatus, and perform 
their own experiments. You give them the elements, and let them work 
out their own salvation. Sometimes there is an explosion that you do not 
intend. Literature is taught in the same way. The teacher lets them fuse 
their own ideas; aims at felicity in suggesting and in exposing the unsound 
parts of argument.” 
If my experience with annotated texts were asked, I would express my 
opinion by asking you to look first on this picture: it represents— Faith, 
Hope, Charity.. And now gaze upon this: it is “Laocoén and his Sons.”

The former is a class enjoying a book without notes; the latter is a symbol 
of teacher and class wrestling vainly with annotated texts, 
Each pupil should invent his own method of “marking” a book, whether 
prose or poetry. Sometimes the recitation becomes a symposium, and a 
premium is put upon asking questions about any allusion not understood. 
Let us take one example from the book. The author says: “Does not Hun- 
ger Tower stand as a type of the utmost trial to what is human in us?” 
Many have marked this. One pupil asks to have it explained. The teacher 
gives the grim story of Hugolino; reads Shelley’s allusion to it; the follow- 
ing day brings Doré’s illustration of the victims in the tower, and reads 
from Dante. The allusion becomes clear then in its application to hungry 
lives. 
Here is another question arising from this sentence: “Mr. Tulliver had a 
destiny, as well as Cdipus, and in this case might plead, like Cidipus, that 
his deed was inflicted on him, rather than committed by him.” Fortunately, 
one clever boy can give this story concisely. When he comes to the point 
where the Sphinx propounds the riddle, the teacher asks the narrator to 
pause, and the class to answer. This part of the performance strengthens 
the impression of the fate that met Cidipus. 
Again, thé characters of our book enjoy music—good music, too—and 
make a worthy example for pupils. Allusion is made to the “Creation.” 
“Who wrote it? What is it?” There is one boy in the class that loves 
and knows music better than anything else. The teacher has longed to 
make him talk; now she has only to /et him. He tells about the oratorio; 
even sings a little. While he is sinking into his seat, trailing his heavy bass 
over the last words, “sinn ous woooo rm,” applause rises. 
Then some one asks an apparently valueless question: “ Who was Purcell? 
What music did he write?” The teacher answers: “How many of you re- 
member getting interested in a novel that caused a great sensation among 
our novel-hungry, great-grandmothers?” They cry out, “Evelina!” The 
teacher then recalls a few facts about the musical taste of the Burney family, 
and tells them that Purcell lived with Fannie’s father, etc.,etc. The musical 
boy begins to feel a bond between music and literature; and the class feel 
quite “at home” with Purcell and his music in the home of Fanny Burney, 
close by the festive, famous “mulberry tree.” 
Rhetoric should be studied constantly from the books read, and with the 
aid of a text-book used for reference; but it should not be taken up in the 
abstract till very late in the course. Scanning, figures of speech, improved 
taste, come from the first by easy, natural steps, if the best help and enough 
of it is called to the direction of taste. Few teachers are able to do all they 
wish; so the daily question is, “ What shall I leave undone?” 
With a persistency that has surprised certain observers and skeptics, I have 
refused to gather a crop until I had plowed, planted, sowed, and weeded.

insists upon gathering beans. I say, “ Wait, Sir Gardener; when necessary 
I will attend to the strings and sticks for them to climb upon. Can’t you 
see there are not even ‘bean-stalks’ yet?” 
As soon as the microscopic eye may detect a sprout of green, Prof. Rhet- 
oric, the trimmer, enters. He is attired in an old-time shade-hat, a shirt 
with a very stiff bosom-frill, corduroy trousers, and neat gloves. He holds 
in his hands garden-shears and pruning-knife, and insists upon snipping and 
pruning my tenderlings. I ery out upon him, and bid him stay outside the 
fence and bide the time of fairer fruits and statelier palms than his tools can 
furnish. 
Given time, it is easy to show that the writing of an English sentence has 
mathematical precision, plus other things of greater value. 
We wish everything were more clearly taught. I wish the laws of exer- 
cise, the daily rules for strengthening the body, were taught before poetry, 
but as a part of the poetry of existence. The perfect poise of life comes 
from balancing the physical and the mental. How can the teacher that 
allows himself or herself no relief, physical or mental, expect to remain a 
hale inspiration to the school? 
At the end of a second year in a large Western school, I am at my wits’ 
end to know what to do with the written work heaped upon me. Shall I, 
Euceladus-like, wriggle under this mountain, an accumulation of bad Eng- 
lish, from the primary grade up? No. I have heard that there is in the 
‘West an animal able to live upon food ordinarily considered indigestible. 
One of these animals can be bought for a few dollars. Why could not I 
purchase a burro, and feed it at public expense—as it were? If it could 
not live on nine hundred examination papers a week, (supposing I had only 
three written lessons a week,) how, by all the laws of self-preservation, could 
I be expected to% Shall I attempt to pepper all these papers with punctu- 
ation, and salt them with red-ink comment? Would it not be a greater 
service to the community to mount the said burro, and ride forth into field 
and street, whence I return, with fresh incentives for my class? 
However, the best way that I have yet found to surmount the difficulty is 
to allow each section the benefit of kindly reciprocal criticism. 
The chief error at first is repetition of word and idea. It is surprising 
how soon students learn to correct and to appreciate. They are not long in 
taking every advantage to improve their style, knowing that the same sub- 
ject, drawn from class or home-study, may be presented by another. This 
gives zest to the work; though, as the class should be like a family, there is 
no need of depressing an earnest, dull pupil by a sense of his comparative 
failure. There is usually some good to be said; if the critics fail to give it, 
the teacher will be able to supplement an encouraging remark. More- 
over, it is well sometimes to let the pupils see how the instructor takes his 
or her own instruction. Write a verse to order.on the board; let them 
choose meter and subject; paraphrase the passage you give them to do.

Last winter an advanced class presented a petition for a Christmas story; 
they dictated that it should be partly true. The teacher felt repaid for 
every hour spent in response to this request. What was the effect of this 
story about real Boston girls and boys? Aside from stimulating the hearers 
to better work, it made them happy and interested; it gave them the feeling 
that they, dearer to the teacher than characters of fiction, real boys and real 
girls, are in truth the heroes and heroines of the future. 
In written work the spelling would be appalling, were it not for a certain 
admirable consistency. For instance, the pupil that makes the following 
mistakes, is apt to hear and speak in the same fashion: Here are a-proach 
for ap-proach; dis-sa-pear for dis-appear; legions for legends; and such ex- 
pressions as “he relaxed into silence,” “irra-table genus” for irritable genius. 
Task something about Flanders. From my younger class I learn that it is 
in France, Italy, and England; that “Miles Standish got his name there;” 
that “Miles Standish met Julius Czsar there, because they fought there;” 
that “ Vittoria Colonna lived there.” After discussing a list of books placed 
on the board to illustrate the sectional literature of America, one young 
lady, who must have seen and heard the title “Hoosier Schoolmaster” sev- 
eral times at least, arose and soberly inquired: “Should you say ‘Who’s 
your schoolmaster?’ or ‘Who és your schoolmaster?’”” Another young lady 
was asked, when the class were giving questions to each other, to explain 
these lines: z 
“From the cold lakes of the North to the land where the Father of Waters 
Seizes the hills in his hands and drags them down to the ocean, 
Deep in their sands to bury the scattered bones of the mammoth.” 
She explained, after study, the “bones of the mammoth” to mean “the bones 
of the soldiers buried in the South after the civil war.” Yet the good things 
are far in excess of the bad; and the gain of individuals and classes is often 
in proportion to these amusing, distressing blunders. 
I ask one boy —the charming, average, typical boy —this: “L——, what 
do you believe is the advantage of stating a truth in poetical form?” He 
replies: “Oh —it strikes a fellow deeper!” One dear little fellow, the Caed- 
mon of his class, is trying to prove that Longfellow is not a greatly original 
poet. He says, “I’ve heard somewhere that a man has got to write from 
his heart; he’s got to suffer to be a great author. Now you all know that 
Longfellow had a pretty easy time of it!” 
Time does not permit me to state the variety of subjects and suggestions 
that may be given; nor can I illustrate the original treatment of such, and 
the method of testing the outside reading. Credit should always be given 
for this work; and the teacher can see that it is honestly done at home, while 
the time of the recitation hours is filled by listening to the essays. 
T have the report of a famous Western high school. The writer laments 
the feeble English of pupils that are presumably well trained in our “in- 
comparable language;” and adds that thought-power and command of
-P-A-G-E-272
  272 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  
words are seldom seen as an outgrowth of the supposed exercise. “There 
must be culpability somewhere,” he says. Then, in connection with the 
school library, follows this: 
“T am deeply convinced that if we can so center our influence upon a pupil that 
he will confide in the judgment of his teachers as to the character of his reading, and 
will seek their counsel in his selection of books, we will have accomplished for that 
pupil more than can be equaled by the sum total of all our other instruction. I 
have sometimes thought if a wise and experienced teacher, one who understood 
human nature and was in sympathy with it, would do nothing else than guide the 
pupils in the selection of the books they would read, it would be the wisest use of 
money which our schools expend. If every high-school pupil could say, with Fene- 
lon, ‘If the crowns of all the kingdoms of the empire were laid down at my feet in 
exchange for my books and my love for reading, I would spurn them all;’ or, with 
Gibbon, ‘A taste for books is the pleasure and glory of my life; I would not ex- 
change it for the glory of the Indies,’ what a revolution would be created in the 
character, life and happiness of our young people!” 
This is admirable! What could be better? The interest of the writer 
cannot be questioned. But, when I turn back to his course of study laid 
down in the report, I find English, as a study, only once a week during the 
first year; not at all the second year; English history during the third; and 
English and American literature massed together with Shaw's Manual, for 
the fourth year. How is it that only sixteen pupils out of the total number, 
209, are set down in English literature for the school-year 1888-89? I turn 
to a table that shows the number of books read by the school, but I find no 
evidence that this reading was duly directed and credited; and it appears 
that several may have escaped reading any valuable work. 
The strategies of a zealous teacher are beyond recital. It would not do 
here to relate how a lady went off to a base-ball game with a boy that cared 
rather too much for sports; nor how from that happy time forth there was 
a tacit understanding about work between the base-ball coterie and the lit- 
erature teacher, who was none the worse off for her recent lesson in “the 
game.” 
One day I sat down to talk with a rather sluggish, quiet boy. He had 
“never read a book,” as he said, and I was troubled by his apparent apathy. 
Accidentally, in rising, I thrust the corner of his morning paper into his 
eye. I begged pardon. .He pretended, with a boy’s courtesy, the pain was 
nothing. Later, I went to him, and said he seemed to be in the right con- 
dition to read a book in which the hero had an eye damaged by a lady — 
wouldn’t he let me repair my ravages by lending him the same? He con- 
sented; and the next day one of the boys brought him “One Summer.” It 
is a simple little story; but that boy not only read it and laughed over it— 
he began to work on his biographical sketch of the two D’Israelis, and on 
his reading; he came to me daily for advice; and finally won the applause 
of his class by. one of the raciest papers of the year. He has seemed eager 
and happy ever since.

If you can’t always in this way open a boy’s eyes to the beauties of lit- 
erature, you may invent something more creditable, and less liable to run 
him into the dangers incurred by the “wise man in our town,” who “jumped 
into a bramble bush,” etc., etc. 
It is out of. my power to touch upon the actual and probable, or to bring 
proofs of facts that I may have drawn attention to. The spur of larger 
attainment remains, though the exact line of limitation and conduct seems 
vague. We are not particularly well acquainted with ourselves. This must 
give us pause whenever we assert the value to others of any special work or 
author. Therefore greater scope should be our aim. My “free-necked” 
children “dare make reply,” and “dare reason why.” I accept the testi- 
mony of the three hundred under inspection, and find that they have learned 
to appreciate. I mean this in its full sense, though I put little stress in 
straining at comparisons of style. 
There is on Bedloe’s Island a lofty light: yet what ship does not, at times, 
take a pilot back and forth through the crowded harbor channels? So, 
Spenser, Bacon, Shakespeare, Milton, Wordsworth —scientific reading in the 
lofty abstract yielded to them—are intellectual lights, brilliant and stimu- 
lating to mature minds, though they are often cold, barren and unsatisfactory 
in the simple, every-day philosophy that guides the finer, difficult part of 
human nature. 
In conclusion, let me give direct from pupils what I believe are examples 
of the moral impression —the retaining power that comes from the “human- 
ities” of literature teaching. 
On his examination paper a boy, whose life is as hard as his mind is keen, 
states these impressions of the author of “Silas Marner”: “I hardly know 
what to say of her; it seems as if through her knowledge she can soothe any 
trouble, because she paints good and bad just as it is. I seem to feel what 
a good friend and mother is supposed to be.” In the proud, hard struggles 
of a motherless boy, is this not a noble example of “Das Ewigweibliche””— 
the ever-womanly leading us onward? 
A girl, below the average, speaking of the renunciation in the life of 
Charles Lamb, applies this thought, stored up by herself from the first good 
book she was required to read: “If life did not make duties for us before 
love comes, love would be a sign that two people ought to belong to each 
other.” 
In a boy’s essay, called “My Book Friends,” I find this: “The next pict- 
ure represents a broad, stormy expanse, once a wide plain, where the Floss 
hurried on to the sea. In a boat are man and woman, mutely gazing at each 
other: he with a look of humiliation, overpowered by a sense of life’s depths 
that had lain beyond his vision; she with eyes of intense life looking out 
from a weary, beaten face. Huge fragments of some wooden machinery are 
being floated along. The sun is rising now, and the wide area of watery 
desolation is spread in awful clearness around them. In dreadful clearness

float onward the threatening masses. ‘It is coming, Maggie, Tom said in 
a deep, hoarse voice, loosing the oars and clasping her. The next instant 
the boat is no longer seen on the water, and the huge mass is hurrying on 
in hideous triumph; but soon the keel of the boat reappears, a black speck 
on the golden water. The boat reappears, but brother and sister have gone 
down in an embrace never to be parted: living through again in one supreme 
moment the days when they had clasped their little hands in love, and 
roamed the daisied fields together.” 
A sad scene for the young, you say. It did seem sad and unnatural to 
have their book end thus! But what human prescience could have divined 
that a few weeks later this picture would be verified again and again amid 
the realities of the Conemaugh Valley? 
Knowing that “the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts,” we can 
only set before the mind something that lays hold on truth—which is 
always beautiful—and on philosophy. What prescience can reveal to the 
wisest the manifold experiences of life, where the echoes of the class-room 
or the thought noted in silence may not interpenetrate with a subtle sense 
of truth, or wisdom, or happiness? 
‘We must face all disasters of work, of life; and while, sometimes, the 
human pity of it all touches us with a sense of infinite pathos, perhaps we 
can find no better philosophy than this, marked by many a young hand in 
the worn copies of Mill on the Floss: 
“Nature repairs her ravages, but not all. The uptorn trees are not rooted again; 
the parted hills are left scarred; if there is a new growth, the trees are not the 
same as the old; and the hills, underneath their green vesture, bear the marks of 
the past rending. To the eyes that have dwelt on the past there is no thorough 
repair.”

THEME: PEDAGOGICAL INQUIRY. 
OBSERVATION AND EXPERIMENT ESSENTIAL IN 
PEDAGOGICAL INQUIRY. 
BY E. H. RUSSELL, WORCESTER,. MASSACHUSETTS. 
  
It is generally understood that the core of pedagogical inquiry lies in 
psychology, particularly in the psychology of the growing mind. The 
commonest remark in reference to the qualifications necessary for a teacher 
is that he should have a good knowledge of human nature, which is only 
saying that the mind is the center of the pedagogical system, around which 
all the rest revolves. There are two methods, more or less distinct, of study- 
ing the mind: one through consciousness, commonly known as the method 
of introspection; the other through the outward manifestations of mental 
activity, or by the method of observation. No one proposes to dispense 
with the first of these methods, for that would clearly be impossible. The 
question is, whether the method of introspection is sufficient; whether it 
does not require to be supplemented by external observation; whether, 
indeed, the chief emphasis in pedagogical inquiry ought not to be laid 
upon such observation, as is done in studying the natural sciences. 
The end in view, so far as the present discussion is concerned, is to con- 
sider how teachers, especially young teachers, and students in training for 
the work of teaching, may best gain some accurate knowledge of the mate- 
rial on which they are to exercise their art; namely, the nature of children, 
in order to adapt their efforts wisely and skillfully —that is, in harmony 
with natural laws—to the proper and effective training of the growing 
powers of the mind. c 
“For nature, crescent, does not grow alone : 
In thews and bulk; but, as this temple waxes, 
The inward service of the mind and soul 
Grows wide withal.” 
There are two sides to this question, according to the predisposition of 
those who engage in the study of it. Students who lean to the metaphysi- 
cal side of psychology naturally favor introspection, and may even consider 
it entirely sufficient, as a method of study; while on the other hand, those 
who approach the subject from the side of science, especially physiology, 
distrust introspection, and place small reliance on the mind’s ability to 
bring all its operations into the sphere of consciousness. It is not to be 
expected that this original and deep-seated difference of view will disappear

  under discussion; the present paper will only recommend that, for peda- 
gogical purposes, observation should receive a part of the attention usually 
given to the method of introspection. 
Let us first call as witnesses a few of those whose researches in this field 
have given them a clear title to be regarded as authorities or experts. 
It would be hard to find a more intelligent and candid psychologist, or one 
more generally known and respected among teachers, than James Sully. 
His position is by no means an extreme or partisan one. While holding to 
the view “that psychology is distinctly marked off from the physical or 
natural sciences as the chief of the moral sciences, having to do with the 
phenomena of the inner world, and employing its own method or instru- 
ment, namely, introspection,’ Mr. Sully, at the same time, recognizes and 
follows what he calls “the modern tendency to supplement the properly 
psychological study of mind by the physiological study of its nervous condi- 
tions and concomitants.” (Outlines of Psychology; preface, pp. v, vi.) 
He confesses that introspection “is unable to give us a wide and general 
knowledge of mind;” that there is “need of supplementing this direct source 
of knowledge with another and indirect,” namely, “the external or objective 
study of mind.” He goes on to say: “This includes, first of all, the widest 
study of the human mind, by means of its external effects. . . . In or- 
der. to make this observation comprehensible and fruitful,” Mr. Sully con- 
tinues, “we must be careful to include widely-unlike types of mind, due to 
differences of sex, temperament, and surroundings; also all stages of mind- 
growth, and particularly the phenomena of child-life.’ (Appendix A, 
p- 682.) 
This straightforward declaration should have all the more weight, as 
coming from one who is avowedly not of the camp of modern ultra-physio- 
logical psychologists. 
No psychologist of our time stands higher than Alexander Bain. In his 
essay on “The Art of Study,” he touches the matter under consideration, 
in thése words: “In the science of the human mind there are general doc- 
trines, contrived to embrace the world of mental phenomena. The student 
may have to begin with these, and work upon them exclusively for a time; 
but, in the end, phenomena must be independently viewed by him in their 
naked character, as exhibited directly in his own mind, and inferentially in 
the minds of those that fall under his observation.” (Practical Essays, 
p. 252.) 
The late George Henry Lewes, although less widely known to our profes- 
sion, was as profound a psychologist as either Sully or Bain. From his 
philosophical and suggestive work on “The Study of Psychology,” which, 
unfortunately, he did not live to complete, I quote the following: “If, then, 
it is indispensable that psychology should formulate the laws of the human 
mind, and not simply classify the individual states, the feelings and thoughts 
of others must be accessible; and if these are not accessible on their sub-
-P-A-G-E-277
PEDAGOGICAL INQUIRY. 277 
  
  jective side, access must be sought on their objective side. _We must quit 
introspection for observation. We must study the mind’s operations in its 
expressions, as we study electrical operations in their effects. We must 
vary our observations of the actions of men and animals by experiment, fill- 
ing up the gaps of observation by hypothesis. When the facts are known, 
and their conditions are known, so that experimentally the facts are repro- 
ducible, the aim of research is reached; the doctrine may then be con- 
structed.” (Op., cit., p. 99.) 
In another part of the same work, Lewes speaks of the change which a 
better apprehension of psychology is bringing about in the treatment of in- 
sanity and in education. He says, however, that the pedagogue has not yet 
got so far in this advance as the alienist. I quote a sentence or two: “The 
traditional conception of the mind as something different from the activities 
of the organism, determines, implicitly gr explicitly, his [the pedagogue’s] 
method of education. He [the pedagogue] tacitly assumes that all minds 
are specifically, no less than generically, alike, and he therefore teaches the 
same lessons in the same way to all.” (P.118.) 
However sweeping and unjust this statement may seem as applied to the 
better teaching of the present day, we must probably admit that it contains 
at least a certain measure of historic truth. 
The French psychologist, Ribot, in his interesting history of English Psy- 
chology, expresses at considerable length, substantially the same view. He 
says: “One of two things is the case: either psychology is limited to inte- 
rior observations, and these being completely individual, it has no longer 
any scientific character; or else it is extended to other men; it searches 
out laws, it practices induction, it reasons, and then it is susceptible of prog- 
ress; but its method is to a great extent objective. Interior observation 
alone is not sufficient for the weakest psychology.” (English Psychology, 
pp. 18 and 19.) 
“But,” continues Ribot, “in what does this objective method consist? In 
studying psychological facts from the outside, not from the inside; in the 
internal facts which translate them, not in the consciousness which gives 
them birth. . . . The objective method, instead of being personal, like 
the simple method of reflection, lends to facts an impersonal character; it 
bends before them; it moulds its thrones upon the reality.” (Op. cit., p. 25.) 
“Psychology,” (I am still quoting Ribot,) “as understood in its widest 
sense, embracing all the phenomena of mind in all animals, and considering 
them, not only under their adult form, but in the successive phases of their 
development, offers an almost boundless field for research. Hence, it is 
striking to observe how summary are all the hitherto most accredited trea- 
tises upon psychology. If we subtract historical digressions, what, in many 
instances, remains? We shall be still more impressed by this brevity if we 
compare psychological books with those of naturalists, which are laden with 
details. Whence arises this difference, if not from the method employed? 
18—n. B.A.  
-P-A-G-E-278
  278 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  
The latter collect facts with indefatigable patience, noting exceptions and 
differences; the former consist only of vague sketch and some abstract for- 
mulas. And yet, has not that principle which thinks, feels, acts and wills, 
in animated beings, almost infinite varieties, which are to be revealed only 
by the most minute investigation? Can we believe that a human soul may 
be described more briefly than a plant?” (Op. cit., p. 28.) 
‘I offer one more quotation from Ribot: “It seems to me that the best we 
can hope for psychology is, that it may be entering upon that period of ap- 
parent disorder and real fecundity in which every question is studied sepa- 
rately and excavated to its utmost depths. A good collection of monographs 
and memoirs upon special points would be perhaps the best ‘service which 
could now be rendered to psychological studies. No doubt all this is not a 
science; but, without all this, there is no science. Such a method would 
possess not only the advantage of substituting better tendencies for those 
which actually exist—the study of facts for hypothetical generalizations: it 
would also offer a task within the reach of all. In this work of detail each 
might share according to his measure and his strength. Many who could 
not be architects might cut stones skillfully enough. A hundred workers 
might, perhaps, wear themselves out over one obscure point. What matter, 
if a result be obtained? The science will accept their work, and forget 
their names. It will assume its true character—impersonality.” (Op. cit., 
pp- 32, 33.) 
Professor Preyer, author of that remarkable book, “The Mind of the 
Child,” in speaking of the observations which furnished a large proportion 
of the facts recorded in that work, makes the following remark, which is per- 
tinent to the present discussion: ‘To observe the child every day during the 
first thousand days of his life, in order to trace the development of speech, 
was possible only through self-control, much patience, and great expenditure 
of time; but such observations are necessary, from the physiological, the 
linguistic, and the pedagogic point of view, and nothing can supply their 
place.” (Op. cit., part II, pp. 186 and 187.) 
Dr. Stanley Hall, who, I need not'say, stands in the very front rank of 
American educationalists, in his introduction to the American edition of 
Professor Preyer’s work just cited, says it is a grave mistake for teachers to 
suppose that a text-book supplies the training they need in psychology. 
“All such books I know are far too abstract and schematic; too much de- 
voted to definition, or in some cases, even controversy; too common-place 
and traditional in their subject-matter, so as to be sometimes an impediment 
to the fine tact and instinct that, in minds of finest fiber, divine, perhaps un- 
consciously, the needs and individual nature of children. 
“The living, playing, learning child, whose soul heredity has freighted so 
richly from a past we know not how remote, on whose right development all 
good causes in the world depend, embodies a true elementary psychology. 
All the fundamental activities are found, and the play of each psychic pro-

  cess is so open, simple, interesting, that it is strange that psychology should 
be the last of the sciences to fall into line in the great Baconian change of 
base to which we owe nearly all the reforms, from Comenius down, which 
distinguish schools of to-day from those of the sixteenth century. It is a 
striking fact that nearly every great teacher in the history of education who 
has spoken words that have been heeded, has lived for years in the closest 
personal relation to children, and has had the sympathy and tact that gropes 
out, if it cannot see clearly, the laws of juvenile development and the lines 
of childish interest.” (Op. cit., part I, pp. 22 and 23.) 
The foregoing witnesses, Sully, Bain, Lewes, Ribot, Preyer, Hall, are all 
men who speak with authority. A larger number might easily have been 
summoned to the stand, whose words would simply swell the volume of testi- 
mony without adding materially to its convincing force. Their views point 
plainly to two things: first, the inadequacy of the method of introspection 
in psychologic study; and secondly, the necessity of observation and experi- 
ment, not as superseding, but as supplementing introspection, and giving to 
the study of mind objective reality and completeness. 
Does not Lord Bacon really speak to the same effect when he says: 
“Studies themselves do give forth directions too much at large, except they 
be bounded in by experience”? 
Perhaps at this point we might consider our thesis proved. But there is 
a further fact which will bring the proof home to many teachers of psychol- 
ogy with the force of personal experience. It is the almost universal prac- 
tice, in teaching this subject, to appeal with great frequency not only to the 
testimony of the pupil’s own consciousness, but also to the language and 
conduct of men as observed in every-day affairs, and especially to the say- 
ings and doings of children. Reminiscences, anecdotes, popular maxims 
and proverbs, idioms—in short, all objective expressions of mind, are sought 
for and relied on to convince and satisfy the student, almost, if not quite, as 
much as specimens are relied on in the natural sciences; and the instructor 
who is most ready and expert in the use of these concrete examples is not 
only the most lively and interesting in the class-room, but also the most lu- 
cid and persuasive. The facts of observation are confidently offered and 
instantly accepted as of the highest authority. The difficulty is, observed 
facts are apt to range themselves on more than one side of the question, and 
so to take on a bewildering ambiguity. We grow tired of the resulting per- 
plexity and delay, and sometimes are fain to take refuge in theories whose 
completeness brings great relief to all but the hardiest and most patient 
spirits. But perhaps such repose, however grateful, is purchased at too dear 
a cost. We should beware of the temptation that comes upon us in weak 
moods of the mind, to belittle a great problem for the sake of getting at an 
easy or speedy solution of it. Psychology seems peculiarly beset with such 
temptations. There is indeed perennial fascination in the idea of under- 
standing human nature to the core. Who does not long for some secret

clue to the intricacies of character? At times the door even seems ajar, as 
when some key, like the doctrine of temperaments, or of physiognomy, or 
of phrenology, holds out its glittering, momentary promise of revealing the 
long-kept secret. Some of us are old enough to recall, perhaps with a slight 
flush of mortification, the eagerness with which we once hailed the possibil- 
ities of phrenology — possibilities which our youthful ardor easily translated 
into probabilities, or even certainties. What a revelation it seemed! A 
few passes of the hand over the surface of the cranium, and you could tell 
off, blindfolded, every mental trait, even of a perfect stranger, with as much 
readiness as an educated blind man reads with his finger-tips the embossed 
words of his printed page! But to-day, like so many other specious arts of 
reading character, phrenology has withdrawn into the dimmest corners, or 
vanished into thin air. It has given place to the slower and surer inductive 
method of science, whereby Dr. Ferrier and others have been seeking, in 
recent years, to ascertain the truth in regard to the localization of cerebral 
functions. 
Is it not possible that we have of late years been too much stirred with a 
kindred hope by the apparent perfection of modern psychology? 
‘When we have mastered the book with its complete terminology —so easily 
put in tabular form upon the blackboard, so neatly transferred to the note- 
book—have we, or have we not, found ourselves in possession of the coveted 
solution of the great problem? Or, do the old mysteries of character and 
conduct remain for the most part mysteries still? 
For myself, I confess to a feeling not wholly of satisfaction when I contem- 
plate the summary and finished character of the current schemes of psychol- 
ogy. There is about them a certain pride of system and completeness that 
breeds distrust, or at least discontent. While I study them, and still more 
when I put them to practical tests, the words of Shakespeare keep ringing 
in my ears: 
“But man, proud man}! 
Most ignorant of what he’s most assured, 
His glassy essence.” 
Not that I feel competent to mend these systems, or replace them with bet- 
ter—far enough from that. But I am bound, nevertheless, in frankness, to 
express a doubt whether we have yet arrived at the final psychology. Some 
years ago, I conceived the project of reducing the writings of Shakespeare 
to a sort of psychological system or conspectus. You will smile, as I do 
now myself, at the rashness of such an undertaking; but I argued that since 
the great poet is confessedly our most consummate master of the human 
mind, his delineations of its manifold workings, if carefully analyzed, pas- 
sage by passage, and arranged in an order corresponding to our modern 
classification of faculties or activities, (which is believed by so many to be 
accurate and exhaustive,) would serve as a luminous exposition and illus- 
tration of nearly the entire range of mental phenomena. For a long time

I studied and pleased myself with this inspiring scheme, which grew daily in 
my thoughts, until it took on almost the magnitude of a revelation. “The 
third day comes a frost, a killing frost!” For when I came to grapple with 
my task at close quarters, I found my little plan of campaign deranged, over- 
whelmed, demolished, by the undreamt-of superabundance, complexity, and 
unmanageableness of the material to be dealt with. The molten metal 
straightway overflowed all my molds, and I had some ado to make my es- 
cape to tell the tale of my discomfiture. 
The truth of the matter was, Shakespeare had exhibited human nature 
too well—too much like the reality. I had never before come so near being 
brought face to face with humanity. My psychology had only made me 
acquainted, as it were, with a doll’s family of human puppets and their lilli- 
putian belongings. Possibly the thing I attempted is still capable of ac- 
complishment, but not, I am confident, on the lines of our current psychology. 
And if we cannot thus cope with literature, how shall we attempt the expo- 
sition of that vast complex of which literature is only the mirror? 
It seems to me, that in order to keep pace with the other sciences, psychol- 
ogy must prove itself competent to answer, from its present position, in a 
more explicit and satisfactory manner than hitherto, the many practical 
questions in pedagogy that press for solution, or else it must fall back, and 
re-form its line upon the base of well-ascertained and undisputed facts of 
external observation, ranging over the widest fields. It must show more 
adaptability and greater capacity of growth. It must serve the teacher 
with a more fruitful and applicable body of knowledge. 
There is a further consideration which suggests itself at this point. Even 
supposing that introspection were competent to furnish a clue to the opera-~ 
tions of an adult mind, would that suffice to give us an equally clear view 
of the mental states of children? Are there no important differences, bodily 
and mental, between childhood and maturity? Medical writers have long 
recognized the diseases of children as differing so distinctly in character and 
mode of treatment from those of grown people as to require separate trea- 
tises for their exposition. Is it likely that such differences are characteristic 
of disease, and not equally characteristic of health? Dr. Eustace Smith, an 
accepted English authority in this department, remarks significantly : “Chil- 
dren are not merely little men and women, in whose bodies disease manifests 
itself by exactly the same tokens that are familiar to us in the case of the 
adult. They have special constitutional peculiarities, which give to disease 
in early life a character it does not afterwards retain, and invest the com- 
monest forms of illness with strange features, which may be a source of ob- 
scurity and confusion.” (Disease in Children, 1884, pp. 1, 2.) 
Probably most teachers and parents would be ready to agree that the “ob- 
scurity and confusion” are not confined to the diseases of children. But 
where do we find any adequate psychology of childhood? And where are 
we to look for the materials for such a psychology but to childhood itself,

which has been studied, until quite recently, so far as it may be said to have 
been studied at all, chiefly through adult introspection? 
-It is difficult to see how a grown person can do anything but waste time 
and delude himself in the attempt to learn by introspection the true condi- 
tion of a child’s mind. In what quarter of his inner consciousness should a 
man look to find any feeling that would enable him to appreciate a little 
girl’s passionate fondness for dolls? Or, where, in herself, would a woman 
discover the source of a boy’s love of playing Indian? And even if the 
man and woman were to change places in such a quest it would be much the 
same, for it is difference of age, not of sex, that bars out sympathy between 
children and grown people. Consider a little further this play-instinct in 
children, which fills three-fourths of their life: what do we find in ourselyes 
with which to measure its enormous force and urgency? Take, again, the 
childish trait of timidity or bashfulness: have we any present conscious- 
ness that prepares us to realize even a tenth part of the irresistible sway it 
holds with nearly all children? 
There are many signs that a profound change of method is about to take 
place in this matter. It has indeed already gained considerable headway. 
Monographs are appearing in many quarters, based upon facts of observa- 
tion. Darwin, Perez, Taine, Hall, Holden, and many others less widely 
known, have already published notable contributions; and the pioneer work 
of Professor Preyer, before mentioned, now accessible to all English students 
in the excellent translation of Mr. Brown, not only enriches pedagogical lit- 
erature as by a great legacy, but furnishes a type and specimen of method 
which will serve as a guide and stimulus to further investigation in the same 
field. 
A recent work by Dr. George J. Romanes, (vol. X LI of the International 
Scientific Series,) entitled “Animal Intelligence,” seems to me to suggest 
something of the sort of treatment that is needed, and is possible, in dealing 
with the psychology of childhood. Dr. Romanes has, with immense labor, 
collected a vast store of well-authenticated observations or anecdotes con- 
cerning the intelligence displayed by the lower animals. He has arranged 
these with scientific accuracy in a progressive series, beginning even as low 
in the scale as the protozoa, and ascending through all the intermediate 
grades to the monkeys, which stand at the top of the long ladder; thus, as 
he says, “passing the animal kingdom in review in order to give a trust- 
worthy account of the grade of psychological development which is pre- 
sented by each group.” The work is admirably done, and the result is not 
only a very entertaining story-book of animals, well-sifted and reliable as to 
facts, but a most interesting and suggestive treatise on comparative psychol- 
ogy, which all teachers would do well to read. 
And the question arises, as just hinted, why such a method, so purely ob- 
jective and inductive, and hence so comprehensible and interesting, might 
not be applied, with the necessary modifications, to the systematic study of  
-P-A-G-E-283

children, on an extensive scale? Preyer has given a noble lead and inspir- 
ation for such an undertaking; but, as he himself says, it “requires the 
combined labor of many;” and herein lies, in great part, its promise and 
its attractiveness. Tlie teachers of a city or a State might combine, like a 
vast colony of bees, to help build up the structure we so much need. 
Under the stimulus of these considerations, at the suggestion of Dr. Stan- 
ley Hall, (but for whose generous encouragement and aid the work would 
not have been undertaken,) there has been made, in the normal school with 
which I have the honor to be connected, a small and tentative beginning 
in this direction, a brief account of which may perhaps be acceptable to such 
as are in agreement with the views set forth in this paper. 
The end in view has been twofold; and in order to understand and judge 
of the character of the work, this twofold aim must be borne in mind. 
First, and chiefly, to give such exercise in the observation of children as 
is calculated to bring the observer into close and sympathetic relations with 
them, to awaken and cultivate in those who are to become teachers a rev- 
erent interest in all the realities and mysteries of childhood. 
Secondly, and incidentally, to accumulate a body of well-ascertained facts 
that may serve in future to enlarge and rectify our knowledge of children, 
and so help to lay the foundations of a more adequate and pedagogically 
useful psychology of childhood. 
The method is very simple, being substantially as follows: 
‘Soon after entering the school, students are made acquainted with this 
feature of our work, and very little effort is required to give them a new in- 
‘terest in children and their ways, partly, no doubt, from the novelty of the 
thing, but more because the new-comers quickly perceive in the school the 
presence of such an interest. They very soon feel the growing enthusiasm 
which objective study is so apt to enkindle in youthful minds, and some of 
them show almost immediately the right apprehension of what is wanted, 
and the sure tact that will lead to success. Others, of course, lack this, and 
never make first-rate observers. 
The first real task is to correct the prevailing notion, that what is desired 
is the striking or remarkable sayings and doings of precocious children. It 
is difficult for beginners to understand that only what is common or habitual 
in ordinary children is of value. They can hardly believe at first that 
* newspaper paragraphs about children are generally false, and that, even if 
true, they would be of little use. A second point for beginners is, to refrain 
from all reflections and comments of their own; to report precisely what 
they observe—no more and no less—with the accuracy of a photograph. 
A third precaution has to be much insisted on—that of never allowing the 
child under observation to know or suspect that he is being observed. An- 
other important thing is, to record the observation at the earliest convenient 
moment. 
There is a question how far the beginner should be directed to look for
-P-A-G-E-284

certain specific things in children. I think our experience points towards 
a general readiness and openness of mind as the most favorable condition. 
Children are pretty wild game, and must be watched from cover, and ap- 
proached indirectly. Moreover, their activities go in waves, and with little 
regularity, so that an observer will generally do best in a waiting and ex- 
pectant attitude—wwhat sportsmen call “a still hunt.” “The best time to 
catch fish is when they bite” is a homely proverb that applies here. This 
will answer the question sometimes asked, why our students do not go about 
this work with more regularity and system? Such a question is natural, but 
it assumes that a student might almost hold his manual of psychology in one 
hand and a child in the other, and verify the teaching of the book, item by 
item. It needs but little experience to show that such a method would work 
about as well with a child as it would with a beaver or a loon. It is quite 
possible, however, that a more determinate course than we have pursued 
would be better. 
The pupils are told in a general way in what realms or fields most of their 
observations will lie: as, for example, the knowledge and ignorance dis- 
played by children, their language and gestures, curiosity, shyness, vanity, 
lying, etc.; their likes and dislikes, attachments, aversions, fancies, caprices; 
their favorite stories, songs and myths, whatever makes them laugh or ery, 
ideas of the sky, of God, of death, etc.; their abilities, as shown in drawing, 
building, planning, and the like; and above all, their plays and games, social 
and solitary. No limit is put to the scope of these observations, and no 
question is raised as to their possible utility. 
The next matter is blanks for making the records. These are ordinary 
half-sheets of note paper, of several different tints, with printed headings 
covering the following items: The date; the observer’s name, age, and post- 
office address; the name (or initials) of the child observed, its sex, nation- 
ality, and age in years and months; and the length of time between making 
the observation and recording it. White paper is used for such observa- 
tions as students make themselves; pink for well-attested ones reported by 
others; yellow for reminiscences of their own childhood; green for mention 
of whatever they read on the subject; and chocolate for observations that 
extend continuously over a specified period of time. These tints help in 
classifying the reports, and they also require the student to reflect upon the 
precise character of the record he is about to make. The number of records 
expected from each pupil is purposely left indefinite; it has been found to 
average not far from two a week for the whole course of two years and a 
half. 
The work of making these observations is not at all compulsory, but 
nearly every pupil engages in it from genuine interest; it is indeed the most 
nearly self-sustaining exercise in the school. A distinct gain in skill is 
noticed in a majority of students from term to term, and during the latter 
part of a term the proportion of interesting and valuable papers is greater 
than during the first part.
-P-A-G-E-285
  PEDAGOGICAL INQUIRY. 285 
  
The records as handed in are read by a teacher, and classified, provision- 
ally, under such rubrics as knowledge, reflection, imagination, conscience, 
feeling, play, etc. Such as are of special interest or significance, whether 
for matter or form, are placed for a few days where they can be read by the 
pupils, and they never fail to attract eager readers. 
At times, some particular childish trait will come into prominence and be 
observed by many students simultaneously. Sometimes a question will come 
up as to whether such-or-such a thing is true of children generally; and 
there will be in response a great number of observations directed to that 
point. Occasionally a student will strike out in some new direction. For 
instance, one tried the effect of smiling pleasantly at every little child she 
passed in the street, and recorded the nature and number of responses she 
got. They were almost all smiles in return. The same person tried frown- 
ing in a similar way. During the past winter we have had an unusual 
number of observations relating to lying, and a good many with reference 
to vanity. The peculiar chants and cries of children, whether in play or in 
derision, have been reduced to musical notation. We have a large number 
of pictures spontaneously made by children; also a small collection of play- 
things similarly produced. 
The aggregate number of papers up to this time is a little over ten thou- 
sand, of which I suppose it is safe to say at least one-fifth possess some per- 
manent pedagogic value. Our students, in writing their graduation theses, 
find it indispensable to refer to these records whenever their subjects involve 
the facts of child-life. 
No psychologic exposition of these papers has yet been made; but I have 
assurance that one of the most competent psychologists is ready to direct 
the work whenever it is thought best to undertake it. So high, however, is 
my own estimate of the value to our pupils of the practice of making and 
recording these observations, that, were the whole collection destroyed at 
this moment, I should still regard the time spent in producing them as most 
wisely and profitably bestowed. The testimony of graduates, after experi- 
ence in teaching, is to the effect that no feature of their preparatory train- 
ing is found to be more directly beneficial in their every-day work, especially 
in dealing with exceptional children, than the practice that has been de- 
scribed. 
The experiment, short and simple and slight as it has been, has forced 
upon my mind the conviction that if similar work could be carried on more 
generally, especially in all schools for the training of teachers, (not, I re- 
peat, as displacing the systematic study of psychology as at present pursued, 
but as supplementing and enlarging it and giving it a more practical turn,) 
the advantage to students would be great in many ways, and the material 
thus gathered for a better psychology of childhood would, before many 
years, attain a volume and richness at present well-nigh inconceivable.

SOUND-BLINDNESS. 
SARA E. WILTSE, CORUNNA, MICHIGAN. 
  
This paper is presented with the assumption that the title was intended to 
embrace all disorders of the ear popularly known as Sound-Blindness, though 
not so classed by specialists. Actual deafness to certain tones is probably 
never congenital, as is blindness to certain colors, exception being made of 
eases of children who have no perception of musical sequence and of tone- 
value, who never appreciate and cannot reproduce a melody, and if such 
cases exist they are not on record. 
Weare perfectly familiar with the fact that a child learns to speak by slow 
and laborious processes; that he so learns to see and hear is not so well rec- 
ognized by people in general. 
On reading to an intelligent and well-educated mother of six children that 
all babies are born deaf, I was met with an indignant denial of the fact, and 
on presenting the reasons for such protection for the delicate mechanism of 
the ear from the shock of air pressure, to say nothing of harsh voices, the 
mother admitted that the reasons were good, but she did not believe she had 
lived to be a grandmother without discovering such a fact, if it existed. On 
telling an intelligent audience recently that Preyer’s child was noticeably 
affected by a rose-colored curtain on the twenty-third day after its birth, the 
lifted eyebrows and indrawn breath gave such evidences of strong dissent 
that I paused to ask if it was discredited, and several mothers thought that 
Preyer must be mistaken, while others admitted that the spirits of very 
young children had been unmistakably affected by bright ribbons and dress- 
ing-sacques worn by them. From observation we have learned that hearing 
develops more slowly than sight, the eye being sensitive to light five minutes 
after birth, it being hours and even days before the normal child hears. We 
know that the infant slowly learns to direct its gaze, and from experiments 
made by myself I know there is wide variation among children, of ability to 
locate sounds, and the variation among grown people may be noted in your 
walks in the country by attempts to locate a singing bird, some persons be- 
ing able to point to the bird at once and others looking from tree to tree. 
Surprising results of a différent nature may be obtained in a small party 
whose voices are familiar to each other by blindfolding one of the company 
and requiring him to name the others from listening to individual voices in 
some popular air. 
That there were such defects of sight as color-blindness and myopy, the 
public has been slow to recognize; and that Dr. Jeffries met with stubborn 
resistance even from teachers when he began his investigations, gives no 
cause for shame and regret. It would seem that from analogy alone, we 
should have suspected long ago that there were defects of hearing that do
-P-A-G-E-287

not amount to actual deafness. We can recall such expressions, even in 
the school-room, as, “ You must hear with your elbows!” “You’d better take 
the wool out of your ears!” “Where are your ears?” and like cruel re- 
marks, arising, no doubt, from the conviction that inability to hear comes 
through inattention—a position taken somewhat aggressively by a few to 
whom the theory of tone-deafness is new, although well recognized by the 
Germans as tontaubheit; but ordinary impairment of hearing may exist 
where tontaubheit does not. d 
In my father’s household there was once a young maid-servant who rather 
piqued herself on a peculiarly bad memory. On hearing me read, one day, 
that boiled onions were good ‘for the mucous membrane, “Good for remem- 
brin’!” exclaimed the maid; “then I’ll eat onions the rest of my life!” In 
such blurred way this girl hears much which is said to her; and her afflic- 
tion is undoubtedly more in dulled sound-perception, with its serious conse- 
quences, than in defective memory. 
In March, 1888, I received a clipping from Science on “Sound-Blindness,” 
with a marginal note from Dr. G. Stanley Hall asking if I could look into 
the subject. Permission to enter the public schools for the purpose was 
granted by the Boston school board, and, standing on the teacher’s plat- 
form, the following words were pronounced, after testing the pitch and 
loudness of voice by a few words addressed to the master, who stood at the 
opposite side of the room: Ultramarine, altruistic, frustrate, ultimatum, 
ululate, Alcibiades, and unaugmented, were the first words used. Time was 
given between. the pronunciation of each for the slowest pupil to write it 
upon a slip of paper, words being repeated as often as required, some of 
them haying been clearly pronounced five successive times. In the Latin 
school 259 boys, whose ages range from 12 to 20 years, were given this test, 
84 of whom made corresponding .mistakes in the vowel sounds, their papers 
showing, ¢. g.: altramarine, ultruistic, frostrate, altimatum, elulate, olulate, 
alulate, and unolmented. Alcibiades suffered least, his character happen- 
ing to be just then under discussion in the school—a fact of which I was, 
of course, ignorant. At this stage of the investigation Dr. Clarence Blake, 
the distinguished aurist of Boston, was consulted, and he gave a much bet- 
ter list of test-words, viz.: fan, log, long, pen, dog, pod, land, few, and cat. 
The 84 pupils who confused the vowel sounds in the polysyllables were 
seated in their various rooms in the front row, while the observer stood at 
the back of the room, pronouncing these monosyllables but once, the pupils 
having had notice of this arrangement, that they might give instant atten- 
tion. Only 4 of the 84 spelled all these monosyllables correctly; and when it 
is remembered that these were pupils in the Latin school, it seems to me to 
be a very grave matter, for the misspelling came from misunderstanding of 
the words, and the misunderstanding could not be attributed to inattention, 
as every boy was on the alert, having been told that it was a test of hearing 
to which they were being subjected by order of the school board. A final

  _ and individual test was now given with an aurist’s tuning-fork —C 562, v. s- 
The fork was struck with a rubber-covered hammer, the pupil standing 
twelve feet away, with his back toward the observer. Two cases of deaf- 
ness were found, but these were known to the teachers, though not to the 
master. Several doubtful cases were found, which were given the benefit 
of the doubt, it not being practicable to refer them to a specialist, and the 
day these cases were noticed happened to be so damp that the instrument 
gave uncertain sounds. 
In the English high school of Boston, 223 boys between the ages of 13 
and 18 were tested with the polysyllables, 105 of whom made mistakes cor- 
responding to those already noted. Of the 105, 92 misspelled from one to 
four of the monosyllables, the errors being in general a repetition of those 
made in the Latin school, in which pupils are received prior to graduation 
from grammar school, while all English high-school pupils are graduates 
from the various grammar departments of the city. 
In the Comins grammar school, 530 pupils between the ages of 8 and 14 
were tested with the monosyllables, only 34 of whom spelled all the words 
correctly. The opportunities here gave fairer results, the same room being 
used for every test, and the words given to classes of 16 only, there being 
no other pupils in the room and no outside distractions. With the tuning- 
fork first used there were unavoidable variations in the weight of the stroke, 
dependent upon the mental and physical conditions of the observer, and 
Dr. Blake kindly furnished another, to be differently manipulated. Five 
children were found who could not hear this tone twelve feet away, and in 
neither case had the teacher or master suspected the existence of any dis- 
order of the ear; two of these were among the brightest in the room, and 
were seated farthest from their teachers; the others were supposed to be 
dull and inattentive. After the discovery of deafness, these pupils were 
particularly observed by their teachers, and the bright ones were found to 
have the habit of closely watching the face of anyone speaking, bending to 
the right or left during dictation exercises in order not to lose sight of the 
lips. For the single word pod, 51 different words were given, 64 blanks in- 
dicating that number of failures to understand the word at all; 85 children 
understood the word to be hog, while 25 understood it to be hard. 
As a matter of course, these tests lack somewhat in mathematical accu- 
racy, but great pains was taken, and much private practice made the pro- 
nunciation as nearly exact and even as it would be likely to be under any 
circumstances. The work was experimental, the path unbroken; better 
methods will undoubtedly be devised, and more surprising results obtained. 
One circumstance is not without suggestiveness. A child seven years old, 
with abnormal development, was pronounced feeble-minded by the examin- 
ing physicians, but was retained in the kindergarten, where it received 
especial attention, and made marked improvement. Dr. Blake kindly ex- 
amined the child and found that early trouble with the middle ear had
-P-A-G-E-289
SOUND-BLINDNESS. 289 
occasioned a period of deafness which had arrested mental development. 
Sending the child to the school for deaf mutes to learn the use of his vocal 
organs, the ear meanwhile to receive such treatment as the disorder indi- 
cated, was advised instead of admission to the school for feeble-minded 
children. 
We see by these tests that one pupil in each hundred in the Comins 
grammar school has some disorder of the ear: to know if each suffers from 
the same weakness would involve individual examinations by a specialist — 
examinations Dr. Blake generously offered to make, but I was unable at 
the time to carry the work further. 2 
One is immediately struck by the difference between results of final tests 
in the high and grammar schools. Is it not likely that the pupils who work 
under the disadvantage of such a disorder seldom get beyond the grammar 
grade? What the per cent. of cases would be in the primary grade is a 
matter of conjecture, but I have no doubt it would be much larger than in 
the grammar school, since many children attend school less than the time 
required by law, cash-boys and office-boys being drawn from the grammar- 
school ranks. It would be interesting to trace the possible relation between 
truancy and lack of interest in school-work because of dullness of the ear. 
The tests already made prove conclusively the existence of an obstacle to 
the acquirement of information on the part of pupils which has never been 
sufficiently recognized as existent, and the causes of which should be made 
the subject of special examination. 
Dr. Blake gives three classes of tone-deafness proper which have come 
under his observation—and his study of the subject is perhaps as close as 
that of any aurist in America. I quote directly from him: 
1. Deafness for a series of consecutive tones in some portion of the scale, 
more commonly the upper, which may be the result of disease of the middle 
ear. 
2. Deafness for single tones scattered throughout the scale, more fre- 
quently the result of disease of the labyrinth. 
8. A lack of appreciation of harmonic sequence, and, in some cases, an 
impossibility to distinguish the relative pitch of two or more tones—not 
acquired, but congenital. 
The aurist so frequently quoted in this paper says that tone-deafness is 
not a disease, but is a possible symptom of several diseases of the ear, some 
of which are curable, and some not, and he suggests amblyosia as a descrip- 
tive name of the symptom of diseased or dim hearing for the discovery of 
which these particular tests were made. 
Agassiz wrote: “A physical fact is as sacred as a moral principle.” In 
this matter we have to deal with a physical fact of the gravest importance 
—one which may be vitally related to moral principles. Every child in 
our public schools should have the hearing tested at longer or shorter inter- 
vals, and the dull and inattentive, ever-behindhand pupil should have the

benefit of such light as a test of this kind might cast upon the causes of in- 
attention, dullness, and mischievousness. 
It is to be feared that general interest will not be roused in the matter, 
unless such educational leaders as are here represented will stand, like the 
immortal Swiss Guard, not only between the children and the physical de- 
fects that threaten to arrest mental development, but between the children 
and the parents and teachers who are not yet convinced that there is any 
hindrance to any attainment but inherent depravity and love of idleness.

  HONORARY DEGREES. 291 
  
HONORARY DEGREES, AS CONFERRED IN AMERICAN 
COLLEGES. 
CHARLES FOSTER SMITH, NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE. 
Twenty-two years ago President D.C. Gilman called attention in the Nation 
(August 1, 1867) to some of the evils connected with the wholesale bestowal 
of honorary doctorates in law and theology, asserting that “the mode in 
which honorary degrees are conferred in this country is a sham and a shame.” 
“Tt is so easy to get a degree,” he charges, “so many men of slight acquisi- 
tions have obtained degrees, that it is now the way to apply for these honors; 
and if the secret sessions of college corporations were made public, there 
would be an astounding revelation of intimations and open requests and in- 
dorsements. Members of the faculties of colleges are constantly applied to 
to lend their influence to secure a doctorate for this person or that. By de- 
signed coincidences, letters are sometimes received from distant points and 
from very different writers, calling attention to the peculiar merits of this or 
that candidate, and recommending him to favorable consideration.” 
Ex-President Woolsey, also, in an article on “Academic Degrees,” pub- 
lished in the Century, July, 1884, says: “If there are excrescences in the 
system, such as seem to be hurtful to the advance of real study, every edu- 
cated man ought to desire that they should disappear. Such we hold to be 
honorary degrees, especially doctorates in law and in theology; and we be- 
lieve them to be so little in accord with solid learning that we could wish 
them to be suppressed, or, if that is impossible, checked and regulated.” * 
“The desire to obtain the honor is a desire which no man should indulge,” 
says he further, “and yet the uncertainty and unreasonableness of the rules 
of selection provoke such a desire, especially in persons who have no good 
claims by which it can be justified.” 
My own experience confirms for the South the truth of the charges made 
by these distinguished college men against the American mode of conferring 
honorary degrees. Before the first commencement after I became a mem- 
ber of the faculty of a college in South Carolina, a request was received 
from certain gentlemen of a distant State asking that the degree of D.D. 
be conferred on Rev. , of that State. In addition to the high quali- 
fications claimed for the reverend gentleman, it was stated that he had 
written a book, and it was thought that the degree would aid him in getting 
a publisher and help the sale of the book. Not a member of the faculty 
knew the candidate or any of his friends, and they promptly declined to 
recommend the bestowal of the degree. Another request that I remember 
was signed by two or three very well-known clergymen asking that a doc-

torate in theology be granted a preacher from a distant State, who was prac- 
tically unknown to every member of the faculty, the only ground for the 
request, so far as known, being the fact that the nominee had been elected 
to some important church office. I was told that such requests had been 
not infrequent in the history of the institution. But suppose the college 
had been weak enough to yield, what would have been the effect? The 
uninitiated would of course have taken the fact that the degree came from 
a distant college as proof of the extensive reputation of the new doctor. 
A young preacher of promise, considerably under thirty years of age, told 
me some time ago that being one day at Dr. B.’s, that gentleman said to 
him, “I am writing to College to ask that the degree of D. D. be 
conferred on Mr. A.;” and added, “if you would like the degree, I’ll offer 
your name, too.” The young man declined; but Mr. A. got the degree. I 
happen to know that Mr. A’s name was sent at the same time to another 
college, which declined to grant him the honor, and thus deprived him of 
the great glory of being doubly dubbed. I believe that the above is not an 
uncommon way of securing honorary degrees, especially that of D. D. 
The ablest preachers generally get the degree, but so many others receive 
the same honor that its value is greatly impaired. President Woolsey’s re- 
mark that “They carry with them no evidence of learning, but only a certain 
indefinite superiority above others in the same sacred calling,” is eminently 
true. One of the ablest men whom Tennessee has produced used to say: 
“Some men are doctored for their learning, some for general ability; but I 
was doctored on the demand of the people.” I venture to say that seldom 
does a college take the trouble to ascertain what qualifications in the way of 
erudition or literary ability the candidate may have. Prominence, general 
reputation, preaching ability, success as an evangelist, determine the bestowal 
‘so far as the recipient is concerned; various motives of policy often influence 
the college. A striking example in proof is at hand. One of the strongest 
literary institutions in the South has lately conferred D. D. on a man who, 
if he had continued his college course, would at the time he received his 
doctorate have just finished his junior year in Vanderbilt University. The 
causa honoris in this case was a successful pastorate in the college town. 
It not uncommonly happens that the preachers, the newspapers, the people, 
doctor a man before the colleges are called in. A city could easily be men- 
tioned where a preacher of any prominence is seldom introduced to an audi- 
ence, or mentioned in the papers, except as “doctor,” and this without any 
regard for the facts in the case. It was observed at the General Conference 
of the Methodist Church, held in Nashville, in 1882, that on some occasions 
the presiding bishop recognized every preacher who rose to speak as “ Doc- 
tor , from .” And at the meeting of the same body in Rich- 
mond, 1886, it is said, the committee on public worship, announcing the 
appointments for the various pulpits the following Sunday, read every ap- 
pointee as “doctor,” until the matter became so ridiculous that the confer-

ence burst into laughter. It is not to be supposed that anybody was in 
doubt as to anybody’s title. It simply is, or is getting to be, the custom. 
The evil we complain of, like so many others in educational matters, has 
come from the over-multiplication of small colleges; and the absurdity to 
which honorary degree-giving has been carried in some of the weaker back- 
woods or “one-horse” colleges is almost beyond belief. The story that went 
the rounds of the papers, a year or two back, about the Texas university 
whose faculty consisted of a father and two sons, the latter of whom conferred 
the degree of LL.D. on the old gentleman, receiving in return each a doc- 
torate of philosophy from the grateful sire, created not a little amusement, 
and was doubtless considered only a huge joke. 
But if the Texas story was considered too funny to be true, what will be 
thought of this which comes from Arkansas and is vouched for by a preacher: 
‘f Springs” had got on a boom, like most other Southern towns 
and springs, and the public-spirited citizens determined that they needed, 
not, as the General Court of Massachusetts in 1647, a school, but in con- 
formity with the era of booms, a college. They were persuaded to this action 
by a sewing-machine agent, who proposed to be president of the institution. 
One load of lumber was brought and thrown down upon the lot selected for 
the college, and on this the board of trustees took their seats and held their 
first session. The only business transacted was the election of the sewing- 
machine agent to the degree of D. D., after which they adjourned —to meet 
no more, for the man with the needle left with his degree, and the college 
was abandoned. 
There are competent witnesses still living who could testify in the case of 
the man who in consideration of a donation of $10,000 to a certain college, 
now happily defunct, was to receive a doctorate in theology. The college 
performed its part, but the donation was not made. If that gentleman had 
only known of the institution which is said to have conferred D.D. on the 
generous donor of a Webster’s Unabridged Dictionary, he might have gone 
down to the grave with the coveted title, and a better name for honesty in 
keeping his contracts. : 
In Tennessee, two at least, within my knowledge, of the so-called “female 
colleges” have conferred honorary doctorates of law or divinity. One of 
these cases happened on this wise: The “female college” was about to die 
of inanition, and the president, calling the board of trustees together for 
the last time, got them to confer the degree of LL.D. upon ee and two 
others, one’a popular preacher. 
A very good remark about honorary doctorates of this character is cred- 
ited to the Rev. Sam Jones. Meeting one day two D. D.’s of recent brand, 
he said: “So, brethren, you are D. D.’s now? Well, that thing is coming 
to me some of these days. I feel it in my bones. Not that Iam going up 
to it; but when I see such men as you getting it, I know it is coming down, 
and it will get to me after awhile.”

Most colleges in the South and West; if not in the East, receive doubtless 
many curious and even amusing applications for the conditions of examina- 
tion for doctor degrees. The most ambitious applicant that ever came under 
my personal observation was the author of the following letter, which the 
secretary of a leading Southwestern college allowed me to copy three years 
ago: 
“Dear Sir: I wish to know what will be required of me to obtain the degree of 
D.C.L. of University. I took of College, in 1880, A. B.; 1881, A. M.; in 
1884, Doctor of Philology. I have been admitted to the Supreme Court of 7 
and have practiced law in almost two years. I have read everything pre- 
scribed in the law course of Albany, Ann Arbor, Vanderbilt, Yale, Harvard, Missouri. 
University, and Hastings Law College, for LL.B., and outside. I am exceedingly 
anxious to obtain D.C.L. As I have three degrees from Alma Mater, I should like 
the other to come across the Rockies. Pardon my ambition. Related maternally to 
the well-known Patrick Henry and paternally to J. C. Calhoun, I am doubly fired. 
Could I take your requirements without actual attendance? I will stand an exami- 
nation forwarded by you to any member of College, or to any gentleman in 
If actual attendance is required, could I be favored with a tutorship in 
languages, rhetoric, literature, elocution, or history, whilst taking the course? I 
should hate to give up my law practice and go East, unless I could recompense with 
a tutorship partially. Young men in the West need to stick to their territory. We 
will discuss that after hearing from you on the course. Let me hear from you im- 
mediately.”   
  
  
  
  
  
In order to ascertain as nearly as possible what are the exact facts with 
‘regard to the bestowal of honorary degrees in the United States, I have 
made a laborious and careful study of the reports of the Commissioner of 
Education for the fourteen years (1872-1885) for which we have informa- 
tion on the subject of honorary degrees The following is the result :*

It will be observed that, though there is some fluctuation, the number of 
honorary degrees conferred, especially doctorates of divinity and philoso- 
phy, is on the whole, growing. An important question in the matter of 
increase is this: Does the number of colleges conferring honorary doctorates 
increase in proportion to the number of degrees bestowed? This is answered 
by the table on the following page. 
  
* For convenience, I class all doctorates of law and letters under LL, D., and all doctorates of the- 
ology under D,D. Prof. John Williams White suggested, in his speech before the Scientific Associa- 
tion, August, 1881, that the favor into which S.T. D. had recently been growing in this country indicates, 
perhaps, “an attempt on the part of the clergymen to escape the odium attaching to the D. D.” 
+There may be, here and there, a slight error in the count, but it has been made with great care, 
and may be depended on as substantially correct.

    It will thus be seen that the AES of colleges conferring honorary de- 
grees a little more than keeps pace with the number of colleges reported 
each year. The whole number of separate colleges that conferred honorary 
doctorates between 1872 and 1885 was 250, distributed over thirty-six States, 
two Territories, and the District of Columbia. Ohio heads the list, by right, 
as having more colleges and universities than any other State, with twenty- 
four, followed by Pennsylvania with twenty-three, Illinois with eighteen, 
Tennessee and New York with seventeen each, Iowa with twelve, Indiana 
eleven, the remainder from eight to one. 
In the six New England States were conferred from 1872 to 1885 D.D. 
264, LL.D. 272; in the four Middle States, D. D.570, LL. D. 262; in thir- 
teen Southern States (including Missouri and West Virginia), D.D. 656, 
LL.D. 348; in twelve Western States and two Territories, D. D.757, LL. D. 
278; in the District of Columbia, D. D. 12, LL.D. 31. It will be observed 
that in New England the two degrees are conferred in nearly equal num- 
bers, while in the Middle and Southern States about twice as many D.D.’s 
are bestowed as LL. D.’s, and in the Western States the proportion is nearly 
three to one. 
With regard to Ph.D. as an honorary degree, President Woolsey has this 
to say in his excellent article: “The degree of Ph.D., which in Germany 
is what M.A. has been in England and the United States, has been for a 
few years used among us as a degree conferred, on examination, upon students 
in science. There certainly can be no objection to this novelty, if the ex- 
amination is severe and thorough. But some colleges, chiefly, if not entirely, 
seated in the Western States, went beyond this, and gave the degree to some 
who, without an examination for it, had gained some distinction in physical 
science. It was according to logic and analogy so to do; but a convention 
of scientific men, more than a year since, protested against the extension of 
the field of honors, and their protest has been received, we judge, with no 
dissatisfaction by the country.” 
If I understand President Woolsey aright, his statement is a little mis- 
leading. The resolution adopted by the American Philological Association, 
at the meeting held in Cleveland, Ohio, July, 1881, and concurred in by the 
American Association for the Advancement of Science, at its next meeting, 
held in Cincinnati, August, 1881, was as follows: 
“Whereas, Many colleges in the United States have, in recent years, conferred the 
degree of Doctor of Philosophy, not by examination, but honoris causa: be it 
Resolved, first, That this Association deprecates the removal of this degree from 
 
-P-A-G-E-296
  296 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
the class to which it belongs, (namely, B.D., LL.B., M.D. and Ph.D., degrees con- 
ferred after examination,) and its transfer to the class of honorary degrees.” 
My impression is, that in most cases where Ph. D. has been conferred it 
has been given as a sort of lower LL. D., and just as LL. D. would be given, 
«with or without regard to attainments in physical science. In every instance 
that has come within my own knowledge this has been the case. 
In one other point, too, President Woolsey is wrong. Many persons, 
doubtless, have supposed, as he did, that the colleges thus conferring Ph. D. 
as an honorary degree were “chiefly if not entirely seated in the Western 
States.” But the report of the Commissioner of Education tells a different 
tale. From 1872 to 1885 inclusive, 358 honorary doctorates of philosophy 
were conferred in the United States, and 156 of these were given in New 
York, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and New Jersey, while only 107 were given 
in ten Western States. New England has a better record in this respect 
than the three Middle States, but 44 honorary doctorates of philosophy 
were conferred in New England colleges, Dartmouth leading with 20; 
Williams, University of Vermont, and Amherst, 5 each; Bowdoin and_ 
Lewis College, 3 each; Colby, Bates, and Maine Agricultural and Me- 
chanical College, 1 each. In 12 Southern States 44 such doctorates were 
conferred, and 6 in the District of Columbia. All will readily agree with 
President Woolsey in his objection to the custom which has come into vogue 
of making the degree honorary; it is simply that he is wrong as to geo- 
graphical distribution. 
It is a pity that the custom has not been confined to small colleges, for 
then it might easily be rendered ridiculous, and so checked; but when such 
a protest as that of the Philological and Scientific Associations is unheeded 
by institutions like Princeton, Amherst, Michigan University, Lafayette, 
Dartmouth, Hamilton, Madison, Union, Dickinson, Western Reserve, Uni- 
versity of Wisconsin, University of North Carolina, De Pauw, University of 
‘the City of New York—all of which conferred Ph. D. as an honorary degree 
the year after the protest or later—it cannot be hoped that the weaker in- 
stitutions, West, South, or East, will seriously heed the protests of scholars. 
Perhaps nothing shows more clearly how serious is the evil connected 
with the bestowal of honorary degrees, complained of by Presidents Wool- 
sey and Gilman, as the growth of the custom of conferring Ph. D. as an 
honorary doctorate. The value of the degree, which in Germany is the 
reward purely of scholarship as proved by examination and other tests, 
was speedily impaired when colleges big and little all over the land began 
to confer it as a sort of inferior LL.D. A table will easily show the spread 
of this as an honorary degree:

  HONORARY DEGREES. 297 
  
It will be seen that the protest of the philological and scientific associa- 
tions had seemingly some temporary effect, inasmuch as there was a drop 
down from 29 colleges conferring 49 honorary doctorates of philosophy in 
1881, to 17 colleges with 30 such degrees in 1882; but the very next year 
the number of colleges so bestowing the degree had again risen to 25 and 
the degrees to 36. 
The worst feature of the matter, however, is not the increase in the num- 
ber of honorary doctorates of philosophy, but in the advance in the number 
of colleges, especially small colleges—Western, Middle, and Southern — 
so conferring the degree. For we find that whereas only seven colleges from 
five States so conferred the degree in 1872, up to 1885 111 colleges from 
32 States had so bestowed it. These included all the Middle States, four 
New England, ten Western, thirteen Southern, and the District of Columbia. 
In other words, the custom has spread over the whole country. A hasty 
glance at the list of 111 colleges that have conferred honorary Ph. D.’s will 
show that while a number of leading colleges—some of which were men- 
tioned above —have set the bad example, it has been followed principally 
by the smaller and weaker colleges of the Middle, Western, and Southern 
States.* 
With regard to A.M., the custom was formerly well-nigh universal in 
American colleges of conferring this second degree three years after gradu- 
ation on those of their graduates who were engaged in a literary calling, or 
had prosecuted further studies in any branch. The University of Virginia 
introduced the English custom of conferring A. M. on examination, just as 
A.B. Of late years most of the best colleges have adopted this plan; but 
very many, perhaps most, colleges that confer honorary degrees, though they 
may have ceased to give A. M. three years after graduation to any of their 
graduates who apply, still confer it as an honorary degree on their own 
graduates or others. In 1880—I looked no farther back —119 honorary 
A. M.’s were conferred; in 1881, 180; in 1882, 138; in 1883, 149; in 1884, 
178; in 1885, 140. In these six years, too, I find at least 25 colleges not 
reported as conferring honorary doctorates which conferred A. M., thus 
swelling the number to 275. Morever, as the term “in course” leaves it 
undetermined whether the degree is conferred on examination or three years 
after graduation on application, it is reasonable to infer that the number of 
actual honorary A. M.’s is very much greater still. 
One fact of promise for the future is that most of the recently founded, 
well-endowed and equipped colleges and universities do not confer honorary 
degrees. The University of Virginia in this, as in so many other respects, 
set a good example to other institutions, and has never since the opening in   
  
*As to individual colleges, the highest number of honorary doctorates of philosophy during the 
fourteen years belongs to Lafayette, namely, 24; next comes Princeton, 21; then Dartmouth, 20; the 
University of Wooster, 20; University of the City of New York, 15; Hamilton, 16; Washington and 
Jefferson, 13; Union, 11; Madison University and Pennsylvania College, 7 each; University of Michi- 
gan, 7; Western Reserve College, 6; the others, from 5 to 1. 
 
-P-A-G-E-298

1825 departed from the rule to confer no honorary degrees. She has had a 
goodly and eminently respectable, if not large, following in Boston Univer- 
sity, University of California, Vanderbilt,* Purdue, Tulane, University of 
Texas, and in three of the four best female colleges, namely, Smith, Wellesly, 
and Bryn Mawr. 
Honorary degrees properly bestowed and in reasonable number could not 
be detrimental. In the best educational systems of Europe they still obtain. 
But it is clear that the reductio ad absurdum is about accomplished in the 
United States. At least 365 universities and colleges have the right to con- 
fer honorary degrees, and within fourteen years 275 separate institutions are 
found to have exercised the right. And this makes no allowance for the 
colleges that confer degrees but do not report. These would swell the num- 
ber considerably. In 1872 the Commissioner of Education received reports 
from 298 colleges, and of these 83 conferred 235 honorary doctorates; thir- 
teen years later (1884) he received reports from 347 colleges, but this time 
139 colleges conferred 320 honorary doctorates. Can even so great a country 
as the United States produce learned men, great men, or even strong men, suffi- 
cient to keep the mills going? But are all these institutions really entitled — 
except by their charters—to confer honorary degrees? President Woolsey 
thinks, “Where, in a place of learning a certain branch of study is not 
taught, there ought to be no degrees given in it.” Applying this test, we 
find that only forty-eight colleges and universities were reported in 1884 as 
having theological departments, but a single glance at many of the names 
in the list shows that if the doctorates might, by being limited to these, be 
lessened in number, they would not be improved in quality. ! 
Several honorary degrees have recently been conferred by the great col- 
leges on women—and surely no one can find fault with this if the degrees 
are confined to such women —and this will help for a time to bring up the 
general average of quality among the doctors. But even this new supply 
can give only temporary relief. With 250 colleges giving honorary doctor- 
ates, the market is sure to be overstocked, and values to depreciate. 
Then, too, if the boards of trustees of two or three so-called “female col- 
leges” have conferred honorary doctorates, what is to hinder the practice 
from becoming general? What if the legion of these so-called “female 
colleges” all over the South and Southwest had taken to conferring honorary 
degrees, and had bestowed these honors after the manner in which most of 
them now grant their diplomas? Add the fact that at least two military 
academies and six agricultural colleges and industrial universities (which, 
President Woolsey supposes, “ would not think of conferring the degree with 
which we have to do’’) have conferred honorary doctorates. What is to hin- 
der others from doing likewise? Is it not, after all, a mercy that matters 
are not worse ?   
  
* Reserves the right to confer honorary degrees, but has exercised it only once, and then gave ample 
reasons for making an exception to its announced rule of conduct in favor of an eminent scholar.
-P-A-G-E-299
  THE PROBLEM OF THE HOUR. 299 
As to the remedy: I know no better cure for the evils herein detailed 
than the suggestion of President Gilman. He proposes: “First, the older 
and firmer colleges might refuse to give honorary degrees under any cir- 
cumstances. The smaller and younger colleges would be likely to follow 
the example. This would be the simplest and easiest mode of remedying 
the abuse. Or, secondly, doctorates in law or theology might be given, on 
examination, the candidate offering himself like the candidates for the bac- 
calaureate, openly and honorably, with a thesis or.treatise which should 
exhibit his attainments. This is the usage of some of the foreign universi- 
ties. Or, thirdly, a college might declare its purpose to advance its own 
graduates to honorary distinctions on certain recognized principles of pro- 
motion—the publication of some scholarly work, the accomplishment of 
some literary task, or the attainment of some high position. In every case 
the reasons for bestowing the degree should be openly avowed. Ifa man is 
made doctor of laws, the public have a right to know whether it means he 
has fought a battle, or is on the right side in politics, or is a donor to the 
extent of five thousand dollars and upwards.” 
THE PROBLEM OF THE HOUR. 
ALEXANDER HOGG, FORT WORTH, TEXAS. 
The perpetuity of self-government; the preservation of constitutional lib- 
erty; the complete success of this Republic as conceived and expressed by 
Mr. Jefferson in his immortal declaration—‘“ We hold these truths to be 
self-evident: that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their 
Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, 
and the pursuit of happiness; that to secure these rights, governments are 
instituted among men, deriving their just power from the consent of the 
governed”—was the first postulate in the solution of “the problem of this 
hour.” This declaration, this ~postulate, was the inspiration of: Mr. Jeffer- 
son. It needed another self-evident proposition, and Mr. Hamilton con- 
ceived and added the second step toward this solution in: “We, the people 
of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union, establish jus- 
tice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote 
the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our 
posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of 
America.” The fathers, the founders of our Republic, had studied the re- 
publics of Greece and Rome. The republic of Rome may be said to have 
extended from the banishment of the Tarquins to the battle of Actium—a 
period of over six hundred years; during which time, the historian tells us, 
the temple of Janus was shut but once. 
Domestic strife, civil discord, is the answer to the fall—the loss of su-

premacy of the ancient republics. They lacked coherency; there was a 
want of homogeneity. While it is true these had somewhat the same lan- 
guage—that is, the Latin was the language of Rome, and Greek that of 
Greece—yet there were innumerable dialects and really small nationalities 
in each. Our founders saw that our States, while entities, separate and dis- 
tinct, must be connected entities; each must be independent and dependent 
at the same time. The State is sovereign, but not in the sense of isolation. 
The States are not islands in the sea; they are drops of water in the ocean. 
“Quam fluctus diversi, quam mare conjuncti.” While neither Mr. Jef- 
ferson, the author of the Declaration, nor Washington, the Father of his 
Country, has left anywhere an illustration, an object-lesson, conveying his 
idea of our Union, I have had prepared and have here a chain by which I 
hope to illustrate better than I can possibly by words, my conception of our 
American Union, our sovereign States, our indissoluble nation. I assume 
that the Republic of Jefferson is a different republic from those of Greece 
and Rome, from those of modern Europe, from those of South America, 
very far different from our sister republic of Mexico.

This chain consists of forty-two links. See, some are long, and some are 
short. That long bright one, the twenty-eighth link, represents Texas. The 
number of links in the entire chain is forty-two, equaling the number of 
States in our Union to-day. You will observe as to the position of the 
chain —the shape: it is not the are of a circle—it is a queer-shaped curve. 
The mechanical engineer calls it the catenary, and the higher mathematics 
prove it to be the curve when reversed, turned up, the arch of greatest re- 
sistance or greatest strength. If you will notice, all our stone culverts, 
railroad bridges, arches, ete., are in this shape. 
But to the chain: it is a matter of indifference whether the links make 
the chain, or the chain makes the links; whether the States form the Union, 
or the Union forms the States. Ifa single link breaks, down goes the arch 
—down goes the government. Little Rhode Island plays just as important 
a part in the stability of this structure as Texas. “There is one glory of 
the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for 
R one star differeth from an- 
other star in glory.” 
There must be additionally 
a firm foundation—a solid 
basis. This arch must rest 
upon two abutments. The 
government has said, by con- 
stitutional enactment, that one of these abutments shall be “universal suf- 
 
-P-A-G-E-301
THE PROBLEM OF THE HOUR. 301 
frage.” Upon “the consent of the governed”? Then I demand that “the 
consent of the governed” shall be intelligent. That the other abutment 
shall be “universal education.” If the government is for the people—aye, 
if the people are the government—then the people must be educated; must 
be able to read the ballot they are casting. 
Said Mr. Jefferson: “If the press is free and every man able to read, all 
issafe.” Is the press free? Can every voter read his ballot? Said Wash- 
ington, in his first annual message: “Knowledge is in every country the 
surest basis of public happiness.” Note the expression, “public” happi- 
ness. I could fill pages with quotations from presidents, statesmen, and 
‘others in our own and in foreign countries upon the necessity of universal 
education. What are the facts? Says Mrs. Mary H. Hunt: “Of the 18,- 
000,000 children of school age, only 10,500,000 are enrolled in public or 
_ private schools; five-twelfths of the whole are growing up in absolute igno- 
rance of the English alphabet.” 
T shall not distribute these unfortunates by tabulating the percentage’ to 
each State, since the States having the greatest amount of illiteracy seem to 
become not the most mortified, but worse offended, at the recital of the facts, 
than alarmed on account of the increased, and still increasing, amount of 
illiteracy, both in the adults as well as in the children. 
What sensitive mortals we are! We prefer to sleep upon a smouldering 
volcano—to exist, not to live—surrounded by a surging sea of vice, igno- 
rance and discontentment, only if we can herd, control the blind following 
of the people, than to have intelligent, educated, thinking voters. 
I therefore shall say nothing of the geographical situation: the locality 
where the 93,279 white and the 94,392 colored voters who could not read 
the ballots made out for them dwelt. (See census, decade 1870-1880.) Nor 
in what States the 22.8 per cent. and the 33.4 per cent. of white women now 
are found who, although above the age of 21, cannot write their names. 
Nothing can be done for them; their cases are unalterably fixed. I turn 
to and do propose, however, to make a plea for the 7,500,000 not enrolled 
in any school, and also for the 10,500,000 that are within schools, both pri- 
vate and public. 
My investigation and study of the schools of my own city—Fort Worth— 
shows this: that of the whole number of pupils actually in the class-room, 
more than one-fourth are in the very first grade, and more than three-fourths 
are in the primary department; that of 2,437 registered, and of an actual 
daily attendance of 1,714 for the session just closed, only six were graduated 
at the end of the eleventh grade; and this has been the average graduation 
for three consecutive sessions. Is the situation in Fort Worth phenomenal, 
less hopeful, more alarming, than in the greater cities of our country? 
Chicago, 1886-7, gives out to the world that the average daily membership 
diminished from 18,000 in the first grade to 14,000 in the second, 11,000 
in the third, 7,600 in the fourth, 6,300 in the fifth, 4,400 in the sixth, 2,500 
 
-P-A-G-E-302
  802 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
in the seventh, and 1,500 in the eighth. These figures cover the primary 
and grammar grades—nothing is said about the high-school department. 
It is added, however, that these figures indicate an average of about three 
years for the 16,500 that disappeared between the first and eighth grades. 
Here is found an entire corroboration of the situation in Fort Worth, 
viz.: that in Chicago over twenty-seven per cent. are in the first grade, and 
over seventy-seven per cent. are in the primary department, leaving twenty- 
three per cent. only for the grammar grades—not quite so good a showing 
as in Fort Worth. 
The conclusjon is, that while only seven-twelfths of the school population 
are enrolled in the schools, we are met with still another fact: that of the 
number enrolled —seven-twelfths as in the case of Fort Worth—the actual 
daily attendance is seven-tenths of seven-twelfths, equal to forty-nine one- 
hundred-and-twentieths, or five-twelfths, nearly. Not one-half of the chil- 
dren have received instruction for the session; and I am prepared to show 
that the attendance in the schools of Fort Worth has steadily increased, 
while tardiness has decreased from seven per cent. during the first year for 
exceptional weeks, to one-half of one per cent. under best circumstances 
during many weeks of the last session just closed. 
Here are problems within problems: How shall we gather up the children 
and induce them to go toschool? The parent is supreme; and many thou- 
sands of the little innocent immortals have no father, “no mother dear.” 
Education is a cultivation mainly of the highest order of man—his rea- 
son. I am not prepared, therefore, for compulsory education. I believe 
the teachers, the ministers, the good people, the best citizens in every walk 
of life, should come to the rescue—should see that every coming American 
citizen shall have the opportunity to learn to read, to write, and to cipher; 
and while receiving these, while his head should be influenced, that the moral 
shall go side-by-side, pari passu, with the mental. This can be done; there 
is as much right and wrong in human actions as in arithmetic—but more 
on this hereafter. 
With only one-half of the children in the schools, the cry is continually com- 
ing up, “ We lack accommodations, we lack school-houses and appliances.” 
To prepare for the half out of school the school-houses must be doubled, the 
teachers must be doubled, the expenses must be doubled. I select out of 
hundreds of cases only a few. The Montgomery Advertiser, of July 4th, 1889, 
a leading journal of Alabama, has this to say: 
“The fact has been long developed that Montgomery needs more school room, 
and more money for the carrying on of the schools. The number of pupils in at- 
tendance is not near what it would be if the means were provided. This is a matter 
that our citizens in the near future should look after.” 
The same is true of all the cities; my city (Fort Worth) is confronted 
with the same problem. The cry comes from the great, the rich and pros- 
perous city of New York as to the crowded condition of the school-rooms. 
No wonder that children shun these “accommodations”!
-P-A-G-E-303
  THE PROBLEM OF THE HOUR. 303 
  
But if there is lack in the cities, what must be said for the country? Texas 
I know better than any other State, and no State is trying to do within her- 
self more than Texas, or really has done more; and yet her Superintendent, 
a man who is as brave as he is conscientious, as honest as he is patriotic, the 
Hon. O. H. Cooper, says: 
“An examination of the statistical tables will disclose the startling fact, that while 
we had 8,826 country schools reported as maintained during the year [1887-8], we 
had only 3,286 school-houses, and that of this mumber only 1,850 were reported as in 
good condition. . . . Five thousand five hundred and forty schools are not pro- 
vided with any kind of a school-house. They are temporarily housed in neighbor- 
hood churches, vacant barns or outhouses, and such other buildings as can be 
obtained for a nominal rental.” 
And now right here I state that this seems unpropitious, very discourag- 
ing; but if you have doubts as to this being true of many—of very many— 
of the best States in the Union, read the report of the Commissioner of 
Education (1886-7), chapters III, IV and V, pages 173 to 396, and see 
what the counties and cities say for themselves. 
With me this is an honest hour; and before I can offer a remedy, I want 
to know the extent of the malady. I have stated the malady, “Increased 
and increasing illiteracy.” 
Time and again have I plead for the children of the South; time and 
again have I urged that something must be done, and as often have my po- 
sitions, my efforts, been ridiculed. 
I now lay down this proposition: That every State in this Union, whether 
an independent entity and sovereign or not, has taken charge of the educa- 
tion of the children, and therefore, in duty bound, should provide the means, 
ample and in good faith, to carry it out. A second proposition—a corol- 
lary: Failing to do this, either from indisposition or inability, the General 
Government should at once doit. And here I repeat my position in regard 
to the duty of the General Government as announced in Washington, Feb- 
ruary, 1888. 
Now to the practical question: Can the Southern States, with less than 
half the resources of 1860, educate double the number of children then 
knocking at the door? 
If the States cannot do this, who should? I answer unhesitatingly, the 
General Government; that it is a well-established principle in ethics, that 
all rights are resolvable into duties; that the rights of citizenship come from 
the duties of citizenship. If the State exercises a right, she assumes. a re- 
ciprocal duty. The right, therefore, conferred by the fourteenth and fif- 
teenth amendments to the constitution in enfranchising over six millions of 
negroes —the highest and most responsible political privilege—demands of 
the United States (the power conferring this right) the preparation of these 
people to exercise this franchise. Upon this law of ethical philosophy, and 
the fact of the franchise already conferred, is based the duty of the govern- 
ment to make, and at once, full and ample preparation for the education
-P-A-G-E-304

not only of the colored voter, but for all the enfranchised citizens of this 
free republic, regardless of color or previous condition. 
The results of the war enfranchising the colored man, destroyed at the 
same time the means of educating the now illiterate white voter. 
T argue that simple justice demands this aid, and that the South should 
insist on it as a matter of right, and that the East and the North and the 
great Northwest should cheerfully concede the same, believing that they 
are but liquidating a fraternal obligation. But I am met on every hand, 
to show that the States can educate their own children, that it is no business 
of the General Government, with statements like the following: 
“According to statistics recently compiled by the Diwie Magazine, the aggre- 
gate increase in real-estate values in Texas, Alabama, Georgia, Virginia, Arkansas, 
Florida, North Carolina, and South Carolina, since 1880, is $794,914,992. Georgia 
shows an increase of 1,857 schools since 1880; South Carolina, 683; Florida, 969; 
Arkansas, 5,232; Texas, 2,295; Virginia, 2,264; North Carolina, 1,607; and Alabama, 
954: making a total increase of 14,861 in the last eight years. There are now in 
these States 50,289 schools, maintained at an annual expense of $9,702,261. The 
increase of tillable land for the same period is 11,273,577 acres—an area twenty per 
cent. larger than the State of Georgia. The total decrease of the debt of the eight 
States is $49,472,513.” 
The Diwie Magazine forgets that many of these States had no public-school 
system at all prior to the war, and hence in many cases the gain is all that 
has been done. But I propose to set opposite this picture another, drawn 
from a friendly source, the New Orleans Democrat: 
The thirteen Southern States, including Kentucky and Missouri, have funded 
debts aggregating $95,858,643, besides an unfunded debt amounting to $20,000,000 
more. The funded debt of the South is thus distributed:

For the benefit of this friendly journal, I will add that this is a debt of 
nearly $13 for every man, woman and child in the thirteen States enu- 
merated.

  THE PROBLEM OF THE HOUR. 305 
  
But this journal adds: “The remaining twenty-five States, comprising 
all those of the North, the Northwest and the Pacific slope, owe less than 
$48,000,000, funded and unfunded, if the amounts in the several sinking 
funds are subtracted from the nominal aggregate. It appears, therefore, 
that ten Southern States are loaded with more than two-thirds of all the 
State debts of the Union.” 
Of course this paper explains how this is, 7. e.: “This heavy and enor- 
mously disproportionate burden is mainly due to the years of misgovern- 
ment and plunder which the South endured under Republican carpet-bag 
rule.” ‘ 
Doubtless this is a good explanation—the correct solution; but does the 
explanation change the condition of the South? I will admit —I do rejoice 
in—the recuperative forces in the South, and will add that no country has 
done more, and done this more cheerfully, than the South, to discharge her 
double duties of educating alike the colored and the white children; but 
the question still comes up, presents itself to the fair-minded, is it right— 
devastated and impoverished as these States have been, as they are to-day— 
that they should be called on now to do at least twice the work with less 
than one-half of the means previous to 1860? 
Partisan politicians of both parties may continue to deal in mere asser- 
‘tions, may continue to deceive the people as to the real condition of the 
people, but these simple ipse dixits cannot long withstand the searching 
and penetrating rays of the sun of truth. The State of New York, with a 
population of less than one-third of the States enumerated, has a taxable 
value, omitting Missouri, of more than the remaining twelve States. She 
alone pays for schools more by $5,297,739, according to the statement of 
the Dixie Magazine, than all these, or an aggregate in round numbers of 
$15,000,000; and yet Superintendent Draper of this great State has this to 
say: 
“It is a common complaint that the public school terms are so short that they do 
not do much good. Of course, all the friends of public education very much regret 
that we cannot have longer terms; but how easy it would be for almost any neighbor- 
hood in the State to supplement the public funds by private subscriptions, and have 
longer terms. Many districts are now doing this, and more will do it as sentiment 
in educating the people improves. Legislation that tends to improve the teachers 
and lengthen the session will help to create favorable sentiment.” 
2 “As sentiment in educating the people improves;” mark the language. 
Again: “To supplement the public funds by private subscriptions,” shows 
that even in New York there is a lack of “funds” as well as sentiment. I 
have alréady indicated how this sentiment can be cultivated, and named the 
parties whose duty it is to see that an interest in the education of the chil- 
dren should be cultivated. 
The most magnificent sentiment, the most beneficent private subscription 
ever made for the South, was that of that large-hearted Christian philan- 
thropist, George Peabody, the author of the sentiment—and in a republic,

  the highest moral obligation —“ Education, a debt due from present to future 
generations,” and, at the same time, the provider of a fund that had up to 
1887 furnished for the South $1,596,749 to the Southern States; Texas 
alone having received $120,150 in seven years. This fund furnished a sup- 
plementary amount for nearly every city school in Texas, has paid since its 
inception the salary of the principal of the Sam. Houston Normal School, 
besides furnishing as high as $7,000 per annum for other expenses of this 
school; and in return, Texas, for what the Peabody fund did and she has 
done herself, graduated from this institution one thousand and fifty; and as 
many more who did not graduate have become teachers in this great empire 
State. The school is just ten years old. Last session there were three hun- 
dred in attendance, representing one hundred and ten counties. 
Texas needs, and when we can cultivate the “sentiment” among the peo- 
ple the Legislature will provide for, at least three more normal schools.* 
Mr. Depew, in his centennial oration lately delivered, gave the following 
facts. Said he: “Twenty millions—a vast majority of our people of intel- 
ligent age—acknowledging the authority of their several churches, twelve 
millions of children in the common schools, three hundred and forty-five 
universities and colleges for the higher education of men and two hundred 
for women, four hundred and fifty institutions of learning for science, med- | 
icine, and theology, are the despair of the scoffer and the demagogue, and 
the firm support of civilization and liberty.” 
He forgot that in this enumeration he failed to provide for the education 
of eight millions of children, or nearly one-half, and to add that the three 
hundred and forty-five universities and colleges, the two hundred for higher 
education for women, and the four hundred and fifty schools of medicine, 
law, etc., are only intended for and are offering this education to the four 
per cent. of the producing population that live by their brains only. What 
these institutions need is more students, and an extension of their instruc- 
tion to embrace hand culture, and, above all, a continuous and unbroken 
course of heart or moral culture. I cannot separate these three cultures in 
any system that I can devise. 
“Private subscriptions” are adding daily to the appliances for physical 
culture. “Harvard University spends $110,000; Amherst, $65,000; Cor- 
nell, $40,000; Princeton, $38,000; Yale, $13,000; Johns Hopkins, $10,000. 
Columbia proposes to expend $135,000, and Yale proposes to add $100,000 
to her ‘plant.’ Vassar will soon spend $20,000. The Adelphi Academy, 
Brooklyn, has gymnastic accommodations for 700 pupils. The Berkeley 
School, New York city, is to have a $75,000 gymnasium plant”—or over a 
half-million of dollars for this‘one department of instruction. And to all 
this, I say amen and amen, because I believe the recipients of such extra- 
ordinary advantages must see the necessity for extending aid down —down

among the little people; —must try to do something for the coming citizens 
—the American boy and girl—to fit them to perform their part in public 
and private, without and within the sacred precincts of home. 
Private subscriptions will never do this—can never do this. Private 
subscriptions are the hand-drill and pickax of a half-century ago. To-day 
we must have for our work the air compressor and the Burleigh drill of 
the Government. A new bill must be introduced into Congress, not of 
$77,000,000, but of $154,000,000, and the work of teaching the 20,000,000 
of children must begin in earnest in this the very first year of the second 
century of our national existence, if we hope to exist to enter upon the 
third century; and continue to give to the world an example of a free re- 
public, based upon political freedom, religious liberty, and universal educa- 
tion. 
Is there any good ground for seeming apprehension—alarm for our 
republic? Well, all things have not gone so well during the past decade. 
There has been a good deal of friction. There is to-day not the best feel- 
ing between the men who labor with their hands and the men who do not 
—between what I call work and wealth. 
We school-men should extend our fields of study ; we should look further 
into matters than perhaps we are expected. to—at least farther than we are, 
accredited as doing. 
I have told you how the equilibrium of our States can be maintained as 
States, as sovereignties, and our Union can be preserved. There must be 
preserved another equilibrium, and that among our industries—an equi- 
librium of agriculture, manufacture and commerce must be maintained. 
Under the heads of Transmutation, Transformation, and Transportation, I 
discussed this same subject in my “Railroad in Education” before the In- 
ternational Congress of Educators at the World’s Exposition, New Orleans, 
1885. I here briefly say Transmutation is agriculture, Transformation is 
manufacture, and Transportation is commerce. That in the morbid greed 
for gain—the ambition to grow rich in a short time—agriculture has been 
neglected; the quiet fields and the lonely forests have been abandoned by 
too many. The remuneration of the husbandman comes too slow for this 
fast age. Excuses are formed for thus deserting the homes and farms of 
our fathers: that the cities present advantages for church and schools, and 
I must therefore move to the city for social, for church and school facilities. 
The statistics of the country will bear me out; if you doubt the position, 
look them up; there is a lack of equilibrium in these industries. The 
statesman, the teacher, the minister of the gospel, and the press, all should 
~ come to the rescue. What shall be done? what can be done? 
Make agriculture more lucrative? No. Make the country home, society, 
church and school privileges better, more attractive. Highty-three per cent. 
of my people are in the country. Would they not be better pleased, better 
satisfied, if they had the same school facilities as the seventeen per cent. in

the cities? I do not wonder that the country people lack that high appre- 
ciation of their city cousins that they should entertain for them. 
I think George Peabody saw this, and that it was from a deep sense of 
his duty to the country that when about to die he called Dr. Sears, his 
trusted agent, to him and said: “ Doctor, look after Texas.” 
Fellow-teachers, we of the city schools should, if we have never done s0 
before, begin from this time on to look after the country people. What 
_ they need are schools and churches. Let the State and the nation furnish 
the schools and teachers, and private munificence and Christian philan- 
thropy furnish the churches and preachers; this will be a fair divide. Be- 
sides, the public schools have the children under their control six out of 
twenty-four hours, five out of seven days, nine out of twelve months, or 
about one-seventh of the time, during their attendance at school. It seems 
to me the churches and family ought to be satisfied with this division. I 
must confess that I am not afraid of wrong teaching, or a lack of moral 
teaching or correct teaching, in our public schools. About right and wrong 
and arithmetic, there is no controversy. We cannot afford to introduce 
controversies into the teachings of the public schools. We must confine 
ourselves to the teaching of that which both the laws of man and God re- 
quire; and since we have taught these so far without a text-book, will it not 
be better to continue in the same harmonious way? ~ 
“Watchman, what of the night?” And Time, the old watchman, an- 
swers: “Never have the balances weighing the destinies of mankind so 
quivered and trembled in these old hands since mighty Rome held the 
scepter that ruled the nations.” “This new world, with its giant strength 
and mighty strides, what is it going to do?” 
“Humanity, with all its fears, 
With all the hopes of future years, 
Is hanging breathless on its fate.” 
Father Time adds: “The faith in human kind expressed in our immortal 
Declaration is boundless; and right well has humanity responded to that 
confidence; right well is the verdict, despite partisan narrowness, despite 
prejudice and passion, despite incongruities nurtured for ages. Yet every 
thoughtful patriot, however sanguine and optimistic, becomes grave as he 
considers the question: ‘Can this government stand under this universal 
suffrage?’ The ignorant foreign population, the ignorant and vicious home 
population, white and black, North and South—will they not wreck our 
fair ship of'state?”” And Father Time again answers his own question: “No! 
no! if we will place under the second abutment of the arch of our republic 
universal education, which shall be interpreted to mean the education of the 
whole man—his head, his heart, and his hand—mentally, morally, and 
manually,” (if you will allow a new word.) 
“The God of the Universe, to whom we all bow and from whom we all 
learn lessons of wisdom, has said” —(I quote from a speech made by myself

in 1854, upon graduation at Randolph Macon College, Virginia, just when 
the sky began to lower and the muttering thunder of disunion was heard )— 
“The Divine Architect of Nature, Himself, has said in His lofty mountains 
and majestic rivers, ‘Be united.’ Observe their range and courses. The 
Blue Ridge, the Allegheny and the Rocky Mountains all run north and 
south; the great Mississippi with her vast tributaries parallel with them, 
waters the whole extent; there must be design in all this. The ancient 
poets and philosophers pictured a far-off land across the waters—a fairer 
abode; a land of equal rights anda happy people. This surely is that land, 
and through this people the Supreme Legislator has decreed that the true 
principles of government shall be taught all mankind. And as the blue 
arch above is in beauty shown us, so surely will it span the mightiest domain 
that ever shook earth.” 
Philology comes to our rescue and offers the strongest human agency in 
the shape of the universality of our mother-tongue. 
A clever modern. philologist shows that the English language is spoken 
to-day by 100,000,000 people; that soon, within a hundred years, it will be 
the language of 1,000,000,000 (one thousand million) souls; and adds, that 
then the great languages of the world will be the English, Chinese, and 
Russian, with the English far in the lead. But he does not tell us to what 
influence this wonderful spread of our language, this universality of our 
mother-tongue, is due. He does not tell why Europe was—is to-day—a 
Babel. He does not tell us that steam and electricity, iron and steel, have 
enabled this people to subdue, to possess the earth this side the Atlantic. 
He does not tell us that the echoes and re-echoes of the steam-whistle were 
not heard resounding through the corridors of the Alps till late this cen- 
tury! 
Mr. Webster was a great admirer of the mother-country, especially of her 
territorial acquisitions, her military glory, and in one of his grandest and 
loftiest flights of imagination, describing the progress and prowess, the great- 
ness and extent of the British nation, said: “It is a power which has dotted 
the face of the whole globe all over with her possessions and military posts, 
whose morning drum-beat, following the sun and keeping company with the 
hours, circles the earth daily with one continuous and unbroken strain of the 
martial airs of England.” 
It delights me, it thrills me, to think upon my country, my people, and my 
language! Could the immortals, could Jefferson, “the author of the Dec- 
laration;” could Washington, “the father of his country,” look out from 
their celestial abode, they would behold to-day our free republic, stretching 
through more than one hundred and eighty degrees of longitude, all dotted 
over with school-houses and colleges and churches, whose rising-bells and 
morning prayer-calls and evening hymns, following the sun in his course and

joyous shout and happy song of a continuous and unbroken continent of 
English-speaking people! : 
Poetry comes to our help, and weaves in verse and song what Nature has 
indicated —the perpetuity of this country, and how it is to be saved: 
“Our country unrivaled in beauty 
And splendor that cannot be told, 
How lovely thy hills and thy woodlands, 
Arrayed in a sunlight of gold. 
The eagle, proud king of the mountain, 
Is soaring majestic and free; 
Thy rivers and lakes in their grandeur, 
Roll on to the arms of the sea. 
“Our country with ardent devotion, 
In God may thy children abide; 
In Him be the strength of our nation, 
His laws and His counsel its guide. 
Our banner—that time-honored banner 
That floats o’er the ocean’s bright foam— 
God keep them unsullied forever— 
Our standard, our Union, our home.” 
.Fellow-teachers of the United States, will you not help to preserve the 
country which Nature says is one—our language and song say is one? 
Will you not return to your homes more favored than your neighbors, 
determined to preserve this whole country through its children, save the 
Republic upon the plan of its founders, viz.: Having placed as one abut- 
ment of this arch UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE, the other must be UNIVERSAL

THEME: PATRIOTISM. 
EDUCATION AND THE REPUBLIC. 
A. 8. COLYAR, NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE. 
I did not choose this subject—it was given me by the officials of this 
Association. ; 
In a discussion of the Republic is necessarily involved its powers, and I 
would most assuredly avoid any reference to the great war question of seces- 
sion and State sovereignty, believing the war was a final judgment, but for 
the reopening of these questions by the most eminent public man in the 
State, Judge Peter Turney, Chief Justice, and followed up by the leading 
newspaper, the Nashville American. 
Judge Turney has recently come forward in a carefully prepared speech, 
now widely circulated in pamphlet form, to prove the right of a State to 
secede from the Union, and this is followed by elaborate and carefully, and 
I may say ably, prepared articles in the Nashville American. 
The purpose seems to be to impress upon the rising generation in the 
South — to educate the youth in the belief—that this right exists by virtue 
of our organic form of government. 
With all due respect, I believe this to be both unsound and pernicious 
teaching. If the right ever existed, it remains, being suppressed —held in 
abeyance—by force. If it exists, why not assert it when we get strong 
enough, or can make the proper combinations? 
Judge Turney, in his speech, says “we yielded to the logic of force. The 
right still lives.” 
In the discussion the Chief Justice and the American both assert the right, 
but undertake to give it plausibility by discussing it in connection with 
the right of revolution. _ 
These doctrines must be kept separate. One is a right God gave to every 
people, and which cannot be taken away—a people can’t surrender it; the 
other, if it exist, is a right reserved, and depends not on force, but on law. 
In nations the right of revolution is like the right of self-defense in indi- 
viduals, and to further illustrate: no government would confer upon the 
citizen the right to decide when he should kill, and yet no government 
would take away the right to kill in self-defense. 
For myself, I do not believe the discussion of this doctrine ought to have 
been revived, but when it is formally and from the highest sources revived 
and pressed, I shall certainly make no apology to the public for replying 
to the argument.  
-P-A-G-E-312

  And I am glad of the opportunity to present the arguments against this 
doctrine to an association of people who deal with the youth of the coun- 
try, and aid them in making up a judgment as to the nature and power of 
the government whose destiny must soon come into their hands. 
The arguments against the right of secession are based upon the constitu- 
tion itself. The arguments in its favor are based upon the nature and 
powers of the States out of which the Union was made; and, taking a 
common-sense view of the question, they may be assimilated to a union in 
marriage. Does the husband or wife determine his or her rights, duties, 
and obligations by the sovereign rights and powers of each before marriage, 
or by the solemn vows at the altar? 
Metaphysical disquisitions on the separate organisms which made the 
Union, before the Union was formed, must all be subordinated to an en- 
lightened and courageous inquiry: What is the constitution? 
The advocates of secession lay great stress on the debates in the conven- 
tions when the constitution was ratified. It will be found that these debates 
were on what the constitution should be; and, indeed, up to this time there 
was a powerful party for retaining all power in the States. But the fact 
that the question was debated, and definitely decided, that the States should 
surrender the power to coin money, declare war, emit bills of credit, and 
‘regulate commerce, is the conclusive argument against State sovereignty. 
When a contract is reduced to writing, and a specified prohibition inserted, 
the fact that it was discussed, and insisted on but denied, forever cuts off all 
hope of reopening it on that point. 
1. The presumption arises that wise men would not make a government 
and provide the ways and means of putting an end to it. All governments, 
for four thousand years, have been, in contemplation, perpetuities. Even 
the American Indians make all their treaties to last “while grass grows and 
water runs.” 
2. There is no provision for adjusting and settling liabilities in case of 
disintegration. 
3. The men who made the constitution at all times afterwards, in common 
with all contemporaneous opinions, rejected the State-sovereignty construc- 
tion. In the first Congress were many of the men who were in the conven- 
tion that made the constitution, and when the judiciary act of 1789, giving 
the right of appeal from the judgments of the State Supreme Courts— 
where the constitution and laws of the United States were involyed—was 
under discussion, not a man raised the question that the States were sover- 
eign and the judgments final. In making a constitution and in passing the 
act of 1789, under and in conformity to it, giving this right of appeal, was 
not the sovereignty of the States expressly denied? This question arose in 
the first Congress of the Confederate States. The Senate, under Mr. 
Yancey’s influence, passed a judiciary act, copied from the judiciary act of 
1789, except it made the judgment of the State Supreme Court. final in all  
-P-A-G-E-313

  cases, giving no right of appeal. The House refused to pe 
shape. The Senate would not yield, Mr. Yancey saying’ 
thing we were fighting about; and because of this disagre 
court was organized. It will be remembered by all that 
was a complete government de facto, except it had no supreme court, ana ~~~ 
it seems not to be generally known that this was the reason. 
It is a significant and controlling fact that it was twenty-nine years after 
the adoption of the constitution before this doctrine of absolute State sover- 
eignty was asserted by anybody. The resolutions of ’98 are not forgotten, 
and will be noticed. 
This doctrine was first asserted by the Supreme Court of Virginia in 1816, 
in the case of Martin vs. Hunter’s Lessee, when the court refused to execute 
‘the judgment of the Supreme Court of the United States, reversing its own 
judgment, upon the grounds that the act of 1789, giving the right to the 
Supreme Court of the United States in certain cases to revise the judgments 
of the State courts, was in conflict with the constitution. From this decision, 
refusing to enter the judgment of the Supreme Court of the United States, 
a writ of error was sued out from the latter court, and in that case and a 
subsequent case of Cohen vs. The State of Virginia the whole question was 
considered by the Supreme Court of the United States. 
I propose to read somewhat at length from the two cases, to show that the 
court intended to decide the direct question as to the sovereignty of the 
States. 
In the case of Martin vs. Hunter’s Lessee, 1 Wheaton, the question arose 
on the following judgment of the Supreme Court of the State:      
    
“The court is unanimously of opinion that the appellate power of the Supreme 
Court of the United States does not extend to this court, under a sound construction 
of the constitution of the United States; that so much of the 25th section of the act 
of Congress to establish the judicial courts of the United States as extends the ap- 
pellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to this court, is not in pursuance of the 
constitution of the United States; that the writ of error in this cause was improvi- 
dently allowed under the authority of that act; that the proceedings thereon in the 
Supreme Court were coram non judice in relation to this court, and that obedience 
to its mandate be declined by the court.” 
And on this the court, Judge Story delivering the opinion, said: 
“The questions involved in this judgment are of great importance and delicacy. 
Perhaps it is not too much to affirm, that upon their right decision rest some of the 
most solid principles which have hitherto been supposed to sustain and protect the 
constitution itself. 
“The constitution of the United States was ordained and established, not by the 
States in their sovereign capacities, but emphatically, as the preamble of the con- 
stitution declares, by ‘the people of the United States.’ 
“The constitution was not, therefore, necessarily carved out of existing State 
sovereignties, nor a surrender of powers already existing in State institutions.” 
Page 574: 
“Tt has been argued that such an appellate jurisdiction over State courts is incon-

sistent with the genius of our government and the spirit of the constitution; that 
the latter was never designed to act upon State sovereignties, but only upon the 
people, and that, if the power exists, it will materially impair the sovereignty of the 
States and the independence of their courts. We cannot yield to the force of this 
reasoning. It assumes principles which we cannot admit, and draws conclusions to 
which we do not yield our assent. 
“Tt is a mistake that the constitution was not designed to operate upon States in 
their corporate capacities. It is crowded with provisions which restrain or annul 
the sovereignty of the States in some of the highest branches of their prerogatives. 
The tenth section of the first article contains a long list of disabilities and prohibi- 
tions imposed upon the States.” 
And in the case of Cohen vs. Virginia, 6 Wheaton, the court —Chief 
Justice Marshall delivering the opinion—says: 
“The questions presented by the court, by the first two points made at the bar, 
are of great magnitude, and may be truly said vitally to affect the Union. They 
exclude the inquiry whether the constitution and laws of the United States have been 
violated by the judgment which the plaintiffs in error seek to review, and maintain 
that, admitting such violation, it is not in the power of the Government to apply a 
corrective. They maintain that the nation does not possess a department capable 
of restraining peaceably and by authority of law any attempts which may be made 
by a part against the legitimate powers of the whole. 
“They maintain that the constitution of the United States has provided no tribu- 
nal for the final construction of itself, or of the laws or treaties of the nation, but 
that this, power may be exercised in the last resort by the courts of every State in 
the Union; that the constitution, laws and treaties may receive as many construc- 
tions as there are States; and that this is not a mischief, or, if a mischief, is irre- 
mediable. These abstract propositions are to be determined, for he who demands 
decision without permitting inquiry affirms that the decision he asks does not de- 
pend on inquiry. 
“Tf such be the constitution, it is the duty of the court to bow with respectful sub- 
mission to its provisions. If such be not the constitution, it is equally the duty of 
this court to say so, and to perform that task which the American people have as- 
signed to the judicial department. 
“And if-a State has surrendered any portion of its sovereignty, the question whether 
a liability to suit be a part of this portion depends on the instrument by which the 
surrender is made. 
“Tf, upon a just construction of that instrument, it shall appear that the State has 
submitted to be sued, then it has parted with this sovereign right of judging in every 
case on the justice of its own pretensions, and has intrusted that power to a tribunal 
in whose impartiality it confides. 
“The American States, as well as the American people, have believed a close and 
firm union to be essential to their liberty and to their happiness. They have been 
taught by experience that this Union cannot exist without a government for the 
whole, and they have been taught by the same experience that this government 
would be a mere shadow, that must disappoint all their hopes, unless invested with 
large portions of that sovereignty which belongs to independent States. Under the 
influence of this opinion and thus instructed by experience, the American people, in 
the conventions of their respective States, adopted the present constitution. 
“Tf it could be doubted whether, from its nature, it were not supreme in all cases 
where it is empowered to act, that doubt would be removed by the declaration that 
‘this constitution and the laws of the United States which shall be made in pursu-  
-P-A-G-E-315
EDUCATION AND THE REPUBLIC. 315 
  
ance thereof, and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of 
the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land, and the judges in every State 
shall be bound thereby, anything in the constitutions or laws of any State to the 
contrary notwithstanding.’ 
“This is the authoritative language of the American people; and, if gentlemen 
please, of the American States. It marks with lines too strong to be mistaken the 
characteristic distinction between the government of the Union and those of the 
States. The General Government, though limited as to its objects, is supreme in 
respect to those objects. This principle is a part of the constitution, and if there 
be any who-deny its necessity, none can deny its authority. 
“To this supreme government ample powers are confided, and if it were possible 
to doubt the great purposes for which they were so confided, the people of the United 
States have declared that they are given ‘in order to form a more perfect union, es- 
tablish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, pro- 
mote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to themselves and their 
posterity.’ 
“Tt is true that whenever hostility to the existing system shall become universal 
it will be also irresistible. The people made the constitution, and the people can 
unmake it. It is the creature of their own will, and lives only by their will. 
“But this supreme and irresistible power to make or to unmake resides only in 
the whole body of the people—not in any subdivision of them.” 
It will be seen by these quotations that the court, in these two cases, was 
adjudicating and settling the question of construction as to the sovereignty 
of the States, with power to judge for themselves whether the General Gov- 
ernment was giving them what they might claim under the constitution. 
The first case was in 1816, and the whole doctrine was reviewed in the second 
case in 1821. On the bench at that time were Chief Justice Marshall and 
Associate Justices Story, Washington, Livingston, Johnson, Todd, and 
Duvall, and the Attorney General was William Wirt. The decisions were 
unanimous in both cases. The doctrine here laid down by Marshall and 
Story is fully indorsed by Mr. Kent in the first volume of his Commentaries, 
and has been reaffirmed over and over again by the Supreme Court. 
And now I propose.to present and press with the emphasis which the 
gravity of the question demands, that we live in a government of law and 
not of force; that the framers of the government intended that law should 
reign supreme. I would impress upon the young men of this country that 
when the highest court in the land puts a construction on the constitution, 
that ends the debate until the people get ready for a revolution: that settles 
the question of right under the constitution. In the very nature of things 
this must be so. When the Supreme Court of the United States, in a case 
properly raising the question—as both of these cases did—said that the 
government was not a compact or league between the States, but a govern- 
ment by the people, and the power to make or unmake resides in the whole 
body of the people, and not in a part of them, it was a construction of the 
constitution by the tribunal which the makers of the government provided 
to construe it, and good citizenship demands obedience to the decision. 
Therefore I say that these decisions are not mere arguments, but the ques- 
 
-P-A-G-E-316
316 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
tion is res judicata. Res judicata if this is a government of law, but not res 
judicata if it is a government of force. 
Did the framers provide for force? If so, it is the first and only structure 
for a civil government ever created which provided for the adjustment of 
organic rights by force. 
I want to doubly emphasize this question. I want to press it and burn it into 
the mind and conscience of everyone who thinks the nature and character of 
the government is deserving of consideration. Is this a government of law? 
If so, when the supreme authority —the august court created to construe the 
constitution and expressly so provided — decides that a State is not a sover- 
eign, that it only has sovereign rights, and that many of its attributes of sov- 
ereignty have been surrendered and vested in the General Government, is 
not a compact, a mere agreement of the States, to last during the pleasure 
of any one of them, but that it is a government made by the whole people 
and in perpetuity. Ifso, I repeat, does not good citizenship demand acqui- 
escence? If this is a government of law, does not this end the controversy? 
I respectfully protest against making the argument that a State may right- 
fully secede because it is a sovereign, and then supporting it by the doctrine 
of self-defense, force resisting force. This is begging the question. If the 
right exists, it is a question of will and not of resistance. Such an argu- 
ment as this is practically an abandonment of the right and the substitution 
of revolution. Let us adopt this, and then our people will know what they 
are doing when they go to war. 
I have, as you see, laid great stress on the decisions of the courts, because 
this is eminently a government of law. But suppose we look to individual 
men. The South has had many great men who have been conspicuous in 
the affairs of this nation—Washington, Jefferson, Madison, Monroe, Jack- 
son, Benton, Clay, Calhoun, and Marshall. Only one of all her eminent 
statesmen —Mr. Calhoun— believed in the doctrine of a “Compact between 
the States.” All the rest held to the idea of a union of the States forming 
a nation —with delegated powers, it is true, but sovereign powers, and not 
to be withdrawn by the States. 
I first present the doctrine as maintained by a man who is peculiarly the 
South’s pride and boast. 
It is often said that Andrew Jackson’s proclamation was on nullification, 
which, it is said, is not the question of secession. But Gen. Jackson, in his 
famous proclamation, seeing what nullification led to, took up secession 
and discussed it. Here is what he said about secession: 
“This right to secede is deduced from the nature of the constitution which, they 
say, is a compact between the sovereign States, which have preserved their whole 
sovereignty, and therefore subject to no superior; that because they made the com- 
pact they can break it when, in their opinion, it has been departed from by the other 
States. Fallacious as this course of reasoning is, it enlists»State pride, and finds 
advocates in the honest prejudices of those who have not studied the nature of our 
Government sufficiently to see the radical error on which it rests.”—Proclamation of 
Gen. Jackson, 1833.
-P-A-G-E-317
  EDUCATION AND THE REPUBLIC. 317 
  
Here Gen. Jackson enters into an elaborate argument to show that the 
Government was formed by and for the people at large of the several States, 
and says: 
“The constitution of the United States, then, forms a government, not a league}; 
and whether it be formed by compact between the States, or in any other manner, 
its character is the same. It is a’ government in which all the people are repre- 
sented, which operates directly on the people individually, not upon the States; 
they retained all the power they did not grant. But each State, having expressly 
parted with so many powers as to constitute, jointly with the other States, a single 
nation, cannot from that period possess any right to secede, because secession does 
not break a league, but destroys the unity of a nation; and any injury to that unity 
is not only a breach which would result from the contravention of a compact, but it 
is an offense against the whole Union. 
“To say that any State may at pleasure secede from the Union is to say that the 
United States is not a nation, because it would be a solecism to contend that any 
part of a nation might dissolve its connection with the other parts, to their injury 
or ruin, without committing any offense. Secession, like any other revolutionary 
act, may be morally justified by the extremity of oppression; but to call it a con- 
stitutional right is confounding the meaning of terms, and can only be done through 
gross error, or to deceive those who are willing to assert a right, but would pause 
before they make a revolution, or incur the penalties consequent on a failure.” 
MADISON. 
The man whose views should have the greatest weight on this question is 
James Madison. 
1. He is generally accepted as the great constitutional expounder of his 
day. 
2. In the convention that made the constitution, with such statesmen as 
Washington, Franklin, Hamilton, Rutledge, Sherman, Gerry, Randolph, the 
two Pinckneys, and Mason, Madison was the great leader, and especially 
the great leader of the Republican or Democratic party. 
3. Mr. Madison wrote the resolutions of 98, the only resting-place for 
secession and nullification, as claimed by the adherents of these doctrines. 
In a letter to Gen. James Robertson, of this city, in 1832, he for the first 
time admitted to be true the report that he wrote the resolutions of ’98. 
Finding what mischief these resolutions were doing by a misconstruction, 
Mr. Madison undertook, in 1830, ’31 and ’32, to correct and put right the 
public mind. In letters to Gen. Robertson, Messrs. Everett, Cabell, Steven- 
son, Haynes, Trist, Townsend, and various other persons, in the most em- 
phatic language he denies that the resolutions were intended to convey any 
other idea than that the alien and sedition laws should be condemned, and 
repealed by force of public opinion. In one of these letters, all of which are 
collected by Mr. Benton in his “Thirty Years in the Senate,” he says, in 
contradiction of the construction put on the resolutions of ’98 by the nulli- 
fiers and secessionists : 
“Being thus derived from the same source as the constitutions of the States, it 
[the Constitution of the United States] has within each State the same authority as
-P-A-G-E-318
    318 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  
the constitution of the State, and is as much a constitution in the strict sense of the 
term, within its prescribed sphere, as the constitutions of the States are within their 
spheres, but with this obvious and essential difference: that, being a compact among 
the States in their highest sovereign capacity, and constituting the people thereof 
one people for certain purposes, it cannot be altered or annulled at the will of the 
States individually, as a constitution of a State may at its will.” 
Again he says: “Like the States, the Federal Government has at com- 
mand a physical force for executing the powers committed to it.” He says: 
“Any other doctrine would speedily put an end to the Union.” 
The truth is, Mr. Madison spent the latter years of his life in combatting 
the doctrine of secession. 
In view of the fact that Mr. Madison wrote the resolutions of ’98, and 
that he is, more than any one of the fathers, the father and expounder 
of the constitution, his opinion is second only in importance to the decision 
of the court created to construe the constitution. Especially is this so 
when we remember that he was not only in the convention that made 
the constitution, and more than any other man its author, but he was in 
the first Congress when every feature of the constitution passed under re- 
view. He was then Jefferson’s Secretary of State during both terms, where 
for eight years he was obliged to review what he had done, and where he 
was daily brought in contact with Mr. Jefferson in considering the scope 
and power of the new Government. And then for eight years more, from 
1808 to 1816, including the time of the war with Great Britain, and the 
conflict between the Supreme Court of Virginia and the Supreme Court of 
the United States, he was in a wider field— President of the United States, 
where his intensest thought was given to the constitution. Surely, then, 
when Mr. Madison had retired to private life, and looking back over the 
work he had done, his utterances on this absorbing subject must be listened 
to with great consideration. Mr. Madison, taking all he said, in substance 
says: 
“Yes, I helped to make the constitution, nearly half a century ago. As a mem- 
ber of Congress, Secretary of State, and President of the United States, I construed 
it, and I wrote the resolutions of 98. I conferred with Mr. Jefferson at the time 
and afterwards. I have studied them in the concrete and in the abstract; they have 
been constantly before my mind for thirty years and more; I have studied them as 
a part of the history of the country. I am now an old man, more than four-score. 
I am speaking for the country I have faithfully served, and that I love more than 
life, and now, speaking for both myself and my life-time friend, Mr. Jefferson, whose 
voice is still in death, I assert that neither the constitution of my country nor the 
resolutions of ’98 cozitain, or in the slightest degree favor, the doctrine of secession.” 
For myself, I take this evidence rather than the ingenious arguments of 
men whose utterances, to say the least, come out of much heat and passion. 
JEFFERSON. 
Mr. Jefferson is next in importance, a State’s-rights Democrat. Did he 
believe in secession? He wrote the Kentucky resolutions of ’99, but his  
-P-A-G-E-319
  EDUCATION AND THE REPUBLIC. 319 
biographer, Mr. Randall, says he agreed with Mr. Madison in the construc- 
tion, and in his own letter to Mr. Nichols, written in August, 1819, he in 
express terms accepts Mr. Madison’s view of revolution, and not secession ; 
and Mr. Madison wrote five letters to friends, which Mr. Benton publishes, 
all written after Jefferson’s death, roundly asserting that Mr. Jefferson never 
- believed in the doctrine. 
Mr. Jefferson says in one of his letters, that he and Mr. Madison had 
agreed on all public questions; and just before he died he said he would 
leave the world with the warmest affection for Mr. Madison, and that he 
was glad to leave behind him one who would be the guardian of his fame. 
After Mr. Jefferson’s renunciation in 1799 of the extreme views of ’98, 
and his acceptance of Mr. Madison’s views, there is not a word in his vast 
writings favoring the ‘doctrine. 
Mr. Jefferson was a combative man, and if he had disagreed with the de- 
cisions of the Supreme Court in 1816 and 1821, he would have said so, 
especially as he disliked Chief Justice Marshall exceedingly, and was always 
outspoken when the Chief Justice did what he did not approve. 
After Madison, Jackson, and Jefferson, the next most important figure 
on all truly Democratic questions is Thomas H. Benton; indeed, it is doubt- 
ful if, as we get away from the heat of political conflicts and see men and 
things in the light of history, any man except Washington will rank Colonel 
Benton as a statesman. 
Mr. Benton, in his “Thirty Years in the Senate,” devoted several chap- 
ters to the discussion of this question, treating it as the most absurd and at 
the same time the most dangerous doctrine ever brought into the arena of 
American politics. He, in that masterly style of logic and fact peculiar to 
himself, simply grinds into atoms this great American heresy. 
As a history of the question, with the men who supported it and the mo- 
tives, together with the analysis of the constitution and the resolutions of 
°98, his treatise ought to be read by every student of American history. 
Next in importance as lawyer, statesman and Democrat, is Felix Grundy, 
who was in the Senate in 1833 when Mr. Calhoun first brought the doctrine 
of nullification and secession into the Congress by a string of resolutions 
supported by a prepared speech. Mr. Grundy immediately arose and of- 
fered counter resolutions, and declared his unalterable opposition to the 
doctrine. 
In support of Mr. Grundy’s resolutions and in opposition to Mr. Cal- 
houn’s, that great American lawyer, Mr. Webster, saw and expressed him- 
self as amazed—utterly amazed—that anyone should seriously argue in 
favor of such a right. 
Mr. Clay was at all times equally emphatic and explicit in denouncing it 
as a heresy. : 
Where does this doctrine rest? On what does it stand? I have gone 
back and examined the debates in the convention. Under the articles of
-P-A-G-E-320
  320 ' THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  
confederation the Congress had no power over the great questions of im- 
posts, commerce, coinage, etc., except by getting the consent of the States. 
This defect, as every reader of our history must know, came near proving 
a disaster. The States were slow—hesitated—and at one time seemed to 
be utterly opposed to giving to the General Government the power to regu- 
late their commerce between each other and with foreign nations; to collect 
taxes; to declare war; to coin money, and especially if some or all of these 
powers were to be denied to the States. 
It is a notorious fact that the small politicians in the States manfully con- 
tended against giving the General Government any powers except as the 
States might from time to time consent. But every one of that grand galaxy 
of statesmen who had been conspicuous in the eight years of trial, was for 
giving the General Government such powers as would make it a nation, with 
power to perpetuate its own existence. 
The letter from General Washington, on his retiring from the army, more 
than all other causes, brought over the State legislatures, and prepared the 
way for putting into the constitution these provisions: 
“No State shall enter into any treaty, alliance or confederation; grant letters of 
marque or reprisal; coin money; emit bills of credit; make anything but gold and 
silver coin a tender in payment of debts; pass any bill of attainder, ew post facto 
law, or law impairing the obligation of contracts, or grant any title of nobility. 
“No State shall, without the consent of the Congress, lay any imposts or duties on 
imports or exports, except what may be absolutely necessary for executing its in- 
spection laws; and the net produce of all duties and imposts laid by any State on 
imports or exports shall be for the use of the treasury of the United States; and all 
such laws shall be subject to the revision and control of Congress. 
“No State shall, without the consent of Congress, lay any duty on tonnage, keep 
troops or ships of war in time of peace, enter into any agreement or contract with 
another State or with a foreign power, or engage in war, unless actually invaded or 
in such imminent danger as will not admit of delay. 
“This constitution and the laws of the United States which shall be made in pur- 
suance thereof, and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of 
the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land, and the judges in every 
State shall be bound thereby, anything in the constitution or laws of any State to 
the contrary notwithstanding.” 
With these provisions, if the constitution was a perpetuity not limited 
in duration, the State was no longer sovereign; it had sovereign rights; but 
a State that can’t declare war, coin money, regulate commerce, emit bills of 
credit, is not a sovereign. The question at once arises, with these plain 
provisions, how can the friends of secession claim that a State is sovereign? 
It is due to the great author of this doctrine, Mr. Calhoun, to say, that 
when he introduced into Congress his platform for secession, he didn’t un- 
dertake to say that by the letter or spirit of the constitution the States 
were sovereign, or that the government was less than a perpetuity. But he 
argued the right from the policy, and cited the Roman history when, by de- 
mand of the minority —the plebeians—in the conflict with the patricians,
-P-A-G-E-321
  
  EDUCATION AND THE REPUBLIC. e 321 
  
the tribune was established, and then, in support of the right of secession, 
he referred to the Jewish government, when the ten tribes under Jereboam 
seceded. 
Then again I ask, where does this claim rest? I repeat, not a man who 
helped to make the constitution claimed it; not a man who was in the first 
Congress -when its vital parts were constructed in making the judiciary act 
claimed it; the Supreme Court for one hundred years has repudiated it; the 
three great authors—Story, Cooley and Bancroft— who have written works 
on the constitution, all repudiate it; the authors of the resolutions of ’98— 
Madison and Jefferson—repudiate it. No defender of the doctrine has yet 
put his finger on a single one of the fathers who believed in it. 
It is true Justice Turney quotes one eminent author to sustain secession, 
and this is the quotation from Story’s Commentaries on the Constitution: 
“The obvious deductions which may be, and indeed have been, drawn from con- 
sidering the constitution as a compact between the States, are that it operates as a 
mere treaty or convention between them, and has no obligatory force upon each 
State any longer than it suits its pleasure or its consent continues ; that each State 
has a right to judge for itself in relation to the nature, extent and obligation of the 
instrument without being at all bound by the interpretation of the Federal Govern- 
ment, or by that of any other State; and that each retains the power to withdraw 
from the confederacy and dissolve the connection, when such shall be its choice; 
and may suspend the operations of the Federal Government and nullify its acts 
within its own territorial limits whenever, in its own opinion, the exigency of the 
case may require. These conclusions may not always be avowed, but they flow 
naturally from the doctrine which we have under consideration.” 
Turning to the text, it will be found that instead of this being an author- 
ity by this eminent law-writer in favor of the doctrine of secession, it was 
Judge Story’s summing-up of the heresy of secession as taught by its sup- 
porters, so that he might expose it; and what follows, after stating the 
heresy is: 
“They [these conclusions] go to the extent of reducing the Government to a 
mere confederacy during pleasure, and of thus presenting the extraordinary spec- 
tacle of a nation existing only by the will of each of its constituent parts. 
“Tf this be the true interpretation of the instrument, it has wholly failed to ex- 
press the intention of its framers, and brings back upon us all the evils of the old 
confederation from which we were supposed to have had a safe deliverance. For 
the power to operate upon individuals, instead of operating merely on States, is of 
little consequence, though yielded by the constitution, if that power is to depend 
for its exercise upon the continual consent of all the members upon every emer- 
gency. 
“We have already seen that the framers of the instrument contemplated no such 
dependence. Even under the confederation it was deemed a gross heresy to main- 
tain that a party to a compact has a right to revoke that compact, and the possi- 
bility of a question of this nature was deemed to prove the necessity of laying the 
foundations of our national government deeper than in the mere sanction of dele- 
gated authority.” 
Again, Judge Story says: 
“But that which would seem conclusive on the subject (as has been already stated),  
-P-A-G-E-322
  322 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  
is the very language of the constitution itself, declaring it to be a supreme funda- 
mental law, and to be of judicial obligation and recognition in the administration 
of justice. ‘This constitution,’ says the sixth article, ‘and the laws of the United 
States which shall be made in pursuance thereof, and all treaties made, or which 
shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of 
the land; and the judges in every State shall be bound thereby, anything in the con- 
stitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding.’ If it is the supreme 
law, how can the people of any State, either by any form of its own constitution or 
laws, or other proceedings, repeal, or abrogate, or suspend it ?” 
So it will be seen that Chief Justice Turney’s examination of this great 
author was superficial, for of all the law-writers on this question, with the 
exception of Marshall, he was the clearest. His argument, based on the 
constitution itself, is absolutely conclusive —leaves nothing to stand on, and 
shows beyond dispute that the doctrine of secession is a heresy. 
THE MEN WHO MADE THE CONSTITUTION. 
Who were the men that studied out and made and construed this consti- 
tution, rising above sectional, local or personal prejudices? Great men 
come in shoals. Czsar and Cicero came at the same time; Shakespeare, 
Bacon and Ben Jonson came at the same time; but when Washington and 
Franklin and Hamilton and Jefferson and Madison and John and Sam 
Adams and Lee and Rutledge and Marshall all appeared on the stage at 
one time, it was a galaxy the like of which had never appeared on this _ 
planet, and they are the men who made and construed the constitution, 
and they unanimously pronounced the constitution good and in perpetuity, 
with the sovereignty in the whole people, and the powers of the government 
divided between the Federal and State governments, and without power in 
any to destroy the government except by revolution. 
But the makers of the constitution intended to leave no doubt on the 
subject, for in their letter which they sent out with the constitution to the 
people, urging its adoption, they said: 
“Tt is obviously impracticable in the Federal Government of these States to 
secure all rights of independent sovereignty to each, and yet provide for the inde- 
pendence and safety of all. Individuals entering into society must give up a share 
of liberty to preserve the rest. In all our deliberations on this subject we kept 
steadily in our view that which appeared to us the greatest interest of every true 
American, the consolidation of our Union, in which is involved our prosperity, felic- 
ity, safety, perhaps our national existence.” 4 
And it is a notorious fact, that in ratifying the constitution the States 
manifested the greatest caution and made many declarations in favor of 
amendments and reserved powers, yet there is nowhere to be found the 
slightest allusion to the instrument as a league or confederation, and no 
reservation of any right on the part of any State to dissolve its connection, 
or to abrogate its assent, or to suspend the operations of the constitution as 
to itself. 
The language of the articles of confederation was: “The said States
-P-A-G-E-323
  EDUCATION AND THE REPUBLIC. 323 
  
hereby severally enter into a firm league of friendship with each other for 
their common defense, binding themselves to assist each other.” But in 
making the constitution the language is: “We, the people of the United 
States, do ordain and establish this constitution for the United States of 
America.” The people do ordain and establish, not contract and stipulate 
with each other. The people of the United States, not the distinct people 
of a particular State with the people of the other States. The people or- 
dain and establish a “constitution,” not a “confederation.” The distinction 
between a constitution and a confederation is well known and understood. 
The latter is a pure confederation, a mere treaty or league between inde- 
pendent States, and binds no longer than during the good pleasure of each. 
It rests forever in articles of compact, where each is, or may be, the supreme 
judge of its own rights and duties. 
The former is a permanent form of government, where the powers once 
given are irrevocable, and cannot be resumed or withdrawn at pleasure. 
Whether formed by a single person, or by different societies of people, in 
their political capacity, a constitution, though originating in consent, be- 
comes, when ratified, obligatory as a fundamental ordinance of law. 
The authorities, as well as the reasons, which I have presented against 
secession contain nothing new to the men who heard the question discussed 
as it was when the old Whig party was alive; but the young men of to-day, 
at least in Tennessee, seeing the speech of the Chief Justice, and some lead- 
ing newspapers, in support of the doctrine, unanswered, accept the doctrine 
as sound, and therefore I have gladly availed myself of this opportunity to 
answer the arguments advanced in support of secession. 
If, as Judge Turney says, “the right still lives—vwe yielded to the logic 
of force,” why not, when we are strong enough, assert our rights? If under 
the constitution we have a right to secede—a pure, naked constitutional 
right—a right denied us “by the logic of force,” a right held in abeyance 
by force of arms, and we are heavily taxed to pay the soldiers who disarmed 
us, made to pay millions, many millions, annually in the way of pensions 
and the accumulated cost of the war—and all this in violation of the con- 
stitution, why not resist, by secession, if we have the right, when we get 
strong enough? 
Suppose we first satisfy the rising generation that the constitution is only 
a league, not a government in perpetuity, and in the course of time some 
powerful orator like William L. Yancey fires the hearts of the young men 
of the South by pointing to the millions they are paying for their own un- 
lawful subjugation, and to the very men who deprived them of the right, 
and show them how they have been strengthened by numbers and resources, 
and how they can put one crop of cotton in Europe to draw on, breaking 
down all the factories of the North. Will they not be prompted to secede 
and take the consequences? 
Gen. Jackson knew men when he said, Make the people of the States be-  
-P-A-G-E-324
  324 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  
lieve they have a right to dissolve the Union by secession and they will as- 
sert it without counting the cost. 
The scenes of 1861 were the fulfillment of Gen. Jackson’s prophecy, that 
when the people of the States were educated into the belief that they had a 
right—a constitutional right —to secede, they, in the assertion of the right, 
would not count the cost. Whereas, if they are educated into the doctrine 
of a right of revolution, it would be a question of oppression and not of con- 
stitutional right, and knowing the consequences of war, they would engage 
in it when actual oppression made it necessary. 
Therefore I have presented this argument, that our young men may know 
that this is not the doctrine of the men who made the constitution. And I 
would impress upon our young men the danger from a spirit of disintegra- 
tion, the folly of secession, and the absolute madness of men who want either 
a government with all power by centrifugal force thrown out to the States, 
or by centripetal force brought to the center. 
No study that a young man may apply himself to would awaken and ele- 
vate his patriotism to the same extent as an exhaustive examination of the 
great men, with their works, who made the constitution. Contending with 
the most powerful nation on the earth, through an eight-years war, the Con- 
gress driven from city to city, the people divided in sentiment, the army re- 
duced until every soldier was begging for bread—indeed, when the war 
closed, the Congress, upon a most pathetic appeal of Washington, was un- 
able to raise by any possible means money to pay the soldiers one month. 
The articles of confederation had proved the folly of sovereign States; 
but the people of the States said we must collect all the revenue that is col- 
lected; we must regulate commerce; but the fathers said, this is folly, and 
through a period lasting nearly as long as the war, Washington, Franklin, 
Hamilton, Jefferson, the Adamses, the Pinckneys, the Rutledges, Madison, 
and indeed all the great spirits who had seen and suffered by a league in- 
stead of a government, begged and implored the people to make a govern- 
ment, with powers of: self-existence and self-execution, and this wonderful 
complex system, with the sovereign powers divided between the Federal 
and State governments, was the result. Shall this or any future generation 
or any section tear it to pieces? 
I am bold to plant myself on the side of a Union of the States, and I am 
bold to declare myself against the doctrine of secession, to stand with the 
fathers for a government that is worth all it cost. My ancestors were at 
King’s Mountain and aided in making this a nation, and my brother laid 
down his life in Mexico defending the American flag. All my education 
teaches me that this is a government that must be preserved, and that the 
South can only be reconciled to its anomalous condition by the philosophy 
which flows from treating the war as a revolution —as Tennessee did regard it. 
Besides, I am not ready to leave the Democratic party, and I don’t want 
to see that party confined to the South. But if the doctrine of secession is
-P-A-G-E-325
  EDUCATION AND THE REPUBLIC. 825 
taught, no Northern man can afford to belong to the party. The doctrine 
is confined exclusively to the South, and in this lies much of the danger. . 
What do the undeniable facts here given show? That secession has had 
three outbreaks: (1) In Virginia, when the-alien and sedition laws made 
Virginia red hot; (2) when the tariff act of 1828 made South Carolina 
doubly red hot in 1833; and (3) when the slavery question fired the whole 
South. It is manifest, therefore, that this doctrine comes from, grows out 
of, irritation and exciting causes; while, on the other hand, the men who 
made the constitution, the courts that construed it, and all the fathers, who 
in their cool moments, whether as judges, lawyers, or statesmen, utterly re- 
pudiated it. 
EDUCATION. 
The necessity of education— educating the masses—in a republic, where 
the masses through their public servants make and execute the laws, and 
where the frequency of elections makes them the custodians of power, is so 
universally conceded, that ingenuity —the spice of argument — can nowhere 
be utilized. The argument ends with the truism that free government is 
based on the virtue and intelligence of the people. 
But in this connection, duty demands that I shall speak frankly on the 
question of turning over to the States, on a basis of illiteracy, for educational 
purposes, some portion of the vast surplus in the Federal treasury. The 
vote in the Senate shows that both parties favor it: the Democratic vote was 
four-fifths, lacking one, for the measure. But the whole American people 
for nearly six years have, with surly gravity, suffered an indignity at the 
hands of their public servants which is without a parallel. Two confessions 
have been made which stand unchallenged: one, that the House of Repre- 
sentatives, without drawing party lines, was overwhelmingly for the measure ; 
the other, that a committee appointed by the Speaker took control of it, and 
said the people’s representatives should not be allowed to vote onit. It would 
be difficult, keeping in the bounds of excusable language, to characterize this 
indignity. 
Turning from this unpleasant piece of history, I use this happy occasion, 
in the presence of this vast audience, an audience whose mission it is to pre- 
pare for life’s duties the rising generation, to speak freely of what, as I verily 
believe, is a grievous omission in the training of our young people. 
If I could impress upon every teacher here one, and only one, leading 
thought, which might grow into a conviction that, like the gentle words of 
a warm heart, would inspire the youth with its touch in every school-room 
in this broad land, it would be that patriotism, love of country, as an ele- 
ment of education, must not be neglected. I greatly fear that climatic 
. influences, sectional feeling, divergent interests, local jealousies, with our 
money-getting habits, are cooling the ardor of patriotism; and in this I am 
strengthened by finding in our universities, colleges, and common schools, 
21—N. B.A.
-P-A-G-E-326
  326 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  
rarely any text-book or professor’s chair where love of country and the 
blessings of free government are placed in the foreground. 
No man who knows what the school-house was fifty years ago, and sees it 
now, can be otherwise than amazed and delighted at the intellectual regen- 
eration. To an old man it isa revelation. From the humdrum, wet-weather- 
frog-pond jargon which, if it had been put on the graphophone and preserved, 
would be listened to now with the same sensation that aroused the builders 
of Babel when each spake in strange tongues; from this condition of the 
school-house I now see the school-room with the quiet order of a banking- 
house, with the work of each assigned in such manner as to develop speed, 
bottom and metal, and where every attempt at jockey-riding is detected, and 
hence where the race is run “on the square.” 
But this is all purely intellectual; it is science, and philosophy, and geog- 
raphy; it is astronomy, and mathematics, and book-keeping; and all this I 
commend. But into the university, the college, the private and public 
school-rooms, I hope to see placed a new professor’s chair—the philosophy 
of patriotism, or love of country. 
This work requires a new set of school-books, and I say frankly that I 
would gladly see some new school-books. Let science, mental and moral 
philosophy find their devotees in the college and in the press; but in the 
school-room suppose we brighten black-letter, inspirit biography and warm 
up the cold facts of history with sacred memories—sweet recollections of 
the past. Suppose we revive the incidents and anecdotes of the men who 
builded for us the wonderful fabric, the novel structure in which we dwell. 
And here I must touch on a delicate subject. I would, as much as pos- 
sible, keep out of the school-room our internal dissensions, and plant our 
patriotism on our common glories, on which, without regard to section, we 
can all feed. 
I would gladly, if I tould, keep the Grand Army of the Republic and 
the Southern Bivouac out of the school-room, because they widen rather 
than heal breaches, and because this Government can only be perpetuated 
by a unity of sentiment based on a unity of interests, and the baptism of a 
common paternity. 
To illustrate: If you will pardon the reference to home, I would be glad 
to see some man write a school history for Tennessee, who himself was in- 
spirited with King’s Mountain and New Orleans; in fact, who was himself 
saturated with the love of country which our dead heroes fondly hoped 
their example would inspire in every Tennessean, and in it make the deeds 
of heroism, of true bravery, whether on the battle-field or in the council, a 
leading feature. I would be glad to see our young men turning aside from 
book-keeping and money-making long enough to read about the trials and 
sacrifices and undying patriotism of John Sevier, and of that grand man 
who came upon the stage and in his strides of patriotic fervor wrote upon 
the tablets of time: Andrew Jackson and Tennessee and Tennessee and
-P-A-G-E-327
  EDUCATION AND THE REPUBLIC. 327 
  
Andrew Jackson; and of that mystic embodiment of patriotism, Sam Hous- 
ton, who resigned the office of Governor of Tennessee, and went as a wan- 
derer into the wilderness and brought back an empire; or of the immortal 
Davy Crockett, the wizard of the woods, who, like Sam Houston, journeyed 
to the West, with his rifle on his shoulder and his life in his hand, and with 
other Tennesseeans made immortal the land he loved in the inscription, 
“Remember the Alamo!” 
In teaching patriotism, the principles of the constitution must be in- 
grounded. The man who would encourage centralization is equally culpa- 
ble with the man who teaches secession. This is a government of sovereign 
rights, to be exercised partly through the Federal and partly through the 
State governments; it is a government of divided powers; and the arbiter 
of all disputes about what is meant, is the judiciary. There is one great 
power in the hands of the people—it is the right of revolution; and until 
this point is reached, obedience to the adjudications as to the rights of the 
two governments in one is political orthodoxy; anything else is political 
heresy — that is, that there is a civil and a constitutional right rising above 
the judiciary, is political heresy, and it ought to be so treated. 
In conclusion, let me remind you that it is with you to plant in the gen- 
eration rising in sight the seeds of harmony or the seeds of discord. 
The seeds of discord in this great Republic need to be checked, not en- 
couraged. The seeds are found in ignorance, passion, and local jealousies ; 
and if these are nursed in the school-room, sooner or later dissensions will 
make divisions, until real or imaginary hostile interests.will create petty 
powers, whose laws will rest upon standing armies. 
Local self-government, with federal unity, is the highest estate known to 
civil polity; but local self-government depending upon and sustained by 
armed soldiers, is the reward of jealousies, and the beginning of oppression. 
That forty independent States would soon become hostile, needs no proof 
except the condition of Europe. All Europe—nation against nation— 
armed to the teeth, with public debts daily increasing, shows the normal 
condition of proximate States with sovereign powers; while we see the great 
American Nation, with more than forty States, separated by marked trees 
instead of standing armies, and all dependent for peace with each other on 
a common paternity and a love of country; and for peace with the balance 
of the world on the known mightiness of our unity—many as the waves, 
but one as the sea.” Love of country, like the love of home, is a part of 
our nature, and we are so constituted that, until some evil spirit estranges 
us, though death’s door may be opening wide, we plant trees and build 
castles for those who are to come after us; but above all, in the discharge 
of duties impelled by an unseen power, does it become a people to whom 
freedom was bequeathed to transmit it to posterity without the slightest 
taint of discredit; and to do this is man’s inborn religion, until an evil spirit 
comes with the charms of dissension, and with fervid falsity presents to us 
 
-P-A-G-E-328
  828 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
the glories of a great central power or the freedom of independent States — 
either of which would be the demon’s work. 
The school-teacher is charged with immeasurable responsibility. If the 
coming generations shall make up an issue on false theories; if centraliza- 
tion or the right of secession shall become a mania of the people in either 
section; if the spirit of ambition or the pride of section shall set up a new 
idol, a new theory of government, and, following the teachings of sectional 
dislikes, or even of impulse, casting aside the solemn testament of the fathers 
and its construction by the tribunal which those fathers made to construe 
it—then all is lost. The school-house as a place of training for the coming 
generations, is the hope of the true patriot as he takes his departure; the 
school-teacher is his hope. The school-teacher is not usually a politician; 
he is not ambitious of political honors; he is not observant of political 
wind-currents, but only of law-and-order doctrines; and hence he can be 
trusted with our youth. 
What shall the coming generations be taught? Not, what doctrines strife 
has begotten, but: What is the great chart? what did the men who made 
it mean? what did they say? They were the noblest and grandest body 
of school-teachers that ever assembled on this earth. What did they teach? 
Did they put it in writing? Is it plain? Is it in my own tongue? AmI 
scholar enough to read it? Am I philosopher enough to do it justice? Am 
I patriot enough to stand by it, fearing no man? Then through the school- 
house there opens to the vision of the patriots of this day, as did to Wash- 
ington, Hamilton, Jefferson, Madison, Franklin, Roger Sherman, and their 
fellow-patriots, whose last look was fixed upon the future, a country where 
man is to have all the blessings of civil and religious liberty intended by 
the great Creator for him in his highest estate. 
THE TEACHING OF PATRIOTISM IN THE PUBLIC 
SCHOOLS AND EVERYWHERE. 
  
GEO. W. F. PRICE, NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE. 
[Dr. Price kindly consented, at the urgent request of President Marble, preferred at a late hour, to fill the vacancy caused by the unavoidable absence of Professor R. W. Webb, of Bellbuckle, Tennessee. Following is the stenographer’s report: ] 
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: Patriotism is the only national 
sentiment that may be and should become universal. Not every citizen of 
the State may be learned, not every citizen may be intelligent, not every 
citizen may be virtuous, but every citizen may be, every citizen should be, 
patriotic. 
Patriotism, as you have heard here to-night, is an extensive subject. It
-P-A-G-E-329
  EDUCATION AND THE REPUBLIC. 329 
  
is not dependent upon lines of latitude or longitude; it is not a question of 
soil or climatic condition. Whether the land be bleak or verdant, whether 
it be snow-clad or green with verdure, patriotism should be found every- 
where. Whether it be genial or hospitable, it matters not; let it be but 
the spot on which the man first saw light of day, the spot on which he first 
drew the vital breath of heavenly air, the spot upon which his ear was first 
saluted with familiar sounds of human speech, and then the sight and the 
name shall awaken in his heart a thrill of patriotic fervor. 
Patriotism is the prime safeguard and virtue of the state. Without it 
the native selfishness of man would assert itself, and the state might suffer 
the direst calamities. 
Patriotism is that which stands as a watchful guardian at the very out- 
posts of human organizations. Were it not for the quick thrill that courses 
through the fibers of the system upon the slightest injury done to the nervous 
structure, there might be destruction of the body. 
The right patriotic sentiment makes each one feel that an injury done to 
the state is an outrage heaped upon his own devoted head. 
Patriotism is the fairest representation of that one common sentiment that 
binds the whole nation together. Let but one speak in scorn of man’s native 
land, let a man but point the finger of contempt at the state of his love, and 
there rises in the patriot that thrill of passionate sentiment against which 
the traitor cannot survive. 
Patriotism is that best exponent of solid unity which binds the whole race 
together. Man as the individual is always seeking to lift himself up into a 
realm of universal humanity; but, as we all know, a man confined to the 
narrow realm of the sentiment of his heart, would grow intensely sordid, in- 
tensely selfish. It is the order of Divine Providence to widen that spiritual 
energy which is an element of patriotism, causing it to grow stronger and 
stronger, broadening its sweep and ennobling its range. 
Patriotism is the religion of the soul. It binds the heart of man to his 
native land, as the higher religious sentiment binds him to the heaven of his 
hope. As religion sets up a shrine of worship, so the patriot enshrines in 
his heart the worship of his beloved country, and there burns in him a true 
devotion to the object of his undying affection. But while this sentiment of 
patriotism is thus instinctive, does it therefore follow that it should be left 
to the blind impulses of its instinctive nature? 
Our observation tells us that childhood is the purest sincerity; but we all 
agree that it requires the wisest supervision, the most perfect discipline to 
develop those excellent early qualities into the maturer life of manhood. 
How has it come to pass, then, that it has been taken for granted that this 
elevating and ennobling sentiment, patriotism, needs but to be left to the 
blind impulses of instinctive nature? How comes it, that in a scheme of 
education, so-called philosophic and complete, there is no well-defined plan 
for the culture of this patriotic sentiment, concerning which previous speak-
-P-A-G-E-330
  330 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  
ers have spoken with such admirable pertinency and eloquence? I do not 
* mean to say that nothing has been done in this direction, for I am aware 
that men have worked for years in this neglected field. But I am here this 
evening, for a few moments, to direct attention to the important function 
that is to be performed in this neglected field, by the wide and extending 
system of public schools in the United States. 
The common schools of this country are truly American. However skill- 
ful, however malignant, may be the assaults upon the system, the fact re- 
mains incontestable that the American idea of the school-house under the 
control of the American commonwealth has steadily proceeded in its on- 
ward march from state to state, from city to city, and from hamlet to ham- 
let, widening its sweep and bearing down before it all opposition, however 
strenuous; resisting every assault, however hostile. A people of different 
nationalities have differed in religious dogmas; they differ in political 
creeds, they differ in geographical location, but the common heart of the 
common people rallies to the support of the common school of America. 
Here then is an enginery completely organized, wisely economic, prudently 
aggressive, and yet conservative; it is plastic to the touch of patriotic influ- 
ence, and can easily be moulded and shaped into a spirit of patriotic senti- 
ment. Here, is a system presented ready-made to our hands, by which the 
children of the State shall be brought to an acquaintance with the principles 
of patriotism which ought to animate every American heart. 
First of all, I should say that the very basis of patriotic instruction should 
be laid in the study of the primary geography of our country. Let the 
children learn from the earliest moment that they have a country always 
worthy of their honor and their love. We are not here to contend to the 
fullest extent for the highest spiritual and intellectual development of the 
people; that depends upon their environment. Yet we are not to ignore, 
under our system of education, the important influence of local and mate- 
rial surroundings. y 
Therefore let our children be instructed from their earliest years con- 
cerning their divine right. Let them be told freely and daily in the 
school-room of the wonders of their inheritance. The imagination of early 
childhood is a very quickening faculty, and children may early be taught 
to realize and appreciate the wonderful extent of their native country, the 
salient features of its glory. They may learn of the climate, the glory of 
its mountains, the sweep of its mighty rivers, the solemn majesty of its 
cataracts, the beauty of its boundless prairies, the splendor of its homes, 
and the wealth of its hills whose rocks aré filled with silver and gold. Tell 
the children in the school-room that no man need sail alien seas, clamber 
up distant mountain-heights, or traverse remote lands to find the grandest 
and fairest scenery that can elevate and satisfy the soul of man. No teacher 
here is poor in this theme of patriotic instruction, who from the fair slopes 
of the Pacific has climbed up any of those sublime western heights, looked

into vast depths, passed in rapt amazement through the royal gorge of the 
Grand Cafion of the Arkansas, or who from the sunny peak of Pike’s sum- 
mit has seen the sun kiss the forehead of the continent, as he draws about 
him the crimson draperies of his evening couch. What teacher from the 
Great Lakes has not brought with him the thrill of the story of natural 
wonders which must fire the youthful breast? Teachers coming from my 
own native State bring with them the story of the magnolia and the orange. 
They come from a land where the mécking-bird trills his lay with unre- 
mitted melody. From the great West comes the teacher with the story of 
the wonderful fertility of our native soil, and of the unbounded fields of _ 
corn waving golden to the day. 
I shall not attempt to show how fruitful is the theme of teaching patriotic 
lessons to our children, in many other directions. That would be to trespass 
upon what has already been so well and ably discussed. I shall not stop to 
remind you how this country was hallowed by the touch of the foot of Co- 
lumbus, who when he came upon the soil named it “San Salvador;” or how 
those early pioneers blessed the Western World with the central thought of 
our holy Christianity. I shall pass by divers other matters that have been 
here so ably discussed. I shall not allude to the revolutionary struggle into 
which in our infancy we were thrown with that great empire, with its mighty 
equipments and disciplined armies, supported with all the prestige of its 
military achievements, when under the blue skies of our liberty-loving land 
they came to make these American colonies subjects of Great Britain. A 
great man pronounced a grand eulogy when he said. that for solidity of 
reasoning, for force of conviction in the right, for wisdom conclusion 
amidst overwhelming difficulties, no nation, no people deserve to be placed 
above the Congress that assembled in Philadelphia. Nor need I especially 
refer to the time when the British army had the pleasure of laying down 
their arms and colors at Yorktown. 
In connection with these patriotic studies in history, let teachers do as 
they are now doing in many of our best schools in observing these memorial 
days, in which the lives of the illustrious men and women of this nation are 
brought forth before the children, with every stimulus of patriotic impulse 
that is associated with their memory. 
Let patriotic song and music thrill the hearts of the children. Let the 
flag of the country be wound about every pillar and every part of the 
building of the school-house. Let every relic that can be sought in the 
neighborhood be revived. Let ancient customs be brought forth, and let 
song and story of early patriots thrill again the hearts of American chil- 
dren.. All this will inspire the hearts of the children with such an impulse 
as never, never shall cease to animate them with true patriotic fervor. 
It has been suggested here, and admirably too, that in some of the 
advanced classes children may be taught the immense superiority of our 
American institutions, our free republican principles, and I am sure that

the young man or young woman who in the school-room has been taught 
to trace through ages of conflict the evolution of our constitutional liberties, 
and who looks abroad over the whole world and sees how our democratic 
institutions are now revolutionizing all the empires and advancing all the 
civilization of the globe—that these young men and these young women 
will come to feel the fire of patriotism with a renewed love of their native 
land. 
Our school-rooms are now filled with readers which should afford the 
largest possible means of patriotic stimulus to the child. I need. but to 
allude to it, because the teachers before me are already devoted to this 
work, 
Give to the hearts of the children those splendid lessons which you find 
in your books. Talk the American flag, teach to the children—*“AII thy 
hues are born of heaven;” “Forever float that standard sheet.” See and 
make the child feel the force of those words —“ With freedom’s soil beneath 
our feet, and freedom’s banner streaming o’er us.” 
Take other grand stanzas; one of those immortal songs, written in lines 
not born to die: 
“Strike till the last armed foe expires, 
Strike for your-altars and your fires, 
Strike for the green graves of your sires — 
God, and your native land.” 
Tell the child how that song was written amidst the belching of cannon 
and ee of arms. 
Teach them our own grand patriotic air, “The Star-Spangled Banner,” 
and when you conclude it, the heart of every child will say, with a profound 
amen— 
“Long may it wave, 
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave.” 
Tell the children how the Old Continentals, stood in their “ragged regi- 
mentals,” yielding not 
“When the grenadiers were raging 
And the shot like hail were plunging;” 
tell them how they stood face to face with such overwhelming odds with 
victory nearly wrested from their grasp. 
I tell you that if you fire the hearts of the children with these patriotic 
sentiments every man will be brought to feel as I did, when, on that memo- 
rable Fourth of July in 1876, amidst the Centennial visitors in Philadelphia, 
I stood in one of the most crowded thoroughfares of that great city. As the 
long lines of citizen soldiery came marching down the street lined with its 
multitude of patriots delirious with enthusiasm, and as the captains flashed 
their swords in the sunlight, and as the tramping of the army caused the 
very earth to tremble beneath our feet, as gaily caparisoned horses danced 
and pranced amidst the booming of cannon and the glory of the music, it

seemed that every hair of the head stood straight up like a liberty-pole 
from which was floating the Star-Spangled Banner. And in that hour of 
patriotic fervor every man of us realized that we had a country, a grand 
country, a glorious country, bounded on the east by the rising sun, on the 
west by the evening star, on the north by the aurora borealis, and on the 
south by manifest destiny; to become, under the hand of God, the greatest 
nation on the globe. 
HISTORY A PATRIOTIC FORCE IN THE SCHOOLS. 
HENRY B. CARRINGTON, HYDE PARK, MASSACHUSETTS. 
The American Educational Association will soon return its thousands of 
earnest workers to the white harvest-field. The year is already memorable. 
During the month of April more than one million of our citizens attended 
the centennial anniversary of the inauguration of George Washington as 
the first President of the United States of America. Three times that num- 
ber, within sound of saluting cannon, united in a jubilee of thanksgiving, 
without an unpleasant incident to mar the completeness of the event. The 
bells of tower and steeple throughout the land chimed with the voices of 
children of every section, as they sang of “America, Sweet Land of Liberty.” 
The closing hour of this twenty-ninth annual meeting has been devoted 
to the consideration of “History as a Patriotic Force in the Schools.” No 
theme could more fitly ally your deliberations with the ceremonies of that 
centennial jubilee. The memorial human experience which we call history 
never before concentrated the admiring gaze of all mankind upon the char- 
acter and acts of one mere man. Never before did the voice of a people’s 
chief magistrate summon men of all nationalities and races to prayer and 
praise. To Him with whom “one day is as a thousand years and a thou- 
sand years as one day,” the Hebrew, the Christian, and all who are do- 
mesticated with us through adoption, were called to pay homage.* That 
“unit element” of human history by which every man is related to every 
other man, and all men feed upon transmitted mercies, never before had 
illustration so impressive. The celebration of the 30th of April pierced 
the shadows of many centuries. Behind American independence there 
gleamed the bright effects of Magna Charta. From the culmination of 
the liberties which the day honored we step into the inviting future with 
elastic tread. 
It is the province of such memorial occasions to so irradiate the past that. 
we share with the Infinite in the fruitage of the ages, and count six thou- 
sand years of visible human activity as a direct contribution to our own 
* President Benjamin Harrison’s proclamation.

advancement. It is in the grasp of such representative events that we 
learn to measure the value of the past. They are not frequent, nor many. 
The few which stand as exponent factors in any nation’s history are hardly 
more than the decisive events of any single life. And yet nations advance 
in proportion as they reject all trivial influences and cherish only those 
which are essential, coherent, and permanent. 
All relative distinctions, such as “modern” and “ancient,” lose signifi- 
cance as we study events which span one or more centuries, and we humble 
self before the grand march of man toward an assured and dawning frater- 
nity. To scout the ancient and glorify the modern only, is unjust to history. 
It belittles our race as truly as do they who build our growth from germ or 
protoplasm. No man liveth for himself! No nation ever wrought for and 
upon itself alone! As a statue is without emotion, and a model has value 
only as a stimulus to improvement, so a well-developed man is but an im- 
proved specimen animal, except as he shall bless others. As a fact, we are 
never satisfied that any specialist has compassed life’s full opportunity, 
unless his example shall have shaped social life and social growth. Self- 
isolation, however active, is but the instinctive activity of the brute. It is 
incapable of a generous outflow. It is ignorant of the first principles which 
belong to love for man, and love of country. Individual history has a 
grander office than to distinguish the individual alone, or even a nation. It 
must enter into general history, which is the embracive personal factor of 
all human experience, and thus by encouraging example or by instructive 
warning, shape national life. It is well for our finite limitations that there 
are found along the historic highway such monumental lives, dynasties, and 
peoples, to rise above the common plane. They free us from that bewilder- 
ment which would follow dependence upon the environing details which ab- 
. solutely stultify a purely selfish life. 
But how shall we present to youth, as an object lesson, the chief facts that 
blend the historic past with the present, without a tiresome array of names 
and dates? 
Drop names and dates for a moment; drop those vague terms, “ancient”’ 
and “modern,” which are as confused as are our conceptions of a golden 
age, or an iron age. Grasp at once the significance of the term, “patriotic 
force”! t 
All patriotic force which properly shapes youth for good citizenship is by 
its very term, as well as essence, “filial.” The “pater” which is to evoke 
the sentiment called patriotism is not restricted by family, town, State, or 
national limits. The sentiment itself is one with that ultimate devotion, 
harmony and fraternity which shall have fruition in the “neighborhood 
of man.” Patriotism is a misnomer for anything less broad and humane; 
anything less than this is on the level of instinct, and not in harmony with 
the spirit of life once breathed into man by the Father of all life. 
Substitute for the terms “ancient” and “modern,” the first four ‘letters

of the Roman alphabet, as familiar to every child. Consider A. D. as em- 
bracive of B.C. Suggestions and relations crowd the mind. Hebrew and 
Christian exchange confidences. The whole history of man takes shape 
and purpose. Great characters, great dynasties, great conflicts, and even 
great mountains, rivers, and cities, have sympathetic relations, which de- 
velop through the experiences of to-day the unfolding of their true purpose. 
Memorials of Greece and Rome occupy a subordinate place. Did Demos- 
thenes inspire Greece to dare all in war with Philip? But the Hebrew 
Paul, unfolding human history before the High Court of the Areopagus, 
sounded a call to filial duty which stimulates the holiest and loftiest ambi- 
tion to-day. What if the records of Assyria, Egypt and Babylon be few, 
and ruins alone survive to supplement the Bible narrative of their career? 
What though tradition and myth veil facts? Every life has indistinct 
memories and immaterial details. To forever carry the memory of all de- 
tails and of all mistakes, would be fatal to peace or hope. The world would 
become a madhouse, with the entire race as inmates. 
It is not all of history that is of practical use; but so far as it is a fair, 
reflex of human obligation, faithfully met, there is no sound method by 
which to measure and utilize its value, unless we regard the period since the 
birth of Christ (A. D.) as the sequence and fruition of the period B. C. 
Neither can we treat history merely through race distinctions, regardless of 
moral relations and moral forces. Whatever detaches any race from human- 
ity, as a whole, is false’to history as the record of human experience. All 
races wrought on the highway down the centuries. We cannot even efface or 
ignore the periods of oppression which marked crises or dynasties. Beneath 
all such manifestations there were live embers, banked fires, only waiting 
for some vent into a kindling atmosphere to blaze for human liberty. All 
force is arbitrary, and the use determines its character. Peace must be 
arbitrary if it would be supreme. Even love, which is perfected only 
through peace, and love of country, which has perfection only through a 
patriotism as broad as the race, must be resistless to be complete. All his- 
tory becomes logical and consistent when the two periods are combined in 
the interest of man, as man. 
How then can we interest youth that they will study history as a joy, and 
not by the measured distances of a compulsory journey? Scientists tire the 
brain by searching the perspective, backward, for answer to the question, 
“Whence am I?” If they will substitute the inquiry, “ What am I?” they 
will trace lineaments which carry them back through a positive record of 
progress and improvement without the slightest trace of baboon or gorilla 
asa recognized ancestor. We know this grand fact, that there have been no 
types of our race out from which theré have not been developed by moral 
forces and the later Christian civilization, some who have been our peers 
in all that makes man lovely. Let the youth of our land understand that 
such deliverances of the abject and degraded not only unify history, but
-P-A-G-E-336

honor man as its subject! The possibilities enlarge, as instances multiply. 
Minor details are merged in the full contour. It is ever thus with colossal 
lives and eventful periods. No one pauses to ask if Demosthenes and Web- 
ster flew kites and played marbles. We do not doubt it; but it is the im- 
press of final attainment which abides. Details have been lost in character. 
That word “character,” or engraved mark, answers all inquiry. 
Some methods of teaching history bury principles under details, and mag- 
nify only defects and blots. And yet, the reference of all distinctive per- 
sonal and national struggles to the two cardinal periods of human experience 
indicated, will harmonize all essential facts of that experience. The aggre- 
gate of lives is but the multiplication of units, and the conflicts of all the 
centuries have been towards fraternity and right. 
But have there not been dark ages? Yes, conditionally, so called; as 
there are spots on the sun and dark blemishes on every merely human his- 
torical character. Whenever sensual tastes controlled they shaped art, 
architecture, customs, government, and lives. Nations sank into the idiocy 
which has overtaken individuals within our own recollection, and the sui- 
cide of the many was only more conspicuous than that of one. 
The history of man ever exhibits two energizing elements, each a com- 
pound. One is brain and muscle; the other is brain spiritually enthused, 
or conscience and muscle. History cannot be explained or best utilized 
unless we relate all human experience to a common standard, which accepts 
the presence and power of these compound elements, and then it becomes 
clear, wholesome, and attractive. To accumulate names, dates, and figures, 
without this comparative basis for their adjustment, is to confound all right 
ideas of human duty and human destiny. ‘ 
The period B.C. had its order, its type, and its promise. The period 
A.D. has in charge the development of the former. Thus allied, progress 
appears to have been constant, and patriarchs appear as our personal pro- 
genitors. It is not a merely speculative suggestion that history becomes 
symmetrical only when thus appreciated and taught. The faithful work 
done for family or country, in any age, survives to inspire us, and life is 
quickened by the consciousness that we reap the harvest of nearly sixty 
centuries of human endeavor. 
But can this philosophy be given practical shape for school use? Surely 
there has never been a better time than the present to interest youth in the 
relations of America to all other countries and to study their antecedent 
history. You can almost lift any foreign land to the teacher’s table for 
dissection. No nation is distant now! There are almost no dead nations! 
Our embassadors and consular agents are everywhere! The earth surren- 
ders her buried treasures and secrets of the remote past, and the funeral 
wrappings of the early Pharaohs are deciphered in explanation of the re- 
motest struggles for liberty and country. Newspapers are no longer local. 
It is the revolving earth rather than the revolving cylinder that stamps the

morning and evening “Extra.” Asiatics tread your streets, and by their 
absorption into citizenship make their history personal to us. The wild 
beasts of Africa and Asia have been brought to our shores in herds, and 
* though soon to be, with the buffalo, as mythical as leviathan or behemoth, 
they bring their countries to our presence, annihilating distance and the 
very distinctions which barbarism had interposed for its protection from the 
stranger. All races, climates and products meet in one foreground, and we 
are compelled to discount the lapse of generations. We command all ages to 
surrender their records ! 
The fundamental fact of the period before Christ (B. C.) is, that the He- 
brew Commonwealth, through its simple constitution, becomes not only the 
basis of English and American common law, but has value throughout the 
civilized world. The fundamental fact of the second period (A. D.) stands 
in the date-heading of all social and business transactions, to fix the rela- 
tions of passing years. . 
Generalizations such as these must supplant details. As an illustration, 
it is to be noticed, that the centennial celebrations of 1876 to 1884 almost 
shut out the record of the principles upon which our independence was 
based, to give localities special honor. But the constitutional memorial of 
1887, and that of April last, took up the whole century at once, and so in- 
spired a patriotic purpose, non-sectional, universal, and intense. 
This generalization has still a broader scope. Geography will more and 
more furnish the objectives of historical instruction. Our explorers are al- 
ready by that river Euphrates which floats the history of the mightiest 
‘empires of the period B.C. The rivers Tiber, Volga, Rhine, Danube, 
Thames, Clyde, and Dee, reflect the experiences of states and peoples for 
more than twenty centuries. The St. Lawrence, Hudson, Delaware, St. 
John’s, and Mississippi, memorialize the work of French, English, Dutch, 
Swede, Portuguese, and Spaniard. All these, whether Puritan, Huguenot, 
Catholic, Cavalier, or Roundhead, have become a part of ourselves, and 
their ancestral records inter-page with our own. And what does it mean 
that more than two thousand counties, cities, towns, streets, and monumental 
buildings bear the names of La Fayette, De Kalb, Kosciusko, Pulaski, and 
others, who, despairing of liberty at home, fought with and for us, unless 
that America might become at once the beacon and asylum for all oppressed 
peoples, the typical center of a patriotism as comprehensive as the word 
itself? 
Neither does this grasp of man, as man, lessen the value of birthplace or 
home ties. It does not pervert or weaken the right appreciation by any 
American citizen of the home of his ancestors, but enhances that apprecia- 
tion by a wise estimate of the contending experiences out of which present 
mercies have developed. It has that quality of quicksilver which separates 
gold and silver from the ore, a true amalgam or “softener,” without blend- 
ing or even combining elements which by nature and choice have their dis-

tinctive exercise: as religion itself, which affects the moral springs of action, 
leaves characteristics unchanged, although energized by purer motive. It 
does, indeed, make of Englishmen, Irishmen, Germans, and other in-comers, 
more distinctive Americans without discredit to their family Penates. Herein * 
lies the solution of our most difficult problem. In no age, and nowhere on 
earth before, has there been such a test of the patriotic force which history 
applies, as with us, to-day. It is the bright, the elastic and the mighty 
South which is destined to crown all its trials and its triumphs by a still 
grander deliverance and triumph. A race to the manor born, with no other 
fatherland, religious, musical, domestic, home-loving and social by nature, 
faithful in service and generous in habit, is to be adjusted to conditions which 
immigrating peoples claim through domicile with us. Is not this African- 
American element to be the reserve force by which to neutralize and over- 
come the socialistic, communistic and nihilistic dangers which accompany 
foreign immigration? Here is a native-American element, with numbers 
and capacities that can have employment in our national expansion without 
impairment of any social relation or domestic comfort. The South, through 
its aid, can utilize its vast resources and develop its marvelous industries 
with far less friction than where, as at the North, foreign obligations, preju- 
dices and languages postpone for a generation the best use of incoming 
workers. The history of God’s providence shapes the obligation. Trust it! 
Let us not try, by a tip-toe reach, to manipulate the methods of His council 
chamber! Let us accept and meet duty, and He will guide us, as He did 
our fathers in the long ago. 
Isolation does not inspire true patriotism. When earthquake, fire, pesti- 
lence or flood so fuse sixty millions of hearts that every home in the land 
_ quivers with a boundless charity, we begin to learn how the conditions which 
evoke war draw to their end; and thus the loftiest patriotism acquires en- 
during force; the multiplication of such sympathies disarms antagonisms; 
jealousies fade out; and hostilities are repugnant to hearts which have over- 
flowed with fervid sympathy and practical charity. 
And this Association, already coéxtensive with our vast domain, will soon 
be moulding the youth of one hundred millions of American citizens. It 
is a grand thing to live and labor in and for the land of Washington; but 
it is not from his exceptional life alone, nor even from the marvelous record 
of our national experience, that history is to be invoked in behalf of the 
young, and its patriotic force applied to shape their destiny. The grandest 
incentives are by reviews of God’s dealings with ald nations, while cherish- 
ing with jealous care his special favors to us as a people. We absorb life 
from all nations. Therefore, make monumental his special dealings with 
those whose sons we adopt. Be patriotic in the filial spirit which embraces 
the brotherhood of man! Rise from minor surface details into the atmos- 
phere of the over-arching heavens, which is common to all climes and times. 
In a few years the school curriculum will have no space for the swiftly

accumulating details of local history. Generalization will become more 
and more vital to sound teaching. Leading events must ever hold their 
place. But in proportion as intimacy with other nations shall blend their. 
interests with our own, and our language, already the commercial language 
. of the world, shall enlarge the responsibilities and the force of our example, 
so shall reverence, loyalty and fraternity first crystallize and then illuminate 
the vast array of minor facts until the resplendent whole shall indeed en- 
lighten the earth. Then shall Victor Hugo’s picture of the United States 
of Europe be enlarged to the grander conception of the departed Woolsey,* 
and the United States of the World be the culmination of the United States 
of America. 
So shall it be that you will need no monumental shaft to do honor to the 
American Association of Teachers; but the beneficence of your mission and 
the grace of your example shall be honored through those whom you pre- 
pare for responsible citizenship. Then, indeed, shall history have been 
wisely impressed as a “Patriotic Force,” and have its desired fruition in a 
Perfected Liberty, a Glorified Country, and Emancipated Man. 
EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS IN THE SOUTH SINCE 1865, 
W. A. CANDLER, OXFORD, GEORGIA. 
The design of the topic assigned to this hour will be best accomplished if 
the word “South” is restricted to its popular meaning, rather than employed 
as is usual in the political classification of the Southern States. It will 
therefore be understood in this discussion as including Virginia, North Car- 
olina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, 
Mississippi, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas. With reference to the edu- 
cational and social conditions which are peculiar to the South, Delaware, 
Maryland, West Virginia and Missouri are not to be considered as Southern 
States. 
I. In estimating the work of education in these States, there are some facts 
of a general character which must be taken into the account if we wish to 
arrive at just conclusions. 
(a) Density or sparseness of population affects educational work. A few 
people scattered over an extensive territory will require a greater outlay for 
the education of their children than would be necessary if they lived in com- 
pact bodies. Let it be remembered, then, that the twelve Southern States 
considered in this discussion have an area of about 800,000 square miles, 
inhabited by about 12,000,000 of people. On a territory of about 65,000   
*Ex-President Theodore Dwight Woolsey, of Yale College.

    340 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  
square miles, New England has a population of about, 4,000,000; that is to 
say, New England has a population of over sixty persons to the square mile, 
while the South has about fifteen people to the square mile. 
(0) Homogeneity or heterogeneity of population also affects school work. 
More than a third of the population of the South is of African descent — 
out of slavery less than thirty years. 
(e) An urban population is more favorably situated for educational work 
than a rural population. The population of the South is mainly in the 
country. 
(d) The number of children of school age, as compared with the entire 
population, must be taken into the account in making up judgment upon 
the educational work of any State or section. One man with ten children 
to educate comes to a task one hundred times more difficult than that which 
presents itself to ten men with one child each to educate. We must, there- 
fore, not overlook the fact that the South, in proportion to population, has 
many more children to educate than other sections. For example, let us 
compare Georgia and Massachusetts, which have something like equal pop- 
ulation. The population of Massachusetts exceeds that of Georgia by about 
250,000 souls; but the children of Georgia between the ages of 6 and 14 
years exceed the children of Massachusetts of the same age by about 90,000. 
If we reckon five persons to a family, we will find that in every Georgia 
family there is one child between the age of 6 and 14 years and 40,000 chil- 
dren left over, while in Massachusetts, by the same calculation, there are 
102,650 families with no children of this age at all.’* 
If we regard children as the heritage of the Lord, the South is exceed- 
ingly rich; if they be esteemed as arrows in the hand of a mighty man, 
the South is happy, having its quiver full of them. 
II. Besides these general statements, it is necessary in reckoning the edu- 
cational progress of the South since 1865 to consider briefly the state of 
education in this section before the war. 
(a) In 1860 there was not in the South any general or efficient common- 
school system. The subject had not been wholly overlooked or neglected 
by these States, but the “pauper school” idea which attached to such efforts 
as were made in this direction exhibited the meagerness of the provision, 
and insured its failure. 
(6) Schools for secondary instruction—academies and high schools— 
were numerous, and well sustained. In these much primary work was done, 
and many students prepared for college. 
(e) The colleges of the South were not so numerous nor so richly endowed 
as similar institutions North, but it may well be doubted if any section had, 
in proportion to its population, so many boys and girls at college. 
  
The comparison is not materially altered if it is made between the white children of Georgia and 
the white children of Massachusetts, or, as given above, the comparison being between the children of 
all races in each State between the ages of 6 and 14,

(d) The war was fought on Southern soil, and upon the South its des- 
olating effects fell almost undivided. At its close, in 1865, the resources of 
the Southern people were never so small, and their educational necessities 
never so great. Schools of every sort were disorganized, and children of 
school age were driven by poverty to the field, forced to work, when as 
never before they needed to be taught. Slaves, recently emancipated and 
become citizens, were without education, and without any decided sense of 
their need of it. The hearts of the strongest and best of the people failed 
them for fear. The case could hardly have been worse; but it was not hope- 
less. The difference between such a condition and the present state of things 
measures the educational progress of the South since 1865. 
III. (a) In nearly or quite all the State constitutions adopted during the 
reconstruction period, provisions for common schools were incorporated, and 
statutes were enacted to carry them into effect. Admirable machinery was 
planned, but for the most part the work stopped there. Meanwhile much 
was being done by the. Freedman’s Bureau and by the churches of the 
North for the education of the negro. 
(6) Not until about the year 1870—and even later in some of the States 
—was there any marked advance in the education of the masses. Since 
that time there has been slow but steady progress. It is estimated that since 
the war the twelve Southern States under consideration have expended 
$125,000,000 upon their public schools. When it is remembered that the 
State of New York alone has more taxable property (not counting its non- 
taxable bonds, of which there are almost none in the South) than all these 
twelve States together, this showing is not discreditable. 
(c) A larger per cent. of school funds in the South is paid for the run- 
ning expenses of the schools and less for school buildings than in other sec- 
tions of the country. Except in cities and towns, the public schools are 
conducted in neighborhood churches, or in buildings provided by the patrons 
of the school, at no expense to the State, and the value of which is not given 
in the reports of educational commissioners. 
(d) The school term in the South averages about toss days; while that 
of the whole country is about 125. Often private subscriptions continue the 
schools for a longer period than is provided for by the public funds, and it 
is worthy of mention that the negroes are very forward in this supplemental 
work. These statements apply to the rural districts. In cities and towns 
school systems are maintained by local taxation, and the schools continue 
eight or nine months in the year. Every day witnesses the establishment of 
more of these urban school systems. 
(e) While most of the taxes are paid by the white people, there is now no 
discrimination against the schools for the negroes in any of the Southern 
States. These twelve commonwealths have expended for the education of 
their colored population, first and last, nearly or quite forty millions of dol- 
lars, more than twice as much as has been expended from any and all other 
22—n. BE. A.

sources. The Southern negro needed much help, and he has not been denied 
it, and, in the main, he has used his opportunity well. 
(f) The investments for popular education in the South have not been 
in vain. Illiteracy is beginning to diminish. Between 1870 and 1880 it 
was reduced about 7 per cent. The census of 1890 will, doubtless, show a 
greater reduction. There is enough illiteracy to quicken zeal, if not pro- 
voke alarm, but it is comforting to know the case is not as bad as it has been. 
Moreover, illiteracy in the South, with its rural population, does not bring 
the perils to popular government which would arise if this illiteracy were 
heaped together in the neglected wards of great cities. 
(g) The most cheering fact of the educational situation in the South is 
the deepening interest of all the people in the subject. There is in it the 
promise and potency of a wide-spread and early reform. To this end the 
benevolences of George Peabody and John F. Slater have contributed not a 
little stimulation. But more than any outside influences, the educational 
revival springing up in the South is attributable to the conviction of her own 
people that the education of the masses is indispensable to good government 
and social order. If the public-school systems of the South were the result 
of outside agencies they would perish. But, resting on the convictions and 
affections of the Southern people, they have come to stay. 
(h) Schools for secondary education are not so numerous nor so well sus- 
tained as before the war. In ante-bellum times the educational work of the 
South moved from the college downward, and the high school did much 
primary work now done by the common school. Now the movement is from 
the common schools upward, and the distance between the public schools 
and the college is covered by the colleges doing sub-freshman work and the 
common schools doing high-school work. This is not the most satisfactory 
condition of things, however, and the old Southern academy is beginning to 
appear in many places. 
(i) The work of higher education is in better condition than before the - 
war, and is steadily improving. Few new colleges have been established 
since 1865: not many have been founded in any section of the country. 
The increase in schools of collegiate grade for the whole country since 1870 
has been less than a dozen, and the increase has been as great as was needed, 
We do not need more but better colleges in the United States. This it is 
manifest the South steadfastly believes. The increase of Southern collegiate 
institutions has been mainly confined to industrial and female schools, but 
the cause of higher education has not been allowed to decline. Dismantled 
institutions have been renovated, some ill-located schools removed to more 
eligible sites, and the names of some changed. A few have died. More 
would have died except the self-sacrificing faculties had made up for their 
lack of endowment with an opulence of self-denial which has never been 
surpassed in any age or clime. 
When General Lee surrendered, he said to one of his generals, “ Let us 
.
-P-A-G-E-343
  1 
EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS IN THE SOUTH. 343 
  
go home and cultivate our virtues.” He returned, and immediately set 
about the execution of the great purpose. Declining many offers of large 
salaries as president of money-making enterprises, he accepted the presidency 
of Washington College, and gave the balance of his life to the education of 
Southern youth. The inspiration of his example has been equal to large 
endowments in maintaining Southern colleges. Many less illustrious, but 
not less heroic, have toiled and suffered and died in the same great work. 
At the close of the year’s work for the year in which I was graduated, the 
president of my Alma Mater, a gentleman of ability and culture, at the head 
of one of the best-known colleges in the South, received less than $700 for 
his labor. His case was not exceptional, nor is the necessity for such self- 
denial entirely a thing of the past with many of the best colleges in the 
South. 
Without adequate endowments, the instructors in Southern colleges have 
not only kept them in existence, but have improved them. The colleges of 
these twelve States are doing thorough work. Though making brick without 
straw, their work is as solid and enduring as the Pyramids. 
The students in these institutions rarely have time or heart for boat- 
racing and other inter-collegiate sports, but they can hold a strong hand in 
any intellectual contest to which they are subjected. Many of them de- 
velop muscle by working in vacation for the money to meet the expenses 
of the next college term. Of the 230 students who have attended Emory 
College during the scholastic year just closed, above fifty, not counting the 
graduating class, are at work to-day while I speak to you. 
(j) Of the collegiate institutions of the South, as of the whole country, 
quite the largest number are church schools. Of the 365 colleges and uni- 
versities in the United States, 278 are denominational schools; of the 4,836 
instructors in these 365 schools, 3,509 are in church schools, and teach over 
50,000 of the 65,728 college students of the country. In the South, about 
the same proportion prevails. Religion in the United States is not afraid 
of science, and science would be sorely bereaved were the support of religion 
withdrawn. : 
(k) Almost all that has been done for the higher education of females 
and the negroes in the South has been done under the auspices of the 
church. It is true State appropriations have been made to these purposes, 
but the work has been done almost exclusively at denominational institu- 
tions. Nor is it unfortunate that such has been the case. The piety of the 
negro is the secret of his peaceable habits and orderly contentment; it is 
well that his education and his religious training should go hand in hand. 
Nor is the religious culture of the mothers of the country less necessary to 
the well-being of society. 
Altogether, the educational progress of the South since 1865 has been 
such as that for it she may thank God and take courage. She has some- 
times been berated for the slowness of her movements concerning these 
 
-P-A-G-E-344

great interests, and often justly so. But she is not so far behind the rest 
‘of the world as might be supposed. It is scarce a quarter of a century 
since England seriously undertook the education of the masses. Except- 
ing Germany and Switzerland, most European states are far behind the 
South.. Nevertheless, criticism has done her good; indeed she is one of 
the sections of our country which always hears what her critics say about 
her. She buys many books and papers from other sections, and sells few 
to them. Frequent criticism is a means of grace to her. “’Tis grace has 
brought her safe thus far.” 
Standing amid the inspiring scene of this centennial year of the consti- 
tution, with profound loyalty to the work of the fathers, and the tenderest 
love for the children who must make her future, recognizing with thanks- 
giving the helping hand of Almighty God, who has guided her out of the 
desolations of 1865 to the peace and plenty of 1889, she sings to-day with 
fervent heart: 
“Here I’ll raise my Ebenezer; 
Hither, by God’s help, I’ve come.”

  NATIONAL COUNCIL OF EDUCATION. 
CONSTITUTION. 
PREAMBLE. 
The National Council of Education shall have for its object the consideration 
and discussion of educational questions of general interest and public importance, 
and the presentation, through printed reports, of the substance of the discussions, 
and the conclusions formulated. It shall be its object to reach and’ disseminate 
correct thinking on educational questions; and, for this purpose, it shall be the 
aim of the Council, in conducting its discussions, to define and state with accuracy 
the different views and theories on the subject under consideration, and, secondly, 
to discover and represent fairly the grounds and reasons for each theory or view, so 
far as to show, as completely as possible, the genesis of opinion on the subject. It 
shall be the duty of the Council, in pursuance of this object, to encourage from all 
its members’the most careful statement of differences in opinion, together with the 
completest statement of grounds for the same. It shall further reqtire from the 
chairmen of its committees the careful preservation and presentation of the indi- 
vidual differences of opinion whenever grounds have been furnished for the same 
by members of their committees. It shall invite the freest discussion of the reports 
of its committees, and, whenever said reports are not so amended as to embody the 
new suggestions developed by such discussion, any member making such suggestion 
or objection may put in writing his view and the grounds therefor, and furnish the 
same to the Secretary for the records of the Council. It shall prepare, through its 
president, with the aid of the chairmen of the several committees, an annual report 
to the National Association, setting forth the questions considered by the Council 
during the previous year, and placing before the Association, in succinct form, the 
work accomplished. It shall embody in this report a survey of those educational 
topics which seem to call for any action on the part of the Association. The Coun- 
cil shall appoint, out of its own number, committees representing the several depart- 
ments of education, and thereby facilitate the exchange of opinion among its 
members on such special topics as demand the attention of the profession or of the 
public.

of 1841. He immediately began his life-work of teaching, and continued it 
without interruption in the same city forty-seven years, till a few weeks be- 
fore his death. He was for forty-three years one of the principals of the 
University Grammar School, which was in some sort the preparatory de- 
partment of Brown University. His entire life-work was to prepare boys 
for college. 
He was sincerely devoted to “sound learning.” He was several times 
offered professorships in different colleges, one in the University of Michi- 
gan, but he invariably declined these positions. In 1855 he occupied the 
chair of Greek in Brown University. In 1873 he traveled extensively in 
Great Britain and on the Continent, and was appointed “Honorary Com- 
missioner to the World’s Fair at Vienna.” He was always interested in 
whatever related to matters of education and the welfare of the city and 
State where he resided. He was a member of the common council of Prov- 
idence in 1855, and was chairman of the committee on education. For 
more than thirty years he was an active and efficient member of the school 
board of Providence, doing a great amount of gratuitous labor, and thereby 
meriting and receiving the esteem and gratitude of his fellow-citizens. He 
was president of the Rhode Island Institute of Instruction in 1873 and 
1874, and was president of the American Institute of Instruction in 1875 
and 1876. He was a member of the National Council of Education. For 
three years from 1874 he was a trustee of Brown University, and from 
1874 to his death he was a member of the Board of Fellows of this renowned 
institution of learning. “

During the whole of his active life he was prominent in the Baptist 
denomination. For thirty-three years he held the office of deacon. At the 
time of his death he was connected with the Union Baptist Church in 
Providence, and president of the society. 
He was married August 23, 1842, to Miss Caroline Brown, daughter of 
Dr. Nicholas Jenks, of Middleborough, Mass. She died a year before him, 
leaving two daughters. 
His death takes from us a staunch friend of “sound learning.” 
DR. ELE TT, ‘TAPPAN: 
  
\ 
JOHN HANCOCK. 
Since its last meeting this Council has lost one of its most valued and be- 
loved members, in the person of Eli T. Tappan, of Ohio, at the time of his 
death School Commissioner of that State. 
Eli Tod Tappan was born in Steubenville, Ohio, April 30, 1824. His 
father was Judge Benjamin Tappan, an active leader in the early anti- 
slavery movement, and long a conspicuous figure in Ohio politics, having 
_ finished his-career as a member of the United States Senate. 
Dr. Tappan’s elementary education was obtained in the schools of his 
native town, but his higher in St. Mary’s College, a Catholic institution lo- 
cated at Baltimore, Md. He left this school in 1842, and at once began 
the study of law in the office of his father and E. M. Stanton, the great war 
secretary of President Lincoln, who were partners. He did not begin prac- 
tice immediately after his admission to the bar, but for nearly three years 
conducted a weekly paper in Columbus, Ohio. In 1848 he began the prac- 
tice of his profession in Steubenville, in which practice he continued for 
nine years. He had those qualities of mind and that indefatigable industry 
which entitled him to look forward to an eminent success in the career he 
had entered upon; but his mind became powerfully attracted to the work 
of teaching as that in which, in his opinion, one could do most for the ele- 
vation of the race. For him, with his high conscientiousness, to reach this 
conclusion was to act upon it at once. 
He began what proved to be his life-work, in the schools of Steubenville, 
in 1857. In the fall of 1859 he was made Professor of Mathematics in Ohio 
University, at Athens. He remained in this position but a year, and then 
accepted a call to teach the same branches in a flourishing academy for 
young ladies near Cincinnati, where he remained five years. It was while 
he was in this school that he wrote his geometry and trigonometry for the 
Ray series of mathematical text-books. 
September, 1865, he was recalled to the chair of mathematics in Ohio 
University. In 1869 he was made president of Kenyon College, which
-P-A-G-E-364

office he continued to fill till 1875, at which date he resigned it to take the 
chair of mathematics and political economy in the same institution. This 
position he retained until his election to the office of State School Commis- 
sioner, in 1887. His college work covered a period of more than a quarter 
of a century. But though his professional work lay in the field of the 
higher education, his sympathies with the common-school work were earnest 
and active. From 1856 to the close of his life, he was scarcely absent from 
a meeting of the Ohio Teachers’ Association. He was also an active worker 
in teachers’ institutes and on boards of county examiners. In 1864 he was 
appointed by State Commissioner Dr. E. E. White a member of the first 
State Board of Examiners. 
Dr. Tappan was president of the Ohio Teachers’ Association in 1866, 
was treasurer of the National Educational Association in 1880 and 1881, 
and was elected its president in 1883: He was a member of this Council 
from the date of its organization to the time of his death. 
The honorary degree of Doctor of Laws was conferred on him by Will- 
iams College in 1873, and by Washington and Jefferson College in 1874. 
In 1886 he was elected an honorary member of the Association for the Im- 
provement of Geometrical. Teaching in England. 
The duties of State School Commissioner Dr. Tappan found exceedingly 
congenial to him. In the discharge of these duties he felt he had found a 
broader field for carrying forward the work to which he had devoted his 
life. He entered upon the labors of his new office with immense enthu- 
siasm; and it cannot be doubted that, had he lived, he would have made 
through it an honorable and enduring impress upon the school system of 
his State, ranking himself among the most memorable of its great educators. 
Dr. Tappan was married in 1851 to Lydia L., daughter of Alexander 
McDowell, of Steubenville; and by this union was set up a home in which 
always dwelt perfect trust and pure delights. 
His health for the last two years previous to his death had been some- 
what infirm, but his final illness was short. He died of brain paralysis, the 
result of heart disease, October 23, 1888. : 
Having thus briefly told what our departed friend did, the more difficult 
task remains to tell what he was. His was a reverent spirit. Religion was 
wrought into the very fiber of his being. He was for many years a de- 
voted member of the Episcopal church; but no one could be less a sectarian, 
‘or more broadly tolerant of the religious views of others. He was the soul 
of honorable dealing in every relation of life. He was not only upright, but 
was uprightness itself. 
The transparency of his character was such as is seldom seen; and that 
transparency revealed a soul of wonderful strength and purity. He was 
very frank of speech. He never left one in doubt for a moment as to what 
his meaning was. He always met the occasion with -perfect courage, and 
never lowered his eyes in the presence of any man. Yet there was no boister-
-P-A-G-E-365
  IN MEMORIAM. 365 
ousness of self-assertion about him. The gentle serenity of his manner was 
the unconscious outgrowth of a manliness without a flaw. 
He had no charity for evasions, or for those who were guilty of them. 
His reproof of his friends, when he thought their actions required reproof, 
was by no means abated because they stood to him in that relation. Though 
not unfrequently his words had a measure of severity in them, their recipients 
saw behind the words such a kindliness of heart, and such a yearning of 
true friendship, that it was not possible to take offense at the plainness of his 
speech. He was not demonstrative in the display of his feelings, but the 
glow on his cheek, and the moisture in his eye, when he listened to the narra- 
tion of some great deed, or the utterance of a noble thought, showed how 
deep and full the fountains of his sympathies were. He hated mean men; 
but his friendship for those he deemed worthy was strong and lasting. 
Self-seeking was entirely foreign to hisnature. He cared little for honors, 
but much that honorable things should be done. The keynote of his life 
seems to me to have been self-repression and self-abnegation. He controlled 
himself, and labored for others. He chose his vocation nobly, and nobly he 
wrought in it.

REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON STATE SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 
LICENSURE OF TEACHERS. 
[No report of the Committee on State School Systems being presented, the Council voted to discuss 
the “Licensure of Teachers.”] 
DISCUSSION. 
[ReporTeD By N, C. DougHERTY.] 
Mr. Waite thought that in the discussion the licensure of the teacher 
should be separated from the appointment of the teacher. The most prom- 
ising progress in the licensure of teachers is in these directions: 
1. In regard to life certificates: these certificates should be held by a 
larger number than at present. There is in the great body of teachers in 
each State a growing number who are known and recognized throughout 
the State for their scholarship, their skill in teaching, and their high char- 
acter. These teachers should be exempt from reéxamination. They should 
hold life certificates, and these certificates should be recognized by the 
licensing power in other States. ‘ 
2. The giving of more importance to professional attainments in the reéx- 
amination of teachers not holding life certificates. The first examinations 
should be thorough tests of the scholarship of the applicant. This being 
settled, chief attention should be given to professional attainments. 
3. The putting of the granting of licenses or certificates in the hands of 
the members of the profession of teaching. The progress in this direction 
is one of the most healthful signs of improvement in educational matters. 
In other professions the examiners of applicants are always members in good 
standing. The same should be true of the profession of teaching. 
Mr. Mowry felt that all would agree with what Dr. White had said, with 
this exception, that no one rule could be framed which would apply to all 
the States. That which was best for Ohio and Illinois might not be the 
best for Mississippi. The great body of teachers would at least for years to 
come differ in scholarship and professional ability in different localities. 
The element of expediency must enter into the licensing of teachers. But 
with the growth in numbers of professional teachers, uniformity in licensing 
should be pushed. In Boston, when a teacher has passed his examination 
he may be appointed temporarily. The appointment is for the year, and 
he is on trial. Should his work be successful for four years, and the com- 
mittee which has charge of his class recommend it, he receives a permanent 
appointment. He needs but the one examination so long as he teaches in 
that class.
-P-A-G-E-367
  LICENSURE OF TEACHERS. 367 
  
Mr. Hewett, of Illinois, said: There is one great difficulty pertaining to 
all attempts looking towards strengthening the professional character of the 
teacher’s business. So large a proportion of those who are teaching remain 
in the business only a brief time, and intend to remain only a brief time, 
that it seems impossible ever to make teaching a profession in the same 
sense as law and medicine. And yet something, a great deal, has been done 
in this direction; much more may be done, and it seems to me that Mr. White 
has indicated the lines along which to work. I think that by-and-by all 
those who desire to make teaching a profession can have the privileges and 
standing that belong to members of professions. 
In Illinois there are three ways of obtaining certificates for teachers. For 
several years we have had a law authorizing State certificates, good for life. 
About 500 such certificates have been issued. The examinations are made 
by the State Superintendent, with the aid and advice of the presidents of 
normal schools and the State University. The examinations are held at 
the same time, in different parts of the State, under charge of persons ap- 
pointed by the State Superintendent, using uniform questions furnished by 
the State Department. All the papers are submitted to the same board of 
examiners, who do not know the names of the writers until the papers are 
marked and the report made to the Superintendent. By a law passed last 
winter the State will also grant certificates good for five years. Graduates 
of the normal schools are entitled to receive these certificates without ex- 
amination. Some of the larger cities, working under special charters, license 
their own teachers. 
By far the largest number of licenses are granted by the county superin- 
tendents. The office is political; incumbents are elected by the voters of 
the county. No special qualification is required. Many of them are excel- 
lent officers; but this is not true of all, although, I think, there is a general 
improvement. 
Mr. Coy, of Cincinnati, said: One point referred to incidentally by Dr. 
White, seems to me of sufficient importance to be given additional em- 
phasis—I mean the recognition by the authorities of a county or State of 
the validity of certificates granted by other counties and States. As matters 
now stand, if a man with twenty years’ successful experience in teaching, 
in‘Illinois or Indiana for instance, should go to Ohio, he could not receive 
pay as a teacher there until he had submitted to an examination by the au- 
thorities of the latter State; and the same is true in respect to different 
counties in the same State. It seems to me that there is such a thing as a 
persecution of teachers by means of examinations. I know of no good rea- 
son why teachers should be examined at every turn any more than physi- 
cians and lawyers, who, I believe, are pretty generally allowed to practice 
their profession in any State after having been admitted to practice in one. 
Mr. Auuyy, of Illinois, said: I think this Council ought to be ready to 
make “a deliverance” on one point, sure—that all licenses to teach ought 
 
-P-A-G-E-368
368 NATIONAL COUNCIL OF EDUCATION. 
  
to be given. by the profession. Teachers themselves ought to open the 
door into the honors of their own body, as do lawyers, ministers, physi- 
cians. Then difficulties may begin in regard to the many who do not in- 
tend to teach longer than one or two years, or in regard to localities which 
cannot pay for permanent teachers, But these.can be overcome by patient 
study. Another point I think we ought to settle, as a matter on which we 
as a Council of Education are agreed, that the examination of teachers and 
their licenses should be uniform throughout the State. Let the State su- 
perintendent prepare these, and require the county superintendents to use 
them. The persons who are licensed by life certificates might be the body 
to select examiners, and to report the names of the successful candidates. 
Mr. GREENWOOD, of Kansas City, said: There are so many contingencies 
upon which this question depends, that it is impossible to place it in a clear 
light before the Council. Instead of one central head to the educational 
system of this country, there are as many different systems as there are sov- 
ereign States. Education, then, belongs primarily to the States. This fact 
is fundamental under our form of government. In Germany, France, and 
other European countries, there is a Minister of Education. His influence 
reaches down through all departments. In such countries persons are cer- 
tificated to teach because they have passed through a prescribed course of 
instruction. But in America few persons, comparatively, thus qualify them- 
selves; hence, teaching is more of a temporary employment than that of a 
profession. Changes are constantly going on among the teaching force of 
any State. Many of the States change thirty per cent. of their teaching 
- force each year. 
Another difficulty lies in the direction of non-conformity among the States 
themselves. For instance, county and township government in newer States 
is more simple than in the older colonies. We have but little correspond: 
ing to the New England town meeting, and of which they are so tenacious 
even to this day. They do things in one way, we in another. Their cities 
and towns have more autonomy than it is desirable for us to use. We are 
governed more by general laws, and not by special charters and statutes. 
Certain powers granted by their legislatures are expressly forbidden by 
our State constitutions. 
In Missouri a board of education cannot bind their successors in office in 
regard to certain specified matters. Of course this brings us to the law of 
corporations, their powers and duties; nevertheless one branch of the sub- 
ject lands us here. : 
Massachusetts issues no State certificates; nearly all the Western and 
Middle States do. But there is no power, except an act of courtesy, that a 
State certificate issued in Missouri shall be valid in Illinois, Tennessee, or 
California. 
In the newer States certificates are issued by the State superintendent, 
the county superintendent, and by cities having special privileges expressly
-P-A-G-E-369
  LICENSURE OF TEACHERS. 369 
granted by the State legislatures. That is, State certificates are issued as a 
reward of the survival of the fittest. Nor till we can train properly all 
our teachers should they be licensed for life. The States are working out 
this problem slowly, and there it should rest at present. 
Mr. Browy, of Illinois, said: The question most important for this Coun- 
cil to consider is, what have we to suggest on the matter of the licensure of 
teachers that will tend to improve the teaching force of the country? 
There is, as has been suggested, a profession of teaching, but it contains 
very few members relatively to the great body of those who teach. What 
shall be the plan of examination by which these members receive their final 
papers admitting them to membership in this profession, is of small conse- 
quence. They have earned their membership, and are probably recognized 
as members without regard to State examinations. But there is an im- 
mensely large class who are in the different stages of preparation for the 
teaching profession. What can the superintendents and examiners do 
through their examinations to urge this class to a better preparation for 
their work? I think that there is a slowly-increasing recognition from 
year to year that something important can be done. The superintendent 
first employs the examination to elevate the scholarship of the teacher. A 
majority of those who begin to teach are disgracefully ignorant of the sub- 
jects in which they are employed to give instruction. And yet every com- 
munity, within certain limits, must furnish.its own teachers of its schools. 
No other arrangement would satisfy the people. After the teacher has 
reached a certain grade of scholarship, then the superintendent can cease 
to urge this point, and can place a series of inducements before these teach- 
ers to make a more thorough study of professional subjects. The plan 
usually adopted is to excuse the teacher from further scholastic tests, pro- 
vided he passes satisfactory examinations in certain lines of professional 
reading. By some such mode as this the examination may become the 
means of elevating the standard of acquirements of those teachers who stay 
in the work long enough to be influenced by it.

REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON SECONDARY EDUCATION. 
THE OPPORTUNITIES OF THE RURAL POPULATION FOR 
HIGHER EDUCATION. 
[PREPARED AND PRESENTED BY JAMES H. CANFIELD.] 
After a careful survey of the field assigned to the Committee on Secondary 
Education, it was determined to maké an investigation of the opportunities 
and inducements offered the rural population of this country for securing 
the advantages of higher education. Accordingly three forms of circulars 
were prepared, each having a suitable prefatory note explaining the work 
of the committee, and asking for information and for a free expression of 
opinion. The first of these circulars was addressed to State Superintendents 
of Public Instruction, and contained the following inquiries: 
1. The school population of this State is Of this about —— per cent. be- 
longs in the district (rural or ungraded) schools. The minimum course of study 
required in these rural schools includes the following branches: ——. 
2. The following higher branches may be taken up in such schools: ——. 
8. Does your statute compel, or permit, the creation of township high schools, 
union high schools, or city high schools? 
4, What are the opportunities offered the pounHE of rural districts in your State 
for academic (or preparatory) work?   
The second circular was sent to presidents of State piivedtional institu- 
tions, and ran as follows: 
1. Institution, ——. 
2. Total attendance, Number in preparatory classes, ——. What propor- 
tion of your students come from rural districts and from small towns in which there 
are no high schools? ——. 
83. Why not more? 
4, Why do you maintain preparatory classes? 
5. What are the requirements for admission to the lowest preparatory class? 
6. Does the average rural (district) school fully prepare students for the lowest 
preparatory class? 
7. Where are most of your candidates for freshman class prepared? 
8. What opportunities are offered the people of the rural districts in your State 
for academic (or preparatory) work? 
9.* What is the average annual expenditure of the State for the university? 
10. What proportion of this comes from endowment, and what from annual ap- 
propriations? 
11. What is the average annual attendance at the university aside from those in 
the preparatory department? 
12.* What are the average annual fees, if any, ‘per capita annual attendance?   
*Questions 9-12 were designed to inform thé committee of the interest felt in higher education. 
It will be sufficient for the purposes of this report to state that the answers showed what may be fairly 
considered liberal appropriations for such work, and small tuition fees, Higher education can be re- 
ported as receiving very general encouragement.      
-P-A-G-E-371
  HIGHER EDUCATION OF THE RURAL POPULATION. 871 
  
13. In your judgment, is there any break in the possible connection of the rural 
(district) school with the university? 
14. If yes, how can this best be remedied? 
The third circular was more general in form, and was intended for city 
and county superintendents, principals of high schools, and other educators 
sufficiently well and favorably known to entitle their views to more than 
ordinary consideration. Following are the questions asked: 
1. Has your State University a preparatory department or preparatory classes? 
2. Why? 
3. Does the average rural (district) ungraded school fully prepare students for 
the preparatory classes? 
4, Has your State a system of city high schools? 
5. Is tuition generally free in these city high schools? 
6. If no, what are the average annual fees per capita of attendance? 
7. How many such high schools are doing what might be called first-class aca- 
demic work, including languages and higher mathematics? 
8. How many such high schools are able to prepare students to enter the fresh- 
man class of the State university, or of any educational institution of similar rank? 
9. Can pupils from rural districts enter these high schools freely, or in limited 
numbers? Without fees, by payment of ordinary fees, or by payment of special 
fees? 
10. Is any special effort made to attract pupils from the rural districts to these 
high schools? Are such pupils welcomed, or repelled? , 
11. Are cities compelled by law to establish these high schools by any limit of 
population, or other condition? 
12. Have rural districts any voice in establishing such high schools, or in their 
management? 
13. Is there any statute by which either township or county high schools may be 
established for the use and benefit of the children of rural districts? If yes, please 
give its substance. 
14. Have schools been established under these provisions? If yes, with what suc- 
cess? If no, why not? 
15. If township high schools have been tried without success, has it not been 
chiefly because of too narrow a field from which to draw either pupils or means of 
support? 
16. Is it your opinion that secondary or academic schools should be so provided 
by the State as to offer every opportunity and inducement to pupils from the rural 
districts? 
17. If no, why not? 
18. If yes, should this be left to the chance of city building and city improving? 
19. Should the people of the rural districts have legislative permission and in- 
centive to make the necessary provision? 
20. Considering such questions as necessary expense and consequent taxation, 
the diminishing per cent. of pupils who pass from grade to grade and then to higher 
work, and the fact that in so many States the county is the unit of local government, 
ought provision, if any, to be made for township high schools or for county high 
schools? 
21. Need (ought) the necessary legislation to in any way affect the present high- 
school system? 2 
22. Is there necessarily danger that a county high school will become simply the 
local high school of the community in which it is established? 
 
-P-A-G-E-372
    372 NATIONAL COUNCIL OF EDUCATION. 
  
23. Is there in truth a State system of public instruction, unless it is Huxley’s 
Educational Ladder—‘one end in the gutter and the other in the university” — 
with all possible provision for intermediate work, “with every round complete”? 
24, Remarks. 
Norn.—The committee desired not only to secure information, but to 
awaken thought and discussion. It will be seen that some of these ques- 
tions were shaped more for the latter end than simply to secure statistical 
information. 
‘Whenever the committee thought it possible to secure more than one re- 
port on the same subject, the three circulars were sent to the same person — 
thus crossing and re-crossing the ground in a way to insure accuracy as to 
facts, and breadth and variety of opinion. 
The responses to these inquiries have been very gratifying, both in the 
large territory from which reports have been received, and in the manifest 
care with which the blanks were filled. Often the interest was sufficient to 
lead the correspondent to add matter not covered by the queries, or to ex- 
press at considerable length his opinion on some.given point. The follow- 
ing will serve to illustrate the wide range of the individual and institutional 
observations and experience which has been cheerfully placed at the service 
of this committee: 
Reports were made by the Superintendents of Public Instruction of the 
following States and Territories: Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, 
Connecticut, Dakota, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Maryland, 
Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, 
Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, 
Washington, Wisconsin—27. In addition to the returns on the blanks, 
the last official (printed) report of the superintendent was sent from each 
of the following: Arkansas, Dakota, Iowa, Kansas, een Pennsyl- 
vania, Texas, Wyoming—8. 
From the Presidents of State Universities and State Normal Schools were 
received reports representing: Alabama, Colorado, Dakota, Georgia, Illi- 
nois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Mis- 
souri, Nebraska, North Esse Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, 
‘Vermont — 20. 
The City Superintendents reported, as follows: California— Los Angeles; 
Georgia — Atlanta; Idaho— Moscow; Illinois—Lake View; Indiana — 
Attica, Fort Wayne, Indianapolis, Lafayette; Kentucky— Paducah; Mas- 
sachusetts — Boston, Worcester; Minnesota— Minneapolis; Missouri — 
Kansas City; Montana— Helena; Nebraska — Edgar, Lincoln; New York 
—Albany, New Berlin, Syracuse; Ohio—Cincinnati; Rhode Island —Prov- 
idence; Tennessee — Clarksville; Texas—Fort Worth; Utah— Ogden; 
Washington— Tacoma; West Virginia— Morgantown; Wisconsin— Fond 
du Lac; Wyoming— Cheyenne ;— 28. 
Twenty-seven County Superintendents reported, from the following: Cali-

fornia, Dakota, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Maryland, Minnesota, Ne- 
braska, Wisconsin — 10. 
In addition to these, were reports from eight presidents of colleges not 
under State control, from nineteen professors or instructors in State or de- 
nominational institutions, and from three editors and publishers. - The total 
number of separate reports received is two hundred and sixty-three. As 
these correspondents were not chosen haphazard, but with all possible care, 
the returns will be seen to have special value. 
The nature of the questions and replies is such as will not readily admit 
of tabulation. Later in this report an effort will be made to arrange and 
summarize certain statements made in answer to some of the more categori- 
cal queries. 
STATE SUPERINTENDENTS (29). 
The reports on per cent. of children in rural or ungraded schools vary, 
naturally enough, according to the section of the country from which they 
come. The South, which has just undertaken public (general) education, 
can show little advance in matters of system; from eighty to ninety per 
cent. of its school population is to be found in the ungraded schools, which 
is doubtless practically all that is actually in attendance. The Western 
States show from fifty to sixty per cent. in such schools; and the New Eng- 
land and Middle States from twenty to thirty per cent. From data fur- 
nished by these reports and secured from other sources, the average of 
twenty-three leading States is a trifle above sixty per cent. 
The minimum course of study required in the ungraded schools seems to 
universally include reading, writing, spelling, English grammar, geography, 
and arithmetic. Nearly all States add United States history. Very many 
include physiology, quite generally with special reference to use of narcotics 
and stimulants. Florida. adds manual training. California adds vocal 
music, elementary book-keeping, industrial drawing, and practical ento- 
mology. Oregon adds “familiar science,” “elements of citizenship,” vocal 
music, and drawing. Michigan reports no required minimum; the question 
as to what shall be taught being left entirely to the district board. 
The permissive course in ungraded schools seems to very generally in- 
“elude algebra, geometry, physiology, book-keeping, and drawing. Florida 
adds Latin. Oregon adds chemistry, botany, general history, and English 
literature. There is a very general reference of the permissive course to 
the county or district authorities, with power to act. 
As to whether the statute compels or permits the establishment of high 
schools, Massachusetts is the only State reporting a compulsory law. In 
this State “every town may, and every town containing five hundred fami-

With respect to the opportunities offered the pupils of the rural districts 
for academic (or preparatory) work, the reports very generally agree that 
there are few, if any, outside a fee school, the existence of which is a matter 
of chance, and in which room is always doubtful, as preference is given 
resident pupils, and very few cities build beyond their own needs. - Under 
the Minnesota plan, which will be described later in this report, sixty-three 
State high schools are in existence. Indiana reports “a good many town- 
ship graded schools.” Several States seem to think the want is met by 
“several colleges and universities with preparatory departments.” The- 
very general opinion of our correspondents in State offices seems td’ be that 
there is a wide gap between the rural school and higher institutions, to 
bridge which neither opportunity nor inducement is offered. 
STATE INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER LEARNING (20). 
As nearly as can be determined from reports to this committee, and from 
other reliable data, of nearly four hundred institutions of higher learning 
in the United States, only sixty-five have freed themselves from the embar- 
rassment of a preparatory department. Eleven of these more advanced 
institutions are directly under State control, forming not quite half of the 
State universities reported by the United States Commissioner of Edu- 
cation. Five-sixths of all the so-called colleges and universities in the 
United States and more than half the State universities still find it neces- 
sary to do academic (preparatory) work. If there is a normal school— 
State or other—not doing a large amount of academic work, its existence 
is unknown to your committee. 
The reason universally given for this continuance of work which simply 
embarrasses those properly engaged in higher instruction, and the support 
of which is sometimes gravely considered a misappropriation of trust-funds, is 
simply that there is no adequate preparation for higher institutions offered 
under the State system. This is the answer returned, in apparent good 
faith, by every institution reporting. 
It seems to have been difficult for our correspondents to make very accu- 
rate estimates of the per cent. of students coming from rural (or ungraded) 
districts. Upon two points, however, there is substantial unanimity: (1) 
Such students are present in higher classes in perceptible numbers only 
where there is a preparatory department, the largest number under other 
circumstances not exceeding twenty per cent.; (2) with one exception, the 
reason for this small enrollment is given as “want of opportunities and in- 
ducement to prepare.” This one exceptional reason is, “ Because the people 
who seek higher education are relatively more numerous in cities and towns 
than in rural districts.” But, query: (1) Is this statement true? Your 
committee incline to a contrary belief—i. ¢., that in proportion to popula- 
tion, cities do not furnish a greater number seeking higher education than 
rural districts furnish. (2) If the statement be true, is it not because of 
the opportunity offered in cities, which is rarely known in rural districts?

  HIGHER EDUCATION OF THE RURAL POPULATION. 375 
The requirements for admission to the lowest preparatory class generally 
indicate that the university is striving through its preparatory department 
to keep, touch with the most elementary schools—the rural and ungraded 
schools. The effect of this on the universities or colleges—and on the high 
schools, which are in existence, but thus largely fail of recognition—is 
readily seen. 
-Where the preparatory departments are retained, nearly seventy-five per 
cent..of the upper-class men are prepared by the University itself, thus show- 
- ing again but slight contact with such high schools as have been established, 
and thérefore but slight influence over them. Where there is no prepara- 
tory department the rural population has small representation, and the work 
of preparation is reported to be done at private schools, or at high schools 
in the nearest town, generally upon payment of term fees. 
With one voice these twenty representatives of higher State institutions 
declare that “there are no opportunities offered the people of the rural dis- 
tricts for academic (or preparatory) work, except as they may go to private 
schools; or (that which is practically the same thing) to high schools in ad- 
joining cities, provided (1) such high schools have been established; (2) that 
provision has been made for the admission of non-resident pupils; (3) that 
there is room for non-resident pupils; and (4) that certain fees are paid, very 
generally.” 
Asked if, in their judgment, there is any break in the possible connection 
of the rural (ungraded) school with the university or higher education, twelve 
of these correspondents answer emphatically,‘ Yes.” One says,“ No.” One 
says, “No serious break.” One says, “ No break in the possible connection, 
but in the actual.” One is in doubt. The others are silent, though their - 
answers to the next question seem to imply that they recognize the gap in 
the system. 
As to a remedy, the opinion is somewhat divided. There is frequent repe- 
tition of the rather vague’statement: “Make better use of the schools already 
established,” or the even more vague advice, “Make the public schools 
better.” Kansas says, “Students from the rural schools should be admitted 
to the high school of the nearest city.” Minnesota has its own system of 
city high schools with State aid, and refers to this as successful. Tennessee 
says emphatically, “By good county high schools, and not humbug ‘col- 
leges.’”” Michigan says, “By establishing a high school in each county.’ 
Indiana feels that the local high schools need restricting to a purely academic 
basis, the present tendency being to imitate small colleges. Illinois says 
that there must be a link found, as in that State not one-half of one per cent. 
of the population of school age is in institutions even by courtesy called 
colleges. ;

Tennessee, 6; Texas, 7; Utah, 1; Vermont, 3; Virginia, 4; Washington, 3; 
West Virginia, 2; Wisconsin, 11; Wyoming, 1. It will be seen that these 
reports cover the Union as completely as can be expected, unless such a re- 
port as this is to be made by officials whose duty it is to look after such 
matters. Your committee believes that in point of intelligent apprehension 
of what was sought by the circulars and of intelligent replies, these reports 
surpass those generally known as “ official.” * 
The first two questions in the general circular were answered much as 
would be anticipated." Where State universities have no preparatory de- 
partments, the reason generally assigned is that there are a sufficient num- 
ber of well-conducted high schools to do the preparatory work. That the 
word “sufficient” is used rather carelessly, is shown by a consideration of 
some of the later replies. Where there is a preparatory department it is 
said to be because students cannot secure good secondary instruction else- 
‘where, or cannot secure it without great inconvenience and expense. 
A number of special statements are made, however, to a few of which— 
as being rather suggestive—your attention is directed. The committee is 
content to quote without comment: “Our city high schools are rather jinish- 
ing-schools than fitting-schools, hence we have a preparatory department.” 
“Tt is hard to say why our preparatory department is continued on funds 
set aside for purposes of higher education. This has never been defended.” 
“We have no preparatory department, as we think it our place to encour- 
age rather than discourage the high schools of the State.” There is a certain 
brutal frankness in the statement, “We maintain a preparatory department 
in order to keep up a show of numbers;” yet this comes from one of the most 
advanced State institutions. “ We have no preparatory department, because 
the freshman class is graded down to touch the country district schools.” 
“We continue our preparatory work, because a large number of those 
desiring to enter can have no other access to means of preparation.” ‘‘Our 
university still has a‘preparatory department, because it is more of a gram- 
mar school than a university.” “Our preparatory department has been 
discontinued, because we determined that it was not within the purpose of 
our endowment.” 
Even with preparatory departments, the answers to question 3 show that 
the district (ungraded) schools do not fully prepare for admission, the nega- 
tive replies being to the affirmative as four toone. In the States from which 
the affirmatives came, it was generally noticeable that the requirements for 
*It should be remembered that not all the questions were answered in edch report, though the re- 
ports are very complete.

  HIGHER EDUCATION OF THE RURAL POPULATION. 377 
  
admission were about the same as those for a teacher’s certificate of the 
lowest grade. 
If a single State in the Union has a system of city high schools, the fact 
has escaped the notice of your committee. Even where some intelligent 
effort has been made to grade the district schools and unify their work, the 
cities have apparently gone on their own way, the “way” being right in 
their own eyes, at least. This seems to be largely due to the absence of 
any common standard—of anything to grade to or to grade by. It may 
be remarked in passing, that where no preparatory work is done by the 
State, the local schools show stronger tendencies toward unity and harmo- 
nious action. 
Tuition in city high schools is generally free to all resident children. In 
a very few instances, reports mention slight fees for instruction in languages. 
The number of high schools “doing first-class academic work, including 
languages and higher mathematics,” is reported (always with reservation) 
by States as follows: Alabama, 8; California, 7 (State Superintendent), 
“Not more than two” (a report from a member of the faculty of the State 
University); Colorado, 4; Connecticut, 22; Dakota, 18 (Secretary of Ter- 
ritorial Board of Education); District of Columbia, 2; Florida, 15; Geor- 
gia, 20 (probably including private academies); Idaho, “ Possibly that at 
Boise City”; Illinois, “All will claim this,” “From two-thirds to three- 
fourths,” “Thirteen give full preparation for the freshman classical course” 
(State Superintendent); Indiana, “ Very few,” “Ninety-nine are commis- 
sioned by the State Board to send graduates to the State University”; Iowa, 
70; Kansas, “The University recognizes sixteen, with thirty-one others not 
quite complete in course”; Kentucky, 4, “None, really, outside of Louis-_ 
ville”; Maine, “Nearly all city high schools”; Maryland, 10; Massachu- 
setts, “All in cities or towns. of more than 4,000 inhabitants”; Michigan, 
35, “Twenty, perhaps, have a full classical course”; Minnesota, 30 (State 
Superintendent), “Sixty-five city high schools receive $400 each per annum 
from the State, on condition of furnishing free tuition to non-residents of 
the city”; Mississippi, “None,” “ Possibly 50, including private academies” ; 
Missouri, “‘ Not more than four’’; Montana, “Really none”; Nebraska, 10 
to 15; Nevada,5; New Hampshire, “All city and most town high schools” ; 
New Mexico, “ Possibly a half-dozen trying, mostly parochial schools of the 
mission class”; New York, “All”; Ohio, “Fifteen, but generally without 
Greek,” 159 (State Commissioner) ;* Oregon, 1; Rhode Island, 3; Tennes-   
*Explaining this apparent discrepancy, the State Commissioner of Ohio writes: “There must be a 
difference in the definitions of ‘first-class academic work.’ Inasmuch as Ohio colleges do not require 
Greek for admission to college classes, provided candidates can offer equivalents in other branches — 
for instance, in extra Latin or mathematies—I have not considered Greek, nor do I consider it with- 
out these limitations, ‘essential to first-class academic work.’ The schools I have numbered among 
the 159 all teach Latin, many of them German, and all of them physics and advanced mathematics, by 
which I mean algebra, geometry, and most of them plane trigonometry. I do not say that all the 
schools in my enumeration teach enough of these to prepare pupils for entrance into college (I am sure 
agreat many of them do not), but they are doing work looking in that direction, and work which in 
my opinion may be properly classed under the head of first-class academic work.”  
-P-A-G-E-378

see, “ Possibly four, but Greek, French and German are not taught”; Texas, 
possibly 15; Utah, “None”; Vermont, 1, “There are 27 academies and pri- 
vate schools”; Waskingeoin “None, a recent legislature having enacted that 
‘no other language than English nor mathematics higher than algebra’ shall 
be taught in such schools”; Wisconsin, 65, including all academies, “11 
prepare in all courses for the university, and 34 in the modern classical 
course” ;* Wyoming, “None.” 
The committee made an effort to secure the school population of each of 
these States, but found this to be almost impossible. However, a glance 
will serve to show how inadequate in nearly all the States is the work in 
secondary education, even when regarded from the standpoint of quantity 
only. 
As to question eight, it may be sufficient to say that the reports show that 
of the schools just reported, a very large proportion are not able to fully fit 
for freshman classes. This is true in every case given above, where it is not 
specified that a high-school graduation is recognized by the State university, 
or other institutions of similar rank. 
Non-resident pupils attending city high schools are generally charged 
fees, which seems natural and proper enough. The exceptions seem to be 
Minnesota (where the State contributes to the support of the city schools), 
Florida, Mississippi,and Wyoming. In these last there seems to be no set- 
tled principle—only the fact that fees have not yet been charged. 
That non-resident pupils are welcomed, that any special effort is made to 
attract them, seems much in doubt. There are many correspondents who 
answer in the affirmative, but there are more who are guarded. “ We can- 
not welcome them—we are overcrowded now.” “They are received rather 
grudgingly — our seats are full.” “ Few cities build beyond their own needs: 
how can they take in others?” ‘We are not able to build for outsiders; 
it does not pay.” ‘They are generally a burden in more ways than one.” 
Such is the tenor of a large number of returns. Even in Minnesota there 
is not sufficient room, and the proportion of those in attendance from rural 
districts is very small. 
Your committee finds no State in which cities are compelled to establish 
high schools, except Massachusetts. Nor can we find that the rural popu- 
lation has any voice in establishing or managing city high schools.} 
The general status of secondary education in the United States, as gathered 
from the reports and from other sources, seems to be as follows: 
Alabama.—No public high schools recognized in the erie school system. 
Such schools rely entirely on local support. 
Arizona —The ee laws are silent on the eu piece of high schools.   
  
* Latin is the only language required, 
+In this connection should be noted a somewhat converse condition, i. ¢., while county superin- 
, tendents have no jurisdiction in cities, the cities share in their election, and thus very generally de- termine the choice of the highest official for rural schools, in which the city has no interest whatever.

     Arkansas.—Graded schools are provided in several cities at public 
expense, and a few cities have high schools, but there seems to be no close 
organization, nor any recognition of these as a part of a system. 
California.—No State school money aids schools of higher than gram- 
mar grade. High schools exist in cities, sustained by special local levies. 
The statute permits any district to establish by popular vote a grammar 
school, which shall prepare for entrance to the scientific courses of the Uni- 
versity. A few such schools have been established, but with indifferent 
success, chiefly because the district constitutes a field too narrow from which 
to draw either pupils or support for higher work. At the recent session of the 
State Legislature a bill was introduced to authorize counties to establish 
county high schools. ‘The movement was regarded with much favor, but 
‘your committee cannot learn the fate of the measure. “The law should cer- 
tainly be niandatory as to one good school in each county.” 
Colorado.—Cities are considered school districts, come under the general 
district law, and thus receive their share of public school money. High 
schools exist in the cities. The law also permits two or more contiguous 
rural districts to unite in establishing a high school, but the support must 
come from local levies. No such schools exist. 
Coninecticut.—The statute is simply permissive as to town schools of grade 
higher than elementary. Such schools have been very generally established. 
Dr. Henry Barnard writes: “There are some general advantages connected 
with a wider constituency for secondary education—such as the mere fact 
of students leaving rural homes for the larger life and different surround- 
ings of a city or town. . . . A very eminent teacher in Massachusetts, 
just about a hundred years ago, proposed a system of county academies 
(aided by public grants, and being about the same thing as a county high 
school) as being indirectly the very best institutions for fitting school-mas- 
ters. It was in this form also that Professor Olmstead made the earliest 
suggestion (1816) for an academy for school-masters in Connecticut. ‘ 
About 1846, in an address delivered at Chicago before the Northwestern 
Educational Convention, I, myself, touched incidentally on this very point 
in the assertion that if, in the State system, we were not to have a high school 
in every city (or town), we ought at least to have one in every county, which 
would give certain special advantages over any mere local high school.” 
Dakota.—The statute is permissive, and high schools may be established in 
townships subject to decision of the resident voters. As a condition prece- 
dent, there must be four or more properly-equipped rural schools, and an 
assessment of $200,000. 
Delaware.—The State makes no provision, but some cities maintain high 
schools. 
District of Columbia.—The federal school system includes high schools. 
Florida.—County boards are authorized to open high schools wherever 
the condition of education requires them.
-P-A-G-E-380
  380 NATIONAL COUNCIL OF EDUCATION. 
Georgia.—The State law makes no provision, but some cities maintain 
high schools, “really the result of private enterprise.” 
Idaho.—Statute is permissive as to cities, but no other reference is made 
to high schools or secondary education. 
Illinois—School boards in incorporated cities and villages are con- 
structively authorized to establish high schools, and school townships may 
have them by popular vote. Only ten such schools have been established, 
and two of these have been discontinued. Our correspondents generally 
agree that the township is too narrow a field from which to draw pupils and 
support for a good high school; though other reasons—lack of interest in 
higher education, local jealousies between country and village, ete—are 
also assigned. 
Indiana.—The statute permits township trustees to establish graded 
schools. Many such schools have been established, and when in densely 
populated townships, with at least fair success. But again our correspond- 
ents agree with quite remarkable unanimity, that the average rural town- 
ship is too narrow a field from which to either draw pupils or support for a 
school of really high grade. ‘A school above the district school yet organ- 
ically connected with it, must prove a great impetus to both pupil and 
teacher. The trouble now is that students in district schools have no idea 
of more advanced work; think that the common -school is sufficient. The 
high school is a sure and necessary corrective of this. I do not see how it 
can be successfully maintained in rural ‘townships. The West at least 
needs good county high’ schools.” 
Indian Territory—No report. 
Towa.—The statute is permissive as to both county and township high 
schools. Guthrie county has a county high school which is reported as suc- 
cessful. A letter from the superintendent of that county gives the following 
reasons why the school meets with recognition and approval: 
1. It helps keep up among the people a high estimate of the value of 
education. 
2. It is the connecting link between the common school and the college. 
3. It is the head of the school system of the county, and is a constant 
incentive to better work below. 
4. It educates a large number of teachers for the country schools. 
There seem to be but few township schools, and these are generally graded 
schools and not high schools. The usual reason is given for the practical 
failure of this position of the statute, “the township is too narrow a field.” 
Kansas.—The statute is permissive as to county high schools and union 
district graded schools. City high schools are maintained by the usual 
local ‘levies. Several attempts have been made to establish county high 
schools, but they have generally failed becausé of local jealousies in select- 
ing the location. Dickinson county, however, has established a county high 
school at Chapman. An unusually commodious building has been erected, 
 
-P-A-G-E-381
  HIGHER EDUCATION OF THE RURAL POPULATION. 381 
_ and the school opens in September. The interest taken in this movement 
by the rural schools is great, and the beneficial effects in the way of stimu- 
lus to proper grading of all country schools and increased ambition and 
activity on the part of the district school teachers have been manifest from 
the day the ground was broken for the foundation of the new building. 
“Tf every city or town is not compelled to maintain a high school and open 
it freely to students from the rural districts, then there should be a county 
high school offering special opportunities and inducements to such pupils.” 
Kentucky.—Cities and towns maintaining a system of common schools 
are considered school districts, and thus receive their share of State money. 
Some cities have established high schools. The statute seems to be silent 
on this point. 
Louisiana.—No report. 
Maine.—The statute is permissive, and a large number of towns have 
high schools. The State duplicates the amount expended by each town to 
the extent of $250. .There is no systematic relation between these and the 
district schools, each often infringing on the proper work of the other’. 
Maryland.—The school system includes county and district high schools, 
and these are more or less complete in each county. In referring to those 
which have been “successful,” our correspondents mention the county schools 
only. State aid is also granted to some extent to some sixteen academies. 
Massachusetts—Any town may establish a school for instruction in higher 
English branches. Towns with 500 families must have such schools, includ- 
ing ordinary high-school branches. Towns of 4,000 and upward must add 
instruction in Greek, French, astronomy, geology, rhetoric, logic, intellect- 
ual and moral science, and political economy. 
Michigan—The law permits city schools and union district graded 
schools. An effort is being made to adopt the township system, with an 
enabling act for establishing township high schools. 
Minnesota.—The boards of education of any city, town or village of 500 
population or more may establish such grades of school as seem expedient. 
There is a State high-school board, which controls the appropriation of 
State aid granted certain city high schools on condition of instruction fur- 
nished non-residents free; but not more than five’schools can be so aided in 
any county in the same year. 
Mississippi.—The report is indefinite, but refers to preparatory depart- 
ment of State University in such a way as to lead to the inference that this 
is the only preparatory work provided by statute. 
Missouwri.—Cities, towns and villages organize as school districts, and 
schools of higher grade may be established. No such schools exist outside 
' of cities. 
Montana.—No report. 
Nebraska.—The statute permits the district board{of any district of more 
than 150 children of school age to establish a high school, subjegt to a vote 
of the people. No worthy secondary schools reported outside of cities.
-P-A-G-E-382
    382 NATIONAL COUNCIL OF EDUCATION. 
  
Nevada.—A village, town, or incorporated city constitutes a school dis- 
. trict, and high schools may be established “wherever funds are sufficient to, 
sustain them.” 
New Hampshire.—If two-thirds of voters so agree, any town or district 
having 100 children 6-16 years of age, may establish a high school. Such 
schools have been established, and have been successful. 
New Jersey.—The statute seems permissive only. 
New Mexico.—Our Territory has no high schools, and no system of pub- 
lie schools worthy of name. There are but three months in the year of free 
schools, and these of the poorest order. After a three-years experience in 
a township school in Indiana, as a matter of personal opinion I am strongly 
in favor of county high schools.” 
New York.—The law authorizes union district schools, and permits these 
to adopt academies which are within the district as academical departments. 
The State assists such departments by direct appropriations. “The rural 
district schools are entirely independent of each other, and of any higher 
school whatever. The only promotion within reach of a pupil in these pub- 
lie schools is offered by the regents of the University, who provide that at 
the regular examinations in the academies, pupils from the public schools 
may be admitted and examined along with the scholars in the academies; 
and if successful, they may secure the same ‘pass cards,’ certificates, or even 
diplomas, as are granted to academic scholars. From the nature of the ease, 
however, but few seek such opportunity beyond the preliminary branches, 
and probably none beyond what is known as the intermediate.” 
North Carolina.—The State law apparently makes no provision whatever 
for higher instruction, except that in townships of 5,000 inhabitants or more 
graded schools may be established; but the tax for their support is not to 
exceed one-tenth of one per cent. and 30 cents poll. 
Ohio.—The statute simply permits the establishment of high schools at 
the discretion of each board of education. A few such schools have been 
established in rural districts, and are reported as successful.* 
Oregon.—In districts with 1,000 or more children of school age, high 
schools must be maintained at least six months in each year. 
Pennsylvania.—The statute permits district directors at their discretion 
to establish schools of different grades, and under this, city high schools have 
beeome very general. 
Rhode Island.—School districts or union districts may establish schools 
of higher grades. 
South Carolina.—The law seems silent. 
Tennessee.—Township boards may establish schools of higher grade, and 
some such schools have been created. There has been but indifferent suc- 
cess; “the territory is too small,” and “rural school boards have not ‘busi- 
ness’ enough to work this plan.”   
* As to city high schools, see page 377 of this volume.
-P-A-G-E-383
  HIGHER EDUCATION OF THE RURAL POPULATION. 383 
Texas.—No provision for county or township high schools. The last State 
Superintendent’s report urges the establishment of county high schools. 
Four leagues of land were granted for this purpose to each county in the 
State by the ante-bellum constitution, but the reconstructed constitution di- 
verted these lands to the support of the common schools. 
Utah—Districts having a population of 1,200 or more may by popular 
vote establish graded schools. Pupils under 18 years of age cannot be ad- 
mitted. 
Vermont.—The law permits the establishment of central graded schools 
in villages and towns, but outside of towns no response has been made to 
such permission. 
Virginia.—District boards may provide higher instruction, with consent 
of county school board. A few such schools have been established, but 
with very little success. “Territory too small from which to draw pupils or 
support.” 
Washington Territory—The law does not recognize schools in which 
languages other than English or mathematics higher than algebra are taught. 
West Virginia.—No report. 
Wisconsin.—Districts may establish high schools, and maintaining these 
not less than three months are entitled to receive from the State half the 
amount actually expended for instruction in higher branches.. Only four 
such schools are reported in operation. 
Wyoming.—The statute is permissive as to city high schools,and grants 
school boards in rural districts the same power. ' No such schools have 
been established outside cities. 
There is very general agreement among our correspondents “that second- 
ary or academic schools should be so provided by the State as to offer every 
opportunity and inducement to pupils from rural districts; that this work 
should not be left to the chance of city building and city providing (this 
expression was unanimous ), but that the people of the rural districts should 
have legislative permission and incentive to make the necessary provision. 
The few who disagree to these propositions are generally those from older 
and more densely populated States, where the highest: form of educational 
work done directly under State aid and supervision is academic, and where 
large towns are many in number and but short distances apart. 
Among other assenting and dissenting voices, the following may be quoted: 
“T do not believe in State aid in secondary education unless pupils are to 
be granted manual training.” “It is simply absurd to establish a university, 
the crowning feature of a State system, and then fail to provide secondary 
schools accessible to all classes of students.” “There is no more reason 
why secondary education should be in fee schools and dependent on the 
chance provision of cities, than that primary instruction should be managed 
in this way.” “The town system is better in our New England States, but 
the West needs county high schools.” “TI think the chance of city building,
-P-A-G-E-384
  384 NATIONAL COUNCIL OF EDUCATION. 
  
ete., is better at present than the chance of county building. I would give 
the people of the rural districts the chance, however.” “ Bring the elementary 
schools to a first-class grade first, then give us the rural high school.” “We 
should have the county high school, with a mandatory law.” “As a rule I 
think the city high schools are sufficient. It is the cost of board, and not of 
tuition, that keeps children out of these schools.” “We think our county 
high school a profitable investment. It is to us what the State Normal is to 
‘the State. Over 200 of the young people of the county attend the school at 
some time during each year. A majority of our teachers attend it before 
they teach, or while they are teaching. The school does more for us directly 
and positively than all the colleges of the State. Many of our young people 
attend some college after graduating from here, who would never have done 
so had they not received the inspiration at the county high school. It is true 
it takes the bright pupils from our country schools occasionally, and weakens 
the school at the time, but a desire is awakened in those that remain to fol- 
low, which more than supplies the loss. A county high school properly 
managed will do much for a county by raising the standard of the teachers.” 
“Tn Illinois, I see no reason why the county, not the State, should not pro- 
vide at the county seat a public school of high grade, in precisely the same 
way that it provides a court house, a jail, etc. The county commissioners 
could do all necessary legislation, under suitable State laws.” “There should 
be county high schools, but only as supplementing township graded (or high) 
schools.” “A ‘high school will in thy opinion always have community sup- 
port only, certainly very little other worth mentioning. I therefore favor 
the township or joint township high school. The State should aid in the 
support of such schools.” ‘I do not believe in furnishing secondary edu- 
cation by the State, ete., because I do not think enough of our poorer classes 
avail themselves of the privileges of free higher education to compensate for 
the extra taxation. Besides, it educates people beyond their natural posi- 
tion in society.” “TI believe in the township high schools, but they can only 
be maintained by aid from the State to the extent, say, of one third or one- 
half their entire expense.” “I cannot indorse free secondary schools; the 
burden of the necessary taxation would be too oppressive.” “Only the town 
high school can be that most desirable thing—a home school. Just as soon 
as a student leaves home, it is to attend a boarding-school, no matter what 
the name.” “The city high schools really do not touch our rural people at 
all. Everyone knows that. We need the county high school, supported 
and controlled by the people who use it.” ‘‘ The county high school is an 
imperative necessity.” “The distance limitation tells against city high 
schools, especially in large cities; and this would tell against county high 
schools.” “Let us have the county high school. Education is cheaper than 
a standing army.” “TI have never yet seen a well-equipped and well-taught 
township (rural) high school.” 
Our correspondents cannot see that legislation looking towards either

county or township high schools need affect the city high schools already 
existing, or prevent others from being established as rapidly as needed. 
City high schools are wholly local, and naturally come entirely under the 
municipal law. The community in which any school of high grade is lo- 
cated is always the ready recipient of its advantages; but those who have 
answered the question touching this matter do not believe that this would 
be true in any special or unusual degree of a county school. All institutions 
of learning must exist somewhere in space; and the thought (or argument) 
of local benefit as applied to county schools seems rather tenuous. Yet 
your committee agree with a correspondent who wrote that “it will require 
care and watchfulness on the part of trustees to prevent any appearance of 
‘ absorption by the locality, which might be fatal. to the best interests of the 
* school.” To the last question there has been but one answer, an emphatic 
“No.” There is no State system which includes only the primary work; 
abandons the secondary schools to cities —and secures no uniformity in these, 
leaving them to shift for themselves under temporary and local influence, 
and with no connection with the lower; and either does nothing in the way 
of higher training, or establishes a so-called university, in which funds de- 
signed for college training are spent in elementary work, or else the institu- 
tion is on stilts, almost wholly separated from the great mass of the people, 
for whose benefit it was primarily intended. All our correspondents recog- 
nize the “educational ladder” as the ideal system, to be kept constantly in 
view as a correct standard, and an attainable one; and several wisely sug- 
gest, that though there may be a half-truth and a seeming wisdom in calling 
first for the primary schools and these of superior quality, the higher work 
is absolutely essential to the well-being of the lower. They agree with the 
well-known saying of Metternich: “All reforms begin at the top.” Atten- 
tion is also called to the fact, that judged from the standpoint of a tangible, 
practical, every-day life, the higher studies are more valuable than the 
lower. ; 
From the “Remarks” we make a few extracts. “The ‘educational 
ladder’ in this State was left so very weak in the middle that it broke en- 
tirely in two some years ago. The result is that both ends are growing 
weaker and more inefficient every year.” “Every child of school age should 
be able to see clearly and follow with the minimum of sacrifice and the 
maximum of incentive the path from the primary schools to the close of a 
university course. The State owes this to its children —but more than this, . 
it owes it to itself as a matter of self-preservation.” “A complete system, 
as suggested by the ‘ladder’ question, is a necessity in every State —if merely 
as a standard and assurance of continued general education.” “To know 
the beginning and end of learning, one must certainly know that which lies 
between.” “It seems to me that the ‘ladder’ system is not wanted, and is 
really harmful, when we think that the average person has little or no use 
for university training. One fault or trouble of to-day is that so many are 
‘

‘educated’ above the plane on which nature intended them to move. In- 
stead of being a successful farmer or mechanic, many, by a smattering of 
a university knowledge, are spoiled. The new Northwest contains many of 
such ‘educational’ tramps and ‘educational’ nobodies, whom a good com- 
mon-school education left in a condition to succeed in the middle walks of 
life; but the university has spoiled them forever, because they are no longer 
willing to occupy ‘middle ground,’ and are incapable of anything higher.” * 
“The Minnesota plan has very decided merits, I think. Instead of estab- 
lishing a new high school in the county, substantial encouragement is given 
to those already in existence, which do a prescribed amount of work and 
make tuition free. This concentrates the efforts on fewer localities, and 
guarantees better results. There are many counties where high schools are 
so numerous that it would be altogether superfluous to attempt the estab- 
lishment of more. I doubt if it would be practicable to have a school in 
any place in this county outside the city. If, however, some of the villages 
outside should undertake it under the Minnesota plan, these schools might 
be helped, and many who could not attend school in the city might be able 
to attend these other schools. It is evident that special legislation would 
be necessary in almost every State to make this kind of school a success. 
It would require a proper board of directors, and provisions which are not 
found in the statutes of most of the States. In the large and sparsely-set- 
tled counties of the newer States, a county school of this kind might be made 
a great agency in higher education; and for these new counties the sugges- 
tion seems to me one of great value, and entirely practicable. I am much 
impressed with the excellence of the Minnesota plan.” “TI accept the ‘lad- 
der’ theory, but the secondary schools must be more than mere fitting- 
schools; they must keep in mind the needs of the large number who cannot 
do higher work.” “A State university worthy of the name must imply a 
system of high schools, under State supervision, near the people, and espe- 
cially the rural people, who not only sadly neglect their own interests, but 
have always been sadly neglected by the State.” “We have no State sys- 
tem in the United States, with very rare exceptions; only collections of 
local systems, which generally have very little real system even there.” 
“If there was as little system in the business world as in the educational 
world, there would be universal bankruptcy in sixty days.” “‘There should 
be full and complete provision for the preparation of all for the university, 
. if simply to surely give the one in one thousand the coveted opportunity.” 
“The connecting link is as ‘missing’ in-our educational system as in Dar- 
winism.” ‘Few would climb that ladder in any event. That end of the 
ladder which is in the ‘gutter’ is the one more nearly connected with the 
* This is an old story — argument it can searcely be called, The position has been traversed again 
and again. It requires some courage to-day to announce that the “tramp scholar” is a tramp because 
of the schools. If in very exceptional cases this is true, it is evidently not the fault of the system, but 
of some individual school or teacher. The “tramp scholar” of a later life will generally prove to have 
been but a “tramp pupil” earlier in life.

people, and the one which should receive our undivided attention and con- 
stant vigilance. If the first years of school-life are firmly rooted in intel- 
" ligence, patriotism, and self-respect, the wniversity will not suffer, neither 
will our Government, from the ignorance of its people; but let every round 
be complete, if possible.” “One of the greatest needs of the present and 
of the future is what I shall call by the unfitting name, ‘gutter schools,’ 
i.é., a system (it ought to be a ‘system’) of schools to do middle-grade 
work in a brief space of time after pupils learn to read—to teach them 
while they can be in school an outline of what they will use when grown. 
The ‘county high school’ is in many places a sort of separated and separat- _ 
ing institution, giving a higher education to many who could not attain to 
its grade otherwise; ‘gutter schools’ would serve a similar, yet more valua- 
ble, purpose in educating such.as attend school for a brief period only of 
their ‘school years.’ I believe in educating a little as heartily as in educat- 
ing much. County high schools serve as one round of Huxley’s ladder, but 
they serve a nobler (if not a better) end, by giving many a ‘higher’ educa- 
tion than they could otherwise obtain. We need width more than, we need 
height in our educational work in America at present. Our systems are 
fairly perfect where they work under favorable conditions; but the academy 
is a thing of the past, and the graded school is becoming too attenuated and 
long-drawn-out for the laboring poor of the masses; hence, we more and 
more need county (country) high schools and the city and country ‘gutter 
schools.’” 
‘Your committee feels that the evidence collected shows that — 
I. The State systems are still very generally partial and chaotic. 
II. For all secondary education, the mass of the rural population is gen- 
erally dependent upon chance, or the favor of some city. 
III. With few exceptions no opportunities or inducements worthy of the 
name in the way of secondary or higher education are offered the rural pop- 
ulation. 
IV. Where efforts in the way of systematic secondary education have been 
reported as made, outside of cities and towns, but are not and cannot be 
considered as even fairly successful, it is because — 
1. They are too limited as to territory, population, and resources; or, 
2. The organization is not sufficiently close and complete —there being 
too much irregularity in the work of the lower schools; or, 
3. The people of the rural districts have no voice in the management and 
control of such schools, and hence indifference taltes the place of interest. 
From the facts as thus reported, your committee considers the following 
to be legitimate conclusions or suggestions: 
I. The district or rural schools should be graded. 
IL. To grade successfully there must be some standard to which to grade — 
some point which will limit and define the work. 
 
-P-A-G-E-388
388 NATIONAL COUNCIL OF EDUCATION. 
  
III. This limit should be the lowest class recognized under secondary 
education, 
IV. Secondary education should have the same general characteristics 
that have given primary education its strength and its hold upon our peo- 
ple: 
(a) The schools should be free schools and not fee schools. 
(6) The schools should be as near as possible the homes of those to whom 
they minister. 
(ce) Those whose children are to receive the benefit of this instruction 
should participate in the control and management of these schools. 
(d) The establishment and maintenance of such schools should not be 
haphazard, a matter of accident or convenience merely; but should be 
fixed, sure, and systematic. 
V. As it is an admitted fact that only a small per cent. of those who 
reach these schools can ever pass beyond them, the secondary schools should 
combine good academic training with work which is more strictly prepara- 
tory. 
[Nore.—lIt should be understood that a model secondary school will give at least 
such instruction that its graduates can enter the freshman class of colleges of good 
standing. It ought to do more than this. ] 
VI. The secondary schools should in turn grade up to the lowest class in 
the university of the State in which they are situated —if such an institu- 
tion exists. If higher education is not a part of the State system, then the 
secondary schools should grade up to the best academic standard that the 
people can be urged to accept. 
VII. In establishing secondary schools the natural order seems to be: 
(a)-In new and in sparsely-settled States or counties—the county high 
school. : 
(b) As cities come into existence, the city high school in addition to that 
of the county. 
(c) As the rural population grows more dense, the township or union dis- 
trict graded school with courses which lead up to the county high school, 
the grade of which can then be advanced. 
[Norz.—There are comparatively few States in the Union in which township or 
union district high schools can be successfully maintained. | 
VIII. Statute law should be mandatory to the extent of securing at least 
one high school of high grade in each county. 
IX. It should be permissive as to cities and townships, at least within cer- 
tain pretty broad limits of population; but when such schools are estab- 
lished, they should come under laws which will secure some uniformity in 
courses of study—though not necessarily in the extent of such courses— 
and in general management. i 
X. A State system worthy of the name will freely offer every opportunity

and inducement to its entire school population to pass, by systematic methods, 
easily apprehended by those who are to receive the benefits, and under pop- 
ular control, from the lowest seat in the primary school to graduation by a 
college or university of high standing. 
[Norr.—The following memoranda were indorsed on the original report, and are 
printed to avoid any color of “suppression of opinion:” ] 
Would it be possible to limit the work of a large city high school to the 
standard of a county high school, or town high school ?—Baker. 
“If possible, not just—Jones. 
It is sometimes a crime to wrge a pupil to further pursue ideal education. 
—Baker. 
Ideal education calls for ideal pupils —Jonés. 
Can provision be suggested whereby in small counties containing large 
cities the rural population shall have a right to attend the city high school? 
This would of course require certain State interference—James. 
In nota few cases the city is the convenient business and educational focus 
of the county. In such cases the county and the city should be in close sym- 
pathy.— Jones. 
DISCUSSION. 
(REPORTED BY ROBERT ALLYN.) 
W. E. SHetpoy; of Massachusetts: I hope the committee will be allowed 
the usual privilege of being catechised. 
Mr. Canfield took the chair to answer queries. 
Mr. SuHetpon: I believe in “free, not in fee schools.’ How can.these be 
secured in counties of large areas and sparse populations? 
Mr. CanFieLp: The simple question is this: What are you going to do 
for the people in these large counties, in these sparsely-settled counties, in 
the way of secondary education? Are you willing to do anything? In the 
condition which you presuppose, there are no cities. Shall the people of 
these counties have opportunity and incentive for secondary education, and 
through that for higher education? If so, shall they be compelled to await 
the chances of city-building, which at its best gives them no recognized or 
legal status? If not, shall they have the legal right to organize and support 
a secondary school of their own? The details of such a movement are not 
in question here now. 
Mr. Sxetpon: But why do you speak of counties, rather than of other 
civil divisions? 
Mr. CanFieLp: The committee refers to the county because in a large 
number of States it is a recognized and useful political unit; and especially 
because it is the political unit next above the township; and our correspond- 
25—N. EA.

ents are almost unanimous in the expression that the average township does 
not furnish resources or pupils enough to make a successful high school. 
This requires density of population and accumulation of financial resources, 
which cannot be expected in the townships of a vast majority of States for 
years to come. 
8.8. Parr, of Indiana: Forty years ago there were systems of county 
academies — public schools—in our State. These started in many of the 
large towns; but denominational schools started as rivals, and later, with 
some town high schools trying to supplement the free schools, almost drove 
the academies out of existence. The trend in education now is in the direc- 
tion of the township, rather than county schools. It is doubtful whether it 
is best to recommend the latter. 
Mr. CanrreLp: At the time of which the gentleman speaks—thirty or 
forty years ago—our school system as a system was in its infancy. It was 
just struggling into existence and recognition, very generally against the 
influence of private and sectarian schools. It is not at all surprising, there- 
fore, that a system of county academies should be, as the gentleman said, 
“choked out by private and denominational schools.” But the fact proves 
nothing as to the present. The township and city high schools came in 
later, as did the gentleman’s reference to them. They held the ground in 
such a way, that the question of secondary education has not gone back in a 
vital way to the people of the rural districts—and to-day a valued corre- 
spondent in Indiana writes “two-thirds of the people, in the rural districts in 
this State, have neither opportunity nor incentive for secondary education.” 
Mr. Parr (referring to a remark by a member): Indiana can take care 
of herself, and even Posey county. Denominational schools have injured 
our city high schools, and town free schools must come to the front. The 
higher educators ought to find out the natural trend of things, and conform 
to it. 
G. P. Brown, of Illinois: The educational system of Indiana grew from 
the top—from the university. This is historically true. The high school 
is needed to supplement the common school. 
‘Wm. A. Mowry, of Massachusetts: I do not rise to discuss the question. 
I signed the report as a member of the committee, but question some of its 
suggestions. I came from a State where there are good town high sehools. 
The county high schools must be largely local, supplying, in the first place, 
the wants of the towns where they are located; but I do not yet see how the 
county high school can be more successful than the town and city high 
schools. 
Mr. CanrieLp: The committee has simple taken the facts, as reported to 
it. The facts show that there is virtually no legal recognition, or at least 
no adequate statutory recognition, of secondary education in the United 
States. The facts also show, as Mr. Mowry would have seen had he read
-P-A-G-E-391
  HIGHER EDUCATION OF THE RURAL POPULATION. 391 
  
his own report, that there are “very few States” in which the conditions of 
townships, in pupils or resources, permit the maintenance of successful town- 
ship high schools. 
W. T. Harris, of Massachusetts: I commend the report of Mr. Can- 
field as one of the best, both in form and matter, that has ever been pre- 
sented to the Council. The question of secondary education is one of the 
most important educational questions of the day; not so much, however, 
the increasing of accommodations for it, as the direction of it toward prep- 
aration for higher instruction. It is believed that the nation furnishes 
fewer students in colleges and universities pro rata, than it did forty years 
ago, while the number in the secondary schools has increased out of propor- 
tion. Our whole nation, and especially our cities, are suffering from the 
deficiency in college-educated men. It is to be considered that this is due 
to the rise of the public high school in the place of the old denominational 
academy. The high school aspires to be a sort of finishing-school; and its 
teachers do not keep before their pupils the desirability of entering college 
after graduating from it. In consequence of this, the senior year of the 
high school is inferior in its educative influence to the other years. In the 
preparatory school the senior year is by all means the most valuable in its 
effects, because there exists a strong tension of effort to prepare oneself to 
pass the examinations for college. It would be a great advantage to the 
pupils of our high schools if each one was required to choose, at the begin- 
ning of the senior year, some college, whose entrance examinations they 
were to pass, as a condition of receiving the diploma of the high school. 
They need not of course enter the college, but their efforts, during the year, 
to qualify themselves to do so, would be very salutary. Moreover, the 
teachers of the high school would be compelled to study carefully the col- 
lege demands, in order to prepare their pupils to meet them. They would in- 
vestigate the methods of higher education, and would be set in the way of 
growing themselves. The effect of such an arrangement would be to increase 
four-fold the number of pupils from our high schools that enter college. 
Comparatively few of the pupils, in selecting the college whose examina- 
tion they would take, would expect to go on beyond the high school; but as 
their interest in the preparation increased, their thoughts would naturally 
dwell on the college course; and when finally they had passed the entrance 
examinations, pupils and parents would, in numerous instances, resolve that 
the college course should be undertaken. This arrangement would improve 
the educative quality of high-school work, and, at the same time, would 
largely increase the number of college-educated men in all our cities and 
towns. The value of this on our,national life cannot be too highly esti- 
mated. Our political, our business, and our social life are all revealing 
deep questions relative to the welfare of the community. Anarchy on the 
one hand, and Socialism on the other, are setting forward their claims against 
the existing social forms and established laws. In many a specious shape

they win adherents from among the half-educated, or the naturally restless 
and discontented, in our population. The high-school graduate is far more 
able to grapple with such questions than the graduate of the elementary 
school; but he is as far below the average college graduate in ability to do 
this, as the elementary graduate is below him. It is evident that four years 
of severe discipline, added to secondary instruction, cannot fail to produce 
a greater maturity of mind. The higher studies involve the history and 
rationale of institutions, philosophy, literature, political economy, logic, and 
precisely such insight-giving studies as furnish the much-needed education 
for the leaders of public opinion. It is to be hoped that this question may 
be discussed, in some shape, every year in this Council. : 
D. L. Kirstie, of Minnesota: Let me explain the Minnesota plan in 
regard to State high schools. They are organized and controlled by the 
local board of education. They are received under the supervision of the 
State high-school board upon application, and receive from this board the 
sum of $400 per annum on condition that the high school is supported ac- 
cording to the rules of the board. These rules require the following con- 
ditions: 
1. The principal must hold the certificate of the State board. 
2. The school must support an approved course of study. 
3. Examinations must be held in every subject, when completed, with 
questions furnished by the State board. 
4. Each school must make a term report of attendance, work done, ete. 
5. Each school is visited annually by a representative of the State board. 
6. Each school must give free tuition to non-residents capable of entering 
the high school. 
The advantages of this system are very great. The school gets $400 to 
begin with ; it is stimulated and improved by its responsibility to the State; 
the county is supplied with high-school advantages; students receive certifi- 
cates which entitle them to admission to the freshman class of the Univer- 
sity, and are thus directed and encouraged toward a higher education. 
8. H. Peasopy, of Illinois: A large majority, probably two-thirds, of 
the young people of Illinois who have passed beyond the work of the pri- 
mary school but have not reached that of the college or university, have no 
legal standing in any school supported at public charge. The cities and 
larger towns support high schools of varied grades of excellence, from those 
which are such only in name, to those of the first class in the larger cities. 
But the pupils from the rural districts have no rights in such schools. To 
some they are welcome on payment of a reasonable fee; to others they may 
be admitted only at an exorbitant price, really meant to be prohibitory ; 
from some they are entirely debarred. Two, three or more rural townships 
may unite in supporting a secondary school; but the districts are sparsely 
settled, and this solution does not practically occur. The political unit next 
larger than the township is the county, a unit by which general public busi-
-P-A-G-E-393
  HIGHER EDUCATION OF THE RURAL POPULATION. 393 
ness is transacted much more commonly than is done in the Eastern States, 
and one to which we of the West’ may naturally look for the working out 
of a problem of such evident importance. 
E. E. Wutre, of Ohio: I simply wish to emphasize the necessity of doing 
something to bring secondary education within reach of country youth. The 
city and town high schools have destroyed most of the old academies, in 
which so many of us received our preparatory, or secondary educational in- _ 
spirations; and yet they do not take the place of the academy, so far as the 
educational interests of country youth are concerned. The schooling offered 
by the common school does not fit country youth to enter, with advantage, 
the high school, which is a part of a finer graded system. Besides, the cost 
of board in cities, the social life and habits of city youth, and the absence 
of home direction and control, make the city high school not the best school 
for country youth. The fact is that country youth are not going to the city 
and town high schools for secondary education, but to normal schools, pre- 
paratory departments of colleges, etc. If city and town high schools are to 
be depended upon for secondary education, there must be an adjustment be- 
tween these high schools and the common schools of the county. What is 
needed is the organization of secondary education, as the able report shows. 
Whether the high school is to be a county institution, or not, I do not at- 
tempt to decide; but there must be high schools within reach of country 
youth, and adapted to their needs and conditions.

REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON NORMAL EDUCATION. 
PROFESSIONAL AND ACADEMIC STUDIES IN NORMAL 
SCHOOLS. 
The normal schools in America are slowly coming to be recognized as an 
integral and essential part of the public-school system. They are no longer 
looked upon as alien to the system, but are more and more regarded as an 
outgrowth of it. 
. But normal schools have grown, and have conformed to their environ- 
ment. They differ widely in their organization, standard of admission, 
course of study, and correspondingly in their influence. There is general 
agreement in looking upon them as professional schools, designed primarily 
for the training of teachers for their work. They are not academies, high 
schools, colleges, or universities, but normal schools—teachers’ seminaries. 
Their work is above all things professional. 
When, however, it is asked, what are professional studies strictly so-called? 
there is a difference of opinion. What some would regard as professional, 
others would call academic studies. There is reason for this in the present 
condition of common schools. If a young lady in the country makes up 
her mind that she wishes to become a teacher, she is very likely to turn her 
steps toward the nearest normal school and apply for admission. On her 
examination, if she has had only such schooling as the average ungraded 
country school offered, she is likely to be found deficient in her knowledge 
of all the branches to be taught. A poor speller, an indifferent reader, un- 
skilled in the use of her native tongue, ignorant of geography beyond the 
memory of a mass of disconnected facts, with no comprehension of history, 
and no acquaintance with either the world of letters or the world of busi- 
ness, she does not even know how little she does know. Dr. Alden, then 
principal of the Albany Normal School, once said to the writer: “I assume 
that my pupils, when they enter the normal school, are absolutely ignorant 
of all the common branches of learning, and I accordingly begin to teach 
them the very rudiments.” 
It is a very common experience that even those who have had a grammar 
and high-school training, and who enter a normal school, are found to pos- 
sess no such independent mastery of the subjects they wish to teach, as will 
warrant the normal teacher in attempting to engraft professional instruction 
upon their shallow scholarship. 
This is not to be wondered at, perhaps, as the knowledge of the common 
branches acquired by children is almost certain to lack in thoroughness by 
reason of their immaturity, if-for no other cause. If to this be added the
-P-A-G-E-395
  NORMAL EDUCATION. 395 
hindrances to ripe scholarship growing out of the faulty methods of poor 
teachers, and over-crowded classes, it is not to be wondered at that normal 
teachers think it necessary to lay the foundations anew. 
Under these circumstances, it is natural that normal schools, which recruit 
their classes chiefly from those whose scholarship is so defective, should think 
it needful to attempt, first of all, to teach them the “three R’s.” This 
knowledge they must have. It is a condition precedent. Because they 
cannot teach without this knowledge, and because in so large a degree they 
come to the normal school without it, and because, in the present condition 
of things, other schools either cannot or will not impart that kind of instrue- 
tion that enables those who receive it to use it in teaching, normal schools 
seem almost forced to give elementary instruction. 
Besides, if normal schools raised their standards, and shut their doors 
upon all whose scholarship is defective, two disastrous results would follow: 
First, many normal schools would find themselves without pupils, and for 
this reason without popular support; second, the country schools that now 
are so largely helped by the normal schools would fail back upon the em- 
ployment of a lower grade of teachers than they now have. In this way 
the slowly rising standard of preparation for teaching everywhere apparent 
under the influence of the normal schools would be checked. 
We do not, therefore, think it can be denied that elementary instruction 
in the common branches given in a normal school as a preparation for teach- 
ing to those who cannot get it elsewhere, is in a low sense professional train- 
ing. 
Certain it is, that in many parts of the country such instruction must, as 
a matter of course and fact, continue to constitute a part of the work of the 
normal school. 
It must be admitted also, that as the work of the teacher is to arouse the 
mind, awaken lofty aspirations, inspire righteous impulses, develop charac- 
ter, whatever studies give to the teacher more breadth of view, greater in- 
tellectual energy, nobler character—in short, culture studies —are in a sense 
professional in their nature. It is the man who teaches; and he is the 
greater teacher who is the greater man. 
It should be borne in mind also that the common studies are not only the 
matter which the teacher must employ in teaching, and the chief means of 
giving to the teacher the requisite training — education — to enable teaching 
to be done, but it is preéminently true that all philosophizing about educa- 
tion, such as pedagogy involves, is meaningless to him who is ignorant of 
the facts on which he attempts to reason. 
Nevertheless, the work of education ought to be the same for all, and is 
properly the business of the common schools. The normal schools ought 
to, and perhaps the normal schools of the future will, leave to the common 
schools all academic work. Reading, writing, spelling, drawing, music, his- 
tory, rhetoric, literature, and the natural sciences—botany, mineralogy,

physics, chemistry —together with algebra and geometry, are excluded from 
professional studies, and have no proper place in a true normal-school cur- 
riculum. 
Psychology and logic are not distinctively normal-school studies. They 
belong to the range of culture studies. But they are indispensable to a 
science of teaching, and the relations they bear to pedagogy are so important 
and so many that they cannot be overlooked in any scheme of normal train- 
ing. 
Logic, as the science which sets forth the laws and processes of acquiring 
knowledge and communicating truth, has a special bearing upon the work 
of teaching. It is the solid foundation upon which rests all discussion of 
methods, and conditions every theory of mind-training. So long as it is not 
taught in the schools that furnish, for the most part, the pupils of the nor- 
mal schools, it certainly should find a place in the normal-school course. 
Psychology, the queen of the sciences, the source and key of all human 
inquiry, the revelation of self, ought to furnish a part of the equipment of 
every educated man and woman, and should be taught in every high school. 
But the normal school emphasizes the pedagogical phases of the science 
of mind, so that it becomes almost a new study to those who take it up in 
the normal school after having pursued it in a high school, academy, or 
college. 
The normal school has a specific function. It is a technical school. Its 
work is that of differentiation. It turns general culture to special ends. It 
trains school teachers. 
Some studies, such as pedagogy, theoretical, practical, historical, including 
methodology and methods, are clearly professional. They are for the teacher 
what theology and homiletics are for the preacher. Arithmetic, grammar, 
and geography occupy a debatable ground. They form an important 
trivium. The teacher cannot dispense with them. Arithmetic is the fountain 
of mathematics; grammar, the key of the entire range of language studies ; 
and geography, the mother of the sciences. 
As a body of facts and principles, arithmetic, grammar, and geography 
belong to culture studies. They are academic. As typical branches rep- 
resenting mathematics, language, and natural sciences, they may challenge 
a place in a normal curriculum. 
The central work of normal-school training is the discussion of the the- 
ory of education, educational values, methods of procedure, comparison of 
systems, and kindred topics that tend to put the candidate in possession of 
the philosophy of education, and to give technical skill in the art of teaching. 
With students who have been well trained in high schools, academies, or 
colleges, and with practice schools embracing all grades, from the kinder- 
garten to the high school, normal schools in the future may confine their 
theoretical instruction to a narrow range of studies that are distinctively 
professional. i

But, for, the present, normal schools must do a sort of work that should 
be done, but is not, and will not, and in many cases cannot, be done in the 
preparatory schools. It is academic work, and belongs to the acaderhy ; but 
as an indispensable part of the teacher’s equipment it must be had, and if 
it is not done in the preparatory school it must be in the normal school; 
and the normal school can justly claim that, under the circumstances, it is 
professional. 
COMMUNICATION FROM W. T. HARRIS. 
The question of a course of study in normal schools has interested me 
for many years. I have noticed that all normal-school work, in proportion 
as it becomes efficient, drifts into the same channel. It follows the tradi- 
tion of the first normal school in this country, as taught by Cyrus Peirce, 
at Lexington, fifty years ago this month. He took up the common ele- 
mentary studies—reading, arithmetic, geography, grammar, and history— 
and taught the students how to teach them, not merely how to learn them. 
In this respect the normal-school methods differed quite essentially from 
the methods of the high school or the grammar school. In the latter the 
pupil learns each branch as a step to the mastery of the next higher branch, 
while in the normal school he learns each branch of study as reflecting all 
other branches. For example, in the grammar school arithmetic is learned 
as a step toward algebra and geometry; in the normal school arithmetic is 
- explained through algebra and geometry. It is obvious that the normal- 
school course of study requires a thorough preparation on the part of its 
pupils at the start, not only in the common, but also in the higher Eng- 
lish branches; for as it is essentially a review of the common English 
branches in the light of the higher, it cannot be accomplished except by 
pupils thus well prepared in both. In the grammar school or in the high 
school these branches have been learned by themselves, but not in their re- 
lation to other branches. All knowledge is related, but the relations can- 
not be brought out on the first study of a subject. The ideal normal school 
would teach each branch in its relations to all human knowledge; but there 
are few, if any, such ideal schools, existing schools being limited either 
through the want of sufficient preparation on the part of the pupils, or 
through the want of broad and deep knowledge on the part of the teachers. 
The question is asked, why the teacher requires to be trained in a normal 
school, and taught to study each branch in the light of all others, when he 
must not use this method in teaching pupils of the grammar or high school 
—for it is evident that he must not teach arithmetic to primary pupils by 
algebraic demonstrations; nor primary geography through physical geog- 
raphy and its sciences of geology, botany, meteorology, and _zodlogy; nor © 
grammar through logic; nor history through jurisprudence and sociology. 
The answer is, that the teacher needs to understand the genesis of the 
branch he teaches in order to comprehend clearly the limitations of
-P-A-G-E-398
  398 NATIONAL COUNCIL OF EDUCATION. 
  
the child’s grasp of the subject, and to be able readily to see the 
difficulties that the child encounters. For the narrow first view of any 
subject,*logical and thorough as it may be, does not and cannot know 
anything of the mode and manner in which that subject is grounded 
in a more general and consequently more advanced branch of study, 
The teacher who knows no algebra, does not know how the rules of arith- 
metic are grounded in general formule. He cannot easily see where the 
difficulty of his dull pupil is liable to occur, and he cannot construct 
bridges for him. In fact, he cannot know arithmetic in a constructive sense 
without knowing algebra. Dana P. Colburn made an excellent arithmetic 
for use in normal schools, insomuch as it showed the algebraic basis of each 
process. He made mistakes, however, when he attempted to introduce the 
same methods into an arithmetic for more elementary pupils. He placed 
decimal fractions before vulgar fractions—a correct process in the normal 
school, where notation and numeration are taught in view of the whole the- 
ory of the decimal system, but confusing enough to the pupil learning arith- 
metic for the first time. Here was a result of not knowing the psychology of 
quantity. To comprehend a ratio requires more than twice as much intel- 
lectual effort as to understand a simple term. In ?, we have to think first 
3, and then 4, and then their relation— 3 as modified by 4, and 4 as modi- 
fied by 3. Three divided by four, therefore, requires three steps that must 
be retained all at once. In the lowest mind, a new subject crowds out the 
old one; it cannot hold two ideas at once. So the simplest mathematical 
mind can hold 3 or 4, but not }. Now if a vulgar fraction or a ratio is 
hard to think, when both the terms are stated explicitly and written out in 
full, it is still more difficult to handle a fraction where only the numerator 
is given, and you are obliged to make a mental calculation to deduce the 
denominator. A decimal fraction demands the complex thought required to 
think a ratio plus another more complex process of calculation, to determine 
the denominator. Hence the teachers who undertook the use of D. P. Col- 
burn’s “Common School Arithmetic” (and I was one of them) did not suc- 
ceed until they had inserted the subject of vulgar fractions as a step in 
teaching decimals, by writing out the denominators of the decimals, in all 
cases, until the pupils had become familiar with the process, and could 
supply the suppressed term mentally. To apply to this example what I 
have said regarding the explanation of pupils’ difficulties: it is evident that 
Mr. Colburn was an excellent teacher of arithmetic to normal pupils, so far 
as a deduction of rules is concerned, but that he did not understand the 
general theory of quantity, and consequently failed to see the psychology 
of the sequence of topics. The general theory of a subject is a clew to the 
’ psychology of learning it. His knowledge of algebra answered to reveal 
the psychology of the greater part of the process, and especially that of the 
construction of the rules; but to know the fundamental order of subjects 
requires the philosophy of quantity itself, which he does not seem to have
-P-A-G-E-399
  NORMAL EDUCATION. 399 
  
heard of. The philosophy of quantity shows three steps of comprehension : 
the first grasping simple numbers; the second grasping ratios of the first 
order, such as fractions and the “rule of three;” the third grasping the 
ratios based on involution and evolution—ratios expressed by powers. 
The last step is the hardest to understand, because there is, first, a relation 
of the simple number to itself—its product as multiplier and multiplicand 
to produce a power; and secondly, the index which shows how many times 
the operation is performed, or the power to which the number is raised. 
In the case of logarithms, all simple numbers are regarded as powers of a 
basal number, and only their indices are employed, the terms of the ratio 
being entirely suppressed. It is evident that no matter how well qualified 
the pupils are for admission to a normal school, the really professional work 
is involved in the review of the common branches in the light of the higher. 
It is evident, in the instance which I have briefly outlined, that in some 
cases the difficulty of the pupil in undertaking to learn a subject out of its 
place cannot be clearly explained, except by holding up the subject in the 
light of its most general theory. If the normal school spends time on 
higher studies, not before taken up by the pupil, those studies are not pro- 
fessional. Here, I think, a wide-spread error prevails. We often hear nor- 
mal-school teachers talk as if they wished that their pupils did not need to 
review the lower work, so that they might go on at once to the higher 
branches. But even the study of psychology, as such, is not so much of a 
professional study as is the applied psychology, formed by reviewing the 
lower studies in the light of the higher ones. I should call this latter work 
“educational psychology,” and the former “pure psychology,’ which may 
belong to colleges and universities as well as to normal schools. I would 
require a knowledge of such pure psychology as a condition of admission to ~ 
an ideal normal school. But with all their defects in the matter of prepara- 
tion, the normal schools of this land are moving in the track described by 
Edward Everett in his oration at the founding of the first normal school in 
Massachusetts —the track followed by Cyrus Peirce in carrying on that 
school. They have made and are making our best teachers. They make 
teachers who continue to grow, because their habit of taking every subject 
in its relations to other knowledge is a method that insures constant and 
perpetual growth.

DISCUSSION OF THE REPORT ON “ACADEMIC AND PROFES- 
SIONAL TRAINING.” 
[ReporTEeD By LILLE J. MARTIN.) 
Mr. Parr, of Indiana, thought that the paper presented the normal- 
school question from the outside. Another question, regarding the quality 
of work, had not been touched. He thought that logic should not be singled 
out more than chemistry. Logic only sets the pattern. A clear line should 
be drawn between general psychology and educational psychology. Their 
aims differ. General psychology treats of the mind from.a general stand- 
point; but educational psychology from a particular one. 5 
Mr. Wuirr, of Ohio, asked if the second were possible without the first. 
Mr. Parr thought not. He illustrated the point by drawing a compar- 
ison between general and medical chemistry. The trend of normal-school 
work had been to train students whose deficiencies in scholarship had to be 
made up. He thought that this had injured the normal schools by driving 
college students away. A college-bred man would become a center of in- 
fluence one hundred times wider than that of one who had been through the 
normal-school course only. 
Mr. Hanooox, of Ohio, thought that the characteristic work of the nor- 
mal school should be more closely defined. Many so-called institutions were 
doing good work, but not normal-school work. A visit to the classes of such 
institutions would prove his statement. 
Mr. Hooss, of New York: I hardly agree with the paper in regard to 
the place of logic and psychology. Logie is the subject that investigates 
the relations that exist between subject-matter and subject-matter —not the 
relations that exist between subject-matter and ego. Psychology includes 
the province of investigating the genesis and the procedure of mental activi- 
ties as they are related to subject-matter. The province of the normal school 
includes in its scope, (1) the study of mind and its activities under tuition; (2) 
the investigation of the nature of subject-matter as something to be learned ; 
and (8) the study of the modifications of mental activities as their form is 
conditioned by the nature and form of subject-matter which is learned by the 
mind. Psychology has two phases, (1) the mind as man—the race; all men 
possess the same number and generic forms of activities; and (2) each per- 
son has his characteristics that constitute his differentiated personality—e.g., 
his memory is greater or less than his neighbors, ete. The normal school 
must regard every child as a general being (race), and as a personality. 
The distinction made between general psychology and educational psy-
-P-A-G-E-401
NORMAL EDUCATION. 401 
  
chology is not well conceived. The older province of logic extended into the 
field of mental science, as the science is now outlined. Mind is formed by 
form of subject-matter. Mastery of subject-matter implies limitations in 
forms of activity. The terms “general development” are to be taken with 
caution. 
Mr. Hancock asked whether the mind could unfold only in certain di- 
rections. 
Mr. Hoose replied that mastery of any subject caused limitation. It 
would be desirable if the mind could be developed to complete mastery 
without limitations; but in history he found only limitations; and the older 
he grew, the more he was impressed with this fact. 
Mr. Hancock said it was just the opposite with him. 
Mr. Parr said that normal students should concern themselves with 
conscious education. He gave a list of subjects which he thought should be 
taught in normal schools, emphasizing educational psychology. . 
Mr. Hoos thought that general psychology should be taught, but that 
historical psychology might be omitted. 
Mr. Hancock asked if it would be possible to teach school weld without 
psychology. 
Mr. Hooss replied yes; because certain individuals are natural teachers. 
And when experienced teachers enter the normal as students, the question, 
“Why are you here?” does come up in his mind. 
It was then asked by some member if it did such students any good to 
attend a normal. Mr. Hoose thought it did, because it broadened their 
views. 
The objection was made by Mr. Parr to the view taken of the nor- 
mal school by Dr. Harris, that it failed to distinguish between the purpose 
and work of the college and that of the normal school. The function 
of the college is to yiew particular subjects in the light of all knowledge; 
that is, to unify the knowledge of the individual with that of the race. 
The working application of knowledge to particular ends is not considered. 
The power engendered is good for all purposes and is limited to no partic- 
ular one. The normal school has a purpose entirely distinct from this. It 
is designed to train its pupils in the power of looking at minds with a view 
to seeing how they may be stimulated to realize their inherent possibilities 
of power, and of that view of the world which the thought of the race has 
found it to be. This is a specific and particular end to be attained. It re- 
quires a knowledge of the mind to be developed, of how subjects and other 
means are to be used to stimulate growth, and of the progressive develop- 
ment of the teaching power. College education is academic; normal-school 
training is professional. Great harm comes from confusing two aims so rad- 
ically different as those of the college and the normal school. 
Mr. Ricuarps, of Washington, desired to say a few words on this impor-
-P-A-G-E-402
  402 NATIONAL COUNCIL OF EDUCATION. 
  
tant subject. Iam neither a normal-school teacher nor a normal-school grad- 
uate. Practically, I have never had any connection with normal schools, 
except that I have visited and examined the working character of a large 
number of normal schools. Yet, in a certain sense, I have been in a normal 
school for sixty years of my life. I have been a careful observer and student 
of the science and the art of teaching;. and I have been in a “training school” 
during the whole period; and I have probably wasted a great deal of time 
in experimenting, which would possibly have been saved if I had been per- 
mitted to enjoy the privilege of some judicious early professional training. 
But it seems to me this whole subject can be put into a “nut-shell.” The 
specific work of the normal school is generally acknowledged to be profes- 
sional, and not academical, and should be such as will fit teachers for the 
work of teaching, and not for the acquisition of knowledge. In other words, 
the real work of the normal school, it seems to me, should be: first, to teach 
. and train teachers how to teach such knowledge as the children of our country 
ought to acquire, in the shortest reasonable time, consistent with thorough- 
ness and practicality; second, to teach and train teachers how to organize, 
manage, and conduct economically and efficiently the schools which may be 
committed to their charge. The kind, amount and quality of the knowledge 
to be taught should be such as will accomplish the end desired; whether it 
be of psychology —which it seems must be ventilated on all occasions, as it has 
been here in this discussion; or of logic, or of tact, of skill, of experience, of 
judgment, of the mastery of science, of history, or of our language. I am 
strong in the belief, that if such normal schools can be established, and 
properly manned, as will require as a condition of admission a thorough ap- 
propriate examination upon the necessary prerequisites to a purely profes- 
sional course of training, similar to that now required of candidates who 
seek to enter our best colleges and universities, they would prove to be a 
success, and would readily secure the approbation of all good educators, and 
an abundant patronage. I am sure I should seek such an institution, if 
possible, if I should wish my son to be a trained teacher; and I believe this 
is the kind of normal school which the age demands. 
Mr. Greenwoon, of Missouri, said that he had spent seven years in 
normal schools. He thought that no standard could be fixed under the 
present conditions, for with the low requirements of the present time, only 
a comparatively small per cent. of the twenty-five thousand teachers of 
Illinois are graduates of normal schools. While most normal schools teach 
the same subjects as are taught in high schools, they teach them with a 
different aim. In the high schools, the purpose is to give the pupils a 
knowledge of the subject; in the normal school, the purposé is to give the 
students a knowledge of the presentation of the subject. In visiting normal 
schools throughout the United States, he found that this difference prevailed. 
Mr. Watre: Professional training presupposes scholarship and intellect- 
ual grasp. It is not possible to use a philosophic method in the professional
-P-A-G-E-403
  NORMAL EDUCATION. 403 
training of young people who have a limited knowledge of elementary 
studies. It seems to me that too many normal teachers are thrusting im- 
mature minds into (to them) a swamp of philosophy, and that the methods 
imposed do not fit those who try to use them. The harness is too large for 
the wearer; and this, leads me to say, that I have less and less confidence 
in the practical value of cut-and-dried methods imposed as normal train- 
ing. I would give more for a young teacher’s clear insight into the nature 
of the child, and her clear grasp of a few guiding principles of the teaching 
art, than I would for her elaborate and persistent training in methods. 
Cloth may be woven by pattern, but the human soul cannot be touched 
vitally and formed anew by pattern. The more a teacher knows of methods 
the better, provided she does not use them as an operative. Her methods 
must be her own, to be devised, it is true, not only under the guidance of 
sound principles, but in the light of the most fruitful experience of the 
best teacher. Young persons with a limited education are not prepared for 
philosophy. What they need to know are the simple facts of mind—its 
powers and processes. They must learn the facts before they can see the 
relation of facts to each other. I do not see how a branch of study can be 
taught to the best advantage, if at the same time the attempt is made to 
show the pupil how to teach the branch in elementary schools, except by 
example. Good methods of teaching may thus be “caught” by the pupil 
from a good example. This may explain the fact that the pupils of great 
teachers are so often skillful teachers without much special training. What 
is now needed, as it seems to me, is at least one normal school in each State 
of a high professional character ; a school with a high standard of admission ; 
a school that teaches school branches as an illustration of true methods 
without wasting time on teaching elementary studies; a school that is able 
to teach the science of pedagogy successfully. The course of training in 
such a school may be of the kind commended to us. 
Mr. Ayn, of Illinois, as the presenter of the report, at the close of the 
general discussion said that he was glad that the normal schools did admit 
students who had not acquired an academical education. The normal school 
thus touched the lower third, and for his part he was glad of it. Christ 
began there. It was the base of the column. If you raise the base, you 
must raise the whole column; but if you raise the top, you do not neces- 
sarily raise the base.

REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON HYGIENE IN EDUCATION. 
HARMONIOUS DEVELOPMENT. 
[PREPARED AND PRESENTED By W. N. HatLMany.] 
In life-development harmony implies fitness, agreement, adaptation to 
some more or less manifest purpose of being or becoming. The adapta- 
tions of the parts and functions of an organism to its life, of organisms 
among each other for some common interest, or of organisms to their envi- 
ronment, present material for the study of such adaptations. Strictly, it 
is true these adaptations never are perfect. They never fully deserve the 
title of harmonies. They always hold somewhat of dissonance—are har- 
monious in tendency only, but not in achievement. 
Here, as elsewhere, Nature is imperfect, and only approximates her ends; 
but man, through the application of his intellect, may discover the harmo- 
nious tendencies that lie concealed in these approximations. On the basis 
of such knowledge, he may aid Nature, and with the help of his art con- 
sciously lead her nearer to the goal. This he does in the field, in the gar- 
den, in the care of domestic animals. This he is gradually learning to do 
in the education of his offspring, and in his administration of social forces. 
Harmony is not synonymous with balance or rest. Harmony lies only 
in adaptation to a purpose; balance or rest may become proximate purposes 
of being or becoming, and the adaptation of parts and functions to this 
purpose will then constitute a harmony. This term, however, has no refer- 
ence to the state of rest as such, but only to the effect of this state on the 
whole. 
Nor is harmony synonymous with the “right mean” of Aristotle—a 
thought, faulty in conception and pernicious in its applications. In educa- 
tional practice it furnishes ideals resting on average instead of full possibil- 
ities, and establishes artificial leveling processes that lead to the apotheosis 
of mediocrity and to social quasi-petrifaction. Virtue is not the “right 
mean” between the two vices of deficiency and excess, but the steady march 
in the right direction. This direction is established on the rock of princi- 
ple, not on the sand of expediency. It leads, not between two extremes 
which are both bad, but from one extreme which is bad to another which is 
good. Courage is not a “right mean” between cowardice and foolhardiness, 
which are, both of them, deficiencies lying on different sides of our being. 
Courage is a double virtue that leads man away from both of these vices. 
The highest harmony is not on the level of mediocrity, but on the pinnacles 
of genius. 
Harmony in development has no essential reference to the parts or things
-P-A-G-E-405
  HARMONIOUS DEVELOPMENT. 405 
harmonized, but only to the purpose for which it issought. Its keynote lies 
wholly in the purpose. In the measure in which parts or things fit the 
purpose, do they harmonize. In all approximations of harmony, then, the 
purpose is the constant; parts, things, or functions involved in the whole are 
the variables. Hence all tinkering with the purpose is evil, is born of weak- 
ness, pertains to expediency, leads away from the true purpose, and establishes 
false purposes. t 
Tn our thought of harmony, this fact should constantly be emphasized: 
whatever agreement of parts, things or functions it implies, it does imply 
this agreement always and only with reference to the effect of this agreement 
on the whole, with reference to the common purpose. The harmony is al- 
ways a mean, never an end; the end is ever the purpose of this harmony. 
As an educational principle, harmony should be viewed, (a) with refer- 
ence to its essential character, in its static and dynamic aspects; (6) with 
reference to human happiness, in its subjective and objective aspects; and 
(c) with reference to human duty, in its individual and universal aspects. 
Static harmony is the harmony of equilibrium, of rest, of matter, of the 
physical, of mechanism, of space; it is external, the essence of beauty and 
grace; it belongs to ideas and language. Dynamic harmony is the harmony 
of action, of development, of the spiritual, of self-activity, of time; it is in- 
ternal, the essence of truth and efficiency; it belongs to ideals and thought. 
As the very terms imply, static harmonies are of the actual and phenom- 
enal, of what has become and is; dynamic harmonies are of the potential 
and ideal, of what is becoming or ought to be. Static harmonies relate to 
enjoyment, to happiness; dynamic harmonies relate to duty, to work, and . 
joy. In static harmonies man is established; in the dynamic harmonies he 
is free. Static harmonies constitute the realm of the intellect; dynamic 
harmonies, the realm of reason. 
It is scarcely necessary to subject to further analysis the antitheses in- 
volved in these enumerations. The respective characteristics of being and 
becoming, conveyed in the terms static and dynamic, are common to all of 
them. Yet, although development, which is the object of educational activ- 
ity, is essentially dynamic, it would be premature to confine our attention 
to the dynamic harmonies, or even to assign to them relatively much greater 
practical importance than we are willing to accord to static harmonies. 
Proximately, at least, the ends of dynamic progress lie in static achieve- 
ment. Development, in its successive phases, appears as a continuous 
stream of static achievements—as a continuous translation of ideal tend- 
‘ency into phenomenal condition. The potential truth which, dawning to- 
day in my innermost, spurs me on to action, will to-morrow reward me in the 
increased actual beauty of my surroundings. The work and joy of my to- 
day will constitute the happiness of my to-morrow. What to-day engages 
my reason and thought will to-morrow enrich my intellect and language. 
My ideal. of to-day will to-morrow be my idea. And nothing persists in

these unceasing transitions but der drang des neuen werdens, my increasing 
onward attitude. i 
It appears, then, that the static harmonies require constant and unweary- 
ing attention, inasmuch as through them alone dynamic harmonies can be 
maintained. They alone furnish a safe measure of actual achievement, and 
reliable vantage-ground for further progress. Thus, the dynamic oarsman 
is powerless without the static resistance of water; without the static forces 
of friction, machinery fails to propagate motion; without the static treasures 
of inertia, the world would return to the void whence it sprang; without the 
static vigor of heredity, human self-consciousness, with its precious gains, 
would forever linger in the shadowy realms of the hopelessly potential. 
Thus, static and dynamic harmonies are found to be in no way antago- 
nistic. They are but different sides of the same one unending harmony of 
development, viewed at one time in its actual achievements and momentary 
status, and at another in its unceasing promise—in its persistent drift and 
tendency. 
With reference to human happiness, harmony in development presents a 
subjective side, which relates to our tastes and notions of pleasure, to our 
moral sense, our sympathies, our sense of duty and right, our self-esteem and 
enthusiasm; and an objective side, which relates to our altruistic tendencies, 
to whatever we recognize as truth and goodness in our surroundings (and 
even in ourselves, objectively considered), to matters of general welfare, 
justice, equity, law, and necessity. Whatever objective harmonies have 
reached consciousness are gathered in insight, which reacts in conduct as 
virtue. 
Much failure in life, much physical break-down and mental wreck result 
from false attitude with reference to these harmonies. A life attuned to sub- 
jective key-notes is sure to end in some sort of wretchedness; is frittered 
away in attempts to gratify narrowly esthetic considerations; is exhausted 
in a purposeless pursuit of pleasure; becomes entangled in superstition, in 
immature notions of duty and right, false prides and false modesties, per- 
verted ideals of honor and dignity; or is bagged in hopeless traps of fanati- 
cism and other corruptions of enthusiasm. The reason for this is obvious. 
Well-being on which happiness depends is conditioned, primarily, by our 
degree of adaptation to surroundings, and, ultimately, by the agreement of 
our ideals with the laws and necessities of universal drift and tendency, the 
objective laws of truth and goodness. 
Salvation, then, can lie only on the objective side. All key-notes of sub- 
jective harmonies must be sought here. Our tastes and notions of pleasure, 
our moral sense and sympathies, our self-esteem and enthusiasm, must accord 
with the laws or objective necessities of being and becoming. 
Here too, however, no essential antagonism is implied between subjective 
and objective harmonies. Here, too, the two are but sides of the same one 
life-harmony. Indeed, a disregard of the subjective side of this one har-
-P-A-G-E-407
HARMONIOUS DEVELOPMENT. 407 
mony in life produces failure from lack of intensity, as surely as does the 
opposite fault from excess of intensity. The inward and outward sides, both, 
demand equal solicitude on the part of education. The value of the object- 
ive is judged in the depths of feeling. The inner worth of the subjective 
is tested in its objective outcome. In full life-harmony, both the objective 
and the subjective, law and happiness, insight and virtue, sing the same song. 
We should not confound subjective and objective harmonies on the one 
hand with individual and universal harmonies on the other. The first of 
these distinctions refers more to condition, to the static; the latter, to pur- 
pose, the dynamic side of life-harmony. 
Individuality is an incident of multiplicity, the daughter of space and 
time. There is nothing essential in it; it belongs wholly to the phenome- 
nal. It implies relation of parts, a unity of inner purpose and functional 
life. This unity of functional life with reference to an inner purpose con- 
stitutes the individual harmony. 
In a simple being there is no harmony. Even Leibnitz does not find his 
preéstablished harmony in his monad. It is absent even between the body 
and soul of his monad; for he considers these as mere incidents, as differ- 
ently disposed, in themselves, unsubstantial forces of this same substantial 
monad. But as soon as the simple being enters into relations with others 
and unites with these for a common purpose (of relation), the accomplish- 
ment of this purpose depends on the mutual aapanee of behavior with 
reference to this common purpose. 
Education is concerned, directly at least, only with the exceedingly com- 
plex individuality of the human being. Whatever interest it has in the 
various individual organs and functions, is subordinate to this interest in the 
individual human being. It has no concern with the deeper analyses in the 
direction of the quasi-ultimate individualities of cell-life or of transcend- 
ental chemistry. The individual human being is its unit of interest. For- 
tunately, however, the very complexity of the human individual affords a 
clew and an illustration of the nature of individual and universal harmony. 
Each subordinate individuality that enters into the constitution of the hu- 
man individual has, with reference to itself, an individual harmony; and, 
with reference to the human being, a universal harmony. In individual 
harmony, each constituent subordinate individual finds its individual pur- 
pose within itself; the harmony is inward, centripetal. In universal har- 
mony, each constituent individual finds its purpose in a larger self of which 
it is a part: the harmony is outward, centrifugal. Individual harmony, 
then, exists with reference to individual purpose. Universal harmony im- 
plies inordination of individual purpose in universal purpose, a life unfold- 
ing. within the evolving harmonies of greater wholes. 
Strictly, a life of exclusive individual harmony is unthinkable. An ex- 
clusively centripetal life —inward, self-contracting —is necessarily suicidal. 
True life implies selfexpansion; its fundamental condition is self-sacrifice,
-P-A-G-E-408
  408 NATIONAL COUNCIL OF EDUCATION. 
Even in its narrower forms of self-adaptation for the purposes of self, there 
lies an outward, expansive tendency, a certain degree of respect and love for 
other and greater wholes. 
In universal harmony will is born. It begins in organic life in the in- 
stinct of self-preservation, the preservation of the inner relations of a cer- 
tain more or less complex organic whole. Blindly, at first, and in the 
wasteful, groping methods of natural selection, more seeingly, later on, 
and in the methods of enlightened artificial selection, it creates, modifies 
and suppresses parts and functions for the sake of the organic whole. This 
very subordination of part interests to the interests of the whole, generates 
in the whole a condition of objectivity, an outward look, and plants in the 
individual as a whole a tendency and readiness of subordination to the pur- 
poses of greater wholes. 
As to these are added a growing sense of power and an increasing feeling 
of responsibility, there results in attitude and conduct inward and outward 
mastership, a control of self with reference to universal relations that has 
all the appearance of control of the latter. Subordination becomes inordi+ 
nation. The purpose of the universal self has become the purpose of the 
individual self, and blossoms forth in deliberate self-denial, and in joyous 
self-sacrifice for the sake of a more universal whole. 
Here too, are laid bare the mysteries of righteousness, the attitude of gen- 
erous, joyous, unquestioning obedience to universal law which has become 
the conscious inner law of our being. 
The task of education in the work of harmonious development is to seek 
a harmony which shall unite all these phases of life-attitude and life-work ; 
a harmony that shall reconcile, respectively and collectively, the static and 
dynamic, the subjective and objective, the individual and universal. 
With reference to the essential, static and dynamic, character of such a 
harmony, nature accomplishes this in a blind sort of a way in play. Here 
dynamic effort rests at every point on static achievement. Blindly, too, in 
the extra-conscious regions of hereditary instinct, and in the semi-conscious 
regions of dawning experience, play harmonizes to a limited extent, and 
vaguely the requirements of subjective pleasure and objective well-being, as 
well’as individual and universal purposes. Laboriously, and rarely on the 
right road, a crude, groping empiricism rescues: from the wrecks of a sense- 
less natural -selection scanty shreds of knowledge, and a reluctant sporadic 
control of the subjective and individual sides with reference to the objective 
and universal requirements of life. 
At last, and apparently in man alone, knowledge as such becomes a 
source of pleasure; scientific interest is born; these shreds are gathered, 
arranged and related with reference to a variety of subjective and objective 
criteria; the mutual dependence of self and not-self begins to be seen and 
appreciated; blind natural selection is, at first, aided, and then more or less 
deliberately replaced by a seeing artificial selection; the survival of the
-P-A-G-E-409
  HARMONIOUS DEVELOPMENT. 409 
fittest becomes the survival of the most obedient; the reign of chance is 
-over; the servile drift-period of laissez-faire is past; foresight is at the helm; 
art rules supreme; man is free, and nature does his bidding: henceforth his 
life is a process of deliberate self-expansion. 
Thus we behold the process of development as the expression of the grow- 
ing-harmony of being. At every point it addresses itself to the inner life. 
It is the revealing of inner tendencies and possibilities, the growing asser- 
tion of inner tendencies and possibilities in outer life. It accomplishes the 
purposes of being which lie in self-expansion. Self-activity is its law. 
Adaptation, obedience, love, are its method. In education it has no reference 
to subjects of instruction, nor even to objects of interest, but only to psychic 
process. Objects of interest furnish the material, and subjects of instruc- 
tion determine the scope of development, but they are in themselves in no 
way developing or being developed. 
Again, development in no way involves suppression of natural energies, 
but rather guidance into right, 7. ¢., harmonious channels. Lastly, har- 
monious development is not “equal development of mind or body,” nor 
even equal development of the respective faculties among themselves, but 
rather adequate development with reference to the purpose of being. Its 
aim is organization for a common end. Its law, with reference to the re- 
spective shares of parts in the development of the whole, is the law that 
controls the circulation of the blood, ubi irritatio, ibi adfluxus. 
It is gratifying to find that the best educational thought of modern times, 
from Luther to Froebel, corroborates the value and need of harmonious 
development in education. Luther’s entire energy was devoted to the restora- 
tion of character as the ruling fact in individual life, and to the reéstablish- 
ment of the conviction that the true worth of character lies in its harmony 
with God’s command. Comenius finds the end of man in the “attainment 
of eternal happiness in and with God.” Being created in God’s image, man 
“must know all things, control all things, including himself, refer every- 
thing, including himself, to God, the source of all things”—a notable utter- 
ance which holds the essence of all later formulas. 
Rabelais would, above all things, establish the student’s character. It is 
in order to strengthen this and to give it wider scope and greater efficiency 
in conscious life that he would have Pantagruel “plunge into an ocean of 
knowledge.” Character gives purpose to life, and all else is to serve this 
purpose, to harmonize with this. Montaigne mercilessly scourges the one- 
sided cramming practices of his time, and finds the only worthy gain of study 
in greater life-efficiency, in whatever increments of wisdom and virtue it 
brings. Similarly, Locke looks upon firmness of character as the chief end 
of educational work: the purpose of the sciences is to furnish compass and 
chart as well as other knowledge needful in the journey of life, but character 
is at the rudder always. A similar tendency we notice in Rousseau, who 
subordinates all he does to the purpose of forming a human being.
-P-A-G-E-410
410 NATIONAL COUNCIL OF EDUCATION. 
Pestalozzi clearly places the purpose of education in “all-sided harmo- 
nious development of all human faculties.” He declares that “All culti- 
vation of isolated faculties is opposed to the pure flow of life and natural 
development.” In these words he surely gives little support to hosts of 
pseudo-followers who hammer away at particular faculties, and at particular 
subjects of instruction. 
“Nature gives talents; education gives character!” exclaims Herbart, 
perhaps the most brilliant of Pestalozzi’s followers. To this character he 
attunes all the various interests, from the empirical and sympathetic to the 
speculative and religious. He demands that these interests be gleichschwe- 
bend, harmonious —1. ¢., equally ready at all times to enter into activity, so 
that “each one might be,a success as a king, were it needful.” 
“To be a human being,” says Diesteryeg, the prince of practical teachers, 
“is to be self-active in the pursuit of rational aims”’—a rich saying, that 
regards every requirement of harmonious development. Rosenkranz ex- 
presses the same thought with almost equal terseness when he demands that 
“the education of the state should furnish a preparation for the unfettered 
activity of self-conscious humanity.” Herbert Spencer’s “complete living,” 
too, holds the same thought. And yet the average school goes on lifting 
intelligence one-sidedly, and with mere miserly minima of reference to mo- 
rality and inner peace, to outer and inner harmony. 
Froebel sets forth unification, which_is but another term for harmony, as 
the aim of education in all its phases and aspects. Unification with self, 
i.e., harmony of insight, purpose, and power of static and dynamic life; 
unification with surroundings, 7. e., harmony of subjective and objective be- 
ing; unification with the universe and with God, i. e., harmony of individual 
and universal purpose. His law of the union of contrasts in development 
is the very soul of harmony. “The teacher,” he says, “should make the 
particular and individual general, the general particular and individual, 
and elucidate both in life; he should make the external internal, and the 
internal external, and indicate the necessary unity of both; he should con- 
sider the finite in the light of the infinite, and the infinite in the light of 
the finite, and harmonize both in life; he should see and perceive the divine 
essence in whatever is human, trace the nature of man to God, and seek to 
exhibit both within one another in life.” In spite of the wordy heaviness 
of this utterance, it seems difficult to conceive of a more comprehensive 
and more thoroughly consistent statement of the requirements of harmoni- 
ous development. 
Froebel sees in creativeness man’s practical destiny which can be accom- 
plished only in work. But work, alone, which deals with the material in 
life; draws man away from the ideal; leads man astray in the wilderness of 
barren external utility. Therefore, Froebel connects work with the devel- 
opment of social sympathy and the sense of the beautiful, as a counterpoise 
to this tendency of work. He spiritualizes labor in its purposes, and mech-
-P-A-G-E-411
HARMONIOUS DEVELOPMENT. All 
anizes it only in the skill involved. This he accomplishes by linking the 
first creative efforts of childhood with play, which is nature’s harmonious life. 
This play he organizes and leads up to philosophy and art, which, respect- 
ively, sum up man’s highest achievements in the inner and outer phases of 
harmony in fully-developed conscious life. 
The method of education, then, seems to be clearly indicated. Inasmuch 
as the static harmonies record the achievements of the dynamic harmonies, 
the former can be reached only through the latter. Yet all dynamic effort 
should rest on static achievement, both in subjective and objective condition, 
in individual and universal purpose. It will be observed that in this work, 
teacher and pupil hold a significant relative position. The teacher répre- 
sents the respectively objective and universal sides of fuller life-harmony, 
seeking in conscious activity to lift the subjective and individual sides em- 
phasized in the child to a growingly conscious consonance with itself. His 
constant endeayor is to maintain mutually conscious contact with the child’s 
condition and purpose; patiently resting his efforts on these; persistently 
straining these in the measure of their strength in the outward and upward 
tendencies of the dynamic course he represents. This constitutes what Froe- 
bel calls “living with the children.” With reference to the fuller life-har- 
mony, teacher and pupil are one; the teacher supplementing the pupil’s lack 
in knowledge, purpose, and self-direction. As he supplies these, or rather 
as the pupil gains these in their mutual life, he gradually recedes from the 
union, leaving the man to sing his own song. 
Although the application of principles of method in the details of practice 
lies beyond the limits of this report, it is desirable to test the principle just 
enounced in some of the larger relations. The teacher stands nearest the child 
in the mother. In her hand lie all the beginnings of the child’s individual 
life. For the initial period of child-culture, our principle would demand on 
the mother’s part deepest, almost intuitive, insight into the nature of the in- 
dividual child and into child-nature as such; keenest sympathy with all the 
utterances of childish emotion; most reverential regard for all the tender 
germs of energy; greatest devotion; fullest love; most complete self-abne- 
gation in the teacher's life with the child. She is at the very soul of the 
work. The child appears almost as material in her hands. So great are 
the drafts upon her powers, that, simultaneously, she can fully satisfy the 
needs of but one child... Yet, even in the most arduous phases of her work, 
she seems merely to live out the innermost needs of her own nature. To of- 
fer renumeration would seem an insult. 
At the other extreme stands the college, where the teacher, with refer- 
ence to the individual pupil, is reduced to a minimum of leadership. He 
appears less as a responsible guide, than as a superior friend or associate in 
a common endeavor. His knowledge of his pupil friend, although desira- 
ble, is of infinitely less value than his knowledge of the road and land-marks 
that lead to the goal which both, teacher and pupil, seek consciously. His 
 
-P-A-G-E-412
  412 NATIONAL COUNCIL OF EDUCATION. 
love for his pupil friend is of less weight than his devotion to aim and 
method. So little is he at the soul of the pupil’s work that all self-assertion 
on his part seems obtrusive, and proves more frequently a hindrance than 
a help; so that self-teaching frequently, and in many cases not without rea- 
son, is looked upon as superior to college-teaching. Education is narrowed 
down to instruction. So scanty, on the part of each pupil, are the demands 
upon his powers, that his limits of simultaneous instruction lie almost wholly 
in physical conditions. So little does he, in his relations with the pupil 
friend, live out the needs of his own nature, that highest remuneration 
seems his just due for his services. 
Again, returning to the method of education, it should be remembered 
that the subjective side of static harmony can prosper only on the soil of 
the objective side; that subjective happiness is attainable and can be main- 
tained only on the basis of objective laws of truth and goodness, or, proxi- 
mately, on condition of some objective, relatively general, welfare. A life 
based on subjective notions of pleasure, antagonizes its surroundings. In 
the struggle for supremacy, failures alternate successes; these become less 
and less frequent, as well as less and less enduring, and, at last, there come 
utter discomfiture and misery unending. s 
On the other hand, a life that bases its happiness on considerations of 
general welfare, finds in its surroundings grateful allies. It flows on ina 
stream of inner success, which widens and deepens with its scope and com- 
prehensiveness with reference to its objective phases. 
It is therefore needful to adjust the child’s surroundings from the very 
start in such a way that his subjective notions of pleasure may be gratified 
without injury or discomfort to the surroundings, and subsequently even in 
the way of active aid to external well-being. This will accustom him to 
conditions of external welfare as related to inner well-being. More and 
more consciously he will learn to relate the two, to look upon the former 
almost as a symptom of the latter, and to secure the latter by establishing 
the former. Thus, habit is established on objective considerations; and this 
habit furnishes safe vantage-ground for the development of keen discrimi- 
nation between friendly and hostile factors in the surroundings; for the 
up-building of determination and courage in aggressive and defensive life, 
with reference to whatever proves hostile to right living; in short, for the 
establishment of vigorous benevolence and unflinching love of truth as the 
central forces of a truly efficient and blissful life. 
At no time should education sacrifice considerations of truth and good- 
will to expediency. At no time should it secure action on the ground of 
discomfiture of persons and conditions, not hostile to truth and good-will. 
At no time should the pupil enjoy aught at the expense of others, or suffer 
unjustly for the enjoyment of others. At no time should falsehood or malice 
bring him fleeting success, or their opposites expose him to undeserved 
failure.
-P-A-G-E-413
  HARMONIOUS DEVELOPMENT. 413 
Ample illustrations of more or less pernicious infraction of this principle 
might be found in the disciplinary regulations, the marking and prize sys- 
tems, various modes of examination and promotion, the hazing practices, 
debating-clubs, and other pagan devices that still linger in current educa- 
tional practice. On the other hand, most consistent provisions for obeying 
this principle in practice are abundant in the Froebelian kindergarten, and 
in the primary school organized in accordance with Froebel’s thought. But 
the detailed presentation of these things does not fall within the limits of 
my report. 
Similar considerations apply to the third law of educational method, which 
formulates the truism that, with reference to the purposes of life, the indi- 
vidual ‘can find true, 7. e., complete, life only in harmony with universal 
purpose. In its effort to establish this harmony, the individual is aided at 
every step by the universal. All hostility or neglect on- the part of indi- 
vidual with reference to universal purpose leads to defeat, and —if persisted 
in—ends in exclusion, isolation, death, in some form of banishment. Uni- 
versal purpose comes to us as a law, in its highest form the law of righteous- 
ness; and every infraction dooms the offender to some harvest of failure. 
Thus universal law, always relentlessly persistent, at last enforces some de- 
gree of attention; and this degree of attention on the part of relatively in- 
dividual life measures its efficiency. 
In proximate universals— family, society, church, state —which look upon 
the individual human being as a constituent part of themselves, this aid is 
given more or less consciously in government. - Frequently, it is true, they 
usurp education and seek to defeat its wider aims and to confine its work 
within the scope of their own respectively individual purposes. Each strives, 
in its turn, to instill in the human individual merely a wider selfishness—a 
family selfishness, a church selfishness —rather than to establish in the suc- 
cessively wider life of all these circles the common law of righteousness as 
an ever-reliable guide outward.and upward. Even the school often sins in 
this way, setting up its own individual purpose as a norm, and sacrificing to 
this the children and its own true success in vain efforts to defeat the uni- 
versal purpose which is born anew in each new child. 
Nevertheless, in spite of these short-comings and errors on the part of 
proximate universals in the social life of man, the influence of their efforts 
in the individual life of each human being tends to the establishment of uni- 
versal harmony. It gives the individual with reference to himself the out- 
ward and upward tendency; it gives him practice in the inordination of self 
in not-self; it establishes the habit of regarding the wider harmony as lead- 
ing. Thus, it imparts an outward and upward impetus that urges him 
against the arbitrary confines established by the usurper, generating the 
SS otnbdacy and reformatory forces that ultimately break these confines 
and liberate mankind from their restraint. 
Education should not, however, be satisfied with this. Revolutionary and
-P-A-G-E-414
414 NATIONAL COUNCIL OF EDUCATION. if 
reformatory forces in their operations are attended with excessive waste of 
energy, life, and happiness. “ If education has any justification, this must be 
sought in its influence in the taming and subjection of these blind natural 
forces in social development, or its tendency and deliberate endeavor to 
place these evolutionary forces under the control of enlightened ‘self-con- 
sciousness. 
In all directions and from the very beginning—even where personified 
in the mother, its direct activity is exclusively with individual purpose— 
education should adjust surroundings so as to arouse spontaneous desire in 
the directions of universal purpose. Later on, the social instinct — the in- 
ner prompting for association with equals—should be placed under deliber- 
ate, systematic training, as Froebel aimed to do in the kindergarten; and as 
: your reporter has been struggling to do in the elementary school. 
Education should lead the pupil step by step into full possession of his 
social nature, even as it seeks to give him control of his individual nature. 
He should know and appreciate in a truly living manner the superior value 
of common endeavor, of united effort over merely individual exertion, of 
centrifugal living over centripetal dying. He should learn to place a right 
estimate upon himself in his relations to the whole, and to establish it in 
generous self-assertion. He should learn to see the futility of narrow self- 
aims, and to feel the lofty fervor that rewards rational self-sacrifice. In the 
learner’s life the leadership of duty should gradually be acknowledged on 
the ground of free insight; the harmonies of happiness should be taught to 
follow this leadership with an eagerness that proceeds from enlightened, un- 
questioning faith. 
The results of these considerations lose none of their value by the limi- 
tations that dynamic advance rests at every point on static achievement; 
that the objective harmonies of truth and goodness can become effective 
only in full fusion with subjective taste; that universal purpose can be 
served only in the measure of individual efficiency. 
It has been shown with sufficient clearness that static achievement is but 
a moment which serves as the measure of dynamic advance. Subjective 
taste would sleep the endless sleep of infinitely remote possibility, were it 
not for the objective harmonies. These alone can lift taste into actuality, 
and into ever fuller agreement with ideals of truth and goodness, which hold 
all that is persistent in these harmonies. Without a higher universal pur- 
pose, without the instinct of ideality that comes from community of interest, 
without the heaven that lies in conscious union with a whole, individual 
efficiency would find itself in a hopeless, helpless isolation that constitutes 
the very essence of endless misery, and which could find relief only in 
destruction. 
To lead man away from such isolation, to establish him more and more 
firmly on the rock of right inner habit by processes that confirm the good 
and exclude the evil which may be in him, is the business and glory of edu-

  HARMONIOUS DEVELOPMENT. 415 
  
cation. The young human being has a tendency to refer all things to nearer 
and more obvious harmonies. The friction of progress is too great for his 
energies, and he loves to settle down on his achievements in self-extolling 
conservatism. Subjective pleasure is so sweet to him, and so real, that ob- 
jective truth and goodness, which demand self-control, seem to him almost 
hostile forces. Happiness seems so near a thing, and its material, tools and 
furniture are so temptingly close and abundant, that the blessedness which 
lies in duty and self-denial appears to him as a visionary star, a chimerical 
illusion, that has no real existence. He delights to revel in the outer 
beauty of things, and shrinks from the effort to discover and to possess the 
inner law of which this beauty is but a fleeting manifestation. In short, he 
wastes his power in the enjoyment of life-attainment, however meager, and 
has nothing left for the deeper necessities of life-purpose. 
It is obvious that this tendency, left to itself, must result in more or less 
serious reversion and loss of character. Now and then favorable conditions 
may create environments that arouse these deeper necessities of life-purpose, 
and mankind is blessed with some self-made excellence. This may shine as 
much, perhaps, by contrast with surrounding inferiority as by its own supe- 
riority, but it is nevertheless a beacon-light that lifts the race to a higher 
place. 
It is the business of education to establish such environment for every 
human being, to hold within the reach of each one the remoter harmonies, 
leading him to fashion his narrower purpose more and more consciously, 
and more and more spontaneously in the light of higher and wider aims of 
life; teaching him to be an individual in the light of ever-widening circles 
of citizenship —a citizen in the light of ever-expanding spheres of humanity. 
Great is the mischief done by the school when it fails to comprehend its 
mission in this respect, and falls a prey to narrowing tendencies; when, in 
the short-sighted pride of self, it excludes the ideal from its work, and fails 
to see the essentially practical value of the ideal; when, in sterile methods 
of endless verbal recitation and probing, it seeks to reap while it sows, and 
is satisfied to reap the mere shadows of what it has sown; when, laying 
stress on achievement alone, it neglects tendency and attitude; when, in the 
toils of a self-seeking expediency, it sacrifices considerations of principle 
and bases its success on incentives of immediate arbitrary reward and pun- 
ishment which cause the soul of man to shrink, and bury budding power 
beneath the ashes of greed and self-distrust. 
It is not within the scope of this report to criticize existing educational 
practice. Yet, for purposes of illustration and proof, we might find much 
in current school legislation, school organization, and school practice, much 
in our courses of study and programs, in our discipline and government, 
that could not stand before open-eyed and open-hearted scrutiny. 
Thus, we find throughout that harmonious development is a process of 
adaptation between a dependent inner and a relatively independent outer.  
-P-A-G-E-416
_ 416 NATIONAL COUNCIL OF EDUCATION. 
In the consciousness of man this culminates in obedience, which, according 
to Herbart, is “the first attribute of good-will.” 
To this, experience and thought add insight. The adaptation becomes so 
ready, and is practiced with such deliberate foresight, that it appears spon- 
taneous, and seems to compel the external. In truth, however, man has 
learned to control and direct himself as a natural force with reference to 
other natural forces. He, 7. ¢., his insight, rises superior to the impulses that 
originate in the relatively external of his.complex make-up. Sensation- 
learns to direct motion consciously. The unconscious or sub-conscious has 
no further voice in conduct. Consciousness, seated on the throne of reason, 
alone rules. He is free, and in the measure of his freedom is his conscious 
adaptation to law, his obedience perfect. In his conduct the inner and 
outer have become one. “In the perfect man,” says Diesterweg, “freedom 
coincides with necessity.” With similar intent Rosenkranz says: “ Educa- 
tion tends to harmonize law and obedience, rationality and individuality, 
work and play, habit and spontaneity.” 
This oneness of the inner and outer in the conduct of life constitutes life- 
harmony. As such it controls whatever there is in us of ethical impulse. 
Vigor and fullness of impulse, when they assume control, lead to excessive 
  or blind utterance, and hence to self-destruction; but in freedom insight | 
controls them without weakening them, and in conduct it leads to self-estab- 
lishment. It is searcely necessary to add that this living, rational freedom 
has nothing in common with that absolute freedom which comes to us now 
and then as a nightmare of metaphysical dyspepsia, and which the clear- 
seeing Herbart declares to be as old a remnant of rohheit as absolute fate. 
Ultimately, then, for the growing human being, the road of harmonious 
development lies through obedience and leads to freedom and mastership. 
Learning more and more to yield himself to the innermost forces of his be- 
ing—of his dynamic self, as it were —he is loosed more and more from the 
traditional fetters of his static self. His growing submission in conduct to 
the objective criteria of truth and goodness liberates his taste from the bonds 
of selfish pleasure, and lifts him into the joys of a truly creative life. By 
placing his own individual life-purpose fairly within the currents of univer- 
sal purpose, he presses into his service the forces of universal evolution. 
And the business of education is to lead to this harmony the being of every 
human child in a persistently and consistently all-sided harmonious prac- 
tice. <

EDUCATIONAL VALUE OF MANUAL TRAINING. AIT 
REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON PEDAGOGICS, 
THE EDUCATIONAL VALUE OF MANUAL TRAINING.   
    
     
    
         
    
                                                                      
   
    
     [PRESENTED By Wm. T. Harris.) 
The subject of the Educational Value of Manual Training has come to 
be of prime importance by reason of the strong claims set up for it by its 
advocates, and ‘secondly, by reason of the fact that as a cause it serves to 
unite not only the critics of the educational system already existing, but 
also its uncompromising enemies; thirdly, because the claims set forth in 
its behalf are based, not on economic reasons, but on educational reasons, an 
assumption being actually made that the effect of manual training on the 
pupil is educational in the same sense as the branches of science and litera- 
ture heretofore taught, or at least if different from them, of equal or of su- 
perior value to them. This assumption unsettles the entire question of 
course of study, in so far as it rests on the doctrine of a specific educational 
value for each of the branches of the course of study, and in so far as it is 
supposed that the present list of branches provides for an all-sided intel- 
lectual training. 
Your committee accordingly have proposed to themselves in this report 
to discuss the various phases of this assumption, and to inquire in what 
precisely consists the educational value of the branches taught in the manual- — 
training school, and wherein they are supplementary of the work already 
done, and wherein they cover the same ground. They have proposed to 
treat incidentally also. the economic questions involved, inasmuch as the 
popularity of the movement has its foundation in the conviction that if the 
schools teach manual training, all pupils will be fitted for useful industries 
before the age of leaving school for business. 
1. Your committee in the outset admit the reasonableness of substituting 
asystem of manual training in special schools, in so far as it can be done, 
for the old system of apprenticeship. That said apprenticeship has been 
and is wasteful of the time and talents of the pupils, is conceded; that a 
school devoted to the business of educating the youth in the essentials of 
his trade or vocation, is superior to the old system that employed the ap- 
prentice in all the drudgery of the establishment, and postponed his initia- 
tion in the essential matters of his trade. But your committee insist that 
such manual training ought not to be begun before the completion of the 
twelfth year of the pupil, nor before he has had such school instruction in the 
intellectual branches of school-work, namely, in reading, writing, arithmetic, 
geography, grammar, and history, as is usually required by those statute 
laws enforced in enlightened States to prevent the too early employment of
-P-A-G-E-418

minors in the industries, and the neglect of their school education. Your 
committee understand that any amount of manual training conducted in a 
. school is no equivalent for the school education in letters and science, and 
ought not to be substituted for it. They hold the opinion, moreover, that 
neither apprenticeship nor the industrial school should be allowed to take 
possession of the youth until the completion of his twelfth year at least; the 
fifteenth year is still better, because physical maturity is necessary for the 
formation of the best muscular movements to produce skill. At too early | 
an age the pupil with his small hands and fingers, his short and undeveloped 
arms, is obliged to acquire bad habits of holding the implements of labor, 
just as a child that commences holding a pen too early will not hold it so 
as to secure freedom of movement. Moreover, the serious occupations of 
life cannot be imposed on children without dwarfing their human nature, 
physically, intellectually, and morally, and producing arrested development. 
Not only the games of youth, but the youth’s freedom from the cares of ma- 
ture life, should be insured to him if the best preparation is to be made for 
manhood. It is sad to know that very many children are dwarfed by family 
necessity, which compels them to bear the weights and cares of mature years. 
The street gamin in the city is preternaturally acute, but is not in process 
of growth towards ideal manhood. Later on he will be found suffering 
from premature old age, in every respect a wasted human life burnt out 
before it could develop its moral and intellectual ideals. He will have a 
“Punch and Judy” face such as Dickens ascribes to the stunted products 
of London street education. Students of anthropology tell us that man 
surpasses the animals so much in his mature life because he has a so much 
longer period of helpless infancy. He passes through a hundred grades of 
ascent above the brute, using all his forces in learning to walk on his hind 
legs, to use articulate speech for inter-communication, to dress himself in 
clothes, and to put on that far subtler clothing of customs and usages which 
hold back and conceal his animal propensities and substitute courtesy to- 
wards others for selfish natural impulse. Were it not for this diversion of 
the forces of childhood, man might develop like the animals the ability to 
walk immediately after birth, and use his bundle of intellectual instincts at 
once without the necessity of a long process of education. On these grounds 
your committee deprecate the necessities which abridge the period of child- 
hood, and consider this one of the first reforms that social science is demand- 
ing, namely, the protection of children from the premature assumption of 
the cares of life. The work of the kindergarten, the schools for waifs, and 
this line of effort, will stop the growth of that hopeless class of society that 
has become arrested below the moral stage of development. 
The ever-present argument of the economical view of education calls at- 
tention to the fact that the great majority of children are destined to earn 
their living by manual labor. Hence, it is argued, the school ought to pre- 
pare them for their future work. The scientific view that lays so much
-P-A-G-E-419
EDUCATIONAL VALUE OF MANUAL TRAINING. 419 
stress on the protraction of the period of human infancy, is opposed to this 
demand for filling the child’s mind with premature care for his future 
drudgery. In fact, this scientific doctrine has already been anticipated by 
the humane Christian sentiment which has founded public schools; for there 
is a conviction deep seated in the minds of the people that all children 
ought to be educated together in the humane studies that lie at the basis of 
liberal culture. Just for the very reason that the majority have before 
them a life of drudgery, the period of childhood, in which the child has not 
yet become of much pecuniary value for industry, shall be carefully devoted 
to spiritual growth, to training the intellect and will, and to building the 
basis for a larger humanity. Such a provision commends itself as an at- 
tempt to compensate in a degree for the inequalities of fortune and birth. 
Society shall see to it that the child who cannot choose the family in which 
he shall be born, shall have given him the best possible heritage that fortune 
could bring him, namely, an education that awakens him to the conscious- 
ness of the higher self that exists dormant in him. The common school 
shall teach him how to conquer fortune by industry and good habits, and 
the application of the tools of thought. 
The economic, utilitarian opposition to the spiritual education in our 
schools comes before us to recommend that we forecast the horoscope of the 
child, and in view of his future possible life of drudgery make sure of his 
inability to ascend above manual toil by cutting off his purely intellectual 
training, and making his childhood a special preparation for industry. 
Your committee would at this point call attention to the fatal omission 
on the part of the economist to see what is implied in his statement, that 
the schools should fit the child for his future duties in life. For when we 
inquire, we discover at once that the trade or vocation in life is but a small 
part of the total functions of anyone’s life. It is what goes with the trade 
or vocation that makes even it a success or failure. What does one need to 
know besides his trade? To this question your committee enumerate the 
following: 
1. Under the head of behavior toward others, his success will depend on 
his treatment of his fellow-workmen and his employers; on his treatment 
of his neighbors, and of his family and children.- Moreover, his behavior 
as a citizen concerns vitally all who live with him under the same govern- 
ment; for he conditions to the extent of his single vote, and the proletariat 
class as a whole may form a majority and determine altogether what sort of 
government shall be placed over all, rich and poor, Christian or heathen, 
humane or selfish. The “dude” citizen, who inherits large wealth and be- © 
lieves that the laboring classes should not be educated beyond the station 
they are to occupy in life, will find that the manual laborers are also voters, 
and that they decide whether there shall be rights of private property or pro- 
tection of life and limb for him as well as for others. 
The illiterate manual laborer, no matter how skillfully educated for his
-P-A-G-E-420
      420 NATIONAL COUNCIL OF EDUCATION. 
  
trade in wood and metal operations, cannot read and write. He cannot read 
the newspaper and take interest in the doings of town, State and nation or 
world at large, except as he hears of it in the turbid stream of personal 
gossip from fellow-workmen. He is essentially shut in, and his thoughts 
move around in a narrow circle like the horse that turns the wheel of the 
mill. Nothing can prevent his being the victim of wild schemes of agita- 
tion that attack radically all the institutions of civilization. To the ob- 
server of the newer and newest phases of modern history, nothing is so clear 
as the fact that the first necessity of civilization is a system of universal ed- 
ucation, not in industry, but in the ideas and thoughts that make up the 
conventional view of the world—such ideas and opinions as one learns in 
studying geography and history, and especially literature. 
2. Your committee would now call your attention, in the second place, to 
the educative phases of manual training. They admit that manual training 
is an educative influence; for all that man does or experiences is educative 
to him, and affects both his will and his intellect. The education of the will 
takes place by fixing or unfixing habits of doing; the education of the in- 
tellect takes place through the ascent from one thought or idea to another; 
from a narrow point of view to a broader and more comprehensive one; from 
a vague and general grasp of a subject to an insight that explains all the 
details, and sees the relations of all parts to the whole. 
In so far as manual-training schools teach the scientific principles that 
underlie the practical points of their work, they add intellectual education 
to physical education. Instruction in the natural sciences gives knowledge 
of nature, both as to its modes of existence and as to the forces that form 
and transform those modes of existence. Natural science, it will be readily 
admitted, is directly tributary to the emancipation of the laborer, because 
it leads more and more to the invention of machinery. Machinery does 
the drudgery of the work, and leaves to the laborer only the task of super- 
vision; it assumes the physical labor, and gives him the intellectual labor 
of directing and managing it. The more complete the machine becomes, 
the more operations it includes in its process, the more intellect is required 
to manage it and the greater becomes its productiveness. 
Compare the study of natural science in its general phases with its spe- 
cial applications of the theory of special machines, and it is seen that the 
study of the more general is more highly educative; and your committee 
would call special attention to the principle on which this conclusion is 
based. That is more highly educative which lasts longest and has widest 
scope in its enlightening effects. The explanation of the special machine 
(the steam engine, for example) is an intellectual acquisition for to-day ; 
and it gives one also a ready insight into all other examples to be met with 
in future experience. But the study of the theories of heat and of the 
dynamics of elastic fluids gives insight not only into the steam engine, but 
also into a thousand other applications (spouting geysers, oil wells, heating
-P-A-G-E-421
EDUCATIONAL VALUE OF MANUAL TRAINING. 421 
  
and ventilating houses, meteorology, for example) within one’s experience, 
and numberless thousands of examples possible in future experience. Hence 
the study of pure science is more educative intellectually than the study of 
special applications of it. 
Again, the study of applications of science is more educative than the 
labor of making the machine. The theory of its operation involves all 
realizations of it, and is not exhausted until all real and possible varieties 
of construction have been explained by it. But the construction of a ma- 
chine adopts one of an indefinite number of styles of construction, uses one 
kind of material out of many for each of the parts, and encounters peculiar 
difficulties of one kind and another occasioned by temporary conditions that 
have nothing to do with the nature of the machine or with its construction 
elsewhere. The laborer thus obscures his general view of the principle of 
the machine by covering it up with a great collection of details that do not 
essentially concern it. He is much more impressed with accidental matters 
of no account in the theory of the working of the machine, than he is with 
the principles of its action. In a second experiment at constructing a ma- 
chine, old difficulties disappear and new ones arise. The intellectual edu- 
cation is of narrow scope and limited in time. 
The intellectual factor of manual labor is never very large even in the 
first construction of a new type of product. The moral education in manual 
training in the way of perseverance, patience, and plodding industry, is a 
far greater educational factor than the intellectual factor. 
The education of the muscles of the hand and arm, the training of the 
eye in accuracy, go for something in the way of education, especially if these, 
too, are of a general character, and productive of skill in many arts. But 
it happens in most cases that the training of the muscles for a special oper- 
ation unfits it more or less for the other special operations. Every trade 
has its special knack or skill, and not only requires special education to fit 
the laborer to pursue it, but it reacts on him, and fixes in his bodily organ- 
ism certain limitations which for greater or less extent unfit him for other 
occupations. The work of blacksmithing, for instance, would unfit one for 
engraving; the work in planing and sawing would diminish the skill of the 
wood-carver. Work in the trades that deal with wood and metals (and these 
include the entire curriculum of the manual-training school) would be dis- 
advantageous to the delicate touch required by the laborer on textile man- 
ufactures; and this class of laborers is nearly as large as the combined 
classes of wood and metal workers. 
Your committee find that the course of study in manual training, in so 
far as it concerns the education of the hand, is limited to a narrow circle of 
trades in the wood and metal industries, and that so far as it is auxiliary to 
trades and occupations directly, it covers the work of only one in twelve of 
the laborers actually employed in the United States. 
Indirectly, as dealing especially with the construction of machinery, it 
27—N.E. A.
-P-A-G-E-422
422 NATIONAL COUNCIL OF EDUCATION. 
has a much wider application, and your committee believe that all laborers 
who employ machines or tools of any description would be benefited to a 
greater or less degree by a course of manual training, and that there is some- 
thing educative in it for all who are to use machines. This is the most im- 
portant argument that can be urged by the advocates of the manual-training 
r school in behalf of its educative value. 
Your committee would here call attention to other arguments often used 
which are weak and misleading; such, for example, as the statement that 
manual training cultivates the powers of attention, perseverance, and indus- 
try. These are formal powers, and not substantial; that is to say, they derive 
their value from what they are applied to, and they may be mischievous as 
well as beneficial. The power of attention may be cultivated by the game 
of chess, or the game of whist, or of draw poker, or to the picking of pockets; 
but it is only attention to those subjects and not attention in general that 
is cultivated. The whist-player who has developed careful circumspection, 
keen attention, the calculation of probabilities in the matter of cards, is 
quite likely not to manifest them in regard to higher matters of observation 
of nature or the study of man. All games of boys—for instance marbles, 
quoits, base ball, jack-straws— are educative, especially in such matters as 
are named as results of manual training, namely: (a) the development of the 
physical powers; (0) the acquisition of dexterity of hand and accuracy of 
eye; (c)in perseverance; (d)in attention. These moreover carry with them 
some general training, and give the boy a similar ability in a field of related 
subjects. But it would not be fair to expect that these qualities of mind 
would show themselves in the boy’s work in mathematics or history, for his 
interest in these games might make him dull and inattentive to all school 
studies. Boys may love the work of the manual-training school and dislike 
history, grammar, and mathematics, and all book-learning, in fact; but to 
be excellent in manual training would not prevent him from being illiterate 
and a bad neighbor and a bad citizen —even a dynamiter. 
Your committee would further call attention to the fact that what is edu- 
cative at one time may be entirely without such an effect at another—or, 
indeed, it may be deadening to the mind. Thus the advocates of manual 
training admit that it is useful as education only if not carried to the point 
of arriving at skill in production. This feature, of course, makes against 
the economical argument in behalf of such schools. According to the eco- 
nomic view, skill in production is the primary object aimed at by intro- 
ducing the training of the hand into schools. But M. Sluys, the Belgian 
normal-school director who reports on the Swedish system, says that when 
the child is compelled to manufacture large numbers of a given object in 
order to acquire skill in the work, the educative value of the work dimin- 
ishes. “From the third or fourth sample his interest wanes; mechanical 
repetition invariably excites disgust for any work.” 
Your committee would call attention here to the fact that if an educative  
-P-A-G-E-423
EDUCATIONAL VALUE OF MANUAL TRAINING. 423 
opportunity is gained by not requiring. mechanical repetition to the point of 
acquiring skill, there is also an educative opportunity lost; for the patience 
and perseverance that pursues its work to the end, and bravely keeps down 
any tendencies to disgust at the lack of: novelty, is a moral education indis- 
pensable to success in any manual calling. No teaching in the studies of 
the schools as they are would be esteemed of a high order if it did not train 
its pupils to attack difficult studies like arithmetic and grammar and cour- 
ageously overcome them. Mere natural disinclination and impatience must 
be conquered before the child can become a rational being. 
Your committee would further suggest, that no justice as yet has been done 
by the advocates of manual training to the claims of industrial drawing as 
a training for the hand and eye and the esthetic sense. If the pupil pur- 
sues this study by the analysis of the historical forms of ornament, and ac- 
quires familiarity with graceful outlines and a genuine taste for the creation 
of beautiful and tasteful forms, he has done more towgrds satisfying the 
economic problem of industry than he could do by sia mechanical skill. 
The great problem in the industry of nations has come to be the esthetic 
- one—how to give attractive and tasteful forms to productions so as to gain 
and hold the markets of the world. The object of the study of drawing in 
our schools is not the acquirement of a “new art of expression,” to use the 
stale definition put forward by some of the advocates of the self-styled “new 
education,” because it is not worth the pains to learn the art of drawing 
merely to make pictures of what is seen or what is fancied. Rather is draw- 
ing the best means of acquiring familiarity with the conventional forms of 
beauty in ornament —forms that express the outlines of freedom and grace- 
fulness and charm all peoples, even those who have not the skill to produce 
such forms. *Some nations, like the French, for example, have educated 
their working classes for many generations in this matter of taste, and it has 
become a second nature. Other nations, the Anglo-Saxon among them, are 
not naturally gifted with a taste for the production of the beautiful, but 
rather with a tendency to look for the dynamic, the lines of force rather 
than of freedom. They are content to produce what is strong and durable 
and useful. But this has led them to the discovery that they must also be 
content with inferior places in international expositions, and with a virtual 
exclusion from the markets of the world. Only a high tariff can force any 
considerable consumption of useful articles of clumsy and unsightly shapes. 
In view of these facts, your committee have deemed it desirable to men- 
tion industrial drawing and the true method of teaching it by the analysis 
and production of the standard ideals in ornament, as worthy of most careful 
consideration on the part of all, and especially on the part of all interested 
in manual-training instruction, either for its economical or its educative ad- 
vantages. Respectfully submitted.

DISCUSSION. 
[REporTED By E, E. Ware, oF Onto.) 
Mr. Wuire: May I ask in what sense the term “manual training” is 
used in the report? P 
Mr. Harris, of Massachusetts: The term is used in the ordinary sense 
of training in the use of tools in wood and metal work —the manual train- 
ing now furnished by the manual-training schools. 
Mr. Peasopy, of Ilinois: Does not “tool-instruction,” or “training in 
the use of tools,” cover the meaning of the term? 
Mr. Harris: Tool-instruction has too wide a meaning, since there are 
many tools not used in manual training, as the tools used in textile manu- 
factures. 
Mr. Woopward, of St. Louis: The report seems to ignore the fact that 
drawing is a most important element in a manual-training course, and, also, 
‘that this drawing is peculiar to the manual-training school. 
Mr: Harris: But was not this kind of drawing in the technical school 
before it was put into the manual-training school? and, if so, is it a dis- 
tinguishing element of manual training? 
Mr. Woopwarp: It is true, that this kind of drawing was in the tech- 
nical school, but this fact does not make it of less value in the manual- 
training school; and, besides, it has been greatly modified and better adapted 
to the ends of manual training. 
Mr. Harris: The drawing in the manual-training school is an element- 
ary form of the drawing of the higher technical school. It is not drawing 
for general purposes, but drawing that relates to a special end. The com- 
mittee desired to call attention to the practical importance of drawing for 
sesthetic purposes. The making of working-drawings may be important to 
the mechanic, but it does not create a taste for the beautiful. On the con- 
trary, it may blunt the artisan’s perception of the beautiful. Sweden, for 
example, has given most attention to manual training, as now advocated, 
and no country has so little real ornamentation in her mechanical products. 
What is needed to command the markets of the world is the cultivation of 
’ esthetic taste and skill through training in the principles of art. France is 
an instructive example of this fact. 
Mr. Woopwarp: I admit that the drawing taught in the manual-train- 
ing school is not in a high sense esthetic, for the manual-training school is 
not an art school; but it is a mistake to suppose that beauty is ignored, and 
that ornamentation is not taught. The aim is to-make every article as beau- 
tiful as possible. We recognize that the first essential of beauty is fitness. 
Without fitness to its highest uses there can be no-beauty. First, useful, 
then beautiful, is the order we adopt. 
 
-P-A-G-E-425
EDUCATIONAL VALUE OF MANUAL TRAINING. 425 
Mr. Mowry, of Massachusetts: I wish that Dr. Woodward would state 
more specifically what is peculiar to the drawing in a manual-training school. 
How does the drawing there taught differ from the drawing in other insti- 
tutions ? 
Mr. Woopwarp: I cannot take the time now to describe our course of 
drawing. I did this at San Francisco, and exhibited many drawings as 
illustrations, It must suffice to say that the course is peculiar to the man- 
ual-training school. 
Mr. L. S. Tuompson, of New Jersey: There seems to be some confusion 
in the minds of members of the Council as to the kind of drawing taught 
in a manual-training school. It is usually called mechanical drawing, 
which consists in making “working-drawings,” or plans, elevations, sec-- 
tions, and developments. This so-called drawing is really not drawing; it 
is merely a conventional language which is very convenient for the mechanic. 
It may not be as difficult to learn as Greek or Latin, but it must be learned 
before it can be used. We-have said that it should not be called drawing. 
It is true there-is a kind of drawing connected with it; so there is with 
hieroglyphics; so there is with the writing of Hebrew, Greek, Latin, Eng- 
" lish, or any other language making use of symbolical characters. This 
language of construction belongs to the workshop and the technical school, 
but not to the elementary common schools. 
Some have advocated the introduction of this kind of drawing into ele- 
mentary schools as a medium for the expression of the facts of form which 
have been learned from the study of the type solids. But’ the essential 
facts of form cannot be expressed on a flat surface; they can only be ex- 
pressed in three dimensions in actual space. The conventional working- 
drawings of a cube are two squares, containing eight right-angles, eight 
edges, and eight points. The facts are six squares, twenty-four right-angles, 
twenty-four edges, eight trihedral angles, and eight points. Even if all 
these could be drawn out on a flat surface, their relations, which are the 
essential fact of the cube, cannot be so expressed; hence they cannot he 
expressed by this or any other kind of drawing. 
I entirely agree with the committee when it says that the great problem 
of the industry of nations has come to be the esthetic one. There is more 
of material prosperity and wealth to the nation to be gained by the proper 
cultivation of the taste of the children in their public schools, than from 
all the plan and elevation-drawing that ever has been or that ever can be 
taught.   
Mr. Prasopy, of Ilinois: Our friends who are represented here by Mr. ' 
Woodward proposed to give us a New Education, which they claim to be 
superior to that which had been extant before. We wish to analyze this 
matter, and to find out what there is in the new departure which is peculiar. 
We find in their programs many valuable things— physics, mathematics, 
language, drawing—all of which were taught before and elsewhere with 
 
-P-A-G-E-426
  
  426 NATIONAL COUNCIL OF EDUCATION. 
  
perhaps equal excellence. I fail to understand the phase of drawing which 
is peculiar to the manual-training school, or is different from some drawing 
which has been done in many places, and which I remember in Philadelphia 
as long ago as 1854. The element which seems peculiar to the manual- 
training school, which differentiates from other schools for secondary in- 
struction, appears to be that of tool-instruction—the use and discipline of 
tools in the work-shop. This is the point which should engage attention in 
this discussion. Except in so far as the other subjects, as physics or draw- 
ing, receive applications to and modifications from tool-instruction, as may 
very reasonably be expected, this is the essential and central idea to be con- 
sidered. 
Mr. Parr, of Indiana: Is it not true, Mr. Woodward, that when you say 
a boy must be taught to construct something that can be applied to some 
end, you have in mind the category of use or application to a practical end? 
You are placing the emphasis on the “lines of force” spoken of in the re- 
port, and are neglecting the lines of beauty. 
Mr. Woopwarp: We do-emphasize the “lines of force,” but we do not 
neglect the element of beauty which may rest upon those lines. Everything 
we construct has its useful bearing in many directions, but it may also be 
made graceful as well. 
Mr. Goys, of Colorado: The pedagogical value of this sort of training 
depends largely upon the disciplinary value of tool-work in wood and iron. 
Little or no discipline follows the execution of work that has already been 
devised, planned, and drafted; work, the completion of which requires only 
manual dexterity. All details have been presented to the workman by de- 
tailed working-drawings. Manual skill is cheap, and furnished in Chinese 
bundles at a small price. To devise and present by drawings a plan is dis- 
ciplinary work. Drawing, then, is the part of manual training which prop- 
erly belongs to the public school. Tool-work is a specialty that belongs only 
to special schools. The dairy schools for which the New York Legislature 
provided, in the bill vetoed by the Governor of that State, were more com- 
plete manual-training schools than those at present proposed by the adyo- 
cates. While the proposed school shop is confined to work on wood and 
metal, limiting the efforts of the pupil to the cultivation of the sight and 
touch, the making of butter and cheese adds to this sense the cultivation of 
the smell and taste; and yet a prominent advocate of this manual-training 
attachment to public schools, through the educational press ridiculed the 
New York scheme. 
Mr. Woopwarp: Mr. Gove has made an impossible assumption. No 
one can make the complete design, drawing every detail of mortise and 
tenon, strut and tie, in proper proportion, unless he is familiar with the 
essential parts of the work of construction. I should like to see a con- 
tractor figure on a design of a house made by Mr. Gove. The two things, 
a knowledge of design and of construction, must always go together. In

the same way, the successful General of the army is trained in all the duties, 
even the most humble, of the common soldier. Every West Point cadet is 
practiced in handling and taking care of a common musket, in pitching his 
tent, in handling the pick and shovel—not because he expects to handle 
these things in the field, but because he expects to give orders to and look 
out for men who do handle them. Dr. Peabody has, in his university, an 
excellent school of architecture. He can tell you how the students go into 
the shop and by practical exercises learn the details that they are to embody 
in their future drawings and specifications. 
There are many points in the report I should like to touch upon, but I 
shall deal with several of them to-morrow night. Accordingly, I defer 
what I might now say to that paper. I will, however, touch upon another 
point in the report. It assumes that the life of the child is to be one of 
drudgery, and hence that school-training shoyld relieve this by keeping 
outside of manual labor. No one has a right to assume that a life of labor 
is one of drudgery, and it is the design of manual training to lift labor out 
of the realm of drudgery. It seeks to lift labor to an intellectual plane, 
and to free it of drudgery. 
Mr. Harris: But is not the educative result of manual training due 
chiefly to its attention to science? The training in mechanical processes 
does not compare in educative value to the study of the principles of heat 
and the dynamics of elastic fluids. 
Mr. Woopwarp: The study of science has its eminent value; we do not 
omit it; but mere scientific training leads to futile attempts in invention. 
The inventor must be familiar with mechanical processes, and mechanical 
skill is necessary to practical success. 
Mr. Wurre: If this be true, where were the inventors trained who in the 
past twenty-five years have so multiplied the forms of human industry? 
The period of invention preceded the manual-training school. 
Mr. Woopwarp: The best inventors have been intelligent mechanics; 
and besides, the era of invention has but just dawned—manual training 
will help usher it in. 
Mr. Harris: I take issue with Mr. Woodward on the statement that the 
great inventors have been trained in the mechanic’s shop. What of Whit- 
ney and Morse? 
Mr. Woopwarp: The great inventor of the steam-engine was a skilled 
workman, and the inventor of the locomotive was George Stephenson. He 
and his son Robert invented the locomotive as it stands to-day. To Robert 
the elder Stephenson gave both a practical and aftheoretical training; all 
that the shop and the lecture-room could give were combined to make him 
the first engineer of his time. 
Mr. Wurre: May I ask Dr. Woodward whether he has not now frankly  
-P-A-G-E-428
  428 NATIONAL COUNCIL OF EDUCATION. 
  
conceded that the purpose of the manual-training school is to train men for 
mechanical pursuits, and hence is it not a school for special education ? 
Mr. Woopwarp: This is one of its purposes, but it also gives an educa- 
tion of general value. 
Mr. Mowry: It seems to me that we have now reached the heart of this 
discussion. We have got to the vital question itself. Allusion has been 
made to the work of an architect. The question comes, How can an archi- 
tect be best prepared for his work? Some practical carpenters and builders 
take up the profession of architecture. Is this the best way to. make an 
architect ? Sometimes such may become tolerably skillful, but if a boy goes 
through the schools and then the college, and studies drawing and drafting, 
and goes to Europe and examines the finest specimens of the world’s archi- 
tecture, and studies the best models and learns the great principles which 
underlie this art—in this way will he not be likely to rise to the highest 
position in his profession? Is it of great importance for him to practice 
the boring of auger-holes? Does he not know a round hole from a square 
one? a half-inch hole from an inch hole? In fact, is it needful for him to 
practice the mechanical work in order to become skillful as a designer? 
Mr. Brown, of Illinois: It does not seem to me that the Council has yet 
reached the real question at issue. The report has undertaken to show what 
is the educative value of manual training, and what are its limits. By man- 
tial training, the report means that training that comes from the study and 
use of mechanical tools. It has shown that the value of this training is very 
small, and that training of this sort is even harmful when pursued to the 
point of skill in the making of things. The report recognizes the value of 
drawing as an important educational factor, and emphasizes especially the 
importance of the teaching of drawing as a means of wsthetic culture. The 
discussion so far has been upon matters of detail in respect to things that 
all admit have .a place in the school curriculum. We must all admit that 
drawing and nearly every other subject in the curriculum are not well taught 
in a great majority-of our schools, because of the inefficiency of the teaching 
force of the country. The question is whether the energy of the directive 
power in education is to be expended in improving the teaching of the cur- 
riculum as it is, or whether a new curriculum is to be substituted for it. 
Mr. Woodward is the able representative of a movement to substitute a new 
curriculum for the old; but this new curriculum differs from the old only 
in one point. All agree that what are known as the common branches of 
learning, and drawing, should be taught in all common schools; but there is 
a class of educationists, represented by Mr. Woodward, who hold that there 
is an educative value in the study and proper use of mechanical tools that 
has not heretofore been recognized, and which is sufficiently great to justify 
the demand that the work-shop be introduced as an integral part of the 
school curriculum. This, I take it, is the leading question before the edu-
-P-A-G-E-429
  EDUCATIONAL VALUE OF MANUAL TRAINING. 429 
  
cational public to-day. What we hope that Mr. Woodward may be able to 
show is in what the value of this tool-work consists; or wherein the doctrine 
of the report that it is of small value is unsound. There is no essential differ- 
ence between the manual-training advocates and the report in those matters 
that have been so far considered this morning, except that the report empha- 
sizes the importance of drawing for its xsthetic results. If shop-work has the 
educational value that is claimed for it, that value can be shown by specific 
statements of the activities it stimulates that produce these educational. re- 
sults. 
In response to a statement of Mr. Woodward, that no one could become 
an architect who could not himself make the things whose construction he 
would superintend, I may be permitted to say that I know a successful civil 
engineer who has had no practice in the use of the tools used by those who 
constructed what he planned and superintended. And I think I may safely 
affirm that this is not an isolated example, but that there are many engi- 
neers and architects who are not mechanics. 
Mr. Ricuarps, of Washington, gave an illustration of an opposite char- 
acter. 
Mr. Wurre: The value of manual training as a means of educating 
mechanics is not under discussion. ‘The importance of the technical school 
as a school of special education is conceded in the report, if I correctly un- 
derstand it. Nor is the Council attempting to decide whether training in 
the use of wood-working and metal-working tools and machines is a valuable 
element in the special education of an engineer or an architect. The simple 
question is, Has this training such an educational value as to justify its 
adoption as an integral part of general education? has it a legitimate place 
in the public school? The report answers these questions in the negative. 
Mr. Hooss, of New York: Wherein lie the superior influences in manual- 
training schools over the public schools in giving moral training to their 
pupils? Those schools often ‘claim superiority in this line. I fail to see 
this, for all branches of life’s work teach values of conduct— moral values. 
The young man who fails in winning the examination has been taught the 
moral value of conduct. Does the manual school prepare pupils better for 
life than other schools? I do not see the justness of such a claim. 
Mr. Woopwarp: I am glad that attention has been called to the moral 
influence of manual training. I have no hesitancy in claiming that manual 
training is an efficient means of moral education. I have had opportunities 
for testing this, and could give many examples. Numerous examples might 
be given of the efficient manner in which manual training cultivates the 
esthetic faculties. Manual training prepares the boy for life. 
I desire to emphasize the point made by Dr. Peabody, that manual train- 
ing is of great value in science study. The manipulations of the laboratory 
of mechanics and construction increase a hundred per cent. the efficiency of
-P-A-G-E-430
430 . NATIONAL COUNCIL OF EDUCATION. 
a physical laboratory. Too often in the latter, pupils are put to construct- 
ing or devising apparatus without the slightest idea of how tools are used or 
materials are to be wrought. Some of you may have what you call success-° 
ful working laboratories of physics and chemistry, but if you will give some 
tool-instruction prior to that work, you will find it time saved and a great 
gain in efficiency. 
Mr. Harris closed the debate by giving a summary of the report. The 
first point in the report was directed to the economic defense of manual 
training, and contained nothing directed against the positions of those like 
Professor Woodward, who defend manual training wholly on educational 
grounds. The second part of the report considered the educational value 
of the different subjects taught in such schools, and laid down this princi- 
ple: Studies are educative intellectually in proportion to their enlightening 
effect, and the duration and scope of that effect. According to this, the 
study of general scientific principles would be educative in the first rank ; 
they explain all machines and all natural phenomena in our present experi- 
ence, and will explain those that we meet in the future. 
In the second rank are special applications of science in the form of the- 
ories of special machines—as, for example, of the steam-engine. - These 
theories explain all machines made in accordance with them; they are very 
general, but not so general as the scientific theories of the forces involved. 
They are accordingly less educative. Buta third and least educative school 
exercise is the construction of a particular machine —say of a steam-engine. 
Here the theory is narrowed down to a special example. One of many 
possible styles is adopted; one of many kinds of material is used. Special 
difficulties are encountered that do not concern the theory, but are accidental 
to the place and means of construction. The laborer meets many new things 
in the work of constructing the machine, but, unhappily, they are not edu- 
cative, because they are contingent, and do not assist in explaining or con- 
structing the next machine. 5 
Examined in the light of these three grades of educative value, the purely 
manual work of the school belongs to the lowest grade, and furnishes the 
obscurest knowledge of principles covered up by a mass of non-essential 
circumstances. 
The committee had admitted the usefulness of manual-training schools as 
special schools to take the place of apprenticeship. The committee, how- 
ever, wished to lay utmost stress on the point made with reference to wsthetic 
culture through drawing. It is culture in taste that American workmen 
need, and not culture in skill, for our laborers are already ingenious, and 
skillful, and industrious. They have clumsy ideas as to ornament. Hith- 
erto, drawing has been mostly confined to what are called “working-draw- 
ings,” rather than to production of forms of genuine taste and beauty.

  EDUCATIONAL STATISTIOS. 431 
REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON EDUCATIONAL STATISTICS. 
WHAT STATISTICS SHOULD BE COLLECTED? 
[PREPARED AND PRESENTED BY J. M. GREENWOOD.] 
The word statistics was first used by Professor Gottfried Achenwall, of Gitt- 
ingen, in 1749. His definition of the term meant “the science of informa- 
tion relating to States;” but later writers have given to the science other 
meanings, so that to the most ordinary mind the fact is patent that statistics 
without figures would be impossible. Some writers have treated the subject 
as a science, and others again as a method, while not a few have regarded it 
as both ascience and method. Consequently, the science since it came from 
the hand of Achenwall has followed a two-fold tendency: one to descriptive 
statistics, or history at rest, while the other is history in motion. The former 
is a thorough knowledge of the respective and comparative situation of each 
State, while the latter is the situation of any State or people taken at a 
given moment. This last species is what Napoleon I called the “budget of 
things,” or a reasoned inventory. The other tendency would prove rela- 
tions, discover laws, and formulate theories — political arithmetic. -Doubt- 
less it was from this view that Goethe regarded it when he said: “If figures 
do not govern the world, they show at least how it is governed.” 
M. Guerry’s definition is as follows: “General statistics consist essentially 
in the methodical enumeration of variable elements whose averages it deter- 
mines.” M. ‘Dufour says: “It is the science which teaches how to deduce 
from analogical numeri¢al terms the laws of the succession of social facts.” 
_ There has been much discussion as to whether numerical terms should be 
applied alike to social as well as to political facts. If it be the science of 
social facts expressed in numerical terms, then it applies to both political 
and scientific facts, which is the position assumed in this. report. 
Statistics without numerical facts would be like a river without water. 
Numbers, it is admitted, are always precise, but they are not always exact. 
To be exact is to know under what conditions they were obtained. They 
may be then absolutely exact, or approximately exact. To know how much 
importance is to be attached to statistics it is necessary to know how the 
numerical data were obtained, under what conditions, and the object in view 
in making the compilation. 
KINDS OF REPORTS. 
The statistics relating to education in this country may be classified under 
four heads: 1. City Reports; 2. State Reports; 3. Reports, of Special In- 
stitutions; 4. Reports of the National Bureau of Education. 
 
-P-A-G-E-432
  432 NATIONAL COUNCIL OF EDUCATION. 
Owing to the magnitude of the subject, the statistics of the second and 
third and fourth kinds of reports will not be discussed in this connection. 
From an examination of a large number of city reports, anyone will be 
convinced that little uniformity in collecting and tabulating statistics exists. 
These differences: originate in the diverse conditions under which city sys- 
tems are organized. Local conditions and custom shape largely all statis- 
tics. The school reports of any particular locality are supposed to contain 
such information as the citizens are most desirous of knowing. 
The statistics of a city school may be grouped very conveniently under 
three heads: 1. Finance, which includes Receipts and Expenditures; 2. 
School Statistics; 3. Itemized Statement of Receipts and Expenditures. 
The first—that of finance —is made either by the president or treasurer, 
and it is designed to show the monetary condition of the school system. A 
financial report annually is indispensable, in order to show how the books 
stand, and to satisfy the community. 
Incumbering a school report with an itemized statement of all expendi- 
tures, is a matter of doubtful utility. Where the books are properly kept, 
and all bills and vouchers are on file for ready reference, all accounts can 
be easily verified. This will obviate the necessity of publishing each year 
a long list of items in which but very few can have any interest. 
CITY SCHOOL STATISTICS. 
Under the second division are the statistics which are regarded as essen- 
tial in all city reports. These embrace usually: 1. School census; 2. School # 
buildings; 3. Teachers and other employés; 4. Enumeration of pupils— 
enrollment, attendance, promotions (general and special), number put back, 
number withdrawn, etc., ages of pupils, cost of tuition per pupil; 5. Parents’ 
occupations; 6. Birthplaces of pupils; 7. Pupils in each grade; 8. Time 
spent in each grade; 9. Pupils residing in each block; and such other tables 
of comparative statistics as indicate the progress and growth of the schools 
from year to year. 
While due importance is attached to these and similar statistics, there 
are other matters far more important in showing the inside workings of a 
school system from a social as well as from an educational standpoint. In 
fact, statistics show very little of what schools are doing. An enrollment of 
1,200 pupils may mean no more than that so many pupils were collected 
together in some sort of order for two hundred days during the school year 
and received some mechanical instruction, or that the pupils were well 
taught — educated. 
The very things that one is most desirous of knowing about a system of 
schools are the very things that are usually not known, and are not easily 
found out. In school-work, schools may be divided into three classes: 
1. Those that pursue the usual routine with unfailing regularity; 2. Those 
that are hugging closely to the shore of routine methods, but deviate slightly 
now and then; 3. Schools combining the experimental and routine methods. -
-P-A-G-E-433
  EDUCATIONAL STATISTICS. z 433 
The third division is the only one worthy of consideration. 
EXPERIMENTAL WORK. 
To catch the spirit of a school there should be a complete and clear account 
of what classes and schools do each year in the way of experiment, and the 
results achieved. If nothing new is attempted, each year is a repetition of 
the preceding one, and progress is at an end. Ifa new departure is made 
in teaching arithmetic, language, geography, spelling, writing, reading, music, 
or drawing, or any other branch, the results should be noticed and com- 
mented upon. Failures and successes in educational work should be recorded 
with the same faithfulness as in other historical studies. 
Were each superintendent to report annually what had been attempted in 
the direction of original or experimental work, noting alike successes and 
failures, and the conditions under which the experiments were tried, much 
good would be accomplished; mistakes in future could be avoided, and edu- 
cators would be better judges of the factors which would further or retard 
school work. One part of each report should be set apart for recording such 
work as I have indicated in this connection. The wastes in educational 
effort would be materially reduced, and superintendents could then work | 
along'lines which give promise of successful results. The danger-signals 
would also serve a good purpose. What is here outlined is intended to make 
the superintendent a successful interpreter and expositor of educational 
progress in every branch; he would not only record what was doing in each 
branch, but how it was accomplished. Instead of reading of “progress in 
this branch or in that one,” the narrative should tell the manner in which 
the improvement had been made. 
INCOMPLETE STATISTICS. 
Of the majority of pupils attending regularly and passing from grade to 
grade, little need be said; while with all those erratic cases, such as are found 
in all classes and schools, much might be collected that would be invaluable. 
' ‘Take, for instance, the “Norfolk examination questions” which created 
such a sensation a few years ago, and a great deal of the very things one 
wanted to know were precisely what one could not find out. As an illus- 
tration: A pupil makes a poor record in this subject or in that one; now 
it would be interesting, as an educational fact, to know his age, his habits, 
how long he had been in a public school, who his teachers were, how long 
under each, his progress in each room, whether he had had private teachers, 
his home influences, the tendencies of his parents’ minds—in short, to know 
the boy as he is. A school should not be held responsible for the partial 
educational training of a child unless the child is kept in the school through 
a series of years. 
Here comes in the unfolding of the intellectual faculties of the children 
of a school, and it is an important matter to know when the development 
proceeds with the greatest rapidity with the average child. Observations 
 
-P-A-G-E-434
434 NATIONAL COUNCIL OF EDUCATION. 
  
along this line would help to adapt the work to the unfoldment of the men- 
tal faculties. 
In commenting upon the behavior and moral conduct of children, statis- 
| tics showing the religious and irreligious sentiments of the parents would 
exhibit very many curious and interesting phases of social life; and the 
same is true of business honesty. School statistics should enter into the 
social conditions of the people themselves. To know the child as “a chip 
off the old block,” the parents must be approximately known, also. Men 
study the different breeds of stock in order to improve them, and school- 
children ought to be studied in the same way. 
Separate statistics should be kept of boys and girls, so as to compare their 
progress from year to year. There are periods when one sex appears to 
outstrip the other, and it is quite probable that these periods are recurring. 
THE CHILD'S SCHOOL HISTORY. 
Whenever a child enters school, he should be provided with a blank-book, 
in which should be recorded all items in regard to his parentage, birth, 
nativity of his parents, occupation, church affiliation, where educated, ete. ; 
date of pupil’s admission to school, the number of days he attended each 
year; his scholarship, deportment, and progress; his standing in each branch, 
promotions, ete. This book should be signed by both teacher and parent 
each term. It is the record of the pupil’s own progress, and it is for him 
and his parents. The annual register kept by the principal should contain 
the same items and such additional ones as would bring out all the facts in 
connection with the pupil’s work and habits. When he enters the high 
school, he should start in with another book, which should be kept with the 
same scrupulous care. Such a retrospective view would be invaluable to 
teacher, parent, and child. It would afford an excellent opportunity for . 
the pupil to compare his own progress from grade to grade. No better 
recommendation could be given to the pupil for later years. 
At present, there is no method devised for obtaining even a proximate 
result of character-building, which is two-thirds of school-work. Improve- 
ments in this direction are more important than percentages and averages 
figured out by “addition, division, and silence.” Some tentative processes 
might be employed for showing character development.   PERSISTENCE IN ATTENDANCE. 
One of the yet undetermined factors of school-work is that of individual 
persistence in attendance. At the beginning of each year a very large 
number of pupils enter the lowest grade, but what number of the same pu- 
, pils start in on grade-work the second and each succeeding year till the 
entire course of instruction is completed, is not known. What per cent. 
drop out annually ought to be ascertained. 
The attendance items could be obtained by giving the pupils of the highest
-P-A-G-E-435
EDUCATIONAL STATISTICS. 435 
grammar grade and those in the high school a blank to fill out, containing 
the following data: 
. Age on entering school. 
. Age June 1, 18—. 
Number of years attendance in city public schools. 
. Number of years attendance in other public schools. 
Number of years out of school, and why? 
Number of years in private school. 
. If ever put back in classes, give reasons. 
. How much time lost from school? 
. Were you held back in your studies? 
. Did you have too much or too little school-work to do?   PEASTAPene e S 
By this means the number of pupils habitually out of school could be 
ascertained. It would furnish the most reliable data for the census-takers. 
There is not, so far as I am aware, any method adopted that will furnish 
the data for ascertaining why so many children leave school each year be- 
fore making grade-work. More definite information is needed on this point. 
Pupils withdrawn could be classified under the following heads: 1. Sickness 
or impaired health; 2. Removal from the school district; 3. To help sup- 
port the family; 4. To earn money to spend; 5. Failure to maintain class- 
standing; 6. Withdrawn because of trouble with the teacher; 7. Suspended 
on account of irregular attendance; 8. Suspended on account of bad con- 
duct; 9. Suspended or withdrawn because incorrigible. 
PHYSIOLOGICAL STATISTICS. 
One of the greatest achievements of the public schools should be the im- 
provement of the physical condition of the American people. Attention has 
been directed almost exclusively to the mental side of the people. Strong, 
healthy bodies are as important to the vast majority of our people, if not 
more so, than vigorous intellects. 
To improve the race, public attention should be called to the large num- 
ber of children attending school, having weak and delicate bodies with 
strong tendencies toward inherited disease. Blanks covering all such cases 
could be prepared under the direction of the State boards of health. Such 
blanks should include nativity, age, sex, complexion, color of hair and eyes 
of each pupil, some account of his bodily organization, such as any intelli- 
gent teacher could fill out. 
The time has come when vital statistics should be collected, and some rem- 
edies adopted to lessen the nervous troubles which so sorely afflict this nation. 
Children’s bodies need the greatest care, and those naturally delicate should 
be taught how to grow to the best advantage and how to husband their 
vitality. 
Items in regard to physical and mental weakness, lack of proper food and 
clothing, and other hindrances that detain children from school, do not ap- 
pear in school reports, yet they are ‘important.
-P-A-G-E-436
  436 NATIONAL COUNCIL OF EDUCATION. 
HEIGHTS AND WEIGHTS OF CHILDREN. 
There is an impression in the popular mind that the American people are 
deteriorating in physical qualities as well as in the powers of endurance. 
The general trend of the nation can be determined by a system of carefully 
prepared statistics, extending over a series of years. 
For instance, if the age, height and weight of each child were duly re- 
corded each year from ten to twenty-one, and these grouped together and 
averaged having the same age, designating between males and females, the 
mean averages, when including groups of fifty or a hundred, would be only 
slightly variant in the same city. Males should be compared with males 
and females with females. From the ages of ten to fifteen years there is 
very little difference in the mean averages in height and weight of boys and 
girls. If these items be continued with all classes through the higher insti- 
tutions of learning, then inferences might be consistently drawn. The chil- 
dren should be measured with boots and shoes off, and weighed without 
wraps. ‘ 
Were such statistics collected in all the graded schools of the country 
much valuable information would be secured, and it would enable the statis- 
tician to compare one section with another much more intelligently than it 
is possible to do in the absence of facts. Such inquiries might be extended 
so as to include adults as well as pupils and students. 
Owing to the non-committal policy of the Council, this report closes with- 
out recommendations. 
Respectfully submitted. J. M. Greenwoop.

CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 
[Discussion OF THE REPORT MADE IN 1888.] 
W. T. Harris, of Massachusetts: The report sets forth the subject in 
such a manner that its discussion will be more useful than that of any other 
topic. It is a matter that ought to come up at every session of the Council. 
It is my opinion, however, that the first method named, that of the election 
of members of the school board by the people of each ward, is the best, 
provided that the total number’of members does ‘not exceed thirty. The 
most important question in the administration of democratic institutions is, 
how to get the best elements of society represented in the governing body, 
and at the same time retain the power which comes only of representing all 
the people. All educators of ‘influence are, at one time or another, called 
upon to give advice as to the proper mode of organizing school boards. A 
favorite plan to secure the representation of the best elements of the com- 
munity, is that of electing, in whole or in part, the members at large or by 
the whole city. But in such cases the members usually lack what is called 
back-bone. When attacked by the newspapers, they are usually helpless 
to defend themselves by an appeal to their constituency, because the news- 
paper stands between the representative and his constituency, if it is a 
large one—a whole city, forexample. The representative of a single ward, 
in case of a newspaper attack, can defend himself personally by direct ap- 
peal to his neighbors. In the course of a few days he can see a majority of 
his constituency, talk with them, and explain his side of the controversy. 
Now in case of a new move in school matters—the introduction of better 
methods, or the suppression of old abuses—the superintendent, or some 
fearless and enlightened leaders within the board, may succeed in carrying 
the reform by arguments and appeals to reason and good motives. But it 
may happen that a powerful influence opposed to reform controls the news- 
papers. In such a case the superintendent or the enlightened leader learns 
the sad lesson that it is useless to work a board up to a good action if they 
cannot stand firm in spite of public attacks. The members elected from 
small constituencies can stand such attacks far better than those elected at 
large, because, as I said before, they can appeal directly to their friends and 
neighbors, and the newspapers cannot get between them. But there is a 
still better reason for this local representation. The superintendent wishes 
to have some direct means of communicating with all sections of the city. 
A member of the board naturally reflects the public opinion of his section. 
He is also a means of explaining to the prominent people of his ward the 
28—N.E. A. 
 
-P-A-G-E-438
  438 NATIONAL COUNCIL OF EDUCATION. 
  
policy of the school board. The superintendent, working with a board 
elected at large, is in the dark as to the effect of important measures; but 
working with a board elected by wards, he can feel his way, and act wisely. 
The local representatives furnish him a means of gradually educating the 
city up to a higher plane. It is important, however, that the school board, 
whether elected by wards or at large, shall not have any local committees 
appointed to look after special schools. Many excellent boards become de- 
moralized by this sort of organization. All appointed school boards labor 
under the same objections as the board elected at large, with this difference, 
that they have still less back-bone, because they feel less the support of a 
constifuency behind them; they are further removed from the people, and 
the newspaper and many other influences can come between them and the 
people. In our system of government, we must never cut loose from the 
people. The objects of the school manager should be two-fold: to improve 
the schools, and to educate public opinion in favor of improvement. Noth- 
ing is safe until it is lodged in the conscience of the people; hence, there 
should be at work a continual process of informing the people what is at- 
tempted, and why it is attempted. No wise superintendent will try to force 
measures against the will of the people; he will do his best to enlighten 
them, and persuade them to do the good things; for not what he does for 
them, but what they do for themselves, constitutes real progress. 
E. E. Wurre, of Cincinnati: This discussion doubtless brings into mind 
the “new departure” in school administration in the city which I represent, 
and a brief statement of its history may throw some light on the topic now 
under consideration. ; 
A few months after I entered on my duties as superintendent of the Cin- 
cinnati schools, the Superior Court decided that the board of education was 
not legally constituted, but it withheld the formal entry of the decision to 
afford the General Assembly time to provide for a legal board. I improved 
the opportunity thus afforded to call the attention of the retiring board to 
serious defects in the administration of the Cincinnati schools— including 
the selection and nomination of teachers by local committees, and the local 
supervision of the schools by the trustees. It was recommended that the 
nomination of teachers should be vested in a standing committee of the 
board.: This special report was received with unexpected favor by the 
members of the board, and also by the daily press and the public. 
A little later two bills providing for the reorganization of the board of 
education were introduced in the General Assembly—one in the House, 
providing for the election of the members of the board by wards, one in 
each ward; and one in the Senate, providing for the appointment of the 
members, fewer in number. The House bill contained a provision prohib- 
iting the members of the board from exercising supervisory authority over 
the schools as individuals or as local committees, and also from selecting
-P-A-G-E-439
CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 439 
  
and appointing teachers. This left the board free to provide for the selec- 
tion and nomination of teachers by a standing committee. 
When the House bill reached the Senate, the scandals connected with — 
the appointment of teachers in Cincinnati were receiving much public at- 
tention, and there was a strong demand for reform. As a remedy for the 
evil, the Senate Committee on Schools prepared an amendment, making ‘it 
the duty of the Superintendent of Schools to appoint all teachers, with the 
consent of the board, and authorizing either the superintendent or the board 
to remove teachers for cause, ~ 
When I learned that such an amendment to the House bill had been pro- 
posed, I saw that it imperiled the superintendent’s tenure, and I asked the 
president of the board to join me in a telegram to the Senate committee, 
urging that the appointment of teachers be not imposed upon the superin- 
tendent, but that it be vested in a standing committee of the board. The 
joint telegram was sent, but it failed to change the purpose of the Senate. 
The amendment was adopted, and the House bill, thus amended, became a 
law. 
The board of education elected under the new law revised the rules and 
regulations of the schools, and those relating to the appointment of teachers 
and the supervision of the schools were put into full harmony with the pro- 
visions of the law, and this was done by an unanimous vote. The salary of 
the superintendent was increased from $3,500 to $4,500, and the incumbent 
was unanimously reélected for a term of two years, the longest term allowed 
by law. : 
In view of this favorable action of the board, I felt it to be my duty to 
accept the reélection and assume the responsibility of organizing the new 
system. This I did, fully realizing that it involved changes in school ad- 
ministration that might not be agreeable to all the members of the board, 
and that the opposition to the law, thus awakened, might be transferred to 
the superintendent. But my duty was not only clear, but imperative, and 
the policy adopted had the approval of nearly all the members of this re- 
form board. ° 
An experience of over two years under the law has convinced me tliat the 
vesting of the selection and appointment of teachers in the superintendent 
is a wise provision in large cities, wherein the members of the board are 
elected by wards—a wise provision, not for the superintendent, but for the 
schools. It is believed that in no other way can teachers be so wisely 
selected; and a wise selection of teachers is certainly the most important 
duty in school administration. So far as the superintendent’s tenure is con- 
cerned, it is undoubtedly better to vest the nomination of teachers in a 
standing committee of the board. When, however, this duty is imposed 
upon the superintendent, the law should in some way afford him needed pro- 
tection. 
I may be permitted to add, that the new system is now fully organized in

Cincinnati, and the provisions of the law are well understood, and it is be- 
lieved that its administration will be attended with less and less objection, 
and less peril to the superintendent. In all such radical changes, the chief 
difficulty is met in first putting them into operation.

OPENING REMARKS. 
W. E. SHELDON. 
Ladies and Gentlemen of the Kindergarten Department: In entering upon 
the sessions of this department, we desire to congratulate you upon the 
growth and progress made in awakening public interest in the peculiar 
system of education founded by Friedrich Froebel, which was designed to 
precede all other elementary training and prepare the child for the more 
advanced regular instruction, by developing and exercising all of its powers 
so as to render it se/f-active. Through’a well-defined system of developing- 
lessons, we believe every child may train itself into a self-educator by ap- 
propriate exercises sometimes called amusements. This culture must begin 
in the earliest years, under the intelligent guidance of the mother, who 
should be a thoroughly trained kindergartner both in theory and in prac- 
tice. With this idea in mind, the first session of this meeting is to be de- 
voted to the consideration of the relations of motherhood to the training of 
the child. As yet, too little attention has been given in America to this 
all-important branch of the true kindergarten system of instruction. The 
education of the senses commences with life itself, so that the infant should 
commence its being with the acquisition of ideas through the training of its 
observing powers. Mothers should learn how to train their children, and 
should study the art of infant education in a model American kindergar- 
ten. To thousands of mothers nature is a sealed book, and for the want 
of the capability to observe the common things that surround them they 
appear but a hopeless mass of confusion, in which they fail to perceive the 
order and beauty of divine wisdom. The heavens above and the earth be- 
neath convey to them but a vague shadow of the realities they sustain to 
physical, mental and moral culture. We are here to consider the remedy 
for such a state of things in the Republic—which is found, in our judg- 
ment, in the education of the perceptive faculties; which education must 
be commenced in infancy, continued in youth, and confirmed in maturity. 
If our American mothers were competent, and had the time to devote to 
the intelligent training of their children, the kindergarten might not be a 
necessity; but the daily occupations and duties of the great mass of our 
American mothers make it necessary that there should be provided kinder- 
gartens where this work can be wisely and well done. The genuine kinder- 
garten teacher must be employed, who, like the best of mothers, will enter 
into the work with her whole heart, and seek to develop the physical, mental 
and moral capacities of every child to the highest degree possible for its

own happiness and usefulness as well as for the good of the home, for society, 
and for the state. The training for citizenship should begin in the cradle, 
and be carried on to the end of the child’s career. It is of the utmost im- 
portance that children should be trained by such methods as that they will 
derive their knowledge in a way that it will be assimilated by their own 
digestive process, and become to them a sure source of mental and moral 
health and strength; we should seek to give them the power of self-direction, 
and make them love independent investigation. Such training alone will 
make them vigorous and original in thought and action. In America the 
word “kindergarten” has had to encounter more or less of prejudice because 
it was the representative of foreign ideas of early training. We have thought 
that it might have been better to have adopted a nomenclature for this grade 
of work as applied to our schools more in harmony with the names given to 
the other grades of school training, such as “sub-primary.” The term 
“infant schools,” used in English, Scotch and Irish courses of instruction, 
has never been cordially received by American educators; and now that 
the public are demanding that children under five or six years of age should 
be provided for in our public system of instruction, it would seem to be wise 
to determine upon some name for that grade of work that will convey to all 
the proper conception of the range of work to be secured. This would not 
involve any change in the principles or methods of the instruction to be 
given, but would perhaps better interpret the universal scope of the training 
sought in its relation to the other more advanced grades of public-school 
work now well understood by the terms primary, grammar, high school, ete. 
No educational topic of our time is of more importance for educators to 
consider than that of the relation of the so-called kindergarten methods to 
the American primary school; and with this in view, we have arranged for 
our first session of the Department that Dr. William T. Harris shall 
open the discussion of the matter by a consideration of the kindergarten 
methods contrasted with the methods of the primary school. No man is 
probably better qualified to enlighten us upon such a topic. We earnestly 
hope that the two great subjects of this meeting (Motherhood and Childhood) 
will be so unfolded as to give an impulse to the growth of public sentiment 
in favor of their advancement that shall be in some degree commensurate 
with their great importance. We hazard nothing in saying that this depart- 
ment has in charge the most vital interests of any one connected with this 
great Association. 
Froebel said “nothing comes without a struggle.” We must begin with 
the spring-time of our life and plant seed that shall germinate and grow 
under the best conditions if we would expect to secure a harvest of humanity 
in the future fitted to assume the high duties of American citizenship in the 
republic; for we feel assured that human happiness and self-government are 
the corner-stones of the Froebel system. Miss Elizabeth P. Peabody, one 
of the great women of our nation, has fitly described this system when she

says it not only insures healthy physical development, but trains the artistic 
imagination, the scientific mind, and the skillful hand of labor; and this, 
without taking the child out of the innocence of the childish sphere of im- 
agination and affection.

PAPERS AND DISCUSSIONS. 
THE KINDERGARTEN METHODS CONTRASTED WITH THE 
METHODS OF THE AMERICAN PRIMARY SCHOOL. 
WM. T. HARRIS, CONCORD, MASSACHUSETTS. 
  
I attempt to contrast the methods of the kindergarten with those of the 
primary school as it exists and has existed in America, not with the inten- 
tion of disparaging either of these institutions, but in order to point out a 
certain fitness of each method for its work in hand. I claim here, and I 
have claimed long ago, when I recommended the school board of St. Louis, 
in 1872, to establish a kindergarten, that the presence of a kindergarten in 
a system of public schools will of itself work some change in the methods 
of the primary school that will ‘be of great benefit to those methods. But 
I wish to show that the methods of the primary school, substantial as they 
are, have a foundation in reason, and that it is not well for our friends of 
the kindergarten to look always in the direction of a revolution in the 
methods of the primary school, and the adoption of plays and games and 
gifts and occupations, or some manual-training modification of these, in 
course of instruction for children from the age of seven to twelve years. 
On the other hand, I hope to convince the friends of the primary schools 
that their methods are not good for children under seven years, but that 
the kindergarten methods are most happily devised for children of. the 
tender age between four and six years. As teachers, we must not get the 
method which we practice in the special grade in which we are teaching so 
close to our eyes that it shuts out all other grades and all other methods. 
‘We must study education in view of the entire life of man, and never for- 
get that our work with the children is to fit them for manhood and woman- 
hood. It is not our object to prolong childhood forever; but, on the other 
hand, we wish to prevent too rapid transitions from one stage of develop- 
ment to another. We do not wish to see a hothouse system of’ education 
forcing the growth of our human plants for the world-market. 
Having made these protests and explanations in advance, let us now pass 
in review the question of the kindergarten, in order that we may see how 
admirably adapted is its method to the child at the first school period. 
1. For the first four years of the child’s life the family education has been 
all in all for him. He has learned in his first year to hold up his head, to 
clutch things with his hands, using his thumb in contraposition to his 
fingers; to follow moving objects with his eyes; he has learned smells and 
 
-P-A-G-E-449
  KINDERGARTEN AND PRIMARY METHODS. 449 
  
tastes and sounds and colors, and the individuality of objects. He has 
learned to move himself, using his limbs somewhat as a turtle does in 
crawling. In his second year he has learned to stand alone and to walk, 
and to use some words and understand the meaning of a great many more. 
His recognition of colors, sounds, tastes, and touch-impressions, has increased 
enormously. He has acquired his first set of teeth, and can use them. Imi- 
tation preceded the acquisition of language. 
In his third year his knowledge of the external world has progressed 
steadily, powerfully aided, as it is now, by the acquisition of language. For 
by language the child has become able to use the senses of other people as 
well as his own. For he listens to their accounts of what they have seen, 
and asks questions incessantly to draw out the experience of his parents, 
older brothers and sisters, attendants and acquaintances. Not only does he 
learn to see and hear through other people—that is to say, get information 
of the results of older people’s observations— but he begins to use their re- 
flections, and inquires eagerly for explanations. It is a great delight for 
him to discover that things and events are little sections in endless chains 
of things and events—little beads, as it were, strung on a great string of 
causal relation—each thing or event being the effect of some antecedent 
thing or event, and likewise to be the cause of other things and events to 
follow. What a wonderful world this is to the child as the principle of 
causality begins to act in his mind, and he wishes to know the why of things 
and events—wishes to learn in what sense they are means to something 
else—in what sense they are results of something else! Through imitation 
of sounds and the effort to attach a meaning to them, language has arisen, 
and now the child has enlarged his educative possibilities infinitely. For 
he can, as we have just seen, learn the results of the sense-perception of older 
and wiser people than himself, and avail himself of their thoughts and re- 
flections. What teacher ever lived—what philosopher ever lived—who 
could begin to tell one-half of the miraculous results of language or speech ? 
Who of these has ever been able to realize in his own mind one-half of its 
wonders ? : 
Stop for one moment and consider the miraculous change in the child’s 
sense-perception which takes place in learning to talk. Before he learns the 
use of language, each thing or event is looked upon as all in all by itself. 
But just as soon as he learns language he sees every object, every single 
event or thing, as an individual of a class—as one specimen of an indefi- 
nite number of possible specimens. In other words, the use of language im- 
plies that the child has begun to use universal terms, words for classes, and 
has begun to think all objects as specimens of classes. What a wonderful 
thing it is, therefore, in the second year of a child to hear him call the name 
of an animal or thing upon seeing it. He has ascended infinitely above his 
previous state of development. To him the particular object seen is one in- 
dividual, seen in a background of infinite possibility of the production of
-P-A-G-E-450
450 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  
such individuals. You will see at once that language implies a causal view 
of the world, and, more than this, it implies a world of genera or species, 
and particular individuals. Finally, it implies that the classes, or species, 
or genera, are not mere results of picking out like individuals and arrang.’ 
ing them together in classes —the child’s view of the matter is not so shallow 
as that—he is far deeper than our mental philosophies and psychologies 
that tell us such nonsense. He assumes that each object has a producing 
process of some kind behind it, and this concept is the idea of a true uni- 
versal. 
The child, therefore, begins to ask the names for all things and events. He 
tries the patience of his elders by his persistency. Why does he lay so much 
stress on mere names? they ask. The reply is found in what we have just 
now considered —the child’s sense-perception has arisen forever above the 
phase of animal sense-perception, and he now and forever after sees each 
object, and will see it as a specimen of a class. Hé therefore wants a name 
for the class, so that he may forthwith begin to store up the different possi- 
bilities of form, shape, size, color, and other varieties of type that he may 
find in future experience. 
‘What infinite possibilities of education lie in this! The child has gotten 
possession of the most powerful instrument of self-education that exists, and 
he has acquired a new faculty of mind—the faculty of seeing each object 
before the senses in the light of its universal, that is to say, he sees the real 
with a margin of other ideal possibilities all around it. Ever after he will 
see any example or specimen that comes under this class name with a re- 
flection that the previous specimen differed from it in some respects of size 
‘or color or shape. - He will think of the other possibilities not realized when- 
ever he sees any given real specimen of a class. 
Here, therefore, begins the child’s perception of ideas—right here, when 
he begins to use language. Seeing possibilities or ideals, the child now be- 
gins to have will-power. Before ideals or motives are seen, the will-power 
has not yet risen out of blind impulse or instinct. Now as he sees objects 
he thinks of their unrealized possibilities, and at once he has a motive to 
act. To act gives him a consciousness of his own power to create: for to 
change a possibility into a reality, to actualize a motive, is to create a new 
form. It is to cause that to exist which was merely ideal before. 
Thus in process of language, the child is unfolding genuine will-power, 
learning to see all things as results of processes which are active universals, 
and getting true self-consciousness. The recognition of the self as causative 
or creative of new forms, is self-consciousness, the recognition of one’s own 
individuality. 
Right here, according to the deepest philosophy, both Greek and German, 
human immortality is established. For an individual that did not exist for 
itself could not be said to be immortal, even if it existed forever. But the 
recognition of self as creative and as self-activity, original cause, is the per-
-P-A-G-E-451
  KINDERGARTEN AND PRIMARY METHODS. 451 
ception of the soul as transcending all its temporary states, as existing above 
and apart from the stream of events in time. Not that the consciousness of 
this individuality is.constant; that is not necessary. The perception of the 
self for once could never happen unless the individual perceiving were im- 
mortal, say these thinkers, and I certainly believe them entirely correct in 
their conclusions. . Language is, therefore, the best evidence of immortality. 
2. Now that the child possesses language, and begins to inquire for names 
— begins to see ideals and to act to realize them—he can be helped greatly 
by the kindergarten method of instruction. It should be used in the house 
by the mother and the nurse. 
The kindergarten wisely selects a series of objects that lead to the useful 
possession of certain geometric concepts and certain numerical concepts that 
assist in grasping all things in their inorganic aspects. It provides for his 
new perception of possibilities or ideals by setting him to work at building. 
It has a series of occupations— building, stick-laying, drawing, perforating 
paper, embroidery, joining sticks by soaked peas, modeling in clay, weay- 
ing, etc. In all these the child finds relations to the fundamental geometric 
shapes that he has learned to know, and he sees with clearness and precision 
how to realize ideals. The kindergarten in the gifts and occupations, how- 
ever, does not use the highest and best that Froebel has invented. The 
peculiar Froebel device is found in the plays and games. Froebel himself 
wrote the Mutter und Kose Lieder, and explained them with all his subtle 
philosophy. The child here, in the plays and games in which all join, 
pupils and teachers, ascends from the world of nature to the world of hu- 
manity; from the world of things to the world of self-activity; from the 
material and earthly to the spiritual. In the gifts and occupations he be- 
comes conscious of his will as a power over’matter to convert it to use, and 
to make it the symbol of his ideals. But in such work he does not’ fully 
realize his spiritual sense, because he does not find anything in it to make 
him realize the difference between his particular self and his general self. 
In the plays and games he becomes conscious of his social self, and there 
dawns the higher ideal of a self that is realized in institutions, over against 
the special self of the particular individual. 
In the’ songs and pantomimes the child uses his self-activity to reproduce 
for himself the doings of the world of society. He produces a reflection of 
this world of human life about him, and repeats to himself its motives and 
its industries, putting himself in the place of the grown-up citizen and as- 
suming his mode of thinking and acting. By this he attains the new con- 
sciousness of a higher self acting within his particular self and dictating the 
customary usages, the conventional forms of politeness, the fashions set for 
him to follow, and above all he begins to have a conscience. The conscience 
demands unconditional obedience— the sacrifice not only of possessions, but 
of life, too, in its behest. Here the child climbs up through his symbolic 
pathway, through play, to the absolute mind. He sees the ideal laws that  
-P-A-G-E-452
  452 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  
are absolutely binding above all temporal considerations; he sees the moral 
law. The moral law is an entirely different thing from the laws of matter 
and motion. The latter relate to dead inorganic substances moved from out- 
side and under fate. The former is the law of activity of spirit, the living, 
the human, the divine. It is the law of self-activity. No self-active being 
can retain its freedom or self-activity except by conforming to moral law. 
The kindergarten does well when it teaches the gifts and occupations, for 
it deals with the world of means and instrumentalities, and helps the child 
to the conquest of nature. It does better with the plays and games, because 
these are thoroughly humane in their nature, and they offer to the child in 
a symbolic form the treasures of experience of the race in solving the prob- 
lems of life. They make children wise without the conceit of wisdom. And 
there is no philosophy for the young woman to be compared with the phi- 
losophy that Froebel has put into his work on the mother’s plays and games 
with the children. 
3. After the symbolic, comes what is called the conventional. In his first 
stages of using language the child is just in the symbolic stage of culture, 
and the kindergarten is exactly the kind of instruction best adapted to him. 
At the age of seven years, or in the beginning of the seventh year in some 
cases, the child has acquired this sense of higher individuality. Just as in 
the first attainment of the gift of speech the child learns to see all things as 
specimens of their universals, and to desire names for all things—so four 
or five years later he has acquired the. humane culture which it was the ob- 
ject of the plays and games of Froebel to teach, and he now regards himself 
as a member of a social whole—in fact, as an individual having special 
duties to perform in the life of the whole. With the beginning of this con- 
sciousness the symbolic bent of the mind begins to yield place to a higher 
and more conscious form of intellectual and moral activity, and the child is 
ready for the methods of the primary school. 
The child, in fact, has arrived at a point where he needs new instruments 
of self-help —he needs to master the conventionalities of human learning — 
he needs to learn how to read and write, and how to record the results of 
arithmetic. 
The human race uses arbitrary characters to represent elementary sounds, 
and combines these into words—a process of analysis and synthesis quite 
difficult for the child of the symbolic period of culture to master. With 
the acquirement of these arbitrary means of indicating speech, the child 
will have a new means of self-help altogether more wonderful than anything 
that he has before learned. He will be able now to appeal from the oral 
and desultory statement, or narrative, to the printed page which contains 
the well-considered and exhausted results of all humane experience present 
and past. Once acquired, the child is emancipated from dependence on the 
leisure of others—he can now at his own leisure consult the experience of 
the race in so far as it exists in his language, and in so far as he can master
-P-A-G-E-453
f STORY-TELLING. 453 
  
its special form of exposition. This must be done by individual industry, 
and is an ethical deed quite distinct from the work of the child in the kin- 
dergarten. 
The child now feels the impulse of duty. Self-subordination to reasonable 
tasks is no longer play. He has arrived at the transition from play to work. 
He can now begin to have set tasks assigned to him, and begin to be re- 
sponsible to authority for the performance of them. 
Here we have the contrast of play and work. In play, the child exer- 
cises his caprice. He sees possibilities, and transforms things according to 
his own arbitrary will. In this he learns his own power—the power of his 
selfhood, and thereby develops his individuality. When he acts under 
the direction of another he does not realize what is peculiarly his own 
causal energy; it is not his ideal, but the ideal of another, that he realizes. 
It is very important not to force on the child in the symbolic stage of his 
culture, say from four years to six years of age, the ideals of others in the 
details of his work, for that will produce arrested development, and the 
child will not have the vivid sense of personality that he ought to have. 
But the fountains of his originality are protected by the kindergarten, and 
he grows in a healthy manner to another stage. At the age of seven years 
the average child begins to tire of mere caprice, having gained through 
play the essential development of its originality. It now is attracted towards 
. work or the exercise of the will along the lines of rational activity or pre- 
scribed by established authority. This is work. While the kindergarten 
should lay stress on the form of play, and give the child opportunity to de- 
velop his spontaneity, the primary school must lay stress on the form of 
work, and lay down definite tasks for the pupil to perform by his own in- 
dustry. 
By language the child rises from an animal individuality to a human in- 
dividuality. By realizing his membership in society, and conforming his 
deeds to the general standard, he develops a higher spiritual individuality. 
This, as we have seen, is the object of the kindergarten plays and games. 
When it is achieved, the method of play gives place to the method of work ; 
the symbolic yields to the conventional; the kindergarten methods to the 
methods of the primary schools. 
STORY-TELLING IN THE KINDERGARTEN. 
  
MISS NORA A. SMITH, SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA. 
  
The disciples of the kindergarten method believe in story-telling as one 
of their most useful and beautiful exercises. The true story-teller, like the 
improvisatore, is born, not made; but in every normal school for kinder- 
29—nN. B.A.
-P-A-G-E-454
  454 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
gartners much attention is given to training in the art, and every young 
woman can, by careful study and practice, attain to some proficiency in it. 
The requirements of a good story-teller are as follows: First, a clear voice, 
used with ease and natural inflections; second, correct pronunciation and a 
correct use of language; third, familiarity with the uses of gesture; and 
fourth, self-possession, or, better still, self-forgetfulness. Yet these are, after 
all, only superficial requirements for the kindergartner. Many possess them 
all, and yet are lacking in the judgment and literary taste which are requi- 
site to help them to select an appropriate story adapted to their child-audi- 
ences; or they may be wanting in some of these essentials, and- yet possess 
an indescribable magnetism, a touch of dramatic art, which will thrill their 
listening audiences from the moment the tale begins to flow from their lips. 
The points in the tale must be made with rapidity; the story itself be 
condensed, for ten minutes is the outside limit of the time a story should 
occupy in the kindergarten; her words should be like sunbeams, “deeper 
burning, the more they are condensed ;” and finally, the manner of the tell- 
ing must be simple, tender, genuine, heart-felt, with no affectation or false 
enthusiasm. It should be as much as possible the manner of the soft-voiced 
mother at the fireside, who holds her little one on her lap and tells him of 
the days when she was young. To this must be added a further touch of 
dramatic art, a little more of light and shade, for she must reach with her 
well-chosen words fifteen or twenty restless, active brains, instead of one. 
So much for the manner of telling the story; now for the tale. In select- 
ing this, care should be taken that it be not too old or too young for the 
majority of the children’s comprehension. It must be child-like and simple, 
yet full of purpose and strength. Its moral must be perfectly pure and 
healthful.. The moral must not come halting after, when the story is fin- 
ished, but must‘be the great thing from the beginning, yet a subtle, intan- 
gible presence, which has filled every portion of the tale with its fragrance, 
yet never for a moment have raised its head obtrusively, as if to say, “Here 
am I, the moral; note me well.” 
The stories commonly told in the kindergarten may be classified under 
various heads: 1st. Historic stories, such as are used, for instance, on the 
nation’s holidays, conveying simple facts as to the origin of Thanksgiving,: 
Independence day, Washington’s birthday, or relating incidents in the life 
of the nation. 2d. Scientific stories, inculcating in a playful way scientific 
facts, as to the habits and structure of animals, natural phenomena, and the 
like. 3d. Stories intended to illustrate some special virtue, as patriotism or 
self-denial. 4th. Tales intended primarily for the cultivation of the imag- 
ination, under which may be included carefully-chosen fairy stories, allego- 
ries, and fanciful tales of various kinds. 
There is much difference of opinion among kindergartners as to the use 
and value of fairy stories, so called, but a discussioi‘ef the differences is not 
in place here. All stories coming under any one of these heads, if well told,

must necessarily give familiarity with the use of good English, develop the 
power of attention, give general cultivation, and prepare for a future love 
of good literature, which will be the child’s best teacher and his chief safe- 
guard. 
THE PRINCIPLES AND METHODS OF EDUCATING OUR 
GIRLS FOR PARENTHOOD. 
  
MRS. EUDORA L. HAILMANN, LA PORTE, INDIANA. 
s   
That I should be the one chosen for this particular branch of educational. 
thought acts as a judgment upon my conscience, for if I know myself aright 
Tam very little given to theorizing, and indeed I have never had time, for 
as doing must be learned by doing, so the art of theorizing must be acquired 
by theorizing. To formulate more or less scientific principles for the guid- 
ance of the educational work of parents is a comparatively easy matter, but 
their application among individual relations, many of which are imperfectly 
known, is a task fraught with many difficulties. 
A retrospective search in educational history will reveal to us the fact 
that a theory of education which shall regenerate the race and reform society 
has been the favorite theme of the maturer thought of all philosophers. 
* From Plato to Herbert Spencer and Frederick Froebel, we behold a sue- 
cession of systems proposing ostensibly infaMlible directions for the educa- 
tional work of family, school, and church. Each one in his day turns out a 
little pet model microcosm. The Frenchman says “J’ai mon systenie.” Into 
this system he tries to fit not only his favorite tid-bits of doctrine, but all the 
results of the observation and experience of the world. At one time it is 
“Tnformation,” cut and dried, will form the common mind; again, it is 
“Conformation,” slavish obedience to authority; then “ Reformation,” lift- 
ing the child out of an “original depravity ;” and, latest, it is “ Performa- 
tion,” learning to do by doing. Very rarely we realize that all of these are 
mere phases of “Formation,” learning to become by becoming. A careful 
scrutiny of the writings of educational reformers will reveal the fact that 
_there is a great deal of repetition of thought and method; .and the optimist, 
jealous of hindrances, often finds himself disappointed and discouraged at 
the slow progress which the world makes along the lines of righteousness. 
With all the lofty ideals held up before society as beacon-lights to guide 
mankind to higher and better conditions and relations, there is still disease 
and suffering, vice and degradation, even in the ranks of the most cultivated 
classes. But, after all, if we sift the thought of the ages, and classify the 
result, we shall find, covered over and over with a multitude of words and 
a heavy armor of egoism, a few kernels of fundamental truths.
-P-A-G-E-456
  456 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
These self-established truths have been stated and restated by poets, phi- 
losophers, and theologians, in more or less attractive and striking forms, 
now crowded into straight-jackets of machine-jointed intellectualism, now 
diluted in terms so vague as almost to dissipate the thought involved. The 
consequence is that those who most need information do not get it. The 
doctrine of Christ is reversed. The righteous are called to a repentance 
they do not need, while the sinners are left to go unredeemed because the 
learned receipts for reform are in a foreign tongue, intelligible only to lofty 
transcendentalism and hyper-speculative fancy. 
I do not mean to denounce the theories and their authors; but I would 
warn women against the practice of meekly accepting and blindly following 
in the wake of ea cathedra authority. We should be wary of self-appointed 
leadership. We, and especially women, should learn to judge of educational 
principles and methods independently, on the basis of our own intuition, 
and in the untrammeled exercise of our own intellect and reason. And here 
I would particularly emphasize intuition, partly because intuition is con- 
ceded to be the special strength of woman’s mind, and partly because, closely 
viewed, intellect and reason are but particular applications of the same 
womanly power to see. 
It is often said that education is woman’s special province. We may find 
some corroboration for this in summer schools and other educational gather- 
ings. In all these the observer cannot but be impressed with the compara- 
tively great attendance on the part of women, and with the superior eagerness 
with which they seek ways and means for interesting their pupils and aiding 
their mental growth. In the majority of cases, it is true, this may involve 
merely a blind following of an instinct to adapt the supply to the demands 
of the being under cultivation. But, my friends, it is the mother instinct 
and not the father instinct that prompts it. Natural sympathy with child- 
nature, an intuitive knowledge that mere information is not education, that 
learning is not power, arouses a longing for better insight, which they — 
alas! too often vainly —seek at these gatherings. 
In our efforts to train the mother instinct, to bring it under the control 
of insight, 7. e., in the preparation of young women for the science and art 
of human culture, we should open every avenue whence light may come, 
and give her control of every instrument of influence, from the needle to 
the pen, from the cradle that rocks the embryo citizen to the ballot that 
sways the world. 
That physical health and vigor are essential to maternity, is a truisin. 
Nevertheless the means employed to secure these seem as yet quite inade- 
quate. Who can behold the thin waists, narrow chests, drooping shoulders, 
and short, spasmodic breathing of our young girls, without being struck with 
the havoc that false customs make of human energy and human possibilities? 
Young men and women wear their fashionable infirmities as solemnly and 
with as much circumstance as a dude wears his diamond in the most con-
-P-A-G-E-457
  EDUCATING GIRLS FOR MO THERHOOD. 457 
spicuous place. A keener appreciation of consequences is needed on the 
part of parents and others’ interested in human progress. Full physical . 
development cannot be reached as long as “good taste” demands such gro- 
tesque fixtures in dress as the corset, the choker, the tooth-pick shoe, the 
heavy skirt, and other fashionable follies. Women must be willing to eman- 
cipate themselves, and men must allow them to become emancipated from 
this bondage, ere we can hope to reap results from efforts to secure on the 
part of young women the physical health and vigor that justify maternity. 
The thoughtful parent, the intelligent teacher, the far-seeing scientist, 
each in his sphere, should continue to preach against Moloch Fashion; to 
initiate practices that gradually undermine his cruel rule; to organize 
classes for calisthenic and gymnastic exercises, for healthful games and pur- 
suits, and to invent new devices and create new forces that will lead to his 
ultimate overthrow. : 
Strength begets courage, and courage overcomes difficulty. Physical 
health and vigor increase the circulation; increase of circulation quickens 
all the vital processes; increased vital power renders easy the responsibili- 
ties of motherhood. And these things rest securely on physical exercise, of 
which I should prescribe a goodly amount. The celebrated Dr..Berhave 
even suggests that “most of our diseases might be cured mechanically, in- 
stead of chemically, by climbing a bitterwood tree, or chopping it down, 
rather than by swallowing a decoction of its disgusting leaves.” 
Nature suggests to us not only the desirability, but even the character, of 
physical exercise, in the instinctive gambols of the young. Upon these art 
may improve, and has improved. We are told that the ancient Greeks at- 
tained a marvelous degree of grace and strength through judicious, system- 
atic physical exercise; and in our own day we find among the cultured classes 
hundreds of Hebes and Apollos whose delicacy of outline, and beaming, soul- 
ful faces bespeak possibilities vastly superior to those of the Greeks. These 
possibilities, thoughtful, persistent physical training should develop. 
Our mothers need arms strong enough and well controlled — for only con- 
trolled strength is effective—to “walk the baby to sleep,” and “wield” the 
ballot, to sweep the house, and to empty the whisky-barrels and beer-kegs 
that their little ones may be free from temptation; to stem the fruit as well 
as the tides of evil that beset the life of their children. 
Health is not an accident. It depends on fixed laws of the human con- 
stitution. Disease and untimely death are results, not of chance nor of the 
“dispensation of a kind Providence,” but simply of the neglect of certain 
conditions on which the healthy action of the various organs of the body 
depend. When these conditions are fulfilled, health is preserved. - When 
they are neglected or infringed upon, disease or death must follow. For 
this and other reasons it is essential that young women should possess a 
knowledge of the structure and life of the animal economy of man. 
In this, stress should be laid upon the study of the higher animal func- 
 
-P-A-G-E-458
  458 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. : 
tions which in man result in the rule of self-consciousness. The organic 
functions should be viewed with reference to théir important bearing on the 
higher animal functions. At every step the student should see more clearly 
the dependence of animal on organic life, the close connection between body 
and mind. 
Nor could she stop here, for science alone is not sufficient. She should 
have frequent access to kindergartens, where, as an interested observer, re- 
sponsible helper, she may sce and use principles and scientific deductions in 
their practical applications. Here she may study child-nature in its various 
manifestations, compare the child of normal conditions with that of vice 
and disease, all the while confirming and correcting, supplementing and 
extending her science, and making herself strong and skillful in its art by 
which alone science can gain full efficiency in life. 
In this connection I cannot lightly pass over the grave (?) question of 
cookery, the abuses cf which account for so many of our bodily ailments. 
Indeed, but for the reconstructiveness of Nature, our perverted palate would 
find it easy to thwart her efforts to continue the human race. 
“Every birth is an hygienic regeneration.” Every untimely death is a 
relentless rebuke to our ignorance or willful indifference, with reference, 
principally, to what we should eat, and when and how we should eat. 
Inasmuch, then, as infancy is most ready to fall a prey to such abuses, and 
inasmuch as the management of infancy must remain with the mother, it is 
of prime importance that she should intelligently control the dietetic de- 
partment of the household. Hygienic cookery should, therefore, be included 
in the course of study for young women. 
Perhaps hygienic not-cookery would better express the thought, for in this 
art very many of the conglomerations and decoctions, spiced and peppered 
nondescripts, many of the fats and meats, which now offend the human 
family in the struggle for existence between common-sense and fashion, 
between science and poison-hunger, would be consigned to the leisure haurs 
of rhinoceros-pouched creatures whose life may without loss be devoted to 
the digestion of such things; but do let ws learn to adapt the character and 
quantity of our food to the best interests of growth and development, and 
to actual individual needs. : 
In some localities it may become necessary to redouble our efforts in this 
matter, in view of the cooking-schools and amateur cooking-clubs which are 
springing up all over the land. These are prone to lay stress on the cook- 
ery in their work, and to slight hygienic considerations, thereby acquiring a 
tendency to refine and to increase, rather than to diminish, dietetic abuses. 
Instead of fried-cakes, pancakes, nut-cakes, pies-and-cakes, stomachaches, 
ad nauseam; instead of “puddings hot, puddings cold, puddings in the pot 
nine days old,” let us have the juicy, sweet, ripe, cooling, refreshing, easily- 
assimilated fruit without the pot, and in addition have the time of the pie- 
and-pudding-maker for some pursuit that will help to reduce the undertaker’s 
business to a minimum.
-P-A-G-E-459

Just how the art of cooking is to be acquired does not come within the 
scope of this paper. I am convinced, however, that it lies at the foundation 
of human health, and therefore of human virtue, human usefulness, and 
human happiness. It is ‘unquestionably one of the most effeetive instru- 
ments in the mother’s hands to bring sweetness and efficiency into domestic 
relations, and to secure conditions that will directly and indirectly bless her 
child. It will be necessary, however, in all that may be done, to lay stress 
on the hygienic side of the work. What we need is hygienic cookery, not 
hygienic cookery. Indeed, what I have said concerning cookery applies, 
mutatis mutandis, to the entire hygienic department of domestic economy in 
all its various relations. The mother should come to her work thoroughly 
skilled on the basis of full scientific knowledge to secure for her child all 
those conditions of ventilation, dress, shelter, cleanliness and cheerfulness 
that will secure vigorous health, and keep away the hands of the physician, 
who, though the best of his craft, lacks the mother’s love and intuition. 
At no previous period of the world’s history did education as a science 
and art receive such universal attention as it does now. The great increase in 
the number of books on educational topics proves this. Unfortunately many 
of these, especially among the “psychologies,” are concerned with the child 
chiefly after his habits and the general trend of his.nature are fixed, and— 
what is still more unfortunate—take cognizance of only a part of his nature, 
viz., the intellectual. Too often they clothe simple truths in technical 
puzzle garments, and instead of aiding in the clearing away of the cob-webs 
of superstition and quackery, conjure up the ghost of antiquated meta- 
physical riddles of questionable value. There are, however, among these 
many reliable books full of valuable information and healthy inspiration, 
which every young woman would do well to study. 
The excellent plan, which has been on foot for a number of years, of 
keeping records of the development of children during the first years of 
their life, will give the student of life’s mysteries new insight and faith. 
Perez’s “First Three Years of Childhood” is good in its observations, 
though unreliable in its deductions. His “Childhood’s Art and Poetry,” 
and a number of other works on infantile psychology, are equally merito- 
rious. Preyer’s “The Soul of the Child” is a masterpiece of conscientious 
observation and soulful interpretation. The English women, among whom 
Mrs. Mallesen and Mrs. Davies deserve special gratitude, have given us 
some of the wisest thoughts on this subject. 
High schools should prepare for the special study of psychology, peda- 
gogics, and related sciences. This they could do by giving their pupils 
opportunities to observe, under suitable direction, the work of the kinder- 
garten and primary school, to assist in the songs and games, and in the 
hand-work, which should form an integral part of the course of study in every 
department of school-life. During the last year this might be supplemented 
by a preparatory course in the data of psychology and pedagogics—with 
no attempt, however, to finish these sciences.
-P-A-G-E-460
  460 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  
Care should be taken in these lessons, however, to guard these young 
women against the errors and allurements current in metaphysical text-book 
psychology. The cut-and-dried plans of the compilers of these volumes 
seem to have been manufactured among the dust of books, and have very 
little of the spontaneity of life about them. Education has to do with in- 
tuitional minds all along the line, and it should aim to lead these into effi- 
cient action in life. For it not only helps intuition as such, but also the 
operations of the intellect and reason are essentially intuitional. To the 
difficulties of following the many individual intuitional minds in their spon- 
taneous development, current metaphysical text-book psychology would ren- 
der us ostrich-blind by covering our heads with the glittering sand of a 
learned phraseology. 
Again, this psychology, which seems to be based more on learning than on 
observation and study, places undue stréss on the intellect and all but ignores 
the feelings and emotions which carry the burden of life. Feeling gives 
tone to thought, sets the intellect to work to find language having its own 
intensity, to pile up lofty and impressive circumstances. Thus it gives us the 
the poet, the orator, “the thoughts that breathe, and words that burn.’ A 
one-sided intellectualism, on the other hand, will oppress us at best with 
intellectual athletes, tight-rope dancers incapable of adding the weight of a 
shadow to the sum of human happiness and well-being. ‘To cultivate the 
emotional nature in accordance with its own laws and in the right direction 
is the great educational problem. 
Its solution will be found only on the road of reverential regard for this 
phase of mental activity, to whose persistence, in spite of the hindrances of 
false educations, humanity owes every creative advance. The emotional 
holds to the intellectual the relation which the sun holds to the moon. It 
can be cultivated only by affording it, at the hand of properly-adjusted sur- 
roundings, suitable fields for action. Learn to feel right by feeling right; 
grow to be sympathetic by practicing sympathy. We hear talk about 
women’s hearts running away with their heads. I wish it were the case 
oftener, and with men’s hearts, as well. It is the heart that leads aright, 
the head and lower organs that tread the path of error. 
Women need more knowledge of society and things in their broadest 
sense. Their outlook, which has been forced into very narrow limits by 
long-established custom, needs broadening. Asa rule their mental attitude 
is one of timid surprise and anxious perplexity. With grateful wonder she 
looks up into the face of the learned doctor who wisely informs her that water 
is wet. As a class, we have not learned the art of selecting from the accu- 
mulating stores of information that which is of greatest use. In our study 
and reading we do not distinguish between the essential and the accessory, 
between the useful and the ornamental. 
A woman wastes an hour in bidding farewell to a friend on whom she has 
made a trivial social call, and then is rushed for time in the important du- 
ties of life. She studies and reads much in the same way. 
 
-P-A-G-E-461
  EDUCATING GIRLS FOR MOTHERHOOD. 461 
  
Now, inasmuch as the mother is the natural guide and adviser of her 
children during the period of childhood and youth, and inasmuch as her 
guidance should be consciously and as directly as possible towards full man- 
hood and womanhood, she should be well up in the living questions of. the 
day —well versed in natural history, physics, chemistry, and mathematics, 
and should have a knowledge of history and of the laws governing society, 
sufficient, at least, to enable her to relate her boys and girls to the world. 
Much misery comes from a neglect of this. The timid child is subdued 
and oppressed; the aggressive child is successful, and becomes despotic and 
tyrannical. Genius without a due amount of self-assertion is often obscured 
or obliterated, while the self-communative possessor of mere talent or shrewd- 
ness wins the prize for retailing the creations of genius. And the mother, 
who might have prevented much of this, looks on in helpless amazement. 
The happy adjustment of individual peculiarities, special characteristics, 
and the like, to future life-success, should be initiated while the child is in 
the mother’s care, and this calls for deeper insight and larger sympathy than 
can be looked for in the mere caterer to the child’s physical needs. 
Perhaps, however, the mother’s greatest needs are found in the direction 
of the arts which reveal the soul that lives in man. Chief among these is 
music, the expression in voice of harmonized feeling, and objectively the 
mightiest harmonizer of feeling. Every child is born with a certain degree 
of musical instinct; for in every child feelings strive to become harmonized 
and seek expression. Under the influence of environment and cultivation 
this instinct becomes Musik-Sinn—a word which in translation loses much 
of its depth, possibly because of the lack of the thing itself in England and 
America. Song-singing, piece-playing, and note-writing are not music, but 
rather deceptive contrivances to conceal the lack of it. Wheezy, squeaky 
organs, persistent pumpers, and noisy throats may be found in many a town 
where music is an entire stranger. When set loose, their utterance, far 
from soothing the savage breast, tends to arouse into prehistoric vigor what- 
ever remnants of original savagery may linger in the remotest recesses of 
evolved humanity. They suppress and pervert musical instinct, instead of 
developing it. 
‘Yet everywhere the voice remains, revealing in its musical or unmusical 
qualities the inner state of feeling. There can be no doubt that harmony, 
tone, melody, have their root in the feelings. The inarticulate moan, the 
sigh, the subdued hum of happy, dreamy childhood, the hilarious “jodel” of 
the happy-go-lucky Swiss mountaineer, singing out his inner harmony of 
feeling —are ample illustrations of the fact. These and the modulations 
of voice in speech are the primitive utterance of the same instinct of har- 
mony of which music is the refined expression. The music of voice modu- 
lation is unmistakably clear in early childhood. It is easy to discern in the 
modulations of the child’s voice the tendency of inner interest and feeling. 
On the other hand, even under the perverting influence of climate, hereditary  
-P-A-G-E-462
462 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
limitations, false environment and false culture, there remains in the oldest — 
voice sufficient modulation to indicate to the practiced ear its concomitant 
in interest and feeling. 
Music manuals are apt to begin the subject at the top, and to go down; 
they rarely, if ever, reach the child—not the music in the child. The mother 
will find in their methods and instruction little of direct value to her. In 
earliest childhood the feeling side of life is uppermost; through this alone 
can the mother enter into full communion with her child. 
Untaught maternal instinct, in a general way, indicates the method, with 
soft cooings, rythmetic jingles and melodious rhymings with which she 
sooths and wins her child, and seeks to attune his being to the control of 
reason and will. 
Musical training, therefore, is of prime importance in the education of 
girls and young women; not in the one-sided way of the ordinary school 
manual, nor in the frivolous fashions of accomplishment-getting, but in a 
living manner which adapts itself at all times to the yearnings of her own 
soul. Such training must rest, not in some trivial objects of pleasure-getting 
or pleasure-giving, but in a sympathetic interest in all her surroundings. To 
arouse and ‘keep growing such interest is the very first step in her musical 
training. The very fullness and intensity of this interest will call for ex- 
pression, and all along the line fullést expression is found in music and 
song. 
I can, indeed, see no reason why, if the girl has been taught musical ex- 
pression and note-writing as carefully and diligently as she is taught literary 
expression and penmanship, her feelings should not, find as intelligent outlet 
in melody as her thoughts do in literary forms. At corresponding periods 
of life these musical productions may not bear the criticism of classic judg- 
ment any more than do the literary productions of growing youth, even in 
the valedictories and class-poems of graduates. But the feelings have found 
intelligent expression, the emotions have sung themselves into harmony; 
the way that leads to living self-control of fully developed rich nature is 
open. 
In this connection, the tonic sol-fa method is undoubtedly a step in the 
right direction. Basing its work on the emotional value of sounds as re- 
lated in harmonies, it enables the pupil to sing and hear these sounds in 
their true meaning and harmonious relations, and to feel in melody not a 
mere procession of single sounds, but a rich succession of related harmonies. 
Rhythm comes to the learner not as a dead, external rule, that controls him, 
but as the utterance of a law that lives in his own soul, and by which he 
controls the song. Its struggle against old encrusted methods, based on 
superficial conceptions of musical art, is rapidly narrowing down to the 
question of mere notation; in the essentials its superiority is no longer seri- 
ously impeached. 
In music, as in other instruction, the school is apt to victimize the learner
-P-A-G-E-463
  EDUCATING GIRLS FOR MOTHERHOOD. 463 
in the interest of the subject when the stress of instruction and drill is on 
the form and letter of expression. Spontaneity in the child becomes ex- 
tinct; affectation takes the place of truth; hypocrisy, vanity, conceit, and 
arrogance are engendered where earnestness, honesty, and modest self-esteem 
were meant to rule. Give girls and young women some worthy object of 
thought and feeling, furnish them with the means to express inner thought 
and feeling, and here, as elsewhere, they will not be slow to apply their 
knowledge and skill in their families. 
Another great instrument of power in the mother’s work is the story. 
Story-telling, not unlike singing in this respect, puts the story-teller and 
the listener into harmony of feeling, unites them on a common objective 
basis of inner interest. It is the avenue through which much information 
may be brought to the child in living association with the child’s personal 
experiences. Thus it paves the way for thoughtful study, and opens new 
roads for wider experiences. Stories are of many kinds, and each of them 
serves a different purpose. There are stories of animals, stories of plants, 
stories of children, fairy stories, allegories, and biographical anecdotes, fables, 
and more or less fanciful dream-stories, remarkable chiefly for the many 
words which they contain. 
The kind of story told, its subject, and the manner of handling the sub- 
ject, must depend largely on the age, character, and attainments of the chil- 
dren to whom it is told. Thus fairy stories and fables should have no place 
in the nursery, kindergarten, and lower primary school; indeed, too great 
care cannot be observed in their use even in higher grades. Usually their 
interpretation calls for more experience and thought-power than can be ex- 
pected during the tender years of early childhood; hence they are received 
as whimsical unrealities. Their intended effect and influence are lost, and 
they are apt to leave in the mind frivolous tendencies that make havoc of 
literary taste and of life aims. 
The educational aim should always be kept in view. Mere empty amuse- 
ment is unworthy the thought and time of an earnest mother or teacher. 
Every story should contain something that may be retained by the listening 
child, and become his own as a valuable life possession. It should come 
with some burden of information or inspiration; it should contain a moral, 
without, however, formulating it; it should in some manner strengthen the 
child in the direction of right being. In plot, it should be truthful—a 
living reality —with no admixtures of sensational exaggeration or fanciful 
surprises. In setting, it should be attractive, feeding the child’s poetic 
tendencies, enabling him to see his own life in the light of higher ideals, in 
teaching him to tell the same or his own stories in a direct, truthful, and 
pleasing fashion. 
Childhood delights in imitation. Left to themselves, children would prob- 
ably name things in accordance with some of the utterances of these; the 
dog is bow-wow; the cat is meow; the locomotive is the tchoo-tchoo. For

this reason a poetic story-teller will adopt her language, the tone of her 
voice, her gestures, and the expression of her countenance to the sentiments 
of the story. It goes without saying, that for all these things much gain 
will come to her from a habit of keen observation, from direct contact with 
nature, and from the reading of good books—not, however, from a plunge 
into the ocean of sensational literature, whose morbid stimulus unsettles 
life by dissipating its energies. 
The taste for rhymes, jingles and alliterations is as natural to children as 
the love for playing with sounds; it is the instinctive effort of the mind to 
relate the emotions to the intellect. The story-teller can do much to en- 
courage this and lift the child into conscious possession of poetic force, 
which is so effective in making life worth living. 
Drawing is a valuable adjunct to story-telling. Its value lies in its 
adaptability to direct, clear and concise thought-expression. It intensifies 
and idealizes the impressions made by the story, while at the same time it 
gives them a new reality, and renders the incidents of the story more actual. 
It opens a new avenue through which to enlist the child’s interest and 
sympathy. It offers the child new and varied opportunities for the exercise 
of artistic, 7. ¢., creative power. A few strokes of the pencil or crayon will 
say more to a child, and, in the school, to a class of children, than a long 
discourse could say, and will get more in return and secure a heartier re- 
sponse of feeling. A drawing comes more like an actual life-experience, 
the interpretation of its symbolism is easy: for this reason it appeals more 
directly to the child’s spontaneity, and is more apt to arouse true self-activity. 
I feel quite sure, however, that prevalent school methods of instruction 
in drawing are little calculated to impart to our girls the art and skill of 
making the pencil or crayon talk. Indeed, I believe they tend rather to 
suppress than to develop the form sense. A “system” which requires all 
pupils to make at all times the same lines, the same number of them, of the 
same length, and in the same way, and for the same external end, of which 
they have little knowledge, and in which they have less interest, may give 
some degree of technical skill in line-tracing, but cannot awaken the artist 
that slumbers in the soul of each one of our girls. 
The deficiencies of these “systems” are not removed by the various devices 
to cover them up with occasional opportunities to “invent designs.” For 
even in these strangely misnamed “inventions,” every step is cautiously 
prescribed; every outbreak of disturbing spontaneity is carefully guarded 
against. 
The learner should have constant opportunities to express her own 
thoughts. She should have something to say, and the mission of the school 
should be to teach her to say this. She should be taught to play with forms, 
as in music and language she is taught to play with sounds and words, seek- 
ing to express thoughts and feelings in a pleasing, intelligible fashion. 
Technical skill is of secondary value in this. Many of the productions,
-P-A-G-E-465
q 
  ED UCATING GIRLS FOR MOTHERHOOD. 465 
  
particularly in the earlier stages of the work, may not pass muster. But 
technical skill grows with practice: and on the sure foundation of correct 
form-feeling, ready form-control, and true artistic fervor established by such 
work, the teacher may build later on true artistic power and skill. 
Such, my friends, is a rough draft of a “course of study” so far as the 
“subjects of instruction” are concerned, which in my judgment would facil- 
itate the work of the mother by making it more direct and effective; provided, 
- and this is an essential condition, that hand in hand, all along the line of 
growth and culture, the religious instinct has had generous opportunities to 
grow into consciously religious life attitude. These so-called subjects of in- 
struction do not in themselves make for truth and righteousness nor for 
their opposites; not even indeed for beauty or happiness. They are mere 
tools in the service of our conscious attitude toward all being. This con- 
scious attitude depends upon the view of life which in its essence is religion. 
Mere learning and even skill are without value in life unless they are 
controlled and directed by the “Old Reliable Trust Co.,” “Common Sense, 
Honest Purpose, Broad Experience & Co.” A plutocracy of mere learning 
may find a congenial home in the university, but plays a sorry figure in 
earnest, intense altruistic life. Mere learning is autocratic, and is apt to 
antagonize true progress. In order to become efficient in human progress 
its range of vision must be widened by varied personal experience, and 
coupled with intense religious enthusiasm and deliberate ethical purpose. 
This religious enthusiasm need not have anything in common with narrow 
dogmas, occult creeds, or church discipline in general; it should certainly 
be free from all fear of punishment or hope of reward, which drag religion 
down from lofty principle into the abyss of expediency, tending to make life 
self-seeking rather than self-giving. The characteristics of this religious en- 
thusiasm lie wholly in the attitude towards life and its work. Its essence is 
faith, its outward tendency is aspiration, its utterance is the loving deed. 
DISCUSSION. 
Miss Cropste, of Indiana: Ladies and gentlemen, I rejoice that this sub- 
ject of motherhood training has been presented in such a broad and beautiful 
manner. I am sure that no words of mine can add anything to it. As 
your President has been so kind as to ask me, I will speak on two or three 
points which I have noted. It seems to me the parent is educated by the 
child, or should be, as much as the child is educated by the parent, and the 
teacher stands in the place of the parent, in the place of the mother, or 
should be as vitally interested in the child and receive as much education 
from the child while in the school as does the parent at home. I must  
-P-A-G-E-466
466 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
agree with the writer of the paper in this, that the mother cannot be edu- 
cated in one institution alone. The family is not sufficient for education. 
Browning has said that “man is not what he does, but what he would do. 
A man is not his simple deed of to-day, but part of it.” There is an infinite 
development progressing and unfolding all the time, and the mother must 
feel the infinite possibilities in herself—be uplifted if she would uplift the 
child. I notice this in the training of teachers, the attitude of the mind in 
kindergarten, and I am glad the writer of the paper has brought out that 
side of the subject so beautifully. I feel that many a mother, and many a 
teacher, may be educated in the forms of the kindergarten, in the forms of 
cooking, and in the forms of factory work. They all give that outlook 
which the teacher of the kindergarten should first get: the spirit of educa- 
tion, the spirit of mental and spiritual unfolding that shall have in it the 
spirit of aspiration which we all need. I believe that the mother must have 
this outlook in order to create a given rationality to the deep emotional na- 
ture. The emotions are uplifted in so far as they are rational,.as they are 
guided in the rational way, but a rational aim has for its aim education. 
It thrills every deed and it thrills every life. The mother must have the 
sense of proportion—the teacher must get it—in order that her aim may 
be rational. I think that many children have the bad habits of intemper- 
ance fixed upon them before they are of school age. They first inherit this 
tendency, and then it is fastened upon them by unhygienic methods of cook- 
ing. It is this outlook into the world, it seems to me, that, is to give the 
mother the indorsement by which she is to guide the emotional nature in a 
rational way. It is true she has this high aspiration. She lives beyond 
the man and sees into the world he knows nothing about, but she is helpless 
in spite of the heavenly knowledge she has, perhaps I should say, by in- 
tuition; she has these instruments of thought, of power, of the higher edu- 
cation, the education which society cannot give. The boy may know that 
two and two make four. When a woman brings into power these truths 
they certainly become a great force for good in the development of mother- 
hood, and in the training of the child. 
I want to speak of this being cultivated in the teacher in the primary 
school and in the kindergarten. So many times we all make these mistakes, 
‘for nobody is entirely rational; but we should be aiming at rationality. 
Now if we do not have any aim in cultivating the senses or aspirations for 
other than the present, it seems to me that labor is not producing its highest 
results. It is the final destiny of the child that is to control, and that 
should be the aim of our teaching. We must educate the child in sense- 
knowledge, not to keep him there, but to get him out and educate the 
higher senses of the child—“the ideal,” as Froebel says. 
Now a cat can see the bird in the tree, I was going to say, as well as the 
child can—I don’t know, perhaps, but the Society of Pedagogical Inquiry 
will tell us; but, at any rate, the cat can see the bird—but for what pur-
-P-A-G-E-467
  EDUCATING GIRLS FOR MOTHERHOOD. 467 
  
pose? Only to destroy it. The cat must, by an irresistible fate, destroy 
the bird to gratify its desire. The child is to see the bird from an entirely 
different standpoint, and his natural impulse is to protect it for itself. These 
are the higher senses in the child that we should educate. We should edu- 
cate these tendencies of the child in relation to the whole realm of nature. 
I would like to commend particularly one thing in the paper—the rec- 
ommendation that the girls in the high schools should take part in educat- 
ing the small children. I think that would be an educative force of which 
we could hardly measure the usefulness. I think boys should have a part 
in it, too. I think it would prepare the boys for a greater usefulness, as 
well as the girls. 
THE KINDERGARTEN IN ITS RELATION TO MOTHER- 
HOOD. 
MRS. SARAH B., COOPER, SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA. 
Somebody has said, if you would thoroughly reform a man you must be- 
gin with his grandfather; in other words, all true education must be organic, 
and so thoroughbred as to.become hereditary. In my opinion the grand- 
mother should have been included in this scheme of reform. The fact of 
the matter is, she is quite an important factor in the case. As it is, the 
writer leaves the entire onus of race deterioration upon the fathers. There 
is no doubt but what they deserve a full share of blame, but it becomes us, 
as fair-minded women, to frankly acknowledge our own responsibility and 
shortcomings in this matter of race improvement. 
The subject assigned me by the honored President of this department is, 
“The Kindergarten in its Relation to Motherhood.” It affords ample scope 
for retrospect and prospect. I should esteem it a very great privilege to be 
with you, and to listen to the discussion of themes in which I feel a profound 
and ever-increasing interest, and on which the future well-being of this great 
commonwealth depends; for “every generation begins the history of the 
world anew.” Yes, I wish I could be with you during these happy days! 
For many years this sunny Southland was my home. ‘The sweet and beau- 
tiful memories connected with those years are as sacred as a faith. Dear old 
Tennessee! Her tender associations and companionships are like the picture ° 
of adream. How well I remember her grand old mountains, her picturesque 
valleys, her sparkling rivers, which like ribbons of silver thread their way 
to the sea. I see old “Lookout” before me now, with rocks piled on rocks, 
and summit overlooking summit! I see it as I saw it once, while standing’ 
on its mighty crest I witnessed one of those sublime and terrific thunder 
storms that sometimes occur below the brow of the mountain. Let me have  
-P-A-G-E-468

a moment to picture the majestic scene! One does not seem to be an in- 
habitant of this terrestrial sphere while witnessing a thunder-storm beneath 
him. The clouds grew black and blacker still; the windows of the sky 
were unlocked; rain poured down in torrents from each gathering cloud; 
thunder on thunder rent the air; red lightnings flashed on the mountain- 
peaks, blazed on the heavens; then, clothed with all the garniture of death, 
darted along the deluged valley with a fearful glare, till the crest of the 
surging waters seemed tipped with flame. Yet, on the brow of the mount- 
ain where we stood all was clear and bright, and the sun rode laughingly 
along, defiant of the storm. I think old Lookout has it in mind to dupli- 
cate this splendid pageantry for the benefit of the National Educational 
Association. It would certainly be “a feature” of the occasion. 
But memory has “caught the bit” and run away. She must be whipped 
into decorous behavior, while I betake myself to my allotted theme— 
“Motherhood.” 
In all the teachings of the great apostle Froebel, there is an ever-present 
emphasis placed upon the two great factors in human life and destiny, 
namely, inherited tendencies, which are the work of nature; and habits 
and environments, which are the work of man and education. Nor has 
he left us in the dark as to definite principles in regard to the rearing 
and training of little children. That remarkable work, “The Mother Play 
and Nursery Songs,” is a rational and philosophical guide-book for all who 
would wisely unfold and uplift childhood to its highest possibilities. It 
addresses itself to all mothers, and to all who supply a vicarious mother- 
hood to childhood. Froebel goes back to the very heart of the matter, and 
deals with the great, divine law of heredity. He declares that what is not 
in man can never be evolved from man. 
“Can you tell, O mother,” says Froebel, “when the spiritual develop- 
ment of your child begins? Can you trace the boundary-line which sepa- 
rates the conscious from the unconscious soul? In God’s world, just because 
it is God’s world, the law of all things is continuity —there are and can be 
no abrupt beginnings, no rude transitions, no to-day which is not based 
upon yesterday. The distant stars were shining long before their rays 
reached our earth; the seed germinates in darkness, and is growing long 
’ before we see its growth. So in the depths of the infant soul a process goes 
on which is hidden from our ken, yet upon which hangs more than we can 
dream of good or evil, of happiness or misery.” 
In this wonderful book, Froebel speaks to mothers who feel the dignity 
and responsibility of motherhood, and who welcome children as God’s best 
gift. But the sacred nature of my theme compels me to admit the sad fact 
that in these modern days children are not always welcomed as God’s best 
gift. They are too often regarded as “nuisances,” “little torments,” and 
“incumbrances.” Alas, that this is true! How will it be with such mothers 
in the day of final consummation, when they present themselves with their
-P-A-G-E-469
  EDUCATING GIRLS FOR MOTHERHOOD. 469 
offspring to the Great Judge and Ruler of the Universe? They will need to 
paraphrase the words of the grand old prophet: “Here, Lord, am I, and the 
‘little incumbrances’ which thou hast given me!” With too many, in these 
days, children are entirely out of fashion, and are regarded as cumbrous 
relics of an effete age. The mother of the Gracchi, who could troop up her 
half-score, with her exultant cry, “ Behold, these are my jewels!” is regarded 
nowadays as a sort of insane enthusiast, to be compassionated and condoned. 
Nevertheless, it remains a fact that the gospel of true motherhood is a gos- 
pel of salvation to the race. 
We hear a vast amount of cheap and churlish chatter concerning the 
rights of woman. It is her glory that among her special prerogatives, of 
which no system of unwise or unjust legislation can ever deprive’ her, is that 
of maternity; so that the daughters of our land, on whom we look with so 
much pride, may become the mothers of our Republic. 
A significant answer was that of Madame Campan to Napoleon, who said 
that the old systems of instruction had entirely failed, and inquired of her 
what France needed to develop her greatness. “Mothers!” said this wise 
woman. The significance of the answer struck the mind of the Emperor. 
“That is well said,” he replied; “there is a system of instruction in a single 
word. Well, Madame, let the French be indebted to you for bringing up the 
mothers of their children;” and he established the noted school of Ecouen, 
and to Madame Campan he committed the education of the daughters of his 
warriors. The scene has sadly changéd since then; and if the French Em- 
pire has tottered to its fall from the want of mothers, who shall say how soon 
our own loved America may not wither under the same blight if the train- 
ing of her daughters be neglected? 
“The mother, in her office, holds the key 
Of life; she stamps the coin of character, 
And makes of him who but for her would be 
A savage, a Christian man: then 
Crown her queen of the world.” 
We have just celebrated our centennial. We have rejoiced over the 
peerless character of the immortal Father of our Country. Had we more 
Marys like Washington’s mother, we should have more Washingtons. It 
was her hand that moulded his character to symmetry and moral beauty ; 
it was her prayers, her influence and her instructions which repressed and 
restrained the growth of evil qualities, and cultivated that divine life in his 
soul which led him to take counsel of the God of battles, the Governor of 
nations. Did she not as truly help to achieve the Revolution as if she had 
led armies to battle? True, she did it through her heroic son, but she did 
it none the less. 
Of the mother of John Quincy Adams it has been said, that she might 
compare well with the Cornelias and Portias of antiquity. Endowed with 
a noble intellect, she had cultivated the sweets of poetry and the solidities 
30—N. E. A. 
 
-P-A-G-E-470
470 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  
of philosophy; she had domesticated her acquirements, and made them a 
blessing to her household. Heer illustrious husband, devoted to the interests 
of hig country, was constantly employed in diplomacy abroad, or in the 
councils of the nation at home, and the education of the son devolved upon 
the mother; and in after years that distinguished son paid that motherly 
faithfulness this tribute: ‘Everything that is valuable in me I owe to my 
mother.” One of the grandest women that England ever produced was the 
mother of Lord Bacon. 
What our own country most needs to-day is a powerful revival of mother- 
hood. A careful study of the grand principles of Froebel as enunciated 
through the kindergarten, would bring about a genuine pentecostal season 
of sweet and loving maternity, adding a great multitude of converts to the 
order of true motherhood. 
Let us look at this question very closely! It is of vital import to the race. 
It does not direct itself to the lower classes of society alone. It needs to ring 
out with clarion clearness in the upper walks of life. In fact, we need what 
has been beautifully characterized as the Universal Motherhood. That sort 
of motherhood which feels a personal responsibility for universal childhood; 
“for all things partake of the Universal.” That sort of motherhood which 
feels that every child has a claim upon her love and tenderness, for all are 
children of a common Father. This beautiful gospel of unselfishness, which 
is the key-note of Froebel’s teaching, needs to be promulgated all along the 
line. For is not selfishness at the root of these social and domestic evils? 
Does it not too often write the doom of childhood? A selfish desire for 
comfort and ease; an unwillingness to forego any amusement or pleasure; a 
reluctance to part with any personal charm that might be sacrificed to ma- 
ternity; an aversion to spend and to be spent for the uplifting of the race; 
a fondness for freedom and frolic; a yearning after fashionable follies—all 
these combine to write the anathema of angelic infancy; and the recording 
angel above, looking sorrowfully down upon the appalling scene, writes his 
maranatha likewise. It is a serious evil, and demands serious consideration. 
We have fallen upon sorry times indeed, when the holiest office of woman 
has come to be regarded so often as a bane, and not a blessing; when chil- 
dren, the choicest heritage of the Lord, are looked upon as perpetual crosses; 
when the little airy-angels, ordained to flutter and sing about the home-nest, 
have been seemingly transmuted into spirits of evil; when personal ease and 
gratification are preferred to the noble, unselfish life; when the ephemeral 
pleasures of the moment are held in higher esteem than the enduring bless- 
ings of the future; when self-love conquers maternal love; when a false life 
has usurped the true life. These are plain, indisputable facts, which no 
amount of feeble sophistry or paltry subterfuge can conceal; and now, in 
these later days, when women seem inspired with a deep and far-reaching 
spirit of reform, why not direct some of this new impetus toward the exalta- 
tion of the race? The basis of the campaign should be motherhood. This 
 
-P-A-G-E-471
EDUCATING GIRLS FOR MOTHERHOOD. 471 
  
should be the broadest plank in the platform. In truth, one of the most 
cheerful and encouraging tokens of promise, in connection with the woman’s 
movement, is the fact that some of its noblest advocates and exponents place 
such solemn emphasis upon this very subject. Let the grand doctrines of 
Froebel, the discoverer of childhood, be carefully studied by universal woman- 
hood, and she will come to hail with joy the welcome refuge from the sickly 
monotony of dress and display, in the grand possibilities of maternity. 
In a masterly address before the American Froebel Union, Dr. Wm. T. 
Harris, in a strong and convincing argument in behalf of the kindergarten 
in the public-school system, said: “A young woman will find so much cul- 
ture of thought to be derived from the discussion of Froebel’s insights and 
theories, . . . experience that will prove invaluable to her as a wife 
and mother, that she will serve her apprenticeship in the kindergarten 
gladly, though it be no part of her intention to follow teaching as a voca- 
tion. It is a part of the system, as an adjunct to the public schools, to edu- 
cate young women in these valuable matters relating to the early training 
of children. I have thought,” he continues, “that the benefit derived by 
the two hundred young women of the St. Louis kindergartens from the 
lectures of Miss Blow, to be of sufficient value to compensate the city for 
the cost of the kindergartens. A nobler and more enlightened womanhood 
will result, and the family will prove a better nurture for the child. Here 
we come upon the most important practical difficulty in the way of the 
general introduction of the kindergarten. If the teachers are no better 
than the average mothers in our families,” continues Dr. Harris, “it is evi- 
dent that the system of Froebel cannot effect any great reform in society. 
It is useless to expect social regeneration from persons who are not them- 
selves regenerated.” And so our plea, this day, is to mothers. It is only 
by the slow but sure alembic of healthful, intelligent parentage, that the 
frailties, weaknesses and imperfections of childhood will ever be eliminated, 
and that each successive generation shall set out from a higher point of de- 
parture. 
The kindergarten comes with its message to parents. It counsels them to 
recognize the fact that not only physical idiosyncrasies, but also mental 
and moral traits, follow a well-defined law of organic transmission. They 
are obedient to recognized principles and relations. All the agencies for 
culture and improvement will never compensate for poverty of mental in- 
heritance. The best of tillage cannot raise knowledge out of a mind where 
Nature has not planted it. Even the kindergarten, which comes the nearest 
to performing miracles of mind, cannot bring something out of nothing, any 
more than splendid sunshine and rain can, in and of themselves, produce 
fine crops. These elemental forces, falling on sand, will leave only sand still; 
while falling on rich loam, they will beckon forth the luxuriance of flower 
and fruitage. Kindergarten training presupposes something to train. The 
best of teachers can never educe knowledge from a mind where Nature has
-P-A-G-E-472
  A472 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  
never planted the germ. Socrates had the correct idea of the vocation of a 
teacher, where he said: “I can create nothing for you; I am only an ac- 
coucheur of the mind. If possible, I will assist the birth of opinions in you, 
and choke them if they do not deserve to live. But do not ask me to teach 
anything, directly. I, too, am a learner, and the humblest of all.’ Was 
not this a prophecy of the Froebel system of development? ‘To secure the 
best conditions for unfolding the latent possibilities of the child, is the 
supreme work of the kindergarten system. And so we say again: parents 
must be what they would have their children to be. There must be genuine 
nobility bequeathed as an inheritance. There must be fewer shriveled, 
stunted travesties of humanity —“half-minted with the royal stamp of man.” 
Let super-abounding life enkindle life; let strength beget strength; let 
power invoke power; let beauty of soul insure soul-beauty; let virtue be- 
queath virtue ;—for thus are heroes bred, full of the opulence of being from 
the earliest hour of birth, and plethorie with life and vitality. Let mothers 
bind their children to their hearts with the silken ligaments of love, ere 
they see the light. Let every faculty and attainment be made to pay tribute 
to the coming child; let mentality be tense and active; let the spirit of con- 
scientiousness be in full play, that harnesses human nature to its destined 
work, and sings as it drives; let there be a chivalrous regard for every 
motherly duty; let there be a more generous intermixture of the noble, 
Madonna stamp of motherhood—self-consecrated, unselfish and devoted ; 
let mothers oftener sing an exultant magnificat, and we shall oftener behold 
the majesty and beauty of physical perfection, wedded to the finely-tempered, 
well-endowed, flexible intellect, and all irradiated by a gentleness, love, and 
sympathy that will make the world the richer for that life. The world is 
on the advance, and mothers must respond to that advance by begetting 
men. t 
And while I thus plead with all my soul that motherhood be faithful to 
her high behests, it is her God-given privilege and duty to plead and protest 
in behalf of the children yet unborn, that they be not compelled to bear 
and raise predestined imbeciles and drunkards. If I speak plainly, it is 
because the vital importance of my theme demands it. The world needs 
full-fledged manhood and womanhood. We live in “an age on ages telling.” 
Great truths are travailing for birth. Great problems await solution. Is 
America, the presumptive mistress of civilization, keeping abreast of her 
own projected work? A balance must be preserved between the present 
requirements of the age and the ability to meet those requirements. This 
can be accomplished only by a wise and reverent obedience to the known 
laws of parentage; by fathers and mothers becoming fathers and mothers 
in truth, as well as in name; by having noble, true and virtue-loving par- 
entage, intent on a higher civilization. This is the only safeguard for our 
Republic. Let the plodding, the thriftless and the unaspiring of any coun- 
try have the monopoly of peopling that country, and the race will become
-P-A-G-E-473
  FROEBEL’§ MESSAGE TO PARENTS. 473 
gradually deteriorated and enfeebled, until finally the whole social and 
political fabric gives way, and the nation reverts back to barbarism, or is 
blotted from the earth. Sooner or later, a nation that treats with indiffer- 
ence or contempt the heayen-ordained laws of generation, must sink into 
irremediable ruin; the inferior race must give place to the superior; and 
no human ingenuity can outwit this law. It was the pride of Cicero to be 
the first'of his race; it has been the shame of many another to be the last. 
Is it any wonder that the immortal Froebel lays such stress upon mother- 
hood? And shall not motherhood lift up her protecting «gis for the pro- 
tection of this great commonwealth? Shall she not teach her marriageable 
daughters, both by precept and example, the full meaning of the motto: 
Noblesse oblige—that new stations demand new duties? That there is no 
honor more regal than to be blest with a quiver full of children? That the 
grandest stronghold of the feminine nature is maternity? This is what the 
founder of the kindergarten teaches as the foundation principles on which 
the future weal of the world depends. And these are truths that must 
ultimately filter down through all the foam and yeast of disputation, and be 
accepted and practiced. To be a devoted, self-sacrificing wife and mother, 
should be to exact perpetual veneration. Her husband should fall newly 
in love with her every morning, and sing a fresh pzean to her praise every 
evening. The crescent hopes which center in her children are pleasant 
compensation for any burdens that may be imposed by the present; for it 
must be remembered that although the dolce far niente may be more enjoy- 
able for the time, it provides no smiling harvest, no luscious fruitage for the 
swift-coming autumn, and the wintry days just at hand; when the merry 
voices of children and grandchildren shall fill the halls with a music so 
rapturous that the very echoes shall bend to catch the minstrelsy, and send 
it trilling from cellar to dome, Such a household is a grand, harmonious 
orchestra, and the mother is the flute-tone in it. Her family is an immortal 
epic of what she has done, loved, and suffered; but, after all, the richest re- 
ward of such a life is to have lived it.

The law of symbolism—that linking of spiritual essences to such external 
forms as seem to most fully express the relation of cause and effect —seems 
to enfold and infill all that Froebel has written on the training of very little 
children. That Froebel makes this law a most potent factor in nursery 
education, no one can doubt who will study his own unique message to 
mothers, as presented in his book “Die Mutter wnd Kose Lieder.’ He de- 
clares that a law underlies all of the analogies or correspondences of the inner 
and outer life, and that a study of these analogies would offer a rational and 
practical solution to many a problem; that such knowledge would give value 
to much that has been merely instinctive or wholly overlooked in dealings 
with young children, and would surely help us to better ways of living. 
But in trying to get at the root of the matter, Froebel insists, at the outset, 
on the great spiritual law (I quote from one of his translators) that “ we can 
see only that which our eyes are ready to see; can know only that which we 
are ready to know; and can do only that into which we put our will.” 
It is often said that the conditions for development in this age—in this 
practical America—will hardly admit of the idealism which fills the 
“mother-play” book. The world has moved, they say, and a book written . 
more than half a century ago in an obscure German village, really cannot 
offer the help needed for the mother who would meet with and for her child 
the complex life duties of to-day. 
Let us look at the law for ourselves, and see whether its vital significance 
has been over-estimated. 
Froebel begins his teaching where the first sign of life begins — with the 
child’s movements. But side by side with this runs a spiritual idea of ac- 
tivity, which we might call the soul’s motion. The soul from the first seems 
to project itself into the whole being of the child—into every sense, into 
every movement, until it reaches the extreme limit of expression, the very 
finger-tips, as it were, of the whole body, and then the reaction begins. 
This soul-life only becomes apparent as it is ultimated in deeds. These are 
feeble; they are indefinite; but into them, hidden away perhaps but never- 
theless present in them, is all that comes to make life worth living now, or 
in days to come. These first activities are the continent and expression of 
all that the child is, mentally, physically, and, I belieye, spiritually. 
Just as in the first garden, a mist went up from the earth and watered it 
when there was as yet no man to till the ground, so in Froebel’s Paradise of 
Childhood are dimly seen and gently felt those truths which, later on, be- 
come a basis for useful, joyous living. 
Let me illustrate this thought. The book opens with a graphic word-pict- 
ure of the love and thought of the mother going out to the babe who nestles 
in her arms. Of this mother-love, Froebel says: “It is the surest founda- 
tion, the purest source, the truest starting-point of human education, and 
only through oneness with the mother can the little life come to a full real- 
ization of the unity in nature, unity in man, unity in spirit.” Dear friends,

  FROEBEL’S MESSAGE TO PARENTS. 475 
  
who of us has not been thrilled to the heart’s core by the touch of the baby 
cheek against our own? By the pressure of the dimpled feet? By the hold- 
ing and fondling of the tiny hands? Think you there is naught but a natural 
‘sensuous enjoyment in this bodily contact? Is there no reason, no cause 
back of the sensuous, natural one of fatherhood and motherhood for this 
delight? Does it end on the plane on which it begins? or does it lead on 
and up, to something higher, to something which shall remain and endure 
forever? 
“That which is the truest sign of a thing, is always its true ornament 
and blessedness.” We have a right therefore to look for the truth which 
lies back of the fact—a fact which every mother acknowledges by word 
and deed. Froebel recognizes always that from the beginning each sense 
should be trained, not only that the child may grasp the outward manifes- 
tation, the material things in his environment, but the deep insight and 
the loving heart of the old master sees and feels that only through the ex- 
ternal form and lower use of these senses are they the 
“fine steps, whereby the queenly soul 
Comes down from her bright throne to view the mass 
She hath dominion over.” 
Jacob’s ladder reached into the heavens, though its foot rested on the 
earth, and so through these gateways are the higher meanings and inner 
essences of things revealed. 
Admitting, then, that there is an inner and spiritual lesson to be learned 
from the outward and visible sign of this, as well as all other sense activi- 
ties, what have we to learn from this most general sense—that of touch ? 
This, I think: That my baby’s delight in the enfoldment of his whole 
being by the mother-love, his joy in the touch of the hand, (which is to him, 
as it has been to the race, the most complete symbol of human power,) in 
fact, the whole perception of this sense and the pleasures which arise from 
it, are a preparation in the lowest plane of the mind for a recognition of a 
sense of Divine protection; which perception, if rightly trained by associa- 
tion, may grow with perfect continuity into an acknowledgment of Divine 
love—that love which manifests itself through the Divine human hand of 
the Christ in contact with our finite human life. We must not forget, how- 
ever, that although the sense of touch is the first brought into action, noth- 
ing can enter the mind through this which does not at the same time rouse, 
more or less directly, the other senses, which are but special manifestations 
of this general sense. 
Charles Kingsley says: “There is music in Heaven, because there is no 
self-will there.” Remembering the little child’s susceptibility to his environ- 
ment, can we wonder that in the practical application of his theories, Froebel 
should have joined rhythm of word and of tone? How would this hearing 
of words and music find its anchor or resting-place in the soul of the child? 
Or rather, it would be more logical to reason from center to circumference,

and ask from what love does this love of hearing spring? to what, in our 
study of analogies, should it lead? 
Has not Christ given the idea when He says, “He that hath ears to hear, 
let him hear”? What can be the co-relative of outward hearing but doing — 
obeying from the heart? Will it make any difference in the obedience of 
our children how the marvelous laws of sound awaken what answers to these 
laws in their minds? Do not the tones in which a command is given have 
everything to do with our willingness to hearken to it? 
Some one has said, “ We come to a full consciousness of ourselves only, in 
our emotions, our feelings.” Does it make no difference with the little 
child’s feeling—the innocent child in whom self-will has not yet been 
roused —in what tones we speak to him? 
Cannot harsh tones and discords lay hold of and rasp the nerves, pro- 
ducing positively painful conditions long before the little one can know 
what it is that so affects him? All life exists through and by law, and I 
do not believe that Froebel demands too much when he insists that there 
shall be mutual understanding and a clear vision in all the starting-points 
of the care of our children. He declares that the child perceives the whole- 
ness of his being long before he can realize the links which, within himself, 
bind him to nature, to man, to God. He declares that it does make a differ- 
ence whether in the beginning the child shall be taught to know the moon 
as a man, or as a beautiful, bright, swimming ball—whether he shall be 
taught to look at the stars as golden pins or lamps, or as sparkling suns. 
Perhaps it is as well to stop here for a moment, and enter an earnest 
protest against the white lies which so many people tell children without a 
thought of the mischief which they do. I cannot but believe that the prac- 
tice springs largely from cowardice and weakness on the part of mother or 
nurse. By the miserable deception of sneaking out of my child’s sight 
when I cannot take him with me, by the worse deception of the positive 
lies told when he asks a question as difficult for me to answer as for him to 
understand. Many a mother and many a nurse tears out of her child’s 
heart that love of truth and justice which the Creator implanted there, and 
for the loss of which there is no recompense. Nothing can ever restore the 
lost peace and innocence which have been violated in this way. 
Froebel says there must be found for the child, at every stage of his 
growth, an adequate expression of the innermost forces of life, in order that 
there may be a point to which we can link further awakening, further devel- 
opment. In the little “Taste Song” Froebel has presented truths which, 
were we to apply them earnestly, might save our children much sorrow. If 
we only realized that there are stages of growth, and that there are truths 
adapted to these which exactly correspond to the needs of the child, we 
should not find it a hard study to look for them. Read Harriet Martineau’s 
“Household Education”; read Mary Lathebury’s tracts in the White Cross 
series; read Grace Kempton’s papers on “Mind Cure in the Nursery”; then

go back and study Froebel’s songs and finger-plays, and I know that when 
you meet the wide-open eyes of your child, and he asks for bread, you will 
not give him a stone. It is truth which is to make us and our children free 
As with touch and hearing, so might we find in the exercise of the sense 
of sight special analogies, which would be well worth our study. In this 
sense, it is the peculiar seeing part of the soul, the understanding which 
should be in our thought, as the child’s eye is trained to know external 
things. He looks from what he can see to find a hidden cause, a living 
force. Froebel says that God neither ingrafts nor inoculates; he develops 
the most trivial and imperfect things in a constantly ascending series, and 
in accordance with eternal, self-grounded and self-developing laws. There 
are laws; there must be a foundation on which the laws rest. There are 
materials — objects, which in their essence and appearance offer a means for 
this development in perfect continuity. I believe those which Froebel has 
selected are the best; but aside from these, in the selection of our own gifts 
for our children, the same study of the fitness of things could be carried on. 
For example: What child does not love to pick and play with flowers? 
What could be better for a home color lesson than the sorting and arrang- 
ing the anemones, violets, “spring beauties,” etc., into little bouquets for 
papa or sister? Ora garden-bed must be’ prepared for seeds. After some 
one has spaded up a bit of ground, how the young surveyor will delight in 
marking out with stick and string, the circle, square, or whatever the shape 
may be! With what care the seeds are laid in the brown bed, waiting to 
be wakened by the rain and sunshine! How many times the child must 
look at the weed or flower to know which to pull and which to leave! How 
the ants, bees, and butterflies all come to be recognized as part and parcel 
of these rounded-out science lessons, although these lessons be given on a 
most diminutive scale. How the children learn to watch the movements of 
the carpenter, mason and painter, and imitate more or less all of the work- 
men whom they have seen. How easy it is just here to put in a word in 
regard to our dependence on the fidelity needed on all sides, on our duty to 
those who, in whatever station in life, are contributing to our comfort. 
‘Yes, it makes every difference with my child from the very beginning of 
life, how he shall hear and see, taste and smell, how he shall handle objects. 
Whether it shall’ be simply for the transitory delight he experiences in the 
natural sensations, or whether I try to lead his loves by means of these gate- 
ways to things which are lasting. 
It is not at all unlikely that among those who hear me to-day, there are 
some, perhaps many, who do not yet acknowledge that the claim made for 
the study of symbolism is valid, or necessary, or practical. They say—the 
thought is not a new one—it is pleasant enough, but even if there be this 
relation between the seen and unseen, between the things of time and the 
things of eternity, how can it concern my dealings with my baby? There 
are already more facts for me to teach than I can present, or than we can

bear: why should I burden my mind with possibilities? For two reasons, 
my friends: 
First, is it not true that the many cares of life, its complex interming- 
lings and callings, make it hard to keep in sight the demands of our child’s 
inner nature? Is it not a great help to trace along the commonest lines of 
expression the imminence of that other life? To know that we need not 
for one instant step out of the channel which nature seems to have made, 
in order to reach this central point for mother and child? Material things 
are so often burdensome; so little of the light of heaven ordinarily shines 
through the thousand-and-one common things that must be done over and 
over for baby —for all of the children! Is it any wonder that the most 
sacred part of the work, just because it does lie under the surface of things, 
is forgotten, or, at best, dorie mechanically and in a bungling fashion? I 
believe the busiest, frailest, most anxious mother, would find this law a 
veritable Jacob’s ladder— with not one round missing—and she would feel 
in her heart that the angels of God ascend and descend thereon. 
Secondly, a wisely studied psychology, as well as many a contrite heart, tells 
us even more than this—it is said that the states of mind and heart such 
as would come from a more spiritual view of common things, can never be 
lost; that these states are secretly and securely guarded in the inmost re- 
cesses of memory, and by means of these “remnants,” in seasons of tempta- 
tion, though long years may have passed, the wanderer may “lift up his eyes 
to the mountains,” and there find the “help” he sorely needs. 
Dr. Holcombe has presented this thought most clearly in his charming 
“Ode to Infancy.” He says that every emotion of infancy and childhood 
acquired from their angels which do always behold the face of the Father— 
that all purely tender and comparatively unselfish actions 
“Are treasures inly stored away; 
Into their forms, like dew into the flower, 
The Lord instills his vivifying power, 
And blessings they become forever, 
States of the mind which perish never, 
But losing every tint of sadness 
e Return with multiplying gladness. 
Germs of eternal happiness 
Which never cease to grow and bless; 
Strength for the seasons of temptation, 
Means of eventual renovation. 
The bonds which link us to the angels most, 
The light which may be hidden, but never can be lost.”

THE CHILD. 
FRANCIS W. PARKER, ENGLEWOOD, ILLINOIs.* 
What is the child? Our Master answered that, when He said “Suffer little 
children to come unto me, and forbid them not.” He did not mean alone 
that the little folks were overflowing with love, that they were the joy of 
our hearts, our hgmes—He meant much more. He meant that the little 
ones have possibilities for improvement and development that long ages 
spent in the loving study of the child will discover. What is the child? I 
will not attempt to answer such a great question; but let me suggest (and 
do not be surprised when I tell you) first that the little child is born a savage ; 
that it has a savage instinct. [Wo the children:] Don’t you want to be an 
Indian, little boy, and put feathers in your hair? Wouldn’t you like to dig 
a hole and live in the ground, and wouldn’t you like to roam at will in the 
big woods? Certainly you would. 
But the little child is a savage. He wants to know what everything is 
just as savages did in childhood thousands of years ago. These children are 
great questioners; they want to know everything; and can you parents and 
teachers tell them the everlasting truth? the truth adapted to maturity? 
The child sees friends in his innocence, in the beauty of the flower and the 
sunshine of the heavens, just as the children did thousands of years ago. 
My dear friends, tell the children the pure truth! A precept may be a lie 
to them, while the truth to them is wrapped up in a fairy tale. I ama firm 
believer in children living out their lives in the mythical stage: in the period 
when they ask and answer themselves questions about nature. Can you tell 
them about the stars? Why it took more than six thousand years of veri- 
table history to begin ‘to tell the true story of the stars; but the innocent 
child will ask the question, and can you answer it? 
Now, all of you children here on the platform have dolls. The doll that 
the child loves best, thank God, is the stick with the rag tied around it. 
Now comes in my veritable puritanic friend and says that is not the truth — 
that is a stick—and he would fain take the loving fancy from the child. 
Boys, do you remember the horses you rode? They were not horses; no, 
they were not horses. Girls, do you remember the shingle you had, and 
the little bit of broken crockery, down under the big tree? All day you 
entertained company in royal splendor never experienced in actual life. 
There you were all day, all alone, with company from morning till night. 
With every one that came you shook hands and talked, but you alone were 
there. Some will say that was wrong—that you didn’t have any company. 
No, no, Mr. Gradgrind, no! I glory in the mythical period of the child’s 
life. I want to tell you that God never puts a tendency in the human heart   
*Stenographer’s report.

but that he wants it developed. That is what the inspired Froebel did; he 
discovered the divine tendencies in the human soul, and he said, “ Let us 
develop these tendencies.” Suppose you caused the little child to live in 
the world cut off from all imagination and fancy: what a cold, dry world 
it would be. Every child that lives creates the world in which he lives. 
In his fancy and in the world of his imagination he lives, and moves, and 
has his being. Would you rob him of it? When you do, you rob him of 
his spiritual life. 
I believe that the cause of materialism, the lack of faith in God, and the 
absence of a pure, practical religion to-day, is owing to this terrible evil of 
cutting off in the child its love of the mythical, and destroying this delight- 
ful fancy. Give to the child the full measure of pure, sweet fancy, and then 
in after life he will see heaven and God and the angels. 
The child is a born savage, but he rapidly ascends step by step, by love 
and works of love, up through all the rays of blessed sunshine! up and up, 
to eternal light, and the everlasting truth, and the eternal God. 
‘The child is born a naturalist. There never was a child in the world but 
what loved flowers. Did you ever see a child that did not love flowers? 
Go into the streets of the city and carry a bunch of flowers. “Give me 
one, Mister; please give me one, Mister;” and they will follow you with 
eager footsteps. There never was a child born whose soul was not lifted up 
to the smiles of God in the beautiful flowers. In Boston, where I was going 
around at my work as Supervisor, one day, I went into a dark street. I 
looked up a darker alley, and I saw a little child, ragged and dirty—not 
like these beautiful children, but covered with dirt—and I saw a smile. 
My friends, if thirty-five years’ school-teaching has given me any one thing 
which I prize above all others, it is that which I call the Divine smile which 
illumines the countenance of an innocent child. When God shines through 
the human soul, and the face of the innocent is lighted by divinity, in that 
little child I see His love. In that little child’s hands, dirty as they were, 
was ‘a clover blossom, and he held it as proudly as the King his scepter. 
Tell me, tell me not, that the Divine is not in every child. God made the 
child, and put His sweetness and light and love in its heart, and it is our 
duty, the most important of all duties, to discover, direct, and develop it. 
I just want to say a word more about this love of nature—that was the 
spark fanned to a flame that led Froebel to his divine work. I had an ex- 
perience as a little boy. When I was eight years old (a fat little boy I 
was) my father died, and I went out in the country to work on a rocky 
farm, away up in New Hampshire. Now what do yousupposeI did? Well, 
I will tell you: I studied botany. There is not a plant, a flower, or a tree, 
on that dear old New Hampshire farm but what I know to-day. I did not 
know I was studying botany. When I travel in California or elsewhere, 
whenever I see a new plant, I say, “No, that was not on the old farm.” I 
also studied every animal and bird. There was not an animal on the farm, ait

not a grasshopper, but that I knew and know yet. I knew where the par- 
tridge made her nest; I knew when she fluttered to scare me away. 
I studied mineralogy. I studied the rocks, and if you will look at my 
hands you will know whence came these callouses—they came from the 
study of the rocks. I went to school with my little tin pail or bucket full — 
no, not full, but half full—of dinner. I wanted to learn. Oh, my friends, 
if some teacher there had known what was in the heart of the little Parker 
boy; if some teacher had said to the little boy, “My dear boy, the botany 
you study is learning the beautiful in nature, is shaping your fancy to ap- 
preciate higher and better things; it is all right: the rock you study will 
make you a better man;”—if I had Been told that I was carrying out my 
natural tendencies, that I was really studying great, divine truths, that old 
school-house at the cross-roads would have been lighted up with a blaze of 
glory, and my teacher would have been an angel, an angel—he was not an 
angel, though, and I do not think he ever will be. 
I wanted to draw and paint, just as every little boy does, and I drew a 
‘figure of my teacher—the picture was not esthetic, you know, because he 
was not. But I was drawing a picture of him with a long coat and brass 
buttons, and just as I was finishing the last button he came softly up behind 
and jinished me. I have never drawn since. Ah, but it is too bad to laugh 
about it. It is too bad to crush divine tendencies out of a child. Every 
child loves nature, and why should not nature come into the kindergarten, 
as Froebel wanted it, and into the primary school as well. We would be 
better with less spelling-books, less grammar, less figures, and more of the 
light.df nature of the sort that Froebel meant should come into the kinder- 
garten and the school-room. 
Every child is a born worker. I said it yesterday, I shall say it to-day and 
to-morrow. There never was a lazy child born in God’s busy world. Oh, 
yes, you are lazy now; I understand that, but that came after you were edu- 
cated. Every child wants to do something. They put out their little hands 
and cry, “Give me something to do.” Look at their beautiful little bodies. 
Here are these wonderful organs of the speech: what for but to sing the 
praises of Almighty God? Music is a powerful medium of conveying 
thought, beautiful thought, to others. Every child should sing. And then 
these wonderful hands. Every child loves to work. Oh, mother, mother, 
you who prevent your child from working because it is menial, are rob- 
bing the child of the richest gift of God. They want to work, they want 
to sing, they want to think, they want to give play to beautiful imagina- 
tion, they want to labor. The boy or girl who never made mud pies in 
the street is fit for but little in this world. They love to make music, they 
love to model, and they love to paint. “Oh, yes,” a lady said not long ago, 
“and Injuns love to paint.” Well, a little child is a little “ Injun,” that is 
true. He begins with the same natural love and instinct; he loves to paint 
and draw and talk, and the wrong comes later. Oh, I implore you to open 
these fountains of beauty in the child before they are closed forever. You

and I may not be able to draw. Asa teacher,I love drawing. Every child 
can learn to draw. Open the avenues of work for the little child. Some 
school-men say it is not right to have manual training in the public schools, 
but it is right to open this power, this love, this tendency to make things, to 
express thought with the hands. There is nothing in the world that will 
make a child graceful and beautiful, if they begin that way, like well- 
directed work. There is no training that will help the child to be strong 
and healthy and good so much as some useful employment in which: he can 
expend his energy. Wasted energy is sin; every child is a born worker. 
The child is a lover of humanity. The. little child puts out its tendrils 
and winds them around the hearts of all that are near; he loves everybody. 
There never was such a thing as a selfish child born —they grow selfish later. 
Train the child up to pure love. Love is a sacrifice; to work for mother 
makes life a pleasure. Some say you can have all the kindergartens you 
need at home; but I don’t think you can. These kindergartens are little 
communities of love; these little children who go to the kindergarten love 
everybody. There should be no whipping or flogging. The switch is a clear 
indication of a poor teacher. You may say that is a queer doctrine, but it 
is true. I punished once, but I shall never, never do it again, because I 
know when I punish I am a poor teacher, and it is time for me to leave the 
ranks. The child loves all persons, but they can be made selfish. Many a 
mother at home puts her little child in a way to become selfish by giving it 
all sorts of things, because she thinks she loves her child. Many a child 
goes into the school or kindergarten who has really ruled the mother, and 
father, too, for three or four or five years. It has been ruling the house- 
hold. It comes into the kindergarten, and there it is sweet and easily man- 
aged for three or four hours, and then it goes home again to rule its parents. 
The child loves to do good. The selfishness engendered by bad teaching 
or bad home training, the Sunday school and all the preaching can never 
fully wipe out. But I say the little child loves to do’good at the beginning, 
and it is our duty to foster that tendency. 
I would like to say just one final word. Christ pointed the way — “Suffer 
the little children,” He said. The study of the child is needed more in this 
grand country of ours than anything else. What a beautiful thing the love of 
brothers and sisters is!_ How terrible it was twenty-eight years ago, but that 
is all changed; thank God, we have clasped hands, and there is no bloody 
chasm left. I thank God I never fired a gun in the war with hate in my 
heart. Hate has been used too long by demagogues to lift thernselves into 
office and degrade mankind. What an important duty we have in mould- 
ing this divine love of the child. Love is the culture of the human soul. 
_ Mothers, teachers, and all, I charge you to study the child, and this great 
nation shall be led by the child. “Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou Me?” 
“Yea, Lord, Thou knowest I love Thee.” “Feed My lambs.” Feed the 
lambs of God, and the gates of glory shall be lifted up, and the King of 
Glory shall enter in.

DISCIPLINE IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. 
BETTIE A. DUTTON, CLEVELAND, OHIO. 
In the face of great improvement in the schools for little children, and of 
the more satisfactory results of recent plans and efforts for their best growth, 
the true teacher is yet conscious of a sense of incompleteness—as if some 
essential element in the training and instruction, especially of the younger 
children, were lacking. That this dissatisfaction is the result, in part at 
least, of a failure to realize the true ends for which schools exist, and of an 
absence of that close acquaintance with the thought and life of little chil- 
dren which must lie at the foundation of any valuable system of education, 
is apparent to all earnest students of educational problems. 
When we are reminded that the large majority of those enrolled in our 
schools leave them before the age of twelve years, this fact gives additional 
importance to all questions relating to their highest efficiency in the forma- 
tion of right character, in the development of mental strength, and in the 
acquisition of useful knowledge; and too great care cannot be exercised in 
determining what forces shall be brought to bear in these early and forma- 
tive years, or what manner of spirit shall be given their control and direc- 
tion. 
It has not been the purpose in the preparation of this paper to offer any 
new theory of education; but to gather from observation and experience a 
few thoughts which may be helpful to some just entering these fields of in- 
quiry, and suggestive of profitable discussion among those who have given 
to these simple propositions years of closest study. 
If it be true that the aim of all education is to prepare the pupil for the 
highest enjoyments and the most helpful ministries in life—then the value 
of all our school organizations and courses of study, and the success of our 
methods of instruction and discipline, must be tested with reference to their 
contribution to this result. 
The school-life, brief as it is, may reasonably be asked to furnish to the 
Republic loyal and obedient citizens; to the business world, men with a 
courage and grip that will not too easily let go in the pushing affairs of 
trade; to social life, an ease and grace of manner, a strength of self-reliance, 
which shall put each in possession of his full powers for his own up-building 
and for the advancement of his associates; and to the home-life of the nation,

men and women pure in heart, clear in conviction, strong in purpose, loving 
their children and loving to live with them. 
Many circumstances, unknown in the history and life of every child, com- 
bine their forces to increase or to lessen these best products of school-life; 
indeed, the school-life itself, though covering a period of years, sometimes 
seeming to be but a small factor in the whole. 
That the discipline of the schools should be such as to put the pupil most 
surely in command of himself, of his best powers of accomplishment and of 
service, in whatever line of work choice, or inheritance, or circumstances 
may. decide for him, is common belief. That the careful teaching of right 
principles of conduct, reénforced and vitalized by the personal power and ° 
life of the conscientious teacher, and intensified by well-regulated association 
with his mates, is invaluable and helpful discipline for this life-work, few, if 
any, would question. 
The habit of mind and conscience which rests on these foundations makes 
each step of progress sure, and success certain. 
We need to keep constantly before our minds, that the aim of discipline 
is not to secure order alone—not to compel obedience or attention—for this 
may be done through those external means which the strong use in their 
intercourse with the weak, but to produce what is aptly characterized as 
a “self-governing: being”’—one whose moral consciousness has not been 
blunted by the display of needless authority, or by appeal to mistaken 
motives in the decision for right conduct. 
Those having the care of children and youth often commit the grave 
error of substituting themselves for the moral sense, by asking that right 
choice be made and wrong avoided for their sake. “Do this just to please 
me,” and “Do not do this, because it grieves me,” are illustrations of appeal 
to motives whose tendency is to cultivate a habit of regard for individuals 
in the field where conscience alone should be decisive; and the stronger the 
personal regard, the more active and glowing the affection thus appealed to, 
the more disastrous are the consequences. 
This must not in any sense be interpreted as favoring a lack of open ex- 
pression of sympathy in every struggle toward the right, and of manifest 
joy at well-earned victory. 
Teachers should cultivate the closest possible fellowship with their chil- 
dren, by an ever-ready sympathy in whatever is glad and joyous in their 
childish experiences, entering into their small griefs as well, and taking a 
hearty and generous part in their studies and their sports, yet leaving them 
in all these interests much to their own resources. 
Too constant watchfulness, too much constraint, and too unyielding a con- 
trol, are unwise and enervating, and are as harmful as too little. The 
teacher’s mission is to help; and restraint and control are but means to the 
readiest accomplishment of this end. 
The difficulties in the way of securing habitual attention to school tasks
-P-A-G-E-489
  DISCIPLINE IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. 489 
  
and diligence in their accomplishment, are largely overcome when the work 
assigned meets the young learner’s need, and is presented in reasonable 
manner and with expectant spitit. 
Children, like their elders, listen to that which reason assures them is to 
serve them well, and apply themselves with keenest zest to that which com- 
mends itself to their childish sense of fitness and profit. 
The flowers do not more surely open to the light, or the instrument give 
back its sweetest harmony to the master’s touch, than does the mind of the 
little child make sure response to the word “‘fitly spoken,’ by one who has 
learned even in the outer approaches to its heart to tread softly, and to 
knock gently and to wait its time for admission’to its most holy place. 
And not more surely will the instrument give back the discord which 
pains the ear attuned to harmony, when too many chords are struck, or the 
delicate flower to close itself from the glare of too strongly focused sunlight, 
than this same child-heart to shrink within itself from the clatter of mean- 
ingless talk, or from too severe demand on its attention. 
School government is a simple problem; indeed, scarcely claims consid- 
eration, where school work is wisely planned, where the teacher reveals no 
lack of se/f-control, and the daily requirements are made in cheerful mood, 
and brave, believing spirit. 
The conviction grows upon us, and strengthens with the years of service, 
that much of fruitless labor is expended and richest opportunity lost in the 
effort to harvest mature results in blossom-time; to secure in a brief term 
that which can only be the result of years of growth. 
We hesitate sometimes to live up to the light within us in this regard, 
lest our ideals seem to’fall below the prevailing measures of the teacher’s 
worth and work; and in our blind fear of official supervision, or of public 
demand, plod on in the safe, well-beaten paths. 
Did you, my fellow-teacher, ever seek the criticism of your methods from 
pupils who have passed out from your direction, and having changed their 
“point of view,” have put their school discipline to the test in the sterner 
discipline of daily living? And what lines of requirement have in this way 
been witnessed to you as of permanent value? There is here an open field 
for investigation afforded in return for continuous years of service, whose 
wealth is not easily exhausted, and whose fruit is for our comforting or for 
our regret, according to our sowing. 
Much of that which tradition would have us believe essential in school 
management, fails to win the approval of mature years; and that which has 
been resorted to through no higher philosophy than the desire to give pleas- 
ure, comes back to us as a conscious source of joyful memory of school-life, 
long after the incident has passed from the teacher’s mind. 
Happy is the teacher to whom the avenues of free communication with 
numbers of those once learners at his feet, but now among the world’s 
workers by his side, are ever open and accessible. And right here may be

discovered one source of the diminished numbers of boys in the upper classes 
of our elementary schools—for making due allowance for the claims of 
home and business life, large numbers of those for whose early withdrawal 
no known statistics as yet give clear account, seek glad release from the 
constraints and petty requirements which in childhood, if no less harmful, 
are more readily forgotten. 
Among these fruitless requirements may be suggested the formal and 
solemn processions moving in and out of our large school buildings at as- 
sembling and dismissal times— policed by whatever force the building can 
command, of no less formal teachers, with folded arms and watchful eyes, 
waiting, spider-like, for a victim—who with some human sense still alive 
within his jacket, by merry glance, or playful word, or uncanny gait, does 
not fail to hold in nice adjustment this old law of supply for evident de- 
mand. 
Or to another prevalent custom, in which all little liberties of movement 
such as minister to personal comfort and convenience, or to mutual helpful- 
ness, must be preferred as requests to be granted or denied, oftener through 
the false sense of dignity and of devotion to an assumed claim for “order,” 
than from intelligent conviction of the purpose for which a reasonable de- 
gree of order must be maintained. 
If the school-room witnessed less of authority and more of the “sweet rea- 
sonableness” of happy home-life, much of its friction would be overcome, and 
the teacher’s force conserved for worthier work. 
A company of merry boys are engaged in a game of ball, or are chatting 
pleasantly in groups, when the bell summons them to their morning tasks. 
Is there any reason which will bear the light, why these boys must pass to a 
designated part of the school-yard, arrange themselves in long, straight 
lines, and march with military precision and in unnatural silence to their 
respective rooms? And is any needful element of discipline and of orderly 
living lacking in the school’ whose halls are sometimes heard to echo with 
unmeasured tread, with glad good-mornings, and with merry laughter? 
I shall not soon forget once seeing in a city school-yard, from which all 
but a single pupil had fled from the intense cold of a winter’s morning, a 
bright, active boy still occupied in some snow frolic, when the morning bell 
was heard; and, although standing within direct reach of the door-way, he 
loyally retreated to his accustomed place for “forming ranks,” made of his 
one self the straight “line,” considered essential to the day’s proper begin- 
ning, and marched dutifully up stairs. Had there been fifty of him, the 
line could have been no more steadily held to its required place, or the tread 
more uniform and prison-like. 
Were such measures attempted in any company of cultivated gentlemen 
in real life, the folly would work its own speedy abatement. And are not 
the habits of intelligent gentlemen good also for our boys? 
Must there be one standard of refinement for the school, and another for

the home and for the street? Or may we ask only of our boys and girls the 
same considerate carefulness with reference to time and place, the same re- 
gard for the comfort and convenience of their fellows, which al/ unselfish, 
fine-grained souls extend to those who touch their lives, either upon the 
street, within the home, or in the place of public assembly? Is the boy’s 
home lacking in the amenities and graces of the more favored? Then the 
more imperative is the need for placing him, while under school-training, at 
once and continually upon such practice as will tend to make his lessons in 
politeness a permanent possession. 
A restless little girl, every fiber of whose being is in active protest against 
the confinement to her allotted place in the long row of little desks and 
chairs, spies within easy reach, and perhaps in more comfortable locality, a 
vacant seat. With the quickness of abounding life she slips into the unused 
seat, and is made happier in the simple consciousness of new surroundings. 
Does this slight act mar the order of a well-regulated school? and if done 
for simple gratification, is it worthy of remonstrance or reproof ? 
Why should the little people always be required to occupy assigned places? 
and, save for the purpose of a place for keeping their tools for ready use, 
why may they not exercise the same freedom in movement, the same choice 
in location, which, under a watchful mother’s care, they have at home? 
A little girl was asked the old-fashioned question, “ Why do you go to 
school?” and with delightful spontaneitytame the reply: “To sit in position.” 
Another, to whom the same impertinent query was propounded, replied with 
no less hesitancy, “To keep my pencil sharp.” “And is that all you go to 
school for, little girl?” pursued her questioner. ‘“ Yes, ma’am; and there is a 
lady comes most every day to our room to see all our pencils!” referring to the 
visiting superior, to whose especial oversight the class to which the wee one 
belonged was committed. Another, who had in her recent promotion passed 
from the care of one of the over-strict, went home at the close of a single 
day’s experience of happier ways, repeating over and over to herself, “Such 
a sweet teacher!” “Such a lovely teacher!” until her mother interrupted her 
soliloquy to ask her what it was that made her love her new teacher so 
dearly; and received reply: “O, mamma, she is so sweet and lovely; she 
lets us put our feet right outside the irons!” referring to the supports which 
had served the double purpose of keeping her tiny desk in place, and giving 
her a sense of torture hardly second to real imprisonment. 
“To keep the feet within the irons,” to keep the pencils sharpened to -so 
fine a point as to cause real trembling of heart lest in some unlucky move- 
ment the wonderful instrument be wrecked, “to sit in position,”—are these 
the most vivid lessons which should be carried home in first school-days, to 
the mothers of those whose lives should be as free as are the birds of the 
air? Nor were the teachers of these little ones wholly to blame. They 
were young, true-hearted and affectionate girls, aspiring to do their whole 
duty according to accepted standards.

One winter afternoon, two little boys were noticed on their way from school, 
looking intently upward at the bare branches of a stately elm, from which 
swayed an empty nest. One, with a well-rounded missile in his hand, and 
with his hunter's face keenly aglow with the certainty that he should bring 
down his prey, was taking sure aim at the deserted home. The other, with 
his face full of earnest remonstrance, and his voice quivering with intense 
protest, his hand laid lightly on his playmate’s upraised arm, pleaded, “No, 
no, Jamie; you don’t want to bring down that nest; now you don’t!” Jamie 
hesitated; when his mentor continued, “For don’t you know, Jamie, that 
when the mamma-bird comes back to her old house next summer, and there 
isn’t any house there, she’ll feel awfully, and then you will be a ’shamed 
fellow!” 
The lifted arm relaxed, and the two went happily on their way; while the 
empty nest still bears silent witness to the permanent good wrought by the 
instruction of one teacher, who had found other thought for baby-minds 
than position and pencil-points; and from whose lessons there was inwrought 
into the lives of a multitude of pupils a “thread of gold.” 
Fifty little children from the miscellaneous home-life in a manufacturing 
community, appear at the opening of a school-year “just six” or “under 
seven” years old. They have known little restraint, are ignorant of school- 
room ways, and have not all been trained by wise mothers to give quick 
heed to the spoken word. They Sit wherever they find place, or shrink 
from notice, or roam about the room, according to their “own sweet will,” 
and no word eyen of slightest suggestion is spoken by the wise woman who 
has them all in charge, and who is studying their needs with a philosophy 
and a discernment unaided by “normal school,” or “institute,” or even 
“teachers’ journal;” and with only the conscious purpose of knowing the 
children before teaching them. 
A word with one and then another, with reference always to the interests 
familiar to them all—the kitten, the canary, the baby, their mothers —with 
wise tact leading them away from their too-ready revelation of home secrets, 
and soon these half-hundred children are, without direction, seated, quiet, 
and with a delightful freedom from self-consciousness, learning to listen, as 
in pleasant, firm, homelike tone of voice, they are given a lesson—not in 
reading, or number, or behavior even, but on the exquisite snow-crystals 
which are just then filling the air—are led to see that these beautiful forms 
come softly, and that each has its place on the brown earth which they to- 
gether cover and beautify. Or the patch of shimmering sunshine on the 
floor suggests another lesson of busy, quiet life and motion. 
When these children are dismissed they may be seen watching intently 
the leaf-shadows, or catching on their mittened hands the crystals, which 
they are to “make” when they come again to school. 
Next morning they are busy with their slates, and as one after another is 
discovered to be taller than his neighbor they are asked to change places,
-P-A-G-E-493

. so that all can see; and thus their first lesson in thoughtfulness for others 
finds its place, while the teacher has accomplished unnoticed the work — 
difficult sometimes— of arranging all in pleasing and convenient order. 
Again, the children are all standing at the blackboard “making” the 
erystals or the leaf-shadows, chatting freely and without reproof as each 
. surveys the work of all—aimless, clumsy lines, yet the beginning of the 
drawing-lessons. 
The blackboard is not spared, but is soon found to serve other design 
than to be kept “clean,” and is a never-failing source of pleasure. Of 
course these children learn to read and to write, to count and to draw, for 
the use and need of these means are soon discovered, and no needless diffi- 
culties are placed in the way of their acquirement. 
Is this sketch of real work too fanciful, the work itself too simple, the 
outcome unsatisfactory? The repeated testimony to its enduring quality has 
been beyond question. 
I recall a morning in which one for many years filling an honored place 
in this Association, coming from an hour in the school-room which we have 
pictured, said with an intense earnestness, “It is the finest training of little 
children I ever saw. Could I do it half so well, I would never do anything 
else.” And yet in this school-room permissions were never asked; advan- 
tage was seldom taken; reproof was absolutely unknown; the needless rub- 
bish of “ranks,” and “counts,” the tedious “one, two, three, four,’ the 
finger-snapping, and the signals endless and wearisome, had no place. 
The secret of such skill cannot always be discerned at once, and can no 
more be analyzed than can the fragrance of the water-lily; yet we may find 
in its study at least a seed-thought, which will repay maturing. 
INDIVIDUALITY OF TEACHERS. 
J. M. DEWBERRY, MONTGOMERY, ALABAMA. 
One meaning of the word “individuality” is “A state of oneness.” If this 
subject involves matrimony, I am prepared either to contend for individuality 
or to oppose it, just as my safety and comfort may demand; but when school- 
room work is involved, I can but champion it. The person who has absorbed 
the ideas and thoughts of others so that he possesses but few characteristics 
of his own, is not a.competent teacher. To engraft an idea or to fix a prin- 
ciple in the human mind requires original, native strength. This is some- 
thing that the teacher has but to cultivate in order to possess in a large 
degree. No intellectual miser or combination of fanatics can monopolize 
this power. It belongs to everybody, and all may use it. No two people 
 
-P-A-G-E-494

can do things exactly alike, and the principal or superintendent who expects 
a teacher to teach exactly as he would teach is foolish; and doubly foolish 
is the teacher who attempts to ape anyone. That all should obey the same 
general principles is right and necessary, but beyond this is folly and harm. 
It concerns teachers of elementary schools, where system is more perfect and 
rigid, to know how to adjust themselves even to an iron-bound system. It 
is well, in this connection, to consider the two kinds of school systems with 
‘which the teachers of this department meet. 
First, a most showy and ignorantly complimented system exists, in which 
a school board is the central figure, and the execution of its will the pur- 
pose. As air-castles, the products of fancy and imagination which have but 
little regard for present conditions and actual surroundings, tower in the 
mind as ideals, so it has become an interesting field for some school-men to 
imagine what children should be, instead of what they are; what children 
should need instead of what they do need; what teachers should do instead 
of what they can do; and thus the imagination pictures and soars aloft until 
‘stern realities are neither seen nor provided for. The differences in child- 
life are not considered; teachers are viewed as machines of one make, and 
when the principal opens the throttle they are all expected to make the 
same number of revolutions per minute. Upon this ideal basis the system 
is carefully formed and fitted. So great is its beauty and strength and pop- 
ularity (for it is a free school, you know), that superintendent, teachers, 
pupils, and parents, must bow to it and obey it as if it were a god to be 
worshipped and served. What the teacher is to do with a system like this 
is difficult to tell; but if practicable, it is best to get out of it. Individuality 
has a bad showing, though it is the “one thing needful.” If I were a 
teacher in such a system, and my principal should give me the program for 
the year’s work, which stated that on the 29th day of February section 3 of 
class number 2 must work eleven examples from page 147 of the arithmetic 
on the front board at exactly 23 minutes past 9 A.m., and I must stand to 
the left of the board and have every pupil work by analysis, I would feel 
that either the principal was a fool or that he considered mea fool. Should 
I proceed with that lesson according to the plan laid down, I would not only 
do what was required, but would try to suggest some additional idea or 
thought that would be the subject for pleasant study when the lesson was 
over. 
Second, a better system, instead of having a school board as the sine qua 
non, has the child for the central figure, and the child’s education for its 
purpose. The children must be educated. As it is both"best and cheapest 
to educate them together, a teacher is employed. This is the foundation 
for a good school system. The teacher is put in power. She acts for the 
child’s good. She disciplines as seems best, and uses such methods and devices 
as are hers by invention or appropriation. Unconnected with any other 
school, no higher authority is needed, except a school board, whose duty is
-P-A-G-E-495

not to issue orders concerning school-room work, but to employ and sustain 
the teacher in her efforts for the good of her pupils. 
In cities and towns where a large number of children are to be educated 
together, where many schools exist as one large one, and several large schools 
as one system, the necessity of principals and superintendent arises; not to 
check the teacher, but to aid her; not to suppress individuality, but to aid 
it; not to condemn, but to approve; not to be served, but to serve. Back 
of the superintendent comes the importance of a school board. It repre- 
sents the people, and is intended only to select good teachers and to provide 
for and support the schools. 
For the strength and efficiency of this system there must be some general 
principles and rules to which all must conform when it will not conflict with 
the interests of the child. The superintendent can well judge what general 
plan of work should be followed, but the teacher can best judge of the 
methods which would be most satisfactory and efficient with her class. That 
' system which can give the teacher most power in her own grade, and at the 
same time preserve the harmony of the grades, is the best system. The 
teacher’s position is second to none in importance and responsibility, though 
it may be subordinate in name and remuneration. No class or grade can 
exist independent of the other portions of the school, and it need not inter- 
fere with the teacher’s work to have the hours regular and all in common, 
to have her pupils march out and in according to the directions of the prin- 
cipal, to follow the same plan of discipline, and to have the limit of the 
session’s work fixed. The principal may fix the hour, the teacher should fix 
the work; the principal may fix the amount of the work, the teacher must 
fix the quality of it; the principal may make the regulations for the school, 
the teacher should execute them in her room. That a teacher may be given 
this scope, both in the instruction and the discipline of her class, requires 
that she be wise, conscientious and prudent, possessing the ability to adapt 
the regulations of the school to the advancement and promotion of her own 
class-work, and not simply willing and able to adjust the work to the rules. 
The rules of all good schools are but means to the one great end— education. 
Just at this point arises great trouble for the principal, but he need ex- 
pect nothing else. In every large school, it is a rare thing if some of the 
teachers are not incompetent, especially in some portions of the work; and 
here the principal must watch closely, and aid where aid is needed, but not 
do the work. Teach the teacher instead of doing the work for her, and in- 
stead of issuing special orders that such must or must not be done. It would 
be as reasonable to command a boy to solve a problem that he could not 
without instruction, as to order a teacher to discipline a boy when she did 
not know how. Give the teacher special instruction, and in such a way that 
the knowledge will be hers when she gets it. Thus the teacher may be sus- 
tained in the respect, confidence and authority of her grade. Ifa teacher 
cannot, in a reasonable time, become efficient in her work, and develop that
-P-A-G-E-496
496 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  
individuality both of thought and action that commands the attention and 
respect of her pupils, she is in the wrong field of labor, and justice would 
demand her remoyal. 
The inefficiency of teachers and the desirability of uniform and constant 
advancement in their work has caused what are now found in many of our 
systems—training classes. These are all right, and are productive of con- 
siderable good, but I sometimes wonder where the independence of our pro- 
fession is when teachers are compelled to attend weekly classes, there to recite 
and to receive instruction. Such classes are a blessing to many teachers, and 
should exist for the benefit of those who desire such instruction; but I be- 
lieve that this weekly work should be optional. ' There are occasional meet- 
ings that all should attend, that all may understand alike some change or 
new feature in the school. We are, though we be teachers, individual men 
and women engaged in a distinct work, and our preparation for this work 
should be left to us. A high standard of work should be required at all 
times, and the teacher who does not maintain that standard should be tried 
for the non-performance of duty, and not because she did not attend the 
teachers’ class. We are expected to prepare ourselves for the work before 
entering it, and should be permitted to continue this preparation as we 
choose. I do not in the least contend for the lethargy that seems to havea 
strong hold on some in our profession. I would have every teacher active 
and taking advantage of every possible means of improvement, but let them 
do it from a love for the work and a desire to be more proficient. I woyld 
have the training classes, normal schools, teachers’ institutes, and all such, 
attended by every teacher, but let them go because they wish to do so. 
Too much stress should not be laid on any one way of doing a thing, es- 
pecially of teaching a child. Every child is unlike every other child, and 
requires different training. It is time that pet plans and methods should 
lose some of their favors, and that the compliments of the profession be paid 
to every teacher who thinks soundly, teaches naturally, and disciplines pru- 
dently.

PAPERS AND DISCUSSIONS. 
THE HIGH SCHOOL. 
A. F. NIGHTINGALE, LAKE VIEW, ILLINOIS. 
  
‘The history of secondary education, in common. with all great movements 
whose ultimate sequence is progress, although marked with conflicting opin- 
ions, radical changes, and constant evolution in methods, is interesting in 
the fact that it shows the indubitable growth. of public opinion in favor of 
a better scholastic preparation for the duties of citizenship and the responsi- 
bilities of a business career. 
To the high school has latterly been relegated not only those courses of 
instruction which lead the student to the college and university, to whose 
graduates we must always look for men and women who become eminent in 
art, science, politics, and jurisprudence, but also that training which fur- 
nishes those desiring to teach with an approximate preparation for their 
profession, and which is the minimum of intellectual culture essential to 
business men who would unite contentment and an appreciation of life with 
financial success. The first grand purpose of the high school is to educate 
our children up to the age of eighteen under the benign influence of home. 
If the question is settled that the education of the child at the age of 
fourteen, under the pressing demands of our present civilization, is too 
limited, then it is settled also, beyond the power of argument to contravene 
the logic, that high schools are a necessity. 
‘Whatever is essential for successful citizenship in the intellectual culture 
of the rich, the children of the poor have a right to demand at the hands 
of government. In neither the written nor the unwritten charter of our 
liberties is there a recognition of class distinctions founded upon the inher- 
itance of wealth in blood or money. Since, therefore, the rights of the rich 
and the poor are coéxtensive; since all carry unsheathed the sword of our 
destiny —a free; untrammeled ballot; since the perpetuity of a republican 
form of government is dependent upon the contentment of the majority; 
since the majority will never be able to educate their children at expensive 
institutions beyond the pale of their own neighborhood, the claims of neces- 
sity and duty, as well as of charity and good-will, make it incumbent upon 
us to furnish at the public expense the privileges of higher culture to all 
the children, and to be instant in season and out of season in directing and 
encouraging all to take advantage of these privileges, without which life 
would be only half a life, and the government founded and fostered upon

the consent of the governed constantly threatened with revolution and dis- 
integration. ‘ 
Iam more and more convinced — not because my profession leads me to self- 
ishly foster the opinion, but because its duties naturally enforce this trend of 
thought —that parents do not sufficiently exercise their God-given and law- 
enforced authority over their children during the years of their minority. 
Whether the greed for a better sustenance, the fear of poverty, the short- 
sightedness of reason, or the intractability and restlessness of children super- 
induce this lamentable state of things, it is not in the line of my present 
thought to discover; but it is painfully true that ignorance increases, while 
the opportunities for culture are enlarged. Less than one-third of the chil- 
dren who enter the first year of school are found there at the age of ten; 
another third leave before they are twelve years old; less than three per 
cent. finish the common-school course, and less than one per cent. receive a 
high-school diploma; and yet among this one per cent., at the age of thirty, 
will be found those who own their homes, who are in constant communion 
with the beauties of nature, who extract contentment from literature, who 
found public libraries, who organize associations for the advancement of art 
or science, who are leaders in church and state, who, in fine, constitute those 
great moral forces which discountenance lawlessness and license, and en- 
courage every movement which tends to lift the body politic to a higher 
plane of purity, philanthropy, and patriotism. The duty of the high school 
is then three-fold. First, to. give a broader discipline of mind to the masses 
who will occupy the fields of agriculture, manufacture and commerce, who 
will enter into the minor activities of life and constitute the bone and sinew 
of influence in all the varied departments of government; secondly, to 
furnish a commendable preparation for teaching in the common schools of 
our country; thirdly, to encourage our boys and girls to seeure that scho- 
lastie culture which opens to them the inestimable privileges of the college 
and university curriculum. 
Are these three-fold purposes in any sense antagonistic, the one to the 
other? May they be so dove-tailed into a course of study as to make an 
harmonious unit? or are three distinct courses necessary for the accomplish- 
ment of three distinct ends? I do not propose to anticipate the report which 
we are to have to-morrow on “A Uniform Course of Study for High Schools,” 
but only to present a few general thoughts on the special lines of work rele- 
gated to the secondary department of our national school system. I see no 
vital reason why pupils may not pass out of the same door, whether they 
are to enter into the activities of life, into the academical or scientific de- 
partment of a college, or into the work of the teacher of the common school. 
The great end of all study is not bread and butter, but power—moral and 
intellectual power— by which one’s horizon is widened, one’s appreciation 
of nature enlarged, one’s ideals of life broadened and brightened, one’s abil- 
ity to extract contentment, satisfaction, and success out of life, strengthened ;  
-P-A-G-E-503
  THE HIGH SCHOOL. 503 
indeed, that power which will enable a man to exemplify the truth that “A 
man’s a man for a’ that, and a’ that.” 
Every stable superstructure demands firm foundations. It matters not 
whether a dwelling-house, an office, a store, a church, or a school-house is to, 
be erected, the foundation-stones must be the same—deep laid, safely laid 
beyond quicksand and frost, and the ravages of time. To be sure, one may 
build a temporary structure upon the sand; but when the winds blow and 
the floods come, that house will not stand. The parallel is an old one, 
but I believe a true one. The intimate connection between, indeed, the in- 
dissoluble interlacing of the material and the mental are such that the de- 
velopment and durability of the one are dependent upon the same causes as 
those of the other. I therefore believe with Lord Macaulay, “that men who 
have been engaged up to one- or two-and-twenty in studies which have no 
immediate connection with the business of any profession, and of which the 
effect is merely to open, invigorate and to strengthen the mind, will gener- 
ally be found in the business of every profession, superior to men who have 
at eighteen or nineteen devoted themselves to the especial studies of their 
calling.” If this be true or even partially true of the man up to the age of 
two-and-twenty, which includes a college course, how much more approxi- 
mately true it is of the child under eighteen. 
I am therefore convinced that in every good high school there should be 
one broad, elastic, and in many respects elective course of study, which shall 
be best adapted to the natural unfolding of the mental faculties of a child 
from fourteen to eighteen years of age, with all proper regard for a Mill or 
a Milton, an Edison or a Stephenson, who may be endowed with some rare 
gift of genius, which is above and beyond all acquirements resulting from 
the plodding, daily-routine toil of school-life. 
In that course of study should be two or three foreign languages, ancient 
and modern, from which a choice of one should be made. There should be 
systematic work in the study of English, from the beginning to the end of 
the curriculum. Mathematics should hold their time-honored place; his- 
tory, especially English history, and the study of citizenship, should not be 
neglected; and lastly, the natural and physical sciences, if instruction can 
be given in accordance with the laws laid down in the great book of nature, 
demand a large and prominent place. We are to listen to-day to a paper 
upon “The High School and the Citizen.”’ I shall, therefore, waive all dis- 
cussion of that topic. We shall also have some remarks upon Manual 
Training ; and to-morrow the unfolding of a subject which is vitalizing to all 
our secondary instruction, viz., “The Study of English.” 
But there is one topic which I regret is not upon our program—a topic 
receiving universal attention, and whose claims demand universal recogni- 
tion. I refer to the sciences, and the methods of their presentation. My 
own individual instruction has always been along the line of the ancient 
classics. My contributions to educational literature have mainly been an
-P-A-G-E-504
504 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
advocacy of the paramount importance of the study of languages as furnish- 
ing the keenest weapons of warfare in all scholastic conflicts, as being funda- 
mental to all true culture, and as essential to the fullest development of 
intellect in all its varied and multiplied powers for the civilization of the 
human race; and my profoundest convictions still coincide with the expres- 
sion of ex-President Porter, of Yale University, that “The controversies 
of the past few years in respect to humane and literary studies have estab- 
lished the conviction beyond question, that there is no substitute for classical 
culture.” With such thoughts, and such prejudices, if you please, and after 
riding the classical hobby for a quarter of a century, I can approach the 
question of “What is the proper place for the sciences in our schools?” with 
no danger of being accused that I offer the arguments of a science specialist. 
With a few reflections upon this subject, I shall close my address. 
Within the past fifteen years much has been said and written upon the 
general question of the classics versus the sciences, as factors in an educa- 
tionalscheme. Each has its advocates for the first place, and the discussion, 
while often waxing to a white heat, has, notwithstanding, advanced the cause 
of pedagogical science, and resulted in great good to both parties. Each 
side has been put to its mettle in the controversy, and arguments, based 
upon a knowledge of the ends of education, and of the nature of the human 
intellect, have been brought forward in support of the claims of each. A 
literature on the subject of pedagogy has grown up in this country, within 
the time above mentioned, to attest that the subject of education has been 
studied as a science, and a potent stimulus to this study has been the feeling 
of those interested in the classics-science question that a vital matter was in 
hand, and that the result held in it the solution of a most important prob- 
lem in education. As is often the case in such debates, the outcome has 
been far different from what either side expected. The advocates for the 
sciences have yielded so far as to subscribe to the clearly established propo- 
sition, that courses of fourteen weeks each in physiology, zodlogy, botany, 
chemistry, physics, and geology, conned and recited from texts as a mere 
exercise in memory, have never filled the place which science should fill in 
any well-balanced educational curriculum. : 
Other functions of the mind than those trained by the classics, such as 
the power of observation, facility in inductive reasoning, and the ability to 
compare and interpret the phenomena of nature, require the employment of 
such studies as biology and physics for their proper’unfolding. But they 
must be pursued and are now generally pursued in a far different manner 
from that in which they were when their position was assailed by the en- 
thusiast for the classics. Laboratory methods are the outcome of the inves- 
tigation, since the science teacher sees that by them he is to accomplish that 
which it is his apportioned task to accomplish, in the development of the 
child’s mind. 
The function of the study of the sciences in a system of education is now
-P-A-G-E-505

recognized, and its right to a place on a par with the studies of language 
and mathematics is acknowledged. It has been seen that there are faculties 
of the mind which, in training, need just the shaping which comes to them 
from the scientific method in science-work; and since the object and aim of 
this work has been made clear, as a result of the thought and investigation 
which have been thrown into this controversy, none of us can say that it has 
been entered into in vain. Not only have the results to be secured to the 
child by the study of nature been clearly stated, but in the main the method 
has been agreed upon by which these are to be brought about. If the power 
of observation is to be made keen, the pupil must observe, and make known 
what he observes. If the ability is sought to gather data and compare them 
for the purpose of finding the reasons for phenomena in the phenomena, then 
exercises in such personal investigation are necessary. If Nature is to be an 
open book, her language must be understood, and this can only be acquired 
by direct converse with her. If the principles of matter endowed with life 
are to be investigated, specimens of animal or plant life must be placed be- 
fore the student as the objects of his study. If the field of physical sciences 
is to be entered, then experiments in these subjects must be performed and 
studied, that the principles involved may be discovered. 
To this point there seems to be a general agreement among those engaged 
in science-work in the better high schools of the country. To investigate 
very far, however, into the biological or physical sciences requires facilities 
in the shape of microscopes, tables, reigents and apparatus, which ought to 
be furnished to every school claiming to be well equipped. 
Since the ends of education are the acquirement of an ability to think, to 
express thought, and to act, all the faculties of the mind should be given 
employment during the school. period, and the course of study should be 
shaped to accomplish these ends. Systematic courses in the ancient lan- 
guages and mathematics have long been followed, which cover not only 
the high-school years, but reach into the college or university, and it is 
high time for a systematic course in science, which shall begin, whenever it 
is thought best, in the lower grades, and continue through the high school 
and into the university. Upon careful consideration of this subject we would 
arrange a science course somewhat as follows: 
First year, physiology; second year, zodlogy and botany; third year, 
physics; fourth year, chemistry and astronomy. We would prefer however 
to offer to the first year what, in the above, is the work of the second; to the 
second, what is given as the third, and so on through the course; and this 
could be done if the work in text-book physiology in the first year could be 
eliminated and the most elementary study of this subject relegated to the 
lower grades. Much of physiology now is taught in connection with zodlogy 
and botany, and this plan could be followed still further if the ground-work 
for the study could be laid before the pupil enters the high school. 
This arrangement would enable us to offer chemistry in the third year,  
-P-A-G-E-506
    506 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  
and leave the last year of the course for geology and a general review in 
science. This last step we regard as of great importance, not because of a 
wish to multiply subjects, but because such an arrangement seems necessary 
to the idea of a systematic course in science study continued through the high 
school, parallel with the work in language, and so planned that the student 
shall feel that it is a continuous course as unbroken as his course in Latin. 
As to the order of studies in the above program, there may be some 
questions raised, since an agreement upon this subject has not been reached 
probably by science teachers themselves. But, as has been said before, the 
general method of presenting science studies is fairly well agreed upon, and 
the results sought for are clear. This being true, a great deal has been se- 
cured by the consideration of the above-mentioned question in the science 
of education, and we may safely leave the settlement of the best order of 
presenting these subjects to the near future. 
Before leaving this topic I cannot refrain from urging upon the attention 
of those in charge of the lower schools of our country the desirability of* 
continuing the observation-work, as it is called, in botany and zodlogy, 
which has been begun and carried on to some extent, and of introducing 
text-book physiology and hygiene into their course. In some parts of the 
country this work has been fostered with great, care, since it can be readily 
shown that the acquired habit of observing and comparing plants as to 
simple structure and character gives the high-school work in science double 
its value to the student. It is not necessary that the pupil should have 
studied botany and zodlogy as such; but if he has been led to examine and 
learn the characters, habits and names of a few plants and animals, his 
progress in the same line in the high school will be greatly accelerated. 
I have presented a brief argument in favor of sustaining and strengthen- 
ing the secondary department of our national education. I have claimed 
that the colleges in their requirements for admission, and school superin- 
tendents in offering certificates for positions as teachers in our common 
schools, should demand the pursuit of the same studies as will give the best 
preparation for business life to those who must end their school-work with 
the high-school diploma. I have spoken of the leading topics which should 
enter into our secondary curriculum, and of the claims which the sciences 
make for an important position in a course of study adapted to a new age 
and a new civilization. Ih conclusion, let me express the hope that all our 
discussions will be earnest and practical, based upon experience and obser- 
vation and thought, and inspired with an intense purpose to make our 
schools all that is claimed for them, the nurseries of American patriotism, 
and the safeguard of American liberty.

THE HIGH SCHOOL AND THE CITIZEN. 
H.C. MISSIMER,. ERIE, PENNSYLVANIA. 
In our government each citizen is a part of the governing power —a sov- 
ereign voter to-day, or the people’s representative in office to-morrow. The 
‘sole reason, therefore, for the assumption by the state of the charge of edu- 
cation is the making of good citizens. No part of the fundamental law of 
each of our republican commonwealths can be more important, therefore, 
than that which provides for the education of its children. 
But one State in our Federal Union limits the facilities of education to 
children between the ages of 8 and 16. Four States fix the limits between 
6 and 18, and one between 4 and 16. Two enlarge the limit from 7 to 
20, and another from 5 to 18. One again rises from 7 to 21, and two begin 
at 6 and stop at 20. One starts at 5 and goes to 20, while fourteen fix 
the limits between 6 and 21; one adds another year by beginning at 4 and 
going to 20, and nine preserve the same limit in 5 to 21. Two again gain 
another year by beginning at 4 and running to 21; two fix no limit after 
5, and one, the father of the public school, generously offers free education 
to citizens of all ages. 
Under these beneficent provisions, there were, according to the report of 
the Bureau of Education for 1886-87, 11,811,621 children enrolled in the 
publie schools of the United States. : 
That is to say, one out of every five in our sixty or more millions of peo- 
ple at the present time, is directly subject to the influence of education. To 
the great public who believe education to be the chief agent in suppressing 
ignorance, poverty, and crime, this is indeed a gratifying fact. One out of 
every five at school! Add to this the influence of our libraries and lecture 
bureaus, our newspapers and cheap literature, and how bright to the edu- 
cational believer is the outlook for the future! Little wonder that our ex- 
ultant Talmage said a year or two ago: “ Knowledge rolls its tide at every 
poor man’s door, and if the philosophers of past centuries were required to 
stand in line with our boys and girls, down they would go to the foot of the 
class for failing to answer questions.’ 
More than 90 per cent. of this vast educational army are between the 
-ages of 6 and 13. More than 65 per cent. of them are but 9 years of age 
and under. The great bulk of our school population therefore belongs to 
the primary grades of our common schools. The remaining 10 per cent., 
from the age of 13 and upward, belong to the higher grades. 
In preparing for the duties of future citizenship, the great mass of our 
children, therefore, are limited by the fixed and immutable laws of mental 
growth to the acquisition of those simpler elements of knowledge that un- 
lock the doors to the various callings of life. Little more can be acquired
-P-A-G-E-508
  508 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  
between the ages of six and thirteen than the fundamental knowledge nec- 
essary to ordinary citizenship. The bare duties of the citizen—his duties 
to his neighbor and his country—may be learned; but the obligations to 
perform those duties consciously and conscientiously—the understanding 
of their real nature, their meaning, the responsibilities that attach to them 
in performing the higher functions of government by the people—can only 
be acquired with the wider and deeper growth of mind, with the awakening 
of the mental consciousness and independence that come with the dawn of 
manhood. 
The real work of preparing the citizen for these higher functions of gov- 
ernment must fall, therefore, upon our higher schools. How shall this work 
be done? What shall constitute the preparation ? 
Of equal importance with the knowledge of the duties and rights of the 
citizen, should be the cultivation of those sentiments and virtues which fur- 
nish the right standard of action in the fulfillment of those duties and rights, 
and which constitute the essence of sound national life. To keep alive the 
spark of liberty, we must keep alive the emotions and sentiments that kindle 
up the heart when liberty is in question. Patriotism must therefore be a 
strong motive force in the right exercise of the civic functions. Without 
it, the citizen will have no higher standard in the exercise of his rights than 
the blind unreason of party malice, or the selfish desire of personal gain. 
How shall this great sentiment be cultivated in our public schools? We 
answer, first, through the proper comprehension of the resources of our na- 
tive land. Place once in the minds of our boys and girls a correct idea of 
even but a few of the facts of the physical geography of our great country, 
and we have put into their hearts a constant, never-failing source of patri- 
otic feeling. Think of it! A territory large enough to make 18 States, 
each as large as Spain; or 31 States, each as large as Italy; or 60.States, 
each as large as England and Wales! A country able to take into its 
bosom an empire three times the size of Great Britain and Ireland, France, 
Germany, Austria, and Italy—five of the six great powers of Europe— 
combined, with Spain, Portugal, Switzerland, Denmark and Greece thrown 
in, and not counting in New England, nor Alaska with its magnificent tim- 
ber-lands, the future shipyard of the world! Forty thousand miles of river- 
way, 12,000 miles of indented shore, an@ an area of inland fresh-water lakes 
larger than the area of Great Britain and Ireland together! No wonder 
that Gladstone said that we have a “natural base for the greatest continu- 
ous empire ever established by man.” 
What an inspiring thought, too, in the fact that we feed our sixty-five 
millions and more of people and export 300,000,000 bushels of grain from 
the cultivation of but one-ninth of our arable land, and that if it were all 
cultivated we could, according to reliable authority, (Rev. Dr. Strong, in 
“Our Country,”) feed a population of 900,000,000, and still export over 
5,000,000,000 bushels of grain to feed the hungry in foreign lands.
-P-A-G-E-509
  THE HIGH SCHOOL AND THE CITIZEN. 509 
And then our mineral resources! One-half the gold and silver of the 
world’s supply last year! Iron ore in twenty-three States! The largest 
deposit of copper in the world! Inexhaustible coal measures! The best 
machinery and the best mechanics in the world, turning out to-day steels 
for Sheffield, cotton for Manchester, watches for Geneva; and with certain 
unwise restrictions upon our commerce removed, able to undersell the man- 
ufacturers of the world in the world’s markets! What a promoter of patri- 
otism in the comprehension by our youth of these and kindred facts! 
But again, we may cultivate this element of good-citizenship throughout 
the study of our history and our great men. Our history and our great 
men! Not the bare narrative of events, but the intelligent study of the 
great questions in politics that have made us the great nation we are! Not 
the fact that such-and-such men were famous in American history, but the 
reasons why they were famous; and that behind every crisis in our history 
appears the imperial influence of some imperial man. 
Even our feeble, prosaic beginnings have something in them to awaken 
the spirit of patriotism. There is “the hundred who in their frail little 
bark braved the fury of the elements; who were frowned upon by kings and 
priests ;” but in spite of elements, in spite of royal and priestly opposition, 
reared the sacred altar of liberty in the wild New England wilderness. How 
_ wide an empire acknowledges to-day the sway of their principles! There 
was Captain John Smith, “the man with the soul of a crusader,” whose 
favorite: book was “Marcus Aurelius,” who, “in all his proceedings made 
justice his first guide and experience his second; combatting baseness, sloth, 
pride and iniquity more than any other dangers.” There was William Penn, 
the Quaker, who believed “that the weak, the just, the pious, the devout, are 
allof one religion.” There was Bradford, “the stern governor ;” Oglethorpe, 
with his “strong benevolence of soul;” Miles Standish, “the hero of the 
Indian wars;” Roger Williams, “the tolerant Baptist founder of Provi- 
dence;” Lord Baltimore, the equally tolerant Roman Catholic proprietor 
of Maryland; and Winthrop and Endicott, “the worthy founders of worthy 
lines.” ‘There is patriotism for the young in the study of all these names. 
Then come the men and events of our Revolutionary epoch. Otis, “with 
tongue of flame;” Sam Adams, the eloquent Puritan; Patrick Henry, 
“That forest-born Demosthenes, 
Whose thunder shook the Philip of the seas;” 
Jefferson, our profoundest student of government, author of the declaration 
of independence, originator of the idea of the common-school system, and 
the real founder of our empire in the purchase of Louisiana; Hamilton and 
Madison, the first expounders to the people of our constitution; and those 
two— one, the patriot and sage who : 
“Called the red lightning from the o’er-rushing cloud, 
And dashed the beauteous terror on the ground, smiling majestic;” 
and the other, “ first in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his coun- 
trymen”—‘“the greatest of good men, and the best of great men ”— what
-P-A-G-E-510
  
  510 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  
a heritage to the world; what lessons of patriotism, and therefore of good- 
citizenship, in the proper study of these names. 
And then the great questions of our history, and the other great men be- 
hind them. There is “our Marathon of Bunker Hill” and our Lexington, 
where “By the rude bridge that arched the flood 
Their flag to April’s breeze unfurled; 
In arms the embattled farmers stood, 
And fired the shot heard round the world.” 
And then the convention of the fathers, that formulated the principles of 
liberty in our constitution; the launching of the ship of state, under Wash- 
ington; the great doctrine of protection to American citizenship behind the 
war of 1812; the great compromises on the slavery question, associated with 
the names of Clay, Calhoun, Webster, and Douglas; that great bone of con- 
tention between the parties, the tariff question, never to be settled until set- 
tled right; and the final arbitrament of the question of slavery by the sword 
and the dread conflict of civil war, with that central figure summoned almost 
from the wood-shanty and the store, to be to the people the grandest, strong- 
est, wisest, and most fearless type of American manhood that the world has 
ever seen. ‘ 
The knowledge of these and the other great questions of American his- 
tory are surely a part of the equipment of good-citizenship, but they can 
never be fully comprehended in our schools until after the maturity of mind 
that comes between the ages of thirteen and twenty-one. 
Following the study of our country, its resources, its history, its great 
men, and its great political questions, must come the study of its institutions. 
Our various local governments— ward, township, municipal; our county, 
State, and national government — what is the nature of each, what the rela- 
tion of each to'the other, and what the relations and obligations of the citi- 
zen to each; above all, the essential difference between the State and Federal 
governments, that under the laws and the broad shield of the State we are 
born, we live, we marry, educate our children, labor, get gain, buy and sell, 
enter into contracts, make our wills, and enjoy nine-tenths of all our dearest 
and most precious blessings; while under the protection of the Federal 
Government we live the other tenth of life, travel in foreign lands, hold a 
Federal office, enter the army or navy, defend our rights against foreign 
enemies, correspond with our friends, worship according to the dictates of 
our conscience, speak our mind, and pay our protective taxes—all these are 
questions which our higher schools must solve for the future citizen. They 
must teach him, above all, that to evade, ignore, or to be insensible to his 
responsibilities under each of these governments, is to lose him; or to place 
at the mercy of others that equality to every other man to which he is en- 
titled under the law. 
More important in the training of the citizen than the knowledge of our 
national resources, our history, our great: men, or our institutions, must come 
the knowledge of himself. Education has two sides to it—the intellectual
-P-A-G-E-511

and the moral. In its intellectual side, the side of mental discipline and 
development, education does not make a man morally better; the belief that 
it does so is wrong. Education of the intellect simply increases a man’s 
power—nothing more. It cures no immorality but the immorality that 
proceeds from ignorance. ‘Those other and far more dangerous immoralities 
that are destructive of all governments, that spring up in the wake of civil- 
ization and wealth, education of the intellect can never root out, for the 
simple reason that such education makes them possible. 
Good-citizenship must have in its base another element than the mere 
training of the intellect. It must have those virtues that make good men; 
that impel men to right conduct and right action. There can be no liberty 
without truth, honor, fidelity, industry, temperance, moderation, charity, 
kindness. All these are political elements as much as mere knowledge of 
men, measures, or party. They are elements without which national life 
could not exist. “If it were not’ for these the State would go down as a 
sand-heap.” “You may build your capital of granite,” said Wendell Phil- 
lips, ‘and pile it high as the Rocky Mountains; if it is founded on or mixed 
up with iniquity, the pulse of a girl will in time beat it down.” To teach 
our children what mountains are, what rivers are, what are the mysteries of 
algebra, geometry, Latin, or even the duties of the citizen to society and 
government, without teaching them that passions uncontrolled, impulses 
unrestrained, and appetites unregulated, are sure to bring irretrievable ruin 
in the end, is to omit the most important part of the preparation of the citi- 
zen. This it is the business of the high school to see to, because it must be 
accomplished by appeal to the reason, judgment, common sense, spirit of 
honor, truth and honesty, that begin to crystallize in the ages, with which 
our high schools have to do. Give our youth “those virtues which will en- 
able them to live well in the household, well in the township, well in the 
State, and well in the nation,” and we insure the household and nation 
against enemies within and enemies without. If eternal vigilance be the 
price of liberty, it must be vigilance against every form of dishonesty and 
corruption in private and public life. It cannot compromise with it, nor 
wink at it. It cannot make believe that votes are always bought for the 
good cause; that decisions are always sold to the right side; that God is 
only with the man of money, or that He makes political debauchery one of 
His instruments for good. Liberty is not license; freedom is not freedom 
to do wrong unpunished. “Governments, religion, property, books,” said 
Humboldt, “are nothing but the scaffolding to build a man.” “Men,” said 
Pericles, “are a city, and not walls;” and these it is the duty of the school, 
the high school, to mould and form. 
“. . . Men, high-minded men; 
Men who their duties know, 
And know their rights, and knowing, dare maintain, 
Prevent the long-aimed blow, 
And crush the tyrant, while they rend the chain— 
These constitute a state.”

And as our greatest preacher once said: “The state must see to it that its 
shield is held over the head of every darkling child, until every dark place 
on the continent and every child of poverty shall receive from its mother 
state, its father state, this legacy, precious above every other—the knowl- 
edge of itself, the knowledge of its country, the knowledge of its fellows.”

LAURA DONNAN, INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA. 
While Thomas Jefferson, whose graceful pen had drafted the Declaration 
of Independence, was absent as minister to France; and while John Adams, 
| whose unanswerable arguments had secured the passage of this American 
Magna Charta, was absent as minister to England, there met in convention 
at Philadelphia a body of men said to have included “nearly all the best 
intellect and the ripest political experience that the United States then con- 
tained.” © 
Of these fifty-five “veterans in the war and in the halls of legislation,” 
thirty-three were college-bred men. Franklin and Sherman, the two oldest 
members of the convention, had never had the advantage of a college edu- 
cation; but the gods had granted these two members common-sense, even 
unto wisdom. 
The members of this convention came together “to prevent the fulfillment 
of the prophecies of the downfall of the United States,” and when they 
separated they had framed the constitution, “the most Rees work ever 
struck off at a given time by the brain and purpose of man.’ 
‘When the constitution was brought before the country for ettauedl 
many people had this difficult lesson to learn—particular interests must. 
give way to the general good. But along with the difficult lesson appeared 
the skillful teacher. No teacher ever had a more difficult task to perform, 
and no teacher ever did more effective work than did Alexander Hamilton, 
who taught this fundamental principle so successfully that, in a little more 
than two and one-half years, the constitution recommended became the con- 
stitution ratified by every one of the original thirteen States. Let) all due 
credit be given to his illustrious assistants, Madison and Jay, and to Wash- 
ington and many others who aided by their great personal influence. But 
there are men in every age who cannot be moved by personal influence— 
whose every action is always in the direction in which they see most clearly : 
to such as these, Alexander Hamilton became the star that guided them 
from the darkness of the Confederation into the light of the Constitution. 
How those who established the Union under the constitution, loved it, 
   
-P-A-G-E-513

may be judged by their anxiety for its preservation. In less than one year 
after the new government had been put in operation, one of the framers of 
the constitution thus spoke: “ Knowledge is in every country the surest basis 
of public happiness. In one in which the measures of government receive 
their impressions so immediately from the sense of the community, as in 
ours, it is proportionably essential. To the security of a free constitution it 
(knowledge) contributes in various ways: by convincing those who are in- 
trusted with public administration, that every valuable end of government 
is best answered by the enlightened confidence of the people themselves to 
know and value their own rights; to discern and provide against invasions 
of them; to distinguish between oppression and the necessary exercise of 
lawful authority—between burdens proceeding from a disregard to their 
convenience and those resulting from the inevitable exigencies of society ; to 
discriminate the spirit of liberty from that of licentiousness, cherishing the 
first, avoiding the last, and uniting a speedy but temperate vigilance against 
encroachments with an inviolable respect for the laws.” 
Six years afterwards, from the same lips fell these words: “ Promote, then, 
as an object of primary importance, institutions for the general diffusion of 
knowledge. In proportion as the structure of a government gives force to 
public opinion, it is essential that public opinion should be enlightened.” 
These are the words of a man worthy of the confidence of this people. They 
are the words of George Washington. 
This advice the legislatures of the different States have interpreted in 
various ways. Word has been received from all but three of the thirty- 
eight States in regard to the course of study prescribed by law. In thirty- 
two of these the three R’s, spelling, geography and grammar are considered 
essential to public enlightenment; thirty require United States history to be 
taught; twenty-six, physiology; twenty-three, hygiene; and ten, the con- 
stitution of the United States. 
It would be unwise to set at naught the information and discipline gained 
from any of the above-mentioned subjects, but assuredly no information is 
of greater importance to one destined to administer the affairs of govern- 
ment than the nature of that government which he is to aid in administering. 
Physiology, a required subject in twenty-six States; hygiene in twenty- 
three States; the constitution in but ten States. Is it more important to the 
young American that he should know the venous circulation of the blood, 
than that he should be able to trace every national blunder back to the 
ignorance, negligence or vice of the private citizen? Surely if this opinion 
had prevailed in 1775, the “embattled farmers” who “stood, 
“And fired the shot heard ’round the world,” 
would never have been heard from. : 
To the State superintendents of the different States circulars were sent, 
asking this question: What do you think of making Civil Government a 
required subject in the high schools of your State? Of the thirty-five that
-P-A-G-E-514
514 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  replied, twenty favored it, fourteen were non-committal, and one preferred 
music and drawing. From the nature of these replies, and from the influ- 
ence that the State superintendents have thus far had upon the laws f their 
respective States, it appears that the State superintendents do not differ 
greatly from the legislators in their interpretation of what is essential to 
public enlightenment. 
Through circulars and catalogues were obtained the following stat istics in 
regard to a leading college or university in twenty-seven of the States: Total 
enrollment of these twenty-seven institutions is, seven thousand fo} 
dred sixty-five (7,465); of this number, fifteen per cent. study civil 
_ ment. Since the institutions from which these statistics were obtai 
the leading ones in their respective States, it is fair to suppose 
proportion of students engaged in the study of civil government in 
maining institutions is no greater. Since the whole number of col 
dents enrolled in the United States for the year 1889 is forty-three t 
four hundred fourteen (43,414), fifteen (15) per cent. of these, or six tl 
five hundred twenty-one (6,521), represent the whole number of co ir hun- 
govern- 
ed are 
at the 
the re- 
lege stu- 
ousand 
ousand 
legiates   studying civil government; and since a knowledge of civil government is a 
requirement for admission in but two of the above-mentioned insti tutions, 
and a requirement for graduation in but fourteen of them, it is evident that 
the collegiate educators think that this advice was not meant for them. 
Circulars were sent to the school superintendents of one hundred fourteen 
(114) of our largest cities. Replies were received from ninety-three (93). 
From these replies it was learned that civil government is taught in|the high 
schools of seventy-two (72) of these cities; that it is a required subject in 
sixty-four (64) of them; and that the average time given to this subject, 
where it is taught, is four and six-tenths (4.6) months. In regard to the 
amount of time given, fifty-one (51) city superintendents thought it suffi- 
cient; twenty (20) thought it insufficient; the answers of five (5) were eva- 
sive, and seventeen (17) were non-committal. Thus the sound of th t divine 
voice, wafted upon the inaudible waves of nearly a hundred years, has at 
length struck an harmonious chord in the harp of civilization an 
feebly vibrating. d set it 
Said Horace Mann: “The theory of our government is—not that all 
men, however unfit, shall be voters—but that every man, by the! power of 
reason and the sense of duty, shall become fit to be a voter. Education 
must prepare our citizens to become municipal officers, intelligent jurors, 
honest witnesses, legislators, or competent judges of legislation —in fine, to 
fill all the manifold relations of life.” 
In order that this may be accomplished, there must be schools whose 
pupils while still retaining the impressionableness of childhood, have had 
their reasoning powers somewhat strengthened by previous school discipline. 
These schools must be free to all who are mentally and morally prepared 
for them, and they must exist in such numbers as to accommodate a 
cent. of the young people of our land. fair per

In these schools there should be taught some subject whose object is to 
give the pupils a knowledge of the rights and duties of citizenship, and to 
inspire them with the moral courage to demand their rights and perform 
their duties. 
Does the high school meet these requirements? Let us see. 
As pupils that attend high schools are usually between the ages of four- 
teen and nineteen years, they may safely be said to retain, in a good degree, 
the impressionableness of childhood. As entrance to the high school presup- 
poses six or eight years of school discipline or an equivalent, the reasoning 
powers of such pupils should at least be in a condition of healthy develop- 
ment. Thus the high school fulfills the first requirement. 
As high schools are public schools, they are open to all that are mentally 
and morally ready for them. 
In examining the statistics in regard to schools of secondary instruction, 
it was found that in the year 1850 there were in the United States six 
thousand thirty-five (6,035) academies. In the statistics for 1850 no men- 
tion is made of high schools. For 1860 the figures stand, academies, six 
thousand (6,000); high schools, four hundred (400). For 1870, academies, 
one thousand five hundred and seventeen (1,517); high schools, one thousand 
sixteen (1,016). For 1880, the census reports give no account of academies, 
but place the number of high schools at five thousand four hundred thirty- 
two (5,482). However, from the report of the commissioners of education, 
it was found that the number of academies reported was less than the 
number of high schools. 
These figures would seem to indicate that the high schools are fast sup- 
planting the academies, and we may judge the future influence of the high 
school by the past influence of the academy. 
From the Congressional Directory of the Fiftieth Congress, in regard to 
the four hundred one (401) members, it was found that of the one hundred 
seventy-seven (177) who attended the common schools, seventy‘six (76) went 
to no higher institution; of the one hundred twenty-seven (127) who attended 
academies, eighty-eight (88) went no further; of the eight (8) that gradu- 
ated from high schools, three (3) went no further; that one hundred ninety- 
one (191) attended college, and thirty-two (82) were either self-educated, or 
were educated by private tutors. 
The great influence of the academy and the slight influence of the high 
school in the education of the members of the Fiftieth Congress are ex- 
plained when we consider that the average birth-year of the members of 
this Congress was 1837; that these men were acquiring their schooling be- 
tween the years 1850 and 1860, the very decade in which the influence of the 
academy was at its greatest height. 
But when we consider that out of the one hundred riponwyacnat members 
of the Fifty-first Congress that responded to circulars sent them, fourteen 
(14) are graduates of high schools, it is evident that the influence of the
-P-A-G-E-516
  516 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  
high school even now directly reaches those who are in our national legis- 
lative halls. . Accordingly, the high school meets the second requirement. 
To instruct in the rights and the duties of citizenship is one of the chief 
aims in the study of civil government. In a course in civil government in 
the high school, the constitution of the United States should have the most 
prominent place. Too much time should not be spent in studying about 
the constitution, but the text of this document itself should be studied and 
learned word for word. Great attention should be paid to the meaning of 
words and explanation of the text, and the constitution of the United States 
and that of the State should be frequently compared by the teacher. The 
work should be made as real as possible by showing to the pupils the differ- 
ent kinds of money, bonds, revenue stamps, postage stamps, naturalization 
papers, ete. Special days should be set apart for the discussion of such 
questions as taxation, representation, protection, free trade, right of trial 
by jury, and suffrage. 
If you live in a State where the citizen is practically disfranchised by the 
existence of the gerrymander, take a map of the Congressional districts and 
let the class redistrict the State on the basis of justice. If you are so for- 
tunate as to live in a State in which the Congressional districts are laid off 
on an honest basis, then borrow a map of one of your less fortunate neigh- 
bors, and by contrast show the evil influence of the gerrymander. If you 
live in a State where mob violence is of frequent occurrence, you will have 
at hand numerous illustrations of the all-pervading injury inflicted upon a 
community by the insecurity of life; but if you live in a State where mob 
violence does not occur, show by contrast how security of life increases the 
population, enhances the value of property, and blesses a community with 
an all-pervading confidence. In the discussion of all these questions sug- 
gested by the study of the constitution, the pupils should be encouraged to 
express fully their opinions, however unusual or unpopular they may be. 
After the text of the constitution has been learned and discussed, every 
pupil should be required to write and read a review of the Magna Charta, 
Franklin’s Plan of Union, the Declaration of Independence, Articles of 
Confederation, the Ordinance of 1787, and Washington’s Farewell Address. 
In doing this work, it should be suggested to the pupils that they are to keep 
the constitution ever in mind, and that they are to study these documents in 
their relation to one another as well as individually. This much work 
should be required of every pupil. 
In regard to books, some one has said: “One should give his works the 
greatest possible variety and excellence, so that each reader may be able to 
select something for himself, and thus, in his own way, become a partic- 
ipant.” Does not this thought hold good in regard to recitations? 
In every class there are boys and girls that have quick and retentive 
memories and good voices. To such as these it would be a pleasure to re- 
cite in the presence of the class the words of some of the prominent American 
 
-P-A-G-E-517
THE HIGH SCHOOL AND THE CITIZEN. 517 
statesmen. There is no better way of learning the political history of a 
country than through the speeches of its prominent political leaders. A 
very fair knowledge of our political history may be acquired from the Ora- 
tions of American Statesmen, compiled by Alexander Johnston. 
Other pupils are rapid, comprehensive readers, and ready writers.. These 
should be encouraged to review books. Among the many books suitable ° 
for this purpose are: The Man Without a Country, The Story of Liberty, 
Old Times in the Colonies, Building the Nation, Boys of ’76, Rise of the 
Republic, The Federalist, Boys of ’61, Drum-Beat of the Nation, Lives of 
the Presidents, Lives of American Statesmen, American Commonwealths, 
the constitution of their own State; and books on free trade and protection, 
among which may be mentioned Diversity of Industries, by Nordhoff, and 
Tom Torrey’s Tariff Tales, by Edward Everett Hale. These reviews should 
be read before the class, and thus much historical information would be 
disseminated, and many lessons in patriotism inculcated. 
Many boys and girls are fond of debate. For such as these a United 
States Senate should be organized. This senate should be governed by the 
rules adopted by the United States Senate, at Washington, and the parlia- 
mentary forms should be strictly observed. The purpose of the senate should 
be three-fold: to teach them the duties of a legislator; to keep them in- 
formed as to who are the United States Senators; to interest them in what 
is being done in the United States Senate. The first purpose is accomplished 
by the introduction, discussion and passage of bills. The second purpose is 
accomplished by having each pupil take, as his or her senate name, the name 
of some United States Senator. The third object is accomplished when the 
school United States Senate takes up some question under discussion in the 
United States Senate, at Washington, and each pupil-senator gives such 
arguments as have been given by the United States Senator whose name he 
has assumed. The senate should meet once a week after school, and the 
teacher should always be present, but should hold no position in the senate 
unless that of doorkeeper. 
Some pupils have talent for drawing, and considerable skill in presenting 
facts by means of maps and charts. These should be encouraged to draw 
maps showing the vote cast at a given presidential election, and charts rep- 
resenting the fluctuations in imports, exports, revenue, ete., for a given 
number of years. 
A very profitable part of the supplemental work in civil government is a 
paper, read oncea week. This is a compilation of clippings from the various 
newspapers, and confined to the political and governmental affairs of our 
country. The paper is read by a manager chosen by the class, and the clip- 
pings are made by different assistants appointed each week by the teacher. 
As all the pupils contribute to this paper, clippings expressing the views of 
the different political parties will be found in it. The two greatest benefits 
derived from this work are that the pupils are encouraged to read the daily 
33—N. EB. A.  
-P-A-G-E-518

papers, and that they become accustomed to hear both sides of a question 
presented. 
Connected with the weekly paper, both as to nature and purpose, there 
should bea daily bulletin. A portion of the blackboard in the civil-gov- 
ernment class-room should be used for this purpose, and one or more pupils 
should be held responsible each day for items on the bulletin. 
It is reasonable to suppose that justice is sometimes, at least, defeated from 
the fact that witnesses are not familiar with the customs and forms of the 
court-room. At the end of the term a trial, in which the judge, attorneys, 
jurors, witnesses, and all parties engaged are members of the class, does 
much toward familiarizing the boys and girls with the customs of the court- 
room. If the teacher will only furnish the blanks, there need be no concern 
in regard to the zeal of the pupils. No more real work is done in any branch 
of study in the same time, than is accomplished in preparing and conduct- 
ing the trial. The trial seems to be a vital matter not only with the mem- 
bers of the civil-government class, but their interest seems contagious, so 
that it is no unusual thing for fifty or a hundred pupils who are not study- 
ing civil government, but who have a vacant hour at the time of the trial, 
to be in attendance. 
That the course in civil government traced in this paper is not mere 
theory, is proven by the fact that in at least one city in the United States 
it is realized in its minutest detail. The time given to it is five months. If 
more time were given much valuable information could be gained in regard 
to the State, county, and city government. But as the constitution of the 
United States is the archetype of the State, county, and city governments, 
and as the time given to the study of civil government in the high schools 
is about five months, it is deemed advisable to give by far the greatest share 
of attention to the national constitution and to the State papers closely re- 
lated to it. 
A person may be said to be educated as a citizen when he has the mental 
power to see the right in regard to his fellow-citizens and the government, 
and the moral courage to do it. It should be the constant aim on the part 
of the teachers of civil government to make the moral courage of the pupils 
equal to their intelligence; to fill them with a desire to possess the essential 
attributes of a good citizen by showing them that he alone has a right to 
be considered a model citizen of the Republic who loves his neighbor as 
himself, and his country and justice better than either; to strengthen the 
faith of the boys and girls in their own possibilities, for he spoke truly who 
said, “The whole value of history, of biography, is to increase self-trust by 
demonstrating what man can be and do.” 
“A true lover of the virtue of patriotism delights to contemplate its- 
purest models; and that love of country may be well suspected which affects 
to soar so high into the regions of sentiment as to be lost and absorbed in 
the abstract feeling, and becomes too elevated or too refined to glow with

fervor in the commendation or the love of individual benefactors. We may 
be assured that he who really loves the thing itself, loves its finest exhibi- 
tions,” and that he who loves its finest exhibitions, loves the thing itself. 
We, as teachers, then have to 
“Keep but the model safe; new men will rise 
To take its mould.” 
But are we keeping the model safe? Let us see: 
To the superintendents of police in fifty of our largest cities, civoulars 
were sent containing the following questions: 5 
1. How many anarchists in your city? , 
2. Is there any anarchist Sunday-school ? i 
3. Are there any anarchist organizations? 
To these circulars, the authorities of thirty-seven cities replied. From 
these replies it was learned that in thirteen of these cities there are no an- 
archists; in thirteen others there are no anarchists known of; in the remain- 
ing eleven there are anarchists. That in one of these cities there is an 
anarchist Sunday-school, and in five of them there are anarchist organiza- 
tions. That the number of anarchists reported is eight hundred and eighty. 
These figures become much more significant when we consider that the three 
cities in which this leprous disease showed itself most prevalent several 
years ago have as yet not sent in their returns. 
‘When we consider that according to the most recent statistics thirteen 
(13) per cent. of the population of the United States, ten years of age and 
over, cannot read; that in the year 1888 the foreigners who came to the 
United States numbered five hundred and forty-six thousand eight hun- 
dred and eighty-nine (546,889), fifty (50) per cent. of whom were illiterate; 
and that there are those within our borders who claim it as their divine mis- 
sion to turn the Republic into anarchy; if we believe, even with a great 
degree of allowance in favor of the ignorant man, that “he who cannot read 
our constitution; who does not understand its provisions; who would not 
on a just occasion assert its principles, no more sustains the character of an 
American citizen than the man who would not seal it with his blood,” can 
we doubt that there exists a great field for labor? 
But when we consider the great effort that Nature herself seems to have 
made to make us one; that the railroad has bound us together under foot 
by numerous iron bands; that the telegraph and telephone have bound us 
together over-head by a net-work of ever-talking wires, can we doubt that 
there must be some institution whose purpose it is to bind us together heart 
to heart and mind to mind ? 
When we look back over the progress of this nation, and see that the 
most significant figure in the sum of particular interests has been blotted 
out, and that there now exists among us no institution whose preservation 
depends on ignorance, but that the preservation of the Republic depends 
upon “men of wisdom and virtue—qualities which must be propagated by

a virtuous education of youth;” when we consider the great unifying force 
of the common schools, and the great adaptability of the high schools for 
instruction in citizenship, can we doubt the words of him who, in regard to 
. what each State will bring to the great aggregate of this nation’s increase, 
said, “ When the harvests from the fields, the cattle from the hills, and the 
ores from the earth, shall have been weighed, counted, and valued, we will 
turn from them all to crown with the highest honor the State that has most 
promdéted education, virtue, justice and patriotism among its people”?

METHODS OF STUDY IN ENGLISH. 
M. W. SMITH,* BOND HILL, OHIO. 
“Nay, truly, it [English] hath that praise that it wants not grammar; for gram- 
mar it might have, but needs it not; being so easy in itself, and so void of those 
cumbersome differences of cases, genders, moods, and tenses, whigh, I think, was a 
piece of the tower of Babylon’s curse, that a man should be put tq school to learn his 
mother tongue.” 
When Sir Philip Sidney wrote the above, there was no English grammar 
in existence. All the great writers of the Elizabethan age were not “put 
to school” to learn their mother tongue. Their knowledge of its simple 
structure came to them through translations from the classics. Ben Jonson 
wrote the first English grammar, but it was only a fragment, and hardly a 
literary curiosity. Since then, by a queer kind of perversity, English gram- 
mars have become more and more complex, until it is now almost an impos- 
sibility for a pupil to master a recent English text-book. The nomenclature 
is so cumbersome, illogical, and often so incoherent, that I have often won- 
dered whether the compiler understood it himself. 
What intensifies the absurdity of the text of English grammars is, that the 
compilers evidently never thought that what Sidney said is true. English 
has very little technical grammar. Tell this to the present school-boy and 
he will look at you with amazement. And he has good reason to do so, for 
the one thing above all others that the school-master succeeds in making 
repulsive to him is English grammar. 
The most of our so-called syntax belongs to rhetoric. How very few seem 
to realize it! Rhetoric is usually considered a kind of ornamental subject 
that the pupil must be able to say he has gone through—that is all. As 
style is the easiest thing to write about, this is made very attractive, although 
of no practical use to the pupil; for, strange as the assertion may appear, a 
thorough knowledge of English can never be acquired by a study of style ;   
*See page 47.

METHODS OF STUDY IN ENGLISH. 521 
nor, in spite of what some distinguished authors have said to the contrary, 
will that study improve a writer’s style, unless he become a mere imitator 
and thus lose his individuality. 
As for the higher study, that of literature, the high-school pupil has had 
no suitable preparation, and is therefore totally unfitted to begin the sub- 
ject. His vocabulary is too limited, his knowledge of the grammar of the 
English sentence is extremely defective, and his practical qualifications in 
a knowledge of rhetorical forms are absolutely wanting. The teacher often 
works around these obstacles by teaching biography instead of literature, 
and converting the selected works of various authors into supplementary 
reading-books. 
These pessimistic views, which it would be a pleasure to amplify if space 
allowed, have led me to the conclusion that in a great majority of schools 
it is “a piece of the tower of Babylon’s curse to be put to school to learn 
our mother tongue.” 
The fact is, the best teaching of English is done, as it was done in Sid- 
ney’s time, by the teachers of the classics. Translations of Greek and Latin 
idioms into really good English, give pupils a discipline combined with a 
knowledge of English which few teachers of English have yet been able to 
equal. True, the tools of the classical teacher have been undergoing im- 
provement for centuries, while those of the English teacher are almost as 
crude as those of the savage. Can the latter be made any better? That 
is what this brief paper will undertake to show. 
It seems to me that any logical method of teaching English must include: 
(1) A good vocabulary; (2) a fair knowledge of the art of versification ; 
(8) a thorough understanding of what constitutes a correct sentence; (4) a 
good knowledge of the most familiar figurative forms; (5) the elements of 
criticism; (6) a familiarity with some of the best works of our greatest 
writers. 
This method should be a positive, not a negative, one. The most per- 
nicious work done in school to-day, so far as English is concerned, is the 
teaching of incorrect forms. The so-called false syntax and bad rhetoric 
have never done any good, and never will do any. On the contrary, the 
harm has been incalculable. If the pupil is taught that which is right, 
that which is wrong will be readily recognized by him. Why, then, should 
that which is wrong be taught first? The answer is at hand: It is easier 
for the teacher to do so. Let him try to prove that a sentence is correct, 
and many of his resources seldom called into play will have to be used, 
_much to his astonishment. 
The vocabularies of a majority of high-school pupils are amazingly small. 
I always try to use simple English, and yet I have talked to classes when 
quite a minority of the pupils did not comprehend more than half of what 
Isaid. The etymology of words is almost entirely unknown to them. Very 
often, in using the dictionary, when the same word has different definitions, 
 
-P-A-G-E-522
  522 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
the wrong definition will be selected, notwithstanding the nonsense resulting 
' from the selection. Forty years ago etymology was a regular study in most 
of the schools. Why it has been abandoned is incomprehensible to me; 
for any teacher can easily see, upon a moment's reflection, that, having 
mastered the literal meaning of a word, the applied meanings can be deduced 
much more readily than by any other means. 
Etymology, therefore, is the first subject to be studied systematically. It 
cannot, of course, be exhaustive; but it can include all the prefixes and 
suffixes, and the most familiar root-words of Latin and Greek and English 
origin — that is, it should be full enough to stimulate the pupil to continue 
* the work for himself, thus instilling into him the habit of hunting up words 
‘in the proper way. 
There was a time when versifiers exhausted their ingenuity in securing 
variety of form. They did not write much poetry, but the form, at any 
rate, was accurate. This was much better than to have real poetry written 
in unsightly verses. The great poet, without any technical knowledge of 
prosody, will have so accurate an ear as never seriously to mar the rhythm 
of his verses; but many writers of at least occasional merit in versification 
are not so true in their constructions. Even when they happen, as they 
sometimes do, to write correct verse, its form is often entirely unfitted for 
the subject that is treated. But a great many never write verses, and never 
will, who enjoy poetry very much. To them, a fair knowledge of poetical 
forms is essential, because it will add to their pleasure in the study of a 
poem. The elements of prosody in English are very simple, and hence 
easily learned. This, therefore, ought to be the second step in the study of 
English. 
A correct English sentence implies more than a mere conformity to the 
rules of grammar. It should strictly conform, primarily, to existing good 
usage, grammatically speaking; but, besides, the right words should be in 
the right places, and the arrangement be such as will give the thought its 
best form. The gross carelessness manifested occasionally by our best 
writers, and very frequently by writers of less merit, is extremely dis- 
couraging to a lover of good English. No other language offers so great a 
variety of forms for the expression of a thought. Take any simple thought 
and put it into all the forms it will admit; first, without changing any 
words, and then by substituting synonyms, and the whole number, good, 
bad, and indifferent, will be a genuine surprise to the experimenter. With 
such latitude there is no excuse for carelessness. 
If incorrect English added anything to an author’s style by beautifying 
or intensifying his thoughts, it might be pardonable. Some claim this for 
Carlyle’s hybrid English; but if anyone wishes to be disabused of such non- 
sense, let him compare the English previous to “Sartor Resartus” with any 
of his later English. The fact is, the man who hated the artificial in every- 
thing else, was the most artificial of all English writers.
-P-A-G-E-523
METHODS OF STUDY IN ENGLISH. 523 
A sentence may be grammatically correct and yet fail to express an author’s 
thought. Clearness is, next to grammatical accuracy, an absolute essential. 
‘Obscurity should never be pardonable. Carlyle, with his peculiar English, 
is almost always clear. Robert Browning, with equal genius and much 
better English, is rarely so. In the case of Browning, the imputation must 
necessarily be that if he knows his own thoughts he purposely obscures their 
expression. If this is so, he insults every reader who attempts to read one 
of his volumes. 
The most cursory examination of a beautiful thought will convince any- 
one that every particle of beauty is due to the figurative language used in 
its expression. How many teachers are there who realize this? How many 
teachers of English are there who ever attempt to prove that a thought is 
beautiful? How many pupils are there in our high schools who have ever 
received the slightest practical instruction in the most familiar rhetorical 
figures? The text-books contain little on the subject that is intelligible. 
One very pretentious work, published within the last few years, ignores the 
subject altogether. It seems to me that a thorough appreciation of an au- 
thor’s thought is absolutely impossible without some knowledge of this sub- 
ject. If stripped of the verbiage that surrounds it, high-school pupils can 
easily become familiar with all those figures that recur so frequently. 
From many years’ experience I can confidently assert that a high-school 
pupil of fifteen years of age can as readily learn to determine the exact name 
of a rhetorical figure as he can be taught to find the value of « in the simplest 
equation. But in order to do this the subject must be presented without 
complexity and indefiniteness. 
If, as could be done by the primary teacher provided she were familiar 
with the subject, oral instruction were imparted as soon as figurative lan- 
guage appeared in the reading-book, just as oral grammar is imparted, the 
technical study of the subject would be made much easier to the high-school 
pupil. 
Nothing in the study of English is so indefinite as the subject of criticism. 
The popular idea that criticism consists wholly in finding fault, is entirely 
wrong. Such criticism should have a harsher name. The subject can be 
very much simplified. Verbal criticism includes everything that has been 
outlined in the previous part of this essay. Few if any great authors have 
been perfect in the mechanical structure of their works. Grey and De 
Quincey wrote beautiful English, but it was not verbally perfect. 
A great deal of criticism stops with the words only, hence merely on the 
threshold of true criticism. That criticism which is the most valuable con- 
cerns the thought, as the object of any composition is the expression of 
thought. The character of the criticism will depend upon the character of 
the work.- Certain elementary rules can be formulated for the epic, lyric, 
descriptive, and dramatic poem; for fiction and history; for biography, the 
essay, and travels. Conformity to these rules can be readily determined by 
a careful study of a model of each department of writing.

Besides the development of the thoughts of an author, there are often 
suggestions growing out of those thoughts. These are exceedingly valuable. 
Sometimes these suggestions, as in the “ Prologue to the Canterbury Tales,” 
give the greater portion of the manners and customs of the time; sometimes 
there are thoughts worth more than those that have been expressed, as is 
well illustrated in Emerson’s essays; sometimes there is an undercurrent 
illustrating the innermost life of the writer. 
Having done this preparatory work, the pupil will be pretty well quali- 
fied for the study of literature. I believe that the true method is to com- 
mence with Chaucer and work down through the principal English classics 
historically to the present time. The notion that we have an American 
literature, and that we should begin with it before studying English litera- 
ture proper, is not only false, but silly and pernicious. Our best American 
writers belong in the ranks of our English writers. They have their proper 
places. Isolate them, and one may show his patriotism; but, unfortunately, 
at the same time he will exhibit his lamentable ignorance of English liter- 
ture. 
UNIFORM COURSE OF STUDY FOR HIGH SCHOOLS—A 
REPORT. 
E. W. COY, CINCINNATI, OHIO. 
The subject assigned me by the committee for investigation and report is, 
“Uniform Course of Study for High Schools.” With the preparation of 
this report in view, I have communicated with the principals of a large 
number of the leading high schools of the country, and have been favored. 
by them with copies of their courses of study, accompanied in several in- 
stances with valuable suggestions bearing upon this subject. To those who 
have thus kindly assisted me in this work, I wish to tender my grateful 
acknowledgments. ; 
The first question that will naturally be suggested in connection with this 
subject is, whether it is possible to secure uniformity in high-school courses 
of study? If this question is answered in the negative, we need proceed no 
farther. Now there are three aspects in which this question of uniformity 
may be considered. First, we may consider it with reference to the list of 
subjects included in the course of study; or, secondly, with reference to the 
order of succession of those subjects; or, thirdly, with reference to the re- 
sults attained through the medium of the course of study as seen in the 
degree of intelligence and culture of the pupils. Or, stated briefly, we may 
consider uniformity of subjects, uniformity of arrangement, and uniformity 
of results. . 
We shall be helped toward ‘an intelligent conclusion by considering to 
what extent uniformity in these three respects already exists.
-P-A-G-E-525
    
COURSE OF STUDY FOR HIGH SCHOOLS. 525 
1. Uniformity of Subjects—In examining a large number of courses of 
study from all parts of the country, I have found, in the first place, that 
the point of beginning of the high-school work appears to be substantially 
the same. It seems to be generally taken for granted that the pupil who 
enters the high school has mastered what are called the common branches 
sufficiently to enable him to take up the higher studies that are recognized 
as belonging especially to the high school. This uniformity may be more 
apparent than real; and it is not improbable that if we could ascertain and 
compare the state of preparation of classes entering different high schools, 
we should find a much greater diversity than the courses of study would 
indicate. 
Again, there is considerable difference in the list of subjects included in 
these various courses. Some carry English grammar and arithmetic over 
from the lower schools into the first year of the high school. Some contain 
subjects omitted in others, and omit some contained in others. The larger 
schools, with many teachers, naturally present fuller courses than the 
smaller schools with fewer teachers. We can then offer no great degree of 
uniformity here. The following is a list of the subjects contained in these 
courses, classified under five heads: 
(1) Language. Reading, English grammar, composition, rhetoric, English 
literature, French, German, Latin, Greek. 
(2) Mathematics. Arithmetic, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, surveying, 
book-keeping. : : 
(3) Science. Zodlogy, botany, physiology, physical geography, physics, 
chemistry, geology, astronomy. 
(4) History. History of the United States, general history, civil govern- 
ment, political economy. : 
(5) Miscellaneous. Mental philosophy, moral philosophy, music, vocal 
culture, drawing, calisthenics, military drill, art, shorthand, penmanship. 
Here certainly is material enough to select from to construct courses to 
suit all tastes and conditions. 
2. Uniformity of Arrangement.—Here a very great diversity exists. In 
the study of a language there is a natiral order that cannot be widely de- 
parted from, and the same is to some extent true of mathematics; but the 
sciences are arranged in almost as many different ways as there are different 
schools. Such studies as zodlogy, botany, physiology, physics, and even 
rhetoric, algebra, and geometry, are found sometimes in the first year, and 
sometimes in the fourth, and sometimes in the intermediate years. In some 
cases the arrangement seems, at first sight, to be purely arbitrary, but with 
the sciences the diversity is probably due to the fact that one selects zodlogy, 
botany and physiology to present in an elementary way, and reserves physics 
and chemistry for more thorough and more strictly scientific treatment, while 
another reverses this order. But whatever may be the explanation, it is 
clear that the lack of uniformity in the order of studies is much greater than 
the lack of uniformity in the selection of subjects to form the course.  
-P-A-G-E-526
  526 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
Again, high schools differ widely in the number of courses which they 
offer. A large difference in this respect would naturally be expected between 
the large city schools and the schools of the smaller towns and the villages. 
But the difference between the large city high schools themselves is almost 
as great, some offering but one, others five or six distinct courses, while still 
others, through an extensive elective system, offer an almost endless variety 
of combinations. The practice of our high schools in fixing the order of 
studies and the number of courses, is curiously and widely divergent. 
3. Uniformity of Results—Here we have very imperfect means of judg- 
ing. In the State of New York, through its board of regents, and in a few 
other States where some connection has been established between the high 
schools and the State University, an opportunity is given to form a judgment 
of the comparative results reached in the different high schools. Beyond 
that, we have but little means of forming an opinion, But here, as with 
the lower schools, reasoning from the nature of the case, and from the bits 
of evidence that occasionally come to us, we may confidently assert that 
there is great lack of uniformity in high-school work. Still, uniformity in 
other respects amounts to but little, if there is lack of uniformity in the re- 
sults obtained. It is the work done, and not the ground passed over, that 
counts. The most elaborate courses of study are put forth by institutions 
that do the least creditable work. It is much easier and simpler to lay out 
extensive programs on paper, than it is to follow them with pains-taking, 
conscientious, thorough execution in school. The adoption of a uniform 
course of study does not by any means imply a uniform method of work and 
uniform results. 
We have, then, at present anything but uniformity in the courses of study 
and work of our high schools. The question then recurs, Is it possible to 
secure the adoption of a uniform course of study for the high schools of the 
country? If the question be whether we who are assembled here to-day can | 
agree upon a high-school course of study, I grant the possibility, but still 
doubt the probability of such an agreement even among the small number 
assembled here. If the question be whether all the high schools of the 
country can be brought to adopt the same course, or courses, of study, I 
should doubt whether such a consummation is either possible or desirable. 
1. Our ideas as to local self-government are in the way of any such uni- 
formity. That might be attained if we had a national system of education, 
directed by a central authority armed with adequate power; but we think 
we have done wisely in leaving local affairs in the hands of the local au- 
thorities, and so long as this principle prevails, variety in the administration 
of school matters, as well as of all other matters, is inevitable. We have 
no national system of education. We have State systems, and city systems, 
each independent of the others, and each possessing something of complete- 
ness and coherence so far as it goes; but if we wish to see the national 
provision for education we must go to West Point and Annapolis. Ger-
-P-A-G-E-527

many can enforce uniformity in her schools, because she has a national sys- 
tem, under government control and direction. With us the directive power 
is lodged with the different communities, and not with the General Govern- 
ment; it comes from below and not from above, and until all of these com- 
munities can be brought to see alike and think alike, uniformity is out of 
the question. 
2. The widely differing and constantly changing conditions, tastes, wants, 
and views as to the purpose of the high school, render uniformity impracti- 
eable. Even the size of the school and the number of teachers employed 
must be considered in fixing the course of study. The small school with 
three or four teachers cannot be expected to carry out as elaborate a pro- 
gram as the large school with fifteen or eighteen teachers. The courses of 
study for the two must be different, and must receive different treatment. 
The opportunities offered hy higher institutions of learning in the neighbor- 
hood often have much to do in limiting or extending the work of the high 
school. Our people must come to an agreement upon some things that are 
fundamental before they can be expected to come together upon this. We 
are, in fact, too much at sea in all our educational theory and practice to 
be able to stop and cast anchor. Weare still in the tentative, experimental 
period. We are not yet ready to settle down and crystallize. We are too 
young and unripe for that. Think for a moment of the radical changes 
that have been made within the last twenty years, and that are still being 
made, in the courses of study of some of our higher institutions— changes 
that amount to an entire revolution, the ultimate results of which no one 
would venture to predict. We do know that the effect of these changes is 
seriously felt to-day throughout all of the lower schools. Think again of 
the different views entertained as to the purpose of the high school itself. 
Some would make culture the main purpose of the school; some would make 
it chiefly a business school; some would substitute for it a technical school; 
and I am not sure but some would turn it into a workshop. 
3. A part of the work of the high school is to prepare students for col- 
lege. If, then, we are to have a uniform course of study for the high schools, 
there must first be some uniformity in these higher institutions—at least 
uniform requirements for admission to them. The high school stands be- 
tween the elementary schools below, and the colleges, technological schools 
and universities above. Its relation to the elementary schools is sufficiently 
clear and well established; they belong to the same system, and connect 
immediately with the high school. But the schools above are of all sorts 
and conditions; they have no organic connection with one another, nor with 
the schools below them; they are not parts of any system; they are separate 
and independent entities. The colleges range all the way from second-class 
high schools to first-class universities. With many of them the one great 
want is students, and they are glad to take whatever they can get, without 
much question as'to the preparation. Hence, in deciding upon a high-school  
-P-A-G-E-528
  528 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
course preparatory for college, we must first know what college; and them 
the chances are that the high-school boy will find himself welcomed to the 
ever-open doors of some university with high-sounding name by the time 
he has passed half-way through his preparatory course. If we had a com- 
plete system of schools, rising step by step from the primary school to the 
university, it would be a comparatively simple thing to frame a high-school 
preparatory course. y 
4. This question of uniformity has been discussed in several of the States, 
and the conclusion very generally arrived at, that it is not practicable even 
within State limits. Says Mr. Frank A. Hall, principal of the high school 
at Cambridge, Mass., in a carefully-prepared paper published in the Mas- 
sachusetts report for 1884-5: “The diverse conditions of the 224 high schools 
of the State render it impossible to construct a single course of studies that 
will be adapted to them all. Indeed, the essence of a good education is so 
subtle and indefinable a thing; it involves so much of power and balance 
and culture; it may spare so much of mere information, that no one has a 
right to say that there is but one curriculum that is always and everywhere 
the best.” A committee of the Indiana State Teachers’ Association, ap- 
' pointed “to readjust a uniform course of study for the high schools of 
Indiana,” made a report a few years ago, in which they say: “To your 
committee it seems impracticable to propose a uniform high-school course 
that would adapt itself readily to the widely different local circumstances. 
in the different cities and towns of the State. . . . Indeed, it seems 
scarcely desirable to propose such a course at the present stage of the edu- 
cational development of the State.” 
Now, if Massachusetts, a State in which the condition of the population 
is supposed to be about as fixed and settled as that of any State in the 
Union, and Indiana, which has shown a rare wisdom in dealing with edu- 
cational problems, decide that it is impracticable to adopt a uniform course 
of study for the high schools of their respective States, it would certainly 
be presumptuous on our part to propose a course of study for all of the high 
schools in the thirty-eight —soon to be forty-two—States of the Union. 
But granting that uniformity is impracticable and undesirable, it.does 
not follow that there is nothing relating to the high-school course which can 
be profitably discussed. On the contrary, it is one of the topics that espe- 
cially invite discussion. Custom has limited the high-school course to four 
years. It is not easy to include in so brief a space all of the subjects that 
it might seem desirable for boys and girls to know something about when 
they end their schooling. We must be content to make the best selection 
we can, remembering that it is better to do a few things thoroughly and 
well, than to gain a smattering of many things. It is well, also, to bear in 
mind that power is gained by continuous work along the same line, and 
hence the studies in the different departments, as, for instance, in language, 
science, or mathematics, should be so arranged as to form, as far as possible,
-P-A-G-E-529
COURSE OF STUDY FOR HIGH SCHOOLS. 529 
a progressive and connected course. The different branches pursued in 
each of these departments should be looked upon as related parts of one 
harmonious whole, and not as disconnected and isolated fragments. If 
better results have been reached in the mathematics and the languages than 
in the sciences in our schools, is it not because in the former we have been 
more successful in making the work of each term and each year a prepara- 
tion for, and a reinforcement of, the work of the succeeding terms and the 
succeeding years? So that the student, pursuing the one line of subjects, 
may be compared to the traveler who is ascending a high mountain. He 
climbs steadily upward, constantly rising into higher altitudes, gathering 
inspiration with the consciousness of mastery, and gaining broader and fairer 
views of the surrounding country. While the student pursuing the other 
line of subjects is too often like a traveler who is amusing himself by run- 
ning up and down a succession of little hills. Before he has reached the. 
summit of one, he returns to the plain and starts up another. He fails to 
hold the ground he has gained, he reaches no height, and has little con- 
sciousness of acquired power. He reminds us of those people spoken of by 
the apostle, “ Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the 
truth.” There is, I am sure, room for great improvement in our treatment 
of the sciences in our high schools. 
Without proceeding further, I will give a course of study that may serve 
at least as a basis for discussion. Possibly it may be followed with advan- 
tage in its main features, and be varied from to suit special circumstances 
and conditions: GENERAL COURSE.

This course presupposes a school large enough to require the services of 
seven or eight regular teachers. With smaller schools, some modifications 
will ordinarily be advisable. The option between zodlogy and botany in 
the first year might be omitted, and but one of those subjects given. I 
should prefer zodlogy, because it is in the same line with physiology. The 
French or German of the third and fourth years is given to meet the wants 
of the larger city high schools. With these, French or German might take 
the place of either advanced algebra and trigonometry or of physics and 
chemistry in the third year, and of two out of the three studies, chemistry, 
geology and astronomy, in the fourth year. Again, some of the smaller 
high schools may find it advisable to omit physics after the second year and 
chemistry altogether, on account of the want of facilities for teaching those 
subjects; or if these are retained, they may find it best to omit advanced 
algebra, or trigonometry, or both. If either of these omissions is made, the 
English and general history could be extended so as to fill up the vacancy 
thus created. The “reviews” of the last half of the fourth year in the 
General Course are designed to give an opportunity for reviewing English 
grammar. and arithmetic. Those taking book-keeping might be excused 
from the arithmetic review. The Classical Course as will be seen is the same 
as the General Course for the first year, and is parallel to it through the 
other years in subjects that are common to both. What I have called 
“reviews” in the last year of the course, might be utilized differently in dif- 
ferent schools, or in the same school with different classes, or in the same 
class with different pupils. If a boy or girl is preparing for a college in 
which a modern language is required, a year’s work in French may be taken ; 
if one needs a review of algebra and geometry, he may enter advanced 
algebra with the class of the first half of the third year, and the geometry 
of the second half of the second year; or he may take the botany or the 
physics of the second year, and part of the reviews of the General Course. 
In short, an opportunity is offered here to adjust the course to the various
-P-A-G-E-531
COURSE OF STUDY FOR HIGH SCHOOLS. 531 
  
requirements of different colleges. It is expected that special attention will 
be given to composition for the first two years, in connection with the course 
in English, and that it will be followed up through the last two years with 
written work in the various subjects studied. 
Every school should have some time every day set apart for general ex- 
ercises. This time may be profitably employed in exercises in music, in 
elocutionary training, in giving counsel and instruction in morals and man- 
ners, and in many miscellaneous matters that find ho place on the regular 
program. 
One word more, and I am done. The work of the first year of the high 
school should be made simple and elementary, in order to adapt it to the 
capacity and stage of mental development of the boys and girls of the en- 
tering class. If I may judge from my own experience and from what I 
learn from others, there is great danger of over-estimating the ability of 
those entering the high school to think and work independently. The aver- 
age boy or girl comes to us with a wonderful facility in memorizing and re- 
peating words and phrases; he takes very readily mental food that has 
already been prepared and masticated for him by the teacher, but his rea- 
soning power is very feebly developed, and his habits of study often need 
reformation, and, sometimes, creation. Hence, the work of the first year 
should be easy and simple. Above all, the scientific work should be ele- 
mentary, attractive, and objective. It is, perhaps, at this late day, super- 
fluous to add that if the work in science in the high school is to be merely 
the committing to memory and reciting the contents of a text-book, it would 
be better to omit it altogether, and replace it with something that may be 
made more fruitful. 
DISCUSSION. 
HENRY C. KING, OBERLIN, OHIO. 
In his address at the Harvard anniversary, Lowell said no wiser thing, I 
think, than this: “It is to be hoped that our higher institutions of learning 
may again be brought to bear, as once they did, more directly on the lower ; 
that they may again come into such closer and graduated relation with 
them as may make the higher education the goal to which all who show a 
clear aptitude shall aspire.” 
Every college teacher who at all appreciates what is involved in that 
“closer and graduated relation,” must earnestly second this sentiment. To 
that closer relation, nothing is more essential than a uniform, or rather, wni- 
fied, course of study for the high schools. Asa college teacher, I am greatly 
interested in this problem, and have been audacious enough even to attempt 
to lay out such a uniform course myself. I believe that every educational

interest would be the gainer by any reasonable solution of this problem; 
though I think with Prof. Coy, that a reasonable solution probably will not 
seek an absolutely uniform course. 
The many apparently fruitless attempts already made are doubtless dis- 
couraging, yet the present lawlessness of courses is so wasteful, the gains to 
be made are so great, that we can never wisely give over the problem. The 
working out of some plan so concerns both the schools and the colleges, 
that they are certain to come to a better mutual understanding and agree- 
ment. Ten weeks’ experience in constant visitation of high schools brought 
the belief that more careful thought, and a better acquaintance with the 
work of the schools, will convince college-men that there are points of some 
importance, in which the high schools generally are right, as against the re- 
quirements of many colleges. Doubtless both the schools and the colleges 
have something to concede and something to maintain, if a unified high- 
school course is ever to be possible; and the experience of both must come 
into the successful solution of the problem. The progress already made by 
the Commission of New England Colleges, as well as other similar move- 
ments, gives promise that the colleges may yet be expected to render sub- 
stantial aid in the effort for uniformity. : 
There are other important conditions which such a unified course must 
meet, if it is to be practicable. It must meet the needs of both the larger 
and the smaller schools. The course outlined should be such that, in general, 
the smaller schools would find their best course in the earlier years of the 
course of the larger schools. This is possible, and, from the standpoint of 
thereollege, very desirable. 
T urse, moreover, should be such as not to hinder a student looking 
to collesés but should lead naturally to college. No plan should compel a 
decision as to college at the beginning of the high-school course, as is now 
so often the case. 
At the same time, the course must not be prejudicial to the interests of 
that large class who will never reach college. Though the fact that these, 
in most schools, are in the majority, does not justify, as seems so often to be 
inferred, the ignoring of the small but important number who are to con- 
tinue their education in college. 
The question of the possible adjustment of the interests of these two classes 
of high-school pupils is the prime question which underlies any plan for a 
uniform course of study, and raises at once the further inquiry as to the 
principle which should determine a secondary course.. The mere possibility 
of a uniform or even unified course of study assumes one very important 
educational principle. This principle, as stated by Dr. Harris, and which 
I do not now stop at all to defend, is: “The best course of study for any one 
pupil is the best for all, so far as fundamental disciplines are concerned.” 
This is not to say that exactly the same studies must be pursued by all; but 
that in the education of each one, the five great branches of study —mathe-
-P-A-G-E-533
COURSE OF STUDY FOR HIGH SCHOOLS. 533 
  
matics, science, language and philosophy, history, literature and art —should 
be fairly represented; and to this it is believed that most educators who are 
not manifestly riding a hobby would agree. The principle looks, it will be 
- seen, to a unified course, opposing the splitting of the high-school course, as 
is so commonly done, into a general and a classical course. 
The two courses, as outlined by Prof. Coy, however, are wisely so nearly 
parallel as not greatly to violate Dr. Harris’s principle. Yet I believe so 
thoroughly in that principle, and in the desirability of deferring the decision 
as to college, that I should make the two courses still more completely one. 
I should make the first two years identical, confining the Greek to the last 
two years of the classical course, and in the other allowing the election of 
other studies for the Greek. That is, I would have, in fact and in name, 
but one course, with possible election for the Greek—a third of the work 
in the last two years. If the studies that may be elected instead of the 
Greek are carefully chosen, so that they can be accepted for certain college 
work —trigonometry, chemistry, and botany, for example—the student 
graduating from any form of this unified course would not be hindered in 
seeking his college education. 
If, in addition, the true order and relation of studies is carefully con- 
sidered, a course founded upon this principle of Dr. Harris’s should meet 
every requirement. Assuring a sound and broad training, it would still 
contain an element of freedom that would greatly assist to the easy adoption 
of the course. The interests of the student whose education must cease with 
the high school would be secured; the student looking to college would be 
fully ready without loss of time; decision as to college would not be com- 
pelled at the beginning of the high-school course; a much closer relation 
between the schools would result; and the number of those going to college 
could scarcely fail to increase. But aside from all minutiz of any plan, if 
there could be reasonable agreement upon the principle of Dr. Harris, de-, 
tails in the course might be safely left to individual communities. Of such 
substantial agreement I am hopeful, and this agreement would give all the 
essential advantages of a uniform course without its disadvantages.

PAPERS, 
AN EDUCATIONAL EXPERIMENT. 
SELIM H. PEABODY, CHAMPAIGN, ILLINOIS. 
The publication of a series of articles upon college government in the 
North American Review, over the signatures of several college presidents of 
wide reputation and large experience, has put this subject before the Amer- 
ican people in a way to command attention and insure respect. In the 
main these papers are singularly in harmony, and they seem to me to pre- 
sent very clearly the fundamental ideas upon which only college govern- 
ment in America can be prudently administered. There should be no doubt 
that college government ought to be efficient and responsible, conducted by 
the faculty of the institution, and so tempered with justice and good sense, so 
fair, equable, and certain, as to commend itself to the obedient judgment of all 
sensible, intelligent, and right-minded students. If, unfortunately, any other 
students should entertain different opinions as to the discipline of a college, 
so much the better for the discipline. 
But the opinions expressed in these papers of the North American have 
not obtained credence always and everywhere. There are those who have 
insisted that the usual college government is paternal in too great a de- 
gree; that it fails in some way to recognize the true position of the student, 
and that it were far better to delegate to the students themselves some share 
of the responsibility of maintaining good order; while some have gone so 
far as to advise that the whole subject should be turned over, deliberately 
and formally, to the students. In one instance the experiment of so con- 
ducting a college government has had a thorough trial, extending through 
aseries of years. The methods, conclusion, and results of this experiment 
I desire to set before you, as briefly as I may, as a contribution to this im- 
portant discussion. 
The Students’ Government, formally so called, of the University of Illi- 
nois, then known as the Illinois Industrial University, was organized in the 
early part of the year 1870. The students were authorized by vote of the 
faculty to construct the mechanism of a government and set it in operation. 
This government was empowered to take cognizance of, investigate, and 
punish all offenses against good order and decorum committed by students 
in or about the college buildings, or in the adjacent cities of Champaign or 
Urbana, except such as might occur in class-rooms in the presence of college 
officers.
-P-A-G-E-540
  
  540 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
The government was a full-fledged political organization after the repub- 
lican pattern. The whole body of students, freshmen of less than one term’s 
residence excepted, constituted a general assembly, usually numbering about 
four hundred voters, and requiring fifty voters for a quorum. Men and 
women had equal privileges as voters or officers. 
On the first Friday after the opening of any term of college the general 
assembly was called to act in the capacity of a primary meeting, at which 
officers should be nominated. The president holding over from the last 
term had the privilege of nominating certain officers, but any student had 
also the same power. After free nominations and requisite ballotings two 
tickets were usually made up, which tickets, not excluding others which 
might be put in the field privately, were to be balloted in a general election 
held on the Friday following. All the machinery customary in municipal 
elections, ballot-boxes, judges, clerks, ete., were provided. Not a few of the 
young men had been initiated into the arts of politicians practiced in civic 
elections at their homes, and these arts were constantly employed in the col- 
lege elections; on the days, both of nomination and of election, the college 
halls hummed with busy workers, filled with zeal and partisanship. 
On the Monday following the day of election, the successful candidates 
were inducted into office upon the platform in the chapel at morning prayers, 
by taking an oath of office duly administered by the chief justice of the 
outgoing government. After a time some question arose as to the adminis- 
tration of oaths not authorized by the laws of the State, and the oath was 
changed for an affirmation or a public promise made by each officer to per- 
form the duties of his office to the best of his ability. 
The officers elected were president, vice-president, secretary, treasurer, 
prosecuting attorney, and marshal, each to serve for one college term; seven 
senators to serve for three terms, and senators to fill any vacancies which 
might have occurred. The full senate consisted of twenty-one senators, 
presided over by the vice-president, who had only a casting vote. Its busi- 
ness was to consider and enact laws, defining such acts of students as should 
be deemed misdemeanors, and fixing the penalties therefor. Misdemeanors 
were graded as of the first, second, or third class, and penalties were graded 
accordingly. A second offense against a given statute was placed in a 
higher grade of misdemeanors, and in some cases a third was to be reported 
to the faculty, which was expected to issue thereupon sentence of immediate 
expulsion from college. The steps of legislation were those usually adopted 
by legislative bodies, requiring three successive readings, etc. When a bill 
was passed by the senate, it was presented to the regent —president—of 
the university for approval and signature. If he declined to approve, the 
bill failed to become a law; it could not be passed over his veto. This veto 
of the regent was the only statutory check provided as a restraint oyer the 
acts of this government. The laws were promulgated by proclamation, 
posting, or printing. The offenses forbidden included all disturbances of
-P-A-G-E-541

quiet in the dormitories, including the unseasonable use of musical instru- 
ments; untidiness, as the leaving of ashes or sweepings in the halls; all use 
or possession of intoxicants, and the visiting, at any time or for any pur- 
pose, of a drinking-saloon or billiard hall by a student, except a student 
policeman on duty. As to this offense, no excuse could be recognized; if 
the bodily presence of a student in a saloon was proved by adequate testi- 
mony, he was fined. 
The judiciary consisted of a chief justice and two assistants, to be nomi- 
nated by the president and confirmed by the senate. Their duties were to 
issue warrants upon information of the prosecuting attorney, and to sit in 
trial of such cases, hear evidence, determine issues, and impose fines. The 
marshal was the executive officer of the court, and the chief of police. The 
president might appoint as many deputy marshals as he should think need- 
ful; with their aid the marshal was to exercise a general surveillance over 
the students, within college and without, and whenever he should discover 
or be informed that the ordinances of the government had been violated, his 
duty was to lay the facts before the prosecuting attorney, who must then 
proceed in action before the justices. A warrant was issued, and was served 
upon the accused, with notice of the time and place of trial, for which a room 
was set apart in the college building. The accused might respond in person 
or by counsel. If after due notice, certified by the marshal, the accused 
should fail to appear, the case was still heard, ex parte, and if the evidence 
was conclusive the charge was held to be sustained, and judgment was 
entered by default. Punishment was administered by the imposition of 
fines, varying according to statute from twenty-five cents upward. The 
largest fine ever imposed by the college court was ten dollars, for mistreat- 
ment and intimidation of a marshal. 
If the judges found a case so serious as to be troublesome, they had power 
to refer it, with the record, to the university faculty. If a case were once 
decided, the same court could order a rehearing for cause, but it could not 
be reopened by a subsequent court, nor was there any provision for appeal 
by the student, nor for pardon at the hands of any person. It was expected 
that the faculty would say to the person convicted by the college court: 
“Pay your fine, or go home.” 
Two departments of a republican government were thus pretty fully or- 
ganized, the representative and the judiciary. The executive was less form- 
ally equipped. The president had little power beyond presiding over the 
sessions of the general assembly, and nominating judges. Most of the 
elected officers were to be members of the junior or senior classes. 
Without doubt this government was efficient in its earlier days to a de- 
gree much greater than could have been expected. The new broom swept 
very clean. The students entered upon the experiment with commendable 
zeal, They wished it to succeed. They put forward their best men for 
presidents, and these presidents appointed the wisest and most considerate
-P-A-G-E-542

men as judges. On the other hand, much opposition arose. Students ob- 
jected to the espionage of the police, and it did not help the matter that the 
police were of their own number. They objected to being placed under the 
judgment and discipline of classmates and comrades, and accusations of un- 
fairness, prejudice, and injustice were common. Many of the more thoughtful 
students, and many of their parents, urged that the faculty was not justified 
in thus abdicating authority which had been imposed upon it by law and 
immemorial custom, which it had no power to delegate to others, and which 
laid serious and exacting burdens on persons who had no good claims to be 
released from such duties. 
It was soon evident that the working of the government, was very unequal. 
The officers remained in place rarely more than one term; the outs wanted 
to be in, and the ins, tired of service which brought plenty of vexation and 
no profit, were very willing to go out. At the beginning of a college year 
the stable men of the new senior class would take up the government with 
fresh energy, and would administer it with the firm determination that col- 
lege evils should be corrected, that order should be maintained, and that bad 
boys should learn that there was indeed a “God in Israel.” They watched, 
and accused, and arrested, and fined, rigorously, and in most cases rightly 
enough, it must be confessed. But inevitably a reaction followed, and by 
the next election the other party had often secured votes enough to oust 
those who had disciplined them, and to put in men whose sole and avowed 
purpose as to the government was to see how not to doit. By the third term 
it would appear that the year was nearly out, and each party fell into quiet- 
ness. Next year the process would be repeated with variations. 
It had been supposed by those who had devised this plan of government, 
that the regent and faculty could preserve a directive and balancing power 
over it. This was an error. The students who undertook the management 
of the government were exceedingly sensitive about anything that savored 
of interference or dictation. They asserted that if they were not fit to be 
trusted with this work it should not have been committed to them, and that 
if they did it at all, they must be allowed to do it in, their own fashion. 
They were not willing to act as mere machines to be operated by other par- 
ties. 
In one instance a student was fined for two distinct offenses; the fines 
amounting to between two and three dollars. The convicted student went 
to the regent; he admitted one offense, but strenuously, and on his honor, 
denied the other; whereupon the regent remitted one of the fines. At this 
act the judges were instantly indignant, and, it must be admitted, with rea- 
son. They insisted that the laws which had been enacted with the consent 
and approval of that same regent provided for no such course of procedure; 
and if, by reason of the eminent domain which the judges were yet willing 
to concede to the ruling powers in emergency, it was thought that the case 
should: be reviewed by the regent or the faculty, the judges urged that the
-P-A-G-E-543
  AN EDUCATIONAL EXPERIMENT. 548 
  
court, which might have been presumed to have considered the case consci- 
entiously, should have had opportunity to be heard before its judgments 
were summarily reversed. The opinion of the judges prevailed, but the 
case brought into clear light the defect of the system which had made no 
provision for review or for pardon. 
The system was seriously attacked, especially by the legal fraternity, on 
the ground of illegality, especially as the University is a State institution. 
The attacks became so numerous and so bitter that the trustees directed 
that the subject should be referred to the Attorney-General of the State for 
his opinion on this point. After examination the law officer reported that 
the chain of authority as to discipline was complete, leading from Legisla- 
ture to trustees, from trustees to faculty, and from faculty, with consent of 
trustees, to the organization and officers of the students’ government. But, 
continued the attorney, neither trustees, faculty nor students had received 
from the Legislature power to impose and collect fines of any amount or 
for any cause whatever. 
At the first reading of this opinion it seemed evident that the grip of the 
government was gone; that a law not enforced by some penalty was but a 
farce; and: that the experiment was brought to a sudden but final termina- 
tion —as, indeed, it may be presumed the Attorney-General intended when 
he wrote out his opinion. But a way was found to keep the experiment 
alive yet a while longer. It was agreed that the students’ government 
should be considered a voluntary association. Any student might consider 
himself amenable to it or not, as he should elect. If he were a good and 
law-abiding student, violating no enactment of the code, the government 
would in no way molest him; the law was a terror to evil-doers only. If 
the court, having information against him, should cite him before its bar, 
he might respond or not, as he should choose. If he did respond, he ac- 
knowledged himself to be under the authority of the government, aid he 
ought to accept the judgment of the court and to obey its mandates. If he 
did not respond, and the court should proceed against him in default of his 
presence, then he need not abide any judgment or pay any fine. What 
then? Why then—and this was the alternative which for a while held 
everything to its bearings —the court should refer everything to the faculty, 
which would take up the case, try it de novo, and if the student were con- 
victed of any offense, administer such punishment as lay in the power of 
the faculty to inflict, without any reference to the laws of the students’ gov- 
ernment. Provision was also made by which any student under accusation 
could take a change of venue or an appeal from judgment to the faculty. 
The first case which came up by appeal, under the new ruling, was a 
saloon case. Three boys were brought before the court on the charge of 
being in a saloon, contrary to student law. They were convicted and fined, 
and they appealed to the faculty. When the case was heard by the faculty, 
the students admitted the facts, but put in as their defense, which they had 
 
-P-A-G-E-544
  544 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  
also used before the students’ court, that the place where they were was not 
a saloon, because, although it had been a saloon, the saloon license had ex- 
pired the day before, and therefore the place was not a saloon doing business 
by authority of municipal law. The plea was no more successful with the 
faculty than it had been in the students’ court; the facts stated were deemed 
but an aggravation of the offense, and the students were suspended. This 
case settled the question of appeals: the boys preferred the discipline of the 
court. Thus the students’ government had a renewed lease of life. 
The next attack was organized by a considerable body of the students 
themselves. They had made a request of the faculty which had been denied; 
the request had been carried forward to the trustees, and was again denied. 
Whereupon an impromptu meeting of the general assembly was called, and 
in asudden flurry of passion resolutions were adopted dissolving the students’ 
government, and as the resolutions read, “returning to the hands of the 
faculty the government which they, the students, were no longer worthy to 
administer.” A brief discussion of the situation the next morning showed 
to the actors the foolishness of this transaction, and the business of the goy- 
ernment went forward as before. At the same time the students were told 
that they were not expected to continue the government any longer than 
they wished so to do; only that if this form of government was to be abro- 
gated it must be done in an orderly and deliberate way, after allowing full 
time for consideration, and not in any flurry of rash and hasty retaliation. 
In the spring of 1883, the senate passed a bill for an act dissolving the 
students’ government and administering upon its estate, and presented the 
bill in the usual way to the regent for his signature. The bill was dis- 
approved on the ground that no senatorial body acting under the provision 
of constitutional authority had power to uproot and abrogate the very au- 
thority under which it had life and ‘existence. It was as if the Senate of 
the State of Illinois should pretend to annul the State constitution, ete. 
But it was farther shown that if the senate desired it might provide for an 
election, at which, in a proper way, and at a proper time, each student 
might by ballot express his wish for or against the continuance of this form 
of government. The senate adopted the suggestion, and made the needful 
arrangements by which such a vote was taken. Of the three hundred and 
fifty students then present in the university, only seventy-seven voted for 
the continuance of the government; the others were about equally divided 
between those who declined to vote and those who voted against the govern- 
ment. This vote having been certified to the faculty, that body resolved 
that because of this expression of opinion on the part of the, students, the 
authority which had been delivered to them was withdrawn, and the govern- 
ment was dissolved. This action was reported to the trustees, and was by 
them confirmed; so that by the concurrent action of the three bodies— 
students, faculty, and trustees—this experiment in college discipline was 
finally terminated. This was done at the end of the collegiate year 1882-3, 
after the government had been in operation nearly fourteen years.
-P-A-G-E-545
AN EDUCATIONAL EXPERIMENT. 545 
The experiment had been completely and thoroughly worked out. The 
circumstances for beginning and continuing it were as favorable as could 
be devised. Continuing during parts of two administrations, it was as care- 
fully supported by the second regent as it had been by the first. It had a 
full and fair trial, which was not permitted to close prematurely, or until all 
parties concerned were convinced that farther continuance was not desirable. 
Since then there has been no time when this government could have been re- 
vived, nor has even the wish been expressed that it should be restored. 
The scheme was one for which many attractive and plausible reasons were 
presented. It was said to accord with and to cultivate the idea of the Amer- 
ican system of government. If the word had been in use at that time, this 
would have been counted a useful, practical lesson in civics. It made young 
men familiar with the processes of enacting and enforcing laws. It culti- 
vated self-reliance. It inculcated ideas of responsibility, and the duty of 
fulfilling responsibilities in regard to public affairs. It was urged that it 
appealed to the honor and dignity of manhood in young men, in asking 
them to govern themselves rather than to require government at the hands 
of others. It was farther insisted that many evils, notably those pertaining 
to the saloon and the gaming-room, could be reached much more easily and 
thoroughly by the students than by the faculty. If the design had proved 
itself feasible after an all-round trial, doubtless many of these good reasons 
might have stood in its favor. 
Some objections have doubtless occurred to all minds as this narration has 
proceeded. This form of discipline was unstable, inasmuch as the personnel 
of the government was changed three times each year. Its administration 
was conducted often upon diametrically opposite ideas, since the government 
not merely changed hands so often, but almost as often its purposes were 
changed, as it shifted from the control of those who wished it to work out 
correct discipline, to the control of those who deliberately secured possession 
of it in order to keep it from annoying them. It lacked the balances which 
all human administrations require, in its want of even the opportunities of 
appeal and pardon. In all colleges there are many young men who will not 
undertake the responsibilities of self-government, who yet in their thought- 
ful and sober moments recognize that they need such control. They feel 
that it must come from without themselves, and while they may be willing 
to accept control from a higher authority, like that of a faculty, they will 
not submit kindly to control from their own mates, or those whom they deem 
their inferiors, at least in rank, as each man is apt to view those of classes 
lower than his own. 
But the most mischievous influence, as it was the most subtle and the most 
prevalent, was the idea which gradually grew into even an arrogant and im- 
perious force, that the dominant authority, ruling and controlling the insti- 
tution in all its aspects, existed rightfully and necessarily in the public 
opinion of the students. Few really claimed it, many would not admit it,

but the result came to be such as might be illustrated if one should suppose 
a magnificent ocean steamer, plying in regular passages from one harbor to 
the opposite, not guided by its officers, but navigated according to the will 
of a committee representing the public opinion of the passengers.

THE HIGHER EDUCATION OF THE COLORED RACE— 
WHAT HAS BEEN DONE; WHAT CAN BE DONE. 
(I.] 
A. OWEN, NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE. 
Twenty-four years ago four million slaves. became free, and without any 
long probation were invested with the rights and duties of citizens. They 
were poor, ignorant, and helpless, with the inherited traditions and tenden- 
cies of their African home, and without training or experience fitting them 
for the exactions of modern life. Considering their starting-point, they 
have done well, both in achievement and disposition. They have accom- 
plished much, and they have endured much, with a patience born of hope, 
and not of despair. * 
But in all this it must be confessed that never to any people before have 
so many helping hands been stretched out. Never before in the history of 
the world has a whole race been impelled by so many and so powerful mo- 
tives to seek educational progress. They knew instinctively that if their 
condition was to be really better than in the former time, it must become so 
by improving the opportunity opened by Providence and adapting them- 
selves to the conditions of the life opened to them. 
On the other hand, Christian philanthropy and patriotism, with a clear’ 
percéption of the demands of the case, met the emancipated people with 
varied helps. Those who had desired their freedom acknowledged their re-

sponsibility, and schools for the education of teachers and preachers began 
to be opened before the echoes of the war had yet died away. Every year 
since has witnessed the establishment of one or more schools through the 
beneficence of philanthropists of the North; and the colored people have 
organized many themselves, of which some are doing well. 
Dr. Haygood estimates that over 80 schools for normal and higher. in- 
struction are now in successful operation, in a score of which a fairly ade- 
quate collegiate education is given; and in most of them there is more or 
less theological instruction. Besides, there are two medical colleges, and at 
least two distinctly theological seminaries. 
The work of these schools has been of special value in connection with 
common-school education, both in providing teachers and making them 
better teachers. It should be acknowledged, also, that in this matter the 
Southern States have acted generously and nobly in the establishment and 
support of colored schools. The public funds have been divided and schools 
supported on a scale that bids fair in a few generations to make illiteracy a 
thing of the past; in fact, in some of the States the statistics gathered in 
the school reports show an actual gain in percentage among the colored 
people over the whites. If their schools are short and inadequate, they are 
certainly equal in length and furnishing to the common school of New Eng- 
land seventy years ago. 
In regard to the normal schools and colleges, it should be further said 
that few, if any of them, do the actual work of well-equipped and genuine 
colleges. In the nature of the case this must be so. A true college educa- 
tion is the outgrowth of favoring conditions. The boy is born into a literary 
atmosphere; he is surrounded by books, and absorbs a certain intellectual 
equipment from his surroundings; a multitude of elementary things he 
knows without ever having consciously learned them; they come to him in 
those early years when the mind is receptive, and so easily absorbs and 
assimilates ideas, with little notion of their relation or importance; hence, 
he comes to his college preparatory work with a good vocabulary, a good 
foundation in the elements of knowledge, considerable acquaintance with 
history, politics, and public affairs. His work in college is chiefly to sys- 
tematize knowledge, to learn exactness, and to gain a ready control of his 
faculties. He gains also a wider acquaintance with the world’s literature 
and the grand unity of all knowledge when properly correlated. 
Now it goes without saying, that the youth of the colored race have not 
heretofore been in a condition to receive or profit by the-ideal college edu- 
cation, nor are many of them now. It is in no way their fault. It is due 
to the circumstances in which they were providentially placed —not to lack 
of mind or will. If you remember that twenty-five years ago the colored 
man who could read was the exception; that books, newspapers, knowledge 
of current events were entirely removed from them, and that to the few and 
not to the many do these helpful conditions pertain even now, you will see
-P-A-G-E-548

that colleges among the colored people must be so only in part, even if they 
be as pretentious in their claim as the oldest universities. Even in the old 
States, a real college can hardly be made in less than fifty years. Money 
and buildings do not make a college. It is never a real thing till time and 
association and the ever-developing literary atmosphere make it so. 
All this will come to pass in time, in these colleges and universities. As 
the number of educated families increases, as the need for educated men 
grows, as they press their way into the various callings, as the average intelli- 
gence of which the higher culture is the fruitage becomes general, these col- 
leges will take their proper place and do appropriate work. But every wise 
educator will adapt instructions to his constituency ; will seek to meet present 
needs, and to secure the broadest and best results under present conditions. 
Hence my judgment is, that greatest stress and greatest energy, for this 
generation at least, should be expended on primary and normal education. 
Full encouragement should be given to the exceptional few to do all they 
can, and opportunity should be given; but the present must be recognized 
as the preliminary, the formative period. There must be a full supply 
of teachers prepared to teach the rudiments of knowledge in such a way 
as to produce accuracy and to beget a thirst for knowledge. Until this is 
done, all schools will be hampered and hindered by the imperfections of the 
foundation, by the constant need of going back to first principles. My judg- 
ment is that there has been too much building from the top, and that ambi- 
tious faculties have attempted too much. They must learn to wait. 
In all this there is no purpose to disparage the intellectual power of the 
colored people. In many cases it is marked and peculiar. They have done 
as much as any people have ever done under like conditions; but it is no 
kindness to them to ignore the facts. My heartfelt interest in their highest 
well-being is evident in what I am trying to do. The best thing I am fully 
persuaded is not to go too fast nor too far, and while providing as well as 
circumstances will allow for the exceptional cases, where early opportunities 
or marked ability warrants it, to make the chief effort and to lay greatest 
stress for a generation or two to come, on the fundamental elements of a 
sound and thorough education.

W. 8. SCARBOROUGH, WILBERFORCE, OHIO. 
The St. Louis Globe-Democrat, in commenting upon an article* of mine 
relative to the future of the American negro, says, among other things, that 
“the all-important point in the negro problem is, What ratio of progress 
can the negro make in civilization and education? Can he keep up under 
favorable circumstances with the whites? Can he ever by special aid clear 
the ground by which he was left by slavery in the rear of the whites?”   
* Forum for March, 1889.

  HIGHER EDUCATION OF THE COLORED RACE. 549 
  
I admit that these are “all-important points,” and that it is upon these 
that the solution of the so-called negro problem largely rests. But does not 
the past history of this race, since its emancipation, furnish us with exam- 
ples that prove conclusively that with a clear field and a little aid there is 
no occasion for doubt as to the future? Have we not observed all along 
the line, from the Lakes to the Gulf, from the Atlantic to the Pacific, the 
colored youth as studious and as successful as students as any other class of 
people? The negro has labored under tremendous difficulties. Confronted 
by his own poverty, ignorance, and superstition, the first stages of his new 
life presented little that was encouraging; but with the generous aid of 
friends he has thus far stemmed the tide. The question now is not one of 
ability or capability, for that has been settled. What can be done must be 
determined largely by what has been done, objectively and subjectively. 
‘When Flipper, the negro cadet, entered West Point, the question that arose 
in the minds of many was, whether he had sufficient mental capacity to mas- 
ter successfully the rigid course of instruction in that institution, main- 
taining a favorable competition with his white classmates, and creditably 
represent the race with which he was identified, as well as the academy of 
which he was a member. His graduation and subsequent appointment 
answered this inquiry, and very satisfactorily. Cadet Alexander succeeded 
Flipper. His previous career in Oberlin College as a student of unusual 
mental power secured for him a high grade of scholarship, and made failure 
impossible. In many respects he was Flipper’s superior. 
I might multiply examples, but it is sufficient to say that the graduates 
of our best American colleges give still further evidence as to what the col- 
ored boy can do under favorable circumstances. The negro, however, is 
still behind, and is destined to remain there indefinitely. I would be en- 
titled to little respect were I to assert otherwise. The colored people as a 
race must content themselves with actively bringing up the rear of Ameri- 
can scholarship, at least for many years to come. There is much in hered- 
ity. It counts, and it counts for its full value. The white boy has such an 
ancestry behind him; the negro boy has not, as arule. Aside from color, 
this is one of the marked differences between the two races. The colored 
boy, to succeed, must make the most of his opportunities, and improve-his 
condition by hard study and by a legitimate use of all the aid that may be 
given him. In the main, I think this will be done, and therefore I do not 
think we need have any fear as to the result. Schools are multiplying — 
north, south, east, and west—especially for the training of colored children, 
and they are taking advantage of them. The work of the American Mis- 
sionary Association speaks for itself. Its seven or more institutions for the 
higher education of the colored people need no commendation of mine. 
Here in Nashville, the city of schools, Fisk University holds its own among 
all the rest. Then there is Roger Williams University, with other similar 
institutions, that is doing excellent work in the way of elevating the colored

people. Many of the graduates have themselves become teachers, and are 
in turn assisting their fellows in their struggles to improve their condition. 
It is well understood that education is the key to the solution of the so-called 
negro problem. I mean education in the true sense of that word—that 
kind of education that has through all ages made out of the crudest material 
strong, sturdy, courageous, yet polished and refined men and women, con- 
stituting them as invaluable parts of a great commonwealth. It is to this 
sort of education that reference is doubtless made by such excellent men as 
George W-: Cable, Dr. Haygood, Professors Smith and Baskervill, of Van- 
derbilt University, and many others who have contributed to the Open 
Letter Club series in answer to the question, “Shall the negro be educated 
or suppressed?” In language not to be misunderstood, Prof. William M. 
Baskervill says: ‘Now the whole nation is interested in preparing, nay is 
compelled to prepare, the negro for the proper use and appreciation of citi- 
zenship. Only two factors really enter into this problem —religion and edu- 
cation. How best to promote the one and in what way to provide for the 
other are matters of supreme importance to every Christian patriot.” These 
are remarkable words, and contain a great truth. 
The thought expressed here is the key to the situation. The nation is 
bound to be interested, as the condition of the American negro affects our 
common welfare for weal or for woe. For this among other reasons I be- 
lieve the Blair bill ought to have become a law and its conditions fully 
complied with. It seems to me that a great nation like ours cannot afford 
to treat this subject lightly: to use a trite phrase, it is saving at the spigot 
while it runs at the bung. The Government has a duty to perform in this 
matter, and it should see to it that there is no dilly-dallying, but prompt 
action. A better disposition of the so-called surplus could not be made 
than in the education of the negroes, especially in the South. I refer not 
only to a common-school education, but higher as well. It is hardly true 
that such aid as this bill provides for will prevent the people— white and 
black —for whose interest it was intended, from working out their own des- 
tinies; nor will it prevent a development of such self-reliant qualities as will 
make them good and faithful citizens. 
In speaking of the Blair bill the Cleveland Leader makes this pertinent 
remark: “In England, France, and Germany, as well as in the United 
States, vast sums of money are annually expended in educating the people. 
It is deemed a good national investment. It is believed that the dissemina- 
tion of learning improves the citizen, augments his value, and that he re- 
turns in his enhanced worth more than is expended upon him. This is the 
accepted opinion upon which all civilized society is based, and the Blair bill 
would bring this doctrine into practical operation in sections of the country 
where it is now excluded. The South needs more school-teachers and school- 
books. The treasury is overflowing with money, and a portion of it might 
as well be used in the interest of the illiterate children of the South. The

Blair bill throws a number of safeguards around the expenditure of the 
money to prevent waste and extravagance, and, in its present shape, it is a 
very salutary measure.” 
The South as well as the North is waking up to the importance of this 
subject, as is evidenced by the discussions now taking place and by the 
parties participating in them. The negro himself is more than an idle 
looker-on. He realizes the importance of the question and how much is at 
stake so long as it remains unsettled, though in himself he is not able to do 
much. He is, however, doing a little here and there, to which I shall call 
your attention further on. While I do not suppose the masses of the col- 
ored race, more than the masses of any other race, will pursue other than a 
common-school course such as is furnished by the common schools of the 
land, North and South, I am heartily in favor of encouraging higher edu- 
cation among the negroes of the country; and I believe that ample pro- 
visions should be made for such instruction in every State, city, town and 
hamlet throughout the Union, without regard as to what will be done with 
it—whether the parties thus trained will enter the learned professions or 
not. 
The colored people must learn —and the sooner the better—that if they 
desire to rise above their present level they must do so on merit, and not by 
favors or favoritism. They must BE rather than SEEM TO BE—esse quam 
videri. But sad to say, too many of them prefer the videri to the esse. Some 
time ago a negro educator* in speaking of the relative situation of the col- 
ored people —“ industrial training as being the first need of the South”— 
said by way of disparaging higher education, that “as leaders of the race, 
as moulders of race character, as guardians of the interest of our people, we 
must strive to prepare them to maintain their present vantage-ground in the 
labor market of the South.” This, so far as it goes, is high ground and is 
a commendable position to take; but when he adds, “ We want places for 
our boot-blacks, barbers, porters, cooks, washerwomen, chambermaids, and 
domestics of every kind,” he insults the race to which he belongs, and ex- 
hibits a lamentable lack of practical forethought. Above all else, it is the 
duty of the negro to teach the negro to aspire to be something more than 
“hewers of wood and drawers of water.” There will always be boot-blacks, 
barbers, porters, etc., among us, without any special encouragement in that 
line. Not satisfied with this, the gentleman whom I quote further adds: 
“T greatly fear that we are throwing into the community many young peo- 
ple educated beyond the ability of effectual assimilation with the balance 
of the race, and— must I say it? educated beyond their legitimate sphere,, 
according to the demands of the age and the requirements of the race.” 
If we accept this as conclusive, then the present discussion on the higher 
education of the colored race would be uncalled for and out of place. But 
we do not all agree, and it is well that we do not. Mr. Council does not   
*W. H. Council.
-P-A-G-E-552
  552 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  
take the right conception of the matter, for it is not true that we are “throw- 
ing into the community many young people educated beyond the ability of 
effectual assimilation,” but it is true that we are sending forth too many 
young men and women half-educated, and ill-prepared for the work of life. 
This is the class that makes the trouble, and not the so-called over-educated 
class. Because of this, the question propounded, “ What can be done for 
the higher education of the colored race?” is very opportune. It is not our 
purpose to overlook what has been done, but rather to improve so far as 
possible the facilities already employed, and at the same time reach a larger 
number of the illiterate masses than heretofore. I may seem radical in my 
views, but I nevertheless express my opinion, when I say that in every town 
in the United States of five thousand inhabitants and more, where there are 
any negroes at all, the same academical or high-school privileges should be 
accorded the colored children, however humble, however poor, however for- 
saken, as are enjoyed by our more favored fellow-citizen. The deeper, the 
broader the training, the better, the nobler the citizen as a rule. Then 
again, the negro is to be the negro’s instructor for many years yet, and the 
good of all demands that these instructors themselves shall be fully devel- 
oped, intellectually and morally, before they attempt to teach others. It is 
the duty of the nation, it is the duty of the State, it is the duty of the church, 
it is the duty of the community however limited may be its means, by ap- 
propriate legislation to provide for the negro’s educational wants. 
Professor Robert T. Hill, of the University of Texas, very truly says: 
“There is but one solution to the negro problem—he must be helped and 
educated into intelligent citizenship. Lack of Christian sympathy, and the 
toleration and instigation of opposition to this end, are the most cruel in-, 
dictment that can be made against us, and one for which there is no apology 
except that Dr. Haygood’s leaven is surely working.” 
Rev. John H. Boyd, of Mississippi, makes this significant statement: 
“When the negro has been qualified by education and character, he will 
secure his rights as naturally as: the heir enters into his property on reach- 
ing his majority. Social relations will adjust. themselves to the satisfaction 
of all concerned. The key to the whole situation is the elevation of the 
negro. When this is done, all other problems will be self-solving.” 
As straws indicate the direction of the wind, so these extracts may be 
taken as the drift of public opinion. The times demand that negro scholars 
of to-day should understand not only the principles of arithmetic, but those 
of algebra, geometry, calculus, civil engineering, quaternions—the higher 
mathematics generally—as well as the sciences and the languages, both 
ancient and modern; ripe scholarship in all that the term implies. Short 
courses will not suffice. Courses adapted to the negro of limited advantages 
are not always desirable. The colored child, like the white, must by slow 
stages work up to the established curricula of our best high schools, acade- 
mies, and colleges. In the establishment of schools of a higher grade, espe-
-P-A-G-E-553

cially for colored children, the tendency has been to lower the standard in 
order that as large a number as possible might be accommodated. This is 
injustice to the negro, and it is injustice to the public. It is injustice to the 
negro, in that he fails to receive such instruction as the rank and grade of 
the school entitle him to; injustice to the public, in that it is led to believe 
that the colored boy knows more than he really does. In other words, I 
am opposed to discriminating in the matter of instruction. The colored 
people are putting forth efforts to help themselves. They have schools of 
their own projected by themselves, some real and some imaginary — that is, 
some that are greater in name than they are in fact. The African Metho- 
dist Episcopal Church, in addition to its Wilberforce University, with which 
I am connected, has an institution in Atlanta, Ga., called Morris Brown 
College; another in Columbia, S. C., called Allen University; another in 
Waco, Texas, called Paul Quinn College; still another in Jacksonville, 
Fla., called the Divinity High School. Other colored denominations have 
schools of similar grade under their own immediate supervision. All the 
schools under negro management, however, are generally financially weak. 
This is due to the fact that the white people of our country have not suffi- 
cient confidence in the negro’s ability to handle and disburse wisely large 
sums of money, and therefore no large bequests for such schools come from 
that source. Thus the work of higher education as controlled by the col- 
ored people themselves lives by faith rather than by money. I cannot be- 
lieve that this state of things will always continue. There are indications 
to the contrary. 
‘When the negro educator shall have fully demonstrated his executive 
ability in the line of his profession, there will be no reason to doubt that a 
change will take place in his favor. It must come. At present he is not 
permitted to act as even one of a number of trustees of special funds— 
such as the Slater and Hand funds, etc., which are for the special education 
of his race. Nothing can be done. We must accept the situation, honor 
the memory of the donors, appreciate the gifts, and be patient. But no 
other nationality is thus treated. No one knows the negro better than the 
negro knows himself; and if one of this race can be found who is an ac- 
complished scholar, and otherwise fitted for the work in hand, that negro 
should be used for what he is worth in advancing the interests, not only of 
his own people, but the interests of all concerned, Then will the cause of 
higher education among the colored people be greatly promoted, for the 
negro himself will, by his relation to the agencies employed, find a deeper 
interest in the results to be obtained.

  PEDAGOGICAL CHAIRS. 559 
  
PAPERS AND DISCUSSIONS. 
PEDAGOGICAL CHAIRS IN COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. 
B. A. HINSDALE, ANN ARBOR, MICHIGAN. 
Pedagogical chairs have long existed in the principal universities of 
Germany. Since 1876 the “Bell Chairs of the Theory, History and Art of 
Education” have existed in the Universities of St. Andrews and Edinburgh, 
Scotland; and still more recently similar chairs have been established in 
several of the universities of the United States. The object of this paper is 
to justify the existence of these chairs: not pedagogical instruction, nor peda- 
gogical chairs in general, but such instruction and such chairs in colleges 
and universities. 
At the outset, attention may be drawn to three historical facts: Germany 
leads the world in scholarship and scientific research, and particularly in 
the cultivation of educational science; Scotland, also, is a classic land of 
learning and of schools; moreover, our American chairs of pedagogy are a 
result of the widest and profoundest interest in educational subjects known 
to our history. These facts are very significant, creating a strong presump- 
tion that these German, Scottish and American professorships are not the 
results of ignorance or accident, but of intelligent choice and a felt need. 
From the high vantage-ground of this presumption, the broader aspects of 
the subject will be surveyed. ; 
The word “education” is one of the most plastic and flexible in the lan- 
guage. It is used dynamically and statically, in a collective and in an indi- 
vidual sense. Excluding all life but human life, also the collective and the 
static senses, we find the word employed in three different acceptations. 
1. The process of transformation wrought in a man by all the agents and 
powers that act on him, of whatever kind, from the cradle to the grave; as 
well those that constitute his natural and social improvement, as those that 
constitute the home and the school; as well those that are blind, unconscious, 
and unpremeditated, as those that are intelligent, conscious, and premed- 
itated. 
2. The process of transformation wrought in a man by the premeditated 
action of society, with a view of developing his powers and moulding his 
character; such efforts being put forth more especially in his infancy and 
youth. 
3. The process of transformation wrought in a man, mostly in his youth

and plastic years, by governors and tutors, and particularly in schools of 
some sort. 
The first of these definitions includes both the others; the second includes 
the third. Just how much of the whole field the science of education covers, 
and whether this science and pedagogy are coéxtensive, are questions not defi- 
nitely settled. “A complete history of education,” says Compayré, “would 
embrace, in its vast developments, the entire record of the intellectual and 
moral culture of mankind at all periods and in all countries. It would be 
a résumé of the life of humanity in its diverse manifestations, literary and 
scientific, religious and political. It would determine the causes, so numer- 
ous and so diverse, which act upon the characters of men, and which, modi- 
fying a common endowment, produce beings which are as different as are a 
contemporary of Pericles and a modern European, a Frenchman of the 
Middle Ages, and a Frenchman subsequent to the revolution.” The ex- 
treme limits of this field are determined by such inquiries as those that have 
engaged the attention of Mr. E. B. Taylor and Sir John Lubbock, on the 
one hand, and such speculations and visions as those of Plato, Gerson, and 
Swedenborg, on the other. A history of education in this sense would be, 
as Compayré says, “‘a sort of philosophy of history, to which nothing would 
be foreign, and which would scrutinize in its most varied and most trifling 
causes, as well as in its most profound sources, the moral life of humanity.” 
The university cultivates this vast field, although not under the name of a 
single science. The chairs of anthropology, history, archeology and an- 
tiquities, philosophy, literature, philology, ethics, comparative religion, juris- 
prudence, and politics, mark its most important subdivisions. No one 
denies the university’s right to investigate or teach every one of these or 
related subjects. But when, with Compayré, we throw out the “occult co- 
adjutors of education—climate, race, manners, social conditions, political 
institutions, religious beliefs,’ and narrow the field to the “premeditated 
action which the will of one man exercises over other men in order to in- 
struct them and train them;”* or when, with Bain, we throw out still other 
factors, and confine the science of education to the “arts and methods em- 
ployed hy the school-master,” as typifying the educational process in its 
greatest singleness and purity +—when this is done, is the remaining terri- 
tory the proper subject of university investigation and instruction? So long 
as the university investigates and teaches the ideas, habits, customs, govern- 
ments, and religions of the lowest savages—that is, the whole compass of 
their culture—it will be difficult to deny its rights to treat with equal re- 
spect the educational ideas, theories, methods, appliances, and systems of the 
most highly civilized nations. 
By common consent the university has two great functions. One of these 
is research, the discovery of truth; the other is instruction, the practice of

the art of teaching—that is, the university first finds out truth, and then 
gives it forth. The two interact. Furthermore, the university not only 
practices research, but it makes research itself the object of study and in- 
vestigation. Science becomes reflective, and lays bare all her processes 
and methods. Why, then, should it not investigate and teach its other 
function, viz., that of teaching? Why should an institution that exists for 
the sake of investigating the arts and sciences, leave its own peculiar art 
neglected and despised ? 
But education is much more than a great and difficult art: it is a noble 
science. Back of its methods, processes, and systems, are facts, ideas, prin- 
ciples, and theories—in fact, whole systems of philosophy. As Rosenkranz 
remarks, pedagogy cannot be deduced from a single principle with such 
strictness as logic and ethics, but is a mixed science, like medicine, deriving 
its presuppositions from other sciences,* as physiology, psychology, logic, 
esthetics, ethics, and sociology. It is therefore conditioned upon some of 
the noblest of the sciences, especially those of the moral group. , The very 
fact that it is a mixed science adds to its difficulty, and emphasizes the de- 
mand for its cultivation. It is hard to see how the university, whose ad- 
mitted function is education, can pass by the science of education without 
discrediting its own work and virtually denying its own name. To practice 
the art and refuse to cultivate or aan the science of teaching, is little bet- 
ter than rank empiricism. 
The last argument derives additional strength from the peculiar stage of 
education upon which the foremost nations and countries have now entered. 
Education has at last reached the “reflective or scientific stage. Throwing 
off the clutch of the empiricist, she has ascended to her long-vacant seat in 
the family of sciences. Evidences of this are the increased attention paid 
to education by text-writers on psychology and ethics, the later pedagogical 
literature, and the more systematic and rational methods of instruction in 
schools, and the rapidly-increasing facilities for teaching educational science. 
Thus the very existence of the chair is a proof of its usefulness and its 
necessity. On this ground alone—indeed, on the narrower ground of en- 
dowing research alone—the chair can be fully vindicated. 
Again, education has a history. In the very broadest sense, the field of 
educational history is the field of human culture; and even when limited, 
as before, to the conscious work of teachers in schools, it still presents whole 
series of facts, problems and lessons of the greatest interest and importance. 
Before the pedagogist lies the whole field of school-life, from the simple 
prophets’ and priests’ schools of early times to the highly-developed schools 
and school systems of Europe and America. While education belongs to 
general history, the study of which is pursued for its culture value, it has 
been almost wholly neglected. The writer and lecturer on general history 
do indeed touch the education of the ancients, and make mention of the

‘medizval universities; they pay some small attention to the marvelous edu- 
cational developments of modern times; but they lay much more emphasis 
on subjects of far inferior interest. But education should be made the sub- 
ject of special historical study as much as religion, art, or politics. Were 
it as thoroughly investigated as the Polytechnic School of Miinich investi- 
gates engineering (maintaining forty-five distinct courses of lectures in that 
science), the history of education alone would tax the resources of the most 
learned and laborious professor. -It is not contended that the chair of ped- 
agogy can at present cultivate this field as carefully as this allusion may 
imply; but certainly here are topics of the greatest interest and importance, 
that demand admission to the university list on an equal footing with other 
subjects of historical investigation. So long as the history of education is 
a means of education, so long will it continue a proper university study. 
Thus far the argument has been theoretical, resting on the need of in- 
vestigating the science, art and history of teaching, and on their educational 
value. But the practical phases of the subject must also be presented. 
1. Even if the work done by the pedagogical chair should pay no imme- 
diate attention to the preparation of teachers, it could not fail to be of much 
practical value. The scientific study and teaching of a science and an art 
in their purely theoretical aspects always promote the practice of the art; 
and the presence in every university in the land of a pedagogical professor, 
thoroughly devoted to his chair, could not fail to quicken interest in the 
subject, and to promote the teaching art. 
2. While it is a serious error to hold the university merely as a place of 
instruction and to overlook research—an error that is only too common in 
the United States — instruction is still one of its grand functions. It is en- 
gaged in teaching the highest branches of knowledge. Its professors hold 
their chairs by reason of their professional ability, as well as by reason of 
their learning. Where, then, may the science, the history, and the art of 
teaching be so properly taught as where the art flourishes in its highest 
forms? 
3. The conditions of pedagogical study existing in the university are the 
best that can be imagined. First, the university offers the student a varied 
curriculum from which to choose collateral studies. Secondly, it illustrates 
teaching in all the branches of liberal, and in many branches of technical 
study. Thirdly, the library, which furnishes an extensive apparatus for 
general as well as special study, is an invaluable facility. Fourthly, the 
university is the home of liberal studies; its traditions and associations are 
conducive to cultivation, and the student in residence finds himself in the 
midst of a learned and cultivated society. 
The last of these points is deserving of a more elaborate statement. It is 
well known that special schools tend at once to depth and narrowness: in- 
tension is secured at the expense of extension. This is necessary to a degree; 
but if the process is carried too far, mischievous results follow. Hence the
-P-A-G-E-563
  PEDAGOGICAL CHAIRS. 563   
advantage of uniting the professional school with the school of liberal studies ; 
an advantage greater now than ever before, because scholars, men of science 
and teachers are pushing specialization to its extreme limits. We should 
not be surprised, therefore, to find all the writers who have touched the 
topic laying much stress on the advantage to the student of receiving his 
pedagogical instruction in unacademical institutions. Professor Laurie in- 
sists that the teachers of the secondary schools of Scotland need professional 
preparation as well as university training. ‘“ Where shall they get this?” 
he asks. “They might be required to combine attendance at a training 
college with attendance at the university for a degree; but this, though it 
might serve as a provisional arrangement, would not secure the end we seek. 
And why should not this arrangement secure the end we seek? For this 
reason, and for no other, that a specialist training college does not answer 
the same purpose as a university. The broader culture, the purer air, the 
higher aims of the latter give to it an educational influence which specialist 
colleges can never exercise.” * 
Whether academical teaching should be furnished in a normal school, is 
a question often discussed. That question does not come within the range 
of this paper; but the observation may be made that such instruction must 
be defended theoretically, if at all, on the ground of its liberalizing and 
strengthening tendencies. 
4. It is a function of the university to furnish society with teachers. Re- 
search, teaching, and the preparation of teachers, are the three great duties 
that it owes society. The preparation of teachers for primary and grammar 
schools, and possibly for the lower classes of high schools, may be left to 
normal and training schools. But high schools and other secondary schools 
must receive their character from teachers of a higher grade of scholarship. 
It is the favorite conceit of some public-school men that the public schools 
are fully adequate to create their own teachers, unless it be in some of the 
more special lines of high-school study and instruction; even the superin- 
tendents, they hold, should “come up from the ranks;” but no man who 
understands the tendencies and effects of specialization, particularly the re- 
sults of breeding in-and-in, will for a moment favor such a narrow policy. 
The public schools have done an invaluable work in furnishing teachers to 
society; but it is a weighty fact that no schools more need to be kept in 
vital relation with the schools of higher instruction. 
5. The chair of pedagogy and the teaching profession need the strength 
and dignity that university recognition will give them. Such recognition 
will be the strongest testimony that the university can bear to the public 
of the estimate in which it holds the art that it exists to practice. In that 
way, too, it will most strongly impress its students with the estimate in which 
it holds the teacher’s calling. When our aspiring young men and women 
see accomplished professors of the science, history and art of teaching in   
*The Training of Teachers, 10, 11. London, 1882,
-P-A-G-E-564
    564 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  
the colleges and universities of the land, vying with the professors of phi- 
losophy, ethics, jurisprudence, political economy, and history, in the exposi- 
tion of their favorite subjects, they will form a higher conception of the 
teacher’s work. This argument also has been urged with much force by 
writers on education. Professor Laurie, for example, says that the teaching 
profession of Scotland, almost with one voice, hailed the action of the trus- 
tees of the Bell fund, who established the Bell chairs at St. Andrews and 
Edinburgh. The feeling was, they “have conferred honor on a depart- 
ment of work that Dr. Bell delighted to honor. They have unquestionably 
done very much to promote education in Scotland, not only by raising the 
work of the school-master in public estimation, but also by attracting public 
attention to education as being not merely a question of machinery for the 
institution of schools (essential though this undoubtedly is), but a question 
of principles and methods—in brief, of philosophy.” He says, further, 
that the institution of the Edinburgh chair increased the importance of the 
teaching body, gave it academical standing, and made it possible for the 
first time to institute in the universities a faculty of education, like the fac- 
ulties of law, medicine, and theology.* : 
The argument can be strengthened by historical analogies. Professional 
instruction has long been given in the highest seminaries of learning. The 
learned professions have loved to nestle under the wings of the universi- 
ties. The faculties of theology, law, and medicine, have so long been con- 
stituent parts of the university that some may suppose that such has always 
been the case. But this is not the fact: the faculty of arts is the original 
faculty on which the university was founded, and around which the other 
faculties have grown up. One of our ablest American pedagogists—my 
honored predecessor at the University of Michigan, President W. H. Payne— 
says: “The main strength of the recognized professions. is their organic con- 
nection with great seats of learning. Law, medicine, and theology,” he goes 
so far as to say, “had never been professions except on the condition of uni- 
versity recognition and support; nor could their professional character be 
sustained if this support were withdrawn.” + 
The argument from recognition derives additional strength from the his- 
tory of education. No other noble art have men treated with such general 
contempt. No other noble calling, at least insits lower walks, has been 
abandoned to such unworthy agents. According to Socrates, the Athenians 
took more care in selecting trainers for their horses than for their children; 
and Plutarch says that in his day, as men assigned their slaves to different 
employments according to their fitness, if they found any slave who was a 
drunkard or a glutton, or unfit for any other business, they made him a ped- 
agogue. Luther says he was whipped fifteen times on one day at school, 
because he could not recite what he had not been taught. Compayré says,

as late as 1837 the French school-masters practiced all the trades; they were 
day laborers, shoemakers, ushers, beadles, and inn-keepers; they were poorly 
paid, and enjoyed no social consideration; they were on the same footing as 
mendicants, and were often infirm, crippled, and unfit for any kind of work. 
Carleton has told the tale of the hedge school-masters of Ireland. Whether 
men have despised the training of children, and so committed it to such un- 
worthy agents, or whether they have allowed it to fall into such hands and 
then despised it, is immaterial; but certainly from classic days to recent 
times the elementary school and its teachers have been made the subjects of 
keenest ridicule. What a figure the school-master cuts in literature, from 
the days of “the flogging Orbilius” to the days of Dominie Sampson and 
Squeers! Commonly cruel and tyrannical, generally ignorant, always un- 
couth and awkward, and if occasionally learned, also pedantic, the school- 
master of literature is not a character in whom to feel a professional pride. 
No doubt the satirists have made the most of their opportunities; no doubt 
there have been many admirable teachers; but on the whole, in no other 
vocation has the workman fallen so far below his work as in teaching. We 
live in better times. At present, society is demanding that teachers shall 
haye higher literary qualifications, and that they shall be superior persons; 
both of them most hopeful signs. The university will materially strengthen 
these tendencies by maintaining the chair of education. 
6. There is still a broader ground upon which the question can be urged. 
Teachers are not the only persons who are interested in educational prob- 
lems. Those problems concern and should interest all intelligent men and 
women. If the graduates from our higher institutions of learning could 
take two courses of lectures, one in theory and practice and one in the his- 
tory of education, before receiving their diplomas, they would find the knowl- 
edge and training thus received of very great’ advantage to them. Mr. 
Spencer’s vigorous argument on this point will not soon be forgotten. “The 
subject which involves all other subjects, and therefore the subject in which the 
education of every one should terminate, is the theory and practice of teaching.” 
7. The university itself needs the chair of education to give it complete- 
ness and symmetry. So long as its right, its duty even, to investigate and 
teach the arts and sciences generally is not only admitted but asserted, it is 
strange, indeed, that anyone should question its right and duty to investi- 
gate and teach its own processes and the principles underlying them. The 
fact is, in this respect the university is an empiricist. Heretofore it might 
say in self-defense that education was largely empirical; but that argument 
has now lost all force. Nor can a university in any other way so effectually 
defend education against that charge as by creating a professorship to culti- 
vate it as a science. 
But this is not all: the university needs the chair for practical reasons, 
separate and apart from the preparation of teachers. Its occupant, if a 
man of real force and attainments, could not fail to stimulate pedagogical

thought among both professors and students, thus creating a mental habit 
and an atmosphere that would be useful in many ways. Somebody should 
stand in the faculty for educational science. Particular stress may be laid 
on the new college and university conditions growing out of elective studies, 
such as forcing upon students the difficult and important subject of educa- 
tional values. Then the study of education may be strongly recommended 
to advanced students on disciplinary and culture grounds. When they near 
the end of the curriculum they cannot, indeed, correct the mistakes that they 
have made; but they can codrdinate their knowledge and their ideas, giving 
to the sum-total of their attainments something of the form and consistency 
of system. And this is in the highest degree desirable. It solidifies, and 
so preserves, what has been learned, and influences further acquirement. 
It is my firm conviction that college and university seniors generally could 
spend a semester in such an intellectual clearing-house with the greatest 
advantage. Nor is there any place where this work can be so well done as 
in the class-room of a competent professor of pedagogy. On this ground 
alone, a chair of pedagogy in the higher institutions can be successfully ad- 
vocated. 
The history of the universities throws much light on our subject; and 
I shall close by stating some of the more important facts of that history, 
drawing them from Sir William Hamilton’s articles on “English Universi- 
ties” and “ University Reform,” published in the Edinburgh Review* a half- 
century ago, and from other sources. 
In the older universities of the Parisian model, instruction was not con- 
fided to a special body of professors; the university was taught and governed 
by the graduates-at-large. Professor, Master and Doctor were synonymous 
terms. Every graduate had the equal right to teach publicly in the uni- 
versity the subjects belonging to his faculty and to the rank of his degree, 
and was even required by the terms of his degree to do so. The bachelor 
was bound to read, under a master or doctor in his faculty, a course of 
lectures; and the master or doctor was obliged immediately to commence 
(ineepere) and to continue for a certain period to teach (regere) some of the 
subjects belonging to his faculty. Hence “commencement,” the time when 
the perfect graduate commenced to teach; hence the so-called “necessary 
regency.” However, the universities did not enforce the obligation of pub- 
' lie teaching so long as there were a competent number of voluntary teachers, 
or regents, to do the work; besides, the schools belonging to the several 
faculties were frequently inadequate to accommodate the young inceptors. 
And so it came to pass that the period of necessary regency was successively 
shortened, and finally dispensations from actual teaching were commonly 
allowed. In these circumstances originated the distinction of regent and 
non-regent; to the first of whom, progressively, full privileges of legislation   
* Found in “Discussions of Philosophy and Literature, Education and University Reform.” Edin- 
burgh and London, 1866. .
-P-A-G-E-567
PEDAGOGICAL CHAIRS. 567 
  
and government came to be confined. This distinction was most rigidly 
marked in the faculty of the arts. “In the other faculties,” says Sir Will- 
jam Hamilton, “both Paris and Oxford, all doctors succeeded in usurping 
the style and privileges of regent, though not actually engaged in teaching; 
and in Oxford the same was allowed to masters of the faculty of arts during 
the statutory period of their necessary regency, even when availing them- 
selves of a dispensation from the performance of its duties, and extended 
to the heads of houses and to college deans.” 
Hamilton says the teaching function was accorded the bachelor on two 
grounds: “Partly as an exercise towards the higher honor, and useful to 
himself; partly as a performance due for the degree obtained, and of advan- 
tage to others.” But while recognizing the responsibility of the imperfect 
graduate to the university, and to the public, he lays the larger stress on 
the other branch of the argument. He says: “The compulsory lecturing 
—the necessary regency of graduates or inceptors in the ancient universities, 
mainly proceeded on the profound principle, Doce ut discas. As the scho- 
lastic proverb runs: 
“Discere si queris, doceas, sic ipse doceris; 
Nam studio tali proficis atque sodali.” 
The advantage that the learner derives from teaching was a favorite topic 
with this great scholar, thinker, and teacher, and he returns to it again and 
again. Among others he quotes Bishop Sanderson, who in turn quotes one 
of the Rabbis: “I have learned much from my masters, more from my 
equals, but most of all from my disciples.” 
Sir William Hamilton shows that the course of academical history was 
very different in England and in Germany. In the English universities, 
the graduate remained in the legislative and ruling body, although practi- 
cally denied his right to teach in the school; in the German universities, he 
retained his privilege of teaching but lost that of governing. In Germany 
“it is only requisite that he should farther write, and formally defend what 
is-called a Dissertatio ad locum, to enable him to lecture in the university, on 
any subject within the compass of his faculty, and to have bis course or 
courses announced in the public Series Prelectionwm. The opportunity thus 
afforded to all graduates of publicly manifesting their learning, and their 
ability as teachers, is with the admirable system of academical patronage, a 
main cause of the uniform excellence of the German Protestant universities, 
as organs of information.” The thesis that the candidate for the Doctor’s 
degree is now required to “defend” as well as to read, is a survival of the 
ancient custom. 
It is not difficult to discover the causes that made bachelors as well as 
masters university teachers, and that afterwards ousted them from their 
privileges, The multitude of pupils that flocked to the medieval universi- 
ties, 10,000 to Bologna, and 30,000 to Oxford, many of whom were very 
young and immature, called for a large number of teachers. The university
-P-A-G-E-568

felt its obligations to the public. Moreover, the conviction that teaching is 
a most important means of learning had great influence. The establishment 
of secondary schools, which drew away the younger pupils from the univer- 
sities; the growth of science in both breadth and depth; the development of 
specialization in teaching and in research; and the ambition of the “ Dons” 
—these are the main causes that banished from the universities the some- 
what miscellaneous body of teachers of the earlier times, and established a 
body of professional instructors. The change was not only natural but in- 
evitable. 
* The causes that banished the graduate, perfect as well as imperfect, from 
the university as a teacher, will prevent his reappearance in that capacity. 
The university cannot again furnish society with teachers, or teachers with 
needed discipline, in the ancient manner. The forces that worked the great 
change are far stronger to prevent its being unworked. This is a revolution 
that will not go backward. What then? Shall the university forget its 
ancient function of furnishing society with teachers? Shall it pretend that 
when it has made scholars it has also made teachers, and thus ignore or deny 
the value of professional training? Shall it confine itself to research and to 
teaching? Or shall it remember its ancient practice, and, recognizing all 
the new conditions, including the demand for the professional training of 
teachers, establish and maintain the Chair of Education until the time comes 
for the chair to give way to the Faculty of Education? This last is a ques- 
tion to which there can be but one answer. 
It will be seen that while the college and university are mentioned to- 
gether in the caption of this paper, the university alone has been mentioned 
in the argument. Hence the observation that, as the college raises its stand- 
ard and approaches the level of university work, the same reasons will apply 
to it as to the university. 
DISCUSSION.* 
8. S. Parr, of Minnesota: ‘While chairs of didactics do a good work and 
accomplish much for education, the distinction must be clearly drawn be- 
tween the kind of work they can do, and that done by professional schools. 
Chairs of didacties do work of a general nature; professional schools do 
work of a distinctly specific nature. 
JEROME ALLEN, of New York: The distinction should be made between 
college and university work, and normal-school work. Shall we have peda- 
gogical work of high order in universities, or shall the instruction of peda- 
gogy be confined to normal schools? The question is often asked, “ Who 
are our professional educators?” Persons who teach, often pursue other vo-

cations, so that it is difficult to know who are genuine professional teachers. 
Only when our colleges and universities shall have regular chairs, or better, 
faculties of pedagogics, can we point out distinctly our professional teachers. 
JosEPH Batpwin, of Texas: I regard the paper as complete, and in need 
of no comment other than praise, and the commendation of the section. 
Demands are now being made upon our institutions of learning which they 
must meet. It is reasonably expected now, that the higher seminaries shall 
send out graduates competent to teach. But how can they teach without 
special preparation? Would a young graduate venture upon the preroga- 
tives of an attorney without careful study of law and jurisprudence? Would 
he venture to restore the sick to health without the careful preparation given 
ina medical school? Shall we, then, send out teachers without special prep- 
aration? We do what we can, to be sure, in our normal schools; but many 
_ of our teachers never enter normal schools; hence the necessity for peda- 
gogical instruction in all our colleges and universities. We should there- 
fore press this matter, and encourage even every boarding-school to establish 
and maintain chairs of pedagogy. 
James H. Hoosn, of New York: Concerning chairs of pedagogy, I say, 
the more the better, as a rule. But I ask, What will be the benefit of lect- 
ures delivered to students in ordinary boarding-schools and colleges while 
they are pursuing academic studies? The pursuit of the regular curriculum 
will absorb all their energies and time; and they will care but little for the 
theory and methods of teaching before they realize the necessity of prepar- 
ing to enter the school-room as teachers. What we need, then, are schools 
of practice; not lectures on the history of education. 
Mr. Auten: Why not study the history of education, as well as the his- 
tory of the church or of civil government? 
Mr. Hoose: I admit that; but I hold that the average school-boy or girl 
is not interested in the philosophy of such history, or in a discussion of the 
theory and methods of imparting information. What they want is practice 
—feeling of the pulse, as it were, of real, living pupils—and not empty 
theorizing. Hence, I say, let all our colleges and universities first establish 
practice departments in which to set up pedagogical chairs. 
B, A. Hinspate, of Michigan: In practice, nearly all colleges which have 
pedagogical chairs, have, as pupils for such instruction, young men and 
women who have had more or less experience as teachers. 
W. B. Powett, of Washington, D.C.: This is an important subject of dis- 
cussion. I doubt if the history of education is of any importance compared 
with the science of education. My experience shows that time given to boys 
and girls in teaching the history of education is almost lost. The science 
of teaching is the proper field of normal instruction, or the investigation of 
sciences after they have been academically mastered.

REPORT OF THE “CHICAGO COMMITTEE” ON METHODS 
OF INSTRUCTION, AND COURSES OF STUDY IN 
NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
The committee appointed two years ago at the meeting of the National 
Educational Association, in Chicago, to continue the inquiry into the ques- 
tion of the courses of study and methods of instruction pursued in the nor- 
mal schools of the United States, begs leave to submit the following report: 
It should be remarked that the geographical relation of the committee 
has made any conference impossible. The chairman prepared the circulars 
and submitted them to the other members, who approved them. Later, a 
couple of letters were sent to the New England members asking for sugges- 
tions, that brought forth no fruit. Beyond this the chairman was obliged 
to assume the entire responsibility. 
The present report was intended, as I understood the instructions of this 
body to imply, rather as a completion of the line of thought in the report 
for 1887, than as the opening of new fields of inquiry. In view of the mis- 
cellaneous results to the inquiries sent out two years ago, it was thought 
wiser to confine the present circulars to normal and training schools sup- 
ported in whole or in part by public taxation. It was believed that a better 
understanding of the problem could be thus gained; a clearer definition of 
terms, and information secured based upon a more nearly common use of 
them. 
The results fully confirm this judgment. While the report does not cover 
all of the points upon which information is needed, nor exhaust many ques- 
tions started by it, the results may be taken as expressing the average view of 
the leading normal schools of this country; as in fact an expression of the way 
in which the problem is now regarded by those who must be acknowledged as 
most competent to judge. 
The whole number of schools reporting is 49; those answering nearly 
all of the questions number about 35. These are the leading State schools 
of the entire country, embracing Maine, Massachusetts, Vermont, Rhode 
Island, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Alabama, Loui- 
siana, Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Nebraska, Illinois, 
Missouri, Kansas, New Hampshire, California, and New Jersey. In addi- 
tion to these, 8 city training schools sent replies more or less complete. 
The following is a copy of the circular sent:

* A CIRCULAR 
CONCERNING THE METHODS OF INSTRUCTION IN USE IN THE NORMAL SCHOOLS OF THE UNITED STATES, 
With a view of carrying forward the work of the last two years, the committee 
appointed at the last meeting of the National Educational Association, held in Chi- 
cago, July, 1887, were instructed to inquire with greater detail into the methods of 
instruction and courses of study pursued in the normal schools of the United States.
-P-A-G-E-571
  METHODS AND COURSES IN NORMAL SCHOOLS. 571 
  
The work of the past two years has so clearly developed the real character of 
many educational institutions of the country going by the name of normal schools, 
that it seems wiser, because of the promise of more substantial results, to confine 
further inquiry, for the present at least, to those normal schools which are supported 
in whole or in part by public money, and to colleges and universities having a well- 
defined department of pedagogy. 
As a further contribution, therefore, toward the solution of the problem of the 
professional training of teachers, replies are respectfully asked to the questions 
contained in this circular. The hearty and explicit responses hitherto sent show 
the appreciation of the importance of the work in which the committee is engaged. 
If this inquiry can be prosecuted by the Association with zeal and intelligence, sub- 
stantial benefits must accrue to all schools engaged upon this most vital of all edu- 
cational problems — the training of teachers. Tuomas J. Gray, 
Apert G. BoypEn, 
C. C. Rounps, 
Please return all replies to the Chairman, St. Cloud, Minn. Committee.

1. Name of the Institution, ——. Location, ——. Its chief officer, title ——, 
name . Ifa chair of pedagogy, the name of the professor also. 
2. Upon what branches are candidates for admission to the school examined? 
[Norr.—If a college, please answer this question by giving the name of the class or classes in- structed in pedagogy. ] 
8. State in weeks the time given to each of the following subjects: 
[Nore.—A week will be understood to be one recitation of 45 minutes daily for five days. Please reduce all answers to this standard,]

books, . Science of Education , text-book Methods of Teaching the 
Various Branches ——, text-book . Mental Science or Psychology , text- 
book . School Economy , text-book . 
[ Norx.—If two or more of these subjects are included in your course under a single name, please do 
not duplicate your answers. The Committee wish to obtain exact information concerning each subject separately.] 
4, Is there a school of children, or as it is commonly called, a Model or Practice 
School, connected with your school? How many grades does it embrace? 
Nore.—The term grade will be understood as a year of average public-school work.] 
5. Do the students of pedagogy (those in training for teaching) do practice- 
teaching in the model school? 
[Nore.—The term practice-teaching will be understood to mean actual instruction of learners, not the exemplification of educational principles with classmates who are assumed to be children, or the ob- servation of the work of other teachers.] 
6. Do these students spend any time in observing the work of other teachers in 
the model school? 
7. How many periods of 45 minutes each are required of the practice-teachers in 
actual teaching during their course of study as a condition of graduation? 
8. How many in observation? 
Nores.—(1) Observation will be understood to be the work to which a pupil is regularly assigned, upon which he is to give a subsequent report. (2) If the time called for in 7 and 8 varies with the different students, please give the average required for graduation.] 
9. Is the practice-teaching a daily exercise during the time of its continuance? 
10. Do you require all practice-teachers to teach for the same length of time? 
11. What pedagogical branches are completed before the student is allowed to be- 
gin to practice? [See question 3.] 
12. Do your practice-teachers recite as students in any branches of their course of 
study during the days in which they are engaged in practice-teaching? On an aver- 
age, how many daily?

13. Do your practice-teachers do practice-teaching in any other school than a 
model or training school? 
[Nore.—If so, please answer questions 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 as applying to this teaching.] 
14. Do your students exemplify their methods of teaching by giving lessons to 
their classmates who assume to be children? [See note, question 5.] 
15. How many such lessons is each student required to give? 
16. Is any portion of the time indicated in question 7 included in your reply to 
question 8? If so, what part? ; 
17. What are the main points upon which you criticise the work done by the prac- 
tice-teachers? 
18. What plan have you for the work of “observation,” and how do you get at the 
results? 
19. Do you find the principles of the science of education to be better learned in 
connection with practice-teaching, or following it, or preceding it, or without it? 
What would be your ideal arrangment of the order of the pedagogical subjects in 
question 3? 
20. How long acourse of pedagogy ought to be required of those having adequate 
academic preparation to admit them to the profession with the rank of assistants in 
high schools and higher positions? 
21. In your judgment, can a knowledge of a subject from the teaching point of 
view be acquired by the pupil while he is pursuing it asa learner? Please define 
“teaching point of view,” that is, designate what you understand by a teacher's 
knowledge of a subject. 
22. For the purposes of pedagogical training, where, in the course of study in nor- 
mal schools, should come the consideration of the so-called ‘elementary or instru- 
mental subjects, (reading, writing, geography, grammar, and arithmetic, )—before or 
after the general academic work? 
23. Inasmuch as normal schools cannot supply one-tenth of the number of teach- 
ers actually needed by the public schools, would it be better for them rather to de- 
fine their courses in pedagogy to attract to them the men and women of liberal 
education, who are seeking to enter the profession, or to continue to depend largely 
upon the country schools to fit their material? 
24, Would a conference of normal-school teachers and professors of pedagogy to 
formulate such a course of study be of service to the cause of education? Is sucha 
thing feasible? Please answer ad libitum. 
25. What changes would you suggest in the following classification: 
PEDAGOGICAL SuBJECTS.—History of Education, Science of Education, School Economy, Mental. 
Science or Psychology, Moral Science, Methods of Teaching applied to the instrumental subjects [see 
question 22], Practice Teaching. 
AcapEmic SuBsEcts.—All other subjects of the course. 
26. What is the average age of your graduating class? 
27. What per cent. of your students enrolled in the pedagogical course graduates? 
28. What per cent. of your graduates from the pedagogical work are young men? 
29. What average length of time do your graduates teach after leaving school? 
30. In what year did you graduate your first class? 
31. How many students have you enrolled in your classes this year who expect to 
teach? [Please give answer in figures. ] 
32. What per cent. of these students are graduates of high schools or colleges? 
The Committee will consider it a great favor if you will send any printed matter 
showing the organization and plans of your school, or of any special work. They 
will likewise accept in the same spirit any criticisms, suggestions or discussions of 
any points connected with the important duty they have to discharge. It would

seem that the time is ripe for a better definition of the work of training teachers, 
and a more thorough understanding among those to whom society has committed 
this labor of love. 
Please return this circular to the undersigned, Chairman of the Committee. 
Tuomas J. Gray, St. Cloud, Minnesota. 
The difficulty of reducing a series of answers to a common standard, so 
as to tell the truth as the authors intended, will be appreciated by every 
one who has tried to go through the process. One needs that rare gift of 
“reading between the lines” to fairly interpret the replies to such a list of 
questions as the circular contains. Where questions cover the same ground 
as in the circular of 1887, they are to be interpreted as a request for better- 
defined information, 
Question 2, asking for requirements for admission to normal schools, 
had the following answers: In 22 schools only the common branches are 
required —the common branches meaning reading, writing, spelling, geog- 
raphy, grammar, and arithmetic. In no case does the entrance examination 
appear to be a final examination, but one intended to prove to the examiner 
a fair working ability in those subjects, making it possible to study them 
more broadly while in the normal school. In Minnesota the questions used 
by the county superintendents for the second-grade teacher’s certificate 
(there being three grades known in the State—third, second, and first) are, 
by official sanction of the State Normal School Board, made the minimum 
requirement. The following sets of questions, taken from the catalogue of 
the State Normal School at Worcester, Massachusetts, suggest the grade of 
scholastic knowledge deemed necessary on the part of the beginner in a 
teachers’ training school in the native American home of normal schools: 
QUESTIONS USED AT THE ENTRANCE EXAMINATION (WRITTEN PART), FEBRUARY, 1887.

It is to be remembered in this connection that the average age of the 
graduates of these schools proves that they are dealing with a much more 
mature body of students than the high schools—a fact of great weight in 
estimating the real ability of a pupil, for it is well known to every teacher 
of any experience that the young man off the farm, of eighteen or twenty, 
with a fair country-school education, may and usually does outstrip the boy 
of fourteen to sixteen just entered upon his high-school course. 
One adds Physiology, ten add United States History, one Civil Govern- 
ment and United States History, one requires the grade of graduation from 
a high school. Total of 35 replies. This summary does not include the 
city training school. All of these making reply, require a high-school 
course as preliminary. 
Question 3.—The replies to this question indicate a material gain in the 
attention given to the study of professional subjects. 33 schools average 13 
weeks to the History of Education. 27 schools average 153 weeks to Science 
of Education. 30 schools average 31} weeks to Methods in Elementary 
Branches. 33 schools average 204 weeks to Mental Science. 23 schools 
average 144 weeks to School Economy. 3 report the subject without division. 
Question 4.—35 schools report model schools with from 2 to 10 grades ; 
the average number of grades being 7. 4 report having no model schools. 
Question 5.—33 schools have practice-teaching in model schools, and in 
all cases under the limitations suggested in the question; 3 have no such 
practice-teaching. 
Question 6.—32 schools have the students “observe.” Several speak of 
the doubtful utility of the work, but say that under their present conditions 
they can do no better. The answers suggest frequently the little value the 
unskilled workman may derive from merely being present where skilled 
work is done, unless such observer have the preliminary training in theory 
necessary to enable him to know what to look for, and to recognize it when 
he sees it. 
Question 7.—30 schools make reply. The time given to practice-teach- 
ing varies from 15 to 500 periods, though the large majority are much nearer 
the average time of 131 periods. 
Question 8.—20 schools state a definite number of periods required in 
observation, extending from 10 to 150, with 503 as the average; 5 say “An 
indefinite number.”
-P-A-G-E-576
  576 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ‘ASSOCIATION. 
  
QuEstIon 9.—30 schools make practice a daily exercise during the time 
the pupil-teacher is engaged in it; 3 do not. 
Question 10.—15 schools require the same amount of practice-teaching 
from all who graduate; 7 do not. Several reply in substance, that the 
“teaching ability” of the neophyte determines the length of his appren- 
ticeship. 
Question 11.—With the exception of 2 schools, all report the course in 
professional subjects only partially completed before the student is set at 
practice; in most cases the preparation being an elementary course in Men- 
tal Science, School Economy and Methods. A number of answers. indicate 
a conviction that the practice-teaching ought to come as late in the course 
as possible. Some say,“ We are obliged to begin it early in order to get our 
classes through it.” The practical limitations arising from the lack of facil- 
ities seem in many cases to modify what is regarded as the best plan. His- 
tory and Science of Education generally come late in the course of study. 
Question 12.—28 schools say “ Yes” to this question, though with fre- 
quent remark, “We cannot do otherwise.” The average number of recita- 
tions in which the practice-teacher is a pupil is 8}. 4 schools reply, “No.” 
There is evident from the replies a belief current that a man or woman 
cannot do the best work as a teacher while he himself holds the attitude of 
a pupil. It, in a large measure, disqualifies him to exercise that individual 
freedom of judgment and self-responsibility in choice which is necessary to 
the actual teacher a hundred times a day. In my judgment, this is a point 
of considerable importance in its bearing upon the work of practice and 
criticism. ; 
Question 14.—13 schools answer, “No;” 20 schools answer, “ Yes.” It is 
evident from these replies that the idea of teaching one’s classmates, who 
for the time being assume not to know what the teacher tries to impart, has 
a pretty firm foothold in our State schools. It would be an interesting ques- 
tion for this body to discuss. For my own part I cannot see any other jus- 
tification but the absence of those conditions in which actual teaching could 
be done. Where there is no model school, perhaps this sort of practice is 
better than nothing; but from several years’ trial and observation of it, I 
am led to conclude that it is of little value. 
Question 15.—Nearly every reply was, “No definite number,” “ Usually 
a few only.” Several said, “Enough to give a little practice in questioning, 
the conduct of a recitation, and some analytical power in preparing a lesson 
for teaching.” 
Questions 17 anp 18.—The replies to these questions are a study. The 
17th calls for a statement of what the distinguishing marks of a teacher are ; 
the 18th for a method of testing the teaching power as evidenced in the 
capacity of insight into the work under observation. In the replies to the 
17th not less than fifty separate points are mentioned. One answers “every- 
thing.” The characteristics of teacher and teaching most frequently noted
-P-A-G-E-577

are: Preparation of lesson by the teacher; energy; personal habits; power 
to gain the love and respect of pupils; ability to control; questioning; 
teaching power; and ability to awaken and direct mental growth.

Nore.—Figures refer to “Points of Criticism in Teaching,” to which constant reference should be 
made; some of the important points are suggested in italic. 
The points upon the blank called the “Critic’s Report,” used in the State 
Normal School at Buffalo, New York, are: Knowledge of Subject; Prepa- 
ration of Lesson; Power to Hold Attention; Power to Control; Power to 
Gain Respect of Pupils; Power to Secure Study; Aptness in Questioning; 
Punctuality; Energy; Thoroughness; Neatness of Work; Neatness of Per- 
sonal Appearance; Use of Language; Self-Possession and Ease of Manner; 
Average. 
The usual method of getting at the results called for in question 18, to 
which there are almost no exceptions in those schools reporting “observa- 
tion” as a required study, is to send the student into a room where teaching 
is being done, with the instruction to note what he sees, and report at a 
later critique under the direction of the superintendent of the training de-

partment or some critic-teacher. In some schools a list of the points upon 
which the report is to be made is previously given to the student. One 
school reports that the student is required to observe some one child, or 
one phase of the teacher’s work, at a time, thus gaining in concentration. 
The reply comes often: “The work very unsatisfactory.” One able and 
experienced worker says: “We have tried various plans, and find none giv- 
ing satisfactory results.” The blanks used in the Kansas, and San José, 
California, schools cover all the ground of the answers given. They are as

VI. Generau.— Comments. Questions. 
Principles of Instruction: 
1. Know thoroughly whatever you attempt to teach, so that you are not dependent 
upon notes or text-book. 
2. Use language that your pupils can fully understand, carefully explaining new 
or difficult terms. 
8. Excite the self-activity of the pupils, and never do for them what they can do 
for themselves. 
4, Begin with what is already known, and proceed to the unknown by easy, nat- 
ural steps. 
5. Let every lesson have a definite point. 
6. Do not try to teach too much; it is better to teach a little and teach it well. 
7. As far as possible, make the work objective. . 
8. Thoroughly test the pupils on their preparation of the lesson assigned for 
study. 
9. Require the pupils to state, in their own language, the facts taught them. 
10. Review carefully, thoroughly, and frequently. 
The utility of special training for teaching is sometimes called in question. 
The replies to 17 and 18 indicate clearly an abiding faith in the process 
upon the part of those who are best acquainted with it. They also suggest 
the element of weakness in any normal school or chair of pedagogy which 
has not the facilities for supplementing theory with practice. If I were to 
add my reply to these inquiries, I would put it thus: 
TRAINING. 
1, Faith must be shown in works. Practice is necessary to the teacher. 
2. Although the class in training exhibit a great variety and contrariety of indi- 
vidual faults, yet the general trend of the student’s progress may be pointed out. 
First Stace.—The Unhappy Penitent. 
There is a belief that, like original sin, lies deep down in the heart of every one 
who does not know how to teach. This belief is gloried in by the confirmed sinner 
who has taught that way for years, but carefully hidden and denied by the young 
novice fresh from methods and educational works, and with educational cant upon 
his lips. This belief —that the giving of many facts to pupils makes them wise — 
disappears in the first stage of training, the sinner being led to see the error of his 
ways by the investigation of the results of his crimes in the way of such teaching.
-P-A-G-E-580

He is now an unhappy penitent, convicted of sin but not seeing the way to salva- 
tion. j 
Sxconp Srace.—Conversion. 
At last the tendency develops to seek the idea in the mind of the pupil as the 
basis of all that is to be done. Here is a glimpse of a better life, with no very sure 
command of the means of reaching it. 
Tuirp Srace.—Right Living. 
Finally, experience ripens. The teacher learns to do right easily. He learns to 
use skillfully the means within his reach. He becomes righteous—a man who can 
teach rightly. 
Notes: (1) General criticisms are often revival meetings. (2) Too sudden con- 
versions are not reliable. There is liable to be a falling from grace soon after 
graduation. Some who are at first skeptical and hard to convince, make the best 
teachers in the end. 
Question 19.—This question is probably ambiguous. The answers are: 
5 schools would teach the science of education before practice-teaching is 
begun; 3 after; 28 in connection with, many evidently implying that the 
principles of the science are often learned while the student is practicing. 
The intent of the question was to obtain a judgment upon a much-discussed 
point whether an art and a science—that is, skill and understanding in a 
subject — may be best acquired together, or if not, in what order. It seems 
to me that the correct reply to that question is not far to seek, and that our 
practice department ought to give some valuable data in determining it. 
On the second part of question 19, there is some variation in the replies, 
but a large majority would place mental science first, methods second, and 
history of education and science of education last. Psychology is generally 
recognized as the ground of all educational practice; a point every school 
seems to take for granted. This implies a great gain in normal-school work, 
as it rationalizes and “orients” the course of study. 
Question 20.—31 schools reply, “One year;” 
years.” 
Question 21.—The replies to this are very suggestive. The first part 
of the question calls for a distinction between the work of a learner and a 
scholar. Can a mind, while engaged in the first process of acquisition, get 
a teacher’s view of a subject? Does a teacher’s view differ from his pupil’s 
in degree only, or is it different in kind? If it differs in degree only, I see 
no place upon which to rest our feet in our search after “special training 
for teaching.’ To obtain an expression of opinion upon this question, the 
inquiry was made. The bearing it has upon the relation of academic to 
pedagogical work in their time relations is evident without comment. Twenty- 
eight schools say “No.” One says, “The two processes are impossible ;” 
another says, “ Never;” another, “ Yes, with many qualifications ;”’ another, 
“Yes, if the student have sufficient age, ability, and maturity;” another, 
“Difficult, but possible;” another, “Not fully;” another, “ Not satisfacto- 
_ vily;” another, “To some extent.” But two answered “ Yes.” 
To the second part of the question the answers were so various as to make 6 schools reply, “Two

any generalization impossible; doubtless due in many cases to a feeling that 
there was not room to answer so large an inquiry in such small space. Every 
answer given is worthy of study. They all suggest the difficulty of reducing 
such general terms as character, life, training, to the formula of a definition. 
Still, for the purpose of progress it often becomes necessary to crystallize 
thought that it may be built into the foundation of the rising superstructure. 
Men in other callings, many included in our own, to say nothing of the av- 
erage legislator, often turn to us with the questions, “ What differentiates the 
teacher from the man of any other calling?” “Just what quality or quali- 
ties does the normal school impart that the average high school or college 
does not give?” As said before, if it is a difference in degree only, then the 
normal school is better than a high school as a place to prepare teachers just 
in proportion as it does better academic work. I can quote but a ‘few of the 
replies: 
A teacher’s knowledge of asubject is: (1) A thorough knowledge of subject-mat- 
ter. (2) A knowledge of the natural order of development of the subject in the 
pupil’s mind. (8) Such a knowledge of the mode of adapting the subject to the 
mind of the pupil in the various periods of mental evolution as will lead to success. 
—Principal OC. C. Rounds. 
A teacher’s knowledge of a subject includes besides the fact, an understanding of 
the pedagogical value of the subject, its position in the whole line of development 
of the child, its effect mentally and morally.—Dr. E. E. Sheib. 
Thorough acquaintance with its details, close insight into the logical sequence of 
its topics, and a philosophical method of presentation.—M. B. Sill. 
So much knowledge, training and common-sense that he can stimulate and guide 
the student, instead of lifting him, through a subject.—Ira More. 
A teacher must be able to grasp a subject as a whole; to analyze it into its parts; 
to distinguish between the essential, the important, and the non-essential, as laid 
down in text-books; and to present the different parts (1) in the order of teaching, 
i.e., the easiest for the pupil to follow; (2) in the order of logic, which is the easiest 
for him to retain.—M. A. Newell. 
One knows a subject from the teaching point of view when he sees all the ideas of 
the subject in relation to the central principle of the subject; when he sees the rela- 
tion of the subject and its constituent ideas to the mind to be taught, and is able to 
determine the best adjustment of each idea to the learning mind.—W. W. Parsons. 
In my opinion, there are three phases of knowledge: (1) the practical, or bread- 
and-butter; (2) the culture; and (3) the teaching phase. The first consists of such 
parts of knowledge as meet daily needs; the second must add a knowledge of the re- 
lation of these parts to each other, and to other subjects of thought. The “teaching 
point of view” must add to both these a knowledge of their relation to the develop- 
ment of the mind. This knowledge of the subjects of study in their relations, both 
internal and external, can be acquired only partially and with difficulty while one is 
learning elementary facts.—Ellen Hyde. 
It is my own belief that the pedagogical knowledge of a subject consists 
in the ability to recognize and define its facts and relations as data in con- 
sciousness; to classify knowledge as elements of mental science. 
Question 22.—The replies to this question are significant of the concep- 
tion of the true order of studies in a course of instruction in normal schools. 
37—N. EB. A.
-P-A-G-E-582
  582 THE.NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  
27 schools say “after;” 3 schools say “with;” 5 schools say “before;” 2 
schools say, “ We have to place them before and with, but they should come 
after.” 
Question 23.—34 answer that provision should be made for both classes; 
2 think that the courses of study had better be defined with a view of reach- 
ing the better educated classes. Several express the opinion that the latter 
plan would be theoretically the better, but that under present conditions it 
is impracticable. 
Question 24.—The replies to this are not always complimentary to those 
in the vocation. Several say we are too opinionated to confer together over 
a course of study for normal schools. One man even ventures a reference 
to a conference of “cranks,” but he must have had in his mind’s eye some 
other department of the National Association. However, 29 schools say 
“Yes,” 15 “Doubtful,” and a few “No.” 
Question 25.—No changes of a material nature were suggested in this 
question where it was understood. All that the question asked for was a 
division of the subjects in the courses of study into academic and profes- 
sional. No reference was had to any chronological or logical sequence. 
Two schools replied that all subjects taught in a normal school are profes- 
sional. But the almost unanimous judgment seemed to indicate a recognition 
of a distinction between academic and professional or pedagogical work. A. 
clear distinction upon this point would do much to define the true sphere of 
the normal school. 
Question 26.—41 schools gave an average of 211 years as the age of the 
graduating class. This result is not far from the age in the majority of 
schools. | 
Question 27.—This question is ambiguous. In those schools which 
seemed to understand it alike, 18 in number, the answers average 20 per 
cent. In addition to these, city training schools give an average of 95 per 
cent., though in these schools the enrollment is sometimes as low as 6 pupils. 
The question was so framed as to exclude from the count any students taking 
a merely academic course, or a commercial course, or any other course but 
that having teaching in view as an end, and was meant to include the en- 
rollment in this course for all the years, not merely for the class in methods 
and practice. 
Question 28.—Including city training schools the answers average 19} 
per cent.; not including these, very nearly 26 per cent. This result is some- 
what of a surprise, as I had supposed the per cent. of the young men in the 
normal schools of the country to be less. A few schools report a very low 
per cent.; indeed, one reported no young men in the classes. The city train- 
ing schools generally seem to be devoting themselves to young women. 
Question 29.—Eighteen schools give numerical replies. These average 
6% years. In almost every answer the remark is made, “Up to date many are 
still teaching.” Evidently the true average has not been reached by any
-P-A-G-E-583
  
. METHODS AND COURSES IN NORMAL SCHOOLS. 583 
  
” school. One says, “10 years for 13 classes;” another, “More than 10 years ;” 
another, “52 to 60 per cent. of the possible time;” another, “89 per cent. 
of the last 8 classes, except those married and deceased, are still teaching.” 
Since the average age to-day of 45 schools,,measured from the date of the 
graduation of the first class, is only 14} years, these facts ought to forever 
settle the cavil, that “the graduates of normal schools do not teach.” 
Question 31.—The average enrollment in the pedagogical course for 43 
schools is 237. Omitting 12 schools, reporting less than a hundred each, 
the average for the remainder, 31 schools, is 314, a total of nearly 10,000 
students, or, at a rough estimate, one-third of one per cent. of the total num- 
ber of public-school teachers in the country. 
Question 32.—Not including city schools, the average proportion of high- 
school and college graduates, though I take it as meaning high-school 
graduates only, is for 28 schools 12? per cent. One State school reports 80 
per cent., two 50 per cent. The city training schools generally say, “100 per 
cent.” 
The reports from the city training schools deserve special notice in respect 
to a few of the points called for in the questions. The average time given 
to the history of education runs as low as 64 weeks; to the science of edu- 
cation, 8} weeks; methods, 233 weeks; mental science, 103 weeks; and 
school economy, 2 weeks. In most of those making reply, practice-teach- 
ing is begun very early in the course; 4 say that no instruction in peda- 
gogical branches precedes the work of practice. The average time given 
to practice is 151 periods; to observation, 71. A considerable part of the 
practice work is “substituting,” that is, filling a temporary vacancy in the 
regular corps of teachers in the city. The plan of teaching classmates under 
the limitation of question 14 seems to be common, 6 of the 8 schools reply- 
ing “Yes” to the question. 
I was impressed with the small amount of pedagogical instruction aside 
from the work of methods and practice. It would seem that the city train- 
ing school is not doing what its apparent opportunities would warrant in 
emphasizing a broad pedagogical training for the teacher. The inquiry 
starts the question, What is the real purpose of a city training school? 
The regular State schools are certainly giving a much broader course in 
pedagogy than the average of the city training schools. 
In closing this report, I want to mention a few facts borne in upon my 
mind during the past three years. 
First: It is to be noted that in a few schools the annual circulars, setting 
forth the claims and advantages of the schools, have the stamp, the individ- 
uality of a training school’ for teachers; but in many cases the announce- | 
ments made might.as well represent any academic institution of equal grade. 
This fact is less conspicuous in the references to pedagogical work, which 
are at times profusely plentiful, than in the outlines and analytical sum- 
maries of subjects. A declaration on one page that all subjects are profes-

sional, and on another the same list of topics, presented in essentially the 
same order, under the same conditions as in any academic school, do not 
help the would-be teacher to answer the question, Why go to a normal 
school ? 
Second: It appears that the normal schools are realizing the fact “that 
they are at work upon the problem of education, while the academic schools 
are at work upon the process of educating. 
Third: A decided advance in the conception of what the sphere of peda- 
gogical training really is. The subjects and means of study are defined 
with some considerable approach to emphasis; but a lack of unity in the 
conviction that normal schools have any higher function than the prepara- 
tion of teachers for the lower grades is quite apparent. Perhaps time is 
the best solvent. The proper tests to determine, not alone that knowledge 
is before the examiner, but that the teacher is there, must develop as the 
sphere of pedagogy is more and more clearly defined. One of the clearest 
statements of the scope and function of the normal school as a place of . 
training for teaching, I quote from the catalogue of the Indiana State Nor- 
mal School, at Terra Haute, for 1887-8. It is as follows: 
“The normal school is not a school for general culture for its own sake. It is a 
professional school. Its central idea is to confer that knowledge which constitutes 
the science of education, and to train students in the art of instruction and school 
management. Its leading aim is to give that knowledge and training which belong 
as distinctly to the teacher as does the science of medicine to the physician, or the 
science of law to the legal practitioner. A school is a normal school only when it 
makes these its controlling ends. } 
“By what means does it seek to give this preparation? The answer may be made 
as follows: 
“T. It seeks to lead the pupil to acquire a thorough, scientific knowledge of the 
branches he is to teach. This knowledge is the prime condition of any success in 
the school-room. The teacher’s instruction in a given subject can never rise above 
his own knowledge of that subject. No knowledge of methods of instruction how- 
ever excellent in themselves, no fund of general information however accurate and 
extensive, can be substituted for the specific and thorough knowledge of the subjects 
which the individual is required to teach. He must at least know these. General 
culture and information will greatly augment the teaching power of one already 
possessing the requisite knowledge of what is to be taught, as will also correct 
methods of instruction; but these are auxiliaries to, not substitutes for, a definite 
understanding of the matter of instruction. The teacher must himself know what 
the pupil is expected to acquire under his tuition. His mastery of these subjects 
must be thorough and complete. Other things equal, he is the best teacher of a 
subject who has the most thorough and complete knowledge of it. Not only must 
the teacher be conversant with the facts of the various branches he teaches, but he 
must know these in their logical connections. It is only thus that they form a sub- 
ject of study. The facts of arithmetic, for example, constitute the science of arith- 
metic only when viewed in the necessary relations that exist among the facts 
themselves. . Knowledge proper is to be distinguished from mere information. The 
latter is the knowledge of facts as facts, i.e., in their isolation; the former is the 
comprehension of facts in their organic connections. Information is not education.
-P-A-G-E-585
  METHODS AND COURSES IN NORMAL SCHOOLS. 585 
A mass of information systematized by thinking it under the relations which inhere 
among the facts and principles themselves, becomes knowledge, and as such has 
great educational value. The instruction in the various branches of study in the 
common schools must result in this latter form of knowledge. This alone confers 
real power upon the pupil. Many persons, under the usual tests, show a fair degree 
of familiarity with the'subject-matter of this or that branch of learning; but when 
required to think the subject as a system, independent of a text-book treating it, 
they are found to possess no adequate, coherent knowledge of it. It is a necessary 
part of a teacher’s knowledge that he shall have thought the facts of the various 
subjects of instruction into a coherent and systematic whole. While such a knowl- 
edge as this is the only true one for any educational purpose, it is preéminently the 
teacher’s view. Nothing less than this orderly knowledge of the subject will suffice 
for the teacher. As the primary requirement, then, the normal school seeks to 
ground its students thoroughly in the knowledge of the branches required to be 
taught in the common schools of the State. 
“TI, As a second element of a teacher’s preparation for the work of the school- 
room, the normal school endeavors to give its students a knowledge of the nature, 
processes, laws and products of the human mind. Mind is the subject of the edu- 
cating process. The teacher is in the presence of from thirty-five to fifty children 
from five to six hours per day. It is his function as teacher to train and develop 
each of these individual minds; to strengthen them in every correct power and 
habit of thought; to purify and chasten their feelings, and to present such motives 
as will tend to the discarding all bad habits of body and mind, and to the formation 
of good ones. To train a faculty or power of the mind, it must be exercised upon 
its proper object, and in accordance with the laws of its nature. Exercise is the 
condition of mental growth. But mental activity without the guidance of a rational 
end, and not in obedience to the proper laws of the faculty exercised, may produce 
a distorted and abnormal growth. 
“The human mind in its natural and leading forms of activity, with their condi- 
tion, laws, and product, bears a relation to the art of teaching similar to that of the 
bodily nature and functions to the physician’s art. For the teacher to attempt to 
pursue his art, with all its complicated and responsible duties, without a clear knowl- 
edge of the processes and laws of mind, is hardly less irrational than would be the 
practice of medicine without an adequate knowledge of the principal organs of the 
body and their laws and functions. 
“Moreover, the teacher’s methods of instruction, if based upon reasons or prin- 
ciples, and not derived from mere authority and experiment, must spring largely 
from the study of mind. The mind is to be educated. The instruments of the 
process are the various subjects of study. These two, then—mind, and matter of 
study —must be the main factors in a rational or scientific method of instruction. 
In this thought, the study of mind in all its manifestations occupies a prominent 
place in the course of study in the normal school. The effort is made to study 
mind itself, in its conditions, activities, laws, and results. Too often the study of 
mental science is made the mere learning of text, without verification by appeal to 
individual and personal mental experience. The true method of pursuing this sub- » 
ject is by introspection, using the text mainly as a guide. For the teacher’s pur- 
pose, it must be chiefly a direct study of mind. It is only in this way that the study 
of mental science can become an efficient aid to the teacher. 
“Tt must ever be admitted and emphasized, that knowledge of the subject is of 
the first importance to whoever would teach the subject. The teacher must know 
that which he is to teach. Nevertheless, it is probably true that more failures in the 
school-room are due to ignorance of child-nature than to any other cause. The  
-P-A-G-E-586
  586 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  
| chief weakness in the public schools to-day is on the side of mind, not ignorance of 
subjects. Knowledge of motives, conditions, processes, and laws of mind-activity, 
is the key to scientific instruction; and it is not held by the majority of teachers. 
“TTI. But the teacher’s preparation must include more than the knowledge of the 
branches to be taught, and the nature and operations of mind. It is all-important 
that the teacher have clear and correct ideas as to the true ends of the educating 
process. His theory of education, i. e., his views concerning the main results to be 
accompanied by the process, will go far toward determining the spirit and methpds 
of the school in all its work. If the teacher regards the informing of the mind as 
the chief work, this view will manifest itself in all he does. If to him the prevail- 
ing aim of the school is to lead the pupil to acquire a large fund of systematic 
knowledge, receiving such training of the intellectual faculties as the acquisition of 
this incidentally and necessarily gives, this theory will, in a great degree, determine 
the character of the work done in the school.. If the teacher holds information and 
systematized knowledge, valuable and important as they are, to be necessary means 
only, and the quickening and unfolding of all the intellectual, moral and spiritual 
facfilties to be the abiding aims of the school, the instruction given and the dis- 
cipline administered will look to this end. The normal school holds that character 
and power are above learning. While in nowise under-estimating or depreciating 
the value of knowledge, it yet teaches that the ultimate outcome of all school-work 
must be the individual with trained powers of intellect, acute moral perceptions and 
sentiments, a will trained in the habit of obedience to the right, and a rovereniad 
spirit. The man or woman grounded and trained in every natural capacity must 
be the aim of the school. The correct theory of the school is sought to be imparted 
by a study of the training schools in their actual work, by an extended study of the 
history and science of education, and by the method of performing the daily class- 
work in all the departments. 
“TV. If in a fair degree fitted by natural aptitude for the work of instructing and 
managing aschool,a person trained in a thorough knowledge of the subject he is to 
teach, possessing a theoretical knowledge of mental activities and laws, and ecousa 
in a correct theory of education, will ultimately succeed in the school-room. The 
problem now is, how to reduce the period of actual experiment to the minimum: 
The person who has made the threefold preparation indicated, is prepared 4 two 
phases of work which should precede his taking charge of a school, namely: (1) the 
study of methods of instruction; and (2) a period of actual practice, under compe- 
tent direction, in instructing and governing schools. To these two lines of work 
the normal school gives great prominence. It has a department of methods and a 
system of training or practice schools. Both of these are under the supervision 
and direction of the teacher of methods. In the first, sufficient instruction is given 
to enable the student to employ his knowledge of the subject and of mind in de- 
termining a rational method of procedure for teaching the subject. Special atten- 
tion is given to methods of primary instruction, since in the lower grades the 
foundations of knowledge are laid, and the immature mind has less power to seize 
and assimilate knowledge not skillfully presented. The schools for observation and 
practice include all grades below the high school. They are in charge of competent 
critic-teachers, and the instruction given in them is in harmony with the theories of 
education taught in the normal school. Students are required to observe and in- 
terpret the work of the practice schools during the time they are receiving instruc- 
tion in methods, and in the later stages of the course of instruction they are 
required to spend a considerable period in actual teaching in each of these schools, 
under the criticism of both the regular critic-teacher and the teacher of methods.

“They are thus enabled to leave the school possessing a fair degree of skill in the 
instruction and management of classes, attained by actual experience. 
“The State Normal School, then, undertakes to fulfill the purpose of its organiza- 
tion by (1) leading the student to acquire a thorough knowledge of the branches 
required to be taught, the professional aspects of the subject receiving attention 
during this study; (2) giving a comprehensive knowledge of mind; (8) the study of 
the history and science of education; and (4) a system of instruction in methods, 
and an extended period of observation and actual teaching in the training schools 
connected with the institution.” 
I wish to thank the Normal Section of the National Educational Associ- 
ation for the opportunity to prosecute this work under its authority. I can 
only say that this report is an attempt to continue, not to complete, the great 
work so auspiciously begun three years ago by President Taylor. Much 
yet remains to be done before sufficient data are at hand for any extended 
generalizations. 
All of which is respectfully submitted.

DISCUSSION * 
  James H. Hooss, of New York: I think we have never had so valuable 
a paper presented to this section. Here we have food for thought, refresh- 
ing and. delightful. This instructive report shows vigorous progress in 
normal work along several important lines. It helps us to differentiate 
normal instruction from that of all other schools. This is important when 
we consider the errors and frauds committed under pretense of normal 
methods. Asa fraternity, it helps us to realize our high aims and purposes. 
It stimulates a good opinion of ourselves, which I, for one, approve. I wish 
we were all opinionated intensely, but not self-conceited. From this report 
we see, moreover, that normal schools are pursuing their legitimate course 
with great profit; and this suggests the propriety of opening up special 
fields of investigation. Let us take one of these fields for special work next 
year, another for the following year, etc. Good results will be sure to follow. 
R. C. Norton, of Missouri: I certainly approve of this report, and in- 
dorse the many compliments it has received. Many colleges have normal 
departments which are completely overshadowed by the many little preten- 
tious normal schools springing up everywhere, conducted by still more pre- 
tentious, but less informed, teachers. 
8. 8. Parr, of Minnesota: I think we need a definition of normal-school 
work. It is a grand work, a peculiar work—a work which I believe can-

not be furnished by chairs of didactics, or by petty normal departments 
attached to other schools. | 
Axserr Saxispury, of Wisconsin: I simply rise to ask if there has been 
any real pedagogical investigations outside of normal schools proper? 
JERoME ALLEN, of New York: Is it necessary to study psychology in 
order to learn the principles of pedagogy ? | 
T. J. Gray, of Minnesota: The work. of the Committee has revealed a 
great weakness in the normal schools in the lack of any true metaphysics 
underneath their work in psychology. With no substantial foundation in 
a correct philosophy, they are finding any rational development of the course 
in pedagogy impossible. The fact that in a majority of schools “Sully’s 
Psychology” is used, confirms this view—a book incapable of making even 
educational veal. What is needed is a metaphysic based upon the Platonic 
Kantian system of thought. | 
NORMAL-SCHOOL WORK AMONG THE COLORED geet: 
A. J. STEELE, MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE. 
a 
The question which I am here to discuss was originally assigned to Prin- 
cipal B. T. Washington, of the Tuskegee Normal School, Alabama. On 
account of domestic bereavement and ill-health very late in the season, I 
understand, Mr. Washington found that he could not perform the task as- 
signed him, and so notified the President of this Department. 
On the 5th of the present month, at the earnest solicitation of those in- 
terested in this department, and in this particular discussion, I consented, 
in a moment of indiscretion, to undertake the presentation of this important 
topic. Under these circumstances, it is with no slight feeling of reluctance 
that I have set out upon the discharge of this duty, with so little time at 
my command, and with no opportunity to gather the evidence cola! to 
my purpose. 
As was originally planned, it would have been more fitting that this paper 
should ,have been presented by a colored man, who should speak from his 
more intimate knowledge of his own race—their situation, aspirations, and 
needs —with a degree and kind of assurance and authority that I cannot 
claim. My own excuse or motive for attempting the treatment of this sub- 
ject in this presence, must be my anxiety to have discussed here one of the 
interests of an important cause—a cause that has for the past quarter of a 
century enlisted the sympathy and the codperation of the benevolent and 
philanthropic of our entire land, and with which it has been my happiness 
and honor to be connected for the past twenty years. I would fain hope

that our discussion to-day may in the future bear fruit in the stimulation 
and encouragement of a wise and successful system of professional training 
for those who are in the immediate future to be the teachers ‘of the colored 
race in this country, and mayhap, to some extent, of the greater body of 
that race in the Dark Continent. So far as I know, the history of educa- 
tion —or of the world, for that matter—does not anywhere present a ques- 
tion so remarkable, or a situation so fraught with consequences of good or 
ill to mankind, as is found in the great question of the education and train- 
ing of the colored people of the United States. The phase of that question 
to which I particularly invite your attention is a most vital one, namely, 
the training of the teachers of that race. 
Rey. Dr. Haygood, in his comprehensive and excellent article on “The 
South and the School Problem,” in the July number of Harper’s Monthly, 
tells us in so many words, “Of true normal-school work there has not been 
much in the South outside the splendid work done in the best of the higher 
institutions for the negro.’ And again: That in these same institutions, 
while perhaps “five out of the hundred were pursuing the higher branches 
of the college course, the ninety-five in every hundred were learning just 
what they should have been learning —they were fitting themselves to be 
intelligent men and women, and to teach in the public schools for their 
people.” Taken separately and in their proper connections in the article 
in question, these statements give no wrong impression; but taken out of 
their connection and placed side by side, as I have purposely done, they 
would lead us to the conclusion that a large amount of true normal-school 
work had been done for the colored people in the South— which is not the 
case, any more than it is the impression that Dr. Haygood would convey. 
On the contrary, the writer might truthfully have said, “Of true normal- 
school work, tried by any correct standard, there has not been much in the 
South,” dropping the modifying clause, that is liable to mislead. The pupils 
in the schools referred to have doubtless been well taught in the branches 
usually included in a fair English course of study; and this process has re- 
quired all their time and energy, as well as that of their teachers. 
Thus far in the normal work undertaken for the colored student, it is my 
experience that there is found but little time for anything but the tolerably 
fair mastery of the academic studies of the normal course, to say nothing 
of special professional training or true practice-work. The very necessities 
of our work limit us in this direction. These limitations are broadening 
from year to year; and it may be truthfully said, wherever normal-school 
work has been attempted, similar limitations from somewhat similar causes 
have had to be overcome by patient labor —as I am confident they will be 
overcome in the colored normal schools. 
According to statistics as given in the report of the Commissioner of Edu- 
cation for 1886-7, there exists a colored school population of 2,222,611, 
with 1,118,556 of this number actually enrolled and in school attendance,
-P-A-G-E-590

* | | 
| taught by 15,815 teachers. The same report for 1883-4, which gives the 
latest official figures that I can find on the subject, gives the number of ¢ol- 
ored normal schools as 56, with an enrollment of upwards of ten thousand 
pupils. Dr. Haygood, whom I have already quoted, tells us that there are 
in the South, in 1889, 150 schools able to prepare colored men and at 
to teach in the common schools. 
As has been intimated, to call these schools in any true sense normal 
schools, would be something like a libel on normal-school methods. In 
many cases their chief ambition is to do secondary or real college ones 
and, on the other hand, to do grammar or even primary-school work, ab- 
sorbs all their time and strength, leaving but slight margin or opportunity 
for really proper normal training, even if the other conditions of the situa- 
tion admitted of such work. 
In this state of the case we may, in our limited time for this discussion, 
dismiss with a word any consideration of what has been done, up to the 
present time, in the way of the special normal training of teachers for the col- 
ored schools. In doing this I would not be understood as speaking nee 
ingly of the great educational work that has been done for the colored 
people in the excellent schools established by benevolent societies and by 
the States themselves. All of the vast and beneficent work that has been 
‘so happily accomplished has come through these agencies, and it is Le 
tice that to these schools be given most of the credit for the steady advance- 
ment that is being made in the quality of work done in the colored schools. 
I cheerfully give the evidence on this point gathered by Dr. Haygood 
through the 300 letters of inquiry, addressed by him to as many different 
persons in positions to judge of the conditions and progress of the colored 
people. In case of every answer received where comment was made ide 
cause for improvement in colored schools, it was attributed to the better 
teachers furnished by the colleges and other training schools. Without 
doubt they have constituted the great source of power and energy, as it were, 
that have kept the machinery of the common schools in accelerated motion 
up to the present time. | 
It is no part of my task on this platform, to argue the general question 
of the value or desirability of normal training. Happily that constitutes 
one of the settled questions in the minds of educators generally, and in 
most countries special normal instruction is provided in proportion to the 
state of progress and efficiency of the schools. 
There are, however, special reasons in the peculiar circumstances, ante- 
cedents and situation of the colored people at the South, that furnish abun- 
dant food for thought and the excuse for this discussion. 
A careful study of this situation must constitute the preliminary to any 
reasonable forecast of the future, or to the adoption of. plans of work for 
which there shall be any hope of success or permanence. 
Reference has been made to the difficulties that are usually met in the

  ‘NORMAL-SCHOOL WORK AMONG THE COLORED PEOPLE. 591 
  
establishment and upbuilding of normal methods of instruction anywhere 
it is undertaken. In the colored schools of the South these difficulties are 
much greater than are usually met with elsewhere. 
No one without experience in teaching those deprived of such benefits 
can realize how great is the momentum which centuries of intelligence and 
freedom give to the mind of the learner, or how unconscious is the acquisi- 
tion of the great bulk of knowledge which goes to make up the Caucasian 
mind of the nineteenth century. This momentum the colored student very 
generally lacks. He has by his school efforts not only to master the usual 
subjects, but he must also, as best he can, get along without that substratum 
of general intelligence which is to the majority of the free white students 
the natural inheritance, or the unconscious acquisition of observation and 
experience of life in the home, in society, and in the business circle, all of 
which are practically inaccessible to the colored learner, who usually comes 
to the school from communities and homes where his range of thought and 
experience is exceedingly limited. This could not well be otherwise with 
any race scarcely a generation removed from bondage, and since their free- 
dom excluded by custom and prejudice almost as completely as in the days 
of slavery from association with those of superior privileges and opportu- 
nities, by which, almost more than any other means, the horizon of thought 
and knowledge, and life itself, is widened. 
All this widening of outlook, the acquirement of the simplest elements of 
knowledge, the arousing of the dormant faculties of the mind—in a word, 
the providing the mind with ideas, the power with which to use them and 
the very vocabularies with which they are to be used, falls to the task of 
our schools for the colored people, as it must do in diminishing ratio for 
years to come. It is, to say the least, creditable alike to schools and people 
that under these and a thousand other adverse circumstances so much has 
been accomplished in the way of education and in the working out and estab- 
lishing of those means of education that give so much hope for the future. 
In view of the mental darkness that has been dispelled in these short years, 
we may well hope and plan largely for the future with increased admiration 
and reverence for the power and capacity of the human mind to clothe itself 
in the habiliments of enlightenment when impelled by a thirst for knowl- 
edge. Incidentally it may also teach us that the Creator has barred no 
race of the human family from attaining any excellence to which it may 
aspire. 
Leaving for the time the class of mind, its limitations and difficulties with 
which our question has to do, I would direct your attention to the environ- 
ment into which this work of normal instruction is to be transplanted, as it 
were, the atmosphere whence it must draw its support. 
When it is remembered that the professional training of teachers, as the 
work is understood in the most advanced schools of the country, is of but 
recent growth and none too thoroughly comprehended where most success-
-P-A-G-E-592

fully practiced, shall we wonder at the failure to appreciate its ey 
where two decades measure the life of the school system, and where King 
Solomon and the hickory rod are held up as embodying the highest author- 
ity for the school-room and the end of argument with the teacher. Any 
treatment less heroic than this is looked upon with distrust and suspicion, as 
weak and inefficient. 
Not long since, the mayor of a prominent city in the South, himself a 
prominent candidate for the office of governor, coming down from the bench 
of the morning police court where he had often to do with young offenders 
against the law, complained bitterly of the inefficiency of the school-training 
as at the bottom of the ill-doing of so many youngsters with whom*his oan 
had to do; and this on the ground that education had been made so easy and 
the muscular methods of its inculeation so neglected that little good could 
be expected from it, adding, by way of reminiscence, that when he kept 
school he generally saw to it that the scholars were all soundly licked by 
nine o’clock in the morning, while now teachers did not dare to thrash any- 
one. 
I venture at the present time the injunction most often given the teacher, 
in the colored schools at least, is, that “children must be whipped; they 
will not learn unless they are whipped.” And quite as generally it is the 
thing the children expect, and in many cases really think they must have. 
While all this shows the need of better methods which can only come through 
a more correct idea of mind-training, it also sets forth a state of public senti- 
ment that cannot be relied on to hasten forward any change. This is certainly 
true of the colored people, so little affected as they are as a body by the 
currents of educational thought and influence, and so likely as they are 
from their former training and from their condition and surroundings, to 
regard as trifling and unnecessary any special preparation not absolutely 
demanded for the work to be done. That all this can be changed by proper 
and persistent influence along certain well-chosen lines through the proper 
agencies, I do not doubt. 
I notice yet another serious difficulty in the way of the successful profes- 
sional instruction of colored teachers at the South. It lies in the great pre- 
ponderance of rural or country schools, which are of necessity of low grade, 
paying low wages, and offering but small inducement even to those to whom 
few other avenues of labor and influence are open. In New York or Wis- 
consin, both of which States may justly boast of the popularity and efficiency 
of their normal schools—take away the incentive to professional training 
furnished by the positions paying fair salaries in the city and village graded 
and high schools, and I venture that the normal schools would straightway 
languish for want of students in the advanced classes and professional work. 
In passing it may well be remarked that this excess of ungraded country 
schools, in which nearly all the colored children are to have their school 
training, may and doubtless does indicate an adaptation of normal training  
-P-A-G-E-593
  NORMAL-SCHOOL WORK AMONG THE COLORED PEOPLE. 593 
  
to suit the conditions of the schools in which the most of the work is to be 
done—with the hope of advancing the standard of the training as the con- 
ditions of the work make it practicable. 
Allow me to summarize: These untoward conditions and peculiar cir- 
cumstances to which I have tried to direct your attention, have up to the 
present time restrained and hampered in even the few schools where true 
normal-school work has been attempted, and whatever any particular insti- 
tution may claim to have accomplished, or faithfully have tried to do, I am 
quite certain that to no great extent has the spirit of true normal training 
obtained a foothold or an influence even in the best of the higher institu- 
tions for the negro to which Dr. Haygood refers. The constant absorbing 
aim of the college and so-called university is toward the higher educa- 
tion, the college idea; and with the normal schools, institutes, and high 
schools even, in the rare cases where there has been any just comprehension 
of true normal methods, the more pressing necessities of our work, other 
interests that have demanded our attention, and the generally untoward 
circumstances, have kept professional training in the back-ground. 
Thus much for the past and present condition of normal-school work 
among the colored people. What of the future? How shall the agencies 
be introduced or the influences be set in operation to remedy this state 
of things? Doubtless most of the conditions are yearly becoming more 
favorable to the prosecution of professional work in the colored schools. 
Dr. Haygood has told us that there are about 150 schools in the South able 
to prepare colored men and women for teachers. The question naturally 
rises with reference to these schools, whether “they have come to the king- 
dom for such a time as this, or are we to look for enlargement and deliver- 
ance from another source?” 
Shall the circle of schools that have already done so much for the colored 
people, that have done the pioneer work amid all these difficulties, now that 
some advancement has been made, some vantage-ground been gained —shall 
they, in view of future advances made imperative and certain by the past, 
be found unequal to future demands, and give place to other agencies better 
adapted to this work, and with other aims and predilections? 
‘Whoever may be destined to enter this door of opportunity, it is a great 
and inspiring one. To train the teacher is to shape the school and deter- 
mine its work very largely, and this means everything to a race that must 
look for so much from the public school as must the negro of this country. 
For one, I fully believe these schools are equal to the emergency. No 
such circle of schools has ever before existed in this land. They are abso- 
lutely unique in their position, influence, and control. They are worthy of 
study. They do not correspond to the academy of the Northern States, and 
they differ yet more from the private school or seminary of the South. They 
are not like the public school in any section, nor are they in any way or 
sense in competition, and much less in any antagonism to them, as is the
-P-A-G-E-594

case with the ordinary church or parish school of whatever denomination. 
They are in vital connection and closest sympathy with the common schools. 
They have thus far done most that has been done to furnish teachers for the 
colored schools, and there seems to be no reason why they may not take now 
a step in advance, and that step in the direction of special panies 
training for those who go from them, expecting to teach for a longer or 
shorter time. 
If it be objected that their control is in such hands, or that their choked 
work lies in such other and different directions that they may not reason- 
ably be looked to as likely to do true normal work, it may be replied that 
in the past five years these same schools have adapted themselves most ad- 
mirably to a system of industrial work and manual training, far more at 
variance with their principal aims and purposes than any normal work could 
be. They have done this so successfully under the supervision of Dr. Hay- 
good and the board of trustees of the John F. Slater Fund, as to-day to rep- 
resent one of the most thoroughly concrete and definite educational forces 
in this country. Give these schools the same definite purpose with reference 
to normal training, and the same sort of supervision, and doubt not the in- 
centive and the means will be at hand and operative for teacher-training, 
and this not only without detriment to any other legitimate object or inter- 
est of the schools, but with real assistance to every other department of their 
influence. 
In conclusion, speaking directly to the small army of teachers engaged in 
these schools providentially founded and sustained for the colored youth of 
the land, whatever may have been the aims and purposes of our work, 
or whether our only aim has been the general one, to do whatever good in 
whatever direction possible, is there not at this time in our history an oppor- 
tunity to advance to the occupation of this strategic point from which our 
strength and influence shall be felt in the most vital work of the thorough 
training of the teachers of the colored people? The State and county officials 
“are coming to see and feel the need of this, as we may plainly see in the ef- 
fort to sustain county and State institutes, and in the increasing disposition 
and willingness to provide for normal instruction at the expense of the State. 
From our vantage-ground, we may do much to determine the nature and 
thoroughness of this work; we may greatly advance and expedite, or we 
may mar and retard it. Which shall it be? | 
DISCUSSION. |   
ALBERT SALISBURY, WHITEWATER, WISCONSIN. 
It is a matter of regret that Prof. Washington was unable to pectoral the 
part allotted to him on this occasion. Aside from the value of his own ex- 
perience with the problem before us, it would have been of great pee to
-P-A-G-E-595

see how he, a representative colored man,‘ would have approached this 
topic; what phases of it have impressed themselves most deeply upon his 
attention, and what practical courses of action he is prepared to urge or 
suggest. But since we are denied this, a satisfactory compensation is found 
in the fact that his place has been filled by one who has had so long and 
fruitful a connection with normal-school work among the colored people. 
The lateness of his appointment to this task, however, enforces upon me 
a somewhat more independent treatment of the subject before us than would 
otherwise have been appropriate or desirable. 
The question of normal-school work among the colored people is not only 
a question of what has been, but also of what shall be. It is, moreover, 
only one element of the general problem of normal-school work for all the 
people. Especially in the consideration of ultimate aims it is to be main- 
tained, and never forgotten, that the negro is a man, neither less nor more. 
* The great laws of human nature lying at the bottom of all true pedagogy 
and all social science, are the same with him as with other men. There is 
no “colored” psychology or pedagogics. 
And yet no one can well deny that the negro has his psychological pecul- 
iarities, qualities incident to his present stage of race-development, and 
qualities resultant from his recent and present environment; and these must 
all be duly regarded in all that is done for him or with him. How, then, 
shall the American negro receive such a psychological and pedagogical 
study as he deserves? Who will make it? Who is qualified to do it? Cer- 
tainly not those who have no contact with him, and as certainly not those 
who have no consideration for him or faith in him. 
Looking back over the history of the past quarter-century, one can hardly 
resist the temptation to speculate as to what ideally should have been done 
with these freed people educationally. What an opportunity was here! 
Millions of children who had never been spoiled by false educational meth- 
ods —virgin soil, so to speak, for the educational reformer! What a field 
for the “new education”’— so little to be undone! Had we possessed at that 
juncture a few thousand Pestalozzis, what might not have been accomplished ! 
Whence were all the needed teachers to come? If all could have been 
foreseen and understood, what an achievement it would have been for our 
national government at once to have established a hundred well-equipped 
normal schools for the thorough, practical training of colored teachers. 
Ought not such a preparation, logically, to have been made for the great. 
expansion of primary instruction which was inevitably to ensue? But the 
nation could not see, and did not understand— does not yet understand, in 
fact, with all the light which the passing years have thrown. 
Again, what a consummation it would have been—what a prophylactic 
for many ills, if the Southern people could have seen their opportunity and 
have done what even they were able to meet the great emergency, and lead 
the way in the regeneration of their colored wards! What a master-key
-P-A-G-E-596
  596 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
they would then have held to the whole difficult situation! But that was 
not to be; it was practically impossible that it should be. 
It requires no supernatural insight to discover the reasons why the South 
did not undertake this task. They have often been set forth with more or 
less completeness. Poverty was the first reason. The white people, after 
the war, were scarcely able to provide an education for their own children. 
They did not believe the negro capable of education, nor deserving of it; 
and if it were to be given him, they felt no inclination nor obligation to the 
task. But what I wish to emphasize in this connection is the fact that the 
South at that time had no experience of or interest in pedagogical questions. 
It sent sons to college, it is true—to the best colleges; but it scarcely knew 
that such a thing as normal schools had an existence. Teaching was hardly 
counted as a reputable calling; and “methods,” as a pedagogical term, was 
blissfully unfamiliar. 
Under such conditions, whence was to come the help of the freedmen’s 
children? A million youth, dazed by their new-found liberty, looked more 
or less truly upon education as the secret of the white man’s power, but 
could not comprehend that education was more than a mere matter of school 
and school-books. Whence was to come the needed army of wise, patient, 
thorough instructors, able to cope with such a situation? Not all the money 
of the Freedmen’s Bureau could buy or find them. 
There was one grand resource, one fountain of supply which opened wide 
and has not yet wholly closed. Christian philanthropy, working through 
the church organizations of the North, sent forth a great corps of devoted 
teachers, inadequate in numbers, deficient in pedagogical training often; yet 
I do not hesitate to say in this presence that no more self-sacrificing, single- 
hearted, ill-paid, and sorely misunderstood army of workers ever walked 
before the Lord than these missionary teachers of the colored schools. I 
speak from close observation and direct personal acquaintance with them 
and their works in every Southern State. 
From the purely pedagogical point of view, this work has often been crude 
and uncritical, though often, also, it has been equal to the best that can any- 
where be found. It has been much modified by religious considerations, 
inseparable from the origin of the work and its support; and classical pre- 
possessions have often unduly and unfortunately interfered with more need- 
ful and practical forms of education. Yet the fact remains, and a most 
interesting and valuable fact it is, that chiefly through the Northern mis- 
sionary associations has the conception of normal schools, of the systematic 
and scientific preparation of teachers for their distinctive work, been brought 
within the knowledge and experience of the colored people. 
I should much regret to seem unfair or unappreciative in this connection; 
but it is my clear conviction—and I have some opportunities for forming 
an intelligent opinion—that normal-school work, in any strict or justifiable 
use of that term, is still scarcely to be found among these people, except
-P-A-G-E-597
THE TRAINING OF THE TEACHER IN THE SOUTH. 597 
  
where founded and directed by the benevolent organizations already men- 
tioned. 
In these later years, the South is passing through an experience not un- 
familiar at the North. Thename “Normal” attached to a school has been 
found a useful advertisement, a good “card;” and so it is being flaunted by 
schools having no right to the title—schools whose managers are as hope- 
lessly ignorant of what constitutes a true normal school as they are of the 
principles of pedagogical science. The temptation is strong to quote from 
the prospectus of one of these pseudo-normal schools; but I forbear. 
A number of so-called normal schools for colored people have now been 
established by State authority, but I make bold to say that none of them 
are normal schools in the proper sense. They are not, perhaps, afflicted 
with the charlatanism to which I have just alluded; but they are simply 
high schools, and not very high at that. Prospective teachers are instructed 
there in the subject-matter of the several studies; but nothing is given, or 
practically nothing, of the science of education; nothing, or next to nothing, 
of methods of teaching; and nothing of practice-teaching in training de- 
partments. No teacher within my ken so much needs something beyond 
mere instruction in the text-books as the colored teacher of the South. No 
teacher so much needs a thorough and common-sense induction into the 
methods and practice of elementary instruction; and no teacher gets less of 
it. 
This condition should not continue. The future is big with promise, and 
large in its demands. At the North and the South, for black and white, 
there is need for great struggle and effort to establish and diffuse truer 
ideals, and sounder methods of education. But nowhere is there need of 
more thoughtful study and persevering effort than in the future shaping of 
normal-school work among the colored people. This work should be marked 
by both progressiveness and conservatism — progressiveness in fearlessly 
cutting loose from hide-bound traditions and prejudices, and conservatism 
in avoiding all that is fanciful and sentimental. Gush and platitude are 
equally fatal; and open-eyed, open-hearted common-sense is the safest guide. 
THE TRAINING OF THE TEACHER IN THE SOUTH. 
A. D. MAYO, BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS. 
I count it a privilege that I can deal with the topic assigned me as a 
practical question, on which a somewhat unusual opportunity for observa- 
tion of school-work in the South enables me, possibly, to offer a few useful 
suggestions. And I am favored by the fact that an interesting department

of this theme—the training of the colored teacher—has already been 
treated by a gentleman who has no superior among the younger men of his 
race in the administration of the class of schools in which the teachers of a 
million colored children and youth are to be educated within the coming 
twenty years. The absolute necessity of a general, systematic course of 
training for the teacher is now conceded by all who regard instruction what 
it really is, the fundamental profession underlying all others. I am not 
called here to plead before this array of the foremost professional ability 
of the nation in behalf of such a common-place proposition, but to indicate, 
in as few and simple words as possible, what seems to me the best angle of 
approach upon a field so vast and so sparsely occupied in a majority of the 
Southern States. 
In nine of the sixteen States we used to call the South, we find established 
what is known elsewhere as the State Normal School. Five of these, 
Maryland, West Virginia, Missouri, Texas, and Tennessee, have already 
developed this agency to a recognized power in the teaching force of the 
State. In Virginia, Florida, and Louisiana, separate institutions for the 
training of white teachers have been established within a few years, with 
fair prospects of success. Alabama has a special system of subsidizing 
academical schools, for both races, for this purpose. Other States have es- 
tablished a professorship of pedagogy in their State University ; made nor- 
mal instruction one department in an institution, like the Mississippi Normal 
and Industrial College for Girls; aided a city training school to receive 
additional pupils, as in South Carolina; or, like several States, contributed 
to one of the colleges, of the Northern missionary type, for colored youth; 
the means for training teachers. The summer institute, in several cases 
aided by the Peabody Education Fund, is now well under way in all these 
States. Perhaps half a dozen city training schools, of the Oswego pattern, 
and an increasing number of classes in city graded schools, are working on 
the same line. In every Southern State the necessity of normal instruction 
is persistently urged by its superior teachers and acknowledged by the edu- 
cational public, which, for the ‘past twenty years, has shouldered the pro- 
digious labor of establishing the American common school through this vast 
realm. 
But, so far, the result has only been a suggestion of what must be done, 
and the revelation of a mighty need. When we consider that Massachu- 
setts, the first American commonwealth to establish a State normal school, 
after fifty years, does not yet draw one-half her ten thousand common-school 
teachers from the graduates of her score of State and city normals, we should 
not be surprised that the first twenty years of, common-school work in the 
South finds even the educational public of all these States just wakening to 
the overwhelming necessity of the expert in the school-room. 
The old recipe for cooking a hare is, “first catch your hare.” Whatever 
may be said concerning the partial failure to “catch” the children, the

South has taken this first step in the training of the teacher, by supplying 
the material for a competent teaching class, and, so far, the South has caught 
her hare. Nowhere in Christendom is found a more hopeful class of people, 
more ready and willing to enter on the teacher’s work, than in these sixteen 
States. 
The great civil war cast upon the public of eleven of these common- 
wealths a large number of able men and women, qualified for the work of 
the higher education. From Gen. Robert Lee, down, a large number of 
eminent military men were summoned to the office of president and professor 
in the collegiate and secondary schools— revived or newly established in the 
years after 1865. Whatever difference of opinion may prevail concerning 
the “Southern brigadier in Congress,” all competent observers bear testi- 
mony to the splendid service of “the brigadier” in the school-room. No 
class of able Southern gentlemen have done so much in the educational re- 
vival of the past twenty years as these men; who hung up the sword to wield 
the professor’s “pointer” and retired from the well-fought field of arms to 
maneuver, on the blackboard, the columns of symbolic signs that prophesy 
the coming civilization of a continent. 
Multitudes of excellent women, often of the highest personal and social 
distinction, have been called to the management of the corresponding class 
of schools for girls. I have met the wives and daughters, “sisters, cousins 
and aunts” of numbers of men of national fame in these positions; and the 
services of this devoted and able body of people, during the years of prepara- 
tion for the present arrangement of the educational new South, can hardly 
be overrated. : 
A similar work has been done by the admirable men and women from 
the North and the Canadas who have come southward to manage the higher 
schools, in which twenty thousand colored youth are now, being trained 
for the educational leadership of their people. And, worthy of all honor, 
should be remembered a considerable body of white teachers of Southern 
birth and training, who, in their larger cities— Charleston, Baltimore, New 
Orleans, Richmond—haye worked in the common school for the colored 
folk, and, with various degrees of ability and success, but with almost uni- 
form good-will and devotion, have toiled among the foundations of the new 
civilization for the freedmen. 
But this vast work of the past twenty years in building the Southern 
common school, has only been the overture to the inspiring drama of a 
whole people for the first time invited to enter the open school-house door. 
Even now, after what every well-informed observer must regard the most 
notable educational achievement of modern times—the establishment of 
the people’s common school in these’ sixteen great American States—the 
work is only on the threshold. The bottom fact about education in the 
South is, that while the higher and secondary instruction is better organized, 
both in quantity and quality, than ever before, (although large numbers of
-P-A-G-E-600

good families are unable to avail themselves of its opportunities,) yet little 
more than half of our Southern children of the actual school age, from six 
to fourteen, are now in average attendance upon any school four months in 
the year. And when we consider that the older class of admirable people 
of which I have spoken is passing away, and the South must now largely 
depend on its own educated youth to fill its places of instruction, the full 
meaning of the statement is apparent: having now caught, the South must 
cook, its hare. , 
Ini the last twenty-five years a new generation of young men and women 
has appeared, from which this material for teachers is to be gathered. For 
years to come many thousands of the best girls in all these States will enter 
upon the work of teaching. The great opportunities for profitable indus- 
try by young women, in the finer manufactures and similar employments, 
in the North, have not been largely opened in these Southern States. The 
superior young white boys of the South are swept out of the school-room 
by the big broom of the rising industrial spirit, and it will be hard, for a 
generation to come, to secure enough of these to fill the higher positions of 
instruction and school supervision. A large number of superior colored 
men will find in teaching the best opportunities now offered for high useful- 
ness to their race. 
But, more and more, the South will be compelled to depend on its young 
women of the better sort of families, where education has been a tradition, 
for its working force of teachers in common and academical schools. I am 
constantly reminded, as I go about this country, of the condition of affairs 
in New England in my own youth, when the daughter of the parson, the 
doctor, the lawyer, the governor—almost every girl who aspired to consid- 
eration in society —\was, for a time, a teacher in the common school of the 
village or rural district. And, with no desire to bring down upon myself 
the charge I have now and then encountered, of “drawing a long bow” in 
my talks about Southern educational affairs, I repeat that no country has 
to-day more valuable material for the best teaching force than is found in 
the young men who are determined and the larger number of young women 
who are inclined to enter the Southern school-room. 
Of course, the first conditions of success for these young people must be 
had in a preparation of good schooling that will send them to their profes- 
sion with an outfit of reliable knowledge. “You never can teach what you 
don’t know” should be written over the teachers’ desk in the plantation 
primary and the university. But this obvious fact is now and then turned 
inside out .by the assertion that. professional instruction in pedagogy can 
well afford to wait till this general culture is obtained. But, pray, how are 
the youth of the South to acquire this accurate and ample knowledge, until 
the teachers are prepared to furnish it? It is not possible, were it advis- 
able, to import any large number of teachers from other countries or por- 
tions of our own country; though experts will be exchanged for special

positions. The Southern cities and towns of one thousand people and 
upwards are taking on the graded-school system, growing better yearly, 
and they and the superior academies will furnish a limited number of 
youth more or less qualified for this work. But more than three-fourths 
of the children of the South live in the open country, and must be educated 
in the country district common school. And no one will assert that these 
schools are competent, at present, to give that accurate and ample knowl- . 
edge on which such emphasis is laid. 
The first necessity is the improvement of these country common schools, 
where the majority of the future teachers begin and finish their education. 
And this can only be done by some comprehensive system of training 
teachers adapted to the emergencies of the case. 
When a European government, like Italy, organizes the people’s common 
school, its first care is to create a vast agency of government normal semi- 
naries for the training of the teachers. An American State can do this only 
to a limited extent; since in our system the people, through local activity, 
must be the chief reliance. I have no question of the justice and expedi- 
ency, the well-nigh absolute necessity, of temporary, abundant national aid 
for Southern education, especially applied to the training of a competent 
teaching force, somewhat after the method of the Peabody Education Fund; 
and the more I see of Southern school-life, the less am I affected by the spe- 
cious arguments against such assistance of the South by the whole American 
people. But, while waiting for the State and the Nation to come to the res- 
cue, even as a partial aid in the establishment of an adequate system of nor- 
mal schools and colleges, the South must take off its coat and work in its 
shirt-sleeves for a full generation, and, with the means at hand, do all it can 
to answer the loud call that comes up from the cane-brake and down from 
the university for that intelligent training of the masses, without which the 
effort, expenditure and sacrifice of the educational public will be only the 
casting of treasure and life into the depths of the sea. 
All effort in the practical training of the Southern teacher must recognize 
and adapt itself to the present conditions. Thirty years ago, the social lever 
in the South pried over the plantation; to-day the fulcrum is the town. What 
in common Southern parlance is called “the city,” including city and village 
in the North, has now become the center of influence, where all new enterprises 
originate, and especially whence the rising educational influence of the country 
goes forth. An increasing number of these communities, of a population of 
one thousand and upwards, are now establishing the graded public school for 
both races. In the State of Texas one hundred and thirty ; in each of the six- 
teen Southern States a considerable number of these towns have this arrange- 
ment for the schooling of their youth. I have never known a failure in such 
an attempt when the superintendent or leading teacher has been competent 
and has been permitted to have his or her reasonable way. Many towns have 
failed from placing at the head of the enterprise a superintendent who had nei-
-P-A-G-E-602

ther knowledge of nor sympathy with the organization or methods of instruc- 
tion in a modern graded school. Of course half a dozen quarrelsome families 
of local influence can wreck this, as any worthy enterprise; but the majority 
of such attempts succeed reasonably well, and often achieve a success that 
makes the establishment of the graded school the beginning of a new era for 
the community. In such case the success is largely due to the. persistent 
work of an accomplished superintendent in training his teachers. 
Though often quite unschooled in the fit ways of handling classes, these 
enthusiastic and docile people, not always young, generally fall in with the 
plan, and, after a few months of weekly drill and experinient, are found 
doing work that challenges admiration, and converts all who are not walled 
up in social or sectarian prejudice against the common school. 
Along with this, many of these superintendents have established a class 
in pedagogies, in the upper division of the school, where several young 
people, generally girls, for a year are instructed in the best methods of ele- 
mentary school work, with some opportunity for observation and practice 
in all the grades. _Thus, without a formal normal school, which the com- 
munity is not prepared to support, the work of training the superior youth 
in the upper class for teaching goes on. Such an arrangement has the 
double advantage of preparing a suitable class of young teachers to fill the 
home vacancies and sending forth the surplus to work in the adjacent coun- 
try. The leading town, in the majority of Southern counties, is the seat of 
local government, to which the people resort for trade, and the courts—the 
center of influence. Invariably the graded school in such a place attracts 
attention. Good families move in to school their children; young people 
come from the country to prepare for teaching; and in due time the graded 
school handles the elementary and secondary education in a more effective 
way than has been known in that locality before. 
Here is the vital point of departure for the uplifting of the teaching force 
of the rural district adjacent to this place. In a few years, a considerable 
number of the brightest girls, especially from the surrounding country, pass 
through the higher grades of this school, are instructed by the superin- 
tendent, and go home to take up the good work of, improving the local 
schools. They can better afford to teach, for the small wages paid to coun- 
try instructors, than others, and often bring to the improvement of the 
masses the social influence and personal culture so valuable in this work. 
There is no good reason why every considerable town in the South, in con- 
nection with its graded schools, should not build up a department for the 
training of teachers for the adjoining country, and in no other way that I 
perceive can this reform so well be inaugurated. 
The academies of the South, one of which is found in almost every town, 
and sometimes in a little hamlet in the open country, should codperate with 
this work. For a generation to come the majority of the Southern youth 
must depend on these private or denominational seminaries for all education
-P-A-G-E-603
  THE TRAINING OF THE TEACHER IN THE SOUTH. 603 
  
above the country and village district school. There is no good reason for 
the jealousy now and then manifested between this class of institutions and 
the graded schools of the larger towns. The American people are deter- 
mined to have the secondary education free, wherever the community can 
support it, and no amount of effort from ecclesiastical or social quarters will 
hinder this movement. But nine-tenths of the children of the South live 
outside of communities able to support anything but the ordinary country 
district school. If these denominational and private academies will take 
in the situation, adjust themselves to the needs of the people, rearrange and 
vitalize their courses of study, and, especially, adopt the natural methods 
of instruction that now prevail all over Christendom, they will reap such a 
harvest of success as they have never yet enjoyed. 
And a-most valuable factor in this improvement will be the establishment 
of a genuine department of pedagogics. Every academy in these sixteen 
States should at once make arrangements for such a department, under the 
charge of an expert in elementary methods of instruction. Almost every 
school of this sort has a class of young children where the kindergarten and 
natural methods can be so well applied as not only to make it a valuable 
school, but a fit place-for observation and occasional practice by the aca- 
demical class in didactics. Thousands of the students of these institutions 
are there with the express intention of becoming teachers, and here must be 
their only preparation for this work. As it is, they often go through a 
course of study not well adjusted to their needs, under teachers wedded to 
antiquated and shiftless methods, and go forth, if not with a prejudice 
against, at least in utter ignorance of, the true way to teach a little child 
anything by a natural and scientific method. The waste of power in our 
Southern public schools from this class of teachers is incalculable, and can 
be easily prevented in the way indicated. Any school that establishes a 
‘genuine normal department under an expert, and pushes the work with 
vigor, will find itself on the high road to success. The demand for skilled 
teaching is rising like a high wind over this vast region; a wind that will 
rage like a cyclone, by-and-by, against every form of incompetency in the 
people’s common school. 
Several of the colleges and universities of the South for white, and a num- 
ber for colored, students have already established a chair of normal instruc- 
tion, and, whenever the incumbent has been competent and able to hold his 
own against reactionary influences in the faculty of the institution, the ex- 
periment has been a success. It would seem a queer anomaly that a faculty 
of educated men, devoted to good learning, should look down with undis- 
guised contempt or indifference on a man of equal scholarship, consecrated 
to the most important of all professions—the art of instruction. It would 
be a great lift in all American colleges should every graduate be required, 
during his course, to read and be examined in a good history of philosophy 
and a history of pedagogy. Even this would save many of these graduates,
-P-A-G-E-604

often competent in scholarship, from the humiliation of failure in the school- 
room as teachers. 
One of the most vexatious hindrances in the common-school work is the 
attitude of a considerable body of college professors towards the teacher in 
the elementary school, an attitude that reacts on the higher education. It is 
from lack of suitable preparation in the country district and town graded 
schools that the material for college work is still so crude and unsatisfactory 
in the South, compelling learned professors to “make bricks without straw” 
in the effort to instruct a class of youth in the higher education who never 
have learned how to study or to handle their own minds. When the col- 
lege and university life of the South has been adjusted to the needs of the 
people, making a vital connection with both the academical and common 
school, and recognizing the absolute need of training the young men who 
are to go forth often to the superintendence of graded schools, this lament- 
able waste of educational power will be avoided. In several of our South- 
ern States, the State university and denominational colleges are in this way 
making the connection with the leading schools a far more practical method 
than the establishment of new institutions as “fitting-schools” for special 
colleges. The student that enters college from a good course of training in 
a superior graded or academical school, where the most vital methods of or- 
ganization, discipline and instruction prevail, brings to his university career 
an advantage never lost during his entire course. 
Every Southern State has made some use of the institute—the normal 
school on wheels—in the training of the great majority of teachers, who 
have begun the work with no professional and little academical preparation. 
In nothing has the Peabody Educational Fund shown greater wisdom than 
in devoting its limited income to the training of teachers through the sub- 
sidizing of normal schools and aid to the institutes in several of these States. 
Every graded-school community should be organized in a perpetual weekly 
association for mutual improvement and instruction. The teacher who will 
not fall into such an arrangement—is unwilling to spend an hour or two a 
week for self-improvement in this way—is a teacher with whose services the 
community can well afford to dispense. I have great respect for the true 
independence of the teacher. The wisest superintendent encroaches least 
on the genuine freedom of his subordinates, but recognizes every judicious 
attempt to put originality into the work of the school-room. But when a 
young man, “keeping school” as an annex to the study of law, medicine, 
or divinity, or a high-stepping young woman, who would resent the “deg- 
radation” of making a profession of teaching, but condescends to abide 
awhile in the school-room, with one eye out the window, watching for “the 
coming man” to\escort her through opening gates of paradise, refuses to 
accept these opportunities for learning to do the best work under the cir- 
cumstances, this “independence” is a temptation to reflecting people to call 
it, in plain English, personal conceit or selfishness. No teacher should be
-P-A-G-E-605
  : THE TRAINING OF THE TEACHER IN THE SOUTH. 605 
  
employed in the people’s common school who is unwilling to use all fit 
opportunities furnished at public expense for improvement in this most 
honorable vocation. 
Such a local institute will be a valuable nucleus for the county associa- 
tion, which at least once a month should assemble at a convenient center, 
and give a day or more to real work. The misfortune of the average teacher, 
everywhere, is, that she sees so little superior work in her own line. In the 
institute, the experts of the district can be brought in contact with the mass 
of teachers, and their best methods become the common property of the 
body. Two errors in conducting these meetings should be avoided: First, 
the persistent reading of papers, so often of no importance to anybody save 
their writers, with little opportunity for criticism; second, the use of the 
institute platform by educational cranks, risirg politicians, or people of all 
sorts :‘on the make.” Every half-hour of such a meeting should have its 
work, and the work should always be in the line of some real need of the 
teachers attending. No Southern county is destitute of several excellent 
teachers, who, by the constant meeting with their associates in this way, 
could greatly improve the methods of instruction in all schools. And these 
associations are the places from which should go forth constant efforts to 
push good professional and general reading among the teachers. A library 
of educational literature could easily be gathered in every considerable 
town, available for the whole county, which, in connection with the circu- 
lation of the best educational journals, the use of reading clubs, Chautauqua 
circles, etc., would work a revolution through the land. A few men and 
women with a head for organization, and the cheerful courage and electric 
zeal that any good work demands, in this way could work a mighty change 
just where it is most required. 
The State and district institutes and summer schools will be valuable in 
proportion as they are in the hands of competent people. Here is a good 
opportunity to reinforce home talent by distinguished visitors from abroad, 
giving to thousands of teachers the privilege of acquaintance with the lead- 
ing minds of the profession. The Northern institute or summer school is 
happy when the kindly face of good President Shepard, of Charleston, 8. C., 
beams over the lecturer’s desk, or President Wm. Preston Johnston towers 
above the platform; while Dr. Soldan, Col. Parker, and Supt. Newell are 
household names in the Southern assembly from Washington to Texas. No 
body of professional people in the Republic is so lifted above the petty 
jealousies of section, sect, and party, as the foremost teachers of North and 
South, East and West. And here in the summer school is the fit meeting- 
place for the only personal intercourse possible between these over-worked 
experts and the mass of instructors, always ready and willing to profit by 
their aid. 
For the coming twenty-five years, it will be fortunate if our Southern 
States avoid the mistake into which some of our great, wealthy common-
-P-A-G-E-606

ae   
wealths of the North have fallen— of scattering their resources by the mul- 
tiplication of State normal schools. Some of our States have so yielded to 
local importunity that they have almost lost the idea of a genuine normal 
college; and the whole work of training for this profession by the State has 
suffered discredit. I am convinced that the true policy of our.Southern 
States is to build up, in each, one strong, really competent institution, in a 
central locality, where every department of normal training can be fitly or- 
ganized; and upon that concentrate funds and the best teaching force. This 
will send forth graduates to all portions of the State; teachers for the coun- 
try; superintendents for the graded schools; professors of instruction for 
the academies; who will be able to organize and direct the local agencies 
before mentioned, at once commanding the respect of the educational pub- 
lic, and stimulating the entire body of teachers out to the uttermost limits 
of the profession. The faculty of such a college should be so numerous 
that, without over-exertion, it could be made available for institute work, 
visitation of conventions, local associations and schools, and personal in- 
spection of the work of the graduates — all, really, the vocation of the State 
normal school. It sometimes requires a good deal of that holy obstinacy 
which is the backbone of all greatness, to resist the mischievous intrigues 
of the crowd of educational demagogues who swarm the lobbies of the leg- 
islature to push their little schemes for their own advantage, through the 
appropriation of State funds, for the multiplication of schools, where con- 
centration is the true law of success. The bane of the higher education in 
our country is diffusion, with inevitable superficiality, vibrating always on 
the perilous edge of collapse. Concentration is the soul of success in modern 
life, and, for the coming generation, all the concentration for effectual ad- 
ministration in the higher realms of education that the people can be per- 
suaded to approve will be for the public good. No Southern State is unable 
to support a true normal college, amply endowed and furnished for the best 
work, which will become an authority in all varieties of teaching, and 
steadily wake up all local agencies in a healthful and stimulating way. 
And if the best teachers will go a little more into educational politics and 
make it “hot” for the most disreputable class of politicians—the men who 
trifle with the people’s common school —there need not be the too frequent 
spectacle of the capture of these great centers of light by a party of reac- 
tion; changing what should be the temple of the highest public illumina- 
tion, to a comfortable roost for a respectable group of educational bats and 
owls. 3 
This normal college should include a complete arrangement for the illus- 
tration of a thorough school system; where not, only the city graded, but 
the country district school, should be under constant observation, and open 
to judicious practice by the students. I confess myself unable to appreciate 
the opposition of some of our educators to the union of a practice depart- 
ment with the normal school. On the strength of years of observation, in
-P-A-G-E-607
  THE TRAINING OF THE TEACHER IN THE SOUTH. 607 
all parts of the country, I thoroughly disagree with the statement that the 
practice department of the normal school is a failure. 
It has been called “a place where inexperienced boys and girls experi- 
ment on children.” But, pray, what would these boys and girls be at if not 
in a normal school? “Experimenting,” in separate school-rooms, without 
the benefit of the instruction in the academies or method-work of the nor- 
mal, without the supervision of an expert, and the whole circle of critical 
and helpful influences that surround them in the normal practice school. 
Doubtless, if every country school-mistress could have a university edu- 
cation, it might be correct to say that normal method-training, without 
_ adequate knowledge, tends to superficiality. But since the State and city 
normal schools of the country are, with few exceptions, the best academies 
of the Union — best in the zeal of their students, the ability of their teach- 
ers, and, notably, in their methods of instruction —why disparage such in- 
strumentalities before the public in behalf of impossible substitutes? The 
plain fact is that the State normal and city training schools of the United 
States, during the past fifty years, have done more to raise the general and 
professional standing of the teaching class in all schools than any or all 
other agencies. Every civilized country to-day is working an elaborate sys- 
tem of professional training as the soul of its national scheme of popular 
education. Our Southern States will be wise if they turn a deaf ear to the 
opponents of the State normal school. There are no defects in our Amer- 
ican system of normal training which cannot be overcome by the wise and 
vigorous use of the means at hand, and the stern resistance to a superficial 
popular policy of endless diffusion. 
The one great lack in our country, a complete normal university, may 
yet be supplied, here in Nashville. Should the management of the Peabody 
Education Fund adopt the suggestion of its illustrious founder in due time, 
to endow one or more schools with its ample means, the South may be the 
first. to witness this crowning achievement of the national education. If 
one true normal university for white and one for colored teachers could 
thus be established in the South, many of the failures in other portions of 
the country might be avoided, and the true direction given to a movement 
so easily deflected into shallow and ineffectual channels, but, rightly guarded, 
of untold value to all the coming generations of this fair portion of our 
American heritage, through countless years to come.

cation, as exemplified in the ideal normal school, and they appreciate the 
efforts of their friends, North and South, in their behalf. 
J. H. Hoosx, of New York: I commend the deep insight of the author 
of the first paper, in comprehending the situation of the colored man as re- 
gards education. | 
R. C. Norron, of Missouri: I appreciate the great value of the efforts of 
the Northern people to start the education of the colored race. I think that 
the colored people should now step forward, and carry on the work so well 
begun. 
W. A. Canpier, of Georgia: I think the paper of A. D: Mayo highly 
commendable. There is no normal school in Georgia, but the teachers are 
making a move to secure one. I thoroughly indorse the “practice school,” 
being myself a graduate of a normal school which had a practice department.   T. J. Gray, of Minnesota: Education is one of civilization’s most expen- 
sive accompaniments. Ido not think there are enough among the whites 
or blacks of the South, who are earnestly desiring education, to sustain a 
public-school system for the negroes. The South would be obliged to raise 
more money to support such a system, and at present there are not enough 
who desire such an appropriation, or such taxation. . 
JEROME ALLEN, of New York: The South pays proportionately as much 
as the North. To be sure, New York alone pays $16,000,000, but that is 
not much for her. The fact is, that New York cannot to-day supply her 
district schools with teachers, in spite of her fourteen normal schools; and 
academies are being aided to furnish trained teachers for these lower grades. 
I think that a State like Minnesota or Georgia should haye at least six nor- 
mal schools. 
A.J. Sree es, of Tennessee: I think that supervision is needed in the 
South. 
ALBERT SatisBury,of Wisconsin: I think that the Southern States must 
extend their efforts. The General Government should aid in establishing 
normal schools in the South. 
A. D. Mayo, of Massachusetts: I contend for the central idea of my pa- 
per, the establishment of one normal school only in a State. 
E. R. Exvprives, of Alabama: Although I have been in normal-school 
work in Alabama for a year, and have carefully studied the statistics there, 
I can hardly speak intelligently of Southern work asa whole. I feel, how- 
ever, that I know much more about the matter now than I did when a citi- 
zen of Iowa; and more than many of these gentlemen, who have spoken so 
positively, can know, never having been on the ground. There are special 
obstacles and conditions in the South which are unknown to the North. 
The people there, while glad to get all the advice they can from their North- 
ern brethren, must nevertheless work out their own educational salvation; 
and they will do it, too. Ido not think: Dr. Mayo’s picture of Alabama’s

condition is correct. I think that four normal schools can do, and are doing, 
more than one alone could do, as he advocated. 
Gentlemen of the Northeast, North, and Northwest, we thank you for 
your sympathy, and we are not forgetful of your early aid in the South on 
behalf of education; but we have a brainy people here—a people filled with 
a desire to educate—and we shall persevere until we build up a system 
suited to our conditions.

SECRETARY’S MINUTES. 
Hiexu-Scnoot Buripine, NasHvitye, Tenn., July 17, 1889. 
The Department of Superintendence assembled at 3 o’clock p.m.; Vice- 
President C. C. Davidson in the chair. The chairman stated that President 
Campbell was detained at home on account of the illness of his brother. 
The following resolution, by H. 8. Tarbell, was adopted : 
Resolved, That the annual meeting of this Department be held in Washington, 
D.C.,or such other place as the Executive Committee select, and that the officers 
elected at this time hold office until the close of the winter meeting: 
On motion of Aaron Gove, the Executive Committee was requested to 
hold the next meeting in New York City. 
On motion of J. M. Greenwood, the Department proceeded to the election 
of officers. 
Mr. Clark moved that the election be by ballot. Carried. 
Messrs. Greenwood and Gove were appointed tellers. The result of the 
ballot was: A. S. Draper, 16; J. A. B. Lovett, 14; scattering, 8. 
On motion of Mr. Tarbell, the following officers were elected: 
President—A. 8. Draper, New York City. 
First Vice-President—J. A. B. Lovett, Huntsville, Alabama. 
Second Vice-President—E. B. McElroy, Salem, Oregon. 
Secretary—L. W. Day, Cleveland, Ohio. 
Mr. Draper thanked the members, and expressed his disapproval of hav- 
ing so many papers and so little spontaneous discussion, and said if the 
members approved he would have a programme arranged which would 
secure this free discussion. 
Messrs. White, Hancock and Greenwood expressed approval of Mr. Dra- 
per’s plan. 
Mr. Brown, of Nashville, extended a welcome to the members. 
Mr. Greenwood, of Kansas City, spoke briefly of a former visit he had 
made to the public schools of Nashville, and of his surprise and delight at 
finding such well-organized schools. He commended the system. 
Mr. McElroy spoke words of praise concerning the warm reception re- 
ceived at the hands of the people of Nashville. 
The Department then adjourned.

DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION. 
SECRETARY’S MINUTES. 
FIRST SESSION. 
NaAsHVILLE, TENNESSEE, July 18, 1889. 
The Department of Industrial Education met in the First Cumberland 
Presbyterian Church, at 3 P.M. 
The President being absent, C. M. Woodward, of. St. Louis, was appointed 
to preside. 
On motion of Olin H. Landreth, of Vanderbilt University, it was voted 
that the exercises appointed for the afternoon be postponed till the next 
session, and that the Department proceed to the discussion of such matters 
of interest as might be proposed by members. ; 
The discussion was opened by J. H. Brown, of Nashville, who proposed 
the question: “What is the best method of introducing manual training 
into the schools of a city?” 
C.M. Woopwarp: The first thing to be done is to determine exactly what 
shall be included in the proposed course, and then to secure a teacher who 
will take up the work with ability and earnestness. 
A. J. Ricxorr, of New York: The course adopted in introducing manual 
training into “The Workingman’s School,” of New York City, was this: For 
the first three years no additional room was required. The apparatus and 
material used were quite inexpensive, consisting of paper squares, triangles, 
and circles, with a pair of scissors for each child the first year; modeling- 
clay, a graduated rule, a try-square, a cheap pair of dividers, and a clay- 
chisel, the second year; paste-boards of different kinds, drawing-boards on 
which to cut paper, a pair of compasses, and a knife sharpened only at the 
point, completed the outfit for the third year. Thus for the first three years 
there was little expense. On the fourth year and thereafter the pupils were 
taught in a separate room, a workshop being provided. But even this need 
not be very expensive. The main thing is to get a good teacher. One who 
has a knowledge of wood-working tools, provided he is a good teacher, can 
start the work. In time it will so commend itself to the community that 
funds will not be lacking, and a thoroughly competent teacher may be em- 
ployed. :

Mr. Barron, of Peru, Illinois: Much of the work spoken of by Mr. Rickoff 
is done in all good schools; but in speaking of manual training, I contem- 
plate shop-work for children. The girls should not be forgotten. I have 
found their instruction in this department productive of excellent results. 
A gentleman of Peru donated a sufficient sum to purchase the needed tools 
and apparatus for carrying on a carving class, which was very successful. 
Mr. Wuire, of Carthage, Missouri: I think that much of the work spoken 
of as appropriate for primary schools has already-been introduced into, the 
schools of the West. The question I would raise is this: “What shall be 
done for the fourth and fifth years and thereafter?” 
Mr. Woopwarp: Besides the use of tools appropriate to wood and metal 
work, much may be done in directing the attention of pupils to the phe- 
nomena of nature—or, in other words, giving instruction in natural history 
and in the rudiments of some of the departments of physics. 
Mr. J.D. Waurers: Pupils ready for the high school should be capable 
of using the tools ordinarily used by mechanics. They should work till 
they feel some degree of fatigue; it should not be mere play. Pupils from 
eight to thirteen years of age should be taught the simple rules of ortho- 
graphic projection. I would recommend carving in cast plaster of paris. 
All this to prepare the pupils for mechanical work. 
Mr. Barron: Would you introduce mechanical before free-hand draw- 
ing? 
Mr. Waurers: I would. 
Mr. Barron: Would you apply this to the younger pupils? 
  Mr. Watters: Yes, for the reason that mechanical drawing is easier 
than free-hand drawing. 
Mr. Woopwarp: The question of the precedence of free-hand or me- 
chanical drawing has already received much attention. 
GrorGE CHatrerton, of Florida: What is the best means of advertis- 
- ing or spreading information in regard to manual training? 
J. D. Crawrorp, of Pennsylvania: I recommend the exhibition of the 
work of manual-training schools when such work can be secured. I have 
succeeded in exciting considerable interest wherever I have presented the 
subject. 
E. W. Bemis, of Vanderbilt University: Having received leave of ab- 
sence, I spent some weeks in lecturing upon manual training in different | 
parts of the South. I found much interest manifested in the subject wher- 
ever I went. 
Mr. Cuarrerton: How shall the demand for manual training be met? 
Mr. Crawrorp: No more should be expected of manual training, in the 
way of being self-sustaining, than of instruction in penmanship, arithmetic, 
or any other school study.
-P-A-G-E-619
  REPORT OF SECRETARY. 619 
  
Mr. Woopwarp: In school the purpose is not to produce any value, 
save in the boy himself. The conditions for money-making are unfavorable 
to this. There is a difference between certain schools in this respect; as, for 
instance, the Worcester School and the Massachusetts Institute of Technol- 
ogy, in Boston. 
Mr. Crawrorp: Should not the term “manual training,” as used in this 
department, be exactly defined? I propose this definition: The term “man- 
ual training’’ shall be used to embrace all hand exercises, the primary ob- 
ject of which is intellectual development. 
Mr. Woopwarp: That definition seems to be a good one, but it would 
be wise to give the matter careful consideration, in order that the prevalent 
confusion arising from the use of the term may be avoided. 
Mr. Bemis: Manual training is training in the creative and constructive 
processes of art and mechanics, whose primary object is mental and moral 
development. 
Mr. Woopwarp: As chairman of the Committee on Nomenclature, I 
have never been able to get the committee together, though a cordial inter- 
est had been shown in the work it proposed to do. No report has therefore 
been agreed upon, and I ask that the committee be continued and enlarged. 
On motion, the committee was continued. 
Mr. Lanprere: offered the following resolutions, which were adopted : 
1. That the Committee on Nomenclature be increased in personnel by the addi- 
tion of members who shall represent the subject of Manual Training in connection 
with public, engineering, trade, and technical schools. 
2. That the scope of the committee be enlarged so as to include the classification 
and nomenclature of trade, industrial, manual-training, and technical schools. 
8. That the committee be instructed to make and publish before January 1, 1890, 
a preliminary report, and to invite discussion thereon; and that a final report be 
presented at the meeting of this Department in July, 1890. 
Mr. Woopwarp said that he greatly preferred not to use the words “car- 
pentry” and “carpenter shop.” He preferred “joinery” and “woodworking 
shop.” In the same way he would use “forging” and “forging shop,” not 
“blacksmith,” &c. He disliked the phrase “ working-drawings,” and would 
substitute “projection” and “detail drawings.” He remarked that there 
was substantial agreement between the principal manual-training schools in 
the use of names of special forms in shop exercises in wood and metals. 
The committee would, however, touch on some of these matters im their 
forthcoming report. 
The session then adjourned to meet the next day, Friday, at 3 o’clock. 
SECOND SESSION.—Juty 19.

J.D. Walters, of Manhattan, Kansas, read a paper on “ Ways, Means, and 
Maxims in Manual Training.” 
A paper on “Industrial Education in the South,” by B. G. Northrop, of 
Connecticut, was then read by George W. McAndrew, of New Haven. 
Mr. Landreth moved that the chair appoint a Committee on Nomination 
of Officers. 
The following were appointed such committee: Olin J. Landreth, of Nash- 
ville, Tennessee; J. D. Walters, of Manhattan, Kansas; J. D. Crawford, of 
Tidioute, Pennsylvania. } 
During the absence of the committee for consultation, there was a brief 
and informal discussion of the progress of manual training. 
Mr. Landreth, chairman of the Committee on Nominations, reported as 
follows: 
President—C. M. Woodward, St. Louis. 
Vice-President—J. M. Ordway, of New Orleans. 
Secretary—H. A. Wise, Baltimore. 
Mr. Woodward declining the nomination in favor of Mr. Rickoff, the re- 
port thus amended was unanimously adopted. 
The Department then adjourned sine die.

PAPERS AND DISCUSSIONS. 
WAYS, MEANS, AND MAXIMS IN MANUAL TRAINING. 
J. D. WALTERS, MANHATTAN, KANSAS. 
An examination of the current program of the Association will show that 
“Sléjd”**—I shall use this term for “ Educational Manual Labor,” to give 
the Committee on Nomenclature a chance to test its euphony—is a chief 
subject for debate in the union meetings, as well as the main question for 
discussion in two of the departments. No other subject has of late received 
such general attention, and none is likely to rob it of this distinction for 
some time; but while the present discusses the value of sléjd as compared 
with other and older means of education, and considers its introduction into 
the curricula of the different grades and kinds of schools, the future will 
regard this primary phase as settled, and will investigate and debate other 
aspects. Indeed, we of this Section have already arrived here. Slojd is a 
fact with us, and we are its pledged champions. The principles of this new 
education are to us but the maxims of a better status of society. 
The question, then, before the Section is naturally one of ways, means, 
and methods. “What is the relation of sléjd to those other branches of in- 
struction which the modern school of science and industry has adopted as 
necessary components of its curriculum, and how can these be woven into 
an educational whole? How can they be built into one solid and self- 
supporting arch in which every stone leans upon every other, bearing equal 
shares of the weight of the supported structure?” Let us understand that 
the investigation of this relation is naturally our work. Others may con- 
tribute thoughts and theories to decide whether the required means are in 
something like the natural ratio to the desired ends, but the question as to 
how this work is to be done, what means shall be employed, and what time 
shall be given, must be answered by us. 
We do not disagree, I believe, in regard to the purpose of this new edu- 
cation. The differing views recorded in the rapidly accumulating literature 
of practical education are simply the historic phases of its evolution —they 
*The word Slojd is derived from the Icelandic, The substantive, Sldjd, is connected with an old 
Swedish adjective, “slog,” meaning dextrous, artistic, skillful; and thus we find the noun to signify 
dexterity and artistic skill. There is a Low-German word, “ Klutern,” which has a similar significance. 
In Sweden there is a distinct class of workmen called Slijders, whose general dexterity is so great that 
they are able to do all those varied jobs about an establishment that in other countries would require 
the assistance of special carpenters, plumbers, blacksmiths, ete. The Swedish word Sldjd is passing 
into use with many other nationalities, but always with a more restricted meaning than in the original 
tongue, being confined almost entirely to the educational side of the expression,

are successive, rather than coéxisting, opinions of the profession. There 
was a time when the idea prevailed that it was to take the place of the 
decaying system of apprenticeship, and simply teach the different trades of 
the land. The ideal before the minds of the philanthropists who advocated 
the departure was the trade school, with a program of shop or field-work, 
supplemented by more or less closely adjusted school-work of a scientific 
character; and accordingly they organized schools for agriculture, schools 
for weavers, schools for wood-carvers, locomotive engineers, cooks, etc. 
Europe especially indorsed this idea; and it cannot be said that the insti- 
tutions founded were not beneficial in their direct results. There was a far 
better reason, though, for these attempts in the old country. The industries 
of Europe are localized to a much greater extent than they are with us. 
The natural resources of the old continent are well explored, and the man- 
ufacture of those articles of commerce which are dependent on certain min- 
eral products or on peculiar climatic conditions has long since gravitated 
toward and collected at central points. Where the chief product of a dis- 
trict is a fixed and historic fact, a special trade school is more in place than 
in a new country with unexplored natural resources, unfixed lines of work, 
and a restless population. 
It was soon discovered that the trade school did not and never would 
meet the problem which it attempted to solve. There were too many im- 
portant and yet entirely different lines of work which claimed equal recog- 
nition. Even in agricultural schools special instruction was found to be an 
impossibility because of the diverging specialties of the land-tiller. While 
all farmers, stock-breeders, dairymen, horse-breeders, vegetable and land- 
scape gardeners, florists, wine-growers, orchardists, agricultural teachers and 
agricultural editors, foresters, nurserymen, etc., could make use of the same 
general knowledge, they also required a very different special training in the 
actual pursuits of their work; and since this is true of all vocations, it soon 
became evident that in order to do the greatest good to the greatest number, 
the instruction in the sciences must be limited to the general principles, and 
the teaching of hand-work to the most common tool manipulation, while 
matters of mere dexterity in the handling of special tools or machines must 
be left to the farm, the workshop, or the factory where the pupil was ulti- 
mately to find employment. It was found, too, that a general understand- 
ing of mathematics, and an experimental knowledge of the chemical and 
physical properties of iron, wood, stone, lead, clay, plaster of paris, 7. e., the 
most common raw materials, was worth infinitely more than dexterity in 
the use of special tools. Accordingly the trade school gradually broadened 
its curriculum, while schools of applied science, equipped with laboratories, 
shops, botanical gardens, nurseries, experimental farms— with more of this 
or more of that as the object in view seemed to require it—were organized 
in all parts of both continents. Efforts were made to systematize the scien- 
tific instruction and manual labor so as to weld them into a compact cur-  
-P-A-G-E-623
  
MANUAL TRAINING. 623 
  
riculum; modern languages were added to unlock to the pupil the scientific 
and technical literature of other nations, and the trade school had under- 
gone its first transformation—that from a mere substitute for the ancient 
system of apprenticeship into a polytechnic school, with a college for agri- 
culture, a college for engineering, a college for architecture, a college for 
domestic economy, and a college for industrial art and design. 
It is true that sléjd did not always receive its proper share of attention in 
these polytechnic institutions. From purely economic reasons the scientist 
was willing to accord manual labor some means and time, but, like the classic 
teacher of old, he overlooked its great educational advantages. There was 
a great point gained, however: sléjd had become associated with systematic 
instruction in experimental science—its twin sister—and had come under 
the personal supervision of trained observers. In founding these schools for 
the purpose of educating architects, engineers, technologists and agricultur- 
ists, the founders “builded better than they knew,” for unconsciously they 
inaugurated an educational revolution: they started the stagnated science of 
pedagogics on a new path and gave it a newimpetus. It was gradually ob- 
served that the systematic instruction in the use of tools had a quickening 
effect on the intellectual faculties of the student far beyond the expected 
limit. The boy who begins to construct things is compelled at once to be- 
gin to think, deliberate, reason, and conclude. As he proceeds he is brought 
in contact with powerful natural forces. If he would control, direct, and 
supply these forces, he must first master the laws by which they are gov- 
erned; he must investigate the causes of the phenomena of matter. From 
this he is led to an investigation of the phenomena of mind. At the very 
threshold of practical mechanics a thirst for wisdom is engendered, and the 
student is irresistibly impelled to investigate the mysteries of philosophy. 
Thus training the hand and the eye reacts upon the mind, stimulating it to 
excursions into the realms of scientific discovery in search of facts to be ap- 
plied in practical form at the bench and the anvil. 
Such observations were made wherever teachers had a fair chance for ex- 
periment. Their testimony was overwhelming in favor of the excellent 
influence upon the intellectual activity of all classes of students, and the 
formerly much-criticised proposition of Jean Jacques Rousseau, that “a 
pupil will learn more by one hour of educational manual labor than he will 
retain from a whole day’s verbal instructions,” was being verified in the 
schools of both continents; and the conclusion was, that if there is such an 
educational force in manual labor when properly connected with scientific 
and mathematical instruction, the skill in the use of tools acquired and the 
knowledge of practical mechanics gained must form a net gain, so to speak, 
for the pupil. ; 
It was also found that the effect of this instruction upon the physical 
development of the pupil was of the most beneficial kind. It gave him 
health and strength; it restored the disturbed balance between body and

mind caused by purely intellectual exertion and physical inertia; it gave 
him wholesome sleep for the night, and active wakefulness for the day; it 
gave him all the advantages of systematic gymnastics, with none of the dis- 
advantages. | 
Lastly, it was observed that such a course of training had the very best 
effect upon the upbuilding of a manly, self-reliant, well-balanced character. 
It gave the pupil food for wholesome thought, gave him an insight into the 
economy of the shop, the factory, the business firm, the farm, and the com- 
monwealth, and made him a useful citizen, believing in the noble dignity 
of labor. 
These were the reported results of the systematic teaching of sléjd when 
connected with proper scientific and linguistic instruction—not that they 
were conceded at once, or appeared at once to the doubting observer: the 
results of any system of education must necessarily appear gradually; and 
the final test is not the claim of the teacher or the graduate, but the life 
and work of the citizen—“By their fruits ye shall know them.” It was 
here, however, where the testimony became the most positive. 
Observations of this kind must, of course, have produced some effect upon 
the current methods of popular education. They were followéd by a close 
analysis of the psychological phenomena, and the science of pedagogics was 
enriched by much that was only partly understood before. It was discoy- 
ered that Rousseau, Pestalozzi, and Froebel had been aware of the educa- 
tional value of sléjd before, though they had experimented mostly with 
younger pupils and with another purpose before them. It became clear 
that it was simply the natural continuation of the kindergarten, the logical. 
extension of the object lesson. This, once clearly understood, brought about 
a revolution in school methods; sléjd was no longer the expedient of the 
industrial school, but it became a means of general: education; the battle 
had been fought and won. Public opinion indorsed it; the press discussed 
it; governors and mayors spoke of it in their messages; and cities and towns 
‘began to organize sléjd departments in their public schools or independent 
manual-training institutions. The paternal interest of a certain class of 
legislators became in fact suspiciously significant of the growing popularity 
of slojd. : 
Step by step sléjd is forcing itself into new quarters and “old quarters.” 
Through it the old industrial school has become a general educational in- 
stitution, with a broad curriculum designed to educate, not workmen — that 
is, persons skilled in the arts and methods of any specific trade—but work- 
ers; that is, persons whose capacity for work is general, and whose ability 
to adapt themselves to any specific work which they may choose, shall have 
been developed as part of the general training, discipline, and culture which 
are the outcome of their pupilage. From its position as an expedient of a 
purely economic character, this new education grew into a harmonious and 
rational system of instruction well adapted to supplant instead of supple- 
ment. 
 
-P-A-G-E-625
MANUAL TRAINING. 625 
The evolution was, of course, not a regular movement toward any ob- 
jective point; each institution followed its own zig-zag line of progress. 
Those founded during the last decade have had the great advantage of 
starting on the bases of ripe experience, and were spared the trials and 
tribulations of experiment. The great number of the so-called manual- 
labor schools were successful from the first. Much remains to be done, 
however. Much is opinion and theory, instead of knowledge and fact. To 
this day there has not been formulated a generally sanctioned course of 
work for pupils of any grade. There are neither text-books, nor hand-books, 
nor periodicals; there is not even a definite nomenclature. 
Tam aware that the great range of adaptability of slojd prevents the forma- 
tion of inflexible rules of teaching, but this is the case with most other subjects 
of instruction. It is necessary to vary the course according to the age of the 
pupil, the character of the school, whether preparatory or completing, and 
it must vary also according to the character of the teacher, the complete- 
ness of the shop, and the abundance of illustrative material. All I can do, 
then, in this paper will be to give you a few ideas which have crystallized 
into something like general truths, and state a few limitations which I have 
noticed during a connection of thirteen years with one of the manual-train- 
ing schools of the country. My chief purpose in bringing these observations 
before the Section, is to invite a general discussion. If my statements should 
appear positive or dogmatic, remember that the limit of my paper precluded 
any other form. 
First: Sl6jd must form a part of the work of every day, and must be con- 
tinued throughout the whole course. It must be an obligatory branch of 
instruction— not optional. Absences from sléjd must be treated like those 
from other studies. The effort and advancement of the pupil must be care- 
fully graded and recorded. In short, sléjd must not be treated as a special, 
experimental, additional, plebeian, or privileged branch of instruction. 
Second: The time given to it must vary according to the age and strength 
of the pupil, or the nature of the labor demanded of him, and should be 
sufficient to produce the feeling of fatigue, but not of exhaustion. The 
limit may be put at from fifty minutes to three hours. The program of 
daily work should be arranged so as to give the morning hours to the purely 
mental studies—as mathematics and language—to be followed by scientific 
studies arid laboratory work or drawing, while sléjd should come last. 
Third: The discipline during shop hours should be that of other classes. 
Permit the removal of coat, collar, and cuffs; insist upon the wearing of a 
conyenient and clean shop-apron, and prohibit the use of gloves. 
Fourth: All work must be done with men’s tools, not toy or boy’s tools, 
and must be business-like, honest, and well understood. The pupil must be 
held responsible for the proper care and treatment of his assigned tools. 
All tools should belong to the school, and must be of good quality, and 
alike for all members of the class. The shop may be cleaned and swept by
-P-A-G-E-626

626 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  
a janitor, but the pupil must look to the proper condition of his work-bench. 
The workshop should be provided with a clock, and the ante-room with a . 
coat-rack, a number of wash-bowls, ete. 
Fifth: The pupil should be required to make complete things. The 
so-called Russian system, in which the pupil learns to use tools. on raw 
material in different states without knowing what form it is to have when 
completed, has been tried and found wanting. By complete things is not 
meant complete articles of use, but complete parts, joints, stages of work in 
the making of definite objects. While the work must proceed from the 
simple and coarse to the finished and complex, the teacher should also re- 
member that it cannot be dissected and graded like the purely mental. 
Sixth: The tools used should be simple hand-tools, not machines. At- 
tempts have been made to reduce the number of representative tools to 
seven, but there are evidently many more. Complex machinery is an ex- 
cellent means of education in the higher classes of polytechnic schools. 
Seventh: Slojd, not connected with a course of study in mathematics, sci- 
ence, and language, has little educational value. 
Eighth: The relation of sléjd and drawing is such an intimate one that 
it is impossible to disconnect the two. Both work toward the same end. 
Drawing is the language of form, and sléjd the process of investigation of 
the mathematical and physical properties of things, ¢. ¢., of real forms. The 
one is connected with conception and the other with creation. In the purely 
mental atmosphere of the old school, drawing was a purely emotional, or at 
least purely mental, branch of education—a sister of music; but the prog- 
ress of industrial art during the present half of the nineteenth century, the 
force that has evolved sléjd, has also changed the character and position of 
drawing as an educational means. The study has become a study of exact 
mathematics, and has developed a series of conventional signs and methods 
of expression. Its tools have multiplied from the crayon and pencil to the 
multiplex contents of the draughtsman’s drawer, including compasses, draw- 
ing-pen, trammel, T-square, triangle, irregular. curve, perspective linead, 
dontograph, and many others. It has changed its character to such an ex- 
tent that the question is sometimes asked if it is not a sufficient substitute 
for slojd—if the use of the pencil and all the other tools might not com- 
prise all, or nearly all, the benefits of shop-work. The answer is, Drawing 
does not make things, but pictures, and does not teach the physical proper- 
ties of materials and the mechanical properties of tools. The two branches 
are not substitutes for each other, but supplements, and should be taught in 
parallel courses supporting each other. The drawing-class should teach the 
methods of representation of form, and the work in the shop should be done 
after drawings, 7. ¢., orthographic or isometric projections made by the pupil 
from blackboard originals or dictations. 
Ninth: The course of instruction must vary according to the age of the 
pupil, the means of the institution, and the special object, if any, of the en-
-P-A-G-E-627

dowment. Boys under ten or twelve years of age cannot use men’s tools, 
and should be given work in clay-modeling, shaping in hard plaster of paris, 
etc. Older pupils should begin their sléjd with work in pine or tulip-wood, 
and should receive class instruction. Begin with.sawing and nailing, fol- 
low with coarse planing, boring, mortising, and dove-tailing; then take up 
matching and joining, and follow with hatchet and drawing-knife work. 
Let the pupil grind or file his tools. During the second year the lathe 
should be a principal tool. Of all the tools of the workshop the lathe is the 
one most eagerly and profitably used by the pupil, and it permits the easy 
creation of the greatest variety of forms. Hard wood may be introduced 
now, and as a test of the ability to shape material and handle tools acquired 
during the first two years some more or less complex piece of furniture may 
be built, involving all the tool manipulations learned, together with many 
new ones. During the third year, work in metal should be taken up. Begin 
with filing, and follow with drilling, thread-cutting, and lathe-work. During 
the fourth year, the pupil should study work on the anvil and the forge. In 
large classes, the anvil-work is best introduced by using cold lead bars, which 
behave under the hammer much as soft, heated iron does. After learning 
stretching, reducing, welding, tempering, ete., foundry-work should be taken 
up; and lastly, the student should enter the engine-room and learn to gov- 
ern the Atlas of the industrial world. If the course covers over four years, 
the foundry will furnish a rich and profitable programme. 
I have merely given here an outline of one kind of slojd. The agricul- 
tural school should intersperse this during the season of crop-growth with 
work in the garden, the greenhouse, the nursery, the barn, and the field. 
Work of this kind cannot be well graded, however, because it depends upon 
the seasons, the condition of crops, roads and fields, and especially upon the 
weather. It has also a directly economic character which the teacher can- 
not change, and which the pupil recognizes. It has been found best to pay 
for such work a small remuneration of seven to ten cents per hour, accord- 
ing to the effectiveness and thoroughness of the efforts. Other special 
schools might make other changes; but whatever is being done, the boy must 
not be sacrificed to the work he is to do. The work must be educational, 
or it will be worse than useless in a course of instruction. 
Fruitful instruction is the result of many factors, but the teacher is the 
chief one.’ To teach slijd the instructor must be a mechanic, a scientist, a 
teacher, and a philosopher; he must be of an active disposition, full of 
earnest enthusiasm, and wholly in sympathy with his work. Wherever 
sléjd has fallen short of its usual results the indications have pointed toward 
the teacher as the main cause. 
The time cannot be far off when the American people will make a gen- 
eral effort to attach the sléjd-shop to the public school, and then, and not 
till then, will our mission of spreading the gospel of the “new education,”

cease. “Public education should touch practical life in'a larger number of 
places; it should better fit all for that sphere in life in which they are des- 
tined to find their highest happiness and well-being.” 
INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION IN THE SOUTH. 
  
B. G. NORTHROP, NEW HAVEN, CONNECTICUT. 
Industrial education is a new thing’in the south. During the existence 
of slavery the white men were unused to labor, and naturally regarded work 
as servile, and of course were ignorant of its methods and averse to learn- 
ing them. The young men then sought the professions, or led lives of ease 
and luxury. They were usually great horsemen and hunters and good 
shots; hence, when crushed and impoverished by the civil war, they seemed 
at first comparatively helpless. The North had always honored labor, and 
practiced varied industries.) The Northern States had generally established 
schools of agriculture and mechanic arts long before this work was attempted 
anywhere-in the South; but under the influence of skilled and varied in- 
dustry the logic of events is now revealing grand factors for her future 
growth and prosperity. There is a New South in practical aims, in hope- 
fulness and helpfulness, courage and energy in realizing its wonderful pos- 
sibilities. While lecturing in all the Southern States, except Arkansas, 
there has come to me a series of surprises at the material resources opened 
and opening; the marvelous wealth in forests, mines, and marts; the vast 
resources for lumbering, manufactories, and agriculture, together with their 
great natural facilities for transportation by ocean, gulf, and rivers never 
frozen, to say nothing of its new net-work of railways. Such opportunities 
and advances, with still greater possibilities, have emphasized the impor- 
tance of early training in hand-work. While its economic bearings have 
been the primary object, the South is beginning to appreciate the educational 
value of industrial training. \It is a hopeful sigh that so many Southern 
educators, editors, and statesmen now advocate the theory that skilled labor 
disciplines the mind and energizes the character; that in applied mechanics, 
to contrive and fit and match, to nicely adapt means to ends, favors pre- 
cision of thought, as well as patience and’ perseverance.\ It is a still more 
auspicious omen that they plead for industrial training as the best cure for 
the old notion that labor is menial, and the tools of the trades are badges 
of servility; for the theory that labor is a degrading drudgery would de- 
mean any artisan, and bar improvement in his art. On the other hand, 
pride and pleasure in one’s work lead to higher excellence, both in his craft 
and character. Blunderers naturally dislike labor in every form, while
-P-A-G-E-629

skill and dexterity foster and facilitate industry. “Industrial education has 
already served to dignify labor and increase its efficiency. It was a grate- 
ful surprise to me to observe such work and its results in Mississippi, the 
State where I had least expected it. I have seen no ladies’ college in the 
South, or the whole country, where so liberal and thorough provisions are 
made for industrial education as at Columbus, Mississippi. This institution, 
started and supported by the State, only six years ago, so manifestly met a 
felt want that at the outset it was filled to its utmost capacity. While its 
primary purpose is a thorough collegiate education, industrial training is 
made essential and very prominent, in order to fit women for special lines 
of work, and open to them new avenues to lucrative employment and to 
usefulness. The industrial department is unusually comprehensive: indus- 
trial and decorative art, repousse, art needle-work, bookkeeping, telegraphy, 
phonography, typewriting, printing, cutting and making dresses, cooking, 
laundry work, and housekeeping. By the liberality of the State, tuition is 
free, and board at cost, which, by reason of the housework done by the 
students, is very low. President Jones says (as the result of his five years of 
observation here): “The acquirement of skill and dexterity in some useful 
craft has an evident educational value for these young ladies, and thereby 
intellectual work becomes more cheerful, hopeful, and successful.” The 
number in attendance when I visited this institution was about 400. They 
were manifestly enthusiastic in their work, and especially appreciated these 
facilities and opportunities for industrial training, evidently feeling that 
they were the favored daughters of Mississippi, while so many applicants 
had been rejected for want of room. The rapid growth and great success of 
this college have exceeded the expectations of its friends, and made it a 
model for other States. 
The Tougalow University in Mississippi, founded twenty years ago by 
the American Missionary Association, for colored youth of both sexes, has 
given such prominence to industrial training that its graduates are recog- 
nized as an uplifting force among their own people. I have heard from 
white citizens in central Mississippi, strong testimony as to the valuable 
lessons which Tougalow Uniyersity has given to the farmers and planters in 
varied husbandry, and in stock-raising. The ability, skill, and self-reliance, 
of some female graduates were cited, six years ago, as an effective argument 
in favor of opening by the State the Ladies’ College, at Columbus. Mis- 
sissippi has also an Agricultural-Mechanical College, which is already re- 
garded as a great success, especially in its devotion to the interests of 
agriculture; so that, for want of room, it has twice the number of applicants 
that can be received. 
The best provision for manual training is found at Tulane University, 
New Orleans, under the wise administration of President Wm. Preston 
Johnson. Though it is but five years since the institution was established, 
here are already the broadest foundations for industrial education among 
40—N. E. A.

the whites to be found in the South. President Johnson says: “In our 
special condition in Louisiana, where manual training has been almost 
wholly neglected, and where the demands are urgent for an education that 
will enable our more intelligent youth to take the lead in industrial enter- 
prises of every kind, we are pursuing a policy, which, though practical, is 
neither sordid nor narrow, but essentially liberal and wise. Manual train- 
ing is an integral part of the general education offered our pupils, thus se- 
curing the benefits of physical training, directing these at the same time to 
useful ends. Hence manual training is made compulsory on all students 
who enter the high-school and college mechanical course. This compulsory 
feature, which recognizes labor, dignifies it. It is not intended to teach 
trades to young men, but to make them experts in the principles and handi- 
craft of wood-work, iron-working, and machine construction. The appli- 
ances in our workshops are as nearly perfect, and the scheme of instruction 
is as thorough, as in any institution in the United States, so that our students 
may be better prepared for the battle of life, and with a higher conception 
of the dignity of labor.” 
Coming from a representative of an eminent and aristocratic family of the 
South, this advocacy of the dignity of labor, and of the importance of in- 
dustrial education as the means of creating that sentiment, is striking and 
hopeful. These arguments and their successful application in the Tulane 
University have exerted a wide influence in the South. The first year that 
manual training was made obligatory, only six malcontents, out of about 
200, resigned rather than submit to do “work beneath a gentleman.” 
Since that first year, there has been no opposition or objection to such work. 
My space forbids describing or even naming all the colleges and schools now 
giving manual training. Ten’ Southern States have organized an agricul- 
tural and mechanical department in connection with their State universities. 
Virginia, Kentucky, Alabama, Mississippi, and Texas now support separate 
agricultural and mechanical colleges. The admirable industrial department 
of Washington University, St. Louis, is well known. The Miller Institute, 
in Albemarle county, Virginia, and the School of Technology, at Atlanta, 
Georgia, are among the leading new institutions of this kind. 
The need of industrial education at the South is greatest with the colored 
people. Freedom brings its perils as well as privileges. To them as slaves, 
labor was menial and demeaning, and a life of ease and indolence was their 
ideal of freedom. For them it is a long step to reach the true idea of the 
dignity of labor, and its vital relations to thrift and virtue, and to all human 
excellence and progress. Emancipation meant a millennium of ease, as well 
as of independence. They did not realize that yoluntary industry and virtue 
are as near akin as idleness and crime. In slavery there was little chance 
or motive for economy, thrift, or foresight; for self-support was unnecessary, 
if not impossible. Take no thought for the morrow, was literally the rule. 
The horizon was bounded by to-day. Corn, cotton, tobacco, or sugar being 
 
-P-A-G-E-631

the staples, the great majority, as field hands, had only simple and monoto- 
nous work, and learned to do nothing else. Hence they need industrial 
training far more than the whites. The whole South is now learning the 
need of more diversified husbandry, as well as more varied trades and manu- 
factures. The colored youth in schools, and especially in the many excel- 
lent institutions aided by Northern philanthropy, like Fisk University in 
this city (Nashville), should be prepared to be leaders in this great move- 
ment. It is a good sign, that they are beginning to feel its importance, and 
take to tools easily and eagerly. In many happy instances I have seen how 
skilled industry ¢ed/s on their manhood, on their self-respect, self-reliance, and 
selfsupport. When among the colored people one hears touching stories of 
toils, struggles and successes told with such an air of conscious triumph as 
wins your admiration of their genuine heroism, for .true heroes are often 
found in the humblest walks of life. 
I was specially interested in hearing one of the ablest and most influen- 
tial editors in the whole South say: “The hope of the colored man in the 
South lies in education, especially in agricultural, mechanical, and technical 
education. Great strides have been made by the colored race during the 
last few years, and now their advancement goes hand in hand with the ad- 
vancement and prosperity of the whole Southern country.” 
No institution has done so much to achieve this great result, and to pro- 
mote this sentiment, as the Normal and Agricultural Institute, at Hampton, 
Virginia. The power of industrial education to elevate such a race has had 
a better and fuller illustration than was ever given elsewhere in the same 
limits of time. A review of the last twenty years’ work at Hampton shows 
most remarkable results in both industrial and school training. As one of 
the trustees at the outset, I know well its early history, and have watched 
its later progress with increasing interest. .There has here been a close 
interdependence between the shop and the school-room. Every scholar is 
required to learn some productive trade or industry, and all receive fair 
wages for their work. Many poor students pay their own way. Thus, last 
year about 500 students earned and were paid nearly $50,000. These earn- 
ings are a moral as well as material advantage to them. The prime ques- 
tion is not, what the student can do for the shop and the farm, but what 
they can do for him in increasing his productive power. Thus many poor 
students who pay their school-bills in labor, make their poverty a means of 
grace, for through this training in self-help come skill, character, conscious 
power, and success. The influence of Hampton is not measured by the sta- 
tistics of its 600 students, or over 600 graduates, or its 2,000 students not 
completing the full course, nor by the 800 teachers it has sent out, or the 
. 25,000 youth who now come annually under their instructions. Hampton’s 
best influence has been in two other and most important lines. It is recog- 
nized as a model for the scores of kindred schools sinée established so widely 
through the South. Still more: Hampton has demonstrated to the country
-P-A-G-E-632
  632 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
the value of the union of work and study, of industrial training and educa- 
tion, especially for the elevation of the colored race. The income of the 
Slater Fund is given only to those schools which provide industrial training. 
The income of the Daniel Hand Fund, of a million, is devoted to primary, 
industrial, and normal education. That fund should be recognized as a 
child of Hampton. Mr. Hand has often told me that it was the success of 
Hampton, and the prominence there given to industrial education, that first 
determined the object of his benefaction. The training there given in varied 
husbandry and constructive carpenteritig has led a large proportion of its 
graduates to acquire land and build homes, and their prosperity, compared 
with the ignorant people around them, furnishes practical and needed object 
lessons. Skilled industry will tend to improve their homes, so often dismal, 
dirty, one-room cabing, where, herding like beasts, the decencies of life can- 
not be. One of their most urgent needs is the improvement of their homes, 
if that rich Saxon word may be applied to their wretched huts, often with 
no chance for light or air, except through an open door, or the chinks in 
the rough boards. 
In all ages, and in all lands, the dwellings of the people have been the 
index of their barbarism or the measure of their civilization. Christianity 
has ever marked its triumphs over paganism by improving the homes of its 
converts. That will prove a practical gospel that shall help the colored 
people to realize that the chief privilege of life is the creation of happy, 
tasteful homes. When such is one’s ideal, and his home becomes his pet 
and pride, life has higher significance and value. Such an ideal brings new 
cheer and inspiration for one’s daily duties. , 
\ Industrial training will lead to the more general ownership of land, as 
well as homes. The negro is getting a passion for the acquisition of land, 
which ought to be encouraged to the utmost; for when he has gained a 
homestead, he has given bonds to society for good behavior. When he 
carries the rewards of honest toil to his own house, he and his gain a new 
lesson of self-respect. The negroes already own over three million acres 
‘of land. Even this wide domain is not a tithe of what they need, and will 
have—for the acquisition of land is the new rage with the race. The vast 
majority are still ignorant, poor, landless hirelings and unskilled laborers. 
Instead of the evils at first apprehended from multiplying small holdings, 
the best people in the South now admit that here is a new element of pros- 
perity to the negro, and of security to all. 
It is a fact of immense significance, that public sentiment in the South is _ 
turning in favor of both the education and manual training of the negroes. 
The Southern people are the natural friends and helpers of the freedmen. 
Once enlisted, they can help in this work as no outsiders can do. The gift 
of seventeen millions of dollars from the North since the war, for the 
education of the negro, is a grand record of Christian philanthropy; but 
Southern tax-payers are doing still more by maintaining 16,000 free colored

schools, at an annual cost of over three millions of dollars. Since 1868 the 
Southern States have appropriated $37,000,000 to support common and 
normal schools for colored people. Of this sum, over ninety per cent. has 
come out of the pockets of the whites. Instead of reproaches for the dead 
issues of the past, let us, forgetting those things that are behind, press for- 
ward to those better things that are before. This great work is only just 
begun, and there is an urgent demand for all that both the North and South 
can do. Never before in the history of the world did any Christian nation 
have within itself so large and promising a field of truly missionary work, the 
opportunity of uplifting such a mass of ignorance, and yet so accessible— 
speaking the same language—so plastic, docile, and receptive. 
THE PROGRESS OF MANUAL TRAINING. 
(2NFoRMAL DIscussION.] 
In reporting upon the progress made in manual training during the past 
year, Mr. Woopwarp said that he should refer only to such institutions as 
had inaugurated manual work since the San Francisco meeting. 
First comes the splendidly-equipped Cogswell Polytechnic College, in 
San Francisco itself, which has had a most successful year. 
In Oakland, California, Mr. Crawford has introduced manual training 
into his large private school. 
In Salt Lake City, a course in manual training has been added to the 
academy, with good results. A 
Springfield, Massachusetts, has greatly enlarged its facilities for manual 
training, and has introduced a high order of drawing. 
In the public schools of Beardstown, Illinois, regular manual training 
has been introduced. 
In each of the cases mentioned, a graduate of the St. Louis school has 
been employed. 
St. Paul, Minnesota; Albany, New York; Peoria, Illinois; the high school 
of Des Moines, Iowa; and numerous agricultural and mechanical colleges 
of high-school grade, have opened manual-training departments. 
The State Commissioner appointed by the Governor of Pennsylvania has 
recommended that manual-training classes be organized in connection with 
all high schools in.the State. 
Movements are on foot in a hundred towns ‘and cities, to the same end. 
The great and most serious difficulty in all such cases, is the lack of prop- 
erly-trained teachers. There is to-day in session in Toledo a small summer 
school, in which experienced teachers are learning the nature and methods 
of teaching manual training. 
Mr. Woodward urged all the friends of manual training to cultivate fel-

lowship with each other; to communicate experience and new ideas through 
the press; and to support such stanch friends as The Teacher, of New York 
City. 3 
Mr. Merwyy, being called upon to report for the city of Brooklyn, New 
York, said that much interest had been excited on this subject, but that 
“caution had to be exercised in order to avoid dangers to which any precipi- 
tation might subject them. Application had been made to the board of esti- 
mates for an appropriation of ten thousand dollars to aid the work. Whether 
the appropriation had been or would be allowed, he could not say. He also 
said that the Pratt Institute was properly an industrial school; the girls 
being taught cooking, dress-making, etc., and the boys various trades. In 
answer to the question, “ How much money has been given to this institution 
by Mr. Pratt?” the speaker could not say exactly, but thought he must cer- 
tainly have given several hundred thousand dollars. 
Miss Emma Marwepet, of San Francisco, gave an account of the new 
education in Germany, where she had lately studied this work and its con- 
nection with the kindergarten. Manual training in the schools is a higher 
development of the occupations of the kindergarten. There is a “missing 
link” between the two which it must be the work of the future to supply. 
There should be introduced into the schools exercises in manual training 
adapted to conduct the child from the age at which he leaves the kinder- 
garten to the time when he may be admitted to the use of the simplest tools 
of the workshop. The extension of Froebel’s system into manual training 
has already been introduced in many schools. 
In the absence of anyone who could more properly represent the progress 
of manual training in the schools of New York City, Mr. Rickorr said 
that under the authority of the Board of School Commissioners, manual 
training had been introduced into more than twenty of the large schools, . 
with such satisfactory results that it was now proposed to introduce it into 
all the primary and grammar schools. He had visited some of the schools 
in which it had been introduced, and was well pleased with the results. He 
mentioned especially some excellent work in a school in Vandewater street, 
the principal of which is Mr. O'Neil. One boy —a little Italian bootblack, 
some ten or eleven years old—had planned and cut a cube with a square 
pyramid on each face, out of a single piece of stiff paper, and this without 
any assistance. There was much other excellent work heaped up on side- 
tables. Those teachers who have large, airy school-rooms, and complain of 
want of conveniences for such work, ought to see the cramped accommoda- 
tions of this school. The principal said that his pupils, though younger, 
advanced evenly with the pupils of the same grades in other schools in the 
respective studies. They were more interested in the work of the regular 
program.   
Mr. Crawrorp spoke of the commission appointed by the Governor of 
Pennsylvania, as being favorable to the introduction of manual training
-P-A-G-E-635
  PROGRESS OF MANUAL TRAINING. 635 
  
into the schools of the State. It recommends especially its introduction into 
the high schools. The report of this commission is a voluminous one, and 
is of great value. 
Gro. W. McAnprew said that manual training had been effectually in- 
troduced into the normal school of the city of New Haven, and that the 
graduates of that school would be able to take up the work in the schools 
to which they might be appointed. 
Mr. Bemis said that in a recent visit to Philadelphia, one of the assistant 
superintendents had directed his attention to the improved appearance of the 
children as to the mending and condition of their clothing. The girls who 
had been taught sewing at school willingly helped, and even volunteered 
their services, in caring for the clothing of the rest of the home circle, so 
that a marked gain in civilization had resulted. Mr. Bemis also spoke of a 
conversation with Superintendent MacA llister, in which the latter said that 
manual training had been such a success that he proposed, in a year or two, 
to introduce it among ten or twelve thousand girls in the two higher gram- 
mar grades; and also to give the boys, of all the grammar grades, work in 
plaster and drill in the use of a knife until they were old,enough to handle 
ordinary tools, when the latter would be used. 
Mr. Taaearz, of Minneapolis, said that Dr. Bradley, the superintendent, 
had submitted the question of manual training in the schools of that city. 
It has already been inaugurated in the high school, and it will soon be in- 
troduced in the two grammar schools.

  EVOLUTION OF SYSTEMS OF DRAWING. 641 
  
PAPERS, 
EVOLUTION OF SYSTEMS OF DRAWING IN THE UNITED 
; STATES. 
[PRESIDENT’s ADDRESS.] 
LANGDON 8. THOMPSON, JERSEY CITY, NEW JERSEY. 
In the early history of teaching drawing to young children in this country, 
about all that was done was to place a figure of some kind before the child 
and-ask or require him to copy it. Thoughtful teachers and parents soon 
discovered that there is but little that is educational in such work—that 
only a few are successful; and they naturally said that the teaching of draw- 
ing as they understood it was only a waste of precious time. Hence this 
method of teaching drawing by the mere imitation or copying of a figure or 
a picture, frequently beyond the comprehension of the child, is now an ex- 
ploded idea, although it may still be in use in some parts of our country. 
Thoughtful teachers and educators, still believing in the educational value 
of teaching drawing to little children, began to reason, to analyze, and to 
experiment on the subject. They looked over the alphabet of graphic ex- 
pression and discovered that straight lines and curves constitute the simple 
elements of most all the drawing that can profitably be done by little chil- 
dren. They reasoned further that children must be masters of these elements 
before they can use them in drawing. Hence they said, “ We will have the 
children practice on vertical, straight. lines one after another until they can 
make them well; then on horizontal lines, oblique lines, and curves, in va- 
rious positions.” 
These exercises were followed by combinations of straight lines, form- 
ing angles, triangles, quadrilaterals of various kinds, polygons, ete. This 
method seemed philosophical and logical at first view, and most of the 
elementary-drawing systems began in that way, five, ten, or fifteen years ago. 
In practice, however, it was found that after a child had made one verti- 
cal straight line, it had no inner spontaneous motive for making another 
vertical line along side of it; hence, after making one such line, it made 
others because the teacher required it to do so—that is, as a mere task. 
The same experience was passed through in practicing on horizontal and 
oblique lines, on curves, angles, triangles, squares, circles, and polygons. 
The child became tired out and disgusted with the whole subject of drawing 
before he was allowed to make anything that he wanted to make. This 
method, while not entirely wrong in philosophy, was wrong in practice, and 
proved unsatisfactory to pupils, teachers, and parents.
-P-A-G-E-642
  642 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  
Again the thinkers and philosophers came to the rescue. They said, there 
has been too much analysis, too much abstraction; and so, following the 
tendency of mind in general when dissatisfied with its present position, they 
went to the opposite extreme, and said, we must draw entirely from concrete 
or solid objects. This is the craze that is just now passing over the country. 
To be able to draw from objects—that is, solids—is certainly a very de- 
sirable acquisition; hence there is a fascination in the announcement, “ We 
will draw from objects.” What is an object? In this connection it means 
a solid; a material object, having length, breadth, and thickness. But what 
objects shall we use? A small minority say take anything that interests 
the child—a dog, a cat, any animal, a flower, a plant, a house, or even a 
steam-engine, as we have heard one enthusiast say. Others who have had 
more experience, or who are more philosophical, say no; not these; but let 
us begin with geometrical solids, such as the sphere, the cube, the cylinder, 
ete. A fair trial, however, with either of these classes of objects with little 
children and our ordinary teachers, has always shown, and will always show, 
that only the geniuses, who are always “few and far between,” can make 
anything like creditable representations of solids or objects of three dimen- 
sions. Hence, the advocates of object-drawing have been driven to abandon 
the essence of médel-drawing, while still clinging to the fascinating name. 
If you will go into one of these primary schools where the so-called object- 
drawing is taught, this is what you will find: The teacher holds up or pre- 
sents a cube, and asks the pupils to draw a front view of it. The pupils 
have previously learned that the real shape of one face of the cube isa 
square; hence, from memory, they all draw a square. We say from mem- 
ory, because only one pupil in the room can possibly see the face of a cube 
as a square, and it is probable that not one can do so. But the teacher an- 
swers, each pupil may have a cube which he can hold in such a way as to 
see asquare. Very well; we will suppose that each pupil has a cube and 
holds it so that he can only see a square, and that he draws what he sees. 
He is then only drawing from the flat, and not from the solid, because he 
sees no solid; he only sees a surface of two dimensions, and this he could 
see just as well from a square drawn on the blackboard or in his book. But 
the enthusiast still answers, the child is pleased and stimulated, because his 
square is the representation of a real thing, a solid. My answer is, that 
here is the great deception: this square that the child has drawn is not in 
any sense a representation or a picture of acube. Any characteristic draw- 
ing of a cube must show that it is a solid—must show that it has three 
dimensions. A square can be no more the picture of a cube than it is of 
millions of square prisms of all imaginable dimensions and proportions. 
Perhaps you ask, what does the square represent? It only represents itself. 
“It is an entity independent of all cubes and square prisms. Cubes and square 
prisms depend for their existence on the square, but the square does not de-

EVOLUTION OF SYSTEMS OF DRAWING. 643 
  
Further, in this same primary school where object-drawing is said to be 
taught, the teacher presents a cylinder and asks the pupils to draw a front 
view of it, and the pupils draw a rectangle'of some kind. The children do 
not see a rectangle, and cannot see one unless the cylinder happens to be 
just as long as the distance between their eyes and the axis is placed parallel 
with a line joining the eyes. This rectangle, then, cannot possibly be a 
picture of an ordinary right cylinder. A characteristic drawing of a right 
cylinder, to be recognized as such, must contain at least one ellipse; gener- 
ally, however, it contains two. . 
We might present other examples of model-drawing, falsely so. called, 
but these are sufficient to show that its advocates have really abandoned 
the essential thing in object-drawing in primary schools, and are only cling- 
ing to the name because, perhaps, it fascinates pupils, parents and teachers 
who have not yet discovered its falsity. 
In this connection, we desire to call attention to a popular arrangement 
of the subjects pertaining to drawing that should be taught in public schools; 
here it is: Constructive Drawing, Representative or Pictorial Drawing, and 
Decorative Drawing. This looks well on paper, and sounds well to the ear; 
but it will not bear philosophical investigation, nor will it in the end stand 
the test of practical experience. The natural order of form-study, which 
only needs to be stated to be understood, is as follows: 
1. The making of real objects in three dimensions, as they exist in space — 
that is, the forming of objects in some kind of matter. 
2. The decoration of real objects. 
3. The representation, or the pictorial drawing, of real objects. 
Schools are the artificial product of an artificial state of society. We 
cannot do in the schools everything that the race has done outside of them. 
‘We may, however, introduce some types of the different kinds of activities 
that have occupied the energies of the race. 
Under the first head, for instance, we cannot make many things, but we 
can model the types of all things in clay, and make them of cardboard 
and sheet-metal. 
After the making of a thing, the natural order is to decorate it. This 
calls forth exercise of the taste; and its cultivation is the most practical 
and valuable result of the proper study of drawing. 
After an object is made and decorated, the third and most abstract step 
of all is to draw the object pictorially on a flat surface. Even a slight ac- 
quaintance with history will convince one that this has been the world’s 
order of evolution or development. 
The question will now be asked, “‘ What is to be done with constructive 
drawing?” If constructive drawing is to come into any schools except the 
technical schools, it should come last, and not first. It is an arbitrary lan- 
guage, founded on descriptive geometry. It is not drawing, properly so 
called, any more than hieroglyphics is drawing. It is true there is a certain 
 
-P-A-G-E-644
  644 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  
mechanical kind of drawing about it; but so there is in the production of 
hieroglyphics; so there is drawing in the writing of the Hebrew, the Greek, 
the Latin, the English, or any other language containing symbolical char- 
acters. Constructive drawing—that is, the drawing of plans, elevations, 
sections, etc.—has no place in primary schools. 
Those who place constructive drawing first in order, have mistakenly sup- 
posed (1) that working-drawings are necessary or at least desirable for the 
construction of simple objects; (2) that this kind of drawing prepares the 
way for drawing the appearances of objects; and (3) that it is a convenient 
medium through which to express the facts of form. : 
The answer to all this is as follows: (1) Children cannot make working- 
drawings of objects that they cannot fully conceive beforehand, in which 
case they can make the objects without the drawings. Constructive draw- 
ings are not needed by the person who makes them. (2) The facts of form 
are not necessary for pictorial drawing. Indeed, they stand in the way of 
the child’s progress in this direction. In object-drawing, it is not the facts 
of form that the student needs so much as the facts of appearances. Facts 
of form mislead him at every turn. They induce him to make his ellipses 
too round, and the angles of rectangular objects too nearly like right angles. 
In object-drawing all is illusion: what is long may appear short; what is 
horizontal may appear slanting, or even vertical; and what is curved may 
appear straight; a dine may appear as a point, a plane may look like a line, 
or it may look like an unlimited number of other planes different from itself; 
and a solid may look like a plane, or an unlimited number of other planes, 
different in appearance from any plane the solid may contain. Hence, when 
one would draw an object that is before him he need not ask what it is, nor 
even what is its real shape, but what does it look like? The chief business 
of the teacher of object-drawing is to get the student to forget, for the time 
being, the fact that the circle is rownd, or that the square is square, and get 
him to see appearances as he did when an infant; in other words, to help 
him to regain his power of believing what his eyes reveal to him. (3) Again, 
the facts of form never are and cannot be expressed by drawing. For in- 
stance, the facts of a cube are as follows: six equal square faces; twenty-four 
plane right angles; twelve edges; eight triedral angles. The conventional 
- plane-and-elevation, or working-drawings, consist of only two squares, con- 
taining only eight plane right angles and only eight edges. But even if all 
the above facts could be drawn out on a flat surface, their relations, which 
is the essential fact of a cube, cannot be expressed by drawing. 
Constructive drawings, including orthographic projection, isometric pro- 
jection, cabinet projection, ete., are nothing more than conventional lan- 
guages; not so difficult to learn perhaps as Greek, but nevertheless they 
must be learned before they can be read or written. 
Where then do the facts of form find expression? Not in drawing, but 
in making and modeling. The facts of a cube or any other solid can only
-P-A-G-E-645
EVOLUTION OF SYSTEMS OF DRAWING. 645 
be expressed in three dimensions. It is in clay-modeling that the child 
should express synthetically the facts of form that it has learned analytic- 
ally from seeing and handling the type solids. 
To the careful and philosophical observer, then, it must be evident that 
the true method of teaching drawing and form-study to little children, has 
not yet been evolved or methodically arranged; or if so, that it has not been 
presented to the public. It is just as evident, however, that we are about 
ready for it. These extreme notions about trying to teach drawing entirely 
from solids are already showing their weakness, and we shall soon be ready 
to try a medium course between the niethods of ten years ago and the pres- 
ent; a course that shall be truly educational and truly industrial; and one 
that can be taught by the ordinary teacher, and learned by the mediocre 
pupil. 
Let us in a few paragraphs try to outlinesuch a system of drawing. The 
true method, we think, will follow the natural order of development that .we 
have already laid down: 
1. The Making or modeling of real objects in three dimensions, beginning 
with the type solids, the sphere, the cube, and the cylinder. 
2. The Decoration of real objects, and the drawing of designs as well as 
the invention of them. 
3. The Representation of objects pictorially. 
Under each of these departments’ the work must be both analytical and 
synthetical, as both of these processes are required for complete knowledge. 
Under the first head, the making of objects, the analytical process will 
consist in studying the geometrical type solids as wholes, and finding out by 
touch and sight their component parts. The synthetic side of the work will 
consist in modeling and making these and other solids in three dimensions, 
in clay, wax, putty, paper, wood, etc. Here there will be ample scope for 
the discovery, application and expression of the facts of form. Under this 
head no drawing, properly so called, is needed, nor can it be used to advan- 
tage by little children. 
Under the second head, the decoration of objects, the analytical side will 
consist in the observation, analysis and comparison of beautiful objects, 
figures, and historical ornament. The synthetic side will consist in making 
only a number of designs of various kinds sufficient to fix in mind the gen- 
eral principles of good taste in ornament. It is here that drawing finds its 
proper beginning, such drawing being usually in two dimensions only. 
The outcome of the decorative department of art study will be—(1) the 
cultivation of the taste of the whole people so as to desire the beautiful in 
all their common surroundings; and (2) the development of the few gen- 
iuses necessary to supply the demand for beauty in the household. This is 
a far more desirable and a more practically industrial result than can ever 
be achieved by the constructive or plan-and-elevation drawing. 
Under the third head, the Pictorial Representation of objects, the ana- 
41—n. B.A.  
-P-A-G-E-646
    646 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  
lytical side will consist in the discovery and analysis of the facts of appear- 
ances. The synthetical side will require just enough practice in drawing 
from objects to fix in mind the general principles of perspective, optics, and 
chromatics. The result of the work of this department will be the general 
appreciation of the fine arts by all the people, and the development of those 
who have genius or talent into artists. 
If the preceding general principles are correct, as we believe they are, we 
are ready to understand the place and the purpose of drawing in form-study. 
The beginning of form-study should be from the solid, and it should pro- 
ceed from wholes to parts; from the solid through surfaces; angles, and 
lines, to points; it is essentially analytical. On the contrary, drawing is 
inherently synthetical; it must proceed from parts to wholes. 
Again, the object of form-study from solids is to excite thought, to find 
mind, to recognize purpose and design. The purpose of drawing, if it is to 
be educative, is to express thought, ideas, mind. Ideas or thoughts about 
what? All kinds of thoughts cannot be expressed by drawing. What class 
of thoughts should we attempt to express by drawing? Evidently thoughts 
about space, or limited portions of space. Limited portions of space must 
have relations to other limited portions; that is position. What is the 
proper visible expression for location or position? A dot, or a point. 
We may reason in another way. The alphabet of graphic expression, 
which includes painting, consists of dots, lines, figures, light, shade, and 
color. The last analysis of any or all of these when studied as forms, is a 
point, which may be represented by a dot. The point, then, is the extreme 
limit or the end of all form-study; while the dot, which represents the point, 
becomes the first step in the synthetic process of form-study by drawing. 
Again, Nature herself suggests the dot as the beginning of synthetic work.. 
When she would create or build up organic life, she begins with a cell, a 
germ, an egg, a seed, a central point, if you please, and sends out radiations 
from it upward, downward, sidewise. 
Having now found a starting-point for drawing proper, we are ready to 
carry the pupil synthetically through dots, lines, figures, light, shade, and 
color. Perhaps some one will now say this is the method of procedure pro- 
nounced a failure in the early part of this paper. But what we now pro- 
pose is not the same as that previously condemned. We now propose to use 
the elements of drawing not only to express thought, but in such a way as 
to stimulate thought. How can this be done? Suppose the child has a 
slate or a piece of paper; he is asked to place a dot at the center of it. If 
now he is asked to place a dot a certain distance above the center, he gener- 
ally has a spontaneous thought to place a dot the same distance below, left 
and right of the center. If, however, the thought is not spontaneous, he 
sees the propriety of it when it is suggested, and is pleased with the result. 
A similar method may be pursued with lines and figures of all kinds, as is 
shown in almost any of the practical exercises known in the schools.

THE TRUE INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION. 647 
  
ART EDUCATION THE TRUE INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION— 
A CULTIVATION OF ASSTHETIC TASTE OF 
UNIVERSAL UTILITY. 
BB W. T. HARRIS, CONCORD, MASSACHUSETTS. 
fv. : 
We have heard much said on the subject of industrial training in recent 
years. It would seem that there is no educational subject that occupies the 
mind of the public more extensively at the present time. There is, how- 
ever, not an entire agreement among its agitators as to the exact nature of 
the education demanded for industry. It is the object of my paper to assist 
in clearing up this question of the best form of training for profitable work 
in the industries. 
One will concede at the start, that tool-work is valuable as industrial 
training; and that especially the course of study and work in the manual- 
training school is valuable because it teaches/how to manufacture tools and 
machines of all kinds, and thereby gives the laborer a sort of command over 
the instruments of industry that assists him very much in his struggle for 
excellence in the fields of labor.) : 
Still more valuable must we regard the study of natural science, and es- 
pecially of applied mathematics, in the laws of matter and motion. It fur- 
nishes the theory of all machinery and of all production of supplies from 
nature. : 
Besides this, we may claim that general education is of the utmost im- 
portance, opening as it does the powers of thought and observation, giving 
each laborer an insight into human nature, and fitting him for logical think- 
ing on all subjects; fitting him alike to lead others and combine them in 
extensive undertakings, and likewise to serve faithfully and intelligently 
other leaders, when the case requires. This general education is indeed 
indispensable to the citizen and to the best quality of industrial people. 
But esthetic education—the cultivation of taste, the acquirement of 
knowledge on the subject of the origin of the idea of beauty (both its his- 
toric origin and the philosophical account of its source in human nature), 
the practice of producing the outlines of the beautiful by the arts of draw- 
ing, painting and modeling, the criticism of works of art, with a view to dis- 
cover readily the causes of failure or of success in zesthetic effects—all these 
things we must claim form the true foundation of the highest success in the 
industries of any modern nation. The dynamic side is needed; but inven- 
tion of the useful does not succeed in controlling the markets of the world. 
A nation with its laborers all educated: in their taste for beautiful forms 
will give graceful shapes to their productions, and command higher prices 
for them. The graceful shape and the proper ornamentation charm the

purchaser, and he willingly pays a higher price for the beautiful article of 
usefulness, if it is made by an artist, than if it is made by a mere artisan. 
On another occasion I have called attention to the backward state of 
Swedish education in esthetic art. (Sweden is the leader in the manual- 
training movement, but her educators have not yet seen the importance of 
developing correct taste among the laborers as a condition of industrial 
success. Accordingly we find that ingenuity is increasing to some extent 
in that country, but that there is no improvement in the artistic finish and 
ornamentation of their goods. Clumsy shapes and incongruous ornament 
are the characteristics of Swedish goods. Other nations do not want such 
ugly shapes in sight, and do not buy them) To have ugly utensils per- 
petually in view gradually works degéneration in one’s taste. The figures 
of our commercial reports show that we import raw materials from Sweden, 
but do not buy their manufactures. In the official report of commerce and 
navigation of the United States for 1881, the imports from Sweden and 
Norway are reported as pig iron, $111,176; bar iron, $517,959; old and 
scrap-iron, $114,883; total, $744,018. But of manufactures of iron and 
steel, only $111,749 are reported. It is surprising to note that we imported 
wood manufactures from them only to the small amount of $137, while we 
imported rags for paper manufacture to the amount of $39,090 — but no man- 
ufactured clothing to speak of! Thesame year Belgium sent us wood man- 
ufactures to the value of $118,146, or nearly one thousand times the value 
of the same item from Sweden and Norway! 
(Mn 1851, at the World’s Exposition in London, it became evident that 
English industries were not of such a character as to compete with those of 
France and Belgium) Prince Albert, wise and thoughtful as he was, set 
about a deep-reaching system of education that should correct the national 
defect, and recover the prestige of British arts and manufactures. The 
South Kensington Museum was established, and day and evening art schools 
set up in all manufacturing centers. The museum placed at its foundation 
a collection of works of art showing the history of art, its beginnings, its 
high-water marks, and its fluctuations. On this basis instruction was given 
in those forms of ornamentation that the world has pronounced beautiful. 
There began from this time a gradual rise in the taste of the English work- 
man; from being an artisan pure and simple he began to be an artist. 
England has gone forward rapidly in the direction of producing works of 
taste, and her useful manufactures, heretofore made without reference to 
beauty, have improved in tastefulness of design and execution. 
The establishment of a great national art gallery, the Louvre, and the 
studies of French savants in the canons of good taste, had long before rey- 
olutionized French manufactures, and given France the supremacy in the 
world-market for goods that command high prices and ready sale. 
Taking hint from England, we have had in this country something of the 
fever for education in art, especially in the lines of industrial drawing.

  ' THE TRUE INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION. 649 
  
Remarkable as has been our progress in the matter, yet there is a prevalent 
lack of insight into the true direction and significance of this branch of in- 
dustrial drawing. We have had much stress laid on geometric drawing 
and the construction of working-drawings, as well as the old-fashioned sys- 
tem of drawing pictures of objects, and we have had much invention of 
original. designs, founded on the basis of regularity and symmetry, but we 
have had very little of a really high order of zsthetic. 
In order to explain this statement, I ask your attention to a discussion of 
some general ideas on the theory of art with a view to show the object of art 
and its historical realization. This will help to explain to us why art exer- 
cises and has exercised so much influence in the world, and why it dominates 
still in the market of industrial productions. Wealth demands the esthetic, 
The days of poverty may be satisfied with the useful. 
Let us inquire into the scope of art and see its function, whether serious 
or trivial, whether elevating or degrading to the soul. Let us study it, in 
short, in its relations to religion as well as in its relations to industry, be- 
cause only in this serious aspect can it justify for itself its high place in the 
esteem of mankind. : 
There is the theory that the primary function of art is amusement. What 
makes this degrading theory plausible is the fact that there is sensuous en- 
joyment in the contemplation of works of art. But if we analyze this effect 
we shall trace even it to something higher than sensuous sources. 
The sensuous elements in art are ReauLARiry, Symmerry, and Har- 
MONY. 
1. Regularity is recurrence of the same—mere repetition. A rude peo- 
ple sc¢arcely reaches a higher stage of art. The desire for amusement is 
gratified by a string of beads or a fringe of some sort. It is a love of rhythm. 
The human form divine does not seem ‘beautiful to the savage. It is not 
regular enough to suit his taste. He must accordingly make it beautiful 
by regular ornaments, or by deforming it in some way; by tattooing it, for 
example. 
Why does regularity please? Why does recurrence or repetition gratify 
the taste of the child or savage? The answer to this question is to be found 
in the generalization that the soul delights to behold itself, and that human 
nature is “ mimetic,” as Aristotle called it, signifying symbol-making. Man 
desires to know himself and to reveal himself, in order that he may com- 
prehend himself; hence, he is an art-producing animal. Whatever sug- 
gests to him his deep, underlying spiritual nature gives him a strange 
pleasure. The nature of consciousness is partly revealed in types and sym- 
bols of the rudest art. Chinese music, like the music of very young chil- 
dren, delights in monotonous repetitions that almost drive frantic anyone 
with a cultivated ear. But all rhythm is a symbol of the first and most 
obvious fact of conscious intelligence or reason. Consciousness is the know- 
ing of the self by the self. There is subject and object, and the activity of  
-P-A-G-E-650
  650 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  
recognition. From subject to object there is distinction and difference, but 
with recognition sameness or identity is perceived, and the distinction or 
difference is retracted. What is this simple rhythm from difference to iden- 
tity but regularity? It is, we answer, regularity, but it is much more than 
this. But the child or savage delights in monotonous repetition alone, not 
possessing the slightest insight into the cause of his delight. His delight 
is, however, explicable through this fact of the identity in form between 
the rhythm of his soul-activity and the sense-perception by which he per- 
ceives regularity. 
The sun-myth arises through the same feeling. Wherever there is repe- 
tition, especially in the form of return-to-itself, there comes this conscious 
or unconscious satisfaction at beholding it. Hence circular movement, or 
movement in cycles, is the most wonderful of all the phenomena beheld by 
primitive man. Nature presents to his observation infinite differences. Out 
of the confused mass he traces some forms of recurrence: day and night, the 
phases of the moon, the seasons of the year, genus and species in animals 
and plants, the apparent revolutions of the fixed stars, and the orbits of 
planets. These phenomena furnish him symbols or types in which to ex- 
press his ideas concerning the divine principle that he feels to be First 
Cause. To the materialistic student of sociology all religions are merely 
transfigured sun-myths. But to the deeper student of psychology it becomes 
clear that the sun-myth itself rests on the perception of identity between 
regular cycles and the rhythm which characterizes the activity of self-con- 
sciousness. And self-consciousness is felt and seen to be a form of being 
that is not on a par with mere transient, individual existence, but rather 
the essential attribute of the divine being, Author of all. 
Here we see how deep-seated and significant is this blind instinct or feel- 
ing which is gratified by the seeing and hearing of mere regularity. The 
words which express the divine in all languages root in this sense-perception 
and esthetic pleasure attendant on it. Philology, discovering the sun-myth 
origin of religious expression, places the expression before the thing ex- 
pressed, the symbol before the thing signified. It tells us that religions 
arise from a sort of disease in language which turns poetry into prose. But 
underneath the esthetic feeling lies the perception of identity which makes 
possible the trope or metaphor. 
2. Symmetry. Regularity expresses only the empirical perception of the 
nature of self-consciousness and reason. There is, as we have seen, a sub- 
ject opposed to itself as object. Opposition or antithesis is, however, not 
simple repetition, but opposition. The identity is therefore one of symme- 
try, instead of regularity. Symmetry contains and expresses identity under 
difference. We cannot put the left-hand glove on our right hand. The 
two hands correspond, but are not repetitions of the same, It is a mark of 
higher esthetic culture to prefer symmetry to regularity. It indicates a 
deeper feeling of the nature of the divine. Nations that have reached this
-P-A-G-E-651
  
THE TRUE INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION. 651 
stage show their taste by emphasizing the symmetry in the human form by 
ornaments and symmetrical arrangement of clothing. They correct the lack 
of symmetry in the human form in the images of their gods. The face is on 
the front side of the head, but the god shall have a face on the back of his 
head too, to complete the symmetry. The arms directed to the front of the 
body must also correspond to another pair of arms directed in the opposite 
direction. Perhaps perfect symmetry is still more exacting in its require- 
ments, and demands faces with arms to match on the right and left sides of 
the body. To us the idols of the ancient Mexicans and Central Americans 
seem hideous. But it was the taste for symmetry that produced them. 
3. Harmony is the object of the highest culture of taste. Regularity and 
symmetry are so mechanical in their nature that they afford only remote 
symbols of reason in its concreteness. They furnish only the elements of 
art, and must be subordinated to a higher principle. Harmony is.free from 
the mechanical suggestions of the lower principles, but it possesses in a 
greater degree the qualities which gave them their charm. Just as sym- 
metry exhibits identity under a deeper difference than regularity, so har- 
mony, again, presents us a still deeper unity underlying wider difference. 
The unity of harmony is not a unity of sameness, nor of correspondence 
merely, but a unity of adaptation to end or purpose. Mere symmetry sug- 
gests external constraint; but in art there must be freedom expressed. 
Regularity is still more suggestive of mechanical necessity. Harmony 
boldly discards regularity and symmetry, retaining them only in subordi- 
nate details, and makes all subservient to the expression of a conscious pur- 
pose. The divine is conceived as spiritual intelligence elevated above its 
material expression so far that the latter is only a means to an end. The 
Apollo Belvedere has no symmetry of arrangement in its limbs, and yet the 
disposition of each limb suggests a different disposition of another, in order 
to accomplish some conscious act upon which the mind of the god is bent. 
All is different, and yet all is united in harmony for the realization of one 
purpose. Here the human form, with its lack of regularity and symmetry, 
becomes beautiful. The nation has arrived at the perception of harmony, 
which is a higher symbolic expression of the divine than were the previous 
elements. The human body is adapted to the expression of conscious will, 
and this is freedom. The perfect subordination of the body to the will is 
gracefulness. It is this which constitutes the beauty of classic art: to have 
every muscle under perfect obedience to the will—unconscious obedience — 
so that the slightest inclination or desire of the soul, if made an act of the 
will, found expression in the body. .When the soul is not at ease in the 
body, but is conscious of it as something separate, gracefulness departs, and 
awkwardness takes its place. The awkward person does not know what to 
do with his hands and arms; he cannot think just how he would carry his 
body or fix the muscles of his face. He chews a stick or bites a.cigar in 
order to have something to do with the facial muscles, or twirls a cane or
-P-A-G-E-652

twists his watch-chain, folds’ his arms before or behind, or even thrusts his 
hands into his pockets, in order to have some use for them which will re- 
store his feeling of ease in his body. The soul is at ease in the body only 
when it is using it as a means of expression or action. 
Harmony is this agreement of the inner and outer, of the will and the 
body, of the idea and its expression, so that the external leads us directly 
to the internal of which it is the expression. Gracefulness then results, 
and gracefulness is the characteristic of classic or Greek art. Not only its 
statues, but its architecture and architectural ornament, exhibit graceful- 
ness or freedom. 
The Greek religion made beauty the essential feature of the idea of the 
divine, and hence his art is created as an act of worship of the beautiful. 
It represents the supreme attainment of the world in pure beauty, because 
it is pure beauty and nothing beyond. Christianity reaches beyond beauty 
to holiness. Other heathen religions fall short of the Greek ideal, and lack 
an essential element which the Greek religion possessed. The Greeks be- 
lieved that the divine is at the same time human; and human not in the 
sense that the essence of man, his purified intellect and will, is divine, but 
human in the corporeal sense as well. The gods of Olympus possess appe- 
tites and passions like men; they have bodies, and live in a special place. 
They form a society, or large patriarchal family. The manifestation of the 
divine is celestial beauty. Moreover, the human being may by becoming 
beautiful become divine. Hence the Greek religion centers about gymnastic 
games. These are the Olympian, the Isthmean, the Nemean, and the Pythian 
games. Exercises that shall give the soul sovereignty over the body and 
develop it into beauty, are religious in this sense. Every village has its 
games for physical development; these are attended by the people who be- 
come in time judges of perfection in human form, just as a community that 
attends frequent horse-races produces men that know critically the good 
points of a horse. It is known who is the best man at wrestling, boxing, 
throwing the discus, the spear, or javelin; at running, at leaping, or at the 
chariot or horseback races. Then at less frequent intervals there is the con- 
test at games between neighboring villages. The successful hero carries off 
the crown of wild olive branches. Nearly every year there is a great na- 
tional assembly of Greeks, and a contest open to all. The Olympian festival 
at Olympia and the Isthmean festival near Corinth, are held the same sum-_ 
mer;‘then at Argolis, in the winter of the second year afterwards, is the 
Nemean festival; then the Pythian festival near Delphi, and a second Isth- 
mean festival, occur in the spring of the third year; and. again there is a 
second Nemean festival in the summer of the fourth year of the Olympiad. 
The entire people, composed of independent states, united by ties of religion, 
assemble to celebrate this faith in the beautiful, and honor their successful 
youth. .The results carried the national taste for the beautiful as seen in 
the human body to the highest degree.
-P-A-G-E-653
     THE TRUE INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION. 653 
  
The next step after the development of the personal work of art in the 
shape of beautiful youth, by means of the national games and the cultiva- 
tion of the taste of the entire people through the spectacle of these games, 
is the art of sculpture, by which these forms of beauty, realized in the ath- 
letes and existing in the minds of the people as ideals of correct taste, shall 
be fixed in stone and set up in the temples for worship. Thus Greek art was 
born. The statues at first were of gods and demigods exclusively. Those 
which have come down to us cause our unbounded astonishment at this per- 
fection of form. It is not their resemblance to living bodies, not their ana- 
tomical exactness that interests us, not their so-called “truth to nature,” 
but their gracefulness and serenity—their “classic repose.” Whether the 
statues represent gods and heroes in action or in sitting and reclining post- 
ures, there is this “repose”? which means indwelling vital activity and not 
mere rest as opposed to movement. In the greatest activity there is con- 
siderate purpose and perfect self-control manifested. The repose is of the 
soul, and not a physical repose. Even sitting and reclining figures—for 
example, the Theseus from the Parthenon, the torso of the Belvedere—are 
filled with activity, so that the repose is one of voluntary self-restraint and 
not the repose of the absence of vital energy. They are gracefulness itself. 
What a surprising thought is this, of a religion founded on beauty! How 
could it have arisen in the history of the world, and what became of it? 
Let us consider a few of the elements wherein the Greek religion was supe- 
rior to other heathen religions. 
The Hindoo worshipped an abstract unity devoid of all form, which he 
called Brahma. His idea of the divine is defined as the negation not only 
of everything in nature, but also everything human. Nothing that has 
form, or shape, or properties, or qualities—nothing, in short, that can be 
distinguished from anything else, can be divine according to the thought of 
the Hindoo. This is pantheism. It worships a negative might which de- 
stroys everything. If.it admits that the world of finite things arises from 
Brahma as creator, it hastens to tell us that the creation is only a dream, 
and that all creatures will vanish when the dream fades. There can be no 
hope for any individuality, according to this belief. Any art that grows up 
under such a religion will manifest only the nothingness of individuality, 
and the impossibility of its salvation. Instead of beauty as the attribute of 
divinity, the Hindoo studied to mortify the flesh; to shrivel up the body; to 
paralyze rather than develop his muscles. Instead of gymnastic festivals 
he resorted to the severest penances, such as holding his arm over his head 
until it wasted away. If he could produce numbness in his body so that 
all feeling disappeared, he attained holiness. His divine was not divine- 
human, but inhuman, rather. 
The Egyptian laid all stress on death. In his art he celebrated death as 
the vestibule to the next world and the life with Osiris. Art does not get 
beyond the symbolic phase with him. As in the hieroglyphic the picture

of a thing is employed at first to represent the thing, and by-and-by it be- 
comes a conyersational’sign for a word, so the works of art at first represent 
men and gods, and afterwards become conventional symbols to signify the 
ideas of the Egyptian religion. The great question to be determined is 
this: What destiny does it promise the individual, and what kind of life 
does it command him to lead? The Egyptian symbolizes his divine by the 
processes of nature that represent birth, growth and death, and resurrec- 
tion, and hence conceive life as belonging to it. The course of the sun— 
its rising and setting, its noonday splendor, and its nightly eclipse; the suc- 
cession of the seasons—the germination, growth and death of plants; the 
flooding and subsidence of the Nile—these and other phenomena are taken 
as symbols expressing the Egyptian conception of the divine living being. 
Finally it rises out of the immediate artistic description by symbols, and 
tells the myth of Osiris killed by his brother Typhon, and of his descent to 
the silent realm of the under-world, and of his there reigning king, and of 
his resurrection. : 
The Indian art, on the contrary, dealt with symbols that were not analo- 
gous to human life. They reverenced mountains and rivers, and the storm- 
winds and great natural forces that were destructive to the individuality of 
man, but also reverenced life in animals. They founded asylums for aged 
cows, but not for decrepit humanity. 
Persian art adored light as the divine; it also adored the bodies that give 
light — the sun, moon, and stars; also fire; also whatever is purifying, espe- 
cially water. The Persian religion conceives two deities—a god of light 
and goodness, and a god of darkness and evil. The struggle between these 
two gods fills the universe, and makes all existence a contest. The art of 
the Persian portrays this struggle, and does not let pure human individuality 
step forth for itself. 
In Assyria and Chaldea we have the worship of the sun rather than of 
pure light. Hence there were artificial hills or towers constructed, with 
ascending inclined planes on the outside rising to the flat top, crowned with 
a temple dedicated to Belus, or the Sun-god. Images partly human, partly 
animal, represented the divine. The lion, the eagle, the quadruped and 
bird, the human face, these were united to make the symbol of a divine be- 
ing who could not be manifested in a purely human form. 
The Egyptian religion, though it surpassed the Persian in that it con- 
ceived the divine as much more near human life, still resorted to animal 
forms to obtain the peculiarly divine attributes. There were the sacred 
bulls Apis and Mnevis, the goat of Mendes, sacred hawks and ibis, and such 
divinities as Isis-Hathor, with a cow’s head; Touaris, with a crocodile’s head; 
Thoth, with the head of an ibis; Horus, with the head of a hawk; but Am- 
mon, and Pthah, and Osiris, with human heads and bodies. Thus we see 
that the Egyptian wavered between the purely human and the animal form 
as the image of the divine. So long as it is possible for a religion to permit
-P-A-G-E-655

the representation of the divine by an animal form, that religion has not 
yet conceived God as pure self-consciousness or reason. Its art cannot ar- 
rive at gracefulness. As a consequence of this defect, however, it cannot 
account for the origin and destiny of the world in such a way as to explain 
the problem of the human soul. It is an insoluble enigma whose type is a 
sphinx. The Sphinx is the rude rock out of which it rises, symbolizing in- 
organic nature; then the lion’s body, typifying by the king of beasts the 
highest of organic beings below man; then the human face, looking up in- 
quiringly to the heavens. Its question seems to be: “Thus far: what next?” 
Does the human break the continuity of the circle of nature within which 
there goes on a perpetual revolution of birth, growth, and decay, or does 
the human perish with the animal and plant and lose his individuality? 
How can his individuality be preserved without the body? The Egyptian’s 
highest thought was this enigma. He combined the affirmative and nega- 
tive elements of this problem, conceiving that man survives death but will 
have a resurrection and need his particular body again, which, therefore, 
must be preserved by embalming it. The body of Osiris had to be em- 
balmed by Isis. The sacred animals, bulls, and others, were embalmed 
upon death. 
They had not learned that the image of God is man, and, more definitely, 
man’s reason or self-consciousness. It was a great step beyond the heathen 
religion of Asia and Africa, therefore, for the Greek religion to conceive 
the divine as dwelling in human form, however defective it was in respect 
to its doctrine of the particular attributes of man that are the true image of 
God. Hence we have the explanation why it is that Greek art has become 
the conventional expression of the beautiful for all the civilized world. It 
alone aims at the expression of personal freedom in the body, and therefore 
always achieves gracefulness. Christian art as such strives to show the 
soul as struggling to free itself from the body. All cultivated peoples will 
prefer ornament and works of art that show the triumph of the soul over 
matter to the manifestation of the predominance of matter or the struggle 
of the soul to free itself. Art studies should therefore find their center in 
the history of Greek art.

SCHOOL, WITH APPLICATIONS.

The subject of this paper is the study of form in the common schools. The 
author of it was informed early, by three different officials, that the presen- 
tation of it must not occupy over thirty minutes. Owing to the brief time 
thus allotted, it is necessary to omit all discussion of the need, the propriety,  
-P-A-G-E-656
  656 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  
and the feasibility of the study, and also all direct suggestions as to proper 
methods of instruction. The discussion is confined, therefore, to the subject- 
matter proper to be presented in the study, and to the application of the 
knowledge acquired in a few practical and convenient ways. No apology is 
offered for referring directly to the schools that are under the supervision of 
the author in this subject, and presenting the matter as it is already worked 
out in them, with the suggestion of such additional features as it is proposed 
to add in the near future. i 
In the first and second years of school, an ample supply of models of all 
the simple geometrical solids and tablets illustrating the plain geometrical 
figures is furnished to the children, so that the type-forms can be studied by 
touch as well as by sight. Systematic and graded exercises in handling the 
models and tablets are given to develop ideas of surface, contour, faces, edges, 
and corners; also of location, position, distance, direction, size, proportion, 
and appearance. Exercises in building with the solids, and laying the tab- 
lets to produce symmetry and beauty of form and arrangement, are also 
given. One lesson per week in modeling is given, the aim being to produce 
in clay all these type-forms, and other simple objects that are similar to 
them in form. Free scope is also given to design or original work in model- 
ing in these grades, and the results are very satisfactory. The interest taken 
by the teachers in the modeling, and the fidelity with which the exercises 
are given, contribute much to the success of this branch of the work. 
Along with the exercises in handling the models and tablets and the 
modeling, lessons are given from the first on slates, on the blackboards, and 
on paper. These lessons begin with drill exercises intended to secure cor- 
rect position of the body and hand, proper holding of the pencil, and free, 
easy movement. These drill exercises are kept up at intervals throughout 
the entire course. Large, bold drawings are made, representing the tablets, 
the faces of the solids, simple objects in flat outline, and plain patterns in 
the geometric forms. The drawings are made mostly from the objects them- 
selves; and the teachers are urged to have drawn the simplest outline only, 
that the children may see the purpose and necessity of every line, and realize 
as fully as may be the connection between the drawing and some real thing. 
The drawing-lessons proper take different forms, depending on the end 
aimed at. We have ‘lessons on the geometrical forms, in which some new 
form is to be learned, or some form learned before is to be reviewed; object 
lessons, in which the drawing is made directly from the object, no copy being 
used; copy lessons, intended to teach the proper way to proceed to copy a 
drawing; dictation lessons, in which the children draw what the teacher 
tells them to draw, without copy; drawing from memory, in which some 
previous lesson is reproduced; design or invention, in which new patterns 
. are made up, or old ones changed or rearranged. 
For supplementary work in drawing in these grades, the teacher keeps on 
her desk a miscellaneous collection of drawing-cards and simple pictures,
-P-A-G-E-657
  FORM-STUDY IN THE COMMON SCHOOLS. 657 
  
mostly some that she has made herself, which the children are encouraged 
to take at suitable times and copy on their slates or on paper, or on the 
blackboard, as best they can. Great care has to be taken, however, in se- 
lecting these copies, that they be not inappropriate, nor too complicated and 
difficult. Watch must also be kept to prevent careless and slovenly habits 
in position, in holding the pencil, and in careful finish. 
To secure the ends desired more fully, paper-folding and cutting is re- 
sorted to. Paper cut into squares, oblongs, and circles, is folded to illustrate 
division into halves, thirds, and fourths, diameters, diagonals, and other 
division lines, and drawings of the papers thus folded are made. Folding 
and cutting exercises, making the standard crosses, stars and other patterns 
are given, and the children are allowed and encouraged to fold and cut pat- 
terns of their own, and make drawings of them. 
In connection with folding and cutting paper, the use of paste is introduced 
in the first year. The cuttings are mounted by the children on rough paper 
or cardboard, or in blank drawing-books. The making of designs in this 
way from colored paper is a fascinating employment, and a source of unend- 
ing pleasure and profit. As further variety in application, the type-forms 
and other kindred designs are made in pease-work, and by laying sticks, 
pegs, and seeds, and the same represented in drawings. The main object in 
these grades, as before intimated, is to develop clear perceptions of form in 
general and to secure a lively appreciation of it, together with the power 
to express it freely and accurately in various ways by modeling, folding, 
cutting ‘and drawing, and by the free use of language. 
In the third and fourth years drawing-books are used, one number sery- 
ing one half-year. The work of the first two years is reviewed, extended, 
enlarged upon, and applied in a well-arranged series of lessons, including 
object-drawing, copy, dictation, memory lessons, and work in design. All 
the work is entirely free-hand. The object-drawing consists in a review of 
the models, adding the frustums of the cone, and of the different pyramids, 
and in the study of a variety of simple objects, with special reference to 
representing them in flat outline in their true proportions. The proportion 
of the dimensions is the element that causes variation in form; therefore 
special attention is given to the proportions of the dimensions and parts of 
objects to one another. Proportions can be more readily apprehended, and 
more fully appreciated by children, when viewed entirely apart from fore- 
shortening; hence no attempt to teach perspective representation is made 
in these grades. The hexagon, the octagon, the pentagon, different forms 
of the spiral, simple examples of historic ornament, and the elementary 
principles of design are treated, accompanied by frequent drill exercises in 
bold, free movement. The pupils are taught how to manage a drawing- 
book and properly care for their drawing material; how and when to use 
an eraser, and to be careful, neat, and systematic in their work; and to ob- 
serve the various stages in the progress of a drawing that is properly made.
-P-A-G-E-658
  658 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  
These stages are: Analysis and study of the proportions; sketching; cor- 
recting the sketch; strengthening the required lines; cleaning, or erasing; 
and lining-in, or finishing. 
The work in modeling is continued in these grades, and consists in a re- 
view of the type-forms, and practice upon a variety of objects suggested by 
these forms, as apples, pears, gourds, vases, pitchers, jugs, cups and saucers, 
and all such things as can be easily procured as models. The hexagon, 
octagon, pentagon, circle, and other forms, are modeled in tablet form; and 
on these leaves, flowers, fruits, animal forms, heads, etc., are moulded in 
high relief and in low relief. Original work in any direction a pupil may 
incline is heartily encouraged. Efforts are made to distinguish the two 
classes of work in modeling—the one to copy a model or object exactly in 
all details and particulars, the other to express in clay an idea or thought 
that isin the mind. In the modeling, as in the drawing, attention is directed 
continually to the proper proportion of the dimensions and parts of the ob- 
jects made. 
Folding and cutting paper, and mounting, are continued and applied to 
all the exercises in the drawing-books to which they are applicable. Meth- 
ods of folding and cutting the hexagon, octagon, pentagon, square, triangle, 
and circle, and all the different stars, foils, and other figures based on these, 
are learned and applied in illustrating simple principles of design, as verti- 
cal and horizontal repetition, repetition around a center, alternation, con- 
trast, and harmony. This work is enjoyed much, both by teachers and 
pupils, and could be rendered yet more pleasing and profitable if we could 
get a supply of suitable paper illustrating the different colors in their true 
standard depths. As supplementary application and further practice in 
these grades, large, bold drawings of a great variety of miscellaneous objects 
and designs are made on blackboard and on paper, illustrating the principles 
taught in the drawing-books. Envelopes, paper sacks, pocket-books, ete., 
are made from pattern drawings carefully executed. It is proposed, also, 
to introduce in these grades embroidery in simple patterns, with needle and 
zephyr or yarn. : 
In the fifth and sixth years the drawing is also entirely free-hand, and 
continual effort is made to secure a bold, graphic result, with a free, easy 
movement. The work, by easy stages of gradation and development, divides 
into three kinds of drawings—construction, representation, and ornament. 
This classification is made on the basis of the object for which the drawings 
are made. 
Construction-drawing expresses by two or more drawings all the dimen- 
sions of a form or object in such a way that it can be made or built from 
the drawings. It includes plain geometry, working-drawings, and construct- 
ive design. Geometry and design come in later on in the higher grades. 
Working-drawings as presented here include geometric views, sections, and 
developments, and are either in full size or on a proportional scale. Geo-
-P-A-G-E-659
  FORM-STUDY IN THE COMMON SCHOOLS. 659 
  
metric views are simply top, front, back, end, or side and bottom views, 
showing all the dimensions in their true length or proportions. 
Sections are drawings showing the internal structure of the object or build- 
ing by representing it as cut through on a given line. Sectional drawings 
are of great importance in machine-drawing, as they show the details which 
play the principal part in the proper working of the machine. Develop- 
ments show the entire surface of an object extended upon a plane. An un- 
derstanding of this kind of drawing is absolutely necessary to all workers 
in tin, sheet-iron or zinc, and in the manufacture of boxes, leather goods, 
shoes, gloves, and all other articles requiring the use of patterns. 
Great care is taken to teach the different lines and conventions of machine 
and mechanical drawings. These are: the full line, used for the visible 
edges; the dash line, representing an edge that is invisible in that particu- 
lar view; the dot-and-dash line, used as the center line from which all 
measurements are made; dotted lines, used as transfer lines, carrying a 
dimension from one view to another; measurement lines, which are placed 
outside of the drawing, upon which the actual dimensions are marked; the 
“figuring,” giving ‘figures in the proper place, indicating the exact size; 
vertical half-tint, showing foreshortened surfaces oblique to the right, and 
half-tint at forty-five degrees, marking the cut surfaces of a section. These 
construction-drawings, made from day to day by the pupils, could be read 
and used in any workshop in the world where the workmen understand 
drawings. 
Representation or perspective differs from construction-drawing, in that 
it attempts to represent in one drawing all the dimensions of an object in 
such a way as to give its appearance as seen from a given standpoint. This 
feature of the work begins with a careful study of the cylinder and cone, 
and frustum of a cone; developing and illustrating the simplest principles 
in perspective of curvilinear objects, viz., that a circle seen obliquely appears 
elliptical, and that the width of the ellipse varies with the angle at which 
the circle is viewed, and that the axis in all such objects, no matter how 
they are viewed, always appears perpendicular to the long diameter of the 
ellipse. It includes also the first problem in straight-lined perspective, in 
which a rectilinear object is placed directly in front of the eye with one face 
perpendicular to the sight. In this, the principle of convergence and the 
idea of the horizon, the center of vision and the line of sight are brought 
out. These principles are applied in drawing a variety of familiar round 
and straight-lined objects, singly and in groups, as time permits. 
In the line of decoration, leaves, flowers, and other ornamental forms are 
moré carefully studied than in the lower grades. The method of securing 
the general form of an object by the process of “blocking-in” the outline 
is taught, and the principles of conventionalization, bilateral design, and 
surface ornamentation are illustrated in a variety of pleasing exercises. 
Modeling is continued in the fifth year, where the work is similar to that 
 
-P-A-G-E-660
  660 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  
of the lower grades, with such advance as we are able to make. The paper- 
work consists in making the cube, prisms and pyramids, and other ‘objects, 
by drawing the development of their surfaces, and cutting, fitting, and past- 
ing together, and ornamenting the different faces with appropriate designs 
in pencil or colored paper. Advanced work in folding and cutting designs 
for surface ornamentation in colors is practiced. 
In the seventh and eighth years, all the different features of the work as 
presented in the lower grades are continued with more advanced exercises. 
In construction, instruments are used, and some eight or ten of the most im- 
portant, geometrical problems are learned and applied in making working- 
drawings of the pupil’s desk and other objects to ascale. This drawing with 
instruments however is-confined to geometrical problems and designs, and 
to working-drawings that are supposed to be prepared for actual use in the 
shops, and to laying out and subdividing surfaces to be ornamented in more 
advanced work in design. It is not used in any attempt to represent objects 
in perspective, or with pictorial effect, except, probably, the simple applica- 
tion of a ruler, to test critically the convergence of lines, or something of 
that kind. 
Rectilinear objects are turned at various angles in both construction and 
representation, and the most important rules of perspective and foreshorten- 
ing, to which all attempts at the representation of objects must conform, are 
carefully taught. These rules have been derived from a careful study of 
the laws of light and the formation of the visual organs, and are of great 
assistance to the beginner in enabling him to overcome any natural de- 
ficiency in his own power of observation. The elements of position and dis- 
tance which enter into all perspective effect (the former determining the 
apparent form and direction of edges and surfaces, the latter affecting the 
apparent size of objects), are applied and studied also in exercises in group- 
ing two or more objects together in one view. This is called composition, 
and apart from all attempts at accuracy in delineation, gives scope to the 
exercise of propriety and skill in arrangement, which are the foundation of 
true merit in pictorial representation. The leading principles to be ob- 
served in composition are variety and contrast in form, size, position, and 
texture; also, wholeness or entirety—giving the idea of unity—and all 
these joined to produce those indescribable effects known as harmony and 
fitness. 
It is in these grades, following a careful.study of the facts of form in ob- 
jects in general in the grades below, that the pupils are able to draw directly 
from miscellaneous objects, either singly or in groups, with intelligence and 
success. As the rules and principles of perspective relate to the difference 
between the reality and the appearance in objects, it is not only necessary, 
to be able to observe the appearances accurately, but also to be cognizant 
of the realities, in order to appreciate the appearances, and interpret them 
correctly. :
-P-A-G-E-661
  FORM-STUDY IN THE COMMON SCHOOLS. 661 
In decoration, the work is carried on into more elaborate styles of histor- 
ical ornament, and into more advanced practice in designing in general; 
and in decorative treatment of plant forms, for the purpose of filling a given 
space, or ornamenting objects. In these grades, as well as through the en- 
tire course, much attention is given to the study of foliage and flowers from 
nature, both by drawing and modeling. In the lower grades, single leaves 
are used; in the higher grades, clusters and sprays are studied. 
Thus in every stage of our work, constant appeal is made to the natural 
objects and real things that lie on every hand. By critical observation and 
study of these we try to gain clear perceptions of form, and to appreciate 
its beauty and variety, and also to acquire, so far as we can, the power to 
express it by drawing and making. On leaving the district schools, such of 
our pupils as have been reasonably attentive and faithful, have a foundation 
that will serve well as a basis for further work in this line of study, and 
they are well prepared to take up the manual-training work in the high 
schools. . They have a training of eye and hand, and a special discipline of 
mind, that cannot be other than helpful in prosecuting any other branch of 
study, and very useful in all the practical affairs of life. 
[ This paper was illustrated throughout, by specimens gathered from the recent 
work of all grades of the schools. Samples of modeling in clay through the fifth 
year, paper-cutting and mounting in all grades, including ornamentation of simple 
objects on paper, envelopes, pen-wipers, pocket-books, etc., made from pattern 
drawings, and drawings showing the entire course, were exhibited. ]

SECRETARY'S MINUTES. 
FIRST SESSION. 
NasHVILLE, TeNN., Wednesday, July 17, 1889. 
The first session of this Department was called to order at 3 o’clock p.M., 
in the lecture-room of the First Baptist Church; President N. Coe Stewart, 
of Cleveland, Ohio, in the chair. 
The musical program, which was interspersed throughout the regular ex- 
ercises of the afternoon, was opened with solos by Mrs. Blandner, of Nash- 
ville, and Mr. N, L. Glover, of Akron, Ohio, respectively. 
President Stewart then delivered the President’s address. 
A vocal duet, “A Night in Venice,” was next given by Mrs. O. 8. Ingle- 
hart and Miss Fannie Dorman, of Nashville. 
“The Province of Music in Education” was the subject of the first paper 
on the program, by William A. Mowry, of Boston. 
In the absence of Miss J. Ettie Crane, of the State Normal School, Pots- 
dam, N. Y., who was to have followed on the same subject, President Cook, 
of the same institution, spoke on the importance of music in education, and 
referred to his own experience and observation as proving that the regular 
normal schools can and ought to prepare their graduates to teach music in 
the schools properly and successfully. 
He was followed by E. E. White, of Cincinnati, who spoke of the great 
influence of music in the schools for good, and its value in the mental, 
moral, and religious development of the child. He also referred to its 
refining influence in the school and home, and urged its great importance 
and value as a regular branch of study. 
At this point, President Stewart announced that as the hour for closing the 
session had arrived, the remaining exercises of the afternoon’s program 
would be carried over to the session on Friday afternoon, 
On motion of Charles W. Super, a committee of three was appointed, 
consisting of W. H. Dana, Warren, Ohio, O.S. Collins, Xenia, Ohio, and 
J. Dorman, Nashville, Tenn., to consider the recommendations contained in 
the President’s address, and report at the next session. 
The Department then adjourned.

SECOND SESSION.—Juty 19. 
The Department was called to order at 2:30 p.m.; President Stewart in 
the chair. ; 
A change was made in the order of the program of the afternoon, to give 
an opportunity to listen to A. J. Rickoff, of New York City, who was 
obliged to speak at a later hour in another department. 
Mr. Rickoff, who gave the first address of the session, referred to his long 
experience in school-work at Cincinnati, Cleveland, Yonkers, and recently 
in New York City, and spoke at length of the excellent results of school 
music instruction, which had come under his observation, as proving the 
possibilities and value of music as an educational factor. 
Following Mr. Rickoff, a sextette was given by Messrs. N. Coe Stewart, 
A. H. Stewart, N. L. Glover, W. H. Dana, Mrs. A. H. Stewart, and Miss 
McCullough. 
The Secretary of the Department presented the special report on the con- 
dition of music instruction throughout the United States, provided for by 
the Department at its meeting in San Francisco, in 1888. At the conclu- 
sion of the report, the following resolution was adopted: 
Resolved, That this report be accepted, and that it be respectfully recommended 
to the United States Commissioner of Education for publication from the National 
Bureau of Education. 
This was followed by a solo by Miss Emma Johnson. , 
In the absence of A. E. Winship, of Boston, Mr. T. P. Ballard, of 
Columbus, Ohio, read the paper prepared by the former, on “The Relation 
of Music Instruction to our Educational System.” 
“An Outside Musician’s View of Music in the Public Schools” was next 
presented by Mr. W. H. Dana, of Warren, Ohio. 
Supt. W. B. Powell, of Washington, D. C., followed on “Music in the 
Public Schools from the Superintendent’s Standpoint.” 
A solo by Mrs. A. H. Stewart, of Nashville, was next given, after which 
President Stewart announced the following Committee on Nominations: 
W. H. Dana, Ohio; Aaron Gove, Colorado; O. S. Cook, Illinois; N. L. 
Glover, Ohio; W. B. Powell, Washington, D. C. 
A duet then rendered by Ezzie Herman and Maggie Riddle, was heartily 
encored. 
The remaining papers and discussions announced on the program for the 
afternoon were omitted, on account of the lateness of the hour. 
Mr. W. H. Dana, in behalf of the Committee on Nominations, reported 
the following list of officers for the ensuing year: 
President —Herbert Griggs, Denver, Colorado. 
Vice-President —N. L. Glover, Akron, Ohio. 
Secretary —Edgar O. Silver, Boston, Massachusetts.

PAPERS, 
PRESIDENT’S ADDRESS. 
N. COE STEWART, CLEVELAND, OHIO. 
It is a pleasant duty that devolves upon me to welcome you to this, the 
fifth annual session of the Department of Music Education of the National 
Educational Association. 
I welcome you, because it is very pleasant and helpful to meet teachers 
and friends from all parts of this great country of ours, who are co-workers 
in the cause of education. 
I welcome you to a department of great importance—one to which all 
other departments extend the right hand of fellowship; and of which, be- 
cause of its official standing, the whole world has a right to expect some- 
thing that will add to the happiness and to the advantage of each individual, 
and to every lawful form of organized society throughout the United States. 
From Maine to the Gulf, from the Atlantic to the Pacific, there is not a 
hamlet or a palace where your influence may not be felt. 
I welcome you to a meeting where good-fellowship and joyful participa- 
tion in the programs have been, to the present time, universal. 
But while we take pleasure in and are comforted by these annual gather- 
ings, and receive strength for the coming year even by juxtaposition, we 
must not forget that we have much work to do; that the other departments 
of the Association expect much of us; and that the eyes of the educational 
and the musical world are upon us; and while in their organized capacities 
they stand ready to codperate with us, they also expect us to do much of 
the planning and of the providing of ways and means by which the cause 
of music shall in a true educational sense be advanced. 
While in this address it will be evident that the public schools are, for the 
most part, in the speaker’s mind, yet this is only one musical branch, and 
all divisions of music-study, both private and class, might with propriety 
be considered in the Music Education Department of the National Educa- 
tional Association. Especially should emphasis be placed upon correct 
music-study in normal schools, in colleges, theological seminaries, and wher- 
ever there is class-teaching. But proper music-teaching is in its infancy. 
In the public schools are the masses, and upon the principles that “the first 
steps are the most important,” and that if certain fundamental things are 
done well the rest will, in a measure; take care of itself, the present seems 
to demand that music in the public schools shall be the “topic of the hour.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-669
  PRESIDENT’S ADDRESS. — 669 
Of course there are many persons, who have a name among educators 
and among musicians, to say nothing of others outside these classes, who 
oppose proper music instruction in the public schools. But that the ele- 
ments of music can be taught successfully to the individual pupil in the 
public school, that the benefits to the individual, the school, the family, and 
all social organizations, both as far as the proper functions of music go and 
as an assistant and a necessary concomitant of all other studies when music 
is rightly taught, there can no longer be any cavil. 
Sufficient organization has been effected, and enough public sentiment 
has been created, to give music-teaching a foothold. The study now is to 
establish correct methods of teaching; to direct all teaching-forces into right 
channels; to extend public sentiment; to procure universal legislation; to 
coordinate all educational and musical influences; and besides preparing 
the material for, to show how, in church and society, musical affairs should 
be managed, until music is rightly utilized in the various organizations of 
social and religious life. 
I welcome you, then, to this council; I congratulate you upon being 
called to so important work; I bespeak a most helpful as well as a happy 
time; and now beg to call your attention more specifically to some things 
which in my judgment should and must be looked after, and to a few of the 
hindrances and helps. 
A brief survey discovers that, nominally, in many places music is enu- 
merated as one of the studies in the school curriculum. (A report to be 
made this afternoon will enlighten us upon this matter further.) 
Most school superintendents affirm music’s importance. In one State 
teaching music is required by statute law. In other States it is left to 
boards of education to elect whether it shall be taught. In other States 
little thought has been given to the matter, and nothing officially has been 
done. Only the occasional song taught by the regular teacher who feels in- 
stinctively that there is something better, or the unaided and unsympathized 
effort of the itinerant music teacher who “is trying to do something,” are 
the visible signs that there is such a thing to be taught as music. 
In nearly all States the rural districts are unprovided for in this respect, 
only as some pioneer is devising ways and is obtaining a feeble foothold. 
In some places the music teacher gives a lesson once a week, or in two 
weeks, and the other days the regular teacher drills the class. 
In some large cities several music teachers are employed, and although 
there may be a so-styled “Superintendent of Music,” yet each teacher goes 
according to “his own sweet will,” except as he wills to “kill the other fel- 
low,” and, of course, there is no uniform system or plan, and the result is 
the usual one of “a house divided against itself.” 
Other places require all the music-teaching to be done by the special 
teacher. Still other places by the regular teacher, without instruction and 
supervision by competent parties. Still other cities have their music super-
-P-A-G-E-670
  670 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  
intendent, or director of music, who instructs and directs the regular teacher, 
and lays out work along well-defined educational lines, and according to 
established processes. In still other cities music is required, but is not 
taught. : 
Now to this add the fact that some one, and still some one else, imagines 
he has discovered a new principle in the educational world—“old though 
it was ere he was born” —writes his books, and, backed by his publishers, 
“rides his hobby,” which, instead of militating to real development in music, 
amounts, for the most part, to a faithful promulgation of “my system of 
books,” with variations which you all can supply, and you have a pretty 
clear statement of things as they exist at present in the public schools of 
the United States. What the universal musical product of such a state of 
things will be, can be easily determined. 
Now when it is considered that if right legislation is had; if right educa- 
tional processes are employed; if the will and the effort of the pupils are 
properly enlisted, and adequate teaching force is employed, etc., that public 
sentiment will be made; and that the children in our schools, yea, each indi- 
vidual child, will learn to use his voice correctly; will learn to sing songs 
well, and with good expression; will acquire a fondness for good music; 
will develop morally and sentimentally in the direction of the text used; 
will master the elements of ‘tone-pitch, tone-length, music-reading, and time, 
to the extent of being able to write a melody readily from hearing it sung or 
played, and can sing any new music as readily at sight as he can read a 
story; and will have in consequence, a training of the senses of hearing, 
and of seeing; of quick thinking, quick acting, and the “thousand-and-one” 
things which follow, such as no other study and no other training gives as well. 
When all these are considered, I say, to mention nothing of the wonderful 
changes such a condition of things would make in the world by heightening 
the enjoyments and the usefulness of every individual, by creating a better 
manhood and womanhood, and by giving to every form and condition of 
social life a medium of the greatest service in the performance of its func- 
tions and the fulfillment of its destiny, the importance of the work looms 
up, and becomes of paramount importance. 
It ought to be said that the fundamental principles of music are the same 
in instrumental as in vocal music, and if learned correctly in school, pre- 
pare one to begin the study of any instrument. 
Now as to hindrances, I will mention first the proneness to judge of things 
from one’s present conception and knowledge, and practically to consider the 
present concept as the proper one and the final. Rather than, while mak- 
_ ing present conception the basis of judgment, still seeking a higher concep- 
tion, and keeping the mind.in an inquiring state, and willing to adopt more 
advanced notions as one’s own reasoning decides, there must be something 
better, and personal experience and the experience of others’shows what the 
advance is. Correct opinions are usually the result of continued mental
-P-A-G-E-671
  
PRESIDENT’S ADDRESS. 671 
  
activities— likened unto organic growth; and this state of mind, with the 
effort to attain the highest and best, is in itself a conte! of growth, and 
must lead to a higher plane. 
While it is perfectly natural for all, and especially superintendents and 
those who must take the initiative in school reforms, to think of things as 
they were or are in their schools, and as they may have come under their 
observation, or as they may have reasoned they should be, yet you see 
how unjust such conclusions, if they are to be considered final. Just so it 
is with the regular teacher when she comes to teach music, and the music 
specialist as he seeks in every way he may to solve the problem. 
There must be enough wisdom and ability to start the work on an educa- 
tional basis, but then there should be the combined effort of every associated 
power, and the earnest seeking of all for an ideal still higher and better, 
and a willingness to accept the same when it is known. 
The next hindrance I mention is, that there is no conventional under- 
standing as to the meaning of musical terms and expressions. People use 
the same expressions, but their real meanings oftentimes are vastly different. 
Not long since a high-school principal remarked of a certain city: “They 
are doing splendid work in music.” A musician, who knows what good 
music-teaching is, informed your speaker after he had visited the same 
schools, that “it was the most abominable work he had ever seen, and that 
if he lived in that city he would send his children to a private school rather 
than that they should be subjected'to such horrid work.” 
Again, when the term “singing” is used, no one can tell the exact mean- 
ing of the speaker unless he defines his meaning, or until it is learned what 
his education and surroundings have been: Even then it can only be judged 
approximately. 
When you hear it remarked that “that is good singing,” the actual per- 
formance may be that of the most cultivated artist who possesses a voice, a 
brain and a physical development the. very best of their respective kinds in 
nature’s storehouse; and then may have been cultivated by master hands 
until the machinery is perfect; and then, with soulful earnestness, the singer 
pours forth the heartfelt strains with all the faithfulness and sentiment 
which the occasion may require. 
Or it may be the meaningless smoothness of a cultivated voice, with the 
heart left out. 
It may be the rousing heartiness of a Methodist camp-meeting; the silly, 
sentimental twaddle of some professed “spiritual singers.” 
Or it may be the “walk-around” of the minstrel, or the comic song of the 
clown; not to mention the harsh, loud and grating singing of school-children, 
or the senseless stuff that sometimes marshals under the title of “church 
singing.” 
Just so it is with the term “good music.” Even when the occasion is 
considered, the exact meaning must be determined by the educational status
-P-A-G-E-672
  672 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
of the individual making the assertion. “ Voice training” means one thing 
to this person, and quite another thing to that one; and is “chock full” of 
.meaningless assertions to most people, and not understood many times by 
the teacher. 
Likewise, “sight-singing” means almost anything, provided one “looks 
at a book.” In speaking of “rote-singing versus learning songs by note,” 
a very prominent musical leader in schools remarked in a public discussion 
a week or two ago, that “his pupils sang at sight; even the lowest grade 
had learned more songs last year ten times over than though they had learned 
by rote;” when in fact, as determined by observation, their learning was 
only a systematic form of rote-singing. 
The term, “note,” is used both for the character and the tone; “measure” 
is used for the “space between the bars,” for the “motion,” for a “ colleetion 
of beats,” and for “a bunch or a collection of equal parts of time.” These 
illustrations might be carried to a greater extent, but enough have been 
given to show my meaning. | 
Now I submit, is it not laudable work—yea, the incumbent work—of 
the Music Education Department of the N. E. A. to institute such procedure 
as will result — 
1. In a standard definition of terms, by which everywhere the same thing 
will be meant, thought of, and understood, when the same terms are used. 
2. When terminology will be philosophical, non-perplexing, and univer- 
sally the same. 
3. In the establishment of certain educational lines along which instruc- 
tion and training may proceed with certain knowledge that, if followed, the 
results desired will be obtained. 
4. The enumerating of certain studies, exercises, songs, ete., which may 
be used with safety and certainty. This will not necessarily. compel the 
use of Mr. A’s or Mr. B’s series of books, but will compel books to be of 
similar purport and character, and will give the people authentic and 
definite work. It will not do to prosecute such work in narrow lines or on 
selfish plans, but it must be broad as principle and wide as humanity. 
5. To initiate and to prosecute adequate plans until popular demand shall 
require that the whole work of school music shall be guided by educated 
musicians who are qualified to pass examination by the American College 
of Musicians, and who shall in broadness of thought, in general intelligence, 
in nobleness of character, and in normal training, be adequate to the great 
work of dealing with that which affects the lives, the characters and the 
happiness of the people of the land. 
6. In exciting popular demand for the introduction of music as a reg- 
ular study in all schools to the extent that legislatures will make the nec- 
essary requirement by statute law. 
7. In presenting to those noble people—school superintendents, school 
managers, teachers, etc.— object lessons, as it were, both in the possibilities
-P-A-G-E-673
PRESIDENT’S ADDRESS. 673 
  
of proper musical instruction and training, and in the correct manner of 
doing the same, that their visions may become enlarged and their hearty 
services enlisted, as perhaps they are the most potent factor in the prose- 
cution of this important work. And yet as a rule they now have as poor 
conception of good music—of its real functions and possibilities, of right 
music-teaching and superlative music-teachers—as any other factor in the 
case; albeit they are the quickest to discern, the most prompt to act, and 
longest to persevere, when once conviction is awakened and the desirability of 
action aroused. 
8. In showing to, and in really leading, our most interested contemporary 
and ally, the Music Teachers’ National Association, that is doing every- 
thing it can to encourage and assist us in this work, what educational music- 
teaching is, what the meaning of universal elementary music-teaching means, 
and that it necessarily requires their most vigorous help; and that of our 
other most esteemed ally, the American College of Musicians, to the end 
that our work may be eventually consummated. 
9. In systematically looking after school and other periodicals, that 
proper articles editorially and otherwise may regularly appear, for the pur- 
pose of creating opinion, correcting objections respecting all parts of the 
work, ete. 
Now, as action is the word, and wise, thoughtful and energetic, though 
discreet measures must be instituted, as the process must necessarily con- 
tinue for years, and the general purpose and line of work should «not vary 
nor swerve with successive méetings and change of administration in our 
department, I beg to submit that at this meeting provision be made for the 
appointment of two commissions consisting of three persons each: the pres- 
ident of this department to be an advisory member of both commissions. 
One commission to look after the subjects mentioned in points one, two, three, 
four and eight of this advice; the other commission to look after the sug- 
gestions in points five, six, seven and nine; and each in its respective line 
such other things as may become necessary as the work progresses. In each 
commission one member to be elected for three years, another for two years, 
and the other for one year. These committees to consult and to codperate 
with a somewhat similar committee or committees appointed by the Music 
Teachers’ National Association, and to report regularly at the meetings of 
this Association. 
This address is already too long to make more suggestions which occur to 
your speaker, and doubtless to you. I trust you will take action in these 
particulars. 
I had purposed speaking of the helpful things, and the encouraging out- 
look. There are many of these, and much brightness. There is much good 
work being done, and more with each succeeding year. Commencements 
and other public days in many places bring to masses of people not only 
enlivening exercises, but furnish in many cases really most excellent musical 
 
-P-A-G-E-674

programs which are prepared in a short time, because of the ability of the 
pupils. 
Churches are beginning to look to the schools as the source from which 
their choirs must come. Sabbath schools have no trouble in learning new 
music, and have hearty and delightful singing. The homes are beginning 
to know something of the bright things which have long existed for them, 
but which hitherto have been a sealed book because of inability to under- 
stand and to appreciate them. 
Musicians and musical composers are beginning to see that here is the 
great mine from which their aid and richness come. The whole world 
smiles already, and is big with expectation at the ripples of sunshine and 
magnetic thrills which this vigorous friend and essential life-agent, though 
long unappreciated, has already caused to spread over its face and course 
through its nervous system. 
Other philosophy, helps, hindrances, suggestions, and beauties, will man- 
ifest themselves throughout this session, for all of which I bespeak your ap- 
preciation, your edification, and your action. 
THE PROVINCE OF MUSIC IN EDUCATION. 
WM. A. MOWRY, BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS. 
When I was called upon by your secretary and invited to prepare a paper 
for this occasion, I gave to him a very strong reason why I should be ex- 
cused from such service. The reason not being accepted, I consented, but 
only on one condition—that when I should begin to speak to you to-day, the 
doors should be locked and no one permitted to leave until I had concluded 
my address; for if I spoke to you at all upon the subject of music I must 
be permitted at the outset to present some serious objections to its cultiva- 
tion, and I desire to do this without giving any just cause of offense. Hence, 
it may be necessary for you to hear me to the close in order to judge cor- 
rectly of the whole of what I have to say. 
Speaking to you, therefore, it is but fair and proper for me (under the 
circumstances) to say at the outset that I know very little upon the subject, 
and hence, according to the adage, I can speak without prejudice. It is well 
known that the Quakers, from the origin of their denomination, have not 
permitted the practice of music, instrumental or vocal, among the members 
of that society. George Fox and his followers found no place for it ina 
system of pure Christianity. Plato in his pure republic excluded entirely 
the cultivation of this art. I was born a Quaker; my father and mother 
were Quakers; my father’s father and mother were Quakers; my mother’s
-P-A-G-E-675
  THE PROVINCE OF MUSIC IN EDUCATION. 675. 
  
father and mother were Quakers; my father’s father’s father and mother 
were Quakers; my father’s mother’s father and mother were Quakers; my 
mother’s father’s father and mother were Quakers; my mother’ s mother’s 
father and mother were Quakers. 
From these facts in my personal history and descent, and from having 
no ear for music—in my earlier life having mastered only two tunes upon 
the accordion, although to-day I am tolerably sure of the difference between 
Yankee Doodle and Pleyel’s Hymn when I hear them long enough to dis- 
criminate—I think I may venture in this presence to assume that I am 
fully prepared and equipped for the critical consideration of the subject 
before us. 
I shall divide this paper into two parts. In the first place I desire to state 
certain objections to music, and to assign some reasons therefor; and then 
I intend to say some more things about the subject, and possibly aid you to 
draw some conclusions. 
1. Music is cultivated to so meee an extent in these days that it ceases to 
delight the ear, unless it is produced by those who are proficient in the art. 
But to become proficient requires the sacrifice of a great amount of time. 
To learn to play well, or to sing well, as you all know, requires years of 
patient, persevering, steady practice. Life is so short, and its necessary 
duties in these days so numerous and pressing, as to scarcely permit one who 
purposes to be of some use. in the world to fritter away his time for an hour, 
or two hours, or more, each day for many of the best years of his life, in 
order to become proficient in an art which, at best, is only to give to him- 
self or others a kind of gratification of the senses—indeed, of only one of 
the senses, namely, hearing. It is apparently impossible to measure the 
great amount of useful knowledge one could acquire, mental discipline pos- 
sible to be secured, or practical good accomplished, by a judicious use of the 
time which so many of you have expended in cultivating your taste for and 
your proficiency in music, vocal and instrumental. It were possible—I 
will not say that it might be profitable to some of you—to spend consider- 
able time in setting forth the practical importance of this argument; but I 
will spare your feelings, and proceed to the second point. 
2. A second objection to the cultivation of this art is its effect upon the 
human constitution. It has already been said that great proficiency, with- 
out which music is never delightful to the cultivated ear, cannot be obtained 
without great application continued through many years. This application 
is generally of a sedentary nature, and all such occupations long continued 
are injurious to health and weaken and disorder in time the physical con- 
stitution. Moreover, the very art itself is considered enervating. It acts 
unfavorably upon the nervous system, sometimes destroying the natural 
energy and proper ambition, and substituting habits of a weak and effemi- 
nate nature. The Italians are ranked among the most musical people in 
the world, but everyone knows that they are a low and depraved people,
-P-A-G-E-676
  676 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  
degenerate in morals, and soft and effeminate in mind. Music, it is true, 
may breathe a soft and refining influence, but can it breathe into the mind 
strength of purpose, or into the soul high moral resolves or a love of truth 
and rectitude. 
3. There are many who believe that music can never produce any solid 
comfort in life. It may give vivacity for the moment, and alcohol will do 
the same thing; but it cannot bring substantial encouragement, or help, or 
comfort. They think that it affords no anchorage to the mind in the storm, 
and is not productive of elevating thoughts. “The most melodious sounds 
that human instruments can make are from the earth earthy, and nothing 
ean rise higher than its origin.” 
4. In following out the application of the point just mentioned, it is often 
observed that musical people sometimes do not have well-balanced minds. 
They are apt to be flighty, fickle, changeable, fluctuating, sometimes irri- 
table, sometimes passionate, often unreliable. The quarrels of church choirs 
are proverbial. Indeed, there are many of the strong-minded people of the 
world who instinctively make allowances for those who are known to be 
musically inclined, giving less weight to their opinions, and placing less re- 
liance upon their stability. May I be permitted to appeal to your own ob- 
servation and experience in this respect. Would you expect to find a 
musical character on the supreme bench or in the executive chair of the 
nation? Would you look for a musician of high rank among the strongest 
railroad men, or bankers, or most successful merchants or manufacturers? 
In short, it is apparent that perfection in music is for some reason incon- 
sistent with the most judicial types of mind, and therefore not to be found 
in those places which require the greatest judgment, the strongest purposes, 
the utmost tenacity and perseverance. 
5. You may have already anticipated the point now to be made, namely, 
that man is made up of intellect, sensibilities, and will. Music in all its re- 
lations is chiefly concerned with the sensibilities, and has but little to do 
with the intellect, and but little influence upon the will. Man stands at the 
head of the animal creation. He is especially distinguished from the brutes 
by his superior intellect, and his moral perceptions. The chief aim there- 
fore of mankind should be to elevate the intellectual power and the moral 
worth. It has already been said that music, as it appears to many, does 
not produce elevated thoughts, that is, such thoughts as raise the mind to 
high intellectual conceptions or to sublime and spiritual things, but has to 
- do rather with the tastes and temper, the inclinations and prejudices of the 
world. These sounds that appeal only to the ear can scarcely produce ex- 
alted ideas, conceptions, or states of mind. But it is especially noteworthy 
to observe that the world ought to be governed by intellect, judgment, rea- 
son, and not by the sensibilities, imagination, feeling. 
The study of cause and effect, logic, what is right—this is productive of 
true progress and the eleyation of the race. When the world of humanity
-P-A-G-E-677
THE PROVINCE OF MUSIC IN EDUCATION. 677 
has learned to reason correctly, to know and to choose the right and the 
true, then, and not till then, will the race make rapid progress upward and 
ouward. 
Meantime it will doubtless be necessary, human nature being what it is, 
to give some attention to music, to cultivate to some extent the sensibilities, 
and the masses will attend theaters, circuses, and concerts and other places 
of amusement. Doubtless for a good while to come the circus will be more 
popular than the menagerie, the theater will outstrip the museum of natural 
history, the concert will take in more money than the lecture, and we shall 
continue to have flighty intellects, shallow minds, changeable purposes, 
broken promises, nervous persons, and short lives. 
How different it would be, however, if all mankind were educated thor- 
oughly in the mathematics, the sciences, the languages, in logic and reason- 
ing and government, in short, in all the higher intellectual studies which are 
calculated to cultivate the reason and the judgment, and the ethical nature 
rather than the sensibilities, passions, and what may be called the frivolities 
of life. 
If the minister in the pulpit, the lawyer at the bar, and the lecturer upon 
the rostrum had the single purpose constantly in mind of discovering and 
presenting the absolute truth and the pure right, instead of drawing upon 
the imagination, tickling the fancy and presenting pleasing pictures to the 
mind, what a different world this would soon be. But this is not the case. 
Right reason does not govern the world. 
Ido not wish to be understood as advocating a plain, prosaic world, shorn 
of all beauty. A world of pure logic, and the mathematics only, might 
possibly not be any improvement upon what we now have. It were best to 
hesitate before voting to banish all sxsthetic, and artistic, and imaginative 
realities. Dr. Jewett, the temperance lecturer, at one time, in a discussion 
with a Quaker abruptly said: “ Well, at any rate, God is not a Quaker.” 
“What does thee mean by that?” quoth Broadbrim. “I mean,” replied 
the Doctor, “that if He were, He would never have made the grass to be 
green, and the peach blossoms to be pink, and the tulips scarlet. All the 
world would have been shorn of its beauty and its brilliancy. All would 
have been of one plain, uniform, drab color. The birds would not sing, the 
beetles would be silent, the katydids would cease their uniform song, the 
brooks would not murmur, and gurgle, and splash over the stones. Niagara 
would lose its musical roar, and the morning stars could no longer sing to- 
gether. The music of the spheres would be hushed.” 
A broad, well-rounded view will doubtless show that at least it is possible 
that there may be a place even for music and the other fine arts as such. 
Reason, alone, cannot rule all things. 
A mathematician who is nothing but a mathematician is sometimes as 
angular, as inconsistent, and as uncomfortable a member of society as a 
musical character. One who deals only and always in angles and triangles, 
43—N. E. A.

parallelopipedons, «’s and y’s, surds and indeterminates, will very likely 
become as dry as a cracked cocoanut, as one-sided as a half-pair of shears, 
as unpractical as a chronic inventor, as unreliable as a searcher after per- 
petual motion. . 
Even logicians have been known to dispute. Sometimes theologians get 
so wrought up, so earnest, I should say, in their contentions for “the truth,” 
that they, probably in moments of frenzy, encroach upon the profession of 
John L. Sullivan and his brethren of the prize ring. This truth is patent 
to all. It may, perhaps, be generalized thus: We are all apt to be one- 
sided. It were better not to be so. A well-rounded character, who has 
developed all sides of his being, and cultivated harmoniously all his powers, 
is the ideal character. 
What then is the proper province of music in this development of char- 
acter, and what is its function educationally? 
1. The first truth to be stated then is, that the process of education is the 
development of an all-round, well-cultivated and well-disciplined mind, and 
the production of a well-balanced, well-governed moral character. This 
needs no elaboration. 
2. To this end it is necessary to cultivate and expand in harmonious 
proportions all the faculties of the soul. These include the intellect, the 
sensibilities, and the will. 
3. As the world at large is now, and probably ever will be, constituted, 
the proper development of the sensibilities must rank as of equal impor- 
tance with the intellect; for while men should in all things be governed by 
right reason, it is a lamentable fact that they are not, and are not likely to 
beso. Indeed, there is but very little correct reasoning in the world. All 
problems for the reasoning faculties to grasp are so complicated, have so 
many conditions, that it is a rare mind which is capable of weighing all the 
elements of the case, placing them all in their true position, and assigning 
to each its proper value, so as to deduce with no misgivings the final result. 
4. The great majority of the members of the human race are more influ- 
enced for good or for evil by their feelings, their prejudices, their biases, 
their emotions, such as love, hate, fear, or their passions; appetites, and cray- 
ings, than by cool logic and the decisions of the intellect. 
5. Hence, all that makes one turn with an approving tendency, a bias 
for, a disposition toward, the right, the true, and the good, is commendable; 
and so far as its influence is decided in the right direction, just so far is it 
to be commended. 
6. Music surely, whether we consider the pure music alone—that is, the 
instrumental music—or the mixed music—that is, the vocal music, which 
is mixed with thought, with sentiment, with that which affects the motives 
of action —is always, or at least may be always, the opposite of the vicious 
and the downward in tendency. It is elevating, refining, purifying. It is 
true that music may be used as the handmaid to the passions, and even to
-P-A-G-E-679
THE PROVINCE OF MUSIC IN EDUCATION. 679 
  
vice itself; but the evil is more apt to lie in the words than in the music 
per 8e. 
7. Music can be, is capable of being everywhere, the handmaid of virtue, 
patriotism, and religion. Its natural character is spiritual, and not brutal. 
Its influence would be always elevating, were it not for the abuses to which 
it has so often been subject. It is adapted to elevate the tone of mind, to 
set flowing thoughts of purity, cheerfulness, benevolence, and devotion, and 
to the pure and holy will always prove of much value in producing elevated, 
noble states of mind. | 
Let it be borne in mind that music is as capable of being abused, and so 
put to bad uses, as speech or perception, or the logical faculty itself; yet for 
that reason it should no more be totally condemned than should those other 
faculties which were designed by the great Creator for our good, and good 
only. ‘ 
Who would think of dispensing with the gift of speech —that high power 
which so radically distinguishes the human race as decidedly above the 
brute world — because there are those who tell what is not true, or those who 
use profane or vulgar words? It was the great French cynic and selfish 
political demagogue who said, “ Words were invented for the purpose of con- 
cealing thought.” Words have been prostituted to that ignoble purpose, 
but such was not their original design, nor is it their general use. No more 
is it legitimate, we are inclined to believe, that music should properly be 
charged with the evils which are incident to its abuse; and surely much 
that is sometimes thought and said against it should be laid to the door of 
an already depraved character and low form of thought and action. 
During the last twenty years much attention has very properly and very 
wisely been given to elevating the style and character of music taught to 
the children in the public and private schools of the country, and especially 
to the methods by which it has been presented to the youthful mind. A 
_ simple, natural style and a normal method of presentation have done much 
toward training those proper emotions and sensibilities which will produce, 
and have already produced, most excellent results upon the juvenile mind. 
Even a thorough, consistent Quaker must admit that much of the objections 
to musie as set forth by George Fox, and Robert Barclay, and Thomas 
Clarkson, were not properly against music in itself, but against the inci- 
dental abuses which had, especially in that age, grown out of a perverted 
taste, and an unnatural and unreasonable usage of what inherently was de- 
signed to be only for’good. 
Indeed, it has already come to pass that singing has often been introduced 
into the Sunday schools and the day schools of the Society of Friends, and 
even instrumental music is now found in some of the best schools and fam- 
ilies of this religious denomination. Nor is this at all inconsistent with the 
professions of the Quakers. All will grant that poetry is in itself calcu- 
lated to elevate thought and action. Has it any the less tendency in that
-P-A-G-E-680
  680 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  
direction when sung than when recited? Does the music which may be set 
to the words introduce any new and less elevating element, or give to the 
thought and sentiment any lower or less excellent an influence? 
It becomes therefore a matter of no small concern to all educators, that 
music— especially singing — be introduced into all the schools of the land, 
and that it be taught in the most philosophical manner to all the children, 
in order that the cultivation of the best powers of the human voice may be 
the result, and that all the natural and possible advantages from this divine 
art be brought to bear during the tender years of childhood in producing 
that well-balanced mind and high character which are the chief aim of any 
system of education. 
AN OUTSIDE MUSICIAN’S VIEWS OF MUSIC IN THE 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS. i 
  
WILLIAM H. DANA, WARREN, OHIO. 
Before entering upon my address proper, allow me to talk to you for a 
few minutes about music in a general way, as I am afraid that much has 
been said to lead you to look upon it in any other sense than as a practical 
study. The man or woman who is a “musician”—skilled in the art or 
science of music—must be as intelligent as the mathematician, astronomer, 
or general educator. If this statement is doubted by anyone present, let 
him enter an examination of the American College of Musicians, and have 
placed before him the examination papers in history, acoustics, terminology, 
musical form, harmony, composition, and orchestration, and then write a 
thesis from a selected subject, and all doubt will be removed. As a single 
illustration, showing the need of knowledge on the part of the musician, let 
me refer to that part of a well-written composition called the “develop- 
ment.” Most of you know that the relative characteristics of tones are 
length (long or short), power (loud or soft), pitch (high or low), ete. Add 
to the characteristics of tones those to be found in a melodic combination, 
consisting of rhythmical likeness, and the variety of dress through harmonic 
clothing, and there is presented a number of leading characteristics that 
tones alone and in combination possess. Just as the preacher selects from 
the chapter a text for his theme on which to sermonize, so the intelligent 
musician selects from the musical “first subject” a motive for “develop- 
ment;” and no less thought is required on the musician’s part in properly 
developing it than on the part of the learned divine in developing his text. 
All the characteristics referred to that belong to a tone enter into the devel- _ 
opment of a theme, including rhythmical characteristics, harmonic clothing, 
variety of accompaniment, and orchestral colorings—a limitless field; none

but the educated can enter it, and to others it is unknown. A statement 
has been made, that in an average audience of 600 people, but 25 would be 
able to thoroughly appreciate a good musical work, because of the lack of 
knowledge of musical construction. The majority would be entertained by 
the melody, or harmonies, or orchestral coloring, lacking the knowledge of 
how to listen and get back of the pleasing to the intellectual. To the 
majority it is much the same as that of listening to an eloquent speaker 
discourse in an unknown tongue, and the only entertainment come from 
gestures, inflection of voice, and manner. I hope enough has been said to 
convince you that music is a science and an art, requiring educated men 
and women to properly represent it. There has been one feature of the 
musical question repeatedly dwelt upon here that I am going to object to, 
and that is the sentimental or emotional characteristic. Granted that 
music in its influence will stop a dog-fight, or add to the happiness of the 
home: I want to ask if a general education that makes men cultured and 
refined, will not bring the same results? Why ring the changes on this 
line, when music in its influence is not different from any other branch of 
study, that if pursued gives a cultured condition, and in whose train follow 
all the influences accorded to music? The patronage of my school comes from 
all parts of the Union, and in the twenty years of its existence I have never 
received a letter from parent or guardian desiring to have a child or ward 
educated in music because of its emotional influence. My friends, music 
is a science, and deserves the dignified attention accorded other branches of 
science. Why are not the same arguments brought forward in other sciences 
or studies ?—for surely “knowledge is power,” and gives to its possessor all the 
characteristics for control and entertainment. More money is devoted to 
musical instruction than in any other one branch; and to my mind the 
proper question to discuss and to present in a gathering of this kind is, al- 
though a low one, how much benefit financially can be derived from the 
study of music? or, if a parent, how well will it prepare my son or daughter 
to care for themselves in case of need? Iam ready to present proof that this is 
the proper point from which to view this subject. First, there is no profes- 
sion which has as many disciples who come out of our public schools, and are 
teaching it for a living, as the profession of music. Secondly, disaster never 
comes upon a home full of boys and girls but what you find the majority 
flying to music as a means of support ; and nine times out of ten they are 
graduates from a literary school, where they took music as an incidental study. 
Some one has said that “religion, art, and music are too sacred to put on a 
level with money-making.” Perhaps this is true; but what are the facts? 
As “self-preservation is the first law of nature,” we find the preacher, when 
he receives a call, studying to see if the salary will support his family and 
properly rear and educate his children: then, again, you will find him fol- 
lowing an increase of salary. In art, enormous sums are paid for paintings, 
and where an artist has acquired fame, you don’t find him giving away his  
-P-A-G-E-682

works because he thinks his art too sacred to measure his work from a finan- 
cial standpoint. Iam ready to grant the influence of music in the home, 
and on a dog-fight, but the bread-and-butter question comes first. Where 
music is taught in the public schools, the questions on the part of the board 
and superintendent should be, How competent is the teacher to give proper 
instruction? and, Of how much benefit will the study be to the pupil in lay- 
ing a foundation for future usefulness? 
The topic assigned to me is, “A Professional Musician’s View of Music in 
the Public Schools.” 
In order that you may properly appreciate my observations, allow me to 
call attention, first, to the demands made upon musicians in some of the 
various branches of musical study, and the faults that exist among the ma- 
jority, and then the work of the public schools. Let us look at the demands 
of the thoroughly musical, from whom the musician desires recognition. 
Take the various instruments in general use, and voice. A pianist must 
have knowledge of the values represented by notes and rests, a perfect ap- 
preciation of the pitch of tones, a technical knowledge of the instrument, 
and the ability to read by sight and sound. The lack of these characteris- 
tics is to be seen in the great army of piano-players who startle you with 
their seeming technical ability, and yet who are unable to play the easiest 
accompaniment or instrumental piece at sight. All of the demands named 
are called for by every instrument depending on the performer for time, 
intonation, and execution. A vocalist must have knowledge of the values 
represented by notes and rests, a perfect appreciation of the pitch of tones, 
and the effort necessary to rise or fall to them with perfect intonation, and 
the ability to read at sight and by sound. The lack of knowledge and 
ability on the part of our singers, great and small, is to be seen when the 
simplest song is called for to be sung at sight, and the disgraceful failure 
that follows the effort. I am going to make the following statement: 
Among the oratorio and opera singers, and local vocal performers, whose 
efforts are so wonderful and entertaining, nine out of ten would not know 
that “Old Hundred” was the same tune if written in three different keys; 
which statement means that I desire to have you understand that they know 
nothing of the written language they try to represent. Their lack of appre- 
ciation of intonation as presented on the written page is to be heard as they 
go sliding from tone to tone, and feeling their way about on the staff, in as 
‘deep darkness musically, as they would be physically in the Mammoth 
Cave without light. The demands on wind-instrument players are the 
same as those of the vocalist, and blowing out of tune is the fault of the 
performer. Better a poor instrument in the hands of a performer who 
knows the principles of music, than a good one in the hands of a performer 
who lacks in knowledge, especially that of tone and intonation. It should 
not be a matter of surprise when we. hear some one sing or play at sight. 
We ought to expect it. A boy or girl picks up a newspaper and reads
-P-A-G-E-683
  MUSIC IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 683 
  
new matter at sight, and we are not agitated over the effort, but would 
be if it were a failure. You can properly expect as much from the musi- 
cian as from the reader— interpretation not excepted —for he has a written 
language placed before him, and it can be as thoroughly understood in one 
case as in the other. Wherever failure appears on the part of the musician, 
there you will find knowledge, concentration, and continuity lacking. Ten 
years from now you will not find 25 in an audience of 600, alone capable of 
intelligently enjoying a concert, for the musical instruction in the public 
schools will have given to the masses a knowledge of things musical, and 
575 will then vote the 25 who fail to understand or enjoy a concert, as either 
too dumb or deaf. Do you know that the musical instruction of the public 
school is the foundation on which true musicianship must find a foundation, 
and that every demand of vocalist and instrumentalist — excepting technical 
information—is to be found in the public-school work? The demands for 
admission to the Royal Academy of Music, London, England, Paris Con- 
servatory, Royal High School of Music, Berlin, Germany, in their examina- 
tions are on the line of public-school work, namely: sodfege is the basis of 
all instruction whether vocal or instrumental. The written musical language 
through the use of characters, including a knowledge of division of measure, 
intonation, etc., tone and the ability to produce it, are all the work of the 
public school. All that is presented in the public schools is essential to 
true musicianship; and the history of most of our great musicians finds 
them having laid this foundation in their early lives as choir-boys, an expe- 
rience which is precisely the same as that offered in the public schools. I 
want to express my gratitude to the public-school work for having graded 
musical teaching, and given to us musical definitions that in their applica- 
tions are not a lie. I was taught by my teacher, years ago, that “a note 
represents a sound;” but in my twenty-five years of teaching I have never 
been able to make the application. The greatest knowledge I had of the 
staff was, that it consisted of “five lines and four spaces,” and beyond this 
opinion nothing was ever offered until the public school stepped in to prop- 
erly define it, and give it the use formerly accorded to a note. Through the 
musical catechism of the public school, the staff, a note, tie, slur, triplet, 
etc.,.in its use is properly understood, and musical excellence is being ap- 
preciated by those who come out from under its instruction. 
Let me say in conclusion, that there is nothing difficult or mysterious in 
music. From the primary knowledge necessary to know the characters in 
music, up through to the ability to write a fugue, there is nothing mysterious. 
All trouble comes from a failure to intelligently present each subject; and 
in teaching, I am constantly reminded of the quotation: “Therefore get 
wisdom, and with all thy getting get understanding,” which will always be 
the result when a subject is systematically presented and defined.

SPECIAL REPORT ON THE CONDITION OF MUSIC INSTRUC- 
TION IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS OF THE UNITED STATES. 
  
EDGAR O. SILVER, 
SECRETARY OF THE DEPARTMENT oF Music INSTRUCTION. 
At the last annual meeting of the Department of Music Instruction of the 
National Educational Association, held in San Francisco, California, July 
20, 1888, the following resolution was adopted: 
Whereas, The Department of Music Instruction of the National Educational As- 
sociation recognizes thé importance of promoting a general recognition of vocal- 
music instruction as a regular branch of study in the schools; and 
Whereas, We believe that more definite information as to the extent to which 
music is already taught, and the success which has attended its introductidn into 
the schools so far, will greatly contribute to this end: therefore, 
Resolved, That this Department respectfully petition the Directors of the National 
Educational Association for an appropriation not to exceed one hundred dollars, to 
be expended under the direction of the officers of this Department during the next 
year in obtaining such data by addressing circulars of inquiry to the State and 
county superintendents of the respective States, and the superintendents or secre- 
taries of schoo! boards in the leading towns and cities of the United States; and 
that the answers obtained be collated and tabulated, and be made the basis of a 
special report on the condition of music instruction throughout the United States, 
to be submitted to this Department at its next annual meeting. 
In accordance with this resolution, the following report is respectfully 
submitted. ; 
The first question to determine in undertaking to gather the information 
called for by this resolution, was to what number of towns and cities to send 
the inquiries—or in other words, what definition to give to the expression 
“leading towns and cities,” which occurs in the resolution. After some de- 
liberation, it was decided to take as a basis a list comprising those places 
which’ according to the United States census of 1880 contained 4,000 in- 
habitants or upwards. To this list was added such other prominent towns 
as are either known to have grown greatly in population since 1880, or by 
reason of the location of educational institutions within them, or other 
special advantages, to be more than usually enterprising in educational 
matters. 
The whole list of places thus selected was 1,078. To these a blank con- 
taining the following questions was sent: 
1. Is music a recognized branch of study in your schools? Is its study compul- . 
sory? 
2. How long has music been so recognized? 
8. In what year of the pupil’s school-life does the study of music begin, and 
through what years does it extend? 
4, Please outline briefly what is attempted in each year of study.
-P-A-G-E-685
  MUSIC INSTRUCTION IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 685 
  
5. What plan or system of instruction is followed, and are the results in your 
schools such as to warrant you in recommending the same plan or system for gen- 
eral use? 
6. If so, what do you consider its chief excellences? If not, what do you consider 
its chief defects? : 
7. As an educator, do you believe that vocal music should be taught in public 
schools? What reasons lead you to this belief? 
8. What aré the general objects aimed at through the music instruction in your 
schools? 
9. Please make any further observations or remarks that may suggest themselves 
to you as pertinent to the above inquiries. 
To each State and Territorial Superintendent was sent an inquiry (1) as 
to the number of places in his State or Territory where music is regularly 
taught in the public schools; (2) a request that he state his observations as 
to the general results which have been reached in those places in music in- 
struction; (3) also that he give a statement of his views as an efucator as 
to the educational value of music, and the expediency of introducing it into 
the schools generally, with permission to quote from the same in this report. 
Responses have up to the present time been received from 621 of these 
towns and cities—about three-fifths of the entire number, which, making 
due allowances for misdirection, losses in the mails, the neglect of some to 
answer the inquiries, etc., is perhaps quite as large a number as could reason- 
ably be expected. 
From a good proportion of the State and Territorial superintendents, 
responses have also been received, and these for the most part have been 
most heartily in favor of music in the public schools, showing that the dis- 
tinguished educators at the head of the educational affairs of the several 
States are fully alive to the value of music instruction in the public schools, 
and are doing much to promote and establish it firmly as a regular branch 
of study in the public schools of their respective States. 
At this point, the following summary of the responses may not be out of 
place: 
SUMMARY.

From these figures it will be seen that considerably more than half of the 
places heard from report systematic instruction in music under some plan 
(nearly 55 per cent.), while many of the remaining places give more or less 
time to the practice of singing. 
Comparing these figures with those contained in a circular of information
-P-A-G-E-686
686 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  
issued by Gen. John Eaton, United States Commissioner of Education in 
1886, we find that in the circular referred to there was a report from 343 
cities and towns. Of this number, 132 reported instruction given by the 
regular teaching force alone, 38 per cent. of which was found to be by rote; 
19 places reported music taught by special teachers only; 96 places by both 
regular and special teachers; and 96 reported no music instruction what- 
ever. It requires only a hasty comparison of these figures to show that the 
last three years have witnessed great progress, both in the number of places 
where music is taught, and the better support which is given to the subject 
in those schools where it is taught. It will also be seen that the number of 
places where the special teacher is depended on to give all the instruction is 
proportionally very much reduced, and the inference would seem warranted 
that in a very much greater number of such places the work is now done by 
the regular teaching force, wnder direction of the special teacher. In an- 
other respect, not shown by the figures, the cause of music has probably 
made even greater progress, viz., in the growth of public sentiment in its 
favor, and the increased support which it has gained at the hands of our 
prominent educators. ‘“ While,” as Gen. Eaton says in the circular just re- 
ferred to, “there is not likely to be a musical millennium at once, the time 
has not come when musicians and friends of this art in the United States 
can lay aside their harps with the sweet assurance that there remains noth- 
ing for them to do;” it seems true nevertheless, at the present time, that 
every friend of the cause of music may labor with increased courage and 
hopefulness as he notes the rapid progress which the cause is now making. 
That there is at the present time a greater general interest in the subject 
of music instruction in the schools of the United States, and a stronger con- 
viction on the part of our leading educators that music should form a part 
of the regular course of study in our schools, has been shown in connection 
with the gathering of the information for this report in two ways: 
1. By the promptness with which the returns were prepared and forwarded 
from a majority of the towns and cities. (And it may be added, that, gen- 
erally speaking, the places heard from are the larger and more important 
of those to which inquiries were addressed.) 
2. The strong and unmistakable opinions in favor of music which have in a 
majority of cases accompanied the returns. Indeed, only four out of the 
whole number of superintendents and school principals heard from have 
given an unqualified “No” to the question, “As an educator, do you believe 
that vocal music should be taught in public schools?” The ungrammatical 
reason which one gives is, “There are many good teachers who cannot teach 
vocal music, nor never would.” The second says, “There is no time for it.” 
The third says, “I do not believe in vocal music in the public schools. It 
would consume the time that might be employed in teaching something that 
would be of service to the pupils.’ And the fourth insists “That the pub- 
lic schools should be confined to the three R’s,” (with the generous addition
-P-A-G-E-687
  MUSIC INSTRUCTION IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 687 
  
of a J for geography.) To this number may be added the disheartening 
report from the secretary of a school board, who says: “I give it up. We 
have tried it two years at a cost of over $1,600, so that at our last meeting 
we unanimously voted to discontinue our special teacher. It interferes with 
all of the other branches.’”? The salary (of the special teacher) is the only 
“object aimed at.” But the fact that the number of such answers is less 
than one ‘per cent. of the entire number, is surely a most gratifying show- 
ing. There are several apparently not fully persuaded, who answer, “Yes, 
with qualifications;” “Yes, when practicable;” “Yes, so far as it can be 
done by teachers employed;” “To a limited extent, yes;” “Am at sea as to 
the question where there can be no special teacher.” One principal, “ Never 
gave the matter any attention;” three express themselves doubtful; and 
about twenty neglected to answer the question, though their answers to the 
remaining questions show that most of them might truthfully have answered 
in the affirmative. Of those who report no music instruction in the schools, 
very many express regret that such is the case, and in several instances the 
hope that in the near future music may be taught. 
The number of places reporting the introduction of music during the last 
year or two is also especially noticeable, and some of the most hearty and 
enthusiastic expressions in favor of music come from such places. 
As Ido not deem it within the province of this paper to attempt any 
argument of my own for the teaching of vocal music in the schools, but 
rather to report to you, as far as possible in the limited time and space at 
my command, the facts and opinions gathered, I will quote from a few re- 
sponses selected to represent the various phases of opinion which have been 
brought out in this large correspondence. 
In the answers received opinions differ, as of course they must, coming 
from so many individuals so widely separated, and working under so widely 
different circumstances; but there is such an overwhelming majority of tes- 
timony in favor of school music, that we may almost agree with the prin- 
cipal who rather petulantly says the question, “Should music be taught?” 
ete., is “out of date.” One educator writes, “I should like to see the study 
of music made compulsory.” Another says: “Our State law permits music, 
but does not make it compulsory. It should be made compulsory.” An- 
other writes: “I have no knowledge of music, vocal or instrumental —all 
my own fault—and I desire to avoid such a result befalling those who come 
after me; and one of the ways, in my judgment, is to make the study com- 
pulsory in our schools.” Another writes: “Music can be taught success- 
fully without materially increasing the expense of any school. Therefore, 
considering its great advantages, its study should be compulsory in all public 
schools.” 
On the other hand, a few who believe in vocal music express doubts as 
to the wisdom or practicability of introducing music in the public schools. 
These doubts generally relate either to the expense of music instruction, or
-P-A-G-E-688
  688 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  
the question whether it can be introduced without overcrowding the school 
curriculum. One educator would teach music as an accomplishment, al- 
though he doubts whether it is either directly practical or possesses good 
disciplinary advantages. Another would teach it for “ recreation and amuse- 
ment only.” Another inquires, “Does not the amount of singing done in our 
schools injure the voices of very young children?” (This is the only instance 
where fear as to harmful results from music instruction in schools has been 
expressed or suggested.) Another regards music as a “fine art,” and be- 
lieves that “only a very small number of persons can make anything out of 
it.” Another says (while favoring the teaching of music on educational 
grounds), “I do not believe in the great moral influence claimed by some 
for music.” Another educator would have music taught in the schools, and 
believes that “the object of music instruction in schools is to make better 
men and women, by making life enjoyable and teachers endurable.? One 
writes from one of the Southern States, “ We have so many instructors and 
private schools that the public does not attempt to teach music here.” 
The answer that music is not regularly taught in the publie schools comes 
from several important places in the South. (Though it should be added 
that the responses from Southern educators indicate that they are fully 
alive to the importance of school music, and in no way behind their North- 
ern brethren in their appreciation of its value and importance in the schools.) 
Another educator frankly says, “When music was first introduced here I 
was not in favor of it, but now I am much pleased, as I have found that 
they learn to do by doing when they are doing.” (!) (This is substantially 
the testimony from many places.) 
Another says, “ Music should be taught; made part of the regular course 
of study; teachers should be able to instruct.” 
Another: “Every licensed teacher should be required to possess an ele- 
mentary knowledge of music.” 
Still another: “Music should be required by law, and teachers should be 
required to understand it as well as arithmetic.” 
One prominent educator says: “I feel sure that the general introduction 
of music into our schools, with competent teachers, would increase their 
usefulness twenty-five per cent.” 
Others answer as follows: 
“No elementary education is complete without music.” 
“No scheme of education is complete without music.” 
“We hope the time is not distant when music will be a branch of study 
in the county and State public schools.” 
“Music has no second place beside any other branch.” 
“Looking at the subject from any standpoint, there is every reason why 
music should be taught in our schools, and not one valid reason against it.” 
“Music belongs to civilization. Beasts do not sing; angels do.” 
“No soul is symmetrically developed without music. I believe the time 
will come when music will be taught in all our schools.”

  MUSIC INSTRUCTION IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. ~- 689 
  
“T believe in music, but believe it can never be made practical until we 
have a general introduction all over the country. To be successful, in my 
judgment, it should be taught as universally as reading.” 
“Vocal music has become a necessity of late years, and consequently as 
all can learn, to sing, they all should learn, and the earlier the better.” 
“Music is not taught in any of our public schools, but I think it should 
be. It is an accomplishment which adds much to the pleasure of the pupils 
and the happiness of their homes. It would enable many of our high-school 
graduates to obtain positions as teachers in other States—positions which 
they fail to obtain on account of not knowing music.” 
“Music went in with an effort, but it is so exceedingly satisfactory to all 
that it would take an earthquake to put it out.” 
“T believe music should be taught for the same reason that reading should 
be taught.” 
“T believe music is a good thing in schools, because all the great lights tell 
me so.” 
“We would not, nor could not abandon music.” 
From the answers to inquiries, it would seem that there is some diversity 
of opinion about SPECIAL TEACHERS. 
One educator says: “I believe that music cannot and should not be taught 
- in public schools except by teachers especially trained and adapted to the 
work.” 
Another: “My experience with special teachers has not been encourag- 
ing.” 
Still another: “Special instructors are indispensable in our schools in this 
subject.” 
Another writes: “The best results are obtained by having the regular 
teachers do the work.” 
Another: “Our school law, unfortunately, forbids the employment of any 
special instructor.” 
Another writes: “It is my deliberate conviction, that we cannot have 
good results without a special teacher.” 
Still another: “TI believe special teachers should spend more time teach- 
ing teachers how to teach.” 
Another: “I am not fully convinced that the individual teacher can teach 
music successfully.” 
Another: “I am satisfied that only a very moderate amount can be done 
by regular teachers.” 
As showing the convictions and opinions of our leading educators on this 
question, it may not be out of place here to quote from the letters received 
from a few of them. 
President Albert P. Marble, of the National Educational Association, 
‘says: “I think no system of schools ought to be without the study of 
music.”
-P-A-G-E-690
  690 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  
State Superintendent Rice, of South Carolina, says: “I am heartily in 
favor of music instruction, and I hope that we will see music taught in 
every school and to every child in the State. To say nothing of its good 
effect upon the physical system, it civilizes and refines every school and 
community where proper training is given.” 
Hon. Thomas B. Stockwell, Commisssoner of Public Schools, State of 
Rhode Island, says: “I have never known a case where the introduction of 
the study [of music] was felt to be a mistake. I have always believed in 
music, and have always advocated its introduction into the regular curricu- 
lum of all grades of school work.” ; i 
Hon. Ira G. Hoitt, State Superintendent of California, says: “Music is 
one of the branches required by law to be taught. I believe thoroughly in 
the refining and elevating influence of music, and think some part of every 
day should be devoted to singing if it be only ten minutes.” (California is 
the only State in the Union which by constitutional provision makes the 
teaching of music compulsory in the public schools.) 
Hon. Henry Sabin, State Superintendent of Iowa, says: “There is no 
doubt that the general introduction of musie into our public schools, as a 
regular study, would be productive of much good. There is no place on 
record in which under suitable management it has been found a failure; 
there are many cities ready to testify to its usefulness. As one of the means 
by which we hope to build up and foster a system of schools distinctively 
American, it-must soon come into very general use.” 
The Florida State Superintendent says: “Give me my State full of singing 
schools, and I will have a State full of singing homes, and then happy, pure 
homes.” 
Secretary Hine of the State Board of Education of Connecticut says: “I 
believe fully in the expediency of introducing music into every common 
school.” 
State Superintendent S. M. Finger, of North Carolina, writes: “Music 
has not been introduced as a regular branch of instruction in any of our 
public schools so far as I am informed. Of course many teachers in the 
city schools and in the country ungraded schools have some singing, and 
encourage music to such extent as they may be able. I lay much stress 
upon the educational value of music per se, and besides, singing in school is 
very useful in more directions than one, as all teachers who have tried it 
can bear testimony. As fast as teachers can be found competent to teach 
vocal music, I think it ought to be introduced into the public schools. If 
it be said that we now have too many branches for the time at command, I 
reply that progress in other branches will be promoted rather than retarded 
by spending a few minutes per day, at times judiciously selected, on vocal 
music.” 
The State Superintendent of Texas, Hon. Oscar H. Cooper, writes: 
“(1) Nearly all of the cities and towns which are incorporated for school pur-
-P-A-G-E-691
  MUSIC INSTRUCTION IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 691 
  
poses as independent school districts have musical instruction in some form. 
(2) The general results, so far as I am informed, are satisfactory. (3) I am 
of the opinion that music is a valuable auxiliary in discipline, and useful 
as an introduction to the culture which art affords; and I am further of the 
opinion that vocal music should be taught in all the schools.” 
Hon. John L. Buchanan, State Superintendent of Virginia, writes: “I re- 
gard music properly taught as having special educational value, and would 
favor the introduction of vocal music into our public schools, provided our 
teachers were qualified to teach it.” 
Hon. A. 8. Draper, State Superintendent of New York, says: “As to the 
expediency of introducing music into schools generally, I see only one 
drawback, and that is the lack of preparation on the part of school-teachers 
for the work. While I believe that vocal music in the public schools means 
the cultivation of the rising generation in a broader and more thorough 
manner than they can be cultivated without it, and while it seems impossi- 
ble to over-estimate the importance of the general introduction of vocal 
music into the public schools, I do not consider poor music or poor teaching 
of music desirable from any standpoint. If music be taught upon the same 
educational principles which lie at the foundation of all good teaching, it 
is a mighty power in the school-room; and any good teacher who has a 
sufficiently correct ear to sing the scale in tune, may become a good music- 
teacher if she has the opportunity to study music as she studies other 
branches.” 
Other State Superintendents are equally hearty in the expression of their 
views on the subject. 
Assuming, then, that these 621 towns and cities which are made the basis 
of this report are fairly representative of the entire number of towns and 
cities of like size in the United States, we have in the reports from these, 
as well as in the opinions and convictions expressed by so many of our lead- 
ing educators, the information and testimony upon which to base certain 
conclusions as to the condition of music instruction in the public schools of 
the United States, and the results which have attended the introduction of 
music thus far, as well as the data from which to suggest certain duties, 
privileges and responsibilities belonging to those charged with the important 
work of furthering the extent of music instruction in the schools, and im- 
ee its quality therein. 
. The first and most obvious conclusion from the facts and opinions on 
ag this report is based, is that vocal music as a branch of study in the 
public schools of the United States has stood the crucial test of experience 
and critical observation; that it has demonstrated its value in the school- 
room, and has won for itself the almost unanimous Bupa and approval 
. of American educators. 
2. That vocal music should be regularly and systematically taught in the 
schools—not more for its own value than for the sake of the schools them-
-P-A-G-E-692
  692 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
selves, and the intellectual, moral, and physical improvement of every pupil 
in the schools. 
3. That there is at the present time a growing sentiment all over the 
country in favor of music instruction in the schools, and a more widespread 
disposition than ever before to have music intelligently taught in the public 
schools. 
4. That there is in all sections of the country great need of teachers, both 
regular and special, who can carry forward the work; for, after all, the 
question, “How soon can music be generally and successfully introduced 
into the schools?” must be answered by the teachers of the country. 
The two objects toward which the endeavors of those interested in the 
cause of music instruction in the American schools should be directed, would 
seem to be: 
1, That those places where time is allowed for music, and where singing 
is more or less practiced for recreation only, be induced as early as possible 
to employ the time thus spent in systematic instruction, which shall have 
for its object the training of the pupil to read music intelligently and readily, 
and the cultivation as far as possible in the course of this instruction of a 
correct musical taste. 
2. To encourage the introduction of systematic music instruction as rapidly 
as possible in those schools where no time is now given to music. 
It is evident that the proper teaching of music in the schools, and its con- 
sequent success therein, will be greatly promoted by three things: 
1. Those preparing to be teachers in the schools should at the same time 
fit themselves to teach music. To this end it is important that thorough 
and systematic instruction should be given not only in music itself, but also 
in the proper methods of teaching it in all our State normal schools, train- 
ing schools, and other institutions for the preparation of teachers. The in- 
struction in these schools should embrace not only the study of music itself, 
but also the application to the teaching of music of the best pedagogy taught 
in such schools: 
2. Musicians and those who aspire to the direction of music-work in the 
schools must study educational methods and the genius and practical work 
of our public schools, and be able to lay out and direct the music-teaching 
along the lines followed by the regular teachers who are doing the best 
work in other subjects. They must also be able to meet and instruct the 
regular teachers how to proceed, precisely as is done by the superintendent, 
principal, or other school official, in other branches of study. When music 
is introduced for the first time, and the teachers consequently unaccustomed 
to the work, this is absolutely indispensable; and it should never be aban- 
doned altogether, whatever the degree of excellence reached. While the 
work of the director or special teacher of music is all-important to the 
highest success of the work, it is undoubtedly true that nearly, if not quite, 
all the instances of failure in yocal music are due to inefficiency on the part
-P-A-G-E-693
  
MUSIC IN OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM. 693 
of the special instructor—indeed, the only instance referred to in this re- 
port where music is dropped, is evidently due to precisely such a case of in- 
competency. 
3. The music-work must have the active and hearty support, both before 
its introduction and afterward, of the superintendent and other officials in 
charge of the schools. As Supt. L. W. Day, of Cleveland, Ohio, so ably 
and wisely said at San Francisco last summer: “The superintendent should 
understand the scope and purpose of the work so well that he can judge 
fairly of the methods employed, even if he be not able to employ the tests 
of anexpert. Heshould be thoroughly grounded as to what an elementary 
education in music really means. He should give this question much close 
thought, and not leave the whole matter to be brought out by the director 
or teacher of music, no matter how competent the latter may be.” 
In conclusion: It is hoped that the facts and opinions here cited, and the 
conclusions drawn from them, may suggest the lines of effort along which 
the teachers, musicians and educators of our country may wisely work for 
the solution of the questions suggested by President Stewart in his annual 
address to this Department at San Francisco last summer. Indeed, from 
the facts and expressions gathered for this report, as well as from the recent 
action of the Music Teachers’ National Association, it would seem, and we 
may have courage to believe, that the educators and musicians of the coun- 
try are already working along these lines. With these great forces united 
in this effort for the general introduction of music, and the proper teaching 
of it, who can estimate the beneficent results to the millions of children in 
our public schools, and through them to the nation at large? 
THE RELATION OF MUSIC INSTRUCTION TO OUR EDU- 
CATIONAL SYSTEM. 
A. E. WINSHIP, BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS. 
We teach arithmetic for business, geography for commerce, reading for 
information, language for culture, physiology for health, drawing for indus- 
trial art, singing for character and enjoyment. We teach arithmetic and 
geography for the counting-room, reading and language for society, drawing 
for the shop, physiology and singing for the home. We study geography 
and reading that we may know more, arithmetic and drawing that we may 
do more, language that we may say more, physiology and singing that we 
may be more. 
Character is as vital to a man’s success and happiness as intellectual abil- 
ity. It is as important that a man choose right and feel right as that he 
44—N.E. A.  
-P-A-G-E-694
694 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  
know the right. Every subject has its bearing upon a man’s entire life; 
but every subject is focused to accomplish a special thing. That which 
singing may accomplish for man is in every way as important to the man 
and to the world as that which is to be accomplished by arithmetic, geog- 
raphy, language, or drawing. It is not as important as reading, which 
really counts for as much as all the other branches. 
Singing is closely related to health, to choices, to intellectual activity; 
consequently it is vital to the character. A man’s. success in industrial, 
commercial or professional life depends largely upon his courage, peace of 
mind, freshness, hopefulness, and elasticity. Singing is helpful in all these 
directions. To make a man is more important than to make a mechanic; 
to make a good man is more important than to make a great man; to make 
a joyful man is more important than to make a brilliant man. Singing 
should be so taught in the public schools as to accomplish something beyond 
the singing. A child gets a good deal out of arithmetic aside from the 
ability to extract cube root; he gets more out of geography than the loca- 
tion of gulfs, bays, and capes; more out of history than a string of dates; 
more out of language than an acquaintance with the subjunctive mood. 
We must get more out of singing than a knowledge of the scale, or ability 
to sing a song. 
Music-teaching in the public schools must do for the child in thought, 
sympathy, and choice, all that it is capable of accomplishing. There has 
been much teaching of drawing that is the rankest folly; some teaching of 
language that is silly; and there has been much teaching of singing that 
amounted to little aside from ability to use the voice skillfully. Unless 
history and biography have been sadly abused, there is ability in music 
that does not mean high morality or great intellectuality; but rightly used, 
there is more discipline for mind and heart, more discipline for success and 
enjoyment, more discipline for character, in learning to sing, than in learn- 
ing almost any other branch. Thinking and singing ought to be com- 
panions. 
Germany is the only modern nation that has given the world an abun- 
dance of rigorous psychology. Modern thought would be robbed of its power 
were we to erase the names of Kant, Liebnitz, Fichte, and Hegel. At the 
same time, and through the same general period of her history, Germany 
gave the world the intensity of musical grandeur. Handel, Haydn, Mozart, 
Mendelssohn, and Beethoven hold the same rank in the world as do Lieb- 
nitz, Fichte, Kant, and Hegel, and they represent the same age; and, though 
it is one of the untraceable things, I have no question but that there is a 
vital connection between the philosophical and the musical supremacy in 
Germany. 
_In the same way it may be said that the great advance in psychological 
study among teachers, the enthusiasm for intellectual activity in the school- 
room, date from the time that singing in the public schools was so enthusi- 
astically introduced. 
 
-P-A-G-E-695
  MUSIC IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 695 
  
Singing should be taught almost wholly for its effects aside from ability 
to sing. Of course no teaching can be effective that does not produce good 
singing, but Very good singing may be produced with few of the other 
effects. One may sing well and not have the health perceptibly the gainer 
by it, without aiding the voice in reading or conversation, without making 
the disposition sweeter, courage greater, character more reliable, or thinking 
clearer; but singing cannot be well taught that does not, while making in- 
telligent singers, benefit the whole physical being through attitude, breath- 
ing, and vocal elasticity ;. that does not make the thought more keen; that 
does not give greater power of abstract conception; that does not make the 
choices more correct, the moral perceptions more accurate, the disposition 
more uniform, the intellectual, moral, physical life more fervent. 
What the public school wants of singing as a branch of instruction, is 
the grandest possible teaching of the art intellectually and fervently as a 
means of providing the most manhood and womanhood. Singing is to be 
taught the whole child. His entire being, mentally, physically, industrially, 
morally, is to be vibrant with health, elasticity, energy, and cheerfulness. * 
These things being so, singing, when well taught, is as important a sub- 
ject for the school-room as any other branch; and, unlike most other branches, 
it needs to be taught from the lowest primary grade to the highest, in the 
ungraded as in the graded school. It is needed for patriotism, for morality, 
for health. It is needed to make discipline lighter, school attendance more 
regular, school management easier, study more interesting, recitation more 
spirited. What the wings are to the bird, what the blossom is to the plant, 
what the juice is to the fruit, what the eye is to the face, what fervency is to 
the voice, singing is to the school. 
May Nashville hasten the day when singing shall be universally taught, 
when every child from Florida to Texas, from Bangor to Seattle, from Min-~ 
neapolis to New Orleans, shall be so taught in the art of singing as to make 
a brighter student, a nobler man, a better citizen. 
MUSIC IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS—FROM THE MUSIC 
DIRECTOR'S STANDPOINT. 
O. E. MoFADON, MINNEAPOLIS, MINNESOTA. 
I am,asked to treat the subject of music in public schools from the stand- 
point of the director of music. The phrase, “from the standpoint of the 
director of music,” gives me unlimited freedom, and enables me to organize 
(theoretically) the schools of this country in such a way as that the study 
of music will monopolize the teacher’s school-room hours; that all teachers
-P-A-G-E-696
  696 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
must devote their vacations entirely to the study of music, and methods of 
teaching the same; that all other studies may occupy their respective places 
of subordination on the daily program; in short, that the entire school sys- 
tem may be made to revolve around the music department. 
Iam reminded, however, of a saying of a modern statesman, that “our 
individual rights end where the rights of others begin,” and as the superin- 
tendent, the teacher and the parents all have rights which should be te- 
spected, and which are to-day to be heralded by advocates who have an 
authorized right to speak from their respective standpoints with equal free- 
dom, I am constrained to speak as I have to do—with charitable reference 
to the just rights of others. 
Argument before this body in favor of music as a school study seems ut- 
terly useless, as I believe that all teachers of the present day would give it 
a place on their daily program. That a musical exercise in the school-room 
has a salutary effect upon organization and discipline, will not be gainsaid 
by any present. That, as a study—if properly taught—music contributes 
as much to the development of the perceptive faculties as does any of the 
sciences, may be questioned by those who have not seen the results of the 
best teaching; but, as methods are improved upon, the time is fast coming 
when statements like this may be made with greater impunity, and heard 
with greater credence than now. 
Until recent years the history of music in the public schools of this coun- 
try was identical with its history in the larger cities, but more recently 
smaller cities and towns are adopting it to an extent that is gratifying to its 
devotees. 
One of the most encouraging signs of the times is the organization and 
maintenance of a Department of Music Education in the National Educa- 
tional Association. This step seems eminently in the right direction, as the 
work of making the masses musical depends more upon the teaching frater- 
nity than upon the musical profession. 
Summer normal music schools have been numerous where music in public 
schools was a side-show, but the normal music school is fast obtaining which 
has public-school music as the central idea. The natural reason of this is, 
that the fact is becoming generally conceded that the study cannot be made 
a success in the public schools without intelligent supervision, and that the 
supply of competent supervisors and special teachers of music is far less 
than the demand. 
The idea that music cannot be taught by any but musicians, is fallacious. © 
In the light of past experience it is safe to say that the average school- 
teacher, well drilled in the principles and art of teaching, will get better 
practical results in music than will the average musician. It is a palpable 
fact that many so-called music-teachers do not, by their teaching, really 
make thinkers in music, but are merely teachers of the notation and of the 
manipulation of mechanical instruments. The difficulty lies in the.fact that
-P-A-G-E-697
MUSIC IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 697 
  
the objects to be taught— being purely mental—are made subordinate and 
incidental to the notation, or to the instrument, when the opposite should 
be the case. The relative positions of two notes (not tones) means nothing 
definite to the singer, if he has not become familiar through the ear with 
the relation of the tones represented. No explanation or picture of “steps,” 
or “half-steps,” or of any interval, ever yet gave anybody the ability to think or 
sing the tones thus described or represented. The truth of this statement 
may be generally conceded, and yet teachers will continue to expect chil- 
dren to do from representations, things with which their ears and minds are 
entirely unacquainted. 
The ability of a class to sing the major scale correctly is sufficient basis 
for success in teaching all there is to be taught, relating to the subject of 
tune, in the art of reading, without any further singing on the part of the 
teacher. The teacher, however, must necessarily proceed “from the known 
to the unknown,” and must always teach “the thing to be learned [which 
in music is always invisible] before the sign.” In my visits to the schools 
of other cities than my own, I find that those supervisors who prohibit the 
teachers’ singing entirely, get the best results in music-reading. 
I formerly believed in rote-singing, carrying it even into the third grade; 
I afterwards limited it to the second grade; now the real rote-singing is 
done in the first grade, and in the first half of the first year. The system of 
musical instruction which provides for two or three years of rote-singing 
before mental analysis is required, cannot but be unsatisfactory. It is no 
more true education in the way of making readers than would be the learn- 
ing by memory the answers to problems without a knowledge of the process 
of obtaining them. It requires only a thought of human nature to convince 
one that pupils thus accustomed to such parrot-like training, having thus 
far borne no responsibility, will desire and demand a continuance of the 
same kind of treatment. Every teacher of experience will appreciate the 
difficulty, then, of coming down to first principles and beginning mental 
analysis of time and tune, without which there is no intelligent music-read- 
ing nor mental discipline. To quote a modern writer and a popular opinion: 
“Rote-singing is to be regarded with distrust, because it offers so many se- 
ductions from the path of rigorous study by which the end is attained.” I 
am aware that the advocates of imitation methods are very sensitive on this 
point, and never fail to present their claims for the importance of the study 
of phrasing; but the idea of making a specialty of phrasing at the begin- 
ning, with the hope that children will learn to read by absorption, is im- 
practicable in the extreme. There would be as much reason in papering a 
house before plastering, or in putting on the varnish before the paint. 
The proper study of singing is a far better mental discipline than is the 
study of any mechanical instrument. The performer knowing his instru- 
ment can produce by its aid the tones represented by the printed music 
without a previous mental conception of the tones. The singer, however, 
   
-P-A-G-E-698
  698 THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
must think the individual tones and intervals, before the voice, having no 
aid of other voice or instrument, can produce them. The folly, then, of 
teaching singing by the aid (?) of an instrument beomes apparent, as the in- 
strument, relieving the singer as it does of all exercise of mind which would 
otherwise be necessary, becomes a hindrance to real progress, rather than 
an aid. 
As to the justness and propriety of making the subject general as against 
teaching the talented alone, I would but mention the fact that “God does 
not darken the sun to those who cannot fully apprehend its glory,” and the 
oft-quoted “The man that hath no music in his soul,” etc., but shows the 
universal need for music. It will be remembered, also, that he that had 
but one talent was punished for not using it. It is very true that some will 
not make musicians; but as this would be equally true of any other branch, 
and as this end is not at all desirable, the argument is futile. Certainly all 
who in any way come under its influence will be benefitted in some degree. 
It is the exception where the unmusical child does not become somewhat 
musical by reason of being with classes that sing daily. 
It is the policy of many supervisors of music, first, to have music made 
compulsory by action of the school board; next, to establish an invincible 
Jaw that all pupils shall be examined periodically in the theory for promo- 
tion; and upon this basis proceed, in the happy expectation that satisfactory 
results will follow if these important points are constantly held up as a 
stimulant before the pupils. I am inclined to look with disfavor upon this 
arbitrary method. I believe that music should be made compulsory in all 
public schools, but I should think the teacher very unwise who would exer- 
cise the right of compulsion to the extent of attempting to compel children 
to sing. I say “attempting,” for that is as much as can possibly be done in 
this direction. Children can no more be compelled to sing than horses can 
be compelled to drink; and to say “You shall sing,” is as foolish as to say 
“Look pleasant, you villain!” It would be more conducive to the proper 
development of character, and more in keeping with the true nature and 
object of the exercise, rather, to make the conditions such that pupils will 
desire to sing. The judicious teacher will then take advantage of the op- 
portunity to give such instruction and practice as are necessary for their 
development, and the study, instead of degenerating into a loathsome exer- 
cise, will become highly exhilarating. 
Examinations are supposed to test the pupils’ knowledge of the subject, 
The examination questions, therefore, should be based upon the nature and 
extent of the work done, and hence be a true index of its character. I 
may voice the experience of others present when I say that more than once 
when the time for examination was approaching, have I made a specialty 
of theory to such an extent as was necessary for purposes of success in the 
pending examination; and had it not been for the examinations—which I 
thought must take place or the whole structure would crumble—I should
-P-A-G-E-699
  MUSIC IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 699 
not have taught theory at all, believing, as I do, that the study of singing 
should be nine-tenths practice. The examination, then, being wholly theo- 
retical, becomes a mere farce, and is not a true index of the character of 
the whole work done. The question arises, then, Shall examinations be 
abolished, or shall they be made practical ? 
When I entered upon my present work, I found there a system of semi- 
annual examinations in theory in grades above the primary. These were 
kept up for two years, principally for holding-up purposes. At that time 
the applications for excuse from music were many, but the excused pupils 
were made responsible equally with the others in the examinations. The 
last two years no examinations have been required in music, and no pupils 
excused. Those pupils who would be excused from the music-lesson are re- 
quired to sit in good position, to own and hold a book, and give their best 
attention, but are not required to sing unless they so choose. The result is, 
that many so-called unmusical pupils fall into line and do fair work. Sue- 
cess in this, however, depends much upon the bearing of the regular teacher, 
and her skill in handling the class. Thus, rebellion, not being expected, 
nor countenanced when it exists, seldom occurs, and the resulting attitude 
of pupils, however unmusical, toward the study of music is very much more 
satisfactory. I find no examinations, with other conditions thus properly 
modified, to be better than mere theoretical examinations, and I hope that, 
as teachers become stronger in use of practical methods, the possibility of 
successful practical examinations may increase. 
The most effectual examination is the vigilant daily watchfulness of the 
teacher, giving attention to the individual without relaxing her grasp upon 
the class. This presupposes good discipline and teaching ability, which 
should be expected of the average teacher. 
While teachers generally agree as to the relative importance of practice 
and theory, yet many do not practice what they preach. As a rule, teach- 
ers teach theory abstractly from practice. Some teachers devote a few 
minutes of each lesson to theory; others give entire lessons in theory peri- 
odically; some give certain weeks to theory; and one teacher of my acquaint- 
ance carries the abstraction to the extent of giving it during certain months 
of the year. I do not believe in teaching theory as such at all, but would 
rather lead the pupils to do the things necessary to make them intelligent 
readers by the use of such practical methods as will develop the necessary 
knowledge of theory unconsciously to the pupils. 
The regular teacher is justly held responsible for the maintenance of dis- 
cipline in her school; and as good discipline is more necessary to success in 
music than is scholarship, on the part of the teacher, it becomes a matter of 
vital importance to the special teacher. The special teacher, visiting all 
schools, as he frequently does, has superior opportunities for discovering 
the best disciplined schools (which he duly appreciates), and quite natur- 
ally becomes so critical of the discipline that he will often unconsciously

estimate the success of a forthcoming lesson immediately upon entering a 
room. 
I do not regard the subject of voice-culture as second in importance to 
that of the art of reading. But as reading can best be taught in childhood, 
it naturally comes first. Care and management of the voice, however, should 
not be neglected, and though of the utmost importance, may be made purely 
incidental. Concerning voice-care, there is no general direction which may 
be so easily understood and followed, as that schools sing softly and in the 
medium range. If all teachers would remember this advice and practice 
it, no injury to voices would result from singing in the schools; and the 
tone of the writings of voice specialists, relative to the alleged pernicious 
effects of public-school singing, would materially change. Special vocal 
exercises may be necessary for adults who may have lost their natural 
voices by loud, boisterous and meaningless singing, but they are no more 
suitable nor necessary for public-school children than are the remedies of 
the invalid necessary for the prevention of disease in children. 
Educators in the line of school-music are fast coming to believe that the 
very best age for the actual study of music is the earlier years of school- 
life. It is true that much more interest can be created in the lower grades _ 
than in the higher, and that in the higher grades there is a falling-off of 
interest because of attention to other matters of alleged greater importance, 
of the change in boys’ voices, etc. There are other difficulties in the way 
of the higher-grade music of the schools where I teach, which I suppose is 
true of any rapidly-growing city, bringing, as it does, children of all ages 
and attainment, a very small percentage of which had training in music 
commensurate with that in other branches upon which they depend for 
grade. In most manufacturing cities, especially where education is not 
compulsory, the average school-life is much shorter than in other cities. 
With these facts in mind, it behooves us then to make the best possible prog- 
ress with music in the lower grades, where the conditions are naturally the 
most favorable. I would not monopolize the child’s time for the study of 
music, but would rather economize in the use of the time which justly be- 
longs to it. This may be promoted by strict adherence to educational prin- 
ciples, and by promptness with the lesson. 
I have said that I consider argument in favor of music as a school study 
unnecessary before this assembly; but I cannot forbear quoting a few words 
of wisdom from Dr. Duryea, who says: 
“Music assists in sharpening the powers of discrimination. It checks impulsive 
mental action, makes it deliberate and rhythmical. It provides for movement in 
concert with others, and causes the mind to accustom itself to sympathetic action 
with other minds. 
“Music in the home, in social gatherings, in common assemblies of the people, 
relaxes the strain of life, releases from its cares and vexations, soothes its pains 
and sorrows, and harmonizes mind with mind and heart with heart. If vocal music 
shall become general in this country, it will ease the frictions of life, inspire con- 
tentment, promote cheerfulness, and aid in bringing to pass the era of good-feeling 
and good-will.”

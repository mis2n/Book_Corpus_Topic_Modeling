PREFACE 
It is to the New Method of Bacon, refined, corrected, 
and supplemented by the older method first fully 
described by Aristotle, that the world owes its present 
condition and rate of progress. By whatever path he 
may prefer, the teacher must go back to these primal ’ 
sources of thought and efficiency for his teaching 
models, because there are no others. This volume 
seeks in due measure to accomplish for the young 
teacher what Mill and Jevons and Mach have done for 
the man of science; namely, to impress upon him the 
few but vital mental processes that alone lead to en- 
during results. 
Whatever function vicariousness may have to per- 
form in the ethical world, it has none whatever in that 
of intellect, for in education no man is invested with 
the right to think for another; to do so is to negate 
at once the chief end for which we educate. If, as we 
are told, the immortal gods laugh with inextinguishable 
laughter at the follies of men, their glee must indeed 
be great when they behold a teacher trying to educate 
his students by doing their thinking for them. But 
perhaps the gods do not laugh; it may be they weep. 
Insight and efficiency are the two supreme results 
to be secured by our methods of instruction, for out of

  vi PREFACE 
insight grows what the world calls culture, and out 
of efficiency, mental discipline. Culture is the total 
refining effect —intellectual, emotional, and volitional 
—produced by insight into the meaning of what is 
learned; its quality depends upon the nature of the 
subject-matter, and its quantity upon the scope and 
intensity of the insight. Mental discipline is the in- 
tellectual effect produced by training in the use of 
what is gained by insight; its quality depends upon 
the nature of the subject-matter, and its quantity upon 
the scope and intensity of the training. We should not, 
therefore, try to distinguish between cultural and non- 
cultural instruction, for all teaching is cultural in 
proportion to the extent and quality of the insight it 
enables the student to attain. All instruction, likewise, 
is disciplinary to the extent that it renders the student 
efficient in the use of what he has learned. Culture 
and discipline are accordingly the inevitable concomi- 
tants of all good instruction, and they become in turn 
the just measure of its effectiveness. To gain insight, 
the student must be incited to think ; to gain efficiency, 
he must be stimulated to do. His practice must be 
saturated with thought; his thought made rich and 
concrete by his practice. 
It is the hope of the author that the study of this 
book will help to render these and other important 
principles axiomatic in the mind of the teacher, so that 
easily, naturally, and at last inevitably, he will instinc- 
tively employ the methods that lead to insight and 
efficiency ; and that ultimately he will become as in-

capable of using the false in method as the artist is 
of portraying the ugly in art. 
That the use of the book may not invite to a violation 
of the very principles it most insists upon, topics for 
discussion are placed at the close of the various sec- 
tions, to be assigned, perhaps in advance, to the mem- 
bers of the class for recitation and report. The topics 
assume an understanding of the sections to which 
they relate, and in addition offer both student and 
teacher opportunity and incentive to pour into them 
all that study, thought, and previous experience can 
contribute. 
Volume I of this work treats of The Studies. Con- 
trary to the original intention, it has been deemed best 
to restrict the present volume to The Processes of 
Instruction, and to reserve for a third, the remaining 
important topic in the principles of secondary educa- 
tion, namely, The Processes of Training. 
The author desires to express his sense of obligation 
to Albert Anthony Giesecke, of Cornell University, for 
his kindness in reading manuscript and proof, and to 
Willard James Fisher, of the Cornell Department of 
Physics, for scrutinizing the examples drawn from the 
natural sciences.

CHAPTER I 
THE ACQUISITION OF FACTS 
1. By Authority 
  1. How does the ‘out-of-school’ world acquire its 
facts? Evidently in two ways, at first hand through direct 
observation and experiment, and at second hand through 
authoritative transmission by word of mouth or by printed 
page. Both methods are essential, since past events are 
not subject to observation, nor would progress be possible 
did not men acquire at least some knowledge at first 
hand. 
Courts, which deal largely with past events, have their 
rules of evidence whereby they hope to sift the truth from 
unintentional error or wilful perjury. Miinsterberg sug- 
gests that courts should use the methods of experimental 
psychology in detecting false testimony, since for one 
thing it is found that untruthful answers to questions 
occupy more time than do truthful ones. The reason 
for this is that the witness involuntarily takes at least 
a little additional time to consider the probable bear- 
ings of what he proposes to say, whereas if he be- 
lieves his evidence to be truthful throughout, there is 
3
-P-A-G-E-14
. 
. 4 SCIENTIFIC BASIS FOR HIGH-SCHOOL METHODS 
  no need for hesitation.1 This, however, would be test- 
ing evidence by experiment. 
Historians, who record and explain past events, have 
also their methods of sifting truth from error. Thus, there 
are at least half a dozen different accounts by eye-witnesses 
of the precise manner in which Gustavus Adolphus met 
his death at the battle of Liitzen. It is only by comparing 
these accounts with one another, eliminating inconsisten- 
cies and absurdities, and taking account of inherent prob- 
abilities that the real facts can be determined with any 
considerable degree of certainty. 
The acquisition of facts at second hand in the school, 
-however, constitutes a different problem. The authen- 
; “ticity of the facts themselves is not questioned; the need 
of imparting them by the authority of teacher or book 
and the manner of so doing are the only important t ques- 
tions. { Occasionally one hears or reads the categorical 
imperative, “Teach no facts at second hand that may ed 
be be acquired ed by the student at first hand.” Though the 
‘motive of this maxim is good, its ts effect, could it be fol- 
lowed, would be bad; for it ignores the limitations of time, 
and the magnitude of what is to be acquired by the stu- 
dent in a few years. He is called upon to recapitulate the 
essentials of race experience in every grand department of 
human and natural science, so that even with the best 
of teaching he could find out for himself at first hand
-P-A-G-E-15
THE ACQUISITION OF FACTS 5 * 
but a fragment of what should be acquired. The chief 
advantage, therefore, of the communication of facts by 
authority is that it saves time, thus enabling the student 
to make much more rapid progress than would otherwise 
be possible. Its disadvantages are obvious and pro- 
nounced. In the first place it tends to beget a passive 
attitude of mind, which leads to lack of vividness in the 
ideas concerned and to consequent indifference toward 
the subject itself. A second disadvantage is that where 
the facts are of vital importance because of their weight 
in determining causes or effects (classifications or gen- 
eralizations), their rapid acquisition often prevents full 
recognition of their significance. A youth may acquire 
the facts of physics so rapidly that he fails to comprehend 
even the simplest laws of the subject; he may cram him- 
self so full of the facts and dates of history that his mind 
has neither time nor incentives to understand the meaning 
of what he has learned. The student who thus stuffs his 
mind with unassimilated facts is like the voracious reader 
of newspaper or novel; but he who acquires only so fast 
as he can assimilate resembles the investigator, whose 
new facts though few are full of meaning. 
The investigator takes his facts where he can get them, 
but if they are important for the confirmation or refutation 
of theories, principles, causes, or effects, he scrutinizes 
them carefully and where possible subjects them to tests 
to be sure that they are true.  
-P-A-G-E-16
6 SCIENTIFIC BASIS FOR HIGH-SCHOOL METHODS 
Once, however, it was sufficient for the acceptance of 
the truth of an assertion, such as, “Gravity causes heavy 
bodies to fall more rapidly than light ones,” that some emi- 
nent authority, like Aristotle, had made it. Francis Bacon 
convinced the world some three hundred years ago that 
the old custom of receiving material facts upon bare au- 
thority was an unwise one, and he proposed a new method 
whereby men should test old assertions and discover new 
facts by direct observation and experiment. This method 
is now used in all departments of human learning. Every 
alleged fact in every field of learning is now subject to 
the search-light of the investigator. If it cannot bear the 
light, it is discarded as error. 
2. By Observation 
  2. Two very obvious advantages follow from accepting 
Bacon’s method of acquiring and verifying facts by direct 
observation: (1) greater certainty that the knowledge thus 
gained is true, and (2) the greater vividness with which it 
is impressed upon the mind. The latter advantage is of 
particular importance to the student, since he must 
recapitulate the experience of the race so rapidly that if 
this vividness is lacking, both comprehension and reten- 
tion are impaired. So patent are the advantages of ac- 
quiring knowledge at first hand by direct observation that 
the prescription of this method, especially in the natural
-P-A-G-E-17
THE ACQUISITION OF FACTS 7 
sciences, has become a commonplace of modern literature 
on education. The reception of large masses of unques- 
tioned facts imparted by the method of bare authority 
tends to clog and deaden the mind; whereas the acqui- 
sition of new facts by observation arouses the curiosity, 
throws the mind into the state of active attention, promotes 
rapidity of comprehension, and awakens interest. The 
best, perhaps, of any device known to the schoolmaster, 
it simulates the situations of real life at its best, and 
thus arouses to activity a set of powers that would other- 
wise remain dormant. 
3. Observation both in and out of the school has 
as a matter of course an apperceptive basis. What we see 
and how we interpret what we perceive depend upon our 
stock of knowledge and our prevailing interests. One mind 
may be alert and curious, another dull and indifferent, but 
both acquire and interpret new experiences in the light 
of those with which they are most familiar. This leads 
to what may be called the bias of apperception. Huxley 
declares that not one man in a hundred will observe a 
phenomenon of nature with accuracy and adequacy. 
“So,” he remarks, “we are shut up to this— that the 
business of education is, in the first place, to provide the 
young with the means and the habit of observation; and 
secondly to supply the subject-matter of knowledge either 
in the shape of science or of art, or of both combined.” * 
1 “Science and Education,” p. 175.
-P-A-G-E-18
8 SCIENTIFIC BASIS FOR HIGH-SCHOOL METHODS 
What, then, is the difference between the observation that 
is loose and inaccurate and that which is precise and ade- 
quate? Huxley says, again, “The man of science simply 
uses with scrupulous exactness the methods which we all, 
habitually and at every moment, use carelessly.” This 
kind of observation, therefore, rests upon adequate knowl- 
edge, requisite care, and scholarly or professional interest. 
The difficulty of making discoveries and inventions 
shows that it is one thing to see and quite another to per- 
ceive the relations of what is observed to other things. 
How many times must not the expansive power of steam 
have been observed before it occurred to Watt to utilize 
its force! Earthworms have been observed in all ages, 
but the effect they have upon the soil was not discovered 
until recent times.? Everybody has observed how easily 
water runs through sand, yet until the present few, if any, 
have thought to confine it in the bottom of a ditch to make 
a drain. Scientific observation is greatly assisted by care- 
ful record of what is seen, for in this there is incentive for 
reflection and further observation. Thus Lord Rayleigh 
and William Ramsey * in comparing the weight of nitro- 
gen derived from chemicals with that derived from air 
noticed that that which came from air was the heavier.

It is related that the fact was recorded with the written 
admonition, “Look into this.’ At a subsequent time 
they did so, and discovered argon, a hitherto unknown 
element of the air This explains why modern teachers 
of science lay so much stress upon keeping a careful record 
of everything observed. As Bain asserts, observation is 
sense impression plus inference. Without both one can- 
not properly observe, but poor observation always results 
from an unjustified admixture of inference with sense im- 
pression. If we infer too,much, we think we perceive 
what is not true; if we infer too little, we are of those 
who, “having eyes, see not.”” Indolence in reflection or 
preoccupation may easily prevent the proper inference; 
prejudice or prepossession may induce a wrong one. 
If we do not know what to look for in a given department 
of knowledge, both facts and their significance escape us, 
while indifference leads to the same result.

" x. Detectives. 2. Scholars. 3. Physicians. 4. Economists. 
5. Statesmen. 6. Primitive men. 
4. Observation rests primarily upon the unaided use 
of the senses, but science has devised a number of instru- 
ments by which it may be greatly extended. Among the 
chief of these are the following: telescope, microscope, 
spectroscope, dissecting tools, coloring materials, photo- 
1 Cavendish in making his analysis of the atmosphere in 1783 de- 
tected an unexplained residuum, which is now known to be argon.

graphic camera, stereopticon, balance, measuring appa- 
tatus, thermometer, and barometer. 
Discussion : — Place and function of each of these instru- 
mentalities in high-school studies. 
5. Observation, or the gaining of knowledge at first 
hand, has three essential stages. The first stage is the 
identification of objects by their characteristics, whether 
qualities or actions. By the brilliant crimson of this fallen 
autumn leaf, I know that it came from a maple tree. I 
judge by the song of yon distant warbler that it is a thrush. 
The rustle in the waste-paper basket bespeaks the mouse. 
The muffled creaking of the stairs at midnight intimates 
the stealthy approach of the intruder. We are on the old 
battle-field of Jena. In the distance rises a tapering object. 
It is probably a monument. Nearer approach shows the 
object to be located in a valley. Nowa shape like a belfry 
comes to view. It is a church spire. 
The second stage of observation is the use of our stored-up 
knowledge or experience to anticipate further observation 
of characteristics, in order that the identification may be 
complete. I catch a glimpse of a fleeting form in the 
bushes. It looks like a quail. If it is a quail, it will have 
a rapid, whirring flight, a plump brown form, and a ‘Bob- 
White’ whistle. Going farther, I flush the bird, perceive 
the form of body, the manner of flight, and then after a time 
hear the sound of his call. Now I am sure of the identifica- 
tion. In the second stage of observation it is the class
-P-A-G-E-21
  
THE ACQUISITION OF FACTS EL 
which suggests the additional characteristics to be looked 
for. As soon as the fleeting glimpse of the running object 
in the bushes suggested the class quail, the well-known 
characteristics of this class at once flashed into the mind, 
and in this way became anticipations of what would 
probably be found upon further observation. Should 
the first tentative observation lead to a wrong identifica- 
tion, the anticipations suggested by it will not be fulfilled. 
Thus, if hearing a whistle that I think is made by a quail, 
I turn the corner expecting to see the little performer him- 
self, but find instead a cage containing a mocking-bird 
which is mimicking the ‘Bob-White’ call, my first interpre- 
tation is seen to be erroneous, and all the anticipations it 
suggested are found to be without validity. In such cases 
the mind instantly readjusts its observations to conform 
with facts. 
The third stage of observation is the storing up of our 
experience in general terms. To illustrate how this occurs, 
the classification of moths may be used. All of us are more 
or less acquainted with them, how they fly by night and 
are destructive to vegetation and fabrics. One is named 
the hawk-moth, another the army-worm moth, the cod- 
ling moth, etc. Here on the desk, however, is a prepara- 
tion of moths that came from Germany. The wings 
and bodies are variegated in browns and yellows, but upon 
the top of the thorax is a curious marking in dark brown 
and light gray that reminds one of the representation of 
 
-P-A-G-E-22
    12 SCIENTIFIC BASIS FOR HIGH-SCHOOL METHODS 
skull and cross-bones used on bottles containing poison. 
The label on the preparation is as follows, Acherontia 
atropos. Totenkopf. It is the death’s-head moth, of which 
one may read, but which is never seen alive in the United 
States. There are three of the moths in this collection, 
and we immediately assume that there is a whole class of 
the creatures somewhere in the world. Our observation 
of these new distinctive markings in an old class, namely, 
moths, has therefore enabled us to form the nucleus for a 
class new to us, namely, death’s-head. In this way our 
observations become stored up in new general terms, or 
as new elements in old ones. 
Recapitulating, we see that observation involves three 
stages: first, the tentative identification of objects by 
their characteristic qualities or actions; second, the use 
of experience stored up in our knowledge of classes to 
anticipate further perception of characteristics, in order 
that the first observation may be verified and completed; 
third, the storing up of new experience in general terms. 
It is in this triple fashion that observation gives rise to 
and develops our knowledge.' 
6. Much useful knowledge has been gained by pure 
observation unaided by experiment. It was in this way 
probably that Aristotle laid the foundations of zodlogy, 
by describing some five hundred different kinds of animals, 
1 The logical implications of this exposition are well set forth in Dr. 
Wm. T. Harris’s “Psychologic Foundations of Education,” pp. 62-89.
-P-A-G-E-23
     
  THE ACQUISITION OF FACTS 
collected for the most part by soldiers in the armies of 
Alexander the Great. It is chiefly by such observation 
that the great classifications in botany like those of Linnzus 
have been made, to say nothing of the epoch-making 
labors of Darwin, Wallace, Bain, Huxley, and the other 
great biologists of the nineteenth century. The same has 
been true in the domains of astronomy, geology, anthro- 
pology, ethnology, and the like. It is the keen observer 
of men and manners that produces our novels, our social 
essays, and our dramas. There are, however, many as- 
pects of nature in which observation alone even when 
aided by scientific instruments does not enable us to discover 
facts and their relations; as, for instance, what force gravity 
exerts at different distances, the cause of yellow fever, 
the function of nitrogen in plant life. The reason for this 
inadequacy of observation is that the phenomena in ques- 
tion are so complicated with others that the observer is 
unable to separate the real from the seeming. Thus, the 
mosquito has been suspected for two thousand years of 
having an office in the transmission of disease, but this 
suspicion has been verified only in very recent times. The 
device which men have hit upon to overcome this inade- 
quacy of direct observation is to vary phenomena under 
controllable circumstances. Such variation under control 
is called experiment. 
   
-P-A-G-E-24
  14 SCIENTIFIC BASIS FOR HIGH-SCHOOL METHODS 
3. By Experiment 
7. Huxley calls experiment artificial observation. By 
this he means that it is a variation of phenomena under 
controllable circumstances in order to aid observation. 
The first purpose of an experiment is to enable the 
experimenter to determine some fact, truth, principle, 
cause, or effect; as, for instance, whether there is any 
difference in the force of gravity exerted at the top of 
St. Paul’s Cathedral and at its foot; what is the effect 
of heat upon the red precipitate of mercury? is there poison 
in the stomach of this corpse, or indication of rabies in the 
brain of this dog? does a culture from the throat indicate 
diphtheria? are there typhoid germs in the water supply? 
are there malarial bacteria in the blood of this patient? 
has this animal tuberculosis? what effect upon the expan- 
sion or contraction of metals has heat? cold? or, again, 
what is the effect of indiscriminate charity upon the 
tramp nuisance? what is the effect of publicity upon cor- 
porate mismanagement ? 
The second purpose of the experiment is to determine 
quantity; as, for example, to determine by means of the 
balance the exact quantity of each element in a compound; 
to measure the amount of heat, moisture, carbon dioxide, 
ozone, salt, or argon in the atmosphere; to learn how much 
power-producing gas goes to waste in smelting furnaces, 
1 Investigated by Hooke.

THE ACQUISITION OF FACTS 15 
in coke ovens; the per cent. of energy utilized in gas-en- 
gines, in steam-engines; how rapidly a falling body is 
accelerated by gravity. The so-called exact sciences are 
especially benefited by quantitative experiment, and the 
social, political, and inexact natural sciences by the first 
or qualitative experiment. 
Discussion: — Character of the experiments possible in 
the various high-school studies. 
8. So important is the experiment as a means for 
acquiring knowledge that it warrants a somewhat detailed 
exposition. 
(1) The Variable and the Variant 
Experiment as an artificial aid to observation involves 
the idea of a variable and a variant. The variable is the 
element that we change at will, while the variant is the 
corresponding effect. Thus, when we apply changing 
amounts of heat to a metal rod and notice that for each 
increase in temperature there is an increase in the length 
of the rod, heat is the variable and expansion the variant. 
When we compress air to see how much heat is generated, 
dimension is the variable and heat the variant. 
(2) Control of the Variable 
An experiment would be lacking in accuracy if the 
variable, z.¢., the element that is changed at will, were not 
 
-P-A-G-E-26
16 SCIENTIFIC BASIS FOR HIGH-SCHOOL METHODS 
under the control of the experimenter, for otherwise exact 
repetition by any person at any time would not be pos- 
sible. Thus, to test the power of windmills by fitful and 
uncontrollable breezes would be difficult, but by placing 
the windmills at the end of a bar revolving at known rates, 
the variable is perfectly under control. Men do not like 
to wait until steamships are built to find out how fast 
they can go, but first make models of the ships and test 
them in tanks of water. The change in rate of speed is 
the variable, while the corresponding resistance of the water 
is the variant. 
By similar methods the efficiency of gas and steam- 
engines may be determined, the variable element being 
always under control. 
Sometimes men attempt to control the variable when 
nature does it better. As an illustration Galileo’s scheme 
for determining the velocity of light may be chosen. He 
proposed that two men, A and B, with dark lanterns, should 
be stationed at points a considerable distance apart. A 
was first to flash the light from his lantern; then B was 
to open his as soon as he saw A’s light, while A was to 
count the seconds that elapsed from the time he opened 
his own lantern until he saw the light from B’s. This 
would be the measure of the time it took the light to go 
from A to B and back again. 
This experiment could not succeed, for, as we now 
know, light travels 18,600 miles in a tenth of a second,

  THE ACQUISITION OF FACTS 17 
a much less time than it would take A and B to open 
and close the shutters. The variable in this case defies 
control. But Galileo made a telescope with which he 
discovered the moons of Jupiter. This fact enabled 
another man, Olaf Rémer, to measure the velocity of 
light by watching Jupiter’s moons. This time nature 
controlled the variable for him, though it took half a year 
to complete the observation. 
Jupiter is 483,000,000 miles from the earth, and takes 
eleven and three-quarter years to complete a revo-

lution about the sun; therefore it moves but slowly 
through its orbit. By observing any one of Jupiter’s 
moons, Rémer determined the period of its revolu- 
tion about the mother planet. But, perhaps to his sur- 
prise, the times of revolution varied at different times of

our year. They were shortest when the earth was near- 
est Jupiter and longest when farthest from it. In the

‘orbit of Jupiter; let J represent Jupiter with its shadow 
and M one of its moons. 4, is the earth when nearest

Sis the sun. The period that elapses from one disappear- 
ance of Jupiter’s moon in the shadow until the next is 
the time of its revolution. As the earth moves around its 
orbit toward Eo, the time of revolution of Jupiter’s moon 
seems to lengthen, until when the earth reaches E, it is 
164 minutes longer than when at Z,. On the other hand, 
as the earth again approaches its position at Ey, the time 
of revolution correspondingly shortens. Rémer at once 
surmised that this variation was not due to any irregularity 
in the revolution of Jupiter’s moon, but to the additional 
time necessary for the light coming from the satellite to 
traverse the distance from EZ, to Z,. Knowing the distance 
across the earth’s orbit from Z, to Z,, he had but to divide 
this by 164 to find how far light travels in a minute, and 
this result by 60 to know how far it goes in a second, or 
186,000 miles. 
As Mach* observes, this method is exactly that of 
Galileo, except that the conditions are better and nature 
controls the variable, namely, the varying distances at

which the observations are taken, while Jupiter’s shadow 
furnishes the one dark lantern necessary for the experiment. 
It was in 1675-1676 that Rémer, for the first time in the 
history of the world, measured in this manner the velocity 
of light. Now by means of perforated revolving disks any 
well-equipped laboratory can perform the experiment pro- 
posed by Galileo within the limits of the laboratory, since 
men have learned how to control the variable. 
Discussion: — Show how the variable is controlled in 
an experiment in: 1. Physics. 2. Chemistry. 3. On men- 
tal effects of fatigue. 4. On the effect of omitting number 
work from the first two grades. 
(3) Maintenance of Similarity of Condition 
Unless conditions are ‘kept similar throughout an experi-   
ment or a series of experiments, the results will not be con- 
clusive. Thus, when Newton proposed to test by the use 
of the pendulum the effect of gravity upon substances of 
equal weight but of different constitution, say a pound 
of lead and a pound of feathers, he arranged a set of uni- 
form cylindrical boxes to be suspended from pendulums. 
In these boxes he could place equal weights of the various 
substances and learn by the periods of vibration whether 
before the court of gravity a pound of feathers is the equiva- 
lent of a pound of lead. 
Joule’s* experiment to show that changes in the intrinsic 
energy of a gas are manifest as changes in temperature,

derives much of its convincing force by the maintenance of 
similarity of conditions. He took two vessels, one empty 
and the other filled with gas at a high pressure, connected 
them with a stop-cock, and submerged both in a third 
vessel filled with water. Then he opened the stop-cock 
and observed the results. The water in which the two 
vessels were submerged did not change its temperature, 
thus showing that a gas expanding into a vacuum, and so 
doing no work, neither warms nor cools its surroundings, 
within the limits of error of observation. 
Discussion: — Efforts made to preserve similarity of con- 
ditions in agricultural experiment stations; in testing the men- 
tal effects of fatigue in school children. 
(4) Collective Experiments 
Many experiments admit of a collective or cumulative 
result, as may be illustrated by the use of sand upon a 
vibrating metal plate to show where the centres of vibra- 
tion and of relative quiescence are. Ina similar manner, 
iron filings may be used to reveal to the eye lines of electric 
force. Melting wax upon heated crystals will show whether 
the heat applied is conducted uniformly or not. The 
parabolic path of a jet of water under pressure intimates 
to sight what the path of a projectile will be. The motions 
of invisible gases may be rendered visible by producing 
within them a cloud, such as is made by smoke, dust, 
fumes, etc.

  CHAPTER II 
THE MEANING OF FACTS — THEIR 
EXPLANATION 
1. The Problem 
9. The term problem is used in two senses: (1) a task or 
exercise set for the application of rules or principles already 
established, as a problem in mathematics; (2) something 
to be investigated, that causes or effects may be discovered, 
classifications established, or generalizations derived; as, 
what is the cause of dew? according to what law is light 
diffused? in what class does the amphioxus belong? The 
outside world is, of course, interested only in problems of 
the second kind. 
A problem in the second sense arises when there is in- 
congruence between facts and thoughts, whereas stable 
customary relations between facts and ideas give rise to 
few problems. When it is asked, Why does iron rust? 
the fact of rusting is apparent, but the reason may be un- 
known. In this case a problem arises. In the words of 
Mach: “ The Child just awakening into consciousness of 
the world knows no problems. The bright flower, the 
ringing bell, are new to it; yet it is surprised at nothing. 
25
-P-A-G-E-32
  22 SCIENTIFIC BASIS FOR HIGH-SCHOOL METHODS 
The out and out Philistine, whose only thoughts lie in 
the beaten path of his everyday pursuits, likewise has no 
problems. Everything goes its wonted course, and if per- 
chance a thing go wrong at times, it is at most a mere 
object of curiosity and not worth serious consideration. 
In fact, the question ‘Why ?’ loses all warrant in relations 
where we are familiar with every aspect of events. But 
the capable and talented young man has his head full of 
problems; he has acquired to a greater or less degree cer- 
tain habitudes of thought, and at the same time he is 
constantly observing new and unwonted facts, and in his 
case there is no end to the question ‘Why?’” * 
Some problems are of perpetual interest, as, What is 
the origin of evil? Was Hamlet’s insanity real or feigned? 
Many arise from new wants or newly perceived incongru- 
ences, as, How can live fish be transported long distances 
without water?” How restore the lost inscription upon 
the Parthenon from the nail holes where the letters were 
fastened to the stone?* Again, thoughts which may be 
old and familiar frequently come into new relations, and 
thus give rise to problems. The effort to establish a rela- 
tion of which we have merely heard gives rise to a problem. 
Galileo, for illustration, heard of an invention in Holland 
which made distant objects seem near. At the first

opportunity in Padua he made a telescope from a lead 
organ-pipe and two lenses. Six days later he produced a 
much more perfect instrument in Venice. He knew about 
lenses before, but had never thought of them in such rela- 
tion as to constitute a telescope until he read of the dis- 
covery in Holland. 
1o. Invention may be regarded as a special case of 
problem-solving, the only difference being that the end of 
invention is technical and practical, whereas the problem 
as such is more theoretical. Modern technical advance 
is due largely to the fact that the form of problem-solving 
known as invention is no longer fortuitous, resting upon 
primitive conceptions, but is systematically pursued by 
men having thorough scientific knowledge, and employed 
for the most part by industrial corporations. Similarly, 
social and economic problems are attacked by men of 
resolution and insight, as seen in such cases as the meth- 
ods of philanthropy, the race problem, codperative house- 
keeping, control of corporations, international arbitra- 
tion, intensive farming, etc. 
Discussion: — Compare modern inventions in automo- 
biles with the primitive invention of the wheel; smokeless 
powder with common gunpowder; the small caliber, high 
power rifle with the matchlock. 
11. The problem is well-nigh universal in every field 
of endeavor, educational and vocational, for whenever 
the adjustment of thought to fact or of fact to thought 
   
-P-A-G-E-34
  24 SCIENTIFIC BASIS FOR HIGH-SCHOOL METHODS 
is involved, there the problem lies close at hand. That 
it is of supreme educational importance in the sciences 
cannot be doubted; it is equally serviceable in the human- 
ities whenever the student should be incited to think. 
History easily resolves itself into a series of problems 
respecting cause and effect. Every literary masterpiece 
fairly bristles with problems psychological, social, ethical, 
and linguistic. Even the purely esthetic, whose appre- 
ciation is usually considered to rest upon contemplation 
alone, is greatly aided by intellectual comprehension, which 
always permits the problem form. The difference between 
the esthetic appreciation of the connoisseur and that of 
the rustic is explained by this fact. 
Discussion: — Examples of how subject-matter falls into 
the problem form in science, in history, in literature, in art, 
in ethics, in psychology, in economics, in politics. 
12. Problems are of all degrees of magnitude and of 
importance. Professor Droysen lectures for a semester 
at Halle to solve the problem why Gustavus Adolphus 
of Sweden intervened in the German Thirty Years’ War, 
and finds that he did so primarily from political rather than 
from religious motives. John Fiske raises but does not 
seriously try to solve the problem as to why the Confed- 
erate army was not more vigorously pursued at the close 
of the second day at Shiloh. After making a few surmises, 
he closes by quoting General Sherman’s reply when this
-P-A-G-E-35
  
THE MEANING OF FACTS—-THEIR EXPLANATION 25 
question was asked: “I assure you, my dear fellow, we 
had had quite enough of their society for two whole days, 
and were only too glad to be rid of them on any terms!” 
Students may now be led to solve problems in a day or 
a week that were originally the work of years or of gen- 
erations. Of such nature are the problems of combustion, 
the formation of dew, the vibratory propagation of light, 
the velocity of light, the diffusion of light, the laws of 
electricity, the origin of species, the function of the cell 
in plant and animal life. It will be seen later in detail 
that whenever the nature of a lesson is such as to invite 
or challenge thoughtful investigation, it may fall into the 
problem form. The form of assignment is limited chiefly 
by the amount of time at the command of student and 
teacher. This is a part of the larger question as to which 
method of acquiring knowledge is to be preferred in any 
given case, — transmission by authority or first-hand obser- 
vation. Where the latter method is in place, to ask for 
the determination of cause or effect, of law, principle, or 
classification, is by implication to use the problem form. 
A general problem often gives rise to a number of minor 
problems. Thus in finding out the cause of rust in iron 
filings, a minor problem arises when we try to discover 
whether any of the oxygen active in the rusting process 
comes from the water in which the filings were immersed. 
This question is answered by testing for free hydrogen, 
since we know that the component parts of water are
-P-A-G-E-36
  26 SCIENTIFIC BASIS FOR HIGH-SCHOOL METHODS 
oxygen and hydrogen. In such cases, the minor problems 
are steps in the solution of the major ones. 
Discussion: — Distinguish between major and minor 
problems in each department of learning.’ 
13. Some of the problems of the modern world are a 
standing challenge to the intelligence and enterprise of 
men; others are of a progressive nature wherein each prob- 
lem solved is the last step of a series, and, in turn, sug- 
gests new ends to be reached. To the first class belong 
such problems as these: How convert the force daily 
expended in the tides into useful work? How utilize the 
dynamic power of sunshine to help do the work of the 
world? How overcome diseases hitherto incurable? 
How banish poverty, drunkenness, and crime from the 
world? How make the atmosphere give up enough of its 
nitrogen to fertilize the earth? How develop in a child 
all his latent possibilities for good? We have on every 
side examples of that serial arrangement of problems and 
their solution which leads to development. Beginning 
with the simple curved sickle of the days of Ruth, wehave a 
series of solutions to the problem of rapid and economical 
reaping of grain, as follows: the sickle; the scythe; the 
cradle; the McCormick reaping machine, first with a 
platform for hand raking into bundles, then perfected as

a self-raker; then the Marsh harvester, so arranged that 
two men could ride on the machine and do all the binding; 
and finally the self-binder on the one hand and the header 
with thrashing machine attached on the other. A similar 
progression can be traced in the development of the rail- 
toad. First we have cars drawn by horses and running 
on wooden rails, to be followed soon by trains of old- 
fashioned stage-coaches drawn by a crude steam-engine. 
Some of the important steps of the progress are as follows: 
placing the exhaust pipe in the smoke-stack, thus producing 
a draft proportional to the amount of power exerted; in- 
venting the swiveling truck, enabling the train to run 
safely on a curved track; devising and perfecting the air- 
brake, enabling the engineer to manage successfully very 
heavy trains; converting crude molten iron into steel by 
the Bessemer method, and the corresponding series of in- 
ventions which have culminated in our great rolling mills, 
that rails strong enough to support these mighty locomo- 
tives and their long trains of heavy cars might be made. 
To trace ‘the evolution of all these serial problems would 
constitute in itself no mean education.

2. The Means of Explanation — Hypothesis and Analogy 
14. Authority and observation supplemented by ex- 
periment give us facts. The problem shows us where to 
search for their meaning; while hypothesis and analogy 
guide us in the search. “If the Almighty were in one 
hand to offer me truth, and in the other the search after 
truth, I would humbly but firmly choose the search after 
truth.” * 
“T am convinced that the method of teaching which 
approaches most nearly the methods of investigation is 
incomparably the best; since not content with serving up 
a few barren and lifeless truths, it leads to the stock on 
which they grew; it tends to set the learner himself on 
the track of invention and to direct him into those paths 
in which the author’ has made his own discoveries.”? 
(1) Meaning ahd Use of the Hypothesis 
1s. “When facts are already in our possession we frame 
an hypothesis to explain their mutual relations, and by the 
success or non-success of this explanation is the value of 
the hypothesis to be entirely judged.” * For illustration, 
let the problem be, What causes iron to rust? In order 
to find a clew to the solution, the first hypothesis may be 
this: Since the iron changes, it is probable that its weight 
before and after rusting is different. This surmise may

be tested first by weighing a quantity of unrusted iron 
filings, and then, after keeping the same filings moist for 
a few days, by weighing them again. It is found that the 
weight has increased. The problem now becomes, What 
is the source of the increased weight? A little reflection 
shows that the filings have been exposed both to air and 
to water. A natural hypothesis would be that the increase 
comes either from the air or the water, or perhaps both. 
To see if the air has contributed to the increased weight, 
suspend a bag of bright filings in a pot of water and in- 
vert a glass jar over the bag. It is found that the water 
gradually rises in the jar until it fills one-fifth of the space 
formerly occupied by the air. This shows that the air 
has much to do with the rusting, for it has evidently given 
up one-fifth of its volume whi’, the filings were rusting. 
Further tests will show that it is oxygen that has been 
given up by the air, since what is left in the jar will not sup- 
port combustion. Then comes the query, Did the water 
also contribute oxygen? This may be answered by testing 
the contents of the inverted jar for hydrogen, for it is known 
that water is composed of the two gases, oxygen and hydro- 
gen, so that if the water has given up to the filings any 
portion of its oxygen, there must be left a corresponding 
portion of hydrogen gas, which being even lighter than 
air will, of course, rise to the top of the inverted jar. 
New problems concerning combustion, and the consti- 
tution of air and water, naturally arise from this investiga-
-P-A-G-E-40
  30 SCIENTIFIC BASIS FOR HIGH-SCHOOL METHODS 
tion of the cause of rusting, when, of course, new hypothe- 
ses are needed. Just what these problems and hypothe- 
ses shall be, will depend upon the state of the student’s 
knowledge of chemistry. What is a known fact or law 
to one may be a problem to another. 
16. The hypothesis in the scientific sense is merely a 
tentative assumption, still to be proved, that contributes 
to an easier understanding of the facts. It need not be 
true in order to be useful. The essential thing is that it 
should be put to the test, for in this way its adequacy or 
inadequacy will be revealed. Even if the hypothesis 
should turn out to be entirely erroneous, the test is likely 
to suggest a better one. In the words of Priestley: 
“Very lame and imperfect theories are sufficient to suggest 
useful experiments, which serve to correct these theories, 
and give birth to others more perfect. These, then, 
occasion further experiments, which bring us still nearer 
to the truth.” ? 
In reality, the hypothesis as above considered is noth- 
ing but a refinement of our instinctive reaching forward to 
1 This it will be seen is the reverse of the geometrical use of the term 
hypothesis as the sum of conditions under which a proposition holds 
and can be demonstrated. Here the hypothesis is that which is given to 
which no other condition except mathematical and logical possibility is 
attached. We proceed from the geometrical hypothesis to the proof of 
the proposition. Other sciences reverse this process, beginning with the 
given facts to prove the hypothesis true or false.

surmise the causes or effects of uncomprehended phe- 
nomena that attract our attention. Columbus sees in the 
‘floating débris of the ocean signs of land, and at once sur- 
mises that they are evidences of the land he is seeking. 
Primitive men explain lightning, thunder, hurricanes, and 
earthquakes as the work of titans or demons. For nearly 
fourteen centuries civilized men explained the apparent 
movements of the heavens as the result of different celes- 
tial spheres revolving at different rates about the earth, and 
thus developed the Ptolemaic astronomical hypothesis, 
which was finally displaced by that of Copernicus. Need- 
less to say the hypothesis of Copernicus has long been a 
demonstrated truth. Mach? relates that when the skele- 
tons of mammoths were unearthed in Siberia, the natives 
explained them as being the remains of gigantic rats, 
which burrowed in the earth, but died as soon as they 
reached the air. This instinctive attempt to explain 
things by means of hypothesis is akin to the ‘anticipa- 
tions of perceptions’ already explained.? When Francis 
Parkman asked an old Indian, named Red Water, the 
cause of thunder, he said: “It was great blackbird; and 
once he had seen it in a dream swooping down from the 
Black Hills, with its loud roaring wings; and when it 
flapped them over a lake, they struck lightning from 
the water.” °

Discussion: — 1. Primitive hypotheses regarding heavenly 
bodies and striking natural events (eclipses, storms, earth- 
quakes, seasons, etc.). See sun and other nature myths. 
2. Examples of instinctive hypothesis to explain uncompre- 
hended events in daily life (sickness, accidents, misfortunes, 
conduct of others, etc.). 
(2) First Requisite for a Good Hypothesis 
17. An hypothesis to be good should offer the possibility 
for deductive reasoning. In other words, we should be 
able to learn what ought to happen according to such 
an hypothesis. To assume that thunder, lightning, 
hurricanes, earthquakes, and eclipses are caused by 
demons, would not be a good hypothesis, because nobody 
can possibly predict with any certainty what capricious 
power will do, or in any way test it by experiment. An 
hypothesis may have great and even apparently insur- 
mountable difficulties attached to it, and yet be legitimate 
and useful, because of the help it gives in understanding 
phenomena, and because in important respects it is veri- 
fiable by experiment, as in the undulatory theory of light. 
The actual wave length of the undulations can be measured. 
Even the emanation theory of light did good service, 
since it helped to explain many phenomena, and especially 
because it did not involve the assumption of ether to bear 
the undulations, say from the sun to the earth. The only 
treason it is now displaced is that the undulatory theory 
explains more known facts, and because it bears the test of
-P-A-G-E-43
  THE MEANING OF FACTS— THEIR EXPLANATION 33 
certain crucial experiments, which the emanation theory 
does not.’ Descartes’s theory that the heavenly bodies 
are whirled about in vortices does not present any mode of 
calculating the exact relations between the distances and 
periods of the planets and satellites, hence fails to satisfy 
this first requisite of a good hypothesis. It is not a good 
answer to the objection that a given hypothesis can never 
be proved, to say that neither can it be disproved. The 
hypothesis that nature abhors a vacuum does not show 
why water will not rise more than 33 feet in a com- 
mon pump. The old phlogiston theory of combustion 
violated the first requisite, since it furnished no compre- 
hensible basis for explanation. It was, however, shown 
to be absurd. The known cannot be successfully 
explained by means of the unknown,

inadequate hypothesis led early chemists to put a cross upon 
their retorts? 2. Origin of moon and other superstitions. 
(3) Second Requisite for a Good Hypothesis 
18. An hypothesis should be consistent with the estab- 
lished laws of nature. No hypothesis can be considered 
good which contradicts the established laws of motion, of 
gravity, of the conservation of energy, or even of well- 
known human nature. The attempt so often made by 
boys and unscientific men to invent machines that involve 
1See William Stanley Jevons, “Principles of Science,” p. 511. 
D 
 
-P-A-G-E-44
  34 SCIENTIFIC BASIS FOR HIGH-SCHOOL METHODS 
the idea of perpetual motion, that is, machines that con- 
tinue to do work without renewing energy, is a case in 
point. A fruitful source of hypothesis lacking in this 
second requisite is to assume that the known laws of 
one department of knowledge, say biology, hold with un- 
diminished validity in another, say human society. Thus, 
a writer may construct his entire system on the hypothe- 
sis that laws which hold in the animal world hold also 
with the same rigidity in the human world. The so-called 
Malthusian law that population always tends to press 
against the means of subsistence is an illustration. So much 
more rapidly than population are the means of subsistence 
now increasing, that the Malthusian law, once the terror 
of the moralist, has gone into a state of suspended ani- 
mation. When John Locke speaks of stones as growing, 
he assumes that a law of life applies in geology.

pothesis. 2. The theory that nations necessarily rise, decline, 
and perish. 
(4) The Third Requisite for a Good Hy pothesis 
tg. An hypothesis should be in conformity with facts. 
This is its final test. Descartes’s theory of vortices was 
shown to be inadequate, because the rotary motions of

sun and planets on their own axes are in striking conflict 
with the revolution of the satellites carried around them, 
and because comets pursue their courses irrespective of 
the vortices which are supposed to be whirling much more 
solid bodies in their grasp. The present age is notable 
not only for its willingness to test all hypotheses upon the 
touchstone of fact, but for its determination to do so. 
For illustration, the assumption that bees communicate 
with one another by means of antenne might once have 
been accepted or denied without actual test to see whether 
it accords with fact or not. Huber, however, divided a 
hive into two chambers by means of a partition. Great 
excitement at once ensued in that portion of the hive 
where there was no queen, and the bees immediately set to 
work to build royal cells for the creation of a new queen. 
Huber then divided a hive in exactly the same manner, 
with the difference only that the dividing screen, or parti- 
tion, was made of trellis work, through the openings of 
which the bees on either side could pass their antenne. 
Under these circumstances the bees in the queenless half 
of the hive exhibited no disturbance, nor did they construct 
any royal cells, for the bees in the other half of the hive were 
able to inform them that the queen was safe.’ This test 
of fact is reliable as far as it goes, but further tests are 
necessary to make the evidence conclusive, for the inter- 
stices in the partition would permit of the passage of sound 
1 Compare George John Romaines, “Mental Evolution in Man,” p. go.
-P-A-G-E-46
36 SCIENTIFIC BASIS FOR HIGH-SCHOOL METHODS 
as well as of antenne, whereas the solid partition would 
exclude both. The rival hypothesis that bees communi- 
cate by notes or tones may turn out to be in accordance 
with the real facts. Only further tests could determine 
which hypothesis agrees with them. It is conceivable that 
bees can communicate by both methods. This would 
become a new hypothesis, to be tested in turn as to its 
correctness. 
Simple hypotheses concerning single things or small 
groups of phenomena are much more easily tested than 
those which involve a large number of facts. The law 
for the diffusion of light when it was in the hypothetical 
state could easily be tested, but such vast systems of re- 
lations as are involved in the nebular hypothesis, or the doc- 
trine of evolution, permit of but partial verification at any 
one time. The cumulative labors of generations of schol- 
ars are often inadequate to their complete demonstration. 
Hypotheses suitable for students in testing as to fact are 
naturally of the simpler sort. 
Discussion :— Difference between unexplained difficulties 
in an hypothesis and the failure to stand the test of fact. Com- 
pare the undulatory and the corpuscular, or emanation, theory

  THE MEANING OF FACTS—-THEIR EXPLANATION 37 
(5) The Experimentum Crucis 
20. It not infrequently happens that each of two hy- 
potheses explains so many facts that both find many 
advocates. This has often been the case in the history of 
science. An experiment that decides between two rival 
hypotheses is called an experimentum crucis (experiment 
of the finger-post). 
As Jevons* says, the long-continued strife between the 
corpuscular and the undulatory theories of light furnishes 
the most beautiful examples of the experimentum crucis. 
Both theories furnish satisfactory explanations of many 
phenomena of light, such as reflection and refraction. If, 
however, the undulatory theory be correct, light must 
move more slowly in a dense than in a rare medium, 
whereas, on the other hand, if the corpuscular theory were 
true, the reverse would be the case, for the denser medium 
would have an attractive power which, exerted at infin- 
itesimal distances, would accelerate the speed of the light 
particles. Here was a chance for a single experiment to 
disprove one hypothesis while proving the other. Fou- 
cault compared directly the speeds of two beams of light, 
one passing through air only, the other through several 
meters of water as a part of its path, and found that light 
passes more slowly through water than through air.’

  38 SCIENTIFIC BASIS FOR HIGH-SCHOOL METHODS 
A modern instance is seen in the series of Havana ex- 
periments to decide which is correct, the theory that yel- 
low fever is caused by infection or contagion, or the more 
modern rival hypothesis that it is due to inoculation 
by the mosquito. These experiments have two aspects: 
first, to prove that the disease can be transmitted by inocu- 
lation; and second, that it cannot be communicated by 
contagion. Though it is possible and perfectly justifiable 
to regard these experiments as isolated and each, therefore, 
like any test to prove or disprove a theory, yet in reality 
they constitute a unit, being conceived by the same men 
and carried out at the same time. For this reason it is 
perhaps fair to consider them as forming in their totality 
an experimentum crucis. To control conditions for the 
first part of the experiment, mosquito-proof tents were 
constructed in a dry and isolated location. Volunteers, 
including members of the medical staff, then lived in these 
tents and submitted themselves to the bites of mosquitoes 
known to have bitten yellow fever patients, and hence to 
be in a condition to transmit the disease, should it turn 
out that they were able to do so. The experiments were 
inconclusive, as earlier ones had been, when the period of 
incubation of the assumed disease germs was less than 
ten days. One of the physicians had been bitten on the 
hand by a mosquito that had had an incubating period 
of six days, but no result followed. A little later, however, 
Dr. Lazear permitted a mosquito to bite him that had had
-P-A-G-E-49
  
THE MEANING OF FACTS— THEIR EXPLANATION 39 
an incubating period of twelve days. The disease was then 
contracted, and Dr. Lazear lost his life. Acting on the 
knowledge thus expensively obtained, many others were 
bitten by mosquitoes that had been infected twelve days 
or more, with the result that nearly all the non-immune 
experimenters contracted the disease. Two facts were 
thus established: first, that yellow fever can be trans- 
mitted by inoculation; and second, that a period of incu- 
bation of about two weeks must elapse before the insect 
is capable of communicating it to a human being. 
It now remained to test the old hypothesis that yellow 
fever can be communicated by contagion, or what is called 
infection. A mosquito-proof cabin was constructed, 
and three Americans submitted themselves to the experi- 
ments. This time instead of utilizing the mosquito, he 
was rigorously excluded, and the contaminated clothing 
and bedding of yellow fever patients were brought into the 
cabin and handled by the young men. They packed and 
unpacked it daily, slept in the cabin at night, and even 
wore the unwashed linen of persons who had recently 
died of the disease. This was kept up for three weeks, 
yet not one of the experimenters suffered from the sup- 
posedly deadly contagion. In this manner, disagreeable 
yet heroic, the old fear of contagion was dissipated, and 
the world at last learned the truth as to how this dread 
disease is spread from person to person. The American 
health authorities at Havana at once made war on the
-P-A-G-E-50
  40 SCIENTIFIC BASIS FOR HIGH-SCHOOL METHODS 
mosquito, to such good effect that for the next two years 
not a single case of yellow fever appeared in this old city, 
which for four hundred years had rarely been free 
from it. 
As was previously intimated, the mosquito has for a 
period of two thousand years been suspected to be a bearer 
of disease, yet not until our own day has this suspicion 
been changed to certainty. Men are now able to combat 
intelligently the malarial and other fevers that are trans- 
mitted by the mosquito, as at Panama, in tropical Africa, 
on the Roman Campagna, in subtropical regions, and 
throughout the temperate regions of the earth. One rea- 
son why this discovery was so long delayed is because there 
are one hundred and twenty different kinds of mosquito, 
very few of which can act as a host for the incubation 
of disease germs. It is the Culex stegomyia that trans- 
mits yellow fever, and the anopheles malaria. Another 
sufficient cause of the delay is the fact that bacteriological 
knowledge is of very recent origin. 
The future of every science, like its past, bristles with 
problems in which rival hypotheses are possible. In many 
cases it will happen, as it has happened, that a single 
experiment or series of experiments will decide which 
hypothesis is correct. 
Discussion: — Force of the objection that the free use of 
the hypothesis incites to guessing and loose thinking.

(6) Analogy as a Guide to Discovery 
21. Many a discovery is made by following up hints 
furnished by analogy. This was true in astronomy when 
Galileo discovered that Jupiter has four small satellites 
revolving around it, thus forming a small planetary world. 
This fact enabled men by analogy the more easily to accept 
the Copernican theory of the larger solar system. The 
undulatory movement of water in waves hints at undula- 
tions of air as the cause of sound, while sound-waves in 
turn suggest light-waves. Biological analogy has been es- 
pecially fruitful in suggesting theories of state and society.’ 
Text-book writers in physics still use Clerk-Maxwell’s 
analogy between the behavior of water and that of elec- 
tricity. For example, potential in the latter corresponds 
to the head of water as it flows from a higher to a lower 
level; a current of electricity corresponds to the flow 
through a pipe at the lower level; resistance in the elec- 
tricity corresponds to friction which the pipe causes to 
a stream of water flowing through it, etc. Descartes showed 
that every equation may be represented by some curve 
or figure in space, and that every bend, point, cusp, or 
other peculiarity in the curve indicates some peculiarity 
in the values of the algebraic symbols. “It is impossible

to describe in any adequate manner the importance 
of this discovery. The advantage was twofold: algebra 
aided geometry, and geometry gave reciprocal aid to 
algebra.” ? i

alogy: Is the state an organism?? Is electricity a fluid?

that are found active in one pupil indicate with certainty that 
the same motives will be equally powerful with another?

  CHAPTER III 
FORMS OF SOLUTION FOR THE PROBLEM 
22. Since problems of thought may arise in any depart- 
ment of human interest, there is naturally a diversity pos- 
sible in the forms of their solution. Wherever facts call 
for explanation, there the problem arises, but the form of 
explanation most effective depends upon the nature of 
the problem. Of the various forms which solutions may 
take, three are of especial importance in education. They 
are: (1) the determination of the causal connections of 
phenomena, especially of events; (2) the classification of 
objects, whether as a process or a result already attained; 
and (3) generalization proper, as in the derivation of rule, 
principle, or law. The significance and necessity of these 
forms will become apparent in subsequent sections. 
1. The Determination of Causes: Method of Agreement 
or Difference 
23. It often happens that explanation is ample when a 
thing or an event is brought under a general law already 
understood. This would be the case when the rusting of 
iron is shown to be a special example of combustion; or 
when the falling of dew is explained by the laws of humidity, 
43 
 
-P-A-G-E-54
  44 SCIENTIFIC BASIS FOR HIGH-SCHOOL METHODS 
conductivity, and radiation. In like manner, we explain 
the action of the common pump, the force-pump, the hy- 
draulic ram, the turbine, the steam or gas engine, etc. 
This form of solution holds not only in the organic world, 
but it is of special importance in history, which resists 
more or less stubbornly all attempts to establish general 
laws, such as those proposed by Buckle in his “History 
of Civilization.”” But we may always ask the cause of an 
event or a series of events in human affairs, or we may 
trace natural events back to known causes. Thus Turner * 
shows how the needs and demands of our frontier shaped 
our national legislation respecting the tariff, internal im- 
provements, and the disposition of the public domain, and 
how it fixed the character of our democracy. Patten? 
shows how such factors as “Complementary Goods,” 
“The Imputation of Utility,’ “The Mechanism of the 
Standard of Life,” and “The Relative Size of the Comple- 
mentary Groups of Pleasure and Pain” help to contribute 
to our moral progress. John Fiske * points out that the 
chief reason why George the Third so strenuously insisted 
upon taxation without representation in the American 
colonies was that he was trying to perpetuate the same

policy at home, in order that he might control legislation 
in England through control of ‘rotten boroughs’ and 
the exclusion from Parliament of representatives from 
the rising industrial cities, like Birmingham and Man- 
chester. 
The whole of history, both in and out of school, falls 
naturally and hence easily into the problem form, in which 
causes are sought as adequate explanation. For example, 
why should the reflex influences of the frontier upon the 
original colonies be greater than the opposing European 
influences? Why did French dominion in America spread 
so rapidly and the English so slowly? What enabled 
trappers of both nations to penetrate the hostile interior 
with impunity? What were the causes and effects of 
primitive cooking, manufacture of clothing, heating and 
lighting, of implements of agriculture, hunting, and war- 
fare, of means of transportation ? 
24. The problems of the social and political world call 
for solutions in the form of cause or effect. To illustrate: 
How can we avoid the economic waste in cities that arises 
from the primitive device of having an independent cook- 
ing outfit for each family? How prevent corruption in 
corporations and public administrative systems? How 
effect reformation through the punishment of offenders? 
How make it possible for an ex-convict to live an honest 
and self-respecting life? What means should manufac- 
turing establishments use to secure the interested codpera-
-P-A-G-E-56
46 SCIENTIFIC BASIS FOR HIGH-SCHOOL METHODS 
tion of their employees? Should men and women teachers 
have the same salary when they fill equivalent positions? 
To solve these problems is to investigate social and 
political causes and effects, and to draw conclusions 
accordingly. 
25. A matter of great importance in all scientific method 
is the presentation of simple rules of evidence to be used in 
the discovery of causes or effects. A farmer with a primi- 
tive mind may say that unless potatoes be planted during 
a given phase of the moon, they will not thrive. When 
asked for his reasons, he will perhaps cite instances which 
belong to the category of coincidence rather than to that 
of cause. He knows, or at least applies, no accepted rules 
of evidence, and is consequently an easy victim of super- 
stition. On the other hand, it is only by the application 
of well-known criteria of cause and effect that men are 
able to detect, say the cause of disease. Thus, for example, 
the English soldiers at Malta, an island in the Mediterra- 
nean, had long been sadly afflicted with a severe type of 
malarial fever. A commission of physicians was sent to 
discover the cause. In casting about for a clew to an expla- | 
nation of the disease, the doctors learned that the only milk 7 
used by the soldiers came from goats. Acting upon this 
hint, it was found that a mosquito transmitted the disease 
germ of the fever to the goats of the island, which served 
as hosts for its incubation. When the recommendation 
of the commission that canned cow’s milk be substituted
-P-A-G-E-57
  
FORMS OF SOLUTION FOR THE PROBLEM 47 
for the goat’s milk heretofore used was followed, the dis- 
ease entirely disappeared. A primitive man would per- 
haps have tried by incantations to exorcise the demons 
that were afflicting the men, or he would have ascribed 
the disease to the inscrutable will of some overruling 
power, whose wrath it were impossible to appease. 
These scientific rules of evidence, rigidly applied, have 
been an important cause of the modern advance in knowl- 
edge, not only in pure science, human and natural, but also 
in their practical application. It has become almost an 
instinct with investigators in every field of research to 
accept no evidence that does not stand the test of these 
simple principles. 
26. Ina final analysis all the rules of evidence, and J. S. 
Mill gives an exposition of five, rest upon agreement or dif- 
ference among the phenomena. Thus, if two things agree 
in only one circumstance, being different in every other 
respect, it is evident that the characteristic in which they 
agree must be the cause or effect of the phenomenon in 
question. Or, again, if two phenomena differ by only one 
circumstance, agreeing in all others, it is equally evident 
that the element of difference must be the cause or effect 
of the phenomenon in question. The three remaining 
modes of proof are only combinations of the two just 
mentioned. The five methods elaborated by Mill’ will 
now be taken up in detail for definition and illustration. 
4 “Logic,” Book III, Ch. VIII. 
 
-P-A-G-E-58
  48 SCIENTIFIC BASIS FOR HIGH-SCHOOL METHODS 
(1) The Method of Agreement 
27. When two or more instances of a phenomenon 
have only one circumstance in common, differing in all 
other particulars, the circumstance in which they agree is 
the cause of the phenomenon in question. 
The Havana experiments as to the cause of transmission 
in yellow fever described above illustrate the method of 
agreement. The two groups concerned were the victims 
of the disease in the city at large, on the one hand, and the 
future possible patients under the control of the experi- 
menters on the other. It will be remembered that there 
were two hypotheses concerning the way in which the 
disease is transmitted, namely, by contagion or infection 
through the air, and by inoculation by mosquitoes. (See 
p. 38.) If now the two groups can be so situated that 
only one possible cause of transmission is common to 
both, the groups differing in all other essential particu- 
lars, it is certain that the true cause will be revealed, should 
the new group develop the fever under these conditions. 
Since the belief of the experimenters was that the disease 
is occasioned by inoculation, they first isolated them- 
selves from all possible contagion or infection by select- 
ing a high and dry location sufficiently remote from the 
city, and rigorously quarantining themselves. They next 
made mosquito-proof tents in which to live, that they might 
suffer no general danger from this source such as the town 
 
-P-A-G-E-59
ae aa lOO CO OC CTL Te hL!hCUCUCUCU:C:C:C:C:::LLLLLLLee 
FORMS OF SOLUTION FOR THE PROBLEM 49 
patients were exposed to. They then suffered themselves 
to be bitten by mosquitces taken from the sick rooms of 
yellow fever patients in the city, and which were known to 
be contaminated. It will be seen that this circumstance 
of being bitten by contaminated mosquitoes was the only 
common probable cause of the disease, the two groups being 
different as respects exposure to other causes, and when a 
large per cent. of the experimenters so bitten contracted the 
fever, it was certain that inoculation is one cause of trans- 
mission, and perhaps the only cause. To make the latter 
point more certain, the other series of experiments was 
arranged to prove that it is not transmitted by contagion. 
As before, all possible causes of the disease except the one 
hypothetical cause of contagion were excluded, so that the 
two groups again differed in all essential conditions except 
this one. The three young Americans who submitted 
themselves to this experiment were isolated in a mosquito- 
proof cabin so constructed that sunlight and fresh air were 
largely excluded. They then handled freely the contami- 
nated clothing and other effects of the town patients, 
even sleeping in the soiled linen of those who had died. 
When, at the end of twenty-one days, all three remained in 
perfect health, it was held that the disease is not trans- 
mitted by contagion, and that the former expensive custom 
of fumigating or burning all effects coming from an in- 
fected district is quite unnecessary. 
Discussion: — 1. Cause of typhoid fever in half a dozen

given cases in which it is found that they all agree in one 
circumstance that might bea cause. 2. The use of this method 
in showing the conversion of solids into liquids and of liquids 
into gases by means of heat; in showing the injurious effect 
of northeast winds (think of temperature, violence, moisture, 
electricity, ozone as differing, but in all cases bear in mind the 
close contact of the air with the ground for long distances).! 
(2) The Method of Difference 
28. Where two instances differ in only one circumstance, 
agreeing in all others, the circumstance in which they differ 
is the cause (or effect) sought. 
The Malta investigation (see p. 46) illustrates the use 
of the method of difference. The two groups in this case 
are the English soldiers at Malta who suffered from a 
particular malarial fever, and English soldiers in India, 
Egypt, and other semi-tropical regions who do not. Is 
there any one circumstance that might be a cause wherein 
the Malta group differs from the others? Evidently they 
agree in most particulars, coming from the same country, 
living in the same kind of climate, under the same disci- 
pline, and eating the same rations. If such a differing cir- 
cumstance having any relation to the possible cause can 
be found, it should be investigated. Searching for a clew 
of this kind, the physicians learned that the Malta soldiers 
used goat’s milk, whereas the others (presumably) did 
1See Alexander Bain, “Logic-Induction,” p. 53.
-P-A-G-E-61
FORMS OF SOLUTION FOR THE PROBLEM si 
not. Investigation of this milk revealed malarial germs, 
which were then traced back to the mosquito. The cor- 
rectness of this conclusion from the element of difference 
is confirmed by the fact that when canned cow’s milk was 
substituted, the disease disappeared. 
Discusston:—1. Amount of rain that falls at the surface 
of the earth and at a considerable elevation (the element of 
difference being the effect of wind). 2. Probable cause of dif- 
ference in prosperity of farmers living under the same conditions. 
3- Why is one day at school more trying than another to the

produce immediate effects; remote ones. 6. Need of knowing 
beforehand the general adequacy of the cause assigned. 
(3) The Joint Method of Agreement and Difference 
29. “A number of instances having been examined, 
whatever is invariably present when the phenomenon 
under investigation is present, and invariably absent when 
the latter is absent, is causally connected with that phe- 
nomenon.” * 
This, it may be seen, is a combination of the two methods 
described above, for in the first part we have agreement, 
and in the second difference. Suppose the problem to 
be to find the cause of a case of indigestion. We may 
examine a series of instances in which cereals with and 
1 J. E. Creighton, “Introductory Logic,” p. 209.
-P-A-G-E-62
    52 SCIENTIFIC BASIS FOR HIGH-SCHOOL METHODS 
without cellulose are eaten at different periods; when 
coffee or any other beverage is used alternately and dis. 
continued; or when the diet is chiefly vegetable, then chiefly 
meat, etc. If, for example, the symptoms of indigestion 
invariably accompany the free use of coffee and as inva- 
tiably subside upon its discontinuance, we may be sure 
that coffee is causally connected with the indisposition. 
In similar manner, one may investigate causes of disorder 
at school, the interest and success or failure of students in 
their work, etc. 
(4) The Method of Concomitant Variations 
30. Mill says, “Whenever in two instances any particu- 
lar phenomenon varies in any manner, whenever another 
phenomenon varies in a particular manner, the first vary- 
ing phenomenon is either a cause or an effect of the second, 
_ or is connected with it through some fact of causation.” 
Suppose, for illustration, heat is the first varying phenome- 
non and friction the second. If now the friction increases 
and it is found that the temperature of the body rubbed 
increases correspondingly, we may be sure that friction 
is a cause of heat. Concomitant variations are therefore 
evidences of cause and effect. Any increase or decrease 
in the cause is marked by a corresponding variation in the 
effect. Whenever, therefore, the variations run parallel 
to the changes in the cause, thus making the changing 
effects keep pace with the changing causes, we may be
-P-A-G-E-63
  
ihe OE SOS yt te 
FORMS OF SOLUTION FOR THE PROBLEM 53 
sure that we have discovered the cause or effect of the 
phenomenon in question. Thus in testing the toxic effect 
of vanillin upon plant growth, the experimenters of the 
Bureau of Agriculture caused a set of seeds to germinate 
under conditions that were exactly alike, except that the 
amount of vanillin applied varied, say as 1, 20, 40, 100, 500. 
Photographs showing the growth of tops and roots at the 
end of a given period revealed the fact that for each increase 
of vanillin there was a corresponding decrease in the 
amount of growth, hence a concomitant variation between 
the toxic cause, vanillin, and the growth effect. The 
inevitable conclusion is that in this case vanillin is a poison 
to vegetable growth. 
The experiment of carrying a barometer to the top of 
a mountain is a proof by variation of the connection be- 
tween the pressure of the air and the rise of the mercury. 
Discussion: — Test by the method of concomitant varia- 
tions the influence of increasing or decreasing heat upon evap- 
oration, plant growth, expansion of metals; of increasing 
income upon the number and quality of schools (see statistics), 
marriage, birth-rate, etc. 
(5) The Method of Residues 
31. Mill defines this method as follows: “Subduct from 
any phenomenon such part as is known by previous in- 
ductions to be the effect of certain antecedents, and the 
residue of the phenomenon is the effect of the remaining 
antecedents.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-64
  54 SCIENTIFIC BASIS FOR HIGH-SCHOOL METHODS 
When many general causes of phenomena become well 
known, the solution of new problems is greatly simplified 
by subducting the influence of causes that are known to 
be active in the given case. The most brilliant example 
of the application of this method in astronomy was the 
clew to the discovery of Neptune furnished by certain 
anomalies then unaccounted for in the motion of Uranus. 
Adams and Le Verrier by mathematical calculation located 
in space the probable cause of the irregularity by deducting 
the effects of known causes, and invited the astronomers to 
direct their telescopes to this spot in the heavens. They 
did so, and the new planet Neptune became a recognized 
member of the solar family. The observation of Arago, 
that a magnetic needle, set to vibrating, is sooner brought 
to rest when suspended over a copper plate, was the first 
clew to the discovery of magneto-electricity.* Similarly, 
the observation of Cavendish that when the known con- 
stituents of the air were deducted, there was left a small 
residuum unaccounted for, which in 1895 was proved to 
be a new element by Lord Rayleigh and William Ramsay. 
They named it argon (lazy), from its inert character. 
The method of residues is available in accounting for 
unforeseen effects of legislation or of new inventions. In 
this way we may account for the influence of the sewing- 
machine and the bicycle upon woman’s clothing, of the 
electric illumination of streets at night upon crime, of the 
1See Bain, “Logic-Induction,” p. 66.
-P-A-G-E-65
  FORMS OF SOLUTION FOR THE PROBLEM 55 
invention of the cotton-gin upon slavery north and south, 
etc. As Bain remarks, “The only proof of an exhaustive 
analysis, whether in material actions or in mental pro- 
cesses, is there being nothing left.” This being the case, 
we may investigate such disputed points as the existence 
or non-existence of innate ideas, the moral sense, the free- 
dom of the will, etc., by deducting the known constituent 
causes of mental life. If these completely account for the 
phenomenon in question, then, since there is nothing left, 
the problem is solved. Or, if there is something still 
unaccounted for, a different solution is indicated. 
Discussion: — Apply the method of residues to explain 
why the south shore of Lake Erie has become the richest 
stretch of coast of like length in the world. 
2. Classification 
32. In a last analysis nearly all thinking involves 
classification, for when we affirm one thing or another, 
we put them by implication in the same class. Every 
common noun to be found in the dictionary is the name 
of a class, and in the class we find the meaning of con- 
cept, or general notion. Usage, however, limits the term 
classification to certain cases. Thus we speak of the con- 
cept ériangle, but of the class mammalia; yet the reverse 
of this custom is logically justifiable. Bain uses the 
term sciences of classification for botany, zodlogy, and 
mineralogy. To these we may add a considerable part of 
 
-P-A-G-E-66
  86 SCIENTIFIC BASIS FOR HIGH-SCHOOL METHODS 
grammar. In the words of Huxley, “By the classification 
of any series of objects is meant the actual or ideal arrange- 
ment together of those which are like and the separation 
of those which are unlike; the purpose of this arrange- 
ment being to facilitate the operations of the mind in 
clearly conceiving and retaining in the memory the char- 
acters of the objects in question.” By means of classifica- 
tion we condense and systematize our knowledge, thus 
making it manageable, and enabling us to forecast resem- 
blances in objects not yet examined, and even to discover 
laws of nature. 
33- The possible modes of classification are practically 
unlimited in extent, since classes may be formed upon any 
basis that chances to be convenient. For illustration, 
crystals may be classified according to their composition 
or their form; plants may be and have been classified on 
the basis of their fruits, their leaves, or the corolla or the 
calyx of their flowers; men are classified as to race, color, 
occupation, economic station, politics, religion, disposition, 
nationality, etc.; animals may be classified according to 
form, function, manner of getting food, manner of repro- 
duction, color, feet, legs, horns, skins, etc. 
Discussion: — Practical exercises in the classification 
of leaves; of pictures.* 
34. Scientific classification rejects accidental or unim-

  FORMS OF SOLUTION FOR THE PROBLEM 57 
portant characteristics as a basis, and seeks out those that 
are most important, and in the case of living beings those 
which best represent the conditions for survival for the 
object. The classification ruminant is a more scientific 
one than that of pachyderm, since the manner of prepar- 
ing the food for digestion is a more important requisite 
for the survival of the animal than the thickness of the 
skin. What Bain calls the Golden Rule of classification 
is stated as follows: Of the various groupings of resem- 
bling things, preference is given to such as have in common 
the most numerous and the most important attributes. The 
whale is to be classed with mammals rather than with 
fish, because the manner of bringing forth the young is 
more important than the fact that it lives in the water 
like a fish. Yet we may speak of the whale fishery, since 
the purpose of classification is now practical convenience, 
rather than scientific accuracy. 
35. A pedagogical device of much importance is the 
use of the type as the basis of classification. So intricate 
is the classification of living objects that biologists often 
select for their students a representative or typical plant 
or animal, and make a detailed study of its characteristics. 
They then refer all similar objects to the type, calling 
attention at the same time to important variations. This 
method, though subject to grave logical objections as a 
scientific method for classification, has great advantages 
for teaching, since it enables the student to get a working 
   
-P-A-G-E-68
  58 SCIENTIFIC BASIS FOR HIGH-SCHOOL METHODS 
idea of large classes of plants or animals by careful study 
of a few types. 
Discussion: — Comparative value of text-books of this 
kind, especially for dissection purposes. See Colton’s ‘‘Prac- 
tical Zodlogy,” in which such types as the grasshopper, the 
cricket, the beetle, the crayfish, the earthworm, the fish, the 
turtle, the rabbit, etc., are studied in detail. See also Boyer’s 
“Elementary Biology,” in which on the plant side such types 
as the following are taken up in detail: green slime and the 
yeast-plant, brook silk, green felt, stonewort, liverwort, com- 
mon fern, Scotch pine, trillium, seeds and seedlings. Need- 
ham’s “Elementary Zoology” selects the following types among 
the vertebrates: the catfish, the frog, the turtle, the snake, 
the English sparrow, the rabbit. 
36. It is not the purpose of the present exposition to 
explain the manifold rules and intricacies of classification, 
yet it may be well for the future teacher to realize that they 
exist, and may be studied in such works as Mill’s “Logic,” 
Bain’s “Logic-Induction,” Jevon’s “Principles of Sci- 
ence,” and in many similar treatises. A quotation from 
Colton’s “Zoology, Descriptive and Practical” will illus- 
trate the perplexities of the investigator when he is on the 
borderland that divides the classes, “It might, at first 
thought, seem strange that so simple an animal as the lance- 
let should be classed with a group having such. complex 
structure as the vertebrates. The lancelet has, in fact, 
been placed with the mollusks, and later with the fishes, 
but is now located at the foot of the vertebrate series,
-P-A-G-E-69
FORMS OF SOLUTION FOR THE PROBLEM 59 
chiefly on account of the possession of the notochord and 
the dorsal nervous system. It is really hard to locate 
an animal with colorless blood, and with neither skull, 
brain, heart, auditory organs, paired eyes, nor paired fins. 
“The student who gets his ideas of classification almost 
entirely from reading is apt to think that the animal king- 
dom is divided into groups separated by clear and distinct 
dividing lines. But when he undertakes the actual exami- 
nation of any considerable series of animals, he often finds 
that two groups which he regarded as distinct actually 
merge one into the other so gradually that he finds it 
difficult to see just where the line of division should be 
drawn. The line of demarcation must frequently be so 
drawn that it cuts across some intermediate forms, part 
of whose characteristics lie on one side and part on the 
other. In some cases the intermediate forms are living; 
in other cases the ‘connecting links’ are represented only 
by fossil forms, as, for example, the extinct animals that 
connect the reptiles and the birds. 
“The lancelets are plainly on the threshold of the ver- 
tebrate household. By some authorities they are denied 
admittance, and must wait just outside. Others allow 
them barely to cross the threshold and humbly take their 
place by the door, the lowest of the great branch at whose 
head stands man. 
“On account of the poorly developed brain and the 
absence of a cranium, the lancelet is placed by itself in a 
 
-P-A-G-E-70

division called Acrania, while all the other vertebrates are 
designated as Craniaia, from the presence of a skull and 
the higher development of the brain.” ! 
Discuss1on:—1. Place and importance of classification in 
the various high-school studies. 2. Utilization of the collect- 
ing instinct among children. 
3. Generalization 
(1) Non-Mathematical Generalizations 
37. Thus far two essential forms of explanation, or the 
solution of problems, have been discussed, namely, ex- 
planation by the assignment of adequate cause and that 
form of condensation known as classification. Planetary 
motion is explained when the two causes, gravity and tan- 
gential velocity, are pointed out. The propulsion of a bul- 
let following the pulling of a trigger is explained when the 
series of intermediate causes, concussion, heat, ignition of 
powder, generation of gases, is made clear. What to a 
savage is a miraculous occurrence, becomes a natural 
series of effects to the man by whom the explanation has 
been understood. In like manner, even the most unusual 
forms of plant and animal life are rendered intelligible 
when through classification they have been brought into 
proper relation to well-known objects. 
1 Pp. 152, 153. 
 
-P-A-G-E-71
  FORMS OF SOLUTION FOR THE PROBLEM 61 
38. The third form of explanation most valuable in 
education is that known as generalization. As the term 
is usually understood by logicians, generalization means 
passing by inductive reasoning from a fact or a group of 
facts to a multitude of unexamined cases, which we believe 
to be subject to like conditions; as when, for example, 
from the examination of one specimen of the death’s-head 
moth we assume that the same characteristics will be found 
in all other members of the same class. Instead of having 
to wait until we can take a trip to Germany to see and 
recognize the same peculiarities in other specimens of this 
moth, we jump immediately to the conclusion that if there 
are other examples of it in existence, they will have these 
same unusual marks of skull and cross-bones on their 
backs. If one piece of iron expands when we apply heat 
to it, we assume at once that all other pieces of iron (and 
perhaps other metals as well) will behave in like manner 
under the same condition. When one comet was shown 
to obey the force of gravity, it was considered certain that 
all similar bodies are obedient to the same force. 
39. A less formal and definite act of generalization is 
performed when we recognize even in two facts a common 
nature. Thus, before the nature of the rainbow was under- 
stood, Roger Bacon called attention to other objects which 
present a similar appearance, as, for instance, when the 
sun is shining on drops of water dashed up by the oar, or 
the spray from a waterfall, or the dew on the grass, or the
-P-A-G-E-72
  62 SCIENTIFIC BASIS FOR HIGH-SCHOOL METHODS 
ice crystals on the trees after a sleet storm, or even hexag. 
onal crystals from Ireland or India and other transparent 
stones. ‘No sooner have we grouped together these 
apparently diverse instances, than we have begun to 
generalize, and have acquired a power of applying to one 
instance what we can detect of others. Even when we do 
not apply the knowledge gained to new objects, our com- 
prehension of those already observed is greatly strengthened 
and deepened by learning to view them as particular cases 
of a more general property.” * 
40. The formation of inductive generalizations, as 
above described, serves a double purpose to the investi- 
gator; for in the first case, it enables him to discover and 
formulate that which is common among the manifold, 
that is, to arrive at rules, laws, and causal principles; and 
in the second place, it enables him in turn to utilize these 
generalizations for the explanation of new facts. For 
illustration, when Newton had once arrived at the grand 
generalization called the law of gravitation, the motions 
of all the heavenly bodies could be explained by its aid. 
Inductive research enabled men to discover the laws of 
humidity, conduction, and radiation, while these laws in 
turn enabled them to explain the causes of dew, which 
up to that time had baffled all efforts to understand it. 
When once combustion had been recognized as oxidation, 
a host of hitherto unexplained phenomena, like those per- 
1 William Stanley Jevons, “Principles of Science,” p. 598.
-P-A-G-E-73
  FORMS OF SOLUTION FOR THE PROBLEM 63 
taining to fire and the rusting of metals, could easily be 
explained. Indeed, the development of all science, both 
human and natural, is closely associated and dependent 
upon this form of explanation. Its use in secondary edu- 
cation will be duly emphasized in the chapters which fol- 
low. 
(2) Mathematical Generalizations 
41. As is well known, there is a class of general prin- 
ciples which for want of a better name may be called gen- 
eralizations, and which differ essentially from the generali- 
zations that arise from induction in that they are open to 
demonstration, and hence have more than inductive cer- 
tainty. From the standpoint of the teacher, however, 
they may well be termed generalizations, since they may be 
approached by experience as acquired by observation and 
constructive experiment. In fact, they are most readily 
apprehended and best retained when approached by con- 
crete cases, and whenever possible by inductive methods. 
The history of mathematics shows that this has been the 
order of initial acquisition. TIllustrations are seen in the 
fact that the Romans used pebbles (calculi) to aid in the 
simple rules of arithmetic; that the Chinese use the abacus — 
for computation in the same way as do our primary schools; 
that the Egyptians learned a number of geometrical truths 
by mastering problems that arose in connection with the 
survey of their lands; while we may well conceive that
-P-A-G-E-74
  64 SCIENTIFIC BASIS FOR HIGH-SCHOOL METHODS 
| 
much of the earlier development was incited by concrete 
constructive methods. All exact quantitative science owes 
its existence largely to the fact, first, that great minds 
have discovered and developed systems of mathematical 
generalizations, and second, that other great minds have 
applied them in the explanation of hitherto uncompre- 
hended phenomena. 
42. In briefest outline we have now passed in review 
the methods whereby the busy outside world acquires its 
experience, how it explains its observations, sets and solves 
its problems, and the leading forms which these solutions 
take. We have seen what use is made of authority, ob- 
servation, experiment, hypothesis, analogy, the problem, 
causation, classification, and generalization. It now be- 
comes our task to examine in some detail what use the high 
school should make of these great instruments of acquisi- 
tion and comprehension as it trains the youth of the land 
to meet successfully the situations of the adult world.

  CHAPTER IV 
THE EDUCATIONAL STATUS OF THE HIGH- 
SCHOOL STUDENT 
43. In order to produce its best results in the high- 
school, scientific method, though preserving its original 
spirit, must undergo certain modifications necessitated by 
the educational status of the student in secondary educa- 
tion. What this status is may be seen by comparing it 
with that of the man of research. This comparison in- 
field of knowledge; (2) amount of knowledge to be ac- 
quired; and (3) efficiency in the use of what is acquired. 
44. In determining the whereabouts of the student in the 
domain of knowledge, we have first to consider that he 
stands at the frontiers of his own knowledge, not at those 
of the race. The answers to his problems are known, pre- 
sumably to the teacher, at any rate by somebody; whereas 
the answers to the problems of the investigator are yet to 
be learned. So momentous are the effects of this differ- 
ence that not seldom in the history of education do we 
find periods or movements wherein instruction becomes 
merely authoritative transmission of information con- 
cerning facts and principles. Indeed, this is the standard 
67 
 
-P-A-G-E-78
  68 SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN INSTRUCTION 
method for the suppression of individuality, as may be 
seen from its permanent applications in the orient and its 
occasional ones in the occident. Any system of education 
that can successfully exalt memory and suppress thought, 
that can eliminate observation, experiment, problem, 
hypothesis, and the verification of theory, can bring the 
part of the world which it influences to a static condition, 
in which progress and individuality are no longer either 
to be apprehended or expected. 
It is so much quicker to tell than it is to teach, so infinitely 
less troublesome to state the facts than to lead the student 
to discover them, so incomparably easier for the teacher 
to state or point to cause or generalization than it is to get 
the student to arrive at either through his own thinking, 
that indolence often accomplishes that which is farthest 
from design, namely, the complete suppression of curiosity, 
personal initiative, thoughtful mastery of principle and 
efficiency in its use. With the investigator it is different; 
nobody can tell him the solution of his problem, for nobody 
knows what it is. He must in the nature of the case 
find out for himself, since he stands at the frontier of 
knowledge itself with respect to this one problem. Plainly 
it is an injustice to the student to deprive him of the satis- 
faction and profit of discovery, just because the unknown 
to him happens to be the known to his teacher. Even if 
the methods of research are simplified and abbreviated in 
the case of the student, they are still the laws for the
-P-A-G-E-79
  EDUCATIONAL STATUS OF HIGH-SCHOOL STUDENTS 69 
thoughtful and interesting mastery of what must be 
learned. The joy of discovery of what to him was unknown 
is but a shade less to the student than it was to the man who 
first got the secret from nature herself. The same thought- 
processes are involved in the two cases, and the mental 
benefits are alike in kind, even if not equal in degree. 
These considerations contain a warning to the teacher 
not to let personal ease or showy but shallow results conspire 
to deprive the student of those life-giving thought-processes 
that always come to the front when we use, even if in modi- 
fied form, the methods of the outside world as it solves the 
problems of science and of life. 
Discussion: — 1. Examples of teaching by authority re- 
corded in the History of Education. 2. Ease with which 
languages, history, mathematics, and even natural sciences 
may be taught from the authoritative standpoint. 
45. The second point concerns the amount of knowledge 
to be acquired by the student, and the bearing this has on 
his method of acquiring it. The investigator, with a mind 
already well stored with knowledge, who has worked for 
months and even years to establish a set of causal relations 
or to demonstrate a law, has no difficulty in remembering 
what he has proved, first, because of the vividness of his 
conceptions, and second, because of their limited scope. 
But the high-school student, who must recapitulate in 
a brief time, at least an epitome of the acquisitions of the 
race, finds it difficult to make one small head carry all he   
      
 
-P-A-G-E-80
  7o SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN INSTRUCTION 
learns. The problem may be stated as follows: How can 
we utilize the methods of the investigator, thus securing 
his power, his initiative, his mental alertness, and his 
general attitude of mind, and yet at the same time satisfy 
the quantitative demands for learning that are made upon 
the student? Are we justified in sacrificing quantity 
to quality? Not a few say yes. But student, teacher, 
and community are likely to hold that we are not. On 
the other hand, the feeling is or should be just as strong 
that we are not justified in sacrificing quality to mere 
quantity. We must have both. How can we get them? 
Perhaps the most satisfactory answer to this question 
is that we should select from the mass of material to be 
assimilated in each subject the important nodes of thought, 
and subject these to scientific treatment. By so doing 
we shall reduce to manageable proportions the amount 
of subject-matter that is to be treated according to scien- 
tific method. These nodes of thought are at once the cen- 
tral conceptions to which everything else can be related, 
hence assimilated and remembered, and the starting- 
points for future developments. This procedure is well 
known and freely followed in biology, especially in the 
field of dissection. The mass of material available for 
this exercise is utterly unmanageable when the time of 
the student is considered. Could he live for a thousand 
years and devote all his time to this exercise, he could per- 
haps make a detailed dissection of most of the available
-P-A-G-E-81
EDUCATIONAL STATUS OF HIGH-SCHOOL STUDENTS 71 
forms of plant and animal life, but living for a much 
shorter period, and being able to devote but a fraction of 
his study for a brief term of years to such pursuits, he is 
compelled to select a few types considered to be most 
representative of the forms that might be studied in this 
way. 
What is recognized to be a necessity in biology becomes 
an opportunity in all other subjects. In every department 
of learning these pivotal, developing nodes of thought 
exist, and may be seized upon by the teacher as a means 
of enriching and fructifying the older methods of teaching 
by the infusion of those newer processes, which, patterned 
after the efforts of the outside world in its struggle with 
real situations, are consequently full of vigor and vitality. 
The important nodes of thought are more easily dis- 
cerned in some subjects than in others. In mathematics 
they are distinct and almost unmistakable, yet so much 
room for improvement is there even in arithmetic, algebra, 
and geometry that more than a score of mathematical 
societies among high-school teachers are making the teach- 
ing of these subjects among the most progressive educa- 
tional movements of the day. In physics and chemis- 
try typical experiments are worked out in scientific form, 
and made the nuclei about which are clustered all the facts 
and laws furnished by text-books and lectures in these 
subjects. By common consent high-school English leads 
all other secondary subjects in the poverty of its results,
-P-A-G-E-82
  92 SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN INSTRUCTION 
when the time and effort devoted to it are considered. 
The reason is that in this subject the nodes of thought are 
not yet brought out and articulated into a system that may 
be comprehended and utilized by English teachers as a 
body. It is indeed dissected into spelling, reading, com- 
position, grammar, rhetoric, and literature in all its vari- 
eties, not to mention dictation, etymological word study, 
elocution, and dramatization, but only in the college en- 
trance requirements has there been any attempt to select 
the typical portions even of literature, and this, if one may 
judge by results, has been little more than an attempt to 
choose by lottery from the unsuitable as well as the suit- 
able. German schoolmen, on the contrary, have by long 
experiment and discussion settled upon the best types of 
literature to present in the schools, both elementary and 
secondary. A number of the volumes have an appendix of 
about a dozen pages each, giving the needful information 
about grammar. Deuéisch with them furnishes a unified 
course in the mother-tongue, in which the nodes of thought 
are clearly distinguishable and naturally related. Need- 
less to say, our English must come into the same articulate 
form before we shall be able to get uniformly good results 
from our at present lavish expenditure of time and effort. 
In history, nodes of thought may be found in the biog- 
raphy of great men, in selected periods of development, 
1 “Deutsches Lesebuch,” ro volumes, edited by Professor Dr. Charles 
Muff, Berlin. 
 
-P-A-G-E-83
  EDUCATIONAL STATUS OF HIGH-SCHOOL STUDENTS 73 
in the causes, both fundamental and accessory, that have 
determined events. Here, as elsewhere, each node fur- 
nishes problems to be solved, and hence gives ample oppor- 
tunity for the application of hypothesis and its verifying 
test. Geography easily falls into the type form of study, as 
do treatises that pertain to transportation, manufacture, 
and agriculture.t Similarly, the world of conceptions, 
whether as art, science, psychology, ethics, or philosophy, 
has easily distinguishable nodes of thought which may 
be selected by the teacher as types for the application of 
scientific method. 
Discussion : — Examples of thought-nodes from each high- 
school study. 
46. The third point in the educational status of the 
high-school student concerns his efficiency in the use of 
the knowledge acquired. A detailed exposition of the 
value of this aspect of high-school instruction is made in 
Chapter VII of this book.? Not only should the student 
gain a clear insight into the intellectual achievements 
of the race, but he should also acquire the power to use 
effectively the ideas thus gained. Efficiency is always 
the correlative of insight. To paraphrase Kant, insight

Macmillan Co. See also modern texts in biology. ;

ies,” pp. 162-172, 203, 204.

blind,” in “ Kritik der reinen Vernunft,” p. 79. 
 
-P-A-G-E-84
  74 SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN INSTRUCTION 
without efficiency is helpless; efficiency without insight is 
aimless. Method in teaching must therefore always keep 
this aspect of the subject in mind. The investigator needs 
no such admonition, for he gains efficiency through his 
research. The student, however, is confronted with a 
double difficulty; for, on the one hand, his researches are 
numerous and quickly made, so that the time and repe- 
tition needed for gaining a high degree of efficiency are de- 
nied him, while, on the other hand, he must acquire large 
amounts of knowledge without even the form of research. 
Yet he should become reasonably efficient in the use of all 
that he learns. It is for these reasons that a good method 
of instruction always makes provisions for acquiring 
practical efficiency in the use of knowledge. 
With these preliminary reflections concerning the exist- 
ing differences between the high school and the outside 
world, we may now pass to a consideration of those grand 
divisions in the realm of method that have in varying degree 
always been the tools of the man who would know.
-P-A-G-E-85
  
  CHAPTER V 
THE INDUCTIVE APPROACH 
47. Logicians have long since recognized that there 
are two leading methods of approach to knowledge and 
insight, namely, the inductive and the deductive, though 
neither of these methods is often used independently of 
the other." 
1 German Herbartians defend their so-called ‘Formal Steps’ as a 
complete method, since it recognizes both inductive and deductive stages. 
Critical examination, however, shows that ‘deduction’ as they use the 
term is confined to the ‘application’ of knowledge inductively ac- 
quired in a given lesson. They fail to recognize that the deductive 
approach is equally useful in the acquisition of knowledge. Why should 
one go on storing up generalizations by inductive approach, if the prin- 
ciples thus acquired are to be of no use in gaining new knowledge, in 
explaining the reasons for things? Otherwise one would be shut up to 
the necessity of demonstrating anew every principle of explanation when- 
ever the occasion for its use should arise. Are the demonstrations of 
geometry not to be of use in solving new problems? Must the fun- 
damental laws of motion, mechanics, heat, light, and electricity never be 
used to explain phenomena, except as they are derived anew by induc- 
tiveapproach? Were that the case, one could never give a child a reason 
for a thing, without subjecting him to an inductive process. Shall we 
banish the word because from our vocabulary? Deductive reasoning, 
however, is applied whenever this word is used. Why does water rise 
in the pump? Because of the inequality of air pressure inside and out- 
side of it. Why does the dew fall? Because the fall in temperature 
brings the air below the point of saturation. It is this incompleteness 
75  
-P-A-G-E-86
76 SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN INSTRUCTION 
What Francis Bacon called the new method is in sharp 
contrast to the old method of the middle ages, when men 
were concerned not so much in establishing principles as 
they were in drawing conclusions from admitted premises. 
The difficulty of using the old method as one of research     
    
was that it assumed or accepted from authority the prin- 
ciples from which it reasoned, whereas the greatest need 
of the new natural sciences was that all their old principles 
should be verified, and that new ones should be established 
through inductive research by means of observation, ex- 
periment, hypothesis, and analogy. Bacon very properly 
rejected the old deductive method as utterly impotent and 
barren in the new field. As we have already seen,’ he 
compared the final causes, of which the past had made much 
use, to vestal virgins, worthy of reverence but unfruitful. 
The case for deduction as a useful method in education 
is not so bad, however, as it was in science at the time of 
Bacon, except for its influence upon the student’s general 
attitude of mind; for, whereas in Bacon’s day men did not 
know the laws of nature in any adequate sense, they do 
at present, at least to the extent necessary for instructing 
youth. Therefore, if we now refrain in many cases from 
using this method, it must be for reasons somewhat differ- 
in the theory of the ‘Formal Steps,’ and perhaps also its tendency to 
insist upon a fixed order of procedure, that have led to the severe criticisms 
that have been made upon it in Germany, and that have led in many 
quarters to an underestimate of its inherent excellence. 
1“ Principles of Secondary Education,” Vol. I, p. 61. 
 
-P-A-G-E-87
  THE INDUCTIVE APPROACH 77. 
ent from those that animated Bacon. Granted that the 
teacher knows his subject, there is now no appreciable 
danger that he will mislead his students just because he 
proceeds by the deductive road. But if a given principle is 
either unknown or wrongly interpreted, there is nothing 
to do but to master it by inductive research. It is, there- 
fore, not lest he teach a false or undeveloped science that 
the modern teacher so often treads the inductive path, but 
because he is persuaded that by using this method he can 
get better results than he can by using the other. Some 
of these results have been already sufficiently described. 
They pertain to such things as alertness of mind, growing 
interest in knowledge and its acquisition, the ways of testing 
and of taking the initiative in finding out the truth, vivid- 
ness of perception, depth of insight, hospitality toward 
new problems and eagerness to solve them. These are 
all valuable as mental acquisitions, and if the use of induc- 
tive methods will help to bring them about, the time will 
not be wasted that is used to master its ideals and processes. 
The immediate purpose of induction is, of course, the 
derivation of a rule or principle, the establishment of a 
class, or the discovery of a cause or effect. In other words, 
the goal of an induction is a generalization, a classification, 
or a causal relation. What is true of an induction to the 
investigator holds likewise in the high school, subject to 
the modifications brought about by the educational status 
of the student, as above described.
-P-A-G-E-88

. 78 SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN INSTRUCTION 
48. According to the foregoing analysis there are at 
least three plainly marked stages in all educational methods 
that aspire to scientific completeness. They are as fol- 
lows: — 
1. The acquisition of facts by means of authority, 
observation, and experiment. 
2. The determination of the meaning of these facts 
through the processes of reasoning. 
3. The development of efficiency in the use of the 
knowledge so acquired. 
Looking at these three stages from the standpoint of 
the mental processes involved, we may rename them as 
follows: — 
1. Processes of Apperception. A fact is not acquired 
until it is apperceived, z.e., brought into conscious relation 
to other related elements of what is known by the student. 
2. Processes of Thought. Thinking is necessary in 
determining the meaning of facts, in explaining the sig- 
nificance of things and events. It completes the mental 
assimilation begun when the facts are acquired. 
3. Processes of Application. A student is not effi- 
cient in the use of knowledge until he has had a large 
amount of practice in applying it to new situations. Each 
of these three fundamental categories holds for both deduc- 
tive and inductive methods, and may now be taken up 
in detail and examined from the standpoint of the induc- 
- tive approach.
-P-A-G-E-89
THE INDUCTIVE APPROACH 79 
1. Processes of Apperception — Induction 
49. The initial stage in the acquisition and assimilation 
of facts leading to an induction, whether they be obtained 
through authoritative transmission, observation alone, or 
observation directed and controlled by experiment, is a 
clear and definite formulation of the end, aim, or purpose 
of the lesson to be learned. This problem, end, or aim 
in induction is the establishment of one or another of the 
three leading goals of inductive research, namely, a cause 
(or effect), a classification, or a generalization. There 
may, of course, be many intermediate lessons upon the 
stages that lead to the final general truth, such as those that 
pertain to the mastery of facts given by authority, say in 
books, the direct observation of physical phenomena, 
the performance of experiments for the discovery or con- 
firmation of facts, etc., but neither student nor teacher 
should forget that these stages are but contributory to 
the main solution of the problem. In order to make this 
formulation of end, aim, or purpose, it is often necessary 
to take some liberties with the presentations given in 
text-books, for it is usually the case that they fail to throw 
into bold relief the essential nodes of thought. In history, 
for example, the main concern of the author of a text-book 
usually appears to be to get everything in. To all appear- 
ances he first makes a schematic catalogue of all the facts, 
   
-P-A-G-E-90
80 SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN INSTRUCTION 
and then writes it up, contracting the treatment of the 
topics he fain would enlarge upon in order that nothing 
may be omitted. This is perhaps the worst possible way 
of presenting the subject to the student, for the thing that 
interests him, making the subject seem worth while, is an 
intensive and extensive study of the nodes of history, that 
is, the crucial events, the far-reaching principles at stake 
in a given situation, the basal causes of great national 
activities. For such treatment of historical subjects we 
must go to the monograph on the one hand, and on the 
other, to the monumental works in which genius has op- 
portunity to reveal its insights in due proportion. An 
illustration of the ideal historical monograph is that by 
F. J. Turner on “The Significance of the Frontier in 
American History.” * This gives an adequate exposition 
of thought-nodes which have an inherent value and an 
important development. It treats in succession the In- 
dian trader’s frontier, the rancher’s frontier, the farmer’s 
frontier, showing how each succeeding one developed out 
of the earlier, and the reflex influence of each upon those 
that were earlier in time, and farther east in geographical 
location. It traces the dominating influence of these va- 
rious frontiers upon the land policy of the United States 
in its disposition of the public domain, a policy that always

astonishes the European; it shows in illuminating fashion 
how the needs and demands and power of these same 
frontier regions have dominated our tariff laws and our 
policy of internal improvements, from the early building 
of turnpikes, railroads, and canals to our latest schemes 
for reclaiming land, both from too little, and too much 
water. The first cry was “bring the farm to the factory” 
by developing means of transportation, which was done; 
its second demand was “bring the factory to the farm” by 
levying protective tariffs, and this was done. The mono- 
graph further reveals to the student that the frontier is 
the place where the fusing of European immigrants into 
anew and composite nationality has taken place, and where 
democracy and the American spirit have been developed. 
All this is real American history, but it is not found 
in text-books. 
Another illustration of the historian unbound is John 
Fiske, in his “Civil War in the Mississippi Valley.” John 
Fiske’s text-book in American history is like all the 
rest —it has so much in it that there is little in it for 
the student. But in “The Civil War in the Mississippi 
Valley” the historian is free to develop the essential and 
to suppress the insignificant. A student who reads this 
volume thoughtfully, and has time and opportunity to dis- 
cuss its salient points will know more about the Civil War 
in the West, and will develop a keener interest in historical 
subjects than he would get by studying a dozen text-books

on the subject. What is true in history holds in due meas- 
ure of all the other high-school subjects, and this fact has 
an important bearing upon how the work should be di- 
vided and the aim of the lesson determined. 
(1) Setting the Problem 
50. It is a function of special didactics to search out and 
set in order in the respective subjects the important nodes 
of thought that should be studied according to scientific 
methods. Each of these gives rise to one or more problems 
proper, and usually to a number of subsidiary aims. For 
instance, in the case of the frontier the main problem 
before the class would be to determine the influence of 
the frontier in American history. About this problem will 
cluster the gathering of historical facts, the influences 
that have a causal power, and the various channels through 
which these causes produce their diverse effects. In other 
words, the main problem will break up into a number of 
subsidiary ones, as, for example, what influence had the 
trapper’s frontier upon that of the rancher? What modi- 
fying influences had the settlements immediately beyond 
the ‘fall line’ upon those below it? How did the frontier 
regions control legislation for internal improvements? for 
the distribution of the public domain? for protection to 
new industries, etc.?

THE INDUCTIVE APPROACH 83 
Problems for inductive lessons always grow out of the 
needs of the student and the nature of the subject-matter. 
There is no excuse for an inductive lesson to develop that 
which to the student is self-evident or which lies so near 
at hand that formal and laborious methods to attain it 
become childish or ridiculous. Large instruments should 
be used primarily for ends that are both important 
and difficult to attain. We do not use sledge-hammers 
to forge watchsprings. It is because of these considera- 
tions that one should seek out in every subject those types 
or nodes of thought whose mastery gives the student in- 
sight into a whole series of situations, and an easy and 
effective control of his own powers in the domain in ques- 
tion. Teaching is an art, and hence, like all arts, is free. 
This means that such a subject as English, for example, 
may be taught as an organic whole or in correlated de- 
partments or divided up into independent branches. If 
grammar is to be an isolated study for a series of months, 
it will give rise to a set of problems, to master which by 
inductive study will result in easy and complete mastery 
of the whole field. Nor are these problems numerous or 
exceedingly difficult for the high-school student. In ety- 
mology we have such nodes as the nature and classifica- 
tion of nouns and pronouns, the nature and internal 
modification of the verb, the nature and forms of the 
adjective, the adverb, and of conjunctions, both coérdinate 
and subordinate. Syntax, in like manner, has its problems 
     
-P-A-G-E-94
    84 SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN INSTRUCTION 
of construction, of concord and government, of coérdina- 
tion and subordination, arrangement, position, etc. Lit- 
erature always has its problems to solve, whether they 
refer to words, structure, personality, form, content, plot, 
character, style, motive, movement, or what not. 3 
The problem lies close at hand in all the natural sciences, 
some of which, as in physics, call for the inductive estab- 
lishment of generalizations in the form of laws and prin- 
ciples, some deal with classification, as in biology, and others 
involve largely the investigation of cause and effect. In 
short, whenever it is worth while to lead the student, by 
the inductive road, to a comprehension and mastery of 
any general truth, the inductive problem is involved, and 
should be recognized and formulated accordingly.

tive treatment! in: 1. foreign languages; 2. English; 3. his-

  THE INDUCTIVE APPROACH 85 
(2) Acquiring the Facts 
51. Two questions at once arise when this topic is 
treated: (1) what facts are needed for an induction? 
and (2) how are they to be acquired? 
How many and what kind of facts should be acquired 
to make an induction? If the induction were to be ac- 
cepted without test as final, we should in non-mathe- 
matical inductions need to be sure of practically all of 
the facts, for our conclusion would always be subject to 
disturbance by some unsuspected incongruence between 
our thought and the facts. But since inductions pass 
through the stages of hypothesis and verification, it is 
safe to begin to generalize as soon as we seem to have a 
warrant for doing so. Thus in the case of the death’s- 
head moth above mentioned, a single observation con- 
vinces us that there must somewhere be more of them, 
and that as a class they will have these peculiar markings. 
It will be seen that in this case an induction is made from 
a single observation. In Porto Rico there is a destructive 
creature with a puckery little face, like a microscopic 
edition of the weazened countenance of an old-time Euro- 
pean diplomat as he is usually pictured, the wings and 
body of a beetle, the hind legs of a grasshopper, and the 
burrowing claws of a mole. He flies to his pasture and 
burrows in the ground to feed on the tender roots of plants. 
How shall such a creature be classified, and what is his 
 
-P-A-G-E-96
  86 SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN INSTRUCTION 
English name? His Spanish name is Changa, but that 
gives us no idea of his real place in the insect world. Our 
first task is to locate this fellow in the general class of insects 
to which he belongs; comparing him with the two classes 
to which he seems most akin, namely, the crickets and the 
grasshoppers, we shall find that he undoubtedly belongs 
to the cricket family, since the most of his characteristics 
place him there. The querynext arises, is he a new variety ? 
or are there other known crickets that have the burrowing 
claw? Examination of specimens or of pictures of such 
show that there is a class of insects in the United States 
having these claws, and that they are called mole crickets. 
Undoubtedly, therefore, our little friend, or enemy if we 
like, belongs in this class. At least it is safe to place him 
there temporarily. In the case of classification, therefore, 
we may make our tentative induction with any convenient 
number of pertinent facts. 
Were the problem an inductive study of the barometer, 
we should need facts about the weight of quicksilver and 
of water, and should need to know that the air presses with 
a considerable weight upon all objects at the surface of 
the earth. We should also need to know how a column of 
mercury or of water can be relieved of air pressure on its 
top; that is, we should understand the nature of a vacuum 
and how it can be produced. If our problem extends to 
the uses of the barometer, we should need facts also about 
how changing weights of air pressure are brought about.
-P-A-G-E-97
  
  THE INDUCTIVE APPROACH 87 
With such facts as these at hand we should be able to de- 
rive causes and principles concerning the barometer and 
its uses. With all such topics, the nature of the sub- 
ject-matter determines what kind of facts are essential 
to a proper induction. 
If the problem were to determine the effects of the 
invention of the cotton-gin upon the development of 
slavery, the facts necessary would relate not only to the 
invention itself, but to contributory conditions north and 
south, such as climate, soil, political and social ideals, and 
manufacturing facilities. To seek to understand a great 
economic and social condition such as slavery from the 
examination of a single cause, irrespective of its attendant 
conditions, would be to arrive at valueless conclusions, and 
to lead to bad methods of study at the same time. 
Should the problem be to make an inductive study of 
a character in literature, say Macbeth, needful facts 
would, as Bain * points out, be such as pertain (1) to the 
physical make-up of the man; (2) the physical treatment 
of the system, as to food, drink, exercise, as influenced by 
health, economic status, occupation, etc.; (3) the natural 
and social surroundings as they affect the mind, whether 
the people are cultured or rude, rural or urban (witches), 
the landscape rugged or even, fertile or barren; (4) modes 
of industry or habitual occupation, as, for example, whether 
the man is a soldier, a sailor, a merchant, a manufacturer, 
7 + “Togic-Induction,” p. 289. 
     
-P-A-G-E-98
88 SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN INSTRUCTION 
a farmer, or a priest; (5) the status of the society in which 
the man lived; (6) the education he has had, and the 
like. These and similar facts need to be taken into con- 
sideration in such a study. 
In so-called mathematical inductions the facts needed 
are sufficient concrete illustrations to bring the principle 
in question home to the mind with clearness and convinc- 
ing force as to its validity. 
To a teacher used to the inductive method of approach 
to a problem, the determination of the kind and number 
of facts needful is not a difficult matter, since the nature 
of the subject and problem practically settle these points. 
Discussion: — Facts needed for specific cases of induction 
in the various studies. 
52. More important than the inquiry into the kind and 
number of facts necessary or desirable for an induction 
is the second consideration, How are they to be acquired? 
Shall it be by authority or observation or experiment ? 
Here we come face to face with the fatal facility of text 
and teacher to #ell, not only the facts, but, alas, also the 
causes, the effects, the classifications, and the generaliza- 
tions. What chance has teacher or student to escape this 
inundation of narration? What incentive has either to 
do any real thinking? Even in the sciences supposed to 
be the most fruitful in observation, description, and ex- 
position, the text-books tell the student everything he will 
find if he looks. But having been told, why should he 
 
-P-A-G-E-99
  THE INDUCTIVE APPROACH 89 
look? Curiosity is killed before it is born, and natural 
interest is dampened or extinguished. The case is more 
- hopeful in physics and chemistry, where the experiment 
is regarded as an essential element in the instruction, even 
when over-willing authority insists in telling the student 
what to look for, and what he will find. History, geog- 
raphy, literature, grammar, and biology suffer most from 
the telling dementia. Often, however, if the teacher would 
even temporarily throw not only physic, but the text- 
book to the dogs, the situation for induction might be 
redeemed. With a few good monographs to indicate his- 
torical problems, and a few standard treatises like those 
of John Fiske, Goldwin Smith, McMaster, Von Holtz, 
not to speak of Parkman, Bancroft, Motley, and other 
older historians, to supply data, an inductive study of a 
problem in history may be carried through so as greatly 
to enhance knowledge and interest. A library is at least 
as good a place as an herbarium for the student to find 
out facts for himself. To be sure, the facts of history are, 
in a sense, given to us at second hand, for we live now, and 
not then; but for all this they lose little of their freshness 
when found as the result of search. It is only when they 
are deluged upon us without our volition or desire or exer- 
tion that we lose interest in them. 
The older botanies were almost purely descriptive, 
telling all the facts and principles; more recent ones have 
added plant dissection with and without the microscope, 
 
-P-A-G-E-100
go SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN INSTRUCTION 
in order to get at the facts of structure; the most recent, like 
that of Bergen,’ add experiments practicable to enable 
the student to get first-hand knowledge of function. Those 
necessary facts which the student could not get by obser- 
vation and experiment without too great expenditure of 
time are given by authority, as before. A large part of 
the laboratory work in chemistry work and physics is for 
the determination of facts which later are to lead to induc- 
tions. Many experiments are, of course, designed to test 
hypotheses. 
If inductions in literature are to be attempted, and the 
problem, say the mediatory office of Portia, lies within a 
given book, then the facts are to be sought out by reading 
the work itself. Should the problem, say the treatment 
of the supernatural by Shakespeare, lie in a series of 
works, the facts are to be discovered by the student, 
aided perhaps by citations, in all the works of this author 
which embody this feature of literature. The main point 
is that they should be found by the student’s own investi- 
gations, not be given direct and unsought by teacher or 
author. We may conclude, therefore, that in gathering 
the needful facts for an induction, direct observation and 
experiment should come first as the royal means, to be 
limited only by the nature of the subject and the time at 
disposal; and that in those cases where the facts must 
be taken at second hand, either from the nature of the

THE INDUCTIVE APPROACH gr 
problem or the necessity of getting over the ground, they 
should never be passively, but always actively acquired 
by the student. 
Discussion: — Practical limits to observation and experi- 
ment as means for gathering facts in: 1. languages; 2. his- 
tory;! 3. exact sciences;? 4. biological science;* 5. earth 
sciences. 
2. Processes of Thought —Inductive Approach 
53. That toward which we approach by the inductive 
method is some form of generalization, be it a cause or 
effect, a classification, a definition, a formula, or a gener- 
alization in the form of rule, principle, or law. In other 
words, we are to seek an adequate explanation of the 
facts brought before us by the problem in hand. 
The essential thought stages of this process are two; 
namely, 
(1) The formation of an hypothesis, suggested by the 
facts acquired to account for the given phenomenon; and 
(2) The testing of this hypothesis by comparison of its 
consequences with the results of a careful analysis of re- 
lated phenomena. 
The hypothesis may turn out to be correct, or as often

Heath & Co., Boston.

The Macmillan Co., N.Y.

& Co., Chicago. 
 
-P-A-G-E-102
  92 SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN INSTRUCTION 
happens, it may have to be modified as incomplete, ot 
totally rejected as false or inadequate. The testing must 
be continued until the hypothesis has proved to be either 
right or wrong. 
At this point we may see the inevitable mixing of methods, 
inductive and deductive, for the new hypothesis to which 
we attain by tentative induction now becomes a principle 
which we proceed to test deductively. We do this by de- 
ducing its consequences in a given direction, and testing 
them by known facts. Thus, suppose we had come by 
inductive approach to the hypothesis that darkness is a 
cause of dew. Then by this principle the more darkness 
we have the more dew we should expect. But this cannot 
be true, since no dew falls in dark rooms, and it often fails 
to gather on the darkest, namely, the cloudiest nights. 
This mixing of processes, however, need not lead to con- 
fusion of thought by either student or teacher, since it 
arises so spontaneously that no attention need be paid 
to it, except for purposes of clear analysis. The essential 
things to bear in mind in the inductive approach have 
already been indicated:—the formulation of a clear aim 
in the guise of a problem, the gathering of pertinent 
facts, the tentative hypothetical solution of the problem 
suggested by the facts at hand, and then a thorough 
testing of the validity of this hypothesis by comparison 
of its consequences with other related facts which think- 
ing brings to light.
-P-A-G-E-103
  THE INDUCTIVE APPROACH 93 
(1) The Hypothesis 
54. It sometimes happens that the mind leaps almost 
instinctively to the true cause of a phenomenon as soon as 
the needful facts about it have been gathered and fairly 
understood, as in the explanation of the action of the com- 
mon pump in consequence of its valves and the outside 
pressure of the atmosphere upon the surface of the water. 
In such cases there need be no coquetting with hypotheses 
and their verifications. The principle should be frankly 
accepted as true as soon as it appeals irresistibly to the 
mind, and then its manifold applications illustrated. It 
is especially for such cases as these that Mill’s five prin- 
ciples concerning agreement and difference apply directly 
and with convincing force. Their greatest field of appli- 
cation is in the exact sciences, but they hold also concern- 
ing some things in biological and earth sciences like geog- 
raphy and geology, as well as in some aspects of human 
affairs. 
In most cases, however, in which inductive processes 
are desirable, this early convincing certainty as to the prin- 
ciple of explanation is not present, and the mind may be 
long in doubt as to what is the true explanation. This 
is the case in real life, for it is only in comparatively recent 
times that satisfactory explanations have been found for 
seemingly simple things, like the falling of dew, the burn- 
1 Compare pp. 48-54.
-P-A-G-E-104
94 SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN INSTRUCTION 
ing of wood, the circulation of water, the glacial deposit of 
boulders, etc. Even if the modern schoolboy is able with 
the aid of his books and his teachers to make short cuts 
to race achievement, he should, nevertheless, be trained 
in the forms of thought that have led to these results, 
and will lead to like ones hereafter. 
(2) Cause and Effect 
55. The form of the hypothesis will, of course, follow 
the solution called for by the nature of the problem. 
In history and in some departments of natural science it 
will call for either prediction as to cause or effect, or both. 
Were the problem, What was the effect of English home 
politics upon English colonial policy at the time of the 
Revolution? the facts gathered and the hypotheses de- 
vised would pertain first to causes, and then the deductive 
prediction as to their probable effect. In similar fashion, 
the problem may be to determine the influence of circum- 
stances upon two historical characters, one of whom ap- 
pears to have been moulded by them, while the other 
seems to have controlled them for his own purposes. The 
hypothesis is in place here, even though it is as shifting as 
the flight of birds. Did this or that contingency turn 
the expected victory to defeat? ‘Yes, for the sleet storm 
retarded the designed movement of troops. No, for there 
were more fundamental reasons, perhaps of a psychical 
   
-P-A-G-E-105
  THE INDUCTIVE APPROACH 95 
nature; the men were discouraged by their losses and the 
apparent hopelessness of their cause. Again, how are 
the given facts to be interpreted? Comenius, for example, 
aimed at a complete reformation of instruction, yet he 
was known for two hundred years merely as a man with 
a new method of teaching Latin. Why should an incident 
only of his reform be heeded? Shall the hypothesis be, 
say, because he was a bishop? because he was visionary? 
ahead of his age? hampered by the convulsions of the 
Thirty Years’ War? because his system lacked a psy- 
chological basis? Each of these suppositions may be 
examined in turn, to be either approved or rejected wholly 
or in part. 
Should the problem be to find the effect of a given fer- 
tilizer upon plant growth, a prediction can be made from 
analogy with other fertilizers, and then the necessary 
verifying experiments be tried. Or, what is more probable, 
the experiment will be tried first, a conclusion as to the 
universality of such effects be formulated from this one 
trial, and then subsequently tested under new conditions 
and with other plants. 
Teachers who are desirous of treating at least some 
topics in history by inductive methods, in which the 
hypothesis plays an important part, will find much aid 
in the works of such authors as Mary Sheldon Barnes,‘ 
+“Studies in American History,” “Studies in General History,” 
“Studies in Historical Method,” D. C. Heath & Co., Boston.
-P-A-G-E-106
    96 SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN INSTRUCTION 
B. A. Hinsdale,1 Albert Bushnell Hart,? and Edwin 
M. Bacon.’ Of all these Mrs. Barnes is probably the 
most helpful. 
(3) Classification 
56. The high-school subjects in which inductive work 
in classification is especially appropriate, are botany, 
zodlogy, and mineralogy. Bain even calls them the 
sciences of classification, so important is this aspect of 
their study. They are, moreover, the sciences in which 
the getting of knowledge of facts at first hand by obser- 
vation seems most necessary and natural. Observation 
and inductive classification are correlative processes. 
If students are to be led to observe, what shall they do 
with their observations but condense them into manage- 
able groups or classes as a result of their effort? On the 
other hand, if they are to exercise the thought processes 
involved in classification, then the observations are an 
obvious prerequisite. Thus, the student begins the study 
of leaves, say, with a leafy twig of the elm. He makes a 
sketch of it to impress ‘its form and structure upon his 
mind, noticing how many rows of leaves there are, how 
much overlapping of leaves there is when the upper sides

THE INDUCTIVE APPROACH 97 
are held toward him; what the shape of an individual 
leaf is taken as a whole and whether it is bilaterally sym- 
metrical or not; the shape at the tip, at the base, or the 
margin, etc. Then he makes a similar study of the maple 
leaf, observing in what respects the veining and other 
characteristics are like those of the elm and in what re- 
spect they are different. Proceeding in this way until a 
sufficient number of different leaves have been minutely 
studied, he is then ready to group them into classes accord- 
ing to striking characteristics, such as those that pertain 
to veining, simple or compound structure, arrangement, 
etc. In a similar way he will study stem, bud, roots, 
cells, functions, and the like. Such exercises in inductive 
classification are of special importance while the student 
is building up his knowledge of classes upon a basis of 
first-hand experience. When, however, this initial knowl- 
edge is well established, he can make free deductive use 
of it in the study of other plants that are new to him. 
All sciences of classification have two aspects; the one 
general, and the other special. The general aspect re- 
lates to species, genera, or larger grand divisions; the 
special relates to the detail of characteristics belonging 
to objects, and forms the descriptive part of the science. 
Thus in mineralogy, the general divisions comprise crystal- 
lography, or the form of minerals; the physical properties, 
as cleavage, fracture, hardness, tenacity, specific gravity, 
optical properties, heat, electricity, magnetism; chemical 
H 
 
-P-A-G-E-108
  08 SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN INSTRUCTION 
properties, as chemical composition and reactions. The 
special division, named description of species, is the de- 
tailed account of all known minerals according to these 
properties. 
In botany, the first division comprises structural and 
morphological botany, or the parts of the plants generally, 
tissues, and organs, stated on the methodical plan of pro- 
ceeding from the general to the special. Nutritive organs 
have precedence of the reproductive; their subdivisions 
are taken in the order, root, stem, leaves. The division 
is completed by the functions or physiology of the different 
tissues and organs. In zodlogy, the same general order 
of procedure is followed out, though not in so great detail 
on account of complications.’ 
It is the function of the larger type studies in biology 
and mineralogy, already described,’ to enable the student 
through his own observation and inductive reasoning to 
‘arrive at a first-hand knowledge of the broader classifica- 
tions of the study. The classification needed in the special 
descriptive parts may be more rapidly attained through 
speedy but accurate observations. 
There is some classification necessary in grammar, such 
as that of nouns and pronouns and the other parts of speech ; 
but the inductive approach to these matters is mostly 
made in the elementary school, and has, moreover, no

such educational value or practical usefulness as classifica- 
tion in the biological sciences. 
Discussion: — Examples of inductive approach to classi- 
fications in zodlogy; in mineralogy. 
(4) Generalization 
57. In former sections (39-42) the meaning and func- 
tion of the generalization, both mathematical and non- 
mathematical, as a stage in scientific explanation, have 
been discussed. Where the inductive derivation of a 
generalization is the thought-object of a lesson, hypotheses 
are freely used, — to be tested and amended or discarded 
if found inadequate, or retained after sufficient verifica- 
tion. 
Induction always involves a leap, — a jump to conclu- 
sions lying beyond the cases under immediate observa- 
tion. This can be hardly called a leap in the dark, how- 
ever, for back of it is a belief in the uniformity of nature; 
that is, a confidence that under uniform conditions like 
causes will produce like effects. But the purpose of in- 
ductive lessons in the school is not so much to exercise 
students in making this leap, as to teach them rather to 
look both before and after the leap to see if it is fully justi- 
fied by the facts. We are all prone to jump to conclusions, 
but we are not all equally trained to inquire into their 
validity. Induction is one of the world’s important 
methods of discovering the laws that govern it, and the
-P-A-G-E-110

school has not done its full duty until it has trained its 
students to use the method effectively and safely. That 
induction pure and simple is seldom used either in school 
or in life is most true, as will hereafter be made sufficiently 
clear, but there is a distinct gain for exposition in consid- 
ering it as if it were entirely independent. 
58. Writers on induction always point out that the 
basal propositions on which all our reasoning rests are 
inductively derived from our experience, originating in 
the facts revealed by observation. This view holds with 
unquestionable validity in the realm of non-mathematical 
generalizations, whether they refer to laws that govern 
men or determine the events of the physical world. The 
history of mathematics reveals to us, moreover, that 
many insights of the mathematician are inductively sug- 
gested, as, for instance, when the Egyptians were led to 
develop geometry because geometrical problems were 
forced upon them by the building of the pyramids and 
the annual inundations of the Nile. As Kant points out, 
however, the generalizations of mathematics when once 
understood appeal to us as universally valid and necessary. 
It never occurs to us to ask whether what is mathemati- 
cally true in the temperate regions is also true in the frigid 
zone. We know it is, and we know, moreover, that it 
was equally true a million years ago and will still be valid 
a million years hence. In the biological world, however, 
our inductions are not so convincing. Because all crows
-P-A-G-E-111
  THE INDUCTIVE APPROACH Iori 
are black in the temperate regions, we can hardly affirm 
that they cannot be white above the arctic circle. Because 
observation now leads us to conclude that one species does 
not at present arise from another, we are not certain that 
it may not have done so under conditions in the past. 
The position of Bacon, already mentioned above,’ that men 
must ever fall back upon constantly renewed inductive 
generalizations to be certain of their premises in deductive 
reasoning, still appeals to the modern man, for it is one 
way of being sure that generalizations accord with facts. 
The complementary method, is, of course, that of veri- 
fication, wherein a law is applied to see if it accords with 
what is already known. In the words of Faraday, “I 
can trust a fact, but I always want to examine an asser- 
tion.” 
59. In the experimental sciences, like physics and 
chemistry, the natural way is to get at the facts for an in- 
duction by way of the experiment. Suppose the problem 
to be, Find the law for the intensity of light with respect 
to distance. To get at the facts, perform the following 
experiment. In a dark room place a tin shield with a 
small hole in it in front of a lighted lamp; adjust a paste- 
board shield just an inch square one inch from and in 
horizontal line with the hole in the tin shield; rule a block 
of paper into inch squares and use this to record the size 
of the shadow cast at varying distances by the inch-square 
1See pp. 6, 7.
-P-A-G-E-112
  102 SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN INSTRUCTION 
pasteboard shield; move the block of ruled paper back 
until the shadow just covers four squares, and measure its 
distance from the light; move the block still further back 
until the shadow covers nine squares, then sixteen squares, 
then twenty-five, observing the distance it has been moved 
back each time. What do you find the distance to be in 
each case? About one inch. Arrange in two lines the 
two series, thus: — 
Inches in distance from light T50@) Sid, 5, 
Square inches of shadow cast T, 4, 9, 16, 25 
What relation do you see between the numbers of the 
two series? Each of the numbers in the second series 
is the square of the corresponding one of the first. What 
is proved by the experiment? That the size of the shadow 
cast is in proportion to the square of the distance from the 
source of the light. What may be inferred about the in- 
tensity of the light from the same source upon the spaces 
corresponding to the shadows were the inch-square paste- 
board screen removed? The intensity of light upon any 
surface is inversely proportional to the square of its dis- 
tance from the source of light. Why? Because the size 
of the shadow shows the amount of surface over which a 
given amount of light would have to be distributed, so 
that the intensity of the light is inversely proportional 
to the square of the distance. 
By remembering that circles are to each other as the 
squares of their diameters, the same results may be ob-
-P-A-G-E-113
  THE INDUCTIVE APPROACH 103 
tained by using a circular pasteboard shield one inch in di- 
ameter, and an unruled paper block to receive the shadow, 
this time circular in form. Move the block back until 
the shadow upon it is two inches in diameter, then 3, 4, 
and 5 inches, observing each time how far back it has 
been moved. Again we get the two series, 
Distance from light 1, 4,3, 4, 5 
Corresponding size of shadow I, 4, 9, 16, 25 
A deductive verification of the result of the induction 
would be obtained by thinking of the point of light as 
surrounded by a hollow sphere, say 1 foot in diameter. 
The interior surface of the sphere would receive all the 
light, which would fall equally upon it with a certain 
intensity. Then suppose the first sphere removed and 
another ro feet in diameter substituted for it. The same 
light would now have to illuminate a surface 100 times as 
great, hence the intensity would be but z45 as great as in 
the first case. The surfaces are to each other as 100 to 1, 
but the distances of the surfaces from the light are as 10 
to 1. Hence the law. (Hoadley’s “ Physics,” p. 377.) 
60. In ways similar to those above described, there may 
be an inductive experimental approach to the laws gov- 
erning motion, velocity, force, falling bodies, the pendu- 
lum, the mechanical powers, the mechanics of liquids, 
specific gravity, the various phenomena of sound, heat, 
and electricity, in short, to practically the whole of physics 
as taught in the high school. Every good modern text

61. Most modern works on chemistry use the experi- 
ment, not only for determining facts and verifying laws, 
but also for deriving inductive generalizations. Torrey, 
for example, devotes some ten lectures to isolating, weigh- 
ing, and measuring gases, and the composition and syn- 
thesis of water, closing the series by a lesson on the internal 
structure of gases. The facts brought out are few, but 
important. Most of the experiments are made to serve 
as a basis for inductive reasoning, though the author very 
properly uses principles well known to chemists to com- 
plete the explanation of what to the student would be but 
partially understood, as, for example, the citation of 
Avogadro’s hypothesis in the twentieth lecture to general- 
ize the facts learned concerning the internal structure of 
gases." 
Some chemical works, however, are entirely devoid of 
inductive processes. For illustration, Appleton’s “Short 
Course in Qualitative Analysis” devotes itself wholly to the 
establishment of tests, first for the metallic elements, in 
five classes; and then for the non-metallic elements, in six 
classes. The student is first informed what the test is, 
and then told to make it. Not only is there no attempt at 
1 Joseph Torrey, Jr., “Studies in Chemistry,” Henry Holt & Co., N.Y.
-P-A-G-E-117
  THE INDUCTIVE APPROACH 107 
induction, but there is likewise no hint given as to how this 
knowledge is to be applied. There may be justification 
for such courses, especially with college students who are 
beginning a professional study of chemistry, but for the 
high-school student certainly those works that stimulate 
him to use his mind and open up the human side of the 
science are greatly to be preferred. 
Nowhere are the initial stages of an inductive study of 
science more admirably and convincingly set forth than in 
Armstrong’s volume on “The Teaching of Scientific 
Method.” + Though intended for teachers of elementary 
schools, the courses and methods illustrated are of equal 
interest to those engaged in secondary education. 
62. There is ample room for inductive generalization 
both in biological and earth sciences, as well as for classi- 
fication and the determination of causes. With plants 
and animals we may make inductive studies of structure, 
of the function of organs or parts, and of life history. In 
physical geography we may in the same manner approach 
the laws of climate as determined by latitude, elevation, 
the prevalence of dry or moisture-laden winds, or the 
action of storms as influenced by changes in temperature, 
in barometric pressure, and the like. In brief, there is 
no proposition of natural science which may not be ap- 
proached by inductive methods, should it be deemed 
‘Henry E. Armstrong, “The Teaching of Scientific Method,” The 
Macmillan Co., N.Y.
-P-A-G-E-118
  108 SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN INSTRUCTION 
desirable to do so. For reasons already given, however, 
and for others still to be discussed, it is not practicable 
to conduct all instruction even in the natural sciences in 
this manner. 
Discussion: — Illustrations of inductive derivation of 
generalizations in biology and in the earth sciences. 
63. As is well known, most mathematical reasoning is 
deductive in character, and is consequently not to be 
treated under the head of induction. However, as has 
been pointed out already (Section 57), there is a species 
of induction which is not only legitimate, but highly useful 
in mathematical teaching. It consists in prefacing general 
demonstrations by particular ones. Thus, in leading up 
to the general formula (a+ 6)? equals a? + 2ab +P, 
the student may be called upon to expand such expres- 
sions as (2 + 3)”, (3 + 4)’, (4 +5)’, and then to perform the 
operation indicated by (a + b)’, or (a + 6) x (a+), etc., 
until the formula expresses not an abstraction, but some- 
thing of which he is perfectly cognizant. In the same 
way, before relying upon a general demonstration of the 
binomial theorem, he should develop by actual multipli- 
cation the expressions (a + b), (a + b)*, (a + b)*, (a + )’, 
etc. DeMorgan says, “We believe firmly, that to the 
mass of young students, general demonstrations afford no 
conviction whatever; and that the same may be said of 
almost every species of mathematical reasoning when it is 
entirely new.’ Again, “Inductive reasoning is of as fre-

quent occurrence in the sciences as any other. It is 
certain that most great discoveries have been made by 
means of it; and the mathematician knows that one of 
his most powerful engines of demonstration is that peculiar 
species of induction which proves many general truths 
by demonstrating that, if the theorem be true in one case, 
it is true for the succeeding one. But the beginner is 
obliged to content himself with a less rigorous species of 
proof, though equally conclusive, as far as moral certainty 
is concerned. Unable to grasp the generalizations with 
which the more advanced student is familiar, he must 
satisfy himself of the truth of general theorems by observ- 
ing a number of particular simple instances which he is 
able to comprehend.” * 
Nor is this concrete, inductive approach less helpful 
in geometry, strict deductive science as it is. It has long 
been the custom in German schools to precede the de- 
monstrative aspects of the subject by a long series of 
exercises calculated to make the pupil at home in the 
terminology and conceptions of geometry, by familiar- 
izing him with forms of planes and solids, and with con- 
crete constructions and experimental proofs. In the 
United States this kind of work is called concrete geom-

etry. The “Report of the Committee of Ten” upon this 
subject is so concise and convincing that the greater part 
of it is here inserted. After pointing out the need of pre- 
liminary exercises in the kindergarten and in the primary 
grades, the Report continues as follows: — 
“At about the age of ten for the average child, systematic 
instruction in concrete or experimental geometry should 
begin, and should occupy about one school hour per week 
for at least three years. During this period the main facts 
of plane and solid geometry should be taught, not as an 
exercise in logical deduction and exact demonstration, 
but in as concrete and objective a form as possible. For 
example, the simple properties of similar plane figures 
and similar solids should not be proved, but should be 
illustrated and confirmed by cutting up and rearranging 
drawings or models. 
“This course should include among other things the 
careful construction of plane figures, both by the unaided 
eye and by the aid of ruler, compasses, and protractor ; 
the indirect measurement of heights and distances by the 
aid of figures carefully drawn to scale; and elementary 
mensuration, plane and solid. 
“The child should learn to estimate by the eye and to 
measure with some degree of accuracy the lengths of lines, 
the magnitudes of angles, and the areas of simple plane 
figures; to make accurate plans and maps from his own 
actual measurements and estimates, and to make models
-P-A-G-E-121
  
THE INDUCTIVE APPROACH I1i 
of simple geometrical solids in pasteboard and in 
clay. 
“Of course, while no attempt should be made to build 
up a complete logical system of geometry, the child should 
be thoroughly convinced of the correctness of his con- 
structions and the truth of his propositions by abundant 
concrete illustrations and by frequent experimental tests; 
and from the beginning of the systematic work he should 
be encouraged to draw easy inferences, and to follow short 
chains of reasoning. 
“From the outset the pupil should be required to express 
himself verbally as well as by drawing and modelling, and 
the language employed should be, as far as possible, the 
language of the science, and not a temporary phraseology 
to be unlearned later.” * 
Not only is a course of concrete geometry of great ser- 
vice to the demonstrative aspects of the subject, but an 
inductive approach to the more difficult propositions is 
frequently also of great aid to the demonstration itself. 
An instance is the numerous concrete ways of prefacing 
the demonstration of the theorem that in a right triangle 
the square on the hypothenuse equals the sum of the 
squares on the other two sides.

64. History being preéminently the realm of the con- 
tingent,’ that is, of a class of causes and effects which, 
unlike those revealed by natural science, do not follow an 
invariable order of natural law, but are influenced and 
sometimes determined by circumstances that might have 
been otherwise, does not yield itself readily to general- 
ization as a form of explanation. The natural, and 
indeed almost the only truly historical, form of explanation 
of historical events is that of cause and effect.? Though 
one writer may take as his aim “to tell how it actually 
was,” the complete historian must add “why it was” 
to his description of facts. Otherwise, though we had the 
truth, its significance would be left to surmise. 
There are, it is true, certain influences arising from 
historical study which we hope to bring to bear upon the 
character of the student. Enlightenment as to the rise 
and development of civil liberty and social well-being 
should clarify the judgment of youth, develop a spirit of 
toleration, and form a permanent social attitude that 
shall make for codperative good-will. Yet, if we try to 
develop from history generalizations of ethical or even 
pious tenor, we shall find, in any attempt to be specific, 
that the ethical sword is two-edged, and cuts both ways. 
The content of our maxims as derived from specific 
examples depends upon which side we are. People still

dispute as to whether Charles the First of England was a 
martyr who died an unjust death, or a traitor who brought 
on and deserved his fate. The ethical lessons we draw 
from the American Revolution might change their value 
if transported to England. Whether the deeds of the 
French Revolution are to be considered a just return for 
ages of abuse of the people by the nobles, or whether it 
was a demonic outbreak incited by the spirit of evil and 
wreaking its blind fury upon the minority who alone 
upheld civilization, depends upon what set of facts re- 
ceives the emphasis. The judicious teacher will strive to 
make his students understand the whole situation, feeling 
sure that out of complete understanding will grow a spirit 
of toleration toward all who saw only in part, and will 
leave to partisans and bigots the task of deriving ethical 
generalizations from events that are susceptible of giving 
rise to contradictory principles by those who look only 
at the other side.

deductive approach to the study of a foreign language. 
The older procedure, known as the ‘translation’ method, 
relies upon the memory to store up a large knowledge of 
words, inflections, and rules of syntax, and then applies

  114 SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN INSTRUCTION 
these deductively in translating the foreign language into 
the vernacular. The avowed final purpose of the older 
method is the production of mental discipline, it being 
assumed that a student who can master a subject as diffi- 
cult as Latin or Greek is intellectually capable of accom- 
plishing anything not impossible to the mind. This 
method will be discussed at some length in the next chapter. 
The newer, rival method, applied especially to modern 
foreign languages, proceeds by inductive approach to a 
mastery of words, idioms, inflections, constructions, and 
rules of syntax, and through these to a reading and speak- 
ing knowledge of the language. Pronunciation is taught 
by a system of comparative phonetics, in which the sounds 
of the foreign tongue are compared to those of the ver- 
nacular, and thoroughly learned by constant imitation 
and practice. This new method was forcibly suggested by 
Vietor in an anonymous essay entitled, ‘The Teaching of 
Languages must start Afresh,” and in which the main 
points were formulated as follows:' “First, foreign lan- 
guages should, primarily, be taught by means of con- 
nected types, the grammar being kept in the background ; 
second, imitation and thought should be encouraged, in- 
stead of translation; third, pronunciation should be taught 
upon the basis of scientific phonetics; and fourth, living 
languages should be taught before dead ones.”

language should fail to read these illuminating pages. 
 
-P-A-G-E-125
  
THE INDUCTIVE APPROACH IIs 
As indicated by Russell: ‘There are now two principal 
schools of language teachers in Germany diametrically 
opposed in doctrine. The representatives of the old 
school are firmly intrenched in the Gymnasien and uni- 
versities, where scholastic ideas largely predominate, 
and classical training with a view to mental discipline 
receives the first consideration. The reformers count 
among their numbers a few of the younger university 
professors and Privat Docenten and the majority of in- 
structors in the Real schools and Héhere Téchterschu- 
len.”* It may be added that the older method follows 
substantially the same plan in both ancient and modern 
foreign languages, since their aim is mental discipline, 
rather than the acquisition of literary content and prac- 
tical mastery. 
Whatever we may think of the comparative value of the 
two methods for teaching foreign languages to adults or 
to youths in the later years of the high school, the inductive 
development lesson appears to have almost self-evident 
superiority when these languages are begun early; that is, 
when the children are from eight to twelve or fifteen years 
of age, for during this period the organs of speech are 
plastic, and can reproduce any sound the ear is capable of 
perceiving, while interest in abstractions and their de- 
ductive application is naturally faint and can be enlisted 
only by pressure or by a high quality of enthusiasm and

    116 SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN INSTRUCTION 
didactic skill on the part of the teacher. On the other 
hand, the concreteness, vividness, and self-revealing use- 
fulness of cumulative growth in the comprehension and 
practical mastery of a new language, such as is possible 
when the inductive method is skilfully applied, are con- 
vincing evidences that this method in the hands of a com- 
petent teacher will produce the best results. Certain 
elements of competency for the successful use of this 
method must be presupposed. They are, first, ability 
to speak the language with considerable accuracy and 
some fluency; and second, knowledge of comparative 
phonetics, embracing at least the sounds of the vernacular 
and those of the language to be learned, and much skill 
in producing them. Given these two qualifications, all 
the rest is but an application of customary teaching de- 
vices. Type forms will be presented, drilled upon, com- 
mitted to memory, and infinitely varied; grammatical 
forms will be introduced one by one, dwelt upon, re- 
corded in note-books, and constantly repeated until use 
has made them perfectly familiar; and then when the 
pupils can read with some facility, the text will be read by 
master and student, the meaning analyzed and commented 
upon, not in the vernacular, but in the foreign language. 
So likewise new points in construction, new words, new 
turns of expression, will be noted and discussed, still in 
the new language. Only when the difficulty cannot be 
overcome by the combined knowledge of the class, is the

vernacular to be introduced to clear it up.’ Finally, 
selected portions containing idiomatic grammatical or other 
difficulties may be translated into the mother-tongue, 
but no translation of what can be adequately understood 
without it is permitted. The thought is always kept in 
direct touch with the new expressicz, no intermediary 
being allowed. As courtship is always most engaging 
when the interested parties can speak face to face, rather 
than through a middleman, say the father, so thought and 
expression get on best together when they are not divided 
by an interpreter, even if that interpreter is the vernacular. 
Bearing in mind that the schemer is always superior 
to his scheme, the man to the method, it may be said, in 
general, that where the teacher knows the language he is 
attempting to teach, where the pupils are young, and the 
leading objects are the quickest and most vital apprehen- 
sion of the thought, together with the best practical com- 
mand of the new tongue, the inductive approach, especially 
to modern foreign languages, is greatly to be preferred. 
On the other hand, where the teacher has only a reading 
knowledge of the foreign tongue, where the students are 
more mature, and the leading objects are linguistic disci- 
pline? and the rapid acquisition of the power to read, then 
the deductive method will doubtless be most effective.

66. The time-honored method of teaching English 
Grammar in England and the United States is deductive, 
in that the student learns inflections, definitions, and rules 
of construction as given by authority in the text-books, and 
then parses and construes according to these principles. 
In Germany, however, where but little use is made of 
text-books, the student’s knowledge of grammar is built 
up gradually and mostly by the inductive approach. 
The first is economical of time but wasteful of under- 
standing; the second costs time, indeed, but is rich in 
insight and interest and develops efficiency in use. The 
inductive approach to grammar, much more than the 
deductive, leads to the higher language sense, whereby 
its possessor can use the language of culture with as much 
instinctive ease as the child prattles the language of the 
home.’ Still, education, like diplomacy and legislation, 
must often yield some desirable things in order to get others 
more highly esteemed. The best teachers here as else- 
where feel free to use the book, even should it be dogmatic 
and thought-repressive, because of its condensed and

abbreviated methods, but when subtle distinctions are to 
be apprehended, as in the classification of nouns or the 
modal inflection of verbs, time is actually saved by the 
use of the slower, but more certain, inductive approach. 
An additional reason why the high school may limit in- 
duction to essentials is that the easier conceptions have 
already been acquired by inductive processes in the gram- 
mar school.

school grammar. 2. Place and function of comparative and 
historical grammar, and the merits of induction in presenting 
them.? 
67. Literature, as we have seen, gives rise to many 
problems, all of which may be investigated by inductive 
processes through a study of the works themselves. It may 
be well to suggest with Professor Dowden” that when it 
comes to a study of the author himself, it is much more 
profitable to examine his works to learn what manner of 
man he is, rather than to consult cyclopedias to see who

he was, when he lived and what is said about him. Are 
his senses all equally keen? Is he visual minded or audi- 
tory minded? Does he love the odors of flowers and field? 
Does he delight in the touch of velvet? Does he, like 
Browning or Kipling or Roosevelt, revel in the strenuous, 
in the swing and dash of vigorous motion, and stirring 
deeds? Or, on the other hand, are his pleasures found in 
minor esthetic thrills that arise from the play of emotions 
so subtle as to escape the prosaic mind? What emotions 
does the author portray most effectively, wonder? terror? 
love? grief? hate? revenge (think of Portia, Shylock, 
Othello, Macbeth, Rosalind, etc.)? What feeling has he 
for the beautiful, the sublime, the humorous? Is he 
placid or fiery (Carlyle, Hugo) in his temperament? Are 
his judgments temperate and just or precipitate and 
partisan? Though such studies as these are made in the 
spirit of induction, they do not lead to generalizations, 
since they pertain to the individual alone; they are merely 
attempts to get knowledge at first hand, and hence possess 
the vital character, the personal, illuminating vividness 
of all heuristic investigations. Not only does the search 
for the dominant characteristics of an author as manifested 
in his works make the student acquainted with his literary 
personality (the only one that concerns the reader), but it 
leads also to deepening literary insight and appreciation.

THE DEDUCTIVE APPROACH 
68. The general purposes of the deductive approach 
are, first, to enable us to utilize our stored-up experience 
in order to anticipate and acquire new experience, and 
second, to explain facts or prove new propositions on the 
basis of causes, classifications, and generalizations already 
established. The word because (or any other term having 
the same meaning) constitutes its formula. For illustra- 
tion, water rises in the pump, because it is forced up by 
the outside pressure of the atmosphere upon the surface 
of the water outside the pump when the pressure on the 
inside is lessened by the act of pumping; this noun must be 
put in the nominative form, because it is the subject of the 
verb; these triangles are equal, because two sides and the 
included angle of the one equal two sides and the included 
angle of the other; population tends to press against food 
supply, because the one increases in a geometrical, and the 
other only in an arithmetical ratio; nitrogen is difficult 
to fix, because it has such slight chemical affinity with other 
elements, and when fixed makes an unstable compound 
for the same reason (explosives usually contain this 
element). 
122 
 
-P-A-G-E-133
  THE DEDUCTIVE APPROACH 123 
Since deduction is contrasted to induction as a method 
of acquiring and of determining the meaning of facts, 
there is no need to alter the formal categories, apper- 
ception, thought, and application. 
Discussion’: — Contrast between the methods of the scho- 
lastic and those of the modern man of science. May both be 
justified by considering the nature of the problems each tries 
to solve? 
1. Processes of Apperception — Deduction 
69. As already briefly explained in Section 5, the second 
stage of apperceptive process in gaining new knowledge 
is of a deductive character, in that we use our stored-up 
experience to anticipate what to look for and what we may 
perhaps expect to find. This is true in all acquisition of 
knowledge through the senses, hence in direct observation, 
whether accompanied by experiment or not;* and it finds 
a manifold use in the schoolroom in the form of what may 
be called the deductive development lesson of the antici- 
patory type. It consists in laying the foundation for 
what is to be learned through forecasting what will prob- 
ably be found true, by making, on the basis of established 
principles, a series of tentative deductions, afterward 
to be tested or verified. Thus in geography the climate 
of any region may be inferred from the conclusions drawn 
from the known influence of latitude, elevation, direction 
1See W. T. Harris, “Psychologic Foundations of Education,” “Logic 
of Sense Perception,” pp. 62-89. 
 
-P-A-G-E-134
124 SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN INSTRUCTION 
of winds, influence of ocean or mountains, etc. In like 
manner, we may infer what the industries of any given 
section of the country will be when we know what the 
environment of the people is, that is, what sources of power 
and of raw material they have, what the quality of their 
soil and the character of their climate are, what the general 
status of their civilization is, what markets they enjoy, 
and the like. Similarly we may anticipate what the 
results of national conflicts will be, by drawing inferences 
from our understanding of the conditions. Men usually 
forecast also the probable results of the observations and 
experiments they are about to make, for “anticipation 
forward points the view,” not only in the larger affairs 
of life, but also in the schoolroom. No one should be 
in doubt as to the general untrustworthiness of results so 
obtained, for unforeseen circumstances are likely to make 
the inference incorrect. All ‘such inferences must, of 
course, be rigidly tested by resort to the usual means for 
the determination of hypotheses ; namely, observation, and 
experiment; or in such cases as arise in history and geog- 
raphy, the authority of presumably trustworthy histori- 
ans or geographers. 
The usefulness of making such anticipatory inferences 
lies first in the interest aroused by the effort to forecast 
results by applying known principles, and then in the 
1See W. C. Bagley, “The Educative Process,” pp. 308-311, for 
examples of such anticipatory use of deduction in the elementary school. 
 
-P-A-G-E-135
  THE DEDUCTIVE APPROACH 125 
direction given to the mind by the effort. Such an antici- 
pation is a form of hypothesis suggested by previous 
experience, and can be used to advantage by the teacher 
for the purposes suggested; namely, the stimulation of 
interest and the direction of attention. Knowing the 
unstable condition of nitrogen compounds, the experi- 
menter may foresee and provide for possible explosions; 
having learned that aluminum has an extraordinary 
affinity for oxygen, the teacher may inquire what the action 
of powdered aluminum would be when mixed with oxide 
of iron under the influence of heat, and thus anticipate 
the surprising effect of such a mixture (called thermite) 
when chemical action is set up by the explosion of a little 
fulminate of mercury, or by being ignited by magnesium 
powder set off by a bit of magnesium ribbon. A few 
seconds suffice for producing molten iron of a very high 
temperature, the oxide of iron having given up to the 
powdered aluminum its oxygen and developed enough 
heat in the chemical action to produce the molten iron.* 
“Coming events cast their shadows before:” people 
busy themselves with forecasting the probable results of 
coming elections, the effects of new inventions, the con- 
sequences that may be expected to follow the establish- 
ment of new industries, or the promulgation of new

this case rust is a protection against rusting.
-P-A-G-E-136

policies, or the transformation to be brought about by 
new economic conditions. Examples are seen in pres- 
idential elections, the invention of the telegraphone, 
wireless telegraphy, the internal-combustion engine, the 
steam turbine, cotton-mills in the South, the destruction 
of the forests and the exhaustion of the coal supply, the 
effects of the Southern labor problem upon the prohibition 
of the liquor traffic, as well as the effect upon total absti- 
nence of the decision of great railroad companies to lay 
off first those who are addicted to the liquor habit, when 
reductions of the force are needed. The academic world 
recently surmised what the authorities of Swarthmore 
College would do, when offered a large bequest on condition 
of permanently abolishing all intercollegiate athletics. 
Some predictions were based upon hopes and prejudices, 
according as such athletics were favored or opposed, and 
some were based on more fundamental considerations, 
such as the moral right of one Board of Managers to 
decide for all time the policy of the college upon important 
matters. The bequest was finally declined on the ground 
that the Board of Managers had no such moral right. 
A method of thought of such universal use in the outside 
world is worthy of careful consideration in the teaching 
of youth. Patrick Henry exclaims, “I know of no way of 
judging f the future but by the past.”’ Not a very re- 
liable way, it may be urged, but such as it is it constitutes 
our chief means of utilizing history to forecast events,
-P-A-G-E-137
  
THE DEDUCTIVE APPROACH 127 
to warn of dangers, and to reveal opportunities. Con- 
sequently some preliminary training in anticipating the 
probable effects of a given set of historical conditions may 
well be a part of a good historical method. This can easily 
be applied in any situation through varying an actual 
condition by substituting another that might have taken 
its place. Thus, for example, what would have been the 
result if Louis XVI of France had granted a constitution 
and a real representative government to the people before 
the outbreak of the Revolution? if Charles I of England 
had met the situation in that country in a spirit of strict 
honesty and conciliation? if the United States government 
had offered to pay a just price for the liberation of every 
slave in the South, say in 1860? Or, looking to the future, 
what would now be the effect upon Russia if the Czar and 
the bureaucracy should abrogate enough arbitrary power 
to give that country a real representative government? 
In historical study, where the student has not instant access 
to the facts, but must search for them at some length,’ 
similar forecastings as to probable outcome are in order. 
Literature offers a good field for the exercise of the 
anticipatory judgment, since it is supposed to represent 
events and results, not so much as they are or were, but 
as they might have been or ought to be. In such matters, 
the student may well have a chance to try his ingenuity 
1 See Joseph E. Chamberlain, “Ifs of History,” Henry Altemus Coy 
Philadelphia, 1908. 
 
-P-A-G-E-138
  
  128 SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN INSTRUCTION 
and his ethical insight. Any literary work offers opportu- 
nities for such experiments, either by supposing a change 
in some essential part, or by varying the time and the place 
which furnish the setting for the piece, or, even without 
any such change, by supposing a different result to follow 
from the given combination of circumstances. What, for 
example, would have been the effect on the outcome of 
the “Merchant of Venice”? had Shylock yielded to Portia’s 
plea for mercy and had bid her destroy the bond? What, 
if the judge had condemned him to death? What, if the 
Prince of Morocco had chosen the right casket? Could 
Portia have extricated herself from her painful position 
as skilfully as she did Antonio from his? Can you 
suggest a better plan for Bassanio to get rid of his debts 
than to marry a rich wife? What would the modern 
woman have said when Bassanio chose the leaden casket ? 
In short, in literary study the student should not be denied 
the use of that power which Hamlet exercised when he 
exclaimed, “Oh my prophetic soul, my Uncle !” 
Having hit upon his grand generalization, namely, 
natural selection under the influence of the struggle for 
existence, the mind of Darwin leaped forward to a thou- 
sand surmises, anticipations of what he would find when 
the principle was applied, now in this, now in that direc- 
tion, so that from this one grand apperceptive basis, he 
was able to formulate a host of hypotheses concerning 
kindred phenomena. These hypotheses or anticipations
-P-A-G-E-139
  
RUwe ¥ Bee mie pea 
THE DEDUCTIVE APPROACH 129 
he was able at leisure to verify or show to be inadequate 
as the case might be. The road to similar exercises of 
this power on the part of the student has not yet been 
closed in the biological and other sciences. The applica- 
tion of tests to discover the elements of a chemical com- 
pound, so far as they are not controlled by a fixed routine, 
are of the nature of hypothetical anticipations. 
Discussion: — Illustrations of suitable opportunities for 
the use of anticipatory judgments on the part of students in 
(1) the various sciences, physics, chemistry, zodlogy, botany, 
physical geography; (2) literature; (3) history; (4) econom- 
ics; (§) artistic representation. 
2. Processes of Thought — Deduction 
40. The function of deduction proper is the explana- 
tion of facts or the proof of new propositions on the basis 
of causes, classifications, and generalizations already 
established. These may appear in the guise of axioms of 
thought; laws of cause and effect; of logical necessities; 
principles of grammar or ethics; theories and laws of 
mind, of physical and biological science and of human 
institutions, and the like. A teacher who thinks only of 
teaching a subject is as prone to deduction as the sparks 
to fly upward. The reason is not far to seek. So far as 
his class is concerned, the subject is a completed science. 
Its facts are well known, its generalizations well estab- 
lished and practically unquestioned. Why use indirec- 
K
-P-A-G-E-140
  130 SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN INSTRUCTION 
tion to find direction out? Why not impart the facts and 
laws quickly by authority, thus saving time and labor for 
all concerned? It is only when the chief function of 
teaching is seen to be to teach the subject to the student, 
that the universal validity of the deductive procedure is 
questioned. Nevertheless, life is short and art is long; 
furthermore, the student himself gradually acquires a 
knowledge of general principles which it were sheer waste 
not to use in the acquisition of new facts and insights. 
Just as every thinker utilizes his grasp of general prin- 
ciples to solve minor problems, so the student should 
likewise form the habit of relying on the basal principles 
of grammar, physics, chemistry, biology, economics, or 
ethics, which he has acquired, to clear up subordinate 
points that need explanation. The laws of mechanics 
will enable him to understand any machine; the principle 
of cross-fertilization makes clear the production of new 
and better varieties by plant breeding; the laws of gram- 
mar enable him to explain any given construction in litera- 
ture; a comprehension of mathematical axioms renders a 
geometrical proof easy to understand and possible to con- 
struct, and so on throughout the whole domain of knowl- 
edge. In this connection it should be noted that nearly 
all the explanations that intelligent adults give to children 
rest upon this deductive movement. “Why,” asks the 
lad, “do the flame and smoke go up the flue of the 
chimney?” “ Because,” replies the adult, in substance,
-P-A-G-E-141
1 
THE DEDUCTIVE APPROACH 131 
“air that is heated expands and, occupying more space, 
becomes lighter than the same volume of air by which it 
is surrounded. But the atmosphere being heavy enough 
to-press down everywhere with a weight of many pounds 
per square inch naturally presses the volume of air made 
lighter by heat up the chimney.” “If the rivers all run 
into the ocean, why does not the ocean overflow?” 
Then follows a description of evaporation, the formation 
and movement of clouds, the falling of rain, snow, etc.; in 
short, the forms and circulation of water are explained. 
In like manner adults explain to children all the simple 
phenomena by which they are surrounded — the boulders 
in the field; the ice on the pond; the heating, ventilating, 
and plumbing systems in the houses; the machines that 
are run by steam, gas, or electricity; why matches light; 
why gunpowder and dynamite explode; why boats float, 
etc. Were one asked, What, from the deductive stand- 
point, is the difference between nature study in the grades 
and natural science in the high school? the reply would be, 
In nature study we utilize generalizations well known to 
the teacher to explain the given phenomena, quite after 
the manner of home explanations; whereas in high-school 
science we try to establish and verify the laws themselves. 
In the first case established laws are used to explain the 
facts; in the second the facts are used to lead up to and 
verify the laws. The student should not jump to the con- 
clusion, however, that nature study consists wholly in ex-
-P-A-G-E-142
    132 SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN INSTRUCTION 
planations of the kind above described, for it has also an 
important experimental, observational, and inductive basis. 
Discussion: — Extent to which the nature-study method 
is desirable in the teaching of science in the high school. 
71. When its legitimate limit is passed, every method of 
teaching has its dangers and evils. The most imminent 
danger in the excessive use of the deductive method is 
that initiative, originality, and native thinking power, 
and the consequent intentness and alertness of mind that 
go with them, will become atrophied for lack of exercise, 
and that authority will be accepted for truth in the realm 
of fact, while formalism will take the place of spontaneity 
in reasoning. When such is the case thought is robbed of 
its vitality, and becomes not unlike that ascribed by a 
Swarthmore College student to the skeleton that hangs 
in a glass case in the biological museum: — 
“T think and I think, 
But I get nothing thunk.” 
To keep alive the native intellectual powers under the 
deductive method, the teacher of the natural sciences 
relies upon the adequate verification of the laws given at 
first upon the authority of the book or of himself. There 
is here scope for the scientific stages of observation and 
experiment and some room also for the drawing of new 
inferences. Here again, however, scientific men utter a 
word of caution, for the student, knowing what he is ex- 
pected to prove, becomes greatly biassed in his observations
-P-A-G-E-143
  Bee ee He ‘ 
THE DEDUCTIVE APPROACH 133 
and inferences. Furthermore, if he trusts the authority 
that gave him his principle, he is likely to exclaim, ‘‘ What’s 
the use of trying to verify a proposition of which I am 
already absolutely sure?”? His work becomes perfunc- 
tory, and observations are interpreted not for what they 
actually reveal, but according to the results expected. 
Thus the scientific spirit is paralyzed in the house of its 
friends... The same effect is produced, of course, when a 
student is asked to demonstrate by long inductive process 
that a given principle of the text-book is true. If, how- 
ever, the student is in some doubt as to what the end of 
his induction is to be, or tries his verification to see if a 
given principle will hold when applied in a new way, then 
the effort seems worth while, and the student is likely to 
work with interest and ardor, rather than with passive 
indifference. Upon one thing all thinkers seem resolved, 
no matter in what domain of thought they may work, and 
that is, that the intellectual world shall never again settle 
into the dogmatic complacency that characterized it dur- 
ing the scholastic age, when men forgot to ask whether 
the premises from which they reasoned were true and ade- 
quate, or whether anything new might ‘be learned by first- 
hand observation and experiment concerning the men and 
things about them. The same resolution should animate 
the school. Dogmatic complacency is a deplorable state 
1 Compare Edwin H. Hall (Smith & Hall), “The Teaching of Chem- 
istry and Physics,” pp. 274-288. Longmans, Green & Co., N.Y. 
 
-P-A-G-E-144
  134 SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN INSTRUCTION 
for even adults to be in; for youth it is intolerable. Youth 
is naturally buoyant, hopeful, curious, daring, inventive, 
inquiring; and every true teacher will desire to stimulate, 
develop, and guide these tendencies to fruitful ends, not 
to hypnotize them into quiescence by the baleful eye of 
authority. 
Notwithstanding their shortcomings as a universal 
method, deductive processes have ever been and perhaps 
will ever be the main reliance of the schoolmaster in the 
training of youth. The greatest educational triumphs of 
the past have been achieved by the aid of this method, 
for it is almost the inevitable way in which demonstra- 
tive mathematics must be studied, and it has been the 
favorite, and in essential respects the necessary, method 
of linguistic training. 
Discussion: —1. Means of preventing a mere perfunctory 
use of observation, experiment, and verification in the natural 
sciences. 2. Means of preventing growth of dogmatic com- 
placency arising from undue reliance upon authority as the 
basis of explanation and argument. 
42. It is always declared, but not always convincingly 
shown, that mathematics, especially geometry, is a 
deductive science. To convince the student that this is 
true, and that deductive methods must sooner or later 
be used in order to get the legitimate results of mathe- 
matical training, the following citations from DeMorgan 
are made.’ After contrasting the probable character 
1 “The Study and Difficulties of Mathematics,” pp. 4-10.
-P-A-G-E-145
  THE DEDUCTIVE APPROACH 135 
of historical evidence with the convincing certainty of 
that of mathematics, he continues as follows: “We have 
said that the nature of mathematical demonstration is 
totally different from all other, and the difference con- 
sists in this — that instead of showing the contrary of a 
proposition asserted to be only improbable, it proves it at 
once to be absurd and impossible. This is done by show- 
ing that the contrary of a proposition which is asserted is 
in direct contradiction to some extremely evident fact of 
the truth of which our eyes and hands convince us. In 
geometry, of the principles alluded to, those which are 
most commonly used are: — 
“yt, If a magnitude be divided into parts, the whole is 
greater than either of those parts. 
“2, Two straight lines cannot inclose a space. 
“3. Through one point only one straight line can be 
drawn, which never meets another straight line, or which 
is parallel to it. 
“Tt is on such principles as these that the whole of geom- 
etry is founded, and the demonstration of every proposi- 
tion consists in proving the contrary of it to be inconsis- 
tent with one of these. 
“But, although there is no other study which presents 
so simple a beginning as that of geometry, there is none in 
which the difficulties grow more rapidly as we proceed, 
and what may appear at first as rather paradoxical, the 
more acute the student the more serious will the impedi- 
 
-P-A-G-E-146
136 SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN INSTRUCTION 
ments in the way of his progress appear. This necessa- 
tily follows in a science which consists of reasoning from 
the very commencement, for it is evident that every student 
will feel a claim to have his objections answered, not by 
authority, but by argument, and that the intelligent stu- 
dent will perceive more readily than another the force of 
an objection and the obscurity arising from an unex- 
plained difficulty, as the greater is the ordinary light the 
more will occasional darkness be felt. 
“Mathematics are peculiarly well adapted for this pur- 
pose (training the powers of deductive reasoning), on the 
following grounds: — 
“ty, Every term is distinctly explained, and has but 
one meaning, and it is rarely that two words are employed 
to mean the same thing. 
“2, The first principles are self-evident, and, though 
derived from observation, do not require more of it than 
has been made by children in general. 
“3. The demonstration is strictly logical, taking noth- 
ing for granted except the self-evident first principles, 
resting nothing upon probabilities, and entirely indepen- 
dent of authority and opinion. 
“4. When the conclusion is attained by reasoning, its 
truth or falsehood can be ascertained, in geometry by 
actual measurement, in algebra by common arithmetical 
calculation. 
“5. There are no words whose meanings are so much 
   
-P-A-G-E-147
  THE DEDUCTIVE APPROACH 137 
alike that the ideas which they stand for may be con- 
founded. Between the meanings of terms there is no 
distinction, except a total distinction, and all adjectives 
and adverbs expressing difference of degrees are avoided.” 
From the foregoing remarks it may easily be seen that 
geometry begins with axioms for the basis of its arguments, 
and that as the subject unfolds, propositions once estab- 
lished on the basis of axioms become in turn the premises 
from which further deductions are made, and so on 
through all the geometrical propositions undertaken by 
the student, who has ever the consciousness that if the 
validity of any previous proposition he uses is questioned, 
it may be led back directly to those fundamental percep- 
tions of truth with which he started. In algebra, the 
reasoning has the same axiomatic basis, for in an equation 
where one side is numerically equal to the other, any 
operation may be performed which does not contradict 
any of these axioms, which usually pertain to additions to, 
subtractions from, or multiplication or division of, equals. 
Besides, as DeMorgan says, the results may be tested by 
arithmetical computations. As was explained in Section 
62, the only inductive approach possible in mathematics 
is that which consists in anticipating general demonstra- 
tions by specific ones. This is legitimate and highly use- 
ful as an introduction, but in the end a student either 
comprehends a deductive demonstration, or he has not 
touched the heart of mathematics.
-P-A-G-E-148
  138 SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN INSTRUCTION 
Discussion: — Means of introducing students to a clear 
conception of what is and what is not a demonstration. 
73. Teachers should not delude themselves with the 
notion that when they have asked a student to read and 
reproduce a demonstration in geometry they have really 
given him exercise in deductive thinking, for the simple 
fact is, that the thought is the author’s, not the student’s. 
One procedure of this nature is to require the student 
thus to read and reproduce all the demonstrations given 
in the book. If he have a good memory and is able to 
perceive the force of the argument, he may undoubtedly 
gain a good deal of geometrical knowledge and insight. 
The opposite plan, and the one usually followed in German 
schools, is to place no completed demonstrations whatever 
before the student, but to assign the proposition, ask a 
few questions about it to set him on the right track, and 
require him to work it out for himself. A third plan com- 
bines the first two, in that a certain number of funda- 
mental theorems are given in full by the author, read and 
reproduced by the student, who then proceeds to do some 
geometrizing on his own account by solving a number of 
‘originals’ containing variations of the type proposition. 
Judiciously used, this plan is in general by far the best of 
the three mentioned, for it gives scope for real work on 
the part of the student while at the same time keeping him 
in close touch with demonstrations of unquestioned valid- 
ity. It takes a teacher unusually well versed in geomet-
-P-A-G-E-149
THE DEDUCTIVE APPROACH 139 
rical reasoning to pursue the second plan with the best 
results, for unless the student’s thought is held rigidly to 
real demonstration, much loose thinking and many bad 
habits of thought are engendered. Where a dozen forms 
of proof are handed in at one time, only the expert geome- 
trician can at once say what is logically correct and what 
fallacious. 
In assisting students to do real thinking in geometry, 
a number of the aspects of the problem should be held 
constantly before the mind, especially the following: — 
1. What is given and what to prove in this proposition ? 
2. How construct a figure that will give a clew to the 
solution ? 
3. What equalities (or inequalities) must be proved in 
order to demonstrate the proposition ? 
4. How can we use our axioms or previous propositions 
to prove these equalities (or inequalities) ? 
For illustration, take a very simple proposition: — 
In any triangle, any exterior angle equals the sum of the 
two interior non-adjacent angles. 
1, Given the triangle ABC, with side AB produced to 
X to show an exterior c 
A ye 
ee A Aw 4 B angle, the proposition 
being that angle CBX 
equals the sum of an-      x 
gles a and c. 
2. How construct a figure that will give a clew to the
-P-A-G-E-150

solution? It will quickly occur to some student that 
since the exterior angle is equal to two others (a and ¢) 
it may be possible to divide it into two parts, one of 
which shall be equal to a, and the other to c. How can 
this be done? Think of a previous construction in which 
c would be equal to a certain other angle. How then shall 
we draw the new line that is to divide the exterior angle? 
Parallel to AC. 
3. What equalities appear? Angle x is equal to angle 
c, because (4) alternate angles formed by a transversal 
with two parallels are equal (previous proposition). 
What other angles must be equal, if the proposition is 
true? Angle y must be equal to angle a. Is it? Yes, 
(4) because a line cutting two parallels makes correspond- 
ing angles equal (previous proposition). 
4. What follows? That angle CBX equals the sum 
of the two interior non-adjacent angles (axiom).

of rhetoric and argumentation or dialectics, are first com- 
prehended and learned, and then deductively applied in 
translation and composition in order to make out or ex- 
press meaning.’ Even if the principles of grammar were 
all inductively derived in the first place, they would have 
to be used deductively in translation, since meaning 
depends on construction, and this in foreign languages is 
usually determined by grammatic form: Puer puellam 
amat, or Puellam puer amat, or Amat puer puellam, etc. 
The order is much less elastic in English where inflectional 
forms have disappeared and the grammatical construction 
of a word can be determined only by the meaning of the 
sentence. Here the process is still deductive, as when we 
say, this noun is in the objective case, because it names 
the receiver of an action, instead of the usual opposite 
statement, — this noun names the receiver of an action, 
because it has the form of the accusative. The fact that 
English is now so little modified by inflection has led not 
a few authors and more teachers to present grammar, not 
so much for the aid it gives in comprehension and compo- 
sition, as an end in itself. The subject is taught until its 
distinctions are understood, and then having been ‘learned’ 
is dropped. It can hardly be asserted that such a pro- 
cedure is valueless, but it may be confidently asserted that 
it is comparatively so. The chief disciplinary effect re- 
   * Compare Vol. I of this work, “Function and Worth of Linguistics,” 
PP. 97-119.
-P-A-G-E-152
  142 SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN INSTRUCTION 
sulting from the teaching of foreign languages arises, not 
so much from the fact that a few distinctions have been 
comprehended, as that they have been deductively used in 
translation of thousands of pages of classic writings. It 
is in this way that there is effected the introspective train- 
ing of the mind, first to perceive and then to express all 
the shades of meaning language can embody. The mod- 
ern youth’s grandfathers had a better linguistic training in 
English than he now enjoys, for whereas the youth applies 
his morsel of grammar to scraps of literature, the grand- 
father parsed Milton’s “Paradise Lost” and Pope’s 
“Essay on Man,” entire. The one takes his grammar 
like a pill, to be swallowed and thus made an end of; the 
other used his as a means of unlocking the intellectual 
treasures of grand systems of thought. Both plans use 
the deductive movement, the one effectively and the 
other ineffectively. It is not to be inferred that we must 
do just as our grandfathers did, but only that whenever 
means are transformed into ends, such ends are hardly 
worth striving for. 
In translation, every sentence becomes a problem, and if 
it chances to be a difficult one, many are the hypotheses 
that must be proposed, examined, and rejected before the 
right ones are hit upon and the meaning revealed. The 
form of a word suggests a given construction. An hypoth- 
esis may be instantly formed on this basis, only perhaps 
1 See discussion in Vol. I of this work, pp. 111-114.

  THE DEDUCTIVE APPROACH 143 
to be as quickly rejected, because of some obvious diffi- 
culty. Again, a guess at the meaning will indicate that a 
certain word is an accusative, which may be tested at 
once by a glance at the word. 
Willmann* thus sums up the elements of instruction 
by the teacher and of study by the student in the teaching 
of foreign languages: — 
1. Preparation. — a. Hints by the teacher for the stu- 
dent’s preparation. 6. Preparatory study. c. Discussion 
of the text by the teacher. 
2. Translation. —a. Translation of the text by a 
student. 06. Corrections of the same by fellow-students 
and teacher. c. Explanations, mostly of logical and lin- 
guistic character, of what is presented directly by the 
text. d. Corrected translation by teacher and students, 
or by students only. 
3. Elaboration of the text.—a. Explanation of facts, 
references, etc., presented by the author. 6. Bringing 
out of the ethical content. c. Explanations of linguistic 
technique (poetics, rhetoric). d. Fixing in mind the lin- 
guistic results of the lesson (onomatopceia, grammar). 
e. The results of composition (phraseology, style). 
While much of the above program of exercises pertains 
to the giving or getting of facts, not a little of the work of 
study on the part of the students and of explanation on the 
part of the teacher is of a deductive nature, as, for example, 
1 “Didaktik,” Vol. II, p. 415. 
 
-P-A-G-E-154
  144 SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN INSTRUCTION 
when the rules of poetics, grammar, rhetoric, etc., are 
given as a basis for the conclusions reached. 
That there is an important esthetic element present in 
the translation of literary masterpieces which has little to 
do with deductive processes is obvious. Only indirectly 
dé rational processes lay the foundation for such apprecia- 
tion, in that they apply whatever canons of literary art the 
class may have become possessed of in the course of their 
study. The most prominent characteristic of literary, as 
of all other art, is its freedom from limits. In general, it 
is restless under any attempt to confine it by rules, for it 
is impossible to tell beforehand just what combinations 
will be thought beautiful. It is probable that were a 
strict set of rules prescribed for literary production, some 
author would successfully violate them all, for art is 
continually changing, developing, adjusting itself to the 
spirit of the age or the sciences of humanity. A feeling 
of beauty with respect to any literary product, however, 
necessarily passes over into a judgment of beauty. s- 
thetic judgment is therefore the correlative of esthetic 
appreciation and is consequently implicit in all minds 
capable of esthetic feeling. The literary artist helps it 
into light. But while esthetic feeling is creative in its 
nature, impelling to action, taste is critical and follows 
art. Taste attempts to say in general what is beautiful, 
what ugly, and hence to become a guide to artistic appre- 
ciation. It can judge, however, only by what has been
-P-A-G-E-155
  THE DEDUCTIVE APPROACH 145 
produced. ®stheticism in literature is not love of beauty, 
but love of the pleasures of beauty. Freely indulged in, 
as in excessive novel reading, it leads to loss of freshness, 
healthiness, and vitality of esthetic feeling.1 The method 
for acquiring zsthetic appreciation is emotional rather 
than intellectual, though it must always be recognized 
that there is an intellectual basis to all art. We learn to 
appreciate by contemplation, by direct observation and 
insight, by looking for what we are told is there, and 
especially by oral reading. The voice is to literature 
almost what the eye is to painting and sculpture, for it is 
the organ through which the race first learned to appre- 
ciate literary masterpieces since they were recited long be- 
fore they were written. This must not be taken to be an 
approval of the exclamatory method of exciting admira- 
tion, for such raptures are usually confined to the teacher, 
finding small response in the student. But a masterful, 
beautiful, and appreciative reading of the text under 
favorable circumstances is almost sure to awaken a cor- 
responding appreciation in the student.’ 
Translation as a method in linguistic study has another 
side, which will be taken up under the head of applica- 
tion, in the succeeding chapter.

be lost were translation as a set exercise abandoned? 3. Are 
the ancient and the modern languages on the same plane 
with respect to translation ? 
75. It has already been shown above that deductive 
inference is common in historical anticipation. Though 
it be denied that history yields generalizations which are 
both true and impottant, and hence in any specific sense 
furnishes a guide’to the future, yet here as elsewhere deduc- 
tive application of causes ‘once established as facts may 
be and is freely used. This, much early American history 
becomes intelligible when it is once understood that the 
permanent motives of the French in settling and ruling 
North America were of the type that belong to a militant 
monarchy, where there is absolute subjection of political 
and religious individualism; whereas, the motives of the 
English, on the other hand, were primarily industrial and 
individualistic. When Louis XIV sent word to Canada 
that all heresy must be ruthlessly stamped out, the gov- 
ernor could exclaim with a pious ejaculation, “There is 
not a hetetic i in all Canada!’! These motives become 
causes of action with the respective parties, and serve to 
explain many deeds and states of feeling, otherwise inex- 
plicable. , In like manner the objective purposes of a war, 
a campaign, or a battle, serve to explain the actions of an 
army. When, for illustration, Grant became commander- 
in-chief during the Civil War, the campaigns in both

South and East were pushed simultaneously with equal 
vigor in order, for one thing, to prevent the transfer of 
Confederate forces, now from East to South, now from 
South to East, as the exigencies of the situation might 
demand. 
On the whole, however, the contingent, or probable, 
reasoning of history is concerned ‘primarily with the 
investigations of causes and effects of specific actions, and 
only secondarily with the application of principles to 
explain or forecast events. The use of deduction in appli- 
cation will be treated in the next chapter. 
Discussion: — Comparison of all three modes of thinking 
in history: (1) Causal investigation; (2) Inductive approach 
to generalization; (3) Deductive use of principles: (a) for 
anticipation, (b) for gaining new insight. 
76. The natural sciences, especially those of a mathe- 
matical or semi-mathematical nature, yield much more 
readily to deductive treatment ‘than ‘do history and 
literature. Indeed, it may be said that in physics, at 
least, the prevailing custom of authors has been to 
present principles first, and then, after more or less 
earnest efforts to verify them, to make deductive use 
of them to explain the phenomena -with which the 
subject deals. In botany, classifications already estab- 
lished are used deductively to identify new specimens, 
while in the larger aspects of biology, broad general- 
‘
-P-A-G-E-158
  148 SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN INSTRUCTION 
ization once derived serves to point the way to new 
investigations or to clear up matters that had for- 
merly been open to more or less surmise. 
Deductive methods found useful in physics and biology 
serve, with more or less modification, equally well in the 
other natural sciences. By way of summary, it may be 
said that the laboratory, or experimental, method of 
teaching natural science has at least three prominent 
aspects. The first of these uses observation and ex- 
periment to lead up inductively to causes or effects, 
to classifications, or to generalizations. The second uses 
observation and experiment to verify general principles 
which are stated authoritatively at the outset, in order 
to convince the student through his own investigation that 
they are true, but chiefly, it would appear, to fix them more 
vividly in his mind. Finally, the principles so presented 
and so verified are then used deductively to explain the 
facts and subordinate principles of the science.~ The third 
purpose of the laboratory method is to make the student 
  
    efficient in the use of the knowledge thus gained. This 
aspect will be treated under the head of application.   
Discussion: — The comparative serviceability of the de- 
ductive method of gaining new knowledge in: (1) physics and 
chemistry; (2) botany and geology; (3) physical geography 
and geology; (4) physiology and hygiene.

{ 
PROCESSES OF APPLICATION—INDUCTION AND 
DEDUCTION 
77. Why does a scientific method in the schoolroom 
call for a special department of ‘Application,’ when this 
is lacking in the methodic processes of the outside world ? 
A number of reasons growing out of the conditions discussed 
in Sections 44, 45, and 46 may be given. First, owing to 
the rapidity of the student’s survey of race acquisitions, his 
knowledge is likely to be attenuated and meagre, if he but 
touches the generalizations, classifications, and causes 
involved as he flits along the panorama unfolded by his 
studies. He must pause, consider, test, and apply his new- 
found insight, if it is to have any richness of content. One 
reason why the old linguistic and literary training as the 
sole subject of education satisfied the educational world 
for so many centuries, was because in this field at least 
the content was rich and full, every principle having a 
thousand-fold application to appropriate subject-matter. 
However rich in content, however closely related to the 
life of the people, modern studies may seem, they will 
never permanently satisfy the demands of education 
until they, like classics and mathematics, also enrich the 
150

  PROCESSES OF APPLICATION I51 
mind each in its own way with the associations and 
direct applications that can come only from this aspect 
of the teaching process. 
Second, that which is learned in skeletonized form has 
but a transient hold upon the mind. Like a high-potential 
abstraction in metaphysics to the ordinary man, a prin- 
ciple of human or natural science apprehended merely 
by a fleeting glance soon takes its place among that host 
of vague impressions which, though possibly recognized 
when mentioned, perform no useful function in actual 
mental life. It is the application of principles that gives 
them substance, concrete embodiment, and thus makes 
them permanent dwellers in the mind, not mere transient 
visitors. A stage of application is needed, therefore, to 
secure permanence of acquisition. 
The third and most important reason why a department 
of application is needed in the teaching of any subject, 
arises from the reciprocal relation of insight and efficiency. 
What indeed shall it profit a man though he gain the whole 
world of knowledge and be not able to use it? That is 
truly useless knowledge which cannot be used. Educa- 
tion as revelation gives insight; education as application 
gives efficiency. The one is as necessary as the other; they 
are the two poles of the magnet, the two blades of the 
shears, the two parents of the child. Without either the 
other loses its significance. The intellectual mastery of 
knowledge gives us social instruments; its continuous 
 
-P-A-G-E-162
eee ee ger ee | 
152 | SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN INSTRUCTION 
application to its manifold uses gives power to use the 
instruments effectively in society. The importance and 
reciprocal nature of insight and efficiency are discussed 
from another standpoint in the first volume.* 
78. To place this stage of application in still another 
light, two views in education may here be contrasted, 
though in practice they always blend in varying proportions. 
They are the psychological and the social. The psycho- 
logical aspect of education pertains to the development of 
the individual as such. It is interested in his personal 
culture, his mental discipline, his acquisitions, his physical 
perfection, without direct reference to society in any of 
its numerous forms. The microcosm occupies the whole 
field of vision for one who contemplates education from 
the psychological standpoint alone. The social view of 
education contemplates the individual from the standpoint 
of his relations to his fellows in their various groupings, 
civic, religious, educational, economic, family, or social 
in the restricted sense. The psychologist in education is 
interested in mental development. He lays the emphasis 
on the subjective aspect of studies, their effect upon mem- 
ory, imagination, emotion, reason, and volition, in short 
their value for culture and discipline. He emphasizes the 
methods that rouse and interest the student, making him 
use his whole mind as he acquires and thinks, and he re- 
gards those subjects as best in education that are most 
1 Ch, V, pp. 162-192. 
 
-P-A-G-E-163
  
PROCESSES OF APPLICATION 153 
susceptible to this form of treatment; or if he takes a 
broader view, he recommends a combination of studies 
that shall give an adequate training in every prominent 
type of mental endowment. It is the psychologist who 
protests against what he calls the (base) utilitarian in 
education, who says that all school subjects, even manual 
training and domestic science, shall be purely ‘general,’ 
in that they but present various ways of training the mind; 
who protests that all vocational training is narrow and 
special, and can be thought of only when the long period 
of general, or disciplinary training is rounded out and 
complete, presumably eight years from the beginning of 
the high-school period. There is validity in these conten- 
tions, and much can be, as much has been, said in their 
behalf; but they constitute only one side of the shield. 
The sociologist in education, on the other hand, while 
he too contemplates the individual, thinks of him as per- 
forming or preparing to perform his various functions in 
society. Instead of emphasizing a subjective mental 
discipline in the school, the sociologist lays stress upon the 
acquisition of skill that conduces to efficiency in the use of 
what is learned. Instead of choosing subjects that lend 
themselves easily to certain methods of mental training, 
he selects rather the subjects that relate most nearly to 
the forms of social efficiency he most highly regards. In 
short, while the psychologist urges insight and mental 
discipline, the sociologist urges useful knowledge and 
 
-P-A-G-E-164
  154 SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN INSTRUCTION 
trained efficiency. It is, of course, well known that all 
our great thinkers in education like Pestalozzi, Herbart, 
Froebel, Huxley, Harris, Hall, and Dewey combine, with 
varying emphasis to be sure, these two aspects of educa- 
tional theory. These contrasts go to show, not only the 
great importance of making the training in efficency a 
prominent part of all high-school methods, but they reveal 
also the widely varying application of the term. In the 
one case it may mean anything that contributes to personal 
development as such, whether in volitional, rational, or 
esthetic relations, and in the other it may include the power 
to use knowledge effectively in any or all of the groups that 
constitute institutional life, political, social, or economic. 
The following quotation from Karl Pearson ‘ contrasts 
the individualistic and the social views from another 
standpoint: “TI fancy science will ultimately balance the 
individualistic and the socialistic? tendencies in evolution 
better than Haeckel and Spencer seem to have done. The 
power of the individualistic formula to describe human 
growth has been overrated, and the evolutionary origin 
of the socialistic instinct has been too frequently over- 
looked. In the face of the’ severe struggle, physical, and 
commercial, the fight for land, for food, and for mineral 
wealth between existing nations, we have every need to

2 “Socialistic” is here used in its broad sense, and does not refer to 
what is known as socialism.
-P-A-G-E-165
  PROCESSES OF APPLICATION 155 
strengthen by training the partially dormant socialistic 
spirit, if we as a nation are to be among the surviving fit 
(hence the present forceful movement in England and 
America for all sorts of industrial education). The im- 
portance of organizing society, of making the individual 
subservient to the whole, grows from the intensity of the 
struggle. We shall need all our clearness of vision, all 
our reasoned insight into human growth and social effi- 
ciency in order to discipline the powers of labor, to train 
and educate the powers of mind. This organization and 
education must largely proceed from the state, for it is in 
the battle of society with society, rather than of individual 
with individual, that these weapons are of service. Here 
it is that science relentlessly proclaims: A nation needs 
not only a few prize individuals; it needs a finely regulated 
social system — of which the members as a whole respond 
to each external stress by organized reaction — if it is to 
survive in the struggle for existence.” 
Discussion: — Contrast between the social and the psy- 
chological aspects of the educational theories of: 1. Pestalozzi; 
2. Herbart; 3. Froebel; 4. Huxley; 5. Harris; 6. Hall; 
7. Dewey. 
79. The forms which application may take are almost 
as numerous as the studies themselves and the purposes 
for which they are taught. Application is a stage, now for 
wide survey, as in the tracing of historical causes and 
effects or the results of economic law, the universal sweep 
 
-P-A-G-E-166
  156 SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN INSTRUCTION 
of a principle of conduct, or a generalization in evolution; 
now for drill upon essentials, translation of foreign lan- 
guages, the construing of words, oral and written composi- 
tion, or laboratory, class-room, and workroom practice in 
general. : 
An argument is made in Volume I* to show that not 
only should the stage of application be recognized in prin- 
ciple, but that a special laboratory, workroom, or other 
appropriate place should be provided for each department 
of school study —the mathematical, the literary, the his- 
torical and geographical, no less than the scientific, the in- 
dustrial and the artistic. The laboratory or workroom is 
now a recognized necessity in biology, physics and chem- 
istry, manual training and domestic science, drawing and 
music, also for commercial courses and physical training. 
It is only formally lacking for languages and literature, 
and for history, civics, geography, and economics. Even 
here some provision is made, for to a considerable extent 
the library is the true laboratory for certain aspects of these 
subjects, and some schools have a laboratory for geography. 
So nearly universal is the recognition of the value of the 
laboratory, or workroom idea in the realization of the 
efficiency that should be made to accompany insight, that 
the modern high-school teacher should always seek to 
1See “The Twofold Aspect of all School Studies,” pp. 162-172, and

-P-A-G-E-167
  
  PROCESSES OF APPLICATION 157 
secure its advantages, even if to do so he must from time 
to time transform his recitation room into a laboratory. 
Among the most familiar and most practised forms of 
application as a stage of method are those almost uni- 
versally used in teaching mathematics and languages. 
Authority, observation, and experiment, here as elsewhere, 
furnish the data; inductive or deductive reasoning leads 
to their comprehension in the form of definition, cause, 
classification, or of generalization as seen in theorem, rule, 
formula, principle, or law; while application tests these 
conclusions on new data, and extends them to a multi- 
tude of new cases, thus greatly enriching the content of 
knowledge, strengthening the grasp upon fundamentals, 
and, most important of all, lifting insight to the plane of 
efficiency. 
The idea that education is a true preparation for life 
only as it enables the student to participate in the life of 
his age and environment is now accepted in principle, 
however sadly it may fail in practice. The old notion was 
that real life and school life are necessarily disparate, much 
as Earth is sundered from Heaven; that by a rigid mental 
discipline on subjects which to the student were almost 
purely abstract, he could be best prepared to meet the exi- 
gencies of that ‘life’ which he was by and by to enter. 
This doctrine has ever been the final defence for lost or 
losing causes. It supplied the argument for scholasticism 
when it was being displaced by humanism; for classicism 
 
-P-A-G-E-168
  158 SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN INSTRUCTION 
when it was encroached upon by mathematics; for classics 
combined with mathematics when modern languages and 
natural science demanded a part of the student's time; 
for ‘general’? mental discipline when manual training 
knocked at the door of the schoolroom; and now echoes 
of its protest are heard when vocational and industrial 
training in general are proposed, that education may once 
more prepare the student for life by making him even dur- 
ing his school days a true participant in it. In all genuine 
education, mental discipline, like culture itself, is a neces- 
sary concomitant. ‘Algebra conquers adipose;”’ geome- 
try necessitates clear thought; to comprehend a play of 
Shakespeare is to rise to higher levels of insight and 
feeling; to master a law of nature elevates both mind and 
heart. We need not fear that education animated by 
living, vital, urgent motives will lack any of the gocd 
characteristics naturally inhering in the mastery of a sys- 
tem of thought. So far from lacking any of them, it will 
rather add new ones, and will throw over all a charm as 
old as life itself, of which it is begot. 
The laboratory, the shop, the workroom, is at once the 
vestibule of the school and the anteroom to factory, count- 
ing-room and office.’ It is a place where the noise, bustle, 
and urgent purpose of the one may enter, without destroy- 
ing the opportunity for the mental operations of the other. 
In it the student may share in the thought-life of the

outer world, may reproduce its activities, without being 
swept into the whirl of competition or having his ener 
gies narrowed to a single channel by the pressure of 
economic necessity. In the workroom, the inner life may 
come into touch with the outer, share in its motives, and 
be quickened into vitality by its influence, without being 
diverted from its leading purposes, which are mental 
growth, ethical development, and practical efficiency. 
Discussion: — Phases of outside life to which each of the 
high-school studies is vocationally most closely related. 
80. Translation as an exercise in application gives con- 
stant practice in applying the known laws of grammar and 
rhetoric to the foreign text. It renders the mind quick to 
see and appreciate not only broad but also subtle distinc- 
tions of thought. Its constant practice of requiring ade- 
quate English terms to express the thought of the author 
enriches the diction of the student at a rapid rate. It is 
a common observation that a classical scholar never lacks 
for words to express his ideas. Whatever advantages 
there may be in translation are accented and multiplied 
and rendered permanent by the iteration of years. But 
by the same token, its faults are likely to have a like endur- 
ing quality. If it permits slipshod ‘translation English’ 
in which native is subordinated to foreign idiom; if it 
tends to the decay of original thought through devotion 
to the thought of others; if it turns the mind permanently
-P-A-G-E-170
  160 SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN INSTRUCTION 
to bygone events having small relation to the present, 
then its unquestioned advantages in producing the liber- 
ated tongue, are offset by a formidable list of actual dis- 
advantages, to say nothing of a possible waste of time and 
mental effort. The maxim of the Latin teacher should be: 
through Latin to English; through ancient to modern life. 
Every writer on the art of translation protests vigorously 
against that ‘jargon’ which so easily besets the student as 
he tries to render in comprehensible English the meaning 
of the foreign text. Thus Wilhelm Miinch in his Kunst 
des Ueberseizens aus dem Franzéssischen, says, “There has 
arisen in translation a jargon which advances in an inflexible 
armor that is peculiarly foreign.” ‘It behooves every 
teacher of the classics,” says Lattmann, “to banish this 
‘school jargon.’ ”” 
The nature of the training for efficiency that comes   
      
from translation is vividly presented in the following cita- 
tions from authors who have written upon this topic. 
Here is a voice that comes down to us from a hundred 
years ago,’ telling us the essentials of good work in transla- 
tion: “I would describe a good translation to be that in 
which the merit of the original work is so completely trans- 
fused into another language as to be as distinctly appre- 
hended, and as strongly felt, by a native of the country 
to which that language belongs, as it is by those who speak 
the language of the original work. Now, supposing this

PROCESSES OF APPLICATION 161 
description to be a just one, which I think it is, let us exam- 
ine what are the laws of translation which may be deduced 
from it. It will follow: — 
“1, That the translation should give a complete tran- 
script of the ideas of the original work. 
“2, That the style and manner of writing should be of 
the same character with that of the original. 
“3, That the translation should have all the ease of 
original composition.” 
Tolman,’ in his “Art of Translating,” a work based upon 
Cauer’s Die Kunst des Uebersetzens, quotes approvingly 
the following paragraph from his master: “A double task 
confronts the translator; first the language with which he 
translates must be genuine living English, not an artificial 
Grecized or Latinized English; else how can it come near 
to our feelings? In the second place, the peculiar style 
of the old poet or author must be preserved. Homer 
must be translated into different English from Virgil, 
Tacitus from Cicero. For the first task the translator 
must have mastery over his own language. For the sec- 
ond, the translator must breathe the spirit of his author 
and from that standpoint build his English sentence.” 
Concerning the function of Latin translation as a 
training in English, Bennett? writes as follows: —

   162 SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN INSTRUCTION 
“First and foremost, I should say Latin is of value be- 
cause it confers a. mastery over the resources of one’s 
mother-tongue. This mastery is the direct and necessary 
result of careful daily translation, —a process involving 
on the one hand a careful consideration and analysis of 
the thought of the author read, and on the other a severe 
and laborious comparison of the value of alternative 
English words, phrases, and sentences, with the consequent 
attainment of skill in making the same effective as vehicles 
of expression. ... Translation is a severe exercise. 
The lexicon or vocabulary tells the meaning of words, the 
grammar states the force of inflected forms; but it is only 
after the pupil, provided with this equipment, has attacked 
his Latin sentence with a view to translation that the real 
struggle begins. His vocabulary has given him a dozen or 
even twenty meanings under a single verb or noun, and 
the pupil must reflect and nicely discriminate before he 
can choose the right word, the one just suited to the context. 
Further, his Latin sentence may be long, complex, and 
periodic, entirely different from anything we know in 
English, Such a sentence must be broken up and so 
arranged as to conform to our English mode of expression; 
or the Latin sentence may have one of those Protean abla- 
tive absolutes, —an idiom that our English style prac- 
tically abhors. Every such ablative absolute has to be 
examined with care prior to an English rendering. It may 
express time, cause, concession, condition, attendant cir- 
 
-P-A-G-E-173

cumstance, means, or what not, and must be rendered 
accordingly. Again, the Latin sentence may secure by its 
arrangement of words certain effects of emphasis which 
English can bring out only by the employment of very 
different resources.” 
From the foregoing exposition and quotations it is suffi- 
ciently apparent that practice in translation, an art ap- 
proved for many centuries by nearly all teachers of lan- 
guage, isa significant form of application, serving several 
purposes, chief of which are: (1) drill in the use of lin- 
guistic rules and principles, and (2) practice in varied and 
facile use of the mother-tongue. 
Discussion: —1. How best prevent the habit of using 
‘jargon’ English in translation. 2. Possibility of securing 
equivalent training in the application of grammar and rhetoric 
without translation. 
8x. The art of composition in foreign languages belongs 
almost entirely to the stage of application, whether with 
Bennett we conceive this exercise to be a drill in grammar, 
or whether, as in the modern foreign languages, we con- 
ceive the purpose of the composition to be facility in the 
use of the language as a means of expression and intér- 
communication. 
Bennett says: “What, then, is the purpose and function 
of Latin composition in the school? So far as reason and 
experience enable me to judge, the study of Latin com- 
position is primarily intended to increase the accuracy,  
-P-A-G-E-174
  164 SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN INSTRUCTION 
breadth, and certainty of the pupil’s grammatical knowl- 
edge — more particularly his knowledge of syntax. He 
first learns the Subjunctive of Purpose, let us say, or the 
Gerundive construction, by learning to recognize these 
idioms when he meets them in his reading. But this is 
only partial knowledge. A completer knowledge of the 
Subjunctive of Purpose or the Gerundive construction is 
required when the pupil learns to employ these in actual 
phrases of his own making. He then sees these construc- 
tions from a new side, and a practical side. The act of 
constructing sentences which contain these fixes his mind 
more intently upon the construction than ever before. 
His knowledge of it is fuller and surer. Hence it is pri- 
marily as a contributory to a better knowledge of the 
grammar, that the study of Latin composition is of 
value.” * 
This position is clear and definite, and is ably defended in 
the pages that follow. The only point to be made here is 
that such an exercise in composition is wholly a deductive 
exercise in the application of grammatical principles, de- 
signed to fix knowledge and to make the student efficient 
in the use of it. 
The rival theory, that represented by Collar and Dan- 
iell, is a modification of the method of connected composi- 
tion recommended by Ascham? and practised with so mych 
1“The Teaching of Latin and Greek,” pp. 160, 161.

-P-A-G-E-175
  PROCESSES OF APPLICATION 165 
success by Jacotot.* It seeks to secure continuous dis- 
course in composition by basing the exercises upon the 
text which the class is reading. This is effected by re- 
quiring the student to put into Latin again, a somewhat 
altered English translation of the original. The changes 
are those of number, person, tense, mode, etc., and are 
introduced as the student is able to make them. Jacotot’s 
maxim for work of this kind is expressed as follows: 
“Learn by heart, and understand, the first six books of 
Telémaque, or an equivalent portion of any eligible work 
in the language to be acquired, and repeat it incessantly. 
Refer everything else to this, and you will certainly learn 
the language.” His exercises in composition are based 
on the maxim, All is in all, and the pupil is expected to 
justify his use of words, phrases, and constructions by 
referring them to the text he has committed to memory. 
“Tt is because All is in all, that the precept, ‘Learn some- 
thing thoroughly and refer everything else to it,’ leads in 
practice to results so astonishing as those which are the 
proud trophies of the Universal Instruction.” ? 
Composition in continuous discourse based on the text 
of an author is, like that for grammatical drill, still an exer- 
cise in the application of what has been learned. 
Discussion: — Comparison of the arguments for and

against the two purposes of composition: 1. In ancient 
languages; 2. In modern foreign langauges. 
82. Whatever composition in English may be, it is not 
a parade ground for drill in grammar. Its leading pur- 
pose is facility and excellence in the use of written English. 
That the principles of grammar and rhetoric are valuable 
means in the accomplishment of this purpose is a matter 
of course. For the most part, however, they are applied 
instinctively, and certainly never become the end for which 
the exercise is written. Yet written and oral composition 
are peculiarly the field of application for all that properly 
goes under the head of ‘English.’ It is here that the 
student is incited to think for himself, to imitate good 
authors in form, while supplying fresh original thought. 
One who, for instance, tries his hand at imitating Portia’s 
apostrophe to Mercy by making a similar one on Justice, 
will have ample scope for invention even in his imitation, 
and certainly will not lack opportunity and incentive for 
original thinking. It is the biographical testimony of 
many celebrated writers that they taught themselves to 
write by practising exercises like the above, in which an 
admired literary form is applied as well as possible to 
original matter. Thus far in our schools we have assumed 
that composition is purely an individual affair, like eating 
or dying, when it comes to the work of composing; that 
codperative effort here is either impossible or illegitimate. 
But if a class may together prepare for writing, why may
-P-A-G-E-177
PROCESSES OF APPLICATION 167 
not small groups work together to advantage at the real 
composition? Here the need for a room which may for 
the time being, at least, become a real laboratory, or 
literary workshop, is felt. The library can hardly become 
such a place, for-its chief rule is silence. A literary work- 
shop should be a place where small codperating groups 
may consult together, and together work out their results, 
first one and then another acting as amanuensis for the 
group. They should have at hand the needed materials in 
the way of dictionaries, grammars, rhetorics, standard 
works on style, and especially copies of the best writings 
of the kind they are trying to produce. Such works, like 
Scott for description, can be supplied from time to time 
from the library as they are needed. The students may 
immerse themselves for hours or days, if need be, in the 
kind of writing they propose to attempt. Such work 
may at least be codperative, even if the first draft be made 
individually by each student, to be afterward combined 
into a single production by the group. Premature, hence 
immature, fruit is the kind usually produced by the 
young literary plant, for it tries to bear when it should 
be just growing, or at most only blossoming. Even if 
the work of composition is still to be considered a 
purely individual affair, the laboratory or workroom 
should nevertheless be provided where books may be 
freely consulted, and where the student may move freely 
from place to place, stand or sit as he prefers, and as 
 
-P-A-G-E-178
  168 SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN INSTRUCTION 
freely consult the elbow-to-elbow teacher who presides 
over the whole.* 
The literary workshop should also become the genera- 
ting plant for oral composition, in which one after another 
the students may try their hands at continuous narration 
or exposition. Any literary work —say Mark Twain’s 
“The Prince and the Pauper ’’— may be carefully read 
and reduced to brief outline by codperative work, one per- 
son taking perhaps a single chapter for oral reproduction, 
illustrated, it may be, with blackboard drawings. As 
chapter after chapter is thus given in oral speech, which 
will soon become fluent and measurably correct, the 
interest of all will be secured, and codperative criticism 
as to omissions, unwarranted additions, deviations, mis- 
conceptions, or failure to express the animating spirit of 
the author, and occasional slips in pronunciation and 
grammar, will be a stimulus to effort, while appreciative 
listening will lend reality and vividness to the whole 
exercise. Out of such practice as much writing may 
spring as teacher or pupil desires. Certainly from it 
we may expect a loosened tongue anda quickened 
mind.” —

83. The laboratory is now well established as an indis- 
pensable means of instruction in practically all the natural 
sciences, also in commercial courses and the practical 
aspects of industrial training. It serves at least three 
important functions. They are: — 
1. To enable the student to acquire first-hand knowl- 
edge by observation and experiment. 
2. To enable him to discover or deduce causes, classi- 
fications, or generalizations by inductive processes; also, 
on the other hand, to verify them when given or found, 
and to use them deductively to solve problems or to ex- 
plain facts and subordinate principles. 
3. Finally to give the student incentive and opportunity 
to apply his new-found knowledge upon a multitude of 
new cases, that it may acquire richness of content, be 
firmly fixed in the mind through much use, and finally 
that the student may by means of it rise to new levels of 
efficiency. 
It may safely be asserted that no other didactic inven- 
tion of modern times has the educational significance of 
the laboratory, for it has vivified the learning of facts, 
quickened the processes of thinking, giving them incentive, 
guidance, concreteness, and vitality, and greatly heightened

  170 SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN INSTRUCTION 
the capacity of the student to use in daily life the insight 
he has gained. Laboratory is indeed a word to conjure 
with; yet like all instruments in human hands, it is ca- 
pable of defeating the ends it was devised to serve. Its 
exercises may become as perfunctory, as arid, as any 
performed by old-time methods, for even here it is quite 
possible for the student to lose sight of all relations to 
life and to spend his time upon a set of scholasticized 
exercises wholly devoid of living motives. Under such 
circumstances science passes from life to death; students 
lose their interest in it and drop out of its classes, thinking 
it to be dull and tedious. On the other hand, nothing is 
more inspiring than laboratory practice when efficiency 
is being gained in real things. Thus, for illustration, the 
physics laboratory may be stocked with discarded machines 
of the mechanical world. Many a machine that is now 
sent to the scrap heap might serve a useful purpose in the 
physical laboratory. Think of the many devices for using 
the electric current for light, heat, motion; of the manifold 
internal-combustion motors that fill the market, whether 
for use on land or on water. One Y.M.C. A. establish- 
ment in New York City gathered in ‘a class of eight hun- 
dred young men and boys and held them for months upon 
the automobile engine. The genuine attracts; the arti- 
ficial repels. The commercial laboratories should be able 
to draw abundant materials from the museum of com- 
mercial products, such as the collections supplied to the
-P-A-G-E-181
  
PROCESSES OF APPLICATION 171 
high schools of Pennsylvania by the Philadelphia Museums, 
for in this way their laboratory practice catches the spirit 
of the real world of business. ‘Manual training shops may 
double their usefulness by permitting the students to make 
whole things rather than fragments of things, and when 
possible to invent and construct that which may find a 
real use in home or school. At present much of this 
practice is highly artificial, and hence out of touch with 
the industrial world. Aside from keeping the hands busy 
and furnishing a needed relief from the more highly in- 
tellectual exercises of the school, it performs but a fraction 
of its real function., Certainly most of the boys of the 
elementary schools who go to work without attending the 
high school must join the ranks of unskilled labor, even 
though they take the conventional manual training offered. 
This course is, moreover, so meagre in content, so formal 
and artificial in character, so restricted in amount, that it 
does not even encourage the boys to take more of it in the 
high school in order to fit themselves for practical occupa- 
tions. Such institutions are described as “Schools with 
shops attached,” whereas for the good of the mass of boys 
they should be “Shops with schools attached.” "a boy 
does not have to cease to think when he goes into a manual 
training department; he merely learns to think in a more 
concrete, more effective way. He gains efficiency, not 
only through increased skill of hand, but also through 
the awakening of fertility in device to meet difficulties. | 
 
-P-A-G-E-182
172 SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN INSTRUCTION 
  If regulation clamps are not at hand, home-made ones 
must be devised; if a piece of oak for a chair back re- 
fuses to bend into the proper shape around pegs, even 
after being steamed or boiled, it will easily yield if put 
into the vise with a piece of wood behind each end. 
In short, the laboratory as a place for the application 
of scientific or technical knowledge performs its true 
function in a high degree only when it is animated by 
motives drawn from the throbbing life of the world just 
outside the school, just around the corner. If the labora- 
tory work is the application of pure science, then the pupils 
must utilize the objects which science has produced, and 
must try to solve its real problems — they must work with 
engines and apparatus in physics; solve live problems in 
chemistry; handle real plants, the products of the fields, 
in botany; use the actual materials of commerce in the 
commercial laboratory courses, and so on. If it consists 
of manual training exercises, the student must produce 
wholes instead of mere fragments, spend time enough to 
effect real efficiency, and put its products to use, not throw 
them away or burn them up. 
The details of laboratory work suitable to the several 
studies are well set forth in the newer works upon the 
teaching of these studies in the high school.* 
Discussion: — 1. Amount of time desirable for laboratory 
application. How secured? 2. Means of making the labora-

tory the connecting link between the school and the industrial 
world. 
84. The time-honored custom of all mathematical 
teachers has been to secure what they regarded as adequate 
practice in the application of the rules and principles of 
algebra, geometry, and trigonometry, by requiring the 
student to solve a large number of exercises involving the 
use of these generalizations. Even in the so-called ‘read- 
ing’ of mathematics the student must read ever with 
pencil in hand ready to write out every exercise inserted 
for illustration and practice. DeMorgan* discusses this 
point as follows: — 
“ The first thing to be attended to in the reading of any 
algebraic treatise, is the gaining a perfect understanding 
of the different processes there exhibited, and of their 
connection with one another. This cannot be attained by 
a mere reading of the book, however great the attention 
which may be given. It is impossible by reading in 
mathematical work to fill up every process in the manner 
in which it must be filled up in the mind of the student 
before he can be said to have completely mastered it. 
“The method we recommend is to write the whole of the 
symbolical part of each investigation, filling up the parts 
to which we have alluded, adding only so much verbal 
elucidation as is absolutely necessary to explain the con- 
nection of the different steps, which will generally be much 
1“The Study and Difficulties of Mathematics,” pp. 175, 176.
-P-A-G-E-184
  174 SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN INSTRUCTION 
less than what is given in the book. This may appear an 
alarming labor to one who has not tried it, nevertheless 
we are convinced that it is the shortest method of pro- 
ceeding, since the deliberate consideration which the act of 
writing forces us to give, will prevent the confusion and 
difficulties which cannot fail to embarrass the beginner 
if he attempts, by mere perusal only, to understand new 
reasoning expressed in new language.” Again he says, 
“On arriving at any new rule or process, the student should 
work a number of examples sufficient to prove to himself 
that he understands and can apply the rule or process 
in question.” It is this constant practice in application 
that has placed side by side, translation in language and 
the solving of examples in mathematics, as the two sover- 
eign recipes for the training of mind. They have been — 
perhaps still are —the greatest instruments in the hands of 
the schoolmaster for effecting mental discipline. Naturally 
the two processes differ in character and effect. The 
supreme excellence of the latter is that the exercises in 
mathematics may be almost perfectly graded in difficulty 
to suit the expanding power of the youthful mind, and like 
exercises in translation, may be limited or extended in 
amount at will. Furthermore, there is in this subject 
always a tangible and ever-advancing fulcrum for the 
overcoming of difficulties, and which if, once lost may be 
recovered by review or further reflection. He who con- 
templates the advantages of mathematics as an instrument
-P-A-G-E-185
  
PROCESSES OF APPLICATION 175 
of intellectual training may well become enamoured of its 
perfection —a subject in which definite tasks may be 
assigned, and definite results attained; perfectly elastic 
as to quantity of assignment, capable of being exactly 
regulated in difficulty, and furnishing incentive and op- 
portunity for the acquisition of the highest degree of skill 
in its application. It is not strange that many a teacher, 
believing mental discipline to be the end of education, 
should exclaim, “'Tarry here! We shall never find any- 
thing better!’ He would be right, were number the whole 
of life. 
Completely as the writing out of exercises in mathe- 
matics has seemed to meet the demands of application, 
teachers in this subject have devised a new means of 
making this stage of method still more complete, A 
part of what is now known as the ‘Laboratory method’ 
gives a new scope to exercises of this character. This 
movement, starting with an address by John Perry, of 
England, in 1901, has been vigorously discussed in this 
country by such men as Professors Moore, Myers, and 
Young. A full bibliography of the subject, together with 
an extended exposition of the movement, is found in Young’s 
book on “ The Teaching of Mathematics.” * Much of 
this new work pertains to the acquisition of mathe-

  176 SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN INSTRUCTION 
matical knowledge and insight through methods and with 
materials that appeal to the senses. Graphical methods 
are employed, and various modes of proof are admitted, 
such as those which are based on intuition, on measure- 
ment, the free use of motion, and on what the eye can see. 
Such implements as the following are freely employed: 
models, slide-rules, surveying instruments, balances, 
steelyards, pendulums; levers, ‘pulleys, wedges, screws, 
vises; mercurial barometer, thermometer, instruments 
for measuring specific gravity, and the like. 
The field of application in this new-found laboratory is 
the constant exemplification of mathematical truths as 
they are more or less concretely applied to the natural 
sciences, especially physics, a list of such exercises being 
assigned to the students, though not necessarily for si- 
multaneous performance. Comparing the mathematical 
with the physical laboratory, Young discusses the subject 
as follows: — 
“In Mathematics the situation is much better. The 
possibility of doing much work with the class as a unit is 
one of the great advantages of the mathematical subject- 
matter, and it is to be cherished with the deepest solici- 
tude, and not to be abandoned because of a mere analogy. 
The apparatus needed for mathematics (pencil and paper 
the most prominent) can be improvised by the pupil as 
a rule, and it is quite possible to arrange matters so as to 
retain the benefits of the class system, and add thereto the
-P-A-G-E-187
  PROCESSES OF APPLICATION OT 
good features of the physical laboratory system, while 
avoiding its defects.” * 
Thus one more step is taken toward making the work- 
shop idea universal in the high school. 
Discusston: — 1. Extent to which pure science and mathe- 
matics in the high school should become applied science and 
mathematics. 2. Advantages and limitations of laboratory 
practice in mathematics.

  CHAPTER VIII 
COMBINATIONS AND VARIATIONS 
1. The Heuristic Method 
85. The word heuristic (Gr. heurisko, to find out) is 
somewhat new in educational terminology, but expresses 
a familiar idea; namely, that the student be placed in the 
attitude of a discoverer, that he be set to finding out things 
for himself. These things are of diverse character, but 
fall into the following chief divisions :— 
1. The discovery of essential facts in a lesson, say, on 
history, literature, or science. 
2. The discovery of the cause of a phenomenon, of 
what will happen in the case of a supposed cause, or of the 
law or principle according to which a given set of phe- 
nomena are controlled. 
3. The finding out of “witty inventions” in order to 
solve adequately by physical devices a problem presented 
by supposition or by an actual situation. 
Here, however, we see the application of the categories 
with which we have become familiar. The method 
assumes that there are at least some cases where it is better 
178
-P-A-G-E-189
  vate 
COMBINATIONS AND VARIATIONS 179 
to require the student to observe and experiment in order 
to learn the desired fact, rather than to tell him, or to cite 
the authority of a writer. Advocates of heuristic methods 
maintain also that it is fitting that we require the discovery 
of cause and effect and of law by original thinking, at 
least in some cases, rather than to give them by authority, 
whether this authority be reénforced by efforts at verifi- 
cation on the part of the student or not. Here, it is plain 
that the inductive approach may be utilized to discover 
cause or law, but it is equally plain that deductive use may 
be made of principles or causes already established, in 
order to explain what has occurred, whether in the affairs 
of mice or men.’ It has already been shown that teaching 
as an art must, like all arts, be free if it is to be effective,” 
consequently there need be no surprise when it is pointed 
out that all writers on heuristic methods assume that the 
teacher will freely use all the means at his disposal, such 
as observation, experiment, hypothesis, analogy, verifica- 
tion, invention, and the like, in such order and with such 
emphasis as will best conserve the leading purpose of the 
hour. Induction may rule for a day or a week, to be 
preceded or succeeded by deduction; or deduction may 
become for the time being the leading process, to be in like 
manner preceded or succeeded by induction; or the two 
may be used in constant reciprocal interaction, each sup- 
1 See exposition in Ch. VI. 
? Compare p, 83.  
-P-A-G-E-190
  180 SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN INSTRUCTION 
plying the deficiencies of the other, and both serving their 
turn in stimulating the mental energies of the student. 
The skilful, experienced teacher rarely stops to ask him- 
self which step in a thoroughly scientific method comes 
next, but he uses instinctively and almost automatically 
the right step to effect the result desired; or, finding no 
response to one stimulus, he instantly tries another. So 
the mind of the leader and the minds of his pupils act 
and interact, often with great rapidity and variety; some- 
times with slow, earnest labor, step by step, until the goal 
is attained, for not all ideas come in a flash or can develop 
in a minute. ; 
Good teaching needs freedom also in the amount of 
time or emphasis that is to be devoted to the various as- 
pects of the subject taught. A single lesson may at times 
(rare in the experience of the typical school) illustrate 
every aspect of scientific method, and thus become a 
show piece for the admiring observer, who is delighted 
to see in a nutshell the concentrated essence of every 
method known to man. Usually, however, and especially 
when the observer is not present, the recitation period is 
devoted more to some one phase of a proper method than 
to any other, or perhaps to all others combined. Welton * 
happily describes these varying aspects as follows: — 
“Though every form of the learning process may go on

in any one lesson, yet a little reflection makes it evident that 
the predominant feature in one differs from that in another. 
There are lessons of which the main aim is the increase 
of information or the apprehension of fact. In these the 
learning process is predominantly perceptual. There are 
others of which the essential purpose is to examine and 
analyze facts already familiar, so as to reach a fuller 
understanding of them; in other words to develop theories 
and general ideas. In these the mental process in learning 
is essentially conceptual, and the order of thought is in- 
ductive. Thirdly, there are those whose primary function 
is to apply and utilize knowledge which has already been 
acquired. In these, also, the mental process of learning 
is conceptual, but the order of thought is deductive. And, 
fourthly, there are lessons which tend to develop con- 
structive and executive skill. In these the mental process 
of the learner is either imitative or imaginative, and in 
each the expression of the ideas by some form of physical 
activity is the characteristic feature.” 
From the foregoing it can be seen that the term heuristic 
«is properly used to describe all those teaching processes 
which tend to awaken and stimulate the self-active en- 
ergies of the student, (1) in the acquisition of facts, 
(2) in the discovery of their meaning, and (3) in gaining 
facility in their intellectual or physical application. The 
term enriches our methodological vocabulary to the extent 
that in teaching it implies the perfect freedom of the
-P-A-G-E-192
182 SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN INSTRUCTION 
teacher to use any or all means available; as, for example, 
any form of approach, whether exclusively inductive or 
exclusively deductive, or any blending of the two; any 
kind of device, already known or freshly invented, to 
discover facts or to secure results in construction. Since 
the teacher not only has this freedom, but is in duty bound 
to exercise it, the term heuristic, which carries this impli- 
cation, is a good one to use.* 
Discussion: — Proper limits for the heuristic method in 
the several studies. 
2. Invention as a Mode of Thought 
86. Three young Germans recently set themselves the 
task of solving this problem: How transport live fish from 
distant rivers to Berlin without the use of water-tanks? 
It seems the people of that city are willing to eat salt- 
water fish brought in dead in cold storage, but are unwilling 
to use fresh-water fish so transported. But it is expensive 
to carry large water-tanks on cars. The young men began 
the analysis of this problem by asking: Why must fish 
have water to keep them alive? Todrink? Not probable. 
Evidently to carry the air that is in the water to the gills, 
that they may absorb the oxygen of the air to purify the 
blood. But why cannot the fish get the needed oxygen 
direct from the air without the aid of water? Here ex- 
1 The author who writes most convincingly on this subject, especially 
for elementary teachers, is Henry E. Armstrong in “The Teaching of 
Scientific Method,” The Macmillan Co., N.Y.
-P-A-G-E-193
  
COMBINATIONS AND VARIATIONS 183 
perience comes to their aid. Every fisherman knows that 
fish will live longer out of water in the shade than in the 
sunshine; in dark, damp days, than in bright, dry ones; 
furthermore, that if water be dashed over them occasion- 
ally life may be greatly prolonged. What then seems to 
be the immediate cause of death when in the open air? 
The drying out of the gills (and doubtless also the scales), 
for so long as they remain moist the fish lives. If we can 
devise some method of keeping gills and scales moist 
during transportation, will the fish come through alive? 
Perhaps. Let us assume that they will. 
The next important question is, What causes moist 
things to dry out? Evidently the presence of dry or 
unsaturated air; for so long as the atmosphere is not 
saturated with moisture it will continue to absorb it from 
any available source. How can any moist object be kept 
from drying out? Evidently by keeping it in a saturated 
atmosphere. But how shall we manage to do this with 
the fish? 
It is certain that it will not do to pack them in barrels, 
even if covered with water, for the mechanical pressure 
would prevent the gills from opening, so that the fish 
would be suffocated, even if there were a sufficient supply 
of oxygen available. “Let us,” said one, “take a tight 
dry-goods box, build it full of pigeon (fish) holes, put one 
fish in each compartment, hang up wet cloths inside to 
keep the air saturated, and then tightly close the box.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-194
184 SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN INSTRUCTION 
  So far, so good; they have provided for permanent mois- 
ture of gills and scales, and have made suffocation from 
pressure impossible. 
A new query now arises: How shall the supply of 
oxygen be renewed without introducing the outside air, 
which would cause the gills to dry? One suggested the 
introduction of saturated air, which would have been 
satisfactory except for the trouble of preparing it. Finally, 
another had a happy thought, — “If those fish need 
oxygen, why not give it to them?” 
Having thought their problem through, they made 
their box with its compartments, enclosed it in a larger 
box with provision for saturating the air inside, con- 
nected a bag of oxygen with the interior by means of 
a glass pipe, arranged for a small vent to provide for 
slow ventilation, caught their fish and put them drip- 
ping wet inside, nailed the whole thing up tight, and 
let it stand for four days. 
Doubtless they held many animated discussions as to 
the correctness of their reasoning and the adequacy of 
their apparatus. At the end of the four days, however, 
they opened the box and dumped the fish into a pond. 
It is said that their fish distinguished themselves from the 
other fish in the pond by the vigor of their motions and the 
keenness of their hunger. They had indeed come through 
alive, but they were empty, and tired of lying still while 
breathing an exhilarating atmosphere.

Whether the experiment actually led to the transporta- 
tion of live fish from distant rivers into Berlin or not, 
the exercise was a good one in inventive thought. The 
problem was analyzed into its component parts, so that 
the difficulties might be met and overcome one at a time, 
and when this had been accomplished the whole was put 
to the test of trial. Will it work? This is the process 
of every inventor, whether, like Howe, he puts the eye in 
the wrong end of the needle, and thus invents the sewing 
machine; or like the Massachusetts man who has recently 
invented a machine for separating expeditiously the linen 
fibre from the straw of flax, thus being able to do in an 
hour, without handling, what the European peasant ef- 
fects only as the result of much handling for many weeks. 
It is the process also of every man or boy who meets the 
exigencies of a situation in new ways. A lad was sent to 
the woods with a team for a load of rails. They were 
scattered among the thick undergrowth. When finally 
the load was complete, the wagon stuck fast on a sapling. 
Having forgotten to take an axe along, the lad, with hands 
in pockets, stood in perplexity, debating which would cost 
the less labor, to go for the axe and cut down the sapling, 
or to unload the rails and perhaps take the wagon apart. 
Presently he noticed that the sapling was almost breaking 
with the strain caused by the pressure upon it, and his 
hand being upon the knife in his pocket, he made a dart 
under the wagon, caused the team to give a steady pull, 
 
-P-A-G-E-196
  186 SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN INSTRUCTION 
and in a trice had the sapling cut down with his jack- 
knife. 
Such inventive thought is especially the prerogative 
of the laboratory and workshop, where apparatus must be 
devised and constructed, and where all the inventive 
resources of the youth are called for to effect desired ends 
under given conditions. It is the wit of man against the 
fiat of circumstances; it is what enables the primitive 
man and the pioneer to meet the requisites for survival; 
it is the resource of those who must make a little go a long 
way in furnishing the necessities, or in effecting the deco- 
rations of the home. A pleasant distinction is to be made 
between the articles thus devised by the bungler on 
the one hand, and by the skilful, inventive thinker on 
the other. The latter may properly call attention to the 
difference between the home-made and the hand-made. 
The element of inventive thought is found also in all 
original work in drawing, as in the designing of articles 
or of their decoration, and, as every artist knows, is the 
very life and heart of his labor. That in the acquisition 
of skill in the arts there is an element of imitation is well 
known, but imitation that is devoid of invention soon 
reaches its limits of usefulness as an educational instru- 
ment.* 
Discussion: — Provision that can be made for inventive 
thought in the respective high-school studies.

3. Analysis and Synthesis 
87. Not a little confusion has at times been occasioned 
in methodology by attempts to regard analysis and syn- 
thesis as complete methods, and in trying to identify 
them with, or distinguish them from, induction and de- 
duction respectively. The confusion arises from two 
circumstances ; namely, first, that the purpose of an analy- 
sis may not be that of induction at all, or the purpose of 
a synthesis that of deduction; and second, that the kind 
of things which may be analyzed into elements, or the kind 
of elements that may be united into wholes, is virtually 
unlimited. We may analyze anything, and do so when 
we separate it into its elements, for any purpose what- 
soever; and we may synthesize any elements that we can 
contrive to get together, again for any conceivable purpose. 
We may analyze a word into elements to see how it is 
spelled; a constructive problem, to meet and overcome 
its difficulties one by one, as, for instance, in the problem 
of the transportation of live fish above described; a politi- 
cal situation, in order to know how to vote; and so on 
throughout the manifold affairs of life. A conception has 
both content and extent; either may be analyzed; a 
fact may have both essential or significant aspects, as in 
detective work, and insignificant ones; analysis enables 
us to separate the one from the other. A mathematical 
problem may be analyzed in order to lead to its solution. 
 
-P-A-G-E-198
  188 SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN INSTRUCTION 
We may analyze experience to find the factors that will be 
useful to us upon any given occasion, or under any given 
circumstances. There is mathematical analysis, and 
chemical analysis, and logical analysis, and critical analy- 
sis, and psychological analysis; there is analysis in arts 
and sciences and in practical affairs, — there are, in short, 
as many kinds and methods of analysis as there are 
different wholes to be resolved into elements. The con- 
verse of all this is equally true for synthesis. We even 
tread of the Pollard synthetic method of teaching reading 
to children. 
Manifestly, only confusion can arise from any attempt 
to identify analysis with induction, for there are many 
methods of analysis and many purposes for which it is 
made, but there is but one method and one purpose for 
induction; the method, namely, of inferring the general 
from the particular, and the purpose of arriving at a gen- 
eralization of some sort. 
The better way is to regard analysis simply as a mani- 
foldly varied means of separating aggregates into their 
elements, be the purpose of the separation what it will; 
and conversely, of regarding synthesis as an equally varied 
means of uniting elements into aggregates, let the purpose 
of the union be what it may. 
* Discussion: — Distinguish between mathematical and 
chemical analysis; between psychological and critical analysis.

4. Some German Methods 
88. German writers’ on methods of teaching usually 
distinguish at least three distinct aspects to a scientific 
method, as follows: — 
1. The telling, or lecture aspect. 
2. The expository aspect. 
3. The development aspect. 
The telling, or lecture method, serves for imparting 
facts on the authority of the teacher, while exposition and 
development serve to enable the student to comprehend the 
significance of the facts thus imparted; that is, to discover 
and understand causes, effect classifications, and derive 
generalizations, partly at least through the student’s own 
thinking. 
The American high-school teacher, fresh from the 
university, is often reproved for his proneness to fall into 
the lecture type of instruction, but to the German teacher 
this is the standard method of imparting information. All 
his life he has learned in this way, and it hardly occurs to 
him that there is any other. From the time he enters the 
elementary school at six, until he leaves for the university, 
his teachers have in general spent about half of each period 
of fifty or fifty-five minutes in telling him facts, and the 
other half of the hour in calling for their repetition and

explanation. The same method is followed in the univer- 
sity, with the exception that the lecturer now spends the 
entire period with his lecture, leaving review to the stu- 
dent’s note-book, and understanding to his private reflec- 
tion. Consequently, to the German, telling becomes the 
most natural method of teaching. 
A considerable part of training for teaching in Germany 
is devoted to the theory and practice of narration, as the 
chief means for imparting information to the students. 
The candidate is taught to utilize freely the principle of 
apperception in introducing his lesson; to use the heuristic 
method of arousing interest in what is to be given, by 
inducing reflection on related matters; and to employ 
direct sense perception, or observation, by the pupils, 
whenever this is possible. Pictures, maps, and objects are 
to be freely used whenever suitable and available. The 
lesson itself must be presented in simple, forceful language, 
with good diction and animated delivery. It must, when 
possible, as in history, assume the narrative form, with 
the classic epic as a model. Be as good a story-teller as 
Homer and you will be sure to have the interested attention 
of the pupils, the trainer admonishes. Make the story 
vivid, throw a strong light on the leading actors and events, 
arrange all in due order, bring to bear every resource of 
literary art, so that it will be more easy and natural to 
remember than to forget. Who that has once read and 
experienced in imagination the adventures of Ulysses

COMBINATIONS AND VARIATIONS IQr 
ever loses any essential part of that immortal tale? Learn 
of the ancient rhetoricians, who emphasized five points 
for the orator: — 
1. The getting of the material, — invention. 
2. The arrangement of the material, — disposition. 
3. The diction to be chosen, — elocution. 
4. Impression that will surely lead to recall, —memory- 
5. The speech itself, — action. 
Then, after all this has been done, learn to pass easily 
from monologue to dialogue, to that review and elaboration 
that secure retention and understanding. 
‘ American secondary schools are not so organized that 
this method can be successfully used in them. In the 
first place, our periods for recitation are much shorter 
than the German, so that they cannot readily be divided 
somewhat equally between narration by the teacher and 
reproduction by the students. In the second place, 
American teachers rely upon the text-books for the facts 
to be mastered by the student, whereas Germans expect 
the teacher to carry in his head and properly arrange all 
that is to be imparted. Then, American students have 
study periods at school, whereas German students do not, 
since practically all school hours are with them recitation 
hours. As a natural consequence of these conditions, 
any effort of the beginner in the American high school 
to ignore the text-book as a source of facts, and the study 
hour as a time for learning them, is sure to be looked upon
-P-A-G-E-202
  192 SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN INSTRUCTION 
as an unwise innovation, and reproved accordingly. 
What makes it worse for the would-be lecturer is that the 
periods are too short to secure the requisite time for the 
preparation and elaboration and review that are neces- 
sary for the successful utilization of this primitive method, 
inherited from Greeks, but perfected by Germans. 
Discussion: — Relative usefulness of the lecture method 
in the various subjects under American conditions. 
89. The expository method is concerned with the ex- 
planation of facts already imparted, and falls into two 
main divisions, —the exposition of difficult points (z) 
of language, and (2) of things and events. The diffi- 
culties of language find their exposition chiefly in con- 
nection with translation, whereas those that relate to 
natural phenomena or to historical events are treated in 
the laboratory or in the regular recitation. The various 
stages of such work in Latin have already been indicated 
in Section 73. The exposition of difficult points in the 
comprehension of events in the natural or in the historical 
world is made chiefly by the aid of the deductive applica- 
tion of known principles, as already sufficiently explained 
in the chapter on The Deductive Approach. 
go. The third, or development method, is precisely that 
of the American school, and may be (1) of the inductive 
type, where authority, observation, and experiment give 
the facts, and hypothesis, analogy, and inductive inference

suggest the law, while deductive verification confirms or 
rejects it; and (2) of the deductive type, either in antici- 
pation of what is or will be true, or for the purpose of gain- 
ing new knowledge and insight respecting facts and laws. 
gi. From every point of view, therefore, there is con- 
vincing confirmation of the fact that the essential elements 
of all rational methods are few in number and easy to 
understand, however difficult they may be to apply wisely 
and well. They are employed by the scholar in his study, 
the scientific man in his laboratory, the inventor in his 
workshop, the merchant in his counting-house, the manu- 
facturer in his office, the statesman in the halls of legisla- 
tion. Every man, in short, who deals with facts and their 
significance, must perforce use the categories, and follow 
the order of thought described in this work, if he would be 
master of his problem, and control his situation. The 
school is the place where men should learn to do their 
work, — to gather facts, to think out their meaning, and 
to become effective in their utilization. That the teacher 
may see more clearly than he perhaps saw before what 
these essential elements are, and that he may do his work, 
at first with deeper insight, and eventually with greater 
skill than before, the foregoing exposition has been written. 
The sources from which the facts and arguments of this 
volume have been drawn are open and commended to 
all.

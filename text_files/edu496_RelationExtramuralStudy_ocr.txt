ACKNOWLEDGMENTS 
This study was undertaken at the suggestion of Dr. Shelton 
Phelps of George Peabody College for Teachers. His constructive 
criticism has been invaluable. The writer is also under obliga- 
tion to the presidents of the teachers colleges of Missouri and to 
the President of the Teachers College at Macomb, Illinois, for 
access to data and files of information which were absolutely 
necessary for a worth while study. Members of faculties in these 
schools were accommodating and in many cases helped personally 
in the collection of valuable data. Dr. John R. Kirk, President 
of the Teachers College at Kirksville, has looked with favor upon 
this study and has lent encouragement and help in many ways. 
My son, William, gave generous assistance in collecting and tabu- 
lating data and in making numerous computations. The writer is 
also indebted to Miss T. Jennie Green and Mrs. Wilhelmina Burk, 
colleagues in the State Teachers College, who read manuscript, 
and to Mrs. Jo Walker Humphrey, Dean of Women, who read 
galley and page proof. To all these and many others grateful ac- 
knowledgment is made.

CHAPTER I 
Mernops or Investigation 
I. Typr oF DATA 
This study is based on data collected from original sources. 
It is therefore almost entirely of a statistical nature, and it deals 
with certain types of data not usually found in school surveys and 
ordinary educational investigations; therefore, some methods 
of procedure are used that call for explanation and illustration. 
However, no special consideration is given to methods that are 
in current use in the field of educational literature. The reader 
who is familiar with the methods dealt with in this chapter, may 
pass immediately to Chapter II in which begins the study of the 
problem. The last chapter gives a summary of preceding chap- 
ters. 
Il. Types OF CORRELATION AND REGRESSION 
Use is made of certain types of correlation other than 
_ XY.

the correlation coefficient, found by Pearson’s product-moment 
method and its modifications where x and y are the deviations of 
each measure from the true mean of its respective distribution 
X and and ox and oy are the respective standard deviations 
of the distributions. The standard deviation is the square root of 
the arithmetic mean of the squares of all deviations measured 
from the arithmetic mean of the observations. Thus

is frequently called the root-mean-square deviation from the mean, 
and it is less than the root-mean-square deviation from any other 
origin. 
Now if x-arrays of type y and y-arrays of type x be formed 
from a twofold distribution, and we take for instance the mean of 
each y-array, defined in certain intervals of x, and join these points 
in a graph by a curve, and do likewise for the x-arrays, the two 
regression curves are obtained. In uncorrelated data the mean of  
-P-A-G-E-14
  14 Tur Revation or EXTRA-MURAL StupDyY TO 
an array does not depend on the type or position of the array. 
In other words, the means are the same from array to array as 
for the whole distribution. In this event the means for the x 
and y-arrays approximate straight lines and will coincide re- 
spectively with the y and x-axes if the axes are taken through the 
center of the distribution. But for correlated data the regression 
curve diverges from the position of coincidence with the axes. 
The degree of correlation is determined by the distance of the 
means of arrays from the axis. The numerical measure of the cor- 
relation of the data involved depends on the deviation of the means 
from the horizontal axis through the center of the distribution. 
For example, when the means of rows (x-arrays) lie on a 
straightline, we have what is called straight line regression denoted 
by the equation } 
na IX. r 
x=rry, 
where all terms are defined as given above. If means of columns 
are used, the equation is 
oy. y =r—x. ox 
In the equations, pect a pee 
oy Ox 
b, and be are called regression coefficients, and represent the 
respective slopes of the two lines with the y and x-axes through 
the center of the distribution. It is also seen that b, is the re- 
ciprocal of the slope with the x-axis. 
In case the means of arrays do not lie on a straight line, and 
this situation generally exists, we still compute 
he 2xy 
Noxoy 
as before and take the two straight lines, x=biy and y=bex, where 
b; and be are defined as noted above. These two lines have 
the property of being the best fitting straight lines for the means 
of rows and columns respectively. This result signifies for ex- 
ample, that when   
Ox 
bi=r-, oy 
the sum of the squares of the distances of the row means (x-arrays) 
measured horizontally from the line x=biy, each multiplied by 
the corresponding frequency, is the least possible. Also the 
standard error or deviation of estimating x from buy, represented 
by 
2(x—bry)” an N o(1—1?) 8? =

  RestpENcE ENROLMENT AND SCHOLASTIC STANDING 15 
isa minimum. The straight lines, x=biy and y=bnx, are again 
called the lines of regression and have their evident mathematical 
interpretations. Moreover, since x= X=-x and y= Y—¥, if Y and 
xX and ¥ are given, the most probable value of X can be determined. 
Here X and Y are particular observations and xX and ¥, the means 
of the X and Y distributions. But, since there are two such lines, a 
change in y produces a change in x from the first equation and 
this change in x cannot be calculated at all from the second equa- 
tion. Similar statements hold concerning the use of the second 
equation. 
These lines of regression and the value of r can be computed 
for any set of data involving two measured attributes. But it is 
evident, if the means of arrays do not lie close to the line of re- 
gression, that the coefficients of correlation and regression do not 
give a true measure of the actual relationship between the two 
attributes. However, under such conditions, r always understates 
the actual relationship that exists.!_ To get at the true relation- 
ship, when the regression is not linear, the correlation ratio is used. 
III. Correration Ratio 
Suppose we consider the y-arrays and take the means of 
each array ¥x, while the mean of the whole distribution along the 
y-axis is ¥. If, then, we get the mean square deviation of the 
means of arrays from the mean of the whole distribution and 
divide this by the standard deviation of the whole distribution, the 
quotient is a measure of relationship called the correlation ratio, 
n. Itis given by the formula 
aon Weve nyx’ Not ee pc Mee abbe Woeate 2 (LD) 
Thus the correlation ratio is seen to be the standard deviation of 
means of y-arrays divided by the standard deviation of the whole 
distribution along the y-axis. Since 7 is a quotient of two standard 
deviations, it is always positive. There are two correlation ra- 
tios nyx, read correlation of y on x, and yxy, read correlation of 
xony. ‘The first is obtained from using y-arrays, the second, from 
using x-arrays, and the two may differ considerably. 
For data of zero correlation the means lie exactly on the two 
axes. Hence each separate difference in the numerator of the 
correlation ratio would equal zero. Therefore »=0 for zero 
correlation. Also 
3 9 yO 
xy? = -() : 
Ox 
where yox is an average of the standard deviations of x-arrays 
of type y, and ox is the standard deviation of the x’s.2 But 
nxy?>0. Therefore yox?<ox?, and msy?<1, and, as previously 
observed, » is always positive. Moreover,

where oa is the standard deviation of means of x- ys from the 
line of regression measured parallel to the x-axi Therefore 
0< my <1, and also 0< ayx<1, and my>|r\, |. Hence 
r never overstates the correlation between two attributes but 
may considerably understate it when the regression is far from 
linear. The reason for using the correlation ratio in certain cases 
now becomes evident. 
Applications of this method to particular problems may be 
found in Rugg’s SrartstrcaL Meruop, p. 281, West’s MatHe- 
MATICAL Statistics, p. 77, and Yule’s, Ivrropuction To Sra- 
TIsTICS, p. 207; consequently, illustrations of the process as ap- 
plied to particular problems may be omitted; in fact, the formula 
makes the process clear. 
IV. A NEW METHOD OF DETERMINING CORRELATION 
Pearson develops a “new method of determining correlation 
when one variable is given by alternative and the other by multiple 
categories. ’”4 
1. Explanation of method 
Let y be the categoric variate divided into multiple classes 
and x be the alternative variate—the A and non-A classes. The 
alternate variate is supposed to be continuous, but y is not neces- 
sarily continuous. As has already been seen, the correlation 
ratio 7 has a very definite meaning for such a system. It is the 
ratio of the standard deviation of the weighted means of the y- 
arrays of type x to the standard deviation of the y’s for the whole 
distribution. A similar statement holds for x-arrays of type y. 
The equation,    
              
  was found where ny is the number of individuals in any y-category; 
is the mean of x of the category of type y, and X is the mean and 
ox is the standard deviation of the whole number of observations 
N. It was also seen that 0< <1, and 7 becomes r when the re- 
gression is linear, for, then ca?=0 in the equation 
    
  oa 
ox”   
       
The quantity yox, in the equation (yox)?=ox?(1—nxy?).....(1), 
is the arithmetic mean of standard deviations of weighted arrays 
of type y, and it becomes very small as 7 approaches unity? 
Then (Ie) gives

Now, if we assume that the distributions are homoscedastic, 
that is, all x-arrays have the same or approximately the same 
standard deviations, it follows from (1) that for yox’ /ox? in (II), 
we may put its value 1—nxy’.

These are the two values of the correlation ratio which are 
useful in case one or both of the attributes are not measured. 
These formulae were deduced by making the following assumptions: 
(1) The alternate variate is sufficiently Gaussian to permit 
finding the means from tables of the probability integral. The 
means of x show whether this variate is Gaussian. The x-arrays 
do not continuously increase or decrease as they do in a symmet- 
rical distribution where two variates are correlated. When used 
in a non-Gaussian distribution, » may even turn out imaginary. 
(2) For formula (IID) the arrays are approximately homo- 
scedastic, but for formula (II) when the alternate variate with two 
classes is replaced by one grouped in three classes the arrays 
need not be homoscedastic. 
2. New method applied to concrete problems 
This method of calculating correlation ratios is now applied 
to certain problems that have arisen in this study. After these 
explanations when the body of the study is reached, only the 
correlation ratio and certain facts necessary for its interpretation 
shall be given. A correlation ratio always demands an inter- 
pretation since it is always positive, and since there are two such 
ratios. Hence qxy? = (1—y?) 2 
      
By solving, we have yxy? = . (IID)

  School preference is taken as the x or alternate variate divided 
into three classes. The y or categoric variate is registration at 
Kirksville. As far as the plan of work is concerned the categoric 
«variate could be divided into any number of classes and the pro- 
cedure would be the same. But, if the number of divisions ex- 
ceeds 5 or 6, the labor of computation is great. For this work is 
used formula (II) which is formula (II) of Biometrika, Vol. VII, 
p. 250. Itis

For obtaining the mean values of x-arrays divided by their re- 
spective standard deviations we use Sheppard’s Tables, p. 182, 
Vol. II, Biometrika. The area under the probability curve is 1. 
If an area a/2 is taken on either side of the vertical mean and an 
ordinate erected, the lesser area cut off is }(1—a) and the greater 
area is 3(1+a). The former expression is less than one-half the 
whole area; the latter, greater. If it is agreed to measure area 
from the extreme left through the mean to the right, then the 
abscissa of the limiting ordinate of }(1—a) is negative while that 
of $(1+a) is positive. 
This procedure is followed for each vertical array including 
the total array in the distribution in the tables above. Suppose 
we take the upper horizontal or y-array, and begin with 437. But 
437 /1153<4, and it represents the proportion of the total area 
under the curve for the Kirksville preference group; therefore, 
437 ati =

But by agreement the area }(1—a) is to the left of the mean of the

array of totals, then the abscissa of its limiting ordinate is negative, 
though evidently the area 3(1+a) just to its right has the same 
limiting ordinate. Thus the sign of the abscissa is negative when 
the portion of the area under the curve is less than 3. Next we 
take from the upper horizontal array the 151 in the first column, 
and find the proportion of this array that is under the curve. It 
is 151 /242 = .6239 which is greater than 3, and by agreement the 
abscissa of its ordinate is positive. Finally, we take from the 
same horizontal array the 286 in the second column. The propor- 
tion of this array that is mene the curve is 
286 
9 
and its abscissa is negative. These abscissae are expressed in 
terms of their respective standard deviations, and in formulae 
(ID) and (IIT) they are the mean values of x-arrays of type y. 
When the alternate variate is divided into three classes, as 
in the proposed problem, two sets of abscissae are needed. The 
second set is obtained by adding the elements of the horizontal 
array first used to the corresponding elements of the intermediate 
horizontal row, and then by proceeding and choosing signs of 
mean values of abscissae just as done for set (1). We have ex- 
plained the whole process involved in formula (II) except the de- 
termination of the width, h, of the intermediate horizontal row. 
That problem will be taken up a little later when the need arises. 
It is evident that 5(1+a) is obtained by subtracting +(1—a) 
from 1. Sheppard’s Tables are used in the work which follows.® 
From the upper row of our tabulation we obtain set (1) of 
values below, and from the two upper rows combined we obtain 
set (2) below. Bc ates Fi 3139=4(—2),

Now if the corresponding parts of set (1) are subtracted from 
set (2), set (3) is obtained, the meaning of which is explained later. 
It gives a constant, h, divided by the respective standard devia- 
tions. Set (4) is obtained by dividing the first ratio in set (3) by 
the second and third ratios of the same set.

Set (4) shows that the x-arrays are nearly homoscedastic, for 
they change but little in passing from array to array. A test of the 
Gaussian character of the distribution is for the means of x-arrays 
continuously to increase or decrease. This same test is applicable 
when the y-category has 3 or more divisions. If it is desirable, 
we can multiply the means of arrays in sets (1) and (2) by the 
quotients of standard deviations in set (4) and thus obtain the 
means of x-arrays in terms of a common unit ox. 
By using values in set (1), substituting in formula (II), and 
employing logarithms, we find 
P= Trsglt2 .313)?(1.054)?-+911(.485)?(.929)?]—(.308)? = .0884. 
Therefore n= .299. 
By using values in set (2), we find 
dee TH? .944)?(1.054)?-+-911 (.288)2(.929)2]—(.41)? = .1075. 
Therefore 7= .328. 
The agreement between the results obtained by using values 
in sets (1) and (2) is remarkably close, and it affords an almost 
perfect check on the validity of the application of this method to 
data in hand. This agreement shows that the x-variate, school 
preference, is also approximately Gaussian. Doubtless this 
method would prove valuable in treating great quantities of data 
relative to influence on school attendance, and material relating to 
similgr influences in business and trade. 
(2) Interpretations 
Even if 7 should not be found by this method because of the 
wide departure of the x-variate from a Gaussian distribution, which 
may even show 7 imaginary, still sets of values (1) and (2) may in 
any event tell a great deal about the distribution and the relation 
of the attributes.

In this particular problem Kirksville preference is the x-va- 
riate, and registration the y-variate. The type of the horizontal 
array used in the calculation, that is, school preference, should de- 
note the positive end of the x-axis in the graph. With this un- 
derstanding using values in set (1) and placing the x-axis vertical 
as in the tabulation we have: 
Fia. 1 
Schoo/ Preference 
  This graph shows clearly that, as we pass from registered to non- 
registered students, the preference for Kirksville declines, or, 
as we pass from non-registered to registered, the preference for 
Kirksville increases rapidly. In other words, 7=.299 and 7=.328 
show strong positive correlation between preference for Kirksville 
and later enrolment. 
We still have left the necessity of explaining the meaning of 
h in set (3) of our calculated values. In Fig. 1. above, let 
h/ox=BQ+QA be the range of the non-preference group. It 
happens that Q, the mean of the whole distribution, falls inside 
this range in our representation above, but the result is the same 
and follows by the same argument whether Q falls into either. of 
the other two horizontal arrays. ; 
Now X/ox is measured from the boundary of the Kirksville 
preference and no preference groups, while Xx’ /ox is measured as 
seen in the calculations of values in set (2) from the boundary of 
other school preference and no preference groups. 
Then AQ=== —.308, and BQ=—= 410.

  22 THe RELATION OF EXTRA-MURAL StuDY TO 
This calculation is made for the sum of x-arrays or array of totals. 
It is the same for each individual x-array. Thus the following 
rule is deduced: to obtain the values in set (3) subtract values in 
set (1) from corresponding values in set (2). Moreover, it is seen 
that h/ ox, h/ oi, and h/ 2 represent the depth of the middle hori- 
zontal range as it is found in the whole distribution, and as it 
passes from x-array to x-array. 
b. Second method—formula (ITT) 
(1) Application 
The application of formula (III) now becomes easy. We 
may combine the two lower rows of the preceding table into one 
row so as to have strictly alternate classes in the x-variate, or we 
may change our variates and let school preference become the 
categoric or y-variate of three classes and registration become 
the alternate variate where registration represents a relationship 
passing from remoteness of affiliation to actual affiliation with the 
school. The latter course is adopted and, when the direction of 
axes are interchanged, the table appears as follows:

  have: u

therefore ,=.268. therefore 7 = .0714; 
Had we used the upper row, we should have obtained }(1—a) 
instead of $(1+a), and the means of arrays would have been 
negative and exactly equal in absolute value to the values already 
found. Hence 7 will have the same value no matter which row 
is used. 
(2) Interpretations 
We may again use the graph of the means of arrays for inter- 
preting the nature of the correlation and other properties of the 
distribution. Of course the mean of the x-array representing 
the whole distribution is not included in the main part of the 
graph which shows variations in x-arrays of certain types.

From the graph of means it is seen that the means of x-arrays 
increase continuously as we pass from left to right; that is, as we 
pass from Kirksville preference, through no preference, to prefer- 
ence for other schools, non-registration increases continuously or 
affiliation with school decreases continuously. Also it is seen that 
as we pass from right to left along the y-axis the abscissae decrease 
continuously; that is, as we pass from preference for other schools,
-P-A-G-E-24
  24 Tue RELATION oF EXTRA-MURAL STUDY TO 
through no preference, to preference for Kirksville, registration 
increases continuously. The fact that P, Q, and R are above the 
y-axis has no important bearing on our interpretation of rela- 
tionships. The direction in which these points move is the im- 
portant thing. 
c. Comparisons and conclusions 
Strong positive correlation exists between Kirksville prefer- 
ence and registration; that is, between school affiliation and school 
preference. The correlation is the same between preference for 
other schools and non-registration. In both cases 7=.268. Hence 
we need to examine the means of arrays to interpret the correla- 
tion. The continuous increase of means of arrays tells us that 
we are dealing with a variate that is reasonably Gaussian in char- 
acter. Moreover, when comparison is made of the three values of 
n secured from different sets of data the agreement is remarkably 
close. We have n=.268; »=.299; 1=.328. Karl Pearson inter- 
prets »=.07 as being significant when obtained by these methods. 
With this statement in mind the strength of the correlations noted 
above will be appreciated.” 
The same plan of procedure used in interpreting correlation 
under formula (II) holds also for formula (IIT) when the categoric 
or y-variate has more than two classes. 
VY. ANOTHER NEW METHOD OF DETERMINING CORRELATION 
We make use also of a method of correlation between a meas- 
ured character A, and a character B, of which only the percentage 
of cases wherein B exceeds or falls short of a given intensity is re- 
corded for each grade of A. We shall not go into so much detail 
in explaining this formula derived by Pearson since it has been in 
use for some time. Dr. Jasper N. Mallory made extensive use 
of this method of correlation in his doctor’s dissertation on THE 
Reration or Some Puystcan Derecrs To ACHIEVEMENT IN THE 
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. 
1. Explanation of method 
Pearson’s illustration is used to make’clear the problem. The 
example is as follows: we are given the ages A of all candidates 
who took an examination for a government position; the papers 
were merely marked passed or failed—capacity, B. We desire 
to correlate capacity and age. Then the Pearson formula is

where p is the mean value of the age group, which passed, meas- 
ured from the means of the two variates parallel to the age or 
x-axis. o; is the standard deviation of age; o2, the standard devia- 
tion of capacity, and

Pearson supposes a normal frequency surface in that the re- 
yression is linear. Now all sections of such a surface parallel to 
the x-y plane are contour lines that are similar ellipses. All 
vertical sections of this surface give normal curves.’ If a volume 
of the frequency surface is cut off by a vertical plane at a given 
value of the variate B (capacity) then the vertical through the 
centroid of this volume will in general cut both regression lines 
which may be considered as lying in the x-y plane. Let us take 
the point of section T with the regression line RR’ that contains 
the means of the B variate, (Fig. 3). Then if (p, G) be the coor- 
dinates of this point of section with the regression line, we have

Now measuring from the lower horizontal and left vertical lines 
we have p=GS—GM. But GS=LT is the mean of the A-va- 
riate of type B (in this case, passed) and GM is the mean of the 
whole age distribution; therefore, p is, in this particular case, the 
mean age of candidates who passed less the mean age of all can- 
didates. ; is the standard deviation of the whole age distribu- 
tion. Thus p and o; are readily found. 
But the B-variate is not given quantitatively. However, we 
know the percentage of B beyond the arbitrary point of division;

that is, the number of candidates who passed. If now we assume 
the B-variate to follow reasonably closely a Gaussian distribution, 
the percentage of the B-variate gives, by means of the probability 
integral tables, the ratio of y/o» for the distance from the mean 
at which the B-variate is divided, and then"

Thus there is a slight but sensible correlation between being a 
student with both residence and extra-mural study, and high 
residence grades. The foregoing problem illustrates the method 
in all cases; consequently, in succeeding chapters, only the essen- 
tials of the procedure will be given. 
VI. TrrracHoric FUNCTIONS 
1. Explanation of method 
Pearson works out a method of correlation for fourfold ta- 
bles.? A normal frequency surface has x and y-axes through the 
center. This surface is divided into four parts by planes at right 
angles tothe axes at distances h and k measured in terms of stand- 
ard deviations. 
  The volumes or frequencies in the four divisions NGM’, M’GN’, 
N’GM, and MGN are represented respectively by a, ¢, d, and b. 
If the frequency surface is normal, it is evident that b+d and e+d, 
owing to the position given the point of intersection of the traces 
of the dividing planes, cannot exceed }N. Pearson shows in an 
extensive article that r, the coefficient of correlation between the 
variates, is given by the equation 
d b+d c+d, (% fr" ae Soo te (GB KAW)... .2), 
where H and K are the ordinates of the normal curve of area N 
corresponding to the abscissae h and k and, consequently, dividing

equation (2) becomes

It is clear that Tn’ is the same function of (e+d)/N that Tn is of 
(b+d)/N. Everitt then works out extensive tables for the values 
of these functions, and it is seen that one table will do for both Tn 
and Tn’. It is also evident that (b+d) /N and (c+d) /N are the 
3(1—a) and $(1++a) of Sheppard’s Tables. 
This method is probably the most accurate known for deal- 
ing with fourfold tables. But it is long, and usually involves 
the use of Horner’s method in the solution of equations of high 
degree. However, the method is becoming well known and is 
made use of in a few cases in this study as a check on less exact 
methods of procedure. 
2. Application of method 
As an illustration of the use of tetrachoric functions for four- 
fold tables, let us take one of the problems arising in connection 
with our study in Chapter IV, Table X. This table deals with 
teachers of northeast Missouri and the order in which enrolments 
in residence and extra-mural study took place at’ Kirksville. If 
we use the same notation and rearrange the table, it assumes the 
following form: 
TABLE X

C lassification as to first enrolment

Type of study as explained in Chapter IV, Part One, means 
residence, correspondence, or extension study. Sometimes the 
last two are combined under the head of extra-mural or non-resi- 
dence study. Order of enrolment indicates the numerical se- 
quence of types of study. 
In the notation used under tetrachoric functions, a=1751; 
b=867; c=32;d=14. Therefore b+d=891; ce+d=46; N =2664.

Then d/N =.00525; (b+d)/N = $(1—a) =.01725; (e+d)/N= 
3(1—a’) =.33070. From Everitt’s Tables we have the’ following

Now formula (4) indicates that we are to take d/N equal to the 
algebraic sum of column products pair by pair from the rows (aT) 
and (a’T’) above, and with each product insert the factor r with 
an exponent equal to the subscript of T which heads the column.

We are interested only in values of r between plus and minus 1 
since plus 1 is the maximum of the absolute value of the coefficient 
of correlation. By Descartes’ rule of signsthere are notmore than 
five negative roots or more than one positive root. There is a 
positive root greater than 1 which must be excluded. Then any 
real root that will serve as a value of r must be negative and lie 
between —I and 0. By Horner’s method r=—.023, and Sturm’s 
theorem shows there is no other negative root within these limits. 
We therefore reach the remarkable conclusion that in the uni- 
verse of teachers, residence study is negatively correlated with 
first enrolment in extra-mural study. This result will be referred 
to again at the proper time and place. 
VII. Man square CONTINGENCY 
1. Explanation of method 
G. Udny Yule shows in his theory of statistics that 
1t (SN 
called “Pearson’s mean square contingency coefficient,’ is a 
measure of relationship between two attributes A and B. N 
denotes the number of observations. The meaning of 8 is made 
clear later. If A and B be divided into any number of classes 
(Am) and (Bn) and A be taken horizontally and B vertically, then 
(Am) and (Bn) denote the sum of frequencies in the mth column 
and nth row respectively. Now it is well known that dma= 
(AmBn)—(AmBn) is the measure of dependence of the two pairs 
of values of A and B where

lf d=0, the pair is completely independent. But, if A and B are 
not completely independent, this difference will not be-zero for 
all values of m and n. Thus (AmBn)p is appropriately called the 
independence values of Am and Bn, and is used in calculating a 
table of independence values for the frequencies in a given table. 
If we square dmn and form the ratio   
d?2mn mn (EBay and place x? == and then let C=y x2 
> AmBn)o Nw 
we have a: measure of the association between A and B. Now 
we may write 
_yl(AmBn)—(AmBn)oP_ 
  (AmBn)o 
> J AmBa)=2(AmBn) (AmBa)o—(AmBn)o?] _ 
(AmBn)o 
Am Bn)? > ee 2 AnBs) a (AmBs)o| ; 
Therefore x?= ae —22(AmBn) + ¥(AmBn)o. 
But the second term equals 2N, and the last term equals N.

Therefore x2= cae NAL notice qd Men eetoea ae Pein ee (2) 
If we let. S=> ty we may write (1) in the form mBn)o 
fs o= fe are ee hs (VD, 
which is the mean square contingency coefficient. 
This formula is a conservative statement of association, and 
is smaller when the attributes have fewer classes. The following 
considerations show that it is a conservative measure: 
(1) If dmn=0, then (AmBn)=(AmBn)o. Hence 
(AmBn)? 
(AmBn)y 
therefore, C=0 for complete independence. g=5 =2(AmBn)=N; 
(2) The association is greatest when 2d?mn is greatest or when 
S is greatest. But when S=0, even then C equals only 1. 
Now conceivably 8S might become infinite in either of two ways. 
The first one would be for 2(AmBn)? to become infinite, but it 
cannot because it is the sum of a finite number of finite terms, 
and must therefore always be far short of an infinite number. 
The second way would be for the factor
-P-A-G-E-32

(Am) (Bn) 
N 
Then S=%, and C=1. But this result is manifestly impossible 
unless either (Am), the sum of a column, or (Bn), the sum of a 
row, or both of them equal zero in 
(Am) (Bn) aa. 
But we can exclude from our table whole rows or columns that are 
zero. Hence (AmBn)» cannot be zero, and C cannot equal 1. So 
it is evident that C must be a conservative measure of relation- 
ship since S cannot begin to assume an infinite value. 
Pearson shows that 
(erly et) 
N 
is the correction to be subtracted from C?; where m equals the 
number of rows; n, the number of columns; and N, the total 
number of observations.!® (AmBn)y =0) 
2. Application of method 
The following problem taken from Chapter VII, Table 
XXXVIUI illustrates the procedure in calculating this coefficient. 
In this problem we have the order in which extra-mural students 
in three teachers colleges of Missouri enrolled in different types of 
study. We wish to find the association between type of study and 
order of enrolment among these extra-mural students.

The coefficient of contingency shows that order of enrolment

the type of study, for C is a conservative measure of relationship. 
However, the nature of the relationship is not yet clear. 
3. Interpretations 
If we now take in the original table rows (1) and (2), and 
form association ratios as we proceed from column marked “‘first”’ 
enrolment to column marked “third” enrolment, and then take 
rows (2) and (3), and proceed in the same manner, we get two 
sets of ratios, designated sets (1) and (2) which pass from tetrad 
to tetrad each containing two tetrads in this table. 
Set (1) Set (2) 
(a) ae .767 a = 748 
(b) aa = 200 san 809 
(c) in = 041 oo = 407 
In set (1) a>b>¢; in set (2) a>b, b<e. When passing from 
tetrad to tetrad we may say the signs run as follows: 
In set (1) ++ 
In set (2) +— 
The distribution fails by only a small amount in the last 
tetrad of being isotrophic. Set (1) shows, if we take the first two 
rows of our table, that residence is positively associated with first 
enrolment when extension and second enrolment are considered, 
and positively associated with second enrolment when extension 
and third enrolment are considered. Set (2) shows, if we take rows 
(2) and (3), that extension is positively associated with first en- 
rolment when correspondence and second enrolment are con- 
sidered, and slightly negatively associated with second enrolment 
when correspondence and third enrolment are considered. These 
results indicate that, as we pass from residence study, through 
extension to correspondence, the association in order of strength 
declines from first enrolment, through second enrolment, to third 
enrolment with only a slight turning back for extension and cor- 
respondence when we come to third enrolment.   
   
-P-A-G-E-35
ResipENCE ENROLMENT AND SCHOLASTIC STANDING 35 
These results indicate also that “type of study” is a con- 
tinuous function representing closeness of contact with the teacher, 
and that it increases ‘in strength from correspondence, through 
extension to residence; and that order of enrolment is a contin- 
uous function of established relations with a school; and that 
it increases in strength from third enrolment to first enrolment, 
and that with but the slight exception noted, these two functions 
. increase together. Hence we may say that affiliation with 
school (order of enrolments) is highly correlated with contact with 
teacher (type of study). 
Hereafter we need not go into such detailed.explanations when 
using the mean square contingency coefficients.

    CHAPTER IT 
CONSENSUS OF OPINION CONCERNING EXTRA-MURAL Stupy 
This chapter gives the consensus of opinion of administrators, 
teachers, and authors concerning the purpose and value of extra-’ 
mural instruction, its influence on residence enrolment, standards 
used for reporting residence and extra-mural grades, ability of 
students in different types of study, and relative amount of time 
required for instruction. 
I. PuRPOSES OF EX'TRA-MURAL STUDY 
1. As stated in bulletins 
Numerous reasons are assigned for offering extra-mural 
courses. A study of catalogs shows that many different reasons 
are given by forty-seven leading teachers colleges and normal 
schools in their published statements. Twenty-four schools 
state, “It (extra-mural study) extends the opportunity for an 
education to all;” eighteen, “It extends the means of education 
to those whose schooling has been interfered with;” fourteen, 
“Tt improves the teacher while in service;” ten, “It extends the 
possibilities of culture and academic training;” seven, “It helps 
to complete graduation requirements;”’ five, “It keeps the school 
in close relationship with the people of the state;’”’ and two, ‘It 
leads students to enroll for residence study.” Naturally the last 
named reason would not be advanced very often in a published 
statement. 
2. As given in a master’s thesis 
Mr. Clarence B. Collier wrote a master’s thesis at George 
Peabody College for Teachers on THE ADMINISTRATION OF Ex- 
TENSION Coursus IN Starm Norma ScuHoots. In this study 
when only the first or leading reply from sixty-four schools was 
used, Mr. Collier found the following reasons advanced for of- 
fering extra-mural courses; thirty-four schools state, “It aids 
teachers in service to improve in efficieney;”’ eight, “It aids teach- 
ers to secure higher certificates;” seven, “It takes normal schools 
to those who cannot go to school;” four, “It widens service of the 
normal schools;” three, “It improves the public schools;” three, 
“Tt enables students to continue school work;” two, “It directs 
teachers and others in use of spare time;” one, “It stimulates 
residence enrolment;”’ one, “It is good advertising;” and one, 
“Tt improves residence instruction.” These reasons for extra- 
mural study accord well with those given in published state- 
ments in bulletins. 
However, as stated, Mr. Collier listed only the first purpose 
assigned although individuals answering enumerated several 
others. There was nothing in the questionnaire used by Mr. 
Collier that called for a ranking of the relative values of purposes 
assigned. Mr. Collier was kind enough to allow access to his
-P-A-G-E-37
  
Restpence ENROLMENT AND SCHOLASTIC STANDING 37 
files of original data. If purposes are tabulated as of equal weight, 
the results are: forty-two replies state, “It aids teachers in 
service;” fifteen, ‘It stimulates residence enrolment;” eleven, 
“Tt aids teachers to secure higher certificates;” seven, “It takes 
normal schools to those who cannot go to school;”’ five, ‘It en- 
ables students to continue study and complete residence require- 
ments for certificates and diplomas;” four, “It widens service of 
normal schools;”” and three, ‘It improves the public schools.” 
There were four other types of answers ranging in numbers from 
one to two inclusive. 
When all answers are considered and placed on a par, the 
thought that extra-mural study leads to residence enrolment 
holds an important place. It is mentioned by 23.4 per cent of all 
directors and administrators who replied to the questionnaire. 
As a reason for offering extra-mural courses it stands second only 
to the purpose of “aiding teachers in service.” It is also to be 
observed that “aiding teachers in service” does not at all exclude 
the thought of getting teachers to enroll for residence study. In 
fact, some persons would say that the best way of improving . 
teachers who are in service is to induce them to attend school for 
residence study at least for summer sessions, and for the whole 
school year if possible. 
3. As shown in Kirksville questionnaire 
In order to secure the views of faculty members of teacher 
producing institutions on some phases of extra-mural study, the 
following list of questions was submitted to fifty-eight leading 
normal schools and teachers colleges that are state supported. 
a. Form of questionnaire

Dear Sir: 
At Kirksville State Teachers College we are making a study 
of correspondence and extension work. Your judgment and as- 
sistance are wanted. Will you help in this study by taking ten 
or fifteen minutes right now to fill out this blank so that it may 
reach us if possible by return mail. We shall be greatly obliged 
to you. Joun R. Kirk, President.

courses (Extra-mural courses mean correspondence or extension 
courses taken for credit) 
Please indicate the three chief reasons why your institution 
offers extra-mural study by placing the figures 1, 2, 3, in the paren- 
theses after the statements below which in order of importance 
express your first (1), second (2), and third (3) reasons respectively 
for offering such courses.

*To illustrate: Suppose that the size of the average class in residence is 15 students, that the class meets 5 one-hour periods per week for 12 weeks, and that the teacher spends an ad- tional 1.5 hours a day on the class in preparation of lessons and marking papers. Hence dur- ing the quarter the teacher spends 150 hours on this class—10 hours per student—and each student earns 5 term hours of credit. Hence the teacher gives 2 hours of time to each stu- 
dent for each term hour of credit earned. Now compute in your own way the time that is required of the teacher for a student to 
earn one term hour of credit in correspondence study, and one term hour of credit in extension study. If you prefer to use semester hour, do so, and indicate the fact by striking out the word ‘*term” in (a) above and inserting the word “semester”. In computing time required of teacher in correspondence study, include time used for pre- 
paring questions, marking papers, selecting reference material, ete. In computing time re- quired of teacher in extension study, include preparation of lessons, teaching of classes, marking of papers; and add to this from 3% to 14 of the time spent in making trips for the class, pro- portioning the amount added to the difficulty of the trip—long drives, exposure, loss of sleep, ete,

The letters a, b, c, d, e, f refer to the headings listed in (a) of the

It is seen that (a), “Improves teachers while in service’, 
heads the list as the chief reason for offering extra-mural 
courses, and also in the column of totals it has the largest frequen- 
cy. We observe that (c), “Leads to residence enrolment”’, stands 
lowest in the first column if (f) is excluded. Six persons, or 4 
per cent of those replying, mention this reason as the chief one for 
offering extra-mural courses; twenty-three persons, or 15.1 per 
cent of those replying, mention it as the reason of second order 
in importance; forty-three persons, or 28.3 per cent of those re- 
plying, mention it as the reason of third order in importance; 
whereas 72 persons, or 47.4 per cent of those replying, refer to ulti- 
mate residence enrolment as a reason for offering extra-mural 
study. 
Table I is not a bad showing for number (c) when it is re- 
called that none of the other headings excludes (¢) and might

In (b) the consensus of opinion is that extra-mural and resi- 
dence grades are about the same, with the weight of opinion 
slightly inclined to the view that extra-mural grades are higher. 
In (c) the view is expressed that the residence grades of persons 
having both residence and extra-mural credit are higher than the 
grades of those having residence study only. In (d) the view 
is expressed that extra-mural students have ability superior to 
that of students who have had residence study only. In (e) 
the consensus of opinion is that extra-mural study is decidedly 
inferior to residence study from the standpoint of helpfulness to 
the student. When this same question was referred to 148 stu- 
dents who had both residence and extra-mural study, 22 said that 
extra-mural study is superior; 95, equal; and 31, inferior to resi- 
dence study. 
III. Time REQUIRED OF TEACHER FOR A TERM HOUR OF 
CREDIT 
The following tabulation gives the consensus of opinion ex- 
pressed in section (C) of the questionnaire as to the time required 
of the teacher in the various types of study:

Let A represent the arithmetic mean, and M, the median; let 
r, e, and ¢, used as subscripts, denote residence, extension, and 
correspondence respectively. We then have 
Ar= 2.26 Ae =3.87 Ac=4.86 
Mr=2.00 Me =3.20 Mc =3.44 
It thus appears that residence instruction per term hour of credit 
requires the least time of the teacher; extension, next; and corre- 
spondence, the greatest amount of time. One hour of credit 
earned through extension study requires 1.71 times as much of the 
teacher’s time, measured in terms of means, as does one hour of 
credit earned through residence study, and likewise one hour of 
credit earned through correspondence study requires 2.15 times 
as much of the teacher’s time as one hour of credit earned through 
residence study.

The table above represents the views

Mr. Klein adds further, “Mr. Mallory, Secretary of the cor- 
respondence study department of the University of Chicago, has 
said that—‘For 10 years or more, one out of every five who have 
entered into student relations with the university have done so 
through the correspondence study department. Of the total 
number who have begun with correspondence study courses from 
18 to 20 per cent have come into residence. Out of the 230 stu- 
dents who received bachelor degrees, 47 had taken one or more 
majors by correspondence. All of the 47 averaged higher in their 
courses than did their classmates’.” Mr. Klein also says, “It is 
the common testimony of institutions that students in residence 
who have taken work by correspondence ordinarily rank in the 
upper fourth of their classes. In other words, the average of 
preparation, of earnestness, and of intellectual capacity of cor- 
respondence students, when compared with [sic] the average col- 
lege student in residence, is far higher.” 
According to Mr. Klein’s statement, 36 out of 580 corre- 
spondence students enrolled in the University of Kansas; that is, 
1 out of 16. Mr. Klein does not say whether or not these 36 
students were enrolled first in correspondence, and then, later, 
became residence students. If any of these had earlier residence 
enrolments, and surely a great many of the 580 correspondence 
students had such enrolments, there is no credit accruing in such 
cases to extra-mural enrolment in producing residence enrolment. 
But, granting that none of these 36 had ever had an earlier resi- 
dence enrolment, what standard for prospective students exists 
that recognizes 1 enrolment out of 16 prospects as a good show- 
ing? But in 1919, 7.9 per cent of those enrolled for correspond- 
ence study at the University of Kansas became residence students. 
The same questions apply to this statement as apply to the one 
preceding. If Mr. Mallory means that, at the University of 
Chicago, 1 student out of every 5 in residence had enrolled first 
in correspondence, and then, later, entered the University for resi- 
dence study this ratio would seem to be a good showing in favor 
of correspondence study as an influence leading to residence en- 
rolment. However, all such data given out should say explicitly 
that the extra-mural study came first if it is to be considered as a 
causative factor in leading to residence enrolment. Mr. Klein’s 
statement, as well as Mr. Mallory’s, leaves the impression that 
extra-mural study is an important factor in building up residence 
enrolments. 
Mr. Clarence B. Collier asks, “Is it not probable that the 
privilege of having pursued one course in extension and receiving 
credit at the normal school, will induce the teacher (student) to 
enter for residence work?” Mr. Collier also says, “When an in- 
structor from a normal school directs a group of teachers, many 
of them will see the need of further training and go to the normal

CHAPTER III 
RELATION Between RestpeNcH, CORRESPONDENCE, AND 
Extension ENROLMENTS 
In this chapter the following questions are considered: 
(1) When students have one type of study, are they likely 
to have other types also? (Type of study means either residence, 
correspondence, or extension study) 
(2) When students have two types of study, are they likely 
to have the third type also? 
(3) From what sources are correspondence and extension 
students drawn? 
I. Marerian USED 
This study begins with the State Teachers College at Kirks- 
ville. Let us consider all students enrolled in any type of study— 
residence, correspondence, or extension—for the four years June 
1919 to June 1923. In this period 76 students had correspond- 
ence study only; 172, had extension study only; 3196, had resi- 
dence study only; 10, had both correspondence and extension 
study, but not residence study; 201, had both extension and 
residence study, but not correspondence study; 455, had both cor- 
respondence and residence study, but not extension study; and 
finally, 131, had all three types of study. 
II. Mernop oF TREATMENT 
Use is now made of the theory of attributes such as is found 
in G. Udny Yule’s Inrropuction To THE THEORY OF SrarTIsTICs. 
The universe is the number of students enrolled at Kirksville 
during the years 1919-1923. 
1. Notation 
Let (C). =number who had correspondence study. 
(c) =number who had no correspondence study. 
(E) | =number who had extension study. 
(e) =number who had no extension study. 
(R) | =number who had residence study. 
(r) =number who had no residence study. 
N =total number of students in universe. 
(CE) =number who had correspondence and extension 
study. 
(CR) =number who had correspondence and residence 
study. 
(ER) =number who had extension and residence study. 
(CER) =number who had correspondence, extension, and 
residence study. 
Similar interpretations hold for (Ce), (Cr), (He), (Er), (Re), (Re), 
(CeR), (Cer), (CEr), (CER), (ceR), (cEr), and (cer). 
In accordance with the notation above we have Table V.

2. Consistency 
The first question that arises is whether or not the frequencies 
in Table V are consistent. The following four conditions must: 
be satisfied for these data to be consistent :! 
(a) (CE)= or >(C)+(E)+(R)—N—(RE)—(RC) 
(b) (CR)+(ER)—(EC)= or <(R) 
(ec) (CR)—(ER)+(CE)= or <(C) (d) —(CR)+(ER)+(CE)= or <(E) 
Substituting values from Table V, 
(a) gives 141>10 (b) gives 777<3983 
(ec) gives 395<672 (d) gives —118< 514 
Therefore conditions (a), (b), (c), and (d) are satisfied, and the 
frequencies observed in Table V are consistent. 
The remaining class frequencies can now be computed. The 
whole number of class frequencies equals 27, and the third order 
class frequencies, as also the positive class frequencies, are eight 
in number.? 
From Table V by the theory of attributes, we have Table VI. 
TABLE VI

  (Cr) =(C)—(CR) =86; 
Evidently (cer) would have to be zero, since there could not be a 
student without correspondence, extension, or residence study and 
this calculated value of (cer) is a further check on the accuracy of 
our data.

butes:

(6) (c) .=(Ee) +(ec) =(Re)+(re) 
  (7) @) =(Cr) +(er)  =(Er)+(er) These formulae are all satisfied by the frequencies in Tables V 
_and VI. Since every item in the work checks, we are now pre- 
pared to use any association formulae that may be useful for 
showing relations between attributes involved. 
3. Association formulae 
It is necessary to make use of both complete and partial 
association formulae in the analysis of data in Tables V and VI. 
By Yule’ if A and B denote any two characteristics, and a and 
b, their opposites, the following relations indicate positive associa- 
tion between A and B:   
  
  (AB) | (A) (AB) — (B) Oar & sere ~ (AB) — (Ab) (AB) © (aB) ® “Bye @) are When these signs are reversed, there is negative association; when 
equal, independence. 
The interpretations are as follows: in (1) the proportion of 
A’s among the B’s is greater than the proportion of A’s in the 
whole material represented by N. A similar interpretation holds 
for (2). In (8) the proportion of A’s among the B’s is greater 
than the proportion of A’s among the not B’s. A similar inter- 
pretation holds for (4). It is generally preferable to use formulae 
(3) and (4) since they draw their material from an attribute and 
its contrary in the same universe, and in this way exhibit the full 
strength of the association. 
In partial association A and B are attributes in a universe 
C, in which C itself is an attribute. The formulae quoted above 
now become: ‘

The interpretations are as follows: in (1) the proportion of A’s

among the (BC)’s is greater than the proportion of A’s among the 
C’s. A similar interpretation holds for (2). In (3) the propor- 
tion of A’s among the (BC)’s is greater than the proportion of A’s 
among the (b-minor C)’s. A similar interpretation holds for (4). 
III. AssocraTIoN BETWEEN TYPES OF ENROLMENT 
1. Complete association 
a. Application to material 
Let us take as our material, the whole universe of enrolled 
students, N, as found in Tables V and VI. 
(a) Find the association between correspondence and ex- 
tension enrolments. 
By formula (1) under complete association we have: 
(1) The ratio of extension students to all students = 
(B)_ 514 N 4241 
(2) The ratio of correspondence-extension students to cor- 
respondence students = 
~ apn? per cent. 
But 21>12.1. Hence correspondence, and extension enrolments 
are positively associated in the universe of students. The pro- 
portion of correspondence students who take extension study is 
nearly twice as great as the proportion of students at large who 
take extension study. 
The association between extension and correspondence enrol- 
ments could also be found. But formulae (1) and (2), and (3) 
and (4) show that if C is positively associated with HE, then E is 
also positively associated with C, but the associations are not 
always of the same strength. In the data under consideration 
extension, and correspondence enrolments have almost the same 
strength of association as do correspondence, and extension en- 
rolments. However, the numerical calculation need not be set 
down. 
(b) Find the association between residence, and correspond- 
ence enrolments. 
(1) The ratio of residence students to all students = 
(R) _ 3983 
N 4241 
(2) The ratio of residence-correspondence students to cor- 
respondence students = 
(CR) _ 586 
© 672 
But 93.9>87.2. Hence residence, and correspondence enrol- 
ments are negatively associated in the universe of students. Like- =12.1 per cent. 
——— = 93.9 per cent. 
asa = 87.2 per cent.
-P-A-G-E-49
  
RestpENCcE ENROLMENT AND SCHOLASTIC STANDING 49 
wise correspondence, and residence enrolments are negatively as- 
sociated by about the same strength. 
(c) Find the association between residence and extension 
enrolments. 
(1) The ratio of residence students to all students = 
(R) _ 3983 N =p 8 .9 per cent. 
(2) The ratio of residence-extension students to extension 
students = 
(RE) _ 332 _ “(H) aid 65.8 per cent. 
But 65.8<93.9. Hence residence, and extension enrolments are 
negatively associated in the universe of students. 
In (b) residence enrolment is negatively associated with cor- 
respondence enrolment. This association indicates that the 
proportion of residence students in the universe at large is greater 
than the proportion of residence students coming from all cor- 
respondence students alone. However, this result might have 
been anticipated since the universe is limited to all students: resi- 
dence; correspondence; and extension, for the years 1919-1923. 
Moreover, the residence enrolment is about seven times as great 
as the larger of the other two types, and R differs so little from 
N that there is but little chance for an association between resi- 
dence and correspondence enrolments to show, unless that asso- 
ciation were practically perfect. The proportion of students 
who have had correspondence, and extension study without resi- 
dence study is relatively so small that the universe of students 
is exceptionally favorable to a high ratio for residence enrolment. 
(d) It is also instructive to find the association between 
correspondence and residence enrolment. 
By formula (1), 
(C) _ 672 _ (CR) 586 N daa 15.9 per cent, and ~~ TR) 73983 
But 14.9<15.9. Hence the association between correspondence 
and residence enrolments is, as might have been expected, nega- 
tive. This result shows that the proportion of correspondence 
students from the whole universe is but slightly greater than the 
proportion among residence students alone. But by using formula 
(3) as suggested previously the strength of the association is more 
evident. It gives 
(CR) 586 a (Cr) _ 86 “(R) 739837 14.9 per renal and ~—~ AG os 
But 14.9<33.3 and the negative association is stronger than it 
at first appeared from formula (1). This result shows that the = 14.9 per cent. 
  
=33.3 per cent.
-P-A-G-E-50
  es 50 Tue ReLation oF ExTRA-MURAL STUDY TO 
proportion ot correspondence students among residence students 
is about one-half as great as the proportion of correspondence 
students among those who have had no residence study. Never- 
theless, large numbers of correspondence enrolments come from 
among those who have also been enrolled in residence. Similar 
observations hold in connection with the association between 
residence and extension enrolments, except that extension enrol- 
ments are not so frequently drawn from among residence students 
as are correspondence enrolments. 
b. Conclusions 
From this discussion three outstanding facts appear: (1) 
there is a very strong positive association between correspondence 
and extension enrolments; in other words, correspondence stu- 
dents tend to take extension study, and extension students tend 
to. take correspondence study. (2) Correspondence students, 
and to a lesser degree extension students, consist of those who 
have had residence study also. (3) The negative association 
between residence and correspondence enrolments, and between 
residence and extension enrolments can to a large extent be ac- 
counted for by the fact that residence students so largely make 
up the universe of students that the proportion of residence stu- 
dents in the whole universe naturally would be larger than the 
proportion of residence students from among either correspond- 
ence or extension enrolments. Hence we are not justified in say- 
ing that correspondence, and extension enrolments restrain resi- 
dence enrolments. 
2. Partial association 
a. Application to material 
Let us now apply partial association formulae to the mate- 
rial. 
(a) Find the association between correspondence and ex- 
tension enrolments in the universe of residence students. 
(1) R—universe 
(1) The ratio of extension, among correspondence students = 
(CER) _131_ ie (GR) =5e9 722-4 per cent. 
(2) The ratio of extension, among the non-correspondence 
students= 
(cER) 201 
(eR) 3397 
But 22.4>6. Hence correspondence, and extension enrolments 
are strongly associated in the universe of residence students. 
(b) Find the association between residence and correspond- 
ence enrolments in the universe of extension students.

But 92.6>54. Hence residence, and ee em are posi- 
tively associated in the universe of extension students. 
(c) Find the association between residence and extension 
enrolments in the universe of correspondence students. 
(3) C—universe 
(1) The ratio of residence, among extension students = 
(CER) _ 131 _ CE) Sia 92.6 per cent. 
(2) The ratio of residence, among non-extension students = 
(CeR) _ 455 “(Gey BB1 =85.7 per cent. 
But 92.6>85.7. Hence the association between residence and 
extension study is positive in the universe of correspondence stu- 
dents. However, this association is not nearly as strong as that 
between residence and correspondence students in the universe 
of extension students. 
b. Conclusions 
Correspondence, and extension enrolments are strongly as- 
sociated in the universe of residence students; residence, and 
correspondence enrolments are strongly associated in the universe 
of extension students; and residence, and extension enrolments are 
positively associated in the universe of correspondence students. 
Then, in so far as the actual status of enrolments is concerned, 
residence serves as a connecting link between correspondence and 
extension enrolments; extension, as a connecting link between 
residence and correspondence enrolments; and correspondence, as 
a connecting link between residence and extension enrolments. 
In other words, when a student has had two of these types of 
study, there is a strong probability of his having had the third 
type also. 
IV. Summary AND CONCLUSIONS 
Thus far without any reference to the type which preceded and 
the causal factors involved, enrolments in different types of study 
have been considered merely as accomplished facts. Both com- 
plete, and partial association formulae show that correspondence,
-P-A-G-E-52
  52 Tur RELATION OF ExTRA-MURAL STUDY TO 
and extension enrolments are strongly associated. The results 
are not conclusive concerning the association between residence 
and correspondence enrolments, or between residence and ex- 
tension enrolments. In the whole universe these associations are 
negative, but they can be accounted for by the constitution of the 
universe. The association between residence and correspondence 
enrolments is positive in the universe of extension students; and 
the association between residence and extension enrolments is 
positive in the universe of correspondence students. But here 
- also, the universe of prospective students is too limited. 
Moreover, since extension serves as a connecting link between 
residence and correspondence enrolments, and correspondence 
serves as a connecting link between residence and extension en- 
rolments, both a correspondence and an extension enrolment 
are needed to predict with any certainty a residence enrolment 
also. However, correspondence students, and, to some extent 
extension students, consist largely of persons who have had resi- 
dence study. 
From the preceding discussion these facts follow: 
(1) Correspondence and extension enrolments are strongly 
associated. Hence correspondence students tend to take ex- 
tension study and vice versa. 
(2) Students who have had both correspondence and ex- 
tension study will, in general, have residence study also. 
(3) Correspondence students and, to a less degree, extension 
students consist of those who had residence study also. 
It is significant that extra-mural students consist chiefly of 
students who have had residence instruction also. But it is clear 
that only a preliminary survey has been made of the questions at 
issue. There are factors involved which are more fundamental 
than is the relation between types of enrolment. When a student 
has been enrolled in two or three types of study at an institution, 
the order in which the enrolments took place becomes very im- 
portant when the type of enrolment which led to the other types 
is to be determined. In this chapter these factors have been 
left out of account, and the universe selected is too limited.

CHAPTER IV 
INFLUENCE OF EXTRA-MURAL Stupy oN Rustpence ENROLMENT 
In this chapter the following questions are considered: 
(1) Through what type of study do residence students have 
their first connection with a school? : 
(2) Through what type of study do extra-mural students 
have their first connection with a school? 
(3) Does -extra-mural study increase residence enrolment? 
(4) Are extra-mural students better prospective residence 
students than are public school teachers at large? 
I. WHOLE UNIVERSE OF STUDENTS, (1919-1920) 
1. Description of universe 
The consideration of the relation between extra-mural study 
and residence enrolment is now based upon another set of data. 
In this chapter both the residence and extra-mural students at 
Kirksville are taken for the year June, 1919 to June, 1920. These 
data differ materially from those in Chapter III. The data used 
in Chapter III apply to the four years from 1919-1923, and take 
no account of the order in which residence and extra-mural enrol- 
ments took place. The data in the preceding chapter, and ac- 
companying interpretations merely recorded existing facts and 
status of enrolments with no particular effort to get at primal or 
causation factors which would show the dependence of one type 
of study on another type. 
Type of study means residence, correspondence, or extension 
study. The last two are sometimes combined under the single 
head of extra-mural or non-residence study. A similar meaning 
holds for type of student. Order of enrolment indicates the nu- 
merical sequence of type of study as first, second, or third. Some- 
times it is used to indicate no enrolment at all. 
2. Relation between type of student and first enrolment 
a. Expressed by coefficient of association 
We shall now find in the universe of students for the year 
1919-1920 the association between being a residénce student and 
first enrolment in residence, and also between being an extra- 
mural student and first enrolment in residence. 
Universe of students, (1919-1920) 
Let (R) =number of residence students. 
(vr) =number of non-residence students. 
(A) =number of students with first work done in residence. 
(a) =number of students with first work not done in 
residerice. 
Then (RA) =number of residence students with first study done 
in residence. 7 
(Ra) =number of residence students with first study not 
done in residence.

  54 THE RELATION OF EXTRA-MURAL STUDY TO 
(rA) =number of non-residence students with first study

(ra) =number of non-residence students with first study

Where only two attributes are involved, a coefficient of associa- 
tion can be used instead of association formulae. Yule gives this 
coefficient as 
g= 8) (ab)—(Ab) (aB) 
(AB) (ab) (Ab) (aB)’ 
where A is a first attribute and a, its opposite; B, a second at- 
‘tribute and b, its opposite. 
Data to which this formula applies can be conveniently ar- 
ranged in a table. The following tabulation gives the data for 
Kirksville State Teachers College in terms of the notation em- 
ployed for the universe of students for 1919-1920:

This coefficient shows that residence students are very strongly 
associated with first work in residence. It indicates that nearly 
all residence students have their first connection with the school 
through residence study. Were Q=1, the association between 
A and R would be complete, and all students of the institution 
would have had residence enrolment first. The association of R 
with a, that is, the association of residence students with first 
enrolment in extra-mural study, is Q=—.923. This coefficient 
shows that among students in general the probability is very great 
that a given residence student did not have extra-mural study 
first. Now the significant fact is not that there is positive asso- 
ciation between residence students and first enrolment in resi- 
dence, for we should expect this, but that the association is so 
nearly perfect. If the association coefficient had been .077 larger, 
then no residence student would have had extra-mural study = 923

first. If (Ra), the number of residence students with extra-mural 
study first, were equal to zero instead of 16, then Q would equal 
one, and the association would be complete. 
b. Expressed by association formulae and by percent- 
ages 
Association formulae (3) and (4) of Chapter III may be used 
for getting a more detailed understanding of the relations involved.

From (1) it follows: first, that residence students and first enrol- 
ment in residence are positively associated; second, that 83 per- 
sons out of each 100 who had in our universe first work in resi- 
dence were enrolled as residence students in 1919-1920; third, that 
the ratio of residence students (1919-1920) having had first work 
in residence to all students having first work in residence is five 
times as great as the ratio of residence students having first work 
in extra-mural study to all students having first work in extra- 
mural study. From (2) it follows: first, that residence students 
and first enrolments are positively associated; second, that 99 
persons out of each 100 in residence had residence work first; third, 
that 78 persons out of each 100 enrolled in extra-mural work 
(1919-1920) began with residence study. These figures show 
that only 22 persons out of each 100 who were enrolled in extra- 
mural courses in 1919-1920 had their first connection with the 
school through extra-mural study. 
Let us write down from Table VII the two ratios:

From (3) the ratio of residence students, with first enrolment in 
residence, to all residence students is .988. From (4) the ratio 
of residence students, with first enrolment not in residence, to all 
non-residence students is .044. Then for the year 1919-1920 the 
ratio of residence students, with first enrolment in residence, to all 
residence students is 22.5 times as great as the ratio of residence

students, with first enrolment in extra-mural, study, to all extra- 
mural students. 
3. Comparisons ‘ 
It is thus seen that, if extra-mural instruction is furnished to 
approximately 23 students, one of them will come into residence 
study after having had extra-mural study first. Moreover, ratio 
(4) shows that 361 different extra-mural students were enrolled, 
but among the residence students only 16 were enrolled who had 
had extra-mural study first. Accordingly ordinary common 
sense would indicate that residence enrolment is not being ad- 
vanced perceptibly through extra-mural study. These condi- 
tions are found in an institution that has been offering large num- 
bers of extra-mural courses for the past ten years. 
But some one will say here, just as it was suggested for the 
universe in Chapter ITT, that the residence enrolment is so large that 
the ratio (RA) /(R) is bound to be very large, and that of course 
the association between R and A is positive. However, it was 
pointed out that the significant fact is not that the association is 
positive, but that it is so nearly perfect. Nevertheless, there is 
some merit in the contention, and to meet the objection the uni- 
verse is now limited to the students of 1919-1920 who have had at 
any time both residence and extra-mural study. These students 
are acquainted with both types of study; hence, the order of their 
enrolments in college should be significant.

EXTRA-MURAL STUDY, (1919-1920)

ments 
a. Expressed by coefficient of association 
Each student is now counted once in each kind of enrolment. 
Kind of enrolment means residence or non-residence enrolment. 
In the universe chosen 
Let (R)  =number of residence enrolments. 
(r) =number of non-residence enrolments. 
(F) | =number of enrolments coming first. 
(f) =number of enrolments not coming first. 
Then (RF) =number of residence enrolments coming first. 
(rF) =number of non-residence enrolments coming 
first. 
(Rf) =number of residence enrolments not coming 
first. 
(rf) | =number of non-residence enrolments not com-

In this universe also, there is almost perfect association between 
residence enrolments and first enrolments. It is not surprising 
that the association is positive and large, but, if extra-mural study 
were functioning appreciably in bringing students into residence, 
Q would fall considerably below unity in this universe which ° 
contains only students who have had both residence and extra- 
mural study. 
b. Expressed by association formulae and by percentages 
Another picture of the relations involved is obtained by using 
the association ratios. We have: Q= 996 
(1) oe per cent 
(2): | Me OS aes cenit @ 501 
But 96>4. Hence there is a very strong positive association 
as previously observed between R and F. Out of every hundred 
students who have had both types of study, 96 had residence study 
first and 4 had extra-mural study first. Furthermore, it is called 
to mind that we are not dealing with students en masse but with 
just those who have had both residence and extra-mural study. 
2. Observations 
But again some may think that our universe is still too nar- 
row to permit extra-mural study to make a fair showing in its 
influence on residence enrolments; whereas others may hold that 
to bring into residence one student out of every 23 to 25 who take 
extra-mural study is a better showing than is made by most agen- 
cies when dealing with fair samples of eligible, prospective school 
populations. : 
Were it possible to select two or three thousand persons who 
are likely to attend college, and approximately an equal number, 
who have extra-mural study without residence study, then these 
samples of prospective college students could be observed through 
a period of years, and the direct influence of extra-mural study on 
residence enrolment could be determined very definitely by asso-

ciation formulae. However, for immediate purposes this direct 
plan is manifestly impossible. But this condition can be ap- 
proximated by a plan which meets the objection offered to a uni- 
verse that may have seemed to some too restricted. The writer 
has, therefore, extended the study to include a wider universe 
that represents, he believes, a typical teachers college prospective 
student constituency. 
III. UNIveRsE OF PUBLIC SCHOOL THACHERS OF NORTHEAST 
Missourt, (1921-1922) 
1. Description of universe 
The Kirksville State Teachers College has been offering both 
correspondence and extension courses since 1913, and has enrolled 
in credit courses 1072 different extra-mural students from 1914 to 
1922, giving persons who have desired it, the opportunity to take 
extra-mural study; therefore, the influence of extra-mural study 
on residence enrolment is considered from the standpoint of teach- 
ers in service in northeast Missouri in the year 1921-1922. There 
were 3457 public school teachers in the 25 counties comprising 
the First District in which the Kirksville State Teachers College 
is situated.2 By a questionnaire to county and city superintend- 
ents the names and addresses of 2664 teachers were secured. This 
number constitutes 74.1 per cent of the whole teaching population, 
and, doubtless, is a fair sample. Moreover, the Teachers College 
at Kirksville is a state institution for preparing teachers, and 
nearly all the persons who attend it become teachers. Hence it 
appears that the teachers of northeast Missouri constitute a fair 
sample of eligible, prospective students for the Teachers College. 
Also metes and bounds are set that make this sample of teachers 
conform as nearly as possible to the direct and almost ideal plan 
of procedure that was proposed, but which for obvious reasons had 
to be abandoned. 
Now in as much as the influence of extra-mural study has been 
operating since 1913, and in as much as only 97 of the 2664 teach- 
ers were enrolled in residence before 1914, it is evident that the 
sample selected contains a representative part of the teachers 
of each year between 1914 and 1921 that entered and were eligible 
to enter the State Teachers College at Kirksville. 
2. Factors affecting residence enrolment 
In this problem as set, a point of beginning is needed before 
which everything is barred save the one item of residence enrol- 
ments before that date. Those who enrolled before 1914, es- 
pecially if they have not been in school since, reduce slightly the 
influence of extra-mural study on residence enrolment, in as 
much as they increase first enrolments in residence without offering 
appreciable opportunity for extra-mural study in the period be- 
fore 1914. But these early residence enrolments total only 97, 
?Report of State Superintendent of Public Schools, 1921.
-P-A-G-E-59
  
ResmENCE ENROLMENT AND SCHOLASTIC STANDING 59 
and are probably more than offset by a counter influence repre- 
sented by the large number of untrained teachers that enter the 
profession each year and have as yet had little or no opportunity 
to attend college at Kirksville. The same reasoning applies to 
those teachers under 21 years of age who do not have sufficient 
high school credits to enter college. Doubtless, these factors are 
pronounced among new teachers of the year 1920-1921 who have 
had no chance or incentive as yet to attend college. In these 
ways the number in the universe of teachers is increased and, 
since enrolment in residence has not yet begun to take place 
among the young, untrained teachers, the association between 
residence and first enrolments will be materially reduced. How- 
ever, a second tabulation is made in which the 97 teachers en- 
rolled in residence before 1914 are excluded entirely, but the fac- 
tors unfavorable to the association of residence with first enrolment 
in residence are retained. 
3. Data and notation 
From the enrolment files of the State Teachers College 
the type, and order of enrolment, time of enrolment, and number 
of hours of credit for these 2664 teachers were looked up and tabu- 
lated. All these items were considered from the standpoint of 
the Kirksville State Teachers College alone. For obvious reasons 
earlier and later connections with other colleges were wholly disre- 
garded. The tabulation is as follows:

(re) =number without residence study whose first en-

(2) Tabulation for universe of teachers 
The application of this notation to the material in Table IX 
gives the following table for the universe of teachers in northeast 
Missouri for the year 1921-1922:

2= (HR) (er) (x) (eR) ~ (4) (1751) (82) (867) . 
The association between R and E is small and negative. When 
the whole universe of teachers in northeast Missouri is considered, 
Q shows that there is a slight negative association between resi- 
dence study at Kirksville and first enrolment in extra-mural study. 
In other words, when teachers at large are considered some new, 
and some old, some students and some graduates of other col- 
leges, some just graduated from -high school and some who have 
been students at Kirksville, it is found that a teacher who begins 
study as an extra-mural student at Kirksville is less likely to enroll 
there for residence study than is a teacher selected at random 
from the universe of teachers exclusive of those who have had 
residence study at Kirksville. 
The test just applied is surely a fair one. Teachers and high 
school graduates who expect to become teachers represent the 
universe of prospective students. The association between R 
and E in the universe of teachers should have been positive if 
there had been any appreciable influence exerted by extra-mural 
study on residence enrolment. 
b. Extra-mural study and earlier residence enrolment 
The influence of first enrolment in residence on later extra- 
mural study is now considered.

By using this notation and applying it to the material in 
Table [X we have the following table:

Extra-mural study is strongly associated with earlier residence en- 
rolment; therefore, extra-mural enrolments consist chiefly of per- 
sons who have had earlier residence study. -This result fits in 
perfectly with that obtained in connection with Table X. 
Accordingly in the universe of teachers there is (1), a slight 
negative association between residence study and first enrolment 
in extra-mural study; (2), a strong positive association between 
extra-mural study and first enrolment in residence. 
Now let us exclude the 97 teachers referred to in Table IX 
who had enrolled at Kirksville before 1914. This proposal is 
more than fair to extra-mural study considered as a factor in ad- 
vancing residence enrolment, since many of the 97 teachers who 
had taken residence study before 1914, had residence study again 
after 1914 before they ever had taken any extra-mural study. 
However, the whole group of 97 is excluded. Table IX now be-

in any material way from those found in Tables X and XJ; in fact, 
these latter values strengthen appreciably our interpretation of 
results found in Tables X and XI. 
5. Summary and comparisons 
Under Tables X and Xa the values of the coefficients of asso- 
ciation are respectively Q=—.062 and Q=—.0026. These co- 
efficients show a slight negative association between residence 
study and first enrolment in extra-mural study. They indicate 
that teachers of northeast Missouri, taken at large, are slightly 
more likely to attend the Teachers College at Kirksville than are 
students who had extra-mural study first. It is also seen that, 
if the 97 teachers who had residence study before 1914 are excluded, 
the association is still slightly negative. 
To be sure the negative association is very small, and also 
(RE) and (rE) are smaller numbers than are desirable, since 
small changes especially in (RE) affect results greatly. On the 
other hand, use is made of all available data in connection with 
2664 public school teachers of northeast Missouri, where their 
records have been scrutinized for attendance, type of study, and 
order of enrolment in a teachers college that has been offering 
extra-mural study on a large scale since 1913. The sample of 
teachers used is for the year 1921-1922. It includes persons who 
were attending school at Kirksville, or were eligible to attend 
in every year from 1914 to 1922. It is a mosaic of the cross sec- 
tions of each year, and is a good substitute for the ideal condition 
mentioned earlier which would have required a large sample 
of high school graduates interested in teaching, and about an 
equal number of extra-mural students who had never had resi- 
dence study. However, if such data were available for a number 
of years, there is all reason to believe extra-mural students would 
make a poorer showing in promoting residence enrolment than is 
made in our sample. Substantiation of this statement appears 
from the following considerations: (re)=1751 in Table X, and 
Q increases directly as (re) increases. But 
gg — Sb igen Be) che 
~ (RE) (re)+(Re) (rE) © 
Now (re) included hundreds of new, inexperienced teachers who 
have not had a chance to attend college, some of them are not 
even high school graduates and are not prepared to attend college, 
whereas others included in (re) are graduated from other colleges, 
and are for this reason eliminated as prospective college students 
at Kirksville. These types of individuals are congregated es- 
pecially in that cross section of our sample that represents the 
new teachers of the year 1921-1922. They increase Q. To illus- 
trate: if (re), which represents teachers who have had no study 
of any type at Kirksville, were doubled, Q would be positive in- 
stead of negative, and would equal .28 which would represent a 
strong positive association. —.062 in Table X. 
 
-P-A-G-E-64
  64 Tue RELATION or ExTRA-MURAL STUDY TO 
From the foregoing considerations it appears that the uni- 
verse of prospective students has been extended even beyond its 
legitimate sphere, and that this extension increases mainly (re) 
which increases Q, the coefficient of association between residence 
study and first enrolment in extra-mural study, and that, if extra- 
mural study had any perceptible influence on residence enrol- 
ment, Q should be strongly positive instead of slightly negative. 
Moreover, from Tables XI and XIa it is seen that extra-mural 
study is strongly associated with first study in residence. It 
follows that nearly all extra-mural students have residence study 
first. | 
6. Intensity of associations 
Let us examine the intensity of association between attri- 
butes in the universe of teachers by comparing ratios. By Yule if 
(RE) | > (Re) (E) |< ()’ 
then R and E have respectively positive association, no associ- 
ation, or negative association.’ By referring to Table X, we have:     
(RE) 4 (Re) | 867... () “Ey = ag = 20% “ey asre= 232 
(Eee GE) dee 2) “ey gar = 0159s “Ey Saag 0179 
Therefore in both cases residence study has a small negative as- 
sociation with first enrolment in extra-mural study. The ratios in 
(1) show that the proportion of residence students among all those 
who had taken extra-mural study first is less than the proportion 
of residence students among all those who did not take extra- 
mural study first. The ratios in (2) show that the proportion of 
those who had taken extra-mural study first among all those who 
_ had taken residence study is less than the proportion of those who 
had taken extra-mural study first among all those who had no 
residence study. Likewise from Table XI with a notation dif- 
. fering from that in Table X, we have: 
(3) (RE) BATB Ss =.790; (Re) _ 694 
22 F(Eer 2195 Te mi 
Therefore the association between extra-mural study and first en- 
rolment in residence is strongly positive. The ratios in (3) show 
that the proportion of first enrolments in residence among extra- 
mural students is much greater than the proportion of first enrol- 
ments in residence among all those teachers who did not have ex- 
tra-mural study. = 284

The ratios in (1), (2), and (3) lead to the same conclusions, 
and furnish the same interpretations of facts as resulted from the 
use of coefficients of association. 
IV. CoMPaRtsONS OF RATIOS 
There are some interesting comparisons between ratios drawn 
from the universe of teachers for 1921-1922, and the whole uni- 
verse of residence and extra-mural college students for the year 
1919-1920. 
(4) Among the teachers of 1921-1922 who had both resi- 
dence and extra-mural study, (the number with extra-mural study 
first)-: (the number with residence study first)= 14/173=.081. 
(b) Among the students of 1919-1920 who had both residence 
and extra-mural study, (the number with extra-mural study first) 
:-(the number with residence study first) =20/481=.042. There- 
fore, for those with both types of study, the ratio of teachers with 
extra-mural study first, to teachers with residence study first, is 
twice as great as the ratio of students with extra-mural study 
first, to students with residence study first. This result further 
strengthens the conclusions drawn from the sample of teachers 
in as much as persons with extra-mural study first when com- 
pared with persons with residence study first, ave twice as num- 
erous in the universe of teachers as in the universe of students. 
(a,) Under the conditions imposed in (a) (the number with 
extra-mural study first)--(the number with extra-mural study on- 
ly) =14/32=.438. 
(by) Under the conditions imposed in (b) (the number with 
extra-mural study first)-(the number with extra-mural study 
only) =20/66=.303. It is also observed that the number of per- 
sons with extra-mural study first, when compared with those hay- 
ing extra-mural study only, is greater among teachers of a given 
year than among students of a given year’s enrolment. This re- 
sult supports also the conclusions drawn from the sample of teach- 
ers. 
(az) Among the teachers of 1921-1922, 46 had taken extra- 
mural study first, and 867 had taken residence study first. Then 
(the number with extra-mural study first)--(the number with 
residence study first) =46 /867 =.053. 
(be) Among the students of 1919-1920, 85 had taken ex- 
tra-mural study first, and 1520 had taken residence study first. 
Then (the number with extra-mural study first)+-(the number 
with residence study first) =85/1520=.056. In (ae) and (be) the 
ratios were not confined to those who had taken both residence and 
extra-mural study as it was, in the two preceding comparisons. 
Here it is found that the ratio of persons, with extra-mural study 
first, to those, with residence study first, is almost exactly the 
same among teachers for 1921-1922 as among students in all 
types of. study during 1919-1920. This result furnishes further 
justification for the choice of the sample of teachers, and for the
-P-A-G-E-66
  66 Tue Revation or ExTRA-MURAL StupyY TO 
conclusions drawn therefrom. In all probability the sample of 
teachers has shown for extra-mural study a stronger influence 
on residence enrolment than actually exists. 
V. CORRELATION BETWEEN RESIDENCE STUDY AND FIRST 
ENROLMENT IN EXTRA-MURAL STUDY—UNIVERSE OF TEACHERS 
Finally, if any one should question the validity of associa- 
tion formulae and of coefficients of association, in the problems of 
this chapter, another method of proof involving tetrachorie func- 
tions may be used. This method is probably the most accurate 
one known for dealing with fourfold tables. The process is long 
and difficult, but it applies directly to the tables of this chapter. 
Since Table X holds a position of prime importance in this chapter 
tetrachoric functions are used in finding r, the coeficient of corre- 
lation between residence study and first enrolment in extra-mural 
study. This method is explained in Chapter I, and Table X fur- 
nishes the illustrative problem, so that we merely give the equa- 
tion from which r is determined. It is as follows: 
r+ 36515 + 95714 + 2.89r3—2.808r?—6.07r—.137 = 0. 
Whence r=—.023, with probable error of .021. 
The conclusion reached is identical with that obtained by 
use of coefficients of association. Restated it is as follows: resi- 
dence study at Kirksville in the universe of teachers has a slight 
negative correlation with first enrolment in extra-mural study. 
VI. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 
The following outstanding facts appear to be established: 
(1) Nearly all residence students have their first connection 
with the school through residence study. 
(2) The great majority of extra-mural students have resi- 
dence instruction before they take up extra-mural study. 
(3) Extra-mural study does not increase residence enrol- 
ment appreciably. This fact is apparent from the consideration 
of: first, the universe of students for 1919-1920; second, the 
universe of students for 1919-1920 who had both residence and 
extra-mural study; third, the universe of teachers for 1921-1922. 
(4) Extra-mural students who have had no residence in- 
struction in a school are hardly as good prospective residence 
students as are public school teachers, chosen at random, who also 
have had no residence instruction. 
It is especially significant that nearly all residence students 
have their first connection with a school through residence study, 
and that the great majority of extra-mural students have resi- 
dence instruction before taking up extra-mural instruction. 
Extra-mural study does not affect residence enrolment appreciably, 
but residence study affects extra-mural enrolment a great deal. 
These facts are directly opposed to the consensus of opinion of 
educators as expressed in Chapter II, Part One. It is even more 
surprising that public school teachers constitute a better pros- 
pective student universe than do extra-mural students.

CHAPTER V 
Tue Unrverse or Hiau ScHoon GRADUATES AS A BASIS OF 
COMPARISON 
In this chapter the following questions are considered: 
(1) Is there a well defined relation between school preference 
of high school graduates and later college registration? 
(2) Is there a relation between school preference and time 
elapsed from high school graduation to college registration? 
I. Nenp or A STANDARD 
A standard of measurement is essential for purposes of com- 
parison. If the relation between extra-mural study and residence 
enrolment is found, however small this relationship proves to be, 
one could maintain that it is entirely satisfactory unless there is a 
recognized basis of comparison that may be accepted as a stand- 
ard of measurement. Therefore we delay the approach to our 
study, and seek to find a basis of comparison in a recognized uni- 
verse of prospective students. 
The universe of high school graduates will be carefully stud- 
ied. This universe is selected because the prospective student 
must be a high school graduate, or the equivalent, to meet college 
entrance requirements. The universe may be too broad, but on 
no other grounds can exception be taken. * 
II. Hicu scHoon VIsITaTion 
In the winter and spring of 1921, six faculty members and 
five advanced students, and again in the winter and spring of 
1922, three faculty members and four advanced students, at the 
Teachers College at Kirksville, visited high schools in northeast 
Missouri. These representatives of the college spent from one 
to two hours in each school, and devoted about two days each 
to the work. Forty-eight schools were visited in 1921, and forty, 
in 1922, These representatives were permitted to use 15 or 20 
minutes in each school to explain to the senior class the purpose, 
function, equipment, curricula, and certificate requirements of 
the Teachers College. Afterwards, cards calling for the following 
information were distributed: 1. Name of student; 2. Home 
address; 3. Name of high school; 4. Name of teachers college, 
college, or university, student would like to attend after gradua- 
tion; 5. Intention as to teaching; 6. Names of near relatives that 
have attended Teachers College at Kirksville. It was urged 
that students fill out item number (4) with the name of the school 
that they actually preferred, but, if they had no choice, with the 
words, “no preference”’. 
In 1921 these cards were filled out by 1153 persons nearly 
all of whom were high school seniors and the rest teachers who had 
never been to Kirksville. The cards for 1922 were filled out by
-P-A-G-E-68
    68 Tue RELATION oF ExTRA-MURAL Stupy TO 
957 such persons. Schools in Adair County, where the college is 
situated, were not included in these high school visitations. 
The high school graduates of each year were now divided into 
three groups: (1) Kirksville preference; (2) No preference; (3) 
Other school preference. If no indication of school preference 
was given on the card, it was counted in the “no preference” 
group. After the lapse of seven quarters, (June 1921-March 
1923), the files of student records at the college were examined 
appertaining to the 1921 group, and after the lapse of five quar- 
ters, (June 1922-September 1923), the files were examined apper- 
taining to the 1922 group for the following items: 1. Enrolment; 
2. The quarter; 3. Number of months from June following the 
visitation to enrolment. The facts relative to these tabulations 
appear in the tables of this chapter. f 
III. ReLarioN BETWEEN SCHOOL PREFERENCE AND LATER 
REGISTRATION 
1. Need for knowing the relationship 
Is there any well defined relation between school preference 
and later college registration at a given institution? When this 
question is answered, it will be possible to compare the student 
universe, or any portion of it, with the high school graduate uni- 
verse, or any portion of it as represented by ‘school preference”’, 
“no preference”, or “other school preference’, and to know 
definitely the relative strength of each of these preference groups 
in regard to residence enrolment.

Using Sheppard’s Tables, and formula (II) of Chapter I, which is

first the upper row, then the sum of the two upper rows, sets of 
values (1) and (2). Sets (3) and (4) are obtained as explained 
in Chapter I.

From sets (1) and (4), m= .456 
From sets (2) and (4), m2.=.555 
c. Interpretation 
It will be recalled in Chapter I for Table XII that means of 
x-arrays in set (1) show that, as we pass from registered to non- 
registered persons, the preference for Kirksville steadily declines. 
So also preference for Kirksville increases as we pass from non- 
registered to registered persons. Thus 1=.299 and 2.=.328 
indicate strong positive correlation between Kirksville preference 
and registration. 
So also from Table XIII the mean of x-arrays in set (1) de- 
creases (beginning always with the means of the first column) as 
we pass from registered to non-registered persons, and increases 
sharply as we pass from non-registered to registered persons. 
The x-variate is somewhat heteroscedastic, but the values of 7 
are reasonably near each other. The lowest value indicates a 
stronger correlation than does the highest in Table XII. This sit- 
 
-P-A-G-E-70
  
  70 Tue RELATION OF EXTRA-MURAL StupyY TO 
uation is probably due to the fact that students who prefer other 
schools are slow in registering, and Table XII covers a period 
longer by two quarters than does Table XIII. 
3. School registration, alternate variate 
As a check on our work let us take Tables XII and XIII, and 
make registration at Kirksville the alternate, or x-variate, and 
school preference the categoric, or y-variate, ‘and apply formula 
(IIT) of Chapter I.

Table XIIa was discussed in Chapter I. But Tables XIla 
and XIIIa are so much alike that what is said of one applies to 
the other also.
-P-A-G-E-71
RESIDENCE ENROLMENT AND SCHOLASTIC STANDING a 
By examining the means of x-arrays and beginning with &,/o1 
under each table we find that they continuously increase as we 
pass -from Kirksville preference, through no preference, to prefer- 
ence for other schools. This relation shows that non-registration 
continuously increases, that is registration decreases, in each 
table as we pass continuously from Kirksville preference to pref- 
erence for other schools. It also shows that registration increases 
as we pass in the opposite direction from preference for other 
schools to preference for Kirksville. So here, as also under 
Tables XIT and XIII, there is a strong positive correlation be- 
tween school preference and later registration. 
Since the means of arrays increase continuously, registra- 
tion, or the x-variate, is Gaussian, and since under Tables XII 
and XIII the school preference variate was found to be reason- 
ably homoscedastic, formula (III) can be used with confidence. 
Accordingly in two distinct sets of data, and by two methods of 
calculation the correlation ratios are found to be as follows: 
(1) For 1921, 4,;=.299, m2=.328, 3=.268 
(2) For 1922, ,=.456, m=.555, n3=.473 
In either case the correlation between school preference and 
residence registration is very high. 
4. Strength of school preference 
a. Per cent of registration 
The strength of the three types of school preference, and of 
the three types combined, as exhibited through school registration 
where the time since graduation is also taken into account, shows 
well in a tabulation. These data are drawn from Tables XIIb 
and XIII. Table XIIb which is Table XII extended recently 
to 9 quarters is given at the close of this chapter.

b. Interpretation and comparisons 
This table reads as follows beginning with the upper row: 
40.5 per cent of high school graduates (1921), with Kirksville 
preference, enroll at Kirksville within 9 quarters after gradua- 
tion; 59.1 per cent do not enroll. A similar reading holds for the 
1922 visitation. For the two visitations combined 40.1 per cent 
of high school graduates, with Kirksville preference, enroll at 
Kirksville; 59.9 per cent do not enroll. Similar readings hold for 
rows (2) and (3). In row (4) for the year 1921, 25.1 per cent of 
all graduates enroll at Kirksville within nine quarters; 74.9 per 
cent do not enroll. In 1922, 18.7 per cent enroll within 5 quar- 
ters; 81.3 per cent do not enroll. For both visitations combined 
22.2 per cent of all graduates enroll at Kirksville; 77.8 per cent 
do not enroll. 
Thus four quarters add considerably to the registration. 
This fact is shown by the per cents in columns (1) and (3). Es- 
pecially is it true under “no school” and ‘other school pref- 
erence’. In four quarters additional, these per cents are doubled. 
Column five shows the minimum per cent from each preference 
group that may be expected to enroll for residence study. Thus 
40.1 per cent of those who prefer Kirksville will enroll; 15.7 per 
cent of those who have no school preference will enroll; 9 per cent 
of those who prefer other schools will enroll; and 22.2 per cent 
of all high school graduates whose names are secured in the man- 
ner indicated will enroll. Of course, it is not maintained that 
the visitation brings the students to college; it merely furnishes 
the list of prospective students. 
5. Conclusion 
It is now known definitely that, in the universe of high school 
graduates, those who prefer a school are the best prospective stu- 
dents by far, those who have no school preference are next, and 
those who prefer another school are last in the list. It is easy 
to secure such a list of prospective college students, and to divide 
them on the basis of interest into three groups which foretell 
well the probability of registration. A standard has been deter- 
mined with which residence enrollment of extra-mural students 
may be compared. 
IV. TIME BETWEEN HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION AND COLLEGE 
REGISTRATION 
1. Preliminary statement 
The time that elapses between high school graduation and 
. college registration as it applies to the “preference”’, ‘‘no prefer- 
ence’, and “other school preference’? groups is also another 
question of interest. The writer has made a detailed study of 
this question as it applies to the high school graduates of 1921 
and of 1922. But since similar data could not be secured on any 
extensive scale for extra-mural students, only a few striking tabu- 
lations with their interpretations are given. If we take from each
-P-A-G-E-73
  
RESIDENCE ENROLMENT AND ScHOLASTIC STANDING 73 
list of high school graduates those who have registered for resi- 
dence study at Kirksville, and form tabulations showing the quar- 
ters or seasons of the year during which they enrolled, beginning 
with the first summer after their graduation, each tabulation 
will show under each type of preference yearly cycles of change 
and seasonal fluctuations. It is evident that these two factors 
cannot well be treated in a single table. It is best to consider 
them by making one tabulation for the four quarters or seasons 
of the year, and another, with the summer quarters representing 
two or more years. 
2. Registration by quarters 
a. Four quarters of the year 
Let us take the two lists of high school graduates, and form 
a single tabulation by quarters for a whole year beginning with 
the summer quarter, which was the first quarter of school after 
their graduation. S, F, W, and Sp. stand for summer, fall, winter, 
and spring respectively.

Employing Sheppard’s Tables and using formula (II) of Chapter I,

  74 THE RELATION OF EXTRA-MURAL STUDY TO 
From sets (1) and (4), m=.389 
From sets (2) and (4), 2.=.470 
These values of 7 show a high degree of correlation, and are in 
reasonably close agreement, though the alternate variate is very 
heteroscedastic. Beginning with X, / o, and X,’ /o, in sets (1) and (2) 
of the means of x-arrays we observe that with one exception they 
continuously decrease. Hence for one year, beginning with the 
summer quarter, when registration is considered by quarters, the 
school preference variate is reasonably Gaussian. Moreover, with 
the one exception noted, Kirksville preference decreases as we 
pass from summer to spring on the time-axis. Therefore regis- 
tration having Kirksville preference is negatively correlated with 
time elapsed between high school graduation and college regis- 
tration. In other words, registration having preference for 
“other schools” is positively correlated with time as represented 
by the four seasons within the period of a year. This relation 
shows that, the stronger the preference is for a school, the earlier 
the enrolments take place within a given year. Moreover, this 
tendency is very strong as indicated by the large correlation ratio. 
It is interesting to note that if a second summer quarter is added 
to this table both values of » become imaginary which fact in- 
dicates the effect of introducing seasonal fluctuations also. How- 
ever, the arrays of means indicate that the correlation is actually 
in harmony with that found in Table XV. 
b. Two consecutive summer quarters 
Let us now take two consecutive summer quarters represent- 
ing a two year period, and use the combined data secured from 
the two high school visitations. §, and S, stand for first and sec- 
ond summers respectively.

Using formula (II) of Chapter I, we find: 
From sets (1) and (4), 7:=.173 
From sets (2) and (4), 72=.192 
The values of 7 are in close accord, and the alternate variate is 
reasonably homoscedastic. From the means in sets (1) and (2) 
it is seen that as we pass along the time-axis from first summer to 
second summer, preference for Kirksville decreases, or in other 
words Kirksville non-preference increases. This result shows 
that registration having Kirksville preference is negatively cor- 
related with time as expressed by the lapse of two summers; where- 
as other school preference is positively correlated with the number 
of summers passed. Hence, it is seen that within the period of 
two years, as represented by the’same seasons, those preferring 
Kirksville tend to enroll earlier than those not preferring it, and 
the stronger the preference the sooner the registration. These 
results are in accord with those observed in connection with the 
seasons of a single year. 
ec. Three consecutive summer quarters 
After Tables XII, XV, and XVI were completed, and calcula- 
tions made, the data involved in the cards for 1921 were brought 
to date by looking up registrations for two additional quarters. 
This procedure extends the data for Table XII to nine quarters 
which include three summer quarters. Thus the tabulation for 
the high school graduates of 1921 includes three consecutive sum- 
mer quarters representing a three year period. The frequencies 
are small, but the tabulation is the best available. The notation 
is similar to that used in Table XVI.

By formula (II), Chapter I, -71=.04. The value for 7 is 
imaginary. However, when means of arrays are examined in both 
sets (1) and (2), they are found to decrease continuously as we 
pass from Kirksville preference, through no preference to prefer- 
ence for other schools. This situation indicates a slight negative 
correlation between Kirksville preference, and time measured by 
three consecutive years. The correlation, though small, appears 
to be significant, and is in harmony with the facts brought out in 
Tables XV and XVI. 
d. Comparisons and conclusions 
Facts deduced from Table XVII, and from other sources 
not given in this brief survey seem to indicate that after the second 
year the correlations noted between school preference and time, as 
represented by the seasons of the year; and between school pr 
erence and time, as represented by consecutive years, begin to dis- 
appear. However, this result may be due to the paucity of ob- 
servations in later periods. There is a fruitful field for extensive 
research in this connection. Moreover, as the time is extended, 
the numerical value of the correlation decreases. This result, 
taken in connection with Table XIV, helps to explain why the 
correlation ratio in Table XII for 7 quarters is less than in Table 
XIII for five quarters. Hence the conclusion is reached that 
school preference, and time elapsed before enrolment are nega- 
tively correlated for a limited period of time up to two or three 
years though the correlation decreases numerically with the lapse 
of time. This chapter gives a true insight into the prospective 
student universe as represented by high school graduates, and 
furnishes a valuable standard of comparison. 
e. Table XII, 1921, extended to 9 quarters 
Under (c) as noted, Table XII was brought up to date by the

V. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 
(1) Correlation between school preference and later resi- 
dence registration is very high. Approximately two years after 
high school graduation 40.1 per cent of those with Kirksville 
preference, 15.7 per cent of those with no preference, and 9 per 
cent of those who prefer other schools enroll at Kirksville. Also 
it is found that 22.2 per cent of all high school graduates enroll. 
(2) School preference, and time from high school graduation 
to college registration are negatively correlated for a limited 
period of 2 to 3 years. The stronger the school preference, the 
sooner enrolment takes place. Students with Kirksville prefer- 
ence tend to enroll first; next, those with no preference; and last 
of all, those who prefer other schools. 
The results of this chapter enable school administrators to 
apply standards of recognized worth to problems of residence 
enrolment. These standards can be determined for each school, 
and then each universe of prospective students can be dealt with 
on the bases of merit, and of probable returns. 
The universe of high school graduates thus collected and 
classified represents a universe of prospective: students available 
for residence enrolment in every state teachers college. High 
school graduates come well, come uniformly, and come quickly if 
a preference exists; therefore, they are used as a basis of com- 
parison to determine whether extra-mural students who have 
had extra-mural study first, constitute a desirable prospective stu- 
dent universe.

  CHAPTER VI 
EXtTRA-MURAL STUDENTS AS Prospective CoLLEGE STUDENTS 
In this chapter, for the universe of extra-mural students with 
extra-mural study first, the following questions are considered: 
(1) How do such extra-mural students compare, as pros- 
pective college students, with high school graduates who have 
no college preference? ’ 
(2) How do such extra-mural students compare, as pros- 
pective college students, with high school graduates in general? 
(3) How do such extra-mural students compare, as pros- 
pective college students, with high school graduates having college 
preference? . 
I. THE score OF STUDY EXTENDED 
The study is now extended so that it includes the three large 
teachers colleges of Missouri, and a teachers college of Illinois. 
Extra-mural students constitute the universe. Some of the ques- 
tions involved were considered in Chapter IV, but now the prob- 
lem is extended so as to include type of study, and order of en- 
rolment over a period of several years in four different institutions. 
Evidently the order of enrolments in residence and in extra-mural 
study is the significant thing. 
As in Chapter IV, type of study means residence, corre- 
spondence, or extension study. In this chapter the last two 
are combined under the head of extra-mural study. Order of en- 
rolment indicates the numerical sequence of type of study.

e. Interpretations and comparisons 
Table XVIII is used for purpose of illustration; it reads. as 
follows: at Kirksville, 818 students enrolled first in residence; 
65, second; 65, enrolled first in extra-mural study; 818; second. 
Total first enrolments, 883; total second, 883; total residence 
enrolments, 883; total extra-mural, 883; total enrolments of both 
types, 1766. However, 7 of the 65 who were enrolled first in 
extra-mural study, and entered later for residence study earned 
no credit in residence. Q represents the coefficient of association 
given by formula (VIT) of Chapter I. The subscripts k, w, s, and 
a refer to Kirksville, Warrensburg, Springfield, and all schools 
combined respectively. 
We observe that Qk = .983, Qw = .982, Qs =.977, and Qa=.983. 
The values of these four coefficients of association are in remark- 
ably close accord. They show that the data collected from the 
Missouri schools are homogeneous. They indicate that, in the 
universe of extra-mural students who have had residence study 
also, the association between residence study and first enrolment 
is nearly perfect. The approach to unity, or complete association, 
is the remarkable thing, not the fact that the association is posi- 
tive; that much was to be expected. Of course in the above named 
universe the association between first enrolment and extra-mural 
study is just as strongly negative. Students with residence study 
first, furnish practically the only sources for securing extra-mural 
enrolments in this universe. Students with extra-mural study 
first, scarcely affect residence enrolments at all, and it takes such 
students to increase residence enrolments. Moreover, Qx=.996, 
in Table VIII, Chapter IV, for the corresponding sets of facts in 
the year 1919-1920, while here Qx=.983. 
The strong positive association observed is a sufficient condi- 
tion to show that extra-mural study is not appreciably affecting 
residence enrolment. But it does not at all follow that it is a 
necessary condition. This same statement applies to (b) below. In 
all cases it is evident that the association between residence study 
and second enrolment is the negative of the values found above.

In the whole universe of extra-mural students we have: 
Q,,=.954, Q, =.919, Q,=.901, and Q, =.928 
Tn (2) also the association coefficients are very large, and in close 
accord. ‘These coefficients show that, in the whole universe of 
extra-mural students as observed in the three largest teachers 
colleges of Missouri, the association between residence study and 
first enrolment is also but little short of complete association. 
3. Observations and comparisons 
(1) (a) Out of 1062 students who had extra-mural study 
at Kirksville, 65, or 1 out of 16.3, or 6.1 per cent, enter school for 
residence study after first having had extra-mural study; (b) out 
of 938 such students at Warrensburg, 63, or 1 out of 14.9, or 6.7 
per cent, enter school for residence study after first having had 
extra-mural study; (c) out of 966 such students at Springfield, 69, 
or 1 out of 14, or 7.1 per cent, enter school for residence study 
after first having had extra-mural study. These figures are almost 
identical, and show that a uniform situation exists in the whole 
state. 
(2) (a) Out of 883 students who had both extra-mural and 
residence study at Kirksville, 65, or 1 out of 13.5, or 7.4 per cent, 
enter school for residence study after first having had extra-mural 
study; (b) out of 715 such students at Warrensburg, 63, or 1 out 
of 11.4, or 8.8 per cent, enter school for residence study after first 
having had extra-mural study; (c) out of 716 such students at 
Springfield, 69, or 1 out of 10.4, or 9.6 per cent, enter school for 
residence study after first having had extra-mural study. 
(3) (a) Out of 1062 students who had extra-mural study at 
Kirksville, 244, or 22.5 per cent of them, had extra-mural study 
first, whereas 77.5 per cent of them had residence study first; 
(b) out of 938 such students at Warrensburg, 286, or 30.5 per cent 
of them, had extra-mural study first, whereas 69.5 per cent of 
them had residence study first; (ec) out of 966 such students at 
Springfield, 319, or 33 per cent of them, had extra-mural study 
first, whereas 67 per cent had residence study first. 
Hence at Kirksville less than 1/4 of all extra-mural students 
begin college study with extra-mural enrolment, whereas more 
than 3/4 of them begin college study with residence enrolment. 
Almost identical results were found at Kirksville for the year 
1919-1920. At Warrensburg 3/10 of all extra-mural students had 
their first connection with the college through extra-mural study, 
whereas 7/10 of them had their first connection with the college 
through residence study. At Springfield 1/3 of the extra-mural 
students had their first connection with the college through extra- 928
-P-A-G-E-83
RESIDENCE ENROLMENT AND SCHOLASTIC STANDING 83 
mural study, whereas 2/3 of them had their first connection 
through residence study. 
(4) (a) Out of 244 extra-mural students at Kirksville 
who had their first connection with the college through extra-mural 
study, 179 of them, or 73.4 per cent, have never entered for resi- 
dence study, whereas 26.6 per cent entered; (b) out of 286 such 
students at Warrensburg, 223 of them, or 78 per cent, have never 
entered for residence study, whereas 22 per cent entered; (c) out 
of 319 such students at Springfield, 250 of them, or 78.4 per cent, 
have never entered for residence study, whereas 21.6 per cent 
entered. 
The per cent of those having extra-mural study first, who 
enter school at Kirksville, is slightly greater than at either War- 
rensburg or Springfield. However, both of these schools have 
under (1) and (2) slightly greater per cents of the total number 
of extra-mural students entering for later residence study, and 
have under (3) a slightly greater per cent of extra-mural students 
who had their first connection with the college through residence 
study. But number (4) tests best the influence of extra-mural 
study on later residence enrolment. 
(5) Some results drawn from different universes of study 
at Kirksville are now compared. (a) Out of the 187 teachers 
(Chapter IV) who had both extra-mural and residence study, 
14, or 1 out of 13.1, or 7.6 per cent, entered school for residence 
study after first having had extra-mural study. Under (2) at 
Kirksville 7.4 per cent entered. (b) Out of 187 teachers who 
had extra-mural study at Kirksville, 46, or 24.6 per cent, had 
extra-mural study first. Under (3) at Kirksville 22.5 per cent had 
sxtra-mural study first. (ce) Out of 46 teachers who had their 
first connection with Kirksville through extra-mural study, 32, 
or 70 per cent, never entered for residence study. Under (4) at 
Kirksville 73.4 per cent never entered. For students of the year 
1919-1920 (Chapter IV) 78.1 per cent never entered. (d) Out 
of 2664 public school teachers of northeast Missouri, 867, or 32.8 
per cent had at Kirksville residence study as the first type of study 
there. But under (4) at Kirksville only 26.6 per cent of all extra- 
mural students, who had extra-mural study first, later entered 
Kirksville. 
In other words, in every comparison made under (5) the whole 
universe of teachers without any limitations furnishes better 
prospective students to the teachers college at Kirksville than 
does the universe of students whose first enrolment was extra- 
mural. 
4, Other methods for determining relationship 
a. Mean square contingency 
However, as a check on the association between residence 
study and first enrolment, let us employ mean square contingency 
to Tables XXI and XXV, which involve a summary of data for

the question.

Let us now compute by tetrachoric functions the coefficient 
of correlation, r, for Table XXI. We have a=2117, b=197, 
c=197, d= 2117, and N=4682. Therefore b+d=2314; c+d= 
2314; d/N=. 4632; (b+d) /N=3(1—a) =.5; (e+d) /N=3(1—a’)

Since, in this problem, a=a’ and T=T’ there arose the neces- 
sity of extending this equation three terms beyond that given by 
Everitt’s Tables. But by tables especially devised by Everitt, 
we calculated T;, Ts, and Ty and obtained the above equation 
containing only odd powers of r. 
By Deseartes’ rule of signs there is no negative root, and not 
more than one positive root. The positive root lies between 0 
and 1. By Horner’s method r=.98, with probable error of .0003. 
This large coefficient indicates almost perfect correlation. 
5. Summary 
By tests of highest efficiency we are forced to the conclusion 
that the correlation between residence study and ‘first. enrolment 
in residence in the three largest teachers colleges in Missouri is 
practically perfect in the universe of extra-mural students who 
have had residence study also; and, as indicated earlier, the com- 
pleteness of the association is the significant fact. We observe 
also that, in the whole universe of extra-mural students where 
3/4 of the first enrolments in extra-mural study never enter at 
all for residence study, the association is still positive and very 
high. Moreover, we find that the condition observed at Kirks- 
ville in Chapter IV is not local, but statewide and remarkably uni- 
form in every important particular.

1. Introductory statement 
It has been shown that conditions are uniform over the state 
of Missouri. Let us now consider the influence of extra-mural 
study on residence enrolment in a teachers college of a neighboring 
state. 
The Macomb State Teachers College has been doing extra- 
mural work on a large scale since 1911. Originally part of the 
work was correspondence, but now it is almost entirely extension. 
The average enrolment for the first ten years was 519, and from 
1913-1921, 2166 different individuals were enrolled. 
However, some variation from the results observed in Mis- 
souri may be expected, since extra-mural study in Illinois is fav- 
ored, in that it meets certain requirements made of teachers as 
to position, salary, and certificate renewals, an advantage not 
enjoyed in Missouri. We quote from the Macomb Teachers 
College Quarterly: ‘‘These extension courses are accredited by 
county superintendents of schools for the renewal of certificates, 
by all normal schools, colleges and universities belonging to the 
North Central Association, and by other educational institutions 
of similar grade. Boards of education in our leading cities give 
credit for this work in the grading of teachers and their salaries. ””* 
1No. 49, March, 1921, p. 35.
-P-A-G-E-86
  
  86 Tur RELATION or ExTRA-MURAL STUDY TO 
We quote also from a Macomb extension class folder, 1923-1924: 
“The credits obtained in these courses (extension) are good in 
all the leading colleges and universities, and are accepted by the 
State Certification Board and by county superintendents for the 
renewal of certificates.’”’ In Missouri, credits made in extra- 
mural courses are exactly on the same basis as are credits made in 
the three quarters of the regular school year. Residence credits 
made in summer quarters at the Missouri teachers colleges are 
accepted more liberally on state and county certificates than are 
any other credits.

4. Discussion of results 
In the discussion which follows, it should be kept in mind 
that under both (2) and (3) our universe involves only extra- 
mural students; and that, when the association between residence —.372  
-P-A-G-E-87
ResipENCE ENROLMENT AND SCHOLASTIC STANDING 87 
study and first enrolment is positive and approaches unity, it 
serves as a sufficient condition to show that extra-mural study, 
which comes first, is not appreciably resulting in later residence 
enrolment; but on the other hand, in no sense can it, be considered 
a necessary condition to show that extra-mural study first, is lead- 
ing to residence enrolment in case the association is positive and 
small, or even negative. Further investigation in such cases is 
necessary unless the association approaches near to —l. For 
instance if, in tables XX VI and XXVII, 250 were replaced by 1, 
then in each case the association would practically equal —1, 
and evidently extra-mural study first, would be leading to later 
residence enrolment; or the association between residence study 
and second enrolment would be nearly equal to 1. 
In universe (2) Qm is positive, but not so large as in the three 
Missouri teachers colleges. This coefficient shows that the asso- 
ciation between residence study and first enrolment is strongly 
positive, or stated in another form the association between resi- 
dence study and second enrolment is —.565, and strongly nega- 
tive, but in neither case as strong as in the teachers colleges of 
Missouri. ‘ 
In universe (3) Qm is negative. This coefficient shows that 
residence study is negatively associated with first enrolment in 
the whole universe of extra-mural students, or stated in another 
form residence study is positively associated with second enrol- 
ment. 
It is evident, however, that (2) is a much better index of the 
influence of extra-mural study on residence enrolment than is (3). 
For in Table XX VII the negative association is due to the large 
number of extra-mural students who never enter for residence 
study at all. But in Table XXVI, Q is positive and shows that 
residence study and first enrolment are strongly associated, or 
that residence study and second enrolment have strong negative 
association. However, thus far we are not able to speak so con- 
fidently of the situation in Illinois as we are in Missouri. The 
tests used are not nearly so decisive, and the problem requires 
further analysis and investigation. 
IV. MacomB COMPARED WITH TEACHERS COLLEGES OF 
Missourt 
1. Observation and comparisons 
(1) Out of 1284 students who had extra-mural study at 
Macomb, 132, or 1 out 9.7, or 10.3 per cent enter school for resi- 
dence study after first having had extra-mural study. The per 
cents at Kirksville, Warrensburg, and Springfield are respectively 
6.1, 6.7, and 7.1. However, Macomb offers mainly extension courses. 
If only extension courses at Kirksville are considered the per cent 
is 9.38, nearly the same as at Macomb. Does this result indi- 
cate that extension study is more closely related to residence 
study than is correspondence study, and that it exerts a stronger 
influence in leading to residence enrolment? 
 
-P-A-G-E-88
88 Tue RELATION OF ExTRA-MURAL STUDY TO 
(2) Out of 382 students who had both extra-mural and 
residence study at Macomb, 132, or 1 out of 2.9, or 34.6 per cent, 
enter school for residence study after first having had extra-mural 
study. The percents at the Missouri teachers colleges are in the 
order used above: 7.4, 8.8, and 9.6. If only extension courses 
are used the per cent at Kirksville is 12.1. Macomb excels in 
this universe. 
(3) Out of 1284 students who had extra-mural study at 
Macomb, (a) 1034, or 80.5 per cent of them, had extra-mural study 
first; (b) 19.5 percent of them had residence study first. -In the 
Missouri schools the per cents are: (a) 22.5, 30.5, and 33; (b) 77.5, 
69.5, and 67. The size of per cents under (a) and (b) are just 
reversed at Macomb from what they are in the Missouri teachers 
colleges. At Macomb large numbers begin with extra-mural 
study. This situation is probably due to the position of ad- 
vantage given extra-mural credits in Illinois, and also to the fact 
that Macomb has extension directors giving full time to the work. 
Neither of these conditions applies in Missouri. 
(4) Out of 1034 extra-mural students at Macomb who had 
their first connection with the school through extra-mural study, 
(a) 902, or 87.6 per cent of them, never have entered for residence 
study; (b) 12.6 per cent of them have entered. In the Missouri 
schools the per cents are respectively: (a) 73.4, 78, and 78.4; 
(b) 26.6, 22, and 21.6. 
But the universe in number (4) which consists of extra- 
mural students who had their first connection with the school 
through extra-mural study is the real universe of prospective 
students out of which residence enrolments must come if extra- 
mural study leads to residence enrolment. By this test applied 
in this universe, which represents the crux of the whole situation, 
Macomb stands at the foot of the list of schools studied, and 
Kirksville, at the head. The per cent of those who enter out of 
this universe of legitimate prospective students at Kirksville is 
more than twice as high as that at Macomb. 
2. Universe of extra-mural students with extra-mural study 
first: 
a. Anew universe 
Comparison of facts in number (4) suggests a definite way out 
of a difficult situation. We now create the universe of extra- 
mural students who had extra-mural study first. We combine the 
data from the three Missouri teachers colleges, since they have 
been shown to be homogeneous in every respect, and compare 
them with similar data from Macomb, Illinois. We know definite- 
ly in Missouri that extra-mural study has a very minor influence 
on residence registration. We shall now find, in the universe 
designated above, the association between extra-mural study in 
Missouri and later residence registration when considered in 
connection with Illinois (Macomb) and later residence registra- 
tion.

b. Observations and conclusions 
Extra-mural students, with extra-mural study first, consti- 
tute a prospective student universe from which residence enrol- 
ments must come if extra-mural study leads to residence enrol- 
ment. Out of 879 extra-mural students, with extra-mural study 
first, in Missouri, 197 came into residence; out of 1034 such stu- 
dents in Illinois, 132 came into residence. We find that Q=.823. 
This coefficient shows that extra-mural study in Missouri has 
strong positive association with later residence registration when 
compared with extra-mural study in Illinois; therefore, students 
in Missouri with extra-mural study first, are considerably more 
likely to enroll for later residence study than they are in Illinois. 
Then, since extra-mural study has a very slight influence on resi- 
dence enrolment in Missouri, it is clear that in Illinois, as repre- 
sented by Macomb, the influence is still less) We have shown 
that this condition extends beyond Missouri. 
V. COMPARISON WITH A STANDARD 
1. Another new universe 
Though the influence of extra-mural study on residence en- 
rolment is indeed slight, still it may be argued that extra-mural 
students constitute the best universe for prospective college stu- 
dents. Let us examine this claim. 
Fortunately Chapter V provides a carefully worked out 
standard of comparison in a universe of prospective students 
which consists. of high school graduates for the years 1920-1921 
and 1921-1922. Since college entrance demands high school 
graduation, no one can dispute the validity of this universe of 
prospective students when taken as a whole. Moreover, there is 
good reason to believe that the prospective student universe of a 
teachers college should be limited to those who prefer that type 
of institution, for usually, they intend to teach. On the other 
hand it is certainly fair to consider a student who takes extra- 
mural study first, in a school as having a preference for that school, 
and, consequently, as being a prospective student.

On this basis let us take, in the four teacher producing in- 
stitutions combined, all the students who had their first connec- 
tion with the schools through extra-mural study, and compare 
them: (a) with those high school graduates of Chapter V that 
preferred Kirksville; (b) with those who preferred Kirksville 
combined with those who had no preference; (c) with the whole 
universe of high school graduates regardless of any preference for 
any school.

Here Q is slightly positive, but almost zero. This coefficient 
locates the extra-mural student definitely. 
e. Observations and comparisons 
(1) From Table XXIX Q=—.526 which indicates very 
strong negative association between extra-mural study and later 
registration in a universe of prospective students composed of 
extra-mural students who had extra-mural study first, and of high 
school graduates who had a college preference. Extra-mural 
students in this universe are not nearly so likely to enter college 
as are high school graduates with a college preference. This com- 
panes seems to be fair, and perhaps should constitute our stand- 
ard. 
(2) In Table XXX a still more liberal attitude has been taken 
towards extra-mural study. Here Q=—.335, which also indi- 
cates strong negative association between extra-mural study and  
-P-A-G-E-92
    92 Tue RELATION oF EXTRA-MURAL STUDY TO 
later registration in a universe of prospective’ students composed 
of extra-mural students who had extra-mural study first, and of 
high school graduates who had either a college preference or no 
preference. Extra-mural students even in this universe are not 
nearly as likely to enter college as are those high school graduates 
having either a college preference or no preference at. all. 
(3) In Table XXXI the greatest liberality was shown in 
the formation of a universe. Here again Q=—.080 which co- 
efficient of association is negative. There is still a slight nega- 
tive association between extra-mural study and later registration 
in a universe of prospective students composed of extra-mural 
students who had extra-mural study first, and of high school 
graduates en masse. Thus even in this universe extra-mural 
students are not as likely to enter college for residence study in a 
teachers college as are high school graduates taken at random. 
(4) This startling conclusion is drawn from large samples 
of material shown to be homogeneous over wide areas. How- 
ever, as a check on Q=—.08 tetrachoric functions are applied 
to the data of Table XX XI. We obtain the equation 
r§—.22r5 + 16r4-+ 1.57r3-+ .26r2-+ 25.01r+2.84=0. 
There is no positive root between 0 and 1. There are two nega- 
tive roots, one of which is greater than 1; the other is between 
0 and —1. By Horner’s method r=—.11. Thus the coefficient 
of correlation between interest in school through extra-mural study 
and later residence registration is negative, and supports the 
conclusion drawn from the fact in Table XXXI that Q=—.08. 
(5) These lists of high school graduates were obtained 
outside of Kirksville, and Adair county. They were collected 
hurriedly either by a Kirksville faculty member or by a senior 
college student who spent from one to two hours at most in each 
high school visited, and from 15 to 20 minutes with the senior 
class during which time the cards were filled out giving Kirksville 
preference, no preference, or preference for other schools. The 
different degrees of relationship involved in these three classes 
were definitely brought out in Chapter V in order to furnish a 
progressive standard of comparison. As seen in Table XXXII 
extra-mural students can be placed rather definitely in this scale 
by comparing them with high. school graduates with no school 
preference. 
f. Percentage comparisons 
By referring in this chapter to comparison (4) under Missouri 
state teachers colleges and to (4) under Macomb Teachers Col- 
lege, we have at hand material for a new table which shows the 
per cent of enrolments out of a universe of prospective students 
consisting of extra-mural students who had residence study first. 
By reference to Table XIV of Chapter V we have the per cent 
of high school graduates of each type of preference who enroll for

residence study. In the following tabulation K, W,S, M, and A 
stand for Kirksville, Warrensburg, Springfield, Macomb, and all 
schools combined respectively:

  This table is self explanatory. It shows that the per cent of 
residence enrolments from extra-mural students with extra-mural 
study first, is highest at Kirksville, lowest at Macomb, and that 
the per cent for all combined is 17.4. In every case the per cent 
is much lower than the per cent for high school students who prefer 
Kirksville; the per cent of enrolment for all extra-mural students 
is considerably less than the per cent for all high school graduates; 
and is only slightly greater than the per cent for the “no prefer- 
ence”’ group of high school graduates. Had data for the visitation 
of 1921 alone been used the showing made by extra-mural students 
would be less favorable still. By reference to Table XIV of Chap- 
ter V each school can be placed, with reference to enrolment of 
extra-mural students, quite definitely in terms of enrolment of 
high school graduates. These percentage comparisons support 
in every detail the conclusions reached by more exact methods of 
study. 
VI. SumMaARY AND CONCLUSIONS 
The following results hold in the universe of extra-mural 
students having extra-mural study first: 
(1) Extra-mural students as prospective college students, 
are almost exactly on a par with high school graduates having no 
college preference, with the advantage perhaps a trifle in favor 
of the former. : 
(2) Extra-mural students are not quite as good prospective 
college students as are high school graduates in general. 
(3) Extra-mural students when compared with high school 
graduates having college preference, are wholly outclassed as 
prospective college students. 
By applying the standards deduced, administrators of teach- 
ers colleges in Missouri will find that extra-mural students having
-P-A-G-E-94
  
  94 Tne RELATION oF ExTRA-MURAL Stupy TO 
extra-mural study first, are on a par as prospective college stu- 
dents, with high school graduates having no college preference; 
that they are not quite so good as high school graduates in gen- 
eral; and that they are wholly out-classed by high school graduates 
with college preference. These facts stand out all the more 
prominently when it is recalled that these extra-mural students 
have had from 1 to 11 years in which to take up residence study, 
whereas about half of the high school graduates have had 2} years, 
and the other half, 1} years. 
It was found in Chapter IV that, in the universe of teachers 
of northeast Missouri, a teacher selected at random was a slightly 
better prospective residence student than was a teacher who first 
had been connected with the school through extra-mural study. 
These remarkable conclusions are reached through investigation 
of extensive and widely distinct universes of material It is thus 
seen that public school teachers and high school graduates both 
furnish teachers colleges a more productive universe of pros- 
pective students than do extra-mural students. It is not the 
purpose in this study to argue for or against the value of extra- 
mural instruction in a teachers college. It may have a place. 
But no administrator of a teachers college should be deluded into 
the belief that he is adding to the prestige of his school through 
extra-mural study, and thereby increasing residence enrolment.

CHAPTER VII 
RELATION BETWEEN TYPES OF StuDY AND ORDER OF ENROLMENT 
In this chapter the following questions are considered: 
(1) What is the strength of association between type of 
study and order of enrolment? 
(2) What relation exists between different types of enrol- 
ment as indicated by order of enrolment? 
I. PROBLEM AND PLAN OF APPROACH 
As yet no particular effort has been made to distinguish be- 
tween residence, correspondence, and extension study in connec- 
tion with order of enrolment where students have had at least 
one type of extra-mural study, and also residence study. This 
problem, aside from a mere inspection of tables, has two methods 
of approach. They are Pearson’s mean square coefficient of 
contingency and his new method of determining correlation when 
one variable is given by alternative, and the other, by multiple 
categories. Type of study and order of enrolment have the same 
meanings as in Chapters IV and VI. 
Il. Mersop or TREATMENT 
1. Data treated by mean square contingency 
a. Kirksville 
We have from the universe of extra-mural students, 1914- 
1922, the following table:

*When no-enrolment is included as an order of enrolment, the total en- 
rolments equal 3 times the number of students. 
It is seen that the total of first enrolments exceeds the total number of 
students by 6. This situation is due to the fact that 6 students, who were 
registered simultaneously as first enrolment, were counted once under both 
correspondence and extension.

The following formulae were developed in Chapter ie 
_ (Am) (Ba) (AmBu)? SEN 
ierty ) Soe sa When these formulae are applied, we have in terms of the notation 
adopted in Chapter I: 
Str = 1879.6 Snr= 87.3 Ssr= 13.8 Str= 00.0 
Ste= 75.5 Sne = 836.3 Sse =320.1 Ste= 29.3 
Ste= 20.8 Sne =371.0 Ssc = 945.9 Ste = 144.3 
Therefore S=4723.9, N=3186, S—N =1537.9 
(1537.9 
N77235 
This value of C shows that the order of enrolment among extra- 
mural students as a universe is highly dependent on the type of 
study, since even a small coefficient of contingency shows a high 
degree of relationship, but the nature of the relationship is not 
yet clear. 
If we now take in Table XXXIV rows (1) and (2), and form 
association ratios as we proceed from column marked “‘first”’ en- 
rolment to column marked “third” enrolment, and then take rows 
(2) and (3) and proceed in the same manner we get two sets of 
ratios designated as sets (1) and (2). These ratios pass from 
tetrad to tetrad; each row containing three tetrads. Therefore C= =.57

Res!pENCE ENROLMENT AND SCHOLASTIC STANDING 97 
We now observe, in both sets (1) and (2), as we pass from ratio 
(a) to (b), to (ec), and to (d), that a>b>ce>d. Or we may say 
that in passing from tetrad to tetrad in set (1) the signs are 
+++. Also in set (2) the signs are +++. 
So the distribution is completely isotropic, and set (1) shows 
that if we take the first two rows of Table XXXIV, that residence 
is positively associated with first enrolment when extension and 
no-enrolment are considered, positively associated with no-en- 
rolment when extension and second enrolment are considered, and 
positively associated with second enrolment when extension and 
third enrolment are considered. 
If we take rows (2) and (3), extension and correspondence, 
set (2) shows that extension is positively associated with first en- 
rolment when correspondence and no-enrolment are considered, 
positively associated with no-enrolment when correspondence 
and second enrolment. are considered, and positively associated 
with second enrolment when correspondence and third enrolment 
are considered. 
Ratios in sets (1) and (2) show, as we pass from residence 
study through extension to correspondence, that the association 
in order of strength declines from first enrolment, through no-en- 
rolment, through second enrolment to third enrolment. This re- 
lation indicates that ‘type of study” is a continuous function 
representing closeness of contact with the teacher, and that it 
increases in strength from correspondence, through extension 
to residence, and that order of enrolment is a continuous func- 
tion of established relationships with a school, and since no-enrol- 
ments could be excluded, that it increases in strength from third 
enrolment, through second, to first enrolment. Therefore it is 
seen that contact with teacher, as represented by type of study, is 
highly correlated with relationship to school as evidenced in order 
of enrolments. 
These results seem to point to the conclusion that extension 
study is much more closely related to residence study than is cor- 
respondence study. Moreover, these data come from the Teach- 
ers College at Kirksville, a school that has put more energy into its 
correspondence department than into its extension department. 
These interesting results lead us to make similar studies deal- 
ing with the relation between the same three types of study and 
order of enrolment at Warrensburg and Springfield.

Here the distribution lacks but little of being isotropic, and the 
frequencies are few in the third column where it falls short. A 
decrease of .07 in ratio (d) of set (2) would make the distribution 
isotropic, and then all that is said in dealing with Table XXXIV 
could be said in dealing with data from Warrensburg. To be 
specific, we should now say that set (1) shows, if we take the first 
two rows of Table XX.XV, that residence is positively associated 
with first enrolment when extension and no-enrolment are con- 
sidered, positively associated with no-enrolment when extension 
and second enrolment are considered, and positively associated 
with second enrolment when extension and third enrolment are 
considered. 
Set (2) shows, if we take rows (2) and (3), that extension is 
positively associated with first enrolment when correspondence 
and no-enrolment are considered, positively associated with no- 
enrolment when correspondence and second enrolment are con- 
sidered, and slightly negatively associated with second enrolment 
when correspondence and third enrolment are considered. Hence 
Table XXXV supports well the conclusions reached in connec- 
tion with Table XXXIV, and the strength of the association is 
about the same at Kirksville and Warrensburg since the coeffi- 
cients of contingency in these schools are .57 and .53 respectively. 
c. Springfield 
Next we consider the same questions relative to extra-mural 
students at Springfield, 1918-1921.

So again the distribution lacks but little of being isotropic, 
and the relations pointed out in Table XXV hold here also. 
C=.49 indicates a high degree of association between types of 
study and order of enrolment. 
d. Three schools combined 
Let us now throw the tabulations of Kirksville, Warrensburg, 
and Springfield into a single table, and obtain the association be- 
tween type of study and order of enrolment as it applies to extra- 
mural students in the three largest teachers colleges of the state 
of Missouri.

Proceeding as explained in Chapter I, we have:

Ste= 413.3 Sne = 1920.8 Sse= 740.1 Ste= 141.1 
Ste= 46.6 Sne= 1221.1 Ssc= 2572.9 Ste= 297.9 
Therefore S=12315.9, N=8898, S—N =3417.9 
[3417.9 _ 
123153971 ~ 
Just as in Table XXXIV, if we take rows (1) and (2), we get 
ratios in set (1), and if we take rows (2) and (3), we get ratios in 
set (2). Therefore C= \

Thus the table fails in the sign of a single tetrad of being isotropic 
and then by less than .1. Hence, in the whole universe of extra- 
‘mural students as represented by the three large teachers colleges 
of Missouri, the association between type of study and order of 
enrolment constantly increases as we pass from third enrolment, 
through second, through no-enrolment, to residence enrolment 
along one attribute, and from correspondence, through extension, 
to residence study along the other attribute. This result holds 
at Kirksville, but fails in a minor phase in one tetrad when the 
whole universe is considered. As extension study develops more

in these institutions, doubtless the distributions will be isotropic 
in each school. 
e. Three schools combined, and no-enrolment column 
deleted 
The question naturally arises as to whether the association 
between types of study and order of enrolment is materially affected 
when the no-enrolment column is deleted. To answer this 
question the no-enrolment column is deleted in Table XXXVI. 
The resulting Table is numbered XXXVIII. This table was used 
in Chapter I to illustrate the finding and application of the mean 
square contingency coefficient. The reader is referred to Table 
cae ad of Chapter I for a full discussion of the relations in- 
volved. 
We find C =.57 and the association holds in the same manner 
as when the no-enrolment column is included; therefore, as we 
pass from residence study through extension, to correspondence, 
the association, in order of strength, declines from first enrolment, 
through second enrolment, to third enrolment with only a slight 
turning back for extension and correspondence when we come 
to third enrolment. 
2. Data treated by Pearson’s new method of correlation 
The mean square coefficient of contingency shows a high de- 
gree of relationship between types of study and order of enrol- 
ments. We desire to know whether the same conclusions are 
borne out by Pearson’s new method of correlation. 
a. Kirksville 
(1) We shall apply this method to Table XXXIV where the 
three types of study with the four columns for enrolments are 
given. The table need not be repeated. 
By using the upper row and employing Sheppard’s Tables 
we obtain the array of means in set (1), and by using rows (1) 
and (2) combined we obtain set (2). The other sets of values are 
obtained as explained in Chapter I.

Using formula (ID of Chapter I, we have from sets (1) and (4), 
and from sets (2) and (4) respectively =.743 and m=.962. 
Therefore at Kirksville there is a high degree of correlation be- 
tween type of study and order of enrolment among extra-mural 
students. It is observed in both sets (1) and (2), always omitting 
the mean of the whole distribution, that the means of columns 
continuously decrease as we pass from residence, through exten- 
sion, to correspondence, and at the same time pass continuously 
from first enrolment, through no-enrolment, through second en- 
rolment, to third enrolment. 
(2) Let us now group in Table XXXIV all correspondence 
and extension enrolments as extra-mural enrolments, and use 
Pearson’s new method as.given by formula (III) of Chapter I.

By using formula (III) of Chapter I, we have 7=.798. This 
value of 7 lies between the two values secured by formula (II). 
Beginning with the first column we sce that the means of ar- 
rays of columns decrease continuously as we pass from residence 
to extra-mural study, and, at the same time pass from first to no- 
enrolment, to second and third enrolment along the enrolment 
variate. The graph is shown in the figure below for both Tables 
XXXIV and XXXIX since they have the same set of means of 
arrays of columns for the upper row. It is clear that the mean 
type of study, as indicated by means of arrays of columns, shifts 
continuously away from residence as we pass from first to third 
enrolment. In other words, the correlation ratio leads to the same 
conclusions reached by the mean square contingency coefficient.

By formula (II) from Chapter I, we have from sets (1) and 
(4) and sets (2) and (4) respectively 7 =.671 and m= .824. 
The arrays are heteroscedastic, but in both set (1) and set 
(2) of means of arrays the values decrease continuously as we pass 
from residence in the first column through extension and corre- 
spondence of the alternate variate, and at the same time go from 
first enrolment through second and third enrolments of the cate- 
goric variate. This result agrees with the results found in Tables 
XXXIV and XXXIX when the no-enrolment column was in- 
cluded. It also agrees with the conclusions reached through 
mean square contingency methods both as to correlation and as 
to the possibility of deleting the no-enrolment columns. 
(4) Let us take Table XL, and combine the two lower rows 
into a single row representing extra-mural study. This tabulation 
follows: .

By formula (IID), Chapter I, 7=.861. This value is in close 
agreement with the values obtained in Table XL. 
It would evidently be repetition to apply Pearson’s method 
to the data from Warrensburg and Springfield. However, as a 
final check it is applied to the combined data from the three 
schools as found in Tables XX XVII, and XXXVIITI.

By formula (II), Chapter I, we have from sets (1) and (4), 
and sets (2) and (4) respectively ,:=.61, and 72.=.68. By ex- 
amining means of arrays of columns for both Tables XX XVII 
and XXXVIII, omitting, of course, the mean that applies to the 
whole distribution, we find that in set (1) the means decrease con- 
tinuously as we pass from residence through extension to corre- 
spondence, while at the same time we go along the enrolment 
variate from first enrolment through no-enrolment, through second 
enrolment, to third enrolment. When set (2) of means is con- 
sidered exactly the same thing happens except that in set (2) 
there is a slight increase in the mean of the last column over that 
of the preceding. 
Thus in both tables, between type of study and order of en- 
rolment, there is a very high degree of correlation which is scarcely 
affected by deleting the no-enrolment column. The values of 7 
are in reasonably close agreement, and interpretations of the tables 
by mean square contingency methods, and by Pearson’s new 
method harmonize in every particular.   
III. Summary aND CONCLUSIONS 
(1) In the universe of extra-mural students there is a very 
definite relation between type of study and order of enrolment. 
In the three large teachers colleges of Missouri, as has been shown 
for each separately and for all combined, there is strong positive
-P-A-G-E-107
  ReEsIDENCE ENROLMENT AND SCHOLASTIC STANDING 107 
correlation between type of study and order of enrolment as we 
pass from correspondence through extension to residence on study 
variate while at the same time we pass from third enrolment to 
first, along the enrolment variate. 
(2) From the standpoint of order of enrolment, it appears 
that extension study is much more closely related to residence 
study than is correspondence study. This fact suggests that 
type of study represents contact with teacher, and that different 
degrees of this contact in diminishing strength are represented 
by residence, extension, and correspondence; and that order of 
enrolment represents established relationship with a school, and 
that different degrees of this relationship in diminishing strength 
are represented by first, second, and third enrolments; and that 
there is a strong correlation between contact with teacher and es- 
tablished relationship with a school. 
The close relationship noted between residence and extension 
study is suggestive. It would appear to have valuable implica- 
tions for administrators, especially if this close relationship should 
be exhibited in other comparisons also. For instance, would it 
not be advisable to devote more of the energies of a faculty to ex- 
tension rather than to correspondence instruction?

  CHAPTER VIII 
CoLLeGr GRADUATES AND EXTRA-MURAL STUDY 
In this chapter the following questions are considered: 
(1) What is the influence of extra-mural study on residence 
enrolment among college graduates? 
(2) What is the relation between type of study and order of 
enrolment among college graduates? 
(3) How does the influence of extra-mural study on resi- 
dence enrolment among college graduates compare with that 
among students in general? 
I. NuMBER AND ORDER OF ENROLMENT OF STUDENTS RECEIV- 
ING BACHELOR’S DEGREES 
1. Introductory statement 
The purpose of this chapter is to consider the influence of 
extra-mural study on residence enrolment in the universe of 
graduates of three Missouri state teachers colleges and Macomb 
State Teachers College, Macomb, Illinois. 
If the extra-mural student is ‘‘serious minded, persistent 
and capable” as stated in so many extension course bulletins, sure- 
ly the influences of extra-mural study will be at a maximum in 
the universe of college graduates, especially if the universe is 
further limited to a second universe of graduates who had extra- 
mural study. 
Data were secured relative to graduates at Kirksville, War- 
rensburg, Springfield, and Macomb. At Kirksville the tabula- 
tion extends from September, 1918 to September, 1923; at War- 
rensburg and Springfield, from September, 1919 to September, 
1923; and at Macomb, from September, 1920 to September, 1923. 
Macomb has only recently offered four-year college curricula; 
consequently, the number of graduates from Macomb is too small 
to justify any well defined conclusions. 
2. Tabulations by schools and years 
a. Data included 
The tabulations below show the number of persons receiving 
the bachelor’s degree by years, the order of enrolment in the differ- 
ent types of study, the number of students in each type, the per 
cent of the total number of students in each type, and the per 
cent of the total number of students in correspondence and 
extension combined, the total number of extra-mural studies, 
and the average number of extra-mural studies for all students 
and also for all extra-mural students alone. 
In the tables below, F stands for first enrolment, S for second 
enrolment, T for third enrolment, where a student may have one 
enrolment or no enrolment at all in each type of study—residence, 
correspondence, and extension.

d. Observations and comparisons 
There are many interesting observations in connection with 
tables under (b) and (c). The following ones are noted: 
(1) At Kirksville, Warrensburg, and Springfield respectively 
1 out of 2.6, 1 out of 1.9, and 1 out of 2.3 persons being graduated 
had correspondence study. Macomb offers but few correspond- 
ence courses. For all schools combined 1 out of 2.5 graduates 
has had one or more courses by correspondence. For the three 
Missouri schools during the lastfour years 1 out of 2.3 graduates 
had correspondence study. 
(2) At Kirksville, Warrensburg, Springfield, and Macomb 
respectively 1 out of 6.7, 1 out of 4.4, 1 out of 4.7, and 1 out of 5.2 
graduates had extension study. For all schdols combined 1 out 
of 5.1 had one or more courses by extension study. For the 
three Missouri schools under (c) 1 out of 5 had extension study. 
(3) At Kirksville, Warrensburg, Springfield, and Macomb 
respectively 1 out of 2.4, 1 out of 1.8, 1 out of 1.9, and 1 out of 
5.2 had either correspondence or extension study, or both. For 
all schools combined 1 out of 2.1 persons graduating had earned 
credit in some form of extra-mural study. For the three Mis- 
souri schools under (c) 1 graduate out of 2 had some form of extra- 
mural study. 
(4) At Kirksville, Warrensburg, Springfield, and Macomb 
respectively the average number of extra-mural studies (2.5 se- 
mester hours each) is .99, 1.65, 1.52, and 1.16; for all schools com- 
bined it is 1.34; for the three Missouri schools under (c) it is 1.40. 
(5) At Kirksville, Warrensburg, Springfield, and Macomb 
respectively the average number of extra-mural studies for extra- 
mural students being graduated is 2.33, 2.92, 2.95, and 6.00; for 
all schools combined it is 2.82; and for three Missouri schools 
under (¢) it is 2.77. 
(6) At Kirksville, Warrensburg, Springfield, and Macomb 
respectively 1 out of 381, 1 out of 162, 1 out of 42, and 1 out of 16 
had extra-mural study first. For all schools combined 1 out of 
every 88 persons receiving a bachelor’s degree had extra-mural 
study before being enrolled in residence. For the three Missouri 
schools under (c) 1 person out of 106 had extra-mural study first. 
In other words, in the three large teachers colleges of Missouri, out 
of 852 persons being graduated in the last four years, only 8 had 
extra-mural study before enrolling for residence study. 
3. Summary 
So we may say when we are thinking of the typical graduate 
of a teachers college, particularly in Missouri, that there are 2 
chances out of 5 that he has had correspondence study; 1 out of 
5 that he has had extension study; and 1 out of 2 that he has had 
some form of extra-mural study. If we know merely that he is a 
teachers college graduate, we may think of him as having com- 
pleted 3.5 semester hours in extra-mural study, and 116.5, in resi-
-P-A-G-E-112

dence. But, if we know that he is a graduate with extra-mural 
study, we may think of him as having completed 7 semester hours 
in extra-mural study, and 113, in residence. If he comes from 
teachers colleges at large, there is 1 chance out of 88 that his first 
enrolment was in extra-mural study in the institution where he was 
graduated; but if he comes from a Missouri teachers college, there 
is 1 chance out of 106 that his first enrolment was in extra-mural 
study in the institution where he was graduated. 
II. OTHER METHODS OF ANALYSIS 
1. Type of study and order of enrolment 
A quantitative expression is now sought for the relationship 
between type of study and order of enrolment among the grad- 
uates of the three teachers colleges of Missouri for the four years 
1919 to 1923. In fairness to extra-mural study it is necessary to 
exclude all students for these four years who did not also have 
extra-mural study of some type. This universe deals with grad- 
uates who have had both residence and extra-mural study. 
The two tables which follow can be deduced directly from 
Table XLIII.

This coefficient shows that the association between residence 
and first enrolment in the Missouri teachers colleges is practically 
perfect in the universe of graduates who have had extra-mural 
study also. It is evidently unnecessary to consider the whole 
universe of graduates. This coefficient of association shows that - 
extra-mural study first, is also a negligible factor in leading to 
residence enrolment among graduates of teachers colleges. 
2. Strength of association 
In order to find the strength of association between type of 
study and order of enrolment use is made of Pearson’s mean 
square contingency coefficient as explained in Chapter I.

If we take in Table XLV rows (1) and (2) and form associa-

column marked third enrolment, and then take rows (2) and (3) 
and proceed in the same manner, we get two sets of ratios -desig- 
nated as (1) and (2). These ratios pass from tetrad to tetrad, 
each row containing two tetrads.

In set (2) a>b, b<e, and the signs run +—. 
Thus, only in the last tetrad does the distribution fail to be 
isotropic, and it is significant that this place is the same one at 
which the distributions failed to be isotropic in Tables XXXV, 
XXXVI, and XXXVII of Chapter VII. We observe, therefore, 
that, if we take the first two rows of Table XLV, residence is 
positively associated with first enrolment when extension and 
second enrolment are considered, and positively associated with 
second enrolment when extension and third enrolment are con- 
sidered. Set (2) shows, if we take rows (2) and (3), that extension 
is positively associated with first enrolment when correspondence 
and extension are considered, but negatively associated with 
second enrolment when correspondence and third enrolment are 
considered, These results show, with the exception noted in the 
last tetrad, as we pass, in type of study, from residence through 
extension to correspondence, that enrolments pass from first en- 
rolment, through the second, to the third. However, there is a 
turning back in the fourth tetrad. But, in the whole distribu- 
tion, if we consider residence as holding the extreme positive 
position in type of study, extension, an intermediate position, 
and correspondence as coming next in order; and, likewise, con- 
sider first enrolment as holding the extreme positive position in 
order of enrolment, while second and third enrolments follow in 
succession, we may then say that, as the type of study advances, 
the order of enrolment advances, too, and that there is a very 
strong positive association between type of study and order of 
enrolment. This fact is indicated by Q=.993 in Table XLIV, 
and C=.69in Table XLV. When Pearson’s correction 
(m—1) (n—1) 
Roc NES ar 
is applied to C?, the value of C as given above is urchanged. 
The large value of C here, as also in Chapter VII, indicates that 
“type of study” represents contact with teacher, and, as contact 
increases as represented in succession by residence, extension, and 
correspondence, that order of enrolment increases in strength as 
represented by first, second, and third enrolments. 
IIT. Summary AND CONCLUSIONS 
(1) The influence of extra-mural study in leading to resi- 
dence enrolment is negligible among the graduates of teachers 
colleges, particularly those of Missouri. 
(2) Type of study appears to represent contact with teach- 
er, and is highly correlated with order of enrolment. 
(3) The influence of extra-mural study on residence enrol- 
ment, and the relation of type of study to order of enrolment, as 
shown by coefficients of association and of mean contingency, are 0041

  about the same for college graduates as for students in general. 
However, in both respects students in general make the better 
showing. 
Instead of the influence of extra-mural study on residence en- 
rolment being a maximum among college graduates, it is a mini- 
mum in comparison with its influence among students in general. 
This fact indicates that students who begin with extra-mural 
study quit school before graduation, and fail to meet the stand- 
ards required of well prepared teachers.

d. Interpretation of table 
A close examination of the replies received shows that the 
great, majority of the total number of answers given, counting  
-P-A-G-E-118

first, second, and third reasons, can be grouped under three main 
headings as follows: (a) Economic considerations; (b) Accessi- 
bility; (c) Reputation and high standing of the school. Under 
Economic considerations can be placed the headings, “less cost” 
with 152 replies, and “student employment” with 44 replies, or a 
total of 196 replies. Under Accessibility can be placed the head- 
ings, ‘‘near home and convenient’’ with 273 replies, and “home 
town” with 93 replies, or a total of 366 replies. Under Reputation 
and high standing of the school, can be placed “reputation and 
high standing of school” with 267 replies, ‘strong departments” 
with 97 replies, and ‘influence of faculty members” with 24 re- 
plies, or a total of 388 replies. Hence, 950 out of 1456 replies, or 
65 per cent of the total number, can be grouped under these three 
main heads. If the first or chief reason for attending school at 
Kirksville is considered, 20 replies can be placed under Economic 
considerations; 225, under Accessibility; and 124, under Reputa- 
tion and high standing of the school, or a total of 369 out of 522 
replies making 70.7 per cent of all replies given as first or chief 
reason for attending school at Kirksville. The second and third 
columns make equally as good showings under these three main 
divisions. Underthe heading, Economic considerations, the show- 
ing is better. 
Therefore students are attending school at Kirksville for 
three outstanding reasons: (a) Economic considerations, (b) 
Accessibility, (¢) Reputation and high standing of the school. 
The first and second factors are mainly constant and beyond 
control of the school, but the third is not. So naturally it is de- 
sirable to know the most effective means whereby students learn 
of the reputation and high standing of the school they attend 
since this item is so influential in promoting residence enrolment. 
and varies in proportion to the efforts put forth by the institution. 
2. Second questionnaire 
a. Purpose 
All headings in the previous questionnaire, and answers 
written therein, were studied carefully, and a-second question- 
naire was prepared for finding out the sources of information that 
revealed the reputation and high standing of the school and led to 
residence enrolment. In this questionnaire economic considera- 
tions and accessibility were frankly admitted and excluded from 
the discussion since they were well known and mainly beyond the 
control of the institution. Wherefore all attention was centered 
on discovering the sources of information that revealed the repu- 
tation and high standing of the school. With this purpose in 
mind a second questionnaire of the following form was submitted: 
b. Form 
A recent study in a teachers college shows that (aside from 
economic considerations and accessibility) the principal reason 
why students enroll for residence study is the reputation and 
high standing of the school.

c. Nature of replies 
This questionnaire was answered by 446 students at Kirks- 
ville during the spring quarter of 1923 and by 709 students during 
the summer quarter of 1923. There are no duplications of answers 
for the quarters. The same questionnaire was answered, during 
the summer quarter of 1923, by 479 students at Warrensburg and 
638 students at Cape Girardeau. 
There were relatively few persons who wrote answers in blank 
spaces (11), or (12); and, with not more than a half dozen ex- 
ceptions, such answers either came under some one of the ten head- 
ings listed above or could be excluded because of being some 
economic consideration or some phase of accessibility. Where an 
answer was excluded, succeeding reasons were advanced accord- 
ingly in tabulating the data. 
d. Type of data 
At first it might be thought that the data involved in Table 
XLVII and subsequent tables constitute a mean square contin- 
gency distribution. But after a moment’s reflection it is clear 
that it is not such a distribution. The columns of order of in- 
fluence 1, 2, 3, and 4 supplement or strengthen each other to make 
a totality of influences which give information that leads to en- 
rolment. In a contingency, or association table the numbers 
along cross diagonals, in adjacent rows and columns, work against 
each other and reduce the association. Manifestly this condi- 
tion does not hold in these tables. For instance, consider Table 
XLVII which follows in the next paragraph. The first tetrad in 
the upper left hand corner of the table is as follows: 
Bulletins and circulars, first, 54; second, 61 
LN
-P-A-G-E-120
120 Tur RELATION OF EX'TRA-MURAL STUDY TO 
Newspapers and advertising, first, 12; second, 11 
Evidently bulletins and circulars are a much stronger in- 
fluence than newspaper advertising in bringing students into 
residence. Butif association formulae are employed Q=—.097, a 
negative association between bulletins and leading influence. 
Now suppose the frequency in the second order of influence under 
bulletins is decreased by 13, and becomes 48 instead of 61. Evi- 
dently the influence of bulletins is less in producing enrolment, 
than it was before the change. But if association formulae are 
now employed Q=.016, a positive association between bulletins 
and first influence when compared with newspaper advertising 
and second order of influence. The two results are contradictory 
and impossible if interpreted as measures of influence leading to 
residence enrolment. Association formulae do not give in this 
instance what we wish to know.. We wish to find the sum total 
of influence which bulletins exert on residence enrolment, and 
any increase in lower orders of influence must increase the total 
influence, provided higher orders of influence remain constant. 
Therefore association formulae do not apply to these tables. But 
the whole theory of mean square contingency depends upon the 
association of attributes with multiple classes; hence, it is evident 
that the mean square contingency coefficient is not applicable here. 
e. Tabulation of replies 
The following table is a tabulation of replies from the forms 
filled out at Kirksville during the spring quarter of 1923:

f. Interpretation of table 
Beginning at the left of the top row of the table we read as 
follows: 54 students state that bulletins and circulars furnished 
the information that influenced them most to enroll at Kirksville; 
61, state that bulletins and circulars influenced them second only 
to some other source of information to enroll at Kirksville. The 
reading proceeds similarly under headings “third” and “fourth” 
in the next twocolumns. Finally, 249 students were influenced 
to some degree through bulletins and circulars to enroll at Kirks- 
ville. The same interpretation is to be applied to the nine remain- 
ing headings for sources of information. Under the last row marked 
“totals”, there were 446 students that gave first or leading influ- 
ences; 428, influences of second rank; 413, influences of third rank; 
and 383, influences of fourth rank. <A total of 1670 replies was 
given in which each student made from 1 to 4 replies. 
II. A METHOD DEVISED FOR DEALING WITH MATERIAL 
1. General survey of material 
It is admitted, of course, that the type of data used in this 
chapter is largely a matter of opinion, On the other hand, the 
opinion comes from the only persons who have a right to advance 
it without proof. This chapter seeks to find whether the opinion 
of students as to leading influences which induced them to attend 
college accords with facts brought out in this study. 
2. Strength of influence defined 
Attention is directed to the consideration of Table XLVII. 
Aside from a mere inspection of this table, and of those imme- 
diately following, difficulties are encountered in comparing sources 
of information and orders of influence because there is no common 
unit of measure. If it were known positively in Table XLVII that 
“bulletins and circulars” in the first column actually brought 
54 students to school and that ‘newspaper advertising” brought 
12, we could say that “bulletins and circulars” bring into school 
4.5 times as many students as does “newspaper advertising’. 
We could then say that the strength of an influence is proportional 
to its frequencies. In most cases, however, there are influences at 
work other than the first order influences. Then it appears that 
our best working assumption is that among first order influences, 
indicated by the first column, the strength of each particular in- 
fluence of the first order is proportional to the number expressing 
its frequency. Likewise among second, third, and fourth orders 
of influence, indicated by second, third, and fourth columns re- 
spectively, we assume that the strength of each particular influence 
of second, third, and fourth orders is proportional to the number 
expressing its frequency. Thus strength of influence is defined. 
Evidently it can also be expressed as per cent of the total influ- 
ence of the column to which it belongs. 
3. Orders of influence 
We can now make comparisons of influences of the same order
-P-A-G-E-122
  122 THE RELATION OF EXTRA-MURAL STUDY TO 
in acolumn. But we cannot make comparisons as we pass from 
column to column, or to column of totals, since evidently these 
orders of influence are of different weights. For instance, if we 
used the first column alone to get an idea of the relative total 
strength of different types of influence such as that represented 
by ‘“‘visitation of high schools” with a small number for its fre- 
quency in the first column and relatively large numbers in the re- 
maining columns, it is clear that ‘visitation of high schools” 
would be underrated as an influence, whereas that represented 
by “teachers in home schools’ with a large number in the first 
column and relatively small numbers in the remaining columns 
would be overrated. On the other hand if we use the ordinary 
arithmetic mean of columns, or its equivalent, the column of 
totals with units one fourth as large as in the column of means, 
all cases such as that cited above as being underrated are now 
in general overrated, since influences of second, third, and fourth 
orders are now counting on a par with first order influences, and 
their frequencies were assumed to be large; whereas those that were 
overrated are now in general underrated. Hence in general the 
first column and the column of means will give the upper and 
lower limits of the total strength exerted by various types of in- 
fluences in producing enrolment. 
If we knew the weights to attach to the orders of influence, 
we should be able to assign to each particular influence a value 
expressed either as a number or a per cent; and then the total 
strength of each influence could be compared with that of any other 
influence. Now the values of these weights can be determined 
by assuming that the number of students brought in by fourth, 
third, second, and first order influences lies under the area included 
between the probability curve and the x-axis. This assumption 
is the only defensible one to make. 
4. Determination of weights of orders of influence 
Let us break off our curve at 30 on each side of the median. 
Then the total interval along the base line (x-axis) is 60, and 
_ Wwe measure from the extreme left of this interval as origin to the 
right. The base line for the probability curve will be divided 
into 7 equal intervals, and we are concerned evidently with the 
first four as we pass from left to right. The argument is similar 
to that used in Part Two, Chapter I, for establishing proper numer- 
ical values to attach to a five point grading system where credit 
for quality of work is recognized by appropriate weights. 
If we divide 60 by 7, we have .86¢ as intervals. Since the 
outer intervals contain very few frequencies, and many writers 
break off the curve at 5c, let us take the two outer intervals as 
lo each and all intermediate intervals as .8c. The following 
diagram will help to make the meaning clear:

Measuring from A, we have as abscissae of limiting ordinates 0,

we have 0, —.4c, —1.2c, —2o0, —3c; measuring to the right, we 
have .4¢, 1.20, 2c, and 3c. From the probability curve, by use 
of Table III, page 389, of Rugg’s SratisticaL Mutuop AppLiED TO 
EpucatTion, the area (frequencies) between ordinates at e and f is 
31 per cent of the whole area between the curve and the x-axis; 
the area between ordinates at d and e, 23 per cent of the whole 
area; the area between ¢ and d, 9.3 per cent; and the area between 
A and ¢, 2.2 per cent of the whole area. The same per cents 
hold to the right. 
By means of Table VI, page 396, of Rugg’s Statistica, Mrru- 
op AppLIED TO Epucation, the abscissa of the median of the area 
under the curve from A toc is (for 1/2 of 2.2 percent of area=1.1 
per cent of area) M;=.750, measured from A. The area from A 
to the second median = 2.2 per cent of area + 1/2 of 9.3 per cent of 
area=6.95 per cent of area. Measured from A, the abscissa of 
this median for the area c to d is M.=1.530. Similarly for 23 
per cent of the area which gives the abscissa of the median of the 
area from d to e, M3=2.27c, and for 50 per cent of the area, which 
gives the abscissa of the median from e to f, My=3c. By addi- 
tions of relative increases due to the symmetry of the curve M;= 
3.730, Mg=4.47¢, and M;=5.25e for the remaining intervals from 
left to right. 
But the order of influences, fourth, third, second, and first, 
as they lead to enrolments, are respectively represented by the 
intervals A-c, c-d, d-e, e-f along the base line. The strength 
or value of each order of influence in producing enrolment, as ex- 
pressed in a common unit, is represented by the abscissa of the 
median of its interval. It is at once seen that if M:=.75c is taken 
as the standard of measure, each succeeding abscissa of medians 
of areas (enrolments) is obtained almost exactly by multiplying 
M,=.75c by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 respectively. But this particular 
curve is taken only through the fourth interval from the left, 
therefore 2, 3, and 4 are used as multipliers of the value of the 
fourth order of influence taken as a standard, to give the medians 
of abscissae or values of the other influences. This result shows 
that if we multiply the values or strengths of influences in the first: 
column by 4, those in the second column by 3, those in the third 
column by 2, and those in the fourth column by 1, they are all 
expressed in a common unit which has the strength of influence in  
-P-A-G-E-124
  124 Tur RELATION OF EXTRA-MURAL STUDY TO 
the fourth column as a standard.* But by our first assumption 
strength or value of influence in any column is proportional to the 
number expressing its frequency. Hence, if we multiply the fre- 
quencies in the first column by 4, those in the second, by 3, those 
in the third, by 2, and leave those in the fourth as they are, then 
the strength of influence in each column is proportional to these 
products, and is measured in terms of the same unit, and we may 
make comparisons of strength of influence as we pass from column 
to column. In a grading system the numbers 1, 2,3, 4, 5,6, 7 are 
weights to increase credit for quality of work; here they are weights 
to increase strength of influence because of order of influence, and 
extend only from 1 to 4 inclusive in this chapter. It is also inter- 
esting to note that the weights 1, 2, 3, 4 turned out to be the 
rankings applied in reverse order. 
5. Total strength of influence determined 
The frequencies in each column may be taken as an ob- 
served value of a quantity (strength of influence), and by methods 
of least squares __3pM 
Z =p ’ 
where z is the most probable value of the quantity (strength of 
influence), M, any observation (frequency), and p, its weight. 
It is evident, by applying this formula to the whole distribu- 
tion, that a new column of weighted means is obtained where each 
frequency is one tenth as large as it is in a column of totals obtained 
after multiplying each frequency of the distribution by the weight 
of its column. This column is very important in tables of this 
chapter, and is referred to as the ‘‘ weighted mean column’’, 
The method devised makes it possible to extend the tables 
dealing with views of students and to interpret results. 
III. CompLetr TABULATIONS OF DATA 
1. Tables—year, 1923 
Influences leading to residence enrolment are shown in the 
following tables:   
*Instead of extending the curve four equal intervals to the right and dis- 
tributing the frequencies of the three remaining intervals proportionally over 
the first four intervals as assumed above, the whole curve might be used by 
taking three equal intervals to the right and then by taking the fourth inter- 
val (Fig. 6) from 2.60 to 60. This gives the abscissa of the median of this in- 
terval measured from e to B, M4=3.440. If M:=.75c is taken as the unit 
of measure, each succeeding abscissa of medians of areas is obtained by mul- 
tiplying .750 by 2, 3, and 4.6 respectively. Were this plan used the weighted 
mean column of succeeding tables would be obtained by multiplying fre- 
quencies in fourth, third, second, and first columns by 1, 2, 3, and 4.6 respec- 
tively and by dividing the sum by 10.6. This plan causes the weighted mean 
column to conform somewhat more closely to the first column than does the plan 
used. However, it complicates all computations considerably and changes 
results very slightly; hence, the simpler plan was chosen for the data of this 
chapter.

2. Comments 
Table L which consists of Tables XLVIII and XLIX com- 
bined, is a good sample of the whole year’s enrolment at Kirksville 
in as much as the number answering the questionnaire in Table 
XLVIII is approximately one half the number of different stu- 
dents for the fall, winter, and spring quarters; whereas the num- 
ber answering the questionnaire in Table XLIX is approximately 
one half the number of summer term students. 
There are many interesting comparisons and deductions that 
can be drawn from these tables. In every item for each school 
there are similarities and contrasts. However, there was one 
leading purpose for securing these data and constructing these 
tables; namely, to find out how extra-mural study ranks as an in- 
fluence leading to residence enrolment; and in the main the dis- 
cussion which follows shall be in harmony with this purpose. 
IV. RevtasiLiry OF NEW METHOD TESTED 
1. Position of column of weighted means 
In the six tables where 60 comparisons are made, with only 
5 minor exceptions, varying in amount from .2 to .7 of 1 per cent, 
each value in the column of weighted means, which expresses 
strength of influence, falls between the per cents in the first col- 
umn and in the column of means as found under heading (b). 
This statement is also true under heading (a) of the tables. In 
other words, as was foreseen, the first column and the column 
of means will in general give upper and lower limits for the total 
strength of any type of influence listed in the tables. More- 
over, under heading (c) of the tables, which deals with rank order 
of frequencies or strength of influence, the weighted mean column 
for each type of influence in the six tables coincides in rank with 
the first column or column of means or, lies between the two in 
every instance but one, where it fails by one half of the unit rank 
interval. 
2. Coefficients of correlation between columns 
Further justification can be found for the use of the weighted 
mean as a measure of relationships in the foregoing tables. Let us 
use heading (¢) which deals with rank order of columns, and find 
by Spearman’s rank order method the correlation between types 
of influence in the first. column and the column of means, in the 
first column and the column of weighted means, and in the col- 
umn of means and the column of weighted means. In the tabu- 
lations as they originally stood, doubtless, the first column and 
the column of means would be selected as the columns that would 
give the most valuable information. So we use these columns 
here and let rym be the correlation of the column of means with 
the first column; rw, the correlation of the column of weighted 
means with the first column; and rmw, the correlation of the col- 
umn of means with the column of weighted means. When the 
calculations are made for each table, the following results are se- 
cured:

The column of weighted means in the six tables has a correla- 
tion of .909, or more, with the first column and a correlation of 
.936 or more with the column of means. In either case the cor- 
relation is so high that if the column of weighted means were used 
as a measure instead of either of the other columns, the con- 
clusions drawn could not go far astray even though it were granted 
that one of these columns represented absolutely the true situa- 
tion. Also it is noted in every case that rim lies between rw 
and rmw; in other words, the correlation of the weighted mean, 
with both: the first column and the column of means, is in each 
case higher than the correlation of the first column and the col- 
umn of means with each other. These relations indicate that the 
column of weighted means is intermediate between the first col- 
umn and the column of means. Also it is observed, in every 
case save one, rmw>ryw. Hence the column of weighted means 
conforms somewhat more closely to the column of means than it 
does to the first column. 
3. Reliability of column of weighted means 
It has been shown not only by direct proof but by every 
test available in a concrete situation represented by six different 
universes of observation, that the column of weighted means takes 
an intermediate position between the two extremes represented 
by the first column and the column of means, and that it is the 
most reliable single statement of relations available for dealing 
with the data of this chapter. The foregoing considerations give 
assurance that the column of weighted means can be used with 
great confidence for comparisons in the same and in different 
tables.

V. FINAL EXPRESSION FOR STRENGTH OF INFLUENCE 
1. Tabulation of columns of weighted means 
Attention is now directed to a relatively simple tabulation 
for making comparisons and drawing conclusions. The follow- 
ing table shows the weighted means or strength of influence ex- 
pressed in per cent for each type of influence for each table:

The first remarkable property of this table is the uniformity 
noticeable in rows and in columns. No such regularity could ex- 
ist without well founded, underlying reasons. If column (1) be 
excluded, the agreement is still closer; and column (1), it will be

   134 Tuer RELATION OF EXTRA-MURAL STUDY TO 
  recalled, deals with spring term students at Kirksville, who are 
typical of the students for the regular school year, whereas the 
other columns deal chiefly or all together with summer term stu- 
dents. Column (3) is the summary of (1)’and (2); column (6) 
is the summary of columns (3), (4), and (5). 
In every column ‘teachers in home schools” have an influence 
equal to or greater than that of any other enumerated influence in 
producing enrolment. Warrensburg stands at the head in this 
respect, and there is substantial justification in oft repeated as- 
sertions that Warrensburg students are loyal to their alma mater. 
However, the showings made by ‘visitation of high schools” and 
“high school meets’’ are not as good at Warrensburg as at Kirks- 
ville, and at Cape Girardeau. The differences noted are prob- 
ably due to variations in methods of publicity. 
Extra-mural study as an influence leading to residence enrol- 
ment is now considered. In column (1) which is typical of three 
quarters of the year at Kirksville, the influence of extra-mural 
study in the free choice of an institution, aside from economic 
considerations and accessibility, stands lowest in the column, and 
is represented by a strength of .9 of 1 per cent; inother words, extra- 
mural study is the compelling reason for residence enrolment in 
less than 1 case out of 100. It is to be remembered that the 
spring quarter represents the three quarters of the regular school 
year, whereas the summer quarter represents no other quarter of 
the year. Unfortunately the replies from Warrensburg and 
Springfield came exclusively from summer term students; conse- 
quently, the samples from these schools are of a type to make the 
very best showing for extra-mural study since the extra-mural 
students are most numerous in summer quarters. For summer 
term students at Kirksville the strength of influence of ‘extra- 
mural study” is 3.8 per cent which is less than that of any other 
type save ‘‘newspapers and advertising’. A like condition is 
found at Warrensburg and Cape Girardeau. But at Cape Gi- 
rardeau the strength of “extra-mural study” is only .2 of 1 per 
cent higher than that of “newspapers and advertising”. Also 
in the summary of replies in column (6) “extra-mural study” is 
next to lowest, and exceeds “newspapers and advertising”? by only 
4 of 1 per cent. 
If we had had replies from the enrolment at Warrensburg 
and Cape Girardeau for the whole year instead of the summer 
alone, the indications are, because of the better showing made 
by “newspapers and advertising’’ in these schools, that ‘“extra- 
mural study” as an influence leading to residence enrolment would 
fall below, or at most, equal ‘‘newspapers and advertising”’. 
Therefore, the best that can be said for “extra-mural study” 
when all schools are considered, is that it ranks next to lowest in 
the ten influences leading to residence enrolment and that it has a 
strength of 3.2 per cent in the teachers colleges of Missouri, where
-P-A-G-E-135
RESIDENCE ENROLMENT AND ScHouastic StaNpING = 135 
2272 different students expressed their views, and that it is the 
leading influence in bringing 1 student out of 31 into residence. 
However, if the spring quarter at Kirksville is considered typical 
of the other teachers colleges for the three quarters of the regular 
school year, then ‘‘extra-mural study” stands lowest of all enu- 
merated influences leading to residence enrolment, and has a strength 
of .9 of 1 per cent, and is the leading influence in bringing into 
residence 1 student out of 111. So the expressed views of stu- 
dents, in a universe most favorable to extra-mural study, coincide 
quite definitely with previous findings, and the conclusion is 
reached that ‘‘extra-mural study” exercises a very minor influence 
on residence enrolment. 
VI. SumMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 
The position of extra-mural study as an influence leading to 
residence enrolment, as determined from consensus of views of 
students, is as follows: 
(1) “Extra-mural study” ranks lowest among ten enumerat- 
ed influences leading to residence enrolment for students of the 
regular school year at Kirksville. Next lowest are “newspapers 
and advertising”, whereas ‘teachers in home schools” stand 
highest. 
(2) “Extra-mural study” ranks next to lowest among ten 
enumerated influences leading to residence enrolment for stu- 
dents of the summer quarter at Kirksville, Warrensburg, and Cape 
Girardeau. ‘‘ Newspapers and advertising’’ stand lowest, where- 
as ‘‘teachers in home schools” stand highest. 
(3) “Extra-mural study” exercises a very minor influence 
on residence renrolment, and the expressed views of students 
coincide quite definitely with the statistical findings of earlier chap- 
ters. 
It is significant that the consensus of opinion of students 
with reference to the influence of extra-mural study on residence 
enrolment is directly opposed to that of educators as noted in 
Chapter II, Part One, but coincides quite definitely with the 
findings of a study based on statistical data.

SCHOLASTIC STANDING 
  
CHAPTER I 
Grapes IN DirFerRENT TyPEs or Stupy 
In this chapter the grading system at Kirksville is explained 
and justified, and the following questions are considered: 
(1) When one group of students has a single type of study 
and another group has two or more types, which group makes the 
higher grades in a given type of study? 
(2) In what type of study are grades highest? 
(3) In what type of study is variability among grades great- 
est? 
(4) Which type of study furnishes grades that are the best 
criteria of the grades in other types of study? 
I. InrRopUCTORY STATEMENT 
Under scholastic standing are included both rank in grades, 
and advancement in terms of semester hours of credit. It is 
admitted that the ranking of students, as revealed by grades, 
varies widely from teacher to teacher, and from subject to sub- 
ject, but it is our purpose to take these marks as they stand, and 
by applying to them the best methods available, find out what 
differences exist in the grades given to students in residence, in 
correspondence, ‘and in extension study at the Teachers College 
at Kirksville. 
Il. THE GRADING SYSTEM 
1. Plan of grading at Kirksville 
The grading system at Kirksville makes use of five letters as 
follows: F, failing; P, passing; G, medium; §, superior; and 
EF, excellent. Instead of attaching decimal values to these marks 
we assign values as follows: F=—10; P=—5; G=0; S=5; and 
E=10. These values are called honor points. The question 
at once arises as to the validity of these numerically assigned 
values. 
2. The system justified 
a. Proof 
It is easy to show that this system conforms well to the prob- 
ability curve. Let us break off the probability curve at 30 to 
the right and left of the median through the center of the curve. 
In a five point system of grading 6¢ is divided by 5, and gives 
1.2¢ as length of intervals.

Measuring from A, we have as abscissae of limiting ordinates 
0, 1.20, 2.40, 3.60, 4.80, and 6c. By means of the probability 
curve and Table III, page 389, of Rugg’s SratistrcaL Mrernop 
Apptrep TO Enucation, we find that the area (frequencies) be- 
tween ordinates at d and e is 45.14 per cent of the whole area be- 
tween the curve and x-axis; the area between ordinates at e and 
f is 23.84 per cent of the whole area; and the area between f and B 
is 3.5 per cent of the whole area. When we measure from the 
median to the left, the areas are of course 23.84 per cent and 3.5 
per cent respectively. 
By means of the probability curve we can find also the ab- 
scissa of the median of each area cut off by ordinates at the ex- 
tremities of the intervals A-c, e-d, d-e, e-f, f-B. As we pass 
from ordinate to ordinate from the extreme left to the right, 
these areas indicate the per cent of failures. The median abscissae 
of intervals, from which the weight to be applied to credit for 
quality is determined, can be found from Table VI, page 396, of 
Rugg’s SratisticaL Mrrnop Appiizp to Epucation. This 
table is worked out where all measurements are from the y-axis 
at the extreme left of the figure. 
The abscissa of the median of the area under the curve from 
Atoc (for 1/2 of 3.5 per cent of area = 1.75 per cent of area) is M,= 
.920; the abscissa of the median of the area under the curve from 
¢ to d (for 3.5 per cent of area + 1/2 of 23.84 per cent of area= 
       
 
-P-A-G-E-138

15.42 per cent of area) is M,=1.99¢; the abscissa of the median of 
the area from d to e is 30; and the other two are in order 4.01¢ 
and 5.08c. It is sufficiently accurate to write these abscissae 
as lo, 20, 30, 4c, and 5¢ respectively. It is thus seen that if we 
take 1c, which is the approximate abscissa of the median of the 
first interval, as a standard, the remaining abscissae of medians 
of intervals are obtained by multiplying lo by the weights 2, 3, 
4, and 5 respectively, or by adding successively lo to the abscissa 
of the median of the preceding interval. The abscissae along the 
x-axis in the figure measured from left to right are positive and 
represent grades; and since credit for quality of work is assumed to 
be proportional to grades, the abscissae may be thought of as 
representing also credit for grades earned. The middle interval, 
or any other, could be used as a standard of comparison. 
Thus credit for quality of work in the five intervals as repre- 
sented by grades F, P, G, 8, and E from left to right is 1o, 2c, 3c, 
4o, and 5o respectively. If we transform axes to the point (3¢,0), 
which is the center of the curve, the abscissae representing grades 
become respectively —20, —o, 0, lo, and 2¢ as shown in the 
figure. If o=5, credits for quality become —10, —5, 0, 5, 10 which 
are the actual values used at Kirksville in interpreting grades as 
honor points. These are very convenient values to use in aver- 
aging thousands of grades as was done in this study. After the 
average grade of each student was obtained, 10 was added to each 
average in order to avoid negative measures which are unde- 
sirable in tables. Then the values attached to the five point scale, 
as used in the tables of this chapter for purposes of computation, 
are 0, 5, 10, 15, 20. This procedure is equivalent to transforming 
axes from the center of the curve to (—2c, 0), or (—10, 0) where 
o=5. ‘ 
It is well known, and is easily proved, that the addition of a 
constant to the measures or observations of a distribution leaves 
the coefficients of correlation and regression unchanged, but 
increases the central tendencies and measures of dispersion by this 
constant. Hence, to pass back to central tendencies and meas- 
ures of dispersion in the original scale, we merely reverse the pro- 
cess and subtract the constant. The same reasoning applies 
when the measures are decreased by a constant. Hence, if we 
subtract 10 from all central tendencies and measures of dispersion 
as obtained from tables in Part Two, we shall have them reduced 
to the scale of values used in computing honor points at Kirksville. 
If we add 5 to all measures of central tendencies and dispersions, 
they will be reduced to a scale that exactly conforms to that of 
credit for quality, since 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, (the scale of our computa- 
tion) then become 5, 10, 15, 20, 25. which are in proportion to the 
weights to be applied to give credit for quality. If 15 had been 
added to each value of the scale —10, —5, 0, 5, 10, as used at 
Kirksville, we should get as values of our five point scale 5, 10,   
-P-A-G-E-139
ReEsIDENCE ENROLMENT AND ScHouastic StanpInG ~—- 139 
15, 20, 25 also, and the scale would exactly conform to the abscis- 
sae of medians of intervals. But there was much advantage in 
finding the average of grades for each individual with the scale 
—10, —5, 0, 5, 10 and then adding 10 instead of 15, to make the 
final grade of each individual as it appears in the tables of this chap- 
ter and succeeding ones. 
b. Conclusions 
Any scale of grading may be used that is of the form a+d, 
2a+d, 3a+d, 4a+d, 5a+d, where d is zero, positive, or negative, 
and in every such system of grading correlation and regression 
coefficients are unchanged, and measures of central tendency and 
dispersion can be reduced to the form a, 2a, 3a, 4a, 5a, as deduced 
from the figure in this chapter, by additions or subtractions of d. 
This fact completely justifies the numerical values assigned to 
grades at Kirksville, and the addition of 10 to each grade, and 
shows that, if we wish to pass back to the original values assigned, 
we subtract 10 from all measures of central tendency and of dis- 
persion and leave coefficients of correlation and of regression un- 
changed, and that, if we wish to go to the scale of form a, 2a, 3a, 
4a, 5a, we add 5 to all measures of central tendency and of dis- 
persion and leave coefficients of correlation and of regression un- 
changed. The same procedure would apply if we wished to change 
all the measures in a frequency distribution back to the original 
scale, or to a scale of the form a, 2a, 3a, 4a, and 5a. Also atten- 
tion is called to the fact that when F, P, G, S, and E are given 
values of 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 in computations, these letters repre- 
sent the intervals —2.5 to 2.5, 2.5 to 7.5, 7.5 to 12.5, 12.5 to 17.5, 
and 17.5 to 22.5. / 
3. Grades that were studied 
The grades of all students, residence, correspondence, and 
extension, for the school year of 1919-1920 were considered. All 
grades for all quarters during which the student was at Kirksville 
were included, and as stated before, F, P, G, 8, and E were as- 
signed values of —10, —5, 0, 5, and 10 respectively. The arith- 
metic mean of all grades was taken as the most probable grade, 
and gave the rank of the student. The scale of values adopted 
made additions easy. This result was very desirable since there 
were, all told, grades for 3485 students many of whom had more 
than one type of study, and frequently as many as 48 courses or 
more. For tabular purpose 10 was added to each rank obtained 
by the law of averages and the sum gave the student’s rank as 
used for purposes of calculation. In nearly all instances residence, 
correspondence, and extension grades were treated separately, 
and were not averaged to make up a single grade or rank except 
in cases specifically mentioned where correspondence and ex- 
tension grades were thrown together to make up a rank for extra- 
mural study.

1. Residence and correspondence grades, residence-corre- 
spondence universe 
a. Relations | 
The grades of 340 students who have had both residence and 
correspondence study at Kirksville are considered. Comparisons 
of grades in different types of study are made by means of corre- 
lation and contingency tables. In the contingency table the in- 
tervals for F, P,G,S, and E are as indicated in II:2-b. Tables I 
and Ia which follow serve to show the facts concerning residence 
and correspondence study for this group of students. 
In these and succeeding tabulations A will be used to repre- 
sent arithmetic mean, or mean; M, median; o, standard devia- 
tion; r, coefficient of correlation; », correlation ratio; and C, con- 
tingency coefficient. Subscripts r, ¢, e, and x are attached to 
indicate whether the foregoing measures apply to residence, cor- 
respondence, extension, or extra-mural study. 
Table I shows that for residence grades the mean is 13.1 and 
the median 13; for correspondence grades the mean is 14.6 and 
the median, 15.3. The standard deviation of residence grades is 
2.33, that of correspondence grades is 4.03, and the correlation 
of residence grades with correspondence grades is r=.28-+.04, and 
the correlation ratio is qre=.34-+.03. The correlation ratio is 
read, ‘the correlation of residence on correspondence grades”, and 
may differ considerably from the correlation of correspondence on 
residence grades. The well-known test of linear regression is 
WANG a: ieee ae EV <5 eras hans 
Here it gives 2.3<2.5 which shows that the regression is linear 
and that the coefficient of correlation is a reliable measure of the 
relationship. 
The coefficients of regression are: 
bi=1s = (48; be=1 or 
  Therefore the regression equations are: 
c =b,;R or c =.48R 
R=bec or R=.16e 
From Table Ia the coefficient of contingency is C=.27.

(6) C = .27 
The following observations are made: (1) The arithmetic 
mean of correspondence grades is 1.5 units higher than that of 
residence grades. This difference measured in terms of the stand- 
ard deviation of residence grades is .63 of the standard deviation. 
(2) The median of correspondence grades is 2.3 units higher 
than the median of residence grades. This difference equals the 
standard deviation of residence grades. Thus in both tests of 
averages, correspondence grades are higher than residence grades 
at Kirksville. (3) The standard deviation of correspondence 
grades is larger than that of residence grades by 1.7 units, or it is 
1.74 times the standard deviation of residence grades. (4) The 
coefficients of correlation and contingency show a moderate de- 
gree of relationship between residence and correspondence grades. 
(5) From the first regression equation in (5) we observe that for 
a student, whose correspondence grades vary a unit from the 
mean of the universe of correspondence grades, it is to be predicted 
that, on this account alone, his residence grades will vary from

the mean of the universe of residence grades by .16 of a unit and 
in the same direction. From the second regression equation we 
observe that for a student, whose residence grades vary a unit. 
from the mean of the universe of residence grades, it is to be pre- 
dicted that, on this account alone, his correspondence grades will 
vary from the mean of the universe of correspondence grades 
by .48 of a unit and in the same direction. These results show 
that residence grades are a much better index of correspondence 
grades than correspondence grades are of residence grades. 
c. Conclusions 
The following conclusions are reached as to residence and 
correspondence grades at Kirksville: (1) Correspondence grades 
are appreciably higher than residence grades. (2) Variability 
among correspondence grades is much wider than that among resi- 
dence grades. (8) Residence grades are a much better index 
of correspondence grades, than correspondence grades are of 
residence grades. 
2. Residence and extension grades, residence-extension 
universe 
a. Relations 
The grades of 227 students who have had both residence and 
correspondence study at Kirksville are considered. Tables II and 
Ila which follow serve to show the facts relative to residence 
and correspondence study of this group. 
Table II shows that for residence grades the mean is 13.1 
and the median, 12.9; for extension grades the mean is 13.9 and 
the median, 13.6 The standard deviation of residence grades is 
2.29, that of extension grades is 3.56, and the correlation of 
residence grades with extension grades is r=.47+.03. This 
correlation is so high that there is no need to find the correla- 
tion ratio. 
The coefficients of regression are: 
ge ». or S 
by=r—=.72 and be=r— =.30. or ge 
Therefore the regression equations are E=.72R, and R=.30E. 
From Table Ila the coefficient of mean square contingency is

The following observations are made: (1) The arithmetic 
mean of extension grades is .8 of a unit higher than that of resi- 
dence grades. This difference equals .35 of the standard devia- 
tion of residence grades. (2) The median of extension grades is 
.7 of a unit higher than that of residence grades. This difference 
equals .3 of the standard deviation of residence grades. Thus in 
both tests of averages, extension grades are somewhat higher 
than residence grades. (3) The standard deviation of extension 
grades is greater than that of residence grades by 1.27 units, or 
is 1.55 times the standard deviation of residence grades. (4) 
The coefficients of correlation and contingency between residence 
and extension grades are high. (5) The first regression equation 
shows that for a student, whose extension grades vary a unit from 
the mean of the universe of extension grades, it is to be predicted 
that his residence grades will vary from the mean of the universe 
of residence grades by .30 of a unit and in the same direction. 
The second regression equation shows that for a student, whose 
residence grades vary a unit from the mean of the universe of 
residence grades, it is to be predicted that his extension grades 
will vary from the mean of the universe of extension grades by .72 
of a unit and in the same direction. 
c. Conclusions 
The following conclusions are reached as to residence and 
extension grades at Kirksville: (1) Extension grades are some- 
what higher than residence grades. (2) Variability among ex- 
tension grades is considerably greater than that among residence
-P-A-G-E-146
  146 Tue Revavion or ExTRA-MURAL Stupy To 
grades. (3) Residence grades are a much better index of extension 
grades than extension grades are of residence grades. 
At Kirksville both correspondence and extension grades are 
higher than residence grades, and correspondence grades are 
higher than extension grades. The mean of correspondence 
grades is .7 of a unit larger than the mean of extension grades, 
and the median of correspondence grades is 1.7 units larger than 
the median of extension grades. 
The standard deviation of both correspondence and extension 
grades is much larger than that of residence grades. Nor can 
this difference be explained on the ground of fewer studies making 
up the rank of students in extra-mural subjects, since it appears 
later that the standard deviation of grades of 253 entering fresh- 
men who were in school from 1 to 3 quarters, was 2.55. The 
variability in correspondence grades is also considerably greater 
than that in extension grades since the standard deviation of the 
former is .47 greater than that of the latter. Furthermore, from 
both the coefficient of correlation and from the regression equa- 
tions there is found a closer relationship between extension and 
residence grades than between correspondence and _ residence 
grades. It is clear that extension grades are a better index of 
residence grades than correspondence grades are. 
This conclusion bears out in a remarkable way a result com- 
mented upon in Part One in connection with type of study and 
order of enrolment. It was found that, in reference to first, sec- 
ond, and third enrolments, we pass from residence, through ex- 
tension, to correspondence study. This result indicates that 
type of study represents contact with teacher, and that corre- 
spondence, extension, and residence represent three successive 
stages of this contact. The fact that extension grades are so 
much more closely related to residence grades than are corre- 
spondence grades bears out this observation. These conclusions 
are drawn from homogeneous samples of students where each stu- 
dent had residence study in addition to correspondence or exten- 
sion study. 
3. Residence, correspondence, and extension grades— 
whole universe of each 
a. Relations 
Each student of 1919-1920 is now counted in each type of 
study in which he earned credit at Kirksville. A student may be 
counted 2 or even 3 times, but his grades in different types of 
work are kept separate. There were 1275 students who had 
residence study; 359, had correspondence study; and 270, had 
extension study. The following tabulation gives the frequency 
distribution of grades of all students in the three types of study:

For residence grades the mean is 12.7, the median, 12.5; 
and the standard deviation, 2.76. For correspondence grades 
the mean is 14.4; the median, 15.3; and the standard deviation, 
4.05. For extension grades the mean is 13.4; the median, 13.4; 
and the standard deviation, 3.48. 
b. Comparisons 
When all grades in different types of study at Kirksville are 
considered, we have in terms of symbols introduced: 
(1) Ar<Ae<Ac 
(2) Mr<Me<Me 
(3) or<ac<aec 
Also when the whole universe of each type of study is considered, 
residence grades are lowest, extension grades, next, and corre- 
spondence grades, highest. Likewise residence grades are least 
variable, extension grades, next, and correspondence grades, 
most variable of all. : 
When comparisons are made with Tables I and II, it is found 
that both the mean and median of residence grades of all students 
are respectively less than the means and medians of residence 
grades of students who had both residence and correspondence 
study or residence and extension study. The residence grades of 
all students are also somewhat more variable than the residence 
grades of those who have had residence study and some other type 
of study also. These differences may be due to the fact that 
many of the 815 students are just beginning college study, and 
eliminations have not yet taken place on account of their inability 
to pursue college studies. 
In Table III there were only 19 students having correspond- 
ence study without residence study, and only 43, having extension 
study without residence study; hence, not much change could be 
expected in central tendencies and measures of dispersion. How- 
ever, the mean of correspondence grades of all students is slightly 
less than it is for correspondence students having had residence 
study also; but the median remains the same, and the standard 
deviation is increased a trifle. The mean and median of extension 
grades of all students are perceptibly lower than these same 
measures are for the extension grades of students who have had 
residence study also. The standard deviation also is less than 
in Table II. 
c. Conclusions 
It therefore appears that students of a group which has had 
more than one type and also the same types of study, make some- 
what higher grades in any one of the given types pursued than 
does the whole universe of students in any one of these types.

mural study only are now considered. Since the number of stu- 
dents in the year 1919-1920 who had either correspondence or ex- 
tension study without residence study, is small, correspondence 
and extension students are treated as extra-mural students. 
The following tabulation gives the frequency distribution of grades 
for those who have had residence study only, and for those who 
have had extra-mural study only.

For residénce grades the mean is 12.2 and the median, 12.3; for 
extra-mural grades the mean is 12.9 and the median, 12.5. The 57 
standard deviation of residence grades is 2.82; that of extra- - 
mural grades is 4.52. 
b. Comparisons and conclusions 
The number of students in extra-mural study only, is smaller 
than is desirable for statistical work. However, both the mean and 
median of grades made by students with extra-mural study only, 
are larger than the mean and median of grades made by students 
who have had residence study only. Also the standard deviation 
of grades made by students with extra-mural study only, is larger 
than that of grades made by students with residence study only. 
By comparisons with Tables I, II, and III it is found that 
students who have had residence study without any extra-mural 
study make lower residence grades and grades of a wider range of 
. variability than: (1) the residence grades of all students who have 
had residence study; (2) the residence grades of students who 
have had some form of extra-mural study also. The comparisons 
form an ascending series, and hold in the order made. 
When grades are judged by the median, it is found that the 
extra-mural grades of students, who have had no residence study, 
are lower and of a wider range of variability than: (1) the extra- 
mural grades of all students who have had extra-mural study; (2) 
the extra-mural grades (extension or correspondence) of students 
who have had residence study also. But, when grades are judged 
by the mean, it is found that the extra-mural grades of students

who have had no residence study, are higher than the extension 
grades of all other groups considered, but less than the correspond- 
ence grades of all other groups considered. These results are prob- 
ably due to the combining of extension and correspondence grades 
into a single extra-mural grade, and also to the small sample 
available. 
5. Residence grades of extra-mural students and grades 
of students with residence study only 
a. The problem stated 
An interesting question arises as to whether students who 
have had both residence and extra-mural study will make higher 
residence grades than do students of equal advancement who have 
had residence study only; in other words, is there some quality 
or attribute that goes with being a residence-extra-mural student 
that is conducive to higher grades? 
To answer this question the residence grades of 380 college 
graduates from 1918 to 1923 were studied. Central tendencies 
and measures of dispersion were found; also Pearson’s new method 
of correlation that is adapted to a variable and an attribute was 
used to find the correlation between being a student with both 
residence and extra-mural study and grades in residence. 
b. Relations 
The table which involves the facts relative to these four- 
year graduates follows:

  For students with residence study only, the mean of residence 
grades is 13.54; the median, 13.33; and the standard deviation, 
2.18. For students who have had both residence and extra- 
mural study, the mean of residence grades is 13.83; the median,
-P-A-G-E-151
RestpENcE ENROLMENT AND Scuouastic Stanpina ~~ 151 
13.76; and the standard deviation, 2.16. The correlation in this 
table was determined as an illustrative exercise involving Pear- 
son’s new method in Chapter I, Part One. The correlation be- 
tween being a student with both residence and extra-mural study, 
and high residence grades is r= .086. 
e. Comparisons 
It is seen that the mean and median of grades of students 
who have had both residence and extra-mural study, are respect- 
ively .29 and .43 of a unit higher than the mean and median for 
students with residence study only. Measured in terms of the 
standard deviation of the whole distributions these differences are 
respectively .14 and .20-of the standard deviation. The standard 
deviation in row (1) is .02 greater than in row (2). The coeffi- 
cient of correlation is r= .086. 
d. Conclusions 
These measures indicate that graduates of the Teachers Col- 
lege at Kirksville who have had both residence and extra-mural 
study make somewhat higher residence grades and grades of 
slightly less variability, than do graduates having residence study 
only. There also appears to be a small but sensible correlation 
between being a student with both residence and extra-mural 
study, and high residence grades. 
IV. CompaRIsoN OF GRADES AT Macoms, ILLINors 
1. General statement 
Due to the amount of labor in getting data relativesto grades 
it was not possible to study in detail the grades and grading system 
of any school other than the Teachers College at Kirksville. 
However, it was possible to secure the extension grades, at Ma- 
comb, Illinois, of 159 students who had had no residence study, 
both the extension and residence grades of 76 persons who had 
had both types of study, and the residence grades of 324 students 
who had had residence study only. The grades at Macomb are 
evaluated on the same basis as are those at Kirksville. It was 
not feasible to secure data concerning age and advancement of 
students, or to apply any of the tests as to mental ability and 
health as was done at Kirksville; moreover, it must be borne in 
mind that extra-mural study at Macomb means extension study. 
All comparisons show that residence and extension study are 
more closely related than are residence and correspondence study. 
The courses in extension at Macomb are taught in the main by a 
few persons who devote full time to the work, whereas in Mis- 
souri the courses are generally offered by regular faculty members 
who devote their major energies to residence instruction. 
2. Residence and extension grades 
a. Relations involved 
The relations between grades in different types of study at 
Macomb are shown by a conveniently arranged tabulation. In 
the sample secured the number of students who had pursued 
both types of study was too small to justify a correlation table

Let A stand for arithmetic mean; M, for median; and c, for

In all cases the odd numbered subscripts refer to residence 
grades, and the even numbered to extension grades. The col- 
umns under (a), (b), and (c) are comparable. 
b. Comparisons and conclusions 
Both under (a) and (b) whether the comparison is made by 
the mean or median the extension grades are considerably higher 
than residence grades, but variability among residence grades is 
slightly greater than among extension grades. However, under 
(ec) where the residence and extension grades of 76 persons who 
have had both types of study are compared, the residence grades 
when measured by mean or median, are slightly higher than ex- 
tension grades, and the variability of residence grades is slightly 
greater than that for extension grades. However, this sample 
is inadequate. But when the residence and extension grades 
of those who have had but one type of study, are compared, ex- 
tension grades are much higher than are residence grades; also 
when all residence grades are compared with all extension grades, 
the extension grades are much higher than are residence grades. 
Nevertheless, variability is slightly greater in every case for resi- 
dence grades than it is for extension grades. This result is prob- 
ably due to the fact that extension grades are made out by just a 
few persons at Macomb. 
The weight of evidence points to higher grades for extension 
study than for residence study at Macomb also. The lesser vari- 
ability for extension grades can be explained, and shows that 
greater variability is not indigenous to extra-mural study as 
one might be led to believe. At Macomb as at Kirksville, higher 
grades appear to go with extension study. 
V. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 
1. Summary of facts relative to grades at Kirksville 
Certain facts brought out in this chapter can be set forth 
concisely by a tabulation in terms of the symbols introduced under 
IIIa, where A represents arithmetic mean; M, median; o, stand- 
ard deviation; and subscripts r, c, and e represent respectively 
residence, correspondence, and extension study.

  2. Conclusions 
a. From data at Kirksville 
The tabulation above and preceeding tables warrant the fo: 
lowing conclusions: 
(1) Students who have had both residence and extension 
study, or residence and correspondence study make higher grades 
in residence than do students with residence study only, higher 
grades in extension than do students with extension study only, 
and higher grades in correspondence than do students with cor- 
respondence study only. 
(2) When grades in the three types of study are compared, 
they are in every instance lowest in residence study, medium in 
extension study, and highest in correspondence study. 
(3) Variability is least among residence grades, medium 
among extension grades, and greatest among correspondence 
grades. 
(4) Residence grades are better criteria of either correspond- 
ence or extension grades, than correspondence or extension grades 
are of residence grades; and extension grades are better criteria 
of residence grades than are correspondence grades.    
-P-A-G-E-155
RESIDENCE ENROLMENT AND ScHOLASTIC STANDING 155 
(5) Extension and residence study appear to be more closely 
related than do correspondence and residence study. 
(6) Students who have had both residence and extra-mural 
study make slightly higher residence grades and grades of some- 
what less variability than do students, of equal advancement, with 
residence study only. There is a small but significant positive cor- 
relation between being a student with both residence and extra- 
mural study, and residence grades. 
b. From data at Macomb 
(1) Extension grades are in general higher than residence 
grades; the only exception is in a small sample of 76 students 
with both types of study. 
(2) Variation is less among extension grades than it is 
among residence grades. 
ec. Observations and comparisons 
It is significant that students having more than one type of 
study make higher grades in each type of study than do students 
having a single one of the given types of study. This fact means 
that students having two or more types of study make higher 
grades in general than do students having a single type of study. 
But this statement is just as true of students who have had both 
correspondence and extension study as it is of students who have 
had both residence and correspondence study, or both residence 
and extension study. It does not at all argue that there is any 
special merit in one type of study that is not found in the other 
types of study. In Chapters II and V which follow certain fac- 
tors are considered which help to account for these differences in 
grades. 
Nevertheless, the administrator is still confronted with the 
fact that for all groups of students considered and even for the 
same group, correspondence grades are highest, extension, next, 
and residence, lowest. The further fact that variation is greatest 
for correspondence grades, next for extension grades, and lowest 
for residence grades is a strong indication that correspondence and 
extension grades are less efficiently administered at Kirksville 
than are residence grades. However, at Macomb where exten- 
sion work is carried on by full time instructors, variability is less 
for extension than for residence grades. A full time extension 
faculty is probably a step in the right direction for better ad- 
ministration of extra-mural grades. 
Moreover, the fact that, when both rank of grades, and in- 
fluence of type of study on residence enrolment are considered, 
extension grades are so much more closely related to residence 
grades than are correspondence grades, probably indicates that 
extension study is superior to correspondence study. The edu- 
cational implication involved is in harmony with that pointed 
out at the close of Chapter VII, Part One. ;

  CHAPTER IT 
RELATION OF GRADES TO AGE AND ADVANCEMENT 
In this chapter the following questions are considered: 
(1) Are age and advancement correlated with grades? 
(2) For what types of study is the correlation greatest? 
(3) For what groups of students is the correlation greatest? 
(4) For what groups of students are age and advancement 
greatest? 
I. InrRopUcTORY STATEMENT 
The purpose of this chapter is to find whether age and ad- 
vancement affect grades in different types of study, and to de- 
termine the extent of relationship between age and grades, and 
advancement and grades. Results will be noted that help to ex- 
plain why grades in certain types of study and among certain 
groups of students are higher than grades in other types of study 
and among other groups of students. 
Advancement means the number of semester hours complet- 
ed. Since each study at Kirksville has a credit of 2.5 semester 
hours, advancement represents also the number of studies com- 
pleted. 
II. ApbVANCEMENT AND GRADES 
1. Students with both residence and correspondence study 
a. Advancement and residence grades 
Let us take the 340 students, of the year 1919-1920, who had 
both residence and correspondence study, and arrange a correla- 
tion table for advancement (number of studies all told) and resi- 
dence grades. The relations involved are shown in Table VIII. 
The mean of the number of studies is 26.3, where each study 
equals 2.5 semester hours; the standard deviation is 11.6 studies. 
All questions relative to grades in this table were answered under 
Table I of the preceding chapter. The coefficient of correlation 
is r=.316+.034. The correlation ratio of advancement on 
grades is nag=.39-+.032. The regression is practically linear since 
the test of linearity is short by only .5 of a unit. Hence there is a 
well marked correlation between advancement and age in this 
group which is slightly understated by r=.316. 
Advancement and correspondence grades 
Let us take the correspondence grades, used in Table VIII, of 
the same 340 students and arrange a correlation table for advance- 
ment and correspondence grades. This arrangement gives Table 
IX. 
The number of studies in this table, and the measures in- 
volved, are the same as in the preceding table. The coefficient of 
correlation is r=.212-+.033. There is again a correlation between 
advancement and grades but it is not so high as when residence 
grades are used.

2. Students with both residence and extension study 
a. Advancement and extension grades 
We now take the extension grades of the 227 students of the 
year 1919-1920 who had both residence and extension study. 
When the tabulation is made it gives Table X. 
The mean of the number of studies is 25.1, and the standard 
deviation is 11.2 studies. The coefficient of correlation is r= 
.267+.041. Here also there is considerable correlation between 
advancement and extension grades. There is no need to consider 
advancement, and residence grades here since this question was 
considered under Table VII, where a larger number of students 
was involved, and it is known that the residence grades and num- 
ber of studies in the two groups run about the same. 
3. Students with residence study only 
a. Advancement and residence grades 
Finally, we take the residence grades of the 815 students of 
the year 1919-1920 who had no extra-mural study. This tabula- 
tion gives Table XI. 
The mean of advancement is 20.6, and the standard deviation 
is 14.1. The coefficient of correlation is r=.283-++.02. All facts 
relative to grades in this group appear under Table IV of the pre- 
ceding chapter. 
4, Summary 
(1) In each type of study there is a significant correlation 
between advancement and _ grades. 
(2) The correlation is greatest in the two tables which deal 
with residence study, next greatest in extension study, and least 
in correspondence study. These results support the conclusion 
that residence and extension study are more closely related than 
are residence and correspondence study when grades and advance- 
ment are considered. 
(3) The correlation between advancement and grades in the 
two groups of residence students is a little greater in the group 
which has had correspondence study also. 
(4) Advancement is greatest among students who have 
had both residence and correspondence study, one study less 
for those who have had both residence and extension study, and 
nearly six studies less for those who have had residence study only. 
III. Agr and GRADES 
1. Students with both residence and correspondence study 
a. Age and residence grades

both residence and correspondence study, and arrange a correla- 
tion table for age and residence grades. Table XII is obtained.

The mean ot age is 27.3 years, the median is 24.4, and the stand- 
ard deviation is 8.2 years. The correlation is r=.327-++.04. This 
coefficient shows a high degree of correlation between residence 
grades and age in the universe of students who have had both 
residence and extension study. 
b. Age and extension grades 
Let us now take the extension grades of the same 227 students, 
and form a correlation table between age and extension grades.

is r=.098+-.042. This result shows clearly that for the less ma- 
ture, who have had residence study only, the correlation between 
age and residence grades steadily declines.   5. Summary 
a. General observations 
It is also worthy of note that age and advancement are cor- 
related. In the tabulation involving 340 students who had both 
residence and correspondence study, the correlation between 
age and advancement is r=.166   
037, and the correlation ratio 
of age on advancement is 7=.321=+.033.
-P-A-G-E-170
    170 Tue RELATION OF EXTRA-MURAL STUDY TO 
When it is said that grades and age are correlated, the dis- 
tribution is taken as a whole. When a certain point of the age 
seale is reached the correlation of age with grades is doubtless 
negative, but this condition applies only to a minor portion of 
the scale and is overbalanced by that portion of the scale where 
the correlation is positive. 
To test out the truth of this assumption, the students above 
30 years of age in the group of 340‘students who had both resi- 
dence and correspondence study, were divided into two groups. 
The first contains 59 students from 30 to 40 years of age; the sec- 
ond, 20 students from 40 years old and above. By Pearson’s 
new method of correlation it was found that “age above 40” when 
compared with “age from 30 to 40”, is negatively correlated 
with grades, and that the coefficient of correlation is r=—.167. 
The form of the age grade distributions indicates that this condi- 
tion is common to all the tables. 
The arithmetic mean of the number of residence studies for 
students having both residence and correspondence study is 
26.3; for those having both residence and extension study, 25.1; 
and for those having residence study only, 20.6 in one group and 
22.7 in another group considered in Chapter III. 
b. A summarizing tabulation

ferent groups of students:

ce. Conclusions 
(1) From this table, for students who have had residence 
study only, it appears that the correlation between age and resi- 
dence grades steadily increases as age increases. This statement 
also holds in the main for those who have had residence study 
with some other type of study since there is only .2 of a year’s 
difference between ages in the last two rows, and the correlation 
for each group is considerably greater than it is for the first group 
under (b). 
(2) The correlation between age and residence grades in the 
main is highest in the group that has had residence study and 
some form of extra-mural study. 
(3) Grades in each type of study are significantly correlated 
with age. 
(4) In all cases, if freshmen are excluded, the correlation be- 
tween age and grades is greatest for residence grades, next largest 
for extension grades, and least, by a small margin, for correspond- 
ence grades. However, the correlation ratio of age on grades 
is very large for correspondence grades. The close relationship 
between residence and extension study is again evidenced. 
(5) When age is measured both in terms of mean and me- 
dian, students having both residence and extension study are old- 
est, next are those having residence and extra-mural study, next, 
those having residence and correspondence study, whereas those 
having residence study only are youngest. 
(6) No doubt the correlation of grades with advancement 
and with age partially accounts for the fact that 815 students, who 
had no extra-mural study, made lower grades in residence than 
were made. in residence study by those who had extra-mural 
study also. But in connection with the residence grades of the 
380 students who are graduates of the Teachers College at Kirks- 
ville the question of advancement was eliminated, for they all 
had completed a minimum of 120 semester hours of credit. What 
causes the group which had both residence and extra-mural study 
to make the highest grades? Is it age, health, or mental ability? 
IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS FOR THE CHAPTER 
(1) Advancement and age are both significantly correlated 
with grades at the Teachers College at Kirksville. 
(2) For both age and advancement this correlation is great- 
est for residence grades, medium for extension grades, and lowest 
for correspondence grades. 
(3) For both age and advancement the correlation with 
residence grades in general is greatest when the students have 
had some form of extra-mural study also. 
(4) Students having residence study and some form of 
extra-mural study are older and more advanced than are students 
having residence study only.
-P-A-G-E-172
  172 Tue RELATION OF EXTRA-MURAL STUDY TO 
Residence grades are greatest when students have had some 
form of extra-mural study also; and extra-mural grades are great- 
est when students have had residence study also. The correla- 
tion of both age and advancement with residence grades is great- 
est when students have had some form of extra-mural study also. 
Students who have had both residence and extra-mural study are 
older and more advanced than those who have had residence study 
only. Therefore, it would appear that age and advancement 
are factors not only in determining higher grades in general but 
also in accounting for the making of higher residence grades by stu- 
dents with both residence and extra-mural study than are made 
by students having residence study only. Unfortunately, the 
records at Kirksville do not give the age of extra-mural students 
who have not come into residence; also the mean of the number 
of extra-mural studies of extra-mural students who have not, 
come into residence is only 2.1. Hence it is impossible to find 
in this group of students the correlation between extra-mural 
grades and age, and between extra-mural grades and advance- 
ment. <A study that would determine these relations would be 
valuable. However, the probability is that relations would be 
found similar to those just pointed out in connection with resi- 
dence grades. Certain factors that affect grades will receive con- 
sideration in Chapter V.

In this chapter the following questions are considered: 
(1) Are health and number of residence studies correlated? 
(2) Are health and number of extra-mural studies correlated? 
(3) Are health and grades correlated? 
(4) What type of students are most sensitive to health 
influence? 
(5) Do students in poor health show a tendency to earn 
credit through extra-mural study? 
I. Inrropucrory sTaTEMENT 
The State Teachers College at Kirksville has a strong and 
well equipped Department of Public Health which has kept for 
students accurate health and physical records as made in the 
physical examinations given each term for the past six years. 
Two lists of names selected as random samples were sub- 
mitted to the Chairman of the Department of Public Health. The 
first consisted of 280 persons who had both residence and extra- 
mural study at Kirksville; the second, of 253 persons who had resi- 
dence study only. Those who had extra-mural study only, did 
not take the physical examinations at Kirksville. The Chair- 
man of the Department of Public Health, who knew nearly every 
student personally, examined the physical record cards kept of 
these students, and scored them as “good” or “poor”. The 
class records of each of these students for the whole time in school 
were then looked up. The arithmetic mean of all residence grades 
gave the student’s standing in residence study, and the arithmetic 
mean of all extra-mural grades gave the student’s standing in 
extra-mural study. 
Each list of names was further divided into two groups ac- 
cording to the health report, and arranged into various tabula- 
tions for purposes of study and comparisons. 
II. Haro AND NUMBER OF RESIDENCE STUDIES 
1. Students with residence study only 
a. Relations involved 
We first consider health and number of studies of the 253 
students who had residence study only. The relations involved 
are shown in Table X XI. 
By Pearson’s method, which applies to an attribute and a 
variable, and by use of Everitt’s Tables, the coefficient of correla- 
tion between health and number of studies can be found. The 
mean of the whole distribution is 22.732; mean for those in poor 
health, 21.216; standard deviation of total distribution, 13.106.

b. Interpretations 
This coefficient shows that the correlation between poor 
health and number of residence studies is negative. Then the 
correlation between good health (health) and number of residence 
studies is positive and just as strong numerically as that between 
poor health and number of residence studies. It may be repre- 
sented by r=.112. In the universe of students with residence 
study only as health increases, the number of residence studies in- 
creases; as health declines, the number of studies declines. 3759 
  2. Students with both residence and extra-mural study 
a. Relations involved 
We consider health and number of residence studies of the 
280 students who had both residence and extra-mural study. The 
relations involved are shown in Table XXII. 
Mean of whole distribution is 24.528; mean for those in poor 
health, 24.00; standard deviation for whole distribution, 10.508. 
Therefore p /on=—.0502 
3(1—a)=.3857, 3(1+a)=.6143, 2 =.3824 Therefore G /or=.9914 
Therefore rpn=—.051 
b. Interpretations 
The correlation between poor health and number of residence 
studies is negative; therefore, the correlation between good health 
and number of residence studies is positive. It may be represent- 
ed by r=.051. Thus the coefficients of correlation show that 
health and advancement in residence studies are significantly and 
positively correlated. But the correlation is somewhat stronger 
in the group which has had residence study only. However, this 
circumstance does not in itself show that those with residence 
study only have the better health. It means only that good 
health and high grades, and poor health and poor grades are more 
often found together in the group of students who have had resi- 
dence study only, than in the group of students who have had both 
types of study. 
II. Hearrn AND NUMBER OF EXTRA-MURAL STUDIES 
1. Relations involved 
We take here the 280 students who had both residence and 
extra-mural study, and consider health and number of extra-mural 
studies. The relations involved are shown in Table XXIII.

Therefore G/a 
Therefore rpn=.0$ 
2. Interpretations 
A sensible positive correlation is found between poor health and 
number of extra-mural studies completed. Then good health 
(health) and number of extra-mural studies are negatively cor- 
related, and r=—.09; in other words, as the health of students 
declines the number of subjects pursued in extra-mural courses 
increases. This fact is significant; and from the results in sections 
II and III it is seen that students in poor health complete fewer. 
studies in residence, but more in extra-mural work than do stu- 
dents in good health. 
IV. Hearn AND RESIDENCE GRADES 
1. Students with residence study only 
a. Relations involved 
We consider health and grades of the 253 students who had 
residence study only. “Z= B824

b. Interpretations 
Thus poor health and residence grades have strong negative 
correlation. This coefficient which shows that good health 
(health) and residence grades have strong positive correlation, is 
represented by r=.238. In the universe of students with res 
dence study only, as health increases grades increase significantly. 
2. Students with both residence and extra-mural study 
a. Relations involved 
Next we consider health and residence grades of students 
who have had both residence and extra-mural study. :

Therefore G/ov = .9914 
Therefore rpn=—.103 
b. Interpretations 
For those who have had both residence and extra-mural 
study, poor health and residence grades are negatively correlated, 
or good health (health) and residence grades are positively corre- 
lated, which correlation is represented by r=.103. It is worthy of 
note that the correlation between health and grades among stu- 
dents with residence study only is about two times as high as that 
among those who have had both types of study. Nearly this 
same ratio is found between the two groups of students when cor- 
relations between health and advancement are compared. Here
-P-A-G-E-178
  178 Tur RELATION oF EXTRA-MURAL Stupy TO 
also, in conformity with earlier results, the mean residence grade 
of students with both types of study is higher than it is for the 
group with residence study only. A similar statement holds also 
for the number of residence studies completed. 
In all instances good health and high residence grades go 
together, also good health and number of residence studies com- 
pleted go together, but in both instances the group with residence 
study only is the more sensitive to health influence. 
V. Haru AND EXTRA-MURAL GRADES 
Students with both residence and extra-mural study are con- 
sidered. 
1. Relations involved 
We now consider health and extra-mural grades of the 280 
students who had both residence and extra-mural study.

Mean of whole distribution is 13.493; mean for students in poor 
health, 13.02; standard deviation of whole distribution, 3.993. 
Therefore p /on =—.1184 
$(1—a) = .3857, 3(14+-a) =.6143, “= 3824 
Therefore 9 /ov=.9914 
Therefore rpn=—.119 
2. Interpretations 
It follows that poor health and extra-mural grades are nega- 
tively correlated; therefore, good health (health) and extra-mural 
grades are positively correlated, which correlation is represented 
byr=.119. Thus in both residence and extra-mural study health 
and grades are quite significantly correlated.   
  r 
     
VI. Heaure AND TYPE OF STUDY 
1. Relations involved 
Last we consider health and type of study. It is to be re- 
gretted that it is impossible to have the health records of extra- 
mural students who have never enrolled for residence study. 
However, health records are available for two groups of students, 
one consisting of 280 students who had both residence and extra-
-P-A-G-E-179
. 
Res!1pENCcE ENROLMENT AND ScHOLASTIC STANDING 179 
mural study, the other consisting of 250 students who had resi- 
dence study only. It is possible to divide each of these two 
groups into two other groups according to health records and to 
form association or fourfold correlation tables.

The coefficient of association is 
(90) (172)—(160) (108) _ 055 
Q= (0) (i72)-+ (460) (108)? 
2. Interpretations 
To check this result, Yule’s formula for correlation of a four- 
fold table is used.!| The formula in terms of elements of Table 
XXVII is   
Nd 
(A) (a) (B) 
By this formula, r=—.027. The values of both Q and r indicate 
a slight negative association or correlation between good health 
and having both residence: and extra-mural study. These coeffi- 
cients show that there is a slight positive association between 
good health and residence study only. The result can hardly 
be considered as very significant, but it probably indicates an 
actual tendency on the part of those in poor health to get into the 
residence-extra-mural group of students. 
VII. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 
(1) Health and number of residence studies are positively 
correlated; therefore, students in good health attend school longer 
and complete more studies in residence than do those in poor 
health. 
(2) Health and number of extra-mural studies are nega- 
tively correlated; therefore, students in poor health complete more 
hours of credit in extra-mural study than do those in good health. 
(3) Health and grades are significantly correlated in every 
type of study. It is interesting to note that health affects achieve- 
ment of students in the college just as certainly as it does in the   7m by’ where Nd=(AB) (ab)—(Ab) (aB).

elementary schools. These results fully support conclusions 
reached by Dr. Jasper N. Mallory in his dissertation on THE 
Revation or Some Puystcat Drrsecrs To ACHIEVEMENT IN THE 
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. 
(4) Students with residence study only are more sensitive 
to health influence in respect to both advancement and grades 
than are students with both residence and extra-mural study. 
(5) There is a slight tendeney on the part of students in 
poor health to earn credit through extra-mural study. 
The educational implications of this chapter are very im- 
portant to school administrators. As health improves, students 
complete more studies in residence; as it declines, they complete 
fewer studies in residence. This fact indicates that teachers col- 
leges should establish departments of health and utilize them for 
correcting defects and minor ailments, and for improving the 
health of students at large. 
However, students in poor health not only complete fewer 
studies in residence, but actually turn to extra-mural work, and 
complete more extra-mural studies than do students in good 
health. It turns out that extra-mural instruction is provided 
for persons who are less physically fit than are residence students. 
It is therefore appropriate to ask what effect extra-mural instruc- 
tion has in keeping teachers in service who are not up to the stand- 
ard of health needed for efficient teaching. 
It also appears that students in good health make higher 
grades both in residence and in extra-mural studies than do stu- 
dents in poor health. This fact is an additional reason why the 
school should safeguard the health of its students.

CHAPTER IV 
RELATION BETWEEN’ Mrntau Apiuity, AcE, ADVANCEMENT, 
GRADES, AND TypE oF Stupy 
In this chapter the following questions are considered: 
(1) Are mental ability and age of college students correlated? 
(2) Are mental ability and advancement correlated? 
(3) Are mental ability and residence grades correlated? 
(4) Are mental ability and type of study correlated? 
I. Inrropuctory staTEMENT 
During the year 1922-1923, Otis S-A Tests of Mental Abil- 
ity, Higher Examination, Form A, were given to 207 persons 
who were in school and had pursued some form of extra-mural 
study at Kirksville. At about the same time they were given 
also to a random sample of 145 persons who had not pursued extra- 
mural study. The group with residence study only, had a much 
higher per cent of freshmen than had the other group; however, 
there is not much difference in the relative numbers of students 
in the remaining years of college work. The freshmen in both 
groups were not entering freshmen; all of them had been in school 
six months or more. These tests were given also to 253 en- 
tering freshmen at the beginning of the fall quarter,1922-1923. 
The tests were given by trained instructors under almost identical 
conditions. The highest score possible with the Otis Tests is 75. 
II. Merntan ABILITY AND AGE 
1. Students with both residence and extra-mural study 
We consider mental ability and age of 207 students who had 
both residence and extra-mural study. Each year of the college 
was represented in this group. Table XXVIII contains the tab- 
ulated data. 
The mean score is 52.60, and the median score is 51.48; the 
mean age, 27.10; the standard deviation of score, 9.45; the standard 
deviation of age, 7.42; and the range of score is from 30 to 74, 
and the range of age, from 18 to 52. The coefficient of correlation 
by the product moment method is r=—.096-+.047. The cor- 
relation between score and age is slightly negative, and probably 
not very significant. 
2. Students with residence study only 
a. A sample from a four-year college 
We consider mental ability and age of 145 students who 
had residence study only, at Kirksville. Each year of the college 
was represented in this sample. Table XXIX contains the tab- 
ulated data. 
The mean score is 52.20, and the median score is 52.42; the 
mean age, 23.90; the standard deviation of score, 9.56; the standard 
deviation of age, 4.74; and the range of score is from 32 to 74, and

the range of age, from 18 to 44. The coefficient of correlation 
is, by the product moment method, r=.034=-.055. This correla- 
tion is slightly positive, but is so small that it indicates practical 
independence between mental score and age. 
b. Entering freshmen 
We next consider mental ability and age of 253 entering fresh- 
men, Table XXX contains the tabulated data. 
The mean score is 43.76, and the median score is 43.71; the 
mean age, 19.32; the standard deviation of score, 9.80; the standard 
deviation of age, 2.19; the range in score, 18 to 65; in age, 16 to 
28. The correlation coefficient by the product moment method , 
is r=—.049+-.042. Again itis observed in a group where no elimi- 
nation has taken place, that age and mental ability measured by 
the Otis Tests are practically independent, 
3. Conclusions 
(1) Age and mental ability are practically independent in 
each group. In the youngest group there was a slight negative 
correlation; in the medium age group, a very slight positive corre- 
lation; and in the oldest group, a somewhat stronger negative ) 
correlation. These results show that the age factor is practically | 
eliminated in Otis Higher Examination, Form A. The outcome 
is as it should be if the tests are to measure mental ability. 
(2) The mental score in each of the two samples taken from 
the college as a whole is practically the same. The mean score 
for entering freshmen is 8.85 points less than it is for those students 
with both residence and extra-mural study. 
(3) The standard deviation of score is practically the same 
in all groups. 
Ill. Menrat ABILITY AND ADVANCEMENT 
1. Students with both residence and extra-mural study 
We next consider mental ability and advancement of those | 
who have had both residence and extra-mural study. Advance- | 
ment as used in this chapter refers to college classification or the | 
number of years of college work completed. Table XX XI con- | 
tains the tabulated data. By the product moment method 
r=.162-+.046.

3. Conclusions 
For both types of students there is a small but doubtless sig- 
nificant correlation between mental score and advancement. The 
more advanced students, for some reason, make higher mental 
scores than do the less advanced. 
IV. Menrat ABILITY AND RESIDENCE GRADES 
1. Students with both residence and extra-mural study 
We first consider mental ability and residence grades of stu- 
dents who have had both residence and extra-mural study. Table 
XXXIII contains the tabulated data. 
The central tendencies and standard deviations have been 
given in other tables. The coefficient of correlation between 
mental ability and residence grades is r= .303+-.043. 
2. Students with residence study only 
a. A sample from a four-year college ° 
We consider mental ability and grades of the 145 students 
who had residence study only. Table XXXIV contains the tab- 
ulated data. 
The coefficient of correlation between mental score and resi- 
dence grades is r= .449-- .043, 
b. Entering freshmen 
Finally, we consider mental ability and residence grades of 
253 entering freshmen. The grades were taken after these fresh- 
men had been in school nine months. Table XX XV contains the 
tabulated data. 
The coefficient of correlation between mental score and resi- 
dence grades is r= .530-+.030. 
3. -Conclusions 
(1) There is strong positive correlation between mental 
score and residence grades. 
(2) The correlation between mental score and residence 
grades increases decidedly as we pass from the most mature group 
with both residence and extra-mural study, to the group next in 
maturity with residence study only, and tothe least mature rep- 
resented by entering freshmen. The mean of age and the co- 
efficients of correlation of these groups in the order mentioned 
above are: 27.10, 23.90, 19.32; and .303, 449, .530. 
V. MENTAL ABILITY AND TYPE OF STUDY 
1. Relations involved 
We now make direct comparison of the two groups from the 
college, one of which had both residence and extra-mural study 
and the other, residence study only. It was found under section 
II: 3, that the central tendencies of the two groups were prac- 
tically the same. Those who had both residence and extra-mural 
study had a higher mean score than did those who had residence 
study only, whereas those who had residence study only had the 
higher median score. Table XXXVI contains the tabulated data.

Therefore rm=—.029 
2. Comparisons 
The correlation between mental score and being a student 
with both residence and extra-mural study is r=.029. This co- 
efficient indicates that mental score and type of study, as repre- 
sented by those having residence study only, and by those having 
both residence and extra-mural study, are practically independent. 
As noted earlier, the mean of score for those with both resi- 
dence and extra-mural study is 52.60. It is seen that the mean 
score of the group that had residence study only is .4 of a unit 
less than that of the group that had both types of study. On 
the other hand, the median of this group is .94 of a unit larger 
than the median of the group that had both residence and extra- 
mural study. The medians of freshman, sophomore, junior, and 
senior students who come from the group with residence study 
only, are respectively: 51.00, 52.25, 53.00, and 56.25, whereas 
the median of the total distribution is 52.42. The medians of 
the other group by years are in the order named above: 49.90, 
50.75, 52.30, and 56.00, whereas the median of the total distribu- 
tion is 51.48. Thus, in every year, and in total distributions the 
medians of the group that had residence study only, are the larger. 
It therefore appears, though the mean of scores made by those 
with residence study only is a trifle smaller than the mean of 
scores made by the other group, that, when the scores are consid- 
ered in the light of all central tendencies, the advantage in score 
is not against those who had residence study only. This fact is 
true in spite of a considerable correlation between advancement 
and score, and in spite of too large a proportion of freshmen in the 
group with residence study only. But because the mean of the 
residence group is a little smaller than that of the other group the 
correlation between being a student with both residence and ex- 
tra-mural study, and mental score is positive. However, this 
correlation is extremely small, and we are certainly justified in 
concluding that mental score is independent of type of study. 
VI. Summary and CoNncLUsIONS 
(1) Mental ability and age are independent. 
(2) Mental ability and advancement are significantly cor- 
related. This fact is shown both by central tendencies and by the 
coefficient of correlation. 
(3) Mental ability and residence grades are strongly corre- 
lated which correlation increases sharply as we pass from the 
residence-extra-mural group, through the group with residence  
-P-A-G-E-193
RestpENCE ENROLMENT AND SCHOLASTIC STANDING 193 
study only, to the entering freshman group. Accordingly the 
correlation increases as age or maturity decreases. 
(4) Mental ability and type of study, as represented by 
those with both residence and extra-mural study and by those 
with residence study only, are independent. 
These results show that the tests used are valid since the 
scores made do not depend upon age. They show also that dif- 
ference in grades between the two groups of college students, one 
group with residence and extra-mural study, and the other with 
residence study only, cannot be explained on the ground of supe- 
rior mental ability in one group. These facts are made use of in 
the following chapter.
-P-A-G-E-194
    CHAPTER V 
Facrors taat Account ror Hiau GRADES 
In this chapter the following questions are considered: 
(1) Is age responsible for the fact that graduates with 
both residence and extra-mural study make somewhat higher 
grades than do graduates with residence study only? 
(2) Are age and advancement combined, responsible for the 
fact that students with both residence and extra-mural study 
make higher grades than do students with residence study only? 
(3) Is there an art of making grades? 
I. COMPARISONS OF GRADES IN DIFFERENT TYPES OF STUDY 
When students at large, or when students who have had 
both correspondence and residence study, or, when students 
who have had both correspondence and extension study are con- 
sidered, it is seen that correspondence grades are higher than 
residence or extension grades.!_ Moreover, extension grades under 
all conditions are higher than are residence grades. These differ- 
ences may be due to different standards of grading in the different 
types of study, or to certain other factors such as advancement 
and age, since it was found that advancement and age are strongly 
correlated with grades of all kinds, and since it was also found 
that students with extra-mural study are older and more advanced 
than are students with residence study only. However, when the 
same students are considered and still correspondence grades 
are highest, extension grades, next, and residence grades, lowest, it 
would seem that the standards of grading are different. In other 
words, the student in residence is probably held to a stricter ac- 
counting when grades are reported. 
II. CoMPaRISONS OF RESIDENCE GRADES FOR DIFFERENT 
TYPES OF STUDENTS 
It is seen also that the residence grades of 223 college graduates 
who had both residence and extra-mural study are somewhat 
higher than the residence grades of 157 graduates who had resi- 
dence study only. Although in the selection of this sample differ- 
ence in advancement is eliminated since all had completed 120 
semester hours or more of credit; and although difference in mental 
ability is eliminated since we found that mental ability is inde- 
pendent of being a student with both residence and extra-mural 
study and being a student with residence study only; and although 
slightly poorer health on the part of the group having both types 
of study is somewhat opposed to higher residence grades for this 
group than for the one having residence study only, those having 
both residence and extra-mural study make the higher residence 
grades. Now there is only one outstanding factor left that has 
'fable VI, Chapter 1, Part Two.
-P-A-G-E-195
  
Resipence ENROLMENT AND ScHOLAstic StanpiInG — 195 
appeared in this study that will account for the fact that grad-: 
uates with residence and extra-mural study receive higher resi- 
dence grades than do those with residence study only. That fac- 
tor is maturity or’age. The group with both types of study is 
older; hence, maturity seems to account for the higher residence 
grades. 
III. INFLUENCE OF AGE AND ADVANCEMENT ON RESIDENCE 
GRADES 
Age or maturity does not influence grades quite so much as 
does advancement. But even after advancement is eliminated 
by partial correlations, age is a sensible factor in determining resi- 
dence grades as the following sample shows: 
Let the subscripts 1, 2, 3 used with r, the coefficient of corre- 
lation, stand respectively for residence grades, age, and advance- 
ment. But for the 340 students who had both residence and 
extra-mural study ry=.20, ris3=.32, reg=.16. Then by the well- 
known formula for partial correlation 
phe Yig—T13- Y23 
MeV (aa) (ete) 
we find ry.3=.16. This coefficient is read the correlation of 
residence grades and age, with advancement out. Likewise we 
find that ri3.2.=.30. This result shows that the correlation of 
residence grades and advancement, with age out, is a rather marked 
correlation, and that it is considerably higher than the correlation 
of residence grades and age. Also when residence grades, age, 
and advancement of students with residence study only, are 
considered, we get practically the same results. 
IV. StuMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 
(1) Age and advancement combined are chiefly responsible 
for the fact that students with both residence and extra-mural 
study make considerably higher grades than do students with 
residence study only, though the two groups have the same mental 
ability, and the residence group is favored by somewhat better 
health. 
(2) Age and advancement may account in part for the fact 
that extra-mural grades are higher than residence grades, but not 
entirely, by any means, since extra-mural grades are higher than 
residence grades for the same students. 
(3) Age is chiefly responsible for the fact that graduates 
with both residence and extra-mural study make somewhat higher 
residence grades than do graduates with residence study only. 
(4) There appears to be an art of making grades. 
The facts brought out in the preceding paragraph lead us to 
ask if there is not an art of making grades. The more advanced 
and mature students may be more diligent and serious minded 
than are the less advanced and younger students, which quali-
-P-A-G-E-196
  196 Tur RELATION OF EXTRA-MURAL Stupy TO 
ties may explain why students with both residence and extra- 
mural study make not only higher grades in general, but also 
higher residence grades, than do students with residence study 
only. Also this older and more advanced group of students may 
know better how to study than does the younger and less advanced 
group, which aptitude may account for the higher grades received 
by those having both residence and extra-mural study. On the 
other hand, the older and more advanced students may know 
better how to please the teacher and how to fall in with the teach- 
er’s notion of a good recitation than do the younger and less ad- 
vanced students, or they may be more self assertive and dogmatic 
than are the younger and less advanced students, which attitudes 
may account for the higher grades received by those having both 
residence and extra-mural study. Boldness accompanied by ma- 
turity of manners and physical appearance may be accepted by the 
teacher as an index of knowledge and understanding; conse- 
quently, the mature and self assertive students may receive higher 
grades than do the youthful and less assertive ones. The fact 
that mental ability and grades are much more highly correlated 
in the entering freshman group and in the group having residence 
study only, than in the group having both residence and extra- 
ynural study, seemingly indicates that students having both types 
of study are receiving grades beyond those warranted by their 
mental ability. Thus it is fitting to ask: ‘Is there an art of 
making grades?’”’ The problems arising out of this question are 
interesting, and their solutions are vital to successful grading. 
To find these answers now would divert us from our original pur- 
pose, but they will doubtless be found by trained investigators 
who have at hand facilities for controlled experiments.
-P-A-G-E-197
CHAPTER VI 
Reiarions Invotvinc NUMBER OF STUDIES, ORDER OF 
ENROLMENT, AND GRADES 
In this chapter, for extra-mural students with residence 
study also, the following questions are considered: 
(1) Do those who begin with extra-mural study complete 
ae or less residence work than those do who begin with residence 
study? 
(2) Do those who begin with extra-mural study complete 
more or less extra-mural work than those do who begin with 
residence study? 
(3) Do those who begin with extra-mural study make higher 
or lower residence grades than those do who begin with residence 
study? 
(4) Do those who have had both residence and extra-mural 
study complete more work in residence than those do who have 
had residence study only? 
I. STATEMENT OF QUESTION AT ISSUE 
The effect of order of enrolment among extra-mural students 
upon number of studies completed in residence and upon residence 
grades has yet to be considered. When an extra-mural student 
has first connection with a school through extra-mural study, 
that person is said to have extra-mural study first, but if the first 
connection with the school is through residence study, that person 
is said to have residence study first or extra-mural study second. 
The question now arises, since extra-mural enrolments com- 
ing first, do not exert any appreciable influence upon later residence 
enrolments, whether those students who have had extra-mural 
study first, and later enroll in residence, show more perseverance 
than other students do; and whether in consequence they complete 
more studies in residence and in extra-mural work, and make 
higher residence grades than other students do. If they do com- 
plete more studies and make higher grades these facts might in a 
measure compensate the school for the small influence extra- 
mural study has in leading to residence enrolment; for then, al- 
though the number of residence registrations from the extra- 
mural study group might be small, these enrolments would be 
repeated from quarter to quarter, and would add consistently to 
the sum total of attendance. Moreover, superior scholarship 
would serve as further compensation for the small residence en- 
rolment coming from students having had extra-mural study 
first. 
Finally, the effect of extra-mural study upon residence at- 
tendance is considered. It is sometimes asked whether students 
who have had both residence and extra-mural study do not con-
-P-A-G-E-198
  198 ‘THE RELATION OF EXTRA-MURAL STUDY TO 
tinue longer in school, because of their extra-mural study, than do 
those who have had residence study only. If it can be shown that 
they remain appreciably longer in school than do those with resi- 
dence study only, there may be some compensation for the slight 
influence extra-mural study has on residence enrolment. 
II. Re ation BeTWEEN NUMBER OF RESIDENCE AND NUMBER 
OF EXTRA-MURAL STUDIES 
1. Kirksville ; 
We take, for the year 1919-1920, 470 students who had both 
extra-mural and residence study and find whether or not an in- 
crease in number of studies for one type means an increase for the 
other type also. Table XX XVII contains the tabulated data. 
By the product moment method r=—.047. There is a slight 
negative correlation between the number of residence and of 
extra-mural studies in a universe where students have had both 
types of study. To say the least there is substantial justification 
for concluding that the number of studies in the two types of 
study are independent, and that the number of residence studies 
completed does not increase as the number of extra-mural studies 
increases but actually tends to decrease. 
2. Warrensburg and Springfield 
At Warrensburg, between 1915-1922, 715 different students 
had both residence and extra-mural study. At Springfield, be- 
tween 1918-1921, 716 different students had both residence and 
extra-mural study. These 1431 students furnish material for a 
single correlation table between number of residence and of extra- 
mural studies. Table XXX VIII contains the tabulated data. 
The coefficient of correlation between number of residence and 
of extra-mural studies is r=.017. The correlation is very slightly 
positive, and indicates as near an independence between number of 
studies in the two types of work as could be expected. 
3. Conclusions 
The result accords well with that found at Kirksville. As 
extra-mural courses increase, nothing is added to the number of 
residence courses. If extra-mural courses actually keep up school 
interest, and hold students in school as some maintain, there 
should be a strong positive correlation in the foregoing tables. 
But instead one coefficient is slightly negative, and the other is 
positive by a very small margin.

  202 THE RELATION OF ExTRA-MURAL STUDY TO 
Pearson’s new method of correlation is used. 
Mean of whole distribution is 16.655; mean for those who 
had extra-mural study first, 3.994; standard deviation of whole 
distribution, 13.412. 
Therefore p/on=—.9440 
$(1—a) = .2298, 3(1-+a) =.7702, 2= 3032 
: Therefore §/ce= 1.3629 
Therefore ren=—.693 
This coefficient shows that the correlation of extra-mural study 
first, with number of residence studies is negative and very high. 
When a student has his first registration in extra-mural work, he 
seldom takes many studies in residence. 
Here, however, it may be said that the 179 extra-mural stu- 
dents who had no residence study at any time, should be excluded 
from the table since they evidently increase the negative correla- 
tion. Because there seems to be some merit in this contention, 
henceforth all extra-mural students who have had no residence 
study will be excluded. Also in the tabulations which follow for 
Warrensburg, Springfield, and Macomb, students who have not 
had residence study also, will be excluded since they serve only to 
increase numerically a negative correlation, or to reduce it if it is 
positive. So hereafter the universe will consist of students who 
have had both residence and extra-mural study. 
  b. Universe of extra-mural students with residence study 
Table XL contains the tabulated data. 
Mean of whole distribution is 19.414; mean’ for those who 
had extra-mural study first, 11.862; standard deviation for whole 
distribution, 12.602. 
Therefore p /on=—.5993 
3(1—a)=.0736,  3(1-+a) =.9264 2=.1394 
      
Therefore ren=—.317 
This coefficient shows that, even after the extra-mural students 
who had no residence study are excluded, there is still a strong 
negative correlation between extra-mural study first, and the 
number of studies completed in residence. In other words, the 
fact that a student pursues extra-mural study first, is a good 
indication that, under most favorable conditions, he will complete 
but little residence study. At Kirksville students of the whole uni- 
verse average a little less than 5 quarters in residence; those with 
residence study first, average 5 quarters; but those with extra-mural 
study first, average slightly less than 3 quarters. Moreover, 
the average time in residence, for students with residence study 
only, is, in two different universes studied, from: 5 to 5.7 quarters.

    204 THe RELATION OF EXTRA-MURAL STUDY TO 
2. Warrensburg 
a. Universe of extra-mural students with residence study 
Let us take for the years 1915-1922, all students who had both 
residence and extra-mural study. Table XLI contains the tab- 
ulated data. 
Mean of the whole distribution is 17.788; mean for those 
who had extra-mural study first, 4.232; standard deviation of 
whole distribution, 11.166. 
Therefore p /on=—1.2140 
3(1—a) =.0881,  4(1+a) 
Therefore G/oe= 1.813 
Therefore ren =—.670    Z=.1598 
At Warrensburg also the correlation between extra-mural study 
first, and the number of residence studies completed is negative 
and very strong. This result shows that students who enroll in 
residence after first having extra-mural study are not likely to 
complete many studies in residence. At Warrensburg students 
of the whole universe average a little more than 4 quarters in 
residence; those with residence study first, average nearly 5 
quarters; but those with extra-mural study first, average only 
1 quarter. 
3. Springfield 
a. Universe of extra-mural students with residence study 
We take, for the years 1918-1921, all students who had both 
residence and extra-mural study. Table XLII contains the tab- 
ulated data. 
Mean of whole distribution is 17.048; mean for those who 
had extra-mural study first, 7.667; the standard devitation for 
the whole distribution, 13.19. 
Therefore p /on=—.7036 
A(1—a)=.0964, 3(it+a)=.9136,  2=.1574 Therefore 9/ce= .1633 
Therefore ren=—.431 
At Springfield also there is strong negative correlation between 
extra-mural study first, and number of residence studies com- 
pleted. Springfield is intermediate between Kirksville and War- 
rensburg. At Springfield students of the whole universe average 
a little more than 4 quarters in residence; those with residence 
study first, average 4.5 quarters; but those with extra-mural study 
first, average a little less than 2 quarters. Is the condition noted 
in preceding tabulations peculiar to Missouri? Fortunately, 
these results can be checked by data from a teachers college of a 
neighboring state. 
4. Macomb, Illinois 
a. Universe of extra-mural students with residence study 
We take, for the years 1911-1923, a sample of students at Ma- 
comb who had both residence and extra-mural study. Table 
XLII contains the tabulated data.

  206 Tur Revation or ExTRA-MURAL Stupy To 
Mean of whole distribution is 8.638; mean for those who had 
extra-mural study first, 5.984; standard deviation of whole distri- 
bution, 8.008. 
Therefore p /on=—.3314 
3(1—a) = .3455, 4(1-4a) =.6545, Z4= 3686 
Therefore G/oe= 1.067 
Therefore ren=—.311 
So again and in another state the correlation between extra-mural 
study first, and number of studies completed in residence is nega- 
tive and has about the same strength as at Kirksville. At Ma- 
comb students of the whole universe average a little more than 2 
quarters in residence; those with residence study first, average 4.5 
quarters; but those with extra-mural study first, average only 
1.5 quarters. 
5. Conclusions 
(1) In four great, tax-supported, teacher producing insti- 
tutions, in a universe of extra-mural students with residence 
study also, it was found in each instance that there is a high nega- 
tive correlation between extra-mural study first, and number of 
residence studies completed. 
(2) It was found in the universe considered, that extra-mural 
students with residence study first, complete from 2 to 5 times as 
many studies in residence as do extra-mural students with extra- 
mural study first. Nor does the average number of residence 
studies completed by those with extra-mural study first, compare 
at all favorably with the average number of studies completed by 
those with residence study only. 
(3) It was shown earlier that very few of those, who have 
extra-mural study first, enroll in residence, and now it is found 
that those who do enroll do not continue long in residence. 
IV. OrprR OF ENROLMENT AND NUMBER OF EXTRA-MURAL 
STUDIES 
1. Statement of problem 
The preceding tables and discussion show that those, who en- 
roll in extra-mural study first, and later take residence study, do 
not attend school in residence nearly as long as do those who 
enroll in residence study first, and later take extra-mural study. 
It is also of interest to ask how first enrolment in extra-mural 
study affects the number of extra-mural courses completed. This 
question is considered for Kirksville, Warrensburg, Springfield, 
and Macomb. Extra-mural students are taken for the same 
periods as they were under section III of this chapter. Since, 
however, only extra-mural studies are considered there is no 
reason for excluding students who had no residence study as was 
done under section ITT.

  For Macomb, since the number of students with residence study 
first, is less than one-half of the total number, the correlation was 
found between residence study first, and the number of extra- 
mural studies. The computation gives rm=.467, Hence the cor- 
relation between extra-mural study first, and the number of extra- 
mural studies is ren = —.467. 
3. Conclusions 
It thus appears that the correlation between extra-mural study 
first, and number of extra-mural studies completed is also strongly 
negative in all schools studied except at Warrensburg where it 
has an insignificant positive correlation. These results indicate 
that students who begin their college work through extra-mural 
study are not inclined to take even as many extra-mural studies 
as are those who begin their college study in residence. 
V. ORDER OF ENROLMENT AND RESIDENCE GRADES 
1. Statement of problem 
Finally, in a universe of extra-mural students with residence 
study it is important to know the effect of order of enrolment on 
residence grades. There were 1062 different extra-mural students 
at Kirksville from 1914-1922. Of those who had extra-mural 
study first, 65 later enrolled for residence study. For some reason 
7 of these made no grades in residence. To be fair these 7 are ex- 
cluded, leaving only 58 who made residence grades. To these is 
added a random sample of 340 students of the year 1919-1920 who 
had both residence and extra-mural grades. The two groups 
combined furnish a universe of 398 students who have had both 
residence and extra-mural study—58 of these had extra-mural 
study first, and 340 had residence study first. Is there any re- 
lation in this universe between extra-mural study first and resi- 
dence grades?

3. Conclusions 
There is a significant negative correlation between extra-mural 
study first, and residence grades. In the universe of extra-mural 
students with residence study, those students who had their 
first connection with the college through extra-mural study do 
not make as high residence grades as do those who have their 
first connection through residence study. 
VI. ReLaTION BETWEEN EXTRA-MURAL STUDY AND THE 
NUMBER OF SEMESTER HOURS COMPLETED IN RESIDENCE 
1. Amount of residence credit completed, when advance- 
ment and time at which residence study began are not taken into 
account . 
Comparison is made between the credits of students having 
residence study only and of those having both residence and 
extra-mural study. In Part One of this study it was shown that 
having extra-mural study first, does not lead to residence enrol- 
ment. In section II of this chapter by means of Tables XX XVII 
and XX XVIII it has been shown for Kirksville, Warrensburg, and 
Springfield that the number of residence and the number of extra- 
mural studies completed are independent; hence, residence credit 
does not increase with extra-mural credit. In section III of this 
chapter it has just been shown for the three schools named above 
that there is strong negative correlation between having extra- 
mural study first and the number of residence studies completed. 
By reference to Tables XXI and XXII of Chapter IIT, Part 
Two, the mean of the number of residence studies completed by 
those having residence study only is 22.73 and the mean of the 
number of residence studies completed by those having both 
residence and extra-mural study is 24.53. In other words when 
253 students with residence study only and 280 students with 
both residence and extra-mural study are selected at random 
without any reference to equal advancement and the year when 
in school, those students having both types of study complete on 
an average 1.8 studies or 4.5 semester hours more of residence cred- 
it than do those who have residence study only. Were this com- 
parison accepted as a fair one, extra-mural study would appear to 
add 5 weeks to the residence attendance of each residence student 
who has also had extra-mural study. But evidently this com- 
parison is unfair to those students who have had residence study 
only. The truth of this statement appears from two distinct
-P-A-G-E-211
Restpence ENROLMENT AND SCHOLASTIC STANDING 211 
considerations. (1) Students who have had two or more types 
of study are older and they are also more advanced, when both 
residence and extra-mural studies are counted, than are students 
who have residence study only; consequently, among the resi- 
dence students referred to in Chapter III, Part Two, there has 
been no elimination in many instances because of inability to pur- 
sue college studies. But such eliminations have taken place 
among extra-mural students having residence study at Kirksville 
in as much as 77.5 per cent of all students having extra-mural 
study have completed one or more quarters in residence before 
taking extra-mural study, and 92.6 per cent of all extra-mural 
students who have enrolled in residence had residence study before 
extra-mural study.2 (2) It is also unfair to the group of stu- 
dents having residence study only, in making up the average of 
residence studies in the residence-extra-mural group, to count 
residence studies that were completed before extra-mural study 
was taken, and then ascribe credit for the whole of residence at- 
tendance to extra-mural study. 
2. Amount of residence credit completed, when advance- 
ment and time at which residence study began are taken into 
account 
Comparison is made between the credits of students having 
residence study only and of those having both residence and 
extra-mural study; students in the two groups are of equal resi- 
dence advancement and also are in school at the time the count of 
credit begins. 
The files of student records at Kirksville were taken alpha- 
betically and 247 students were found who had been in residence 
and had pursued their first extra-mural study in some one of the 
years 1917-1918, 1918-1919, 1919-1920, or 1920-1921. These 
students therefore had from three to six years to enter school again 
for residence work after having had their first extra-mural study. 
However, 25 of these, or 10 per cent of them, never entered again 
for residence study after taking up extra-mural study. To be per- 
feetly fair to extra-mural study these 25 were excluded from this 
investigation and the remaining 222 students who entered again 
for further residence study were retained for purposes of com- 
parison. The number of residence studies completed before the 
first extra-mural study was taken is noted, and constitutes the 
advancement of this group of students at the time the compari- 
sons begin; and the number of residence studies completed, after 
these students entered again for residence study, following their 
first extra-mural study, represents the achievement of the resi- 
dence-extra-mural group of students after the influence of extra- 
mural study is operative upon residence attendance. Also the 
quarter of the year that each of these residence-extra-mural stu- 
*Chapter VI, Part One, II: 3-(2), (3).
-P-A-G-E-212
  212 Tue Reiation or EXTRA-MURAL Stupy TO 
dents entered again for residence study, after having had extra- 
mural study for the first time, is noted. The files of student rec- 
ords were again examined alphabetically for students with resi- 
dence study only, who were in school during the same quarters 
that the residence-extra-mural students were in school upon their 
return to residence study after first having extra-mural study, and 
who also were of the same advancement, in intervals of 10 hours, 
as were the residence-extra-mural students at the time of their 
return to residence study. Thus there is formed a one to one cor- 
respondence between the 222 students in each of these two groups, 
so that when paired one by one the pairs were in school and were of 
the same advancement, measured in terms of residence studies, at 
the time the count of residence credits began for purposes of com- 
parison in the two groups. 
Table XLIX shows the number of semester hours completed 
in residence by these two groups of students after the time the 
one to one groupings were made. 
In this table the number of semester hours listed is the num- 
ber completed in residence by each of the paired groups counting 
from the time residence-extra-mural students entered again for 
residence study immediately following their first extra-mural 
study. The mean of the number of hours for students having 
residence study only is 33.00; the mean for those having both 
types of study, 31.70; the mean of the whole distribution, 32.33; 
the standard deviation, 22.50. 
Therefore p /on=—.0280 
4(1—a) =.5000, 3(1+a) =.5000, z= 3990 
Therefore G /ov = .7980 
Therefore rbn =—.035 
Accordingly there is a slight negative correlation between 
being a student with both residence and extra-mural study and 
the number of semester hours completed in residence. It is also 
observed that students with residence study only actually com- 
plete on an average 1.3 semester hours more than do those who 
have had both types of study. These results show that extra- 
mural study does not hold students in school for residence study 
and thereby increase residence attendance, but that it has a slight 
tendency to decrease the amount of work done in residence and 
consequently decreases attendance slightly. This conclusion is 
reached in a comparison where all residence-extra-mural students 
who did not return for residence study after having had their first 
extra-mural study, are excluded. Moreover, the residence stu- 
dent is not selected for purposes of comparison until the residence- 
extra-mural student is back in school and pursuing residence 
studies after having had extra-mural study for the first time. If 
the comparison had begun with the last quarter the extra-mural 
student was in residence, just before taking his first extra-mural

study, then the students with residence study only would have 
made a still better showing than was made in the table above, 
for they would have had on an average about 9 months longer to 
be in school. There are good reasons that could be advanced for 
having the comparisons begin at the time suggested above, but 
these considerations were left out of account, and comparisons 
were made beginning at the time the extra-mural student was 
back in residence after completing his first extra-mural study. 
Even on this basis it is found that extra-mural study does not 
increase residence study, but, on the contrary, slightly decreases it. 
It is also found that the mean of the total number of hours 
completed in residence by students having residence study only 
is 74.05; the mean of, the total number of hours completed in resi- 
dence by students having both types of study is 72.59, and the 
mean of the number of hours completed by them in extra-mural 
study is 6.30. The former group had 48 graduates, the latter 52. 
3. Conclusions 
(1) The number of residence and the number of extra- 
mural studies completed are independent. 
(2) There is high negative correlation between extra-mural 
study first, and the number of residence studies completed. 
(3) For students selected without any reference to advance- 
ment and the year when in school, those students having both resi- 
dence and extra-mural study make 4.5 semester hours more of 
residence credit than do those having residence study only. 
(4) For students selected with equal advancement and in 
school at the time the count of credit begins, those students hay- 
ing both residence and extra-mural study make 1.3 semester hours 
less of residence credit than do those having residence study only. 
(5) Extra-mural study does not increase residence attend- 
ance. In fact a slight negative correlation exists between being 
a student with both residence and extra-mural study, and the 
number of semester hours completed. 
VII. SumMMaRY AND CONCLUSIONS 
In answer to the questions raised at the beginning of this 
chapter the following facts are established and apply to a uni- 
verse of extra-mural students with residence study also: 
(1) The number of residence, and the number of extra-mural 
studies are independent. 
(2) Those students who begin with extra-mural study, com- 
plete much less work in residence than do those who begin with 
residence study. They also complete much less work in residence 
than do those who have residence study only. To begin with 
extra-mural study is to hazard the probability of doing very 
much residence study. 
’Part Two: Chapter II, Table XI; Chapter III, Table XXI; Chapter 
VI, Table XL.

(3) Those who begin with extra-mural study, complete 
fewer extra-mural courses than do those who begin with residence 
study. 
(4) Those who begin with extra-mural study, make lower 
residence grades than do those who begin with residence study. 
(5) Those who have had both residence and extra-mural 
study complete slightly less work in residence, than do those of 
equal advancement who have had residence study only. In other 
words, extra-mural study does not increase residence attendance. 
The number of residence studies is independent of the num- 
ber of extra-mural studies. Residence-extra-mural students 
who begin with extra-mural study, complete fewer residence 
and fewer extra-mural studies, and also make lower residence 
grades than do residence-extra-mural students who begin with 
residence study. Moreover, extra-mural study does not increase 
residence attendance. These facts should be kept in mind by 
administrators, for they show that the residence-extra-mural stu- 
dent who is brought in by extra-mural study, is not nearly as 
desirable as the one brought in by residence study; they also 
show that extra-mural study does not hold students in school. 
These remarkable results appearing collectively or sepa- 
rately in four great teacher producing institutions cannot be the 
result of chance. They offer no compensation for the insignificant 
influence extra-mural study has on residence enrolment.

PART THREE 
CHAPTER I 
SUMMARY AND CoNncLusION 
I. Mernops oF INVESTIGATION 
1. General statement 
In this chapter results appearing in Part One and Part Two 
of this study are summarized and outstanding conclusions given. 
The study deals with four teachers colleges of Missouri, and with 
one in Illinois. The State Teachers College at Kirksville receives 
particular attention in the study, especially in connection with 
grades. 
2. Statistical procedure 
Both the theory of attributes and of variables are used ees 
sively in this investigation. Association formulae and_ coeffi- 
cients of association are employed frequently. The correlation 
coefficient and correlation ratio are employed where needed. The 
regression equation is used for purposes of showing relationship 
and extent of correlation. Pearson’s new method of determining 
correlation when one variable is given by alternative and the other 
-by multiple categories is used for showing relationships and for 
interpreting results. His new method of correlation adapted 
to a variable and an attribute is also used frequently because of 
the nature of the material considered. Mean square contingency, 
coupled with methods which determine the nature of relationships, 
is almost indispensable in this study. Tetrachoric functions are 
employed occasionally to verify other and shorter methods of pro- 
cedure. Weights to be attached to orders of influence and to 
grades are determined, and a method for dealing with orders of 
influence that lead to enrolment is devised. 
II. ReLATION OF EXTRA-MURAL STUDY TO RESIDENCE ENROL- 
MENT 
A summary of findings now follows which shows the influ- 
ence of extra-mural study in leading to residence enrolment. 
1. Consensus of opinion concerning extra-mural study 
Reasons assigned in bulletins for offering extra-mural courses 
appear as follows, if listed in the order of frequency of reference: 
“Tt extends the opportunity for an education to all’’; ‘It extends 
the means of education to those whose schooling has been inter- 
fered with’; and, “It improves teachers while in service”.2 If 
we turn to questionnaires, we find that the leading purpose as given . 
is: ‘It improves teachers while in service’’.® But in replies to 
1Chapter IX, Part One; Chapter I, Part Two. 
2Chapter II, Part One. 
8Collier’s questionnaire, and Kirksville questionnaire, Chapter II, Part 
One.
-P-A-G-E-217
  ResIpENCE ENROLMENT AND SCHOLASTIC STANDING 217 
both of these questionnaires there appears a well defined belief 
that extra-mural study leads to residence enrolment. In Mr. Col- 
lier’s questionnaire, which was answered by presidents and di- 
rectors of extra-mural work in teacher training institutions, more 
persons gave as a reason for offering extra-mural study, “It stim- 
ulates residence enrolment” than any other reason except, “It 
aids teachers in service”. In the Kirksville questionnaire which 
was answered mainly by teachers of extra-mural courses, item 
(ce) of section (A): ‘“‘Leads to residence enrolment” should prob- 
ably be assigned fifth place, though it stands fourth in the total 
number of times it is listed. Out of 152 persons replying 72, or 
47.4 per cent of all persons replying, make mention of extra-mural 
study leading to residence enrolment. Moreover, as previously 
stated, none of the headings under section (A) of the question- 
naire exclude (c) and might easily imply it. Also it is evident 
from a study of bulletins and from observation that there is hesi- 
tancy in saying publicly: ‘‘Extra-mural study leads to residence 
enrolment”’. : 
However, item (a) of section (B) of the Kirksville question- 
naire gives the frank view of teachers as to the influence of extra- 
mural study in leading to residence enrolment. Out of 149 per- 
sons replying, 51 say the influence of extra-mural study in lead- 
ing to residence enrolment is pronounced; 87 say it is moderate, 
and only 11, that it is inconsequential. That extra-mural study 
leads to residence enrolment is strongly maintained in a.recent 
bulletin by the Bureau of Education.t So there is a well defined 
belief that extra-mural study leads to residence enrolment. More- 
over, why should this not be a worthy reason to assign for offering 
extra-mural courses? This reason cannot conflict with the one 
so often mentioned; namely, ‘‘To improve teachers in service’’. 
No one maintains that efficient teachers can be prepared through 
extra-mural study alone. Great institutions, state support, en- 
dowment, equipment, libraries, faculties, and student activities 
are all provided on the theory that teachers are to be educated and 
prepared through large cooperative and group enterprises such as 
can be furnished only for residence instruction. No one holds 
that extra-mural study is to bolster up weak, inefficient teachers 
who are void of desire and of ambition to make serious prepara- 
tion for a life’s work through residence study. The only alterna- 
tive to this undesirable condition is that extra-mural students 
without residence study may become residence students. 
By consensus of opinion expressed in the questionnaire, for a 
student to earn one hour of credit in extension takes a little less 
than twice as much of the teacher’s time as to earn one hour of 
credit in residence, whereas to earn one hour of credit in corre- 
spondence takes a little more than twice as much of the teacher’s 
time as to earn one hour of credit in residence. The view is also

expressed that 1 extension student equals about 2 residence stu- 
dents and 1 correspondence student equals from 2 to 3 residence 
students when comparison is made on basis of time required of 
teachers. 
2. Relation between residence, correspondence, and ex- 
tension enrolments 
In Chapter III, Part One, all students enrolled in any type 
of study for the four years 1919-1923 were considered. Enrolments 
in residence, correspondence, and extension study were accepted 
as facts without any reference to the type of study which preceded, 
or to the causal factors involved. 
From this chapter, by the use of complete and partial associa- 
tion formulae, the following results appear: 
(1) Correspondence and extension enrolments are strongly 
associated. This fact indicates that correspondence students 
are much more likely to take extension study than are students 
at large, and that extension students are much more likely to take 
correspondence study than are studerits at large. 
(2) No conclusion is reached concerning the association 
between residence and correspondence enrolments, and between 
residence and extension enrolments. In the whole universe 
these associations are negative, but they can be accounted for by 
the constitution of the universe. The association between resi- 
dence and correspondence enrolments is positive in the universe 
of extension students, and the association between residence and 
extension enrolments is positive in the universe of extension stu- 
dents. But here also the universe of prospective students is too 
limited. 
(3) Each type of study serves as a connecting link between 
the two remaining types. If a student has any two types of study, 
the chances are largely in favor of his having the third type also. 
It is also clear that correspondence students, and to a less degree 
extension students, consist chiefly of persons who have had resi- 
dence study. 
3. Influence of extra-mural study on residence enrolment 
a. Order of enrolment 
In this investigation there is something more fundamental 
than the actual status of types of enrolment. When a student 
has been enrolled in more than one type of study, the order in 
which the enrolments took place becomes very important, if the 
influence of one type of enrolment in leading to other types of en- 
rolment is to. be determined. 
b. Whole universe of students 
In this universe at Kirksville, 1919-1920, residence students 
are .very strongly associated with first study in residence. In 
fact Q=.923. Consequently, among students in general, a prob- 
ability, amounting almost to certainty, exists that a given resi- 
dence student did not have extra-mural study as first enrolment.

  ResipENCE ENROLMENT AND SCHOLASTIC STANDING 219 
ce. Universe of students who had both residence and 
extra-mural study 
In this universe at Kirksville, 1919-1920, there is almost per- 
fect association between residence enrolments and _ first enrol- 
ments. Q=.996. This association indicates that students who 
have had both residence and extra-mural enrolments almost with- 
out exception have residence enrolment first. Naturally the co- 
efficients of association are positive and large, as explained in 
Chapter IV, Part One. But, if extra-mural study were func- 
tioning appreciably in bringing students into residence, the coeffi- 
cients would be reduced considerably below unity in each uni- 
verse. The significant fact is not that the associations are posi- 
tive, but that both are almost complete. 
d. Universe of public school teachers of northeast 
Missouri 
The universe of teachers furnishes a good standard for com- 
parison. In this universe there is a slight negative association 
between residence study at Kirksville and first enrolment in extra- 
mural study. Here Q=—.062, and r=—.023. When teachers 
at large are considered, some new and some old, some students in 
other colleges and some graduates of other colleges, some just 
graduated from high school and some who have been students at 
Kirksville, it is found that the student who begins with extra- 
mural study at Kirksville is less likely to enroll for residence study 
at Kirksville than is a teacher selected at random from the uni- 
ae exclusive of those who have had residence study at Kirks- 
ville. 
Moreover, extra-mural study is strongly associated with ear- 
lier residence enrolment in the universe of teachers. The associa- 
tion is expressed by Q=.809. 
e. Conclusions 
From Chapter IV, Part One, the following well established 
results appear: 
(1) Nearly all residence students have their first connec- 
tion with the school through residence study. 
(2) The great majority of extra-mural students have resi- 
dence instruction before they take up extra-mural study. This 
condition does not exist at Macomb, Illinois. 
(3) Extra-mural study does not increase residence enrol- 
ment appreciably. 
(4) Extra-mural students who have had no residence in- 
struction in a school are hardly as good prospective residence stu- 
dents as are teachers chosen at random, who also have had no 
residence instruction. 
4, Extra-mural students as prospective college students 
a. Introductory statement 
In Chapter V, Part One, it was found by an intensive and 
rather extensive study of high school graduates, that those who
-P-A-G-E-220
    220 Tue Revation or Exrra-MURAL Srupy To 
have a college preference are much the best prospective students, 
that those who have no school preference come next, and that those 
who prefer another school come last of all. The standards set 
up in Chapter V, Part One, are used for purpose of comparisons 
in Chapter VI, Part One. 
Our universe has now been extended to include the extra- 
mural students of three teachers colleges of Missouri and one in 
Illinois. The schools in Missouri are Kirksville, Warrensburg, and 
Springfield; the one in Illinois is Macomb. 
b. Teachers colleges of Missouri | 
If in Chapter VI, Part One, k stands for Kirksville; w, for 
Warrensburg; s, for Springfield and a, for the three schools com- 
bined, then the coefficients of association between residence study 
and first enrolment, in the universe of extra-mural students who 
have had residence study also are Qk=.983, Qw=.982, Qs=.977, 
and Qa=.983. In the same universe, by tetrachoric functions, the 
coefficient of correlation between residence study and first en- 
rolment for the three schools combined is PS .98. This universe 
gets at the heart of the question. These coefficients show that 
the data dealt with in Missouri are homogeneous; they indicate 
that practically all students of teachers colleges of Missouri have 
their first connection with the school through residence study. 
Hence residence students whe had their first connection with 
the school through extra-mural study are practically negligible. 
If the whole universe of extra-mural students without restriction 
is used the coefficients are just slightly less. It is clear that extra- 
mural study first, in Missouri has no appreciable effect in ad- 
vancing residence enrolment. f 
c. Macomb Teachers College 
The consideration of the influence of extra-mural study on 
residence enrolment raised some difficult questions at Macomb. 
These difficulties were fully considered in Chapter VI, Part One. 
It is evident, if extra-mural study increases residence enrolment, 
that the increase must come from extra-mural students who had 
extra-mural study first. | 
In the Missouri schools, especially at Kirksville, the number 
who have extra-mural study first is small, whereas at Macomb, 
Illinois, the number is large. However, the per cent of those, 
who had their first connection with a school through extra-mural 
study and later entered for residence study, is as follows: 26.6 
per cent at Kirksville, 22 per cent at Warrensburg, 21.6 per cent 
at Springfield, and 12.6 per cent at Macomb. Though Macomb 
reaches many more new students than the Missouri schools do, 
a smaller per cent of those, who had extra-mural study first, comes 
later into residence study in Ilinois than in Missouri. 
The same conclusion is reached by forming a fourfold table 
between extra-mural study in Missouri and Illinois as one var- 
iate, and residence registration and non-registration as the other 
    
   
-P-A-G-E-221

variate. It gives Q=.323. This result shows that extra-mural 
study in Missouri, when compared with extra-mural study in 
Illinois, is strongly associated with residence registration when 
the universe consists of extra-mural students with extra-mural 
study first. But it is seen that extra-mural study in Missouri 
has very little influence on residence enrolment. Hence the in- 
fluence in Illinois is even less, and the conditions found in Missouri 
extend beyond the boundaries of the state. 
d. Application of standards 
In Chapter V, Part One, a study was made of the relation 
between college preference and later registration of high school 
graduates. The standards derived for high school graduates that 
enrolled at Kirksville are now employed.’ When high school 
graduates are classified as, ‘ Kirksville preference’’, “No prefer- 
ence”, “Other school preference”, and ‘All high school gradu- 
ates”, the numbers expressing the per cent of each group that 
later enrolled at Kirksville are, respectively: 
40.1, 15.7, 10.9, 22.2. 
The numbers expressing the per cent of extra-mural students 
with extra-mural study first, who enrolled for residence study at 
Kirksville, Warrensburg, Springfield, Macomb, and all four schools 
combined are, respectively: 
26.6, 22.0, 21.6, 12.6, 17.4. 
The per cent of residence enrolments is highest at Kirksville 
and lowest at Macomb. 
e. Conclusions 
In this universe of extra-mural students, with extra-mural 
study first, it is found: 
(1) The per cent of residence enrolments for each school is 
much lower than the per cent of enrolments for high school grad- 
uates who prefer Kirksville. 
(2) The per cent of residence enrolments for all extra-mural 
students, in the four schools combined, is considerably less than 
a per cent of enrolments for all high school graduates at Kirks- 
ville. 
(3) The per cent of residence enrolments for all extra-mural 
students, in the four schools combined, is only slightly greater 
than the per cent of enrolments for the ‘“‘No preference” group 
of high school graduates at Kirksville. 
It therefore follows that extra-mural students with extra- 
mural study first, as prospective college students, are almost 
exactly on a par with high school graduates who have no college 
preference; they are not quite as good prospective students as 
high school graduates in general; and, when compared with high 
school graduates with college preference, extra-mural students

  222 THe RELATION OF EXTRA-MURAL Stupy TO 
are completely outclassed. Thus public school teachers and 
high school graduates furnish teachers colleges more accessible 
and productive universes of prospective residence students than 
do extra-mural students whose first connections with the school 
are through extra-mural study. 
5. College graduates, and extra-mural study 
a. Common belief 
Doubtless, some persons think that the influence of extra- 
mural study on residence enrolment will be at a maximum among 
college graduates. If extra-mural students are ambitious, per- 
sistent, and full of initiative, as some writers of extension course 
bulletins seem to think, there may be ground for this belief. 
b. Conclusions 
Data are available from Kirksville, Warrensburg, Spring- 
field, and Macomb for 970 graduates. 
These results follow: 
(1) Eleven graduates out of 970 had extra-mural study first, 
and nine of these eleven came into residence through extension 
study.® 
(2) At Kirksville, Warrensburg, Springfield, and Macomb 
respectively, 1 out of 381, 1 out of 162, 1 out of 42, and 1 out of 
16 graduates had extra-mural study first. There were only 48 
graduates at Macomb. 
(3) For all schools combined, out of every 88 persons being 
graduated 1 had extra-mural study before being enrolled for 
residence study. 
(4) Out of 852 graduates in the three Missouri schools dur- 
ing the last 4 years, 8 persons, or 1 out of 106, had extra-mural 
study first, and 6 out of these 8 came into residence through ex- 
tension study.” 
(5) In the three Missouri schools, during the last four years 
436 graduates had both residence and extra-mural study; 428 of 
these had residence study first, and 8 had extra-mural study first. 
The coefficient of association between residence study, and first 
enrolment in this universe is Q=.9993. This coefficient shows 
that extra-mural study is a negligible factor in leading to residence 
enrolment among teachers college graduates of Missouri. 
Thus the influence of extra-mural study on residence enrol- 
ment is even less among college graduates than among students 
in general. 
6. Views of students as to influences that led to residence 
enrolment 
a. Nature of replies 
The views of 2272 students were secured as to leading influ- 
ences, aside from accessibility and economic reasons, that induced 
°Table XLH, Chapter VIII, Part Two.

them to enroll in a teachers college. At Kirksville the views of 
students were obtained during the spring quarter which is typical 
of the enrolment for the three quarters of the regular school year. 
Also the views of students were obtained at Kirksville, Warrens- 
burg, and Cape Girardeau for the summer quarter of 1923. As 
students who have had extra-mural study are congregated in the 
summer quarter, the samples of replies received are decidedly fav- 
orable to extra-mural study.’ 
b. Conclusions 
By the special methods devised for dealing with the data of 
Chapter CX, Part One, it is found that, when all schools are con- 
sidered, extra-mural study ranks next to lowest in the ten well 
defined influences listed as leading to residence enrolment; but, 
when the spring quarter at Kirksville is taken as representative of 
the three quarters of the regular school year at the four schools 
considered, then extra-mural study stands lowest of the ten enum- 
erated influences leading to residence enrolment. In brief, the 
results deduced are: 
(1) Consensus of opinion, expressed mainly by summer 
term students in three teachers colleges of Missouri, places 
“Newspapers and advertising” lowest with a strength of 2.8 per 
cent, ‘“ Extra-mural study” next lowest with a strength of 3.2 
per cent, and “Teachers in home schools” highest with a strength 
of 19.6 per cent. 
(2) Consensus of opinion, expressed by spring term students 
at Kirksville, places ‘ Extra-mural study” lowest with a strength 
of .9 of 1 per cent, “Newspapers and advertising” next lowest: 
with a strength of 3.1 per cent, and “Teachers in home schools” 
tied with ‘‘Parents and relatives” for highest place, each with a 
strength of 18.9 per cent. 
Since the expressed views of students in a universe especially 
favorable to extra-mural study coincide quite definitely with the 
findings noted in this study, the conclusion is reached that extra- 
mural study exercises a very minor influence on residence enrol- 
ment. However, this conclusion is at wide variance with the 
consensus of opinion expressed by teachers of extra-mural courses.’ 
It is also in direct contradiction to the views expressed in a bul- 
letin by Arthur J. Klein." 
7. Relation between types of study and order of enrolment, 
a. Relations involved 
In Chapter VII there is found the relation between residence, 
correspondence, and extension study in connection with order of 
enrolment, when students have had at least one type of extra- 
mural study, and residence study also. Data from Kirksville, 
’Table LV, Chapter LX, Part One.

    224 Tur Revation or Exrra-murau Stupy To 
Warrensburg, and Springfield treated by the mean square contin- 
gency method, and by Pearson’s new method of correlation show 
very definite relations between type of study, and order of enrol- 
ment. 
b. Conclusions 
(1) It has been shown for each of the three Missouri schools 
separately, and for all combined that there is strong positive cor- 
relation between type of study, and order of enrolment as we pass 
rom correspondence through extension to residence study, while 
at the same time we pass from third enrolment to first along the 
enrolment variate. 
(2) It appears from the standpoint of order of enrolment 
hat extension study is much more closely related to residence 
study than is correspondence study. This fact suggests that 
ype of study represents contact with teacher, and that different 
degrees of this contact, in diminishing strength, are represented 
by residence, extension, and correspondence; and that order of 
enrolment represents established relationship with a school, and 
hat different degrees of this relationship in diminishing strength 
are represented by first, second, and third enrolments. 
(3) - The close relationship between residence and extension 
study noted in (1) and (2) also holds for the universe of college 
graduates and appears repeatedly under varying conditions in 
his study. It suggests that extension study probably has greater 
influence on residence enrolment than has correspondence study. 
This view is borne out in a study of college graduates.!! The re- 
ationship noted doubtless has an important lesson for organizers 
and administrators of extra-mural courses. It indicates that, if 
extra-mural courses are to be offered, it would be well to devote 
more time to extension courses, and less to correspondence courses.   Til. ReLarioN OF ©wXTRA-MURAL STUDY TO SCHOLASTIC 
STANDING 
1. Consensus of opinion concerning extra-mural study 
Reference is made to the Kirksville questionnaire in Chapter 
II, Part One. From (b) in section (B), it is seen that the con- 
sensus of opinion is that residence and extra-mural grades of stu- 
dents in general are about the same (with the weight of opinion 
slightly inclined to the view that extra-mural grades are higher). 
In (c) the view is expressed that residence grades of persons hay- 
ing both residence and extra-mural credits are higher than the 
grades of those having residence study only. In (d) the view is 
expressed that extra-mural students have ability superior to that 
of students who have had residence study only. In (e) the con- 
sensus of opinion is emphatic in the view that extra-mural study 
is inferior to residence study from the standpoint of helpfulness 
to the student. The consensus of opinion of extra-mural students

who answered the last question supports with less unanimity the 
view expressed by teachers. 
Mr. Klein says, “students in residence who have taken work 
by correspondence ordinarily rank in the upper fourth of their 
classes.””!2. Mr. Klein also says that ‘‘the average of preparation 
of earnestness and of intellectual capacity of correspondence stu- 
dents, when compared with [sic] the average college student’ in 
residence, is far higher.” Later these opinions are checked against 
facts. 
2. Grades in different types of study 
a. Extent of inquiry 
A careful and detailed study was made of grades in the 
Teachers College at Kirksville. To some extent the data at Kirks- 
ville were supplemented by data from Macomb, Illinois. As far 
as comparisons were made only minor differences in results ap- 
peared. 
b. Conclusions 
By reference to Chapter I, Part Two, and in particular to 
Table VI, it is found that these results follow for Kirksville: 
(1) Students who have had both residence and extension 
study, or residence and correspondence study make higher grades 
in residence than do students with residence study only, higher 
grades in extension than do students with extension study only, 
and higher grades in correspondence than do students with cor- 
respondence study only. This result conforms with the consen- 
sus of opinion expressed in (c) of section (B) of the questionnaire. 
(2) When grades in the three types of study are compared, 
they are in every instance lowest in residence study, medium in 
extension study, and highest in correspondence study. This re- 
lation is true whether we compare grades of students in general, 
grades of students with only one type of study, or grades of stu- 
dents with both residence and extension study, both residence 
and correspondence study, or both extension and correspondence 
study. The results appearing here go far beyond the meager 
difference intimated by consensus of opinion in (b) section (B) of 
the questionnaire. 
(3) Variability is least among residence grades, medium 
among extension grades, and greatest among correspondence 
grades. This result is also true in every type of comparison men- 
tioned in (2) above. At Macomb variability is less among ex- 
tension grades than among residence grades. 
(4) Residence grades are better criteria of either corre- 
spondence or extension grades than correspondence or extension 
grades are of residence grades; and extension grades are better 
criteria of residence grades than are correspondence grades. These 
deductions follow from the coefficients of correlation and regres- 
sion.

-P-A-G-E-226
  226 Tue RELATION OF ExTRA-MURAL Stupy To 
\ 
(5) Extension and residence study appear to be more closely 
related than do correspondence and residence study. This rela- 
tion is evident when we consider central tendencies, méasures 
of dispersion, and coefficients of correlation and regression. 
(6) Students who have had both residence and extra-mural 
study make slightly higher residence grades and grades of some- 
what less variability than do students of equal advancement, with 
residence’ study only. There is a small but significant. correla- 
tion between being a student with both residence and extra-mural 
study, and residence grades. Mr. Klein is correct in his assump- 
tion that residence grades of persons having extra-mural study are 
higher than grades of classmates not having had extra-mural study. 
However, at Kirksville, the extra-mural students would fall far 
short of being in the upper fourth of the class. 
3. Relation of grades to age, and advancement 
a. Purpose in view 
In Chapter II, Part Two, of this study grades and other 
attributes are compared. Attempt is made to discover factors 
that affect grades, and to measure the extent of the relationship. 
b. Conclusions 
(1) Age and advancement are both significantly correlated 
with grades, whether residence, extension, or correspondence. 
(2) For both age and advancement this correlation is great- 
est for residence grades, medium for extension grades, and lowest 
for correspondence grades. 
(3) For both age and advancement the correlation with resi- 
dence grades in general is greatest when the students have also 
had some form of extra-mural study. 
(4) Students having residence study and some form of 
extra-mural study are older and more advanced than students hay- 
ing residence study only. 
Doubtless, (4) is mainly responsible for the relation observed 
in (3). It is also found that for students with residence study 
only, the correlation between age and grades increases from 
group to group as the age of the group increases.!® Since extra- 
mural students with residence study are older and more advanced 
than students with residence study only, and since both age and 
advancement are correlated with grades, it is clear why students 
with residence study only, make lower grades than are made in 
residence by students who have had both residence and extra- 
mural study. But age and advancement do not explain why 
the same students make lowest grades in residence, medium in 
extension, and highest in correspondence courses.

type of study 
a. Source of material 
This topic is considered in Chapter III, Part Two. Accurate’

-P-A-G-E-227
ResipENCcE ENROLMENT AND SCHOLASTIC STANDING 227 
records of health examinations given at Kirksville make this 
phase of inquiry well worth while. 
b. Conclusions 
(1) Health and number of residence studies are positively 
correlated. Therefore students in good health attend school 
longer and complete more studies in residence than do those in 
poor health. 
(2) Health and number of extra-mural studies are nega- 
tively correlated. Therefore students in poor health complete 
more hours of credit in extra-mural study than do those in good 
health. 
(3) Health and grades are significantly correlated in both 
residence and extra-mural study. So health affects achievement 
in the college just as certainly as it does in the elementary school. 
These results support conclusions reached by Dr. Jasper N. Mal- 
lory in his dissertation on Tare Retation or some Prysica Dr- 
rects TO ACHIEVEMENT IN Ton ELEMENTARY ScHOOL. : 
(4) Students with residence study only are more sensitive to 
health influence in respect to advancement and grades than are 
students with both residence and extra-mural study. 
(5) There is a slight tendency on the part of students in 
poor health to earn credit through extra-mural study. 
5. Relation of mental ability to age, advancement, grades, 
and type of study 
a. Tests used 
This topic is considered in Chapter IV, Part Two. Otis 
Tests of Mental Ability were given to 605 college students at 
Kirksville. 
b. Conclusions 
The following deductions are made: 
(1) Mental ability and age are independent. This fact 
speaks well for the Otis Tests. 
(2) Mental ability and advancement are significantly cor- 
related. ‘This fact is shown both by central tendencies and by 
coefficients of correlation. 
(3) Mental ability and residence grades are strongly corre- 
lated, and the correlation increases sharply as we pass from the 
residence-extra-mural group, through the group with residence 
study only, to the entering freshman group. Accordingly the 
correlation increases as age or maturity decreases. Why there 
should be so much stronger correlation between mental ability 
and residence grades for the young and less advanced students 
than for the older and more advanced students is a question of 
considerable moment, and is worthy of consideration in a sepa- 
rate study. 
(4) Mental ability and type of study, as represented by 
those with both residence and extra-mural study, and by those 
with residence study only, are independent, as nearly as can be
-P-A-G-E-228
  228 Tue ReLatTion or ExtRA-MURAL Stupy To 
judged. This result contradicts the view expressed by consen- 
sus of opinion in (d) section (B) of the Kirksville questionnaire, 
and also the assumption made by Mr. Klein when he says, “the 
intellectual capacity of correspondence students, when compared 
with the average college student in residence, is far higher.” 
Tests show that residence students, and extra-mural students of 
approximately the same advancement have the same mental 
ability. 
6. Factors that account for high grades 
a. Causal factors 
In Chapter V, Part Two, of this study further consideration 
is given to the relation between grades and types of study. Through 
partial correlations it is shown that age and grades, with ad- 
vancement out, and advancement and grades, with age out, are 
still significantly correlated. 
b. Conclusions 
; (1) Age and advancement are chiefly responsible for the 
fact that students with both residence and extra-mural study 
make considerably higher grades than do students with residence 
study only, though the two groups have the same mental ability 
and the residence group is favored by somewhat better health. 
(2) Age and advancement’may account in part for the fact 
that extra-mural grades are higher than residence grades, but not 
entirely, since extra-mural grades are higher than residence grades 
for the same students. 
(8) Age is chiefly responsible for the fact that graduates 
with both residence and extra-mural study make somewhat higher 
residence grades than graduates with residence study only. 
(4) There seems to be an art of making grades, The fact 
that mental ability and grades have so much higher correlation 
in the entering freshman group and in the group. having resi- 
dence study only, than in the group having both residence and 
extra-mural study, seemingly indicates that those having both 
types of study are receiving grades beyond that warranted by 
their mental ability. Is it possible that the teacher accepts matur- 
ity of manners and appearance as an index of knowledge and un- 
derstanding, and for this reason records higher grades for the ma- 
ture and self-assertive students, than for the youthful and less 
assertive ones? 
7. Relations involving number of studies, order of enrol- 
ment, and grades 
a. Sphere of study extended 
These questions were considered in Chapter VI, Part Two, of 
this study. It was previously found that extra-mural enrolments 
coming first do not exert any appreciable influence upon later resi- 
dence enrolment. It is now asked whether those students who 
have extra-mural study first, and residence study later, do not 
show more perseverance than other students and, in consequence, 
 
-P-A-G-E-229
RESIDENCE ENROLMENT AND SCHOLASTIC STANDING 229 
complete more studies in residence and in extra-mural work and 
make higher residence grades than other students do; and whether 
those students who have had both residence and extra-mural 
study do not complete more studies in residence than do those 
who have had residence study only. 
To answer these questions data from Kirksville, Warrensburg, 
Springfield, and Macomb are utilized. The conclusions reached 
are the same in all four schools. 
b. Conclusions 
In answer to the questions raised the following facts appear 
concerning extra-mural students with residence study also: 
(1) The number of extra-mural and residence studies are 
independent. 
(2) Those who begin with extra-mural study complete much 
less work in residence than do those who begin with residence 
study. They also complete much less work in residence than do 
students who have had residence study only. To begin with 
extra-mural study is to hazard the probability of doing very much 
residence study. 
(3) Those who begin with extra-mural study complete 
fewer extra-mural courses than do those who begin with residence 
study. 
(4) Those who begin with extra-mural study make lower 
residence grades than do those who begin with residence study. 
Data from Kirksville only were available in obtaining this result 
and the one which follows. 
(5) Those who have had both residence and extra-mural 
study complete slightly less work in residence than do those of 
equal advancement who have had residence study only; hence, 
extra-mural study does not increase residence attendance. 
IV. BRIEF SUMMARY OF FINDINGS 
1. Relation of extra-mural study to residence enrolment 
(1) Extra-mural study does not appreciably affect resi- 
dence enrolment." 
(a) The student who begins with extra-mural study at 
Kirksville is less likely to enroll for residence study at Kirksville 
than is a teacher selected at random from the universe of teachers 
exclusive of those with residence study at Kirksville. 
(b) In the universe of extra-mural students, with extra- 
mural study first, in the four schools studied :1¢ 
(a1) The per cent of residence enrolments for each school 
is much lower than the per cent of enrolments for high school 
graduates who prefer Kirksville.

  230 THE RELATION OF EX'TRA-MURAL STUDY TO 
(b:) The percent of residence enrolments for all extra- 
mural students, in the four schools combined, is considerably less 
than the per cent of enrolments for all high school graduates at 
Kirksville. 
(c:) The per cent of residence enrolments for all extra- 
mural students, in the four schools, is only slightly greater than 
the per cent of enrolments for the ‘No preference” group of 
high school graduates at Kirksville. 
(c) Out of 970 college graduates in the four schools studied 
11 had extra-mural study first.!7 
(d) Out of ten well defined influences leading to residence 
enrolment, consensus of opinion of spring term students and of 
summer term students respectively, places extra-mural study 
lowest and next to lowest.}8 
(2) There is close relationship between type of study and 
order of enrolment. Extension study is more closely related to 
residence study than is correspondence study.'* 
(3) The great majority of extra-mural students in the 
teachers colleges of Missouri have residence study before extra- 
mural study. This condition does not hold at Macomb, Illinois, 
where nearly all extra-mural study is extension study. In Mis- 
souri extension students begin with extra-mural study much 
oftener than correspondence students do.?° 
(4) Nearly all residence students have their first connection 
with the school through residence study.2° 
(5) The consensus of opinion based on time required of 
teacher is that 1 extension student equals about 2 residence stu- 
dents, and 1 correspondence student equals from 2 to 3 residence 
students.!

b. Relation of grades to age, and advancement” 
(1) Age and advancement are both significantly correlated 
with grades, whether residence, correspondence, or extension. 
(2) For both age and advancement this correlation is great-

for correspondence grades. 
(3) For both age and advancement the correlation with

dence study only, to the entering freshman group.

those with both residence and extra-mural study, and those with

(1) Age and advancement are chiefly responsible for the 
fact that students with both residence and extra-mural study make 
higher graces than do students with residence study only. . 
(2) Age and advancement may account in part for the 
fact that extra-mural grades are higher than residence grades, 
but not entirely, since extra-mural grades are higher than resi- 
dence grades for the same students. 
(3) Age is chiefly responsible for the fact that graduates 
with both residence and extra-mural study make somewhat higher 
residence grades than do graduates with residence study only. 
(4) There are indications of an art in making grades that 
gives rank beyond that warranted by mental ability. 
f. Relations involving number of studies, order of enrol- 
ment, and grades?” 
In the universe of extra-mural students with residence study: 
(1) The number of residence and the number of extra-mural 
studies are independent. 
(2) Those who begin with extra-mural study complete 
much less work in residence than do those who begin with resi- 
dence study. They also complete much less work in residence 
than do students with residence study only. 
(3) Those who begin with extra-mural study complete fewer 
extra-mural courses than do those who begin with residence study. 
(4) Those who begin with extra-mural study make lower 
residence grades than do those who bégin with residence study. 
(5) Those who have had both residence and extra-mural 
study complete slightly less work in residence than do those of 
equal advancement who have had residence study only. 
3. General observations 
Students who have their first connection with a college 
through extra-mural study are not likely to enroll for residence 
study. Public school teachers and high school graduates of 
northeast Missouri, both taken at large, constitute better pros- 
pective student universes than do students who begin with extra- 
mural study. There is but little doubt if a fraction of the time 
and energy spent in extra-mural instruction were spent in be- 
coming better acquainted with public school teachers, and high 
school graduates, and in earnest endeavor to act as supervisors and 
helping teachers in elementary schools and in teacher training 
high schools, that residence enrolment, advancement of educa-

tional standards, and improvement of the personnel of the teach- 
ing profession would be measurably advanced. 
It is also significant that, by every comparison, extension 
study is more closely related to residence study than is corre- 
spondence study, and that it has somewhat more influence on 
residence enrolment than has correspondence study. The ad- 
ministrator should not lose sight of the fact that temporary ex- 
pedients and diversions from regular school work do not influ- 
ence residence enrolment to any considerable extent, but that 
it is the reputation and high standing of the school that attract 
and hold students; and that day by day it is good teaching, re- 
search, writing, and productive scholarship linked with human 
sympathy and understanding that count in building a school 
to meet the growing needs and demands of the people of the whole 
state for more and better teachers. 
Thus step by step the conclusion is reached that extra-mural 
study does not lead to residence enrolment. Students who begin 
college careers through extra-mural study are unfortunate; they 
appear to be lacking in initiative, perseverance, and ambition, 
and they fail to secure adequate preparation for the teaching pro- 
fession. It seems that the great ado about ‘taking the school 
to the student who cannot go to the school” might with much 
more truth and point be put ‘taking the school to those who have 
not the will power and energy to go to the school.’ 
Extra-mural students are graded too high in extra-mural 
courses and, probably, in residence courses; and in the universe 
of extra-mural students those who begin with extra-mural study 
complete less work both in residence and in extra-mural courses, 
and also make lower residence grades than those who begin their 
college careers with residence study. Greater care is needed 
in the administration of correspondence, and extension grades. 
A full time extra-mural faculty appears to help in this respect. 
When such a faculty is not provided, doubtless frequent confer- 
ences of teachers offering extra-mural courses under the guidance 
of an extra-mural director would be helpful. 
Students in poor health do less work in residence, and more 
work in extra-mural courses than is done by students in good 
health. But as health increases the number of residence studies 
increases, and scholarship, as represented by grades, advances. 
To neglect health of students is to encourage extra-mural study 
at the expense of residence study. It is therefore essential that 
teachers colleges safeguard and improve the health of students. 
V. THE PROBLEM FOR THE ADMINISTRATOR 
1. Meeting the public need 
Without doubt competition for numbers has had great weight 
in decisions to establish extra-mural departments in teacher train- 
ing institutions. But faculties and administrators of such insti- 
tutions, at least in Missouri and Illinois, can dismiss from their 
minds, once and for all, the fanciful belief that extra-mural study
-P-A-G-E-234
    234 Tue RELATION oF EXTRA-MURAL Stupy TO 
augments residence enrolment. Acceptance of this fact leaves 
them free to determine policies and attitudes towards extra-mural 
departments and extra-mural study strictly on the basis of meet- 
ing the public need through adequate teacher training. 
At the present time tax-supported institutions are handi- 
capped by the inadequacy of appropriations to care for students 
in residence. Besides the mounting cost of extra-mural instruc- 
tion, what additional burdens shall these schools bear in extra- 
mural instruction, which is so prodigal of the teacher’s time and 
energy. It is for the administrator to decide whether energy, 
time, and money when spent in extra-mural instruction meet 
more definitely the public need than when spent in residence in- 
struction. If they do then extra-mural instruction is justified. 
2. Decision for or against extra-mural study 
In deciding this question it should be borne in mind that 
extra-mural instruction is not increasing either residence enrol- 
ment or attendance; in fact, there are some indications that it 
may even retard them slightly. It is the reputation, and high 
standing of a school that appeal to prospective students of teach- 
ers colleges today. The reputation for scholarship, and research, 
and teaching skill cannot come from a residence faculty bearing 
in general an additional extra-mural load. Many residence in- 
structors are not fitted for extra-mural instruction, and the work 
becomes drudgery and depletes their energies. An extra-mural 
department with a separate faculty would preserve the energy and 
driving power of the residence faculty. The need among faculty 
members today is leisure to further professional interests and study. 
The administrator who will furnish to faculty members according 
to their several abilities, opportunity for writing, for research, and 
for teaching skill, and then hold them accountable for results, 
will have to provide increased college facilities to accommodate 
the students who will come. 
Teachers and students alike agree that extra-mural instruc- 
tion is inferior to residence instruction.2> It is only in residence 
that teachers can secure adequate preparation. To be sure this 
preparation may be supplemented to some extent by credits earned 
in extra-mural courses. But what is to be said concerning the 
large number of students, particularly in Illinois, who complete 
extra-mural courses and never come to school for residence in- 
struction? There is a probability of bolstering up weak and 
inefficient teachers, and encouraging them to remain in the teach- 
ing profession after they have outlived their usefulness. This 
danger is surely present when ‘‘county superintendents accredit 
extra-mural courses for the renewal of certificates” and “boards 
of education in leading cities give credit for extra-mural work in the 
grading of teachers and (in the adjusting of) their salaries.’’*

Moreover, the effect of extra-mural study on the class room work 
of teachers in service has not been adequately determined. In 
light of the foregoing considerations the administrator of teacher 
training institutions must decide for or against extra-mural in- 
struction. 
3. Growth of extension study 
However, with administrators the reasons for offering extra- 
mural instruction as given in Chapter IT, Part One, may outweigh 
the disadvantages and handicaps to which reference has been 
made. It is certain that the increase in tax supported teacher 
training schools offering extra-mural courses has been rapid. 
In 1918 there were 57, and in 1922, 74 such schools. But in this 
same ‘time schools offering correspondence courses increased from 
40 to 52 whereas schools offering extensi 1 courses increased from 
32 to 60.8° Thus class extension instruction is the form of extra- 
mural instruction most often used in normal schools and teachers 
colleges, and the schools offering such courses nearly doubled in 
four years’ time. ‘This tendency is in line with the findings of 
this study which indicates in many ways that extension study is 
more closely related to residence study than is correspondence 
study. Macomb, Illinois, has accepted this view and an extension 
department of instruction has been formed where nearly all of 
the teaching is done by the director and his associates. The ex- 
tension classes are organized in centers and, with skillful teachers 
in charge, these centers may come to be utilized by “helping teach- 
ers” for supervising instruction, especially in the interest of be- 
ginning teachers. The future of extra-mural study appears to lie 
in this direction, and the policies of Macomb both as to type of 
instruction and function of faculties are worthy of consideration. 
4. Proposed plan of organization for extra-mural study in 
Missouri 
The teachers colleges of Missouri have been offering extra- 
mural courses both correspondence and extension for several 
years. The University of Missouri offers correspondence but not 
extension courses for credit. At the present time the teachers 
colleges have approximately 3200 correspondence and extension 
students, and the University has about 700 correspondence stu- 
dents.*! If it is desirable to continue such courses, it appears 
  *°Collier, The Administration of Extension Courses in State Normal 
Schools, p. 8. 
31Since this dissertation was completed the University of Missouri has 
inaugurated a plan of extension study that utilizes the services of teachers 
throughout the state. Such teachers become members of the faculty of the 
University, are to have the A. M. degree or its equivalent, and are to re- 
ceive compensation for their services. The regulation provides that credit 
is not to be granted for extension study until an equal amount of credit has 
been completed in residence. In this ruling there appears to be recognition 
of the fact that extension study alone is not sufficient inducement to bring 
students into residence. The University of Missouri Bulletin, Volume 25, 
Number 12, Extension Series, No. 37, 1924-1925, Pages 3-4.

  236 THE RELATION OF EXTRA-MURAL STUDY TO 
that some plan of cooperation between the six state institutions 
engaged in teacher training is desirable. 
The writer believes that extra-mural instruction for teachers 
in the state of Missouri should be under the direction of a single 
cooperating extra-mural faculty composed of two divisions—the 
correspondence course division, and the extension course division. 
The correspondence course division should be located at the 
University of Missouri with a director in charge, and the exten- 
sion course division should be divided into five groups with a 
director in charge of each. One group of this division should 
be at each of the five state teachers colleges. The director and 
faculty of the correspondence division, and the director and fac- 
ulty of each group of the, extension course division should be 
nominated by the president of the school they represent, and be 
members of the faculty of that school, and all salaries and ex- 
penses for carrying on the work should be borne by the school 
represented, and in turn all fees derived should go to the school 
performing the service. 
The director of the university division should be chairman of 
the whole extra-mural faculty, and he and the five directors of 
the extension groups in each teachers college, should constitute 
the cabinet of the extra-mural department. This cabinet should 
work out extra-mural curricula, make recommendations to presi- 
dents and faculties, determine fees, and prescribe rules and regu- 
lations for carrying on the work of the department. The chair- 
man of the department should be empowered to call meetings for 
studying the work and problems of extra-mural instruction. 
This plan calls for a division of labor in schools, and in facul- 
ties, and provides for specialization of effort, and coordination of 
function. It would be economical, and would conserve the 
strength and resiliency of residence faculties for teaching and re- 
search. The extension groups in some centers at least could 
organize and plan their work in such a way as to approximate 
the function of helping teacher. Through supervision and help- 
ing teacher service, extension directors and their associates 
would be brought into close relationship with young teachers, 
and with seniors in teacher training high schools, and through 
this contact instruction would be improved and considerable impe- 
tus given to residence enrolment. Some such plan as this, that 
will avoid duplication, that will relieve residence faculty members 
of a load that is impairing their efficiency, and that will discover 
promising young teachers and high school graduates and induce 
them to enroll for residence instruction, should be adopted by 
the teacher producing institutions of Missouri. If this proposed 
plan is not regarded favorably, the teachers colleges could at 
least improve conditions by turning over all correspondence work 
to the University, and then devoting their surplus energies through 
extension departments to the task of furnishing extension in- 
struction for the teachers of their respective districts.

  Resipence ENROLMENT AND ScHOLastic STANDING — 237 
Facts relative to extra-mural instruction do not warrant 
rivalries in building up competing organizations with overlapping 
functions. At the present time the teachers colleges of the state 
have large extra-mural enrolments which could be easily doubled. 
Unfortunately, however, extra-mural instruction is not leading 
to the coveted goal of residence study; and unless this goal is at- 
tained all efforts expended in extra-mural instruction are futile, 
for it is only through residence study in college or university that 
adequate preparation can be made for the teaching profession. 
Consequently, as long as extra-mural study fails to induce stu- 
dents to come to college for residence study, so long must its value 
as a teacher training agency be open to question. 
VI. FurtrHER STUDIES SUGGESTED 
The writer suggests: 
(1) That this same study be made for endowed teachers 
colleges, and endowed universities with departments of education. 
(2) That this same study be made for colleges and uni- 
versities without any regard to teacher training. 
(3) That a study be made to determine whether there is an 
art of making grades. 
(4) That a study be made to show the effect of extra-mural 
study on the class room work of public school teachers in service. . 
(5) That a study be made to evaluate extra-mural in- 
struction in terms of residence instruction. 
Questions concerning the value, and influence of extra-mural 
study have usually been answered empirically. The writer hopes 
that this study may suggest method of procedure, and stimulate 
scientific inquiry into a field of investigation that has as yet been 
scarcely touched.

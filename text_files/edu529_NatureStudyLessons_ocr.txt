PREFACE 
Tue series of nature study lessons furnished in this 
book was worked out in the class room and in out- 
door excursions with children. 
Most of the lessons are studies of plant and animal 
life as it presents itself in one locality; but the ob- 
jects studied are found in most temperate regions, 
and the lessons can bé modified to suit almost any 
region of the United States. 
The method of treatment is also somewhat fully 
indicated by questions and answers. These work 
out more fully the plan for primary grades outlined 
in the “Special Method in Elementary Science,” 
which also contains full references to the best books 
and helps for primary grades. 
Many of these lessons were originally published 
as a part of the first edition of the “Special Method 
in Elementary Science.” But the series of lessons 
is now enlarged and published separately.

  INTRODUCTION 
Tue problem of working out suitable nature study 
lessons for primary grades involves numerous diffi- 
culties, which can best be solved by enthusiastic 
teachers working with the children. It is only thus 
that the broad general requirements of elementary 
science instruction can be adapted to the immature 
minds of little children. 
In a general way it is not difficult to point out the 
requirements of this study, such as a growing in- 
terest in plants, animals, and weather conditions, and 
a closer habit of observation. 
But a selection of the common objects upon which 
to focus the observations of children and the manner 
of directing their attention to these objects call out 
the best skill of experienced teachers, 
One of the prepossessions which an adult teacher 
must get rid of in dealing with children in the midst 
of nature is the idea of system and classification in 
science. There should be no haste to reach the 
wise conclusions of the scientists. Children are more 
easily and properly absorbed in the objects and their 
surroundings, and there will be plenty of time later 
ix 
   
-P-A-G-E-10
  x INTRODUCTION 
to hunt out the deeper truths. At the same time, 
however, children should gain a positive enrichment 
of knowledge and observation and should give ex- 
pression to a definite fund of ideas and experience. 
In other words, the lessons should be fruitful in 
ideas and in the power to express them. 
It is quite evident that a teacher in nature study 
must know how to live happily and companionably 
with children among the birds, flowers, insects, and 
trees. Merely to know how to enjoy an excursion 
with children is a great thing. In addition to this, 
one must learn to concentrate the children’s thoughts 
along given lines, for a mere chasing after chance 
birds and butterflies will not answer. Having awak- - 
ened the attention and interest of children in certain 
lines, it is necessary to lead on to more definite 
observations, and, sooner or later, to get from the 
children a clear statement of facts. 
The teacher’s questions and suggestions are de- 
signed to throw the children constantly upon their 
own power to observe, to experiment, to find out. 
Self-activity and thoughtfulness may be stimulated 
at every turn, and the foundation may be laid for 
an alert and self-reliant mind. 
It is natural for children in these early years to 
observe, but the teacher should lead them to observe
-P-A-G-E-11
INTRODUCTION xi 
more closely, to inquire more definitely, and to be 
inquisitive about many important things which they 
would never think of if left to themselves. 
While no two teachers in the same or in different 
neighborhoods would select just the same series of 
topics for primary grades, there is still great advan- 
tage in trying to pick out those objects which seem 
to be best suited to younger children and to give 
them a full treatment. Again, while the treatment 
of any given topic, as the red squirrel, would not be 
the same with any two teachers, it is still helpful to 
young teachers to see how an experienced primary 
teacher has handled one of these topics. A study 
of such lessons by younger teachers need not lead 
to any slavish imitation of models, but it may give 
an insight into the spirit and method of those who 
have gained success by experience and labor.

I 
THE SHEPHERD DOG 
How many have seen a dog driving sheep? How 
did it drive them? (Trotted along behind them; if 
one lagged or went out of the way, the dog barked at 
it, or, if necessary, even snapped at it.) What do we 
call a dog that cares for sheep? 
Pupils’ aim: we shall see how shepherd dogs 
are fitted for their work of caring for sheep. 
Some of you have shepherd dogs. Do they know 
much? How do you know? (Children relate what 
they know of this variety of dogs, the teacher telling 
stories from her own experience or such as she has 
read, illustrating their sagacity.) 
When I was a little girl my father owned a shep- 
herd dog, named Prince. We were all very fond of 
him. Our home was a long, long way from any 
neighbor, and in the daytime our sheep grazed on a 
3 
 
-P-A-G-E-16
  4 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
great pasture which was as large as this whole town. 
This was a queer pasture, you will think, when I tell 
you that there was no fence at all around it; and 
“when we spoke of it we called it a prairie. Every 
morning Prince would help my father drive the sheep 
to this prairie. A place was found where the grass 
was good, and here the sheep would spend the day. 
One of their number wore a bell, and through the 
day we could hear the distant tinkle of the bell. If 
for any length of time we failed to hear it, some one 
went with Prince to the prairie to see what was the 
matter. 
At night my father would call Prince and say, 
” “Prince, bring up the sheep;” and away he would 
trot, alone, the very instant he was told to go. He 
gathered his flock together and drove them home. 
If any sheep was hurt or sick so it could not go, 
Prince, after trying to get it along, would leave it 
and drive home the others. He knew just how fast 
the sheep could go without becoming tired out, and 
no matter how many rabbits ran across his path, he 
never left the sheep to chase the rabbits, though he 
enjoyed nothing better when by himself. On reach- 
ing home, had a sheep been left behind, Prince would 
go to my father, look up into his face, bark, and start 
 
-P-A-G-E-17
  
THE SHEPHERD DOG 5 
toward the prairie. We always knew from this that 
something was wrong, so my father would follow 
Prince and get the poor sheep home. 
Our cattle were kept in a fenced pasture. One 
Sunday, on returning from church, we saw that some 
strange cattle had broken into this pasture and were 
grazing with our own. The gate of the pasture was 
opened and Prince told to “drive them vut.” He 
knew our own cattle well, and we all watched him as 
he went into the herd, picked out one by one the 
strange cattle, and drove them to the gate. 
How do you think Prince could tell which cattle 
were not our own? (He had sharp eyes.) Have 
the shepherd dogs that you know sharp eyes? Why 
do you think so? Of what color are their eyes? 
Do all the dogs which you know have eyes of this 
color? Do the little puppies have brown eyes? Are 
the shepherd dog’s eyes larger or smaller than your 
own? Of the same shape? Are they in the same 
part of the face as your own? Tell what you 
have learned about the shepherd dog’s eyes. 
But when Prince started out for the sheep, was it~ 
his eyes that told him where they were? (No, he 
could not see them.) How did he know where they 
were? (He might have heard the bell.) Could he 
 
-P-A-G-E-18
  6 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
hear well, do you think? Do your dogs hear well? 
(Children relate their experiences.) What does your 
dog do first when you call him? (Pricks up his ears.) 
Why? (So that he may catch all of the sound that 
he can.) Can you prick up your ears? (Our ears 
stand out so that we can catch the sound easily with- 
out moving them.) Where does the sound which the 
dog catches go? (Through the openings in the side 
of his head.) Did you ever look into these open- 
ings? What is to hinder flies, bugs, dust, etc., from 
going far into them? (Shepherd dogs’ ears droop 
over these openings, and hair covers them largely.) 
How is it with your ears? What keeps insects out? 
Where on the dog’s head do you find his ears? Are 
they higher up or lower down than our own? How 
many ears has he? Why does he need two? 
Tell now all you can about a shepherd dog’s ears. 
But Prince sometimes could neither see nor hear 
the sheep, yet he started off in the right direction. 
How did he know where to go? He might have 
remembered. But if he had not remembered, quite 
likely he could have found them. Have you ever 
seen a dog that was lost from his master? What 
did he do? (Put his nose down close to the ground.) 
Why? (To scent the tracks of his master.) Can
-P-A-G-E-19
  THE SHEPHERD DOG 7 
your shepherd dog smell well? What about the 
nose would make you think that he can smell well? 
(Yes, it is long, and pointed, and has large holes.) 
We call these holes nostrils. 
Now, tell how a shepherd dog might find the 
sheep when he could neither see nor hear them. 
Prince had to go for the sheep in rainy as well as 
in pleasant weather. He had no rubber coat or 
umbrella. How did he keep off the rain? (He had 
a good hair coat.) Why do you call it a good coat? 
(Shepherd dogs have thick hair all over the body.) 
What did he do with his coat in pleasant weather? 
Of what use was it to him then? (Kept him warm.) 
Did he wear such a coat in summer? Why? (To 
help keep bugs, flies, etc., from biting him.) Is not 
the winter coat too thick for summer? What is done 
about it? How do you know? (We do not like to 
handle the dog or have him in the house in the 
spring and summer when he is shedding his coat.) 
Is the hair next the body like that on the outside? 
Do you think this is well for the dog? Is a shepherd 
dog’s hair the same length all over his body? Why 
shorter on the legs? Why on the face? Are there 
any bare places on his face? Do the flies ever 
bother him here? How does he get them off?  
-P-A-G-E-20
  8 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
(Shakes his head or brushes them off with his paw. 
Sometimes he sleeps with his paw over the end of 
his nose.) 
No matter how fast Prince ran, his coat never 
looked wet with sweat. Did you ever think of it— 
that your dogs do not sweat as do horses, or as you 
do? How do you think Prince showed that he was 
very warm? (He hung out his tongue; something 
that looked like water ran off from it.) Do you 
suppose that this cooled him off? Put your fingers 
into your mouth, then hold them up in the air a 
minute. What happens? (They get cold.) What 
happens when the wind blows on the dog’s wet 
tongue? (It cools him.) 
What is the color of the coat of a shepherd dog? 
Prince’s coat was black, with a white collar, a white 
star in his forehead, and white toes. 
You may tell, now, all you can about a shepherd 
dog’s coat. 
The road over which Prince went was a rough 
one; quite stony, too, in one place. Why did not 
his feet become sore? Notice whether the bottoms 
of his feet touch the ground as do yours when 
you walk. [Have a shepherd dog in the class if 
possible; if not, another dog will do.] What part  
-P-A-G-E-21
THE SHEPHERD DOG 9 
touches the ground? (Only his toes and the ball 
of his foot.) On how many toes does he walk? 
Look at the dog’s foot. Picture one of the front 
feet, also one of the hind feet. Has the dog a toe 
answering to your thumb? Point to it. One 
answering to your big toe? Point to it. “Where 
are his heels? Feel of them. Some child, quite 
likely, may have on low shoes. Call attention to 
the great tendon of Achilles which lifts the heel. 
Where do we find this in the dog’s hind legs? 
Where is his heel? Look at these toes on which 
the dog walks. Feel of the part that touches the 
ground. (It is almost as tough as leather. Each 
toe and the ball of the foot has a cushion with a 
very thick cover.) Do you think that the stones 
hurt Prince? Does the dog make much noise in 
running? Why not? Listen as he runs over the 
floor. What do you hear? Now you may tell all 
you can about a shepherd dog’s feet. 
When Prince came home at night we used to pet 
him. In what way, do you think? Do you think 
he liked to be petted? How would he show that 
he liked it? What was he telling us? 
In what other way do you think we showed that 
we cared for Prince? (Gave him a good dinner.) 
 
-P-A-G-E-22
  10 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
What do dogs like best to eat? How do they eat 
the meat? (Swallow large pieces without chewing. 
They sometimes hold the meat down with their front 
feet, or hands, while they pull off pieces of it.) 
What part that we never eat do they eat? (Bones.) 
[Bring a gentle dog to the class and examine its 
teeth.] What are these long, sharp teeth for? Have 
you such teeth? Show me that you have. Are they 
longer or shorter than those of the dog? What are 
these smaller front teeth of the dog for? How 
many? Have you such teeth? Where? With what 
teeth does the dog chew the bones? Are they good 
teeth for that? What do dogs do with bones left 
from a meal? (Bury them.) Why? Where? How 
do they make the hole in which to bury them? 
Which claws do they use? What kind of claws 
does a dog need to dig with? (Strong claws.) 
Why? (So they will not break.) What shape 
must they be? Look at the shepherd dog’s claws 
and find if they are strong and slightly curved. 
How does he cover the hole? Notice carefully. 
How get the bones from the hole? 
We also set a pan of water where Prince could 
get it. How did he drink it? Watch your dogs 
drink water and tell just how they do it. Do
-P-A-G-E-23
THE SHEPHERD DOG Ir 
dogs drink much water? How much at a time? 
Sometimes they suffer because their masters forget 
that they need water. 
Not long after Prince had had his dinner he went 
to bed. What kind of bed does a dog like? Did 
you ever watch a dog lie down in his bed? What 
does it do? Children report later, if not ready now. 
Did you ever hear a dog talk? Prince was a good 
talker, after his fashion, and we could understand 
what he meant, usually. In what ways do you think 
he talked? ((@) He growled when he did not like 
what he saw or heard. (6) He barked hard and 
long when he wished to drive animals away. (c) He 
barked short, happy barks when he was glad to see 
us. (d@) He whined when not allowed to follow us 
into the house. (¢) He snarled at any one who tried 
to get his food away from him, or at a tramp. 
(7) He howled when left at home alone. (g) He 
yelped when he was hurt.) 
He had a way of talking, also, without making a 
sound. How was that? (By moving his tail.) What 
did his tail tell? (When he wagged his tail, it told 
us that he was pleased, or that he thought we were 
going to give him something that he liked. Dogs 
wag their tails just before they “speak.” When he
-P-A-G-E-24
I2 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
was frightened, or ashamed, he carried his tail down 
between his legs.) 
The children might review the whole subject of 
shepherd dogs by going with Prince after the 
sheep. 
Do you think shepherd dogs are useful? What 
have we found that they can do? What other help- 
ful things have you seen them do? 
Other species of dogs familiar to the children may 
be studied by comparison with the above, thus : — 
What other kind of dogs do you know? One 
has a rat-terrier. How many have seen one? 
(Probably all.) How does a rat-terrier help us? 
(Catches rats.) How is it that he can catch rats 
better than a shepherd dog can? (a) He is much 
smaller. How does this help him? (He can go 
under piles of rubbish and into holes where a 
shepherd dog could not go.) (6) He is quicker in 
his movements. How does this help? (A rat runs 
fast. A dog must be very quick to catch it.) 
(c) His cutting and biting teeth are smaller and 
sharper than those of a shepherd dog. (d) His hair 
is straight, short, and stiff, and lies down close to his 
body, so he can more easily get into holes than the 
shepherd dog with his long, thick, curly hair.

How true a friend is adog? Tell what you know 
about this. 
What do you think of him as a playfellow? Tell 
what he plays. Tell how little puppies play. 
Tell other things that you like about a dog. 
II 
THE CAT 
We have talked of the usefulness of the dog. 
What other animal that lives about the house is 
useful? Of what use is the cat? Let us see how 
it is fitted for catching mice. 
How does the cat know that a mouse is about? 
(Quite likely it hears it gnawing.) How does the 
cat show that it is listening? [If the children have 
not noticed how the cat shows attention, have a cat 
in the class. A child scratches, not very loud, on the 
wall. Notice the effect on the cat.] How does it 
hold its ears? Its head? How does it show that it 
knows from what direction the sound comes? What 
does it do if the scratching continues? Notice its 
eyes. How do they look? Is the pupil —the black 
part in the center—large or small? Could the 
mouse, without seeing kitty, tell that she is coming
-P-A-G-E-26
  14 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
over the floor? Why not? How can she move so 
softly? Notice closely the cushions on her feet. 
Which moves the more quietly, the dog or the cat? 
Why cannot the dog move over the floor as quietly as 
the cat? (His claws touch the floor.) When a cat 
has found the hole of a mouse, and knows the mouse 
is within, what does it do? How long do you think 
it will wait? Does it stand or sit? What have you 
noticed about its tail while it is watching for the 
mouse? How does it catch the mouse? We saw no 
claws while looking at kitty’s feet. Where were 
they? What reason can you think for kitty hav- 
ing claws that she can pull in when she chooses 
to do so? (She can walk so softly a mouse 
cannot hear her; her claws are kept from being 
broken or dulled.) What have you that corresponds 
to the cat’s claws? What care do you have to give 
your nails? Why cut them? Do kitty’s nails grow? 
What does she do to keep them from becoming too 
long? (Scratches on trees or other wood.) How 
does the shape of her claws fit her for catching and 
holding a mouse? 
Often in hunting mice cats have to go into holes. 
They have a way of telling whether or not the 
hole is too small for their bodies; what is it? (The
-P-A-G-E-27
  THE CAT 15 
whiskers extend outward a long way. Any hole 
which is so large that the whiskers do not touch 
its sides is wide enough for the body. of the cat 
to pass through.) What are the whiskers sometimes 
called? (Feelers.) Why? Notice what the cat 
does even when you touch her whiskers lightly. 
How do these feelers help her when she is moving 
about in the dark? Some people think cats can 
see well in the dark, but we are told, by people who 
should know, that this is not so, hence it is well 
that cats have feelers and hear well, if they wish 
to hunt in the night. The cat’s eyes are queer. 
Notice pussy’s eyes when the sun is shining brightly 
in her face. What are the shape and size of the 
pupil? Why does so little of it show? (The 
‘circular curtain— which gives color to the eye— 
has been drawn nearly together so as to keep 
the sun from hurting the eye.) What is the 
color of this curtain? Is it of the same color 
in all cats? Notice the shape of the pupil when it 
is nearly dark. Why is the pupil so large? (The 
curtain has opened wide, to let in much light, so 
that the cat can see well.) 
What besides mice does the cat sometimes catch? 
How can it get birds? One cat catches many birds 
 
-P-A-G-E-28
  16 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
in a season, so that people who care very much for 
birds will not have a cat about. 
What else do cats catch? (Young rabbits.) 
Where do they find these? Watch a cat as she 
hunts in a field and tell what you notice about her. 
What besides little animals does a cat find to eat 
out of doors? (Catnip and fresh grass.) How does 
she eat them? With what teeth does she nip 
them? (The small front teeth.) [Show a good 
picture of a cat’s open mouth; there is one in 
“Cats and Dogs,” by James Johonnot. Have the 
pupils notice, also, the teeth of their cats at home, 
if they have gentle cats.] Of what use are the 
long, strong teeth in the fore part of each jaw? 
We have been speaking of the food which the 
cat gets for itself. Do the pussies you love have 
to get all their food by hunting? What do you 
feed them? How do they drink milk? Watch 
your cat to see how. (It is very difficult to see just 
how the cat laps milk, she takes it up so fast.) 
What else does she lap? 
What besides milk do you feed the cat? How 
does she eat meat? Does she crush bones as 
the dog sometimes does? Notice the back teeth 
to see if they are fitted for crushing. How does
-P-A-G-E-29
THE CAT 17 
she get meat from bones? (She laps it off.) How 
can she do this? (Her tongue is rough. It has 
little hooks on it, which point backward.) What 
does the cat do if you take her meat from her? 
What does she often do to the plate after eating 
all the food from it? Look at the plate she 
has lapped. How could she get it so clean? (Her 
rough tongue makes a good dishcloth.) How does 
the cat ask for food? 
After pussy has had a good dinner, what does she 
do? (Sleeps.) Where does she like to sleep in the 
winter? (By the stove or in the sun.) How does 
she lie as she sleeps? Where is her head? Her 
tail? In the summer time where does she sleep? 
(Often in the grass in the shade of a tree.) Watch 
her when she wakens. What does she do? 
Now that pussy is well fed and wide awake she 
may like to play. What have you seen her play? 
How did she play? 
Does your cat like to stay in the house all of 
the time? How does she ask to be let out? Watch 
her as she walks off ; how does she walk? When the 
weather is cold, how is she kept warm? Examine 
this coat. Put your fingers into it. All the air in 
the coat is warm; that helps to keep the cat warm. 
c 
 
-P-A-G-E-30
  18 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
Is her coat of the same thickness in the summer? 
How do you know part of it comes out? Stroke 
pussy’s fur in the right way; how does she like it? 
How do you know? How does she like to have it 
stroked the other way? Why is it well for pussy 
that her hair extends backward and downward? (It 
sheds the rain.) When kitty gets in out of the rain, 
what does she do? Why shake herself? What 
is the color of her good coat? How does the cat 
keep it clean? Tell how she washes the top of her 
head. What other parts does she wash with her 
paws? 
Sometimes when the cat is out walking or hunting 
she gets frightened. At what, do you think? What 
does she do when a strange dog comes toward her? 
How does she climb a tree? What does the dog do? 
(Barks and puts his paws up against the tree as if he 
were going to climb it.) Why doesn’t he climb the 
tree? How long does the cat stay up the tree? 
After the dog is gone, how does the cat get down? 
Watch her and tell. Why does she have a harder 
time getting down than up? Remember the position 
and shape of her claws. If the cat cannot find a 
tree to climb and cannot get away from the dog, 
how does she defend herself? When the cat gets
-P-A-G-E-31
  THE HORSE 19 
back home, how does she ask to be let in? How 
does she show that she is glad to see you? 
We have been talking about how kitty spends the 
day. What do you do with her at night? What 
kind of bed do you give her? Where? 
You have not told about the cunning kittens. 
Why do we call them cunning? How does the 
mother feed them? How ‘keep them clean? Tell 
how they play with their mother. How do they 
play with one another? How does the mother 
carry them? 
Have a reproduction of all the children have 
learned about the cat. 
III 
THE HORSE 
We have been learning many things about some 
of our animal friends. What ones? (The dog and 
the cat.) Can you think of any other animal that 
does very much for us? (The horse.) How 
many of you have horses at home? Tell me 
some of the things your horses do for you. Tell 
of some of the heavy loads you have “seen them 
haul. Could men draw such loads? How is it, then,
-P-A-G-E-32
  20 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
that horses can pull so much? (They are very 
strong, much stronger than men.) Do they often 
appear unwilling to do such heavy work? Do they 
work very long at a time? (Nearly all day, often.) 
After you have worked a little while you become 
tired and stop to rest. Do horses ever need to rest? 
Can they stop whenever they wish? Why not? Do 
masters think about their horses becoming tired? 
(Kind masters do.) The children have probably 
noticed horses with heavy loads being stopped on the 
road that they might rest. Is there any danger of 
putting on too heavy loads? Children have no doubt 
noticed that sometimes horses have more than they 
can well draw. How do the horses show that the 
load is too heavy? (By trying very hard to pull it.) 
Must they draw the too heavy load? (Yes, unless 
the master is kind enough to take some of it off.) 
Why does not the horse refuse to draw such a load? 
His master would whip him and make him do it. 
What do you think of treating horses in that way? 
Sometimes horses refuse to try hard to pull a load. 
Have you ever seen horses refusing to go? What do 
we call this? (Balking.) Have you noticed the size 
of the horses that are kept for heavy work? (They 
are very large and have strong, heavy legs.) What
-P-A-G-E-33
  
THE HORSE 21 
other things do these horses do for us? (Draw 
plows, harrows, reapers, etc.) 
What else do horses do for us besides drawing 
heavy loads? (They take us riding in carriages, carts, 
and sleighs.) Why do you not drive cows? (They 
go too slowly.) In some places they work cows. 
Here is a picture of some oxen taking a load of chil- 
dren to a picnic. Where oxen are used, it is usually 
to draw heavy loads, not to take people out for the 
pleasure of a ride. When you are out riding, do you 
like to go fast or slowly? Do the horses that people 
drive fast look just like those they use for heavy work? 
(No, they have lighter bodies and their legs are more 
slender.) Why are such horses better for driving? 
Compare movements of the heavy Newfoundland dog 
with those of the light rat-terrier or greyhound to 
show that heavy animals are slower in their move- 
ments than the lighter ones. Does the horse seem 
to enjoy going out for a drive? How does he show 
that he enjoys it? How do horses know which way 
you wish them to turn? (If the driver wishes the 
horse to turn to the right, he pulls the right line. If 
he wishes him to turn to the left, he pulls the left 
line. When he wishes him to stop he pulls both lines 
and says “Whoa.”) How can the lines tell the horse 
 
-P-A-G-E-34
    
22 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
where and when to turn? (The lines are fastened to 
a bit in the horse’s mouth.) Of what are bits made? 
How do they look? (Children show by a drawing.) 
Afterward, if any child has never seen a bit, the 
teacher shows one, explaining how and where the 
lines are fastened. In what part of the mouth is 
the bit held? [Children observe that the horse has 
front teeth and back teeth, and that between the two 
groups of teeth there is quite a long vacant place. 
Into this the bit fits. Children show place for bit 
by diagram on the board. The teacher has a bridle 
in the class.] What is this I have here? (A bridle.) 
What are these pieces of leather for? (To hold the 
bit in place.) Notice what is fastened to the sides of 
the bridle. (Two square or oblong leather pieces.) 
Why are they there? (To keep the horse from see- 
ing many things. He might become frightened at 
some of these things.) Without these blinders, as 
these pieces are called, could the horse see things 
at either side without turning his head? How is 
that? His eyes are so placed in his head that he 
can see to the front and to the sides also. The eyes 
are far apart and are large. Would you like to have 
to look straight ahead all of the time? Can you see 
things to the right and left without turning your
-P-A-G-E-35
THE HORSE 23 
head? (Not well.) Why not? Do you suppose the 
horse likes to have his view of the sides of the road 
cut off? Some masters have their bridles made with- 
out blinders. What do you think of that? 
But horses with blinders, and horses wholly blind, 
sometimes become frightened. What could frighten 
a blind horse? (Sounds of cannon, firecrackers, 
barking of dogs, etc.) Has the horse good ears? 
Tell me how you know. On what part of his head 
does he carry his ears? What shape are they? Did 
you ever see him move his ears? How? When? 
Why? Do the horse’s ears ever lie down? When? 
You may draw the horse’s head, showing where his 
eyes and ears are. Where shall we draw the ears? 
(Standing up side by side from the top of his head.) 
Look closely at their shape. 
We all know how to guide the horse; let us see 
how he pulls a buggy or sleigh. Is it in the same 
way that you pull your hand sleds and express 
wagons? (No, we pull them with our hands. The 
horse has no hands.) No, the horse’s arms are his 
fore legs, and it cannot take hold of the buggy with 
them, but I have seen children draw sleds very much 
as your horse draws your sleigh or buggy. How is 
the horse fastened to the sleigh? [Children explain 
 
-P-A-G-E-36
  24 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
‘from observation.] The purpose is to show how the 
pulling is mostly done by the breast and shoulders. 
In the same way children sometimes, in drawing a 
loaded hand sled, have a rope fastened to the 
two sides of the round in front; this they put over 
their shoulders so that the weight rests there. Any 
who have never drawn sleds in this way are shown 
how. Do horses get tired traveling all day when the 
load is light? (Yes, if driven fast.) How do they 
show that they are tired? (Go slowly.) Then what 
does the driver often do? (Whip them to make 
them go faster.) And what do the horses do? (Go 
faster. They have to do as the driver wishes, and if 
he does not care for his team they will often have a 
hard time.) How do horses show that they have 
been driven too rapidly? (They are covered with 
sweat, even in cold weather, and they breathe fast, 
the breath coming from their great nostrils in clouds.) 
What care should they receive at the end of their 
journey when they have been so overdriven? (They 
should be wiped dry with a cloth, then covered with 
a blanket. They should not be given much water to 
drink at first, although they are thirsty, but should 
wait until they are cooled off.) 
How else besides to draw heavy loads and take
-P-A-G-E-37
  
THE HORSE 25 
you out riding are horses used? (People often ride 
on their backs.) Did you ever ride horseback? Did 
the horse walk when you were on its back? In what 
other ways do riding horses sometimes move along ? 
(Sometimes trot, or pace, or gallop.) How do the 
horses’ feet move in trotting? Children observe that 
the right fore foot and the left hind foot move 
forward together. How do the horse’s feet move in 
pacing? Children see that the two right feet are 
raised at the same time, then the two left feet. 
How do horses gallop? Children notice that the 
fore feet are lifted together, then the hind feet. 
Can you tell whether a horse is walking, trotting, 
pacing, or galloping, without seeing it at all? (Yes, 
sometimes, by hearing the sound of its feet as they 
come down on the ground.) What is it about the 
foot that makes this noise? (Its hard hoof or its 
shoe.) What is this hoof? (The horse’s toe nail.) 
Of what shape is the horse’s hoof? Does it go all 
the way around the toe? Picture its shape on the 
board. Where is the hoof the broadest? Where 
narrowest? If this hoof is the horse’s nail, on what 
does a horse stand? (On its toe nail.) What kind 
of toe nails must these be that they may hold up the 
heavy body of the horse and may stand being brought
-P-A-G-E-38
  26 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
against the hard ground or pavement? (They must 
be strong and hard.) Should you not think that 
they would wear off? Look at horses’ hoofs. (The 
lower part of some hoofs looks ragged.) Do you ever 
lose part of your nails? (Yes, mamma cuts the ends 
off.) Then do they stay short? (No, they grow out 
again.) So the horse’s hoofs or nails wear off and 
grow out again as your nails do. It is better for 
the horse to have his nails trimmed, as you have 
yours, but sometimes they are allowed to grow 
rough like those we have noticed. 
How do horses keep from slipping on ice? 
(They wear iron or steel shoes usually.) [Teacher 
has a shoe in the class.] How are these shoes put 
on to the horse? [Visit a blacksmith shop if pos- 
sible.] Does it hurt the horse to have the shoes 
nailed to his hoof? Does it hurt you to have your 
finger nails cut? Neither does it hurt the horse 
to have nails driven into his hoofs. How many 
nails are put in? How are they driven through 
the shoes? [Children notice the holes for nails, 
in the shoe.] What are these three sharp pieces — 
two at the heel and one at the toe — extending 
downward? (Calks.) What are they for? (The 
horse is so heavy that as it comes down with its
-P-A-G-E-39
  
THE HORSE 27 
weight on its shoes, these pieces cut deeply into 
the ice, keeping the horse from slipping.) When 
a horse is shod with such sharp shoes, we say he 
is rough shod. Look at the tracks of horses on the 
ice. What do you see? In the summer or during 
time of good roads, some horses wear smooth shoes, 
like this — showing one. Feel of it. We said before 
that the horse was rough shod; we might now say 
that he is how shod? (Smooth shod.) 
What else does a horse use his feet for besides 
walking, running, etc.? (He strikes with them to 
knock off flies. He kicks his enemies.) Children 
give examples. How else does he protect himself? 
(He bites.) 
We have found that horses can be driven in winter 
without danger of falling. But do they not get very 
cold without overcoats? (They have a hair coat.) 
We will call the skin an under coat. This is thick 
and warm. These coats keep the horse warm enough 
when traveling. What shall be done for horses 
when standing waiting for us? (They should be 
covered with blankets.) What protection do they 
need in cold weather, when not working or travel- 
ing? (A good warm stable, with a clean straw bed 
to lie on.)
-P-A-G-E-40
  28 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
Do the horses wear the same coat winter and sum- 
mer? (In the spring they shed their old coat and 
keep only the new one that began to grow out the 
summer before. So they are not dressed as warm 
in summer as in winter.) Children relate what they 
know of the horse shedding his coat. There is 
other hair on the horse which protects him in sum- 
mer. What is that? (His tail.) How does the 
horse use his tail in the summer? (To brush the flies 
off.) Where else is the hair long on the horse? 
(On the neck.) What do we call the long hair 
there? (A mane.) How would you like the looks 
of a horse without a mane? 
We have found that the horse does a great deal 
for us. What makes him strong and able to work? 
(Good food.) What does the horse like to get in the 
summer time? (Green grass, and he likes to be out 
in the pasture and get it for himself.) How does he 
get the grass into his mouth? (By the aid of his 
thick lips.) And how does he bite it off? Has he 
or has he not teeth in his upper jaw? Children 
observe that he has. After he has the grass bitten 
off, what does he do? (Chews it.) Notice how 
his jaws move in chewing. Up and down or 
sidewise ?
-P-A-G-E-41
THE HORSE 29 
What else do horses eat besides grass and hay? 
(Straw, fodder, oats, wheat, corn, and carrots.) How 
does the horse eat salt? How drink water? What 
other animals drink in the same way? What ones 
drink differently? Does the horse drink much? 
How much? How often should he be watered? 
(It is best to have water in the pasture so the horse 
can get it whenever he wishes.) If the horse is 
being driven, water him often. 
How does the horse let us know when he wants to 
be fed or watered? (He whinnies or neighs.) Tell 
of some other times when he whinnies. (If his mate 
is taken from the field or stable, he whinnies for it. 
That is the way, too, the mother calls her little colt. 
Horses sometimes whinny for their masters, too.) 
The teacher should insist on the children making 
the observations for themselves. 
Frequent reproductions by topics should be re- 
quired. Thus: “Tell how the horses are kept from 
slipping on the ice.” “How are they protected from 
the cold?”

THE COW 
To what animal did the old woman (in the story 
of “The Old Woman and Her Pig” ?) go last for 
help? (To the cow.) What did she want the cow 
to do for her? (Give her some milk.) But before 
the cow would give her any milk, she must do some- 
thing for the cow. What was that? (Give her some 
hay.) How much did she give her? (An armful.) 
Is an armful of hay enough to last a cow all day? 
How many of my armfuls do you think it would 
take? Why does a cow need so much to eat? (She 
is large.) As large asa shepherd dog? (Much larger. 
A shepherd dog could walk right under a good-sized 
cow.) Where do the farmers get this hay that the cow 
likes? Do the cows ever get it from the fields, them- 
selves? When? Did you ever watch a cow eating 
grass? What did she do first? (Put her head down 
to the ground.) Could you do that? (Yes, if I 
could stand as a cow stands.) Do you think so? 
How does the cow stand? On what? Its toes, as 
the dog does? (No, it stands on the xazls of its

THE cow 31 
third and fourth fingers and toes.) What do we call 
these nails of the cow? (Hoofs.) Where are the 
nails on our fingers? (On the back of the ends of 
our fingers.) Where are the nails of the cow? (Her 
nails or hoofs go all the way around.) Feel of them. 
(They are very hard and thick.) Does she need 
such hoofs? Why? Notice the shape. (They look 
like one hoof cut in two.) Because they look this 
way we say the cow has a cloven hoof. Cloven 
means cut in two, but we know that she has two nails 
or hoofs on each foot. Now you know how the cow 
stands. How is it? Does the cow find it hard to 
stand? Can she reach the grass on the ground with 
ease? How does she gather the grass? (She reaches 
out with her tongue and draws a wisp into her mouth, 
and nips it off with her teeth.) What kind of tongue 
has she? (A long, limber, rough one.) Why does 
it need to be so long? Why limber? Why rough? 
What else does she use in gathering the grass? 
(Her thick, broad lips.) [These answers should be 
the result of the child’s careful observations.] How 
does she bite off the grass? (With her front teeth.) 
Have you noticed anything strange about these front 
teeth? (The cow has no front teeth in her upper 
jaw.) How then can she bite off the grass? (The  
-P-A-G-E-44
  32 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
upper front jaw is very hard, almost as hard as a 
bone.) Does she eat rapidly? How long does she 
chew on a mouthful of grass? Does she keep on 
eating all day at this rate? (No; after a while she 
lies down, or stands and rests.) Did you ever notice 
how a cow lies down? Does she lie down as the 
dog does? What does she do first? Then what? 
If you watch her mouth while she is lying down or 
standing, if at rest, what will you find her doing? 
(Chewing her cud.) What is this cud, and where 
does it come from? I will tell you. Where does 
your food go after you swallow it? (Into the 
stomach.) Now, a cow has a very large stomach. 
The grass which she bites off she chews but a lit- 
tle, if any. She swallows it, and it goes into a 
room in this big stomach, where it soaks for a 
while. Watch a cow’s throat a little while after 
she lies down, and tell what you see. (Something 
going up her throat toward her mouth.) This 
is a little of the soaked grass going up to be well 
chewed. We now call it a cud. What becomes 
of this cud? (After it is chewed up fine, the 
cow swallows it and it goes into another part of 
this big stomach.) Then what? (Another cud goes 
up to be chewed in the same way, and soon.) Do
-P-A-G-E-45
  THE cow 33 
the cow’s jaws move as yours do’ when chewing? 
How do yours move? (The upper jaw does not 
move. The lower jaw moves chiefly up and down.) 
Do the cow’s jaws move in that way? (Her upper 
jaw does not move, but her lower jaw moves from one 
side to the other.) What does this sidewise motion 
of the lower teeth on the upper teeth do for the grass? 
(Grinds it up. It is her mill in motion.) Which 
teeth do the grinding? (The back teeth.) Let us 
see if they are good grinders. [Have jaw of cow 
if possible.] (They are broad, flat, and hard.) 
Is it a good thing that the cow can pack away her 
food, and chew it when at rest? (Yes. She can 
gather grass in the cool of the day, then lie down in 
the shade when the sun is hot, and eat it. She does 
not have to stand as much as she otherwise would, 
but can rest while eating.) 
In the winter time, what does the cow eat instead 
of grass? (Hay, straw, and fodder.) She eats these 
as she does the grass, z.e. chews them slightly, swal- 
lows, then re-chews as a cud. What besides grass, 
hay, and straw does the cow like to eat? (Corn.) 
How does she get hold of the ears of corn? How 
does she eat corn? What becomes of the cob? 
What else does the cow like? (Oats, meal, and bran.) 
D

34 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
How does she eat them? What is bran? Can you 
think of anything else we feed the cow? (Carrots, 
turnips, beets.) How does she eat them? Anything 
else? (Salt.) Do we salt the cow often? How 
does she eat it? 
Can you think of something else she would want? 
(Water.) How often should a cow be watered? 
Does she lap up the water as the dog does? How, 
then, does she drink? 
[All these answers made by the children should be 
the result of their own observations. | 
Is there anything we can do for the cow in the 
summer, besides feeding her well? (Give her a 
pasture in which there are trees or a shed to protect 
her from the hot sun.) And in the winter, what? 
(Give her good shelter from the cold and snow, and 
a good straw bed at night.) But has she not a hair 
coat to keep off the cold and snow? (This coat 
helps, but it is not thick enough to keep her warm in 
bad weather.) Is it as thick as the horse’s coat? 
Are the hairs of the same length as his? Are they 
as fine? Does she wear the same coat in summer 
and winter, or has she a lighter coat in the summer ? 
How do you know? Is her coat the same color as 
that of the horse? We do not often see the cow’s
-P-A-G-E-47
  
THE COW 35 
coat wet from sweating. When she gets warm, she 
opens her mouth, lolls out her tongue, and pants, 
much as the dog does. In the winter you can see 
the steam coming from her great nostrils. Have 
you noticed these nostrils? 
Where is the hair longest on the cow? (On end 
of tail.) What use does she make of this long brush? 
But she cannot keep the flies off her neck and 
shoulders, even with so long a brush. (She drives 
them off by tossing her head about.) How does 
she keep them off her feet and fore legs? (Stamps 
her feet.) Children speak of the trouble of milking 
cows in summer on account of flies. 
Can you think of any other way she has of driving 
away things that bother her? Does she bark or bite, 
as the dog does? (She has horns to hook with.) 
[Have a horn in the class if possible.] Can she hurt 
with such horns? (Yes, the outside is very hard, and 
they are strong and sharp-pointed.) From what part 
of the head do they grow? Is that a good place for 
them? Why do you think so? How does she use 
them? When? (Not so often to defend herself as 
to protect her calf. She is very fond of it.) Did 
you ever see her drive away dogs? How else does 
she show that she is fond of her calf? (She cries for
-P-A-G-E-48
36 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
it if it is taken away. She licks it with her tongue. 
That is the only way she has of kissing it. She 
stands still for it to get its dinner.) Do you think 
the little calf pretty? What do you like about its 
looks? (It has pretty eyes for one thing; so has its 
mother.) 
We have found many things that we can do for 
the cow, now we shall see what she does for us. 
What does she give us night and morning? How do 
we get the milk? Which gives the more, the cow 
kindly cared for, or the cow poorly housed and fed? 
For what do we use milk? Do we get cream from 
the cow? Do you see it when she is being milked? 
(No, we only see the milk.) Where do we get the 
cream? (It rises on the milk.) What is made 
from cream? (Butter.) How is butter made? [If 
possible, watch the process.] What is made from 
cream and milk? (Cheese and cottage cheese.) 
What else is cream used for? (Ice cream, etc.)

THE SHEEP 37 
Vv 
THE SHEEP 
(By CoMPARISON WITH THE Cow) 
What other animals, besides cows and calves and 
horses, have you seen grazing in pastures? (Sheep.) 
Have all seen sheep? [If any are unfamiliar with 
them, a visit should be made to one; or, better, to a 
flock. Perhaps some child may have a pet lamb, 
which, like Mary’s in the poem, might follow her 
“to school one day.” This would afford an excellent 
opportunity for close study. ] 
Watch the sheep as it eats grass. What does it 
do? How does it bite off the grass? (With its 
front teeth.) Look at these front teeth. [The chil- 
dren might do this at home and report the following 
day. They discover that the sheep has no teeth in 
the front part of its upper jaw.] What other animal 
have you found lacking teeth here? (The cow.) 
See how long the sheep chews the grass before 
swallowing. What are these sheep over here doing? 
(Lying down and chewing their cuds.) What will 
these sheep that are eating so rapidly now do by and 
by? What other animal eats grass in the same way? 
(The cow.) From what you know of the cow’s cud, 
 
-P-A-G-E-50
  38 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
tell how you think the sheep gets its cud? [Chil- 
dren review process of rumination in the cow. If 
this study is taken up in the winter time, the children 
observe the sheep eating hay instead of grass. ] 
Which eats the grass off the shorter, the cow or 
the sheep? Why can the sheep do this? 
Does the sheep eat corn in the same way that a 
cow eats it? [Children name any differences that 
they may have observed.] (A sheep nibbles off the 
kernels.) Watch it and see how it does this. What 
else does it eat? Does it eat carrots, turnips, and 
beets, as a cow eatsthem? What difference? Does 
it hold the food down with its foot, as the dog some- 
times does, when eating its food? How do sheep 
eat salt? How drink water? 
Notice how lightly the sheep step about. Let us 
look at their little feet. What do you find? (They, 
like the cow, walk on their toe nails —two on each 
foot.) 
Did you ever think how much the cow and the 
sheep are alike? They surely must be cousins. 
Name those points in which they are alike. 
(a) Both have cloven hoofs (walk on toe nails). 
(4) Both lack teeth in front part of the upper jaw. 
(¢) Both chew the cud.
-P-A-G-E-51
THE SHEEP 39 
Are they unlike in any ways? Look at the two as 
they graze side by side. How can you tell them 
apart? (The cow is much larger than the sheep. 
The sheep could run under the cow. The sheep is 
nearer the size of the shepherd dog.) 
If both were of the same size, could you tell them 
apart by their looks? (The sheep has a wool coat, 
the cow a hair coat.) Is there any other difference 
in these coats, except that one is wool and the other 
hair? (The sheep’s coat is usually white — occasion- 
ally brown; the cow’s coat may be white, red, black, 
or spotted.) Is there not still another difference 
between the sheep’s coat and that of the cow? (The 
sheep’s wool coat is much thicker than the cow’s 
hair coat.) Let us look closely at this wool coat. 
_ Have wool in the class. Each child may pick some 
to pieces and see if it is at all like the cow’s hair 
coat. (It zs hair, only the hairs are much finer than 
those of the cow, and they are wavy and seem to 
be fastened together, so that it is hard to pull them 
apart.) Stretch one of these fine hairs. What about 
its length now? (It is much longer than it looks to 
be when on the sheep.) Does the wool lie down on 
the sheep’s body in the same way that the hair lies 
down on the cow’s body?
-P-A-G-E-52
  40 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
You have said that the sheep and cow are 
unlike in size, and wear different kinds of coats. 
If the sheep were the same size as the cow and 
wore the same kind of a coat, could you tell them 
apart? (Not many sheep have horns.) Do all cows 
have horns? (Many have none.) Could you tell 
them apart by the looks of their horns? Look at 
the sheep with horns and the cow with horns and see. 
(The cow’s horns are round, quite smooth, and 
pointed. They usually start out from the head in 
opposite directions, then curve inward and forward 
so it can hook with them.) [Children show by draw- 
ing at the board.] The sheep’s horns grow back- 
ward and downward, often forming a curl. They 
are not round, and are rough. [Children draw a 
sheep’s head to show how its horns look.] Can you 
think why it is well that the sheep’s horns do not 
stand out in front of its head? (Sheep crowd close 
together in the fold at night, or when frightened, 
and sharp-pointed horns such as the cow has would 
be apt to injure other sheep.) 
How can sheep keep away their enemies with 
such horns, or no horns at all, as in most cases? 
[Children relate any experience of their own, or such 
as they have heard, of the terrible blow given by
-P-A-G-E-53
THE SHEEP 41 
a sheep with its head, butting. The large horned 
sheep are usually willing to do the fighting for a 
flock. They are no cowards. The teacher might 
relate instances showing the bravery of the rams in 
defending a flock.] Have you ever noticed a mother 
sheep when a dog came near her lamb? What did 
she do to show her anger? (Stamped her foot.) 
And if the dog came nearer, what did she do? She 
can fight to save her baby from harm, even though 
she has no horns. You may tell again of some dif- 
ference between the horns of the sheep and the cow. 
In how many points have we found the sheep 
different in looks from the cow? 
If the sheep were like the cow in size, wore the 
same kind of coat, and had the same kind of horns, 
could you still tell them apart? Look closely at 
the animals and see. (The end of a cow’s nose is 
wide and bare. Its nostrils are far apart. The 
sheep’s nose is more pointed. There is hair on 
the end of its nose, and its nostrils are quite close 
together.) 
Let us name the difference in looks between the 
sheep and the cow. (a) The sheep is smaller than 
the cow. (4) It wears a wool coat, while the cow 
wears a hair coat. (c) The sheep’s horns are differ.

THE FOX SQUIRREL 
(A WINTER Stupy) 
It is supposed that this study will be carried on 
with classes of children who have often seen this 
squirrel, and are to some extent acquainted with its 
habits. A live squirrel, if possible, will be brought 
into the class whenever facts in regard to structure 
need proof. j 
The following questions may be asked for the 
purpose of finding out how much the children already 
know about the animal: Where have you seen fox 
squirrels? How could you tell them from other 
squirrels? Their color is orange (or red) and gray. 
What have you seen themdoing? Did you ever visit
-P-A-G-E-56
44 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
at one of their homes? Where was it? How did 
you reach it? How was it furnished? 
We will see if we cannot become better acquainted 
with this lively little fellow. 
Have you seen any this winter? Was it on a very 
cold or a mild day? At what time of day? What 
was it doing? Watch closely and see if you can find 
out. Can you ever tell that a squirrel has been out, 
even though no one has seen it?) How? What 
kind of tracks does it leave in the snow? Notice 
them so carefully that you can draw them on the 
board. If you were to follow these tracks, what 
might you find? (The squirrel’s tom We will 
not disturb him, but sometime when the house is 
empty we will climb up and peep in and see if he 
has a comfortable home. The children, quite likely, 
may find the nest in a hollow of a tree. It is lined 
with leaves and moss, perhaps. How many rooms? 
(Only one—a bedroom.) Does one squirrel live 
here alone? There is a whole family of them, 
quite likely— father, mother, and two or three 
children. Perhaps you can find out how they pack 
themselves away in this snug home. Did the 
squirrels dig out this hole in the tree? Why 
do you think they did not? Why should they 
 
-P-A-G-E-57
THE FOX SQUIRREL 45 
choose such a place as this? Did you ever see 
squirrels out house hunting? Did you ever see 
them fitting up their home? How did they carry 
the leaves and moss? How many of the family 
worked? At what time of year was it? Do they 
have a door to their house? How, then, do they 
keep out the wind and the snow? Is there a 
furnace or a stove in this house? How, then, can 
they keep warm? (They wear very warm fur coats.) 
Without a squirrel, the study of this covering can 
be made from a dried pelt. Is there more than 
one coat? Notice the inner coat. It is very soft 
and compact, a dark drab next to the skin, re- 
sembling cotton batting. What does this coat do 
for the squirrel? Notice the outer coat. This coat 
is coarser and not so compact. Do the hairs stand 
straight out from the body, or do they lie down? 
What is the use of this coat? Which coat gives the 
color to the animal? Notice these long hairs in 
which the dark and light alternate. Which color 
is at the tip of the hairs? 
These are not the squirrel’s only protection from 
the cold. What besides? (He carries with him a 
beautiful fur cloak—his tail or brush — which he 
wraps about him when he lies down to sleep.) Call

attention to the richness of coloring in this cloak. 
The upper part in this specimen before me is a 
beautiful combination of black and orange, the 
orange tipping every hair—while the under part 
(which is the upper part most of the time) is a light 
orange.

We know a little about the winter life of this 
pretty squirrel. Its summer life is even more in- 
teresting. Let us find out all that we can about 
that, next term. See how early in the spring it 
begins its work and play. We will find out, if we 
can, what its summer work is, and what games it 
plays.

THE FIRST THREE MONTHS IN THE 
LIFE OF A GRAY SQUIRREL 
(SPENT IN A SCHOOLROOM) 
Our school children had the rare opportunity in 
the spring of ’97 of observing three gray squirrels, 
from the time of their birth. 
We had had the mother of. these babies for 
about six weeks, when, on Monday morning, March 
15, our janitor found in the cage five little squirrels. 
Two died shortly after birth. The little squirrels 
were perfectly naked, not a hair on the whole body. 
The bodies of the two largest were two inches 
long, the tails one and one fourth inches long, and 
the legs three fourths of an inch long. They were 
very dark red, with the heads darker than the 
body. The ears were no larger than radish or 
flax seeds. Their eyes were as large as sweet peas, 
but were closed tightly. Their toe nails were black, 
with a white tip, and were well hdeehieon 
The mother purred to them harshly. The babies 
mewed—a _ single mew at a time; their voices 
sounded like those of kittens. We saw two of them 
getting their dinner the second morning. Their 
 
-P-A-G-E-61
THE LIFE OF A GRAY SQUIRREL 49 
front feet moved in a happy way while nursing. 
We made them a nest of cotton in a box when 
they first came. Their mother tore up much paper 
and added to this nest. 
When they were a week old their bodies had 
become plumper, and they had begun to bleach 
out. We took one of the little ones from the cage. 
It squealed like a little pig,—such a big voice 
for such a tiny creature! The mother, Fanny, was 
very tame. We patted her and handled her con- 
siderably when the squirrels were a week old, with- 
out any disposition on her part to bite. 
When a week and a half old, the little ones be- 
gan to squeak like mice whenever things did not 
go to suit them in their home. Their little ears 
began to stand out. The mother, when she feared 
some one was going to hurt one of her babies, 
planted her front feet firmly upon its body. 
When three weeks old, the lids to the eyes had 
become plainly differentiated. The body had 
changed in color to a dark gray, and gray hairs 
began to show. They were thickest on the head. 
The head looked very large in proportion to the 
rest of the body. The ears were now standing out 
stiffly. Ten days previous to this the squirrels had 
E
-P-A-G-E-62
  50 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
been taken to the home of one of our teachers 
to spend the vacation. Fanny was frightened at 
being moved, and when her cage ms set down in 
the new quarters, and the box containing her little 
ones was put in, she grabbed up one little one at 
a time and lapped it. She seemed to be examin- 
ing them to see if any harm had come to them. 
At the close of the vacation they were three times 
as large, at least, as at the beginning of it. 
When three and a half weeks old the little 
squirrels had become very active. Hair covered all 
of the body excepting the belly and the inner side 
of the legs. These parts were still perfectly bare.

mother’s ear is white, theirs was gray. Their tails 
were now becoming very hairy. They still con- 
tinued to do nothing but sleep, eat, and squirm. 
They were never quiet. For two days previous to 
this time Fanny had seemed very uneasy. She 
jumped out of the nest and called her young, but 
they made no move to follow her. On this day 
she had many times taken up one of the babies in 
her mouth and lapped and handled it, especially the 
latter. We put much cotton into the cage so they 
might not suffer were she to take them from the 
box. When lifting one, she usually grasped it by 
a leg, or the skin on the back of its body — far back. 
When five weeks old the under part of the body 
and inner part of the leg were thickly covered with 
white hairs. : 
When five and a half weeks old we found each 
little squirrel with one eye partly open. With the 
two larger squirrels it was the left eye, with the 
smaller one it was the right eye. The smallest squir- 
rel was of a much lighter gray than the other two, 
and had no rusty hairs in its coat. 
On the morning following that of the above record 
we looked with expectancy for wide-open eyes, but 
only the little gray had an eye open, its right eye,

-P-A-G-E-65
  THE LIFE OF A GRAY SQUIRREL 53 
Two days later than the above record the little 
squirrels took up cracked nuts in their paws and 
nibbled them. The smallest squirrel at this time 
was the most active. On the evening of this day 
one of the little squirrels kept getting out of the 
box. Fanny was displeased. Every time it got out 
she would run after it and, grasping it by the hind 
leg, lift it into the box. At one time the little fel- 
low ran about on the floor of the cage, in a very 
animated manner. 
Five days later the little ones had begun to walk 
and run about the cage a great deal, and on this 
day, for the first time, they climbed up the sides 
of the wire cage. When walking or running they 
still seemed unsteady on their feet, and when hold- 
ing up a nut in the paws, as they did on rare 
occasions, their hind legs wabbled. On this day 
and once previously, one little fellow worked at its 
mother’s mouth— seemed to be biting her teeth. 
We examined its teeth and found them just through. 
We think it was using its mother’s teeth as a baby, 
when teething, uses an ivory ring. The mother 
was very patient and seemed to regard the opera- 
tion as perfectly proper. The little teeth were very 
tiny and very white. The little squirrels had sharp
-P-A-G-E-66
  54 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
nails. We could hardly get them off our cloth- 
ing when they had been running over us. 
One day after the above record all three little 
squirrels lay down on the bottom of the cage to- 
gether to sleep. 
When eight weeks old their tails were beautiful 
and they curled them gracefully over their backs. 
They had by this time become very nimble. They 
would take away Fanny’s nuts when she was nib- 
bling them. Fanny stored away in the box large 
quantities of nuts, never putting two in the same 
spot. She covered them by scratching anything 
over them that happened to be handy, even though 
it were one of the little squirrels. 
Two days later one squirrel would lie on its 
back, kick up its legs, and grab another squirrel, 
when a skirmish would follow. They continued 
to steal the nuts from Fanny’s mouth. They were 
now beginning to eat nuts, kernels of corn, and 
clover. One lay down and gnawed a kernel of 
corn as a dog gnaws a bone. 
When nine and a half weeks old the little ones 
teased Fanny when eating so much that she hung 
by her toes from the side of the cage near the 
top, to crack nuts. The tails of the babies were
-P-A-G-E-67
THE LIFE OF A GRAY SQUIRREL 55 
now longer than their bodies. The little ones were 
becoming hearty eaters, their favorite food being 
hickory nuts. On this day I wore a snowball. 
Fanny came to the side of the cage and nibbled 
at the snowball. When I took it off and gave it 
to her, she ate more than half of it. 
One day later than the above Fanny and her 
babies quarreled. She was tired of having them 
boss her about, and refused to submit. 
When ten and a half weeks old Fanny still 
washed her babies, lapping them with her tongue. 
She still suckled them, though a few times she 
had resisted their demands for food. They now 
looked to be almost as large as the mother. The 
smallest one was a downright wicked tease. It 
made a practice of skipping up behind one of the 
others and biting it, stealing the food of the others, 
biting them when they wished to eat, and the like. 
Finally we had to take the little hector out of the 
cage and give him a cage to himself. 
About a week after this one of the squirrels which 
remained in the cage died. We know no cause for 
its death. We took the other little squirrel from 
the mother, as she had been taking its choice morsels 
of food from it. We kept it out only three days, as
-P-A-G-E-68
  56 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
it grieved greatly for itsmother. The evening after 
we put it back it had a hard spasm. Fearing that 
the room was too warm and sunny, we sent all 
to the basement in another building. Here they 
were given much freedom and throve well. This 
was near the end of the term. The children had 
watched closely and noted with greatest interest 
all the changes here recorded, and they loved the 
little squirrels and Fanny very much. They re- 
lated to the teacher in their nature study class 
what they had observed. If any difference of 
opinion existed, it was settled by closer observation. 
VIII 
OUR MOUSE, JIM 
The following are some observations made, in the 
schoolroom, of our mouse, Jim. 
Jim was not a handsome mouse. He was gray, 
with the under parts somewhat lighter. Our jani- 
tor caught him for us in a trap—one of the kind 
that preserves the specimen alive and unmuti- 
lated. Before he arrived we had made ready for 
him a cage. It was made of woven wire, and was 
about a foot square. It had a wooden bottom,
-P-A-G-E-69
  OUR MOUSE, JIM 57 
which the mouse never saw fit to gnaw through. 
There was a wire handle at the top, and a wire 
door in one side, near the bottom. This door was 
of such a size that the top of a glass fruit jar ex- 
actly fitted into it. The cost of the cage was fifty 
cents. A tinner made it for us. 
As often as the cage needed cleaning, Jim was 
tempted by some dainty to go into a two-quart 
jar whose mouth had been put into the door of 
the cage. Once in there, the top of the jar was 
put on lightly, and the cage was cleaned. Jim, 
almost without fail, gave himself a thorough clean- 
ing while in this jar. Standing on his hind paws, 
he lapped his little pink hands, and then proceeded, 
much as a cat does, to clean very carefully all 
parts of his body, his hands returning to his mouth 
frequently. 
In the meantime the cage had been washed out 
thoroughly and dried, and a double piece of paper 
a foot wide but several inches longer was put into 
the cage, so that one side folded over, forming a 
roof for a retiring room. Jim had asked for this 
room in this way: At first we cut the paper a 
foot square. Jim would invariably push up one 
side of the paper and go under it when he wished 
 
-P-A-G-E-70
  58 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
to sleep or meditate. By lengthening the paper 
we saved him this trouble. He had not ceased to 
be wary, although he knew us well, for he always 
cut out a little window in this private office of his, 
and slept with his head in such a position that he 
could look out of this window. 
How happy he was to get back into his clean 
cage! He would run up one side, throw his head 
far back, and turn a somersault, landing on his feet 
at the bottom of the cage. This was his favorite 
pastime. His movements were so rapid, when he 
was fairly started, that it was impossible to tell how 
he moved. 
The children at school were glad to furnish food 
to the little fellow for the pleasure of seeing him 
eat. His mouth was hid from sight. If a grain 
of field corn were given him, he picked it up in his 
front paws, standing on his hind legs, exactly as 
does a squirrel when eating a nut. He first pulled 
off with his teeth the thin husk on the outside of 
the grain, dropped it, and, beginning at the crown, ate 
downward toward the heart of the kernel for some 
distance; then he turned it and ate toward the heart 
from the opposite side, until one part dropped. The 
remaining part he ate from the outside inward, nib-
-P-A-G-E-71
OUR MOUSE, JIM 59 
bling little bites, or sometimes taking larger bites and 
chewing them. When the one part was eaten, he 
scurried around, hunting the other portion, which 
he ate in the same way. If he had an abundance 
of corn, he would eat the crown out of several 
kernels, instead of eating an entire one. When 
a kernel of rice popcorn was given him, instead 
of beginning at the crown to nibble (the crown is 
very hard), he began at the softer base. 
We expected him to go into raptures over his 
first bit of cheese, this being considered a mouse’s 
great luxury, but he disappointed us. He nibbled 
a little from it occasionally, but in a half-hearted 
way. 
He was very fond of cake. One could almost 
hear him smack his jaws in satisfaction when he 
got hold of a piece. He would hold it up in his 
paws, if not too heavy, and eat it in much the same 
way that he ate the corn. If the piece were too 
large, he put his head down to it, using his paws 
in turning it. His hands seemed as necessary to 
him, for feeding himself, as do ours. We never 
saw him eat anything without bringing them into 
use to hold the food in a good position for nibbling. 
We watered Jim in a little glass salt cellar. He 
 
-P-A-G-E-72
60 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
cared for water at least once a day. Sometimes 
he would drink oftener. When the water was put 
into the cage he would run to it, put his two front 
feet on the side of the dish, and lap up rapidly 
from the center. Occasionally we gave him milk. 
This he would sometimes lap from the center, at 
other times from the edge of the dish only. 
His hand was very delicate. There were four 
slender fingers on a level, and a thumb higher up, 
as in our own hand. The foot had but four toes, 
the use of the toes being less varied than that of 
the fingers. 
While we do not doubt that his prominent nose 
served a good purpose, we were not able to demon- 
strate to our satisfaction that he has the keen scent 
accorded him by some. 
His little black eyes seemed to see in every direc- 
tion at once, and his thin papery ears caught the 
slightest sound. His whole attitude was one of 
alertness. A cat that could surprise one such little 
fellow must be very quick-witted as well as quick- 
motioned. 
So far as we could discover, his tail was a useless 
appendage — not even ornamental, we should say; 
but Jim seemed very proud of it. He washed it
-P-A-G-E-73
  THE RABBIT 61 
with great care, and laid it out in a graceful curve, 
when resting. We think he would look quite in- 
artistic, however, without this three-inch measure, 
and were it covered with hair, forming a beautiful 
brush like that of the squirrel, probably not a mouse 
would be making history to-day. 
IX 
THE RABBIT (Common Hare) 
The purpose of the first recitation is to find out 
what the children know about the subject. 
Did you see some little tracks in the snow this 
morning as you came to school? What made them? 
(Dogs or cats.) Did you see any others smaller 
than these? What had made them? (Rabbits.) 
Show me on the board just how these tracks looked. 
If the children cannot do this, ask them to notice 
closely and draw a picture of them on paper and 
bring to class next day. When do you think the 
rabbit made them? (At night, perhaps.) Why 
was he running about at night? (To get food.) 
Why not get his food in the daytime? (He is 
afraid some enemy will see him and catch him.) 
Then the rabbit has enemies? Name some of the
-P-A-G-E-74
    62 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
enemies that you know. (Men, dogs, cats, snakes, 
hawks, owls.) To-morrow we shall see how these 
tracks of Bunny’s help some of his enemies to 
catch him. 
At the next recitation the teacher brings in a 
tame rabbit, introducing it as gray Bunny’s cousin, 
which hops just as gray Bunny does, and has ears 
and eyes much like his, except the color of the 
eyes. The teacher takes the pictures called for the 
day before. Explanations are made of how the rab- 
bit makes three tracks instead of four. The two 
front feet strike together, and the two hind feet come 
up on the sides, striking a little in front of the two 
front feet. Which feet move first, the fore or the 
hind feet? Which pair of legs help him the more 
in hopping? (Hind legs.) How are they fitted for 
helping him so much? (They are long and strong.) 
What about the front legs? (They are shorter and 
weaker.) How is it that the rabbit can get about 
so quietly? I will hold him so that you may see 
if you can find out. (The soles of his feet are cush- 
ioned and covered with hair.) Why does Bunny 
need to get about so quietly? (So his enemies 
will not hear him.) But we have found out that 
when he hops he leaves what? (Tracks.) And we 
 
-P-A-G-E-75
THE RABBIT 63 
said yesterday that some of his enemies were helped 
by these tracks to catch him. What enemies? 
(Men. They see the tracks and follow them.) 
What other enemies are guided by the tracks? 
(Dogs.) How do the tracks help them? Did you 
ever see dogs hunting rabbits? What did they 
do? (Kept noses down to ground.) What doing? 
(Smelling the tracks— “getting the scent.”) Do 
they need to see the tracks? (No.) What will 
Bunny do to get away from the dogs? How will 
he know that they are coming? (See them.) Look 
at his eyes; where are they? (On sides of head.) 
How does that help? (He can see all about with- 
out turning his head.) What does he turn? (His 
eyes, so that when he is running he can see the 
dogs back of him.) What else tells Bunny that 
the dogs are coming? (His ears.) Are they good 
ears? Give a low bark in the next room, Earl. 
What did Bunny do? (Stuck up his ears.) Why? 
(To catch the sounds.) What else do you notice 
about his ears? (He can turn them in any direc- 
tion.)¥ How will this help him? (Even if he can- 
not see the dog, he can tell from what direction he 
is coming without turning his head.) 
Now that Bunny sees or hears the dog, what will
-P-A-G-E-76
64 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
he do? (Run.) Can he go fast? How do you 
know? (Have seen him.) (Those long, strong hind 
legs help him.) How does he hold his ears when 
running? (Down and back.) Why? ( (@) So that 
they will be out of his way when running under 
fences and brush. (6) So that the air pressing 
against them will not hinder him. (c) So that he can 
hear his pursuers.) 
In what other way than by running can he get 
away from the dogs? ( (a) He may glide into a hole 
or hollow log. (4) Turn suddenly when the dog gets 
up to him. The dog cannot turn so quickly, and 
not expecting this change in affairs, loses some time, 
the rabbit improving it in getting away. (c) Crouch 
down on a log or in the bushes. His color being 
very similar to that of the log or bushes, the dog 
will sometimes give up the search after sniffing 
about for a time within a short distance of him.) 
If Bunny escapes from the dogs, he goes where? 
(To his home.) Where is it? (Near some log, 
under bushes, at foot of tree, or in the weeds.) 
What kind of a house? (A hollow in the grass or 
weeds.) Is there no roof to his house? (No.) 
Sometimes there is. What kind of a roof do you 
think it is? There is sometimes such a roof on your

   house, over the other roof. (Snow.) How did, 
get such a roof? (Remained in his hous¢; 
during a snowstorm and let the snow co 
Does snow make a good roof for him? Why do you 
have warm covers on your bed at night? (To keep 
us warm.) How does it keep you warm? Is not 
the cold air all about your bed? (The covers keep 
it out and keep the warmth in.) What does the 
snow do for Bunny? (Keeps cold air out and the 
warmth within.) How can he breathe in there? 
Did you ever breathe on the ice covering the win- 
dow, some cold morning? What did your warm 
breath do to the ice? (Melted it.) What does 
Bunny’s breath do to the snow? (Bunny’s breath 
melts the snow a little, so he can get fresh air.) 
How long will Bunny stay in his snow-covered 
home? (Till he gets hungry.) * 
Why does the hunter want to kill Bunny? ( (a) For 
food. (4) For his fur. (c) For fun. [What do you 
think of this?] (d) Because he eats the vegetables in 
summer. (¢) He girdles the farmer’s trees in winter.) 
Does it not seem that with so many enemies there 
would be no rabbits left? This would be true were 
there not so many young rabbits every year, enough 
to take the place of those killed.

We have learned something about Bunny’s ene- 
mies. Why do gardeners and fruit raisers often kill 
rabbits? (Because they eat their vegetables in the 
summer and gnaw their fruit trees in the winter.) 
Why do they gnaw the fruit trees in the winter? 
(Food is scarce then and they like the bark of trees.) 
Do they gnaw young or old trees? (Young trees, 
because they have tender bark.) What kind of teeth 
must the rabbit have to gnaw this bark? (Sharp 
teeth.) Must all the teeth be sharp? (The front 
ones, at least, must be so.) What else should be true 
of the front teeth that they may nibble off the bark? 
(They should be long.) Why? (So his gums will not 
be injured by the wood of the tree.) Something else 
must be true of his teeth, also. Think of the kind of 
food he is getting and how he is getting it. (They 
must be strong.) Let us open Bunny’s mouth — for 
tame Bunny has teeth like those of wild Bunny — 
and see if his front teeth are sharp, long, and strong. 
What do you see? (Two long, sharp, strong teeth 
in each jaw.) Here are some of Bunny’s teeth 
(taken from a skull) and here are some knives. 
Let us see if the front and back part of the teeth 
are equally hard. (The front is the harder.) As he 
nibbles the hard bark, what will become of the softer
-P-A-G-E-79
  THE RABBIT 67 
back of the tooth? (It will wear off faster than the 
front part.) What will that do for the tooth? 
(Sharpen it.) Will not the teeth finally be worn 
down to the gum? (They would, did they not keep 
growing out from the gum.) What would happen to 
Bunny did he not wear off his teeth? (They would     
                       
    
         
   keep on growing and become great tusks.) (The 
teacher might cite examples of deformity caused by 
one tooth being broken off.) Do you blame Bunny, 
then, for nibbling something hard? 
Look at Bunny’s mouth. Do you see anything 
about it that helps him in nibbling the trees? (The 
upper lip is cleft.) How does this help? (The 
lip is out of his way when nibbling, and so does not 
get hurt by rubbing against the tree.) 
After Bunny nibbles off the food, what does he do 
ith it before swallowing it? (Chews it.) With his 
harp front teeth? (No, with chewing teeth such as 
e have.) Let us see if Bunny has such teeth. 
He has.) 
Now Bunny has finished his breakfast or supper 
ff the bark of the tree. Has he harmed the tree 
uch? (Killed it if he has gnawed all the way 
round.) How is that? (The roads through which 
e sap passes from roots to leaves, and from the
-P-A-G-E-80
  68 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
leaves back to the roots, are spoiled.) [This presup- 
poses a study of the tree.] And so the fruit grower 
would like Bunny to stay away from his orchard, 
and when the weather is warm and there is plenty 
of clover and vegetables, Bunny is willing to do so. 
Has he ever been to your garden? Did you see 
him? How did you know, then, that he had been 
there? The parsley, lettuce, beets, etc., told the 
story. Does he like flowers, too? Yes, and he has 
good taste —a great liking for carnations and other 
pinks. Now this tame rabbit eats as does the wild 
one, so we will ask him to show how the gray rabbit 
eats, since we cannot catch gray Bunny eating. We 
will feed him parsley and carrot and apple. (Chil- 
dren try many different kinds of food.) 
What have we found Bunny using his front teeth| 
for? (Gnawing.) Now watch him. What does h 
do with the parsley? (Bites off a mouthful, the 
chews it.) And with the tender leaves of the beet? 
(The same.) And what does he do with the apple 
(Gnaws off a little at a time.) Then he uses his fron 
teeth for what? His back teeth for what? 
Tell me some interesting things you have learne 
about the gray rabbit. What else would you like t 
know? A study of the young will follow later.

THE CHICKEN 
In Grimm’s story of “The Street Musicians,” when 
they had stopped in the wood for the night, where 
did the rooster settle down? (In the top of a high 
tree.) How did he get up so high? (He flew to 
one of the lower branches, from there to a higher 
one, and so on.) Why do you think so? (I have 
seen chickens fly up into trees, and that is the way 
they always did.) Why doesn’t a chicken fly 
directly to the top of the tree from the ground? 
(Its wings are not strong enough to carry its heavy 
body so far without stopping to rest.) Does a chicken 
have much flying to do? When does it fly? (To and 
from its roost.) Where does it roost? Where did 
the rooster roost after his good supper in the rob- 
bers’ hut? Have you seen chickens fly at other times 
than those just spoken of? (Sometimes, when they 
cannot get through a crack, they will fly over a 
fence.) How? [Children give their observations. ] 
They usually fly to the top of the fence, light there, 
then fly down on the other side. Why do they make 
so much noise about it? (It is such hard work.)
-P-A-G-E-82
  7O NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
Do you know what is sometimes done to chickens 
to keep them from flying over fences? (Their wing 
feathers on one wing are clipped.) How does this 
hinder them from flying so high? (They cannot 
balance themselves.) How does a chicken fly? (By 
beating its wings against the air.) You can raise your 
heavy body a little way from the ground by pushing 
down on two posts driven into the ground. A bird 
has no posts to push against, but it can press against 
the air. That is always handy, too. [By the use 
of a light fan, fanning downward and outward rapidly, 
the children become conscious that there is a resist- 
ance of the air. ] 
[We do not wish to go deeply into this subject. 
Perhaps it would be wise not to touch upon it at 
all, but usually the interested children bring up 
the question and force some explanation of how 
birds fly.| The motions of the wings made by the 
chicken in flying—are they slow or rapid? In 
raising its wing why does not the air above push 
the bird back? The chicken does not raise its 
wing straight up, it cuts through the air with the 
front of the wing, — so (showing with the fan). 
You have seen the wing of a chicken on the 
dinner table and it looks much smaller than when
-P-A-G-E-83
  THE CHICKEN 71 
on the chicken. Why is that? (It has the feathers 
off.) [If possible, the teacher should have a gentle 
hen in the class, also the wing of a dressed chicken, 
and a wing with feathers upon it. Compare in 
size the two wings.| Is this hen going to fly now? 
How do you know she is not? (Her wings are 
not spread.) The teacher extends and contracts 
gently the wing of the hen a few times. Does that 
make you think of anything you sometimes see? (A 
fan.) When does the chicken close its fans? When 
it does not wish to use them in flying? Why does 
it not keep them stretched out all of the time? 
(They would be in its way.) When? Can you show 
with your arms how the hen closes her wings, or 
arms? What does she do when she wishes to fly? 
[Children relate their observations.] Show how, 
starting with your arms in the position of the closed 
wings. This will require close observation. [Call 
attention to the position of the thumb or forefinger 
in the dressed wing.] Do your arms now look like 
the chicken’s spread wing? (No, the skin that holds 
the two parts of the hen’s arm, or wing, together 
is wanting in our arm.) What, then, can you do 
with your arms that the hen cannot do with hers? 
(Stretch them out straight.) Picture on the board 
 
-P-A-G-E-84
72 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
John’s arm stretched out. Beside it picture the 
dressed wing stretched out. What is this wing 
mostly made of? (Skin and bones.) Can you think 
of any reason why it may be well that there is no 
more meat on it? (The meat would make the wing 
heavy. She would tire holding out a heavy wing in 
flying.) 
But the hen has besides the skin, bones, and mus- 
cles, what? (Feathers.) Do these help or hinder 
her flying? (She spreads out these feathers and 
strikes against much more air than the naked wing 
could press against. She could not rise at all with 
the naked wing.) Let us look at one of these large 
wing feathers and see if we think it is the kind the 
chicken needs for flying. Lift it. (It is so light 
that I cannot feel its weight.) Does the chicken 
need light feathers? Why? Is this feather straight? 
(No, it curves downward a little.) Is this well? The 
feathers hold the air under better than they would if 
they were flat. [They will notice the difference in 
pressure of a concave and a flat fan.] How many 
of these long feathers? Does it need so many? 
Pull a feather from this wing which I have here. 
[The feather comes only after hard pulling.] Is 
it well that the feathers are fastened so tightly?
-P-A-G-E-85
  THE CHICKEN 73 
Why? We will look closely at these feathers. 
This middle part is called the shaft. Each side 
is called a web. Is the web of the same width on 
both sides? (Notice how the feathers are arranged 
on the wing.) The narrow web of one covers the 
wide web of its neighbor. Only one side needs to 
be long, and the chicken wishes to have as light 
wings as possible, as we have said before. Can 
you think of any reason for having the narrow web 
over the wide one? Examine the wing. Would it do 
just as well to have the wide web over the narrow? 
Notice one little part of the web. That is called 
a barb. Separate carefully these barbs. (They 
cling closely together.) After you have separated 
them, smooth them down. What do you notice? 
(They cling as before.) Hold the feather up to the 
light as you slowly separate these barbs. What do 
you see? (Each barb has little teeth on both sides. 
These teeth fit into those of the barbs next to them.) 
Is that well for the chicken? (Yes, if the feathers 
let the air through, it would leave nothing to press 
against and the chicken could not rise.) What do 
you notice above these long feathers? Of what use 
are these feathers? Above these, what? Can you 
think how else the chicken is helped by having
-P-A-G-E-86
  74 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
feathers that shut out the air? (Its body is kept 
warmer.) How are the little chickens helped by 
such feathers? (The wings keep the cold air from 
them at night, as the hen covers the chickens with 
her wings.) 
Are all the barbs on the hen’s feathers hooked 
together? [Examine one of the small feathers. ] 
On which part of the feather are the barbs hooked 
together? (On the part that is on the outside of the 
chicken. The part that is covered is softer — more 
like down.) How are the small feathers arranged 
onthe hen? (They all point backward from the head, 
and grow one over another like the shingles on a 
house, only closer together. The barbed part is on 
the outside.) Is this well for the hen? Why? (It 
makes a very thick cover, keeping out the cold, and 
also sheds the rain quite well, the rain running off 
the end of one feather on to the next, and so on until 
it drops to the ground.) Have all the feathers some 
barbs?) Where do you find feathers without barbs? 
Notice how a hen stands in the rain. (With her tail 
drooping, as if to let the rain have a chance to run off 
by the way of her tail feathers.) In what other way 
is the chicken helped to keep dry in rainy weather ? 
Have you noticed what a hen sometimes does during
-P-A-G-E-87
  THE CHICKEN 75 
arain? (She oils her feathers so that they will shed 
the rain.) Will oil shed water? How do you know? 
[Have oiled paper in the class. Pour water on it and 
see what happens.] Where does the chicken get the 
oil? (From a little sac just above the tail.) [Show 
on dressed chicken.] Where does the oil come out? 
How does the hen get it out? (With her bill.) How 
can she reach away around there with her bill? (Her 
neck is long and limber, and she can twist it around 
easily.) How does she get the oil out? (Presses 
down on the sac with her bill, and it comes out as 
does the juice when you press on an orange in which 
you have made a hole.) How does she carry the oil 
to the feathers? With her bill? How put it on the 
feathers? (She passes each feather which she wishes 
to oil between her two mandibles.) Her bill is the 
finest comb the hen has. 
But her hair combing is no queerer than her bath. 
Did you ever see a hen bathing? No? Did you ever 
see a hen in an ash pile or in a pile of dust fluttering 
about? Just what did she do? [Children find out 
if they cannot tell.] This is her bath. Does she 
seem to enjoy it? What does she do when she is 
through her dust bath? Change her clothes? No, 
but she shakes out the dust and preens her feathers.
-P-A-G-E-88
76 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
(Smooths her old dress.) How? Does the hen 
never change her dress? Have you not seen many 
feathers lying about the henhouse? Did some- 
thing pull them out? Do they usually come out 
easily? How does this happen, then? (Little by 
little she is changing her dress. An old feather 
falls out and a new one grows in to take its place. 
Sometimes a hen loses the whole of her tail at one 
time.) When does this changing of dress happen? 
(Late in the summer.) Is this a good time? Why? 
How do the little new feathers look when they first 
come in? What do we call them? (Pinfeathers.) 
Examine these carefully if they can be found when 
this is studied. Why does the hen need to change 
her dress at all? (The feathers wear out and 
become much mussed.) Is there any order in 
shedding her coat? [When one wing feather 
comes out, its mate on the opposite side is said to 
fall out also. Watch and see if this is so.] Are 
he dresses of the little chickens like their mother’s? 
(No, the chickens are covered with down.) How 
is the down different from feathers? (Down has 
no shaft and web.) Before going farther the 
children tell what they have learned about chickens 
flying, about their wings, and about their feathers.

   THE CHICKEN 77 
Have any of the other animals that we have 
studied feather coats? What kind of coats did 
they have? (The shepherd dog, cow, cat, and 
horse have hair coats, the sheep a wool coat.) 
Where did we find the rooster in our story 
roosting at first? Where later? Where do the 
chickens that you know roost? Why should they 
leave the ground? (Sometimes the ground is cold 
and damp. When on a high roost the chickens are 
not so apt to be disturbed or killed by rats, skunks, 
dogs, etc.) How do they hold on to the roost? [If 
no one in the class can tell, the children may be 
given time to find out for themselves by watching 
the chickens at home.] (Its three front toes curve 
around the roost in front — ¢his way —(showing 
with the fingers) while its hind toe reaches around 
behind and steadies it.) But when the hen is 
asleep will she not stop holding on and fall off? 
Notice a hen as she raises her foot in. walking 
slowly. How do the toes look? They curl up very 
much as if holding to a perch. When do her toes’ 
spread out? (Only when her feet come down on 
the flat ground. At other times her feet are in a 
position to hold on to a perch. And the weight of 
her body only tightens her hold.) When the hens 
    
  
-P-A-G-E-90
   
   78 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
  are on the perch do they stand up all the time or 
do they sit? Find out. Do they close their eyes? 
At what time of day do chickens go to their 
high beds? (About as soon as the sun goes down.) 
Do we hear from them at all during the night? 
(The old rooster crows occasionally.) How early 
in the morning do chickens get up? (In the sum- 
‘mer time, as soon as it begins to be light. In the 
winter, they, like ourselves, hate to get up into the 
cold, so they stay on their beds sometimes until 
after sunrise.) Can you think of any other reason 
why they do not get up (or get down, rather) 
earlier in the winter? They have not so much work 
to do. There are no bugs or worms or vege- 
tables to which they may help themselves. What 
do they eat in the winter time? Where do they 
get it? Did you ever notice how the hen eats the 
corn? [The teacher can feed the one she has at 
school.] What did she do? (Picked up the 
kernels very fast with her bill.) What kind of a 
bill has she? (It is hard.) Is that well? Why? 
(It is strong.) Why does she need a strong bill? 
(It is pointed.) Why is this a good thing? The 
upper mandible is curved. Is it better so? Why? 
Notice how the forefinger is curved in picking up
-P-A-G-E-91
THE CHICKEN 79 
a pin from the floor. Notice the shape of the 
lower mandible. What do you think of that? The 
bill has sharp edges. Is this well? (Yes, the 
chicken can cut off pieces of leaves, grass, etc., 
very easily with such sharp knives. She can cut 
them off as fast as she can swallow them.) What 
other animals did we find swallowing food very 
rapidly? (Cow and sheep.) But was this the last 
we heard of this poorly chewed food? (No, the cows 
and sheep re-chew their grass, hay, etc., as a cud.) 
Have you ever seen chickens chewing a cud? (They 
do not.) 
Let us see if we can find why a chicken does 
not chew its food. With what do we chew our 
food? (Teeth.) What kind of teeth has the 
chicken? Very carefully open the hen’s mouth 
and the children will see that she has no teeth. 
Then why does the chicken not chew its food? 
What becomes of the corn that it takes into its 
mouth? (It swallows it.) How many have ever 
watched the dressing of a chicken? Did you see its 
crop? Feel right here on our hen. That is its crop 
that you feel. The food that it swallows goes first 
into that. I have here the crop of a chicken. We 
will open it and see what we find. [There is
-P-A-G-E-92
  
. 80 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
nothing repulsive about this to the children, as all 
have seen dressed chickens, and many have watched 
the process of preparing them for the table.] Now 
the corn, grass, etc., stay in the crop until they are 
very well soaked, then they pass on to the gizzard. 
Do you know the gizzard? It is the chicken’s 
stomach. Here is one. Feel of it. It is very thick 
and tough. We will open it carefully. [Peel so as 
to leave the inner sac intact.] What kind of coat 
is this outer coat? (Strong and thick.) We will 
open the inner coat. What do you see? (The food 
ground fine, and some pebbles.) Take hold. of this 
inner sac. (It is tough and elastic.) Where is the 
door through which the soaked corn comes into the 
stomach? When it gets inside of this mill it is 
tossed back and forth with the stones and becomes 
very fine, as yousee. From this food the chicken’s 
blood, flesh, fat, and feathers are made, and its 
muscles and bones are repaired. 
Name other things that the chicken eats in the 
' winter. And in the summer time what? Where do 
they find the bugs, spiders, etc.? How catch them? 
[Children watch chickens and see.] Where do the 
chickens find the worms? (In the ground.) How 
get them out? (With their sharp toes.) Did you

  THE CHICKEN 81 
ever see a chicken scratch for worms or seeds? 
How did it do the scratching? Then when it found 
something good to eat what did it do? (Picked it up 
quickly with its bill and swallowed it.) What 
happens when a hen with her little chickens finds 
something good? (She calls her little chickens with 
some quick clucks and lets them have what she has 
found. When ¢hey get over being hungry she feeds 
herself.) How can she see the little seeds and bugs! 
(She has bright eyes.) Where are they? Is this 
well for her? Why? 
We have spoken of the hen’s food, but not of her 
drink. What does she drink? How? (Puts her 
bill into the water and then raises her head.) Does 
her bill move when in the water? What is she 
doing? (Filling it.) Why does she raise it? (To 
let the water run down her throat.) 
How do you think the rooster that belonged to 
the band traveled? (Walked.) As we said before, 
chickens fly but little. On what do they walk? 
(Their toes.) About what other animal that walks 
on his toes have we talked? (The shepherd dog.) 
Does the rooster walk as the shepherd dog does? 
(No, it walks on the toes of two feez, the dog on the 
toes of four feet.) On how many toes does the 
      G
-P-A-G-E-94
  82 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
chicken step? (Examine tracks in snow or mud.) 
Does the hind toe help any in walking? Of what 
use is it? Are the front toes all of the same length? 
Which is the longest? Why is it well that the 
chicken has long toes? (If his toes were very short 
his body would more easily tip over. He could 
not grasp the perch well.) Are their long nails 
in the way when walking? Why not? Look 
at the base of the front toes. (A little web is 
there.) Why? What keeps their toes from being 
hurt by stones, rough dirt, stubble, etc.? (They are 
covered by tough, hard rings.) This long part from 
the toes up to the joint is the chicken’s heel. Is the 
heel naked? (No, covered by plates of tough, hard 
skin.) Have you ever seen any chickens with 
feathers on the heel and toes? Notice how tiny 
are the little chicken’s toes. Can they get about 
well? 
Did you ever call the chickens to feed them? Did 
they hear you? Then what did they do? How can 
the chickens hear when we call? Have they ears? 
Did you ever see them? [Very likely the children 
may never have thought of a chicken’s ears.] The 
teacher calls attention to the ears on the tame hen, 
or better, the children find them. Why is it well
-P-A-G-E-95
  THE CHICKEN 83 
that her ears are so small? Why do the ears need 
to be thus protected? 
It is said that the hen’s scent is good, as well as her 
hearing. How can we find out if this is so? Where 
is this hen’s nose? (The children will find its nos- 
trils, quite likely.) Are they protected? 
Now look at this hen and tell me what you “ke 
about her looks. (Her feathers are pretty.) What 
is it that you admire about her feathers? What else 
do you think is pretty about the hen? (She wears a 
pretty red comb on top of her head.) How do you 
like the looks of the little chicks? (They are cun- 
ning.) How are they dressed? (In fluffy down.) 
With their round bodies and heads, and tiny wings 
and bill, and bright little eyes, they make a beautiful 
sight. 
Where did these little chicks come from? (From 
eggs.) How do you know? Tell what care the eggs 
must have that they may hatch. (Before the chickens 
are hatched, the mother hen must sit on the eggs 
three weeks, keeping them warm all the time, or they 
are kept warm in an incubator.) How does the hen 
get food and drink? (She leaves the nest just long 
enough to get food and water.) Would you know a 
sitting hen were you to meet one? How? When
-P-A-G-E-96
  84 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
the little chicks are ready to leave the shell, who 
opens their shell door for them? (They do.) How? 
(Notice the little drill on the bill.) Do you see it on 
the bills of the older chickens? At what time of the 
year do these little chicks come into the world? (In 
warm weather, usually, in spring or summer.) Why 
not in cold weather? ¢ How do they get a living 
when young? How many little chicks has the 
mother often to scratch for? Does she complain 
about her hard work? (No, she likes it.) How does 
she call her little chicks when she finds a nice worm? 
Does she talk with them as she walks out? What 
does she say?. And how do the little chicks answer 
her? (By a happy little “peep, peep.”) But when 
one gets out of sight of its mother or gets into 
trouble? (Then it cries a loud, long, lonesome wail, 
until its mamma hears it and runs to it, or some per- 
son comes to help it. It is a good thing that a 
chicken can let us know when it is in trouble.) 
What kind of sound does the mother make when 
she sees a hawk in the sky or a snake in the grass? 
What does this sound tell the little chickens to 
do? (To hide in the grass.) Does the mother hide, 
too? (No, she is ready to fight for her babies if there 
is need of it.) How can she fight? (With her bill,
-P-A-G-E-97
  THE CHICKEN 85 
wings, and feet.) Did you ever see her fight an 
enemy? Tell about it. Teacher also relates 
instances. 
How old are the little chickens when the feathers 
begin to grow? Where do you first notice these new 
feathers growing? How big are the little roosters 
when they begin to crow? How well do they crow? 
Tell how they look when trying to crow. 
Review the life of the little chick from the time 
the hen goes on to the nest to begin her sitting, up to 
the time when the feathers begin to grow. 
How else are eggs used besides for sitting? Chil- 
dren tell of the many uses of eggs. How do we 
know that a hen has laid an egg? (She cackles.) 
Various drawings are made from time to time. 
The old hen and a little chick are represented side 
by side, showing the difference in size. 
Frequent reproductions are given by the children 
on topics assigned by the teacher, as: “Tell how the 
mother hen protects her babies;” “Tell how the hen 
cares for her feathers.”

IDENTIFICATION OF BIRDS 
The employment of games in teaching the names 
of the birds in first grade makes the recitation 
very enjoyable, gives a chance for exercising the 
little bodies, and facilitates the learning of the names 
of the common birds. A few games only will be 
suggested ; the resourceful teacher will think of many 
others. 
4 I. HUNTING BIRDS 
The colored pictures of birds with which the 
children are becoming acquainted may be placed 
about the room on the blackboard ledge. The 
children hunt birds. One is sent for a junco, another 
for a chickadee, etc. Only one trial is given any 
child. The children see who can find the most 
birds. The teacher must see to it that each child is 
called upon as many times as every other child. 
z. SIX LITTLE BIRDIES 
(In this game each child holds the small colored 
picture of the bird he represents.)

DIRECTIONS FOR PLAYING. — The teacher or one child sings 
the stanzas, the children joining in the chorus. As soon as the 
child representing the wren hears the wren’s name sung, he flies 
from the ring. If he fails to respond, he is caught, and another 
becomes the wren. 
The number playing this game need not be limited to six. 
3. THE BIRDS’? PARTY 
Several little girls have pinned upon each a tiny 
bow of ribbon, indicating the bird which she repre- 
sents; ¢g. the robin has a bow of robin-red ribbon 
pinned upon the breast, the red-winged blackbird 
 
-P-A-G-E-101
IDENTIFICATION OF BIRDS 89 
has a bow of scarlet ribbon pinned upon the 
shoulder, the bluebird has a bow of blue upon the 
back. 
A number of boys, corresponding to the number 
of girls, are sent out of the room while the girls are 
receiving their names. On their return each is 
given a name corresponding to that given to one of 
the little girls. As they stand about the room the 
teacher nods to one, and he says, “I am Sir Robin 
looking for my mate.” (As he speaks he flies about 
among the girls, looking for the one wearing the 
robin-red ribbon.) When he has found her he says 
—‘“Hasten with me (Jennie) lest we be late,” and 
they fly to a corner of the room, where they are 
received by a host and hostess who welcome them 
and give them perches (chairs or seats upon a strip 
of carpet). 
As soon as Sir Robin finds his mate, another 
starts, in like manner, looking for his mate, and so 
the game moves along rapidly. 
When all have arrived at the party, the couples 
form into line, led by the host and hostess, and fly 
airily about the room; then at a signal from the 
teacher each little bird takes his mate home, bow- 
ing to her politely as he leaves her.

THE ROBIN gi 
XII 
THE ROBIN 
NoTE TO THE TEACHER. —This study of the robin will con- 
tinue during the whole of the spring term. It is not intended 
that it should be carried on for a week or two on consecutive 
days and then dropped. The different phases in the life of the 
robin — first appearance, appearance of the females, nest building, 
incubation, flight from the nest, care of fledgelings after leaving 
the nest — will be studied as they appear in the life of the robin. 
Studies of other birds, of flowers, and of trees will be carried 
along with the study of the robin. The children will be watch- 
ing the robins every day, but only when there is something inter- 
esting to report will a recitation period, or part of a period, be 
given up to talks about it. The teacher herself must be as alert 
in observing as the children, and have as much or more to con- 
tribute to the recitation. She will give her observations 7 there 
zs time for her to talk, or if these observations will materially 
contribute to the children’s interest in the robin, but she must not 
rob the children of a chance to tell what they have seen. 
See who will be first this spring to see a robin. 
[The older children will write down the date of its 
appearance, in notebooks made by them. A page 
or more in this nature notebook is devoted to 
notes on the robin, which the children make from 
time to time as something particularly interesting 
occurs. The teacher writes the date of the robin’s 
arrival on the board for the younger children. ] 
Notice the gay dress of these robins that are the
-P-A-G-E-104
  92 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
first to come. These are the males. Describe their 
dress. What do they do on bright days? Where 
do they perch while singing? What is their song? 
Do they always sing the same song? Do they sing 
on the wing? What other sounds do they make? 
How do they call? Where do they perch when 
calling? For what are they calling? 
What do the robins do on dark, cold, or even 
snowy days? To what places do they go for shelter? 
How can you help them on such days? What will 
you feed them? (Crumbs, bits of suet, or meal 
worms.) Where will you put their food? (If pos- 
sible, out of the reach of cats. A window ledge is 
a good place.) 
You said they were calling for the females; how 
can you tell when the females arrive? (Their dress 
is not as bright as the males’ dress. They seem 
plumper.) Why is it well that they do not wear so 
bright colors as the males? (They are not so likely 
to be killed. If a female were killed, quite likely 
she would leave a nest of eggs unhatched, or helpless 
babies. Her color, being rather dull, will not attract 
so much attention while she sits on her nest.) Do 
the females sing? Do they utter any sound? What? 
Where have the robins been? When did they 
;
-P-A-G-E-105
THE ROBIN : 93 
leave here? Why? (Because they could not find 
food.) What food do they eat? (Worms, bugs, and 
other insects, grubs, berries, and early cherries.) 
Where do they find worms? How find them? (Their 
bright, round eyes see well.) What color are their 
eyes? How do they pick up the worms? (With 
their sharp pointed bills.) Have you ever seen a 
robin picking up a worm? Tell what it did. [If the 
children have not noticed how a robin gets a worm, 
set them at work observing, and ask them to relate 
their observations in the class.] What is the color 
of the robin’s bill? How do robins get about on the 
ground? Find out. (They hop sometimes, at other 
times they run.) When they want to go very fast 
which do they do—hop orrun? Do they ever walk? 
Notice how they watch for worms. Do they scratch 
for them? What do they use for pushing the dead 
leaves aside? (Their bills.) Watch them. What 
insects have you seen them eating? Where did 
they find them? Tell how they get berries from 
the bushes. How do they get cherries from the 
trees? Do they swallow them whole? How do you 
know they do not? (We find on the trees cherries 
which they have pecked.) Notice whether they eat 
good cherries or wormy ones, 
 
-P-A-G-E-106
94 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
The robins have other work to do besides getting 
food for themselves. This is the month of May —a 
busy month with robins. What are they doing? 
(Making nests.) Where do they make their nests? 
In what part of a tree? (In the crotch, or angle 
formed by two branches, usually, but sometimes out 
on the branch.) What trees do they seem to like best? 
Why build in trees? (The leaves protect the nest 
from observation. They shield it from the rain and 
from the sun and from the wind.) How high in the 
tree are the nests? Of what shape is the robin’s nest? 
Of what built? [The teacher should have several 
robins’ nests gathered in the fall, after the robins 
have flown.] The typical robin’s nest is made up of 
three parts: the outside, of weeds, roots, straw, and 
small sticks, woven together; the middle, of mud, 
held together by some fine material; the inside, of 
grass, with sometimes a few hen feathers and moss. 
Which bird made the nest? (The mother bird, or both.) 
What did the male do when the female built alone? 
(He watched the nest and sang, and sometimes went 
to meet the female, when returning with straw, etc.) 
How much did she bring at a time? (A mouthful. 
Then her mate watched her closely while she wove 
the material into the nest.) How could the mother  
-P-A-G-E-107
   THE ROBIN 95 
give the mud this shape? (She sat down on her nest 
and pressed her breast against it, —now here, now 
‘there. You could see her tail moving around in a 
circle as she molded her nest.) How did she get 
the coarse material in shape for the outside? (With 
her bill and claws. Her claws and toes are her 
hands.) [Study of these as adapted to grasping 
and holding, if the teacher has a live robin. If not, 
it is enough to know that she does use her toes for 
fingers.] How long does it take to build the nest? 
(Three or four days; sometimes less.) When the 
nest is all done, what happens? (The mother bird 
lays some eggs.) How many? (One on each day 
until from two to six are laid.) Of what size are 
the eggs? (They are about the size of some of 
the little candy Easter eggs.) Of what color? 
(Bluish green.) Is that a good color for them? 
Why? The color resembles that of the leaves of 
the tree, so the eggs are not readily noticed. 
Does anything ever disturb these eggs? (Some- 
times bluejays, crows, blackbirds, or owls go to the 
robin’s nest and steal all of the eggs.) What if the 
robins should see one of these birds near the nest? 
(They would raise a terrible cry, call their neighbors, 
and flutter about until the bird might be glad to leave.) 
    
  
-P-A-G-E-108
  96 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
Are the robins ever disturbed while on their 
nests? (Sometimes at night an owl will go to the 
nest, snatch off the mother with its bill, then eat 
up the eggs or even the baby birds.) Sometimes 
in the daytime a black snake will climb the tree, 
scare off the mother bird, then steal the eggs or 
baby birds. What do the parents do about this? 
(They fly all about the snake and try to peck it 
and drive it away, but it is not afraid of the old 
‘birds, and sometimes catches them, too.) 
Do you know of anything ‘else that steals robin’s 
eggs? (Sometimes thoughtless or cruel boys take 
them. They have not the excuse that the owl, crow, 
and snake have, for boys do not need the eggs at 
all. The robins cannot hurt the boys— defend 
their nests against them. The boys know this, so 
they take the eggs.) What do you think of that? 
What does the mother do with the eggs if they 
are spared to her? (She sits on them.) How long? 
(About twelve days.) Does she never leave the 
nest? (Only to get food and bathe. While she is 
gone, her mate sits on the nest.) Did you ever see 
a robin bathing? (A robin bathes in water every 
day.) How does it bathe? Where? [Watch and 
see.] Many people help the birds by putting fresh
-P-A-G-E-109
  
THE ROBIN 97 
water in a pan upon a post where the birds can get 
it. Why not put the water on the ground? (Cats 
might get the birds.) 
After the robin has been sitting about twelve 
days, what happens? How do the young robins 
look? (They are naked and blind, and seem to be 
nearly all mouth. When a little over a week old, 
for the first time they see their parents and brothers 
and sisters. They never know quite how ugly they 
look at first, for when they open their eyes their 
feathers have begun to grow.) What becomes of 
the eggshells after the birds are out? (The papa 
robin pushes them out of the nest with his bill, and 
he now cleans out the nest whenever it needs it.) 
How do the baby robins spend their time? (Eat- 
ing and sleeping.) What do they eat? How get 
their food? (The papa and mamma feed them.) 
Do they eat much? (They keep their parents hunt- 
ing food nearly all the time.) .How do the parents 
give the food to their children? 
Since these birds eat so much, they must grow 
very fast. Does their home grow, too? (No; so 
the house is soon too small for so many big birds.) 
What will be done about it? (The birdies will have 
to leave. When about three weeks old they bid 
H
-P-A-G-E-110
  98 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY oe 
good-by to their home.) How large are they now? 
How are they dressed? (Very much as their 
parents are dressed, only their vests are spotted 
instead of plain orange.) How will they get out 
into the world? (They must learn to fly.) Did 
you ever watch any young robins learning to fly? 
Tell what they did. How did the parents act? 
Watch for young robins learning to fly this sum. 
mer, and tell what they do. Do they learn to fly 
well? 
After the young robins have left the nest, do 
they go back at night? (They never go back. But 
they are not old enough to feed themselves. The 
parents take care of them after they leave the nest 
until they learn to take care of themselves.) Tell 
what you have noticed about the parents feeding 
these big children of theirs. 
If this was the first brood of the summer, the 
mamma bird may go to work immediately to build 
another nest and lay some more eggs. She usually 
builds this nest near the first one. Sometimes a 
mamma robin makes three nests in one summer and 
raises three families. She has little time for rest, 
aside from that spent on her nest. 
What enemies have the little birds? (The cat 
 
-P-A-G-E-111
  THE RED-HEADED WOODPECKER 99 
is one of its worst enemies.) How can kitty catch 
the birds? What other enemies? (Squirrels and 
owls carry off the helpless little birds.) What can 
you do to protect them? 
Next fall we will see how late in the season the 
robins stay with us. How long have they been with 
us already? Watch them all summer and tell in the 
fall what interesting things you have seen them do. 
XIII 
THE RED-HEADED WOODPECKER 
At the beginning of the spring term the chil- 
dren are asked to watch for red-headed woodpeck- 
ers and report the first one seen, as they notified 
us of the first appearance of the robin. To make 
sure that the children know what bird they are 
to look for, the teacher asks: “How many know 
this bird?” “Tell how it looks.” (It wears a red 
cap, a bluish black coat, with white skirts (when at 
rest), and a white vest.) The female dresses like the 
male, only her colors are not so bright, and she is 
a smaller bird. [Show a stuffed specimen or colored 
picture.] The red-headed woodpecker is late in 
coming.
-P-A-G-E-112
   I00 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
What bird have we been talking about? (The 
robin redbreast.) And what other bird have we 
been looking for? (The red-headed woodpecker.) 
How many have seen one? What was it doing? 
(Knocking on tree trunks, running up trees, or fly- 
ing.) Why were the woodpeckers knocking on the 
trees? (They were making holes through the bark.) 
Why? (To get at the grubs or insects under the 
bark.) How can a woodpecker make this hole? 
(A stuffed specimen would be of use in studying 
the bill as adapted to its work; if this cannot be 
had a good picture could be used to advantage, for 
the children’ cannot get close enough to the bird to 
examine its bill. There is a good picture in Hooker’s 
“Child’s Book of Nature,” Part II, and in “ Birds” 
there is an excellent colored picture.) (Its bill is 
long, straight, and pointed.) How much noise does 
it make knocking? How does it sound? When it 
has the hole made, how does it get the grub? 
(It thrusts out its long, narrow, pointed tongue. 
The end of its tongue is hard and has little teeth 
pointing backward in this way — showing by dia- 
gram on the board. It can run this tongue out 
far beyond the end of its bill and do it very quickly. 
When a grub is once pierced by this hook it cannot 
)     
 
-P-A-G-E-113
  
THE RED-HEADED WOODPECKER 101 
get away, for the barbs hold it on. But sometimes 
an insect is too small to be pierced in this way; 
such are caught by a sort of glue that is on the 
end of the tongue. They get stuck fast in it.) 
[If there is any danger that the children may not 
understand the latter statement, a child might take 
a little glue on his finger and notice how all small 
particles that he touches with his finger cling to it.] 
Can you tell now why this bird is called a wood- 
pecker? Does it harm the trees to be bored into in 
this way? (They do not often bore into a tree unless 
they hear a grub or bug under the bark.) What if 
these grubs were left in the tree? (They might kill 
it.) Do trees that are healthy have insects under the 
bark? (No.) What kind of trees, then, does a red- 
headed woodpecker peck? (Only those that need 
the woodpecker to take away the insects that injure 
them.) Did you ever see them peck at the bark of 
dead trees? Do you think they were there for 
insects? Strip off the bark from a dead tree and see 
if you can find insects there. 
Upon what does the woodpecker sit while break- 
ing into the grub’s house? (It does not sit at all, it 
stands up.) How can it do this? (Have stuffed 
specimen or a good picture in the class to show how 
 
-P-A-G-E-114
Pe oR re Rea ere te erm 
102 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
the toes hold it. If neither is to be had, put a 
diagram on the board.) (It has four toes, two in 
front and two behind. They have strong, sharp, 
curved claws. These claws catch into the wood 
before and behind, and hold it firmly.) Does it 
use anything but its claws? [Children find out for 
themselves.] (It has a long and very stiff tail. The 
ends of the feathers are pointed, and these are pressed 
into the wood and prop the bird up, just as this brace 
— showing one — holds this board up.) Does it seem 
afraid of falling when running up a tree? (No, it 
goes with as much ease as you run on the sidewalk.) 
Do the red-heads get insects in any other places 
than under the bark of trees? (They find them on 
the outside of the bark and on the leaves of trees, on 
the ground also.) How do you know? Where else 
do you see insects? (In the air.) Do the red-heads 
ever catch them while in the air? Watch and see. 
They catch beetles and wasps while on the wing. 
Do they eat anything except grubs and insects? 
What? (Cherries, berries, apples, and pears.) How 
do they eat them? [Children observe.] Leander 
Keyser says that they sometimes dig out holes in the 
top of posts, in dead tree trunks, or in stumps, and 
hide fruit. He saw a red-head press a berry into one
-P-A-G-E-115
  THE RED-HEADED WOODPECKER 103 
of these holes, then suck out its juice. Sometimes 
these birds catch a cherry or a berry on the fly, 
but usually they alight near enough to it to reach 
it with their bills. Do they swallow a berry whole? 
[Children find out.] Do they carry off a whole 
cherry? Find out. 
Do you know of anything else that red-heads feed 
upon? (Once in a while, but not often, you will find 
a red-head boring holes into good trees for the sap.) 
Have you noticed these holes? How did they look? 
(They often extend around the tree in a circle.) It is 
another woodpecker that does most of the sucking. 
They suck the sap out of these little wells. After a 
while the wells fill up again, when the woodpeckers 
suck them dry as before. What little insects that 
like sweets do you know? Where might they go for 
them? (To these wells.) What might happen to 
them here? (The red-heads might make a dinner 
off them.) [Dr. Lockwood thinks this is one of the 
purposes of these wells.] 
Do you think the red-headed woodpecker is a 
pretty good bird to have around? Why? (Review.) 
What is the only harm we have found this wood- 
pecker doing thus far? Ought we to welcome them 
when they come back in the spring? Why? Do they
-P-A-G-E-116
104 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
come at the same time as the robin? When did we 
hear the first robin? When the first red-headed wood- 
pecker? Could you tell that he was here without 
seeing him? (Yes, by his drumming.) How did it 
sound? (“Tap! tap! tap!” very fast, then “tap! 
tap!” very loud, with a pause between the two taps.) 
What did he use for his drum? (A dry limb or some- 
times a shingle on the house.) What did he use to beat 
the drum with? (His bill.) Does he never sing? 
(No; and he is too happy to keep still, so he beats a 
drum to make music.) Does he have but one drum? 
(Each woodpecker has a favorite place where he 
goes to drum. One spring one wakened me very 
early every morning by drumming on a shingle in 
the roof just above my head. Woodpeckers drum in 
other places, too, as they fly about getting their food.) 
Find out whether they do most of their drumming in 
the morning or in the afternoon. How early do they 
begin? When you hear one, run and ask your mamma 
what time it is. Do they drum very long at a time? 
Do they drum constantly, or stop to rest a little once 
in a while? What do they do when resting? The 
drumming seems to be a’Call to the mate. See if the 
children arrive at this conclusion by noticing that the 
bird acts as if he were listening, and later is some-
-P-A-G-E-117
THE RED-HEADED WOODPECKER 105 
times joined by the female. Does he drum at all 
when his mate is with him? (Yes, and she seems to 
think him a fine musician.) Is this the only sound 
you hear a red-headed woodpecker make? (He 
makes a shrill, lively sound, in which there is no 
music.) See if you can make it. You may tell all 
you know about the music of a red-headed wood- 
pecker. (Review.) 
Where do red-headed woodpeckers sleep at the 
end of their long, busy day? [Leave the children 
to find this out for themselves if they can. Let 
them watch near a nest if there be one near their 
home.] (They sometimes, early in the season, sleep 
in holes in trees, but Leander Keyser says that 
' they usually sleep on an upright or oblique perch, 
clinging with their stout claws, with their heads 
pillowed in the feathers on their backs.) 
After the red-headed woodpecker has called his 
mate they two go to work building a nest. Where? 
(In the trunk of a dead tree that is not too soft or in 
a branch, a fence post, or a telegraph pole. When 
made in a branch it is usually on the under side.) 
Why? How do they make it? (They cut out a round, 
smooth, straight hole right in front of them, with their 
bills. “They make it large enough around so that the
-P-A-G-E-118
  106 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
bird can go in. When the woodpecker has gone in 
five inches or so—show distance by a mark on the 
board —he begins to work downward, making the 
hole larger and larger as he goes down ten or twenty 
inches — show by line.) [If not possible for the 
children to see a nest, the teacher should give them 
a clear idea of it by a diagram on the board.] You 
have learned that the mamma robin sometimes 
builds the nest alone. Which is the harder to make, 
the robin’s nest or the red-headed woodpecker’s? 
(The red-head’s.) Will the mamma have help, do you 
think? (Yes, the papa bird does half of the work.) 
Can they work together? Why not? (The mamma 
bird often works just about as long as the time you 
spend in this class, —twenty minutes,—then she 
flies to an upper limb and calls her mate in her 
shrill voice. When he comes she seems to tell him 
how much she has: done, and they talk over their 
plans together. Then the papa bird flies to the nest 
and works about as long as the mamma worked, 
while she flies away for food and rest. Then the 
papa bird calls the mamma bird and tells her about 
his work, etc.) How do they get the chips out of 
‘ the nest? (Carry the coarse ones out with their 
bills.) How is the nest lined? (The fine wood or
-P-A-G-E-119
   THE RED-HEADED WOODPECKER 107 
sawdust falls to the bottom of the nest, and this 
forms a soft bed for the eggs.) Is this a good kind 
of nest for a bird to have? Why do you think so? 
(It is protected from the storms, and from the birds 
and animals that trouble the robin’s nest.) What 
ones? But there is one animal that troubles the 
robin’s nest, which can easily get into this nest. 
What is that? (The blacksnake.) Quite often it 
steals the woodpecker’s eggs or birds. 
Do these birds go to all this work to make a nest 
every year, or do they use the same nest year after 
year? (They make a new nest. They do not use 
a hole which they find already in a tree.) Can you 
see the eggs or the tiny woodpeckers in the nest? 
Why not? How many eggs? (Six, usually.) How 
do they look? (They are more nearly round than 
are the robin’s eggs and are larger than hers. 
They are pure white and very smooth.) How can you 
tell when there are little woodpeckers in the nest 
if you cannot see them? (If you are near the tree, 
you can hear the babies cry. They are big eaters, 
and nearly all the time they are teasing for food.) 
Who feeds them? (The mamma and papa.) What 
do they feed them? (Bugs, moths, grasshoppers, 
etc.) When they are big enough to fly about, how
-P-A-G-E-120
  108 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
can you tell them from their parents? (The first 
summer their heads are not red, but, instead, a very 
dark gray, and their wings are spotted black and 
white. The white on their breasts is not pure 
white, but dirty-looking.) 
Do these brothers and sisters have good times 
playing? (Yes, and the father and mother play, 
too.) Children watch them and tell what games 
they play. And, if you have a chance, watch one 
during a shower and see what it does. [The 
teacher should call for their observations and re- 
late her own, throughout the summer term and 
again in the fall. The children should be taught 
to be very wary in watching birds; try to keep 
out of their sight as much as possible, and keep 
quiet. ] 
What other woodpeckers have you seen? De- 
scribe them. What one is often seen on the 
ground? (The flicker.) What ones are with us 
through the winter? (The downy and the hairy 
woodpeckers.) }

THE COMMON CROW 109 
XIV 
THE COMMON CROW 
How do you keep warm this cold weather? How 
do we protect horses, cows, and sheep from the 
cold winds and the snows and sleet storms? What do 
we do for the chickens, geese, ducks, and turkeys? 
But there are some birds for which we do not 
think of providing shelter, even on the coldest 
days or in the most severe storms. What are 
they? Let us see if we can find how one of these 
birds —the crow—lives through the winter. Do 
you all know the crow? How can you tell it from 
other birds? (It is large, and has a glossy black 
coat. Its bill, legs, and toes are also black. In- 
stead of singing or chirping, it says “ Caw.”) 
What keeps this queer bird from freezing? (Its 
feather coat.) How is it adapted for keeping out 
the cold and snow and shedding the rain? How 
are the legs and toes protected when roosting? 
Where does it make its home in the winter? 
(Usually in evergreen trees.) Is this a good place? 
Why? (The thick foliage protects it from the cold 
winds and it is hidden from the view of those who 
 
-P-A-G-E-122
  IIO NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
might wish to shoot it.) Does it need ita 
besides a good coat and a sheltered home to keep 
it alive in the winter? (It must have food.) What 
does it eat? Let us watch, this winter, and see if 
we can find out for ourselves. [The teacher should 
frequently ask for the results of the children’s 
observations and give them her own, then they will 
think her questions are not idle ones. The chil- 
dren may find that it eats mice, carrion, hens’ eggs, 
corn, acorns, nuts, frozen apples from the boughs of 
trees, and the fruits of poison ivy, poison sumac 
and other sumacs, sand, and gravel. They may 
discover also that it drinks a great deal of water. 
Careful observations made by the children will 
arouse in them a more than transient interest in 
the object studied. This the teacher should work 
for constantly, and feel quite sure that her work 
amounts to but little if the children are not inter- 
ested enough to watch, outside of school, the move- 
ments of the animals studied. ] 
Let the children tell what they have observed in 
regard to the manner in which the crow catches 
and kills the mice. What does it do with the 
hens’ eggs? Where and how does it get the fruits 
of ivies and sumacs? Why eat sand and pebbles?
-P-A-G-E-123
  
THE COMMON CROW Ill 
[Recall what they discovered in the chicken’s giz- 
zard.| How is.the bill fitted for getting this kind 
of food? (It is long, pointed, hard, and strong.) 
Does it find plenty of food? Did you ever hear 
this expression, “As poor as a crow”? Many times 
crows have a hard time in the winter to find 
enough food. They become very poor and some- 
times they even starve to death. 
Can you get close enough to crows, usually, to 
tell how fast they eat? Why are they so afraid? 
Why do men and boys shoot them? Are they 
any more afraid of a man who carries a gun than 
of one without? How can crows get a chance to 
eat if they are watching for men all of the time? 
(They have sentinels out watching. These warn 
the flock of any approach of danger.) What kind 
of warning do they give? How is this warning 
received by the crows? What follows? 
What takes the crow away from danger? (Its 
strong, large wings carry it away.) Does it fly high? 
How do you know? Does flying seem to tire it? 
Study the adaptability of its wings to flight. Do 
crows fly singly or in flocks? [Children notice.] Is 
this so at all times of the year? We will notice how 
they go next spring. 
 
-P-A-G-E-124
    II2 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMA GRADES 
Have they no other way of getting about than 
by flying? (They walk on the ground.) Have you 
ever seen them walk? Were their steps long or 
short? How did they hold their bodies? Do they 
ever run? Do they hop? Why were they on the 
ground? Did you ever see a crow’s tracks in the 
mud or in the snow? How many tracks did each 
foot leave? Picture on the board. 
What is the crow’s work in the winter? Is this 
all it does the whole year through? (No, in spring 
it builds its nest.) How early? Did you ever see 
it building its nest? Have you ever seen a crow’s 
nest? Why do we so seldom see one? (They are 
built high up in trees—very often in evergreen 
trees.) 
[Have a nest in the class if possible.] This nest 
was taken from a tree after all the little crows 
were grown up. The crows never use the same 
nest for two seasons, so we know they will not 
need their old home any more. 
Of what is it built? (The outside is made of 
twigs and sticks, the inner wall of grasses, leaves, 
and bark from cedar trees or grape vines. Some 
of their nests are lined with hair.) | 
Early next spring we will begin watching the
-P-A-G-E-125
  THE SCREECH OWL X13 
crows to see if we can find in what trees they 
build their nests, and how they get the sticks, etc., 
to the trees. 
How do you know that the crows are about when 
you cannot see them? (They flap their wings 
noisily and cry “Caw! caw!”) 
Abbott says that crows have twenty-seven distinct 
cries, each of which is accompanied by a different 
act. [It would be interesting for teacher and pupils 
to observe closely and see if they notice any connec- 
tion between the movements of the crows and their 
different notes. | 
XV 
THE SCREECH OWL 
(A Winter Stupy) 
What birds have been with us all winter? Some 
of these birds are more often heard than seen; which 
are these? (The owls.) Why do we see them so 
seldom? Have you ever heard them? What sound 
did they make? (Some cry “Hoo! hoo!” others 
make a sound variously likened to “the coo of a 
dove with the sweetness left out,” “the whining of a 
puppy,” “the grating of machinery,” “the wailing 
of a little child.”) 
I 
 
-P-A-G-E-126
    114 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
We shall talk of the ones that make the wailing 
cry. On account of the unpleasant music which 
they make they have been given a name of which 
they cannot be very proud. What is it? (The 
screech owls.) { 
Have you ever seen a screech owl? What was it 
doing? What kind of looking bird was it? (Per- 
haps of a grayish color, or it may be of a rusty red 
color, with lighter and darker markings. It is from 
eight and a half to ten.inches long. The children 
show this by placing the hands so far apart.) 
At what time of day was it when you heard the 
screech owl? Was it talking in its sleep? (No, the 
night is the busy time of day for the screech owl.) 
About what is it so busy? (Getting its dinner and 
breakfast. These are such hearty meals that it 
needs no luncheon in the middle of the day.) 
What do they find to eat? (Mice, English damnit 
and other small birds, eggs of birds, frogs, small 
snakes, fish, grasshoppers, crickets, beetles, moths, 
the cockchafer so injurious to fruit trees, and cut- 
worms, which, like the owl, turn their night into day.) 
At what time did you say the screech owl catches 
the mice? (At night. Both the owl and the mouse 
like to hunt after dark.) How can the owl see the 
&
-P-A-G-E-127
THE SCREECH OWL 115 
little mouse? (It has large, bright eyes. These are 
in front of its head, so that it can fix both upon one 
object.) Study the eye. How large the pupil is! 
Why? Of what does it remind you? Notice the 
yellow curtain —iris—which surrounds this pupil. 
Only a little of it shows at night. Why not? 
Each eye is surrounded by a disk of short, stiff 
feathers. Have a screech owl in a cage in the 
class if possible. 
Let us see how screech owls catch and eat mice. 
Where do they find them? (In shocks of corn, in 
their field nests, about barns and corn cribs, running 
over the snow.) How do they catch them? (Swoop 
down upon them and grasp them with their long, 
sharp claws.) Study the very sharp, long, strong, 
curved claws on the strong flexible toes, as to their 
adaptability for catching and holding prey. Notice 
the reversible outer toe. How does the owl use it? 
We are very glad that the owl kills the little mouse 
almost instantly. 
How does it eat the mouse? (Often tosses it up 
with its bill in such a way that the head comes down 
into the owl’s mouth; then it makes one big gulp, 
but often a second is needed before the mouse is 
down, tail andall.) Are you surprised that it eats the
-P-A-G-E-128
  116 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
whole mouse? What parts should you think it might 
better have left out? (The hair, teeth, and bones.) 
Examine these little balls found at the foot of a tree 
in which an owl had a nest. [The children find here 
hair, teeth, bones, feathers, etc.] Where could these 
have come from? The owl, a few hours after eating 
a mouse or a bird, throws up one of these balls. 
Look in the owl’s cage for the balls. 
Why do not the mice get out of the owl’s way? 
(The owl makes almost no noise when flying, on 
account of the soft feathers which line the wings 
and cover the body.) Study the wings with reference 
to their fitness for noiseless flight. 
Owls often know when a mouse is near, even 
though the mouse be out of sight. How is that? 
It hears it. Where are its ears? [The children will 
call the tufts of feathers on the top of its head the 
ears. If you have a stuffed specimen, let them 
discover that there are no ears there. They will 
find large ears, covered by feathers, just outside the 
disk of feathers surrounding the eye. This is 
the only bird that has an outer ear.] Notice how 
the feathers are arranged just outside the ear. 
How does this help its hearing? Why is it well 
that the ears are covered with feathers?
-P-A-G-E-129
  THE SCREECH OWL 117 
What else does the owl eat? (Small birds. These, 
too, it kills almost immediately.) How does it catch 
them? Does it swallow them whole? (No, it tears 
them in pieces.) Do the birds know that the owl 
is their enemy? How do they treat it? (If they 
find an owl in the daytime, they make a terrible 
commotion. All the birds gather together and scream 
at it, flying as close to it as they dare. When it 
flies away they follow it, calling it hard names.) 
How does the owl catch its other food? How 
much of this food can it get in the winter? Does 
it go out hunting on the coldest nights? (In the 
warmer weather it often stores up enough food to 
last it a week or more, and mature owls often go a 
week without any food, not seeming to mind it.) 
What, besides food, does it need? (Water.) It is 
a great drinker. Owls are sometimes caught by cut- 
ting holes in the ice. They come here to drink and 
are captured, 
Is the screech owl’s coat well fitted for a bird which 
must make a living in the winter as well as in the 
cold, damp nights in warmer weather? Study care- 
fully the plumage of the owl as adapted to its protec- 
tion from cold and damp. Unlike many other birds, 
the legs are covered their whole length with feathers, 
 
-P-A-G-E-130
  118 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR eae. 
and the feathers even run down each toe. What 
care does it take of this thick, soft, light coat? (It 
bathes very frequently, and enjoys its bath greatly.) 
Where were the screech owls which you saw? 
(Peeping out from the hollow of a tree or among the 
thick foliage.) Very likely you nearly passed an owl 
without seeing it, for they keep very quiet and do 
not cry out if they see a person coming. Its color 
helps the owl to escape notice. How is this?) Why 
do its bright eyes not attract the notice of people? 
(They are nearly closed in the daytime.) 
Find out all you can about how the owl makes a 
living. 1 
SPRING STUDY OF THE OWL 
We have learned how the owl makes a living for 
itself. Does it never care for others? There must 
be little owls sometimes. When do you think the 
little owls come? (In warm weather, in May or June.) 
Have you ever seen an owlet? Where was it? Per- 
haps in a rotten hole in an apple tree. How far from 
the ground was the hole? (Not higher than this 
room, ten feet.) How is the nest made? (The owls 
as does the woodpecker. This hole is often not choose a hole in a tree,—they do not make one, 
lined at all. There is rotten wood in the bottom,
-P-A-G-E-131
THE SCREECH OWL 119g 
and often dry leaves which have been blown into it; 
but sometimes the mother adds a few feathers from 
her breast, and sometimes the parents line the nest 
roughly with dry grass.) 
What kind of eggs are laid in this nest? (Four or 
more round, white eggs.) Which bird sits on the 
eggs? (The female; and during the day the male, 
too, sits there if the nest is roomy enough; if not, he 
chooses a hollow tree near by.) How long does it 
take the eggs to hatch? (About one month after the 
first egg is laid, the little owls are out of the shell.) 
How do they look when first hatched? Did you 
ever see one? [If possible, the children should see 
one before the season is over. It is a sight they 
will never forget.] (The owlets are at first covered 
with a yellowish white, downy coat. They look like 
fluffy balls.) 
How long do they stay in the nest? (About a 
month. Then they scramble out on the branches. 
They can climb like cats.) Did you ever try to catch 
one? What did it do? (Snapped its bill viciously.) 
How are they cared for, while growing up? (Both 
father and mother are kept very busy providing these 
hearty children with food. It would be a sad thing 
for the babies if one of their parents should be killed
-P-A-G-E-132
  
  I20 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
ere they were old enough to provide for themselves. 
We hope for their sake that this may never happen. 
Before cold weather comes, every owlet is grown 
and able to care for itself.) 
Frequent reviews should be made by topic, as, 
“Tell how the eyes fit the screech owl for work at 
night,” or, “In what respect does the owl resemble 
the cat?” (Its head looks like the,cat’s, it hunts at 
night, it likes mice and birds to eat, it can climb, 
etc.) 
XVI 
THE ENGLISH SPARROW 
This is a bird which we ‘may study at our doors all the year 
round. No inducement need be offered to bring it near, it 
never fails us. Since the bird is so common we should know 
its habits well, but in truth we know little about it. Juncos and 
sparrows that we love for their music are often called by its 
name, because so few take pains to identify this very common 
bird. 
How can you tell the male from the female? 
(The male has much chestnut in the coloring of its 
coat and it wears a black goatee. The female wears 
a light-colored dress in the coloring of which is no 
chestnut, and it has no black on its throat.), 
Where does the English sparrow live? When 
 
-P-A-G-E-133
  THE ENGLISH SPARROW vc 25 
does it leave us in the fall? (It stays all winter.) 
Most of the other birds have to go south; how can 
the English sparrow stay? (It lives upon grains, 
crumbs, and refuse that it finds in the streets.) 
Where does it stay during the winter? How does 
it get about upon the ground? Watch for its tracks 
in the snow. How does it protect its feet in the cold 
weather? 
Where does it build its nest? What kind of 
nest does it make? Of what does it build it? 
How many eggs does it lay? What color? Which 
of the parents feeds the young birds, or do both 
work? Watch each as it brings food to the young, 
and notice which makes the more ado about it. 
Notice carefully what is fed to the young. Watch 
the fledgelings as they leave the nest, and describe 
what you see. 
Why are there so many more of the English spar- 
rows than of the songsters we love? [The children 
will tell how the English sparrows drive the other 
birds away and take their nesting places from them.] 
The wrens, bluebirds, and martins all suffer at their 
hands. Notice, too, how late in the season some of 
these birds are still building nests, even in cold 
weather. Sometimes the young are raised and 
‘
-P-A-G-E-134
  {ATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
aed even in the winter time, so industrious is 
this bird. The best way to drive the bird away is 
to destroy the nests before the young are hatched. 
It would be cruel to harm the helpless young birds. 
How could you tell without looking that the Eng- 
lish sparrows are about? (By the constant chirp.) 
What is their song? (They have none.) 
What are their good points? Their bad points? 
XVII 
CATERPILLARS 
These numerous little visitors are a very interest- 
ing study for all grades in our public schools. Few 
people see in one of these odd little creatures a 
whole, wonderful life history. This is not the fault 
of the caterpillar, however, for its manner of life is 
quite open to the inspection of any one who cares to 
know of it, and it is certainly a pleasure to be able to 
say to one of these little folks: “How do you do? 
I am glad to make your acquaintance, for I knew 
your mother, whom you never saw. She showed her 
devotion to her children by making the best prepara- 
tion possible for satisfying their babyhood wants. 
For before your life was begun hers was ended ; so
-P-A-G-E-135
CATERPILLARS 123 
she made it possible for you to care for yourself. I 
saw her one day seeking a home for you. She chose 
a place which she knew you would like, and there, on 
the leaf of a plant like the one upon which you are 
now feeding, she laid the egg from which you camg. 
She did not crawl up the stalk, but flew lightly down 
to the plant. Does not that seem strange to you? 
Do you remember how happy you were when you 
crept from your shell and found your dinner waiting 
for you?’ Why did you eat up the house in which 
you had been staying? Did you fear that an enemy, 
on seeing that, might know that you were near? 
Eat away, my little fellow; that is your business at. 
present. No one should call you a glutton. Under 
the same circumstances your accusers would do no 
better. You must eat, in two or three weeks, 
enough to last you the remainder of the fall, and all 
winter, besides. No wonder you give yourself up to 
business so thoroughly.” 
As the caterpillar eats away, some little child, per- 
haps, picks the leaf on which it rests and places both 
in a box, or he gently brushes the caterpillar into the 
box, puts fresh leaves beside it, and carries it home 
or to school, where he may watch it. That all the 
children at school may see all of a caterpillar’s 
 
-P-A-G-E-136
  
  124 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
movements well, it is put into a glass which is cov- 
ered with netting or perforated paper. Two or three 
times a day the children supply it with fresh leaves, 
removing the wilted ones and occasionally cleaning 
the glass. The little captive seems quite contented 
so long as it has plenty of fresh food of the kind that 
it likes best, and a good appetite. 
Often we find caterpillars on the walks or in the 
road; these must be tested with a variety of food 
until leaves are found which they will eat. The 
hairy caterpillars which I found this summer con- 
tented themselves with the leaves of the smartweed 
or a closely allied plant. The plantain was, also, 
accepted by several. But whenever possible to know 
its choice, the caterpillar has been fed the food which 
it likes best, 
Some of the caterpillars may begin spinning, or 
otherwise changing, the day on which they are cap- 
tured. When we find one spinning at school, we 
pass the glass to the children for their inspection, 
taking care not to disturb the little worker. Some 
lesson may suffer for this interruption, but the chil- 
dren have a bit of experience all their own, which 
they would not care to part with, and school is 
made pleasanter for this little break in the routine.
-P-A-G-E-137
  
CATERPILLARS 125 
Long after most of the other lessons are forgotten, 
the children will look back with pleasure upon 
these happy moments of discovery. 
It has been our good fortune twice this fall to 
see a hairy caterpillar divesting itself of its hairs 
that it might weave them into its coverlet. It 
seemed to require no effort. Did it pull them out 
or bite them off? I am not sure. It did not 
appear to carry them in its mouth. How, then, did it 
carry them? This question must be solved by further 
observation. How deftly it wove those hairs into its 
cocoon, spreading them very evenly over its surface! 
How could that clumsy-looking body, with the still 
clumsier fleshy feet, move over that web with never 
a trip or a break of the dainty silk? In what a 
businesslike way the weaving was done, —the thread 
coming from its mouth as needed, and placed in 
position by movements of its head and front legs. 
When the top of the cocoon is to be thickened, it, 
lying within, turns upon its back and weaves away 
as if this were its natural position. It really never 
seems awkward when making its house, yet this 
is the first one it ever built, and it will never have 
an opportunity to build another. 
Several of the caterpillars use leaves as a par
-P-A-G-E-138
126 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
tial or a complete outside cover. These are woven 
firmly together and lined with silk. 
Once, in a very close little home, in which there 
seemed not room enough to stir, the caterpillar 
turned completely around, end for end. It moved 
with dignity and grace. We could not tell exactly 
how, for we did not understand its intentions at 
first. 
One of the caterpillars which we watched snipped 
off small portions of the leaves in the glass and 
wove these into its outer cover. They made the 
cocoon look very pretty, scattered regularly over 
its surface. Why did it do this? Has a caterpillar 
an eye for beauty? 
I have named but few of the many queer things 
which we noticed while the hairy caterpillars made 
ready for their sleep. 
The glasses which held the cocoons were placed 
in a dry cellar late in the fall, where they were 
kept until early spring, when they were again 
watched by the children for the housebreaking. 
In the fall work on the caterpillars, the children 
note the changes and give orally the history of 
each caterpillar so far as they have observed it. 
They also write portions of this history. They  
-P-A-G-E-139
  
CATERPILLARS 127 
make drawings of the caterpillar and its chrysalis, 
or the cocoon. The chrysalis and caterpillar are 
molded in clay and placed side by side on a plaque. 
The older children can do more. They can keep 
a book, which they might name “ Life Histories of 
Caterpillars.” They number the glass in which each 
little prisoner is confined, and write on the first page 
a few facts about Caterpillar No. 1, viz.:— 
(a) Hairy or smooth. 
(6) Length, color, and any striking characteristic 
in appearance ; number and position of legs. 
(c) When and where found. Food on which it is 
fed. 
(d) Any peculiarities in its actions. 
The next page is devoted to The Cocoon or Chrysa- 
is of No. i. 
(a) Length and shape of the cocoon and manner 
in which it was made; also time of making. 
Or description of the chrysalis, with account of the 
gradual change and date of its consummation. 
The third page is devoted to The Moth (or Butter- 
Jt”) of No. i. 
(a) When did it come out? Description of the 
method of releasing itself. 
(4) Description of the moth (or butterfly). 
 
-P-A-G-E-140
128 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
(c) From what flowers does it get its nectar? 
Color of these flowers? 
On the fourth page is given a record of The Eggs 
and Growth of No. 1. 
(a) Where were the eggs laid? How many in a 
place? Color? Form? Size? 
(4) How long did it take the eggs to hatch? 
(c) How long does it take the caterpillar to 
mature? How many moultings? 
It may be some time before this page is filled out, 
but watchfulness will reward the patient seeker. 
Quite likely more than one page may be needed for 
some of the descriptions. 
Many cocoons are found in the fall. What cater- 
pillar made them is a mystery, so our first entry in 
the book will be on the page devoted to the cocoon 
or chrysalis. 
This book may be used season after season, until 
every caterpillar is known through its whole series 
of changes. 
It is a wonder that more boys and girls living on 
farms do not make a study of caterpillars, learning to 
distinguish the harmful from the harmless. Through 
knowledge of the habits of those which are injurious 
to trees, vegetables, etc., the eggs of their moths or 
butterflies might be found and destroyed,

THE CABBAGE BUTTERFLY 
Have you seen butterflies in a “cabbage patch”? 
Of what color? What were they doing there? 
Watch them closely and see if you can find out. 
(They were laying eggs.) Where did they lay the 
eggs? What was their color? Why was it well that 
they were of this color? How many were there 
together? 
The teacher might well bring to the class a head 
of cabbage on which are some of these eggs. Keep 
in a shady, cool place where the leaves will not wilt, 
and allow the children to look at the eggs every day. 
Encourage them also to watch those on one head 
in their gardens at home. In about ten days from 
the time the eggs were laid they will hatch out into 
tiny green caterpillars. Is it well for them that their 
color is green? Why? What do they do as soon as 
they come from the egg? (Go to eating the leaves.) 
Why did the mother lay the eggs just where she did? 
A few of these caterpillars may be put into a glass 
and supplied with fresh leaves every day. The top 
should be covered with paper in which there are 
K
-P-A-G-E-142
  130 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
holes for the air to pass through. The children 
will feed the caterpillars and watch their growth. 
They grow to their full length, one and one-half 
inches or less, in about three weeks. 
What happens when they are fully grown? (They 
hang themselves up.) How? Where does the silk 
come from? (From the mouth.) In the body of the 
caterpillar are two long bags which hold a sticky fluid. 
This fluid flows through a tube which ends in the 
middle of the lower lip. The fluid hardens as soon 
as it comes to the air. 
Does the caterpillar hang with its head up or 
down? Then what happens? (It throws off its 
caterpillar skin.) Make a picture of it as it hangs 
now. 
The children note the day when it goes into its 
chrysalid state, and watch for it to come out. They 
will need to watch about eleven days if the study 
is begun early in the season. It will be a joyful 
moment for them if they are so fortunate as to see 
it leave its home. How does it go to work to get 
out? (It begins to move about, a slit comes on its 
back, and it puts its head out; then the rest of 
its body comes out, and the little green house is 
left empty.)
-P-A-G-E-143
  THE MILKWEED CATERPILLAR 131 
The children now have the whole life of the 
cabbage butterfly learned from their own obser- 
vation. They will never forget it. It helps them 
to interpret the life of all caterpillars. 
They will gather, feed, and watch other cater- 
pillars. Not all of them will change into butter- 
flies — some will become moths; and by comparison 
they will find these differences between butterflies 
and moths : — 
(a) A butterfly flies in the daytime, a moth by 
night. 
(6) A butterfly holds its wings erect when at 
rest. The wings of a moth lie flat, or slant like 
the roof of a house. 
(c) A butterfly has knobbed feelers. A moth’s 
feelers are not knobbed.

THE MILKWEED CATERPILLAR 
HATCHING OF THE EGG 
[What the older boys and girls may see if they look 
closely.] 
On the afternoon of August 12 we found an 
egg of the milkweed butterfly on the center of
-P-A-G-E-144
Oe eS eS UT ee ROE RRR eRe aoe ood oe ree aaa ee 
132 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
the under side of a milkweed leaf. It was cylin- 
drical, with a conical top. In color it resembled 
a pearl. 
In the morning, three days later, the cone at the 
top of the cylinder was found to have turned black 
or purple, and later in the day black specks were seen 
in the cylinder. About twelve o’clock two bright 
dots, looking like bubbles, appeared on the purple 
dome, and kept shifting from one point to another. 
Suddenly there was a bright flash which looked 
as if a blow from within had cracked into many 
pieces the dome, but it was not broken. There 
were now seen to be rapid motions inside the egg. 
The dome looked to be made of dainty silver 
rafters with still daintier crosspieces. Now the 
jaws of the imprisoned caterpillar began cutting 
the silver rafters at the base of one side of the 
dome. The light which was admitted changed the 
silver rafters to rows of beads,—red separated by 
short gold ones. A large hole was eaten in the 
side of the cylinder, then the black head of the tiny 
caterpillar was thrust out, followed by its white 
body, which bore a mere suggestion of yellow 
rings. 
The shell, after the caterpillar had left it, was
-P-A-G-E-145
THE MILKWEED CATERPILLAR 133 
beautiful beyond description. It was like rare filigreed 
silver, the pattern being the daintiest of feathers. 
The caterpillar nosed about for a few minutes, 
then went back to the shell and took a few bites 
of it; left it, as if its freedom from cramped quarters 
made it too happy to eat, but in ten minutes re- 
turned to it again and ate voraciously for five 
minutes or so; then after further investigation of 
its premises returned to the egg for a larger 
meal. 
The day after this little caterpillar came out, it 
was killed by kindness. The teacher moved it to a 
fresh leaf. It was too young to be disturbed, and 
died. 
MOULTING 
On August 6 of the following year we procured 
a milkweed caterpillar not more than one fourth of 
an inch long. It was eating round holes in the 
milkweed leaf. It was light green, with yellow and 
black transverse stripes. The head was black. On 
the 9th of the month two black horns were noticed 
on the front of the head and two shorter black ones 
on the back of the posterior extremity. 
Two days later the light green color of the cater- 
pillar had changed to bright yellow, of which there
-P-A-G-E-146
  134 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
were double rows, branching low down on the sides. 
On this morning it attached itself to the side of the 
jar by a web which it wove, and there it hung motion- 
less, head downward, for some time. At half-past 
one o’clock it began the task of disrobing. It first 
drew in its head until it seemed heavily hooded, and 
its true feet seemed drawn together under its chin; 
then began a series of shrinkings backward within it- 
self, — apparent chokings, shiverings, tremblings, and 
gaspings, the body swelling out and then contracting. 
The head gradually sank farther back into the hood, 
leaving only a tiny yellow triangle. The greatest 
movement was now noticeable at the posterior 
extremity. The skin there stretched as if it would 
break, and became so thin we could see through it. 
At last the old skin at the front broke and the cater- 
pillar worked out in front, pushing the skin back as 
it worked forward until the old coat came off at the 
back. Then the caterpillar threw its head about 
from side to side until the old headpiece dropped off. 
This changing of the coat occupied one hour. Occa- 
sionally the caterpillar rested. After the old head- 
piece had fallen off the caterpillar went back into 
its web and rested about twenty minutes, then ate 
up the coat it had just shed. Within two or three
-P-A-G-E-147
THE MILKWEED CATERPILLAR 135 
hours after it had shed its skin, it went to eating the 
fresh milkweed leaves. 
THE CHRYSALID 
The following year we had many milkweed cater- 
pillars in glasses and watched their growth. 
One morning one of our large caterpillars wove a 
web for a path and went to the top of the glass, 
which was covered with a perforated paper. Here 
it remained as if making plans for its change. 
The middle of the afternoon it underwent agonizing 
contortions. It threw its head to one side and then 
to the other, and then drew it in. The “feelers” 
were working nervously as the body worked. Late 
in the afternoon it let go its hold on the cover and 
swung free, being held to the cover by its hind feet, 
which were fastened in the web it had made. In 
this position it remained quiet part of the time, its 
head turned to one side, and part of the time’ 
wriggling to get free from its old coat. In the night 
it changed to a beautiful light green chrysalis. We 
could see the colored stripes of its coat through the 
thin cover. The dome-shaped top was narrower in 
front. The dome was separated from the body of 
the chrysalis by a narrow black line, above which was
-P-A-G-E-148
136 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
a row of small white dots interspersed with eight 
larger dots. Just above the larger end of the chrysalis, 
eight yellow dots, occurring at regular intervals, began 
to show. At the top there were six black dots, ex- 
tending, in twos, toward the front from the point 
of attachment. The next morning all the white on 
the chrysalis was changed to gold, and a gold dot 
appeared on each side toward the front. 
We had not seen the change from the caterpillar 
to the chrysalis. This was a disappointment, but 
later we saw what we had so regretted missing. This 
caterpillar swung off at six o’clock in the evening. 
I was up at half-past four o’clock in the morning. 
It was gnawing at its feet industriously. Occasion- 
ally it threw its head back. There was a great con- 
traction and relaxation of the muscles between the 
black and white rings, occurring every second or so 
at the last. At the end these movements became 
very violent, the skin burst open on the back, near its 
head, and was worked backward and off, where it 
finally fell to the bottom of the glass. The chrysalis 
swung around, first a few turns to the right, then a 
few turns to the left, thus forming the strong, twisted 
thread by which it hung. It became a chrysalis at 
half-past five o’clock in the morning.
-P-A-G-E-149
  THE MILKWEED CATERPILLAR 137 
THE HOUSEBREAKING 
Twelve days after the caterpillar became a chrys- 
alis, the chrysalis became a beautiful brown and 
black butterfly with white markings —the Monarch, 
or Milkweed, butterfly. The change, at the end, was 
very gradual. Two days before it occurred, the 
chrysalis had become of a lighter green; a day later, 
the orange and black showed through the thin chrys- 
alis shell ; then three shining points appeared on each 
side, extending from the center toward the bottom. 
In front the veinings of the wings were now visible, 
then the limits of the wings were plainly marked off 
on the sides. The margins of the wings broke 
through a little. While we were out of the room it 
came out, leaving its transparent chrysalis shell swing- 
ing empty. This was a disappointment. But the last 
chapter, it is hoped, will be recorded later.

IDENTIFICATION OF FLOWERS 
HERE, too, as well as in identifying birds, the 
games may be used in the first grade with profit 
and pleasure, eg. :— 
1. “Flower Game” in “Kindergarten Chimes,” 
Kate Douglas Wiggin, p. 115. 
2. “Smelling,” in the same book, p. 107. 
3. “Guessing Game,” p. 108 in the same book, 
may be altered in meaning a little so as to become 
a flower or a leaf game. Each child has a flower 
pinned upon his breast, and takes the name of the 
flower he wears; so the “zo” in the third line 
refers to daisy fleabane, or oak, perhaps. 
4. In “Touching,” a game in the same book, 
which reads in the second line, “Now take the 
thing we give you,” substitute flower. 
[For similar games see “Songs for Little Children,” 
II, Eleanor Smith, and “Merry Songs and Games,” 
Hubbard. ] 
141
-P-A-G-E-154
  142 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
5. A pupil, or the teacher, describes a flower 
which he is thinking about; the class name it. 
6. Each of several children is provided with a 
flower — no two alike. A few children form a ring 
in front and sing, e.g. :— 
“We're calling to you for a daffodil, 
A daffodil, a daffodil ; 
We're calling to you for a daffodil, 
And here is one.” 
or 
“ And there is none.” 
As soon as the name of the daffodil is spoken, 
the child who has that flower skips forward and 
enters the ring, or if she does not respond, her 
flower is given to another. 
II 
THE NASTURTIUM 
(A Fai Stupy) 
How do you know the flower? (By its color, 
shape of its blossom, its fragrance, its taste, and 
its peculiar leaf.) 
Each child is provided with a blossom. They 
examine it for the purpose of describing it accurately, 
so that one unacquainted with it would know it
-P-A-G-E-155
  THE NASTURTIUM 143 
were he to come upon it. The points in which the 
children will be interested are these : — 
(a) The variety in colors of the different flowers, 
the variety in one blossom, the markings of the petals. 
Out-of-door study: What besides people does the 
color attract? (Bees and humming birds.) Notice 
what these do when they come to the flowers. Find 
what it is they are seeking in the heart of the flower. 
(The juice in the long sac.) We call that the 
nectar. Taste of it. How do you like it? See if 
the sac is full. How can the humming bird reach 
it? the bee? Watch a bee as it leaves a flower. 
What is it carrying away? (Yellow dust.) On 
what part of its body does it carry it? From what 
did it come? Where does the bee go on leaving 
this blossom? Watch to see. 
Notice in what direction the lines on the petals 
extend. Can you think of any reason for this? 
(They show the bees the way to the nectar.) 
(b) The shape of the petals. What reason can 
you see for the broader upper petals? The over- 
lapping of the edges of these petals? Of what 
does it make you think? (The roof of a house.) 
(c) How the flower is held. Can you see any 
reason why it is held so that it opens at the side
-P-A-G-E-156
    144 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
instead of at the top? (The rain cannot get in to 
spoil the nectar and the pollen.) 
(d) The development from bud to blossom. How 
is the bud protected? Are these sepals of any use 
to the flower after it blossoms? Of what use? 
In which is the stem longer, the full-sized blossom 
or the tiny bud? Can you think of any reason for 
the longer stem of the blossom? (To attract bees, 
the blossom must be well above the leaves. The 
bud has nothing to offer to the bees and humming 
birds.) 
(e) The development from flower to fruit. Notice 
all the changes in the flower,—the drying up of 
the petals and the sepals and the falling of the same; 
the growth of the inside of the flower—the ovary 
—until it finally matures, and turns brown. Where 
did you find the blossom, above or below the leaves? 
Where do you find the ripened seeds? How did 
they get down there? (The children will notice 
that the stem has twisted, in a curious way, so as 
to bring the seed pod under the leaves.) Can you 
think of any reason for this? (Perhaps it is to make 
room for the flowers, or to protect the seeds from the 
rain and the sun and from enemies that might like 
to eat them.) Taste of one of the seeds not yet
-P-A-G-E-157
  THE MORNING-GLORY 145 
ripe. What do you notice? Is it well for the seed 
that it has a spicy taste? Of what use is the seed 
to us other than giving us new plants? How many 
seeds in one pod? How are the seeds scattered? 
Will plants come next year from these seeds that 
are scattered? (The home of this plant is in a 
warm country, where the plants do not freeze after 
they sprout. They cannot bear our cold springs, so 
we save the seeds and plant them when the weather 
becomes warm.) 
(f) The dense foliage. Describe the leaf. The 
stems of the young and of the older leaves. Of what 
use are the leaves to the little buds and to the seed 
pods? 
Note. — This is not intended to be an exhaustive study of 
the nasturtium. A fuller study would be made in the higher 
gtades, including the cross-fertilization of the plants. 
III 
THE MORNING-GLORY 
(A Sprine Stupy) 
Have you planted any flower seeds this spring? 
What ones? [Among others quite likely the morn- 
ing-glory may be mentioned.] Have you any morn- 
L 
 
-P-A-G-E-158
   
   146 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
ing-glory seeds? You may bring some to school to 
plant, that we may have their pretty leaves and 
blossoms in our windows. [If the children have 
not the seeds, the teacher will furnish them. ] 
On the following day a number of seeds are 
placed in a dish where all can see them well. No- 
tice their colors. Notice their shape. What gave 
them this queer shape? If they have not noticed 
the seed pod, they will be told that we shall find 
out later. 
The teacher has in the class two wooden starch 
boxes, or other boxes, filled with rich soil. The girls 
plant seeds in one box and the boys in another. 
See which will have the better plants. Each is 
labeled. What do you expect from these seeds? 
(Morning-glory vines.) What care must the seeds 
have? (They must be kept warm and must have 
water.) How much water? [Appoint one careful 
girl to care for the girls’ box of seeds, and a thought- 
ful boy to care for the other box.] The boxes are 
now set away. Where shall we set them? 
Now each child is supplied with a morning-glory 
seed and a pin. Would you like to find what is 
inside this seed? You may take off its outside coat. 
(We cannot, it is fastened on so very tightly.) 
 
-P-A-G-E-159
THE MORNING-GLORY 147 
What shall we do to the seeds to loosen the out- 
side coat? (Soak them.) I will soak them over 
night in warm water and see if that will loosen 
their coats. Is it well that their coats cannot be 
easily removed? Why? [On the following day the 
soaked seeds are taken to the class. Each child is 
provided with one and with a pin.] You may see 
now if you can remove the seed’s coat. Be very 
careful not to injure what is inside. What do you 
find? (Underneath the coat is a layer which looks 
like light-colored jelly.) And what is inside the jelly? 
(Two tiny white leaves, all crumpled up, and between 
the two, and protected by them, is a little white stem.) 
Spread out the leaves. Why were they so crum- 
pled? (If they had been spread out as they are 
now they would have taken up much more room. 
They were packed in as closely as possible.) Did 
you notice any jelly in the dry seed? Scratch a 
little of the coat off these dry seeds. (There is no 
jelly here, it is a hard substance.) What is this 
hard lining of the coat which turns into jelly 
when soaked? What do you expect these little 
stems and leaves to do? (To grow.) And what 
must they have to make them grow? (Food.) 
Where will they get the food? (The roots will
-P-A-G-E-160
  148 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
gather it for them from the ground.) Where are 
the roots of this little plant? (It has none, yet.) 
What will feed it until its roots grow? (This jelly 
which is all around it.) Why did not the little plant 
begin to grow in the winter, in the paper in which 
we found it? (It cannot take hard food. Its food 
must be dissolved for it before it can take it.) Then 
what must happen to the seed before the tiny plant 
can begin growing? (It must be wet.) You may 
make a picture in the left-hand corner of your draw- 
ing paper of this little plant as it looks when it first 
comes from the seed, then we shall remember how 
the morning-glory began life. 
At the same time that the children planted their 
seeds, the teacher planted a quantity in a box by 
themselves. As soon as the plants in her box begin 
to break through the ground, a few are taken up and 
changes noticed by the children. Where is the 
jelly? (The seeds have used it up. The plant has 
little roots now and they have gone to work.) 
[Drawings are made at each stage of the plant’s 
development. ] 
As soon as the leaves are above ground they are 
compared in color, size, and shape with the same 
when in the seed. Look closely between the two
-P-A-G-E-161
THE MORNING-GLORY 149 
leaves. What do you see? (A little green dot.) 
We will watch and see what becomes of it. [They 
will find later that this “green dot” changes into a 
leaf.] Only one? Is its shape the same as that of 
the two? Draw the two leaves side by side on the 
board. 
But this was not all that the “little dot” contained, 
for they see a small bud pushing right past the leaf ; 
and what has it? (Another leaf and a bud.) On 
which side of the stem does this leaf grow? (On the 
side opposite to the other.) [Later the children find 
that the leaves all grow out in this way, — first, one on 
one side, then one on the other. They admire the 
beauty of the shape of the leaf and its delicate tex- 
ture. They notice the veining and illustrate at the 
board.] Why does it have these veins? (They are 
the troughs through which the sap passes to all parts 
of the leaf. They also hold the leaf out, giving it its 
shape, and allowing the sun, air, and moisture to reach 
all parts of it.) But why are the vines stretching out 
their arms to us so pleadingly? (They wish us to 
help them to stand.) What shall we do for them? 
(Give them strings for support.) 
[After a while the children notice something grow- 
ing in the axils of the leaves.] What is it? We will 
 
-P-A-G-E-162
  150 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
watch it and see. Some of these turn out to be 
branches, others flowers. 
[The flower buds are watched carefully from the 
time they are big enough to be seen until they open 
and close, and drawings are made of them, showing 
how they look at different stages of their growth. ] 
How long do they remain in blossom? Mark certain 
flowers and find out. (From morning until after- 
noon.) Will this same blossom open again to-morrow 
morning? Look and see. Can you tell by the looks 
of a closed flower whether it has blossomed or not? 
How? Picture, side by side, a bud that will open in 
the morning and one that has opened and closed. 
What becomes of the flower that is through blos- 
soming? How long does its pretty dress —the corolla 
—remain on the vine after it is through blossoming? 
Watch and see. Why does it fall off? (It is of no 
more use.) What was its work? 
Let us look at this fresh dress. (It is all in one 
piece, but you can see where five pieces were put 
together to make it. The seams show.) Let us 
open it and look at the inside. (The stamens are 
fastened to the lower part of this dress. There are 
five of them, one on each piece of its dress.) And 
do they fall off with the dress? (Yes.) Are they 
 
-P-A-G-E-163
  THE MORNING-GLORY ISI 
not leaving before their work is done? What is 
their work? They bear the pollen that makes the 
seeds grow. Where are the seeds? Do the sta- 
mens shed their pollen before falling? Notice the 
open flower and see if they do. How does the pollen 
reach the seeds? (It falls on the stigma and passes 
down the style to the seeds; or the bees leave pollen 
which they have gathered from some other morning- 
glory on the stigma, when they go into the flower for 
the nectar which is at its base; or the wind blowing 
carries the pollen from one flower to another.) Did 
the sepals fall with the corolla? (No, they stay to 
protect the seed pod.) 
The children watch the growth of the seed pod on 
several flowers which they may select. They see 
that finally the style dries up, only a small portion of 
it remaining. Is its work done? What did it have 
to do? Notice how long a time elapses after the 
blossom opens before the seeds are ripened. What 
happens when they are ripe? (Three doors open into 
three little rooms, in each of which dwells snugly 
two three-sided seeds. These seeds drop out when 
the plant is disturbed.) 
Now we have found out how the seeds happen to 
have such queer shapes, —six of them were packed
-P-A-G-E-164
152 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
closely in a little, round, three-roomed house. What 
other shape would have packed so well? 
IV 
THE COMMON BLUE VIOLET 
At the beginning of the spring term, or at the 
close of the winter term, the children are asked to 
look for violets and see who will be first to find one. 
As soon as violets become plentiful the children 
are asked to notice carefully what kind of home they 
live in. Is it moist ground or dry? Is it in the 
shade or in the sun? In the woods or out? In 
company with what other flowers? 
Did any of you know exactly where to go to look 
for violets this year? How did you know? (They 
grew there last year.) Did they grow all winter? 
When the snow was off the ground could you see 
them? (No, the frost killed the /eaves in the fall.) 
Did it kill all of the plant? (No, the root lived 
through the winter.) How was it protected from 
the cold? (It was covered with soil; above that 
were dead leaves, and over all the snow.) Is 
snow warm? How could it keep the violets warm? 
(It shut out the cold air and kept in the warmth.)
-P-A-G-E-165
THE COMMON BLUE VIOLET 153 
Did-you look for violets at all before they came, 
this year? Were there any promises of violets? 
(The leaves.) Can you think of any reason why 
the leaves should come first? (They make a pretty 
home for the flower. They stand around it like 
little soldiers, ready to protect it.) But that is not 
all. The leaves are the plants’ kitchens, in which 
all the food is prepared for the flowers and the 
whole plant as well. The little flowers must have 
food or they could not grow, so the leaves come 
first and get the food ready for them. Can you 
see the work going on in the leaves? (No, the 
preparation of the food is made in a very quiet 
and orderly manner.) 
Where does the food which is prepared in the 
leaves come from? (The roots get it from the 
ground.) Have you ever noticed the roots of 
the violet? I have a plant here with its roots 
washed so that you can see them plainly. Which 
are the working roots? (The very small ones.) 
What must these roots have through which to take 
their food? (Mouths.) Where are their mouths? 
(All over the tiny roots.) Can you see them? (No.) 
What kind of food can be taken through such little 
mouths? (Water.) If you put a little salt or soda 
 
-P-A-G-E-166
   
   I54 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
into water, what becomes of it? (It dissolves so we 
cannot see it.) Could the plant take anything but 
water through its tiny root mouths? (It could take 
other things if they were dissolved in water.) It 
does this. We do not know all of the things that 
it takes in this way. 
How does this food reach the leaves? (It first 
passes along to “the large root,” then up the stem 
to the stalks of the leaves, on through the large 
veins in the leaves into the smaller ones, and so on 
to all parts of the leaf, where it is prepared as food 
and then sent to all parts of the plant to feed it.) 
What furnishes the heat for preparing the food? 
(The sun.) Yes, the food cannot be made ready 
unless the sun helps, and so when the sun goes 
down the work in the leaves ceases. You have 
noticed that when your mother is cooking, steam 
arises from the kettles or saucepans. Does steam 
arise from this food as it is being prepared? You 
may place several fresh violet leaves under this 
glass, look at the glass occasionally, and tell us to- 
morrow what you noticed. On the inside of the 
glass will be moisture. From what did this come? 
Can you see the holes through which it came? 
(No, they are too small to be seen.) Through these 
   
-P-A-G-E-167
  
THE COMMON BLUE VIOLET 155 
tiny holes air goes into the leaf and mixes with 
the food from the roots before that is fit for the 
plant to eat. When the food is all ready what 
becomes of it? (Some of it goes to all parts of 
the leaf, some to the roots, and some to the pretty 
blue blossoms.) 
You said that there were no leaves in the winter. 
When did these leaves come? How could they grow 
when there were no leaves in which to prepare the 
food for them? (Last autumn, before Jack Frost 
killed the working leaves, this “large root,” as you 
call it, packed up enough prepared food to feed the 
roots and leaves this spring, until they got well 
started at their work and could feed themselves.) 
Let us look at this trunk in which the food was 
packed last autumn. Why do you call it a root? (It 
looks like one. It grows underground.) What do 
we find growing from it here? (Leaves.) [The 
teacher should have a number of different plants 
in the class.] From what do the leaves on this 
plant grow? (A stem.) Onthis? (A stem.) What 
do we call this part from which the leaves and 
flowers grow? (A stem.) What shall we call ¢his, 
then, from which the violet’s leaves and flowers 
grow (pointing to the root-stock)? (A stem.) Since 
 
-P-A-G-E-168
    
156 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
it grows under the ground what name might we give 
it? (An underground stem.) 
How did the little leaves look when they started 
up from this stem to get a peep into the great world, 
where they were to make ready a home for the 
flowers? Here are some on this plant which I took 
up. (The stalk sticks its back up through the ground 
first, as if to make way for the little leaf blade. Then 
it comes through with the blade bent over so as to 
lie close to the upper part of the stalk.) Look 
closely at the little leaves. (They are rolled tightly 
from both edges toward the midrib so as to get 
through the ground without being torn or broken.) 
And does it unroll suddenly? Notice the bases of 
the half-grown leaves. 
What shape is the leaf? Draw it on the board. 
Does the shape of the leaf help it any after it is 
grown? [Sprinkle some water on a leaf of a grow- 
ing plant. It is well to have some growing in boxes 
in the house.] What do you see? (The water 
gathers in the center of the leaf and runs down the 
little trough in its stalk.) Is that well or not? (It 
carries the water directly to the roots, where it is 
needed.) What does the water do? (Dissolves 
solid food which it finds in the earth, then is taken
-P-A-G-E-169
  
THE COMMON BLUE VIOLET 157 
in by the little roots, goes to the leaf, and is mixed 
with air and moisture coming through the tiny holes 
in the leaves.) 
And while the roots are working away and the 
leaves are so busy, what is the little flower doing? 
(Growing.) How does it look when you first see it 
above ground? Picture on the board. What changes 
do you notice as it grows older? (The stem lengthens, 
lifting the bud higher and higher into the air and 
sunlight. The bud grows fuller and longer. At 
last the green blanket that covers little Violet is 
pushed aside, and we see her blue dress.) Notice 
how her dress was folded while she was wrapped 
in the blanket. Did it get wrinkled? Do you 
think you could fold a dress and pack it so tightly 
and have it come out without a wrinkle? What 
becomes of the green blanket? Can you see it on 
your flowers? It still protects Violet. Her dress 
is very delicate. 
Do all violets wear dresses of the same tint of 
blue? (Some are dark and some are light.) Do they 
ever wear any other color? (Some violets are white, 
some are yellow, and some are purple.) Is the dress 
in one piece? What are the pieces called? (Petals.) 
Are they all of the same size and shape? (The
-P-A-G-E-170
  
158 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
lowest petal is a little larger than the others, and it 
has a little pocket behind.) Let us see if we can 
find anything in this pocket. [This can better be 
shown with a large pansy.] We will cut the pocket 
off. Now pinch it. Taste. What do you find? 
(Honey.) We will call it nectar. Why is the nectar 
there? What would like it? (Bees and other 
insects.) Have you ever seen any insects about the 
violets? Watch closely and tell all that the bees 
or other insects do. Later the children will very 
likely have discovered that the bee alights on the 
lower petal, then thrusts in his “long mouth” — 
proboscis—and drinks in the nectar. Notice care- 
fully the path which the proboscis of the bee takes 
in going to the nectar. There seems to be a path 
on purpose for it right through the middle of the 
lower petal, and there is a hedge along both sides of 
this road. What is this hedge? (A thick beard of 
short hairs running down the two petals on each 
side of the flower.) Take this fine stalk of grass 
and let it follow the road which the proboscis of the 
bee follows. Then look closely at the grass and 
tell what you see. (There is pollen on it.) Where 
did it come from? What is it good for? (To feed 
the tiny seeds so they will grow.) Let us look
-P-A-G-E-171
  THE COMMON BLUE VIOLET 159 
closely at the home of these seeds. Where shall 
we find them? [Each child has a flower and finds 
the pistil.] Where are the little seeds? How is 
the pollen to reach them? (It must fall on the 
sticky top of the pistil and pass down through 
that zabe to the seeds.) The sticky top is the 
stigma and the tube is the style. 
Watch one clump of violets at or near your home 
this spring. Look for seed pods. Here are some 
which I gathered last summer. Let us see who 
will be the first to find one on his clump. 
Look far down among the violet leaves for some- 
thing that grows up from the underground stem about 
which we have not spoken. Tell about it to-morrow. 
[The next day the children are questioned in 
regard to their discoveries. They will tell of 
queer little three-sided buds, of roundish, hard balls, 
something that looked like the flowers but had no 
petals, etc. The teacher should have some of these 
apetalous flowers in the class room, showing dif- 
ferent degrees of development. It will be easy 
to find other seed pods also.] What are these? 
(Queer little flowers with no petals.) Why do they 
not come up where we can see them? (They 
have no pretty petals to show.) Have they borne 
 
-P-A-G-E-172
  160 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
seeds down here in the shade? (Some of them 
have.) 
Here is something still stranger about these queer 
flowers. [The teacher has a plant in the class with 
soil on its roots.] Look as I open the soil. (There 
are some of those queer flowers below the ground, 
and some have gone to seed here without ever seeing 
the light.) 
When the violet pod is ripe, what happens? (It 
divides into three parts and opens.) How are the 
seeds scattered? What becomes of them? We will 
plant some in this box and see if they will grow 
for us. Mamie may care for the box this week. 
If the underground roots were all to die, might 
we still have violets? How? 
[Review the life of the violet later, starting with 
the seed. ] 
Vv 
THE WILD ROSE 
The wild rose is in full bloom in June, before our 
schools are closed, and is a very simple flower for 
study. The following are some of the points in 
which the children will be interested :—
-P-A-G-E-173
THE WILD ROSE 161 
It presents no loud color, but passes from pure 
white, which is somewhat rare, to intense pink, 
through all the intermediate tints. Not unfrequently 
we find in a single flower exquisite markings and 
shadings. Its fragrance, too, is as delightful as its 
coloring. 
When the sun is shining the mature rose spreads 
wide its petals, catching every ray which comes its 
way, but when darkness reigns it closes, and says to 
the world, “Good night.” Does it close, also, before 
and during a storm? Watch and see. The closed 
flower is as beautiful as the open one. When you 
have seen one you have not seen all, for there are 
many different arrangements of the petals in closing, 
but in each the adaptation is so perfect that one 
wonders that any other plan could have answered so 
well. Why should the rose close at night? If we 
notice the texture of one of the petals we find its 
two sides quite unlike. The soft, velvety upper side 
might easily be marred by the dew, while the coarser 
under side seems better fitted to cope with it. This 
suggests what may be one reason for closing. Later 
we may find a better one. 
Any child can find out how long the petals remain 
after the flower opens by watching carefully the 
M 
 
-P-A-G-E-174
  
162 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
unfolding of certain buds which he has marked, but 
he must bear in mind that storms of wind or rain 
often cut the tender lives short. 
Although each petal usually performs its part in 
closing, occasionally we find one, like a willful child, 
standing off by itself, rolled up to resemble a bud. 
Sometimes, too, one little petal will creep out of the 
bud many hours before the others are ready. It 
looks too dismal to be enjoying its joke. 
If there is room in the schoolhouse yard, wild 
roses might be planted there. Here the children will 
discover many interesting facts about their appearance 
and growth. 
About the time that the petals fall, the stamens 
change their bright color for a dark brown, and 
later this color gives place to black. Their work 
is done, although they do not pass out of sight. 
The only part of the rose now especially notice- 
able is the green seed cup with the sepals fastened 
to its rim, and falling back over its sides. We 
had noticed this cup but little when the petals 
stood about and above it, but it has been growing 
quite rapidly all of the time. Why should this 
cup remain while the petals fall and the stamens 
fade? There is not much more beauty to it than
-P-A-G-E-175
  THE WILD ROSE 163 
to a little green apple, which it much resembles. 
We will open one of these cups—a large one. 
Inside we find a number of shining yellow seeds. 
They form a circle around the inside of the cup. 
All are closely packed together. The outer seeds 
are rounded on the outside. There is no definite 
number of sides to each seed, they differ consid- 
erably in shape, and we find, too, some seeds that 
seem to be dried up. Why is this? We will go 
back a little. The children have noticed that when 
they touched the stamens, pollen covered the tip of 
the finger. The little pollen sacks have burst and 
the pollen is free. Much of it falls on the little 
green cushion in the center of the flower. By 
opening one of the smaller cups it will be seen 
that this cushion is the feathery top of many 
small styles which reach down to the seeds. The 
pollen touches a little seed and says, “Wake up 
and grow,” and the seed obeys. The ovules that 
did not develop into seeds failed to receive the 
message, so they did not grow. The petals need 
to guard the pollen that its seed children may 
thrive. How does the closing of the rose at night 
help? Why is it well that the petals are so deli- 
cate on the upper side?
-P-A-G-E-176
  164 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
How long a time the seeds grow before ripening 
can be learned by the children by recording the 
time of the falling of the petals on a few marked 
TOSes. 
As the seeds grow the little cup which holds 
them grows. At last, when they are ripened, the 
cup proclaims it to the world by its changed 
color, now a bright red. But this is a covered 
cup. How are the seeds to get out into the 
world? Has the plant been working so hard for 
nothing? “That red cup looks very attractive,” says 
birdie, and down it pounces upon it, breaking the 
cup and scattering some of the seeds, while it eats 
greedily from the broken cup. So the rose feeds 
the birds and the birds free the seeds. Nature’s 
children are everywhere helping one another. 
VI 
TREE BUDS 
(A SprinG Stupy) 
There are wonderful discoveries to be made by 
watching the development of the tree buds in the 
spring. 
Sometimes twigs are put into glasses in the school- 
room early in the season, before the buds begin to
-P-A-G-E-177
  TREE BUDS 165 
swell. They can be watched here by the young 
children much more advantageously than out of 
doors, as oftentimes the branches of the trees are 
so high that the children cannot see the buds well. 
It is best to take but few twigs at a time. 
Watching the sycamore twigs, a little green ball 
appears upon one of the side shoots. We are sure 
it must be a seed ball. It has a white stem about 
three fourths of an inch long. On each of two 
opposite sides of the ball is a leaf, growing from 
its base. Between the ball and each of these larger 
leaves is a tiny leaf, making four in all. The ball 
grows quite rapidly, then becomes fluffy. It turns 
gray —what can this mean? Now showers of pol- 
len are falling from it every time it is disturbed. 
Are there not seeds, too? (No, the stamens drop 
off, leaving a white, woolly ball. It turns brown, 
dies, and falls.) 
Now a ball resembling the one previously de- 
scribed grows from a terminal bud. It has a light 
green stem over an inch long. It is surrounded by 
leaves as was the other ball. It grows and grows, ; 
but sheds no pollen. It is the true seed ball. 
The staminate and pistillate blossoms of the 
balm of Gilead tree grow on separate trees. We
-P-A-G-E-178
166 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
have twigs from both trees. The staminate blos- 
soms come out dark red, dotted with white. 
Further observation shows us that these “white 
dots” are scales which separate the blossoms. 
They are packed as carefully as if they were deli- 
cate china. These scales fall out as soon as the 
blossoms expand. When the anthers burst, the 
flowers turn yellow, then a dirty brown. .At last 
they fall. The seed catkins are green, and are 
sometimes over eight inches long. Their maturing 
can be followed on the trees. 
What do the buds of the plum trees contain? 
(Three or four flower buds each.) Naturally we 
look to the cherry tree, expecting to find the same 
thing true of its buds, but here we find clusters of 
little green knobs. The central bud develops into 
a twig, the others into blossoms. Which one is the 
apple bud like? When its brown bud opens it dis- 
closes a gray velvet hood, which contains a set of 
five or six flower buds surrounded by six or seven 
leaves. It is quite different from the others. 
The opening linden buds make one think of a 
child’s face with its sunbonnet pushed back. The 
buds are separated by a long space — sometimes 
three inches.
-P-A-G-E-179
  
  AUTUMN LEAVES AND BUDS 167 
The catalpa buds come out from under the bark of 
the twig where they have been protected all winter. 
There are four buds in a circle. What queer leaf 
scars on the twigs! 
The twigs of all the trees are interesting. Each 
variety has a different method of putting forth its 
blossoms and twigs, and there are constant surprises 
for the children. The few examples given above are 
no more interesting than hundreds of others. There 
is not a prosy one among them. 
VII 
AUTUMN LEAVES AND BUDS 
As soon as the leaves begin to fall, encourage 
the children to bring beautiful ones to school, the 
teacher pressing some of them for the decoration 
of the schoolroom. Ask the children to name 
the trees from which the leaves come. Notice 
what tree first puts on gay colors, and have the 
children note the succession. What tree is soonest 
bare? What one retains its leaves longest of all? 
Notice the movement of the leaves in falling. Listen 
to the sounds which they make. 
The trees that wear yellow dresses may be
-P-A-G-E-180
168 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
grouped together, also those that wear dresses of 
red, bronze, brown, red and yellow, etc. Do all 
trees that send off their leaves dress them beauti- 
fully before they go? What trees have leaves that 
shrivel up when the frosts come? 
You have had a story abouta little leaf that worried 
a great deal [“ The Anxious Leaf,” by Henry Ward 
Beecher]. About what did it worry? (For fear the 
wind would pull it off and throw it down on the ground 
to die.) Is the wind doing that with any leaves 
now? Do they fall easily? Could the wind always 
pull the leaves off so easily? (No, not in the spring 
and summer.) You may shake the little branch that 
I brought in. (The leaves come fluttering down.) 
Let us see if we can find out why the leaves fall 
so easily now. Why is it, do you think? (“They 
forget to hang on.” ‘They are loose.” ‘ Some- 
thing is growing up between the leaf and the 
branch, and the leaf can’t reach around it.’) 
Look closely at that something. What is it? (A 
tiny bud.) Will it fall off? Why do you think it 
will not? (It holds on so tightly.) Do you think 
it liked to have the leaf by it? (Yes, the leaf 
clasped it and kept it warm, and dry, and out of 
the sight of bugs which might eat such a tender 
 
-P-A-G-E-181
  AUTUMN LEAVES AND BUDS 169 
thing.) It is true that the buds need the leaves 
when they are so tiny, but they do not push the 
leaves off. Notice carefully these leaves on the 
branch. Here is a little fence which has been 
slowly built up between the leaf and the branch. 
When the fence is done, the leaf drops. But this 
fence is never built up too fast. The leaves, all 
through the summer, are working away, for they 
prepare all the food which the tree needs. When 
the little fence is begun, the tree ceases to need much 
food and so stops growing. Instead of using now the 
food prepared by the leaves, it packs it away in its 
trunk and branches, for it will need it in the spring ; 
and when the leaves have furnished the tree all the 
food it needs, their work is done, and they are ready 
to go, and just at that time the fence is finished. 
Of what use are the leaves after they fall? (They 
cover the roots of the plants and protect them from 
the cold. The snows and rains cause them to decay.) 
Of what use are the decayed leaves? Bring leaf 
mold to the class—coarse and fine. How is it 
made? Of what use? 
[This is probably as deep as we shall care to go 
into the subject with little children who have just 
entered school. ]
-P-A-G-E-182
    
170 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
You have spoken of the leaf caring for the bud. 
Why should it care for it so tenderly? Of what use 
is a bud? Let us see what is in this little cotton- 
wood bud. (The outside is sticky.) Why is that? 
(To protect it from the rain and snow and to keep 
bugs from eating it.) We will take off this water- 
proof coat very carefully. What do you see here? 
What do these coats do? (There must be something 
very valuable inside which these coats are keeping 
safe.) And inside these soft wrappings what do 
we find? (Some tiny leaves—a little twig.) 
What are they doing here? (They are lying in 
their warm bed, cuddled closely together, waiting 
for spring. When the weather begins to get warm 
in the spring, the wax on the outside will melt and 
the buds will swell so that their covers become too 
small, then they burst open and finally fall.) Why 
do the buds not open now? (They would freeze 
in the winter, so the tree gives them very little 
food —just enough to keep them alive, but not 
enough to make them grow.) 
Open other buds; some will be found to contain 
flowers. Notice the difference in the shapes of the 
twig buds and flower buds. [The flower buds on 
many trees are short and round, while the twig
-P-A-G-E-183
  
AUTUMN LEAVES AND BUDS 171 
buds are long and pointed.] By noticing the open- 
ing of the buds in the spring these same facts can 
be learned without destroying the buds. 
Was it not too bad for the leaf to leave the 
little bud? (No; the bud does not need it longer, 
it is covered up so well. The leaf stayed with it 
until it had on all its covers, so the little buds do 
not need the leaves, and the tree does not need 
them to prepare its food.) But would it do any 
harm for them to stay? (Yes, the snow might 
gather on the leaves and break the branches with 
its weight.) 
Do you think you would find buds on all these 
trees that are losing their leaves? Look and see, 
and find if the leaves and flowers of the different 
trees are wrapped up in the same way that those 
on the cottonwood are wrapped. 
It is advisable when beginning the study of buds to 
center observation chiefly upon two or three kinds of 
trees, as hickory and cottonwood. 
DEVICES IN IDENTIFYING LEAVES 
1. Have a package of leaves of several different 
varieties for each child. Give the name of a leaf 
and have each child show a leaf of that name.
-P-A-G-E-184
  172 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
2. Have a number of leaves on the table. Call 
rapidly on the children, one at a time, to select the 
different leaves you name. 
3. A child names a leaf, calling on another child 
to select it; the school approve the choice by saying, 
#2, “Wes,| Karl,” or “No, Mary); Jt the came 
called upon selects the correct leaf, he names a leaf 
for another to select, and so on. 
4. Achild stands before the class with a package 
of leaves; holding up a leaf, he says, ¢.g., “This is a 
sugar maple leaf,” etc., until he names one incorrectly. 
The first child who detects the mistake takes his place 
and names leaves until he misses one, and so on. 
5. The children are each supplied with several vari- 
eties of leaves. They examine closely and describe. 
They name the characteristics, e.g., of the elm, the 
scarlet oak, the linden. 
6. (a) The teacher describes a leaf; the children 
name it from her description. (4) A child de- 
scribes; the others name. 
7. All the pupils close their eyes. Each is pro- 
vided with a leaf, which he names by feeling it. 
8. A child makes a drawing of a leaf at the board. 
The children name from the drawing. These 
sketches are put on the board rapidly.
-P-A-G-E-185
  AUTUMN LEAVES AND BUDS 173 
9g. A child draws, for example, an oak leaf; the 
children criticise the drawing. 
10. Beautiful autumn leaves are mounted on pan- 
els. These panels are strung together and hung 
upon the walls at the top of the blackboards. A 
pupil points to the leaves and names rapidly. 
11. Leaves of various trees are given to the chil- 
dren. Seeds of these same trees are also given to 
them. The children arrange the leaves on their 
desks and place upon each leaf the corresponding 
seed. 
12. Cut slips of cardboard five by ten inches. Upon 
each slip print, or write with a brush, the name of a 
tree. Scatter these slips about the room, placing 
them on the ledge of the blackboard. 
Upon the table place leaves of the trees named 
upon the cards. 
A child is asked to pick out a leaf and place it by 
itsname. The class say, “ Yes, ——” (calling the 
name of the child), if the leaf is correctly placed, or 
“No, 
See which one can match correctly the largest num-   
,” if the leaf is placed by the wrong slip.

[This may be used for bird identification by sub- 
stituting mounted specimens or colored pictures of 
birds for leaves, and using the names of birds on the 
slips. ] 
LEAF GAME No. 1 
The children play leaf games, e.g. the following, 
suggested by Lula Ward :— 
“Oak, elm, and walnut, standing in a row, 
Standing there so straight and tall, 
With leaves all showing so. 
Now one away is skipping, as fast as she can go. 
Name her quickly, Florence, and you'll be in the row.” 
Explanation : — 
Each child in the class has a leaf pinned upon his 
breast. Three pupils are called to stand out in front 
of the class; the names of the leaves which they 
wear are substituted for the names given in the first 
line of the little rhyme. As the fourth line is 
sung, one of the three children skips away. If 
the child whose name is called in the last line can 
give the name of the leaf which the former child 
wears, he takes his place in the row in front of the 
class. (He wears a leaf of some other tree.) 
The little rhyme is sung by all the children ex- 
cept the three in the row.
-P-A-G-E-187
AUTUMN LEAVES AND BUDS 175 
LEAF GAMES Nos. 2, 3, AND 4 
In “For Grace and Pleasure” are three games 
which may be used in connection with the identi- 
fication of leaves; see “Leaves in the Wind,” p. 7, 
“The Barberry” (or other plant), p. 28. Substitute 
the name of the tree from which a leaf came, eg. 
maple tree, in place of “ September leaves,” p. 7. 
LEAF GAME No. 5 
Each child has the leaf of a tree pinned upon his 
waist. The children form a circle and sing this song 
as they move about in the ring : — 
“Here we go round the —— tree, the —— tree, the —— tree; 
Here we go round the tree, 
So early in the morning.”   
(Sing to the tune of “Here we go round the mulberry bush.”) 
As soon as the name of the tree is sung, the child 
who wears a leaf from that tree steps quickly into the 
ring. If he fails to respond, through inattention or 
lack of identification of the tree by its leaf, he steps 
out of thering. If he recognizes his leaf name when 
called later, he dodges into the center of the ring and 
is again in the game.  
-P-A-G-E-188
  176 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
LEAF GAME No. 6 
A leaf is pinned upon each child’s waist as in the 
previous game. The children sing :— 
“Fly away, fly away, 
Dear little —— leaf, fly away ; 
Over the brown fields dance and play, 
But come back to see us again to-day. 
Come back, —— leaf. 
Come back, —— leaf.” 
(Tune, “Milkweed Babies,” Primary Education, October, 1902.) 
— ELEANOR TROXELL. 
As soon as the name of a leaf is sung, the child 
who wears that leaf flies about the room. The chil- 
dren at their seats sing “Come back,” etc., beckoning 
at the same time to the “ little leaf” flying about. 
VIII 
A NUT GAME 
Different kinds of nuts are scattered about the 
room. One of the children who knows the names 
of all the nuts is the mother squirrel. The other 
children are the little squirrels. The mother sends 
one little squirrel out to find walnuts, another to find 
beechnuts, another to find hickory nuts, etc. If one 
brings back the wrong nut, he must return it to the

place where he found it, and another little squirrel is 
then sent with him to find the nut which he was 
asked to find. See how many can find all the nuts 
called for, without making a mistake or having to be 
helped.

How many like apples? What kind do you like

that some like sweet apples; others, sour apples, 
juicy apples, mealy apples, apples that have a spicy 
taste, etc. Nearly every taste can be suited in apples, 
therefore many people eat them.) 
Do you eat the whole apple? What part do you 
throw away? (The skin, perhaps, and the core.) 
N
-P-A-G-E-190
    178 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
Many people, however, eat the skin. Did you ever 
eat a core? How do you like it? What trouble does 
eating a core sometimes give you? (The scales of 
the cells stick in the throat.) What is the use of 
these scales? Let us examine these apple cores. 
(The scales make rooms for the seeds.) How many 
scales does it take to make one room? How are the 
scales fitted together? How many seeds inside a 
room? (The children will find that the numbers 
differ.) Describe the inside of the room. How are 
the seeds packed in it? (They will notice that the 
pointed end of every seed points toward the center.) 
Of what use are the scales to the seeds? (They shut 
them away from the rest of the apple, keeping them 
safe, no matter how juicy the apple or watery the 
core.) Give to each child an apple cut horizontally 
through the center. How many rooms in each apple 
core? Notice how the five rooms are arranged about 
the center. Show at the board. 
With what are these rooms surrounded? Of what 
use is the pulp to the seeds? (It shuts them in until 
they (and the pulp as well) are ripe.) What other 
uses for the pulp? 
Now it is strange that the part of the apple that 
you do not care about—the seeds in the core—the
-P-A-G-E-191
  THE APPLE 179 
apple tree cares most for and has taken the greatest 
of pains to protect. Can you think why? (That the 
seeds may make more apple trees.) Is it or is it not 
well for the seeds that you like the pulp? (By eat- 
ing the pulp from the core the apple seeds are set 
free; they could not grow inside the apple.) Why is 
it well for apple seeds that there are many different 
kinds of apples? (They suit the different tastes’ of 
different people, and so a large number of people all 
over the country are setting apple seeds free.) What 
other uses are made of the pulp? (It is stewed, fried, 
made into pies, dumplings, salads, jelly, preserves, 
etc., and it is dried.) 
What besides people like apples? Do the chickens 
eat the seeds? Find out if this is so. What part of 
the apple do the pigs eat? What eat the apples that 
are left on the trees in the winter? 
How do the apples make known to us that their 
seeds are ripe and ready to be set free? (Their 
bright colors — red, yellow, green, and russet-brown — 
attract us.) How can the green apples attract us 
while the leaves are still green? (They are glossy 
and are of a different shade of green from the leaves.) 
What gives the color to the apple? (Its skin.) De- 
scribe the skin. (It is thin, smooth, glossy, tough,
-P-A-G-E-192
  180 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
and somewhat elastic.) Of what use is it other than 
being the sign which says, “I am ripe”? (It holds 
the pulp in shape, keeps it from being broken and 
rubbed off, holds in the juice.) Why is it well that 
it is somewhat elastic? (It does not readily crack 
when the apple falls.) 
How is the apple fastened to the twig? To what 
part of the twig is it fastened? Notice the stem. 
Chew it a little. Of what is it made? (Of many 
little threads or fibers.) These are much stronger 
than one large single piece would be. 
What color are the apples before they are ripe? 
Why do you think this is well? (They are of nearly 
the same shade as the leaves, and so are not noticed 
much by people who are passing and by birds.) 
What is the color of the seeds of an unripe apple? 
How does the pulp feel ? 
How do the apples begin life? We will find this 
out next spring. We will begin watching a tree now 
—and look at it every week until we find some little 
apples. What do you see on the tree now? (Buds.) 
Describe the buds. 
Note.— Before the subject is left, review it thoroughly. Have 
the children tell all they have learned about the seeds; their 
rooms; the pulp; the skin; the stem.

THE AUSTRIAN PINE 181

THE AUSTRIAN PINE 
(A Winter Stupy) 
Did the Christmas tree surprise you on Christ- 
mas eve? What did it bring you that you did 
not expect? When the presents were all off and 
the decorations removed, had it any more sur- 
prises for you? You did not care for the bare 
tree, then. This bare tree which is sometimes used 
as a Christmas tree has greater surprises for you 
than the presents gave. It is full of secrets which 
few people find out. Would you like to find some 
of them out, all by yourselves? 
But we must become better acquainted with 
the tree before we expect it to tell us any secrets, 
and we will visit one that has not been cut down. 
What kind of tree was the Christmas tree? 
Why was an evergreen chosen? What was its 
name? Do you think all evergreen trees are alike? 
[The children find out by examining the foliage of 
different evergreen trees that they differ greatly. 
Other differences will be discovered later.] 
We will visit the tree with the long, stiff 
needles. I will introduce you to it. Austrian  
-P-A-G-E-194
  182 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
Pine, these are my little boys and girls who wish 
to visit you often. 
On this first day the children learn to distin- 
guish the Austrian pine from other evergreen 
trees by its general appearance. They know it 
by the shade of green of its dress; by its straight, 
pointed trunk ; by its arms or branches, which extend 
out nearly straight from the trunk, then curve up- 
ward; by several branches starting out from 
the same circle and reaching out in different di- 
rections; by gradual shortening of the branches 
from below upward. After learning to recognize 
the tree readily, the children make drawings, 
showing its general shape. This is the picture of 
the naked tree as it looked after it had lost its 
leaves in the story of “The Unhappy Pine Tree.” } 
Is it pretty? What gives beauty to the tree? Its 
' dress. And this is a wonderful dress. Let us 
see of what it is made. [Each child has a small 
twig.] (It is made of needles. And the needles 
are put up in bundles, only two in a bundle. The 
wrapper which holds them together is around one 
end only.)

Publishing Company, Bloomington, Illinois,
-P-A-G-E-195
  THE AUSTRIAN PINE 183 
Let us look at one needle. [The children measure 
it.] It is longer than a darning needle and of differ- 
ent shape, being round on the outside and nearly flat 
on the inside. It is very strong. We can hardly 
pull it in two. Is it well that the pine tree has such 
needles? [Refer to the story of “ The Unhappy Pine 
Tree.” ] Not only goats but caterpillars and insects 
usually pass the leaves of this tree by. Hail, snow, 
and sleet cannot injure them much. Why not? 
Pull out one pair of needles. [The children 
find that it is set very deeply and firmly into the 
twig.] Why is this well? [The children discover 
that the needles in a package so fit together as to 
resemble in shape a darning needle.] Where on the 
twig are they set? Do you like that arrangement? 
Why? Does the Austrian pine ever lose its leaves 
as do the maples and oaks? How do you know? 
When do they fall? Do they fall singly or in pairs? 
What color are they when they fall? Do you see 
any such on the tree now? If so, where? How old 
are the needles when they fall? You cannot tell 
now. You do not know it well enough yet to find 
out a// its secrets. Now tell all the secrets you do 
know about the package of needles. Make a drawing 
of them. What secret has the tree failed to tell you?
-P-A-G-E-196
    184 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
We have been talking about the Austrian pine’s 
dress. Does it wear any ornaments? (The cones.) 
Where does it wear them? Notice this carefully. 
Are they all alike? [Have twigs in the class with 
cones of last summer’s growth and others a year 
older.] Notice color and size of each, the number in 
a cluster (if you are so fortunate as to find two or 
three together). Notice cones under the trees and 
compare them with those on the twig. Do you find 
on the ground any of the little cones? Why not? 
Their work is not done. The leaves on the elms and 
maples did not leave the tree until their work was 
done, neither will the little cones. 
Let us see if we can find out what the work of the 
cones is. The cones that have seen two summers 
are chosen. Where on the twig did we find them? 
Draw the cone when first brought into the room. 
Draw also the twig with the cone upon it, fixing its 
place on the twig. [The children notice the queer 
shapes of the doors with their comical little knobs; 
they also notice how each door is braced in front by 
two doors at its side and one before it. The doors 
are very many, and are closed so tightly that it is 
with great trouble that we get them open.] Will 
the cone not let us know what she is guarding so
-P-A-G-E-197
  
THE AUSTRIAN PINE 185 
carefully? We will not break into her house. We 
will lay these cones where we can watch them. [If 
possible, the children should hear and see the doors 
pop open. This will happen after they have been 
in the warm room a few hours.] Now that the 
cone has opened her doors we will look in and see 
if we can find what secret she was keeping. [The 
children discover two little seeds behind each door, 
each with a large wing.] How cozily they lie in the 
little room! They are well worth guarding. Why? 
Why were they shut in so tightly? What will open 
the doors of the cones on the trees? (The sun.) 
When will they open? What will the seeds do 
then? How will the wing help them? The tiny 
cones are placed also in the warm room and left 
there for some time. Why do they not open? 
Some old cones may be found with their doors 
open. Inside are no good seeds. Why is that so? 
(The seeds flew away last spring when the warm sun 
opened the doors.) [The children now make a draw- 
ing of the twig with cones of two sizes. They tell 
the secrets of the cones. They draw a single door 
with the two seeds, and one seed by itself, and tell 
the secret of the seeds. A number of seeds are kept 
for planting when spring shall come. ]
-P-A-G-E-198
  186 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
What else do we find on the branch besides leaves 
and cones? (Buds.) On what part of the twig do 
you find these buds? Are all of the same shape? 
[The children find that some are large and pointed, 
others are round and flat, while others are made up 
of a cluster of little buds.] Why this difference? 
Let us see if we can find out. [A pointed bud is first 
examined. The children notice how the lower scales 
curve downward. (If kept in a warm room, more of 
the scales will turn down.) They also notice the 
great number of coverings.] Are they thick or 
thin? Soft or harsh? How arranged? All of the 
same length? How held together? [The pitch 
shows itself after being kept in a warm room some 
time.] The covers being carefully removed, the 
children are delighted to find what they think 
is a cone. But where on the twig did we find 
the cones? (On the szdes, but this is directly at the 
end.) What does grow at the end of a twig? 
Leaves on a stem. What then should you expect 
to find in this bud? We will put this little bare bud, ’ 
with a covered one, into this bottle of alcohol. It’ 
will keep them fresh. How shall we label it? We 
will say we do not vow what this is. But what do 
you think it ought to be? It is another secret which
-P-A-G-E-199
THE AUSTRIAN PINE 187 
we can not find out until we know the tree better. 
What was the first secret kept from us? When may 
we surely know the secret of the bud? Tell the 
secrets which you know of the pointed buds, and 
the one which the tree is keeping from you, but 
which you think you can guess. 
Now, let us see if we can find out the secret of the 
round, flat buds. [The children find that the outside 
covers are much like those of the pointed buds, but 
inside of a few covers they find from five to ten tiny 
buds crowded all the way around a small, pointed 
bud. The inside covers are soft and transparent. 
When uncovered, the children are apt to think they 
have again found cones.] But where do we find 
these buds? Do you find such clusters of cones on 
the tree? [The children notice the resemblance be- 
tween the pointed bud in the center here and the 
pointed bud we examined before. They tell what 
they think this bud contains and what they think 
may grow from the center bud.] The naked, tiny 
buds are placed in alcohol with a bud as we found it 
on the tree. What shall we label it? 
There is still another kind of bud, a clustered 
bud, not covered to appear like a single bud as was 
the preceding. Does it contain a pointed bud?
-P-A-G-E-200
  188 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
Where on the twig was it found? On what kind of 
twig? [These buds are also preserved.] Are there 
any other kinds of buds? [The bottles of buds are 
numbered, and the children from now till spring 
frequently review their knowledge of these buds 
and their suppositions in regard to them. ] 
This branch on which the needles and buds 
and cones grew may have something to tell us. 
Notice carefully the curled-back covers of this 
pointed bud. Do you find anything like this on 
the twig? Where? How do you suppose those scales 
came there? [The children are quick to catch the 
idea that the bud left them when it began to 
grow.] What did it grow into? (A little twig.) 
How long? [The children usually suggest that 
that is exactly what this pointed bud will grow 
into.] If so, what must that be in the pointed bud? 
(A little twig packed away in a very small trunk.) 
And what was the green that you saw in the 
bud? (The leaves.) How long did it take this 
three or four inches of twig to grow? (A year.) 
[The children see that it must have taken many 
years for the tree to become so large at that rate 
of growth.] Look back and see if you can find 
where another bud started. How old is that part
-P-A-G-E-201
  THE AUSTRIAN PINE 189 
of the twig? ind another year’s growth. An- 
other. Still another. Are there leaves on last 
year’s growth? On the second? On the third? 
On the fourth? On the fifth? [Sometimes they 
will find the leaves mostly or wholly gone from 
the five years’ growth, and sometimes there are 
leaves on the six-year-old twig.] Where did the 
brown leaves go? How old when they fell? What 
did they leave behind to show that they had been 
here? (A queer little three-cornered card, often 
turned down at the top.) 
Notice the twigs with the round flat buds, or the 
large clustered ones. [The children find the year’s 
growth there to measure only from three fourths of 
an inch to an inch.] Why so much shorter than on 
twigs with long pointed buds? (Its food had to be 
divided with those little stranger buds that clustered 
around it, so it could not grow so much.) 
Did you ever try to break a twig or a branch 
from an Austrian pine? Was it easily done? After 
a snow storm the teacher takes occasion to call 
the attention of the children to the beautiful but 
sad appearance of the tree. Its branches no more 
reach up toward the sky, but droop to the earth. 
It seems as if the tree could never hold itself up
-P-A-G-E-202
  I90 NATURE STUDY LESSONS FOR PRIMARY GRADES 
as it did before the storm. The children make a 
drawing of it now and compare this picture with 
the first one drawn. Why does not the heavy 
snow break off the branches? Show sections of 
the tree where branches have grown out, that the 
children may see how well the tree guards against 
such accidents. 
What secrets have you found out about the twig 
and branch? You may draw a branch of seven years’ 
growth. [If they have observed carefully they 
will put no needles on the oldest growth, and per- 
haps none on the sixth or fifth.] But here are side 
shoots. From what did they come? Notice where 
they start out. From what buds did they come? 
Can you tell? Then we must also find this out next 
spring. Can you tell yet from what the cones will 
come? We shall have to watch the tree closely next 
spring, else it will keep this secret from us. Now 
what are all the secrets which the Austrian pine is 
keeping from us this winter? 
Do you like this tree? What do you like about 
it? It is a useful tree, too. For what is it used? 
(For lumber.) [Children name articles made from 
pine.] (The birds come to its shelter when they 
return early in the spring. The winter birds —  
-P-A-G-E-203
  THE AUSTRIAN PINE Ig! 
crows, owls, etc., — spend much time in its branches, 
which shelter them from the cold winds.) 
As a summing up of many facts discovered in 
regard to the Austrian pine, and a reminder of 
their pleasant acquaintance with it, a collection 
of the following may be mounted on stiff card- 
board: A pair of green leaves, a pointed bud, a 
round flat bud, an open clustered bud, cones of 
one, two, and three seasons’ growth (the cone 
of two seasons will need to be varnished to keep 
it from opening), a cone scale, two seeds, a bare 
twig, a twig with leaves, cross and vertical sections 
of the wood.

A HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN THE UNITED 
STATES $2.00 Net 
By EDWIN GRANT DEXTER, Ph.D. 
Professor of Education in the University of Illinois 
This new work has been prepared in the belief that the greatest 
need of the student of our educational history is a considerable mass of 
definite fact upon which to base his own generalizations, or with which 
to interpret those of others, rather than extended philosophical discus- 
sions of historical trend. Current educational literature is rich in the 
latter, though comparatively barren of the former, The present book 
deals, therefore, with the fact rather than with the philosophy of educa- 
tion in the United States. It contains an exceptionally valuable equip- 
ment of references and bibliographies, 
THE PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION $1.50 Net 
By HERMAN HARRELL HORNE, Ph.D. 
Assistant Professor of Philosophy and Pedagogy in Dartmouth 
College 
This volume is a connected series of discussions on the foundations 
of education in the related sciences of biology, physiology, sociology, 
psychology, and philosophy. It is not another of the many current 
manuals of practice, but a thorough-going interpretation of the nature, 
place, and meaning of education in our world. The newest points 
of view in the realms of natural and mental science are applied to 
the understanding of educational problems, The field of education is 
carefully divided, and the total discussion is devoted to the philosophy 
of education, in distinction from its history, science, and art. The 
conceptions of evolution, society, and genetic psychology shed their 
light upon educational phenomena, yielding in the end a comprehen- 
sive definition of what education is. The various conflicting modern 
educational opinions are organized to a considerable extent, and are 
made to appear as partial truths of a common system. The whole 
is suffused with the spirit of an idealistic philosophy in which edu- 
cation is finally made to yield its ultimate meaning as to the origin, 
nature, and destiny of man.

.A MODERN SCHOOL 
$1.25 Net 
By PAUL H. HANUS 
Professor of the History and Art of Teaching in Harvard University 
Author of “Educational Aims and Educational Values,” etc, 
The chapters of which this volume consists, except the last, deal 
with various phases of one central theme: the scope and aims of a 
modern school, and the conditions essential to its highest efficiency. 
The last chapter offers some testimony on the working of the elective 
system, —a contemporary question of great importance to both schools 
and colleges, — but the testimony offered pertains only to the college. 
The first chapter deals specifically with the secondary school; and in 
it the author has endeavored to extend and strengthen certain concep- 
tions set forth in his earlier book, The next seven chapters contain a 
fuller treatment of certain topics than was appropriate or expedient in 
the first chapter, and discuss the internal and external conditions essen- 
tial to a high degree of success in the work of any school.

the story of the pioneer life of all sections of our country, from the 
epoch-making voyages of Columbus to Major Powell’s marvellous jour- 
ney through the Grand Cafion of the Colorado, The stories are com- 
plete and interesting, making the experiences of pioneer life as graphic 
and real as possible. Indeed, the text is made up largely of source 
materials. These narratives, which are accompanied by admirable 
maps and illustrations, constitute the best of all introductions for chil-

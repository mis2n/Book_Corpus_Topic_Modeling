One of the most difficult sanitary lessons to learn 
is that tolerance of evil conditions is not proof that 
the conditions are not evil.

organism than when brought to bear on the adult.”

  SANITATION IN DAILY LIFE 
PROLOGUE 
ANITARY science teaches that mode of life which 
promotes health and efficiency. 
The individual is one of a community influencing 
and influenced by the common environment. 
Human ecology is the study of the surroundings of 
human beings in the effects they produce on the lives 
of men. The features of the environment are natural, 
as climate, and artificial, produced by human activity, 
as noise, dust, poisonous vapors, vitiated air, dirty water, 
and unclean food. 
The study of this environment is in two chief lines: 
First, what *% often called municipal housekeeping— 
the co-operation of the citizens in securing clean streets, 
the suppression of nuisances, abundant water supply, 
market inspection, etc. 
Second, family housekeeping. The healthful home 
demands a management of the house which shall pro- 
mote vigorous life and prevent the physical deteriora- 
tion so evident under modern conditions. 
The close interrelation of these two parts of sani- 
tation should be borne in mind. Even if a-man has 
been so blessed as to be born into favorable conditions,

he must nevertheless face the problem of retaining health 
and strength under the strain of modern progress and 
civilization. Formerly a man’s occupation in the fields 
and woods kept him in health, but now he must ordi- 
narily give what strength he has to his occupation, and 
rely upon other sources from which to secure a healthy 
bedy.* It is possible to understand the effect that is 
produced by unfavorable environment, if we compare 
the difference in physical stature between the Scotch 
agricultural worker and the inhabitant of certain manu- 
facturing towns in England. There is an average of 
five inches in height and thirty-one pounds in weight in 
favor of the Scotchman. H. G. Wells, in speaking of the 
responsibility for man’s physical efficiency, compares 
the city dweller in crowded streets and tenements with 
the man living in the freer, more open country, and 
makes the difference from three and one-half to five 
inches in stature and from twenty to thirty pounds in 
weight in favor of the country dweller? The former 
belongs to the physically unfit for the struggle of life. 
A casual observer visiting the poorer parts of one of 
our large cities must necessarily be impressed with the 
stunted appearance of the children on the streets. 
Since physical strength and power have always been 
desired by-man; and since, in these modern days, women 
wish to be not far behind their brothers in endurance, 
the facts just given should furnish food for serious 
thought as to the means of acquiring a body physically

fit, capable of securing the greatest capacity for work 
and for play—for life. 
Is this physical fitness and consequent mental power 
so good a thing, so desirable, that the pupils in our 
schools and colleges are ready to give their attention to 
habits of right living when the methods of acquiring 
these habits are presented to them? Is it worth their 
while? Let the habits be once acquired, then the atten- 
tion may be turned in other directions. It has been said, 
“Sow a habit and reap a character.” This is true of the 
physical and mental as of the moral. Habits become 
fixed. It is necessary, then, that they be good habits. 
Right habits of living are the foundations of health of 
body and_ mind. , 
To secure and maintain a safe environment there 
must be inculcated habits of using the material things 
in daily life in such a way as to promote and not to 
diminish health. Avoid spitting in the streets, avoid 
throwing refuse on the sidewalk, avoid dust and bad air 
in the house and sleeping room, etc. 
It is, however, of the greatest importance that every 
one should acquire such habits of belief in the impor- 
tance of this material environment as shall lead him to 
insist upon sanitary regulations, and to see that they are 
carried out. 
What touches my neighbor, touches me. For my 
sake, and for his, the city inspector and the city garbage 
cart visit us, and I keep my premises in such a condition 
as I expect him to strive for. 
The first law of sanitation requires quick removal 
and destruction of all wastes—of things done with.
-P-A-G-E-9
viii Sanitation in Daily Life 
The second law enjoins such use of the air, water, 
and food necessary to life that the person may be in a 
state of health and efficiency. 
This right use depends so largely upon habit that a 
great portion of sanitary teaching must be given to in- 
culcating right and safe ways in daily life.

CHAPTER I 
SANITATION. CLEANNESS 
“Science stands . . . holding out resources, devices, and 
remedies we are too stupid to use.” — H. G. Wells. 
© be clean is to be free from foreign or undesirable 
matter. Dirt is not always dangerous, but it is 
always undesirable. The smouch on one’s nose, the 
greasy finger marks on one’s book are foreign matter. 
The old definition of dirt is “matter in the wrong 
place.” We do not avoid the man who has been deliv- 
ering charcoal because he is dangerous, but because con- 
tact with him makes work, or does not improve our 
appearance. If we meet a man with smallpox or a 
child with scarlet fever we shun him because he is dan- 
gerous. His skin is dirty in a different sense; it carries 
little organisms which will grow on our skins if once 
‘established there, so that we shall be sick and perhaps 
die. 
We forbid the man with tuberculosis, or the child 
_ with diphtheria, to spit in the street, or to touch us, or 
“our pencils, or books, or our food, because the little 
plants which have made him diseased will grow in our 
sown throats and lungs if once established there. We 
gish to keep them out, just as we wish the charcoal man 
3 keep away from us, but for a different reason. The 
person with a contagion like smallpox or scarlet fever, 
an infectious disease like diphtheria or typhoid fever, 
I

2 Sanitation in Daily Life 
is a dangerous person because he carries living microbes 
which we do not wish to get into our clean bodies. 
There are many kinds of tiny organisms doing their 
wholesome work of turning waste matter into useful 
substances, true sanitarians obeying the first law of 
sanitation to get rid of all useless matter. Working in 
all refuse heaps, all wet gutters, all dirty corners, and 
on all damp, dirty clothes are these tiny organisms which 
we do not wish to have on our faces, or in our throats 
or noses. When these are dry they blow about the 
streets; fill houses, cars, shops; settle on books, desks, 
and banisters. They are wiped up by warm, moist 
hands, which carry them to food, mouth, eyes, noses. 
Soon some disease may set -in because, among these 
microbes, a few disease germs were carried. 
One of the best instances of danger in dirt is that 
of the tetanus bacillus or the germ that causes lockjaw. 
It is very common in garden dirt, and that many persons 
carry it on the unclean skin is proved by the frequency 
with which it develops in cases where the clothing over 
the injury has not been torn. . 
Infact, one never can tell when dust is what is often 
called “clean dirt” and when it is dangerous; therefore, 
avoid all dust. Keep the mouth shut when in any dusty 
place. Alas! all places are dusty if one could only real- 
ize it! The white beam’ of the search light at night, 
the stream of particles seen in a dark room when a beam 
of sunlight is let in, show us now and then what is there 
all the time. 
Sanitation is keeping clean, not merely cleaning up 
and disinfecting, which seems to. be the common idea.
-P-A-G-E-14
Sanitation. Cleanness 3 
A place which smells of chemicals is popularly supposed 
to be sanitary. The really healthful spot is one without 
odors and without any matter out of place. Personal 
cleanliness takes on a new meaning and all the daily 
operations of the jhouse and school and city are elevated 
into the region of scientific. work, done according to well- 
known laws. Sweeping and cleaning and laundry work 
are all processes of sanitation and not mere drudgery im- 
posed by tradition, as some people seem to think. The 
experience of the race has taught a practice, the reason 
for which science is only now explaining. . 
Where there is a question of clean hands, clean fin- 
ger nails, clean clothes, or clean shoes, one should never 
say that anything is too much trouble. 
ILLustTRATIVE EXPERIMENTS 
1. Darken the room as for a stereopticon lecture 
and allow a beam of sunlight, or electric light, to enter 
through a small orifice in as nearly horizontal direction 
as possible, so as to be visible across at least half the 
room. The more dust in the air, the brighter will be 
the beam. 
- Any movement of the audience, stamping on the 
floor or brushing of clothes, will perceptibly increase. 
the brightness of the beam. 
2. To prove that this dust is not all sand or soot, 
procure, from the bacteriologist several prepared Petri 
dishes: Place one on the desk, or table, or chair, under 
this beam of visible dust. Take off the cover for 3 
minutes or more, replace the cover and set away at room
-P-A-G-E-15
4 Sanitation in Daily Life 
temperature for 36 to 48 hours. At the end of this 
time numerous colonies will have spread themselves in 
the stiff jelly. Numberless variations of this experiment 
will occur to the teacher. . 
It is advisable to give each student at some time, if 
not to all at once, two prepared dishes to take home, one 
to be exposed when the room chosen has been quiet, or 
thoroughly cleaned, at least 2 hours before, and one 
after disturbance has “raised” the dust. 
3. To show the efficient way to get rid of dust, 
choose a suitable room, have it swept, and set the class 
the experiment of dusting it with (1) a feather duster, 
and (2) a dry cloth, as janitors and housemaids usually 
do the work. Expose prepared dishes at the end of 10 
minutes, half an hour, 1 hour, 2 hours. (3) The same 
room swept in the same manner dusted with a dampened 
- duster, not a wet one. Repeat the tests. Keep careful 
records, when possible photographic records. 
[To show how dust is carried on hands, a finger 
print made on a Petri dish, or a swab taken from the 
nose, if a physician or bacteriologist is at hand to ex- 
plain, will give a culture which will be remembered 
always.] 
It is not necessary to determine the names of the 
plants growing in these colonies. The purpose of the 
experiments is simply to prove that the dry, ordinarily 
invisible dust which we breathe does contain living or- 
ganisms and possible sources of harm. 
The number and variety of the experiments to be 
made in the growth of dust organisms will depend upon 
the individual conditions and the interest of the pupils.
-P-A-G-E-16
Sanitation. Cleanness 5 
The aim should be not to alarm nor. merely to amuse, 
but to convince the pupils: 
That cleanliness is a scientifically established need. 
That cleanliness is a difficult but not impossible con- 
dition. 
That it is easier to keep clean than to get clean. 
That hands are carriers and should be carefully © 
guarded. : 
It is not intended that these experiments shall be 
more than illustrative. It will be a mistake to.go into 
the bacteriologist’s department and attempt to make 
“cultures.” It will be dangerous to deal with disease 
germs in a general lesson. 
The experiments should be kept within the bounds of 
illustration of the principle and of confirmation of the 
facts stated. Ocular demonstration is a great fixative 
of ideas. 
, THE DAMPENED DUSTER 
Wring out a towel, or any piece of thick cloth, from 
clean water; if warm, so much the better. Spread this 
out smoothly ; on it place the cloths to be’ used as dusters, 
four to six thicknesses. Roll the whole compactly and 
allow to remain half an hour. When taken out the 
dusters should not seem wet; if they are, shake out and 
hang yp a few minutes. A dampened duster is one that 
seems dry to the uninitiated. 
v PETRI DISHES 
It is a saving of time to secure from a bacteriologist 
the prepared jelly to use in the sterilized Petri dishes,
-P-A-G-E-17
6 Sanitation in Daily Life 
but the material may be prepared in the chemical labora- 
tory or, with sufficient care, at home. 
The Petri dishes are simply flat glass dishes of con- 
venient size, with covers of thin glass, so that the colonies 
of germs which grow in the transparent medium may be 
seen and counted. They may be bought at a supply 
store for bacteriological apparatus, and after using may 
be cleansed. They are sterilized for further use by bak- 
ing, as follows: Place them, with covers on, in a pan in a 
cooloven. Slowly raise the temperature to about 300° F., 
a temperature for baking bread or for yellowing a piece 
of paper in half a minute; open the door, draw the pan 
to the front, allow the temperature to cool as slowly as 
it was raised, to avoid the cracking of the glass. When 
the pan is cool enough to take up with the bare fingers, 
remove to a table and allow to cool to room tempera- 
ture; then place a rubber band over the cover and dish 
and set away for use. As the least exposure in any 
place is liable to collect dust, the coyer is kept on the 
dish. 
To prepare a stiff, but not too stiff, transparent me- 
dium in which germs will grow has been the study of 
many laboratories for many years and improvements are’ 
constantly made. 
In general, it may be said that the organisms are 
planted in nutritive media which favor their rapid 
growth, which are transparent, and are solid enough to 
keep the different individuals apart when first sown, but 
which permit the new growth to form clusters or colo- 
nies that may be counted. 
Beef broth is the common basis, made from lean beef,
-P-A-G-E-18
Sanitation. Cleanness 7 
free from fat and gristle, finely minced, soaked, and 
finally heated in water, filtered through folds of muslin, 
cheese cloth, or cotton flannel into test tubes plugged 
with cotton wool and sterilized. The heat penetrates 
readily the short distance required in the test tube. 
The broth is stiffened after filtration and before ster- 
ilization by the addition of gelatine, 100 grams to the 
liter, or by agar, a seaweed generally obtained in dried 
strips from the Japanese market, 10 to 15 grams per liter. 
For anaérobic organisms 1 or 2 per cent. of grape sugar 
is added to make glucose broth. 
The Standard Methods of the American Public 
Health Association will be found in Prescott & Wins- 
low’s “Elements of Water Bacteriology.” In brief, pre- 
pared lean beef is soaked over night in the refrigerator, 
500 grams (one pound) to 1 liter of ‘water, strained 
through cotton flannel, the other ingredients added, the 
whole sterilized by heating over boiling water or steam 
for 30 minutes. Filter again through absorbent cotton 
and cotton flannel until perfectly clear, then prepare the 
test tubes previously cleaned and sterilized, putting § c.c. 
into each tube and plugging with sterilized absorbent 
cotton, Since there has been unavoidable exposure to 
dusty air and by handling, these tubes are set upright in 
a rack and sterilized 30 minutes in steam on three suc- 
cessive days. They are then ready to store in the ice 
chest until wanted. 
The following recipe is excellent for home use or for 
rural schools: 
“For the soil take the following recipe: Chop finely 
one-quarter pound of lean, juicy beef. Mix this with

I cup of warm water. Heat in double boiler, stirring 
often until water in water pan has boiled 15 minutes. 
Remove inner dish, place directly over the fire, and allow 
broth to boil 10 or 15 minutes. Clean by straining 
through two or more thicknesses of cotton flannel wet in 
cold water. Squeeze the meat carefully to get out all its 
juices but not much fat. The meat is acid, therefore 
add from one-eighth to one-quarter teaspoonful of bi- 
carbonate of soda. Replace the water lost through 
evaporation. 
“Moisten 3 heaping tablespoonfuls of finely divided 
gelatine in a very little cold water and add to the boil- 
ing hot broth. When the gelatine is dissolved, strain 
through hot flannel. 
“Put 3 or 4 tablespoonfuls of the broth into each of 
several small bottles. Plug the mouth of each with a 
close wad of cotton wool, or tie over each a thick mat 
of the same. For three successive days place the bottles 
upright on a piece of folded cloth in a pan of cold water 
and boil them 15 minutes.” +

CHAPTER II 
THE CLEAN CITY 
+.“ We suffer from disease through ignorance. We escape 
through knowledge.” — Benjamin Ward Richardson. % - 
HE eagle in his mountain aerie has as clean a home 
as the world affords. There are only cosmic dust, 
ashes of volcanoes, pollen from trees, with now and then 
a spore of some moss or lichen in the air he breathes. 
The explorer in the arctic regions never “takes cold,” for 
there are no germs to cause the catarrh. 
The country dweller on a large farm need not breathe 
bad air if he would live out of doors and sleep with wide 
open windows. 
But the city dweller is at the mercy of the Careless 
habits of thousands of his fellow-beings, and of the cease- 
less grinding of streets into powder, and of dust from all 
things subject to wear, from clothing to iron rails.. An 
examination of the air of the New York subway showed 
the solid dirt sifted from it to contain sixty per cent. of 
iron dust. 
As long as we must go to and fro to work, to school, 
to shop, we are subjected to the city ideal of cleanliness. 
We should be helpless if it was not’ possible for each one 
of us to have a voice and influence in community life. 
Public opinion could stop the sweeping of house, 
shop, and schoolhouse dust into the street, could de- 
9
-P-A-G-E-23
10 : Sanitation in Daily Life 
mand suitable receptacles for it, and could insist upon 
crematories for all wastes. 
The point of this lesson is: each should do his share 
in making a clean city; each should dispose of his own 
wastes in a manner safe not only for himself, but for his 
neighbor. Then only has he a right to insist that his 
neighbor do the same. 
Tt is safe to say that two-thirds.of the work of clean- 
ing up is needless work, and so in itself waste, and that 
the danger is increased tenfold by the delay in getting . 
rid of the decomposing materials. 
Observe the reprehensible habit of tossing banana 
skins, lunch papers, envelopes, into the street or onto a 
vacant lot. Observe the rubbish along one block of a 
city street or one-quarter mile of a village street, or in 
the yard of a farmhouse. It is human hands that cast 
away used things to the peril of their neighbors’ lives. 
A social conscience must be developed to cause each 
one to refrain from menacing his neighbor 
By “the clean city” is meant all the environment com- 
mon to the community and beyond individual control. 
Climate is beyond community control except in so far as 
very limited modification of dry weather may be made by 
abundant use of water. We must bear heat and cold, 
snow and fog, in the place in which we find ourselves. 
But intelligent man need not suffer if he will learn what 
the different conditions require. If man will use the 
knowledge he may gain, he can protect himself, under 
nearly all circumstances. 
An excellent illustration of the value of sanitation 
‘is given by the control of malaria and yellow fever. Not
-P-A-G-E-24
The Clean City “oa 
many years ago a malarial or yellow fever country was 
avoided as a necessarily dangerous ‘region. Now our 
men are living in health and comfort in several such 
countries, Cuba, the Philippines, and Panama. ‘A certain 
kind of mosquito was found to bea carrier of ‘disease, 
and in order to’make these countries inhabi ble the au- 
thorities needed only to combine to stop ‘the breeding of 
the pests, by draigjng marshes, covering pools with kero- 
sene, and by screening houses to keep out the strays. 
It is conclusively proved that a united effort to exter- 
minate the mosquito, to prevent the breeding of flies by 
leaving no manure-piles and no heaps of dirt, to get rid 
of fleas, etc., may improve the health of the community 
in a marked degree. 
Just as soon as the taxpayer realizes the saving in 
money by the l@ngthening of life and. lessening the ex- 
pense involved in sickness, he will be willing to have 
money used by public authorities for these purposes. 
To repeat: the range of temperature, humidity, and sun- 
shine is independent of man. Not so, however, is the 
presence of stagnant pools of water to breed mosquitoes, 
or of piles of rubbish to scatter dust and breed flies and 
harbor rats. 
For all common pathways of the community—roads, 
streets, alleys, and sidewalks; for all public buildings— 
city halls and schoolhouses; for all places frequented by 
large numbers—parks, markets, bathhouses, boat piers, 
railroad stations, street cars and steam cars, the com- 
munity must be responsible. The condition of these 
public places of concourse and conveyance reflects the 
sanitary standards of the community. A stranger may
-P-A-G-E-25
12 Sanitation in Daily Life 
tell at a glance how far in the scale of cleanliness a given 
town has risen. The village store and post office, for 
instance, are good evidence. It is the accumulated waste 
of the many that makes the offensive mass and convicts 
them of breaking the first law of sanitation—quick re- 
moval of all that“is done with. 
A few words-on €ach of these things used in common 
by all the people of a locality will suggest others which 
may be followed up. Parks, markets, publit gathering 
places, sidewalks, public pathways, have important sani- 
tary effect in two ways. Dried sputum, excrement, de- 
cayed food or refuse may be lifted by the wind and 
scattered over a radius of several miles; not only onto 
other streets, but onto the roofs of houses to be washed 
into cisterns; into markets to fall on fruit and meats; 
into the windows of houses to be breathe@l by the inmates. 
When such material is wet with rain, or dampened 
by the watering cart, it may be taken up as mud on the 
shoes of the passer and tracked into clean stores, school- 
houses, etc.; or it may be collected on clothes and stock- 
ings, and so carried into sleeping chambers to be shaken 
out of the window into the air breathed by persons who 
have not been out of the clean yard. 
For these and other reasons, it is a duty of the whole 
community to protect itself by insisting on clean path- 
ways; and a duty of the school and home to insist that 
shoes shall be cleaned and clothes brushed outside their 
doors. 
In parks and squares, receptacles for all waste 
should be provided, and the frequenters should use them. 
This leads to the disposal of the great accumulation 
of waste in a community.
-P-A-G-E-26
The Clean City 13 
The wastes to be disposed of may be roughly grouped 
into three classes: ashes and rubbish; garbage; sewage. 
The ashes and rubbish, broken bottles, paper, tins, 
etc., are not in themselves dangerous, but they collect 
germ-laden dust and blow about; or they hold water to 
breed mosquitoes and are unsightly. They may be used 
on a dump for filling, if they do not there blow about 
and collect water. Such piles are usually picked over 
and all valuable portions saved. If this is done at once, 
and if such rubbish has been kept clean and separate _ 
from garbage and house sweepings, this may not be 
harmful;.but such a dump is usually a menace to the 
whole neighborhood, and a breeding place for mosqui- 
toes. It is on the whole a doubtful savirig. 
Garbage is the perishable waste of kitchen and 
market, bits of raw and cooked foods, bones, vegetables, 
withered flowers. The contents of the kitchen middens 
of the archeological early man were of this character. 
When the heap overtopped it he moved his hut. Modern 
man keeps his house in the same spot, and sends the 
refuse off in a cart to the farmer to feed pigs, or dumps 
it in the sea. 
Because it is perishable, it is food for bacilli and a 
home. of bad smells. Perhaps its worst offense is in 
breeding flies. Like all other wastes, it should be dis- 
posed of before decomposition sets in. Garbage should 
never be dumped in the open or used as filling.’ For iso- 
lated houses, with plenty of land it should be buried in 
loosened soil. For city garbage various schemes of 
utilizing the grease and nitrogen have been proposed, 
and some tried, but from a sanitary point of view it is 
\ 
\
-P-A-G-E-27
14 Sanitation in Daily Life 
better frankly to consider it as waste to be disposed of at 
a cost. 
Sweepings, whether of houses or streets, should be 
burned on account of the danger from disease germs ; 
dried sputa being, at present, a universal ingredient. 
Sewage—the liquefied waste of water-closet, bathtub, 
wash basin, sink and laundry tub—is dirty water with 
only about one per cent. of dirt, but it is a dangerous dirt 
in so many cases that all sewage is suspicious. 
Water carriage complies with the law of quick re- 
moval from houses and city precincts, but its after dis- 
posal is a troublesome problem. In the not far distant 
future all such water will be purified before being dis- 
charged into the sea or into streams. The municipal 
plant at Columbus, Ohio, is one of the best models at 
the present writing. 
‘For the isolated house or institution, sand filtration 
and cultivation is the wisest method to be adopted, not 
necessarily for profit, but for safe conversion into plant 
life. Broad irrigation is a common term. The princi- 
ples so well worked out in arid regions hold here. A 
small catch basin called a septic tank allows the solids 
to liquefy and be washed out and soaked up by the 
porous soil, where the nitrifying plants at once convert 
the nitrogenous matter into nitrates, forming food for 
green plants. 
The necessity for cremation has already been re- 
ferred to. The waste material—paper wrappings, paper 
bags soiled with meat juice or decayed fruit, scraps of 
all kinds—attracts flies and, when moistened, breeds 
germs, molds, and bacteria, some of them harmful to

man, and all meaning decay and filth. The -sweepings : 
of houses and offices, dry lint from clothes, wood chips | 
from pencils, threads, dust, and mud whirled in from 
the street by the breeze, or brought in on shoes, are too 
often. swept into the street or left by the door. 
Scraps of lunch, bones given to dogs, stones and 
skins of fruit, all find their way to the corners by house: 
and sidewalk. The useful microbes do their best’ to get 
all such waste into the form of food for plants, so that 
it will be no longer waste; but meanwhile it is not pleas- 
ant to see or smell decay. All such wastes should ‘be 
burned at once and thus be transformed into plant food 
in the ashes and the gases which are. given off. 
The kitchen wastes are more difficult to dispose of 
because food stuffs have more water, which smothers 
the fire,.causes smoke and a bad odor. 
: Well-constructed crematories, whether of the simple 
‘sort in. the vacant lot or the city plant, have something 
/ of the nature of a shelf on which the wet stuff may dry 
before being thrown into the fire. Most houscholds and 
villages have enough paper and dry waste to burn the 
rest without any other fuel. The one need is a good 
draft, tall chimneys or forced draft, to give air enough 
for complete combustion. It is only incomplete combus- 
tion that gives odors. 
,A.few. years ago this method of getting rid of waste 
would.have been considered wasteful. The paper, then 
made of cotton and linen rags, could be used over, the 
garbage could be fed to pigs and hens. It was then 
thought that the nitrogen was lost if food scraps were 
burned: and the gases sent into the air. It has been

16 Sanitation in Daily Life 
found, however, that clover and pea plants, especially, 
have little bacteria-bearing nodules on their roots which 
can make the nitrogen of the air into nitrates, or a form 
for plant food. Plants take the needed carbon from the 
air, so there is no excuse for allowing refuse to rot rather 
than to burn it. The ashes prove the best of fertilizer. 
On the farm, the kitchen waste may be safely fed to 
pigs and hens, because it may be given to them fresh and 
sweet; but the contents of the garbage pail of the village 
house are not fit food if left for two or three days to 
ferment and decay between deposit and use. 
It may be taken as an axiom that one of the most 
valuable aids in modern sanitation is the well-constructed 
crematory, and as we realize more and more the value of 
pure air we shall burn wastes more quickly. 
We look for the time when most market refuse will 
be left at the largé centers, and when the individual 
housewife will not need to deal with corn husks, cabbage 
leaves, chicken legs, etc. But as long as she has these 
to dispose of, so long she must keep her garbage pail 
washed out and dried whenever emptied. That means 
a second pail, and where shall the washings go? That 
means a can small enough to be washed with soda in the” 
sink. It means, too, that it must be emptied every day.

refer to these here, since they are under expert super- 
vision. in all well-conducted towns. The sanitary dan- 
gers are mostly connected with improper house fixtures, 
which will be considered in the chapter on the house. 
In no one thing do we find more perfect justification 
for stringent sanitary measures than in the case of a 
city milk supply. The death rate of infants is about 
twenty per cent. In a city of 500,000 inhabitants several 
hundred children have been liable to die in a summer, 
almost wholly from bad feeding, and mostly from dirty 
milk. “War is nothing, when it comes to increasing the 
death rate, compared to filthy milk.” Vigorous meas- 
ures by state and town must be used, for the single 
householder is powerless. 
In suburban rural communities, however, each user 
of milk should know how the cows and cow stable from 
which his milk is sent are cared: for. 
Clean milk, if cooled at once and kept cool from 50° 
to 60° F., should keep sweet thirty-six hours at least. 
There should be no sediment in the bottom of the vessel 
in which it stands, and it should have no peculiar taste 
or odor. 
It goes without saying that no preservative should 
be added. To produce clean and safe milk, the stable, 
the cows, the pail, the milker (as to his hands especially), 
all must be scrupulously clean—bacteriologically clean, 
not just clean. In the house, milk should be protected 
from dust. Those who have no cool dark place in which 
to keep milk are at a great disadvantage. Milk is such 
good food for bacteria that they thrive at a prodigious 
rate when the temperature permits their growth. New-

It may be that, just as great pipe lines have been laid 
to carry clean water for 50 to 200 miles and oil for 
greater distances, so pipe lines will be laid to give that 
equally necessary fluid, clean milk, to a large city; but 
at present it must be brought in cans 200 to 300 miles 
and handled two or three times before the consumer 
finds it on his breakfast table. 
Milk differs from oil and water in that it is a perfect 
mixture in which to cultivate many kinds of plants, and 
all seeds-and spores as well as plants must be kept out. 
For discussion of milk see Newman, “Bacteriology and 
the Public Health,” and local bulletins and reports.? 
It has been said that the milk problem is to get done 
what we know how to do, and it is an excellent illustra- 
tion of -the need of co-operation between the individual 
and the community. For instance, the milk cans re- 
turned to the milkman from retail stores, bakeshops, and 
from many private dwellings are in an absolutely filthy 
condition not only from neglect, but because of use for 
improper purposes.

milk should never be used for other purposes, and that

The requirements for safe milk are a healthy cow, 
absolute cleanliness, low temperature, 50°, and quickness 
of use, twenty-four to thirty-six hours at most.

Mosquito extermination, street cleaning, and garbage 
collection may be described by the teacher. The class 
may expose Petri dishes on the window sill, on the side- 
walk, in the electric or steam car. Note results in dif- 
ferent streets and wards. Examine the methods used in 
street cleaning; write directions for better work. 
Prepare directions for personal aid in this matter to

Ask permission from the Board of Health to clear 
vacant lots and wet places nearby by approved methods. 
TO ILLUSTRATE GARBAGE CREMATION 
Experiment 1. On the hot plate to be found in most 
laboratories, or on a sheet iron square or round laid on 
the ring of a lamp stand, place a quarter slice of bread 
and heat it gently. At first, moisture escapes, as is 
proved by holding a large dry beaker over the bread for 
a second or two. The cloudiness is seen to be water. 
Soon the bread turns brown and then black, or chars, 
and begins to emit smoke. At this stage, if a flame is 
brought close to the bread, the gas so rapidly forming 
(hydrocarbons) will take fire and burn with a more or less 
smoky flame, leaving a glossy black mass of charcoal
-P-A-G-E-34
The Clean City : 21 
or pure carbon, which requires a higher heat and fine 
division for complete combustion. 
Bread contains only about 45 per cent. water and so 
burns rather readily. A slice of potato treated in the 
same way needs to dry longer in order to evaporate its 
75 per cent. water. A slice of apple, or tomato, or a 
melon rind with 90 per cent. of water must be dried 
longer still, but when dry the result is the same. It is 
this need of drying which makes cremation of garbage 
costly, unless some source of waste heat is available, or 
some other waste is at hand to mix with it.. 
Experiment 2. Place on the hot iron a thin slice of 
suet or of butter or a teaspoonful of cream. A little 
water will escape, but the mass will soon give off in- 
flammable gases and burn brilliantly, leaving almost no 
residue. There will be some sooty smoke because the 
air-cannot get to it quickly enough to burn it all. If 
some of this fat can go in with the other garbage, the 
whole will burn admirably. But fat-is too valuable to 
dispose of in this way; it has too many uses, so it is 
abstracted from the refuse. 
Experiment 3. Place a thin shaving of beef or 
chicken or ham on the hot plate and treat as before. 
The same results will follow, with the addition of very 
disagreeable odors. The smell of burning flesh is sick- 
ening. 
All residue containing nitrogen, such as bones, 
hair, woolen, etc., gives off most unpleasant odors with 
the gases formed, so that a specially constructed furnace 
to consume these gases is needed. With this there is no 
difficulty. The burning gases and charcoal should be 
used:to dry the other garbage and even to furnish power.
-P-A-G-E-35
22 Sanitation in Daily Life 
TO ILLUSTRATE CHANGES IN MILK 
Procure a sample of really fresh, clean, cooled milk 
not more than 6 hours from milking. Compare this 
with samples bought at various places. 
Measure out 5 c.c. of each into a small beaker, dilute 
with 50 c.c. of water, add 3 drops of the indicator 
solution, phenolphthalein, and from a burette add drop 
by drop, with stirring, sodium hydroxide one-tenth nor- 
mal solution (4 grams NaOH in 1 liter) until the mix- 
ture is faintly pink. Each tenth of a cubic centimeter 
of the sodium hydroxide used is counted as a degree of 
acidity. 
This acid is chiefly lactic acid formed from milk 
sugar by the action of B lacticus. The fresh milk should 
show less than 10°; when the test shows 23° the original 
sample will coagulate on boiling. Some samples may 
show as high as 100° and yet no harmful results follow 
their use. Apparently the harmful fermentations which 
take place are those which affect the nitrogenous con- 
stituents, yield ammonia, and so tend to neutralize the 
lactic acid. For this reason no decision can be reached 
as to safety of milk by chemical tests. 
Absolutely normal milk gives the amphoteric reac- 
tion, that is, it turns delicate red litmus paper blue, and 
blue litmus red because neutral and acid phosphates are 
present. 
The Petri dishes may be used to show in general the 
presence of germs, and a description may be given of 
the methods by centrifuge for pus cells, dirt, etc., but it 
is not advisable to take time for the class to go through 
the processes.
-P-A-G-E-36

Qualitative tests for dirt may be made by filtering 
through closely packed absorbent cotton. 
Leach recommends the following simple test for the 
presence of formaldehyde: 
To 10 cc. of the milk in a white porcelain dish add 
8 c.c. of hydrochloric acid (1.2 sp. gr.) and 2 cc. of a 
10 per cent. ferric chloride solution; heat gently nearly. 
to a boiling point, stirring all the while to break up 
the curd. More or less formaldehyde gives deeper or 
lighter violet color. One part in 250,000 parts of milk 
may be detected.

CHAPTER III 
THE CLEAN HOUSE 
+ The sanitation of the house, a space inclosed by four 
walls and more or less cut up into smaller spaces, consists in 
keeping the air fairly clean, the water supply safe, and the 
food good. 
HE air of inclosed spaces soon becomes over- 
crowded by the products of respiration; among 
which we note carbon dioxide and moisture. The car- 
bon dioxide arises from the processes of decomposition 
of the food in the body whereby warmth and energy are 
furnished. Carbon dioxide is a waste product which is 
no longer useful and should be at once removed, like any 
other waste. 
Modern sanitarians are inclined to believe that of all 
the causes of disease vitiation of the air is by far the most 
important. A man emits as much CO, through respira- 
tion daily as would be produced by about one-half pound 
of charcoal. 
The air can never be quite clean and fresh, because it 
is confined somewhat and often is contaminated by the 
products of combustion from lamps and gas, from cook 
stoves and furnaces, arid by deleterious gas from unclean 
soil on which it stands, from dirty back yards, from leak- 
ing gas fixtures, and from furnace gas. Gases and fluids 
leaking from joints in sewer pipes add to the contami- 
nating odors from cooking and dust from carpets and

furniture, until it is no wonder that so many persons 
suffer from “colds” and from that general debility which 
allows the attack of many diseases. 
Tuberculosis is especially a closed-space disease.’ 
Considering the bad quality of the air that so many 
persons accustom themselves to breathe, it is a matter 
for wonder that no more persons are sick. 
In the cities, owing to the cost of buildings and land, 
the cubic air space for each person is growing smaller 
and‘ smaller, until the law has stepped in and. required 
330 cubic feet of space for each person in a tenement, 
in a schoolhouse, in a factory. 
The law leaves the demand for air to the good sense 
of- the ordinary house dweller, who is learning only 
slowly that his brilliant Welsbach light of an evening, 
his tight steam-heated apartment, his one-window bed- 
room, are slowly sapping his strength. 
The effort now made. to educate the whole people in 
the use of fresh air as an important factor in curing and, 
still better, in preventing tuberculosis will have good re- 
sults.in the direction of general health as well as in any 
specific case. : 
The- three essentials for healthful life are food, water, 
and air, and the most important of these is air. In this 
most medical men and hygienists are agreed. While we 
eat perhaps three times a day and take water every few 
hours,” we breathe, upon the average, twenty times’ a. 
minute, or 28,800 times every twenty-four hours. So 
constant 4 function must be an important one. We are 
tol tt if air could be withheld from us for six minutes, 
we iid die. Moreover, where abundant oxygen is - 
    
-P-A-G-E-41
26 Sanitation in Daily Life 
present in the air, the quality of the food is of much less 
consequence than when the air is vitiated. 
There are numerous historical records of deaths from 
insufficient air. We remember learning that of the 146 
persons confined in the Black Hole of Calcutta, 123 died 
in one night. : 
The author has said elsewhere that “nothing will take 
the place of fresh air. It is one of the necessities of 
right living. The child should be taught to recognize 
stale air and to demand fresh air as he now demands a 
drink of water. Study rooms at home and in school 
must have better facilities than nine-tenths now have, 
in order to lessen the ‘partial death rate.’” “The child 
should learn to heed this call [for oxygen] as much as 
any other. It is imperative that fresh air, not used-up, 
breathed-over-and-over-again air, should flow through 
the lungs.” 
It is the birthright of every child to be allowed fresh, 
clean air to breathe and be taught how to fill his lungs 
with it by deep breathing. If he once recognizes the 
odor and effect of unclean air and becomes accustomed 
to good -air, he has acquired a valuable asset for life. 
He is in little danger from tuberculosis, and in less dan- 
ger from colds and throat diseases. 
Because the body does adapt itself to surrounding 
conditions is no reason, for making those conditions as 
hard as possible. The pale and pinched appearance of 
the children of the crowded city is caused more by the 
lack of clean air than by any other one thing. 
To secure sufficient air without dust and without 
drafts is the great problem of the city dweller, and he
-P-A-G-E-42
The Clean House 27 
must use all his common sense and ingenuity to secure 
this. 
Examine briefly the constituents of the air. The 
composition of the air shows, on an average, 20.93 per 
cent. oxygen, 79.04 per cent. nitrogen, .03 per cent. CO,, 
with traces’of ammonia, ozone, argon, krypton, neon, 
metargon. “These parts do not form a chemical com- 
.pound, but are mechanically mixed. 
Air at the height of 15,000 feet has been found to 
have the. same composition as at the sea level. Atmos- 
pheric pressure, however, influences cell life, so that a 
change to a higher altitude usually has a stimulating 
effect. 
Ozone is a form of oxygen containing three atoms of 
oxygen to the molecule instead of two. It is produced 
by electrical disturbances, and is found in some abun- 
dance, caused by the atmospheric electricity, at the sea- 
shore and on mountains. The name, coming from the 
Greek “TI smell,” is interesting, having been given 
because of the pectiliar odor that was observed during 
a thunder storm, and later in the presence of an active 
electrical machine. It may be that it is this ozone in the 
air that makes in large part the life-giving quality of sea 
and mountain air. 
A variety of causes may contribute to change the 
quality of the air indoors, vitiating it so that it is unfit 
to be breathed. There may be too much CO,, and con- 
sequently too little oxygen; there may be too little 
inoisture, or there may be too much moisture; there may 
be substances, such as dust, suspended in the air; there 
may be noxious gases or impuritics from respiration.
-P-A-G-E-43
28 Sanitation in Daily Life 
The presence of any one of these -in excess is a pre- 
disposing factor to disease and should be guarded against 
with all care. The remedy is to keep the inside air~as 
nearly the same as that of outdoors as possible. This 
means a free circulation of air, with no dead spaces to 
hold foul air. In summer this is not difficult, but with 
the first chill of the fall we begin to shut our windows, 
and we put off the artificial heat as long as possible. 
This is a grave mistake of many people: The dampness. 
of the soil and walls of houses in spring and fall should 
be counteracted by fires even if the windows are left 
open. This is not the waste it seems, for it means mak- 
ing the transition from one season to the other without 
the severe colds which so pull one down. 
Habit has a great deal to.do with the desire for 
fresh air and the endurance of moving currents. 
If one feels cold it is better to take a brisk walk or to 
run up and down stairs or to go through simple arm and 
leg exercises than to hug the stove or sit over the 
register. 
Even the kitchen can be kept decently cool if the ven- 
tilators are arranged properly. There is no such thing 
as being obliged to stifle. We do not care enough to 
remedy matters, that is all. 
The newspapers make much of the powers of General 
Humidity, but it is no laughing matter. The relative 
moisture in the air is one of the serious disadvantages 
of certain climates. The reasons are not all well under- 
stood, and belong under physiology rather than sanita~ 
tion. What does belong here is the recognition of possi~ 
ble sanitary precautions even though they might come
-P-A-G-E-44
The Clean House 29 
under personal hygiene, such as the avoidance of rich 
food, which requires the evaporation of much water from 
the body surface to carry away the unneeded heat, the 
wearing of light and porous clothing, etc. But beyond 
that, in climates where such days are only occasional and 
for that reason are not prepared for, the installation of 
drying apparatus is desirable and not impossible. Pre- 
cautions as to food and undue exertion on hot days with 
‘high humidity should be general, in order that the blood 
pressure should be reduced and escape from sunstroke 
made possible. 
In cold winter weather when halls are heated by steam 
the air. may become too dry for comfort. Hot water 
heating and good ventilation will obviate this difficulty. 
At all temperatures moisture exists in the air in an 
invisible state. A rise of temperature increases the 
capacity of the air for moisture to a certain limit when 
the air is said to be saturated. This capacity of air for 
moisture increases more rapidly than the temperature. 
Air at 32° can contain 160th part of its own weight; at 
59°, the 80th part; at 86°, the 4oth part, the law being 
that for every increase of 27° its capacity is doubled. 
The dew-point, or the temperature at which the moisture 
begins to condense, may be determined by placing a 
thermometer in a polished metal cup and dropping in 
small pieces of ice until moisture appears on the outside. 
The temperature read must be that of the cup and not of 
unmelted ice. The experiment takes time, therefore the 
device of the so-called wet bulb with constant evapora- 
_tion is most convenient.

Allen. Washington office of the chief signal officer of the Army.
-P-A-G-E-45
30 Sanitation in Daily Life 
One or more of the several registering humidity test-. 
ers should be in the schoolroom and records kept. But 
whatever apparatus is kept, the pupils should set up for 
themselves the simple one of two common but correct 
thermometers whose zero point is the same. About the 
bulb of one tie a skein of embroidery silk, silk gauze, or 
some long fibered cotton wick such as is used in alcohol 
lamps. ‘The essential point is that it shall by its capil- 
larity soak up water from the bottle suspended below, 
quickly and constantly, to replace that lost by the evap- 
oration about the bulb, cooling it in proportion to the 
rapidity of evaporation. 
The water used should be soft and the silk or cotton 
fiber be kept clean and not allowed to become caked with 
dust, or greased from handling with the fingers. 
The two thermometers are hung side by side three or . 
four inches apart, and of course out of reach of the sun. 
This simple device is most convenient for any one 
who has a garden, since it gives a means of foretelling 
frost. The wet bulb registers the dew-point or the 
saturation temperature to which the thermometer is ‘to 
fall unless clouds or wind intervene. Thus if at nine 
o’clock on an October evening the air thermometer reads { 
60° and the wet bulb reads 48°, a difference of 12°, the 
temperature may fall to 31°. If the air is 45° and the 
wet bulb seven degrees lower, or 38°, the final tempera- 
ture may be as low as 25° with killing frost, whereas if 
there is only a difference of two degrees it will fall tc 
40° and the plants be safe.

The reading of the wet bulb thermometer is found 
on the left-hand column, and the difference between the 
wet and the dry bulb in the horizontal line at the top. 
The number at the intersection of these columns is the 
relative humidity under the conditions at the time. 
The table is shortened to avoid confusion, but the 
full tables may be consulted and may well be copied on a
-P-A-G-E-48
The Clean House 33 
card and hung up beside the humidity apparatus. (See 
Ward’s “Meteorology.’’) 
Public sanitation is forced to take account of the 
quality of air in cars, halls, schools, and places of amuse- 
ment where many people are crowded together, and 
where the wishes of one individual may conflict with 
the inclination of others. 
The same methods may be used in the single house. 
The air in this should be even more closely looked after, 
for one stays many hours in a house. 
Dust in the air causes irritation of the air passages 
if nothing more, and such furnishings of the house and 
such care of them and of the floors should be secured 
as will allow clean air to breathe. 
The condition of growing plants is one of the very 
best tests of room or house sanitation. If their leaves 
become very dusty, then the room is not cleaned prop- 
erly; if they drop their leaves then there is probably a 
gas leak or furnace gas escapes. If they do not grow, 
they are not rightly watered, that is, if they have been 
properly potted. Pots for the dry air of the house 
should not be of the porous kind used in the damp green- 
house. If the common brown earth pot is oiled on the 
outside and then shellaced, it will be much better for 
the plant and much neater and cleaner to handle. The 
roots that go to the edge will not dry up and the earth 
will not be cooled by evaporation. Roots as well as 
leaves must breathe, therefore porous drainage is sup- 
plied at the bottom. Where plants will not grow people 
ought not to live, is a safe maxim. 
For the country house, clean soil and clean water are
-P-A-G-E-49
34 Sanitation in Daily Life 
the most difficult to secure. Because the living earth or 
soil-plants so abundant in the surface—two to four 
inches of ordinary “garden soil”—sweetens and dis- 
poses so efficiently of waste matter buried there, it is 
abused by overdosing or continuous use and thus be- 
comes foul and a menace to the house dwellers. More- 
over, such foul soil pollutes the water in the vicinity, so 
that, more often than not, the well at a country house, 
however cool and clear the water, is unsafe to use. . This 
is especially the case when there is a supply of water in 
the house and a cesspool to receive the waste, or when 
the drain is allowed to make a wet pool within fifty feet 
of the well. To have things handy is not always safe. 
The principle on which earth purification takes place 
is by supplying it with air continuously or intermittently. 
Little plants decompose the waste matters under all nat- 
ural conditions. Those, however, that convert them into 
harmless, useful nitrate, carbon dioxide, etc., must have 
oxygen from the air. Therefore the soil must be porous, 
not soaked. <A pail of dirty water may be thrown with 
impunity on the same spot each morning for twenty 
years if the soil takes it up within five or ten minutes, 
but if the soil is clayey, so that the water stands half a 
day, and perhaps is wet even the next morning, then 
purification does not take place. A small plot of sandy 
soil will take care of the drainage of a house, if it is used 
in alternate sections, and if trees such as apples or wil- 
lows are grown on the edge. Some crops may be grown, 
such as corn, whose fruit is far enough above the surface 
to escape the drainage water. Since most germs, how- 
ever, are killed by drying in the sunlight, there is little
-P-A-G-E-50
The Clean House 35 
danger from ‘an irrigation garden. The underground 
water is in constant motion toward lower land, but the 
level of the so-called water table is not usually that of the 
surface. Herein is the cause of so many mistakes in the 
placing of wells and cesspools and barns in the country. 
The slope of surface and water level do not coincide. 
Clean water from shallow wells is a rarity. Soil is 
porous and rocks are full of crevices, so that what is 
thrown onto the surface finds its way some distance 
down to the water level. Human beings waste salt and 
nitrogenous substances that are soluble and which, find- 
ing their way into the water, are carried with it wherever 
it goes. If they are found in any considerable amount, 
it means that the water is not above reproach, but it may 
be so well filtered that there is no real danger. 
It is about as dangerous for the ordinary person with- 
out experience to attempt to interpret the results of a 
water analysis as for an ordinary person to interpret the 
indications of a serious illness. The diagnosis of invid- 
ious disease and the diagnosis of the history and condi- 
tions of an unsafe water belong to the expert having 
not only knowledge but experience. To the layman ap- 
pearance and taste govern his judgment. Neither is a 
criterion of safe water. The soft, slightly yellow water 
supplied by many cities is shunned by visitors merely 
from sentiment. The meadow tea, as Thoreau aptly 
called it, is quite harmless. 
Not all clean water is colorless. Not all clear, spark- 
ling water is clean. Not all pond water is dangerous. 
Not all well or spring water is safe. 
Water carries whatever gets into it unless it is fil-
-P-A-G-E-51
36 Sanitation in Daily Life 
tered out, and some things go through all but the finest 
filter. 
If kitchen slops are thrown on the ground, the water 
filters through the soil, leaving the cabbage leaves behind, 
but carrying the salt from the corned beef or the ice 
cream freezer. This can be traced into the stream or the 
well if it is in the line of flow, probably that is all that 
can be traced. But chamber slops are all liquid and sink 
down into the ground; the chlorine goes through as in 
the kitchen slops, but the ammoniacal salts become food 
for grass, roots of trees, and finally, as oxidized nitrates 
(by soil bacteria), the nitrogen passes on into river or 
well. They can be readily detected and serve to indicate 
the source of the drainage. 
The danger is that the cesspool overflow or seepage 
will not be well filtered and that some bacteria may go 
through and some disease germs also. Too great care 
cannot be taken to have clean water above suspicion ; 
better boil it if theres doubt. 
The schoolhouse well should be the best in town, but 
alas! it is often the worst. (Only very general tests will 
be found at the end of the chapter, for most of the water 
examinations require the diagnosis of an expert.) 
After clean air and clean water come clean fingers. 
At first it might seem as if this were hygiene, a personal 
matter like care of feet or teeth, but it is much more. 
It means clean doors and desks and banisters, dainty 
habits in the use of fingers, never touching nose or 
mouth. It means soap and water and towels, a nail 
brush and manicure scissors. It means careful washing 
of hands after touching the hair, which collects dust
-P-A-G-E-52
The Clean House 37 
rapidly. It means cleaning of shoes in a basement place 
provided, and a brushing of clothes. 
Sanitary cleanliness means washable or cleanable 
clothes. Clothes would keep clean much longer if fin- 
gers were not wiped on them, and if they were care- 
fully hung up and brushed. Lint from unbrushed woolen 
clothing collects dust and then, when damp, smells. 
ILLUSTRATIVE EXPERIMENTS - 
TO MAKE A CHAMBER FOR AIR EXPERIMENTS 
‘Find a box at the grocer’s about 16 x 18 x 6 inches. 
Get from the glazier’s 2 panes of common glass; fit the 
glass front and back, the front pane to slide up and down 
fairly readily. It need not be air-tight, no room ever is. 
Then make holes in the two sides with a 14-inch auger 
and use corks to stop the holes. If there is a manual 
training shop at hand the room may be made with oblong 
spaces like windows and sliding shutters. The idea is to 
secure ‘a closed space of not more than a cubic foot 
content in which, without too much time, a class may see 
the candles go out, and watch the smoke indicating the 
currents. 
- TO TEST AIR CURRENTS WITH A CANDLE FLAME 
A current of 1 foot a second velocity does not per- 
ceptibly deflect the flame. 
One and one-half to 2 feet deflects the flame 30°. 
Four feet a second deflects it 45°.

To change the air five times an hour in a small
-P-A-G-E-53
38 Sanitation in Daily Life 
room, or in a space where people sit close to the sides, is 
a difficult matter to accomplish without causing currents. 
TO TEST FOR LEAKING SEWER PIPES 
Are the sewer pipes tight as shown by the peppermint 
test? Pour two ounces of oil of peppermint into the soil 
pipe at its mouth above the roof, if it is accessible, or into 
the basin or water-closet nearest the roof, first closing the 
vent pipes which appear above the roof. Pour in imme- 
diately after a pailful of hot water. The person doing this 
should remain shut in until another person who has not 
handled the bottle, nor been in communication with the 
one who has, has passed through all the lower rooms 
sniffing for a trace of peppermint odor. If this is noticed 
it should be followed to the leaking spot in the pipe. 
TESTING AIR FOR CARBON DIOXIDE 
The most suitable solution for general pupils to use 
is lime water. A saturated stock solution may be kept 
in a bottle protected from carbon dioxide. One or two 
much weaker solutions, one one-hundredth or one two- 
hundredth as strong as the saturated solution, may be 
kept in similarly protected bottles, but one five-hundredth 
or one one-thousandth as strong as the saturated solu- 
tion should be used the day they are made. 
The indicator (phenolphthalein) is made by dissolv- 
ing .o70 gram of the powder in 50 c.c. of strong alcohol 
and making up to 100 c.c. 
To prepare the saturated lime water, procure a stony 
lump of quicklime (if it is crumbly, it is air-slaked and 
useless) as clean and white as possible. Place it in a
-P-A-G-E-54
The Clean House 39 
porcelain dish and set on a brick or on something which 
will not scorch or crack with the heat. It is instructive 
to weigh the lump and add the calculated amount of 
water. . 
Ten grams CaO 40-+16=56 requires 18 grams H,O 
to make CaH,O, 40+2+32=74 grams. 
If weights are not made, add at least an equal bulk of 
water to the quicklime. It should begin to heat and 
swell up and soon fall to a dry powder, if the lime was 
quick and the proportions correct. The excess of water 
evaporates. 
Drop the powder into the stock bottle, add water to 
four-fifths fill the bottle. A lump weighing 25 grams 
will serve for a 2-liter bottle. 
Stopper lightly and shake at intervals for several 
hours, allow to settle clear, then fit the stopper and de- 
livery tubes. The appearance of a scum or film of solid 
on any part. of the solution shows leakage of air. 
To prepare a one one-hundredth saturated solution, 
measure I or 2 or more liters of water into whichever 
size of bottle is chosen, add 2 c.c. of the indicator (phenol- 
phthalein) solution for each liter, add cautiously the lime 
water, finally, drop by drop, with rotary shaking, until the 
solution shows a faint color against a white background, 
remaining for 5 minutes, then add from the burette just 
10 c.c. of the saturated lime water, stopper quickly, mix 
well, and place on the shelf with the delivery tubes, etc., 
as with the solution having the powder at the bottom. 
This being clear, no time for settling is required. The 
other strengths are made in the same way, using the 
smaller amounts; only the one one-thousandth is best
-P-A-G-E-55
49 Sanitation in Daily Life 
made from the one one-hundredth. The two hundredth 
-solution will serve for the common tests: Wolpert, Fitz: 
shaker, Cohen and Appleyard, and for the ounce bottle 
test. The one one-thousandth is used for what may be 
called the bubble method, because a stronger -solution 
would require too: much time. 
In all these dilute lime water tests the results are 
only approximate and comparative because of the great 
difficulty of excluding air at all points in the process. 
A quick and ready method for estimating the carbon 
dioxide in the air of inclosed spaces is a great desider- 
atum. The properties of the gas and its relation to other 
substances have not, hitherto, admitted of a mechanical 
measure, as a thermometer is a measure of the degree 
of heat. 
The Wolpert plan of a bead of liquid flowing down 
a thread serves for a day or two. But the thread soon 
becomes incrusted and ceases to conduct the liquid, and 
the reservoir requires renewing frequently. 
The principle of the Wolpert tester and the Fitz 
shaker is that to 10 c.c. of the dilute lime water in the 
graduated glass tube is added successively measured vol- 
umes of air, which are shaken up with the lime water 
and by it deprived of the CO, until the solution is neu- 
tralized and it becomes colorless and cloudy with the 
insoluble calcium carbonate. 
If out-of-door air takes 300 c.c. to decolorize the 
10 c.c. lime water, and if the air in schoolroom A takes 
200 ¢.c., that in schoolroom B 100 c.c., and in a bedroom 
only 50 c.c., we have a relative measure of the badness 
of the air. It is necessary to test the lime solution in 
outside air to be sure of the method and results.
-P-A-G-E-56
The Clean House 41 
Of a one two-hundredth solution 10 c.c. will require 
300 to 350 c.c. of outdoor air to decolorize; a sufficiently 
ventilated room, 150 to 200 c.c.; a badly ventilated room, 
too to 150 c.c.; an intolerable and quickly to be remedied 
room, 50 to go C.c, 
A set of graded bottles, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 ounce as 
bought of the druggist, may be filled with water, car- 
ried to the place to be tested and the water emptied out. 
The air will rush in to take its place and thus be confined. 
The 2-ounce bottle corresponds to the 50 to go c.c., the 
4-ounce to the 100 to 150 c.c., the 6-ounce to the 150 to 
200° c.c., the 8-ounce to 200 to 300 £.c., the 10-ounce to 
300 to 400 c.c., when the above solution is introduced and 
shaken. 
The same solution may be used for the time method. 
The principle of this is that the higher the proportion 
of CO, in the air the quicker it will unite with the lime 
water.t Select some white glass 500 c.c. bottles, round 
or square or oblong, not corrugated or. stamped, glass- 
stoppered ; wash them thoroughly, soaking at first with a 
little acid in the water to neutralize any alkali left from 
the stoppers. Collect air samples by emptying the water 
from the inverted bottle held at the point the air is to be 
tested (catch the water in a suitable clean vessel and use 
to refill the bottle if more convenient). 
When the desired number of samples has been col- 
lected, bring to the laboratory, add 10 c.c. of the one two- 
hundredth solution, close the bottle and shake, noting the 
time to the second when the lime water was added and 
the.¢olor has nearly disappeared. Out-of-door air will

-P-A-G-E-57
42 Sanitation in Daily Life 
require 3 or 314 minutes, the ventilated room 2 minutes, 
the badly ventilated room 1 minute, the intolerable room 
¥% minute or less. 
For the bubble method the one one-thousandth solu- 
tion is used and a test tube fitted with stopper and glass 
tubing, so that the air is drawn through slowly and its 
bubbles robbed of the CO, as it passes. As the time 
method shows, this can be passed only slowly and in small 
bubbles and is then only comparative, but for a lecture ex- 
periment or for illustration of progressive pollution it is 
very effective. Fresh air takes 10 minutes, fairly good 
air 5 minutes, bad air decolorizes in 2 or 3 minutes. If 
no suction is available it may be produced’ from a pair of 
bottles called aspirators, so connected that the water from 
one runs into the other at a lower level, and when full the 
positions are reversed. 
HUMIDITY TESTS 
To show the stifling sensation of saturated air and 
that the sensible temperature, or that which we feel, is 
that of the wet bulb, use a small room or closet, which 
may be made moist by hanging wet blankets or moist 
and hot by steam; set a pupil to record the sensations and 
the reading of the instruments.* 
EXPERIMENTS WITH WATER 
It is usually possible to find a bottle holding 2 to 4 
quarts with the bottom broken off evenly, or to have one 
cut; support it in some convenient manner; fit the neck 
with a stopper carrying a glass tube furnished with rub- 
1If the school can have a Draper registering thermometer it will 
give both pleasure and instruction.

The Clean House ~ 43 
ber ending and punch cork. Fill it four-fifths full with 
the sample of soil to be tested, put a fine wire gauze at the 
bottomi and some coarser gravel so as to furnish good 
drainage, then the sifted earth. It adds to the interest 
to weigh the dried earth used and then to measure the 
water added at the top and note the amount the earth 
from different sources will take up. Some clayey soil 
for contrast should be obtained. ° 
(a) Prepare test solutions as follows: Weigh o. 165 
gram salt (pure, dry NaCl). Make up toa liter. Ica = 
0.001 gram Cl. . 
(b) Weigh 0.072 gram KnO,. Make up to a liter. 
Measure out 100 c.c. of this and make up to a liter. 
I c.c..= 0.000001 nitrogen. 
(c) Weigh 0.315 gram NH,Cl. Make up to.a 
liter. Measure out 100 c.c. of this and make up to 
a liter. 1 c.c. = 0.00001 nitrogen. : 
It is desirable to prepare fresh for experiments, 
(d) A solution containing 1 c.c. skimmed milk in a 
liter. 
(e) A solution containing 1 c.c. urine in a liter. 
Varying quantities of these solutions and mixtures of 
them may be made by the class, each for his own filter, 
and tests of the filtrate made. There may be shown the 
following facts: That the salt goes through unchanged 
whatever the mixture used, and therefore that the test 
for chlorine is a universal one, and its presence above 
the normal for the region is a certain indication of past 
pollution. That passed through clean sand or earth, 
nitrates go through unchanged; but in the presence 
of considerable organic matter, milk solutions, for in-
-P-A-G-E-59
44 Sanitation in Daily Life 
stance, they are reduced to nitrites. Ammonia and 
urine solutions may be converted into. nitrates by slow 
passage through unsterilized loam or garden soil, but 
they are not changed by clean washed sand. Nitrates 
therefore show a previous contamination, ammonia and 
‘nitrites show present contamination. 
Filtration after Coagulation 
Mixtures of d and e in considerable dilution with a 
little clayey soil may be used to illustrate the purification 
by mechanical filtration, now so common for the muddy 
river waters of the South and West. To 1 liter of the 
trial water add 1 to 10 c.c. of an alum solution, 5 grams 
to the liter; mix well. If on standing half an hour coag- 
ulation does not take place, add 10 c.c. of a saturated 
lime water, mix well and allow to stand. Experiment 
by adding first one and then the other until it is probable 
that 24 hours’ standing will give a clear solution which 
may be decanted. A much less quantity of the reagent 
will give a mixture which, run through one of the pre- 
pared filters, will give a clear solution. : 
The hard waters of the South and West will coagu- 
‘ate without the addition of anything beside the alum 
solution. The soft colored waters do not contain enough 
lime or sodium salts to decompose the aluminum sulphate, 
and some must be added. 
Examination of Well Water 
Secure from the chemical laboratory a small bottle 
of Nessler solution to test for ammonia; neutral potas- 
sium chromate to use as indicator for chlorine titration ;
-P-A-G-E-60
The Clean House 45 
a very small, well-protected bottle of phenol disulphonic 
acid to test for nitrates. 
Give a demonstration to the class of the preliminary 
exantination of a well water. 
Examine the sample taken in a clean, clear glass 
bottle with a glass or new cork stopper, not brought in a 
fruit jar with rubber ring or a jug with old stopper. 
Note if the water is clear or if there are organisms, 
as cyclops or daphnia, specks of rust or stringy cobweb, 
like gray threads. Heat about 100 c.c. in a beaker capa- 
ble of holding three times as much. Cover with a watch 
glass while heating until the moisture begins to condense 
on the glass cover. Remove and at the end of 5 min- 
utes take a quick sniff. There should be no unpleasant 
odor. 
Measure into clean beakers 100 c.c. each of distilled 
water, a-well known to be good, the town, city, or school 
supply, and of the sample to be tested. Add 5 drops 
of the potassium chromate indicator to each, then from 
a burette run in, drop by drop, silver nitrate, stirring 
gently after each addition until a reddish color appears. 
The chloride of silver is white and is formed before any 
chromate. : 
Distilled water will show red after a drop or two; 
the good supply may take several drops, but a bad well 
often requires several cubic centimeters. Good water 
too miles from the seacoast rarely has over one part . 
~ per million of chlorine. Nearer the sea there may be ten 
parts, so that the normal chlorine must be known to the 
expert’ analyst. 
To test for nitrates, which always accompany chlorine
-P-A-G-E-61
46 Sanitation in Daily Life 
in bad wells, evaporate 2 c.c. of each of the water sam- 
ples tested for chlorine just to dryness on a warm bath 
or plate. 
Three-inch porcelain dishes are best. Add 5 drops 
of the prepared phenol disulphonic acid, moisten the dish 
wherever the water has dried, and neutralize the acid by 
a very dilute alkaline solution of potassium hydrate. If 
there are nitrates a yellow color will appear more or less 
deep. 
It is a very poliuted well which shows free ammonia, 
but ordinary distilled water almost always contains am- 
monia concentrated in its distillation, hence there must 
be a caution in making this test. Well-filtered ground 
water does not show ammonia. 
None of these things are in themselves harmful, but 
they indicate certain underground happenings which are 
to be avoided. 
Before going into any extensive discussion of these 
matters the teacher should read some of the text-books 
on water.

CHAPTER IV 
-o HABITS OF CLEANLINESS 
Correct habits, not rules, are the proper preventions for 
all sorts of defects.” — Saxon saying. 
“A most essential part of modern education is the early 
formation of such habits with regard to environment as shall 
conduce to the best living.” 
EALTH, like religion, is to be such an integral 
part of the individual as to be a daily performance, 
and not a matter of times and seasons. 
When this is the case, the person has a set of habits 
become as much a part of him—as involuntarily per- 
formed—as breathing. Such habits can be readily im- 
pressed on the body while it is plastic and growing, 
that is, while it is young. But they are acquired only 
with difficulty and by much thought in after years. 
Hence there is the greatest economy of time and energy 
in-accustoming young people to habits of daily living 
which will give them the best chance in after life—the 
chance to be healthy, happy, and efficient human beings. 
Grown people find it such an effort to change a habit 
that curious devices are resorted to to cheat them into 
doing what they agree is right and desirable, but which 
it takes an effort to remember to do. 
An excellent example of bondage to habit is brought 
out in the proposition made on this day of writing to 
change the clocks of an island town in summer so that 
47
-P-A-G-E-65
48 Sanitation in Daily Life 
instead of breakfasting three or four hours after the 
birds and squirrels, the people may be up at five or six 
o’clock and enjoy the best of the summer days. 
This illustrates the purely mental effect of. going by 
the clock and. not by what is wise and desirable. An in- 
telligent community has not strength of mind or energy 
enough to take the great sanitary advantage of the life- 
giving early hours without being inveigled into doing 
right by the clocks. 
Without becoming frightened by a discussion of 
germs we may well ask where do microbes come from? 
We find them in dirt and refuse and wherever thére is 
food for them. They act as decomposing agents to make 
over waste matter into food for plants as soon as possi- 
ble.. Men and animals eat the plants, and other microbes 
complete the cycle. 
Refuse thrown out on the cornfield or buried in soil 
soon becomes absorbed, but the same refuse hidden in 
the back yard under a pile of boards where nothing green 
can grow may become dangerous and will be offensive. 
The organisms which work in the dark and often make 
bad smells are called anaérobic, without air. Rout them 
out into the sunlight and air and they soon die. In the 
city there is nothing to do but to get rid of them, down 
the sewer as quickly as possible, if they are liquids or 
fine solids; and to burn all coarse solids. 
But how does it happen that there is so much dirt to 
get rid of? Why must we be on the lookout all the time? 
Largely because we are careless and thoughtless and 
leave refuse about to be looked after by the microbes, 
which are doing their best to help us.
-P-A-G-E-66
Habits of Cleanliness . 49 
That is, we have not acquired good habits of cleanli- 
ness—never to leave wastes about, but to get rid of them 
for good and all as soon as possible. 
These habits will become second nature very soon if 
we will take pains for a little time. If we will think for 
a short time, then our habits will take care of themselves 
and we can think of other things. 
We have certain inherent capacities as to bodily 
strength, length of life, etc., but it lies largely with our- 
selves to adopt a mode of life which may make an actual 
difference in height, weight and physical strength and 
intellectual capacity. An eminent physician says that 
“most people die prematurely through needless exposure 
to infection, improper food, excessive drinking, impure 
air, diet of various kinds, unhealthy occupations, im- 
proper clothing,” etc. 
These essential habits are largely connected with 
breathing, eating, and drinking (air, water, and food), 
together with sleep, exercise, and cleanliness. 
Every man who hopes to make a success of his life 
work—whatever that may prove to be—must get into 
the habit of forming good habits, of taking infinite pains 
habitually to fashion his character in the right way. 
If heredity has hampered one’s life, it is so much the 
more desirable that the one who has little force to expend 
should acquire habits of doing the right thing, and so 
husbanding both physical strength and mental power. 
“Even inanimate things acquire habits—a lock works 
better after ‘being used some time; it costs less trouble 
to fold a paper when it has been folded already. This 
saving of trouble is due to the essential nature of habit,
-P-A-G-E-67
50 Sanitation in Daily Life 
which brings it about that to reproduce the effect once 
gained a less amount of the cause is required. The 
sounds of a violin improve by use in the hands of an able 
artist because the fibers of the wood at last contract habits 
of vibration conformed to harmonious relations. This is 
what gives such inestimable value to musical instru- 
ments' that have belonged to great masters.” 
If inanimate things can acquire desirable habits of 
value to the world, shall human beings take less pains 
to make terelyes of as much value as possible at as 
Hittle cost of trefvéus energy as may be? For it is cer- 
“stainly true that “habit diminishes the conscious attention 
~ with which acts ‘dre performed. ” 
Thus‘dne may involuntarily and without effort do the 
right thing at the right time, leaving the mind free to 
decide upon matters requiring higher thought. If prac- 
tice did not make perfect, nor habit economize the ex- 
pense of ‘nervous and muscular energy, man with his 
multifarious impulses to action would be in a sorry 
plight. 
Children and youth learn so easily and adults with 
such difficulty that the plan of education should include 
the daily habits which make for long life and immunity 
from disease. “The more of the details of our daily life 
we can hand over to the effortless custody of automatism, 
the more our higher powers of mind will be set free for 
their own proper work.” “Could the young but realize 
how soon they will become mere walking bundles of 
habits, they would give more heed to their conduct while 
in a plastic state.”?

Whenever the sanitary enthusiast begs his friends to 
take more pains to do certain right things or to avoid 
certain doubtful ones he is met with such remarks as, 
“T cannot remember,” “It takes too much time,” “It is too 
much trouble to think of that,” ete: 
Right sanitary actions should not require conscious 
thought. They should be done involuntarily without 
the effort of thinking. 
Professor James’s two important maxims are: (1) 
“Make our nervous system our ally instead of our enemy 
—make automatic and habitual, as early as possible, as 
many useful actions as we can.’ 
(2) “Never suffer an exception to occur until the 
new habit is securely rooted.in your life.” It.is far more 
costly to learn by our mistakes than by patient repetition 
of right ways which soon become unconscious acts. 
The habits to be contracted early are both personal 
and social, the reasons are explained in treatises on per- 
sonal hygiene and in those on community sanitation. 
At this point only a general survey is needed. Those 
_ concerning personal hygiene are for the most part man- 
datory, as bathe daily, clean the teeth after every meal 
and on rising and going to bed, etc. 
One of the most important habits to acquire is that 
of keeping one’s fingers and ail other objects of use away 
from nose and mouth. Then the hands will be far less 
dangerous. This fingering of the face seems to be a relic 
of savage days. 
Eyes and nose are subject to disorders of the greatest 
infectivé power, and hands transmit to a great variety of 
objects handled by others. That is why personal habits
-P-A-G-E-69
52 Sanitation in Daily Life 
of this kind come into a consideration of community 
sanitation. , 
In the light of modern knowledge one of the bad 
habits is wetting the finger to turn the leaves of books. 
This not only soils the leaf and causes it to turn yellow, 
but since the mouth harbors many kinds of dormant 
germs, it is a dangerous proceeding as well as an untidy 
one. : 
It is astonishing how few people have outgrown the 
child’s habit of putting things in the mouth. “Out of the 
mouth cometh all uncleanness.” This habit is not a little 
‘to blame for the spread of children’s diseases and for all 
those which find an agreeable home in nose and throat. 
The habit of biting an apple and then handing it to a 
little friend is most pernicious. 
Do not cough into free air or into your hand. The 
fine spray even in speaking, when there is mucus in the 
throat, may and usually is sent for a number of feet away 
from the person. That is why grip and tonsilitis spread 
so rapidly in crowded shops and cars. 
If the hand catches this spray it stops it, to be sure, 
but carries it to the friend’s hand or to the book or bag 
one is carrying. Use a handkerchief or piece of cloth 
always, and have plenty of them. 
Each morning the greatest pains should be taken to 
have face, hands, and finger nails really clean, not just 
clean to appearance. Washable gloves put on when the 
hands are clean are a protection against others’ care- 
lessness. 
After handling books, chairs, banisters, coats, etc., 
wash the hands again and wipe them on a clean towel. 
A dirty towel is often the worst carrier of infection.
-P-A-G-E-70
Habits of Cleanliness 53 
Daintiness in these respects is one of the most im- 
portant habits to form. Cheese cloth may be used instead 
of towels and may be washed and dried on the school 
premises. Ironing is not necessary. 
Another very necessary habit is care of pocket hand- 
kerchiefs. No matter how inexpensive the material, 
cloths of some kind should be used to protect the hands, 
and therefore they should be large enough and there 
should be enough of them to prevent re-using when one 
is wet or soiled. 
There are more sanitary sins of commission in con- 
nection with lack of sufficient handkerchiefs than with 
any other one thing except, possibly, spitting on the floor. 
The spread of the deadly spinal meningitis has been 
pretty clearly traced in several cases to mothers. who 
were carrying sick children lending the soiled handker- 
chief to the next child. 
The mothers will sigh over the multiplication of 
handkerchiefs and towels, but rightly used (they are not 
for wiping desks or boots) such accessories to cleanness 
will more than pay in good health. 
The habits affecting community sanitation are largely 
prohibitive. Do not spit in the street, in the car or in 
the public paths, because it may infect others. Do not go 
about with dirty hands and finger nails, because not only 
may your own body suffer from the entrance of germs 
by means of scratches, but your hands touch others 
and others’ property, and may distribute undesirable 
organisms. 
The tendency to get rid of waste material with little 
trouble to one’s self and without thought of the effect on ’
-P-A-G-E-71
54 Sanitation in Daily Life 
one’s neighbor is seen in the sweeping of houses, halls, 
and shops into the streets, in the throwing of papers and 
luncheon boxes under seats in public parks, and in the 
scattering of peanut shells in cars. No surer test of the 
general sanitary intelligence of a community can be made 
than the inspection of a suburban train, both as to its 
ventilation and cleanliness. The public carrier and the 
public caretaker take pains only to the point demanded 
by the public patronizing them. The grocery store has 
responded to this demand. Have the schoolhouse and 
the city hall and post office in your vicinity. so responded ? 
The best exercise for a class will be to make out a 
list of “don’ts” from their studies and from observation 
in their own localities. The country school will have 
one set, the suburban another, and the city school a 
. third, with many variations. 
This opens the way for a study of the next chapter. 
What is a. community to do in order to demand right 
and safe habits from itself, namely, the making of rules 
and regulations which mean the acquirement of habitual 
ways of doing things of the most advantage to the com- 
munity? 
The habit of putting wastes in a proper place pre- 
pared for each kind is one of the most valuable sanitary 
habits. . 
This should be enforced in school. The schoolhouse 
and schoolyard should be the example of tidiness. It 
takes only a few seconds for each one to do the right 
thing, and taxation for paying public scavengers is light- 
ened and safety from distributed dirt insured. 
The care of clothes is a sanitary problem.
-P-A-G-E-72
Habits of Cleanliness 55 
Loosely woven wool is the warmest covering but col- 
lects the most dust and is most difficult to wash. Loosely 
woven cotton or silk is next best but soon loses its neat 
look and becomes limp and twisted. 
Finely woven cotton or linen holds its texture and 
shape best under hard usage, sheds dust and cleans 
easily, but conducts heat rapidly and is not suitable for 
cold weather. 
Under the conditions under which city children live— 
dusty streets, dirty cars and staircases, crowds of people 
and sooty air—clothes should be frequently changed, 
stockings especially. In the city, water is abundant and 
there is no excuse for not keeping clean. 
ILLUSTRATIVE EXPERIMENTS 
TESTS FOR CLEANNESS. DUST ON THINGS 
In the Navy the inspector wipes the inside of the soup 
kettle with a fine cambric handkerchief. No discolora- 
tion of the immaculately clean linen should occur. Not 
all furniture may be kept in such order, but an approxi- 
mation may be made. 
Have: several squares of fine bleached cheese cloth 
six or eight inches square. Test desks, chairs, walls, 
tables, window sills, door handles, banisters, etc., to see 
if they are free from black dirt. The moist hand will 
take up even more than the cloth. 
- For the dampened duster see page 5. 
Flies are tabooed; but if the windows are spotted, 4 
cloth moistened with a little alcohol may be used to wipe
-P-A-G-E-73
56 Sanitation in Daily Life 
them clean. This is done not only for neatness, but as a 
sanitary precaution, since flyspecks may distribute disease 
germs. Put used squares in a pail of water at once, 
and wash out when convenient. : : 
With floors prevention is half the battle. Do not 
bring in dirt on shoes and clothing. Unless windows 
are screened, or the air is forced in through a screened 
chamber, dust will blow in, if the house is on a Street 
or near a plowed field. Hang a large piece .of the 
dampened cheese cloth across the opened window, pin- 
ning it on so that the air must pass through it and leave 
the dust behind. Note the time when it becomes dark- 
ened and when it begins to bag out, showing that it is 
clogged. Do the same before the ventilating inlet. 
Dampened sawdust is one of the best agents for taking 
up dirt from a hardwood floor. It may be burned and 
so all particles disposed of, Bits of dampened, not wet, 
newspaper are next best, and for the same reason. 
Dampened cloth fastened to a broom or bristle brush 
may be tried. 
When a room has been cleaned, expose Petri dishes 
for 10 minutes, cover and set aside for 48 hours. If the 
room is free from dust half an hour after cleaning, it is 
fit to live in, that is, if there are not more than five or 
six colonies.

It is like sweeping back the sea with a broom, since 
each year brings a fresh contingent of ignorance. A re- 
spect for the power of the law is inculcated by the en- 
forcement of the ordinance against spitting in public 
' conveyances, but no permanent cure for the evil habit 
can be expected until the children and young loafers also 
are reached by the reasons why it is dangerous. 
Until both parents and children understand the rea- , 
son why rubbish in the streets and garbage in the back 
alleys are not to be tolerated, it will continue to be found 
there in spite of city ordinances and health officers. 
Sanitary regulations are of little value unless they 
are generally known and okeyed, and to be obeyed cheer- 
fully they must be understood. 
Each town has or should have certain regulations for 
the protection of its citizens. 
: Each state has also laws in relation to the protection 
of the people in such cases as affect a wider community. 
These are often compiled in manuals which may be ob- 
tained. 
Finally the Federal government has regulations 
which affect long distance travel, imported goods, etc. . 
Each school should have copies of these laws in its 
library and the fact of their existence should be called to 
the attention of each pupil, even if they are not read 
to the whole schocl. 
Laws are for our protection and not for our oppres- 
sion. As long as we are ignorant and selfish we shall 
be a menace to our neighbor in our careless and ignorant 
ways, and he has a right to claim government protection 
against us.
-P-A-G-E-80
Sanitary Regulations 61 
Many of these regulations seem at first sight oppress- 
ive and unnecessarily costly, but in the long run they 
will be found to be as fair as they can be made. 
Injurious Trades and Factory Inspection 
Two great enemies of indoor workers are close air 
and dust, gritty or linty or poison fumes. But individ- 
ual carelessness and unclean habits make dangerous the 
handling of such materials as lead, paint, or arsenical 
products. 
Factory inspection includes inspection of air space, 
floors, toilet accommodations, and most of the general 
environment; but instruction of the workers as to their 
part in co-operating to maintain a sanitary condition is 
too often lacking. 
In most of the dangerous trades, nelps are previded 
which the workers are too lazy to use. Sanitary instruc. 
tion must go so deeply into the daily lives of the people 
that nothing will sezm too much trouble, if, by that 
means, health and capacity for work may be secured. 
Inspection 
Tenement inspection shows the same lack of attention 
to laws of health, School inspection is only just being 
supplemented by the work of the school nurse, who is 
really a teacher. All inspection should be supplemented 
in this way by practical instruction in the means of carry- 
ing out the regulations. All rules, however carefully 
drawn, will fail to meet exceptional circumstances, and 
intelligence. must take into account the fundamental prin- 
ciplés.
-P-A-G-E-81
62 Sanitation in Daily Life 
Education 
Sanitary’ science has advanced so much faster than 
popular knowledge that many communities get their 
education in preventive measures only after they are 
confronted with an epidemic. 
The case of the New Orleans epidemic of yellow 
fever in 1904 is in point. Although the suppression of 
yellow. fever in Cuba was the most remarkable result 
the world has ever seen of the application of scientific 
knowledge to immediate beneficent result, the officials of 
the Gulf States did not fully accept the mosquito theory 
and thus did not suppress the trouble in the beginning. 
It required the presence of the United States authorities 
and constant lectures and ward meetings to educate even 
the intelligent people to the true remedies. 
Education in sanitary matters, knowledge of what are 
proper precautions and a belief that such precautions pay 
in the end must be carried on day by day—must be the 
aim of all wishers for human progress. 
Another case in which an epidemic was the costly 
teacher was in the camps of the United States soldiers 
at the time of the Spanish War in 1898. Typhoid fever 
became ‘epidemic in the camps situated in the Southern 
Atlantic States to such an extent that more than one-fifth 
of the soldiers had it, and it was brought away to an ex-+ 
tent that undid the work of twenty years in suppressing 
it. Nearly twenty per cent. of the officers contracted the 
disease. It was conclusively proved (to our everlasting 
shame) that flies were the chief carriers of the disease. 
But this was possible only because the precaution of cov- 
ering and disinfecting the excreta was not attended to.
-P-A-G-E-82
Sanitary Regulations 63 
There should not have been flies to carry the disease and 
the first case should have been the last. 
The plague of flies may be stopped when breeding 
places are screened, as manure heaps in the country; 
when streets and alleys are kept clean in the city; and 
when restaurant and house garbage is removed daily— 
in short, when nothing is leit about for flies to feed upon.? 
Let us protect all foods from flies. If the community 
cannot or will not prevent their propagation, then indi- 
viduals must resort to fly paper, insect powder, and occa- 
sional fumigation. / 
Official Public Health Work 
At Washington, D. C., Surgeon-General Walter 
Wyman is in charge of the Public Health and Marine 
Hospital service under the Treasury Department. The« 
Hygienic Laboratory carries on researches and issues 
bulletins. Conferences of state and territorial health 
"officers are held in Washington. 
All the states have Boards of Health with offices at 
the state capitol. Many of them issue reports of great 
interest and value which may be obtained on application 
or through representatives. 
Several of these boards issue bulletins and pamphlets 
for free distribution, notably Maine, New Hampshire,

Vermont, Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, 
Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Wisconsin. Michigan has for 
many years given much attention to the dissemination of 
popular literature on sanitary topics. A series of teach- 
ers’ bulletins, reaching a circulation of over a quarter of 
a million, have been issued since 1895 to enable them to 
comply with the law of that year requiring instruction to 
be given in relation to contagious diseases and other 
health matters. One of these gives an interesting esti- 
mate on the money value of health work. 
In order to have information, well-equipped labora- 
tories are now being installed, with a corps of investiga- 
tors and routine workers: Visit that in the locality of 
the school, if possible. 
From these offices a surprising amount of informa- 
tion in the way of bulletins and reports is being issued, 
most of it free. One has no excuse for ignorance. 
The State Board of Health of New Hampshire issued 
a special Sanitary Bulletin for gratuitous distribution 
throughout the state on scarlet fever, “in order that a 
wider and more general knowledge of the means and 
measures necessary to the restriction and prevention of 
scarlet fever may be disseminated.” 
The town of Montclair, N. J., has been a model for 
local supervision. The 1906 report says: 
“Its chief efforts have been directed, as in former 
years, towards preventing the spread of communicable 
diseases. Its efforts to prevent the spread of disease 
center : 
“(1) In the proper control of persons suffering with 
communicable diseases, including their environments.
-P-A-G-E-84
Sanitary Regulations 65 
. “(2) In safeguarding the milk supply of the town. 
(3) In constant watchfulness over both pupils and 
buildings of the public and the parochial schools. 
“The oversight of the milk supply is one of the most 
important if not fhe most important branch of work 
which is intrusted to a Board of Health.” 
Comparatively few householders know what the law 
requires until they come in contact with it. The tene- 
ment dweller and the recent immigrant can know little 
of the best ways of keeping clean in a strange country. 
Instructive nursing has found its place and instructive 
inspection should be introduced in every village. The 
school and the Woman’s Club can each do a part in be- 
coming a source of information and a repository of the 
best appliances. There should be one or more trained 
women inspectors in each town and city ward. 
In 1905, Prof. J. Pease Norton, of the Department of 
Economics, Yale University, presented a paper to the 
American Association for the Advancement of. Science 
in which he gave statistics to back up his plea for gov- 
ernment attention to the great wastes in human life by 
preventable disease. He claimed that of the people then 
living’ over eight millions would die of tuberculosis, that 
during the next ten years more than six millions of in- 
fants under two years would die; eight millions will per- 
ish of pneumonia, six millions from heart and kidney 
diseases. Of these twenty-eight millions, representing a 
potential value of $5,000 each, or even $2,000 each, 
a tremendous money waste is going on which might be 
prevented by an expenditure of perhaps ten per cent. of 
. the amount in money and a little time and thought by
-P-A-G-E-85

each one. A committee of one hundred has been or- 
ganized to work for public enlightenment and for a public 
sentiment resulting in government aid. 
A modest effort had already started under the name 
. of the Health Education League,’ whose work is the cir- 
culation of booklets giving an epitome of the practical 
knowledge on certain definite points. There is little 
excuse today for any one to go ignorant of the various 
precautions to be taken to ward off disease. 
In the state of Connecticut there is a woman deputy 
factory inspector, recommended to the factory inspector 
by a commission of three women appointed by the gov- 
ernor. This deputy is to consider whatever relates to 
the health and welfare of the 50,000 working women in 
the state. This includes inspection of sanitary fixtures, 
cleanliness, ventilation, etc. 
Law is the foundation of state medicine—the protec- 
tion of the ignorant, the helpless, and the thoughtless. 
Many a school-teacher allows the schoolhouse to become 
unsanitary because it does not seem important in com- 
parison with the lessons; many a shop manager never 
thinks about it; and many a tenement owner says, “Oh, 
well, they need not hire it”; or, “They do not want any 
better.” Then the law steps in and says, “But they 
should want better, and if they are to become good citi- 
zens and efficient workers they must have better.” 
So important is this education through sanitary regu- 
lation that the states of New York, Texas, Pennsylvania, 
and the District of Columbia have each a Department of 
Health, with a single commissioner and county health 
1 With offices at 11 3 Devonshire Street, Boston,

officers and inspectors. Massachusetts has just inau- 
gurated a system of district inspectors. 
Many states have milk commissions. ; 
All this effort to enforce the laws is a great factor in 
instructing the people in safe ways of carrying on their 
daily life, for the laws are almost always ahead of the 
general belief concerning the necessity for them. For 
instance, the city of New York has a provision in its sani- 
tary code that all food in the streets shall be protected, 
but it is not enforced because the general sentiment of the 
people is not ready for it. 
- Diseases that are carried by flies, fleas, mosquitoes, 
water, etc., and that are carried from one person to an- 
other by contact and by handling of food or utensils, 
MAY BE PREVENTED. 
WHY ARE THEY NOT PREVENTED? 
_ Because the people do not believe that the rules of 
health are necessary and they are not willing to take the 
trouble to follow them. 
In the Panama Canal zone they collect all garbage 
and rubbish every day; even shavings, shingles, empty 
barrels, the litter of house building, are removed before 
night and burned. No rubbish of any sort is allowed 
to accumulate. 
Large bodies of men are employed in every town of 
the zone keeping every pool of stagnant water well 
covered with crude petroleum. The banks of the streams 
are constantly patrolled and every small pool or slack 
water bay is filled up and all the work is under most 
careful inspection. 
All this shows what might be done in our towns if we 
only believed it was worth while.

In England they have come to feel that the great 
question of the day is THE HEALTH OF THE PEOPLE, 
“and they have formed a National League for physical 
education and improvement. 
* The late Lord Derby said sanitary instruction is of 
the two more important than sanitary legislation. 
Nothing can supersede the value of personal and pri-

can be carried out by individuals. 
ILLustRATIVE EXPERIMENTS 
EXERCISE IN INSPECTION 
Secure the loan of a house for inspection. Observe 
the streets and alleys adjacent; watch for the water cart 
if summer, for the sanitary collector of ashes and gar- 
bage. Note if the carts are covered; if the men take 
care not to scatter or spill or drip; if they come as often 
as they should. Note how often and how well the streets 
are cleaned. . 
Pass through the gate, examine the back premises ; 
note any broken bottle or bent metal which can hold a 
cup of water; note if roof gutters leave pools; note any 
soft refuse food for flies ; note rubbish in general... Espe- 
cially look after the garbage can; see if it is of light 
metal so that it may be cleaned on emptying. (If it is 
sunk in the ground and protected by a light frame and 
heavy cover, after the manner of the Stephenson, it keeps 
cool and does not become offensive. ) 
It is desirable that in tenement houses and small 
‘ apartment houses all garbage receptacles shall be emp-

tied and cleaned each day. Some public co-operation 
must be obtained to force this upon careless tenants. 
: If all is proved to be really clean and well cared for 
outside, pass to the area or basement door. Note if this 
space is damp. Enter the basement or cellar. Go in . 
quickly from the outside air and observe the presence of 
any kind of odor and its source—decay, mold, gas, stale 
or stuffy air. Follow into kitchen and laundry, dining 
room, hall and chambers, or such of these rooms as there 
are. Show the friend how better ventilation could be 
obtained by windows raised or lowered, and board or 
cloth screens inserted or placed outside, cross currents 
obtained, etc. Convince him that a little more coal to 
“heat all outdoors” is cheaper than loss of time and 
doctor’s bills. 
At this point let the class discuss and draw up a set 
of regulations for their own town in the light of all they 
have studied, such as would seem to be conducive to 
better sanitary conditions and not too burdensome to 
carry out either in regard to time or money. 
Then procure a copy of the Board of Health regula- 
tions for the town and for the state and compare them to 
see if anything has been omitted. 
The class may prepare cards stitable to be hung up 
in schoolrooms, or one-page circulars to be distributed 
among the people, stating clearly and concisely certain 
things we do know and avoiding sensational phrases or 
reference to things we do not know. 
Also the pupils should draw up rules of conduct for 
themselves, and once a week revise them as they find them 
too stringent or too lax. 
This kind of constructive exercise is of great value to
-P-A-G-E-89
70 Sanitation in Daily Life 
arly one. Certain difficulties stand out prominently which 
would otherwise be overlooked. 
The cost of obtaining the requisite amount of fresh 
air in a cold climate, and of maintaining the desired 
standard of cleanliness in a place where labor is dear 
and dirt abundant, should be brought out by concrete 
illustration. 
The teacher will find an excellent model in “A Hand- 
book for the Housekeepers of Chicago,” pages 16-28. 
Require only those things to be done which are 
practicable. 
EXERCISE IN PREVENTION OF DECAY—ANTISEPTICS 
Treat small bits of meat in test tubes, in salt, alcohol, 
smoke, borax, formaldehyde. 
EXERCISE IN DISINFECTION-—-STOPPAGE OF DECAY ALREADY 
BEGUN, SO THAT NO FURTHER HARM MAY COME 
Treat beef broth which has been allowed to spoil in 
test tubes, or small flasks, with heat, alcohol, formalde- 
hyde (very cautiously), corrosive sublimate, sulpho- 
naphthol, cresol, etc., to see if decay is really stopped. 
EXERCISE IN DESTRUCTION OF ORGANIC MATTER 
Put a thin slice of meat, say 14 inch thick and ¥% inch 
wide, § inch long, into a thick earthen cup in the middle 
of a layer of pounded quicklime 1 inch deep under and 
over it. The cup must be deep enough to allow the 
swelling of the quicklime as it slakes and must be set 
where the heating will do no harm; cover and leave for 
a week, then examine. Repeat with copperas, iron 
sulphate.

CHAPTER VI 
IMMUNITY. CONFIDENT LIFE. EUTHENICS 
“If our corpuscles are weaker than the invading foes, no 
drugs can save us — we are doomed. Hence the importance 
of keeping our nerve centers well charged and our minute life 
celis in vigorous condition.” — Sidney H. Beard, 
The cultivation of sanitary tastes which will enable us in- 
stinctively to avoid unclean air, doubtful food, and dirty paths 
is as much a duty as the cultivation of a taste for beauty in 
form and color. 
“We make them hope, and hope is health.” 
—B. W. Richardson, 
'N every community some persons are constantly liable 
I: disease, always ailing, while others go through 
epidemics unscathed. Common tradition attributes this 
immunity to some mysterious inherited property, just as 
little under control as the color of one’s hair or the shape 
- of one’s nose. 
It is true that a certain set of tendencies is inherited 
and that care in infancy is of extreme importance in the 
development of physical power ; but the perfecting of the 
organization lies with the individual himself, chiefly as a 
result of the habits just considered, together with those 
concerned more intimately with the individual personal 
hygiene. 
‘To be perfectly well is to be resistant to disease. 
But the strong man is careless and may drink bad water 
71
-P-A-G-E-93
72 Sanitation in Daily Life 
when he is tired or chilled, and have typhoid fever; may 
eat bad food, and be poisoned with ptomaines; may be 
sweated in bad air, and come down with pneumonia. 
These things the person sensitive to sanitary conditions 
will avoid, when one who takes no notice will not. 
There is personal immunity, good physical condition ; 
and mass immunity, good sanitary environment. The 
first is an individual matter, the second a collective social 
affair to be promoted by a consensus of opinion. 
Fear is one of the most frequent causes of illness. 
Confidence in one’s surroundings, in one’s own good con- 
dition, is half the battle. How can one have confidence 
when the senses are offended at every step, in every hall 
and shop and car? How can one gain strength from 
food served in unclean vessels on unclean tables in 
rooms swarming with flies? 
All conditions should be made right and then no one 
should worry. 
Whatever may be the ultimate cause of immunity— 
whether the care of the body-soldiers of defense, the 
phagocytes, or whether it be opsonins, or just plain good 
blood—to feel fit to rise in the morning, ready for the 
day’s work, without headache, with energy waiting to be 
used—that is confident life, that is the surest condition 
of immunity. A happy life enjoyment in work, whatever 
it may be, is the best safeguard against disease. 
Proper diet belongs under personal hygiene, but com- 
munistic living may well come under the head of sani- 
tation. It needs inspection and demands the services of 
an educated person. 
In fact, the taking of food is as much a regulated
-P-A-G-E-94
Immunity. Confident Life. Euthenics 73 
process -as breathing or drinking. Life processes cannot 
go on without-heat ; and the union of the oxygen breathed 
in with the air, joined to food stuffs eaten and digested, 
furnishes this heat as well as energy for work. : 
It is not, then, a matter of whim, or of like or dislike. 
Each one of us must eat to live, to work or play, and the 
less we think about what we eat the better, provided that 
we start with good habits, or that some one who knows 
the right food sets it before us. 
The boy or girl who expects to travel, to move about 
and see the world, should learn to eat all wholesome 
foods. One of the best assets in the Bank of Health is a 
strong appetite and a non-squeamish stomach. This or- 
gan can be strengthened or weakened like any other ; like 
an arm, or the heart, it is susceptible to mental influences. 
That is why food comes into sanitation. It is as impor- 
tant to have right ideas on food as on air, for only then 
will sufficient effort be made to get the right kind and to 
have it clean and free from objection. 
Market inspection of the strictest sort should be de- 
manded in every state or city. The buyer cannot give 
the ‘time to study with reagents and microscopes the 
bread and meat he purchases. Inspection is part of the 
city expense for which the individual householder pays 
taxes. . 
But in order not to make this an intolerable burden, 
each one should refrain from adding to the danger. The 
excrement or flesh of infected animals infects others, 
thereforéthe first law of sanitation is here also applica- 
ble—disposal of waste matter so that it will not infect 
others. We have yet to learn that this must be thor-
-P-A-G-E-95
74 Sanitation in Daily Life 
~ 
oughly done. All diseased meat should be steam treated 
and the excrement from diseased animals sterilized. 
These dangers will come in country towns rather than in 
cities, for the countryman is obliged to look after his own 
premises. 
Fruit is praised as most healthful food, but the half 
green or half decayed stuff exposed for sale, especially 
in the country village, a little out from cities, should be 
buried out of sight rather than eaten. As in all the other 
subjects treated, standards should be learned so that it 
will be easy to avoid the dangerous product. Standard 
quality will of course have its price, but will be better 
worth it. In cities much sickness comes from eating 
decayed fruit and dirty fruit. 
Avoid taking a winter diet in summer. First, because 
it is needless to force the body to manufacture heat to 
throw off by water (evaporated perspiration) ; second, 
because much of the food becomes uncertain, if not dan- 
gerous, in quality during the hot, damp weather. All 
foods decay more quickly under such conditions. Left- 
overs may be unsafe and all minces and croquettes are to 
be looked upon with suspicion in the ordinary restaurant 
and boarding house, especially in hot weather. Even 
milk is subject to the same suspicion. In fact, it is today 
one of the most difficult viands to secure in excellent 
condition. 
Sanitation in relation to food deals first with whole- 
some and clean materials—meat from animals free from 
disease, fruit and vegetables free from decay, milk, butter, 
etc., free from contained bacteria. The dangers are the 
transference to the human body of encysted organisms
-P-A-G-E-96
Immunity. Confident Life. Euthenics 75 
like trichina, of the absorption of poisonous substances, 
toxins, ptomaines; of the lodgment of germs of disease 
along with dust on berries, rough peach skins, crushed 
open fruits; of the dirt clinging to lettuce, celery, and 
such vegetables as are eaten raw. 
For the next class of dangers, we turn to the handling 
of foods with unclean hands, or the dripping of infected 
matter over clean clams or oysters. 
_ It is a safe precaution to patronize only those restau- 
rants in which the waiters are evidently trained to handle 
the food and vessels with care. The mouth habit is so 
universal that it will take years of calling attention to it 
before girls can be broken of the habit of wetting their 
fingers and smoothing their hair. Not even the waitress’ 
cap can prevent this very unsanitary habit. Boys have a 
correspondingly bad habit of wiping their hands on their 
trousers. 
In these and countless other ways disease is mysteri- 
ously spread, all due to uncleanly habits. It will pay well 
to take care of one’s hands and learn sanitary habits when 
one is young, then one will do right without effort. 
Whatever change of ideas may come with increase of 
knowledge, these habits will not need to be unlearned. 
Without knowing the reasons, they have been proclaimed 
in civilized lands. 
All evils and dangers cannot be eliminated, therefore 
we cultivate immunity, not carelessness, but that degree 
of good blood which can easily care for stray germs that 
get in. This good blood cannot be made without good 
ait.” Good food is necessary, but oxygen is essential, and 
for this reason air comes first in the study of the means 
for the best of health. 
 
-P-A-G-E-97
76 Sanitation in Daily Life 
We have one very bad habit which comes from an 
erroneous notion—the habit of going to the fire or put- 
ting on more clothes if we feel chilly. 
That feeling is due to slow circulation of the blood, 
often because it has become too thick or too loaded with 
waste products. The remedy is a glass of hot water or a 
little brisk exercise; usually both are best. 
If chilly, do not eat until warmed by a brisk walk 
about the square, or by light gymnastics. Every one 
should be trained to do three-minute exercises to start 
the circulation, “appetite exercise,” it may be called. One 
or two glasses of. water as hot as can be taken, plain 
water is best, colored by tea may serve, or hot milk may 
be taken if some time before a meal. It is the quick- 
ened circulation that is of value, to bring enough oxygen 
to the food to be used. 
There is one phase of immunity which it is well for 
the teacher to keep in mind—that of inoculation, as for 
smallpox, by vaccination. There seems to be a sort of 
self-inoculation which prevents further trouble, as in the 
case of ordinary mosquito or flea bites. The first few 
days many persons stffer greatly, but soon become im- 
mune. Whether the blood develops an antitoxin or 
' what happens is not certainly known. We become accus- 
tomed to certain conditions, and so tolerate them, but 
this belongs to another department and is only mentioned 
here because this indifference of some people living under 
the same conditions as others who are sensitive is often 
a strong argument brought up against all sanitary meas- 
ures intended to include the community. 
We were not poisoned by the water, or by the flies;
-P-A-G-E-98
Immunity. Confident Life. Euthenics 77 
why should we clean up so that these strangers can live 
here? 
Communities have accepted a degenerate life and laid 
it to the climate, when it is now known to be caused by 
some parasite, as the famous hook worm disease in the 
South and in tropical regions. The people lived a bare 
existence because of the prey of the disease, and went on 
scattering it wherever they went. Luckily they were not 
great travelers. geht! dae, fy 
Rules of Safery 
" Since diseases are most frequently conveyed by actual 
contact with persons or with fresh body wastes, sputum, 
excreta, etc., it is safest to treat all body wastes as pos- 
sibly dangerous, to avoid contact with them, and to dis- 
pose of them as soon and as completely as possible. 
Town authorities should demand isolation of, all infec- 
tious cases. ‘ 
Since dust in the air is always irritating to the deli- 
cate mucous membrane of nose, throat, and lungs, and 
thus is a cause of receptive condition for attack; and 
since objectionable organisms are frequently carried with 
other particles in the form of dust, it is safest to dispense 
with dust. 
Since dust on furniture and floors is harmless so long 
as undisturbed, it is safest to remove it without sending 
it into the air to be breathed again. A dampened cloth 
should wipe it up, not a feather duster or dry cloth, sure 
to distribute it into the air again. 
Since water and milk are frequent carriers of disease, 
both. should be under sanitary control, and the com- 
munity should pay cheerfully the price of clean supplies. 
 
-P-A-G-E-99
78 Sanitation in Daily Life 
Since produce is brought from long distances and ex- 
posed for considerable time, markets should be under 
careful inspection and buyers should inform themselves 
in regard to the cleanliness and care with which all food | 
materials are stored and handled. This will apply to 
one’s own kitchen and pantry. : 
Since all wastes may harbor unpleasant and possibly 
dangerous, agents of decay, they should be completely 
disposed sof, \ag kpon as possible; not redistributed in 
small, quantities, but. ‘burned or buried beyond recovery 
by prowling curs or rat. 
“'Since the best preyentives of germ growth are sun- 
light or cqld \heldve igo, secure as much of the first as 
possible! and keep all petishable foods below this tem- 
perature until cooked. 
Remember, sanitation is prevention, not cure. Clean- 
liness is’&bsence of smells, not addition of a strong and 
pleasant one to an unpleasant one. 
A healthy body, trained by all the rules of hygiene, 
may pass safely through the worst conditions, while a 
body weakened by self-indulgences will succumb at the 
first exposure.

  NOTE 
In the investigation of farming costs undertaken by the 
Institute for Research in Agricultural Economics the Direc- 
tor desires to acknowledge the assistance or collaboration, in 
one form or another, of the following : G. S. Bedford, Berk- 
shire County Council; B. W. Bull, Warwickshire County 
Council ; Dr. Crowther, Leeds University ; M. J. R. Dunstan, 
South-Eastern Agricultural College ; F. V. Dutton, Devon-

Haynes, Boroughs Oak, East Peckham, Kent; Professor 
Hendrick, Aberdeen University; H. E. Pollock-Hodsoll, 
Wembley, Middlesex; J. Mackintosh, University College, 
Reading; E. C. Simon (the late), Lythe Hill Farm, Hasle- 
mere; F. Strover, 16 Tokenhouse Yard, E.C.; and Professor 
T. B. Wood, Cambridge University. Further, the most cordial 
acknowledgements are due to the farmers who have been 
willing to supply the very intimate information about their 
operations necessary for the investigations of the Institute. 
For obvious reasons their share in the work cannot be re- 
corded by name, but without their help nothing could have 
been achieved, and although some of them have been un- 
able, from various causes, to bring their work to the stage 
of full fruition their interest is none the less appreciated. 
All the members of the Institute have participated in the 
work of producing this Report,in varying degrees, but special 
reference must be made to the share taken by Mr. A. Loose 
in the more responsible parts, in which his technical 
knowledge has been of the utmost value. The junior 
members of the staff deserve credit for the way in which
-P-A-G-E-6

they have persisted in the routine work, without any 
abatement of energy, in what were, sometimes, rather dis- 
couraging circumstances. Four members of the Institute 
have joined the Army, and the Director records with deep 
regret the death of Private F. H. Upfold (0. B. L. I.) in action, 
in France, on July 14, 1916. His brother, Lance-Corpl. 8. J. 
Upfold (O. B. L. I.), was wounded and invalided home at the 
same time. The Director also desires to place on record the 
services to the Institute of the late Mr. E. O. R. Wakeman, 
B.A., St. John’s College (Lieut. Grenadier Guards), who was 
killed in action at Festubert in May 1915. Although no 
longer a member of the Institute at the time of his taking 
a commission in the Army, Mr. Wakeman was the first 
assistant appointed to it when it was started in 1913, and he 
took an active share in the earlier stages of this part of 
its work.

  CHAPTER I 
GENERAL INTRODUCTION 
Tue need for cost analysis in connexion with productive 
enterprise is one which has grown up gradually with the 
growth of industry. It has been pointed out that when pro- 
duction was effected by manual labour, either under a more 
or less primitive factory system, or in a cottage industry, 
intricate accounting was not required ; but the rapid changes 
in industrial conditions, due to the introduction of labour- 
saving machinery and the specialization of labour, have 
led to processes of manufacture so intricate and on such 
a scale that ‘it is only by means of systematic records that 
leakage, waste, and fraud can be prevented, and that em- 
ployers can know the cost of any article of their manufacture, 
and be able to determine accurately and scientifically, not 
merely approximately and by haphazard, the actual profit 
they make or loss they sustain, not only on the aggregate 
transactions during a given period, but also upon each indi- 
vidual transaction.... There is always the danger, where 
only the general result of a business is known, of depart- 
ments or processes which are relatively unremunerative 
being unduly fostered, and of those which yield more than 
the average profit not receiving adequate attention’.' Side 
by side with these results comparisons can be made of the 
advantages of alternative processes, of the efficiency of 
different machines, and of various grades of labour, whilst 
a proper system of record-keeping enables the management 
to know, from day to day, the stocks of goods and materials 
on hand as accurately as the cash balance is known, and so 
to prevent an undue accumulation of capital in unproductive 
forms. 
Thus, scientific book-keeping becomes the keystone of the 
productive enterprise, upon which the stability of the whole

LO . GENERAL INTRODUCTION 
  structure of industry depends. Its advantages have received 
general recognition in all countries where the factory or 
industrial system has been developed, but in regard to the 
great industry of agriculture the possibility of a more eco- 
nomic control of production by its means is only very slowly 
being realized. Agriculture has advanced slowly, but 
steadily, from the self-sufficing stage, and, although the 
tendency to promote the greater efficiency of labour by an 
increase of capital in the form of machinery equipment has 
been still more gradual,! the modern farm approaches daily 
more nearly, in its organization, to the urban industrial 
concern. If farming in this country is to hold its own in 
competition with other forms of enterprise it can only be by 
the adoption of an organization which will result in a reward 
to the capitalist and to the worker compatible with that 
yielded by industrial production, and to do this a study of 
processes of production and of results, by means of scientific 
book-keeping, is equally essential on the farm as in the factory. 
Experience teaches that the problem of the determination of 
costs in farming is difficult and complex, more so, probably, 
than in other industries, but it is, none the less, equally 
important that it should be examined with the same degree 
of detail and of thoroughness. 
The object of this preliminary study is to discuss method, 
and to show, in certain cases, illustrations of its application. 
There is, at present, too little agreement among research 
workers upon questions of principle. In many Continental 
countries and in America, as well as in Britain, many in- 
vestigations into agricultural costs have been made”, and the 
student of them cannot fail to be impressed with the fact that 
whereas, obviously, there can be no uniformity of practice in 
the technicalities of book-keeping processes in all countries, 
nor, indeed, is any such necessary, there is also no consensus 
of opinion upon vital matters of method and of principle, 
} The efficiency of labour employed in agriculture is higher, probably, 
in the United Kingdom than in any European country. See reference 
to German agriculture on p. 67. 
? See Bibliography, p. 121.
-P-A-G-E-11
  GENERAL INTRODUCTION ll 
upon which all must be agreed if results reliable in them- 
selves and comparable one with another are to be obtained. 
Thus, the question at issue at this stage is less the production 
of costs from which generalizations can be drawn than the 
prior consideration of the determination of points which 
relate to an exact system of analytical or cost accounting 
applied to farming. 
Nor is the question under discussion at the moment the 
consideration of whether such method, or some modification 
of it, can be adopted for ordinary farm accounts. The ques- 
tion of farm accounts in practice is a matter of marginal 
utility. In industry it has been the experience of factory 
managers that it is economical to introduce methods of con- 
trol which, in themselves, appear to add to the cost of pro- 
duction, and many of those who have made it their business 
to study the problem of agricultural production are of the 
opinion that this will be, one day, the experience of farm 
managers likewise. There is, however, a degree of exactness, 
required in cost determinations which may be so troublesome, 
and so expensive of time and labour when judged by the 
general standard of the business organization of the average 
farm, that it would not be profitable for the ordinary farmer. 
But this possibility does not affect the importance of having, 
in a number of cases, an exhaustive and scientific analysis of 
farming costs, and if thiscan be done in a number of typical 
farms the results will have a value as supplying standards of 
comparison. In this work the Institute for Research in 
Agricultural Economics is still at the beginning, and it has 
not yet reached the stage at which generalizations can be 
made. 
It cannot be stated too plainly, therefore, that it ‘is with 
the discussion and illustration of the method of scientific 
analysis of farming costs that this Report is concerned, 
rather than with the results attained to, so far, by its appli- 
cation. But although information of general application is 
not yet forthcoming, students of farm economics will realize 
that a thorough analysis, even of only a few actual cases, 
based on records carefully and systematically kept, is of 
 
-P-A-G-E-12
12 : GENERAL INTRODUCTION 
  interest and value, for it will be admitted that certain com- 
paratively constant factors may be discerned even in a small 
amount of exact data, while, at the same time, contrasts and 
variations will be noted which challenge attention. 
Further, the analysis of such accounts brings out the need 
for method even more exact than has yet been found possible. 
Problems are encountered which call for discussion amongst 
those interested before satisfactory solutions can be expected, 
and illustrations of this will be noted in cases which occur 
where information is lacking which should be available in an 
exact system of records. (See, for example, pp.74and 79.) It 
is hoped that the discussion and study of these matters will 
lead to an extension of research work, by means of scientific 
book-keeping, on the economies of farming, and that it may 
induce a certain number of farmers who are interested in 
the thorough examination of their costs of production to 
undertake, for at least a certain period of time, the recording 
and analysis of their expenditure by exact methods. 
Not only is a standard system of cost analysis essential 
to the determination of comparative costs in this country, 
but it is also demanded to enable comparisons to be made 
between Home costs and those of the Dominions and of 
foreign countries whose products compete in our markets. 
In many cases it is their costs, and not our own, which are 
the determining factor in fixing market prices. In the case 
of wheat-production, for example, the exploitation of virgin 
soils, with the aid of railway development and labour-saving 
machinery, may drive the price of wheat down below cost, 
through over-production, as was the case in the early nineties, 
or a partial failure of the crop combined with transport 
difficulties may lift the price far above that which might be 
regarded as giving a fair commercial return to the producer, 
as is the case at the present moment; but in the long run 
the determining factor is the cost of production in those 
countries which constitute our main sources of supply, so that 
accurate information on this point is of vital importance for 
guidance in the framing of national agricultural policy.
-P-A-G-E-13
  CHAPTER II 
DETERMINATION OF METHOD 
THERE are two methods in use for the determination of 
farming costs, (1) the analytical, (2) the synthetic. The 
latter is not practised in this country, but certain Con- 
tinental farm-accountants, particularly Dr. Ernst Laur, 
advocate its use very warmly as giving certain results with 
less labour and at less risk of error than are involved in the 
analytical method. It seems to be especially useful in 
simple forms of farming, where few products are concerned, 
and the analytical method is probably more useful in 
connexion with the highly-developed mixed farms of this 
country. 
It is the analytical method which is pursued in the 
investigations of the Institute for Research in Agricultural 
Economics. It is practised with the aid of ordinary double- 
entry book-keeping, a familiarity‘with ‘the principles of 
which on the part of readers of this Report is assumed, and 
it is based on the compilation of accurate records of the 
application of capital and labour to food-production on the 
farm. The results of the analysis of thése yécords entered 
into account books on the double-entry principle provide 
the manager with a financial review of the results of his 
management in all departments. 
The -first record necessary is that showing the distribution 
of the capital’ invested in the farm. In the case of a farm 
already in operation this will be less a record than an 
estimation, for the farmer, or other investigator, will have 
no reliable data of the nature of records from which to com- 
pile his figures. An appraisement of the capital laid out in 
the various branches of the enterprise, and in the means 
 
-P-A-G-E-14
  14 DETERMINATION OF METHOD 
of production must be made, about which more will be 
found in the following chapter (p. 31). 
An important adjunct to the Capital record which is 
rarely or never met with on the farm, but the value of which 
is universally recognized in industry, is the Stock Book. 
This, as its name implies, is a register of the stock-in-hand 
on the farm, that is to say the dead-stock. As a matter 
of convenience the larger farm implements and farm 
machinery are better dealt with apart from the smaller 
things and the consumable stores of the farm, and a method 
of recording them is discussed below, but all the small tools 
and parts of machines, the stores of feeding-stuffs, the 
artificial manures, sheep-dips, binder-twine, and miscel- 
laneous stores—all of these should be inventoried in the 
Stock Book at their cost price. Fresh purchases should be 
debited, and everything given out for use or consumption 
should be credited in this Stock Book, so that a record is 
kept of the use of material and of the quantity in stock, 
and the value of it all at cost price. The book hardly 
needs any special rulings, or if such appear necessary they 
will readily be devised to meet individual requirements. 
For an implement record and valuation a different form 
may be suggested for the Stock Book, so as to show the 
implements and machinery grouped as they are required 
for the various departments, and with provision for writing 
off their depreciation annually. All these things must be 
valued at the outset at cost less depreciation, or if they are 
new, at cost, and in each succeeding year provision must be 
made for the depregiation which has occurred through use 
and age. The usual way of providing for depreciation is to 
knock off a fixed percentage at the close of the year from 
the total value when the year began. This is objectionable 
because it is only a rough approximation, and because the 
percentage deducted is very often insufficient, particularly 
in the case of implements bought new. The better plan is 
to consider each implement by itself and to assign it a life. 
The depreciation will then be got by dividing the cost or 
value by the number of years’ life. Many tools and imple-
-P-A-G-E-15
  DETERMINATION OF METHOD 15 
ments will always have a certain value, whatever their age, 
if they are kept in repair, so that it is not always desirable 
to depreciate the value of an article down to nothing. 
A ‘limit of depreciation ’ is fixed, and when that figure has 
been reached no further deduction is made, but the article 
is carried forward year by year at the same price. To take 
an example, a set of harrows may be worth 50s., and it will 
be safe to give them a life of twenty years. This means 
that 2s. 6d. per annum must be deducted for depreciation, 
but if the harrows are kept in repair they will always have 
a certain value, say 10s., so that after sixteen years, when 
the harrows will stand in the inventory at 10s., no further 
depreciation need be allowed. 
This may appear for the moment a somewhat complicated 
and troublesome method of valuation, but by ruling the 
Inventory Book in the manner shown, the operation becomes 
a very clear and simple one, whilst it has the great advantage 
of reasonable accuracy. The value of each group of imple- 
ments and the depreciation on them in any year become, 
first, a sum in subtraction and then a sum in addition. 
Several years can be provided for, but to avoid confusion in 
the future it must be remembered to leave a considerable 
space at the end of each group when writing out the 
Inventory for the first time, to allow for purchases in the 
coming years. In Table I is given an example of the 
Implements and Machinery Book.! 
The next essential is a record of the application of labour, 
both manual and horse. Time-sheets are used to facilitate 
its preparation, and these are handed out to the men on 
pay-day, to be filled up by them and brought back at the 
close of the week. 
The Time-sheet provides space for detailing the work 
done by the man throughout the week, and for recording 
the number of horses worked by him on any job. The time 
should be recorded in hours, for in no other way can any- 
thing approaching accuracy be obtained when men are 
moving from one piece of work to another, at short intervals.

Moreover, the greater the minuteness of division, within 
workable limits, the greater will be the incentive to the 
men to make their entries carefully and to appreciate the 
value of time. More commonly, however, it is in days, 
half-days, and quarter-days that farm labour is recorded.

It is noted by Messrs. Garcke and Fells that to require men 
to keep simple records of time and materials has been found, 
in industry, to have a good moral effect and to inspire con- 
fidence in the management!; and in the rare cases in 
which the custom of using Time-sheets has been adopted on 
the farm, a similar good effect has been observed. 
As regards crops, the men can record their time either 
under the name of the crop on which they are engaged 
(‘ploughing for wheat’), or under the name of the crop and 
also of the field in which it is growing, or is to be grown 
(‘ploughing for wheat, field 43’). Men working with live 
stock (other than working horses) record their time according 
to the classification of stock adopted by the farmer for the 
purposes of cost calculation (for example, ‘ two hours milking, 
1 op. cit., p. 9.
-P-A-G-E-19
  DETERMINATION OF METHOD 19 
seven hours with sheep’, or ‘two hours milking, seven hours 
preparing food and feeding cows’). 
When all the Time-sheets have been brought in, the 
week’s work on the farm is transcribed on to one com- 
prehensive Labour-sheet. This can be made to act also as 
a pay-sheet. Spaces are provided for the names of the 
workmen, for their employment each day, and for the 
number of horses, just as on the Time-sheets. Then follow 
columns to give the number of days worked, and to record 
not only the cash wages received during the week, but also 
the weekly value of all allowances and payments in kind. 
From these figures is calculated the total cost for each man 
of the week’s work, and thus the cost of each man’s work 
per day. The weekly value of the perquisites is arrived at 
by totalling the value of all the annual allowances, such as 
free cottages, potatoes, pork, &c. Special payments for 
lambs, calves, harvest, and so forth are, of course, excluded 
from this summary and are charged direct, as paid, to the 
respective accounts concerned with them. Piece-work and 
overtime, beer-money, &c., on particular jobs are easily 
included on the Labour-sheets without special provision. 
The next record necessarily kept on the farm is that of 
the live stock, and the foods they consume. The informa- 
tion required is a weekly register of the various classes of 
live stock, with the numbers of each born and bought, died 
and sold, or transferred from one class to another during 
the week; a statement of the foods consumed by each 
class, and a record of the place where the foods were fed— 
that is, whether on the land or in yards and buildings. 
To provide this information clearly and concisely a form 
has been prepared, and a copy is given as Table IV. 
Its use is fairly obvious. The only thing, probably, which 
calls for explanation is the provision of ‘Transferred’ 
columns in the Live Stock register. These are to enable the 
farm accountant to keep track of the interchange of stock 
between the various classes. Thus, a heifer may be classed 
for feeding purposes with ‘dry ’ cows one week, but having 
calved and come into the dairy herd during the week

following the change is noted in the record by an entry 
against ‘cows in milk’ in the ‘transferred in’ column, and 
by a corresponding one against ‘dry cows and heifers in 
calf’ in the ‘transferred out’ column. The columns pro- 
vided for the food-consumption record may be filled in 
either with the actual total weights of food used, or with 
a statement of the rations being fed; in the latter case the 
weights must be multiplied out by the farm accountant. 
Next, a record must be kept of the application of manures 
to the various fields, both farmyard and artificial. No- 
special form is required for this record—indeed, a mere note 
made on the Labour-sheet to the effect that the manure 
carting recorded on field so-and-so included so many loads, 
or that the men sowing artificials on such and such a pasture 
put on so many tons of fertilizer, is an excellent means by 
which to record these facts to ensure that they will not be 
overlooked, and the Stock Book (p. 14) will also serve as 
a record of the distribution of artificial manure. 
The only other record needed is one of receipts and pay-

ments. This, of course, is absolutely necessary, and it must 
include everything bought or sold for the farm, whilst 
excluding the farmer’s private expenses. It is, in fact, 
a simple but complete cash account. 
Nothing else need be required of a farmer co-operating 
with a research institution in the work of the determination 
of farming costs, and the necessary information is so easily 
and simply provided on the special forms suggested, or on 
some similar forms, that the returns should not occupy more 
than an hour or so in each week on farms where the number 
of men employed does not run above, say, a dozen. The 
objection urged by critics against the system on the score 
of time and trouble demanded is quite without foundation ; 
the Labour-sheet entails the most work, but this is nearly 
always reduced from the maximum theoretically required 
by the fact that a considerable proportion of the men will 
be found to have been engaged throughout the week on the 
same piece of work continuously, and one entry only, 
instead of six, is called for. Thus, however busy a man
-P-A-G-E-24
  24 DETERMINATION OF METHOD 
may be about his farm he cannot sustain the plea of having 
no time in which to put down the data necessary as a basis 
for the examination of his business organization. 
It is a somewhat different matter when one turns to the 
analysis and elaboration of the farmer’s data, and here, in 
all probability, he will always require assistance. In the 
illustrations contained in this Report, this work is under- 
taken by the Institute. In private practice there is no 
reason at all why the farmer should not employ his own 
clerk, or an accountant in the nearest town, or why a group 
of farmers in one locality should not combine to employ 
a competent recorder between them. In other businesses 
of no greater magnitude than that of many farms it is not 
customary to dispense with all financial records, neither is 
it common for the head of the business to act as his own 
accountant, and when farmers begin to assign to book- 
keeping something more nearly approaching to its proper 
place as the only sure means by which to test and control 
their management, they will not grudge the comparatively 
trifling expenditure which will be called for in connexion 
with it. In the meantime there seems to be scope for much 
educational and research work on the part of those who 
are interested in the development of farm management, 
if a joint effort could be made, by which the farmer would 
provide the data which the student of farm economics 
would elaborate. 
Having now dealt with the general form of the various 
farm records, a few points still remain for consideration 
before passing on to the question of analysis. These relate 
to the classification of the matter comprised in the records, 
so as to promote the accuracy of the final result. In 
describing the use of the Labour-sheet it was stated that the 
record of the application of labour could be made either 
under the headings of the various crops, or of the various 
fields (p. 18). This statement calls for some elaboration. 
In working out the cost of the crops on a farm the most 
obvious thing is to classify the expenditure of capital and 
labour under headings (i.e. in accounts) consisting of the
-P-A-G-E-25
DETERMINATION OF METHOD 25 
names of those crops, and as a matter of fact this is done 
not infrequently. Thus, the wheat fields constitute one 
account, the turnip fields another, the pastures a third, and 
so on, and all items of expense are recorded with a view to 
their ultimate assembling under these various heads, to give 
the cost of production in every case. If the whole expendi- 
ture necessary to raise each crop began and ended within 
the year this arrangement could not be bettered, but 
unfortunately the determination of farming costs is not so 
simple a matter, and it will be found, in practice, that there 
are few crops that do not inherit some benefit from their 
predecessors, or which do not hand on some unexhausted 
value to their successors, all of which must be recorded. 
It is not impossible to keep track of such matters in an 
analysis of labour and of other expenditure based on the 
crops grown: indeed, examples of this will be found in this 
Report (see Chapter IV). But a more satisfactory basis 
is afforded by the fields which grow the crops than by 
the crops themselves. It may happen that the barley 
crop of a farm is made up of fields on which it follows 
a variety of crops, such as roots and clover and wheat; and, 
in its turn, it may be succeeded by a variety of crops, such 
as clover, turnips, or a corn crop. Whilst it is not impossible 
in such a case to obtain a correct figure for the barley cost 
by means of a record based on work done for the crop as 
a whole, it will be obvious that the liability to error would 
be reduced if the basis adopted were one of fields, for, in 
the absence of absolute uniformity in the rotation, the work 
of tracing values inherited or transmitted from crop to crop 
would be facilitated. Moreover, it happens frequently 
enough that at the time when the year’s record-keeping 
begins the farmer’s plans for the coming season’s cropping 
are not definite, or, if arranged, it may be that circumstances 
unforeseen will compel some alteration in them. Thus, in 
the year 1913, many fields designed for the root crop on an 
East Midlands farm were never sown at all, owing to the 
drought, and the cost of all the workings on them, which 
would have been mixed up in the ‘ Roots Account’ under
-P-A-G-E-26
26 DETERMINATION OF METHOD 
  a system of record based on crops, was readily transferred to 
the ‘Fallows Account’, under a system of field records, when 
it was found that the fields could not be cropped. Further, 
field records have a value of their own, for they facilitate 
the compilation of labour costs, both actual and comparative, 
and of other results which cannot be arrived at satisfactorily 
under the alternative system. 
In the case of the farm live stock it is of equal importance 
to secure the proper classification for the records. It is not 
easy, sometimes, to arrange a division, say, of cattle, most 
suitable for the accounts which, at the same time, will fit in 
with the practice of feeding and management on the farm, 
particularly on small farms. It happens, not infrequently, 
that classes, the feeding and tending of which should be 
‘recorded separately for the purposes of cost determination, 
are not distinguished by the farmer. Probably his experience 
will one day confirm that of the manufacturer, and the extra 
expense necessary for the compilation of complete records will 
be found to be more than repaid by the information acquired, 
but at present: this stage has not been reached. On the 
other hand, it is of equal importance not to get involved in 
unnecessary detail. On a farm where the sole object of the 
management of the cattle is the production of milk it may 
fairly be said that the cost of raising calves to supply the 
herd, and the cost of feeding-off old cows no longer profit- 
able in the dairy, are both of them incidental to the milk 
production, and one record which includes the cost of 
feeding and tending calves, dairy cows, and fatting cows is 
all that is needed where the determination of the cost of 
milk is the only object. 
One other difficulty which arises in the compilation of 
farm records is due to the partial failure, hitherto, to realize 
that agriculture is an industry as well as an art. No one 
would suggest that steel rails should be sold by the heap, or 
that tiles should be offered by the kiln-ful, yet similar sale 
units are the rule rather than the exception in agriculture. 
Hay is sold by the stack, potatoes change hands by the acre, 
and live stock are bought and sold almost universally by the
-P-A-G-E-27
  DETERMINATION OF METHOD 27 
head. It is no answer to say that to the experienced farmer 
and dealer these conditions are no obstacle, owing to their 
ability to determine weights with reasonable accuracy by 
inspection, for this is not a fact. Last summer a farmer of 
wide experience and sound judgment sold a stack of hay to 
a dealer at a price per ton, both of them agreeing as to an 
estimate of the weight of hay contained. Before delivery 
was taken the Army Purchasing Officer commandeered the 
hay, and, buying it by actual weight, the farmer lost about 
£100 as compared with his first sale. Thus, an experienced 
farmer, and a dealer who is buying hay every day, both 
over-estimated the contents of the stack by some 17 tons. 
Probably dealers are more correct in their estimates, as 
a rule, than farmers, having greater opportunity for testing 
their judgments, but this is by the way, and leaving the 
question of relative loss and gain arising out of this slip- 
shod method of marketing, the point for the moment is that 
the acquisition of knowledge of farming costs is impossible 
under it, and this alone should be sufficient to condemn it. 
In connexion with the analysis of farm records at the Insti- 
tute it has been found impossible to produce any figures for 
the cost of meat, or of store cattle, of potatoes, mangolds, 
or of turnips and the farmer will continue to be at a 
serious disadvantage in the development of his work until 
this disability is removed. The hope may be expressed 
that other research institutions equipped with farms of their 
own will take up the investigation of costs, so that these 
blanks in farmers’ records may be filled. 
With the records of the distribution of capital, of the 
expenditure of labour, of sales and purchases, and of the 
weight of products realized, all noted in a form as complete 
as may be, the work of analysis next calls for consideration. 
The Labour-sheet figures are transferred to an Analysis- 
sheet, a copy of which is printed here as Table V. It is 
little more than a number of money columns, each set 
headed with the title of the accounts or departments of the 
farm. At the beginning are columns, referring to the 
Labour-sheet, for entering the men’s numbers and rates of

as recorded on the Labour-sheet, an analysis is made, and 
the work in the different departments is priced. The cost 
of the horse labour cannot be determined until the end of 
the year, when the cost of keeping the horses is known, so 
that the record of days of horse-work begun in the Labour- 
sheet is continued also in the Analysis-sheet, a column / 
headed ‘Horses’ being attached to each set of money columns 
for the purpose. The horse-days in each department are 
cast up week by week, and by dividing the total number 
of days at the end of the year into the total cost of keeping 
the horses, the cost of a horse-day is found. The accuracy 
of the analysis of labour can be checked by casting the 
columns both ways and comparing the totals with those in

Coming to the Live Stock and Foods record, all foods are 
debited as bought, in the first instance, to a Foods account, 
and then by means of the food-consumption record the 
quantities and prices of bought foods are worked out, and 
also the value of the food-residues as given in Voelcker and 
Hall’s Tables. Thus, the charge against the stock is arrived 
at, and also that against the manure. It is in this connexion 
that the value arises of the record of the place where con- 
sumed, i.e. ‘field or yard’. If consumed on the field, the 
value of the residue is charged against that field; if con- 
sumed in yards, the value is charged against the farmyard

manure account. Home-grown foods are priced at their cost 
to the farmer.! Sometimes the cost cannot be determined 
until the end of the year, and then it is only necessary to 
calculate weights, and carry these on until prices can be 
assigned to them. Skill can be exercised in avoiding 
unnecessary calculations. For example, although it is very 
desirable to be able to work out the cost of growing a ton of 
turnips it isnot necessary to try to estimate the weight 
of roots consumed by sheep folded on turnips, and to 
multiply it out, week by week, by the number of head, and 
then to price it at the cost per ton. If the sheep consume 
the whole of the crop, or the whole of the crop in any 
particular field or fields, it will be necessary only to refer to 
the cost of the whole crop, as worked out in the field accounts 
in the ledger, or of that part consumed by the sheep, and 
then to charge it against them by one entry. Analytical 
accounting makes sufficient work without the undertaking 
of more than that which will be productive of useful 
knowledge. 
The analysis of other cash payments involves no special 
machinery. Tradesmen’s bills can be split up in the cash- 
book, where necessary, and the component parts carried to 
the respective departmental accounts. Or, in particular 
cases, as for example, bought manures, it may be more con- 
venient to debit a ledger account with the whole item 
and charge it out by piecemeal with the aid of the Stock 
Book. 
1 This involves a question of principle which is discussed on p. 36.

CHAPTER III 
QUESTIONS OF PRINCIPLE 
In view of the probability of an extension of the work of 
investigating farming costs it is very important to secure 
uniformity of method and general agreement on certain 
questions of principle, so far as is possible. Inno other way 
can a proper basis of comparison be established, and standard 
results achieved. Reference has been made already to the 
wide divergences of opinion on vital questions exhibited in 
the work of Continental and American investigators, and an 
effort should be made, while this field of research is still 
practically unexplored in this country, to bring about 
a general agreement on essentials. In this chapter some of 
these points are raised, less, it should be remarked, with the 
object of answering them than with that of initiating the 
consideration and discussion of them. 
Valuation. In making farm valuations the basis must 
be, in every case, the cost of production of the matter 
concerned. Under no cireumstances must the market price 
be allowed to exert any influence, or serious misconceptions 
may result. The worth of any article to the farmer is the 
price it has cost him to produce, and the time to introduce 
the market value into the account is at the moment when it 
is sold, and not until then, so that the farmer may be in 
a position to make a comparison between the value to him, 
as shown by his books, and the value on the market as shown 
by the price realized. Thushe is able at once to appreciate 
the results of his management. If market values are intro- 
duced at intermediate stages in the process of production the 
whole basis of comparison is lost, and thus the farmer is 
deprived of the only reliable means by which to estimate
-P-A-G-E-32
oe 
32 ~ QUESTIONS OF PRINCIPLE 
the success of his policy, and by which to determine his 
future actions. | 
: The common practiceof basing farm valuations upon market 
prices is another illustration of the misconception of facts 
which may arise, in connexion with farm management, 
owing to the absence of proper records. A valuation of live 
and dead stock and of tenant-right may be needed, and there 
are no figures on the farm from which to extract it. An 
inventory is easily made, and when it becomes necessary to 
assign a price to each of the articles composing it the obvious 
and natural thing is to apply the only known values, namely, 
those current at the time in the market, regardless of the 
fact that these represent that which the articles are worth to 
other people rather than their value to the individual most 
concerned. Indeed, in the absence of accounts it is almost 
impossible to make a valuation except on the basis of market 
prices, for these, at least, can be ascertained and applied, 
whereas there is nothing to indicate to the farmer what his 
outlay has been on the various subjects of the valuation. 
Where an adequate system of records exists, the process of 
valuation is quite mechanical. The departmental accounts 
will show, at the moment when the valuation is to be made, 
the cost of every item at that date, and this cost is the 
measure of their value to the farmer. If the cost proves 
subsequently to be above the market value, the farmer makes 
a loss on his product; if it be below the market price he 
makesa profit. In the former case he will review the figures, 
‘ and the circumstances attending the production, to determine 
whether the loss is due to causes beyond his control which 
are not likely to recur, or whether the probability of a repe- 
tition makes it undesirable to continue along this particular 
line; in the latter case he can contrast one profitable venture 
with another with the object of narrowing down his system 
of management, so far as possible, so as to concentrate his 
efforts on those which are most profitable with a view to 
developing them still further. Judging from the experience 
gained on those farms from which records are sent regularly 
to the Institute for analysis, there must be many holdings
-P-A-G-E-33
QUESTIONS OF PRINCIPLE 33 
on which capital and labour are being employed unprofitably 
in one or more directions owing to the absence of any system 
of valuation by which the farmer can compare his costs with 
the realized price. 
In all farm valuations, then, the basis must be the cost 
price, but it must be noted that the application of the 
principle raises certain problems which call for further con- 
sideration and discussion amongst investigators before it can 
be assumed that the most satisfactory solutions have been 
found. What, for example, is the cost of a new-born animal? 
In the case of a foal it might be said to represent the stud 
fee and the cost of food and attendance for the mare for the 
period during which she was not at work up to the birth of 
the foal, but in the case of calves and lambs even this rather 
doubtful estimate cannot be made. At the Institute the 
practice is to assume a value dependent on circumstances for 
the new-born animal whatever it may be, and it is difficult 
to see how a more scientific basis can be established. 
Starting with this assumed value it is a fairly easy matter 
to calculate the cost of the young animal, year by year, until 
it is sold as a store, or fat to the butcher, until it is taken 
into the breeding stud, herd, or flock, or until, in the case of 
horses, it is sold or put to work on the farm. Those animals 
retained on the farm for breeding purposes or for work should 
be valued thereafter at the total cost of bringing them up to 
that stage,and no more. Thus, if a heifer has cost £18 to 
keep up to the time of her first calf, she will be valued so long 
as she remains in the herd at this figure, and a young horse . 
that has cost £35 up to the time when it is broken for work 
will stand in the books at this price thereafter. These are 
the sums that it has cost the farmer to bring these animals 
to a productive stage. The further expense of maintaining 
them year by year is not an addition to the cost of the animals, 
but represents the value, to the farmer, of their produce; 
whether it be work done, as in the case of horses; milk and 
calves, as in the case of cattle; or lambs and wool, as in the 
case of sheep. Thus, the breeding animals on a farm and 
the working horses which have reached the productive stage, 
2041 Co
-P-A-G-E-34
34 QUESTIONS OF PRINCIPLE 
are valued year by year at a constant figure of so much per 
head, representing their cost to the farmer at that stage. 
A little experience will tell the farmer what that cost is, 
under normal circumstances, and will enable him to apply 
an average figure to all animals in the same category. 
Under no circumstances whatever must the market value at 
the date of the valuation be allowed to obtrude itself. To 
introduce market values robs the figures entirely of their 
use, for it is impossible, thereafter, for the farmer to make 
the comparison necessary from time to time to decide him 
in the matter of the sale or retention of any individual or 
group of individuals in his flocks and herds. With their 
costs before him a familiarity with the trend of the market 
will enable him to consider the advantages of either course, 
but once let the true facts of his own experience, as revealed in 
his books, give place to values assigned by others as applicable 
to their own cases, and all basis for the comparison is lost. 
Moreover, valuation of live stock on the basis of market 
values at the time will confuse the farmer by the introduction 
of paper profits and paper losses into his results, Farm 
management is not subject, usually, to violent or sudden 
changes, whereas markets are apt to experience considerable 
fluctuations. In the case of breeding stock, particularly, 
which is not shortly to be realized the fluctuations of the 
market may bring about startling results. A shortage of 
keep at home, or the closing of foreign ports, may bring 
about a fall in prices sufficient to turn a profitable year into 
one, apparently, of serious loss if these prices are employed 
as a basis for the valuation of stock which is not for sale ; 
similarly, a temporary inflation of values from any cause 
might lead the farmer to unwarranted optimism regard- 
ing his financial position. It follows that no account must 
be taken of ‘pedigree’ value. Pedigree value is essentially 
a market value, not a cost value, and anything may happen 
to make it of no value at all. A colt with a pedigree back 
to Eclipse may prove of no more worth than to pull a green- 
grocer’s cart; a heifer with a splendid milk pedigree proves, 
not infrequently, to be of no special value at the pail, and 
 
-P-A-G-E-35
QUESTIONS OF PRINCIPLE 35 
even though it be otherwise, an accident, or an outbreak of 
disease, may wipe off the whole of the value due to long 
pedigree in a few minutes. There must be no departure 
under any circumstances from the principle of valuation at 
the cost of production ; on no other basis will the farmer's 
accounts act as an index of the success or otherwise of his 
management. 
In the case of purchased pedigree stock the principles laid 
down here seem to contradict themselves, in that if the cost 
to the farmer is to be followed then pedigree value must be 
recognized. The difficulty is more apparent than real, for 
in purchasing pedigree stock the farmer is really buying 
two things, and the purchase price is resolvable into two 
parts: (1) the cost of the animal as one of its class; (2) its 
additional value, present and potential, arising from its 
pedigree. Having regard to the disparity in the prices paid 
for pedigree as compared with ordinary or market stock, 
not only is it the right course, but as a matter of prudence it 
is the necessary course, to split the total value, as marked by 
price, into the value of the animal as stock of normal class 
at ordinary cost, and its additional value as stock of an 
abnormal or pedigree class. The former value will be charged 
against the particular live stock account to which the animal 
properly belongs, and the latter value will be debited to 
a ‘ Pedigree-value’ account. If the purchased pedigree 
stock is retained for service on the farm, and is thus de- 
creasing in value, a proportionate part of the pedigree value 
should be written off each year. If the animal is sold at 
any time at less than the combined values at which it 
appears in the ordinary stock account and in the Pedigree- 
value account, the amount of the deficiency should also be 
written off in the year’s Profit and Loss account, and simi- 
larly, if a higher price than the combined values were 
realized the difference would be treated as profit. If by 
disease or accident the value of purchased pedigree stock is 
reduced, the Pedigree-value account should be reduced to 
correspond, or should be entirely written off if necessary. 
1 A Pedigree-value account has some analogy to Goodwill account, though

  36 QUESTIONS OF PRINCIPLE 
Valuation of Intermediate Products. The need for accurate 
analytical accounting is evidenced in nothing, perhaps, so 
much as in the confusion of thought which prevails on the 
question of the valuation of the intermediate products of 
the farm, the hay, straw, roots, pasturage, &c., produced for 
home consumption in the process of manufacturing milk and 
meat. There is only one possible basis of value, namely, the 
cost to the farmer, but, just as in other valuations, the fact 
that there are no records of cost drives the farmer to use 
other comparisons, and the market value, or in rare cases 
a scientific unit, such as the starch equivalent, is substituted 
for the sum which the farmer has actually paid As 
a matter of fact, the bulky feeding-stuffs usually produced 
and consumed at home rarely have any market value at all. 
A market value is one that can be realized in the market. 
Thus wheat, beef, and other commodities have clearly 
market value because they are always saleable, but if all the 
farmers in the country decided to sell their mangolds they 
would find that the market for mangolds is non-existent, 
and that the prices quoted in market reports represent a few 
deals to satisfy an infinitesimal demand. The same is true 
of straw, and in a slightly less degree of hay. 
Even if the difficulty of fixing the market prices of certain 
products, such as turnips, or even hay, be ignored, and if it be 
assumed that there is a free market in such things, a fuller 
consideration of what the farmer really does in feeding them 
to his stock will show how inapplicable such values are to 
his case. The market value of an article is the figure at 
which a willing buyer and a willing seller can agree to do 
business. The farmer who contends that he is justified in 
it is suggested that a closer comparison could be established with Patent 
Rights account as being exposed to greater vicissitude than Goodwill. 
1 Since this was written the controversy in the newspapers upon the 
increased cost of food-production has shown how universal is this miscon- 
ception of facts. All the writers make such assertions as that their horse 
labour costs them double what it did, because oats are selling for twice as 
much as they used to do, or that the fact that hay has doubled in price makes 
the milk their cows produce so much the more costly. This is as much as to 
say that if a man buys a 4 per cent, stock at 50, and it rises subsequently to 
par, he is only getting 4 per cent. on his money.
-P-A-G-E-37
  QUESTIONS OF PRINCIPLE 37 
‘selling’ his roots or hay to his stock is selling them, in 
point of fact, to himself, and seeing that there is only one 
party to the transaction there can be no market, and con- 
sequently no market price. In the majority of cases each 
of these things is grown because the farmer has need of them 
in the production of the article or articles of food towards 
which his management is directed. If he could buy them 
more cheaply than he can grow them he would surely do so, 
but to regard himself as a merchant instead of as a manu- 
facturer, and then to trade with one department of his farm 
against another is to involve himself in paper transactions 
which have no foundation in fact, and which may lead to 
disastrous conclusions. Some years ago a well-known firm 
of manure manufacturers found themselves handicapped in 
the production of superphosphate by the high price of 
sulphuric acid. To meet this they decided to put down 
a sulphuric acid plant, and found that the cost of their 
‘super’ was immediately redueed. Had they followed the 
principle of valuing the acid at its market value their super- 
phosphate would still have appeared to be an unproductive 
line, and the only conclusion to be drawn from their books 
would have been that they should give up manure manu- 
facturing and concentrate their efforts on the production of 
acid. The same argument holds good in the case, so often 
quoted, of the price of hay and the cost of milk. It may 
well be that in consequence of a temporary or of a local 
demand it will pay a farmer better to sell hay rather than 
to produce milk, and one of the main functions of book- 
keeping is to enable him to make a decision on such points 
as this. But he cannot expect to have it both ways; if he 
sells hay he cannot produce milk, and vice versa. Many 
farmers contract at summer prices for their winter’s supply 
of feeding-stuffs, but a man who has bought linseed cake at 
a pound per ton less than the market priceat the time when he 
is consuming it would hardly think of charging it to bullocks 
at any other price than that which he actually paid, and it 
is this figure, the actual cost to him, which must be the 
measure of the value of all intermediate products, whether 
 
-P-A-G-E-38
  38 QUESTIONS OF PRINCIPLE 
they be bought in the market, or whether, for the sake of 
convenience and economy, they be grown on the farm. 
The mistake of valuing crops consumed on the farm at their 
supposed market value instead of at cost price isso generally 
made ' as to call for the fullest discussion and consideration 
by those engaged in cost determinations. It arises partly, 
no doubt, from a want of clear thinking on the subject of 
what is the cost of an article, but mainly from the lack of 
records on the farm. In the absence of information as to 
what he has paid for his hay or for his roots in the process 
of production the farmer turns once again to the market in 
order to fix their value, and the market price of hay at the 
present time, when a crop costing probably some 50s. per 
ton to produce will sell readily for £5, is an indication of the 
magnitude of the error which this system of valuation may 
introduce. 
A difficulty which presents itself in this connexion is that 
of how to value the parts of a crop produced simultaneously 
by the same expenditure of capital and labour, but used 
separately. For example, how is the cost of a wheat crop 
to be divided between the grain and the straw? At the 
Institute the practice has been to base this division upon 
a comparison of the market values of the two products, the 
justification for this course being that in a prairie country, 
where the straw is usually burnt, as being worthless, the 
whole cost of the crop will be borne by the corn, and if it be 
possible to find a locality, or a crop (flax is sometimes a case 
in point) where the straw alone is utilized, the total cost 
would be chargeable against the straw. Between these 
extremes the cost is shared between the two commodities 
according to their relative market values. The objection to 
this principle lies in the fact that one of the components 
may have no real market value, and the division of cost 
would then have an unsubstantial basis. This is certainly 
1 See, for example, G. F. Warren in Farm Management, p. 55, where he 
refers to the ‘absurd practice of some institutions of charging feed to animals 
at the cost of producing it rather than what it can be sold for, less the cost 
of marketing’.
-P-A-G-E-39
QUESTIONS OF PRINCIPLE 39 
likely to be the case with barley and barley straw, as there 
is no market in the latter. Perhaps a more reliable division 
could be found, based on a comparison of the food values of 
the two parts of the crop. In the illustration given in 
Table XXXVI, where a total crop-cost of £5 6s. 10d. per acre 
was incurred on the Hast Midland farm to produce 3-9 quarters 
of barley and 15 ecwt. of barley straw, a division has been 
made on the basis of a market value of £2 per quarter for 
barley and £1 per ton for the straw. This brings the cost 
of growing the barley to £1 4s. 6d. per quarter, and of the 
straw to 14s. 5d. per ton. Ifthe comparison were to be made 
on the basis of feeding value, calculated by the starch 
equivalent method of Kellner, the cost of the corn would be 
about 18s. per quarter and of the straw about 47s. per ton, 
regarding the former as a production food, and the latter as 
a maintenance food, or about 21s. per quarter and 28s. per ton 
if both are regarded as production foods. These divergences 
suggest an urgent need for further consideration on the part 
of those engaged in cost investigation. 
The Cost of Horse Labour. Where the farm horses are 
regarded solely as a source of motive power no difficulties in 
principle are involved. The animals are valued at their cost 
price, whether bred or bought, and the difference in this 
figure, year by year, added to or subtracted from the expense 
of feeding or otherwise maintaining the horses, represents 
the cost of their work for the year. No special calculation or 
estimate of depreciation has to be made, as the breeding or 
buying-in of the young horses and the death or sale of the 
old ones supplies automatically the exact measure of this 
item, by difference, in the account. The case is otherwise, 
however, where the farmer is in business as a breeder of 
horses for sale, or as a dealer. These are businesses quite 
distinct from the performance of horse labour, and special 
provision is necessary to prevent the partial obscuration of 
the actual cost of horse labour. This is made by having two 
accounts for horses, a ‘Stock’ account and a ‘ Working’ 
account. The stock account is simply a debtor and creditor 
account of horses on hand, bred, bought and sold, together
-P-A-G-E-40
  40 QUESTIONS OF PRINCIPLE 
with the cost of feeding and maintaining brood mares and 
young stock not at work on the farm. The balance repre- 
sents the farmer’s profit or loss on his year’s breeding or 
dealing. The working account is composed solely of the 
cost of maintaining those horses which are worked on the 
farm. Maintenance includes food, shoeing, &c., and also 
acharge for depreciation debited to this account, and credited 
to the stock account for the use, so to speak, of the working 
horses. Even though the horses be all of them young ones, 
appreciating in value instead of depreciating, this charge 
must be made, otherwise the profit due to the farmer for his 
skill in the management of his horse stock will not appear 
as such, but will go fictitiously to reduce the cost of the 
horse work. Obviously the cost of ploughing an acre should 
be the same whether performed by young horses or old ones, 
other things being equal. The actual amount to be charged 
for depreciation depends upon the cost of the horse stock 
and their effective life duration. For example, the deprecia- 
tion of horses costing £40 at the date of coming into use on 
the farm, with an estimated effective life of twenty years, is 
£2 per annum. 
Manurial and Food Residues. In calculating the value 
of these items the basis, once again, must be the cost. The 
principle is to take the initial food cost, and to depreciate it 
according to the methods laid down, in the first place, by 
Lawes and Gilbert, and revised, subsequently, on two occa- 
sions, by Voelcker and Hall. The fact that the conditions 
of making and storing farmyard manure, and that the 
influence of atmospheric and soil conditions upon the effect 
and duration of it and of artificial manures may produce 
wide differences in their action is inevitable, but no better 
method has been devised. It may be noted that whereas in 
an outgoing valuation the valuer for the landlord (or 
incomer) may justifiably claim to substitute the price at 
which the manures or foods could have been purchased for 
that at which they were actually bought, and this, indeed, 
is commonly done, the farmer keeping records of his 
transactions must not depart from his own experience, but
-P-A-G-E-41
QUESTIONS OF PRINCIPLE 41 
must start from the actual cost to him of the materials 
concerned, however disadvantageously they may have been 
acquired, 
The distribution of the cost of cleaning land. The fact 
that the effect of certain manures endures beyond the 
removal of the crop to which they have been applied has 
long received recognition, not only in theory but also in 
practice, for it is the custom of agricultural valuers to allow 
two years before the residues from purchased foods are held 
to be exhausted, whilst to certain manures an even longer 
duration of effect is allowed. In the same way the duration 
of other improvements beyond the year in which they are 
effected is recognized. These matters afford a precedent for 
an attempt to distribute the cost of cleaning the land as 
performed at the time of fallowing, or before and during 
the growth of the root crop, over all the crops which inter- 
vene until this operation falls due to be done again. The 
simplest case is that of the bare fallow. The land has grown 
a rotation of crops, ending with a corn crop, and it is too 
dirty to be cropped again until it has been fallowed. 
‘Whether this be cheap or costly will depend very largely 
upon the season, but wet or fine there will be a considerable 
expenditure of labour and a year’s rent and rates from 
which the farmer will reap no return in the form of a crop. 
It is not unusual to put all this outlay to the charge of the 
following wheat crop, and the cost of ‘wheat after bare 
fallow’ may amount to a very large figure in an outgoing 
valuation. Asa matter of fact it is not justifiable to look 
upon the fallowing expenses as the cost of work necessary 
to grow the wheat crop alone, for all the crops in the rota- 
tion will benefit by it, and a division of the total cost must 
be made between all the crops accordingly. The same case 
arises when fallow crops replace the bare fallow in the 
system of management, with the difference that here a dis- 
tinction must be drawn between work done as necessary to 
secure the crop, and that which is performed only to clean 
the land. 
In either case a certain figure is found which represents
-P-A-G-E-42
42 QUESTIONS OF PRINCIPLE 
the cost of cleaning the land for the next succession of crops. 
As to the division of the cost between them, only an arbitrary 
basis has been found possible hitherto. The charge may be 
divided equally between the crops, that is to say, in a four- 
course rotation 75 per cent. of the cleaning cost would be 
carried forward from the first crop, 50 per cent. from the 
second, 25 per cent. from the third, and nothing from the 
fourth. But it may be argued that the first crop will 
derive a much larger benefit from the cleaning operations 
than the subsequent ones, and the basis of distribution 
adopted at the Institute, and employed in the illustrations 
of farming costs appended, is that of charging 50 per cent. 
of the total cleaning cost to the first crop, 50 per cent. of the 
remainder (i.e. 25 per cent. of the total) to the second crop, 
and to divide the residue equally between the last two crops 
(i.e. 12% per cent. each). By experiment upon the farm it 
would be a fairly simple matter to determine the actual 
respective shares of each crop in the rotation in the cleaning 
benefit ; in the absence of this information the second of 
the above proposals may possibly be regarded as the best 
division that can be effected. 
It may be pointed out that the necessity for apportioning 
the cost of this work is quite independent of its actual 
advantage to the land. After a wet and difficult season, 
which leaves the land almost as dirty as it was at the 
beginning, a tenant-right valuer may well contend that 
nothing is due to an outgoing tenant under this head, on 
the ground that no benefit to the incomer has accrued from 
the work. But this argument does not concern the farmer 
who is farming by his books and to whom a knowledge of 
costs is essential; once more it is the cost incurred that he 
must know, and the value, or otherwise, of the work will be 
revealed when he comes to market the crops, a part of the 
charge of which is represented by the expenditure upon the 
attempt to clean the land which grew them. 
In connexion with the root crop it is a question whether 
rent and rates ought not to be included with the unexhausted 
cleaning costs, and carried forward for distribution over the
-P-A-G-E-43
  QUESTIONS OF PRINCIPLE 43 
rotation. This, of course, is what is done where land is 
bare-fallowed ; and having regard to the nature of the root 
crop, that is to say, that it is a crop introduced, in the main, 
to make the bare fallow less of a dead loss, it might be 
proper to relieve it of this charge, or anyhow of some part of 
it. This is one of the many questions calling for considera- 
tion by those engaged in this work. In the meantime the 
practice at the Institute is to include rent and rates in the 
cost of the roots. 
The distribution of On-cost and Establishment Charges. 
No matter how carefully the analysis and distribution of 
expenses may be effected, there will always be certain items 
which cannot be apportioned or assigned directly to any 
account. Such matters as the foreman’s or bailiff’s wages, 
repair of roads, &c.; keep of the farmer’s nag-horses or 
motor, these and similar things are part of the cost of pro- 
duction, but they cannot be allocated at the time of payment 
to any department or departments. At one time it was not 
customary, in industry, to take account of these things in cost 
determinations, but they were carried to the debit of the 
profit and loss account. It is now almost universally 
recognized that, although this method had simplicity in its 
favour, ‘an efficient check upon the indirect expenses can 
only be obtained by establishing a relation between the 
direct and indirect expenses’,! and the indirect expenses 
are collected into an account the balance of which is dis- 
tributed over the accounts of the productive branches of the 
enterprise. The basis of the distribution is various. In 
some concerns this balance is divided in proportion to the 
amount expended on labour, or on the materials ; in others, 
in proportion to the labour and materials; in others, again, 
where the quality of the labour may vary very much in 
different branches, and with it the amount paid in wages, 
the time during which the labour is employed is adopted as 
the basis rather than the amount of wages. In farming the 
fluctuations in the quality of labour or in materials used in   
      
1 Garcke and Fells, op. cit., p. 89.  
-P-A-G-E-44
    44 QUESTIONS OF PRINCIPLE 
the departments of the farm is very slight, and the principle 
of distribution of general expenses adopted in the examples 
given later in this Report is that of a percentage on the 
labour and materials, the assumption being that the depart- 
ment which has had the greatest expenditure in it of labour 
and materials has benefited to the greatest extent by the 
general expenditure. 
On the farm Establishment expenses as distinguished 
from On-cost are very few. Clerical assistance employed is 
usually né, and not infrequently there is scarcely any 
other item of any magnitude. Messrs. Garcke and Fells 
point out that whereas establishment expenses are most 
certainly elements in the cost of production, yet in industry 
they are more properly left out of calculations of cost price. 
‘A large increase in the value of orders received would not 
necessitate a like augmentation of the office staff, nor would 
a sudden and serious falling-off in trade enable a firm to 
effect an immediate or proportionate reduction of general 
expenditure.’! In agriculture, however, there is not this 
dependence upon orders, and the fluctuations in manu- 
facturing costs due to the changes in the cost of labour and 
the prices of materials are also very little felt in normal 
times. Thus, there is not the objection to the inclusion of 
establishment charges in the cost price of the farm products 
which arises in the factory, and on-cost and general estab- 
lishment expenses may well be included in one account in 
the books, and distributed together over the productive 
branches of the farm. Only the productive accounts are 
concerned in this apportionment, because the balances of 
all other accounts are themselves distributed in due 
course.

CHAPTER IV 
ANALYSIS OF RECORDS OF FARMING COSTS 
IN 1915 
Ssortty after the establishment of the Institute at Oxford, 
a public offer was made by the Director, on the occasion of 
a meeting of the London Farmers’ Club, to furnish a set of 
cost accounts to any member who would supply certain 
records of income and expenditure on his farm throughout 
the year. The obligation was to be a mutual one; farmers 
were to receive a full statement of the cost of producing the 
various articles constituting their output, together with 
a profit and loss account of their whole enterprise, and the 
Institute was to be allowed to use the information gained 
for statistical purposes. A guarantee that the farmer’s con- 
fidence would be respected was to be given in every case, 
and no information of a personal nature was to be utilized 
in such a manner as would be likely to lead to the identifica- 
tion of the individual supplying it. This invitation to 
farmers to co-operate with the Institute was advertised 
throughout the country by the agricultural and local press, 
but there was practically no response. Accordingly, it was 
decided to call upon selected farmers with a view to 
interesting them in the scheme, and, in the result, a sufficient 
number were quickly met with to keep the small staff of the 
Institute very fully occupied in the work of analysing the 
records kept by them. Unfortunately it was impossible to 
arrange for any help or supervision to be given to the 
farmers in the early stages of the work, and this operated 
against the compilation of results in two ways. In the first 
place, it meant that errors and omissions in the returns 
 
-P-A-G-E-46
EO Re ee ee NET ee Ne TT ee RC ORE ENE ree er Te mere 
46 ANALYSIS OF RECORDS 
sometimes went undetected until too late to rectify or to 
supply them; in the second place, it was impossible to 
apply the stimulus necessary, in certain cases, to carry a man 
through twelve months of record-keeping before tangible 
proofs could be given of the value to him of the work. 
Thus, in the one case, a first year’s results have sometimes 
proved too unreliable to have any value for the purposes in 
view, whilst, in the other case, nearly twelve months of 
arduous work at the Institute have been completely wasted 
because the farmer has allowed the work at his end to lapse 
before the completion of the agricultural year. In common 
with other research stations the Institute has found its 
difficulties augmented in no small degree by the Great War, 
for not only has the staff been much disorganized by the 
removal for active service of members familiar with the 
work, but others have had to be found and trained. The 
labour difficulty on farms, together with the departure, in 
certain cases, of sons and pupils by whom the work of record- 
keeping was largely performed, has closed several accounts 
which promised to be of interest and value, and the many 
months of work spent on them has been consequently to 
a large extent wasted. One farmer, who displayed the 
greatest interest in the work, and whose records were 
probably among the most reliable of those received at the 
Institute, has himself made the great sacrifice. The fact 
that new collaborators among farmers have been found 
does not entirely meet the difficulty, because the value 
of the results is largely dependent on the continuity of the 
records. 
Thus it will be seen that the difficulty, which had been 
fully anticipated, of obtaining the collaboration of farmers 
in work so uncongenial and so little appreciated as book- 
keeping, has been supplemented in no small degree in 
a manner quite unexpected. But, at the same time, the 
experience derived makes it abundantly clear that, given 
sufficient assistance to allow the work of analysing the 
farmers’ records to be carried out accurately and at speed, 
whilst providing also for a certain amount of overlooking  
-P-A-G-E-47
  OF FARMING COSTS IN 1915 47 
by the Institute of the work at the farmer’s end, interest in 
the investigation of the cost of production could be exten- 
sively developed, and valuable results on a large scale might 
be obtained. 
A. Description oF THE Farms 
Records were received during 1915 from twenty farms in 
England and Scotland. To get the best results from this 
work on the cost of production it would be desirable to 
select typical farming districts and to obtain the collabora- 
tion of, say, some half-dozen farmers in each, occupying 
fairly representative holdings. This should lead to the 
compilation of reliable averages, and it would be possible to 
speak with considerable confidence as to the farming costs 
in any district in any year, and many valuable comparisons 
could be made, both between district and district, and 
between farm and farm. This was the intention at the out- 
set of the work, but it was found to be impossible of realiza- 
tion at the time. In the first place, the resources of the 
Institute would not admit of an attempt to deal with more 
than two or three districts; in the second, an insufficient 
number of representative farmers were forthcoming in each 
of those districts in which their collaboration was sought. 
Thus it happened that help was sought here and there 
where it was likely to be obtained, regardless of the district. 
There is no reason to suppose that this state of affairs must 
necessarily continue; the value of all work is best judged 
by the results, and in the absence of any examples of the 
utility of the proposals made to the farmers it is not 
altogether surprising if many of those to whose notice they 
were brought did not immediately grasp their purport and 
advantage. 
As to the farms on which the work was done, as recorded 
in this Report, all of them are in the occupation of men 
farming for their living, or as an investment; pleasure 
farms have been rigorously excluded. They lie scattered 
 
-P-A-G-E-48
  48 ANALYSIS OF RECORDS 
widely over the country, but it is possible, nevertheless, to 
group them roughly together for purposes of comparison. 
Dairying Farms 
Midlands No.1. This holding is rather more than one- 
half in grass. The arable land is managed on a five-course 
system, slightly upset by the growing of a good many 
potatoes in recent years. The root-land is cropped mostly 
to supply cow-keep, the only live stock, except for a small 
flying-flock of ewes, being a large dairy herd milked for 
a neighbouring industrial town. 
Midlands No. 2. This is a typical suburban farm, lying 
on the outskirts of a large manufacturing town. The soil is 
light and hungry, and the holding is more or less evenly 
divided between grass and arable land. A fair quantity of 
potatoes are grown, but otherwise the farm may be said to 
be managed entirely for the production of milk. Labour 
costs are very high, in fact, men are only to be got in direct 
competition with industry, and all those not employed on 
piece-work are paid by the hour. The splendid market 
compensates for these adverse conditions, however, and the 
highly paid labour appears to be very efficient. 
South Midlands No. 1. This is a large farm where equip- 
ment and management have been carried to a high degree 
of excellence. The soil varies, including almost every type, 
and calling for varied styles of management. A very fine 
herd of dairy shorthorns is the most important feature 
amongst the live stock, but on the lighter soils sheep-farming 
is carried on. Up to the present, figures for the earnings of 
the farm labourers of all grades are the only statistics avail- 
able from this holding, but so soon as the work of keeping 
the necessary records is better understood and practised, it 
should furnish most valuable data for almost every branch 
of farming in this locality. 
South Midlands No. 2 is a light-land farm situated in an 
arable district, and consisting of arable and grass land in 
almost equal proportions. Milk is sent to London, and 
milk, sheep, and barley are the principal objects of the
-P-A-G-E-49
OF FARMING COSTS IN 1915 49 
management. Labour is normally plentiful and low-paid, 
and the cost of milk-production on this farm makes an 
interesting comparison with that on the Midlands No. 2 
farm, described above, where all the conditions are dis- 
similar. 
South-Eastern No. 1. A small farm of the suburban type 
given up to milk-production for a local residential town. 
Owing to the death of the tenant, in action, the records 
ceased before reaching the stage at which they should have 
afforded reliable information, except as regards the earnings 
of labour. 
South of Scotland No. 1. This farm may be included 
among the dairy holdings, its principal product being 
cheese; it is about one-third arable and two-thirds grass. 
The soils vary from a brashy loam to clay, and they are 
rather difficult to work. The manufacture of cheese makes 
pig-keeping on a fairly extensive scale possible, and sheep 
are also kept. 
South of Scotland No. 2. A fairly large mixed dairy, 
arable, and stock farm. The soil is generally a useful loam, 
becoming rather stony in parts and frequently near the rock. 
The principal form of produce is cheese, for which the place 
is noted. Enough is ploughed to keep a large herd of cows 
in straw, hay, and roots, while young cattle and sheep are 
kept. The greater part of the farm is under grass and on 
this basic slag is generously used. 
South of Scotland No. 3. This is a dairy, arable, and 
stock farm. The soil is a mixed loam, varying from what 
is almost clay to a light gravelly loam. Milk is the dairy 
produce, a large herd of cows being kept. A number of 
bullocks and sheep are fattened, horses are bred, and a con- 
siderable quantity of oats is sold. 
West of Scotland No. 1. A mixed dairy, arable, and 
pasture farm. The soil varies a good deal, running from 
gravelly loam to clay. Most of the land is sheep land. 
Heifers are reared for sale as well as for making up the milk 
herd, and most of the cropping is carried out to provide the 
cows and young stock with winter food.

-P-A-G-E-50
50 ANALYSIS OF RECORDS 
Corn and Meat Farms 
Eastern Counties No. 1. This is a large holding, about 
five-eighths arable and three-eighths grass, which is mainly 
a corn and stock-raising farm. After one year’s labour 
figures had been recorded the work unfortunately had to be 
stopped, on account of clerical difficulties arising out of the 
war, and no results, except such as relate to the earnings of 
farm workers, could be produced. 
Eastern Counties No. 2. Is a farm almost entirely arable 
land. The soil generally may be described as a light, sandy 
loam, varying slightly from field to field from light sand to 
loam. The small area of grass land is situated mostly on 
chalky boulder clay. The main feature of the management 
is corn-growing, the corn being largely sold for seed in the 
neighbourhood. A four-course rotation is followed, or some- 
times a five-course, a barley crop following the wheat as the 
last crop in the rotation. All the mangolds and half the 
swedes are fed to fattening bullocks, the remainder of 
the swedes being consumed on the land by sheep. For profit 
the management looks to the corn crop, the live stock being 
regarded more as manure-making machines. 
East Midlands Nos. 1 and 2. These two farms lie close 
together and are under the same control. They are about 
one-third grass and two-thirds arable. The soil is for the 
most part light, and easily worked, and the four-course 
rotation is practised. Corn, especially barley, and stock- 
raising may be said to constitute the principal objects of the 
management, but a considerable dairy herd is maintained 
for the production of butter. There is no little resemblance 
between the conditions prevailing on these farms and on 
South Midlands No. 2, but the great distance from the rail- 
way of the East Midlands farms makes it impossible to 
develop the dairying side to the same extent. 
South-Eastern No. 2. Here is a fairly typical East Kent 
hop farm, one-third of the land being arable, of which one- 
third again is hops, this being the best portion of the farm. 
Except for the hop-land, the arable is mostly thin, lying     
   
-P-A-G-E-51
OF FARMING COSTS IN 1915 51 
quite close to the chalk, and it is cropped on a five-course 
rotation, oats following barley, and seeds being sown in the 
oats. Of the grass-land, less than one-half is good old 
pasture, the remainder being down-land. As is often the 
case with a hop farm, the hops get most of the manure, and 
‘have to stand god-father to everything else’. The upland 
grass is grazed entirely with sheep, and cattle-raising for 
beef-production completes the scheme of management. Good 
hops, good barley, and good beef may be taken asa summary 
of the output of this holding. 
South-Eastern No. 3. A mixed farm in a district some- 
what remote, consisting of one-third arable and two-thirds 
grass. The soil varies from a light chalky loam to a fairly 
heavy clay loam. About half the grass is rough down-land, 
but most of the remainder is good pasture. The manage- 
ment is chiefly directed towards the production of corn and 
mutton, a registered flock being kept and all lambs wintered. 
Some data for the cost of performing farm operations by an 
agricultural motor tractor have been obtained from this 
holding. 
Miscellaneous Farms 
West of Scotland No. 2. Is a farm almost entirely arable. 
The principal crop is early potatoes, and after they have 
been lifted the land is put under catch crops on which sheep 
are fed. The soil is a sandy loam, and a large amount of 
manure, both farmyard and artificial, is used. Labour is 
well-paid and efficient. 
West of Scotland No. 3. A mixed arable and dairy farm 
of medium size, one-quarter of the area being in permanent 
pasture. The soil varies from a good loam to clay, and the 
loam is very intensively cropped, large quantities of farm- 
yard and artificial manures being applied. Wheat, oats, hay, 
and potatoes are part of the output, and there is also a trade 
in several kinds of green crops. There is a large herd of 
cows, the milk from which is sold, while sheep are fed off on 
catch crops. 
 
-P-A-G-E-52
       
    52 ANALYSIS OF RECORDS 
West of Scotland No. 4. A mixed arable, dairy, poultry, 
and sheep farm, the arable itself constituting a fairly large 
holding, while the rough pasture extends over a wide area. 
Most of the arable is sheep land, and the soil is a variable 
loam, being of an intractable, stony nature in some parts and 
bordering on clay in others. The produce sold includes 
milk, poultry and eggs, potatoes, hay, and sheep, and in 
most departments the farming would be regarded as active, 
a good deal being ventured in the application of manures. 
South-Eastern No. 4. This is mainly a hop and fruit 
farm, which has been used for the collection of certain 
labour costs. 
South Midlands No. 3. A small poultry farm, run as 
a half-time enterprise. The results will be found in the 
report, illustrating the labour income derived by the tenant 
from the holding. 
South Midlands No. 4. Another small holding run as 
a part-time enterprise by a railway porter, with the aid of 
his wife and family. The principal products are pigs and 
poultry. 
South Midlands No. 5. This is a farm on heavy land, 
managed mainly for dairying and corn. Changes in the 
management have made it impossible hitherto to collect 
any reliable information from it other than the earnings of 
labour. 
Northern No. 1. This is also a small holding, the princi- 
pal output of which is milk and eggs, and the tenant also 
contracts for horse labour. On small holdings anything in 
the nature of cost-accounting is difficult unless the bulk of 
the recording can be done for the farmers. This has not 
been possible here, but the figures available are of interest 
as showing the ‘labour income’ of the tenant, and it is 
a matter for regret that more results of this kind are not, at 
present, available so as to throw light upon the economic 
strength of the small-holder’s position both as regards pro- 
duction of food and remuneration of labour.

OF FARMING COSTS IN 1915 53 
B. Farm Lasour 
1, Manual Labour 
The figures for the earnings of farm workers given in 
Tables VI and VII relate to the years 1913-14 and 1914-15. 
To explain all the differences in the rates of the cash wages 
and earnings of farm labour a small treatise on the different 
systems of engaging and paying labour in the various 
counties would be necessary. For instance, on the farms 
Midlands No. 1, and East Midlands Nos. 1 and 2, some of 
the horsemen are boarded, either with the farm foreman or 
with some other employee, and a considerable part of the 
wage is paid in the form of allowances of bacon and potatoes 
to the person providing the board, while in South Midlands 
No. 2 no such system is met with, and allowances in kind 
are both small and infrequent. Some men in all classes are 
given cash bonuses, either at Michaelmas or at some other 
period of the year, or for the harvest month, while others 
earn extra by piece-work. These bonuses and piece-work 
earnings in some cases make considerable additions to the 
total annual earnings. They are, on the whole, much more 
important than allowances in kind, for the latter are generally 
of small value, except in the form of cottages, or the board 
of single labourers engaged for half-yearly or yearly periods ; 
for married labourers in England they usually amount, 
where given, to 2s. or 2s, 6d. a week, and this often includes 
or is equal to the rent of the cottage. In some counties, as 
in the South-Eastern and South Midlands farms, it will be 
noticed that allowances in kind are only rarely given to 
ordinary labourers, and then piece-work becomes of great 
importance in the earnings of employees of that class. 
Ordinary Labourers. For this class the lowest nominal 
rate of cash wages for men providing their own board in 
1913 was 13s. in East Midlands Nos. 1 and 2, and the highest 
reached was £1 4s. in West of Scotland No. 3. The figures 
for the following year, 1914, include those for a farm in one of 
the very low wage counties, and the lowest rate was reached 
in South Midlands No. 2 at 12s. 6d., the highest being in
-P-A-G-E-54
  54 ANALYSIS OF RECORDS 
South-Eastern No. 3 at £10s. 8d. Including both men who 
board themselves and those boarded, the lowest rate of 
nominal weekly earnings for the former year amounted to 
12s. 6d., which was given in Scotland, an Eastern county 
coming second with 18s. 6d. In the latter year the lowest 
rate, amounting to 12s. 7d., was paid in the South Midlands. 
The highest rate in 1913, amounting to £1 7s. 6d., was paid 
in the West of Scotland; the highest rate for an English 
county, amounting to £1 4s. 5d., was paid in the East 
Midlands. In the following year the highest rate paid in 
England was £1 2s. 1d. on Midlands No.1; and in the 
West of Scotland £1 2s. 
However, total annual earnings may vary from the total 
of the nominal weekly rate, the amount of the variation 
depending upon piece-work and extras or bonuses, and upon 
the loss of time by absence from work. Piece-work is of 
the greatest importance in the South-Eastern counties and 
the South Midlands, and extras or bonuses in the East 
Midlands. Almost invariably some men lose time and 
money by absence from work. This is partly due to illness, 
but also to the fact that farm hands are usually supposed to 
work fifty-two weeks in the year and from six to seven days 
per week. Consequently if anything in the nature of 
a holiday is required, or if a man wants to work on an 
allotment, time may have to be lost. It is noticeable that 
on one Scottish farm, on which the custom of the Saturday 
half-holiday is established, much less than the average loss 
of time in the regular hours of employment occurs amongst 
ordinary labourers. In most cases actual yearly earnings 
exceed the total of nominal earnings, but in a few instances 
loss by absence is sufficient to reduce actual earnings slightly 
below the nominal rate. Where loss of earnings by absence 
exceeds 10 per cent., it is usually the case that the employ- 
ment is recognized as of casual character by both employer 
and employed, the latter having some other form of employ- 
ment at other times of the year. This is especially notice- 
able in regard to the figures from the South-Eastern 
counties. :

  OF FARMING COSTS IN 1915 55 
But, taking the average for the counties, actual earnings 
generally exceed the nominal rate by an amount representing 
from 2to10percent. In all cases in which the employment 
is deemed to be regular, the widest difference between actual 
and nominal earnings in 1913-15 was between plus 16:9 per 
cent., and minus 20-8 per cent. 
The rise in wages of farm labourers since 1907 has received 
a good deal of attention, but from the figures compiled it 
appears that the ordinary labourers have not shared in the 
increase to the same extent as other classes. Taking the 
official figures of 1907 ! as a basis for comparison, the highest 
increase recorded where a number of men are affected 
amounts to 3s. per week. Up tothe middle of 1915 earnings 
on the South Midlands farms had risen only by 2s. 4d. over 
the level of 1907. In the case of both horsemen and cattle- 
men the increase has been greater. (See Tables VI and VII.) 
Horsemen. This class of farm worker is usually employed 
six days per week, with the additional duty of attending 
horses on Sundays during the winter, or at such other times 
as they may be in the stable. But on one Scottish farm the 
Saturday half-holiday is established as in the case of the 
ordinary labourers. In 1913-14 the highest and lowest rates 
of nominal earnings were respectively £1 6s. 6d. and 15s. 6d. ; 
the highest and lowest rates of actual earnings being £1 6s. 6d. 
and 16s. 7d. In the later year the highest and lowest rates 
of nominal earnings were respectively £1 6s. 14d. and 12s. 1d.; 
the highest and lowest rates of actual earnings amounting to 
£1 7s. 8d. and 13s. 5d. per week. Except when boarded 
or lodged English horsemen do not usually receive any 
great proportion of their wages in kind. The usual value 
ranges between 2s. and 2s. 6d. per week. In the case of 
Scottish horsemen allowances are of greater importance. 
Where men find their own board, extras or bonuses in the 
form of ‘Michaelmas money’, and piece-work are more 
important than allowances in kind in the total of earnings. 
On the whole, horsemen lose less money by absence ftom 
work than ordinary labourers. Actual earnings fall below 
1 Cd. 5460. 1910. 
 
-P-A-G-E-58
56 ANALYSIS OF RECORDS 
nominal rates in only a very few cases; and taking the 
average for counties, where a number of men are concerned, 
the actual earnings for the year exceed the total of the 
nominal rate by an amount varying from 3-7 per cent. to 
14-7 per cent. In 1913-14 the actual earnings did not always 
exceed the nominal rate, nor, on the other hand, did they 
fall below the nominal rate in any one case. The greatest 
difference recorded was an increase of 17-8 per cent. in the 
case of one man on the Eastern Counties Farm No.1. In 
the later year actual earnings fell below the nominal rate 
in a few instances, in one case to 9-6 per cent.; generally, 
however, actual earnings exceeded nominal rates, the excess 
in one case amounting to 19-6 per cent. 
The increase in the earnings of Scottish horsemen since 
1907 is much more noticeable than in the case of English 
horsemen. Where the earnings of a number of men are 
recorded, the greatest difference between actual earnings 
in 1913-14 and the official figures for 1907 amounts to 
4s, 7d. per week on a Lanarkshire farm. This is of -more 
importance because on this farm the nominal week is 
only 54 days, with the addition of attendance on Sundays. 
On English farms employing a number of horsemen, the 
highest increase recorded is 3s. 54d. per week, but in one 
case the increase from the county average for horsemen in 
1907 has amounted to over 7s. (See Tables VITI and IX.) 
Cattlemen. Inthe majority of cases cattlemen work seven 
days a week, or six days with Sunday duties in addition. 
And except where some part or the whole of the board is 
provided, as sometimes in the East Midlands, the earnings 
of the English cattlemen depend mainly upon the nominal 
rates and extras or bonuses. Allowances in kind are not 
general amongst the English cattlemen whose earnings are 
recorded; but they are rather more frequent, and of greater 
importance, in the earnings of the Scottish cattlemen. 
Except in two individual cases, piece-work, or work at special 
rates, is not an important item. 
The highest and lowest rates of nominal earnings in 
1913-14 were, respectively, £1 10s. and 18s 4d. per week ; the

OF FARMING COSTS IN 1915 57 
highest and lowest rates of actual earnings were £1 10s. and 
15s. 44d. per week. As in the case of horsemen it is notice- 
able that at the highest rates nominal and actual earnings 
are equal.!' In the later year the highest and lowest rates 
of nominal earnings were respectively £1 10s. and 18s. 11d. ; 
and the highest and lowest rates of actual earnings £1 12s. 3d. 
and 18s. 9d. In spite of the fact that cattlemen work from 
six to seven days a week, the loss of earnings by absence from 
work is surprisingly small. In many cases there is none 
at all, and the highest loss is not so large as in the case 
of the ordinary labourers. But in every class the loss of 
earnings by absence from work is most general in the 
county where general wages are low. Among cattlemen, 
actual earnings fall below the nominal rates in only two 
cases, and there is a greater tendency for actual earnings to 
equal nominal rates than amongst either ordinary labourers 
or horsemen. Where the earnings of a number of men are 
recorded, actual earnings exceed the nominal rate, and this 
is of greatest importance on South Midlands No. 1 farm. An 
examination of the separate tables shows that in 1913-14 
actual earnings are equal to the nominal rate in the majority 
of cases, and only in the Eastern and South-Eastern counties 
is there any important difference. In one case the excess 
of actual earnings over nominal rates amounts to 20 per cent. 
In the later year there is a difference in conditions due to 
a change in the counties represented, this being largely the 
result of the inclusion of some South Midlands figures. In 
this year most of the cattlemen earned more than the 
nominal rate. The highest excess was equal to an addition 
of 46 per cent. over the nominal rate, in the case of one man 
in the South Midlands, but this was due to the performance 
of a very large amount of work at special rates. 
Where the earnings of a number of men are recorded, 
they show an increase over the official figures for the county 
average for cattlemen in 1907 in every county except the 
Eastern one. In England, the smallest increase amounts to 
less than 1s. in Midlands No. 1, and the largest increase 
1 See Table X for 1918-14, West of Scotland, No. 3. 
2041 E

  58 ANALYSIS OF RECORDS 
amounts to over 9s., on the South Eastern farm No.1. This 
is only a small farm, and where the number of men whose 
earnings are recorded is greater the increase amounts to 
about 4s. 6d. as in the South Midlands. In Scotland there 
is a more notable difference recorded between average 
earnings in 1907 and current earnings. (See Tables X 
and XI.) 
Shepherds. This class of farm workers usually work 
six days a week in summer, with Sunday duties in addition, 
and seven days in winter if sheep are folded on arable land. 
Amongst the earnings recorded, piece-work is absent except 
in one instance, and actual earnings depend mainly on the 
nominal rate and on bonuses or extras. As with other 
classes of labour, there are instances of boarding in the East 
Midlands; and in several other cases allowances in kind are 
given, but these do not exceed the value of 2s. 6d. per week, 
and may in some instances include a cottage. 
The highest and lowest rates of nominal earnings were 
respectively £1 5s. 14d. and 15s. 2d.; the highest and lowest 
rates of actual earnings, £1 5s. 14d. and 15s. 4d. per week. 
Nearly all the men lost some earnings by absence from work, 
but only in one case did actual earnings fall below the 
nominal rate, and in the majority actual earnings exceeded 
the nominal. 
‘With the exception of one instance in the East Midlands, 
the rates of earnings recorded show little change from the 
official figures for average rates in the counties in1907. In 
two instances the rates are below those quoted for the earlier 
year, but in each case there was considerable loss of earnings 
by absence from work. (See Tables XII and XIII.) 
Foremen. The number of days per week on which farm 
foremen work depends on the character of their duties. If 
they are supervising the work among stock, attendance is 
generally necessary on seven days; but if they are merely 
supervising field labour they may not attend more than six 
days. And, as in the case of ordinary field labourers and 
horsemen, one of the Scottish foremen works for a nominal 
week of 54 days only. Earnings depend on nominal rates,

OF FARMING COSTS IN 1915 59 
allowances in kind, and bonuses or extras. Piece-work is 
important in one instance only, but allowances in kind are 
of greater value than those given to any other class of work- 
man, which may be due partly, in some cases, to the occu- 
pancy of a good cottage, or house, on the farm. The large 
bonus given in one instance is interesting, because it is 
designed to enable the foreman to accumulate capital in 
order to become a farmer. The average nominal earnings of 
farm foremen in England, as recorded, amount to about 
£1 7s. per week; and the average actual earnings to about 
£1 10s. In Scotland the figures are somewhat similar. The 
highest and lowest rates of nominal earnings are £2 1s. 3d. 
and 17s. 9d. respectively ; the highest and lowest rates of 
actual earnings being £2 5s. 5d. and 19s. 6d. per week. 
Wages vary with the nature of duties and the amount of 
responsibility, but the low scale of remuneration for the 
highest position attainable on the farm does not hold out 
much prospect to the worker. (See Tables XIV and XV.) 
Women and Boys. The earnings of women regularly em- 
ployed, as recorded here, are limited to Scottish farms. 
Nominal and actual earnings on these farms vary between 
18s. 9d. and £1 4s. 4d. per week. In some cases actual 
earnings fall below nominal rates, but in no instance is there 
any excess. Women milkers who do not give their whole 
time to the work of the farm are paid at nominal rates 
varying from 3s. to 10s. 7d. per week; the highest and 
lowest rates of actual earnings are 10s. 2d. and 3s. respectively, 
None of these women in part-time employment receive 
allowances in kind, though some receive extras or bonuses. 
The earnings of boys obviously depend on the age and 
capacity of the individual, as to which detailed information 
cannot be given. Apart from this, earnings are determined 
by the nominal rates and the amount of extras, for both allow- 
ances in kind and piece-work are comparatively rare. There 
is some loss of earnings by absence from work, again notably 
in the South Midlands, but actual earnings usually exceed 
the normal rates. The highest and lowest rates of nominal 
earnings were in England 11s, 4d. and 2s. 6d., and in Scotland 
 
-P-A-G-E-68
  60 ANALYSIS OF RECORDS 
15s. 6d. and 8s. The highest and lowest rates of actual 
earnings were 13s. 4d. and 2s, 8d. in England, and 15s. 6d. 
and 7s. 4d. in Scotland. (See Tables XVI, XVII, XVIII, 
XIX, XX, and XXI.) 
Perhaps the most striking result of the collection of these 
records of the actual earnings of farm workers is that the 
increase since 1907 is shown to be but slight. The records 
extend to the end of the first year of the war, but on some 
farms they show rates only equal to, or sometimes below, the 
official figures for the county average of the different classes 
of labour in 1907. On the other hand the increases shown 
on some individual farms are comparatively large. It thus 
appears that the influences which determine the rates of 
wages for farm labour are to a large extent local in character. 
But, from the point of view of. the farm manager, the main 
question which arises is whether a larger or a smaller amount 
of intelligence and energy is purchased for a given sum 
where wages are comparatively low than where they are 
comparatively high. At present no definite answer can be 
supplied, though some evidence will be found later, in 
considering the cost of farm operations (see p. 67), but 
a continuation of the records should make a decision possible 
in the future. 
However, it may be that influences now at work will result 
in a considerable levelling up of the earnings of farm 
labourers in the various districts. Increase due to prevailing 
conditions did not occur on the farms for which earnings 
were recorded until early in 1915, and they were then more 
important in the areas in which rates are comparatively low. 
The cash wages of labourers earning 14s, a week or upwards, 
at the end of 1914, were increased by the following amounts 
during the first half of 1915 :— 
County. Amount of Increase per Week. 
Kent q ‘ ‘i : - 1s. to 28. 
Lincolnshire . : é - 1s. 6d. 
Oxfordshire . 5 5 - 1s. Boys 6d. 
Surrey . , . : - 1s. to 3s,

  ' FARMING COSTS IN 1915 63 
On Scottish farms no increases were given, and women’s 
wages were not increased. 
Some further study of the methods of paying and 
managing farm labour is necessary for the development of 
methods of farm management. One or two interesting 
points arise in connexion with these records, for instance, 
the comparatively large loss of earnings by absence from 
work where ordinary labourers are expected to work from 
six to seven days a week at comparatively low rates; and 
the comparatively small loss of time where the Saturday 
half-holiday is given and the rates are higher; also the 
reduction of the loss by absence as the rates of earnings rise 
according to the class of labour. The figures available are 
by no means conclusive, but they indicate. profitable lines 
of study. (See Tables XXII and XXIII.) 
2. Horse Labour 
a. Cost of a horse-day 
The cost of horse labour has been ascertained on five 
farms, and the variations are surprisingly small. The old 
allowance of half a crown a day has latterly given place in 
many estimates to three shillings, and these records go to 
show that there is not much reason to question the accuracy 
of this figure for general purposes. (See Table XXIV.) 
The manual labour represents time spent with the horses 
that cannot fairly be charged to any particular job. As 
already explained, the practice adopted is to charge the time 
of the horsemen to the work on which they are engaged, 
and not to the horses, and so manual labour on horses repre- 
sents visits to the forge, wet days spent in cleaning harness, 
&c. There is no doubt that in the case of the South Mid- 
lands farm a much stricter account has been kept of time so 
spent, which in others has largely gone to other accounts ; 
in the case of the larger Scottish farm, on the other hand, 
the whole matter has been disregarded and the men’s time 
has been charged entirely to directly productive work.

Taking the extreme cases, the difference in the whole cost 
due to this item amounts to no more than one penny 
per day. 
Coming to foods, which form by far the largest item of 
cost, it is of interest to note the effect of various systems 
of feeding on the cost of keep. Thus, in the East Midlands 
case, where maize and bran were largely bought, the cost is 
very materially above those where a greater proportion of 
home-grown corn was consumed. On the Scottish farms 
there were no previous records of the cost of the home- 
grown foods, and these were priced, therefore, by the farmers 
at market prices, as if all had been purchased ; the probable 
effect would be to inflate the total cost to some extent. The 
cost of grazing is arrived at, as explained later (see p. 91), 
by getting the total cost of the pastures—rent, rates, labour, 
manures, &c.—and apportioning it according to the amount 
of stock carried. 
It may not be out of place to refer to a criticism of the 
accuracy of calculations of horse labour costs based on the 
assumption that the cost of the foods consumed depends 
upon the cost of the labour, and vice versa. The question 
could only be raised by one who had had no experience of 
cost-accounting on the farm, for experience shows that it 
happens only rarely that the foods produced with the aid

of horse labour are consumed by the horses in the year of 
production. For example, oats produced during the 1914 
season will not be consumed, in most eases, until the horses 
are at work on the 1915 crop, and where this is not so the 
difficulty is at once removed by the simple expedient of 
altering the date of the opening of the financial year. The 
fact that in account-keeping, as in other things, a start must 
be made somewhere makes it necessary to assume a cost for 
the produce on the farm at the time of starting; and the 
first year’s figures for the cost of horse labour will be liable 
to error from this source. In subsequent years the difficulty 
disappears. 
‘Veterinary and Blacksmith’ does not call for comment, 
but as regards ‘ Depreciation’ it will be observed that this 
has been calculated at a fixed sum of £3 per horse. This is 
regardless of whether there has been any actual depreciation 
at all, or whether it has really been much higher from bad 
luck or from any other causes. The principle followed has 
been described already, and is that the depreciation on 
a horse, from his maximum value down to death, should be 
divided equally over his whole working life, for obviously 
the cost of ploughing an acre of land should be the same 
whether performed by young horses or old ones—other 
things being equal. The profit due to the farmer who works

  66 ANALYSIS OF RECORDS 
young horses appreciating in value must appear in another 
account, and must not be applied fictitiously to reduce the 
cost of horse-work on the farm.! Whether £3 per annum 
is the proper figure to represent depreciation calculated in 
this way depends on the class of horse stock on the farm. 
It was decided upon before the inflation of values due to 
the war, and represents a maximum cost of about £60 per 
horse. 
It is of interest to note the amount of time lost by horses 
on the farm. The greatest possible number of working 
days in the year is 313, which, of course, could never be 
reached, but it is obvious that every day spent unnecessarily 
in the stable adds to the cost of the days worked, and this 
constitutes a matter well worthy of close attention from the 
management. The labour-sheet printed on p. 20 is a useful 
check on the time lost by horses. By casting up the columns 
provided each day for the number of horses at work, the 
manager speedily gets to know the proportion borne by the 
number of days worked to the number of horses on the farm, 
and forms the habit of investigating discrepancies. In the 
examples given here it is possible—or even probable—that 
a certain number of days worked have been omitted from 
the labour record sheets; figures on the East Midlands 
farm have been kept for a longer period than on the 
remainder, and some, at least, of the extra days worked by 
the horses on it may be attributed to the greater accuracy 
in recording attained to with the longer experience. 
b. Cost of Cultivations 
A good deal of evidence has been extracted from the farm 
accounts and labour-sheets as to the cost of cultivations on 
the various holdings. On examination of the results it 
became apparent that in most cases the records were not 
sufficiently complete to admit of drawing useful conclusions. 
Thus, a record may appear in the labour-sheet showing that 
so many men and horses have been harrowing a certain

field, but there may be nothing to indicate whether the 
whole field were done, or whether it were done more than 
once, and the costs as worked out showed very clearly that 
in many cases there was a shortage of essential information. 
Once again, the need for further supervision of the work on 
the farms is indicated.1. The difficulty does not arise in 
connexion with ploughing, and some figures for the cost of 
ploughing two-horse land are given in the Table herewith. 
It will be noted that on a total of 416 acres less than one 
acre per day was ploughed. The figures may be compared 
with those given in Table XXVII for the cost of ploughing 
by an agricultural motor. (See Table XXYV.) 
3. Mechanical Power 
The consideration of the application of mechanical power 
to farming processes is a matter of growing importance. 
Not only does the increasing competition for labour make 
it necessary for the farmer to substitute labour-saving 
machinery for hand-power wherever possible, but the accom- 
panying rise in wages will compel him to adopt this means 
of making labour more productive if costs are to be kept 
down without a decline in the output from the land. In- 
deed, it seems likely that the solution of the labour problem 
will be found in the greater application of machinery to the 
processes of agricultural production, thus calling forth greater 
skill from the worker, and qualifying him for wages on 
a scale more compatible with the requirements of modern 
social existence. In Mr. T. H. Middleton’s book, The 
Recent Development of German Agriculture? it is shown 
that the production of food per hundred acres in Germany 
is much greater than in England; on the other hand, if the 
number of workers engaged in agriculture be brought into 
1 This lack of material does not affect the determination of the cost of 
crops ; so long as the correct number of men and horses working on a field 
has been recorded, it is immaterial for this purpose whether they have 
worked it once or more often,

  RECORDS OF FARMING COSTS IN 1915 69 
the account, it appears that the production per man is fully 
20 per cent. higher in this country. 
Now in England less than 16 per cent. of the land con- 
sists of holdings under fifty acres, whereas in Germany nearly 
one-half the total area (48-5 per cent.) is made up of these 
units of production, It seems fair to assume that the 
greater opportunity for the employment of horse labour 
and machinery afforded on the larger holdings of this 
country contributes to make the English labourer a more 
efficient workman than his German equivalent, and that 
any development which will increase still further the 
opportunities for using machinery will make the labourer’s 
toil still more productive, alike in wages for himself as in 
food for his country. The farmer, too, would be less 
dependent on the weather, for with the aid of steam or other 
mechanical power he could get his field-work done when 
the conditions were most favourable, working double shifts, 
if necessary, and even day and night. 
In Table XXVI is given the cost of various farm opera- 
tions performed in the year 1914-15 with the aid of an 
18-20 B. H. P. tractor costing £300. Petrol is used to start 
it, but as soon as the engine is warm it runs on ordinary 
paraffin. Records have been kept of the number of days 
worked, the labour employed, and the petrol, paraffin, and 
lubricant consumed at each class of work. The ‘ Deprecia- 
tion’ on the machine is calculated on a life of ten years, 
that is, £30 per annum. There are obvious objections to 
this basis, for depreciation should depend on the amount of 
work done rather than on the passage of time, but the work 
done varies so much in its destructive effect, as, for example, 
in the case of road haulage on the one hand, and in chaff- 
cutting on the other hand, that no satisfactory method of 
distribution along this line suggests itself. Moreover, in an 
industry so much in its infancy as the manufacture of agri- 
cultural motors, the element of time cannot altogether be 
1 Another calculation places this advantage at 50 per cent. in favour of 
the English farm labourer. (J. Ellis Barker, ‘Germany’s Food Legislation’ , 
The Edinburgh Review October, 1916.)

ignored, for it is probable that the patterns of machines now 
in use will have been superseded entirely during the next 
ten years. Both ‘Repairs’ and ‘ Depreciation’ have been 
distributed in the Table above on the basis of the paraffin 
consumption, the assumption being made that the greater 
the amount of fuel consumed the greater would be the wear 
and tear. ‘Licences and Insurance’ have been divided in 
proportion to the number of days worked. The man in 
charge of the tractor received wages at the rate of 5s. 10d. 
per day, including allowances, and he had a boy to help 
him at 1s. per day. As regards the harvesting, it should be 
noted that the corn was rather badly laid, and most of it 
could be cut one way only. 
Examining the figures it is at once observed that the cost 
of each operation is considerably augmented by the fact 
that the machine was in use on hardly more than one day 
in four. Thus, the fixed charges, insurance, depreciation, 
&e., tend to overload the cost very materially. Certainly 
such a machine ought to be able to work on fully three 
times as many days, and in the following Table, giving the 
analysis of the unit cost of the various operations as usually 
performed, figures are also given showing to what the costs 
would have amounted had the motor been employed to that 
extent—say about five days per week.’ (See Table XXVIL.) 
The reduction that might be expected with more regular 
employment is very considerable, amounting to so much as 
38s. 7d. per acre on ploughing, 64d. per mile on haulage, and 
1s. 1d. per ton on chaff- and root-cutting. Moreover, this 
does not represent the whole saving possible with more 
continuous use. It will be noted that the ratio of petrol 
consumption to paraffin in the case of chaff- and root-cutting 
is very high, the explanation being that the ten days spent 
at this work were made up of 160 half-hours. Thus, eight 
times as much petrol was consumed in starting the engine 
as would have been required if the work had been performed   
      
1 For other figures for the cost of ploughing see article on ‘ Motor 
Ploughs and Motor Ploughing’, by A. Amos, in the Journal of the Royal 
Agricultural Society of England vol. 1xxvi. p. 88.

  OF FARMING COSTS IN 1915 73 
in 20 half-days. It is obvious that the maximum advantage 
from the use of mechanical power on the farm can only be 
obtained in connexion with large-scale production, or by 
co-operation amongst small farmers. 
C. Farmyarp Manure 
The determination of the cost of farmyard manure is one 
of considerable importance to the farmer. In compounding 
rations for stock the idea prevails so generally that what is 
wasted as food is recovered as manure, that'there is a danger 
of piling up the cost of dung beyond its value, by too heavy 
allowances of concentrated foods. This danger would be 
reduced if the book-keeping on the farm were such as would 
direct the attention of the management to the question of 
relative costs. 
The figures given below show the cost of farmyard manure 
on three farms. The straw costs were ascertained by 
dividing the total cost of each corn crop between straw and 
grain, upon the basis of their respective market values. The 
method has been discussed on p. 88, and is described in 
detail again later (see p. 86); the costs per ton for each 
variety of straw on the three farms concerned appear in the 
tables of crop costs. 
If the market values of the straw had been taken, the 
results would have been very different, but even in those 
localities where there is a steady market for straw there is 
nothing to justify a departure from the farmer’s own 
experience by substituting for it the values placed upon the 
stuff by other consumers. Ifthe principle upon which the 
division of the total cost between grain and straw be 
accepted, the figure placed upon the straw represents, in 
effect, the price paid by the farmer for it, and this is 
obviously the figure which must be used in all cost calcula- 
tions into which the price of straw enters. 
The cost of the manurial residue of foods is calculated

from Voelcker’s and Hall’s tables. The whole cost of the 
foods has been charged against the live stock consuming 
them in the first instance, and they have been credited, 
subsequently, with the value of the residues; this is then 
carried to the debit of the farmyard manure account. (See 
Table XXVIIL)

No labour appears in the statement ; the cost of littering 
yards has been charged against the live stock, and labour 
on emptying yards and on carting and spreading manure 
has gone against the field or crop benefiting by it. Unfortu- 
nately, the total cost can only be given per load, as in no 
case were any weighings performed. Nor has it been 
possible to distinguish between the cost of manures from 
different classes of stock or from varying systems of feeding ; 
these results can only be obtained when more supervision 
can be given to the recording on the farms, unless, indeed, 
they belong more properly to the work of an experimental 
station. The analysis figures show very clearly the extent 
to which the cost of the manure is affected by the amount 
of concentrated foods consumed.

Just as the root-crop, or the bare fallow, must be regarded 
as the starting-point of the rotation, so it is also the founda- 
tion for the determination of the cost of all farm produce. 
The reason for this is that the cultivations performed at this 
stage in the rotation are rendered necessary largely to clean 
the land after the preceding corn crops, and to prepare it for 
the coming ones. Few farmers would grow turnips for any 
other reason, and so a portion of the cost of this crop must 
be carried forward and distributed amongst all those that 
intervene until the fallow crop comes round again. 
It is no new principle. It has long been recognized that 
the action of certain manures endures for more than one 
crop, and that proportions of their values must be carried 
forward to the charge of the crop following that to which 
they are applied, and the cost of certain of the cleaning 
processes in the growth of turnips, or the whole cost of the 
bare fallow, must be treated in the same way. Thus, the 
determination of the cost of all succeeding crops, and con- 
sequently, too, of all live stock, and live stock products, is 
influenced by the cost of the root crop. 
The figures in Table XXIX give the analysed gross cost 
of growing turnips on four farms in 1914-15. In the case 
of the East Midlands farm field accounts were kept, so that 
it is possible to give the details for each field ; in the other 
cases the fields given up to turnips were pooled in one 
‘Turnip Crop’ account. 
From this table of the actual gross cost of the crops, 
a second table (Table XXX) showing the estimated net cost 
has been prepared by the elimination of all labour not 
strictly required for the growth of roots, and further, of all 
manures which, by the established practice of farm valua- 
tions, are held to be unexhausted and available for the 
following crop or crops. With the aid of the labour-sheets

  78 ANALYSIS OF RECORDS 
a list of all operations was made in the case of each farm, 
and they were then classed as those necessary for the growth 
of roots, and those done solely to clean the land. 
The‘ Manual and Horse Labour’ represent that which was 
considered to be fairly chargeable against the root crop, and 
amounted approximately to two-thirds of the cultivation, &e., 
performed. The rest of the cost of workings has been carried 
forward for distribution amongst the succeeding crops. 
This apportionment of the cost is not so arbitrary as might 
seem probable at first sight. With a statement of the work 
done before him, there is no reason why a sharp and accurate 
division should not be drawn by the farmer, or his accountant, 
between those operations performed to clean the land and 
those necessary to grow the crop. 
The charge for ‘ Rent and Rates’ represents an apportion- 
ment of these items for the farm asa whole. After deducting 
the estimated amount of rent and rates chargeable in respect 
of the farm house, the balance is divided between arable 
and grass land by the farmer according to his assessment of 
their respective values, and each part is then split up over 
the fields on an acreage basis. Buildings are pooled with 
the land, because land unequipped with buildings is useless, 
generally speaking, and thus it may be made quite properly 
to bear whatever proportion of the whole rent might be 
considered to issue out of the buildings. Rent and rates on 
the farm house are charged against the farmer’s private 
account, or against the ‘General Expenses’. 
This method of apportioning rent and rates is the best 
that can be adopted at present. No one knows so well as 
the farmer the respective values of the various components 
of his farm, but as time goes by the accounts themselves will 
supply the best and only really accurate means of assessing 
values and of apportioning rent. When a whole rotation 
of crops has been recorded on any farm, a comparison of the 
financial results on each field will give a comparison of their 
values. The figures would be liable to be affected by the 
seasons, but they would be confirmed or corrected when the 
results of the second rotation were available. 
 
-P-A-G-E-91
  OF FARMING COSTS IN 1915 79 
‘General Expenses’ are a considerable item, amounting 
in one case to nearly 25 per cent. of the total cost. The 
composition and distribution of this charge have already 
been described (see p. 43), but it may be repeated that in 
keeping the accounts the practice has been to charge as 
much as possible of the expenses direct to definite depart- 
ments. No item has been put into ‘General Expenses’ 
which could by any means be included elsewhere, but even 
so there will always be a number of charges which cannot 
be dealt with directly, and for which some account such as 
this one is necessary. In distributing the balance of this 
account it was decided to bring in only the productive 
accounts, as thereby work is saved without any sacrifice of 
accuracy. For example, no share of general expenses is 
charged to such departments of the farm as ‘Purchased 
Foods’, or‘ Manures’, or ‘ Horse Labour’, for the balances of 
these accounts are in their turn distributed over the more 
directly productive departments, such as ‘ Crops’, and ‘ Live 
stock’, The method is, therefore, to charge general 
expenses only against accounts capable of showing a profit, 
and the principle on which the distribution is made is to 
vary the amount directly with the turn over of these 
accounts—an account with a turn over of a thousand pounds 
bearing twice as much of this charge as one in which the 
total transactions amount only to five hundred pounds. The 
assumption made is that the advantage gained by each 
department from general expenses should bear a close rela- 
tion to the volume of the transactions in which each is 
involved, and it is probably very nearly correct. Other 
methods of distribution have been tried, but none has been 
found that appeared so satisfactory. 
No attempt was made on the farms to record the weight 
of roots grown, so that the costs in the Table have to be 
left at per acre instead of at per ton. An analysis of the 
cost per acre on the several farms gives the following 
results :—

    An analysis on an acreage basis does not possess the 
interest which would attach to the analysis of the cost per 
ton of roots. In the former case the percentages are upset 
for purposes of comparison by variations in the matter of 
rent, and of rates of pay; in the latter case these points 
should adjust themselves, for more highly rented land and 
more highly paid labour should be proportionately more 
productive, and some interesting and valuable information 
on these points will be forthcoming when crop-yields are 
available. 
The suggestion was made by a well-known economist, to 
whom some of the figures appearing in this Report were
-P-A-G-E-93
  OF FARMING COSTS IN 1915 81 
shown, that rent should be omitted from the calculations 
altogether, as not entering strictly into the cost of produc- 
tion. This suggestion has been considered very carefully, 
but, in order to give effect to it, it would have been neces- 
sary to make a valuation of each farm with the object of 
separating interest on capital from true rent, and while this 
may be undertaken at a future stage of the work it has not 
been possible so far. The rent paid for the land is included, 
therefore, as an item of cost in all the determinations, and 
the balance of probability is that this course is substantially 
correct. An investigation conducted by the Land Agents’ 
Society in the year 1909 showed that about 30 per cent. of 
the farmer’s rent is expended by the landlord on repairs 
and on management for the maintenance of rent,! and on 
well-equipped farms the balance can represent little or 
nothing more than the interest on the landlord’s capital 
invested in equipment. 
b. Mangolds 
The cost of the mangold crop is given on two farms only, 
and in Table XXXII the gross cost is stated. 
The details of cost have been arrived at exactly in the 
same way as in the case of the turnip crop, and call for no 
further explanation. The calculation of the net cost differs 
in two particulars. In the first place, no deduction has been 
made from the cost of labour in respect of work done to 
clean the land rather than to grow the crop. That mangolds 
are a cleaning crop is undeniable, but they are not grown as 
such in the way that turnips and other kindred crops 
certainly are. In the second place, only three-quarters of 
the cost of manures applied to mangolds has been credited 
to them and carried forward to other crops. In the case of 
turnips consumed on the land the whole value of manures 
was credited, but mangolds are invariably carted off, and, 
following the recommendations of Voelcker and Hall, one- 
quarter of the manurial value has been taken as being

absorbed by the crop, or lost to succeeding crops in some 
other way. The deduction from the charge for ‘ Unexhausted 
Manures and Cleaning Costs’ represents the proportion of 
this item carried forward to be exhausted amongst the 
remainder of the crops in the rotation. (See explanation, 
p. 41.) 
The net cost for the mangold crop (Table X XXIII) has 
been analysed on the basis of the cost of one acre. Unfortu- 
nately, in this case as also with the turnips, no records of 
yields are available except in loads, so that neither the net 
cost per ton, nor an analysis of such cost, can be given. 
This is much to be regretted, as it would have been of 
interest to determine to what extent the greater value of the 
land and the greater application of capital to the crop in the 
case of the South Midlands farm were balanced by an 
increased yield.

at in the way already described except as regards the rent. 
Another crop follows the potatoes in the same year, and the 
grower considered that the rent should be apportioned in the 
ratio of seven to five, the potatoes bearing the larger share. 
The manure bill is a very heavy item, and undoubtedly some 
of it should go forward to the next crop, but custom allows 
nothing where the potatoes are sold off the farm, and it was 
decided, for this year at all events, to follow the same 
practice in the accounts. 
The crop was sold in the ground, so that the expense of 
lifting is not included in the labour, nor was it-possible to 
obtain the weight of potatoes lifted, so that no costs per ton 
can be given. It will be observed that seed and manures 
account for more than two-thirds of the expenses. 
2. Barley 
Barley follows naturally after roots, and the cost of this 
crop on three farms in barley-growing counties is available 
(Table XXXVI). 
In the case of the East Midlands farm field accounts were 
kept, and the cost per field, as well as the cost for the whole 
crop, is given. The fact that the barley seems to have been 
taken ‘ out of course’ on many fields is explained partly, no 
doubt, by war-cropping, but more by the fact that the turnip 
crop of the preceding year was largely a failure, owing to 
drought, and fields which would have been ‘barley after 
roots’ became ‘ wheat after fallow’. 
Manual and horse labour on the crops were recorded in 
each case as already described. With regard to the manures, 
nothing has been allowed to the crop for the unexhausted 
values of those applied except in the case of farmyard 
manures. Two-thirds of the cost of this have been charged 
against the barley crop, and one-third has been carried for- 
ward to the debit of the following crop. This practice has 
been followed in all cases where farmyard manure is applied 
to corn crops. The ‘Unexhausted Manures and Cleaning 
Costs’ charged have nothing to do with work done or
-P-A-G-E-100
86 ANALYSIS OF RECORDS 
manures applied directly to the barley crops, but represent 
that proportion of values brought forward from previous 
crops which is held to be worked off in the barley crop. In 
the case of manurial residues brought into the account, the 
whole has also been written off where the barley was to be 
the last crop in the rotation, otherwise the figure charged 
represents a proportionate part of this item. (See p. 40.) 
The apportionment of ‘General: Expenses’ has been 
explained already (p. 43), but as regards ‘Thatching, 
threshing, and delivery’ it should be added, in the case of 
the East Midlands farm, that the costs were not actually 
recorded separately for each field as would appear from the 
table, but the figures given represent the total cost appor- 
tioned on an acreage basis. Until, or unless, a practice 
should be made on farms of stacking, threshing, and 
delivering corn from separate fields separately, no other 
method of charging this item of cost can be applied, but it 
is unlikely that any appreciable error is introduced by the 
present way of dealing with it. 
The ‘Total Yield’ and the ‘Yield per acre’ are given 
both in grain and in straw, the former measured and the 
latter estimated. It seems very desirable to separate the 
cost of the grain from that of the straw, but as the two are 
produced together by the same processes and by the same 
outlay this cannot be done by any practical means. It may 
be effected, however, in a theoretical way as already sug- 
gested on p. 36, and in the examples given here the dis- 
tribution of tétal cost has been made on the basis of 
a comparison of the supposed market values of the grain 
and the straw. 
The figures in the final column will probably be of greater 
general interest. These give the cost per quarter of the 
crop, charging all expenses against the grain only, and 
ignoring the straw. It will be seen that the cost varies 
between 24s. 6d. and 27s. 24d. per quarter, the average being 
26s. 8d. per quarter, while the average yield is exactly 
4 quarters per acre. 
An analysis of the cost per quarter shows the results given

in Table XXXVII. As any value of the straw has been 
ignored in this Table, the percentages represent also the 
analysis of the cost of the whole crop per acre.

3. Wheat 
The cost of wheat growing has been ascertained on 
three farms, on one of which field accounts were kept 
(Table XXXVIII). The principles on which the calcula- 
tions are based, and the methods followed in making them, 
have been described already when dealing with the barley 
crop, and call for no further statement in detail. In 
the two cases where a bare fallow preceded a wheat crop, 
the manual and horse labour employed have been divided 
between that which was necessary to prepare for the crop 
and that which was applied to clean the land. The latter 
costs have been carried forward for distribution amongst 
the succeeding crops in the manner already explained (see 
p. 41).

  88 ANALYSIS OF RECORDS 
As with the barley the total cost of the wheat crop has 
been divided between grain and straw on the basis of their 
comparative market values, and the greater marketability of 
wheat-straw renders some such calculation the more neces- 
sary. Atthe same time itis true, probably, that the majority 
of farmers do not sell their straw, and it is doubtful whether 
they would accept a valuation on these lines when applied 
to home consumption rather than to sale. It seems desir-

able, therefore, to give an alternative calculation for the cost 
of a quarter of wheat, without deducting the value of the 
straw, and it is the figure thus arrived at which has been 
used in the analysis appearing in Table XXXIX. On this 
basis the cost per quarter varies from 26s. to 35s. 11d., the 
average of all the farms being 30s. 2d. The average yield is 
a fraction below four quarters per acre. The average price 
of wheat for the five years 1910-14 was 34s. 7d. per quarter of 
504 lb., so that on the foregoing calculation of cost there

  OF FARMING COSTS IN 1915 89 
would be a margin of profit amounting to 4s. 5d. per quarter 
for the farmer. If the price were to rise to the average 
figure at which it stood, say, thirty years ago, between the 
years 1880-4, namely 44s., the margin would be increased 
by 9s. 5d. per quarter, which is equivalent to an increase of 
37s, 8d. per acre of wheat grown, assuming an average yield 
of four quarters per acre, 
4. Oats 
Three English farms and one Scottish farm figure in the 
oat costs (Tables XL, XLI). On each of them spring oats 
only were grown. As with the barley and wheat crops the 
grain alone was measured, the figures for straw being the 
farmer's estimates. The average yield of grain on all 
the farms is just 54 quarters; the average cost, ignoring the 
straw, is 16s. 11d. per quarter, the highest being 20s. 5d. and 
the lowest 18s. 4d. per quarter. 
5. Hay 
a. Clover Hay 
The cost of hay is arrived at in the way already described 
in connexion with other crops, except that an allowance has 
to be made for the value of the aftermath. In the absence 
of any figures for the comparative values of the two parts of 
the crop, the apportionment of the total cost has to be made 
arbitrarily, and the method followed in the figures given 
has been to charge all labour on hay-making against the 
hay, and to apportion the remaining costs as to two-thirds 
to the hay and as to one-third to the aftermath (Table XLII). 
It is doubtful whether ‘General Expenses’ should be 
included in the cost. Following the principle laid down 
that this item is only to be charged against the final pro- 
ducts of the farm (see p. 44), it would be included where 
hay is sold, but omitted where it is produced only to be con- 
sumed on the farm. Reliable figures are available from two 
farms only. The cost per acre in either case is very similar, 
 
-P-A-G-E-107
  
RECORDS OF FARMING COSTS IN 1915 91 
but owing to the low yield on the Eastern Counties farm, 
the costs per ton show a considerable divergence. 
b. Meadow Hay 
No satisfactory analysis of the cost of meadow hay in the 
year 1914-15 can be given. 
6. Pastures and Grazing 
In no case did the farm records, as kept, allow of a distinc- 
tion being drawn between permanent and temporary pas- 
tures. The stock, more especially the sheep, are moved about 
from grass land to seeds, and from one field to another, and, 
although there is not the slightest reason why an account 
should not be kept of the number of days spent on each, it 
has not yet been attempted, and the grazing must be treated 
as one crop. 
As pasturage is nothing more than a food for the live stock 
of the farm which it is more convenient to produce than to 
buy, no question of profit or of loss is involved, and it is only 
necessary to ascertain its cost to the farmer, and to charge 
this against the stock consuming it. Any profit or loss 
which may arise from its use will be realized on the sale of 
the stock. 
To determine the cost of the grazing, the expenditure on 
manual and horse labour is got from the farm labour-sheets 
and the horse account; purchased manures applied are 
charged at that proportion of the total cost which represents 
the amount held to be exhausted during the year, the 
remainder being carried forward to the years following. 
The proportion will vary with the nature of the manure; 
thus, in the East Midlands where chalk is applied to the 
land it is customary to regard no part of it as being 
exhausted during the four following years—presumably 
because it may take that time to become properly incorpo- 
rated with the soil—after which one-eighth is held to be 
exhausted annually, and when twelve years have passed 
   
-P-A-G-E-108
92 ANALYSIS OF RECORDS 
from the date of the application the item passes out of the 
books. Nitrate of soda, on the other hand, would generally 
be regarded as having no lasting effect, and the whole of its 
cost would be charged against the year of its application. 
Farmyard manure is treated in an exactly similar way, 
two-thirds of the cost in this case being charged against the 
first season following the application, and the remainder 
carried forward. The method of apportioning rent and 
rates has already been described (see p. 42). The values 
of the manurial residues of the foods consumed on the 
pastures are got, with the assistance of Voelcker’s and 
Hall’s tables, from the Food Record sheets, which indicate 
the nature and quantity of foods fed to grazing stock. 
The cost of these residues has always been written off 
completely after two years, that is, in the year following 
their application. 
In the case of the Eastern Counties farm no records of 
foods fed on pastures in the year 1913-14 are available, so 
that no charge for residues can be made. 
As no manurial residues have been carried forward, the 
item for Unexhausted Costs refers only to the cost of seed, 
sowing, &c., on temporary pastures. On the East Midlands 
farm the figure seems to be a very low one—some seven 
shillings per acre—seeing that seed alone will amount, 
usually, to ten shillings or more. The explanation is that 
some of these temporary grazings have been down for more 
than one year, and part of their cost has already been written 
off. It is not easy to get a reliable basis for this distribution 
of the cost of forming temporary pastures. In the first 
place, a farmer does not always know how long he will leave 
a seed-ley down, for this may depend upon how well it 
stands, or upon other uncertainties. Where the ley is 
intended to be left for a definite period, the cost of seed and 
sowing is written off by equal annual amounts; where the 
period is uncertain, the cost is distributed as to one-half over 
the first year, and as to the other half over the second year, 
or over the second and third years if the ley remains so 
long. After the third year of an indeterminate period,

OF FARMING COSTS IN 1915 93 
nothing is carried forward. Itis admitted that this method 
is to be justified chiefly on the grounds of convenience ; 
a better method may be devised with greater experience, 
and in the meantime, fortunately, the probable error is 
a slight one. There is no charge on this head on the Eastern 
and South Midlands farms, because in both of these cases 
the only temporary pasture included in the account is that 
following clover mown for hay, so that the proportion of the 
cost of seed and sowing chargeable against the grazing 
appears in the item ‘aftermath’. (See later.) 
Thus the total cost of the grazing, both permanent and 
temporary, is arrived at. 
On most farms it is not merely sufficient to ascertain the 
cost of the pastures in order to arrive at the cost of the 
grazing. Commonly the aftermath from clover and meadow 
hay fields is grazed, and this grazing must be brought into 
the account. The most satisfactory way of doing this has 
not, in all probability, been found as yet. An arbitrary 
assumption has been made that the cost of the aftermath 
grass is one-third of the whole cost of the field, excluding 
hay-making costs. (See p. 89.) Thus, the hay crop has 
not been charged with this portion of the cost, and it is now 
brought into the grazing account. Perhaps a better way of 
dealing with this item would be by comparing its stock- 
carrying capacity with that of the pasture fields, or by 
a comparison of the feeding value of the grass and of the 
aftermath. In the case of the Eastern Counties farm the 
aftermath accounts for some 25 per cent. of the total cost 
of grazing, whilst on the East Midlands and South Midlands 
farms the proportion is only 8 per cent. and 13 per cent. 
respectively, but nevertheless there is a very close agreement 
between the unit costs of grazing on each farm, as calculated 
in the final column of the Table, which suggests that any 
error due to faulty estimation on this point is not very 
serious. 
Having now arrived at the total cost of grazing, both seeds 
and grass, pastures and aftermath, it became necessary to 
devise a means of distributing it among the various classes 
 
-P-A-G-E-112
94 ANALYSIS OF RECORDS 
of live stock. It will happen only rarely that one class of 
live stock alone is met with on the farm; in certain forms 
of sheep-farming, or where dairying is practised, it may be 
possible, sometimes, to charge the whole cost of the grazing 
to cows or to sheep; but in the great majority of cases the 
grazing will have been enjoyed by horses, cattle, and sheep 
indiscriminately. A system has been adopted, therefore, by 
which all classes of stock are converted into their equivalents 
as sheep. In the Table under consideration the following 
conversion scale has been used : 
1 horse equivalent to 8 sheep 
1 cow or bullock ” »6 ,, 
1 yearling beast o ot sy 
It is obvious that no scale can have a general application, 
and the one above is probably too high, except, possibly, for 
the smaller breeds of sheep. A better way of arranging 
the figures would be by a comparison of weights, and with 
further experience there should be no difficulty in arriving 
at a satisfactory basis. When this has been settled the 
live stock are reduced to their sheep equivalents, the cost 
per unit is calculated, and the distribution of the grazing 
cost is effected. On the three farms under consideration it 
was found that the cost of grazing varied from 8s. 4d. to 
9s. 8d. per head of sheep per annum. (Table XLIII.) 
E. Mitx 
a. Cost of Production 
As already stated, old-established customs controlling 
purchase and sale have made it impossible, so far, to deter- 
mine the cost of animal products on the farm. The only 
exception to this rule is the case of milk, and one reliable 
statement of the cost of milk production for the year 1914-15, 
in a herd of about 52 head of dairy Shorthorns, has been 
obtained. 
The calculation of the cost of milk production has received 
 
-P-A-G-E-113
OF FARMING COSTS IN 1915 95 
an added importance from the controversy in the public 
press over the retail price of this article of food, and it is 
necessary to consider very carefully what, exactly, are the 
items entering into the cost. An attempt was made in the 
earlier stages of the work to keep the costs of the various 
age-classes of dairy stock in water-tight compartments; the 
plan was to ascertain the cost of the young stock, up to the 
time of the first calf, by recording the foods and labour spent 
on them, and to bring them into the dairy herd on calving 
at a valuation based on this cost. The herd itself was valued 
at a fixed price per head, representing the estimated cost 
price, so that the fluctuations of the market were eliminated ; 
the cost of labour, foods, and other expenses were recorded, 
and cows drafted out of the herd on account of old age, or 
other cause, were credited to the herd at the valuation 
figure. In this way the net cost of the dairy herd was to be 
calculated, and from it the cost of the milk would be found 
with the aid of the records of milk yields. 
This plan had speedily to be abandoned. It was found to 
be impossible, in practice, to divide the stock into these 
classes, and then to account accurately for them. Labour 
could only be apportioned roughly, for it was difficult to 
divide the men’s time satisfactorily where dry cows and 
young heifers were being tended indiscriminately, and 
where calf-rearing and milk-production were going on side 
by side. Similarly, with the feeding, the difficulty of 
keeping the food costs distinct in cases where there was 
little or no attempt made to separate the stock for feeding 
purposes into the classes appearing in the books was really 
insuperable, and was still further complicated by the practice 
of fattening-off old cows for the butcher,—a process which 
will begin while the cow is still in milk, and defies all 
attempts on the part of the farm accountant to distinguish 
between the food which produces milk and that which pro- 
duces meat. 
This plan was therefore abandoned, and on reviewing the 
position it became obvious that all this attempted sub-division 
of the stock was quite unnecessary. Where milk-production 
 
-P-A-G-E-114
  96 ANALYSIS OF RECORDS 
is the object of the management, both the raising of the 
young stock and the fattening-off of the old cows are 
essential parts of the whole process. It is not necessary to 
keep the cost of labour and foods expended on rearing heifers 
to take their place in the herd separate from the cost of 
maintaining the herd itself, neither is it necessary to

eliminate the cost of feeding-off the old cows. Both of 
these things contribute to the system of management on 
farms where the dairy stock is raised by the farmer, and 
both of them must enter into the cost of the milk produced. 
The cost of raising the young stock minus the profit derived
-P-A-G-E-115
OF FARMING COSTS IN 1915 97 
from feeding the old cows for beef (or plus the loss con- 
sequent on this process, as the case may be) represents the 
cost of maintaining the capital value of the herd—-in other 
words, the depreciation on the cows, a figure very difficult to 
determine by any direct means. 
In Table XLIV, therefore, the cost of keeping the bull, 
the cost of raising young cow-stock to replenish the herd, 
the cost of feeding-off old cows for beef, all these items have 
been slumped with the cost of keeping the milking herd, 
and together they make up the cost of milk-production on 
the farm. 
This method of calculation can be followed only where 
milk-production is the main object of the live-stock manage- 
ment, whether for butter, cheese, or new milk. Where the 
raising of store cattle, or the feeding of beef, is practised 
other than as an incident of dairying, it isnecessary, of course, 
to take account of these matters separately. 
The valuation includes bulls and young stock, as well as 
cows. It is made on the basis of a fixed figure per head for 
each class of stock, and this is never varied in conformation 
with temporary fluctuations ofthe market. Where breeding 
stock is being dealt with the importance of keeping the 
valuation free from the influence of market prices, which 
are no concern of the man who is not selling, and which are 
bound to bring about fictitious results, has been stated 
already.!. The valuation of the stock will remain constant, 
therefore, from year to year except in so far as the number 
of head may vary. The figures used were as follows :—

described, and the quantities of purchased and home-grown 
foods consumed are got from the Food record-sheets and 
priced according to cost in either case—the former at the 
cost of purchase, and the latter at the cost ofsproduction. 
It is of the utmost importance to remember that the price 
of home-grown foods is the cost of growing them and not 
their value on the market, otherwise serious errors may be 
introduced into the calculation. In the discussions in the 
press on the cost of milk it is not infrequently asserted that 
the increase in the price of hay and straw—amounting to 
fully 100 per cent.—has thereby increased the cost of pro- 
ducing milk. This does not necessarily follow, indeed, it is 
safe to say that it has affected the cost very little. The 
price of hay and straw to the farmer is the cost of producing 
them, and the fact that the War Office, or some other buyer, 
is willing nowadays to give twice as much for these things 
as would have been paid before the war does not necessarily 
make them more costly to the producer. The farmer who 
had made a favourable forward contract for the cake supply 
would charge it against his stock at the price he paid for it, 
whatever the market value at the moment might be, and, in 
the same way, he must charge his home-grown products at 
the price he paid for them and not at some one else’s valua- 
tion of them.1 
From the cost of foods is deducted the value of the food- 
residues chargeable against the Farmyard Manure or the 
Pastures, according as to whether the foods were fed to stock 
in yards, or to stock on grass. The addition of the cost of 
grazing, calculated as already described (see p. 91), com- 
pletes the food costs.? Then follow sundry cash disburse- 
1 A similar error may be made in connexion with the cost of horse labour, 
which is said, sometimes, to cost twice as much as formerly because the value 
of oats, hay, and straw are twice what they were. For the farmer who 
grows his own horse-keep, as most farmers do, the cost of horse labour 
remains pretty much what it.was before the war. 
® Much information on the cost of food in the production of milk will be 
found in the Reports of the South Eastern Agricultural College, Wye, the 
University College, Leeds, and the University College, Reading. See 
Appendix, pp. 123 and 126.
-P-A-G-E-117

ments, the more important of which are the purchase of 
stock, and payment for the carriage of milk. General 
Expenses include the share of the establishment expenses 
chargeable against the cows. The composition of this item 
and its distribution have been described already. (See 
p. 43.) 
Thus, the gross total cost of the milk production is arrived 
at, and by deducting the sales of draft cows, calves, &c., and 
also the valuation of the stock at the end of the year, the 
net cost is got. The Milk-record sheets provide the number 
of gallons of milk produced during the year, and so the cost 
per gallon is got by division. On the farm in question it 
amounted to just over 9d. per gallon, including the cost of 
delivery to the retailer, but not including the cost of dis- 
tribution by him. 
A second set of costs is available from another farm, though 
they are not strictly comparable with the foregoing, belonging 
as they do to the year from Lady Day, 1915. It may be 
useful, however, to issue them at the present time, in view 
of the prevailing conditions. They relate to the farm Mid- 
lands No. 2, and the accounts have been kept on a different 
basis, by desire of the farmer, all home-grown foods being 
priced at market prices instead of at the cost of production. 
This method was adopted because the farmer has a market, 
at his door, for every sort of produce, and he claimed, 
accordingly, that he was justified in selling his home-grown 
foods to his cows. This view is not uncommonly held, but 
it is unsatisfactory in practice for reasons already given. 
The cost to the farmer of his milk should be the cost to him 
of the labour and materials used in producing it, not the 
cost that other people are willing to incur to procure these 
items. Moreover it is impossible for him to contrast the 
alternative advantages of milk-selling and direct marketing 
of produce, if the milk costs are confused by the intro- 
duction of outside values in substitution of the farmer’s own 
experience. 
In the following calculation these prices have been 
assigned to home-grown foods :

From the evidence supplied by the accounts of this and 
other farms, it is not too much to say that the price charged 
for the home-grown produce is 100 per cent. more than the 
cost of production. Further, no deduction has been made 
from the cost of the purchased foods for the value of the 
manurial residues amounting to £115. Deducting this item 
from the total cost, and also a further sum of £420 in 
respect of the over-charge for home-grown foods, the total 
cost of the milk on this farm is £1,131, which is equivalent 
to 9-165d. per gallon. This is almost identical with the cost 
on the South Midlands farm given in Table XLV, and

Midland Counties farm differ in almost every essential from 
those prevailing on the South Midland farm. The one is 
very highly rented, being virtually accommodation land; 
wages are very high, many of the men making an average 
through the year between 25s. and 30s. per week, one even 
going up to 34s. 6d.; whilst the market lies, so to speak, at 
the back door. On the other holding, land equally good lets 
for about half the money; labour is badly paid, no man 
getting more than an average through the year of 24s. 6d. 
and most of the men making from 14s. 6d. to 20s.,and London, 
which is the market, is some 70 miles away. 
It may be of interest to add that, in the country 
generally, contracts for milk were made at the following 
figures: winter, 1914-15, at 103d.; summer, 1915, at 93d.; 
and winter, 1915-16, at 114d. per gallon.!

b. Cost of the Distribution of Milk 
The costs of distribution are part of the cost of production, 
butit is convenient to consider them separately. No figures 
bearing on the cost of retail distribution of milk are avail- 
able for the year 1914. The subject is one of considerable 
importance, particularly in view of the present controversy 
over the retail price of milk, so that it seems desirable to 
issue some figures which have been prepared for the year 
1915-16. They relate toa well-managed business in a large 
Midland manufacturing town; there are six rounds, and 
the roundsmen, who are paid by commission on the quantity 
sold, earn very large wages.

‘Manual Labour’ includes the commission on sales repre- 
senting the roundsmen’s wages, and all other expenditure 
involved in handling the trade, including clerical labour on 
account-keeping, amounting to £93 12s. per annum. ‘ Horse 
labour’ consists mostly of the keep of the float ponies. The 
item for ‘Depreciation and Sundries’ includes the purchase 
of dairy materials of every kind, and the repair and replace- 
ment of utensils. ‘General Expenses’ are the various 
establishment expenses other than rent. 
The cost of distribution in this case works out to 4d. per 
gallon.

OF FARMING COSTS IN 1915 103 
F. Tue Lazovr-Income From SmMALt Farms 
On small farms anything of the nature of cost determina- 
tion has not yet been achieved. They are so frequently 
managed by the family with little or no paid labour that 
the cost price of the products could only be arrived at by 
the inclusion of estimated figures for this important item. 
It would be of interest and value, however, if the receipts 
and payments on a number of small holdings could be 
collected, so as to show, by difference, the return to the 
family for its labour. The figures would be useful, if 
collected in sufficient number, for comparison with the 
earnings of labour on larger farms and for certain other 
purposes. 
1. Northern Counties No. 1. This farm is situated in 
a somewhat remote hill district. The tenant peforms team- 
labour and sells milk. All the hay and corn are consumed 
at home by the stock, but there are a few sales of green 
crops. Two men are employed and the small-holder’s two 
daughters, who work on the farm, receive payment for their 
services. The cost of their keep is borne by the farmer and 
must come out of the balance available for his remuneration. 
(Table XLVII.) 
No statement of the capital invested has been received, 
but the increase in the value of the stock on the place, taken 
at cost price, has been included in the receipts. The surplus 
available for the farmer is £70 8s. 5d., but as this includes 
the interest on his capital as well as the remuneration of his 
labour, it is quite certain that the latter item was consider- 
ably less than £1 per week. 
2. South Midlands No. 3. Several years ago the owner of 
this holding was a goods porter, earning about 26s. per 
week, in a London railway yard. He bought two acres of 
land from a land company for £80, upon which he built 
a bungalow, the materials for the bungalow costing £30, 
and the owner himself doing the building. At the time 
the accounts begin the total value of land and bungalow 
was estimated at £90. The holding is run as a part-time

enterprise, entirely for the production of eggs and poultry. 
The estimated rent of the house is not charged to the 
poultry, and the rent of the land has been advanced from 
£4 to £4 10s. per annum, as the soil was enriched, but 
while the poultry were charged with this small increase in 
rent, they have not been credited with manurial values of 
foods consumed by them. The land is of a gravelly nature, 
dry but poor. For some time an attempt was made to con- 
tinue poultry-keeping with gardening, using half the land 
for poultry and half for vegetables in alternate years. But 
it was found that the devotion of the whole of the tenant’s 
energies to poultry production gave a greater profit. All 
the ground is still dug over whenever the pens are shifted. 
The occupier spends an average of one-half of each working 
day in attendance on the poultry. At other times he is 
employed off the holding and so adds to his income. The 
accounts given are for the three years 1910-11, 1911-12, 
and 1912-13, and they show a satisfactory rate of progress. 
(Tables XLVIII, XLIX, and L.) 
8. South Midlands No. 4. This small holding consists of 
about one acre of pasture, equipped with poultry-house and 
pig-styes. It is worked by an employé of a railway who 
is fully employed at his job, and most of the attention to 
the holding is given by his wife and children. 
In the year 1912-13 there were considerable losses of 
stock due to disease, and the whole of the stock had to be 
cleared during the year and replenished by chicks reared, 
hence the small receipts from chickens. However, the aim 
was to produce eggs. Since 1918 pigs have been added to 
the holding. 
Unfortunately the accounts are not continuous. The 
results are of interest as giving the value of the work 
performed by his wife and children to the small-holder

  FARMING COSTS IN 1915 lll 
G. Tar Ner Ourrur rrom AGRICULTURE AND ITS 
DistRiBuTION 
In the Final Report on the First Census of Production 
of the United Kingdom (1907) the net output per head of 
persons employed in the industries dealt with in the Census 
of Production Office is given as £104 for England and 
Wales. The net output is ascertained by deducting the cost 
of materials at works from the value of the net output at 
works. This result constitutes for any industry the fund 
from which wages, salaries, rent, royalties, rates, taxes, 
depreciation, advertisement, and sales expenses, and all other 
similar charges have to be defrayed, as well as profits.2 The 
same basis of calculation was adopted in the Report of the 
Board of Agriculture and Fisheries on the Agricultural Output 
of Great Britain® made in connexion with the Census of Pro- 
duction Act, 1906, when the output per person permanently 
employed in agriculture was ascertained to be £90, or £129 
if the occupiers themselves were excluded.* The accounts 
of half a dozen farms, kept at the Institute for Research in 
Agricultural Economics, at Oxford, in the year 1914-15, may 
be cited in general confirmation of this figure, if the rise in 
prices for agricultural produce since 1906 be allowed for, 
whilst at the same time they show the distribution of the 
net output as between landlord, occupier, and labourer. The 
average net output per man, namely £169, compares with 
the higher figure given in the Board’s Report, as the occu- 
piers have been excluded from the calculation. The farms 
concerned are mostly fairly large, and it is probable that 
the output is higher than the average of the country. The 
figures vary a good deal from farm to farm, but it is note- 
worthy that the distribution of the net output as between 
farmer, labour, and landlord is fairly constant, notwith- 
standing the fact that the farms are scattered all over 
England and Scotland, and that many varieties of manage-

ment are represented. One of them is an intensive potato- 
growing farm ; another is a suburban milk-farm; another is 
situated seven miles from the nearest railway station; but 
in spite of all these and other differences the net results are 
more or less the same. The fact noted in the Board of 
Trade Report that a large net output per head is usually 
associated with high wages is exemplified by farms A and B. 
On the other hand, the farm D, which is situated in a county 
where the rates of wages are almost the lowest in England, 
bears out this statement equally in the low output per man 
employed. The farm E may possibly indicate, too, by its 
results that the experience of industry in that a high net 
output per head is also associated with heavy capital 
expenditure will probably be repeated in agriculture, for 
although the output is relatively low, it will be noted that 
nearly 50 per cent. of the labour employed was woman 
labour. (Table LIII.) 
As regards the distribution of the net output, it must be 
remembered that only in the case of labour is the whole of 
the share available as net income. Considerable payments 
have to be met both by the farmer and the landlord out of 
the shares which they retain, and a recalculation of the 
figures has been made to show the distribution of what may 
be termed the net returns, as distinct from the net output. 
To do this, all'the ordinary expenses except labour and rent 
have been deducted from the total receipts. Besides these, 
a figure amounting to 7% per cent. on the capital invested 
by the farmer has also been deducted, as representing the 
interest which capital involved in an enterprise, more or 
less speculative, might reasonably be expected to earn. 
Lastly, a deduction has been made to the extent of one-third 
of the rent, as representing the expenditure upon the holding 
necessary on the part of the landlord in order to maintain 
the rent. This is not an arbitrary figure. From an inquiry 
conducted by the Land Agents’ Society in the year 1909, it 
appeared that about 80 per cent. of the rent received by the 
landlord is expended by him in repairs, insurance, manage- 
ment, and similar payments necessary to maintain the

difference represents the surplus available for the remunera-

have been made representing interest on the landlord’s

labour. The variations from this average are extraordinarily 
slight when the differences of locality, soil, size, equipment, 
capitalization, wages, objects of management, &c., are re- 
membered. The returns are not sufliciently comprehensive 
to admit of any generalization being made from them, and 
many more records, extending over longer periods will be 
required before the various interesting speculations which 
suggest themselves can safely be followed up.
-P-A-G-E-134
  CHAPTER V 
CONCLUSION 
Let it be stated over again that the figures in the foregoing 
chapter are introduced not as evidence on which to base 
generalizations on food and other costs, but to illustrate the 
method of cost determination, and to show what information 
may be expected from investigations of farm economics by 
experimental methods, when sufficient data are available. 
Not only should a familiarity with farming costs be essential 
to individual farmers in the direction and development of 
their own management, but the ability to compare the 
experience of many individuals is of fundamental importance 
. in the framing of national policy. At the present time far- 
reaching reforms are under discussion, and the introduction 
of new factors in production is being urged, none of which 
can be stated or considered scientifically without access 
to reliable statistical matter upon which to base the pro- 
posed changes. Take, for example, the recommendation 
of Lord Milner’s Committee in regard to a guarantee to 
farmers as to the price of wheat.1 Although the Govern- 
ment decided that no action on these lines was necessary at 
the time, the question is still being very seriously debated, 
and there is a considerable body of opinion in favour of 
guaranteed prices for all staple food products, not merely to 
increase food supplies during the period of the war, but as 
a kind of War Insurance during times of peace, so that by 
giving an artificial stability to prices the development of 
home agriculture might artificially be stimulated, want of 
confidence in the market acting, it is said, as a deterrent 
to production under the conditions prevailing before the 
war. Ifit should be decided that considerations of public 
1 Cd. 8048, 
 
-P-A-G-E-135
  CONCLUSION 117 
safety require that guarantees of this kind should be given 
to the farmer, the first essential is to know the normal cost 
of production of the articles concerned. It should not be 
regarded as sufficient to collect opinions, or to make estimates. 
The present controversy over the price of milk shows how 
many errors can creep into mere estimates of cost, and 
suggests that in all probability there would be no general 
agreement between producer or consumer as to what the 
figure should be. Even should unanimity be achieved the 
figures would have no reliable basis, and farmers, on the one 
hand, might be disappointed in the results, or the public, 
on the other hand, might unconsciously be exploited. The 
only sound foundation for any scheme of guaranteed prices 
is a knowledge of the cost of production of the articles 
concerned. 
Or assume that nothing is done in this direction, and that 
the decision of the Government, arrived at in 1915, not to 
interfere by legislation in food prices be confirmed in the 
future. The importance of a knowledge of the cost of 
production of food in this country is no whit diminished, 
for the successful development of the agricultural industry, 
otherwise than by the increase of technical skill, scientific 
knowledge, and so forth, will then be dependent on the 
ability to compare home costs with those of our over-seas 
Dominions and those foreign countries which largely control 
our markets. . The conclusions drawn from such comparisons 
should be of a nature to direct attention to the probable 
course of agricultural prices, and farmers would be fore- 
warned of impending changes and thus forearmed in 
meeting them. 
Take, again, the question of the size of holdings. At the 
present time there is a strong movement on foot to promote 
the splitting-up of large farms into small holdings, both by 
stimulating private action, and by legislation. On the other 
hand, the idea is growing that agriculture can best be deve- 
1 Since this was written the Government has adopted a system of maximum 
prices for certain products, and the reception given to it by the farmers is 
one more illustration of the urgent need for reliable information.
-P-A-G-E-136
  118 CONCLUSION 
loped by combining large holdings into farms bigger still, 
for the purpose of applying to agriculture the organization 
for large-scale production which has been found to be 
essential in the development of all other industries. Both 
movements have for their object the provision of a better 
life for the worker, and more food for the nation, and the 
comparative advantages of the two courses would be made 
clearer if the statistical information on the subject were 
more complete, and if records of the results, social, financial, 
and productive, of large and small scale production, were 
available. 
Take, again, the financing of agriculture. It is common 
knowledge amongst those interested in the land that farmers, 
particularly small farmers, do not easily attract capital to 
their enterprise by the ordinary methods common in in- 
dustry. The fact that they keep no accounts renders it 
impossible for them to make the ordinary commercial appeal 
to financial institutions, and the credit they obtain is got 
frequently by devious and expensive methods. But bankers 
are in business to supply credit, not to refuse it, and with 
the spread of the practice of accountancy as an essential part 
of the management of the farm, large or small, will come 
the access to capital which many farmers obtain only with 
difficulty, or upon exorbitant terms. It seems probable that 
a development in this direction would go far to render 
unnecessary the schemes for the provision of credit by State 
banking organizations, which have proved difficult to devise, 
and which, even if established, would always be open to the 
objection that they are based on a recognition of a weakness 
in farm management which they would do little to remove. 
Take, next, the cost of the distribution of food. What 
does this amount to? It is a matter of frequent observation 
that, however depressed the condition of British agriculture 
may be, the middlemen serving the industry contrive to do 
well out of it, and it is not infrequently asserted that the toll 
they take for their services is extortionate. This view has 
been put forward very strongly by the Departmental Com- 
mittee appointed to consider the settlement and employment
-P-A-G-E-137
  CONCLUSION 119 
of soldiers and sailors on the land, for in their Report! they 
go so far as to state that the difference between the whole- 
sale and retail prices of agricultural products is so great as 
to represent a degree of economic weakness which would 
ruin any other industry. The Committee would not have 
made such an assertion without evidence which satisfied 
them, but, once again, exact information based on actual 
records is probably non-existent, and until figures can be 
produced in confirmation of this statement the difficulty 
of putting the case for the producer convincingly is obvious. 
Consider, now, the distribution of the divisible surplus 
from farming as between landlord, farmer, and farm labourer. 
What should be their respective shares in the net returns of 
agricultural enterprise? Nothing definite is known as to 
the interest on capital invested in agriculture, nor of the 
farmer’s salary regarded as managing director, and when 
such questions as the remuneration of farm labourers, with 
special reference to the establishment of Wages Boards, are 
being considered so seriously as at the present time, it is of 
the first importance that accurate information as to the 
returns from farming should be available. A great society, 
whose members are well qualified to form conclusions on 
this point, has expressed the opinion that in normal times 
it is unlikely that farmers will be able to pay a rate of wages 
to their labourers high enough to allow the latter to offer 
a commercial rent for a cottage. Such a statement would 
not have been made without a full sense of responsibility, 
but, if it could be supported by reference to records of the 
cost of production in agriculture, it would gain immensely 
in weight, and rural social reformers who look to secure 
economic independence for the farm worker through the 
regulation of wages by the State would have to take a wider 
view of the difficulties of the problem. As regards rent, the 
policy of most landlords in refraining from an adjustment 
of rental to meet rising prices is not infrequently called in 
question as contributing to make possible a low standard of 
1 Cd. 8182. par. 22.

-P-A-G-E-138
  120 CONCLUSION 
production. It is stated, with some show of reason, that the 
benevolence of landlords in this direction enables their 
tenants to make a good living without troubling to make 
their management very energetic, and that the consequent 
loss to the community is considerable. On the other hand, 
the difficulty of raising rents to sitting tenants is well known 
by those concerned with the management of land. Thestep 
is bound to be attended with unpopularity, whilst the land- 
lord willing to face this is not infrequently called upon to 
meet a charge of ‘raising the rent on the tenant’s improve- 
ments’. Here, again, the misunderstanding of the true 
position, on the one side or the other as the case may be, 
ought not to arise if both parties were in the habit of basing 
their relations on financial results rather than on the less 
substantial grounds of sentiment or assertion. 
In fact, it does not seem too much to say that the wide 
divergencies of opinion on the foregoing, as well as on many 
other points in the organization of the agricultural industry, 
and the difficulties in framing sound policies both for the 
reconstruction of our greatest national industry as a whole, 
and for the management of individual holdings, are due 
almost entirely to the lack of statistical information con- 
cerning it, particularly such as can only be obtained by 
scientific book-keeping. It is not pretended that the figures 
contained in the Report here presented will contribute much 
to the elucidation of the problems enumerated, but it is 
hoped that they will be regarded as indicating the beginnings 
of a movement in that direction. To get results of the 
maximum value it will be necessary to bring additional 
strength to bear on the work, and with a fuller realization 
of its importance this should be forthcoming. There are 
several hopeful indications; farmers co-operating with the 
Institute at Oxford have expressed their sense of the value 
of the work, and other investigators have recognized the 
need for research along these lines by setting themselves to 
examine the cost of particular products. These are indica- 
tions of a growing recognition of the importance to the 
agricultural industry of the determination of farming costs.

(This is an important investigation of the cost of feeding cows, 
representing one of the earliest examinations of farming costs made 
in this country. The nominal basis of the charges for the various 
foods consumed is their cost to the farmer. In the case of bought 
foods this is readily determined, and in the case of foods grown on 
the farm, figures are used which have been agreed upon as fair 
average costs between the author of the paper and the farmers 
collaborating with him. Probably some of these figures would have 
been modified if it had been possible to calculate the costs from 
daily records of operations on the farms instead of estimating them ; 
but it was not possible to incur this amount of labour, although the 
difficulty of getting satisfactory results by any of the other means is 
fully recognized. Some of the figures assumed seem to indicate 
that estimated cost prices have been affected to a certain extent by 
local market prices. Recent newspaper controversy on the cost of 
certain farm products has shown that it is not always easy to satisfy 
the producer that the price which some one will pay for his stuff 
need have no relation to its cost to him, The determination of the 
actual cost of home-grown foods is fundamental in all calculations 
of the cost of animal products.)

over and over again in the organization of other forms of enterprise 
do not apply to agriculture. From internal evidence it is clear that 
the author has never attempted ‘costing’ on his own account, or he 
would have escaped some of the more obvious pitfalls into which 
he has fallen. ‘Take the case of roots; let it be assumed that an 
accurate cost account has been produced and that it shows that 
roots are not profitable.’ If the writer had ever kept a root account 
he would have realized that the element of profit or loss does not 
enter into it. A root account is merely a determination of the cost 
of one of the foods required for live stock. Later, the author refers 
to what he terms the ‘horse-cycle’ and the ‘manure-cycle’ as 
being ‘problems of which the solution is still wanting. . . . Since 
the cost of horse-labour must include a charge for food which the 
horses consume, it is obvious that a guess must be made in ascertain- 
ing the cost of the crop’. In point of fact, the only obvious thing 
is that not only has the author never kept a horse labour account 
but neither has he thought very carefully about the items com- 
posing it. Had he done so, he would have realized that crops 
of this year are produced by the labour of horses fed on the crops 
of last year, and that his ‘horse-cycle’ is rather of the nature of a 
mare’s nest. Similarly, too, with his ‘manure-cycle’. With ele- 
mentary misconceptions of this kind occurring in every paragraph, 
it is not surprising to find the author falling into more excusable 
errors, such as the assertion that if products which might be sold 
are fed to stock on the farm they must be charged at market prices, 
and one can agree cordially with his remark that accounts kept in 
this way ‘become puzzling’. Anonymous criticism of scientific 
work carries little weight, for the value of the opinions expressed 
depends on the status of the critic in relation to the subject with 
which he deals. Regarded as criticism, this particular article is 
worthless, and surprise may be expressed that it should have been 
given publicity in the Board’s Journal. It is of interest, however, 
as bearing witness to a tendency, which is far too common, to 
discredit new lines of investigation and research.)

labour, foods, veterinary service, &c. are distributed on the basis of 
the milk yield. The cows are credited with the value of the milk, 
calves, and manure produced, the figures allotted being proportionate 
to the milk yield also. Thus, a cow giving 4,0001b. milk will be 
credited with twice as much for milk products as a cow giving 
2,000 lb.; and the calf from the 4,000 lb. cow is valued at twice 
as much as that from the 2,000 lb. cow. It is an ingenious system 
of calculation, and it is based on the results of 15 years’ work at the 
Illinois Station, but some of the principles, such as that on which 
calves are valued, seem rather theoretical, and out of accord with 
known facts.)

60. Laur, Ernst. Basis for International Statistics of Agricultural 
Book- keeping. 
(This article, written for the International Institute of Agri- 
culture and appearing in the Monthly Bulletin of Agricultural 
Intelligence and Plant Diseases, in February, 1914, is aimed at the 
setting-up of a common system of book-keeping for the examination 
of the economic conditions of Germany. The writer recognizes that 
the methods based on book-keeping give results much superior to 
those based on inquiry, but he points out that if the results of 
investigations in different places are to be comparable one with 
another they must be collected and elaborated according to the 
same methods. He then proceeds to describe what figures and 
books are necessary in order to calculate the gross and net returns 
on the farm, the farmer’s profit, and so forth. His system amounts 
to what is taught in the country as book-keeping by single entry, 
but Laur is also the principal exponent of what is known as the 
‘synthetic’ system for the determination of the cost of production— 
not as opposed to the analytical, but as being more easily practised. 
He gives a short example of the cost of producing milk, calculated 
in this way. By those familiar with ordinary farm accounts the 
paper will be found to be fairly elementary, and the points on 
which discussion would have been instructive, namely, principles of 
valuation, are left untouched for lack of space, and the reader is 
referred to his great treatise on farm book-keeping. Finally, he 
suggests that if uniformity of principle—not necessarily of practice- 
could be arrived at, the International Institute might act as a 
clearing-house for the agricultural book-keeping of ‘all civilized 
peoples’. The article is well worthy of study, but it loses, in places, 
by having been translated by some one unfamiliar with the English 
equivalents of some of the German terms of accountancy.)

between the relative advantages of milk-selling and calf-raising. 
Allowing that 101b. of milk will produce 1 lb. of live-weight increase, 
he says that the following formula will give the price at which milk 
must be sold to give the same net return as when used for fattening 
calves : 
Utility value of milk 
__ (increase in weight x selling price) + (initial weight x advance) 
10 x increase in weight i   
The term ‘advance’ refers to the difference in price per lb. of live- 
weight between a fat and a store calf. Other formulae for milk 
versus beef, &c., are given. He also suggests the determination of 
the cost of production by the synthetic method devised by him, as 
a basis for organization.)

agricultural products, with a description of the methods by which 
they can be effected. The principles of valuation are discussed and 
contrasted, the writer endeavouring to show that in valuations on 
the farm, both of stock and of crops, the farmer should use the cost 
price, and that he should not confuse the issue by the introduction 
of market prices. It is maintained that this is the key-note of all 
determinations of costs on the farm, and the general acceptance of 
this principle is an essential preliminary to co-ordinated research

then goes on to consider the cost of production of milk on a large

one particular product, but a good deal of Sedlmayr’s argument 
loses point by the fact that he appears to confuse the cost of certain 
operations with their economical effect. The latter may be nil, but 
that will not justify the omission of the former from a cost-of-pro- 
duction calculation ; vice versa, the economic effects may be valuable 
out of proportion to the cost, but the-cost must be the figure used, 
and not an estimate of value. Similarly, Sedlmayr objects that it 
cannot be correct to value home-grown produce consumed by stock 
at the cost of growing it where there is an open market for it at 
a higher price. This is a flat contradiction of his opening formula: 
‘Aufwand = Produktionskosten’ (Expenses = Cost of Production), 
for the expense of home-grown foods in, say, the production of milk 
is the cost of growing them, not the value of them to another 
consumer. In spite of his criticism of analytical book-keeping for 
the determination of the cost of any product, Sedlmayr admits and 
even emphasizes the importance of it for certain purposes, such as 
the comparison of the costs of similar crops. Such results though 
not, as he thinks, intrinsically trustworthy, are comparable one with 
another, because they are influenced by the same degree of error. 
He also recognizes that the mere translation into figures of the 
whole complex process of production may often bring important 
facts to light.)

(A most valuable record of the cost of producing crops on an 
estate in the east of England, where careful field accounts have 
been kept. The results cover the period 1894-1911, and ‘some 
striking results are shown which contradict the fashionable theory 
of writers on agriculture that corn-growing is unprofitable’. In 
1894, when wheat touched the lowest price known in this country, 
namely 22s. 10d., and actually sold in some markets at 17s. 6d., 
Mr. Strutt was able to make a profit of £1 18s. per acre, or say 10s. 
per quarter, and over the whole eighteen-year period his average 
profit per acre on over 4,000 acres was £2 18s. 8d., or say 15s. per 
quarter. Seeing that rent remains very much what it was in 1911, 
and that wages and manures, although very much higher in 1914-15, 
have certainly not increased by 50 per cent., it follows that the 
present prices of wheat must be very satisfactory to the farmer. 
The figures include the financial results during the same period of

(The writer of this article presents a clear and convincing state- 
ment of the case for making farm valuations on the basis of the cost 
of production. It is all the more curious, therefore, that he should 
depart from this principle in the case of certain classes of live stock, 
and that he should substitute for it a ‘standard value basis’. This 
is neither the cost price nor the market price, but some arbitrary 
figure for which there is no substantial foundation. It would 
appear that the writer has accepted the cost principle as the only 
sound one, but that a difficulty in its practical application in a 
particular case has driven him to substitute some other value for it 
rather than to face the difficulty out.)

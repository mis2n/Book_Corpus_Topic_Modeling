  PREFACE 
Origin.—This textbook is the outcome of eighteen years’ ex- 
perience in conducting courses dealing with methods of teaching 
in elementary schools—five years in the State Normal College 
at Oxford, Ohio, and the remainder in the School of Education 
of The University of Chicago. 
A practical volume.—The book contains many examples of 
methods and devices actually used in progressive elementary 
schools for training pupils in various types of learning, such as 
handwriting, spelling, reading, arithmetic, problem-solving, ex- 
pression, enjoyment, etc. These examples of teaching are fre- 
quently so refined in technique as to interest and aid very 
experienced teachers; yet they are described in language simple 
enough for the inexperienced normal-school or college student 
to comprehend and appreciate. : 
Supported by scientific evidence.—In addition to this abun- 
dant practical material, the book contains much of the scientific 
evidence that has been developed to justify and interpret the 
progressive methods set forth. Thus it joins practical technique 
and scientific evidence—the only safe combination for organ- 
izing and propagating valid improved methods of teaching. 
Scientific indebtedness.—The author is greatly indebted to 
his early studies under Professors C. H. Judd, E. L. Thorndike, 
and John Dewey, and to years of reading of the works of 
William James, for many of the general points of view and 
specific doctrines found in the text. He has been aided also 
by frequent discussions with his colleagues in the School of 
Education,

  viii TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
From the scientific monograph literature, such as the Year- 
books of the National Society for the Study of Education, 
considerable help has been obtained on special problems. 
Practical indebtedness.—From the teaching in the Elemen- 
tary School of The University of Chicago, much of the prac- 
tical material in the text has been derived. Sometimes large 
sections of a chapter have been written around observations of 
skilled teachers in this school. In the body of the text I have 
everywhere tried to assign appropriate credit to the particular 
teacher whose skilled technique is being described. Another 
generous source from which I have derived practical examples is 
the teaching described by some of the experienced teachers in 
my summer classes. To all these codperating contributors I am 
very grateful for the help rendered. 
Illustrations.—Photographs and other materials for pictures 
have been kindly furnished by many persons. In this connec- 
tion I am especially indebted to Principal Harry O. Gillet, of 
the University of Chicago Elementary School, for numerous 
excellent photographs of its activities which were taken in 1916, 
when the university celebrated its twenty-fifth anniversary. 
Relation to the author's “General Methods.”—This volume 
supplements the author’s “General Methods of Teaching in 
Elementary Schools,’ published in 1919. Together the two 
volumes cover most of the phases of elementary school-teaching 
commonly discussed in courses on methods of teaching. There 
are, however, certain general principles of organizing instruc- 
tion which have been omitted and which I may find time to 
discuss at some future date.

  KEY TO BIBLIOGRAPHICAL REFERENCES 
The books from which quotations are made in the text are in- 
cluded in the bibliographies which are printed at the ends of the 
chapters. The source of each quotation is indicated (usually at its 
end) by two figures in parenthesis. The first figure refers to the 
book by its number in the bibliography at the end of the chapter, 
and the second figure refers to the page. Thus, (4: 76) means 
page 76 in the fourth book in the chapter bibliography. This system 
has been adopted in order that the instructor or student may verify 
or follow up any quotation without the ordinary reader’s being dis- 
tracted by numerous footnote references which are unimportant in 
his reading.

  TYPES OF ELEMENTARY 
TEACHING AND LEARNING 
CHAPTER I 
INTRODUCING THE VARIED TYPES OF TEACHING AND 
LEARNING 
Practical technique plus scientific evidence.—This book is 
designed to assist teachers in directing the various types of 
learning that pupils carry on in elementary schools. Hence it 
contains many practical examples of actual teaching described 
in detail. In most cases the scientific evidence justifying these 
practices is also presented. 
Familiar and unfamiliar types.—Some of the types of 
teaching and learning discussed here are familiaf to every 
beginning teacher, while others may be comparatively strange 
to those who have not thought much about recent improvements 
in teaching. Among the more familiar types are learning 
handwriting, spelling, beginning reading, and arithmetical 
calculation. The less familiar types include learning to under- 
stand social life and learning to be skillful in problem-solving, 
in silent reading, and in communicating ideas to an audience. 
Another unfamiliar type is learning how to increase the harmless 
enjoyment of leisure. Finally, learning to behave morally is 
familiar to many persons in its religious aspects but compar- 
atively unfamiliar in the civic aspects which our public schools 
are now called upon to emphasize. 
Contrasting types. Romance versus science.—Betweer 
some of these types of teaching and learning there are such 
great contrasts that a teacher may be quite strong and efficient 
and sympathetic in one of them, and at the same time be weak 
I
-P-A-G-E-18
  2 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
and inefficient and unsympathetic in another. Perhaps the best 
example of such a contrast is found in the antagonism between 
the artistic type of temperament, which is important in the 
harmless enjoyment of literature, and the cold-blooded, scientific ~ 
type, which is strong in problem-solving. Frequently poets with 
extremely esthetic temperaments have rebelled against the sci- 
entific thinkers and expressed their antagonism in very strong 
language, as evidenced in the following stanzas by Poe, in the 
first of which he expresses his love for romance, for the con- 
templative play of the artist, while in the other he scolds the 
scientist. If you are not fond of poetry, try reading these verses 
aloud to get their effect, remembering that “romance” is ac- 
cented on the second syllable (ro mance’) and that “paroquet” 
may be pronounced par’o kay for riming purposes. 
ROMANCE 
Romance, who loves to nod and sing, 
With drowsy head and folded wing, 
Among the green leaves as they shake 
Far down within some shadowy lake, 
To me a painted paroquet 
Hath been—a most familiar bird— 
Taught me my alphabet to say— 
To lisp my very earliest word 
While in the wildwood I did lie, 
A child—with a. most knowing eye. 
SONNET—TO SCIENCE 
Science! true daughter of Old Time thou art! 
Who alterest all things with thy peering eyes. 
Why preyest thou thus upon the poet’s heart, 
Vulture, whose wings are dull realities? 
How should he love thee? or how deein thee wise, 
Who wouldst not leave him in his wandering 
To seek for treasure in the jewelled skies, 
Albeit he soared with an undaunted wing?
-P-A-G-E-19
  INTRODUCING THE VARIED TYPES 3 
Hast thou not dragged Diana from her car? 
And driven the Hamadryad from the wood 
To seek a shelter in some happier star? 
Hast thou not torn the Naiad from her flood, 
The Elfin from the green grass, and from me 
The summer dream beneath the tamarind tree? 
Measure your own sympathies.—Perhaps you have known 
among your own teachers some who have been narrowly zsthetic 
or narrowly scientific. It would be instructive to measure even 
yourself in this regard. You might begin by noting with whom 
you sympathize in the following poem—the logician or the poet. 
Remember to read it aloud or at least to enunciate each syllable 
fully to yourself. 
TO A LOGICIAN 
By Dana Burnet 
Cold man, in whom no animating ray 
Warms the chill substance of the sculptor’s clay; 
Grim Reasoner, with problems in your eyes, 
Professor, Sage—however do they call you? 
Far-seeing Blindman, fame shall yet befall you; 
Carve you in stone—that winter of the wise !— 
And set you up in some pale portico 
To frown on heaven above, on earth below. 
I shall make songs and give them to the breeze, 
And die amid a thousand ecstasies ! 
I shall be dust, and feel the joyous sting 
Of that sweet arrow from the bow of Time 
Which men call Spring. 
And out of my dead mouth a rose shall come like rime! 
But you, in your eternal state of snows, 
Shall thrill no more to life’s resurgent flood, 
Nor cast death’s laughter into April’s rose! 
You shall be marble, who were never blood.t

    4 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
Moral types symbolized by Moses and Lincoln.—Another 
well-defined type of teacher whose sympathies lie strongly 
with one of our types of learning is the great moral leader. 
In the pictures which we have reproduced on pages 4 to 6, if

PROBLEM-SOLVING TYPIFIED BY RODIN’S 
FAMOUS STATUE “THE THINKER” 
Do you suppose his knotted muscles suggest that 
he is wrestling with a knotty problem? Rodin’s“* The Thinker” 
may be said to sym- 
bolize problem-solving, 
and the “ Reading from 
Homer” to symbolize 
harmless enjoyment, 
then the picture of 
Moses with the tables 
of stone may be said 
to symbolize moral be- 
havior in its religious 
aspects, while Lincoln 
and his Gettysburg Ad- 
dress symbolize moral 
behavior in its highest 
civic aspects. Through- 
out the ages such great 
moral leaders and 
teachers have been 
most highly esteemed. 
Among our everyday 
teachers we occasion- 
ally find those who are 
noted for their effi- 
ciency and service in 
directing the learning of pupils along moral lines. Needless 
to say, all of us should appreciate their work, and should en- 
deavor to develop in ourselves some skill akin to theirs. 
Develop your talents but keep your balance.—If you are 
naturally talented in some type of learning, your teaching in 
this line will probably be more effective and interesting than in
-P-A-G-E-21
  INTRODUCING THE VARIED TYPES 5 
the types of learning in which you are weak. Hence, if you 
have a special talent for reading, or problem-solving, or ex- 
pression, or music, or moral leadership, it is important to de- 
velop this as far as possible in the direction of skilled teaching. 
The same amount of effort spent by you in such a line of talent 
will bring much greater success than in lines in which you are 
  
  HARMLESS ENJOYMENT OF LEISURE TYPIFIED BY “A READING 
FROM HOMER” 
Note the attitudes of leisure and enjoyment 
not talented. On the other hand, unless you are engaged in 
special departmental teaching in which only your special talents 
are needed, you should not neglect the other types of learning, 
which may be just as important in the lives of your pupils and 
in the world at large. For example, if you are naturally an 
effective reasoner but not strong in moral leadership, it does 
not follow that you should countenance cheating in exami- 
nations or fail to have pupils read inspiring moral classics such 
as Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address. One of the greatest lessons 
every teacher needs to learn is so to keep her balance that she  
-P-A-G-E-22
  6 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
gives due emphasis to each of the varied types of learning for 
which her position may make her responsible. 
Read first the chapters that interest you, but neglect none.— 
Similarly, in perusing the chapters that follow, it is probably 
  RELIGIOUS-MORAL SERVICE TYPI- CIVIC-MORAL SERVICE TYPIFIED BY 
FIED BY MICHELANGELO'S “MOSES” — SAINT GAUDENS’S “ LINCOLN” 
Think of the stupendous religious- Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address is recog- 
moral influence of the Ten Command- nized as one of the finest expressions of 
ments throughout the ages democratic ideals and duties 
wise to read first those that interest you, but eventually to 
canvass all, in order to get a balanced view of all the types of 
learning. In choosing chapters that may interest you, if you 
are keen to get early some impressions of fine, artistic teaching, 
of wonderful teachers in action, I would advise you to begin
-P-A-G-E-23
    INTRODUCING THE VARIED TYPES 7 
with Chapter V, on beginning reading, and Chapter X, on 
problem-solving. On the other hand, if you are intent on learn- 
ing about scientific studies of teaching, you might begin with 
Chapters III and IV, on handwriting and spelling. If interested 
in history and community life, begin with Chapter IX, on 
understanding social life. If interested in English, begin with 
Chapter XII, on communicating ideas, and Chapter XIV, on 
harmless enjoyment. If especially interested in teaching read- 
ing, you may read the three chapters (V, VI, and XI) which are 
devoted to discussions of oral and silent reading. 
Perspective view of types of learning.— A perspective 
view of all the types of learning may be derived from the follow- 
ing outline, in which the organization into three main parts makes 
the total arrangement easy to grasp: 
I. Four ELEMENTARY SKILLS 
1. Handwriting. 
2. Spelling. 
3. Beginning reading.

which the author has treated in his ‘General Methods of 
Teaching in Elementary Schools.” A brief summary of the 
latter is contained in the following general principles:
-P-A-G-E-24
8 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
FUNDAMENTAL POINTS OF VIEW 
1. In our interdependent democratic American society the aim of 
public education is to increase the sum total of happiness for the 
multitudes. 
2. To this end the schools train for health, enjoyment of leisure, 
good will, and social service by developing in children appropriate 
information, habits, ideals, and abiding, many-sided interests. 
3. The effective organization of such training involves reproducing 
in schools a prominent feature of our complex social life; namely, 
effective business management for economy in routine affairs. 
4. The selection of the subject matter that is to be used to attain 
the broad social aims of the school should be made from the social 
viewpoint. The material should be clearly adapted to present-day 
needs and conditions, and the relative values of the topics should be 
scientifically determined. 
5. Such scientific determination requires investigations that are 
mathematically precise, objective, verifiable, expert, and impartial. 
6. Progressive textbooks and teachers organize much of the 
selected subject matter around large central topics and begin with 
units that are meaningful to pupils and adapted to their capacities, 
interests, and processes of learning at each age. 
GENERAL ASPECTS OF LEARNING 
1. Each pupil learns through his own responses. Hence what each 
pupil does is the great factor in learning and teaching. 
2. The pupil’s response is greatly influenced by his past experi- 
ence. The teacher must build upon this experience and enrich it. 
3. The pupil’s response is influenced also by his present frame of 
mind. Hence the teacher must arouse in him appropriate lines of 
thought and mental backgrounds and attitudes. 
4. Among the most important of these attitudes are attention and 
interest. Attention to school activities is best secured by utilizing the 
children’s active interests in romance and adventure, animals and 
persons, social approval, rhythm, rime, jingle and song, plays and 
games, problems, constructions, collections, communications, etc. 
5. One of the features of school work that has been most im- 
proved through applying the above principle is drill. It has been
-P-A-G-E-25
  INTRODUCING THE VARIED TYPES 9 
found that ten minutes a day of scientifically organized, snappy, in- 
teresting drills, adapted to the individual needs of pupils, suffices 
to develop the necessary skill in any one of the formal subjects; 
consequently, most of the day is left free for the other kinds of 
learning. 
6. The adaptation of drills to the varied needs of individual pupils 
gives us one of our best examples of the differentiated instruction 
which is necessitated by the great differences in the inborn capaci- 
ties of pupils and in their opportunities for social usefulness. 
7. Pupils who are gifted in practical planning are given special 
opportunities through the project methods that have recently be- 
come popular. 
Wonderful teachers described. Emulate them.—In several 
places in the text you will find descriptions of wonderful 
teachers actually at work. Such experts are so artistic in their 
performances that they deserve to become famous, like notable 
artists in music, the drama, painting, and other arts. If you 
have natural talent for teaching, you may also become an artist 
teacher, particularly through imitation of such model perform- 
ances. You will find the fullest descriptions of such actual 
teaching on the following pages: 77 ff., for the teaching of be- 
ginning reading; 279 ff., for problem-solving; 352 ff., for silent 
reading; 411 ff., for communicating ideas; and 503 ff., for 
moral training. 
  
The frontispiece: a dramatic assembly project.—The dramatic 
scene pictured in the frontispiece illustrates project-teaching, a kind 
of activity that has recently become popular in progressive schools. 
In such teaching the pupils plan, devise, and contrive some practical 
activity,—something to be done. Hence a pupil project is some prac- 
tical pupil activity planned by the pupils. Assembly programs 
planned and prepared by the pupils offer rich opportunities for such 
practical contriving, devising, and scheming. The pupils shown in the 
frontispiece had been studying medieval history in The University of 
Chicago Elementary School. When it came their turn to prepare a 
program for the assembled school, they chose some incident from
-P-A-G-E-26
  10 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
their historical study, planned the actions for a series of scenes, wrote 
the dialogue, made some of the costumes and chose others from the 
school costume box, tried out various children in the acting, chose 
the best ones, rehearsed a few times, and then delighted and in- 
structed the school with their performance. As indicated under the 
frontispiece, such practice is particularly helpful in clarifying and 
vivifying historical ideas. For further examples of the preparation 
of such assembly projects see pages 242, 418. 
In other publications the author has presented a more complete 
discussion of project-teaching as he interprets it; namely, in

and Company, revised edition, 1922), Chapter XII.

  PART I. FOUR ELEMENTARY SKILLS 
CHAPTER II 
INTRODUCTION TO PART I 
Our old friends, the three R’s.—In Part I of the book we 
shall be concerned primarily with the teaching of the three 
R’s (reading, ’riting, and ’rithmetic) and spelling. Since our 
discussion of the teaching of reading is rather long, we have 
broken it into two chapters. Hence, following this introductory 
chapter we shall have five chapters with the following titles: 
Handwriting and Other Motor Skills 
Learning to spell Four Thousand Words 
Beginning Reading 
Scientific Investigations of Reading 
Skill in Arithmetical Calculation 
Automatic skills to be emphasized.—In discussing each of 
these types of learning we shall emphasize the desirability of 
giving the pupil sufficient practice to enable him ‘to carry on 
each process automatically. In the case of handwriting this 
means that the pupil must attain sufficient skill to write legibly 
and rapidly, without his attention’s being distracted from what 
he desires to express. He must finally be able to spell some four 
thousand common words correctly without indecision when he 
uses them in writing letters or compositions. In reading he 
must be able freely to recognize and grasp the meanings of 
simple phrases and sentences, while in arithmetical calculation 
he must add, subtract, multiply, and divide accurately and 
rapidly. Since we are thus interested here primarily in the 
Ir  
-P-A-G-E-28
12 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
  development of automatic skill in these four rather simple and 
elementary types of learning, we have entitled this part of the 
book ‘Four Elementary Skills.” 
A cold scientific plunge.—Owing to the fact that the mate- 
rials and processes are comparatively simple in handwriting, 
spelling, beginning reading, and arithmetical calculation, con- 
siderable progress has been made in scientifically investigating 
methods of learning and teaching these subjects. Consequently 
we shall have numerous occasions in Part I to report some of 
these rather cold-blooded scientific studies of how pupils learn. 
We appreciate the fact that many readers dislike such scientific 
matters, but we hope that they will take the cold scientific 
plunge which the text frequently invites, in order to stimulate 
their scientific circulation and give a healthy scientific tone to 
their thoughts about teaching. 
Pleasant relief in examples of charming technique.—Fre- 
quent relief will be provided for the nonscientific reader, how- 
ever, through accounts of charming examples of actual teaching 
by skillful teachers. The most elaborate description is found. 
in the chapter entitled “ Beginning Reading,” in which we shall 
follow in detail the fascinating experiences of children who 
through artful methods are being introduced to the fairyland 
of children’s books. Even in our most cold-blooded chapter, 
however (namely, the next one—on handwriting), we shall be- 
gin with some picturesque examples of actual teaching, in order 
to invite the reader into the chapter.

  CHAPTER III 
HANDWRITING AND OTHER MOTOR SKILLS 
Main points to orient reader.—In order to give the reader 
a general notion of what is to come, each long chapter is opened 
with a brief statement of its main points. These should merely 
be scanned rapidly at the first reading. 
Main points of the chapter.—1. Actual handwriting lessons de- 
scribed at the beginning of the chapter illustrate such points of tech- 
nique as the following : 
a. Instruction should begin with large blackboard writing. 
6. Nursery rimes and other rhythmic devices aid in developing 
smooth writing and motor control. 
c. Encouraging remarks with good models for imitation aid slow 
pupils. 
2. Ready-made systems give most teachers their technique of 
teaching handwriting. 
3. These systems should be scientifically organized, but frequently 
they are poorly conceived. 
4. Experimental laboratory investigations which show how hand- 
writing movements are made and learned determine the value of cur- 
rent methods and systems. 
5. Such investigations show, for example, that the current methods 
of drilling pupils to make the letters without finger movements are 
fallacious. 
6. Scales for measuring handwriting enable us 
a. To define clearly what quality of handwriting is socially desir- 
able and 
b. To determine how successfully teachers are achieving the stand- 
ard scores desired in each grade. 
7. From such scientific studies of handwriting we are able to de- 
rive a number of general principles of teaching, particularly concern- 
ing the value of scientific research in destroying educational quackery 
and buncombe. 
13 
 
-P-A-G-E-30
  14 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
8. Other examples of motor skill, such as constructive activities 
and gymnastics, may be taught according to such general principles 
as the following : 
a. Give the pupils clear ideas of what to do by clear demonstra- 
tions and simple directions. 
b. Indicate correct form, but do not overemphasize it. 
c. Make corrections positive and specific. 
Simple type of learning discussed in three sections.— 
Acquiring motor skill is one of the simplest types of learning. 
Thus, many feeble-minded children, who find the higher learn- 
ing processes impossible, can become skilled in doing things 
with their hands. Furthermore, scientific studies have helped 
us considerably in understanding this simple type of learning. 
For these reasons the discussion of how to teach the motor 
arts, such as handwriting, construction, and dancing, is easily 
understood and, consequently, has been presented early in the 
text. The chapter has been divided into three sections: 
I. Teaching handwriting (p. 14). 
A. Technique of teaching handwriting (p. 14). 
B. Laboratory experiments upon handwriting (p. 21). 
C. Scales to measure handwriting (p. 30). 
II. General principles of teaching illustrated by the discussion 
of handwriting (p. 40). 
III. Construction, gymnastics, and other forms of motor skill 
(p. 43). 
Section I. TracHinc HANDWRITING 
A. Technique of Teaching 
Examples. First lessons in large blackboard movements. 
—The first steps in the teaching of handwriting in a progressive 
elementary school may be illustrated by the following observa- 
tions in a first grade. 
Blackboard game with nursery rime.—It was the fourth day 
of school in the autumn. Reading lessons were being conducted 
with the nursery rime “Jack, jump over the candlestick.”
-P-A-G-E-31
  HANDWRITING AND OTHER MOTOR SKILLS 15 
The teacher introduced some blackboard practice with chalk 
‘ by telling the children that she knew how to play a game by 
which they could all show Jack jumping over the candlestick. 
She showed them how to represent a candlestick on the 
blackboard with the chalk, as in Fig. 1, 
and then how to show Jack jumping 
back and forth by curved lines, as in 
Fig. 2. The children went to the board FIG. I 
and each drew a candlestick. Then 
they practiced the rhythmic sweeps, aos 
back and forth, while reciting the rime | 
in unison. 
Rhythmic sweeps for “Jack and Jill.” 
—The next day, when another rime Beat 
(namely, “Jack and Jill”) was being 
used, the teacher asked, “Who will ff. SNS 
show us at the blackboard the hill with FIG. 3 
Jack and Jill going up and tumbling 
down, somewhat as we showed Jack ed 
jumping over the candlestick?” The 
first child that volunteered to go to FIG. 4 
the board made a curve like Fig. 3. 
The next child probably had an idea of 
Jack and Jill as going up and down the 
same path, for she made a curve like 
Fig. 4. After some further trials they FIG. § 
agreed on a form like Fig. 5,—up and 
down, up and down,—and all went to their places at the black- 
board and practiced it rhythmically while saying in unison the 
complete rime about Jack and Jill. 
Detailed directions ; individual differences ; imitation.—Some 
of the children succeeded easily in all phases of these activities, 
but others had much-to learn. For example, some did not know 
their right or left hand. The teacher gave them careful direc- 
tions about taking the chalk in the “right hand,” drawing the
-P-A-G-E-32
  16 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
candlestick in the “middle” of the space, beginning at the 
“left,” and then swinging in unison. 
Some produced poor curves or had trouble in swinging to the 
rime. The teacher asked the pupils to watch one member of the 
class who did it very well. In the next trial the poor ones did 
much better. 
Left-handedness given careful attention.—The teacher gave 
special attention to one left-handed boy. He tried to write with 
each hand. She had in mind the necessity of deciding whether to 
make a left-handed or right-handed writer of him, as the scien- 
tific studies of left-handedness indicate the need of care in 
making the decision in the case of each left-handed pupil. 
Principles of teaching illustrated. Motor control, rhythm, 
interest, individual differences, imitation.—These examples illus- 
trate for us the following points in the teaching of handwriting: 
1. Learning to make handwriting movements is closely re- 
lated to the child’s general ability to make and control move- 
ments. As we shall see later, this ability matures and improves 
very greatly as the pupil grows older. 
2. First-grade children have great difficulty in making small, 
finely controlled movements ; hence the first lessons should con- 
sist of large movements at the blackboard. 
3. Rhythm is a very helpful factor in aiding pupils to make 
smooth, nonjerky movements. 
4. Nursery, rimes provide not only simple, well-defined 
rhythms but also interesting games, which arouse and hold the 
pupil’s interest. 
5. Children vary greatly in their natural aptitudes for ac- 
quiring control of hand and arm movements. 
6. Imitating another person’s performance is one of the quick- 
est and most helpful methods of acquiring motor skill; that is, 
skill in making movements. 
Writing words and letters at blackboard. Example of learn- 
ing to write “seed.” —The initial steps in learning to write 
words and letters at the blackboard may be illustrated by the
-P-A-G-E-33
  HANDWRITING AND OTHER MOTOR SKILLS 17 
following observation made in the same first grade during the 
sixth week of school. The children had made some progress 
in movement control by this time and had progressed suffi- 
ciently in reading and word study to be ready to write words. 
During a “word study” period the word “seed” occurred with 
three others in a phonetic drill. The children had learned the 
general form of the word in their reading and through a num- 
ber of drill games, and the teacher introduced them to the more 
detailed knowledge of its written form in the following manner : 
B 
HOW TWO DIFFERENT CHILDREN WROTE THE WORD “SEED” 
She said, ‘Now watch me carefully while I write ‘seed.’” She 
then wrote it several times, while commenting on the ups and 
downs of the strokes. The children then all wrote the word 
in the air as they watched each stroke of the teacher at the 
blackboard. They were very attentive and interested. Finally, 
the teacher asked them to take a good look at the word and 
then to close their eyes and try to see it. This done, each child 
found his place at the board where his name had been written 
by the teacher, and tried to write “seed.” Two thirds of the 
pupils were quite successful. Others, however, had great diffi- 
culties. One little girl in particular, whom I had noted before 
as one of the most successful in the reading, could hardly get 
started. She made the s all right, then hesitated for some 
time, and finally wrote as in A. The teacher, who had been 
giving the slow pupils much individual attention, tactfully said 
to this child, ‘‘That’s very good; but let’s try to write it from
-P-A-G-E-34
  18 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
left to right, like this,” and wrote a model for the child which 
the latter copied with fair facility. Later, when the children all 
erased their work and ran to their seats, this child’s lack of motor 
skill or motor ability again exhibited itself, as she took much 
longer to erase her writing and made many random, wasteful 
sweeps with the eraser. 
Another naturally clumsy child, a boy whom I had noted 
for his awkwardness during a reading lesson, had clear ideas 
of the forms of the letters and produced a fairly legible word, 
but each stroke was made up of a series of jerks as in B. 
Further principles. Meaningful content, recalling forms, 
drawing-stage, encouragement.—This observation adds to our 
general facts about beginning handwriting the following points : 
1. The first real writing should consist of significant, familiar, 
easy words from the child’s reading vocabulary. 
2. Some children have great difficulty in recalling the correct 
form of the word or the letters. 
3. Others have great difficulty in making letters smoothly, 
their writing consisting really of drawing each letter laboriously 
by means of a series of jerks. 
4. Encouraging remarks with good models for imitation 
should be used to aid the unskillful pupils instead of using 
severe, discouraging criticism. 
Delayed maturing of motor control delays fine formal drills. 
—The third point gives us the cue for much of the early practice 
in handwriting, for, before the children have matured or aged to 
the point where they can make their movements more smoothly, 
much of the fine formal handwriting drill is a waste of time. 
Final example. Arm-sweep drills on paper from ready-made 
handwriting system.—We may illustrate the nature of some of 
the later training by two further examples, which are quoted 
from some lessons which Professor F. N. Freeman and his 
collaborator, Miss Mary L. Daugherty, devised for use in some 
experimental investigations of handwriting. In his description 
of the experiments Freeman says:
-P-A-G-E-35
  HANDWRITING AND OTHER MOTOR SKILLS 19 
A manual of directions was prepared which gives exact instruc- 
tions in regard to the conduct of the course. Position of body, hand, 
arm, pen, and paper are first considered. Precision in giving the 
order to write is emphasized, as-definiteness and regularity help in 
acquiring the habit of rhythm. The size of writing for each grade 
is prescribed and illustrated by copies which are introduced in the 
text. In Grades I and II blackboard work is emphasized as desir- 
able. An effort is made to have speed and quality progress together. 
LESSON I, GRADES II-IV 
A short talk something like the following will be a good way to 
begin the course. It should be suited to the class. 
“We all want to learn to write well, so that when we write letters 
or stories our friends can read them. We can write well and make 
hard work of it, or we can write easily and well. I am going to try 
to show you how to write so that it will be easy, and then you will 
be glad to do it. First we must sit right. Sit straight, hips back in 
seat, feet on the floor.” (See that all are doing so.) ‘Put paper in 
place at an angle of 30 degrees to the desk line. Put both arms 
on the desk and let them rest there easily. Make ‘runners’ of your 
two little fingers. Let them carry the whole hand, sliding back and 
forth on the paper (no pencil in hand). Go clear across the paper. 
Do it asI count: 1,2; 1,2; 1,2; 1,2. Again: 1,2” (etc.). “Can you 
keep just with my count? Are you sliding on your runners? Is your 
wrist raised just a little so as to form a bridge? Now again: 1, 2” 
(etc., four times). ‘Take pencil; hold it so.” (Show correct posi- 
tion; be sure index finger is on top of pencil, not on left side, and 
that thumb is higher on pencil—farther from the point—than the 
index finger. See that every child’s position is correct the first time 
and every time. It will take less time after a while, and less on the 
whole, if insisted on the first time and every time. Place each pencil 
right, where it is necessary. Above all things, do not be impatient 
with the child who does not get the position right. They all want to.) 
‘Now can you use your runners with the pencil? Try, as I count 
—clear across the paper, but do not write yet. Ready. Slide— 
4,27" (etc): 
“Now I will show you something to write.” (Say, as you make it 
hi pee ac “To and fro sway the trees, 
Bending in the passing breeze.”)
-P-A-G-E-36
  
  20 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
“Now you may do it just as I did.” (Repeat verses as they write.) 
(See Exercise 1, below.) ‘You may say it as you write. Again.” 
(This is sufficient for the first exercise; if there is more time vary 
the exercise by letting part of the class do it at the board while 
the others do it at their seats.)

your pencils. Is your position like this?” (Be sure that it is.) 
“Now slide, but don’t write. Ready. Slide—tr, 2” (etc.). “Look.” 
(On board write Exercise 1, saying the verse.) ‘You may write it. 
Ready. Write. ‘To and fro’” (etc.), “Did you keep the time?

Once more: ‘To and fro’” (etc.). “Did you keep the time? Once 
more: ‘To and fro’” (etc.). “Now we have made the tree tops. 
Do you like to swing clear up to the tree tops among the leaves? 
Look, I am going to swing way up.” (While making the curve of 
Exercise 2, say, 
“How do you like to go up in a swing, 
Up in the air so blue ?”) 
“Make the tree tops again. Are your runners ready? Is your pencil 
right? Are you holding it loosely?” (Test a few of the pupils by 
pulling it out from their fingers.) “Ready. Write. ‘To and fro’” 
(etc.). ‘Now let’s swing up to the tree tops. ‘How do you like to 
go up in a swing?’” (etc.). (2: 133) 
Teachers should use scientifically constructed ready-made 
systems.—It is from such directions as the above that most 
of the readers of this book will secure their best methods of 
teaching handwriting lessons, since the subject has been so 
highly organized in ready-made, commercialized handwriting 
systems, with their manuals of practice telling exactly how to 
conduct the various lessons. Such ready-made systems aid 
teachers enormously in easily teaching any subject efficiently 
and economically, provided the system is organized according 
to true scientific principles of teaching. Unfortunately the sys- 
tems that are most widely used are sometimes most poorly and 
unscientifically conceived. This is notably true concerning cer- 
tain recent handwriting systems that have wasted millions of 
hours of practice in an endeavor to get pupils to form the letters 
with an arm movement instead of making them largely in the 
most natural and economical way with the wonderfully flexible 
finger movements. 
B. Laboratory Experiments upon Handwriting 
1, How handwriting movements are made. Experiments 
determine the part played by finger and arm movements.—It 
seems so obvious that ordinary small letters one eighth of an 
inch high may well be made with finger movements, that it  
-P-A-G-E-38
  22 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
appears absurd that educators should ever advocate exclusive 
arm movements for this purpose. Yet extensive scientific in- 
vestigations were necessary to prove that in much skilled 
handwriting the letters are actually made predominantly with 
the fingers, while the arm movement is used largely to secure 
free, smooth progress across the page. We shall sketch briefly 
the history of these scientific laboratory studies of handwriting 
movements. 
Judd-tracer exper- 
iments indicate the 
part performed by 
finger movements.— 
About 1900 Profes- 
sor C. H. Judd de- 
vised the simple

rangement shown in 
the picture on this

The pencil D, D will omit the finger-movement layed b finger 
element in the total handwriting movement play y 8 
  movements during 
handwriting. When this “Judd tracer” is clamped on the side 
of the hand of a person who is writing, it will trace the part of 
the movement contributed by the moving arm or hand but will 
not be affected by the finger movements. If the letters are 
written by arm movements instead of finger movements, the 
tracer should write the word the same as does the pencil held 
in the fingers. Judd summed up his conclusions, based on an 
analysis of many tracer records, as follows: 
In ordinary writing, the fine formative movements are executed 
by the fingers; the movements which carry the fingers forward are 
executed by the hand or arm; and the pauses between groups of let- 
ters are utilized for longer forward arm movements which bring the 
hand [again] into an easy working position. (9: 177)  
-P-A-G-E-39
    HANDWRITING AND OTHER MOTOR SKILLS 23 
Tracer and motion-picture experiments verify early sugges- 
tions.—Judd’s early investigations with the tracer clearly sug- 
gested the fallacy of the arm-movement theory of making letters, 
and later investigations by some of his coworkers in The Uni- 
versity of Chicago have served to prove the point. These in- 
vestigations were carried on about 1917 under the direction 
of Professor F. N. Freeman and included (1) tests of many 
school children with a delicate, modified form of the Judd tracer, 
and (2) elaborate moving-picture photographs of the hand move- 
ments of many writers, from unskilled children to the most 
expert penmen. 
Tracer shows that school children trained in arm movements 
use finger movements to make letters.—The tracer records 
showing the arm movements of school children were secured by 
one of Freeman’s students, H. W. Nutt. In order to grade or 
score these records accurately the latter devised the scale shown 
on page 24. If a child wrote the word “bravely” entirely by 
arm movements, the tracer record should reproduce the word as 
shown in number 5 in the scale. On the other hand, if the let- 
ters were made entirely by finger movements the tracer record 
would be almost a straight line, as shown in number o in the 
scale. Similarly, number 4 indicates a considerable amount of 
arm movement in making the letters, while number 1 indicates 
a very small amount. Nutt secured his records from several 
school systems. In four of the schools one of the best-known 
systems of arm-movement writing had been in use for years, 
while in other schools other methods were used. Among the 
striking conclusions from his investigation are the following: 
In the first place, the amount of arm movement which obtained in 
any of the systems, even in the later ages, is relatively small. Arm- 
movement grades 1 and 2 include the large majority of even the 
fourteen-year-old pupils, in spite of the fact that most of these pupils 
have been trained in the use of the arm movement directly. The em- 
ployment of a considerable degree of arm movement, then, may be 
regarded as a highly skilled art. The same conclusion is to be drawn
-P-A-G-E-40
  24 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
from the marked correlation which is exhibited between arm move- 
ment and age. In ages 7 and 8 a considerable proportion of the chil- 
dren use no arm movement whatever, and practically none use the 
  
oe es NUTT’S SCALE FOR SCORING ARM-MOVEMENT RECORDS FROM THE 
JUDD TRACER   
higher degrees. In the advanced ages (from 12 to 14) scarcely any 
write solely with the fingers, and a fair number use the higher de- 
grees of arm movement. These facts do not give any encouragement 
to the view that the large majority of children can be trained in
-P-A-G-E-41
  
  HANDWRITING AND OTHER MOTOR SKILLS 25 
exclusive arm-movement writing. They indi- 
cate, further, that if we do stress arm move- 
ment we should do so from the ages of 9 
or 10 on. 
That exclusive arm movement, or a consid- 
erable degree of arm movement, is not of first 
importance is indicated by the fact that the 
pupils who make high grades in quality do not 
use a large amount of arm movement more 
commonly than do poor writers. (2: 123) 
Motion-picture records show that even 
expert penmen use finger movements in 
letter formation—In the more elaborate 
motion-picture investigation Freeman pho- 
tographed a writer’s hand at work as shown 
in the film reproduced in the accompanying 
picture. After securing the pictures they 
were projected on the screen, where they 
could be studied and restudied and a variety 
of devices used to determine just what part 
finger movements and arm movements 
played in the writing. Fifty children and 
adults were photographed and their records 
carefully studied. The group included some 
expert penmen, some poor adult writers, 
some children who wrote well, and other 
children who wrote poorly. Some of the 
children had been trained in one of the 
well-known arm-movement systems, while 
others had been given only ordinary in- 
struction or merely incidental training by 
their individual teachers. Concerning the 
movements used in producing letters, Free- 
man’s conclusions from these elaborate 
photographic studies read as follows:   i a |

[1] The movements by which the letters are produced may be 
classified into those of the whole arm, of the hand as a whole, of the 
wrist joint, and of the fingers. 
[2] None of the classes of writers who were examined wrote with- 
out finger movement and all classes used about the same percentage ; 
that is, good writers used as much finger movement as poor writers, 
and those who had been trained in the use of the arm movement 
particularly used as much finger movement as did the pupils who had 
not been so trained. 
[3] The writers who had been trained in the use of the arm move- 
ment used somewhat less hand movement and therefore more arm 
movement than did those who had not been so trained. 
[4] The child cannot acquire the arm movement, even though it 
is made a direct object of drill, until he has acquired a certain 
amount of maturity and skill. 
[5] A moderate degree of arm movement, however, will follow 
from [such experimental drills as were organized in the present study]. 
This drill did not have as its direct purpose the development of arm 
movement, and nothing was said about the movement of the arm in 
the course. The exercises which had for their purpose the develop- 
ment of freedom and fluency of movement, however, resulted in the 
acquirement of a certain degree of movement of the arm. 
[6] Contrary to the prevailing opinion a close relation was not 
found to exist between the degree of arm movement and either the 
speed or the form of the writing. 
[7] Such degree of arm movement as is profitable may readily be 
developed as a by-product of the type of training which has for its 
purpose the development of fluent and easy sideward movement of 
the hand across the page, and does not require the great emphasis 
which is put upon it by modern systems of penmanship. (2: 17) 
2. How handwriting movements are learned. Adult 
learners pay attention not to movement but to results.—An- 
other phase of Judd’s early investigations of handwriting proc- 
esses was an effort to find out how a person Jearns to write. As 
an initial study he suggested to ten school-teachers that they 
try to change the slant of their writing and report to him how 
they did it. Concerning these reports he says:
-P-A-G-E-43
  
  HANDWRITING AND OTHER MOTOR SKILLS 27 
There is not a single case among the early records of the ten 
adults in which reference of any kind is made to any form of move- 
ment. All the devices mentioned [for improvement] emphasize the 
visual guides as the ones consciously employed. All found it possible 
to improve the slope of the letters by constant attention. (9: 184) 
There was no distinct and clear recognition of the position aimed 
at, nor of the superiority of one kind of movement over any other.

PROJECTING A MOTION-PICTURE FILM, ONE EXPOSURE AT A TIME, AND 
DRAWING SAME 
Frequently in the drawings, one exposure was sketched on top of another in 
order to measure just how much each finger had moved in a fraction of a second 
There was merely an effort to reach a certain end of production, and 
in order to reach this end the hand had to be in an easy position, 
and it was moved until brought into this easy position. . . . (9: 186) 
The position of the hand was never clearly recognized in terms of 
its own movements. . . . Movements were not subjects of direct 
attention. . . . Writing, which is essentially a codrdinated move- 
ment, has to be developed through trial after trial, with conscious- 
ness directed not upon the movement itself but on the visual images 
which appear as results of the movement. (9: 187) 
Systematic description from all experiments.—In later years 
Judd and Freeman extended and elaborated these investigations 
in many ways, the most notable example being the motion- 
 
-P-A-G-E-44
  
28 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
picture study described above. Some of the outstanding conclu- 
sions from all such studies of how children and adults learn 
handwriting are the following: 
1. Diffuse movement.—The child who is learning to write at 
a desk makes many useless, diffuse, and strained movements. 
He may grip the pencil too hard, pucker his lips, tie his legs 
in a knot, and make many false starts with his pencil. 
2. Try-try-again method.—By trying time and again, some 
trials prove successful and others not. The useless movements 
gradually drop out, and the successful ones tend to be repeated 
and become habitual. 
3. Little thought to the movements.—The child gives very 
little thought to the movements he is making. He lets these take 
care of themselves and concentrates his attention on producing 
satisfactory writing. 
4. Control improves with age.—As the child grows older, fine 
control of movements becomes easier and easier. Premature drill 
is consequently a waste of time. 
5. Interested imitation of good models.—After the age of 
ten most children can easily acquire sufficient skill in hand- 
writing by merely following simple directions, practicing in 
imitation of good models, and being interested in improving 
until they attain certain standard scores which will be described 
later in the chapter. 
6. Details of technique summarized in yearbook.—The de- 
tailed scientific conclusions concerning the teaching of handwrit- 
ing are summarized by Freeman in twenty-eight rules printed in 
the Eighteenth Yearbook of the National Society for the Study 
of Education, Part II, 1919. (7.) Among these rules are the 
following : 
Nine rules concern the position of the pupil and the paper. For 
example, he should face the desk squarely, with both forearms on it 
for three quarters of their length. The paper should be directly in 
front and tilted to the left until the lower edge makes an angle of 
30 degrees with the edge of the desk, etc.
-P-A-G-E-45
    HANDWRITING AND OTHER MOTOR SKILLS 29 
Four rules concern movement. For example, the latter should be 
a combination of the movement of the arms and the fingers. Partic- 
ularly in the early grades it should be divided into a series of move- 
ments, separated by slight pauses. 
Four rules concern the influence of age. For example, the speed 
of writing should be low at the beginning and should gradually in- 
crease from about thirty letters per minute at the end of Grade II to 
about seventy-three letters per minute at the end of Grade VIII. The 
first-grade child should write on the blackboard, or on unglazed 
paper with a pencil having soft lead. The use of pen and ink may 
be begun in the third grade. Insistence upon position or type of 
movement should first become strict about Grade IV. 
Eleven rules concern methods and devices. For example, pupils 
should maintain a balance between attainments in form and in speed, 
so as not to develop one quality at the expense cf the other. Drill 
exercises which require sweeping side-to-side movements develop 
fluency in the use of the arm in carrying the hand forward continu- 
ously while the letters are being formed. Counting is a useful tem- 
porary device to lead the pupils to organize the movements into units.

Review of Section I to this point. A. Actual lessons. 
B. Experimentation.—Up to this point in our discussion of 
handwriting we have considered the following material : 
A. Descriptions of actual lessons which gave us some notions 
of the technique of teaching handwriting. These descriptions 
culminated on page 21 with a statement that most teachers 
would derive their technique from the teachers’ manuals of com- 
mercialized handwriting systems. Our statement that these sys- 
tems should be scientifically constructed led us to our second 
body of material; namely, 
B. Descriptions of scientific laboratory experiments which 
have been conducted in order to ascertain (1) how handwriting 
movements are made and (2) how handwriting is learned most 
economically and effectively. 
We shall now turn to a third phase of the discussion ; namely, 
the development of scales for measuring the handwriting achieve- 
ments of pupils and classes.
-P-A-G-E-46
  30 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
C. Scales to measure Handwriting 
Simple subject matter made invention easy.— Because of 
the simplicity and very restricted nature of the subject matter 
of handwriting, it was the first subject in which great and 
satisfactory progress was made in devising scales to measure 
and grade it. Probably most readers of this book are famil- 
iar with the well-known Ayres Handwriting Scale, portions of 
which are reproduced on page 32. By using such a scale it 
is possible to make our aims in teaching handwriting much 
more definite than they were before the scales were invented. 
Scale used to define social needs in handwriting. Only 
moderate skill (60 to 70 on the Ayres scale) needed.—For ex- 
ample, through the use of such scales we now know that if 
an eighth-grade pupil can write as well as sample 60, shown 
on page 32, and with fair speed, he has attained a standard that 
is satisfactory for most practical social purposes and he need 
not be given further drill in handwriting. This definite social 
aim or standard of attainment in handwriting was ascertained 
about 1917 by L. V. Koos, who graded, by means of the Ayres 
scale, specimens of writing from some 2000 adults in various 
walks of life. He also had 826 persons indicate the grade of 
writing which they considered “adequate” for general social 
purposes. His conclusions from all these data are summarized 
in the following quotation: 
From the facts that have been presented touching the ability in 
handwriting of persons engaged in various occupations, it seems to 
the writer that the quality 60 on the Ayres Measuring Scale for 
Adult Handwriting, which we have set up as the ultimate standard 
of attainment for all school children for purely social purposes, is 
adequate for the needs of most vocations. This will apply to labor, 
skilled and unskilled, as well as to the professions, exclusive of teach- 
ing in the elementary schools. For that large group who will go into 
commercial work, for telegraphers, and for teachers in the elemen- 
tary schools it will be necessary to insist upon the attainment of a 
somewhat higher quality, but hardly in excess of the quality 70, The
-P-A-G-E-47
  HANDWRITING AND OTHER MOTOR SKILLS 31 
fact that some will go into pursuits demanding a quality better than 
60 should not be offered as a justification for requiring all pupils to 
attain that better quality. Such a requirement would entail the waste 
of a vast amount of time on the part of both teachers and pupils. 
Who shall be taught this better quality is a problem of educational 
and vocational guidance. Since all should be required to learn to 
write as well as 60 on the scale for the purely social uses, to train 
pupils to write this quality is the task of general education; to teach 
some who are going into commercial or other vocations requiring a 
higher quality of handwriting to write this better quality is the task 
not of general but of vocational education. Many high-school com- 
mercial departments have long since recognized this distinction by 
giving special training in handwriting to those enrolled in their work. 
(7: 441) 
No longer necessary to strive for perfect handwriting.—Thus 
the handwriting scales, by enabling us to define precisely the 
standard of handwriting which we should endeavor to attain in 
each elementary-school graduate, justify us in discarding the old 
custom of merely practicing and practicing in the vain hope of 
attaining perfect handwriting as represented in the samples in 
the copy book. 
Scales permit definite standards for each grade. Teacher 
can easily judge her teaching.—Furthermore, the handwriting 
scales simplify our task of teaching by telling us what standard 
ought to be attained by each grade in an elementary school. 
For example, on the bottom of the Ayres scale (Gettysburg 
edition of 1917) we find such information as the following: 
In American elementary schools the second-grade pupils aver- 
age quality 38 on this scale; fifth-grade pupils average 50; 
seventh-grade pupils average 58. (The complete information is 
shown in the graph on page 34.) The rise of the curve repre- 
sents the steady improvement through the grades of American 
elementary schools in the average quality of the handwriting. 
To ascertain the precise quality which any grade should 
attain, according to these standards, a teacher should first 
locate the Roman numeral which indicates that grade on the

GRADE STANDARDS FOR PUPILS’ HANDWRITING graph which we 
Ascertained from many school systems by grading thou- have been study- 
sands of papers with the Ayres scale. The rate is in . | 1 h 
letters per minute ing; namely, the 
speed. The graph 
shows that in the third grade the children average 44 letters 
per minute; in the fifth grade, 64 letters per minute; etc. 
These figures are ascertained from the graph by locating on the 
curved line the Roman numeral designating the grade and then 
moving horizontally to the left to the vertical axis, where the 
speed standards are printed. 
Discovering grade standards. By widespread testing of 
achievements of American schools.—Standard scores similar to 
those which we find represented thus conveniently on the Ayres 
scale were determined by Freeman, about 1915, in connection 
with the work of a national committee which was investigating 
 
-P-A-G-E-51
  HANDWRITING AND OTHER MOTOR SKILLS 35 
methods of economizing time in elementary schools. Their 
program for the above year consisted in determining the mini- 
mum essentials which pupils should learn in the fundamental 
subjects in the elementary schools. Freeman had charge of 
the investigations in handwriting. He determined the stand- 
ards to be attained by the various grades in the elementary 
school by giving handwriting tests in the grades of 56 repre- 
sentative school systems of the country. The papers of the 
34,000 children who were tested were scored for quality and 
speed by competent judges. From these scores were determined 
the averages or medians which should be attained by any elemen- 
tary school that is ambitious to equal the average performance 
in American cities. 
Attaining the standards. Often handwriting teaching ac- 
tually meets social needs.—It will be noted that the quality 
standard for the eighth grade as shown on the graph on page 34 
is 62 on the Ayres scale. This equals the business or social 
standard described on pages 30-31. Hence we may conclude 
that American elementary schools on the average are attaining as 
good results in handwriting as are needed in social life. This is 
one of the few subjects in which this is the case—in most sub- 
jects the teaching must be very greatly expanded and improved 
in order to attain the social perfection which is desirable, as we 
shall see in later chapters. 
Some cities fail in teaching handwriting and other tool sub- 
jects. The Gary example.—Moreover, even in the case of 
handwriting, many American schools rank below the average 
standards which Freeman ascertained. A very notable case of 
this sort was found in the survey of the schools of Gary, Indiana. 
The Gary schools had been advertised very widely through- 
out the country in connection with a number of radical innova- 
tions whch they instituted. These included changes in the types 
of buildings used and in the daily program and other matters. 
The general impression of educators who visited the schools was 
that while these changes might be desirable in themselves, the  
-P-A-G-E-52
  36 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
teaching was very poorly organized and supervised. This opinion 
remained, however, a matter of merely personal impression until 
the General Education Board, upon invitation of the Gary au- 
thorities, conducted a survey of the schools, and published the 
report in 1919. The achievements of the pupils in handwriting, 
spelling, arithmetic, composition, and reading were tested by 
S. A. Courtis, a well-known expert investigator. 
In some of these subjects the objective tests showed great 
inferiority in the Gary teaching, as summarized by Courtis in 
the following words: 
The general conclusion of the author is that the product of class- 
room teaching of the fundamentals is at Gary poor in quality and 
inadequate in amount; it approximates in character the product of 
the poorer conventional schools and reveals in no particular the 
slightest indication that it has been affected either favorably or un- 
favorably by the enriched curriculum or other special features of 
the Gary schools. The progress from grade to grade is relatively 
small, the final levels of achievement reached are comparatively 
low. . . . The entire investigation reveals many and consistent evi- 
dences of careless work, imperfectly developed habits, and marked 
lack of achievement. (8: 384) 
It is interesting to note that the Gary authorities, as a result 
of this impartial study of their school system, introduced more 
careful supervision and testing as a means of remedying the 
deficiencies. 
Material rewards and overloaded supervision hardly neces- 
sary.—On the other hand, in view of the fact that satisfactory 
social standards in handwriting are easily attained by many 
school systems, with only a moderate amount of stimulus and 
supervision, it seems entirely unnecessary to bestow upon such 
a simple subject the large amount of effort that is described in 
the following quotation from a report of one of our large 
American cities : 
The material incentives to good work [in handwriting] that have 
been held out to the pupils for some time have been changed. . . .  
-P-A-G-E-53
HANDWRITING AND OTHER MOTOR SKILLS 37 
A button especially designed, showing the seal of the city, is now 
presented to all pupils who have had 25 practice drills accepted. 
Likewise a special pin displaying in colors the seal of the city is 
given to pupils having roo drills accepted. The crown of the move- 
ment is a penmanship certificate, a well-executed lithograph contain- 
ing also the city seal. This certificate is awarded to pupils who have 
had accepted 172 drills. 
A district director of penmanship has been appointed in each dis- 
trict who has, under his principal, complete supervision over the 
subject in his entire district. He accepts or rejects the drills from 
the individual pupils. ... He arranges for the transportation of 
drill papers, for the distribution and record of buttons, pins, and 
certificates. 
If the time, effort, and money spent in this elaborate scheme 
were devoted to improving the teaching of some more difficult 
activity, such as skillful silent reading or problem-solving or 
the exercise of civic-moral virtues, it is likely that the social 
results would be very much more valuable that those which ac- 
crue from devoting such energies to unnecessary improvements 
in handwriting—a subject so easy to learn that even feeble- 
minded persons can learn it, and almost any routine drillmaster 
can teach it satisfactorily. 
Handwriting is easy to teach, but neglect brings failure.—In 
general the scientific surveys of handwriting teach us that while 
it is a comparatively simple matter for a well-conducted ele- 
mentary school to attain the degree of handwriting skill that 
is desirable, if a school or a teacher fails to provide the amount 
and kind of training that is needed, the pupils will fall far 
below the standards. On the other hand, the surveys show that 
satisfactory results may be obtained with a very moderate 
amount of time and effort. 
Small amount of time (fifteen minutes a day) sufficient if well 
spent.—This, then, raises the question of the amount of time 
which should be devoted to handwriting. Freeman easily 
reached a conclusion on this question by comparing the effi- 
ciency or excellence of the attainments of various schools with
-P-A-G-E-54
38 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
the amount of time which they devoted to the subject. It 
quickly became apparent that an excessive amount of time was 
not needed because some of the schools that spent a large 
amount of time did not attain any better results than those 
which spent a much smaller amount. From all the data Free- 
man concluded that from ten to fifteen minutes a day is suf- 
ficient to attain satisfactory standards with the greatest economy 
of time and effort. 
Tests of handwriting essential. How to conduct them.— 
In all the investigations described above, a handwriting test is 
essential. The following directions are given by Freeman for 
conducting such a test: 
1. Give the pupils some preliminary practice in writing the words 
which they will write in the test, so that they can write them freely 
from memory. In the second and third grades use some suitable 
bt 5 ood The rain is raining all around, 
It falls on field and tree, 
It rains on the umbrellas here 
And on the ships at sea. 
In the fourth to the eighth grades use the names of the numerals 
(not the figures),—one, two, three, etc.,—practicing up to thirty. 
2. Be provided with a stop watch or a watch with a second hand. 
3- See that the pupils are ready with pen and ink (or pencil in 
the grades in which pens have not been used) and paper. 
4. Instruct the pupils substantially as follows : 
“We are to have a test (or game) to see how well you can write. 
To write well means to write rapidly and also to make it look well. 
We are going to write what we have been practicing” (make sure the 
pupils know what this is). ‘You will start when I say ‘Begin’ and 
stop when I say ‘Stop.’ Be sure to keep writing all the time till I 
say ‘Stop.’” (If this is the first test give a trial or two in starting 
and stopping on other paper than that which is prepared for the 
test.) ‘Remember to write well and rapidly and to keep on writing 
until I say ‘Stop.’” 
5. See that everybody is ready, start the watch or wait till the 
second hand is at zero, and say “Begin.” 
6. Keep watch of the pupils and start going again any that may stop.
-P-A-G-E-55
  HANDWRITING AND OTHER MOTOR SKILLS 39 
7. Note the watch carefully and say “Stop” exactly at the end of 
two minutes. 
8. Glance about and stop any pupils that may continue. (7: 22-23) 
Scoring papers is simple, but requires practice.—After the 
pupils have handed in their papers in such a test, there comes 
the task of scoring them for speed and quality. Scoring for 
speed is very easy because it involves merely counting the num- 
ber of letters written per minute. Scoring for quality on the 
Ayres scale, however, requires more training on the part of 
the scorer in order to secure reliable comparisons, just as in the 
case of using any other measurement instrument. The process 
in the case of handwriting is simple, but practice in it is needed. 
Pupils interested in using the scale to judge their improve- 
ment.—Finally, we may note that each pupil may be trained 
to compare his own handwriting with the handwriting scale and 
become interested in mounting higher and higher on it. The 
pupils will need guidance in comparing their samples with the 
scale. Some, especially, will need to overcome the tendency to 
mark their own papers too high. The competitive element will 
interest and stimulate some, while others will be encouraged by 
the obvious success in finding themselves mounting on the scale. 
Conclusion of specific discussion of handwriting.—This 
will conclude our discussion of the teaching of handwriting as 
one of the most important kinds of motor skill acquired in the 
grades. In our discussion we described (A) actual examples of 
the technique of conducting handwriting lessons, (B) labora- 
tory investigations of how skilled handwriting is performed and 
learned and the corresponding conclusions concerning teaching 
it, and (C) the use of handwriting scales to determine the stand- 
ards of excellence which are desired in business and in each 
grade in the elementary school and to measure the success of 
any pupil or teacher or system in handwriting. 
In order to extend the lessons which we have learned from 
our study of handwriting, we may profitably turn for a moment 
to certain general principles of teaching which it suggests.
-P-A-G-E-56
    
40 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
SecTIoN II. GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING ILLUS- 
TRATED BY THE DiscussION oF HANDWRITING 
1. Precisely defined social needs give definite aims.—The 
first general principle of teaching which is clearly illustrated by 
our handwriting discussions is that we can clarify our aims in 
teaching by a careful study of social needs. The fact that we 
know that quality 60 on the Ayres scale is all that is needed 
for general social purposes enables us to define our school aims 
with equal definiteness. In our later chapters we shall en- 
deavor to secure such social standards for each type of learn- 
ing, but we shall seldom be able to define them as clearly as 
in the case of handwriting. 
2. Pupil maturity determines grading of exercises and 
emphasis.—Our knowledge of the way in which pupils improve 
with age in their ability to make and control fine movements 
enables us to decide what types of materials, movements, and 
rhythms to use at each age in teaching handwriting. Again, 
our knowledge in this regard is probably more specific in the 
case of handwriting than in any other type of learning, but in 
later chapters we shall give attention to the problem of matur- 
ing in the various types of learning as a factor in determining the 
grading of activities. 
3. Research determines educational truths.—The scientific 
studies of handwriting which were described in this chapter 
typify recent efforts to determine the true answers to educational 
problems by scientific research. Notable centers of such re- 
search which have been concerned with matters discussed in this 
chapter are Columbia University, The University of Chicago, 
the Russell Sage Foundation, and the General Education Board. 
For many years the Sage Foundation employed Dr.. Leonard 
Ayres, who devised the Ayres scale. The General Education 
Board financed the survey of the Gary schools and the labora- 
tory studies of handwriting by means of motion pictures, which 
we described in this chapter.  
-P-A-G-E-57
HANDWRITING AND OTHER MOTOR SKILLS 41 
4. Results of research destroy pedagogical quackery.— 
The results of such researches enable us to refute the fallacious 
claims of educational quacks and charlatans who sometimes 
dominate the country with false methods of teaching through 
cleverly commercialized systems of teaching or organized propa- 
ganda. The obviously absurd training in forming letters without 
finger movements is perhaps our most striking example of such a 
false practice. It is very likely that in the more complex types 
of learning, to be described in later chapters, equally absurd 
practices have prevailed. 
5. Experimental research isolates elements, controls con- 
ditions, and measures results.—The use of the Judd tracer to 
isolate the arm-movement element in handwriting from the total 
complex movement is a good example of an easy scientific ex- 
periment. The movements of finger, hand, and arm in writing 
are so complexly codrdinated that it is difficult to tell from ordi- 
nary observation just what the arm contributes. The tracer 
record enables us to examine this element by itself. The motion- 
picture records illustrate the better control that experimentation 
creates. Not only were the writers photographed under defi- 
nitely standardized conditions but the resulting photographs 
could be projected, manipulated, reprojected, and controlled 
in a great variety of ways which are not possible with ordinary 
observations. Finally, exact measurements were used in study- 
ing the records; for example, the number of pauses made by a 
smooth, fluent writer were compared with those made by a poor, 
jerky writer, and certain conclusions were drawn concerning 
rhythm in good writing. A prominent American leader in such 
experimental studies of learning in several school subjects— 
notably handwriting and reading—is Professor C. H. Judd, 
whose pioneer work on handwriting has been described above. 
6. Special scales needed and invented to measure results 
in school subjects.—The invention of special scales to measure 
the results of teaching in handwriting, reading, and other sub- 
jects was a necessary step in enabling educators to test the

efficiency of teaching. Professor E. L. Thorndike of Columbia 
University has been the leader in such scale-making. He pub- 
lished the first American scientific handwriting scale in 1910 and 
has stimulated the development of many scales by other inves- 
tigators. His handwriting scale has been largely superseded by 
the Ayres scale (Gettysburg edition) because of the convenient, 
simple form of the latter. To secure the exact values, such as 
20, 30, 40, etc., assigned to the several specimens in such a scale 
involves elaborate mathematical treatment by the scale-maker. 
7. Scientific investigations are mathematically precise, ob- 
jective, verifiable, expert, and impartial—The preceding 
points enable us to formulate a description of scientific investi- 
gations in education which may guide us in judging of the 
validity of opinions and evidence relative to educational prob- 
lems. The characteristics of such scientific investigations which 
appear from this chapter are the following: 
a. They are mathematically precise; for example, the hand- 
writing records in the Gary survey were compared in the exact 
terms of the Ayres scale with results from other American 
schools. 
b. They are objective; for example, the tracer records and 
the motion pictures can be examined as objects by anybody. 
c. They are verifiable; for example, anybody can give the 
handwriting test exactly as described on page 38 in any school 
that is under investigation, to see whether he gets the same re 
sults as any other investigator. 
d. They are organized by experts; for example, Judd and 
Freeman have spent years in studying and perfecting the tech- 
nique of laboratory experimentation, and Thorndike, Ayres, and 
Courtis have spent years in devising and using scales for meas- 
uring educational products. 
e. Finally, they are impartial; for example, neither Judd nor 
Freeman was biased by an interest in selling a certain hand- 
writing system. As investigators they were impartially concerned 
merely to ascertain the truth,

Transition to other forms of motor skill.— When we have 
the results of scientific investigations that possess the above 
characteristics we can feel reasonably sure of the validity and 
value of the methods of teaching that have been tested by these 
investigations and proved worthy. In the case of handwriting 
we have made great progress in proving the value of certain 
methods. We shall now turn to a brief discussion of other 
forms of motor skill—forms in which our scientific knowledge 
of the best methods to use is very meager. 
Section III. Construction, GYMNASTICS, AND OTHER 
Forms or Motor SKILL 
Examples. What points of technique did your teachers 
exhibit 2—Among the other forms of motor skill which chil- 
dren learn in school are paper-folding and paper-cutting, model- 
ing in clay and plasticene, weaving and knitting, running and 
jumping, kicking, tossing, and catching balls, skipping and 
dancing. In thinking about the best methods to use in teaching 
a pupil to be skillful in any one of these arts, the reader might 
recall her own efforts to acquire some motor skill, such as knit- 
ting or dancing, under the direction of some teacher. My own 
comments on the methods of such teaching are largely the out- 
growth of careful observation of teachers who were instructing 
me as an adult in dancing or swimming or playing golf or in 
learning gymnastic feats. I have also made some observations 
of teachers of motor skills in school. 
Contrast between two baseball coaches.—For example, I 
watched for some time two men who were instructing seventh- 
grade boys in baseball. One man, a rather unskilled teacher, 
merely divided his class into two teams, appointing as captains 
two skillful players. These captains chose their players and 
assigned them to places, reserving to themselves the pitcher’s 
place. In this position they pitched fast curved balls. Conse- 
quently many of the pupils, who lived in a city-apartment

region and had seldom played hard ball before, merely struck 
out. I watched the teams all spring, and it was the same story 
day after day. The unskilled pupils, who should have had easy 
pitching and might have grown in skill from day to day, spent 
the spring striking out. Moreover, when in the field they were 
assigned positions in 
which they had lit- 
tlechance to perform, 
while the pupils who 
were already skilled 
played the more ac- 
tive positions. All the 
teacher did was to 
act as umpire and 
disciplinarian. He 
did no real teaching. 
In sharpest con- 
trast was the work 
of the other teacher. 
In the first place, he

Such informal activity with large materials has and providing much 
replaced the use of highly formalized fine move- more practice within 
ments with very small materials 
the half-hour gymna- 
sium period. To each batter he pitched balls of appropriate 
difficulty. To the novices he made encouraging and specific 
suggestions, such as “Stand up to the ball; I’m not going to 
hit you,” or “Hold your bat as I told you to.” Similarly, 
specific suggestions were made to the catcher, the base-runners, 
and all the other players. Thus, most of the players were kept 
alert and attentive to their specific needs for improvement. 
Furthermore, instead of allowing those who were already skilled 
to monopolize the game, the teacher gave all the pupils chances     2a :  
-P-A-G-E-61
  HANDWRITING AND OTHER MOTOR SKILLS 45 
to occupy positions in which they should have frequent occa- 
sions for fielding, throwing, catching, etc. 
Few conclusive laboratory experiments.—Of the many 
laboratory experiments that have been conducted upon motor 
skill few have reached reliable conclusions concerning the best 
methods of teaching, because the learners have commonly 
been allowed to learn without definite instruction; that is, 
merely through trial 
and accidental suc- 
cess. Since the exper- 
iments upon learning 
handwriting which 
we described above 
are among the most 
elaborate and reli- 
able of all the exper- 
iments upon motor 
skills, we shall allow 
them to typify for us 
the general possibili- 
ties of such experi- 
mentationandturnto 
certain general rules CAN A GIRL DRIVE A NAIL? 
for teaching. 
Opinions concerning best methods to use.—From such 
observations and experiments as we have noted above we may 
derive the following general opinions concerning the best meth- 
ods to use in teaching motor skills: 
1. Give a clear notion of what to do.—The teacher should 
take care to give every pupil a clear notion of what he is to 
do; for example, in demonstrating an act she should stand so 
that all the pupils can see clearly. I observed the following vio- 
lation of this rule. A teacher demonstrated to a third-grade 
class a complicated piece of paper-folding and then asked the 
class to try. Only a few succeeded. She called on a skillful girl     Courtesy of The University of Chicago Elementary School       
 
-P-A-G-E-62
  46 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
whose seat was in the middle of the room to stand up and show 
the other pupils how to do it. The girl stood at her seat and per- 
formed the act in such a position that the pupils in the back of 
the room could not see. Later the teacher rebuked one of these 
pupils—an unskilled but conscientious boy—because he was 
looking around to see how his neighbors were doing the folding. 
Thus, she was rebuking him for doing the very thing which she 
had wanted him to do when the girl demonstrated—that is, 
      Courtesy of The University of Chicago Elementary School 
BOYS MODELING IN CLAY 
Such constructive activity frequently produces pleasing artistic products, which 
the pupils proudly enjoy at the time and in later life 
watch another pupil—but which he had been unable to do then 
because the teacher had failed to have the demonstrator stand 
where the whole class could see. 
2. Imitation usually the best method of acquiring the idea 
of what to do.—The demonstration of paper-folding described 
in the preceding paragraph is an example of the use of imitation 
to convey the idea of what to do. Examples from handwriting 
were given on page 16. Such opportunities for imitation are 
usually essential. Few people can learn how to do a complex 
act merely from written or spoken directions. Hence it is de-
-P-A-G-E-63
HANDWRITING AND OTHER MOTOR SKILLS 47 
sirable that the teacher be a skilled performer. In order to facili- 
tate imitation it is important in many cases for the demonstrator 
to face in the same direction as the learners; for example, in 
marching or dancing or performing gymnastic exercises. If 
the class is small the best position is sometimes at the side or 
diaganally in front of the class. If the instructor does face the 
learners it is often helpful for him to reverse his own move- 
ments; that is, to perform to his left, while the pupils perform 
to their right, etc. 
3. Simple directions often helpful and necessary.— Where 
the action can be easily and definitely described simple direc- 
tions often aid imitation; for example, in learning to dance, to 
tell the pupils to do certain things to each count, such as “Bring 
the feet together on ‘three.’”” There is, however, great danger of 
overelaborating such directions, as evidenced in some of the old- 
fashioned handwriting systems, which gave lengthy descriptions 
of each letter, or in some vocal systems which describe the whole 
anatomy and operation of the vocal organs in an effort to train 
students to sing or speak correctly. 
4. Give positive directions and corrections.—Say to a pu- 
pil who is having difficulty, ‘‘Do it this way,” with appropriate 
demonstration or directions. To say “Why did you do it that 
way ?” or “Don’t do it this way” often tends to focus his 
mind more intently on the wrong method. Instead, the sug- 
gestions should tend to fix the correct method more clearly 
in his mind. 
5. Indicate correct form but do not overemphasize it— 
In any art, such as singing, baseball, golf, or skating, the pro- 
fessional experts tend to use certain standard positions, move- 
ments, and methods. These standard forms are known as good 
form, At the same time, the experts in any given art, while 
resembling each other in their general methods, may as indi- 
viduals deviate in many ways from the standard form. Hence, 
in teaching any art the instructor should demonstrate stand- 
ard methods to the pupils, but at the same time permit
-P-A-G-E-64
48 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
considerable individual variation in positions and movements, 
always remembering that what the pupils and society are most 
interested in is a satisfactory product or result—not some 
particular form or method. 
6. Encourage the pupils, especially the unskillful—The 
helpful influence of hopefulness and of the joy of success in 
facilitating learning 
is emphasized by 
many scientific inves- 
tigators of learning- 
processes. To create 
an encouraged frame 
of mind in each pupil 
we offer the following 
suggestions : 
a. Maintain a gen- 
eral atmosphere of 
encouragement. This 
general recommenda-

Admonitions, rather as minding them of what they forget, than by 
harsh Rebukes and Chiding, as if they were wilfully guilty.      
  BOY DEMONSTRATING THE USE OF A POT- 
TER’S WHEEL 
b. Help the slow pupils to realize that they will improve with 
practice ; to realize that the try-try-again method does bring re- 
sults. Experiments in psychological laboratories bring out the 
fact that although it is difficult to equal the performances of the 
expert, talented specialists in any motor art, many learners who 
 
-P-A-G-E-65
  HANDWRITING AND OTHER MOTOR SKILLS 49 
are sufficiently mature will improve very rapidly in their early 
periods of practice of certain motor arts such as typewriting. 
c. Give specific suggestions for improvements—not merely 
vague, general ones. Here, again, our simplest examples are 
from handwriting. For example, a pupil’s handwriting may be 
poor in any one of the following characteristics: letter formation, 
spacing, quality of the stroke, uniformity of slant, uniformity of 
alignment. The teacher should be skilled in diagnosing each 
pupil’s special needs and in making appropriate suggestions. 
d. Make few suggestions at a time. Again we may quote 
Locke, who said : 
Another Thing you are to take Care of, is, not to endeavor to 
settle too many Habits at once, lest by Variety you confound them, 
and so perfect none. When constant Custom has made any one Thing 
easy and natural to ’em and they practice it without Reflection, you 
may then go on to another. 
Conclusion of discussion of motor skills.—These general 
rules for organizing practice will conclude our discussion of motor 
learning. In school and adult life such learning is very frequent. 
Where instruction is commercially profitable, as in handwriting 
or vocal and piano teaching, instructors vie with each other in 
advocating the peculiar excellences of their systems. Frequently 
these claims are pure quackery, the asserted virtues being in real- 
ity great defects. Only by carefully controlled scientific studies 
can we find the best methods. Fortunately, in the case of hand- 
writing—the most important motor art taught in elementary 
schools—we have numerous scientific investigations upon which 
to base our methods. We have described these investigations 
at length, not only in order to throw light on the teaching of 
handwriting but also in order to give the reader a notion of the 
nature of scientific methods of investigating educational ques- 
tions. In the next chapter we shall turn to another relatively 
simple type of learning—namely, learning to spell—in which 
also we have a number of reliable investigations to guide us in 
our choice of methods of teaching.

  CHAPTER IV 
LEARNING TO SPELL FOUR THOUSAND WORDS 
Main points of the chapter.—1. The task of teaching spelling 
has been greatly simplified by discovering the words actually used 
by children in school-writing and by adults in business and social 
correspondence. 
2, There are only about four thousand such words in common use. 
3. Excellent textbooks now contain only these words, in annual, 
weekly, and daily lists, and arrange them on the basis of scientific 
investigations of their use by children in the various grades and their 
relative difficulty. 
4. The more difficult words appear for review several times at 
psychological intervals. 
5. The actual conduct of spelling lessons is probably best organ- 
ized in units of a week’s work consisting of about thirty or forty 
words—some new and some review. 
6. These words are first given in a written test which ascertains 
the particular difficulties and determines where emphasis needs to 
be placed. 
7. The correct spelling is then taught by methods which emphasize 
careful, correct pronunciation, syllabication, and immediately cor- 
rected mental recall. 
8. This teaching is followed by snappy, interesting drills in which 
concentrated attention is secured through the spirit of competitive 
games. 
9. Follow-up tests are given to ascertain what weak points remain 
and how effective the instruction has been. 
Five short sections.—The story of how to teach spelling 
can be easily told in five brief installments, as follows: 
I. What words to teach (p. 53). 
II. How to arrange the selected words (p. 54). 
III. How to conduct spelling lessons (p. 57).

  LEARNING TO SPELL 53 
IV. How to measure the results of spelling instruction (p. 66). 
V. The science and the art of teaching (p. 69). 
As in the case of handwriting, we shall find a number of sci- 
entific investigations to guide us in dealing with most of these 
issues. 
Section I. WHat Worps To TEAcH 
Teach the words that children will need to spell and no 
others.—Not long ago it was customary to make up the spell- 
ing lists regardless of the pupil’s need for the words in ordinary 
writing. On this basis, as late as 1915 one of the most popular 
spellers contained 8000 words. A number of investigations con- 
ducted about 1914 showed, on the other hand, that in ordinary 
life pupils will use a very much smaller number—let us say 
about 4000. Obviously great economy is effected in teaching by 
eliminating the uncommon words and teaching only those that 
pupils will need to spell. 
Common words determined from pupils’ themes and social 
correspondence.— The common words which pupils are likely to 
use in their writing were determined by tabulating the contents 
of many pupils’ themes and of business letters and family 
correspondence. The following examples are typical of such 
investigations. 
The words used in the composition themes of elementary- 
school pupils were reported by Professor W. F. Jones in 1914. 
He found only 4532 different words used in 75,000 themes writ- 
ten by 1050 elementary-school pupils in Illinois, Maryland, 
Towa, and South Dakota upon a wide range of topics. From 56 
to 105 written themes were secured from each pupil. 
The words used in 2000 short letters from business and pro- 
fessional life were tabulated by Dr. Leonard Ayres, and 2001 
different words were found. 
As a third source of common words the extensive family cor- 
respondence of thirteen adults was studied by Cook and O’Shea 
and found to contain 5200 different words.  
-P-A-G-E-70
    54 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
A list of the 1000 most commonly used English words was 
secured by Ayres by combining the results of a number of such 
investigations as those described above. 
Several other investigators have extended and refined the in- 
formation secured in these pioneer studies. One of the most 
authoritative investigations, entitled “The Determination of a 
Spelling Vocabulary based upon Written Correspondence,” was 
conducted by W. N. Anderson, at the University of Iowa, in 
1917. Anderson’s list includes 2977 words from the written 
correspondence of Iowa people. 
Recent texts and city spelling lists contain from 2000 to 4000 
words.—With such information in hand it is a relatively simple 
matter for a school superintendent or a writer of a spelling book 
to determine what words to include in his list. In examining such 
lists of recent issue one generally finds them prefaced with the 
statement that all the tooo common words from the Ayres list 
are included, plus the more frequently occurring words from the 
other lists. As a rule, the words which occurred only a very few 
times in the investigations are omitted, so that an up-to-date 
spelling list will contain from 2000 to 4000 common words of 
everyday life for pupils to learn. In addition to these common 
words the list may contain a small number of technical words 
which the pupils will need in their written work in arithmetic, 
history, geography, and other subjects, but which they would 
not be likely to use in daily writing. Examples of such words 
are “parallel,” “emancipation,” and “hemisphere.” 
Section II. How To ARRANGE THE SELECTED Worps 
Arrange according to difficulty and probable use in a 
grade.—After the maker of a spelling list has selected the 
words it is to contain, he confronts the problem of assigning 
them to the various grades of the elementary school and deter- 
mining the order of the words within each grade. Two simple 
principles seem to apply to this arrangement: (1) The most dif-
-P-A-G-E-71
    
LEARNING TO SPELL 55 
ficult words should be presented in the advanced grades and the 
easier words in the earlier grades. (2) The words that pupils 
most commonly use in any grade should be placed there unless 
well learned in an earlier grade. These principles seem self- 
evident, but their scientific application involves extensive inves- 
tigation of the relative difficulty of words and their common use 
by children. Moreover, sometimes the two principles conflict, for 
some of the greatest difficulties in remembering correct spellings 
occur with short words for which children may have frequent use 
in the early grades. For example, in Jones’s investigation the 
short, common word “which” was misspelled more frequently 
than any other word. The common words “their” and “there” 
ranked next in the number of misspellings. Yet Jones says: 
The very words that give most trouble in spelling are almost in- 
variably found in the second- or third-grade lists [from children’s 
themes] and faithfully appear throughout the subsequent years. Over 
nine tenths of all words misspelled by the 1os5o0 grade students are 
found in these two lists. ... The second-grade list also contains 
the very useful words of all grades. (18: 24) 
- How to adjust conflicts of difficulty with pupil use—The 
scientific arrangers of spelling lists have given considerable 
thought to the problem of how to adjust this conflict between 
the difficulty of spelling certain simple common words and the 
frequent use of these same words by children in the lower 
grades. Perhaps the following principles will prove to be sound 
upon further investigation : 
1. First arrange all the common words in the order of diffi- 
culty as determined from ‘tests. 
2. Arrange exceptions by placing the few difficult but very 
common words as early in the grades as they are commonly 
used by children. 
3. Invent specific devices for making the learning of these 
words easy and certain. 
4. Place them for definite review in each succeeding year 
until they are thoroughly learned.
-P-A-G-E-72
    56 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
Lists should repeat difficult words for review.—The last 
statement in the preceding paragraph brings out a feature that 
we find appearing in the spelling lists of the best recent texts; 
namely, the repetition of words from year to year. Obviously 
many of the easiest words need no review by all the pupils. On 
the other hand, the most difficult need frequent reviews, while 
the moderately difficult need occasional review. 
Lists provide a few new and a few review words for each 
day or week.—Finally, the scientifically constructed spelling 
list, which is designed to give the teacher the greatest benefit of 
all the detailed scientific studies of children’s vocabularies and 
misspellings, divides the words for each grade into units contain- 
ing new and review words which are to be taught each day or 
each week in the year. Some of the spelling texts now in use 
have-attempted to do this. With such a text in her hand the 
teacher can proceed without any waste of her own time and 
energy to teach the common words in an order which is vouched 
for by the best scientific investigations. Thus, as in the case of 
handwriting, we have the best results of university research in 
a given type of learning made available in ready-made form for 
even the most isolated, inexperienced teacher. 
How many words per day? Two or three new plus four re- 
view.—The exact number of new words that needs to be taught 
in a year, week, or day is easily determined from the fact that 
the total is about 4ooo. If these are distributed equally over 
eight years it results in 500 words a year. If we provide for two 
hundred schooldays in each year, we should need to teach 2 
or 3 new words per day. Allowing for the very rapid growth 
in pupils’ vocabularies in the second, third, and fourth grades, 
we might assign in these grades approximately 3 new words per 
day and assign 2 new words per day in other grades. If to these 
we add 3 or 4 review words per day we secure a total of about 
6 words per day or 30 words a week. With such lists in hand 
we are ready to turn to the third phase of the teaching of spelling ; 
namely, how to conduct the spelling lessons.
-P-A-G-E-73
  LEARNING TO SPELL 57 
Section III. How to conpuct SPELLING Lessons 
Plan in units of one week’s work.—The planning of 
spelling lessons is probably best carried on in terms of a week’s 
work. Let us assume that a teacher has ready on Friday a list 
of about thirty words—some new and some review—to be 
taught during the next week. The scientific investigators of 
the teaching of spelling would probably agree on some such 
procedure as the following: 
Preliminary tests ascertain difficulties. Follow-up tests. 
—In order to determine what difficulties pupils have with the 
list for the coming week a written test should be given on Friday. 
Such a test may show that little drill is needed on some of the 
words, while others need very careful study and much drill. 
A method of conducting such a test, scoring the words and mak- 
ing the teacher’s record of the difficulty of each word, is described 
by Tidyman in the following paragraphs from his excellent 
book “The Teaching of Spelling.” 
The words are dictated to the children; then spelled back to the 
children for correction; finally, the teacher determines the number 
of errors for each word by a show of hands and enters the figure 
after each word on her record sheet [as shown in the sample record 
on page 58]. Thus her work for the week is laid out. By com- 
parison with the “number present,” the figures give some notion 
of the degree of difficulty of the several words and show the teacher 
the relative emphasis that should be laid on each word. After 
each day’s lesson a similar test is given and the figures are entered 
in the appropriate column. If the teaching is thorough, there 
should be few errors or none in the daily test. If the teaching 
has been well proportioned, the words will have about the same 
number of mistakes. When a word is found to have too many errors, 
it is carried over into the next day’s lesson and treated as before. 
The plan provides also for a review lesson of all the words of the 
week on Friday, with a record of errors; and, finally, a test without 
study after two weeks. The last is to get some evidence on the tim- 
ing of reviews and may be varied as necessity demands. The use of 
this plan shows the teacher how to distribute her time and effort

  among the words of the lesson and gives her effective and repeated 
checks upon the efficiency of her work. Teachers who have used the 
plan find that they take no more time for spelling than before,— 
fifteen to twenty minutes per day. The plan is suggested here for 
what it is worth as one that has been tried and used with some degree 
classroom work. (3: 26-27) of success in actual!

  LEARNING TO SPELL 59 
In order to get a clear idea of Tidyman’s scheme as shown in 
the above table, the reader should follow the story which it tells 
by tracing what happened in the teaching of a few of the words. 
For example, take the first word, “courage,” and follow it across 
the table and then compare its story with that of the demon 
“their,” the fourth word. 
Conducting a day’s lesson.—The above account gives the 
larger outlines of the procedure for a week’s work in spelling. 
We may now proceed to consider the conduct of a day’s lesson. 
Tidyman gives a number of sample lessons, from which we may 
quote the one given below. A word of explanation is needed for 
the fractional values given in the description. The fraction }3, 
which occurs after the word “steam,” indicates that 19 children 
misspelled this word in the preliminary Friday test, when 32 
children were present. 
Ill. PLAN OF PRESENTING WORDS. GRADE III A, HART 
SCHOOL. NELLIE V. WEDDERSPOON, TEACHER 
Time: 15 MINUTES 
Words and spelling difficulty: “steam,” 43; “please,” 43; 
“race,” 43. 
Commonest errors: “stem”; “pleas,” “ples,” ‘“plece”; “ase,” 
“rac,” “rass.” Words are on the blackboard at the opening of 
school. Erase at the beginning of the spelling lesson. 
I. Taking up words, one at a time, the teacher writes the word 
on the board and pronounces it. Children pronounce after her. 
II. Several children use word in a sentence until it is clear that 
they know the meaning. 
II. Visualization. In what way are “steam” and “please” alike? 
Underline similarities. Pick out familiar parts. Associate with “ease,” 
“team,” “tea.” Sound “steam.” How many sounds? How many 
letters? Why are there five letters and but four sounds? Sound 
“please.” How many sounds? letters? Why six letters and but 
four sounds? Sound “race.” How many sounds? letters? What 
difficulties in this word? What words have the same “ace” ending ? 
Erase words.
-P-A-G-E-76
  60 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
IV. Rewrite word. Children look at it. Spell it looking at it; 
without looking at it. Call on individuals. Write it on paper. Look 
to see if it is correct. 
V. Write words in lesson from memory. 
In the final test, mistakes were made as follows: “steam,” 3; 
“please,” 2; “race,” 0. (3: 146) 
Devices to teach individual words.—Perhaps the most strik- 
ing feature of the actual teaching in the above lesson is the care 
taken by the teacher to impress the correct form of each word 
upon the pupils. This calls for special devices to focus their 
attention upon the correct spelling of the difficult part. 
Example of focusing attention on correct spelling of difficult 
parts——Another example of this practice is given by Tidyman. 
In a sixth-grade lesson the following words occurred, with the 
index of difficulty indicated in each case: “druggist,” 3%; “dig- 
ging,” 4. The particular difficulty in each case was in using 
one g instead of two. The teacher’s method in teaching ‘“‘drug- 
gist” was the following: 
First word : “druggist.” 
I. Pronounce and have children pronounce (in both cases be sure 
that the “ist” is not sounded as “‘est”). 
II. Several pupils use in a sentence. 
III. Rewrite in syllables : “drug gist.” Pronounce by syllables and 
have children pronounce after you, looking carefully at the letters of 
each syllable. What is the particular difficulty in this word? Under- 
line it. What is the last letter of the first syllable? the first letter of 
the last syllable? Look at the word again. Spell it aloud. What 
other word in the lesson has the same difficulty ? 
IV. Close your eyes. Try to see the word. 
V. Spell orally together. Have those who spell poorly or care- 
lessly spell individually. 
VI. Write the word two or three times on paper. (3: 148) 
Devices for the spelling demons : “lice.” —After investigators 
have continued their experimentation on spelling for a number 
of years, it is likely that we shall possess standardized special
-P-A-G-E-77
  LEARNING TO SPELL 61 
devices for making easy the learning of even the most difficult 
spelling words—the spelling demons, such as “which,” “there” 
and “their,” “separate,” etc. I remember such a device’s being 
used by a visitor to the high school in which I was a pupil. 
Speaking to the class, he said, “Your teacher tells me you have 
trouble in spelling ‘receive’ and ‘believe.’ Here is an easy way 
to remember them.” Writing the word “lice” on the board, he 
said, “Just remember ‘lice’: i follows / and e follows c, and you 
will always be able to spell ‘believe,’ ‘receive,’ and similar 
words.” I have told this incident to classes of teachers and noted 
that some of them shuddered at the word “lice.” If you don’t 
like it you can substitute the word “Alice.” 
A class yell for “separate.”—After I had related the shes 
incident to a group of experienced teachers, one of them said 
that she found the upper-grade children in her departmental- 
geography classes were having difficulty with the word “sepa- 
rate.” So she appointed a bright girl to devise a class yell from 
the word and then to act as cheer leader in drilling the class in 
it. The result’ was that the girl stood before the pupils and led 
them in the following: 
S-E-P All R-A-T-E 
S-E-P A!! R-A-T-E 
S-E-P Al! R-A-T-E 
Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee ! ! ! 
A few days later the principal of the building inquired who 
had started this new-fangled thing, for all the children on the 
playground were yelling 
S-E-P A!! R-A-T-E etc. 
Correct pronunciation and syllabication. Often serve to cor- 
rect misspellings.—In many cases the correct spelling of a word 
is made much easier by correctly pronouncing and syllabifying 
it. Possibly the misspelling of “separate” is a good example 
of correcting mispronunciation, since many persons pronounce  
-P-A-G-E-78
  62 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
this word as if it were spelled “sep er ate.” In case of children 
from illiterate homes, where many slovenly pronunciations 
occur, the spelling difficulties arising from mispronunciations 
are very striking. Some of the most carefully prepared spell- 
ing books have given especial attention to organized phonetic 
instruction as an aid to both correct pronunciation and correct 
spelling. 
Mental recall. Stimulates active attention and checks vague 
erroneous impressions.—A person may observe an object, such 
as an automobile or a bird or a word to be spelled, and think 
that he has a clear idea of its construction, yet when he looks 
away or closes his eyes, may find that his mental impression is 
very hazy. This fact has led investigators to believe that it is a 
good practice to have a pupil close his eyes or turn them away 
from the observed word, then endeavor to recall the correct spell- 
ing, then immediately glance again at the word, to see whether 
his recall is correct and to improve it in parts that are hazy or 
incorrect. This practice is known as memorizing by the method 
of immediately corrected recall. It is probably *more effective 
than mere continuous staring at the word, not only because it 
fills in an otherwise hazy picture but also because it makes the 
learner more alert and promotes more active attention to the 
detailed form of the word. 
Attention. Increased also by other devices to secure interest. 
Games.—Securing alert attention to the detailed construction of 
a word is closely related to the general problem of securing in- 
tense interest of the pupils in correct spelling ; in fact, the reason 
for arousing intense interest is because it tends to elicit such 
alert attention. Among the most potent devices for arousing 
zest and interest in spelling are competitive games. The old- 
fashioned spell-down, which excited the interest of the whole 
community, is a good example. Excellent specific devices for 
organizing a variety of spelling contests and spelling games are 
described by the well-known expert S. A. Courtis in a pamphlet 
entitled “Teaching Spelling by Plays and Games.” (1)
-P-A-G-E-79
LEARNING TO SPELL 63 
Drills. Short,snappy,interesting drills based on careful teach- 
ing automatize correct spelling.—One feature of such competi- 
tive games that gives them special interest is snappy, rapid 
activity. After the teacher has taken care to make sure that 
pupils are temporarily familiar with the correct spelling of a 
given list of words, more and more emphasis should be placed on 
such rapid, snappy recall. Not only should this gameful spirit 
prevail in the oral games, but Courtis recommends that it also 
enter into the written practice. He says that after the pupils 
have written the word carefully and legibly the speed should 
gradually be increased, as described in the following quotation: 
One of the effective forms of class drill is concert writing. The 
word to be learned is pronounced by the teacher and class together 
and then written letter by letter as it is spelled aloud. This is re- 
peated five or six times in rapid succession. The rate of writing should 
be slow at first, then faster and faster like a college yell. (1: 8) 
Securing almost perfect spelling.—Not many years ago an 
efficient school superintendent was satisfied if the pupils of 
the city in the semiannual examinations secured an average of 
80 per cent; now an efficient superintendent is not satisfied 
unless the average is between 95 and too per cent. In some 
schools where a special drive is made in spelling, almost perfect 
scores are secured. This improvement is due mainly to the 
following factors, which were described above: (1) reduction 
of the words taught to those actually needed in school-writing 
or in social correspondence; (2) careful grading and arranging 
of the words, with specific repeated reviews of the more difficult 
ones; (3) frequent testing to determine what degree of study 
and drill each word needs; (4) careful teaching of the form of 
each word so as to assure its correct mental recall; (5) snappy, 
gameful drills; (6) intense pupil interest in becoming skilled 
spellers. 
Fifteen minutes of specific teaching superior to incidental 
teaching in effectiveness and interest.—The great effectiveness 
of such teaching contrasts not only with the ineffectiveness of the
-P-A-G-E-80
64 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
teaching of spelling which prevailed up to about 1900 but also 
with the ineffectiveness of the so-called incidental teaching of 
spelling. By incidental teaching is meant mere practice in spell- 
ing words as they arise in the various subjects—arithmetic, 
history, geography, composition, etc. Wherever such incidental 
teaching has been tried on a large scale in the formal drill sub- 
jects—notably in handwriting, spelling, and the pronunciation 
of new words in reading—and the results have been measured, 
the pupils have been found to rank far below those who have 
been taught by progressive, scientific, specific drill methods. 
Not only have the scientific, specific drill methods proved more 
effective but they have also proved to be most interesting to the 
pupils. One has only to watch a skilled, alert, progressive teacher 
conducting a snappy drill game to realize that pupils manifest 
the same intense interest in it that they do in the active games 
which constitute some of the happiest moments of their young 
lives. Where such teaching prevails, an excessive amount of time 
is not needed, fifteen minutes a day having been found sufficient 
to secure excellent results. 
Individual instruction. A further step by resourceful teach- 
ers.—All the practices described above concern group or class 
instruction in a form that can easily be administered even by a 
beginning teacher, provided she is furnished with ready-made 
devices by scientific investigators. Very resourceful teachers 
may develop the technique to an even finer degree by individ- 
ualizing the instruction in such a manner that each pupil prac- 
tices himself upon the words with which he has had special 
difficulties in the week’s preliminary test. An excellent account 
of just how to proceed in conducting such individualized teach- 
ing, together with measured results of its effectiveness, is given 
by Miss Laura Zirbes, in the Elementary School Journal for 
June, 1919, Vol. XIX, pp. 778-798. 
Teaching pupils how to learn the spelling of words.— 
An important factor in such individualized instruction is train- 
ing pupils in methods of studying words and of drilling them- 
 
-P-A-G-E-81
LEARNING TO SPELL 65 
selves upon them. Even in the ordinary group instruction such 
training is also important. The following set of rules to guide 
upper-grade pupils in such activity is typical of these efforts to 
teach pupils how to study spelling. 
HOW TO LEARN TO SPELL A WORD 
1. The first step in learning to spell a word is to pronounce it 
correctly. When you are certain that you know how the word is 
pronounced, pronounce it, enunciating each syllable distinctly and 
looking closely at each syllable as you say it. 
2. Close your eyes and try to recall how the word looks, syllable 
by syllable, as you pronounce it in a whisper. In pronouncing the 
word be sure to enunciate the syllables carefully. 
3. Open your eyes to make sure that you were able to recall the 
correct spelling. 
4. Look at the word again, enunciating the syllables distinctly. 
5. Recall again, with closed eyes, how the word looked. 
6. Check again with the correct form. This recall (as in 2 and 5) 
should be repeated at least three times, and oftener if you have diffi- 
culty in recalling the correct form of the word. 
7. When you feel sure that you have learned the word, write it 
without looking at the book, and then check with the correct form. 
8. Repeat this two or more times without looking eithér at the 
book or at your previous attempts. 
9. If you miss the word on either of these trials, you should copy 
it in your spelling notebook, since it probably is especially difficult 
for you. (2: 72) 
It will be noticed that these rules apply certain of the prin- 
ciples of teaching which we discussed above, notably those con- 
cerning correct pronunciation, syllabication, and immediately 
corrected recall. 
Three installments of the spelling story completed.—The 
above paragraph completes the third installment of our short 
story of how to teach spelling. These installments may be 
summarized as follows: 
I. The words whose spelling is to be taught should include 
only those which scientific investigations have found to be com-
-P-A-G-E-82
  66 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
monly used by children in school-writing or by adults in business 
or social correspondence. 
Il. The words should be carefully graded and arranged in 
annual, weekly, and daily lists by expert investigators who are 
familiar with the relative difficulties of the words and with their 
probable use in the several grades of school. Words needing 
review should appear often enough at psychological intervals 
to assure correct automatic spelling. 
III. For the actual conduct of spelling lessons the best unit 
for planning is probably thirty or forty words, including new 
and review ones, to be taught in a given week. Preliminary 
tests upon these should be given to ascertain what difficulties 
pupils have. The correct spelling should then be carefully taught 
by methods which emphasize correct pronunciation and syllabi- 
cation and immediately corrected recall. This should be supple- 
mented by intensive, interesting, snappy drills in which the spirit 
of competitive games gives zest to the learning and assures its 
effectiveness through frequent attentive repetitions. Follow-up 
tests should be given, to determine what words still present 
difficulties. 
We shall conclude the account with a few paragraphs on the 
fourth phase of the story. 
Section IV. How To MEASURE THE RESULTS OF 
SPELLING INSTRUCTION 
Less simple than measuring handwriting.—In the preced- 
ing chapter, on handwriting, we noted that scales of measure- 
ment were easily devised in that subject because of the simple, 
restricted nature of its subject matter ; namely, some seventy-five 
symbols which occur over and over in practicing handwriting. 
The task of devising scales for measuring the effectiveness of 
spelling instruction is much more complicated and difficult be- 
cause of the diversity of its subject matter ; namely, some four 
thousand common words and their varied frequency and difficulty.

SAMPLE COLUMNS FROM THE AYRES SPELLING SCALE 
This sample indicates that a standard fifth grade should average 66 per cent on 
column R, 58 per cent on column S, and 50 per cent on column T. A portion 
of column R is omitted here  
-P-A-G-E-84
  68 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
Scales. The Ayres scale tests ability to spell one thousand 
most common words.—The problem of testing spelling ability 
was first simplified by Dr. Leonard Ayres, who prepared a scale 
for measuring the ability of school children to spell the words in- 
cluded in his list of one thousand most commonly used English 
words (described on page 54). The construction of the scale 
and the assigning of precise mathematical values to the correct 
spelling of each word in each school grade involved elaborate 
testing and mathematical juggling with the results. Copies of the 
“Ayres Spelling Scale” may be secured from the Russell Sage 
Foundation, New York City, for a few cents apiece. An excel- 
lent interpretation of its use in measuring the effectiveness of 
the teaching of spelling in a school system is given by S. A. Cour- 
tis in his volume of the survey of the Gary schools, pp. 79-145 
(see number 7 in the bibliography at the end of this chapter). 
Advanced students of education will find Courtis’s discussion 
very helpful. It is too technical, however, to make further treat- 
ment of it here profitable for the beginning teacher. A simple 
ready-made scheme for teachers to use in giving tests based ona 
course of study derived from the Ayres scale is given by Courtis 
in his pamphlet on “Teaching Spelling by Plays and Games.” 
The Iowa scale.—The department of education at the Univer- 
sity of Iowa has devoted special attention to investigations of 
spelling instruction, and has derived what is probably the most 
valuable scale for teachers to use. The first step was W. N. 
Anderson’s determination of the 2977 words most commonly 
found in the correspondence of Iowa people. With this list to 
start with, E. J. Ashbaugh proceeded to test pupils with the 
words, arrange the latter in order of difficulty, divide them into 
groups, and ascertain the average scores made by different grades 
upon each group. The scale was then organized in the same 
general manner as the Ayres scale. One form is for the lower 
grades, one for the intermediate, and one for the upper. Every 
teacher should send ten cents for the form she needs to the 
address given in reference 5 at the end of this chapter.

  LEARNING TO SPELL 69 
Section V. THE Sc/zéncz AND THE ART OF TEACHING 
Science discovers truth through precise investigating.— 
In the chapters on handwriting and spelling we have encoun- 
tered a number of examples of scientific investigations in educa- 
tion made by such experts as Judd, Thorndike, Ayres, and 
Courtis, who used methods that are mathematically precise, 
objective, verifiable, and impartial. In the chapter on hand- 
writing (pp. 40-42) we described at length the nature of such 
educational research in order to give the reader an idea of 
the meaning of scientific investigations of teaching. The term 
“science of education” is very old, but it is coming to suggest 
more and more such reliable investigating, in contrast with 
unverified opinions about teaching, which anyone may express. 
The science of education, then, may be thought of as including 
in its work the discovering and proving of methods of teaching 
which eliminate wasteful effort and enable us to secure greater 
and more valuable educational returns for our expenditure of 
teaching-energy. 
Fine art of teaching consists in skilled technique.—The 
actual carrying on of truly valid teaching-processes in a skillful 
manner, on the other hand, constitutes the fine art of teaching. 
It is to this phase of education that the teacher devotes most 
of her thought and energy. Even after the best methods of 
teaching have been discovered and tested by scientific proce- 
dures, there always remains the need of such understanding and 
mastering of the detailed devices and practices. Just as we 
must have expert scientific investigators, so we must have ex- 
pert, artistic teachers. Each kind of expertness calls for a 
highly developed technique. Up to this point in our discussions 
we have given only a few examples of the fine art—the refined 
technique—of actual teaching. These occurred at the begin- 
ning of the chapter on handwriting, and in the spelling lessons 
described on pages 59-60. We preferred in these chapters to 
emphasize the scientific aspects of teaching, because greater
-P-A-G-E-86
  70 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
progress has been made in the scientific studies of handwriting 
and spelling than in many of the more complicated types of 
learning, to be discussed in later chapters. Thus, we were able 
to give the reader the scientific point of view early in the book, 
in order that she might be more open-minded, more scientific- 
minded, in considering some of the more debatable problems 
that will later arise. 
Fine art of teaching to be stressed in the following chapters on 
complex learning. —Having endeavored to establish this scien- 
tific point of view, we shall plan to emphasize the actual art of 
teaching to a greater extent in the later chapters dealing with 
more complicated learning processes, such as becoming skilled 
in silent reading, problem-solving, and expression. The com- 
plexity and difficulty of the teacher’s art increase with the 
complexity and difficulty of the learning processes of the pupils. 
For example, learning handwriting and spelling are relatively 
so simple that even very dull pupils may succeed with them 
under comparatively unskilled teachers. On the other hand, 
learning to use abstract ideas, such as rules in arithmetic and 
grammar, is so difficult that even capable pupils often flounder 
under average teachers. This greater difficulty calls for corre- 
sponding resourcefulness and skill in the teacher if success is 
to be attained. Our next chapter, which deals with beginning 
reading, will present a kind of teaching in which the learning 
is fairly complex, but in which the fine art of teaching has been 
developed probably more highly than in any other subject. 
For this reason the chapter will contain a very concrete descrip- 
tion of the actual reading lessons conducted by a skilled teacher 
at the very beginning of the first grade.

  CHAPTER V 
BEGINNING READING 
Main points of the chapter.—1. The technique of teaching be- 
ginning reading has been very highly perfected. 
2. Hence it is described here in detail as an example of the fine 
art of teaching. 
3. Several actual lessons conducted by a skilled teacher are de- 
scribed, and are followed by discussions of the principles which they 
illustrate. 
4. The first five weeks are devoted to blackboard-reading and 
chart-reading based on action words, incidental reading, and nursery 
rimes. 
5. These initiate the correct reading attitude of trying to get 
meaningful and interesting experiences from printed material. 
6. The general procedure is from a reading of the whole story 
to a study of individual lines and phrases and then to drill on 
individual words which are learned by sight. 
7. The skill acquired in five weeks of such reading enables the 
children to begin the reading of simple book material with fluency 
and comparative ease. 
8. Delightful, thrilling stories, covering several pages and con- 
taining many repeated phrases, enable the pupils to do page after 
page of reading and to complete many books, including primers and 
first readers, in the first year. 
9. Such practice with a familiar vocabulary gives skill in the 
fundamental interpretative reading habits. 
ro. After these are well started, training in the independent pho- 
netic analysis of new or unfamiliar words is systematically organized 
in separate periods. 
11. By the beginning of the second year children who have had 
the two lines of training described above are able (a) to read simple 
material fluently and with clear comprehension of its meanings and 
(b) accurately to analyze and to recognize new printed words within 
the range of their comprehension.

Section I. GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF First-GRADE 
ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING READING 
Highly developed technique of teaching first-grade read- 
ing.—The technique of teaching first-grade reading has probably 
been perfected more highly than any other phase of elementary 
teaching. Most of the published series of readers contain 
teachers’ manuals, which give directions for teaching each of the 
reading lessons during the first few months in the first grade. 
Many of these manuals contain excellent lessons, some of which 
we might have reproduced to give the inexperienced teacher 
a concrete idea of a skillful beginning in teaching reading.  
-P-A-G-E-90
  74 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
Actual example observed.—It seemed more instructive, how- 
ever, to present a description of the work of an actual teacher 
who uses a variety of materials and devices. Consequently I 
observed for some time, at the beginning of the year, the teach- 
ing of reading in a section of the first grade of the Elementary 
School of The University of Chicago. The teacher was Miss 
Marjorie Hardy. 
Beginning reading no longer the “scourge of infancy” but 
the road to fairyland.—I shall describe Miss Hardy’s teaching 
in considerable detail, in order to give the reader some feeling 
of the atmosphere of a modern schoolroom in which the fine art 
of teaching has been perfected through careful study and prac- 
tice. In such a situation learning to read is no longer the 
“scourge of infancy,” as Rousseau called it in 1762 and as it 
was still, in many places, a generation ago. Instead, our modern 
teaching early opens to children the road to the fairyland of 
fable, myth, romance, and adventure, as found in the world 
of children’s books. Every step that they take along this road 
under the teacher’s guidance is playful and delightful. At the 
same time, each step is a part of a most systematic and progres- 
sive scheme of learning, all parts of which have been definitely 
planned in advance. Yet so thoroughly are the various teaching 
processes adapted to the children’s instinctive interests and 
activities that delight in learning and systematic progress go 
hand in hand. 
Incidental reading. Connected with studies of home, farm, 
etc.—Since much of the reading in Miss Hardy’s room was 
intimately connected with other activities of the children, it is 
desirable to get an idea of the general course of study in the 
first grade, in order to understand the principles of teaching 
upon which the reading was based. The work of the first two 
or three months in this first grade was very much like that of an 
advanced kindergarten group, but with more specific training in 
reading and number. Like a progressive kindergarten, the first 
grade introduced children to a study of home and community
-P-A-G-E-91
  BEGINNING READING 75 
life through play, this being the first step in a progressive study 
of social life, which, as it continues through the grades, de- 
velops into the history, geography, and civics of the later years. 
The first social unit discussed was the home. The children 
talked about the rooms which they had in their own homes and 
the purposes that each served, saying, for example: ‘‘We cook in 
the kitchen. We eat in the dining-room. We sleep in the bed- 
room,” etc. Playrooms were constructed out of blocks or paper 
or cardboard. Each child chose a room, planned the necessary 
furniture, constructed it, described his plans and his work, etc. 
The little sentences quoted above were used incidentally for 
reading-material. 
The study of the home was followed by a study of farm life. 
The farmyard and its buildings, roads, and occupants were con- 
structed in a sand-pan after making the plan on a large sheet of 
manila paper with labels for the house, barn, road, etc. The story 
of the farmer bringing his crops to town or to the railroad for 
shipment was developed. Some of the products were followed 
into the grocery store, which was studied for a few days and 
linked up with the activities of the home. Thus the children were 
given a playful but thoughtful initiation into the study of social 
activities and the interdependence of various social units— 
families, farms, stores, etc.—in the community. In connection 
with these studies there was much incidental reading, counting, 
and measuring. 
Specific reading lessons. Begun with favorite nursery games 
and rimes.—In addition to these meaningful social studies, 
another type of kindergarten activity was extensively used in 
this first grade; namely, children’s games centering around 
nursery rimes and songs, such as “Jack, jump over the Candle- 
stick,” “Jack and Jill,” “The Old Cat is Asleep,” etc. These 
rhythmic but often nonsensical games and songs constitute one 
of the most characteristic and pleasurable features of child life ; 
and sometimes of adult life as well, as witnessed by the remark 
of a learned professor, a friend of mine, who said recently that 
 
-P-A-G-E-92
    
76 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
among his favorite verses and songs is ‘The Owl and the Pussy- 
cat went to Sea.” This he enjoys not only for its lilting rhythm 
but also for the sheer nonsense of its lines. In the kindergarten 
such nursery rimes are used in the form of games to train in 
physical activity, rhythmic control, singing, oral expression, codp- 
eration, etc. The same educational ends were served by these 
activities in the first grade. In addition, however, they fur- 
nished the subject matter for many of the reading lessons of 
the first few weeks. 
Fifteen minutes of specific reading plus much incidental 
reading.—With this general picture of work and play during 
the first few months in the first grade we may proceed to a 
description of the teaching of reading which I observed during 
the period set apart for it in the daily program. This period 
occupied about fifteen to twenty minutes in the morning. In 
addition to this specific period there was, as suggested above, 
much incidental reading throughout the day which I did not see; 
in fact, in conversation, Miss Hardy emphasized the fact that 
every activity during the day was made the basis of some read- 
ing. This might be a “line for the day” on the bulletin board 
in the morning (for example, “We plant our bulbs today”), 
a word here, a phrase or sentence there, etc. 
Even the specific reading period contains a variety of ac- 
tivities.—On the other hand, the intensive reading period of 
fifteen minutes did not consist of a mere continuous reading of 
one kind, but was broken up by a variety of activities, which will 
appear in the descriptions that follow. This variety is necessary 
in order to avoid the nervous strain, inattention, and consequent 
waste that result, with children of this age, from prolonged 
concern with a single form of intellectual activity. 
Homelike atmosphere of room puts children at ease.— 
Most of the children in Miss Hardy’s room had not been in 
the kindergarten, so the first day’s activities were especially 
arranged to make the little ones feel at home and comfortable 
and contented in the strange, new environment. Blocks, balls,  
-P-A-G-E-93
  BEGINNING READING 77 
dolls, and other playthings were on hand, and a general “homy” 
atmosphere was created. The effect of one item was noted in 
the remark of a child who told his mother, ‘We have curtains 
in our room at school just like we have at home.” 
Section II. Pre-Primer BLACKBOARD-READING AND 
CHaART-READING 
A. Sample Lessons 
Action words and games provide first reading material. 
—The first reading experiences were given in connection with 
the following action words: “run,” “hop,” “skip,” “jump.” 
These were written on the board and taught by means of a 
game in which one child “blinded” his eyes in a corner, and 
another child ran to the board, pointed to a word (for ex- 
ample, “hop”, whispered it to the teacher, hopped to his seat, 
and said, “Ready.” Thereupon the child in the corner said, 
“T heard you hop” (provided he guessed right), and ran to the 
blackboard and pointed to the word “hop.” These activities 
performed frequently during the day were fun for the children 
and provided relaxation and physical exercise for them. When 
the children had to go to the board or to any other part of the 
room, the teacher frequently wrote “hop” or “skip” etc. on the 
blackboard, and the children used the corresponding method 
of locomotion. 
First nursery rime from books which children have ex- 
amined. “Jack, be nimble.’—On the fourth day of school 
the teacher introduced during the reading period the nursery 
rime Jack, be nimble, Jack, be quick, 
Jack, jump over 
The candlestick. 
The children had been examining various books of nursery 
rimes and stories which reposed on the “library table” at one
-P-A-G-E-94
  78 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
side of the room. Miss Hardy then asked some children to - 
show her their favorite rimes and then skillfully centered 
their attention on one which was especially suitable for an easy 
reading lesson; namely, “Jack, jump over the Candlestick.”

MURAL DECORATION FOR A FIRST-GRADE ROOM 
Attractive nursery pictures like the above are frequently found in first-grade 
rooms. They may be framed, or painted on the walls, or even painted on the 
transoms, so as to give the effect of stained-glass windows. They furnish 
excellent subject matter for reading and language lessons 
Games played with candlestick and at blackboard.—A candle- 
stick having been provided for the occasion, it was brought out, 
and the children played a game of jumping over it, meanwhile 
becoming more familiar with the rime. Miss Hardy then said 
she knew another way of playing the game, in which all could
-P-A-G-E-95
    BEGINNING READING 79 
play at once. The children wondered how it could be done, 
and the teacher showed them how to represent a candlestick on 
the blackboard with the chalk, and by curved lines how to show 
Jack jumping back and forth (as pictured on page 15). The chil- 
dren exhibited considerable individuality in their drawings of the 
candlestick, some adding a little curved handle, others adding the 
flame with smoke trailing off. They practiced the rhythmic 
sweeps, back and forth, while reciting the rime in unison. 
Pupils tell teacher how to write rime on blackboard.—Fi- 
nally Miss Hardy said: ‘“‘Wouldn’t it be fun to have this rime 
written on the blackboard so that we could all see it and read it 
instead of having just one copy in the book? ... I will write 
it, but you must help me by telling me just what to say... . 
Who can tell me what to write first?” A boy said, “Jack, be 
nimble.” Miss Hardy wrote this line, and then proceeded to 
write the other lines as the children dictated them. This process 
exemplified the finest art in teaching the first reading lesson 
with continuous material. Why? We shall see when we come 
to the systematic discussion (which follows this story) of the 
principles of teaching first-grade reading. Meanwhile we shall 
note that the end of the reading period had arrived, and Miss 
Hardy told the children she would write “Save” on the black- 
board, to tell the janitor not to erase their rime until they 
wanted him to. 
Great detail of fine technique illustrated by fuller descrip- 
tions.—In order to illustrate how many devices and varied 
processes are included in the initial teaching of reading, we shall 
describe in somewhat greater detail the reading lessons which 
followed the first presentation of the rime as described above. 
Some of these devices illustrate not only the teaching of reading 
itself but also the intimate correlation with other activities and 
procedures in order to avoid fatigue and inattention. \ 
Second day with “Jack, be nimble.” Reading from large 
printed chart.—The next day, at the beginning of the reading 
period, the class counted’ in concert the number of children
-P-A-G-E-96
  80 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
present in the group, and one child then counted out the ap- 
propriate number of little chairs and arranged them in a semi- 
circle at the front of the room, not far from the blackboard. 
The teacher then wrote “skip” on the board, and the children

“LITTLE MISS MUFFET” USED TO DECORATE THE WALLS OF A 
FIRST-GRADE ROOM 
Sometimes such decorations are painted by the students in the art classes of 
the local high school 
skipped gayly to their places. When they were settled and at- 
tentive, the teacher recalled the rime of the day before, asking 
them how many lines were in it, and reminded them that she had 
written “Save” on the board. She then said: “I have a surprise 
for you today. I had the rime, with a picture, printed on a chart
-P-A-G-E-97
BEGINNING READING 81 
[which she then hung before them], so that the janitor could 
clean the blackboard. Let’s see whether we can all read the rime 
from the chart just as we did from the blackboard yesterday.” 
Group reading of whole rime.— Miss Hardy then held a long 
strip of cardboard under each line as she and the children read 
it in unison. 
Individual reading of whole rime.—Several children were 
then given a chance to read the rime individually, while the 
teacher moved the cardboard strip down. 
“Show us the line that says.”—The teacher then asked, 
‘“Who can run up and show us the line that says ‘The candle- 
stick’ ?>—Margery.” Margery held the strip of cardboard un- 
‘der the right line. “Who sees the line that says ‘Jack, be 
nimble’ ?— Richard.” 
Duplicate chart cut into lines and inserted in a rack.—Miss 
Hardy then brought out a duplicate chart of the rime. She 
said: ‘Here I have another copy of the chart, without the pic- 
ture. See whether it looks the same . . . four lines . . . ‘Jack, 
be nimble’ . . . just thesame. Do you think it would be fun to 
cut off each line and have a child put it where it belongs in this 
rack ?” Here Miss Hardy indicated a rack which hung on the 
blackboard and was so constructed that cardboard strips could 
be easily inserted. With appropriate remarks each line was cut 
off and given to a different child, who was assisted in placing it in 
therack. With the last line the teacher said: “‘Isn’t ‘candlestick’ 
along word ? We can easily tell it because it is so long.” 
Game of finding corresponding lines in the two charts— 
“Now,” said Miss Hardy, “I am going to give you a new game. 
I am going to take a line out of the rack while you have your 
eyes shut. Then you look to see which line is missing and find 
the same line on the other chart. Be sure to study it out before 
you raise your hand. Now, blind your eyes.”

outh Chart and is sold by the Plymouth Press, 6749 Wentworth Avenue, 
Chicago, Illinois.
-P-A-G-E-98
82 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
Taking out the strip “Jack, be quick,” the teacher said, 
“Ready.” After giving most of the children time to raise their 
hands, John was called on. “What line is it?” ‘Jack, be 
quick,” said John. ‘“That’s right; now match it up on the full 
chart (that is, hold it under the line that says the same thing) 
and then put it back where it belongs in the rack.” 
The game was then repeated with the third line, “Jack, 
jump over.” The child who was called on said it read ‘Jack, 
be quick.” The teacher then assisted him to read the complete 
chart from the beginning until he came to and recognized the 
correct line. The game was continued until all the lines had 
been used. 
Game of giving children lines from rack and recalling and 
replacing them.—‘‘Now we shall play another game,” said Miss 
Hardy. “I shall give each line to a different child, and when I 
call for that line the child who has it must run up and match it 
on the whole chart and then place it where it belongs in the 
rack.” After the strips were handed out, she asked, “Who has 
the first line?” The child who had it was not sure, although 
her neighbor, looking over her shoulder, volunteered “I know 
who has.”’ “Florence,” said the teacher, “I think you have. 
Run up and match it... . That’s it. What does itsay? ... 
Put it in place”—and so on until all the strips were returned, 
the children being more successful as they grasped the idea of 
the game. 
Test shows that children know location but not form of a 
word.—The period was now almost over. A little test, or dem- 
onstration, of what the children knew and did not know came 
when Miss Hardy said: “I see the word ‘Jack’ some other 
place in this room. I wonder who can find it.” The children 
looked around and located a picture, cut from a magazine, show- 
ing a boy going to school with his father. Under the picture Miss 
Hardy had printed on a card in large letters 
This is Jack. 
He is going to school. 
 
-P-A-G-E-99
BEGINNING READING 83 
One of the children who volunteered was asked to hold a short 
strip of cardboard under- the word “Jack.” Instead he held it 
under “This is.” Why? Because, in the rime, “Jack” was al- 
ways at the beginning of the line, and this child ‘had an idea of 
its location but not of its form. ‘Come to the rime and find 
‘Jack,’” said Miss Hardy. “That’s right. Now look at it closely 
and then find the same word on the other card.” This time the 
child succeeded easily, and the class was turned over to the 
gymnasium teacher for a period of outdoor play. 
Third day with “Jack, be nimble”; beginning “Jack and 
Jill.” Review reading of rime and lines.—The next day, after 
the children had “hopped” to their chairs, the rime was reviewed 
as follows: 
First, individual children were given a chance to read the 
whole chart through, advancing to it and holding a long strip of 
cardboard under each line as it was read. 
Miss Hardy then inserted the separate lines in the rack as she 
got responses to her questions: ‘What will the line say that I 
put in first?” ‘What will the next line say ?” 
Pupil becomes “teacher” in game of blinding eyes and guess- 
ing removed line.—Miss Hardy then said: ‘“‘Wouldn’t it be fun 
to play again the game in which you blind your eyes and some- 
body takes out a strip and you find which one it is? . . . Only, 
this time we shall let a child be the teacher.” She then called on 
a child, who advanced to the rack. The game then proceeded as 
follows: (1) The child said, ‘Blind your eyes”; (2) took out 
a line; (3) whispered to the teacher what the line said; and 
(4) said, “Ready.” (5) The children held up their hands ; (6) 
the child called on Mary; (7) Mary named the right line, was 
given the strip, “‘matched”’ it with the corresponding line on the 
full chart, returned it to the rack, and in turn became the 
“teacher.” Three children were given turns in this game. 
Blackboard activity for all in rhythmic drawing to rime.— 
“Now,” said Miss Hardy, “let’s all go to the blackboard and 
make Jack jump over the candlestick. I have marked off spaces
-P-A-G-E-100
84 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
for children on the side board. Count the spaces. How many 
are there? ... How many children are there? ... How 
many more spaces do we need? . . . All right; I will mark off 
four more on the front board.” The children then went to the 
board. They were asked each to show his right hand and left 
hand (some were not sure which was which), to take the chalk 
in the right hand, to draw a candlestick in the middle of the 
space, and then to start the chalk at the left side of the space 
and to draw as they recited the rime (producing the result 
described on page 15). 
“Jack and Jill.” Told by children and played at blackboard. 
—The children then returned to their seats, and the teacher 
said: “I am thinking of another verse that has ‘Jack’ in it. Can 
you think of one? Mine begins ‘Jack and,’” whereupon several 
of the children were ready immediately with “Jill went up the 
hill” etc. ‘Who will show us at the blackboard the hill, with 
Jack and Jill going up and tumbling down, something like the 
way we showed Jack jumping over the candlestick?” The chil- 
dren then drew curves on the board as described on page 15 
in our discussion of handwriting. 
Written on blackboard by teacher as children dictate.—Then 
the pupils returned to their chairs, and the teacher suggested 
that she write the rime on the board and prepare a chart of it for 
the next day. They first recited the rime in unison, and then 
Miss Hardy said she would write it as they told her what to 
write. “What shall I write first?” The children said, “Jack 
and Jill went up the hill.” This was written as two short 
lines ; thus: yack anceyil 
Went up the hill. 
The children eagerly anticipated each succeeding line and volun- 
teered joyful remarks about “how long” some of the lines were. 
Children read rime while running pointer under each line.— 
A few minutes remained for reading the whole rime through, 
one child, with Miss Hardy’s assistance, running a pointer along
-P-A-G-E-101
  BEGINNING READING 85 
under each line as it was read. “Tomorrow,” said the teacher, 
“‘we shall have this rime printed for you on a chart.” 
Fourth day of rime-reading: chart of “Jack and Jill.” 
Free conversation about the picture.—When the chart was dis- 
played the next day the children volunteered various remarks 
about the picture which was at the top, such as: “Jack is tum- 
bling down.” “Jill hasn’t tumbled yet.” Miss Hardy added 
comments about the “heavy pail of water,” the “steep hill,” etc. 
Chart read as in case of “Jack, be nimble.” —The chart was 
then read in a manner similar to the reading of the candlestick 
chart, as suggested briefly in the following memoranda: 
1. Whole in unison.—“‘Let’s all read it together,” said Miss 
Hardy, and the children proceeded as she held a long strip of 
cardboard under each line. 
2. Whole by one pupil ; praise for good reading.—“ Florence, 
come and read. Hold the cardboard under each line... . 
That’s fine. We can always hear Florence, because she reads 
so clearly.” 
3. “Finding the line that says.” Mild rebuke for irresponsi- 
ble child.—‘Who sees the line that says ‘Went up the hill’ ?” 
Mary’s hand being up, she was called on but was not ready. 
“You must always see the line before you hold up your hand.” 
Several lines were practiced in this way, a child advancing, 
placing the cardboard under the desired line, and reading it. 
4. Inserting separate strips in rack. Children on watch for mis- 
takes.—“‘Now, all stand up. Here I have each line on a sepa- 
rate strip. . . . Let’s see whether I have enough. How many 
lines are on the chart? . . . Count my strips. . . . Which one 
must I put in first? . . . Now I am going to put in the others 
rapidly, and you must watch to see that I don’t make any mis- 
takes.” Miss Hardy then purposely inserted “broke his crown” 
before “Jack fell down.” The brighter children soon discovered 
this and suggested the correct change. Seats were then resumed. 
5. Blinding eyes and finding removed line.—They then played 
twice the game of having the class blind their eyes while one
-P-A-G-E-102
  86 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
child took out of the rack a line which the class then proceeded 
to discover on the chart. 
New stage: learning individual words. Children match 
word cards with words in rime.—The teaching then proceeded 
to an entirely new stage as Miss Hardy produced a pack of cards 
upon each of which was printed a word in large letters. The 
words were “Jack,” “went,” “hill,” “water,” “up,” . “down,” 
“fell,” “after,” and “over,” the last word being borrowed from 
the candlestick rime. She said: ‘You see these cards. They 
are not lines. They are just words. Some are taken from the 
first line, some are from the second line. John, here is one for 
you. Your word is in the first line. See if you can find it. 
Florence, your word is in the second line.” Each child was 
given a card until all were supplied. ‘Study your line carefully 
to find a word that looks just like yours. As soon as you can 
find it raise your hand. . . .. All right. Hands down. We will 
begin with Arthur. When I call your name run up to the chart, 
hold your card under the right word, and tell us what it is. 
Now, Arthur.” 
Match correctly but cannot name. Reading as far as matched 
word.—Arthur matched correctly the word “went” in the first 
line; but when Miss Hardy asked, “What does it say?” he 
couldn’t tell. By reading the line from the beginning, however, 
he easily found what it said. The next child matched “hill” 
correctly, but called it ‘Jill.’ Miss Hardy helped her to point to 
each word from the beginning of the rime as teacher and child 
read rapidly and smoothly as far as “hill.” The next child was 
taught “up” in the same way. ‘All watch carefully,” said Miss 
Hardy, “for you may have to find this same word later.” 
Flash drill with cards called ““moving-picture show.” —The 
period then concluded with a rapid “flashing” of the cards by 
the teacher, a game which the class called their moving-picture 
show.” “Remember,” said the teacher, “as I bring each card 
from the back of the pack you watch it carefully, and just a9 
soon-as I place it on the front, you tell me what it is.”
-P-A-G-E-103
  BEGINNING READING 87 
Fifth day of rime-reading. Principally drill games: with 
word cards and rime chart—After the preliminaries of get- 
ting seated the next day Miss Hardy said: “I have so many 
games for you today that we must do them quickly. First we 
will read the whole rime. We will let Alice do it, because she 
has such a good, clear voice.” 
After this reading the class played very briefly “finding the 
line which says.” 
Each child given a word card to match and name. Appro- 
priate praise and remarks on hygiene.—Next, each child was 
given a word card and-told to find the same word in a given 
line on the chart. When all had their hands up except two 
children, Miss Hardy said to these: ‘You watch, and we will 
help you later. Hands down.” And the game proceeded as on 
the day before. Incidental remarks were made about keeping 
the cards away from the mouth and face and holding them cor- 
rectly. To the child who had “Jack” Miss Hardy said, “See how 
many ‘Jacks’ you can find,” and, when he had. found four, ex- 
claimed, ‘Good for you !”? When a boy found the word “water” 
quickly and said it, appropriate praise was bestowed. Then to 
the class she said, ‘Everyone look at this word and say it.” 
Special devices for some words.—To the cards for “up” and 
“down” special attention was called. “Children, look at these 
two words. The short one is ‘up,’ and the longer one is ‘down.’ 
When you play seesaw you go up and down [making appro- 
priate gestures with the corresponding word card]. I am going 
to mix these two words up. See if you can tell me quickly 
which one I show you” [proceeding to flash “up” and “down” 
several times]. Similarly, devices were employed with the 
words “after” and “over,” which were giving special difficulty. 
“ Moving-picture show” game again.—The children then stood 
up while the “‘moving-picture show” game was run off by flash- 
ing the cards. 
Teacher inserts individual words in rack as pupils name 
each.—The children being seated, Miss Hardy said: ‘Now I
-P-A-G-E-104

am going to put these words in the rack. They will be all mixed 
up, and as soon as I place a word I want you to tell me 
what it is.” 
Naming each word as teacher points. Pupils on qui vive for 
speed.—This process finished, Miss Hardy said: ‘As I place an 
eraser under each word, say it. See if you can say it so fast that 
I can hardly keep ahead of you. . . . That’s fine, but if you 
don’t know them, don’t say them.” 
One pupil points to all the words and names them correctly. 
Children clap approval.—‘Now, Harry may say all the words 
as he holds the eraser under each. . . . Wasn’t that fine? He 
said every word right. Let’s clap for him.” 
Blinding the eyes and then finding the word pointed to.— 
The reading lesson then concluded with a new “blind the eyes” 
game. One child blinded his eyes in the corner. Another ran 
to the rack, held an eraser under one word (for example, 
“over”), returned to his seat, and said, ‘“‘Ready.’”’ The child 
in the corner stepped to the rack and, placing the eraser under 
each word in turn, said, “Is it ‘water’?” In unison the chil- 
dren answered, “No, it is not ‘water,’”—and so on until he 
said, “Is it ‘over’?” whereupon they clapped their hands and 
cried, ‘Yes, it is ‘over.’” 
“The Old Cat is Asleep” game ; activity, fun, moral training. 
—As a matter of relaxation and physical activity the teacher 
then introduced the children to a game that seemed to the ob- 
server to be merely a child’s game (that is, not a game for 
teaching reading) ; namely, a game called “The Old Cat is 
Asleep.” This is a form of the musical-chair game. The chil- 
dren played it twice with zest, and as some of them tended to 
run to the chairs before the last word of “cannot catch us” 
was said, Miss Hardy made an appropriate remark about 
“playing fair.” 
Nine separate words learned by sight.—-Subtracting such re- 
laxation activities, about fifteen minutes of actual reading ac- 
tivity had been observed. The children had acquired by this
-P-A-G-E-105
  BEGINNING READING 89 
time greater familiarity with the printed lines, and knew with 
fair accuracy the nine separate words which scarcely any of 
them had been able to name shortly before the end of the read- 
ing period of the previous day. 
Sixth day of rime-reading. “The old cat is asleep.”— 
Unexpectedly to the observer the next day’s reading period be- 
gan with the new game, “The Old Cat is Asleep,” which had 
been played the day before. After playing the game again, 
Miss Hardy produced a chart with the picture of the “old cat” 
and the lines ; The old cat is asleep, 
The old cat is asleep, 
The old cat is fast asleep, 
And cannot catch us. 
Strips cut up before the children’s eyes to obtain phrases and 
words.—In the reading lesson based on this material the class 
followed the same plan as in the preceding ones; namely, first 
reading it as a whole, then finding individual lines, then drilling 
on single phrases and words. This time Miss Hardy cut up the 
separate strips or lines before the children’s eyes to obtain the 
individual word cards. 
Examples of special aid to slow pupils.—This process helped 
some of the children considerably, for while some had succeeded 
admirably in every activity, from reading the whole to match- 
ing and naming individual words, other children were making 
very slow progress. For example, one child could not under- 
stand the term “last word.” Miss Hardy said to him, “Tell me 
the last word in this line,” as she pointed to and read “The old 
cat is fast asleep.”” The child said, “The old cat is fast asleep.” 
“No, dear,” said Miss Hardy, “I want just the last word. Now 
listen for it, as I say the line.” The teacher repeated the line, 
pointing to each word in turn. Again from the child came the 
same answer, “The old cat is fast asleep.” 
Another example of the reaction of a slow child occurred in 
identifying the word “old.” The child had been given the word
-P-A-G-E-106
  go TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
card for “old” and was trying to match it on either chart—the 
whole one or the cut-up one in the rack. He had five chances, 
—five.“olds” before his eyes,—and he couldn’t find one. Miss 
Hardy took the phrase “The old cat” from the rack. She read 
it with the child. Then she cut off ‘‘The” and asked what was 
left. Then she cut off “cat” and asked what was left. The child 
said “old” and seemed to be sure of it. He matched it correctly 
with the five “olds” which remained in the chart and rack. 
Miss Hardy then gave the work a “forward look” (a device 
which she frequently used) by saying to the class, ‘When we 
come to read in our storybooks we want to be sure about this 
word ‘old’ because we shall read about the old woman, the 
old man, and the old cat many times.” After about two minutes 
of practice, or “game,” with the last line, “And cannot catch 
us,” Miss Hardy returned to the child who had been given 
special practice with “old.” Holding up the “old” card she 
asked, ‘“What does this say?” ‘Can,” said the boy. Such are 
the difficulties encountered by and with slow learners,—diffi- 
culties that call for the most watchful, sympathetic, patient, 
and persistent individual attention from the teacher. 
Subsequent specific reading lessons with other types of 
material. “Goldilocks and the Three Bears.’—When the 
rime-reading described above was being carried on during 
the reading periods, the children had been concerned during the 
literature and construction periods with the experiences of 
Goldilocks and the three bears. The pupils had constructed in 
the sand-pan a paper house for the three bears and had sur- 
rounded it with twigs and leaves to represent a forest through 
which roamed, hand in hand, three plasticene bears. 
Manila-paper book of reading selections made by each child 
to show parents——Each child had also made a book from 
manila paper in which to paste the verses and stories which the 
class had been reading “so they could take them home to read 
to mamma and papa.” Each child’s copy of a jingle or story 
was printed by Miss Hardy, who set up rubber letters in a
-P-A-G-E-107
    
BEGINNING READING or 
wooden type-holder, thus making a rubber stamp from which 
the necessary copies could be easily made. 
Pupils compose story of the Three Bears to paste in book.— 
When it came to putting the story of the Three Bears in the 
books the class spent some time in boiling it down to a few 
short lines that would best tell just what they had done. They 
finally chose these: 
We made a house. 
It is in the woods. 
We made three bears. 
One is a big bear. 
One is a middle-sized bear. 
One is a little bear. 
Reading practice with this material as with nursery rimes.— 
The reading practice with this material followed the same gen- 
eral lines as those described for the nursery rimes. 
Five weeks of gameful pre-primer blackboard and chart- 
reading to initiate correct reading attitudes and habits.— 
Such gameful chart-reading, gradually merging with reading of 
the same materials pasted in the books which they made, con- 
stituted the reading activity of the first five or six weeks. It is 
one example of the common practice in progressive schools and 
reading-systems of giving considerable “pre-primer” reading be- 
fore a regularly printed book is begun. So many fundamental 
principles of psychology and methods of teaching reading are 
involved that we shall now turn to the systematic exposition of 
them as illustrated by Miss Hardy’s lessons. Then we shall de- 
scribe concretely the second and third stages in developing skill 
in reading; namely, training in reading a printed book and 
training in the independent recognition of new words. The first 
stage, with which we are now concerned, is intended to initiate 
certain correct reading attitudes and habits which may persist 
throughout the pupils’ later reading in and out of school.
-P-A-G-E-108
  92 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
B. Principles of Pre-Primer Blackboard-Reading and 
Chart-Reading 
1. To initiate correct reading attitudes, not mere word- 
calling.— Perhaps the most fundamental principle of teaching 
reading which is illustrated by Miss Hardy’s pre-primer lessons 
is the necessity of giving the pupils a correct attitude toward 
the reading material. We may easily illustrate what we mean 
by using a negative example; namely, we do not want the child 
to form the attitude of merely trying to pronounce words with- 
out regard to their meanings. Yet this was the dominant 
attitude of first-grade children in much of the old-fashioned 
teaching of reading, in which a child stood up with a book in 
his hand and, with his eyes glued in turn upon each word, halt- 
ingly read, “This—is—a—cat.” 
Varieties of reading attitudes: poetry versus headlines ; 
“funnies” versus Gettysburg Address.—Just how to define or 
describe the correct initial reading attitude is slightly difficult 
because the attitudes with different types of reading material 
differ somewhat. -For example, contrast the attitudes in read- 
ing poetry and in rapidly scanning a newspaper column. In 
the poetry-reading your attitude is likely to include enjoying 
the lilt and swing of the rhythm, and your reading, conse- 
quently, will include careful rhythmic phrasing; in the news- 
paper-scanning your attitude is one of neglecting much of the 
material and actively “grabbing off” a few ideas or statements. 
Another example of contrasting attitudes in reading is found 
in reading the “funnies” in the newspaper, as compared with 
reading Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address. We do not need to de- 
scribe the different attitudes in these two cases, since they are 
so obviously different. The emotional “set” of our mind in the 
case of reading the “funnies” is such that it shocks us to think 
of approaching Lincoln’s address with the same attitude. 
Getting meaningful and interesting experiences from the ear- 
liest reading.—These variations in reading attitudes become
-P-A-G-E-109
BEGINNING READING 93 
of very great practical importance in training in skilled read- 
ing; for example, training a pupil to enjoy reading poetry in- 
volves a very different type of practice from training him to 
scan anewspaper column. As related to training in various types 
of skilled silent reading, variations in reading attitudes will be 
made the basis of the discussion in a later chapter. For our pres- 
ent purposés it is sufficient to note that perhaps the biggest 
factor in determining Miss Hardy’s method of approaching read- 
ing is the desire to make it as much like real reading as possible 
from the very beginning. In such real reading the attitude of 
getting some type of meaningful and interesting experience 
from the printed material is a dominant feature. 
2. Meaningful content necessary. Action words ; incidental 
reading.—In order to develop the attitude of getting meaning 
from printed material it is necessary to select content that is 
especially suited to the purpose. The simple action words with 
which Miss Hardy began furnish an admirable example, for 
when such words as “hop” or “skip” are written on the board 
as commands, not only does the attention center on the meaning 
but the pupil must grasp the meaning before he can execute the 
command. Similarly, when such words as “barn” or “ house” 
appear on the plan of the farm which is to be made in the 
sand-pan, the attention naturally centers on their meaning. 
Nursery rimes give a complex experience which constitutes 
their meaning.—When we come to the nursery rimes, however, 
the meanings to be had from the reading become much more 
complex, since the whole complex experience of a child’s en- 
joyment of a nursery rime is involved. This experience con- 
sists of much more than understanding the individual words or 
even understanding all the phrases. This fact may be illus- 
trated by my friend’s enjoyment of ‘The Owl and the Pussy- 
cat went to Sea” (described on page 75), or by the reading 
experience of another professorial friend, who says that at least 
once a year he gets hungry to read a certain one of Poe’s 
poems, and consequently has read it many times. “Yet,” he  
-P-A-G-E-110
    04 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
adds, “for the life of me I can’t tell what Poe is talking about 
in some places in the thing.” Similarly, in teaching children to 
read “Jack and Jill” we are concerned primarily in giving them 
the big reading experiences which children naturally get from 
such material. Necessarily this will include an understanding 
of most of the words and phrases, such as “went up the hill” 
and “came tumbling after.” The picture above the rime helped 
some children to get these ideas. It would hardly be desir- 
able, however, to dwell at any length on the meaning of “broke 
his crown.” In fact, I have often wondered what notion a child 
associates with this phrase. Certainly it would not be pleasing 
to give him a vivid, gruesome picture of a child with a real 
broken head. 
Hence “meaningful content” and “meaningful experience” 
need broad interpretation.—These simple examples help us to 
get farther and farther away from the practice of mere word- 
pronouncing as characteristic of reading. Not only are we 
dissatisfied with mere word-pronouncing but also with mere 
understanding of isolated words and phrases. What we need in 
the reading of continuous material, from the very first lessons, 
is the grasp of large meanings—the enjoyment of complex ex- 
periences which go far beyond the meanings of the individual 
words that relate them. Among the most characteristic of such 
experiences in childhood are those associated with nursery rimes. 
By introducing these early into the reading we are providing the 
child with meaningful content the total significance of which he 
readily grasps and the detailed words and phrases of which he 
sufficiently understands. 
3. Delightful content cultivates the desire to read.—The 
reading attitude which we should endeavor to cultivate in chil- 
dren includes not only the tendency to grasp the meaning of 
printed material but also an active desire to read more and 
more. We want the pupil to feel that reading furnishes delight- 
ful experiences. We want to cultivate in him the tendency to 
take up books and read them with the same spontaneity and
-P-A-G-E-111
BEGINNING READING 95 
zeal with which he enters into games, or with the same entranced 
delight with which he listens to a story that is being told. This 
furnishes another reason for the choice of interesting nur- 
sery rimes or such stories as “Goldilocks and the Three Bears.” 
When we come to the primer-reading we shall see how thor- 
oughly this idea is being carried out by filling the books with 
all the treasures of childhood’s fairyland of myth and fable, 
adventure and romance. 
4. Get the whole thought or experience, then subdivide 
for reading practice.—From the ideas expressed above— 
namely, that reading, from the very beginning, should present 
meaningful, interesting experiences to children—it follows natu- 
rally that the reading of any one selection should begin with its 
fundamental story features. After these have been adequately 
treated, then the content may be subdivided for a number of 
forms of reading practice. In Miss Hardy’s lessons we find the 
following steps are taken in proceeding from the whole story to 
the study of individual words: 
a. The pupils learn the whole nursery rime, or compose orally 
the whole story of Goldilocks in the exact words in which it is 
later to be read. 
b. They tell the teacher exactly how to write the whole story 
on the board. 
c. They read the story as a whole. 
d. They learn to recognize individual lines and phrases. 
e. They learn to recognize and remember the individual 
words. 
The lessons which we have described show that much of the 
refined technique of teaching pre-primer reading depends upon 
the skillful carrying-out of the above processes in the order 
indicated. The prospective teacher of first-grade reading should 
study Miss Hardy’s devices from this point of view, in great de- 
tail. For our more general purposes we may note briefly three 
features of her practice; namely, (1) the careful preparation 
before presenting the printed or written whole, (2) the ability
-P-A-G-E-112
  96 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
and training of pupils to recognize individual lines and phrases, 
(3) the necessity and value of familiarizing them with indi- 
‘vidual words. 
Careful preparation before reading includes exact memorizing 
of first rimes or stories.—The exact memorizing of the rime or 
story before reading it is necessary in order that there may be 
no confusion when the reading begins. For example, when the 
children first recited “Jack and Jill” some of them said “fetch 
a pail of water” and others said “get a pail of water.” By 
adopting one of these and discarding the other the chance for 
a confusing association was avoided. Moreover, in the case of 
children from illiterate or poor or nonliterary families there are 
sure to be some who are unfamiliar with the rime. The result 
of such careful preparation is that all the children have the full 
meaning and oral statement exactly in mind and are intensely 
interested in telling the teacher what to write. They are thus 
prepared to read it as an interesting, meaningful whole. As sug- 
gested on page 79, this constitutes one of the finest points in 
the expert teaching of the first lessons in reading and is in 
striking contrast with the child’s first experiences in the old- 
fashioned teaching of reading, in which he haltingly attacked 
individual words and struggled through hours of meaningless 
drudgery. 
Children may easily learn to recognize short phrases as wholes. 
An important reading attitude.—After the whole rime or story 
had been written or printed we found that Miss Hardy conducted 
a number of games in which the children handled, read, and 
recognized individual lines or phrases. The possibility of recog- 
nizing such units has long been a well-known fact to psychol- 
ogists and is easily proved by the success of the children in doing 
it. The justification for making it the second step in the reading 
of the rime is the desire to train pupils to think in such large 
meaningful units while reading. This is another factor in es- 
tablishing correct reading attitudes which we have emphasized 
throughout the discussion. In skilled continuous reading we do
-P-A-G-E-113
BEGINNING READING 97 
not read by words alone, but rather in units of meaning of which 
the single words are merely the skeleton structure. While the 
beginning pupil must go through many years of practice before 
he can reach the general facility in phrase recognition that 
characterizes the skillful, trained reader, yet he can learn some 
phrases at the very beginning and, more important still, can 
make the modest beginnings of a reading attitude, or reading 
habit, which will prove of vital importance later. An interesting 
bit of detail in Miss Hardy’s technique which illustrates her 
careful thought about the pupils’ possibilities in phrase recog- 
nition is found in her writing of the first lines of “ Jack and Jill” 
as described on page 84. When the children told her to write 
“Jack and Jill went up the hill,” she skillfully broke it into 
two lines; thus: 
Jack and Jill 
Went up the hill. 
It is obvious that the two phrase units which are thus secured 
are much better suited for recognition by beginning readers than 
the single long line in which they were combined. 
Word recognition necessary and possible.—It is obvious, how- 
ever, that we need to go further than phrase recognition and 
familiarize the pupil with individual words in order that he may 
use these as tools wherever they appear in his reading. For ex- 
ample, the child who has learned the word “Jack” in “Jack, 
be nimble” can use it as an aid in learning “Jack and Jill.” 
Similarly, he can use other single words from one rime or story 
in reading later ones, such as “ the” and “and.” The possibility 
of learning such individual words “by sight” is another item 
ascertained by the psychologists at the same time that they 
found out about phrase recognition. The obvious success of chil- 
dren in doing it leaves no doubt of the possibility. During their 
pre-primer reading in Miss Hardy’s room most of the children 
became thoroughly familiar with many sight words which they 
could recognize and use in reading new material.
-P-A-G-E-114
  98 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
Four principles summarized: correct attitudes, meaningful 
content, desire to read, analytical learning —The four princi- 
ples of teaching reading which we have discussed up to this 
point may be summarized as follows: 
1. Pre-primer reading should initiate the correct reading atti- 
tude of trying to get meaningful and interesting experiences 
from printed or written material. 
2. To cultivate this attitude, a content, such as action words 
and nursery rimes, should be selected which entices the pupils 
to focus their attention upon the meanings. 
3. The attitude of desiring to read is also initiated by the 
intense interest which children attach to nursery rimes and 
stories. 
4. Inbeginning the reading of any selection the whole thought 
or experience should receive first attention, and the material 
should then be subdivided into phrases and individual words 
for reading practice. 
Phrased more concisely, these principles may be stated as 
follows. In pre-primer reading 
1. Initiate correct reading attitudes. 
2. Provide meaningful content. 
3. Create a desire to read through delightful content. 
4. In beginning the reading of any selection get the whole 
thought first and then subdivide for reading practice. 
These points describe the method of approaching reading that 
is securing more and more general adoption in progressive ele- 
mentary schools. We shall now consider certain further general 
principles of teaching as they apply to the teaching of reading 
and were illustrated in Miss Hardy’s lessons. 
5. A single center of attention is secured by chart-reading 
and blackboard-reading.—When a class has its first reading 
lessons from a book instead of the blackboard or a chart, it is dif- 
ficult for the teacher to make sure that the children are all giving 
their attention to the line or phrase or word which is being dis- 
cussed. On the other hand, with the material on the blackboard
-P-A-G-E-115
BEGINNING READING 99 
or on a chart it is easy for the teacher or child to point to a 
certain portion of it and direct the attention of all interested 
pupils to the same item. This is one of the greatest advantages 
of using a blackboard in any kind of instruction, and every 
teacher should become skilled in blackboard writing and draw- 
ing and be resourceful in devising occasions to secure attention 
and clarify ideas by these means. In the complex activities 
which Miss Hardy directed it is obvious that much of the suc- 
cess depended upon the single objective center which secured 
from most of the pupils immediate, spontaneous, and rapt 
attention. 
6. Special equipment of charts and word cards improves 
technique.—The use of a chart as the single objective center 
of attention in the first reading lessons is merely one example 
of the enormous improvements that are made possible in teach- 
ing by slight enrichments or modifications of the equipment. In 
the case of reading, other important items are the single lines on 
separate strips and the word cards. With the single lines on long 
strips Miss Hardy had some difficulty until she found the special 
rack into which they could be easily fitted. This rack is known 
as the Plymouth Chart? and consists of a long sheet of paper 
with horizontal ledges or grooves into which the strips can be 
easily inserted, even by the children, who naturally take delight 
in doing it. Most of the commercialized reading systems now 
furnish charts and word cards for their early lessons. In case a 
resourceful teacher desires to compose her own lessons, as Miss 
Hardy did, she may procure an outfit of large type, such as are 
used by merchants in printing signs, and sheets of manila tag 
board 234 by 28% inches. In view of the complex responsibilities 
which confront a beginning teacher in her first year of teaching, 
it would probably be well for the beginner to use some of the 
ready-made materials provided by those commercialized systems 
that are in accord with the principles of teaching reading de- 
scribed above. 
1See footnote on page 81.
-P-A-G-E-116
  100 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
Bulletin board for incidental reading.—The beginner may sup- 
plement such ready-made material by a variety of homemade 
charts, some of which may be thumb-tacked on the bulletin 
board that constitutes another important feature of Miss Hardy’s 
equipment. The surface of the bulletin board is best made of 
sheet cork. As noted on page 76, a “line for the day” makes 
attractive incidental reading matter to bulletin, as do also pic- 
tures cut from magazines and illustrating some of the activities 
of the class. To these pictures may be added attractive legends 
in large letters. In case a teacher does not possess a printing 
outfit, or time to use it, she may easily acquire skill in lettering 
with black crayon sufficient to dash off these legends very rap- 
idly. Even in very poor circumstances a bulletin arrangement 
could be devised by using a corner of the blackboard and writ- 
ing with chalk. 
7. Organize interesting activities, particularly games, with 
the reading materials.—Some educators have believed that the 
desire to read described under principle 3, on page 94, is suf- 
ficient in itself to maintain the interest necessary for acquiring 
skill in reading. It takes only a little knowledge of the com- 
plexity and difficulty of the process of learning reading, however, 
to show us that very few children would acquire sufficient skill 
merely from this motive. Moreover, as discussed under princi- 
ple 3, the desire to read is not a condition which we assume to 
exist in all pupils, but is to be a product of our teaching of read- 
ing in such a manner as to make all reading experiences delight- 
ful. Under principle 3 the opportunities for providing inherently 
delightful material for the pupils were stressed as a means to aid 
in creating the desire to read throughout life. Our present point 
is to emphasize interesting activities with this material, as a 
means of securing the attentive practice and repetition which 
are necessary to create automatic skill in reading. 
Practice sugar-coated with games is the open sesame of child- 
hood.—The fundamental basis of interesting practice activities 
in pre-primer reading is the pupils’ intense interest in games.
-P-A-G-E-117
BEGINNING READING IOI 
The phrase “play a game” is the open-sesame charm which pro- 
gressive teachers now use throughout the grades to secure rapt 
attention in all types of practice—in handwriting, spelling, 
reading, arithmetic, and language. Attentive, effective practice 
and learning can be secured with all kinds of educative materials 
provided they are sugar-coated with games which require con- 
centrated attention upon the educative activities. Miss Hardy’s 
lessons abounded in illustrations. The children played the game 
of ‘finding the-line which says,” gave close attention to the 
several lines as an essential part of the game, and learned to 
~ recognize the lines readily as the educative result. In the 
“moving-picture show” game of flashing cards the pupils were 
eagerly expectant and raptly attentive to each card as flashed, 
and learned to name the words rapidly and automatically as the 
educative result. The beginning teacher of first-grade reading 
should study carefully Miss Hardy’s gameful devices for securing 
interest and attentive educative practice. 
8. Drill games require alertness and refined teaching 
technique.—The effective conduct of drill games demands con- 
siderable automatic skill from the teacher. I was impressed with 
this fact while watching a practice teacher in the first grade. 
She had planned about six little games with word cards to con- 
sume about ten minutes. In order that she might keep her games 
in mind she had written in an obscure corner of the side board 
a list of them in very small letters, but sufficiently large for her 
to see. As a consequence she was able to keep her program in 
mind and maintain the zeal, or “pep,” which is such a charac- 
teristic feature of active games. While she did fairly well in her 
teaching, I could feel the same contrast between her technique 
and Miss Hardy’s that one feels between the movements of a 
beginner in skating or basket ball, on the one hand, and those 
of the smoothly moving professional in these activities, on the 
other hand. 
9. Careful attention to individual differences. As a final 
principle to be considered in discussing pre-primer reading
-P-A-G-E-118
102. TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
we may note the necessity of adapting the teaching to the 
varied abilities of the pupils. On pages 89-90 we noted cases 
of two especially slow pupils—one who could not pick out the 
“Jast word” in a line, and another who failed to recognize 
the word “old” two minutes after he had been given thorough 
drill upon it. At the opposite extreme from such pupils we find 
children of five years of age who have a natural talent for 
learning to read and do so with little difficulty. In progressive 
first grades, during the pre-primer reading, the pupils are care- 
fully studied and grouped and regrouped according to the abili- 
ties they exhibit in learning to read. For example, Miss Hardy’s 
group which I had under observation was the brighter of two 
groups that had been given no previous instruction in reading. 
At the end of five weeks of pre-primer reading the slower group 
was about one week behind this brighter group. An even more 
advanced group consisted of children who had been instructed 
in reading in the kindergarten and had mastered some of the 
very elementary steps in beginning reading. 
Skill from pre-primer reading makes book-reading easy. 
—In general the scientific studies of the maturing children’s 
abilities, as well as the success of progressive, gameful methods 
of teaching pre-primer reading, demonstrate that most children 
at six years of age are undoubtedly mature enough to learn 
the art of easy reading. In the blackboard-reading and chart- 
reading these children experience little or no difficulty. When 
they come to book-reading the skill which they have acquired 
during the five weeks of pre-primer reading simplifies their diffi- 
culties enormously, so that with simple, familiar material they 
readily read page after page with delight. In the next section of 
the chapter we shall describe concretely Miss Hardy’s first les- 
sons with the primer and then discuss the additional principles 
of teaching reading which these book lessons illustrate. Before 
turning to the book-reading we shall summarize briefly the nine 
principles of teaching pre-primer reading which were presented 
in this'section of the chapter.
-P-A-G-E-119
  BEGINNING READING 103 
Summary of rules for teaching pre-primer reading.—The 
nine rules for teaching pre-primer reading which we presented 
above may be briefly summarized as follows: 
1. Initiate the correct reading attitude of trying to get mean- 
ingful and interesting experiences from printed material. 
2. Provide meaningful content. 
3. Create a desire to read by means of delightful and interest- 
ing content. 
4. Proceed analytically from the whole story to phrases and 
then to individual words. 
5. Secure a single objective center for the attention of all 
pupils by beginning with blackboard-reading or chart-reading. 
6. Provide a special equipment of charts, cards, pictures, 
legends, and a bulletin board to facilitate reading practice. 
7. Organize interesting activities to secure the attentive repe- 
tition necessary to give automatic skill in the elements of 
reading. 
8. Master the technique of conducting drill games. 
9. Group pupils according to their natural talent for, or their 
acquired ability in, reading and give special individual attention 
to the slow learners. 
Section III. BrcInninc Book-READING 
A. Sample Lessons 
Reading the first story. Previous reading from chart. Easy 
transition. The reading from charts, described on pages 77-91, 
continued in Miss Hardy’s room during the first five weeks of 
school. The transition was then made to reading from a reg- 
ular primer. This transition was rendered easy by having 
the last chart contain the first story of the primer in exactly 
the same form. 
Children eager to possess and read the promised books.—Be- 
fore beginning the first lesson with the books, Miss Hardy asked, 
“What was it I said we were going to have today?” ‘ Books!” 
 
-P-A-G-E-120
104 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
cried the children. “Where are they?” and other exclamations 
followed in joyous tones. “Shall I get them?” queried Miss 
Hardy. “Yes! yes!” The teacher then brought out the pile of 
new books, and the class counted the children and the books and 
found one book too many. This was laid aside for an absent 
child. 
Primers compared with pasted books and similar home cop- 
ies.—Miss Hardy held up one copy and said: ‘See, this book 
has a name—just as we have names for the books we have been 
making. The name here is ‘primer.’ Here are also the names of 
the two people who wrote the stories for us, and here is the name 
of the person who made all the nice pictures in it.” Many of the 
children recognized the book as one their older brothers or 
sisters had owned, and volunteered ‘“‘We have a book at home 
just like that,” or similar comments. ‘I shall give each child 
a book,” said Miss Hardy. “Look through it quickly to see 
whether there is anything you know.” 
Children freely examine books and volunteer comments.— 
Upon receiving the books there were many exclamations : ‘Oh, 
there is the Gingerbread Boy!” ‘“My pages are all stuck 
together!” “I can read this story!” etc. 
Child’s request for a certain story leads to table of contents — 
One boy wanted to know whether a certain story was in the book. 
The teacher told him to look at the table of contents, and then 
asked all the children to look. Some of the children began to 
count the titles of the stories in the table of contents. About five 
minutes were consumed in permitting the children such random, 
spontaneous activity with the book. 
Manila line-marker to each child; table of contents read.— 
Miss Hardy then brought the group to attention by saying: 
“Look up here, everyone. I am going to give you each a marker 
[showing a strip of durable manila paper about four inches long 
and one inch wide]. Place it under the name of the first story 
and then move it down as I read each name. . . . The first line 
says what?” The children gave this title as they had learned 
 
-P-A-G-E-121
  
BEGINNING READING 105 
it on the chart. “And what page?” The children answered 
correctly. The teacher then read each succeeding line, mean- 
while watching the group closely and assisting slow pupils to 
move their markers to the appropriate lines. 
Story of first selection told by children from its successive 
pictures.—“ Now all turn to the first story,” said the teacher. 
The children quickly recognized it as the one from the last 
chart. ‘“Let’s all look at the pictures together to see whether it 
is the same story we know. . . . What is happening in the first 
picture? . . . What do you see in the second picture ?”—and 
so on until all the pictures had been examined and the story of 
each told by the children. 
Story read rapidly. Markers moved carefully ; line scanned 
silently ; hands raised ; chosen pupil reads line orally.—‘*Now 
turn back to the first page,” directed Miss Hardy, “‘and we will 
read the story. . . . Put your markers under the title. Always 
keep your markers very still. Read the title. ... ‘Gideon.’ 
. . . Now put your markers under the first line and get ready 
to tell what it says. Read silently. . . . John, read it to us. 
. . . Now the next line. Move your markers; study it; read 
silently. Then raise your hand to tell me what it says.” As 
the children proceeded there were exclamations of “I know!” 
etc., and giggles of delight at recognizing the familiar lines that 
they had learned on the chart. Occasionally the class read a 
difficult line in unison. Several pages were easily read in a few 
minutes, Miss Hardy showing the children how the story con- 
tinued from the bottom of a left-hand page to the top of a right- 
hand page, etc. 
Each child becomes responsible for his own book.—At the end 
of the hour the teacher said: ‘Put your markers in the books 
and close them. Notice how clean your markers are. They 
will keep clean if you use them only for markers. Each child is 
responsible for his own book. Do you remember we learned 
yesterday what ‘responsible’ means? Put them in your desks 
carefully.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-122
106 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
Preparation for the second story. Dramatic telling by the 
teacher ; second telling with new word cards ; flash practice with 
cards.—Reading the second story in the primer marked an- 
other step in advance, because this was done without prelimi- 
nary reading of it ona chart. However, careful preparation was 
made for the new story by spending a whole reading period 
upon it before opening the books. This preparatory period 
contained three steps, as follows: 
First, the teacher told the story in the exact words of the 
book, bringing out clearly its dramatic interest. 
Second, she retold it and held up appropriate word cards, or 
phrases which were peculiarly characteristic of the story or 
repeated frequently in it. 
Third, she then used these cards in a flash drill, closely relat- 
ing them to the story by such remarks as “ Don’t you remember ? 
This is the name of the second animal he met,” etc. 
Reading of the second story.—The reading of this second 
story on the next day, in the books, proceeded largely as in the 
case of the first story, by the following steps: 
1. Children tell the story from the pictures.— About five min- 
utes were spent in examining the pictures one after another and 
having the children tell the story from them. There was much 
free expression by the children at this stage, but the teacher, 
by skillful questioning, got them to use also many of the exact 
phrases as they would appear in the reading. 
2. Actual reading. Markers; units of one or more lines; 
teacher suggests content of line, rebukes careless pupil, aids 
slow pupil, commends good reading.—After examining all the 
pictures the children returned to the first page of the story and, 
using their markers, read systematically through several pages. 
The following remarks by the teacher will add the local color 
of the situation: “Turn back to the first page. . . . Now, if 
everybody does everything just right we can read far today. . . . 
Read the first line silently ; then one of you may read it to the 
group. It tells one of the characters in the story. ... Now
-P-A-G-E-123
  BEGINNING READING 107 
see what the next sentence says. . . . The last sentence says 
what? It begins with ‘So.’ ... Now we have two lines to 
read together. This is harder, isn’t it? But we can do it all 
right if we use our markers. . . . The next line tells what he 
[referring to the hero of the story] does. . . . Are you ready, 
Allison? That’s the fourth time you have dropped your book. 
When children drop their books four times that means they 
aren’t ready for them. [Allison doesn’t drop his book again.] 
The next three lines tell what the boy says. All read silently 
and then raise your hands. Now all move your markers back 
and we will read these three lines together. . . . Does some 
word puzzle you there, John? ... Wait a minute, Franklin; 
it’s this line, here [constantly watching around the compact 
little circle of readers to aid individual pupils who are in dif- 
ficulties]. . . . Good for you, Mary, but I could hardly hear 
you. Read it again.” 
Coherent, rapid, meaningful reading. Drill relegated to 
separate period.— With such coherent group reading, aided by 
alert attention of the teacher to the needs of individual pupils, 
the story was rapidly completed. In order to make this type of 
rapid, meaningful reading the dominant activity of the reading 
period, most of the repetitional drill work on individual words 
had now been assigned to separate periods, which were called 
“word study.” Before turning to a description of this activity 
we may discuss some of the general principles of teaching ele- 
mentary reading which may be illustrated by the book lessons 
described above. 
B. Principles of Beginning Book-Reading 
1. Secure continuous, coherent, rapid, meaningful read- 
ing.—The largest factor in determining the nature of the first 
book-reading in Miss Hardy’s lessons was probably the desire to 
continue the formation of correct reading attitudes and habits 
by facilitating continuous, coherent, rapid, meaningful reading
-P-A-G-E-124
  108 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
by the pupils. This purpose predominated throughout the pre- 
primer reading, and was easily realized in the early book lessons 
as a result of the skill acquired in the pre-primer reading. It is 
a revelation to the observer who is unfamiliar with progres- 
sive methods in teaching reading to see first-grade children, 
during their first three or four days with book-reading, rapidly 
complete some twenty pages of story material with interest, 
comprehension, fluency, and dispatch. 
2. Complexities of first book-reading simplified by first 
reading the same story on the chart.— Reading in a book for 
the first time requires many complex mental and muscular activ- 
ities of the pupil. These not only include mental attention to 
the forms of the words, phrases, and sentences but also involve 
difficulties in holding the book and especially in moving the eyes 
from word to word and from the end of one line to the beginning 
of the next line. If the pupil has had no preliminary reading 
practice it is futile to expect coherent, continuous, smooth read- 
ing under such complicated, trying conditions. On the other 
hand, if he has acquired some general facility in reading larger 
printed forms and, particularly, has read upon a chart the same 
story that he encounters in the book, the mental difficulties of 
coherent reading of this first story are almost entirely removed, 
leaving only the muscular adjustments of hand and eye to give 
difficulty. 
3. Continuous, thrilling, story material encourages page- 
after-page reading.—In order to encourage continuous, co- 
herent reading, the content of the first book lessons must be of 
a connected, continuous character. Hence, in our best recent 
primers we find real stories at the very beginning, each of which 
may extend over several pages. Each story has a definite plot 
which tends to carry the little reader along to the end. Great 
skill has been exhibited by a number of writers and publishers 
since about 1910 in composing and publishing such material. 
The stories are usually classics of childhood, such as ‘The Three 
Billy Goats Gruff,’ “Little Red Riding-hood,” ‘ Goldilocks,”
-P-A-G-E-125
  BEGINNING READING 109 
“The Little Red Hen,” “The Gingerbread Boy,” which have 
proved fascinating to children for generations. It is an interest- 
ing historical fact that while such stories had for many years 
been contained in reading books for the later grades, it was not 
until recently that they were introduced into the primers for the 
first lessons. This introduction came as the result of the accept- 
ance of the general point of view in teaching reading which has 
been emphasized in this chapter; namely, developing attitudes 
and habits of securing meaningful, interesting experiences from 
the very beginning of reading. 
4. Repetitional phrases of certain child classics especially 
facilitate continuous, easy reading.—Since the classic plots 
of children’s stories were already at hand, the skill of the primer- 
writers consisted chiefly in phrasing the narrative so as to facili- 
tate easy reading. Stories constructed on the general plan of 
“The House that Jack Built” were frequently chosen in order 
to secure repetition of words and phrases. Such a story usually 
has some unsolved problem that holds interest to the end and 
involves the meeting of one of the characters with the others 
in turn in such a manner as to call for frequent repetition of 
the whole story up to date. Thus there is a gradual addition 
of new material, introducing new difficulties, with frequent 
repetition of older phrases. This gives a happy balance of easy 
repetition and a few new words, and enables the children early 
to read with considerable fluency, provided the teacher is skilled 
in introducing the story so as to anticipate the vocabulary 
difficulties. 
5. Preparation for reading early stories includes dramatic 
telling, new words on cards, and telling from pictures.—In 
preparing for the reading of the second story we saw how Miss 
Hardy introduced it by first telling it dramatically herself, and 
then retelling it with display of new words upon cards at appro- 
priate places. These words were then restudied in connection 
with parts of the oral story. Finally, after the books were in 
hand the children told the story, before reading it, as they found 
 
-P-A-G-E-126
  110. =TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
it represented in the pictures. This practice attaches special 
importance and significance to the pictures in the making of a 
primer. As a consequence high-grade artists are employed to 
draw them. The results are pictures full of story and action 
which the pupils delight in beholding. 
6. Rapidly read many stories in many books.—When the 
story is finally read it is completed rapidly and the next story 
soon begun. . This eliminates the old-fashioned practice of read- 
ing the same stories in a single primer over and over. Instead, 
after one primer is quickly finished another is begun, with the 
result that from ten to twenty books— including first readers— 
may be completed in one year. Since nearly all these books 
possess the same type of stories about animals and common 
things, the vocabulary demands may be quite small but the 
actual practice in fundamental reading habits very large. In 
order to make these fundamental reading habits the chief factor 
in the reading period, most of the repetitional, gameful drill with 
word cards is placed in a separate period. This separate drill 
activity, through automatizing the recognition of the sight 
words, greatly aids the activity of the reading period. By be- 
ing separated, however, it is kept from detracting from the 
interpretative reading attitudes and the mental and muscular 
practice in continuous reading which predominate in the reading 
period. 
7. Muscular adjustments of eyes in finding and following 
the line aided by marker.—The muscular practice referred to 
consists largely of practice in moving the eyes step by step along 
each line and then swinging them back to the beginning of the 
next line. If you will watch the eyes of a person who is reading 
you can easily see these jerks and pauses as the eyes move from 
left to right, and the long sweep back to the beginning of the 
next line. As we noticed in the chapter on handwriting, little 
children have special difficulties in making such fine motor ad- 
justments. Even an adult reader has difficulty in some cases in 
finding with his eyes the beginning of the next line ; for example,
-P-A-G-E-127
  BEGINNING READING IIr 
if he is reading a very wide page containing very long lines. An 
adult may have difficulty even in keeping his eyes on a single 
line in cases like reading a wide statistical table. In such cases 
he is very likely to use a ruler or piece of paper to mark the line 
and guide his eyes. The same device was used by Miss Hardy’s 
children in the form of a strip of manila paper. This not only 
aids each child’s eyes in finding and following the line but also 
aids the teacher in holding the attention of all the pupils upon 
the same line as she says, ‘Now move your markers to the third 
line,” etc. It thus contributes to securing the continuous, coher- 
ent, rapid reading which we have emphasized in this section of 
the chapter. 
Summary of rules for beginning book-reading.— We may 
now summarize our discussion of the teaching of the first lessons 
in book-reading in the following seven rules: 
1. Secure continuous, coherent, rapid, meaningful reading. 
2. Introduce the first story by preliminary reading of it on 
a chart in order to simplify the complexities of the first book- 
reading. 
3. Use continuous, thrilling story material to encourage page- 
after-page reading. 
4. Choose child classics with repetitional phrases to facilitate 
easy continuous reading. 
5. Prepare for fluent reading of the first few stories by telling 
each story before reading it, by showing new words, and by 
having the pupils retell it from the pictures. 
6. Rapidly read many stories in many books. 
7. Have each pupil use a line-marker to aid the eyes and to 
secure attention of all the pupils to the same line. 
Summary of the chapter to this point.— Up to this point in 
our chapter we have covered the following sections :

III. Beginning book-reading.

B. Principles of teaching. 
In all this discussion we have emphasized the teaching of 
reading as vitally related to children’s experiences in the first 
grade with games, constructive activities, nursery rimes, and 
thrilling adventures found in the classic stories of childhood. 
All the technique employed in the teaching has tended to estab- 
lish in the pupils the fundamental reading attitude and habit of 
trying to get meaningful, interesting experiences from printed 
material. At the same time, the child has been acquiring certain 
mechanical habits of moving his eyes and a vocabulary of sight 
words which he can use as tools in reading many stories contain- 
ing only his familiar vocabulary. It is highly desirable, however, 
to extend the pupil’s skill so that he can read material in which 
unfamiliar printed forms occur—in other words, to make him an 
independent reader of all types of material adapted to his age. 
For this reason, after the fundamental correct reading attitudes 
and habits had been well started, we found Miss Hardy intro- 
ducing the third phase of first-grade reading, to which we shall 
now turn our attention. 
Section IV. INDEPENDENT RECOGNITION oF NEw 
Worps; PHONETIC ANALYSIS 
A. Sample Lessons 
Third phase of beginning reading. Phonetic training for 
analyzing and recognizing new words.—The descriptions of 
the reading in Miss Hardy’s room given on pages 74-111 car- 
ried us through the first two principal phases: (1) incidental 
reading and the reading of rimes and stories from charts; (2) 
beginning to read in the primer. At the beginning of the sixth 
week the third phase of reading was introduced ; namely, pho- 
netic training to enable the children to analyze and name new
-P-A-G-E-129
  BEGINNING READING 113 
words instead of having to be taught each word “by sight” by 
the teacher.t We shall describe Miss Hardy’s introduction to 
the phonetic sounds and to the phonetic analysis of words and 
then take up a scientific study of the necessity and value of such 
training. 
Some children interested in riming words and in similar 
beginnings.—Occasionally, before the beginning of the sixth 
week, some of the children gave evidence of their natural inter- 
est in words that sound alike, by voluntary remarks about words 
that rimed in the jingles they were studying, such as “Jill” and 
“hill.” Some of them had noticed even the similar beginnings 
of words as Miss Hardy wrote them on the board. For example, 
the word “Save” had become very familiar as a note to the 
janitor. One day when the teacher wrote “Sam” a pupil said, 
“You begin that word just like ‘Save.’” On another occasion a 
pupil suggested that “man” and “met” looked somewhat alike. 
First phonetic lesson. Learning the sound of “m” as the in- 
itial sound of four familiar words——The first sound which the 
children learned was that of the consonant m. It was taught dur- 
ing a portion of a word-study period. For the lesson Miss Hardy 
selected four words beginning with m, which the children had 
used in their reading and which they knew well by sight; 
namely, “met,” “man,” “‘make,” “made.” After some prelimi- 
naries the major steps in the teaching were the following: 
1. Miss Hardy asked the children to listen very carefully as 
she pronounced the four words and then to tell her what part 
sounded the same. They readily said, “The first part.” 
1Among the possible values of phonetic instruction the following are 
suggested by E. D. Burbank, in the Volta Review, Vol. XXII, June, 1920: 
I. In word recognition, making possible the recognition of words at sight. 
II. In pronunciation, making correct sounds possible without reference to the 
dictionary. 
III. In articulation and enunciation, giving distinctness and clearness to speech. 
IV. In spelling, making it unnecessary to learn all words as sight words. 
V. It prevents provincialisms and dialects, tends toward standardized English, 
and helps in the study of foreign languages. 
VI. It may lead to spelling reform.
-P-A-G-E-130
  114. TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
2. She then said, ‘Watch my lips as I say each word, so you 
can hear the first sound.” 
3. Then she brought out a small chart on which the words 
were printed. The words were pronounced and the first sound 
was connected with the sight of the first letter. 
4. She wrote the words on the blackboard, and the children 
noted that they all began the same. 
5. The children were then asked to think of other words 
which began with the same sound. One said, “Money.” An- 
other said, “Margery.” A child who was not getting the point 
said, “Little.” 
6. The teacher said, “I am thinking of something the cow 
gives which begins with this sound.” The children said, “Milk.” 
Again, “I am thinking of a kind of pie we have at Thanksgiv- 
ing.” “Mince,” they said. Similar questions with easy obvious 
answers were given until most of the children had the sound 
well in mind and connected with the beginnings of certain 
familiar words. 
Second phonetic lesson. Learning the sound of “s.’ Details 
of technique.— Two days later, during a word-study period, the 
second sound was taught; namely, that of the consonant s. 
About seven minutes were consumed in the activities sketched 
below. 
1. “The other day we discovered many words that begin with 
the same sound,” said Miss Hardy. The children immediately 
began to hum the sound of m and volunteered “met, man,” etc. 
as she held up the old chart. 
2. “This morning we are going to have some more words 
which you know, and shall see with what sound they begin. 
Look at my lips and listen,” said Miss Hardy, as she pronounced 
“seed,” “so,” “said,” “some”—all familiar words from the 
reading lessons. The children immediately volunteered the 
hissing s sound. One child said, “’That’s the snake’s sound.” 
“How do you know?” asked Miss Hardy. ‘My mother 
told me.”
-P-A-G-E-131
  BEGINNING READING “PLS 
3. A chart with the words printed on it was then studied, 
the teacher pointing to the beginning of each word as it was 
pronounced. 
4. In response to the teacher’s request “I want you to tell 
me a word that begins with this sound,” the children gave 
“sore” and “say.” The teacher added “Sunday,” and said, 
“T am thinking of a boy’s name that begins with this sound.” 
“John,” said one child. “No; ‘Sam’ is the word.” “That’s my 
uncle’s name,” volunteered one of the youngsters, who were 
nearly all ready now with additional words, such as “saw” and 
“salmon.” 
5. “Are you ready to see me write one of these words?” 
queried Miss Hardy. “I am going to write this first word 
[pointing to “seed”]. What does it say?”—and so on till 
all were written. 
6. “Now watch me as I erase one of the words, and then tell 
me which one it was.” The game element in this activity held 
the children’s rapt attention. Finally all the words were erased. 
7. The children were then taught to write the word “seed” 
at the blackboard (as described on page 17, in the chapter 
on handwriting). 
8. Before dismissing the children the phonetic work of the 
period was then briefly recalled by Miss Hardy, with such re- 
marks as: ‘What sound does seed begin with? . . . What was 
another word on that card? ... Let’s say them all through 
again. . . . How many of you think you will know that sound 
when you see a word in your books that begins with it ?” 
Puzzle as to teaching word families. Need of experiments 
to show how children learn phonetic analysis —With similar de- 
tailed devices Miss Hardy proceeded to teach the sounds of other 
consonants. She then reached a stage that puzzles first-grade 
teachers of phonetics ; namely, teaching the sounds and combi- 
nations of the vowels. The puzzling issue is whether (1) to 
attach the vowel to the final consonant of a short word (for ex- 
ample, “‘c at,” thus giving the “at” family) or (2) to attach
-P-A-G-E-132
  116 - TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
the vowel to the initial consonant (thus, ‘‘ca t,” which is urged 
by some experts in phonetics who object to the “family” idea). 
It is very likely that the evidence from the scientific study of 
phonetics justifies the latter practice. The following account 
shows how Miss Hardy proceeded at this puzzling stage. 
Vowel sounds. Derived by cutting consonants from short 
words.—The following table of words illustrates the material 
which the class used in the derivation of the short vowel sounds. 
cat met bit not cut 
bat get fit got but 
rat let hit hot nut 
When Miss Hardy wrote the first column of this material 
h thus, cae 
bat 
rat 
the children easily recognized the words or quickly learned 
them. Having already learned the consonant sounds they easily 
gave each when the teacher covered up the other parts of the 
word. When she erased the final ¢ and asked what was left, the 
children said ca, ba, ra. Then, when she erased the initial con- 
sonants of these syllables and asked what was left, the pupils 
gave the short sound of a. Similar procedure with the other 
columns, plus many additional short words, enabled the children 
themselves to discover the short sounds of the vowels a, e, i, 0, #, 
and to gain skill in pronouncing short new words containing 
them. They were told that these vowel sounds were called short. 
Long sounds learned; then rule determining whether long or 
short.—Later the children were told that sometimes the vowels 
are not called short but are called the opposite, whereupon they 
themselves supplied the word “long.” From a study of words 
which they already knew, such as “late” and “rode,” they be- 
1See A M. Bell’s “Phonetic Syllabification,’ Volta Review, March, 
IQI5.
-P-A-G-E-133
  
BEGINNING READING 117 
came familiar with the long sounds and learned that generally 
when a short word ends in ¢ the latter is silent and the other 
vowel is long. 
Many devices for concreteness, activity, interest, and drill. 
—The reader will readily understand that this later teaching 
was not carried on in the rapid, abstract manner that my brief 
description of it may suggest, but extended over many days, and 
at all stages was characterized by the concrete beginnings, the 
varied delightful activities of the pupils, the gameful, repeti- 
tional drill devices, which we found ever present in the earlier 
descriptions of Miss Hardy’s lessons. Owing to the great length 
of this chapter, I must refrain from giving further details con- 
cerning the phonetic instruction and present briefly the general 
principles of training in the independent recognition of new 
words which Miss Hardy’s lessons indicate. 
B. Principles of teaching Independent Recognition of 
New Words 
1. Without phonetic training pupils become inaccurate, 
dependent readers.— Complete proof of the necessity and value 
of phonetic training in the recognition of new words must be 
postponed until our next chapter, which will present the results 
of scientific studies of reading. We may anticipate, however, by 
stating that pupils who have not had training in independent 
word analysis prove to be, on the average, much more inaccurate 
in their reading than pupils who have had this training. Even 
from common observation, moreover, one can readily appreciate 
the desirability of training pupils so that they can rapidly and 
accurately decipher the new words which they meet in their 
everyday reading in and out of school, instead of merely recog- 
nizing the words which they have already learned by sight. 
In learning to read, the child must cultivate two somewhat con- 
flicting sets of habits: (1) the habit of recognizing familiar 
words and phrases rapidly at sight and attending to their mean-
-P-A-G-E-134
  118 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
ings; (2) the habit of carefully analyzing the sounds of un- 
familiar words to ascertain their pronunciation. It is important 
that both these habits and forms of skill be cultivated and that 
the child be capable of using each in its appropriate place with- 
out serious interference from the other. 
2. Teach in a separate period.—tIn order to protect the 
sight-reading period from interfering attitudes, the phonetic in- 
struction and drill are best given in a separate period. Such skill 
as is acquired in these separate periods will be used, however, 
where needed in the regular reading period. This will be illus- 
trated later in the chapter in an account of a second-grade 
lesson. 
3. Derive the sounds by analyzing familiar words.—In 
Miss Hardy’s lessons we saw how the word drill upon certain 
words from the reading lessons was naturally and easily directed 
into a study of the initial sounds of the words. Some of the 
children had already of their own accord shown an interest in 
these sounds. The study of the latter represents the final step 
in the analytical learning, from wholes to parts, which we have 
described in earlier portions of the chapter. Such learning pro- 
ceeds from the whole story to individual lines and phrases, 
then to drill on individual words, and, finally, to the sounds 
composing the words. 
4. Teach the easy sounds early.— This rule is illustrated by 
the consonants s and }. The hissing sound of the s is easily 
separated from the words and pronounced by children, but the 
sound of b is more difficult, even for an adult, to learn to make. 
The ordinary result when an adult tries to pronounce 0 is 
really the sound of the phonogram bz. 
5. Teach the most useful sounds early.—This rule is illus- 
trated by the short and long sounds of the vowels. One au- 
thority estimates that in the Jones spelling list (discussed on 
page 53) 61 per cent of the phonetic syllables have short 
vowels and ro per cent of the phonetic syllables have the 
vowels made long by final e. These frequencies justify us in 
 
-P-A-G-E-135
  
BEGINNING READING 11g 
teaching early the short sounds of the vowels and quickly 
following these with words in which the vowels are made long 
by final e. 
6. Teach habits of analyzing words that will help in all 
later reading.—In general this rule means that pupils will be 
given much practice in straightforward attack upon new, or un- 
familiar words. One of the facts which will come out in our next 
chapter, on the scientific investigations of reading, is the very 
halting, confused methods of attacking new words which char- 
acterize many poor readers. Only sufficient practice in using 
methods of phonetic analysis will give mastery of them and lead 
to a confident, straightforward attack. For this reason some 
authorities argue that word families, which emphasize the final 
rimes in words, interfere with the desired practice of attacking 
a new word phonetically at the first syllable and proceeding sys- 
tematically through it. Consequently they emphasize as de- 
sirable the habit of straightforward syllabication of new words 
as an aid in deciphering them. 
7. Use a well-organized scientific system of teaching pho- 
netics.— The few comments which we have made above suggest 
that the effective mastery of phonetic tools and analysis cannot 
be left to the haphazard efforts of inexperienced, unskilled 
teachers. Just as in the case of handwriting and spelling, we need 
ready-made, scientifically constructed systems. In phonetic 
teaching these will be derived from a study of (1) the phonetics 
of the common English words and (2) the methods and devices 
by which children most readily acquire skill in phonetic analysis. 
There are only a few systems in the market in which even the 
first factor—namely, the phonetics of the language—has been 
given careful consideration. As to the second factor,—namely, 
how children best learn phonetic analysis—we need many 
more detailed investigations of children’s experiences in learn- 
ing particular sounds, phonetic combinations, and syllabication 
before we can perfect our ready-made systems for teaching 
phonetic analysis.

  120 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
Conclusion of first-grade reading. Correct reading habits _ 
plus skill in word analysis.—This will conclude our discus- 
sion of first-grade reading as derived from the actual lessons 
observed in Miss Hardy’s rooms. These lessons and our inter- 
pretative discussion have given us a notion of progressive mod- 
ern methods of teaching reading to beginners in the first grade. 
We found the initial emphasis placed on forming the correct 
reading attitude—of trying to get meaningful, interesting ex- 
periences from printed material. For this purpose we found 
action words, nursery rimes, and continuous story material used 
to enable children early to take a delight in fluent reading. 
After the fundamental reading attitudes and habits had been 
correctly started we found systematic training for the independ- 
ent phonetic analysis of new words being started at the begin- 
ning of the sixth week. Throughout the first year both of these 
types of practice are emphasized ; namely, (1) easy, fluent, de- 
lightful reading and (2) practice in phonetic analysis. In order 
to give the reader an idea of the results of such teaching, as well 
as the modifications that occur in the technique as the children 
gain more skill, we shall describe briefly a reading lesson ob- 
served in the fall in a second-grade room. 
SECTION V. SECOND-GRADE LESSON ILLUSTRATING 
ACHIEVEMENTS AND TECHNIQUE 
Preparation. Discussion of monkeys and crocodiles.—The 
second-grade children assembled in their little chairs in the front 
of the room, just as the first-grade pupils had done. Miss Laura 
Lucas, their teacher, spent about two minutes in a preparatory 
discussion before turning to the story which they were to read. 
Among her questions and remarks, which were interspersed with 
answers from the children, were the following : 
“How many of you, when you went to the zoo, saw the crocodiles ?” 
“How do they move, quickly or slowly?” 
“Do they climb trees, like monkeys?” [Some of the children said 
that they do.]
-P-A-G-E-137
  BEGINNING READING 121 
“What kind of country do they live in—cold or hot?” 
“Where do monkeys live—in what kind of country?” 
“If a crocodile wanted to catch a monkey how would he do it?” 
“T thought this morning you would like to read a story about how 
a crocodile tried to catch a monkey. The animals we are going to 
read about lived in a country called India [writing the word on 
the board]. They called each other by these names” [writing ‘Mr. 
Crocodile” and “Mr. Monkey”]. 
Silent reading. Books presented to pupils.—‘“When I give 
you your books, turn to page 85, read silently, and tell me if 
there are any words you do not know.” 
Much whispered vocalization indicates stage of development. 
—The children followed these directions and read the story 
silently with perfect attention. There was much whispered vo- 
calization, showing that most of the children were not reading to 
themselves any faster than they could pronounce the words. 
Assistance in phonetic analysis of new words given individu- 
ally —Those children that needed assistance advanced individu- 
ally to the teacher, who was now seated in a low chair. As each 
child pointed out the words he did not know, Miss Lucas gave 
him help in such a low tone that the others were not distracted. 
As a rule she did not tell a child outright, but helped him to use 
his phonetic ability, saying, for example : “You have two vowels 
here, Clarence. Which one do you pronounce ?” 
Lack of phonetic training necessitates much help for one child. 
—Some of the children did not need any assistance. Most of 
them asked only once. One girl, however, requested help five 
times. After the lesson Miss Lucas told me that this child had 
entered from another school, where she had not had phonetic 
training ; consequently she could not decipher the new words. 
She was being given special training to correct her deficiency. 
Difficult words written on board in order of occurrence.—As 
the children asked for help on particular words, Miss Lucas made 
a memorandum of each on a card and then wrote them on the 
board in the order in which they occurred in the story, together
-P-A-G-E-138
  
122 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
with other words or phrases to which she desired to call the chil- 
dren’s attention. The list appeared as follows : 
greedy stupid 
catch angry 
bank narrow 
fond of fruit moved 
swam along crawled 
surface hello 
started afraid 
Those who had finished the silent reading were told to study 
the words on the board. 
Pupils relate the story. Show successful silent reading. 
—After all the pupils had finished reading the story silently, 
Miss Lucas said: “Put your finger in the place and close your 
books. Will someone tell us just how it happened that the 
crocodile wanted to catch the monkey?” A pupil gave his 
answer. 
“What was his first plan to catch the monkey?” A boy de- 
scribed the plan. 
“Tell us about the second plan, Damon.” 
The pupils talked very freely and related the story so clearly 
that it was obvious they had thoroughly grasped it in their silent 
reading. : 
Difficult words on board. Explained if pupils request it.— 
Miss Lucas then said: “Here are some of the words you asked 
for. If there is any word up here that any of you doesn’t know, 
hold up your hand.” She then explained certain of the words as 
pupils requested it. 
Pupils pronounce and weave new words into oral story.—Miss 
Lucas then reviewed all the words by telling the story briefly 
and pointing to each word as it was worked into the story. In- 
stead of pronouncing it herself, however, she had the pupils say 
it in unison. For example, the last word, “afraid,” was inserted 
by the children as she said, “Then the monkey was so that 
he didn’t go near the place any more.”  
-P-A-G-E-139
BEGINNING READING 123 
Oral reading. Rapid, connected, fluent reading to audience 
aided by teacher’s suggestions —Since there were several visitors 
present, Miss Lucas then had the children read the story orally, 
in a rapid, continuous manner. She gave occasional suggestions 
such as the following: 
“Tl ask Esther to start reading.” 
“Remember, now you are speaking to him, Esther.” 
‘What did he answer, Frank ?” 
“Then how did the crocodile find the monkey ?” 
“What did the crocodile say, Robert ?” 
“Not quite so fast, Emerson, so that we can hear every word.” 
“Now, Constance, these people are talking back and forth. Read 
just as if you were talking—just as you would say it if you were the 
monkey.” 
Plan to represent characters of story and improve reading. 
—At the end of the reading there was a discussion arising out 
of the teacher’s suggestion that next time they read the story 
again, with different children taking the parts of the characters 
in the story. Miss Lucas asked, ‘How might we make our read- 
ing better?” The pupils gave various answers, such as: “Get 
our words together” ; ‘Read as people talk” ; ‘‘ Know the place.” 
New problem of rate of oral and silent reading.—It is 
scarcely necessary to enter into a detailed statement of the prin- 
ciples of teaching reading illustrated by this second-grade lesson. 
We find the same careful balance of (1) rapid grasp of meanings 
and (2) skill in independent analysis of new words which pre- 
vailed in the later weeks of the first-grade reading described 
earlier in the chapter. We find that the pupils were now real 
readers ; they could take up a story adapted to their stage of de- 
velopment and get from its silent perusal the meanings and de- 
light which it was intended to convey. We find, however, certain 
facts which need further discussion and interpretation; for ex- 
ample, though the children were reading silently, in the ordinary 
sense of the term, most of them were vocalizing quite audibly, 
showing that they were not reading any faster than they could
-P-A-G-E-140
    
124 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
pronounce the words. The boy Emerson, however, could recog- 
nize words and read so rapidly silently that when he came to 
read orally he enunciated so fast that the audience could not 
easily understand him. He had become such a skilled, rapid, 
silent reader that Miss Lucas provided him with much supple- 
mentary reading to fill his time. 
Scientific studies of reading presented in the next chapter. 
—Such instances raise important questions concerning the rates 
of oral and silent reading and the relations between oral and 
silent reading. These questions have been subjected to careful 
" experimental study, from which important conclusions have been 
derived concerning methods of teaching silent reading, particu- 
larly beyond the second grade. In our next chapter we shall dis- 
cuss these scientific studies preparatory to the final chapter on 
reading, which will deal with skillful silent reading. 
Review for general principles and impressions of artistic 
teaching.—Meanwhile, if the reader is not already tired out by 
this long chapter, she may return and read the introductory sum- 
mary on page 72, in order to grasp the larger principles of 
teaching which it has presented. At the same time she must re- 
member that the chapter aims also to give the reader a general 
impression of the detailed technique that is involved in supe- 
rior, artistic teaching. Consequently it is desirable to review 
also the accounts of Miss Hardy and Miss Lucas in action, so 
as to retain an impression of the delightful spirit and refined 
technique which prevailed in their rooms. 
BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTES ON BEGINNING READING 
Practical manuals.—The best concrete examples of how to teach be- 
ginning reading are found in the teachers’ manuals that accompany series 
of school readers. The teacher who is interested should compare eight or 
ten of these inexpensive manuals to see how successfully they provide a 
proper balance between fascinating content reading and drill in the formal 
elements of word recognition. 
Scientific investigations.— References to scientific studies of beginning 
reading will be found at the end of the following chapter on scientific 
investigations of reading.

CHAPTER VI 
SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATIONS OF READING 
Main points of the chapter.—1. This chapter supplements Chap- 
ter V, “Beginning Reading,” and Chapter XI, “Skillful Silent 
Reading.” 
2. Scientific investigations of reading fall into two classes: (1) 
laboratory experiments and (2) devising and using tests of the effi- 
ciency of methods of teaching reading. 
3. Two lines of laboratory experimentation are here described: 
(1) experiments upon the flash recognition of words as wholes; (2) 
experimental studies of eye movements in reading. 
4. Tests for oral and silent reading are described. 
5. From the results of these scientific investigations four impor- 
tant conclusions are derived; namely : \ 
a. That silent reading requires special practice. 
b. That phonetic training is desirable to make accurate readers. 
c. That the difficulties of poor readers can be scientifically diag- 
nosed and remedial measures prescribed. 
d. That skillful silent reading involves active, selective thinking 
closely related to acquiring ideas and solving Bonieais 
Relation to science and art discussions of earlier chapters. 
—In the chapter on handwriting we noticed the large contri- 
bution made by laboratory investigations in determining methods 
of teaching. For example, we described the experiments which 
have proved that methods that endeavor to have children form 
the letters without finger movements are fallacious. We de- 
scribed also the development of scales to measure the quality of 
handwriting. Such scales make it possible, we noted, to measure 
exactly the success of any system of instruction in improving 
handwriting. We noted also the general characteristics of such 
scientific investigations; namely, that they are mathematically 
precise, objective, verifiable, expert, and impartial. In the chap- 
125
-P-A-G-E-142
  126 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
ter on spelling we gave further examples of precise, objective, 
scientific studies and then distinguished between the science and 
the art of teaching. The latter, we said, refers to the actual 
skilled conduct of lessons. 
Owing to the fact that this art of teaching has been more 
generally and highly perfected in teaching beginning reading 
than in any other subject, we presented in our first chapter on 
reading detailed pictures of the artistic teaching of beginning 
reading and made only casual reference to scientific investiga- 
tions which justify the practices described. In the present chap- 
ter it is our purpose to describe a number of such investigations 
of reading and then, in a later chapter (namely, XI), to discuss 
at length skillful silent reading as a tool in acquiring ideas and 
meanings. 
Sections of this chapter.—We shall consider the following 
features of the scientific investigations: 
I. Laboratory studies of word recognition and of eye move- 
ments (p. 126). 
II. Tests and scales for measuring oral and silent reading 
(p. 131). 
III. Conclusions from scientific investigations (p. 135). 
These conclusions concern the relation between oral and si- 
lent reading, the value of phonetic instruction, the needs of 
pupils who read poorly, and the nature of reading as active, 
selective thinking. 
Section I. Laporatory STupIEs oF WorD RECOGNITION 
AND OF EYE MovEMENTS 
Experiments upon word recognition. Flash recognition — 
In our account of the first-grade lessons (on pages 86-90) we 
described methods of teaching children to recognize whole 
words at a glance, with no previous training in the alphabet or 
in spelling or phonetics. This practice is quite contrary to the 
old-fashioned idea that children had to know the letters before 
they could learn words. The obvious success of the children is 
 
-P-A-G-E-143
  SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATIONS OF READING 127 
sufficient proof of the possibility of whole-word recognition, but 
certain psychological experiments help to confirm our belief in 
the importance of such practice. Some of the earliest experi- 
ments upon such flash recognition were conducted by exposing 
letters and words to view for a measured fraction of a second. It

line which tells the complete story of his eye movements is photographed on a 
motion-picture film 
was found that a long, familiar word could be recognized at a 
glance, but if disordered letters were displayed it took much 
longer to make them out. 
Span of recognition of poor readers and good readers.—Sim- 
ilar experiments were used later in diagnosing the differences be- 
tween children in reading ability. Thus, at The University of 
Chicago special studies were made in 1916, of the “span of rec-
-P-A-G-E-144

ognition” of poor readers and good readers. It was found that 
when six words were exposed for about one fifth of a second a 
good reader recognized on the average more than five of the 
words, while a poor reader recognized less than two words. 
These experiments explain the value of the flash drills in the

Experiments in investigating eye movements. Huey’s 
notable book.—In describing the first lesson in book-reading (on 
pages 104-105) we noted that the children used a manila-paper 
line-marker to guide their eyes along the line. This practice illus-

trates the recognition by psychologists that eye movements are 
a fundamental factor in reading. Their early efforts to study 
these movements began with simple observations of the eyes of 
a person who is reading. If you will make such observations

SILENT-READING PAUSES BY A POOR READER IN THE FIFTH GRADE 
From Judd’s account of investigations at The University of Chicago 
you will see that the eyes proceed by jerks and pauses as they 
read a line, and then make a long sweep back to the beginning 
of the next line. One of the pioneer investigators of these move- 
ments was E. B. Huey, who published in 1908 a book entitled 
“The Psychology and Pedagogy of Reading” (2). This book 
was widely read by persons interested in the teaching of read- 
ing, and is still an excellent source of information about the 
history, psychology, and teaching of reading.
-P-A-G-E-146
  130 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
Juda’s elaborate studies.—The most elaborate photographic 
studies of eye movements have been made during recent years 
at The University of Chicago, under the direction of Professor 
C. H. Judd. The special apparatus used cost approximately 
six thousand dollars, and was purchased with a special research 
fund furnished by the General Education Board. A professor of 
education, on leave of absence from another institution, spent 
a whole year designing improved apparatus and making photo- 
graphic records of the eye movements of many adults and chil- 
dren. A skilled mechanic spent many days in constructing the 
apparatus. An account of the results of these experiments, 
together with much other material, is given by Judd in a mono- 
graph entitled “Reading: its Nature and Development,” pub- 
lished in 1918. (3.) During 1921 Professor Judd was granted 
fifteen thousand dollars from the Commonwealth Fund to carry 
further these experimental investigations. 
Latest investigations.—As this book is being printed the 
results of the fifteen-thousand-dollar investigations mentioned 
above have just appeared in a series of monographs (4, 15, 17) 
by Professors C. H. Judd, G. T. Buswell, and W. S. Gray of The 
University of Chicago. Those by Judd and Buswell contain 
further elaborate studies of eye movements. 
A poor reader may pause twice as often as a good reader — 
In these experimental studies of eye movements the most strik- 
ing contrasts appear between good and poor readers in (1) the 
number of pauses which they make in reading a line, and 
(2) the amount of confused movement that occurs. We cannot 
go into these differences here in detail, but may stop a moment 
to note the difference between a good reader and a poor one in 
the number of pauses, as illustrated in the figures on pages 128 
and 129. Each vertical line indicates one pause. It will be no- 
ticed that the rapid fourth-grade reader paused only six times in 
reading the first line, while the poor fifth-grade reader paused 
thirteen times. Later we shall have occasion again to refer to 
the results of such experimental studies of eye movements.

Section II. Tests AND SCALES FOR MEASURING ORAL 
AND SILENT READING 
Measuring reading is a complex matter.—Another type of 
investigation of reading has been the construction of scales for 
measuring the rate and quality of reading. In the chapter on 
handwriting we noted that the construction of a handwriting 
scale was comparatively easy, owing to the simplicity of the 
subject matter. In the case of reading, the opposite is true. 
The complete measurement of skill in reading is very difficult, 
owing to the complexity of the subject matter and of the inter- 
pretative reactions of the pupils. However, great progress has 
been made in devising scales for measuring reading ability. We 
shall note briefly a few out of the considerable number of scales 
that have been published. 
Oral-reading tests.and scales. Gray’s standardized para- 
graphs.—One of the most widely used scales for measuring 
ability in oral reading is that devised by Professor W. S. Gray 
of The University of Chicago. (9, 10, 11.) In testing a pupil’s 
ability in oral reading Gray has him read certain standard para- 
graphs aloud to an observer, who makes a written memorandum 
of the following factors in the reading: 
1. The amount of time consumed. 
2. The number of errors made. 
a. Gross mispronunciations. 
6. Minor mispronunciations. 
c. Omission of words. 
d. Insertion of words. 
e. Repetition of words or groups of words. 
f. Substitution of one word or group of words for another. 
Sample paragraphs illustrating increasing difficulty.—The 
material which the pupils read in this test consists of a series 
of short paragraphs which gradually increase in difficulty. The 
first, the third, and a part of the fifth paragraph are reproduced 
on page 132.

You will easily note the progressive growth in difficulty. The 
twelfth and final paragraph, which is sufficiently difficult to test 
even high-school pupils, reads in part as follows : 
The hypotheses concerning physical phenomena formulated by the 
early philosophers proved to be inconsistent and in general not uni- 
versally applicable. 
Humorous illustration of a pupil’s experience with the test. 
—The pupil who is being tested reads successive paragraphs 
until he makes seven errors in each of two paragraphs. The 
increasing difficulty for the pupil is illustrated by the case of a 
boy who had recently been subjected to several medical exami- 
nations. Finally, after getting started in school he encountered 
the oral-reading test. As he progressed through the paragraphs, 
and these became harder and harder, he stuttered and stam- 
mered, backed up, hesitated, and finally said to Mr. Gray, 
“T don’t know what you’re looking for, Mister, but whatever it 
is, I’ve sure got it.” 
Standard scores derived from wide use of the scale.—While 
devising and standardizing his tests (about 1915), Gray applied 
them extensively and carefully in eleven cities in Illinois. Later 
they were carefully used in surveys of reading in Cleveland, 
Grand Rapids, St. Louis, and Indianapolis. From the results 
of thus testing thousands of children in oral reading of the same 
paragraphs, Gray has derived a series of standard scores, or 
achievements, which we can use in evaluating the success of the 
teaching of oral reading in any room, school, or system of schools. 
At the same time we can use the tests and scores in diagnosing 
the needs of particular pupils and determining necessary changes 
in our methods of teaching reading. We shall refer to some of 
the results of such studies of methods of teaching after noting 
examples of tests for measuring silent reading. 
Silent-reading tests and scales. Courtis tests.—One of the 
best-known and most convenient silent-reading tests is that of 
S. A. Courtis, the well-known educational investigator. (7.)
-P-A-G-E-150
  134. TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
This test is given to a class as a whole, which renders it more 
easy to administer than an oral-reading test, which must neces- 
sarily be given individually. In the Courtis test each child is 
given a little pamphlet containing a story and directions for 
reading it. In the first part of the test, upon a signal from the 
examiner, the pupils begin to read. At the end of each half min- 
ute the examiner says “Mark,” whereupon the pupil draws a 
circle around the last word and goes on reading. From such 
records the rates of silent reading can be calculated. 
Quality of pupil’s studious comprehension tested by questions. 
—The second part of the Courtis test measures the quality of 
the pupil’s silent reading by having him write the answers to 
a number of printed questions about the story. The material 
for this part of the test is printed in the back of the pamphlet 
and is divided into paragraphs followed by questions, as indi- 
cated in the following sample: 
When the day of the party came, Daddy planted a Maypole and 
Mother tied it with gay-colored ribbons. There were to be games 
and dances on the grass and a delicious supper, with a basket full of 
flowers for every child. 
1. Were the children to have anything to eat? 
2. Were they going to play on the grass? 
3. Were they going into the house to dance? 
4. Were the baskets to be full of flowers? 
5. Was it Daddy who tied the ribbons to the pole? 
Rapidity and quality of comprehension are both measured.— 
There are some fourteen paragraphs similar to the above in the 
story and a total of about seventy questions. The time is limited 
so that even the best pupil will not complete the test, but all 
may do several minutes of work, thus giving them time really to 
get into the swing of the task. The directions say: “Do not 
guess at the answers. If you do not remember what the story 
said, read the paragraph just above the questions again and 
again until you find the right answer.” Thus the test considers 
both the rapidity and the accuracy of the pupil’s comprehension.
-P-A-G-E-151
SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATIONS OF READING 135 
Great variety of silent-reading tests. From word recognition 
to solving problems.—A somewhat similar test was published by 
Professor E. L. Thorndike, of Columbia University, in 1914 and 
the results were used by him in a number of articles in which he 
discussed the mental processes of pupils in understanding or mis- 
understanding sentences. (13-14.) Numerous other tests have 
been devised to measure various phases of reading, ranging from 
the mere ability to recognize words to the ability to solve puzzle 
problems expressed in words. Since 1920 various investigations 
have been conducted to determine the value and reliability of 
the different kinds of test of ability in reading. For further dis- 
cussion of these investigations the reader is referred to references 
7 and 8 at the end of this chapter. It will be more to our purpose 
to turn to a brief study of the ideas concerning methods of teach- 
ing reading which have been derived from both the experimental 
laboratory studies of reading described earlier in the chapter and 
the use of tests and scales which we have just been considering. 
Section III. CoNcLusioNs FROM SCIENTIFIC 
INVESTIGATIONS 
Differences in oral and silent reading. Silent rate usually 
exceeds oral after fourth grade.—One of the important facts 
that early appeared from the use of standard tests of the read- 
ing of school children was that the rate of silent reading becomes 
more rapid than the rate of oral reading somewhere in the 
middle grades. We had one example of this fact in the second- 
grade lesson described on page 124, in which one bright boy had 
already reached the place where he read second-grade material 
more rapidly than the pace of good oral reading. In the case 
of most pupils this change comes in the third or fourth grade, 
depending upon the natural talent of the pupils and the methods 
used in teaching reading. After this point in the grades most 
pupils will read more rapidly silently than orally. A pupil’s rate 
in careful oral reading will never exceed that of clear pronuncia-

tion, whereas his silent rate may advance far beyond this, be- 
coming as high as three hundred and seventy-five words per 
minute when he reaches high school if he is an especially skilled 
reader. This means that he could read a page of the length of

Compare the oral-reading record on the opposite page 
page 134, if it contained ordinary story material, in about one 
minute. To read it orally, at the ordinary pace, would take 
about two minutes. 
Photographs show differences in eye movements in silent and 
oral reading.—One of the most objective and impressive demon- 
strations of the differences between a pupil’s reading processes 
in silent reading and those in oral reading is found in the photo- 
graphic records of eye movements. A clear case is shown in the

same pupil in silent and in oral reading. In the silent-reading

four stops and at very regular spacial intervals; in the oral- 
reading record it appears that his eyes made from seven to four- 
teen stops in a line and at quite irregular intervals. 
Hence overemphasis on oral reading may interfere with silent. 
—Thus we have derived from the scientific investigations two 
important lines of evidence on the relation of oral and of silent 
reading. The school tests show us where, on the average, the
-P-A-G-E-154
  138 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
silent rate begins to exceed the oral, and the photographic rec- 
ords of eye movements show how many more eye pauses occur 
in oral as compared with silent reading. From such evidence 
investigators conclude that the common emphasis upon oral 
reading above the third grade seriously interferes with the de- 
velopment of habits of skilled silent reading, and that it would 
be better to give various types of practice especially suited to 
develop skill in silent reading. In a later chapter on silent read- 
ing we shall present an extensive analysis of the needs of pupils 
who are acquiring such skill, and shall describe some of the 
practice devices used by skilled teachers of silent reading. 
Necessity of phonetic training shown by investigations. — 
Another useful point that has been determined by the scientific 
investigations is the necessity of special training in the accurate 
recognition of new words, such as the phonetic training described 
in the preceding chapter. This fact appeared most clearly in 
Gray’s survey of the results of teaching reading in one of the 
Middle West cities that maintains an excellent school system. 
Like several progressive schools of recent years, this system 
tended to neglect the so-called “formal” drill in word recogni- 
tion. The fallacy of this neglect appeared when their results in 
reading were compared with those from other cities as measured 
by Gray’s tests. In speaking of the situation in this particular 
city, Gray says: 
The results of the oral-reading tests showed that the pupils . . . 
ranked low in accuracy of pronunciation and in ability to attack new 
words. Classroom observations revealed similar weaknesses. . . . 
Many teachers had no [phonetic] devices [for helping pupils] and 
some were almost helpless, if not inaccurate, in their attempts to 
aid the pupil. Several principals stated that many teachers had lit- 
tle or no knowledge or training in regard to the use of phonetics. As 
evidenced by the facts cited above, there is real need of giving the 
problem of word analysis serious consideration in [this city]. Uni- 
form methods of developing independence and accuracy in pronun- 
ciation should be considered, and teachers should be trained to make 
effective use of the adopted method. (11: 511-512)

  SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATIONS OF READING 139 
Diagnosis of needs of poor readers by means of scientific 
devices.—The scientific devices for measuring reading ability 
which we described earlier in the chapter aid not only in the 
broad study of the average efficiency of reading instruction as 
illustrated in the above quotation, but are also especially useful 
in diagnosing the needs of pupils who are having special dif- 
ficulties with reading. A number of excellent investigations of 
types of poor readers have been published, and some are men- 
tioned at the end of this chapter. Below is a paraphrase of 
Judd’s description of the reading defects of a poor fifth-grade 
reader (whom we shall call Grace) and the methods used to im- 
prove her reading. She had attended three different schools up 
to the time of her entering The University of Chicago Ele- 
mentary School. 
Dislikes silent reading—Grace had been included in ‘the tests 
. and proved to be a slow, inefficient reader. . . . She could not 
unravel the intricacies of the printed lines which proved easy to 
many of her classmates. . . . The school physician’s record showed 
that she was a normal, healthy child with no special defects in eyes, 
ears, or throat... . Silent reading was particularly distasteful to 
her. She always settled down to it reluctantly. .. . From the home 
came the same story: “She has never read a story to herself, though 
she has several attractively illustrated children’s books. Frequently, 
however, after eagerly studying the illustrations in a new book, she 
begs to have the story read to her, saying: ‘You read it, mother. 
I can’t understand it very well when I read it myself.’” 
Tests reveal special difficulties —The various tests given to Grace 
revealed some interesting facts... . The pronunciation of unfa- 
miliar words seemed most difficult. She usually hesitated a moment 
before attacking a new word and then whispered to herself the spell- 
ing of the word, letter by letter... . Her rate in silent reading 
showed an unusual condition. It was slower than the oral rate... . 
From the data it was evident that her difficulties in reading were due 
to a lack of familiarity with printed words and to a lack of method 
of working out new or unknown word forms. 
Eighteen weeks of special training—In an effort to help her to 
overcome this handicap she was given various types of training dur-  
-P-A-G-E-156
      
140 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
ing eighteen weeks; namely, six weeks devoted to a great deal of 
oral reading, six weeks on drills in phonetics and in word analysis, and 
six weeks including a great deal of silent reading. 
Later tests and improvement.—The silent-reading and oral-reading 
tests which had been given before this special practice began were 
repeated. . . . Grace now showed by her whole manner that she 
felt competent to do the tests. She wrote her answers with a pre- 
cision and directness not at all characteristic of her earlier tests. . . . 
Her teachers reported that she now read with [considerable] ease and 
expression. .. . She seemed to enjoy reading silently... . Fre- 
quently she expressed a preference for reading a passage silently, 
saying, “I can do it faster that way.” (3: 82-90) 
Individual cases reveal need of balanced training plus indi- 
vidual attention.—An account of the treatment of some seventy 
poor readers and of extensive remedial teaching in a large city 
is reported by W. S. Gray in his monograph “ Remedial Cases 
in Reading: their Diagnosis and Treatment” (15), which should 
be read in order to get some comprehension of the complexity 
of reading habits and processes and of the varied needs of poor 
readers. One pupil may read poorly because of absence during 
certain crucial months in the primary grades when the funda- 
mentals of phonetics were being taught. Another may read 
poorly because he has had too much phonetic training and has 
never acquired correct habits and skill in interpreting the mean- 
ings of printed words. However, in spite of this variety of 
needs and processes, the difficulties of poor readers may be 
roughly classified into certain types, which a well-organized 
system of teaching reading will provide for by balancing the 
mechanical and interpretative features of the training in some 
such way as we outlined in the preceding chapter. When an 
individual pupil, because of absence or mental peculiarity, fails 
to profit from such balanced training he should be carefully 
tested and given appropriate individual training. 
Investigators emphasize reading as a tool in acquiring 
ideas.— Up to this point in our discussion of the results of scien- 
tific investigations of reading we have considered the following
-P-A-G-E-157
        SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATIONS OF READING 141 
matters: (1) the differences between oral and silent reading, 
and the consequent need of specific training in silent reading; 
(2) the defects of systems that neglect phonetic training, and 
the consequent need of such training; (3) the diagnosing of the 
needs of especially poor readers by standard tests, and the means 
of correcting special defects. Finally, we may note how investi- 
gators of reading processes have come more and more to con- 
sider reading as a tool to be used in acquiring ideas and as a 
process involving careful, controlled thinking instead of mere 
passive perusal of a page. 
Thorndike discusses processes of understanding sentences.— 
Professor Thorndike’s tests of the understanding of sentences, as 
we noted on page 135,haveled him to give special emphasis to the 
idea that good reading involves good thinking. From the returns 
from his tests he illustrates at great length the failure of poor 
readers to think carefully when reading a paragraph to obtain 
answers to certain questions. For example, consider the follow- 
ing test, in which a pupil would have to do somewhat the same 
type of thinking as he would in studying paragraphs in history 
eography to ascertain particular facts. The test reads in 
Read this and then write the answers to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 
and 10. Read it again as often as you need to. 
It may seem at first thought that every boy and girl who goes to 
school ought to do all the work that the teacher wishes done. But 
sometimes other duties prevent even the best boy or girl from doing 
so. If a boy’s (or girl’s) father died and he had to work afternoons 
and evenings to earn money to help his mother, such might be the 
case. A good girl might let her lessons go undone in order to help 
her mother by taking care of the baby. 
1. Must a good boy always do all his school work ? 
2. Will a good girl sometimes fail to get all her lessons ? 
3. What are some conditions that make even the best boy leave 
school work unfinished? —___ 
Other questions complete the test. (14: 105)
-P-A-G-E-158
    
142 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
Reading is active, selective thinking.—In commenting on the 
types of errors that pupils make in such a reading test, Thorn- 
dike says: 
There seems to be a strong tendency in human nature to accept 
as satisfactory whatever ideas arise quickly—to trust any course of 
thought that runs along fluently. If the question makes the pupil 
think of anything, or if he finds anything in the paragraph that 
seems to belong with the question, he accepts it without criticism. 
. This fishing around in the text for something to use, and its 
use without reorganization, [present] perhaps the most debased form 
of selective thinking which school work shows. ... The extent to 
which it prevails amongst pupils in even the higher grades shows the 
need for practice in reading and study. I am inclined to think, how- 
ever, that the cure for it is not to repress the verbatim use of wrong, 
irrelevant, or roughly appropriate quotations, but to permit it plus 
careful examination of the quotations to see if they really do meet 
the need. . . . The comprehension of textbooks . . . [is] far above 
the level of merely “passive,” or “receptive,” work. When the read- 
ing of textbooks . . . is really passive, or receptive, comprehension 
will rarely result... . “To read” means “to think,” as truly as 
does “to evaluate” or “to invent” or “to demonstrate” or “to 
verify.” (14: 107-114)      Conclusion of first two chapters on reading.—This » 
tion typifies the tendency among investigators to think of 1 
ing not primarily in terms of the special “reading period” bu 
also in terms of what the pupils do with their textbooks and 
supplementary books in every subject. Thus regarded, reading 
becomes an important factor in the processes of acquiring ideas 
and solving problems. Hence before we can complete our 
discussion of reading (in a chapter entitled “Skillful Silent 
Reading”) it is desirable for us to get clearly in mind the 
opportunities and methods for acquiring ideas and solving prob- 
lems that prevail in a modern progressive elementary school. 
This we shall undertake in Part II of the text. First, however, 
we must discuss the last of the “four elementary skills” in- 
cluded in Part I; namely, skill in arithmetical calculation.

CHAPTER VII 
SKILL IN ARITHMETICAL CALCULATION 
Main points of the chapter.—1. The arithmetical problems of 
everyday life have been canvassed, in order to determine the arith- 
metical skills that pupils should acquire. 
2. Even kindergarten children may be introduced to the simplest 
of these skills, while pupils in the upper grades may well undertake 
some calculations formerly reserved for high schools. 
3. In the actual teaching of any arithmetic topic the first step is 
to give pupils clear ideas of the social realities and of the arithmeti- 
cal process by means of (1) clear-cut examples, (2) thoughtful scru- 
tiny by the pupils, and (3) varied applications. 
4. To attain automatic accuracy and speed scientifically organ- 
ized drill systems should be followed. 
5. In order to ascertain each pupil’s needs, attainments, and prog- 
ress, and to measure the success of the teaching, standardized tests 
should be given periodically. 
6. In choosing a good textbook standards derived from the above 
points may be applied in evaluating each book. 
The last of the “four elementary skills.”—This chapter 
will conclude Part I of the text. In this part we have included 
the acquiring of skill in four comparatively elementary types of 
learning ; namely, handwriting, spelling, beginning reading, and 
arithmetical calculation. In all these we have emphasized the 
matter of attaining automatic skill. This gives a certain amount 
of unity to this part and aids the reader in grasping the book 
as a whole. 
General lines of educational thought illustrated.— The pre- 
ceding chapters have familiarized the reader with certain gen- 
eral methods of thinking about each skill, such as determining 
its value in social life, its place in each stage of child life, the 
145
-P-A-G-E-162
  146 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
best means of introducing it, and the need of using scientifically 
organized drill systems and standard tests. Similar lines of 
thought will appear in our discussion of the teaching of arith- 
metical calculation as illustrated in the titles of the divisions 
of the discussion. 
Sections of the chapter.—The titles for the sections of the 
chapter are as follows: 
I. Determining the important arithmetical skills from social 
needs (p. 146). 
II. Adapting problems to pupil maturity (p. 148). 
III. Giving pupils clear arithmetical ideas (p. 151). 
IV. Using scientific drill systems (p. 156). 
V. Measuring the arithmetical skills attained (p. 163). 
VI. Selecting a good arithmetic textbook (p. 167). 
Section I. DETERMINING THE ImpoRTANT ARITH- 
METICAL SKILLS FROM SociaAL NEEDS 
Social needs ascertained from problems of everyday life. 
—We noticed in our chapters on handwriting and spelling how 
the school’s task had been greatly simplified by ascertaining 
how well an ordinary person needs to write in social life and 
what words he commonly needs to spell there. Similarly, the 
teaching of arithmetical calculation has been simplified in recent 
years by dropping from the course of study those topics that pu- 
pils will seldom encounter in daily life and by emphasizing those 
topics and arithmetical operations that are in common use, Sev- 
eral scientific investigations have been made to ascertain what 
topics and operations are most common in the problems of busi- 
ness, industry, and the home. 
Problems from parents listed.—One of these investigations, 
conducted by Professor G. M. Wilson, secured its data by hav- 
ing upper-grade children in Iowa collect through a -period of 
two weeks the problems solvéd by their fathers and mothers. 
Thus about five thousand problems were secured from house-
-P-A-G-E-163
  SKILL IN ARITHMETICAL CALCULATION 147 
keepers, farmers, merchants, mechanics, contractors, etc. When 
these problems of every day had been classified it appeared 
that buying and selling furnish most of the problems of these 
citizens and that keeping accounts and percentage furnish many 
more problems than do certain other activities. Most of the 
examples involved only one arithmetical process, and most of 
the numbers, figures, or quantities used contained less than four 
places. These facts suggest the large value of practice with 
simpler problems in school than those frequently found in the 
textbooks. (6: 137) 
Salesmanship problems.—In order to determine what kinds 
of arithmetic are needed by clerks and customers, Professor 
C. Woody analyzed problems from a large hardware store, a 
department store, and a grocery store. Some of his conclu- 
sions were similar to those given above. Others, however, 
concerning salesmanship problems were these: (1) Multiplica- 
tion and addition are used more than division and subtraction. 
(2) Mental calculations are so commonly used by customers 
and are so frequent in certain types of stores that there is great 
social need for teaching much mental arithmetic in the schools. 
Problems from practical corporation schools investigated.— 
In order to ascertain what mathematical processes should be in- 
cluded in ninth-grade mathematics, Professor H. O. Rugg and 
his associates examined the problems found in the courses of 
study in practical mathematics offered by corporation schools, 
such as those maintained by the manufacturers of automobiles, 
electrical appliances, rubber, etc. From these results Rugg con- 
cluded that such a course should include, on the basis of social 
worth: 
Training in (a) the use of letters to represent numbers; (b) the 
use of simple equations; (c) the construction and evaluation of 
formulas; (d) the finding of unknown distances by means of (1) scale 
drawings, (2) the principle of similarity in triangles, (3) the use of 
the properties of the right triangle; (e) the preparation and use of 
statistical tables and graphs to represent and compare quantities. (5)
-P-A-G-E-164
148 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
Obsolete topics dropped and current topics emphasized. — 
From such investigations the makers of textbooks and courses 
of study in elementary mathematics have derived a scientific 
basis for dropping many unimportant topics and problems and 
for emphasizing mathematical processes that are in frequent 
daily use. 
Supplement with quantitative insight into civilization — 
Since this chapter is concerned merely with computational skill 
in arithmetic, such investigations of the actual problems en- 
countered in various common, practical pursuits outline cor- 
rectly the processes to be emphasized in giving such skill. There 
is another large use of training in arithmetical thinking, however, 
which we should not overlook, and that is in the reading of 
accounts of financial conditions, railroad operations, taxation 
issues, crop reports, baseball scores, etc. in newspapers and 
magazines. For this purpose pupils need to be trained in doing 
quantitative thinking that is much broader in scope than is 
usually required in the daily personal uses of arithmetical cal- 
culation. 
Section II. Apaptinc ProsLeMs To Pupit Maturity 
Distribution according to pupils’ ability to comprehend.—. 
Having determined what types of arithmetical topics are useful 
in everyday life, our second question concerns the distribution 
of these topics through the grades according to the pupils’ 
abilities to comprehend them. 
First-grade possibilities. Do not judge by the exceptionally 
deficient.—We immediately encounter considerable disagree- 
ment concerning the age at which pupils should begin the study 
of number. For example, in one school near Chicago no num- 
ber work is permitted in the first grade, and a supervisor seri- 
ously reprimanded a first-grade teacher for asking the children 
to count some objects in the room. On the other hand, in a 
neighboring school even the kindergarten children count and 
 
-P-A-G-E-165
SKILL IN ARITHMETICAL CALCULATION 149 
measure and use numbers frequently. It takes little observa- 
tion of such teaching to prove that many young children of 
average intelligence can acquire correct number ideas and use 
these in their work and play. To be sure, there will frequently 
be found in the primary grades some children who have special 
difficulty with arithmetic, just as some have special difficulty 
with music. However, we should not base our general practice 
upon such exceptional cases. 
Kindergarten practice with numbers. Activities and attain- 
ments.—An example of the arithmetic practice that may prof- 
itably be given to many kindergarten children is contained in 
the following account of the number work in that grade in The 
University of Chicago Elementary School: 
Counting.—There are frequent occasions during the day when 
counting becomes necessary. A certain number of children may be 
needed for a game, or a pattern for a string of beads or seeds re- 
quires the grouping of the right number of units. The children even 
learn to count to thirty by keeping track of the number of pupils 
present each day. 
The games sometimes call for the grouping of children in twos, 
threes, and fours. For example, one child starts the skipping, then 
chooses a partner, and these two in turn choose other partners, the 
children spontaneously keeping count of the increasing numbers up 
to eight. Some games require a small number of children. Any child 
may be asked to choose the number by stepping out from the group 
and calling the names of four or five children. If he chooses too few 
or too many, he is helped by the group to correct the error. 
In using the building blocks simple problems may be presented 
which involve the use of numbers. For example, the children may 
be asked to make the foundation of a house four blocks long and 
three blocks wide, or to make a table four blocks long with enough 
chairs for six people. 
Addition and subtraction of number groups within six.— There 
are a few simple games which have for their main object the teach- 
ing of addition and subtraction of small numbers. For example, six 
objects (balls, blocks, or sticks) are laid on the table. The children 
count them. Then one child is asked to close his eyes, and another
-P-A-G-E-166
  150 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
takes away one or more of the objects. The first child must tell 
the number which have disappeared. The game may be varied by 
adding objects to an original group of two or three etc. 
Division of material into halves or quarters—Some of the build- 
ing blocks are divided into halves and quarters. The children become 
familiar with these parts in playing with the material. In putting it 
away they must fit the proper pieces together in order to get the 
blocks back into the box. In playing with the blocks the terms 
“halves” and “quarters” are used in connection with the objects. 
In constructing paper furniture or boxes, baskets, and other forms, 
it is often necessary to divide the paper into halves and quarters, 
which the children learn to do through experimentation or from 
direction. 
Recognition of objects having geometrical form.—The toys and 
building blocks are in the form of spheres and cylinders, cubes and 
other rectangular prisms. The paper used in construction is in the 
form of oblongs, squares, circles, or triangles. No special point is 
made of teaching these forms, but the children acquire the terms 
simply as a part of their vocabulary. 
In comparing the relative sizes of the blocks, paper, sticks, etc. 
the children learn to make intelligent use of the terms “large and 
small,” “wide and narrow,” “long and short.” 
Attainments.—In the course of a year many of the children should 
acquire the following abilities : 
To count from one to thirty. 
To recognize groups of objects up to five or six. 
To add and subtract number groups within six. 
To recognize halves and quarters, as these divisions appear in 
material, and to divide material which they handle into halves and 
quarters. 
To recognize and name the following geometric forms: sphere, 
cylinder, cube, circle, square, oblong, triangle. 
Upper grades. Simple algebraical processes comprehended by 
many pupils —If, now, we turn our attention from the primary 
grades to the upper grades and ask what kind of mathematics 
is adapted to the pupils there, we find a similar movement; 
namely, to bring in topics and processes that were once consid- 
ered suitable only for pupils in higher grades. One of these 
 
-P-A-G-E-167
  SKILL IN ARITHMETICAL CALCULATION 151 
processes is the use of the equation. This is easily introduced 
in connection with the area of a rectangle when written thus : 
area = base times the height, 
or area = base x height, 
or a=) X:h. 
Percentage formulas may also be conveniently expressed as 
equations. In solving problems by substituting the numerical 
values for the letters in these formulas, the pupils secure prac- 
tice in substitution. Thus we see how three simple processes 
—namely, (1) the use of letters to represent numbers, (2) the 
use of simple equations, and (3) substitution in formulas,— 
to which pupils were formerly usually introduced in high schools 
are now found to be adapted to many pupils in the upper grades. 
Again, however, we need to keep in mind the fact that the 
abstractions of mathematics give peculiar difficulty to some 
learners. Sometimes the latter are of low mental ability in gen- 
eral, but sometimes they merely have a specialized incapacity for 
mathematics and may do well in other subjects. These pupils 
should probably be excused from all except the most elementary 
arithmetic, but their incapacities should not determine the gen- 
eral location of useful mathematical topics in the grades. For 
this purpose the general adaptability to the average pupil is a 
better guide. When this basis is adopted we find that under 
skilled teaching certain mathematical processes can be under- 
stood by many pupils at a much younger age than was formerly 
supposed. 
Section III. Givinc Pupits CLear ARITHMETICAL IDEAS 
Give experiences with enough clear-cut, typical examples. 
—When the teacher undertakes to teach an arithmetical topic 
that has been found, in general, to be adapted to the pupils of 
her grade, one of the first questions she confronts is how to 
make the new arithmetical ideas or processes clear to the chil- 
dren. One of the answers to this question is, Give them ex-
-P-A-G-E-168
  152. TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
perience and practice with enough clear-cut, typical, varied 
examples. Simple illustrations of this rule are found in the 
kindergarten teaching described above, where the children were 
given many concrete number experiences in counting beads, 
pupils, blocks, sticks, etc., in dividing blocks and paper into 
halves and quarters, and in handling cubes, cylinders, etc. 
Similar examples from a first grade were found in our account 
of the incidental counting in Miss Hardy’s reading lessons 
(described on pages 77-119). There the children sometimes 
counted the chairs needed for the reading group, the number 
of lines in the reading chart, the number of new words they had 
learned, the number of books needed, the number of titles in 
the contents of a new book, etc. In this process they not only 
found delight but were acquiring correct number ideas through 
personal experiences and activities with a variety of objects. 
Example of teaching buying and selling. Amateur versus 
skilled teaching.—An interesting illustration of the need of such 
personal experiences with realities in order to give correct arith- 
metical ideas is found in an account given me by Miss Estelle 
Daly of her weird experiences in teaching buying and selling 
during her first year of teaching and of her later modifications 
of her methods. She wrote as follows: 
Amateur’s method. Unintelligent ciphering—One rare autumn 
day when I first began to teach I began an arithmetic lesson some- 
what as follows : 
“Girls and boys, here is a problem on the blackboard. I shall 
read it to you. John Brown had sixteen cents; how many pencils 
at four cents each could he buy and still have four cents left over? 
Hands up. What do you do first?” 
I selected the most eager of the wildly waving hands and received 
this answer “Multiply.” 
“Multiply what?” I asked. 
The boy answered, ‘‘ Multiply sixteen by four.” 
With a gasp I questioned again, “Who has a different idea?” 
And from the fewer number of hands now presented I guessed that 
many were in sympathy with the first speaker.
-P-A-G-E-169
  SKILL IN ARITHMETICAL CALCULATION 153 
The opinion of child number two was alike startling and revealed an 
unpenetrated abyss: “Subtract the four cents and multiply by twelve.” 
“Put your hands down and think,” I commanded. Then after 
considerable silence pupil number one again vouchsafed an answer. 
“If he had sixteen cents you subtract the four cents and get 
twelve pencils.” 
“I told you to think. Don’t hold up your hand till you have rea- 
soned it out. If John Brown had sixteen cents,” I began again, 
dwelling pointedly on each word, but was interrupted. 
A third pupil shouted frantically, and I thought the desired end 
was now at hand: “You subtract the four and divide by twelve.” 
“Class, pass to the blackboard,” said I. “Draw sixteen circles and 
mark each one cent. Now draw a big circle around the first four, 
the second four, and the third four, so: 
OOOO }| OOOO || OOOO } OOOO 
How many sets of four cents have you?” 
Child number four answered emphatically, “Four.” 
“But John wanted to have four cents left. Leave the last four, 
and how many have you left?” 
Child number two: “We have three sets of four, and four left 
over.” 
“Now,” said I, with relief (for the period was about up), “How 
many pencils did John buy?” 
Child number one: “He bought twelve pencils.” 
Hereupon the recess bell rang. They filed out. I sat down and 
stared into empty space with a blank expression and a poor notion 
of the blessings of the teaching profession. 
Improved method—The next day I began all over again. The 
course I followed then is the one I now use, and is as follows: 
Much aim.—I start the arithmetic period with a well-rounded aim 
to develop in the children accuracy and the power to analyze care- 
fully, to reason to a conclusion, and to state the result in good form. 
I want them to understand the nature of the problem and to acquire 
skill in dealing with numbers. I have aim enough to lead anyone to
-P-A-G-E-170
  
154 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
believe that not only the present year’s work but the whole future 
life of each particular child depends on the issue of the lesson. 
Review of purchasing experiences.—In preparing the class for the 
situation I question them about the various stores where supplies of 
all sorts are bought—meat, shoes, bread, groceries, and so on, get- 
ting lots of enthusiasm and much voluntary information. I lead up 
to school supplies and where obtained. Many contributions are 
made as to what some particular child bought lately, what he paid 
for it, and what change he received. 
Playing store-——Then I suggest playing bookstore. Each pupil 
contributes ideas concerning where we shall have it and how it is to 
be made—whether of board or blocks or what. Generally we end 
with a pine board stretched across a corner and supported by chairs. 
It is neatly piled with every supply necessary to a schoolroom like 
ours. The children lend books and pencils and tablets for the oc- 
casion. I furnish some real pennies and nickels and dimes, being 
very careful to watch all transactions so as to insure the safety of 
the treasury. 
Behind the board stands as clean a child as is available, for a 
merchant must first of all be clean. One after another the children 
receive money from me, with which they go to the bookstore and buy 
back the supplies they have contributed. I always give them money 
that will require change. This puts a little calculation into the deal. 
The next time we play bookstore the prices are changed. Each child 
gets a new problem in buying and receiving change. The merchant, 
too, is different each time. 
Tackling the John Brown problem.—A few lessons like this, and 
we are ready for the John Brown problem. I have the children all 
nicely seated and tell them the problem in story form. “A little boy 
had sixteen cents,” and so on. The answer is generally correct. 
Drill—I have other problems of buying and selling pencils written 
on the blackboard. Individuals read and solve them, others criti- 
cize in case of error, and everybody contributes what he may. 
Application to local buying. —I next ask how much pencils cost at 
the different stores where the children trade. Prices vary. At some 
places they are three for five; at others, one cent; elsewhere, five 
cents. We discuss the good and bad features of the pencils and 
decide where we can get the most for our money. We conclude with 
a good, wholesome determination to buy where buying is best.
-P-A-G-E-171
  
SKILL IN ARITHMETICAL CALCULATION | 155 
Progressive schools and textbooks give clear ideas of 
arithmetical realities:—These lessons bring out clearly the 
value of giving pupils the personal experiences with realities 
that are necessary to give them an understanding of the arith- 
metical processes involved in some common type of arithmetical 
calculation. In progressive elementary schools similar pro- 
cedures are followed in introducing children to every arith- 
metical process, from the simple counting of the kindergarten 
and first grade up to the study of banking in the higher grades. 
Similarly, the better textbooks take great care to give pupils 
clear ideas of the social realities and the arithmetical processes 
involved in each common type of arithmetical calculation that 
they introduce. 
“Herbartian five formal steps” for clarifying a new proc- 
ess.— Miss Daly’s later lessons on buying and selling (described 
above) illustrate for us also parts of a general procedure in 
teaching new abstract ideas which is known as the “Herbartian 
five formal steps.” These steps were especially popularized in 
this country from 1895 to 1905 and are a useful device for 
aiding a teacher to plan her lessons in teaching pupils some 
arithmetical processes. The steps may be named and described 
in the following terms: 
1. Preparation. Put the pupils in a favorable frame of mind 
for the new lesson by arousing their interest and reviewing re- 
lated past experiences. 
2. Experiencing examples. Give pupils real personal experi- 
ences with carefully selected, varied, clear-cut typical examples 
which illustrate the process to be taught. 
3. Active analysis. Require active analysis and comparison 
of these examples by the pupils. 
4. Generalizing. Aid the pupils to build up a rule to be fol- 
lowed in using the new process. 
5. Practice in using. Provide well-selected problems or exer- 
cises to give the pupils practice and skill in using the process 
with more and more complex problems.  
-P-A-G-E-172
  156 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
The three most important steps for good arithmetical think- 
ing.—To be sure, these rules do not apply in introducing pupils 
to every arithmetical process. For example, the kindergarten 
and first-grade children who are learning to count do not formu- 
late or follow any definite rules in their arithmetical thinking. 
Moreover, even when a rule is adopted a teacher will frequently 
be justified in stating it for the pupils without waiting for them 
to formulate it. However, the teacher who is keenly interested 
in making good arithmetical thinkers of her pupils will fre- 
quently observe all the above steps. Certainly, if reduced to 
the following three, they are especially important in clarifying 
pupils’ ideas of new arithmetical processes. 
1. Clear-cut examples. Give pupils real experiences with 
enough clear-cut, varied, typical examples of the process. 
2. Thoughtful scrutiny. Raise questions which require them 
to examine these examples thoughtfully so as to comprehend the 
general procedure. 
3. Varied applications. Give practice in using the process in 
new and varied examples that range from easy, simple cases to 
difficult, complex ones. 
Section IV. Usine Screntiric Dritt Systems 
Recently developed for securing automatic accuracy and 
speed.—The last of the steps noted above—namely, varied ap- 
plications—is important not only in clarifying and extending 
the pupil’s comprehension of the process but also in giving him 
habitual accuracy and speed in using it. Great progress has 
been made in scientifically organizing arithmetical drill lessons 
and materials, for increasing each pupil’s accurate and rapid 
use of the fundamental operations. We shall illustrate these im- 
proved drill methods and materials by some examples and then 
formulate certain general rules to be followed in such teaching.* 
1 Pages 157-162 are reprinted in part from the chapter on drill in the 
author’s “General Methods of Teaching in Elementary Schools.”
-P-A-G-E-173
  SKILL IN ARITHMETICAL CALCULATION 157 
Drills with flash cards.—One of the first forms of such im- 
proved drill to be devised was the use of “flash cards.” Each 
card has on it numbers as shown in the following examples: 
7 
4 
Enough cards may be made by the teacher to provide for each 
simple operation in which she desires to give drill. The same 
pack may be used for several different types of drill ; for example, 
a pack containing cards like the left-hand sample above may be 
“flashed” for drill in addition or multiplication or subtraction. 
Eleven points of technique in fifth-grade drill with fraction 
cards.—The fine technique that a teacher may develop in using 
such drill cards is illustrated in the following account of a fifth- 
grade teacher’s method of conducting a six-minute drill game 
in multiplication with a pack of fraction cards. The cards con- 
tained such fractions [| . In carrying on the drill 
game in multiplying these, each of the following numbered 
points represents a distinct item in the teacher’s technique : 
1. She stood before the class in such a position that the light 
fell on the cards so that all the pupils could see well and none 
faced a window. 
2. She appointed a boy to time the game. 
3. She wrote the multiplier (for example, 4) on the black- 
board behind her. 
4. She made sure that all the children understood what they 
were to do. 
5. She then said, “Ready, go!” 
6. She flashed the first card (for example, 2) by bringing it 
from the back of the pack to the front. The first child gave the 
answer as quickly as he could say it. 
1nRO 
 
-P-A-G-E-174
  
158 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
7. (1) If his answer was correct, she flashed the next card 
to the front of the pack. (2) If his answer was incorrect the 
next child gave the answer, and the card was dropped on the 
desk for future use and the next card was flashed. 
8. This process was continued around the class until the 
whole pack of cards was used. 
g. The teacher then picked up from the desk the cards to 
which incorrect answers had been given and flashed them again, 
calling on the pupils who had missed them (if she could remem- 
ber without hesitation who they were). 
to. She then asked the timekeeper for the time consumed and 
wrote it on the board—for example, “3 min. 30 sec.”—under 
the record of the previous day for the same pack of cards and 
opposite the record of “3 min. 25 sec.” made by another group 
of children. 
11. She concluded with remarks intended to arouse interest 
in improving the record until it should equal a standard score, 
such as three minutes for this pack. 
Six minutes, fifty problems, zeal and attention, application.— 
The total amount of time consumed in this drill in getting the 
class ready, flashing the cards, writing the record on the board, 
and making remarks about it was about six minutes. During 
this period nearly every child in the group of twenty-two was 
called on three times, and the total number of problems cor- 
rectly worked was about fifty. Practically every child was 
attentive to each of these because of the intense interest in im- 
proving the score. After this drill, problems of areas, requiring 
the use of fractions in square measure, were assigned. 
This drill lesson illustrates a group recitation in which 
the whole class gives attention to a common center. We 
shall now give two examples in which the children work as 
individuals. 
Addition combinations to 9 +9 to be said in thirty seconds. 
—Our first example of individual drill occurs in the third grade, 
where children memorize for rapid oral reproduction all the
-P-A-G-E-175
    
SKILL IN ARITHMETICAL CALCULATION 159 
forty-five addition combinations up to 9-++-9. These are all 
printed or mimeographed on a sheet of paper, in mixed order, 
making five rows similar to the following : 
50 7 eoateOneeo a C4067 2 Dials eA at oka alm bee) 
A copy of the sheet is given to each child when the teacher is 
sure that the combinations are generally understood. The tech- 
nique in this case is also somewhat complex. The ultimate 
achievement expected of each child is ability to give orally the 
answers to all the combinations, in any order on the chart,— 
up or down, from left to right or right to left,—in thirty seconds. 
Every day some children are given trials and their records kept ; 
for example, a child may in the beginning require forty-five 
seconds, decrease the time rapidly in a few days to thirty-seven 
seconds, but not attain the desired goal of thirty seconds for 
many days. Practice is given by concert drills and individual 
drills in school, and the children are urged to repeat the answers 
to someone at home who will time them and correct them. 
Systematic and thorough ; saves time from useless responses ; 
analyzes and corrects wrong inner responses.—The outcome of 
the device is automatic skill in using rapidly the above- 
mentioned combinations in problems involving addition. The 
device is systematic and thorough in achieving this end, since it 
gives drill on all these combinations. It saves time in many 
ways. For example, it eliminates the time consumed in the old- 
fashioned drills by the teacher’s asking, “What is 9 and 6, 
Johnny ?” and waiting for Johnny to wake up and reply. It 
saves Johnny the time of saying “‘g and 6 are—.” He says 
merely “fifteen,” as quickly as he can, when he sees on the 
paper. Moreover, in Johnny’s later life it saves him from saying 
“g and 6” thousands of times; instead, when he encounters 3 
in an addition problem he merely thinks “fifteen,” just as he 
thinks “cat” when he sees the word, instead of thinking “‘c-a-t.” 
In order to make sure that each child does read off each answer  
-P-A-G-E-176
  160 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
in this automatic way, without going through some roundabout 
process, the teacher has to make a careful study of the children 
who are slow in learning to repeat the combinations in the de- 
sired time. For example, one such child was found who, when 
adding $, instead of merely recalling the answer, 16, thought of 
it as follows: 9+2+2-+2+1=16. The teacher had to 
break up this habit and get the child to think automatically _ 7 
Printed sheets of problems for fundamental processes. 
Timed tests, individual practice, self-correction, individual ad- 
vancement.—The second example of individual drills is an elab- 
orate extension of the above type of device to the working of all 
kinds of problems in adding, subtracting, multiplying, and divid- 
ing, the problems being printed on sheets or cards ready to be 
distributed to the pupils. For example, each pupil may be given 
a sheet or card printed full of such problems in addition as the 
following : 
Inna 
INO 
IANO 
  All he has to do is to write the answers as rapidly as he can on 
transparent paper or through perforations in the problem card. 
He does not begin to write until the teacher gives the signal for 
the whole class to begin. At the end of seven minutes the signal 
may be given to stop. All pupils then cease work. They may 
turn the problem cards over, to compare their answers with the 
correct ones, which may be printed on the back of the cards, or 
they may use some other device for self-correction. Each pupil 
makes a record of the number of problems which he has right. 
If he has completed all the problems correctly, in the allotted 
time, he is given a different card of problems to work next time. 
The children who do not secure satisfactory scores on the first 
card may practice on it during study periods until the next timed 
test on it is given, when they are tested on it again, at the same 
time that other pupils are tested on the lessons to which they 
have progressed.
-P-A-G-E-177
  SKILL IN ARITHMETICAL CALCULATION 161 
Elaborate systems organized by authors and publishers ; elab- 
orate routine instituted by teacher.—It is obvious that this 
scheme, which provides many sheets of printed problems and 
permits different pupils to progress at different rates and work 
with different sheets, is much more elaborate than the other 
examples of drill devices which we have described. It involves, 
in the first place, elaborate printed materials—printed sheets or 
cards of problems which have been carefully devised so as to 
give drill on all combinations and operations. This, however, 
is not a task that confronts the teacher, as it has already 
been performed by the authors and textbook companies. The 
teacher’s task is to accustom herself and the pupils to the routine 
which is completely described in the teacher’s manual that ac- 
companies the drill materials. This need present no special diffi- 
culties, since the most elaborate routine can easily be taught to 
children if the teacher will take the trouble. This type of drill 
exercise, however, calls not only for elaborate routine organiza- 
tion but also for careful attention to the individual needs of 
pupils. Thus it saves much time in two ways: first, by having 
printed problems at hand, so that pupils spend most of their 
time in arithmetical thinking instead of wasting it in copying 
problems ; and, second, by permitting pupils to cease drill on 
processes which they have already made perfectly automatic 
and to spend their time on other assignments from which they 
will derive greater profit. 
Examples introduce to principles of drill.—The three ex- 
amples of modern drill methods which we have described— 
namely, fifth-grade drill with fraction cards, third-grade oral 
drill with a chart of addition combinations, and systematic 
written drill in the middle grades with ready-made printed 
sheets of problems—serve to familiarize us sufficiently with 
concrete schoolroom drill situations to enable us to understand 
easily the general principles of teaching to be followed in or- 
ganizing effective drill lessons, and to these we shall now turn 
our attention.
-P-A-G-E-178
  162 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
Six rules for scientifically organized drill.—These prin- 
ciples, or rules, for organizing drill may be stated as follows: 
1. Only correct practice makes perfect ; therefore 
a. Delay drill until the pupils understand the process. 
b. Secure nearly absolute accuracy at a favorable speed. 
2. Avoid wasting time on nonessential and accessory processes. 
3. Secure zeal, interest, and concentration of attention with 
short, snappy drills. 
4. Use ready-made, scientifically organized systems. 
5. Continue drill until precise standard scores are maintained. 
6. Give practice in using abstract forms and processes in con- 
crete situations. 
For a full interpretation of these rules the reader is referred 
to the chapter entitled “Drill and Practice,” in the author’s 
“General Methods of Teaching in Elementary Schools.” A 
special comment, however, is needed upon our rule to “secure 
nearly absolute accuracy at a favorable speed.” 
Accuracy versus speed.—The proper balancing of accuracy 
and speed in arithmetical practice has not been adequately de- 
termined by scientific investigations. Experiments with certain 
classes indicated that groups of pupils who were trained to add 
as rapidly as possible proved to be more accurate than groups 
that were trained to add merely with special attention to 
accuracy. In the face of such evidence, however, Thorndike 
makes the unique suggestion that the standards of accuracy 
that have prevailed in these experiments have been so low as to 
be entirely unacceptable in the practical use of arithmetic in 
business and science where essentially perfect calculations are 
the only ones that can be relied upon. Hence, he says, 
A precision of from 995 to 997 [correct operations] out of tooo 
being required, and ordinary sagacity being used in the teaching, 
speed will substantially take care of itself. . . . Nothing save sure 
memory of the facts operating under the conditions of actual 
examples will give [this precision]. And such memories will operate 
with sufficient speed. (10: 108)

Section V. MEASURING THE ARITHMETICAL SKILLS 
ATTAINED 
A sample test. The Cleveland spiral arithmetic tests—Our 
chapters on handwriting, spelling, and reading have made us 
familiar with the general need for measuring the attainments 
and progress of pupils through the use of scientifically con- 
structed tests and scales. For similar measurements of skill in 
arithmetical calculation numerous tests and scales are on the 
market. On page 164 you will find portions of one of these 
tests which was used in the survey of the Cleveland schools. 
Only a portion of the problems of each set is given, but these 
portions are so chosen as to illustrate what is known as the 
“spiral” feature of this test. For example, after a pupil has 
worked through a lot of easy problems in addition, subtraction, 
multiplication, and division he then encounters a second series 
with more difficult problems involving the same operations, and 
finally meets a third series with even more difficult ones. For 
example, you will find excerpts from all the sets of addition 
problems printed for convenient comparison at the tops of the 
celumns on page 164. You will note that the addition prob- 
lems in Set A are very easy; those in Set E are somewhat 
harder, because the columns are longer; and those in Set J 
are very much harder, because the pupil has to keep his attention 
concentrated during the addition of a fairly long column of fig- 
ures. This test includes also problems in common fractions — 
an easy set and a more difficult one. Consequently the test may 
be used in the primary grades, where the children can solve the 
easy sets, as well as in the upper grades, where they can be 
tested adequately with the more difficult sets. 
Pupil’s needs and weaknesses diagnosed by varied graded 
tests.—Furthermore, such graded sets of varied problems may 
be used in diagnosing each pupil’s special needs, since peculiar 
weak spots may appear in his arithmetical knowledge or skill, 
although he may be strong in certain operations. Thus we found

in the case of my son, at the age of twelve, that he had no special 
difficulty with problems in addition, subtraction, or division, but 
needed special drill in multiplication. These special weaknesses 
may be so detailed or specific as to involve merely certain com- 
binations of numbers, such as 9 + 7, even though the general 
process is understood. After these special difficulties have been 
detected in the case of each pupil, efforts should be made to 
remove them by a few moments of careful individual explana- 
tion and drill. 
Standardized tests used to measure efficiency of arithmetic 
teaching.—The scientific tests and scales for measuring skill 
in arithmetical calculation have been used not only to ascer- 
tain each pupil’s attainments, progress, and peculiar needs but 
also to measure on a large scale the relative success of various 
teachers, schools, and school systems in giving arithmetical skill. 
To illustrate the comparative measurements of results from dif- 
ferent school systems we reproduce on page 166 a sample page 
from the survey of the Gary schools. In the diagram the heavy 
line represents the attainments of the Gary schools, while the 
light, dotted curve represents the attainments of thousands of 
children in other school systems. Speed standards are shown 
at the top and accuracy standards at the left. 
Measured results show danger of neglecting drill.—The results 
from the measurements of arithmetical skill in the Gary schools 
illustrate the dire consequences of neglecting carefully organized 
drill in arithmetical calculation. Thus, Courtis, who supervised 
the measurements in Gary, says: 
All the Gary curves fall much below those of conventional schools. 
For all operations the ¢welfth-grade scores in accuracy at Gary do 
not attajn to the conventional levels of eighth-grade accuracy, and 
for all except multiplication the rate of work is also lower. The 
eighth-grade results in rate are about equal to those of the conven- 
tional fifth grade, and in accuracy are lower. In division only do the 
eighth-grade scores in accuracy much exceed those of the fourth 
grade in the conventional school. (11: 158)

Srction VI. SELEcTING A Goop ARITHMETIC TEXTBOOK 
Textbooks properly determine many features of arithmetic- 
teaching.—Since most teachers of arithmetic very properly 
have their work determined to a large extent by the textbook 
which they use, we may appropriately close this chapter 
with a statement of some of the qualities of a good up-to- 
date text. This statement is derived to a considerable extent 
from the points brought out in the preceding sections of the 
chapter. 
Qualities of a good text, derived from preceding sections 
of the chapter.—Among the important characteristics, then, of 
a good arithmetic textbook, are the following : 
1. Its topics should be those that scientific studies of the 
everyday uses of arithmetic have shown to be common. 
2. These topics should be graded according to scientific 
studies of the arithmetical abilities of pupils at different ages. 
These show, for example, that first-grade children as soon as 
they can read may use a simple textbook, while upper-grade 
children may well begin some topics formerly reserved for high- 
school texts. 
3. The social reality of each topic or process should be 
clearly presented by means of descriptions, pictures, diagrams, 
etc. 
4. In order to give a clear notion of each arithmetical proc- 
ess it should be introduced with clear model examples. 
5. Frequently these model examples should be accompanied 
by carefully phrased questions or suggestions which stimulate 
pupils to scrutinize thoughtfully the various steps in the process. 
6. The rules or summary descriptions of processes should be 
formulated in language that is precise and yet simple enough 
to be readily comprehended by the pupils. 
7. Adequate problem material should be provided to clarify 
the pupils’ comprehension of the important and varied applica- 
tions of each process. 
 
-P-A-G-E-184

8. The first problems in’each set should be so easy that dull 
pupils may readily solve them. The remaining problems should 
be arranged in the order of increasing difficulty, so as to give 
practice for all grades of arithmetical talent. 
9. Scientifically organized sets of abstract drill exercises 
in the fundamental operations (including also fractions) should 
be assembled at psychological intervals through the book. 
1o. Materials or directions for organizing scientific tests of 
the pupils’ needs and attainments should accompany the text, 
together with standard scores for these tests by which the gen- 
eral success of the teaching may be judged. 
Conclusion of chapter on arithmetical calculation.—In this 
chapter we found occasion to follow the same general lines of 
discussion as appeared in the preceding chapters. Hence we con- 
sidered such topics as adapting arithmetic to the needs of every- 
day life, organizing the instruction according to the pupil’s 
mental age and psychological possibilities, giving him clear ideas 
of the processes to be learned, providing adequate drill experi- 
ences to give automatic skill, and measuring the attainments 
of pupils to ascertain their needs and progress as well as the 
general success of the teaching. I regret that space does not 
permit more detailed discussion of methods of teaching such 
stumblingblocks for many pupils as subtraction, long division, 
and fractions. For such details we must refer the reader to 
some of the excellent special books on the teaching of arith- 
metic which are listed in the bibliography at the end of the 
chapter. 
Conclusion of Part I (on “four elementary skills”).—This 
will conclude our discussion of the methods of giving pupils 
automatic skills in handwriting, spelling, simple reading, and 
arithmetical calculation which we grouped together in Part I 
of the text under the title “Four Elementary Skills.” We shall 
now turn our attention to certain more advanced types of learn- 
ing, which, for convenience, we have grouped in Part IT under 
the title “Four Thoughtful Processes.” While we shall have
-P-A-G-E-185
  SKILL IN ARITHMETICAL CALCULATION 169 
much less reliable scientific evidence than in the case of the four 
elementary skills of Part I, many readers will, no doubt, find the 
discussions of these four thoughtful processes more interesting 
because they introduce us to some of the more advanced and 
colorful features of social and intellectual life.

  PART II. FOUR THOUGHTFUL 
PROCESSES 
CHAPTER VIII 
INTRODUCTION TO PART II 
Reflective thinking a prominent feature.—This chapter 
introduces us to Part II of the book. The title and types of 
learning of this part appear as follows: 
Part II. Four Thoughtful Processes. 
Understanding Social Life. 
Problem-solving, or Practice in Thinking. 
Skillful Silent Reading. 
Learning to communicate Ideas. 
These chapters have been grouped together not only to aid 
the reader in grasping the book as a whole but also because 
carefully controlled reflective thinking by the pupil is commonly 
a prominent feature of all the types of learning included. In 
this respect these types contrast somewhat with the “four ele- 
mentary skills” of Part I, in which the element of automatic 
behavior appears more strongly than in these “four thoughtful 
processes.” 
Insight plus three intellectual skills.— You will notice as 
you glance over the chapter headings of Part II that they in- 
clude, first, knowledge or understanding of contemporary social 
life and then three intellectual skills; namely, skill in problem- 
solving, in silent reading, and in communicating ideas to an 
audience. If you‘will recall the characteristics of some of the 
best-educated persons you have known, you will probably find 
that they have this social insight and these three intellectual 
skills developed to a high degree. In this respect they are 
171

  172. TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
greatly superior to the graduates of the old-fashioned elemen- 
tary school, which gave its pupils little beyond the automatic 
skills in the three R’s which we discussed in Part I. As we pro- 
gress through the four chapters that follow we shall find out 
how a progressive elementary school of today succeeds in giving 
pupils something of the advanced social insight and intellectual 
skills that were formerly included only in a higher education. 
We shall take up first the discussion of understanding social 
life because the rich fund of ideas, problems, and reading ex- 
periences which a study of social life affords provides the pupil 
with many opportunities for securing practice in problem-solving, 
silent reading, and communicating ideas.

CHAPTER IX 
UNDERSTANDING SOCIAL LIFE 
ACQUIRING SYMPATHETIC INSIGHT INTO 
CONTEMPORARY CIVILIZATION 
A LiperAL ELEMENTARY EDUCATION 
Don’t be scared by the subtitle. —I realize that the first 
subtitle of this chapter contains such a formidable array of 
large words that it may frighten the timid teacher away. If you 
will begin the chapter, however, you will not find it difficult 
reading, and after you understand its content the subtitle may 
remain among your favorite pedagogical possessions. 
Main points of the chapter.—1. To determine what ideas pupils 
need in order to understand contemporary social life, we may ex- 
amine the table of contents of a weekly review of the world’s events. 
2. The topics found there are predominantly economic, industrial, 
and geographic, but embrace also all phases of social life, including 
politics, religion, literature, sport, etc. 
3. In the elementary school such topics are studied in geography, 
community life, history, fiction, arithmetic, and applied science. 
4. A description of a modern course of study in community life 
and history shows how pupils progress from a study of the local 
grocery store to an understanding of international migration and 
similar large topics. 
5. The methods used to give pupils social insight along these lines 
are such as appeal to their instinctive interests, give vivid personal 
experiences, and stimulate attentive reflection. 
6. Similar methods are used in teaching geography, fiction, etc. so 
as to give insight into contemporary civilization. 
7. These methods give not only a considerable amount of precise 
information, but also secure social insight through developing feelings 
of meanings and sympathetic attitudes in the pupils.

Section I. Wuat IbEAs cIveE INSIGHT INTO 
CoNTEMPORARY LIFE? 
Securing a cross-section view of the world today.—The 
titles of this chapter imply that we desire to give elementary- 
school pupils a liberal education by cultivating in them sym- 
pathetic insight into contemporary civilization. Our first problem 
in carrying out this desire is to ascertain what ideas a pupil 
needs in order easily to understand the social life of his day and 
generation. We may secure an answer to this problem by ex- 
amining a cross section of contemporary life as represented in the 
contents of those American periodicals that review the principal 
topics of the day. As an example we may begin with the titles 
of the articles found in an issue of one of our popular weekly 
reviews which appeared shortly after the close of the World 
War. The reader is invited to glance these topics over rapidly 
with two questions in mind: (1) In what subjects in school 
would most of these topics be touched upon? (2) What are 
the possibilities of training pupils from five to fourteen years 
of age so that they can easily grasp the meanings of such dis- 
cussions and do intelligent thinking along similar lines? For 
example, the first topic (about the operation of railroads) falls

in the subjects of economics and civics; and elementary pupils 
might be prepared to understand it through studies of trans- 
portation, public| utilities, etc. 
Contents of issue of a weekly review of the world— 
Under the general heading “Topics of the Day” the following 
articles appeared:

Reviews of New Books. 
Investment and Finance. 
Miscellaneous. 
Broad scope of these titles. Preponderance of the geograph- 
ical, the industrial, and the economic.—lIt is obvious from this 
list that nearly all phases of contemporary life are reflected and 
reviewed in this magazine—politics, war, industry, trade, ap- 
plied science, religion, art, literature, sport, etc. At the same 
time it is apparent that the majority of the articles contain dis- 
cussions of a geographical, economic, or industrial character. 
The geographical discussions are suggested by such phrases as 
“The Irish Plan,” “Japan and Lenin,” “Armenia and Turkey,” 
1The articles appearing under “‘Personal Glimpses” include the fol- 
lowing: “The Recent World Cataclysm that went Astray”; “Haiti’s Prog- 
ress as Ward of the United States”; “War-Torn French Farm Lands 
again under the Plow”; ‘Can a Senator become President ?”; “History’s 
Answer”; ‘“‘Greens,’ ‘Whites,’ ‘Reds, ‘Radishes,’ and other Russian 
Troubles”; “Hod Eller tells how he Beat the White Sox”; “Harry Lauder

“Swedish Methods,” “Spitzbergen and Norway,” ‘German 
and French,” “South American Markets,” “Transvaal Gold,” 
“French Farm Lands,” “ Russian Troubles,” ‘ Mexico’s People,” 
“Haiti’s Progress.” The economic and industrial trend is 
easily seen. The first article deals with the fundamental mat- 
ter of transportation, the second with labor, the fifth and the 
sixth with prices. Many of the articles under “Science and 
Invention” are of a similar character; for example, “ Railroad 
Safety,” ‘“Depersonalizing Industry,” ‘Camphor-Farming,” 
“Barrels,” “Trolley Fares.” The two sections entitled ‘'World- 
Wide Trade Facts” and “Investment and Finance” are specifi- 
cally economic in character. 
Value of such ideas. Liberal elementary education gives 
sympathetic insight into such contemporary matters — The value 
of training pupils to comprehend such discussions and to be 
interested in them readily appears when we think of a liberal 
education as one which gives a sympathetic insight into con- 
temporary life and civilization. As suggested above, such a 
table of contents represents a cross section of contemporary life 
and civilization. The fact that it is so broad in scope suggests 
that the pupil must be given a similarly broad education, in- 
cluding a study of politics, war, industry, trade, applied science, 
religions, art, literature, sport, etc. 
Such insight arises from thousands of ideas and meanings.— 
In order that the pupil may understand or feel the full meaning 
of any one of these discussions it is necessary that he possess 
the necessary fund of related ideas. These are often of a very 
technical and specific character. For example, the discussions 
of courts for labor disputes and of government ownership of 
railroads involve much technical information and judgment. 
An understanding of “ Armenia’s Chance with Turkey” calls for 
considerable knowledge of historical and geographical facts. 
To comprehend “Bushido in Judgment on the West” requires a 
knowledge of Japanese civilization and a balanced international 
point of view that can arise only from a thorough study of other 
 
-P-A-G-E-194
178 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
civilizations than our own. Even to understand “Hod Eller 
tells how he Beat the White Sox” involves a technical knowledge 
of baseball such as is possessed by few girls. 
The best education gives a large stock of knowledge, ideas, and 
meanings.—Our conception of a liberal education as giving a 
sympathetic insight into contemporary life and civilization, and 
the recognition of the fact that such insight in each field of 
human activity is based on a body of related knowledge, give 
us some inkling of the importance of acquiring ideas and mean- 
ings in school. So important is this phase of education that 
William James, our greatest American psychologist and philoso- 
pher, said that the best-educated mind is the one that has the 
largest stock of ideas and meanings ready to meet the largest 
possible variety of the emergencies of life, and that the lack 
of education means largely the failure to have acquired such 
ideas, and the consequent liability to be floored or “rattled” in 
the vicissitudes of experience. (21: 146) 
Value of knowledge, ideas, and technical information over- 
looked by superficial educators.—Frequently we read state- 
ments by educators to the effect that the best education does not 
include such learning of specific ideas, information, and mean- 
ings, but, instead, consists of “developing the child’s powers, 
particularly his originality and initiative.” We shall have spe- 
cial occasion to show the falsity of this view in the following 
chapter on problem-solving, where Thorndike points out the 
fact that the greatest problem-solvers in any line are also com- 
monly possessed of very large stores of technical information in 
that line. The capable person with a good education has, in 
addition to several other things, both knowledge and intellectual 
skills, As indicated in Chapter VIII, the skills consist primarily 
of (1) skill in silent reading, (2) skill in problem-solving, and 
(3) skill in communicating ideas to others. The knowledge 
possessed by such a well-educated person consists usually of 
(1) thousands of facts and other ideas within his special business 
or profession plus (2) thousands of facts and other ideas and 
   
-P-A-G-E-195
  
UNDERSTANDING SOCIAL LIFE 179 
meanings which give him a broad insight into many phases of 
contemporary life and civilization. 
How can elementary schools give insight into many phases 
of contemporary life?—It is not the task of the elementary 
school to give pupils the specialized technical knowledge of some 
special business or profession, but it is its function to give 
pupils as broad an insight as possible into many phases of con- 
temporary life. In considering how it can do this we shall now 
return to the two questions which the reader was asked to keep 
in mind in reading the table of contents of the weekly review. 
Two questions: subject content and pupils’ possibilities — 
The two questions which the reader was asked to keep in mind 
while running over the contents of the weekly magazine cited 
above were these: (1) In what subjects in school would most 
of these topics be touched upon? (2) What are the possibilities 
of training pupils from five to fourteen years of age so that they 
can grasp the meanings of such discussions and do intelligent 
thinking along similar lines? We shall take up the first of these 
questions for special discussion in Section IT. 
Section II. Wuat ScHoot SuBjJEcTs GIVE IDEAS 
or SocraL Lire? 
Geography and community life. Include direct study of 
many contemporary topics.—Many of tke topics included in 
the cross section of contemporary life composing the table of 
contents of a weekly review are contained in the old, well- 
established subject of geography and the newer study of com- 
munity life and civics. When geography is broadly conceived 
as the study of the earth as the home of men, or as a study of 
the relations of the earth and human society, it includes not 
only such matters as the location of Japan, Armenia, Turkey, 
Sweden, Spitzbergen, Palestine, and Haiti (countries which are 
discussed in the above magazine) but also discussions of their 
natural resources, industries, trade, population, the character of
-P-A-G-E-196
  180 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
their peoples, etc. The newer subject of community life pro- 
vides additional study of the same topics, with the emphasis 
upon the characteristics of group life as determined by human 
wants, needs, interests, etc. For example, looming large in the 
study of community life are the great human problems of food, 
shelter, clothing, fuel, power, transportation, health, and recre- 
ation, while many other detailed problems, such as the study 
of inventions and of exchange, are considered. 
History. Historical method used in study of recent events.— 
There are, however, a number of other school subjects which 
prepare pupils for an insight into contemporary life, although 
not quite so obviously as do the study of geography and com- 
munity life. One of these is history. The way in which history 
contributes readily appears when we realize that in nearly all 
our study of geography and social life we use the historical 
method; that is, we study the facts of yesterday or last week 
or last year or the last ten years, etc. These, of course, are his- 
torical materials, even though they be very recent. When we 
realize the difficulties of getting materials together for a study 
of remote parts of our own country, and when we appreciate the 
desirability of having these materials systematically organized 
so that the work of each grade builds a foundation for later 
grades, it becomes obvious that our data for helping pupils to 
understand the world of today will nearly always be historical. 
This being the case, our problem is to select from stories of the 
past such material as best illuminates the present. Such mate- 
rial will often not be that of yesterday but of many years ago. 
For example, a study of a recent invention in the cotton indus- 
try does not help us to understand the trend of modern society 
as well as would a study of the influences of the development of 
machinery for cotton factories between 1764 and 1860. 
History frequently a key to the present.— Moreover, present 
events are often so dominated by early historical occurrences 
that the latter furnish a key for understanding the present. 
Recent examples are found in the European tangles over bound-
-P-A-G-E-197
  UNDERSTANDING SOCIAL LIFE 181 
aries between countries—tangles with which the Versailles 
Peace Conference wrestled for months. The understanding of 
each tangle and its unraveling called for much expert historical 
information. In America we find an example of using historical 
study, as an aid to an understanding of present problems, in the 
frequent discussions of the nature of American democracy. Such 
discussions commonly lead back to a study of the Declaration 
of Independence and the Constitution, of the conditions which 
prevailed during the framing of the latter, of the compromises 
which it included, of the changes which have taken place since, 
—notably the increasing tendency to give more power to the na- 
tional government,—etc. In the articles and discussions that are 
reported in the weekly magazines frequent references are made 
to such historical aspects of the questions under consideration. 
Historical reading a contemporary interest.— Finally we may 
note that historical reading is one of the principal forms of seri- 
ous reading and of recreational reading other than that of fic- 
tion. This fact was noted by Professor E. Horn in the following 
paragraph: 
One book out of every ten published in 1913 was history. In 1913 
one book in every seven consulted in the reference department of the 
New York City Library was a history,—more than were consulted 
in geography and travel, science and technology combined. Eight per 
cent of the books drawn for home use were classed as history, as 
compared with three per cent in the case of technology, three per 
cent in the case of science, and three per cent in the case of geog- 
raphy and travel. It must also be kept in mind that a large part of 
the books classified under other headings (notably under biography) 
contain a large amount of historical material. The percentage of books 
in history drawn by children is still larger as compared with those 
drawn by them in science, useful arts, geography, and travel. (4a: 34) 
Historical ideas thus contribute to insight into contemporary 
life-—From these facts concerning history—namely, (1) that 
contemporary review articles use the historical method in de- 
scribing recent events, (2) that history is often a helpful key to
-P-A-G-E-198
  182. . TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
the understanding of present-day problems, and (3) that the 
habit of historical reading is a prominent characteristic of many 
educated persons—it follows that the ideas which history pro- 
vides rank as quite important in giving children a sympathetic 
insight into contemporary life and civilization. 
Fiction-reading. Gives ideas of human nature and of con- 
temporary fiction.—Thus we have shown the part played by 
the study of geography, community life, and history in giving 
pupils ideas that will aid them in understanding the discussions 
of current topics such as those contained in our review maga- 
zines. A fourth subject that contributes greatly to such an 
understanding is the fiction-reading that pupils do during the 
reading periods or just for fun. In a later chapter, on training 
for enjoyment of leisure, we shall discuss such reading from 
another point of view. Here we may note merely two points: 
(1) the ideas of human nature which pupils derive from their 
story-reading influence them in understanding human affairs 
generally ; (2) fiction-reading is one of the most characteristic 
features of contemporary life, and therefore the person who 
would have a sympathetic insight into contemporary civilization 
must be acquainted with its fiction and fiction-writers. 
Arithmetic. Gives ideas needed for quantitative study of con- 
temporary civilization.—Next in our survey of the subjects in 
school that help a pupil to understand discussions of current 
topics we may note the part played by arithmetic. In many of 
the articles in the weekly reviews statistics and other quantita- 
tive materials are used. Thus the article on railroads deals with 
billions of dollars, millions of employees, percentages of earn- 
ings, etc. The article on sugar profiteering discusses sugar at 64 
cents, ro cents, 12 cents, and 25 cents a pound. The Rocke- 
feller gifts are tabulated in another article and shown to total 
$500,000,000. Spitzbergen’s coal shipments are given in thou- 
sands of tons, and its contribution to Norway’s needs is calcu- 
lated. It is the function of arithmetic to give pupils not only the 
elementary number ideas that they may use in their daily deal-
-P-A-G-E-199
  
UNDERSTANDING SOCIAL LIFE 183 
ings but also the ability to understand the larger quantitative 
aspects of social needs and activities. : 
Applied science. Frequently featured.—Finally, we should 
notice that natural science, particularly as applied to human 
industrial or health needs, is not uncommon in current discus- 
sions. For example, in the titles listed at the beginning of this 
chapter the following are concerned with health: ‘Another 
Huge Rockefeller Gift,” “Back to the Nightcap,” “Stock-raising 
Humans,” and “The Joyless Land,” the latter being concerned 
with children’s diseases in central Europe after the war. Applied 
physics is represented in the article on ‘An Invention to foil 
Telephone Eavesdroppers,” and forestry in the articles on “The 
Princess Tree” and ‘“‘Camphor-Farming.” 
Conclusion of contemporary-life subjects. Geography, com- 
munity life, history, fiction, arithmetic, applied science.—Thus 
we have answered the first question which arose from our exam- 
ination of the topics from contemporary life that are discussed 
in a high-grade weekly review. The question was, In what sub- 
jects in school would most of these topics be touched upon? 
Our answer is, Predominantly and directly in the study of 
geography and community life; considerably, but sometimes 
indirectly, in history, fiction-reading, arithmetic, and applied 
science. These subjects, then, and others in some degree, include 
ideas and meanings that may assist in giving pupils a sympa- 
thetic understanding of contemporary conditions and events.

Let us now turn to our second question, What are the possibil-

they can grasp the meanings of such discussions and do intelli- 
gent thinking along similar lines? In answering this question 
we shall describe parts of a course of study which show the
-P-A-G-E-200
  
  184 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
growth of pupils’ ideas as they progress from the kindergarten 
through the grades. We shall take the “Course in Community 
Life, History, and Civics” of the Elementary School of The 
University of Chicago for 1917 because it was published not 
merely in the form of a series of topics but as a series of de- 
scriptions of what the pupils actually do in each grade. Thus

Evidently, however, it was not “on a cold and frosty morning” that these chil- 
dren did it 
we may get not only a notion of the progressive growth of their 
ideas but also suggestions of the teaching devices that are used 
in making their ideas clear, vivid, permanent, systematic, us- 
able, etc. Later we shall take up these devices for special study, 
since they are such big factors in the actual work of the teacher. 
Kindergarten studies immediate environment.—In the 
kindergarten the approach to a comprehension of contemporary 
life and civilization is begun through a study of the home in its 
relation to stores and other features of the immediate environ- 
ment of the children. The general method of procedure is sug- 
gested by the following account of one portion of the activity.
-P-A-G-E-201
UNDERSTANDING SOCIAL LIFE 185 
Playing house-—When the children first come to school they find, 
among other attractive things, such toys as dolls, some doll furniture, 
kitchen utensils, and dishes. They play with these freely, as they do 
also with blocks, sand, and clay. The teacher may easily lead this 
play in the direction of cooking and serving plays. There soon be- 
gins to take form in one corner of the room, therefore, a miniature 
kitchen or dining-room. The teacher then produces a screen house 
(with a door and windows) which serves to inclose this little room. 
The latter may now stay in place as long as it is wanted. 
This playhouse now becomes the center of great interest and ac- 
tivity. Clay utensils and dishes are made, a cupboard to hold them 
is built of blocks, paper is cut for the shelves, paper doilies are cut 
and fringed, napkins are folded, and a meal is planned. 
Playing grocery—A trip to the grocery is necessary to buy a 
cereal, which is then cooked and served by the children. The trip to 
the store suggests the building of a grocery store in the classroom. 
This now becomes the second problem, or project. It calls for much 
planning and experimenting and results very naturally in group work, 
since the final product is a structure made of blocks and boards 
which is large enough for three or four children to play in at the 
same time. Another excursion is needed to get suggestions as to how 
to make the shelves, the counter, and the show windows and to learn 
what a grocery store really carries for sale. Numerous lesser prob- 
lems present themselves for the children’s solving: vegetables and 
fruits of clay must be shaped and colored accurately enough to be 
readily recognized, and baskets made to hold them; paper bags must 
be contrived; pictures must be made to show what canned goods are 
in stock; pocketbooks and money for the buyers must be provided 
and delivery wagons constructed. These are not made from patterns 
or models, but are worked out by the children and the results tested 
by actual use in playing in the grocery store. ($a: 401-402) 
Furnishing a home and building a community.—This account 
of the study of a grocery store and its activities might be paral- 
leled by accounts of later study of the home and the community 
by the same methods. In connection with the home “the chil- 
dren construct miniature individual rooms, using boxes for the 
floor and walls, and paper for decorating and furnishing these 
rooms.” Each child even designs a little rug of jute and weaves it
-P-A-G-E-202
  
186 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
upon a cardboard loom. In the study of the whole community 
miniature streets are laid out on the floor by using blocks and 
other materials to represent sidewalks, streets lights, and mail 
boxes. In a miniature business street the character of each 
store is designated by the goods displayed in its windows.

COMMUNITY OF HOUSES CONSTRUCTED AS A KINDERGARTEN PROJECT 
Such a project calls for careful observation of various phases of the immediate 
social environment 
Activities used in kindergarten study of community life. 
Imitative play, excursions, constructions, problem-solving, lan- 
guage expression—From this account we see how even five- 
year-old kindergarten children may have their attention directed 
to a study of some of the fundamental features and problems of 
modern life as represented in their immediate environment. The 
methods used in doing this include the following activities by 
the pupils: 
1. Playful imitation, or dramatic reproduction, of activities 
observed. In playing store or playing house the pupils are re-
-P-A-G-E-203
UNDERSTANDING SOCIAL LIFE 187 
quired to recall and canvass their experiences at home and on 
excursions, to clarify these, to select certain ones to be repro- 
duced, and to organize these in a series of activities. 
2. Excursions, to give first-hand, real experiences with the 
thing or activity to be reproduced. Such an excursion may be 
merely a little walk to mail a letter in the mail box on the corner 
or, at Christmas time, to view the large fireplace in the school 
foyer. Since many of the children live in apartments and have 
never seen a fireplace, this experience may help to clarify their 
ideas concerning an important feature of a house. On the other 
hand, the excursions may be made for the purpose of studying 
and restudying such a complicated place as a grocery store. 
3. Construction in miniature of the object or situation ob- 
served. Such construction checks up the pupils’ vague ideas 
and requires that these be clarified before a satisfactory product 
can result. 
4. Problem-solving thinking, to plan, design, and correct the 
construction. In the chapter on problem-solving (pp. 286-293) 
we shall present a lesson which shows how the children’s ideas 
of windows, doors, hinges, etc. were clarified by their problem 
discussions during the construction of the front of a cardboard 
grocery store. 
5. Expression of the experiences in language. Such expres- 
sion by the children is taking place during all the discussions of 
the excursions, plans, plays, and constructions, but these are 
specifically summarized at times into a story consisting of 
several sentences, such as “We made a trip to the bird store,” 
“We saw—,” etc. For a complete example of such a summary 
statement see page 412, where it is given as an illustration of 
training in the communication of ideas. 
Pupil activities to be especially discussed in Section IV. — 
In the above paragraphs we have described five types of activ- 
ities carried on by pupils in the kindergarten who are acquiring 
ideas of contemporary social life; namely, (1) playful imitation 
of observed activities, (2) excursions to give real experiences
-P-A-G-E-204
188 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
with important features of the immediate environment, (3) con- 
struction in miniature of observed objects or situations, (4) prob- 
lem analysis in designing or correcting such constructions, (5) 
expression in language of the fundamental elements of the whole 
experience. In following the descriptions of the course of study 
in the later grades, the reader should note other examples of 
such activities preparatory to a general discussion and evalua- 
tion of them in Section IV of this chapter. We shall now follow 
the pupils into the first grade, to see how their ideas of com- 
munity life are extended beyond their immediate environment 
by a study of farm life and Indian life. 
First grade; farm study. Extends city children’s ideas be- 
yond immediate environment.—In studying farm life some 
classes of city children may be able to make an excursion to a 
neighboring farm, but many classes may not. However, except 
in the most congested city environments, children have had expe- 
riences with open fields or with parks in which grass and flowers 
and trees are growing. Moreover, many of them are familiar 
with various kinds of domestic animals. Furthermore, many 
of the children have cultivated plants in the kindergarten or 
first-grade classroom or in the school garden. With such real 
experiences to start with, further experience may be imparted as 
described in the excerpts from our course of study given below. 
Farm pictures discussed. Descriptions made for reading ma- 
terial.—Discussions of what a farmer does leads to a study of 
farm pictures. From these, reading lessons may be constructed 
by the pupils according to the methods described in Chapter V, 
pp. 90-91. Examples of the sentences composed in such a 
lesson are the following: 
We see a barnyard on the farm. 
We see fields on the farm. 
We see orchards on the farm. 
We see woods on the farm. 
We see a brook on the farm. 
We see a garden on the farm. (8a: 406)
-P-A-G-E-205
  UNDERSTANDING SOCIAL LIFE 189 
Making miniature farm on sand-table and “ Farm Book.” —On 
the sand-table a miniature farm is set up. This activity requires 
more careful attention to certain details than in merely observ- 
ing a picture. The pupils also make a ‘Farm Book” containing 
pictures cut from magazines, drawings, reading lessons, etc. 
Imitative play showing relation of farm, store, and home.—The 
farm as the source of food supply becomes very familiar. To make 
this phase of it more vivid a grocery store is visited and farm prod- 
uce is noted, thus making the connecting link between farm and home. 
The transporting of food from farm to home is discussed, and a little 
play is arranged to illustrate it. (8a: 407) 
Butter made to illustrate food production in miniature—Finally 
. . . the preparation of some of the simple farm products for the 
table is begun. . . . Following is a typical oral composition in which 
the pupils gave the recipe for butter-making. This was later used 
for a reading lesson. 
We put a half-cup of cream in a bottle. 
We shook the bottle about ten minutes. 
We said this rime: 
“Come, butter, come. 
Come, butter, come. 
Johnnie’s at the garden gate 
Waiting for his butter cake. 
Come, butter, come. 
Come, butter, come.” 
When the butter came we washed it. 
We put in a half-teaspoonful of salt. 
We made it into a pat. 
We invited some other children in. 
We ate our butter on crackers. (8a; 407) 
Seasonal changes on farm represented in sand-pan—([After a 
time] the sand-table farm is changed from a summer farm to a fall 
farm. The corn is stacked in the fields, and apples of clay, painted 
red, are put in piles in the orchard. Clay pumpkins are made. The 
green trees are replaced by twigs representing the bare trees. A 
miniature Thanksgiving table is set and provided with every avail- 
able farm product which is suitable for this season and which can be 
represented by the children through paper-cutting, modeling, or con- 
struction. (3a: 408)
-P-A-G-E-206
  
190 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
Indian life further removed. Yet simple activities easily 
understood.—These descriptions give us a notion of the activ- 
ities of the pupils as their ideas of community life are extended 
to include a source of food supply remote from their homes but 
intimately linked with their lives through the grocery store and 
its food products from the farm. Ideas of even more remote 
conditions are acquired when the children continue their course 
by studying Indian life. The latter is so interwoven with early 
American life and so vivid a feature in many American stories 
that for these reasons alone it is worth introducing into pupils’ 
experiences. However, in the first grade it is used-not only for 
its story features but particularly to give pupils vivid ideas of 
the fundamental human wants and of simple, primitive methods 
of meeting these. Through dramatic and constructive activities 
they study the following features of Indian life: hunting and 
fishing, including the making of bows, arrows, and canoes; 
housing and moving, including the making of a wigwam; cloth- 
ing, including the making of simple Indian suits; cooking; 
feasting; dancing; etc. 
Strategic types of primitive life give ideas of social needs 
and methods.—From this point on, various types of civilization 
might be studied in order to enrich the children’s ideas concern- 
ing the world of today and its fundamental social needs and 
activities. Owing to the fact that these are represented in very 
simple form among primitive peoples, it has become customary 
in recent years to study in the primary grades two or three other 
examples of primitive life in addition to the study of the In- 
dians. The types chosen should be such that the ideas derived 
from them may be widely used by the children in later study 
and reading. During recent years in The University of Chicago 
Elementary School the primitive type of shepherd life and the 
life of the Vikings have been used as meeting these requirements. 
Shepherd life. Prominent in Asia and in the Bible-—The 
primitive type of shepherd life is very prominent in Asia at the 
present time. In history and literature it is very important owing
-P-A-G-E-207
UNDERSTANDING SOCIAL LIFE 191 
to the fact that it was so prominent among Biblical peoples and 
consequently is a prominent feature in the stories and figura- 
tive language of the Bible, the greatest book in our litera- 
ture. Through the fine oriental rugs imported from shepherd 
people of Asia the industrial products of these people have 
become a common feature of our artistically furnished homes.

CHILDREN WEAVING ON SMALL LOOMS 
’ A realistic basis for ideas of a great industry 
Shepherd life studied in second grade. Problem lesson.— 
The study of shepherd life is taken up in the second grade. 
The same kinds of activities prevail as in studying the farm 
and Indian life in the first grade; namely, imitative play, 
construction, problem-solving, language expression. In the fol- 
lowing chapter, on problem-solving (pp. 293 ff.), we shall present 
in detail a lesson which shows how children discuss and work 
from day to day on Arabian projects. In this particular lesson 
they were designing costumes for Arab dolls for their desert 
settlement in the sand-pan, and they referred to pictures of
-P-A-G-E-208
192. TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
Arabian life to check up their ideas. A special feature of their 
construction work in this study is the making of rugs. They 
experiment with various materials for dyeing the wool, such as 
coffee for brown, mustard for yellow, grape juice for purple, 
spinach for green, etc. Each child weaves a rug on a small loom. 
Weaving as a great industry. Story background.—As these 
constructive activities have been rather fully illustrated in the 
earlier grades, we shall point out here the literary experiences 
that are giverf the children to enrich their ideas of shepherd life. 
The course of study reads as follows: 
Great weaving among shepherd peoples—Stories of shepherd life 
and of great weavers form the background of this textile work. The 
life of the shepherd peoples is an ideal subject for little children, 
offering poetry, beauty of imagery, and a life of simple ideals. 
The work is introduced by showing the children bits of weaving 
from the looms of those peoples that stand out prominently as weav- 
ers: the Navajo Indians, the Persians, the East Indians, and the 
Arabs. The point is made that all great weavers have been shepherd 
people. . . . The children are told Bible stories of Abraham, Joseph, 
and David. The twenty-third Psalm is read and re-read. 
Bedouins studied as a desert type-—The work is sometimes based 
on the life of various shepherd peoples and sometimes confined to 
one people, when it is more completely worked out.... If the 
shepherd life of the Bedouins is to be studied, stories of Arabia are 
told, such as some of the Arabian legends, the story of “The Lance 
of Kanana” by Abd el Ardavan, Browning’s “ Muléykeh,” and parts 
of Jane Andrews’s “Seven Little Sisters.” 
Preparing puppet plays compels refining of information.—The chil- 
dren enjoy making a toy stage on which tq give a puppet play of Ara- 
bian life [as shown in the picture on page 295]. In preparing for the 
play, dressing the puppets, and making the scenes and the setting, 
the children are faced by their lack of information, and questions 
and efforts follow, to find out what they need to know. Bit by bit 
these details of the subject are worked out through reading lessons, 
pictures, stereopticon views, and trips to the Washington Park Con- 
servatory to see the [tropical] vegetation and to the Field Museum 
to see costumes and implements. (3a: 413-414)
-P-A-G-E-209
  
UNDERSTANDING SOCIAL LIFE 193 
Viking civilization. Offers strategic contrast and center oj 
inter pretation.—The study of the Vikings, which comes in the 
third grade, offers a very strong contrast to the desert type of 
shepherd life which was emphasized in the second grade. This 
contrast helps to make vivid in the minds of the pupils impres- 
sions of the varied natural conditions and modes of life that are 
to be found in the world. Moreover, the Vikings and their 
civilization are worth studying as a center of interpretation in 
history and literature. From the early explorations by the Scan- 
dinavians and their reputed discovery of America down to their 
notable social developments of today and the contribution of 
their emigrants to recent American life, the part played by 
these hardy peoples is a notable one. A few quotations from the 
course of study will suggest how the Viking study contributes 
to the progressive growth of the pupils’ ideas of social life which 
we have been following from the kindergarten up: 
Imaginary journeys to Norway; fiords in sand-pan—As a brief 
introduction to the study of the Vikings the children take an imagi- 
nary journey to Norway, getting through pictures an idea of the rug- 
gedness of the country, with its mountains and waterfalls, its rocky 
coast, and its many fiords. They represent the coast in the large 
sand-pan, with boats threading their way past the islands up the 
long, narrow inlets. 
Evolution of boats worked out by pupils—Attention is concen- 
trated for a time on a study of primitive boats and how they evolved. 
The children are led to imagine themselves in an age when boats did 
not exist but where travel by water was desirable. They construct 
in imagination some of the early boats, then suggest inventions that 
would improve them, and illustrate their ideas on the blackboard. 
Seafaring life and exploration made vivid ; original stories —A 
study of the Vikings as a seafaring people follows. Three fourths of 
the semester is spent upon this topic... . It includes a study of their 
ships, weapons, homes, occupations, and incidentally their educa- 
tion, dress, and pastimes. . . . The children readily see that through 
constant life on the sea, both in getting food and in other adventure, 
the Norse gained a love of the sea—its bigness, beauty, and force; 
that they became brave, hardy, and strong; that their natural fear-
-P-A-G-E-210
  194 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
lessness led them beyond their own waters. . . . A definite study is 
made of trade and adventure, special emphasis being laid upon the 
kinds of ships and weapons used. . . . Alternating with the construc- 
tion work, or running parallel with it during the literature period, the 
first four stories from the “Viking Tales,” by Jennie Hall, are read 
aloud. . . . The result of this work is sometimes embodied . . . in 
an original story of adventure composed by the children and similar 
in nature to the stories studied. 
Feast hall constructed and furnished.— Some of the sagas are [next] 
read. This leads to a study of the Vikings’ homes and the feast hall, 
which was the center of their social life and the place for the recital 
of adventures in song and story. ... The pupils design and make 
a feast hall and its furnishings of cardboard. They work in groups 
upon certain features of the hall, and the best product of the group 
is used for the final production. The feast hall may be set up in 
the sand-pan, together with other buildings comprising the home. 
. When the construction is completed the children arrange in 
the sand-pan some scene selected from the various stories they have 
heard or read, such as a home-coming or a feast. This makes a fit- 
ting conclusion to the history of the Vikings. (3a: 417-420) 
Local history. In third grade. Early Chicago.—In the sec- 
ond half of the third grade is found the subject of local history. 
It centers in the study of Chicago in pioneer times, followed 
by a study of some of the present-day local-community prob- 
lems. The manner in which this work grows naturally out of 
the pupils’ previous study of Indian life and of Viking explo- 
ration and travel and is facilitated by the ideas there acquired 
is suggested by the following quotation : 
Explorations of Great Lakes by hardy French introduce the study. 
—As an introduction to the study of old Chicago, the fur-trading post, 
the story of the discovery and exploration of the St. Lawrence River 
is briefly told. The St. Lawrence River and the Great Lakes are 
traced on the sand-table, and the children imagine that they are French 
explorers and make the journey to Chicago in toy ships and canoes. 
Prairie and swamp life of the pioneer times pictured—An idea 
of the appearance of the country is gained through a study of pic- 
tures of prairie and swamp, through stories of the life and activities
-P-A-G-E-211
  
UNDERSTANDING SOCIAL LIFE 195 
of the Indians and the French, and through personal experiences of 
children who have seen similar stretches of country. Pictures and 
mounted specimens of the otter, mink, beaver, duck, partridge, and 
other such birds and animals as are typical of this region are 
studied. (8a: 422) 
Pupils now return to home community with enriched ideas 
of social needs and activities.—The development of Chicago is 
then traced by the 
same methods of con- 
struction, illustration, 
discussion, _ descrip- 
tion, dramatization, 
and reading that we 
found characterizing 
the work in the ear- 
lier grades. The study 
of the Chicago of re- 
cent times occurs to- 
ward the end of the 
third grade. Including 
the kindergarten, by 
this time the pupils FRONTIER FORT CONSTRUCTED IN SAND-PAN 
have pursued the 
study of community life for almost four years. It began with 
the neighborhood around their homes, and extended, in the 
first grade, beyond their immediate environment to the farm, 
which, however, was closely connected with their homes through 
the purchase of farm products in the grocery store. A further 
step in giving the pupils ideas of life remote from home was 
taken in the study of the Indians, a people often somewhat 
familiar through stories, pictures, and the circus. Still more re- 
mote from their daily experiences were the ideas of shepherd life 
derived through stories, dramatizations, constructions, descrip- 
tions, etc. Finally, in the study of the Vikings, explorations by 
hardy adventurers who crossed the seas to the shores of foreign 
  From The University of Chicago Elementary School
-P-A-G-E-212
  196 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
lands formed some basis for understanding the work of the hardy 
Frenchmen who pushed up the St. Lawrence and Ottawa, por- 
taged into the water flowing into Lake Huron, and eventually 
reached the site of Chicago. Finally, in the study of the devel- 
opment of the city, we have the children brought back to their 
home community, but with the latter greatly expanded beyond 
the local neighborhood which they embraced in their experiences 
in the kindergarten. Moreover, they return with ideas of human 
wants and needs, and of methods and devices for meeting these, 
greatly enriched through contacts with civilizations as varied 
as those of the desert shepherd and the Viking, yet simple 
enough so that the pupils can readily see the connection be- 
tween need and means of supply—a connection that is fre- 
quently so complicated and hidden in our complex city society 
of today as to puzzle even well-informed readers. 
Study of water supply typifies pupils’ ideas and teacher's 
method at end of third grade.—Having brought our pupils back 
to their home town with their ideas of community life greatly 
enriched, let us illustrate this stage in the progressive growth of 
their ideas of community life by a description of their study of 
one feature of Chicago’s recent development; namely, its water 
supply. The following quotation shows the general method: 
THE WATER SUPPLY 
Discussions demonstrate pupils’ superficial knowledge.— Attention 
is called to the ease with which water can now be obtained in the 
city forany purpose. The present system, with its drinking-fountains, 
convenient faucets in kitchen, lavatory, and laundry, and pipes for 
lawn and garden, is briefly discussed, and the children see that their 
knowledge of how it is supplied is very superficial: They do know, 
however, the ways in which water was obtained by the early settlers, 
and that knowledge forms the basis for the development of the topic. 
Early town actions impersonated.—Pictures of early Chicago and 
of other settlements in which rivers and wells are prominent are col- 
lected. Children who have been in the country describe ways of
-P-A-G-E-213
UNDERSTANDING SOCIAL LIFE 197 
obtaining water other than that employed in the city. They relate 
personal experiences, study pictures, and discuss springs, rivers, lakes, 
and wells as sources of supply. A sketch of the well sweep is made 
in the art period, to accompany a short written description of primi- 
tive means of securing water. In their reading (Hall’s “Story of 
Chicago”) the children learn that because people were careless the 
water in wells and river became impure and much sickness resulted. 
They also see that the early means of supply were inadequate

to meet the needs of a large group of people living close together. 
The children impersonate the village people and hold a meeting 
at which they discuss means of protecting the health of the peo- 
ple. A law is made forbidding the throwing of garbage into the 
river, streets, or vacant lots. The fact that the failure of pioneer 
methods was due to the rapid growth of the town and to careless- 
ness is made prominent. 
Early pier system modeled and criticized—The lake as the source 
of supply is next considered. The children read of the attempts of 
individuals to supply the people with water by bringing it from the
-P-A-G-E-214
198 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
lake in water carts. They see that this was a poor plan because the 
water was dipped from the surface near the shore and because it 
cost too much. The pier system, planned and directed by a number 
of profit-sharing individuals, is next studied. A map, locating the 
pumping station and the pier of the first water system, based on 
the Water Supply map of 1836, is drawn on the schoolroom floor. The 
children represent the pier with a few boards, blocks, and a section 
of water pipe. Some of the questions considered here are: “Did 
this system supply clean water?” “Could it be depended upon?” 
“Was the supply sufficient to meet the needs of a growing city?” 
In the free discussion accompanying the study of the map and the 
building of the pier the following points are brought out: the water 
was not pure because it came from too near the surface and because 
the southward current of the river swept the refuse down to the 
intake pipe; the system could not be depended upon in winter, as 
the water in the pipes froze; the system could not be enlarged to 
meet the needs of the rapidly growing city, and it was too expensive 
for everyone to use water freely. Mention is made of the fact that 
the attempts of individuals and of corporations to supply the people 
with water had failed. 
Children eager to know of modern crib solution—At this point 
the children are eager to know how the problem was finally solved. 
Questions similar to the following are asked to direct the thinking 
and to prepare them for a study of the present system: “What 
things must be true of a successful water system?” “Where in the 
lake do you think the water is cleanest?” “Why?” ‘Could pipes 
be laid away out there?” “Why not?” “What ways can you sug- 
gest for bringing the cleaner water from so far out in the lake?” 
“How could the freezing of the water pipes be prevented?” “How 
could the cost be reduced?” A description of Mr. Chesbrough’s 
plan is then read by the children. A model of the crib is made, and 
the system is worked out on the sand-table and represented on the 
blackboard. 
Pupils work out sewage problem and reversing of Chicago River. 
—The children know that the proper disposal of sewage was still a 
troublesome question. They know that sewers emptying into the 
Chicago River had been laid. They see that the lake water could 
not be clean so long as the river, carrying this sewage, flowed into 
it. In order to show the children how the lake has been made to
-P-A-G-E-215
  UNDERSTANDING SOCIAL LIFE 199 
sweep out the Chicago River, use is again made of the sand-table. 
The children build the Chicago plain and the westward slope. They 
trace the Chicago River and the Des Plaines and Illinois Rivers. 
They are helped to see that the land over which the Chicago River 
flowed must have had a gentle slope, although it appeared quite level. 
Such questions are asked as: “Into what did the Chicago River flow 
when Chicago was a fur-trading post?” ‘What was the condition 
of the water in the river at that time?” “How did the river later 
help to cleanse the city?” ‘What effect did this have upon the 
condition of the river water?” “Should we expect, then, to get 
pure water from the lake?” “In which direction do the Des Plaines 
and Illinois Rivers flow?” ‘How do you know?” ‘What prevents 
the Chicago River from flowing west too?” ‘How could this diffi- 
culty be removed?” Then the children read of the building of the 
drainage canal and its successful completion, and make the canal on 
the sand-table model. 
Municipal control valued—Thus, from the study of models and 
drawings, from reading and discussion, the children are led to a more 
definite understanding of the present complicated and efficient sys- 
tem. Attention has also been called to the advisability of municipal 
control of such a necessity as water, instead of allowing money- 
making concerns to assume control. Throughout the study of prob- 
lems arising from the needs of many people living so close together, 
the ideas of personal helpfulness and responsibility are emphasized. 
Each pupil makes a Chicago book—When the study of Chicago 
is completed each child has his own Chicago book containing writ- 
ten descriptions, original stories, bits of dramatization, verses, 
sketches which were made in the art period, and pictures which he 
has collected as illustrations. 
The following table of contents is copied from such a book, to- 
gether with explanatory notes.

Growth of ideas of European and American history. De- 
vices for vividness and connectedness.—After completing the 
study of the history of Chicago the pupils in the fourth grade 
begin a study of the European background of American history. 
Efforts are made by the teachers to present both European and 
American history vividly and connectedly by a number of de- 
vices somewhat similar to those used in the earlier grades, but 
involving more independent reading and study by the pupils, 
who are now prepared to read quite profitably. One of the most 
effective devices that are used is the composing and presenting of 
a historical play, like that pictured in the frontispiece. We 
may illustrate this practice by an example from the study of 
the European background of American history. 
Composing and presenting a historical play. Necessary 
research vivifies fusion of Roman and Teutonic civilizations in 
Britain.—Our example from the European background of Amer- 
ican history is taken from the fifth-grade study of English his- 
tory, the topic being the fusion of Roman and Germanic ideals in

the development of those factors that have become a part of our 
present mode of living. The pupils have previously acquired 
vivid notions of imperial Roman life and of the life of the 
German tribes. The heroes of the latter have been especially 
studied, such as Alaric, Clovis, 
King Arthur, Alfred, Harold, 
and William the Conqueror, 
and the Teutons have been 
shown as a physically strong, 
self-reliant, and virile people 
who made their own laws and 
chose their own leaders to gov- 
ern them. Much of the needed 
information is-secured through 
reference reading bythe pupils , 
in a variety of books that in- 
clude stories of these heroes. 
Among these books are Eva 
Tappan’s “Old-World Hero 
Stories,” Howard Pyle’s‘ King 
Arthur and his Knights,” A. J. 
Church’s “Stories from Eng- 
From The University of Chicago Elemenitary School lish History,” Guerber’s sg Story 
BOY WARRIOR IN A PLAY OF of the English,” Harding’s 
MEDIEVAL LIFE “Story of the Middle Ages,” 
Much intensive study by pupils of and Haaren and Poland’s 
ne cia or hie ys pn”? “Famous Men of the Middle Ages.” 
The fusion of the Roman and Teutonic civilizations is taken up 
in the course of study and described in the following quotation:      
Purpose to teach one of the most fundamental facts in the his- 
tory of civilization.—The combining of German and Roman ideals 
. is brought out in the writing of a play which aims to show 
that as time went on, the invading Teutons learned from those about 
them many of the ideas, customs, and institutions of the Romans,
-P-A-G-E-219
  
UNDERSTANDING SOCIAL LIFE 203 
and that finally their conversion to Christianity served to link more 
closely the ideals of the old civilization and the physical vigor of the 
new. The purpose is to impress upon the children’s minds, as Adams 
says, that “it is one of the most fundamental facts in the history of 
civilization that this was a union upon equal terms of German and 
Roman to form a new whole and to begin a new progress.” 
Writing the play. Pupils’ interest centers in the heroic, but must 
study out details of conquest, settlement, and conversion.—In writ- 
ing the play, the class chooses one of the favorite leaders of the 
barbarians as hero. Through class discussions there is formulated 
a general plan of what the play should disclose and what incidents 
best show the points to be emphasized. A tentative outline is drafted 
for a play, showing, for example, (1) the manner of life among 
the Saxons before their coming to Britain, (2) their entrance into 
Britain as allies and their settlement there as conquerors, and (3) 
their conversion to Christianity. The subject matter of each act 
is discussed by the class in detail, and passages giving information 
about all doubtful points are looked up in the various texts and 
read orally in the class. Later each member of the class writes out 
the speeches, action, and setting according to his own ideas. These 
are read, criticized, and used in the collaboration of the final draft 
made by the class. 
Costuming and properties require picture study and designing. 
Competition and expression in performing.—After the play is written 
the problem of staging and costuming it for presentation at the school 
assembly becomes the center of interest. Pictures and charts deal- 
ing with German life during the period of the invasions are studied 
for details of costume and setting. .. . The rehearsing of the play 
is made a part of the expression work in English, where each child 
is given opportunity to try out the part he likes best. The cast for 
the final presentation, however, is selected by the vote of the entire 
class. Many of the properties are made by the children; others are 
obtained from the school costume box. Illustrations showing shields, 
weapons, helmets, ships, warriors, etc. and a cover design for the 
book of the play are worked out in the art period. (3a: 517-518) 
Historical play-writing requires research and objectifies his- 
torical progress in successive scenes.—While the above account 
resembles in general the descriptions of the teaching processes
-P-A-G-E-220

in the lower grades, it emphasizes for us especially the following 
points in giving vividness and connectedness to historical ideas: 
(2) the large amount of historical research, discussion, problem- 
solving, and clarifying of ideas that is necessitated in the accu- 
rate composition of a historical play; (2) the clarifying of ideas

of historical change, progress, and continuity or connectedness 
through the organization and presentation of scenes typifying 
fundamental stages in a certain historical movement. 
Five factors in teaching American history. Large move- 
ments, geographical influences, adventure, problems, biography. 
—Let us now take a long step in the progress of the pupils’ 
historical ideas and use an example from the study of westward 
expansion in seventh-grade American history to illustrate five
-P-A-G-E-221
UNDERSTANDING SOCIAL LIFE 205 
further factors in the methods of teaching ; namely, (1) emphasis 
on great movements instead of chronological detail, (2) con- 
nection between geographical influences and historical devel- 
opments, (3) vivid interest in historical adventures, (4) the 
interpretation of historical developments through problem- 
solving discussions, (5) the effectiveness of typifying historical 
epochs in great strategic personal leaders. 
Large movements. Replace chronology of presidential ad- 
ministrations.— Until recently it was common to study the 
history of the United States in terms of presidential adminis- 
trations. The course of study consequently became a detailed 
chronology of events in which the largest unit was a four-year 
or eight-year period. Such an organization usually failed to 
interest pupils and failed to give them any adequate compre- 
hension of the half-dozen great movements and developments in 
American history since the Revolutionary War. In contrast 
with the chronological hodgepodge of this older method we find 
the recent tendency to study our history in terms of a few great 
movements. One of these is commonly called “westward ex- 
pansion.” In the Chicago course of study which we have been 
describing, this movement is introduced in the following words: 
Westward expansion a large unit in seventh grade—The great 
theme of the history taught in the seventh grade is the migration of 
the people across the continent from the narrow Atlantic coastal 
plain to the Pacific coast. 
Conquest of Kentucky, Tennessee, and the old Northwest—The 
first part of the [course] deals with life on the frontier through a 
study of three men: Daniel Boone, the father of the Wilderness 
Road; James Robertson, the founder of Tennessee; and George 
Rogers Clark, who won the Northwest Territory for the United States. 
Preblems of development of the Northwest Territory —The sec- 
ond part is devoted to the development of the Northwest Territory, 
with the problems of its settlement, Indian relations, trade, and 
transportation. 
Beyond the Mississippi—The third part is a study of the expan- 
sion westward from the Mississippi River. Here the main purpose  
-P-A-G-E-222
  
206 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
is to show the struggle of the North and South for the possession of 
the West, and the events which led to the Civil War. The last major 
topic is the crossing of the Rocky Mountain barrier and the settle- 
ment of the Pacific coast. 
Transportation and immigration —Through these studies the child 
gains enough experience to be able to summarize important develop- 
ments in our history. He is led to the consideration of two of these 
especially : transportation and immigration. The course ends with a 
study of these two topics in their present relations. (8a: 563-564) 
Large topic of American migration thus illuminates pupils’ 
ideas of the whole nation.—These quotations bring us pretty 
close to the contemporary topics which we found in the weekly 
magazine at the beginning of this chapter on understanding 
contemporary social life. Contemporary transportation and im- 
migration, which are represented in the current magazines, can 
be understood by the pupils who have been through this course 
of study in terms of the great American migrations and settle- 
ments of the nineteenth century. The study of American west- 
ward expansion as a great movement in American history thus 
becomes a center not only for interpreting many of the conflicts 
and problems of the nineteenth century but also for under- 
standing the sectional differences of opinion that often prevail 
today and a host of other contemporary issues. Thus we see 
how the organization of the historical course of study in terms 
of large social movements is much superior to mere chronol- 
ogy for the purpose of giving pupils ideas that enable them to 
utilize their knowledge of past developments to interpret con- 
temporary events and issues. 
Geographical influences in history. Illustrated by crossing 
of the Appalachian barrier.—The second factor in modern his- 
torical study which we desired to illustrate—namely, the in- 
fluence of geographical conditions—may also be brought out in 
connection with westward expansion, as shown in the following 
paragraph from that part of the course of study that concerns 
crossing the Appalachian barrier.
-P-A-G-E-223
  UNDERSTANDING SOCIAL LIFE 207 
The first problem is why the Appalachian Mountains were a bar- 
rier to westward expansion. Pictures and maps are selected to show 
the characteristics of these mountains and are used in the projecting 
lantern so that the class as a whole can view them. Certain char- 
acteristics, such as the long parallel ridges and valleys, the water 
gaps, and the length and width, are especially noted. A study is 
made of the mountains from the pupils’ geography text and Long- 
man’s Atlas. From the information thus gained the class is ready 
to solve the problem of why this range was a barrier and how the 
settlers would move in crossing it. (3a: 570) 
Historical adventures. Boone’s adventures used to teach an 
important historical movement.—Our third factor in modern 
historical study (noted on page 205) is the intense interest 
aroused in many persons by historical adventures. In the study 
of westward expansion there is much adventure material that 
can be used. My son, when beginning the seventh grade, and 
some of his friends devoured over a dozen volumes featuring the 
adventures of Daniel Boone, George Rogers Clark, and other 
great pioneers in the westward movement. From the standpoint 
of the cold-blooded, matter-of-fact historian the essential fact 
about these adventures is that they are really true—they are 
real history, and they truly represent the conditions and human 
struggles of the time. From the standpoint of the pupil the 
main point is that the story is so thrilling that he is almost 
afraid to look up lest he see an Indian sneaking in at the door. 
From the standpoint of the teacher the problem is to utilize the 
pupils’ interest in Boone’s adventures so as to get them to com- 
prehend this pioneer not merely as an adventurer—for there 
were many adventurers of no importance—but as a great leader 
of a great migration over the Appalachian barrier into a land 
rich in the possibilities of cultivation and settlement. 
Solving social problems of the past. Devising transporta- 
tion over the Allegheny Mountains.—Our fourth factor men- 
tioned on page 205—namely, problem-solving interpretation of 
historical developments—may be illustrated in the case of
-P-A-G-E-224
  208 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
westward expansion by a problem which I heard debated by a 
seventh-grade class in much the same manner as they debated 
the problem of increasing America’s present sugar production 
(which will be described in detail on pages.280 ff). The history 
problem arose after the pupils had completed a study of the 
earlier settlements in the Northwest Territory. The account 
from the course of study may be paraphrased as follows: 
The next step is to solve the problem of how the frontier people 
were to get their products to a market. The New Orleans gateway, 
reached by flatboating down the Ohio and Mississippi, is suggested 
by the pupils as the natural outlet. But Spain owned New Orleans ; 
hence what would the United States do? After discussing this the 
class turns to reference books to find the desired information. The 
discussion to this point consumes about one period. 
The question still remains, however, of connecting the East and 
the West, since the merchants of the Atlantic coast were particularly 
desirous of securing the trade with the West. The pupils make a 
variety of suggestions. For example, they suggest building roads 
across the mountains. Each road suggested receives criticisms from 
the class. After examining the maps for possibilities the historical 
facts concerning the building of the Cumberland National Road 
may be given by the teacher, or looked up later in the text by the 
pupils after they have discussed other possibilities. Suggestions by 
the pupils that canals be built lead to an examination of the maps 
to see where this might be possible. The pupils quickly center their 
attention on the eastern end of the Great Lakes and search for easy 
connecting places with waters that flow into the Atlantic. After they 
have exhausted their own resources the actual historical solution of 
the problem is found in accounts of the building of the Erie and 
Pennsylvania canals. Suggestions for the building of railroads are 
canvassed in a similar manner. (3a: 571) 
Biography as historical material. Lincoln typifies west- 
ward expansion and the Civil War.—The fifth and final factor 
that is mentioned on page 205 is the enormous effectiveness 
of typifying epochs of history in the lives of great strategic 
personal leaders. As a connecting link between westward ex- 
pansion and the Civil War the study of Lincoln exemplifies 
 
-P-A-G-E-225
  UNDERSTANDING SOCIAL LIFE 209 
such biographical study, as described in the following quotation 
from the Chicago course of study: 
Biography illuminates movements and periods as no other liter- 
ature or form of history can. This is particularly true of the life 
of Lincoln, which is of great interest to children. Beginning with 
the Kansas-Nebraska Bill the Civil War is studied largely through 
Lincoln’s life. The qualities of Lincoln endear him to the children 
from the start. His humor especially makes him a very lifelike 
character to them. The first part of the biography shows how the 
Lincoln family joined in the great westward movement. The harsh, 
forbidding side of frontier life becomes evident when the children 
see the struggle of this family against great odds. The other phase 
of the westward movement, slavery, is also shown by its influence 
on the Lincoln family. There was no place for the poor uneducated 
white in the slave state; therefore another migration took place, to 
the free territory of Indiana. From here on, the study is directed 
to find out the influences that molded Lincoln’s opinions, especially 
his ideas about slavery, his views on the great political questions 
of that day, and, finally, his handling of the difficult problems during 
the Civil War. Most of the reading is done with these problems in 
mind. The child thus gets two aspects of the biographical study— 
the political and the personal. (8a: 572) 
Adult tendency to symbolize history in great leaders: Lincoln. 
—Such a study of Lincoln by children closely parallels the gen- 
eral social interest in him that is manifested at the present time. 
It is likely that, as time goes on, Lincoln will become more and 
more prominent in the minds of people as typifying the great 
conflict period in American history, many of the details of which 
will be forgotten. The use of such biographies in making his- 
tory vivid to children thus parallels one of the fundamental 
tendencies of the human mind in its effort to grasp, symbolize, 
and remember the great achievements of the past and to use 
them in thinking about problems of the present. 
Review of progressive growth of pupils’ social ideas. 
From playing store to great national problems such as transpor- 
tation and migration.—This brings us to the conclusion of our 
 
-P-A-G-E-226
  210 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
long Section III, in which we have pictured the progressive 
growth of pupils’ ideas of human nature and social life through 
their studies of community life and history. In the first stage 
of the study we found the children of the kindergarten making 
excursions to stores and other typical features of the immedi- 
ate environment and reproducing these through imitative play 
in the schoolroom. Next we saw them studying the farm as a 
source of food supply that is rather directly connected with their 
home life through the sale of farm products in the neighboring 
grocery store. In the next stage we found the pupils consider- 
ably removed in imagination from their immediate environment 
through a study of primitive methods of meeting human wants 
as exemplified in the hunting life of the Indians and the shep- 
herd life of certain desert peoples. In their study of the Vikings 
the pupils then noted how a hardy people in a comparatively 
barren and difficult country met some of their needs by con- 
quering the sea and ranging over it to distant lands. Finally, 
in their study of the development of their own city, Chicago, 
they saw the growth of complex city life of today from the 
simple frontier post established by hardy explorers and pioneers. 
After the fourth grade we followed the growth of the pupils’ 
historical ideas from the European background of American 
history down to the study of recent problems of migration and 
transportation in the United States. 
Only a few typical features cited from course of study ; con- 
sult the whole.—It is important to keep in mind that we have 
touched upon the pupils’ experiences at only a few spots in the 
progressive growth of their social ideas from the kindergarten 
through the seventh grade. The reader who is interested to ex- 
amine the complete course of study (which covers some one 
hundred and fifteen pages) should consult reference 3a at the 
end of this chapter. Moreover, it is important to realize that 
this course of study is not permanent, but is undergoing changes 
from year to year as American teachers learn more about the 
teaching of community life and history.
-P-A-G-E-227
  UNDERSTANDING SOCIAL LIFE 211 
Course typifies progressive learning and teacher’s devices. 
Psychological evaluation in next section.—In any case, how- 
ever, no matter how the course changes in content, it will al- 
ways, we hope, provide for the continuous, progressive growth 
of the pupils’ ideas of social life and history, so that the ideas 
they acquire in each grade build a part of the foundation for 
the social thinking required later in the course. One of the 
chief reasons for choosing this particular course of study as the 
basis of this section was to give the reader a notion of such 
gradual and continuous growth of the pupils’ ideas. The other 
reason for choosing it was because it describes the actual activi- 
ties of the pupils in their processes of learning and the teacher’s 
devices for stimulating and guiding these activities. These 
learning processes and teaching devices may remain much the 
same, no matter how the content of the course changes. To 
understand them is one of the chief needs of the teacher who 
would prepare pupils for a broad insight into contemporary 
social life. Consequently in the next section we shall sum- 
marize these devices and consider the psychological justification 
for their use in stimulating and guiding the pupils’ learning. 
Section IV. EvatuaTIoN or MeETHops AND DEVICES 
USED IN STUDYING ComMuNITy LiFE AND History 
Scope of section.—In this section we shall try to bring to- 
gether the methods and devices described in Section III and 
evaluate them in terms of how pupils learn; that is, in terms 
of the psychology of learning. 
Summary of methods.—The reader will probably remember 
that at the end of our description of the kindergarten course we 
summarized (on page 186) five of the processes used in that 
grade, Again, toward the end of the course of study, we de- 
scribed five factors in the teaching of American history. Just 
before this we described the work of pupils in writing his- 
torical plays. If.we bring all these points together we get the
-P-A-G-E-228
  212. TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
following list of the pupil activities that are used in studying 
community life and history : 
1. Observing real social situations and materials, or pictures 
and models of these. 
2. Solving problems arising from human needs, either as ac- 
tually present in the pupil’s experience or as imagined in the 
lives of historic peoples. 
3. Expressing ideas of social needs or materials or processes 
through the following media: 
. Playful imitating of social activities. 
. Constructing miniature objects and situations. 
. Drawing maps, pictures, diagrams, and graphs. 
. Describing experiences, objects, and situations. 
. Composing and presenting historical plays. 
. Discussing problems that arise. 
Organizing, outlining, and reviewing the outcomes of their 
experiences. 
4. Reading in textbooks and supplementary books, including 
adventure-reading and historical research. 
5. Studying large movements in history instead of chrono- 
logical detail. 
6. Determining geographical influences upon historical de- 
velopments. 
7. Using the lives of great leaders in social movements, to 
epitomize and symbolize great conflicts and developments. 
Possibly a few other important practices might be added to 
this summary if we desired to make it complete. Furthermore, 
the organization might be improved. However, as it stands, the 
statement typifies fairly well the pupils’ activities in progressive 
methods of studying history and community life. 
Evaluation depends on desired characteristics of ideas of 
social life.—In making our evaluation of these activities and 
teaching processes we must keep in mind the aim of the type of 
learning which we are discussing in this chapter. As indicated 
in Section I, after we reproduced the topics discussed in a 
Rre 
Waoar

UNDERSTANDING SOCIAL LIFE 213 
weekly review to represent a cross section of contemporary life, 
we stated that our purpose is to give pupils ideas that will 
provide a broad, sympathetic insight into contemporary life 
and civilization. Section I gave us some notion of what these 
ideas are; Section II, the subjects in which they occur in 
school; and Section III, a picture of the progressive growth of 
many of the ideas as derived from elementary studies of com- 
munity life and history. Before the chapter closes we shall 
need to get some understanding of how such ideas exist and 
operate in the pupils’ minds and behavior. At present, how- 
ever, we desire to avoid such an abstract psychological discus- 
sion; so we may merely suggest that in the case of the more 
‘important ideas which a pupil acquires we desire to secure the 
following qualities. These ideas should be 
1. Clear; that is, well distinguished from each other by the 
pupil, and the meaning of each well grasped. 
2. Vivid; that is, impressive, colorful, warm with the feeling 
of personal experience. 
3. Organized ; that is, associated with logically related ideas, 
with subordinate ideas held under larger ones, etc. 
4. Usable; that is, ready to be applied in understanding and 
interpreting new experiences, solving new problems, etc. 
5. Recallable+; that is, so deeply impressed and well con- 
nected with other ideas that they can be recalled when needed. 
6. Mobile; that is, not merely clamped in one place or 
system, but freely associated and easily recalled in many 
connections. 
7. Modifiable; that is, not hard and fast, but subject to modi- 
fication from new experiences or data. 
We might go on and add a number of other adjectives to the 
above list of characteristics and also explain more fully each of 
those given. Enough has been said, however, to suggest the fact 
that we are to evaluate our teaching processes and devices in 
1See, however, page 257, for James’s evaluation of experiences that we 
cannot definitely recall but which modify our attitudes and interpretations.
-P-A-G-E-230
  214. TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
terms of the way in which they help to contribute some of the 
above characteristics to the pupils’ ideas of social life. To un- 
derstand how these characteristics are attained we must turn to 
a consideration of certain fundamental psychological processes. 
Psychological processes in acquiring ideas. Illustrated by 
a romantic maiden’s ideas of “movie” hero—The fundamental 
psychological factors and processes involved in acquiring ideas 
may be illustrated by the following incident : 
One day, in Florida, I was standing in an ancient grove of 
moss-hung oak trees watching a company of movie actors mak- 
ing a picture. The hero was one of the handsomest of the 
younger screen stars. He was nonchalantly riding a spirited 
horse in the scene that was being photographed. 
A group of young girls from the neighborhood came running 
up. One, who appeared about thirteen years of age, was an 
attractive brunette of the Spanish type so common in St. Augus- 
tine. Upon spying the hero on his horse she cried: “There he 
is. Isn’t he grand! I knew him the minute I saw him. I’m 
just crazy over him. I’ve seen him in every picture he’s played 
in. I’ve read all about him in the movie magazine. I cut his 
picture out and put it on my dresser.” 
This outburst interested me particularly because, although I 
am something of a movie enthusiast myself, I had never paid any 
special attention to this handsome fellow or learned much about 
him. Yet here was a romantic young girl who knew all about 
him and seemed to rank him above all the other stars because 
of his appeal to her romantic interests. Certainly her ideas of 
him had many of the psychological characteristics which we 
_noted above and which we should like to secure in giving chil- 
dren social ideas in school. If we examine her case for a few 
minutes, we shall discover the fundamental psychological proc- 
esses inherent in acquiring ideas that are clear, vivid, recall- 
able, etc. 
Factors causing the girl’s vivid ideas of her hero. 1. A strong 
instinctive tendency.—The first factor to be noted in this girl’s
-P-A-G-E-231
  
UNDERSTANDING SOCIAL LIFE 215 
experience is her strong, instinctive romantic interest in a hand- 
some, heroic member of the opposite sex. The fundamental 
cause of her noticing him and learning all about him was this 
particular instinctive tendency. 
2. Vivid personal experiences.—The second factor in giving 
her clear, vivid ideas of the gentleman is the actual observation 
of him in person, either as shown on the screen or as actually 
present. It is interesting to note that the screen observations 
had given her almost as vivid an impression of him as could be 
gained from direct observation of his physical presence. 
3. Mental elaboration, attentive reflection.—The third factor 
to be noted is the large amount of thought the girl gave to her 
hero. She read about him, she gazed at his photograph day after 
day, doubtless she dreamed of him and studied the movie an- 
nouncements to see when she might again have a chance to view 
his handsome figure and graceful actions. 
Three rules. Instinctive appeal, vivid experience, attentive 
reflection.—From this single example, then, we derive three 
principal headings under which we may group much of our 
discussion of the factors to be considered in giving pupils ideas 
of human nature and social life, as well as many other types of 
ideas. We may formulate these factors into rules for teaching, 
in the following words: In effectively teaching pupils ideas of 
social life we should 
1. Appeal to or arouse some fundamental instinctive tend- 
ency, interest, or activity. 
2. Provide first-hand personal experiences, with real objects, 
persons, and situations, or vivid representations of these. 
3. Stimulate the pupils to elaborate and reflect upon their 
experiences from many angles and in many connections. 
These rules have so many varied applications in teaching 
ideas of social life (as well as other ideas) that we shall devote 
a number of pages to explaining each rule and its applications. 
In doing this we shall be able to justify systematically most of 
the devices described in the preceding section. 
 
-P-A-G-E-232
  216 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
Rule A. Arousing Instinctive Tendencies, Interests, or Activities 
Meaning of instinct. An inborn tendency to behave in cer- 
tain definite ways.—The young girl’s instinctive interest in her 
handsome hero, which we described in the incident above, may 
be used to illustrate what we mean by an instinct. We called 
her interest and actions instinctive because she did not have to 
be taught to feel and behave as she did—she simply grew into 
it. Romantic interest in the opposite sex develops naturally in 
adolescence in a manner that leaves no doubt of its inborn, na- 
tive, or instinctive character. The term “instinct” is used by 
psychologists to designate such inborn, or native, tendencies to 
behave in certain specific ways toward objects or persons; for 
example, the tendency of a young animal to run after an object 
that moves away from it and to run from an object. moving 
rapidly toward it. 
List of important instincts in teaching community life and 
history.—Among the human instinctive tendencies or instinc- 
tive complexes which are especially usable in teaching commu- 
nity life and history are the following: 
1. Instinctive interest in adventure and romance. 
. Interest in actions and conversations of people. 
. Imitative play. 
. Physical activity and manipulation. 
. Collecting-instinct. 
. Curiosity and problem-solving. 
. Expression, or communication. 
. Competition, or emulation. 
We shall take up the first two of these for special discussion. 
. Adventure and romance abound in history.—History 
is full of material that appeals to the instinctive interest in 
adventure and romance. We have already given one example 
of this fact on page 207, where we described the use of Daniel 
Boone’s adventures to typify a certain phase of westward 
expansion. I have added the term “romance’’ because it is OCI ANRWH
-P-A-G-E-233
UNDERSTANDING SOCIAL LIFE 217 
possibly somewhat broader in its suggestion than adventure; 
for example, it may include such “romantic” interests as were 
exhibited by the young girl described above. Furthermore, even 
the derivation of the term “romance” is suggestive of great 
historical adventures, since, according to the dictionary, it was 
early used to designate legendary stories in the Romance lan- 
guages; that is, the vulgar, or common, tongues, or vernacular, 
of the descendants of the Romans, especially in France. The 
stories of heroic knights, such as King Arthur, were especially 
typical. These great romances commonly included not only the 
heroic adventures of gallant knights but also the love-affair 
interest represented in combats for fair ladies. Such romantic- 
adventure stories have been of universal interest to both sexes 
—from the time of Homer, through the days “when knights 
were bold,” down to the present. Some girls are as much in- 
terested in the fighting and adventure aspects as are the major- 
ity of boys. An example of such interest came to my attention 
recently when a mother said her daughter had just discovered 
the world of adventure books intended for boys and was now 
fascinated in devouring the stories. Many young girls, how- 
ever, much prefer the love-affair element to the adventure fea- 
ture. This is apparent in the story-books that are especially 
popular with girls. It is interesting to note that this element is 
strong in the great historic adventure stories such as those of 
the Homeric and Arthurian periods, as well as in the modern 
writings of Scott and Dumas. Hence, through using the broader 
term, “romance,” while we may not be entirely accurate, we 
have tried to suggest the possibility of historical story material’s 
being interesting to the romantic-minded girl as well as to the 
adventure-loving boy. 
Tutoring a boy through historical fiction.—During recent 
years I had frequent occasion to select historical adventure 
books for my son, who was attending The University of 
Chicago Elementary School but was always absent during the 
winter, when I took my annual vacation of three months. He
-P-A-G-E-234
218 Fa OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
is naturally a voracious reader of adventure material and had 
had the excellent training in history and general reading given 
in the ee Our device for furnishing a substitute dur- 
ing the winter for the rich historical experiences which his class- 
mates were having was to pile up historical reading for him. 
Some of this was systematic; for example, one winter we had 
him read rapidly three textbook accounts of the two topics that 
his classmates were studying at school—namely, westward ex- 
pansion and the Industrial Revolution. From these we had 
him recite upon important subtopics. Such study, however, was 
no adequate substitute for thé varied activities of the pupils as 
depicted in the course of study in Section III. To furnish some- 
thing of this fuller historical experience we provided a number of 
books of historical stories. For example, upon the topic of west- 
ward expansion we bought from the textbook companies seven 
inexpensive volumes telling stories of the settlement of Ken- 
tucky, Ohio, the old Northwest generally, Texas, Oregon, and 
California, plus an excellent biography of Lincoln. In the field 
of standard historical fiction the boy read Churchill’s “The 
Crossing,” for pioneer Kentucky; Fox’s “Little Shepherd of 
Kingdom Come,” for contrasts of mountaineer life and blue- 
grass-plantation life in Kentucky; and Eggleston’s ‘Hoosier 
Schoolmaster,” for pioneer days in Indiana. Thus for a few 
dollars we were able to cover his school course rather fully with 
supplementary material that appealed to his instinctive interests 
in adventure and romance. 
Novels. Cheap editions. Cooper for the colonial period.— How- 
ever, for a voracious reader of twelve years of age these books 
are only a drop in the bucket. Hence, in order to keep him 
from spending too much time on a standard weekly magazine 
and other similar excellent fiction, we bought from the textbook 
companies or from such collections as Everyman’s Library cheap 
editions of famous historical novels, no matter what period they 
covered. One year he devoured many of Cooper’s novels. These 
happened to touch the period in American history that the
-P-A-G-E-235
  UNDERSTANDING SOCIAL LIFE 219 
class in Chicago was studying —for example, “The Last of the 
Mohicans” touched the French and Indian War; “The Spy” 
and “The Pilot,” the Revolutionary period.’ We also brought 
in Scott’s “Kenilworth,” to give something of the atmosphere 
of English life during the period of Queen Elizabeth and Sir 
Walter Raleigh. 
Dumas and Scott* for the seventeenth century in France and 
England.—The next winter we loaded up with Dumas’s and 
Scott’s stories of the seventeenth century. This period had al- 
ready been covered in the boy’s study of the European back- 
ground of American history, but was reviewed and revivified by 
these stories. Dumas’s ‘The Three Musketeers” and its sequel, 
“Twenty Years After,” touch the periods of Richelieu, Mazarin, 
and Louis XIV in France and depict important relations with 
England. Scott’s “Woodstock” is a story of the England of 
Cromwell’s time, contemporary with the period of Dumas’s 
“Twenty Years After.” Cromwell and other important English 
characters appear in both stories. 
Ghosts and secret passages thrill the boy.—The features of 
these stories which especially interest a boy may be inferred 
from the following remarks of my son. One day he said, ‘Gee, 
‘Woodstock’ is getting exciting now—ghosts ’n’ everything!” 
1We realized that Cooper represents the ordinary, biased American view 
of the England of the eighteenth century, and suggested this to the boy. 
However, Cooper’s view is no more extreme than that which prevailed 
in our ordinary texts until the World War. Moreover, his view is itself a 
historical phenomenon and illustrates vividly the general American temper 
of his day. 
2Teachers who are familiar with the reading habits of adolescent boys 
will realize that this twelve-year-old boy enjoyed books ordinarily read by 
pupils at a later age. This was due to an unusual combination of favor- 
able circumstances. However, the adventure interest which we are illustrat- 
ing is common to upper-grade boys, and its expression in reading historical 
adventures is found in the enormous popularity, among such boys, of the 
historical stories by J. A. Altscheler (when these are provided in large 
public libraries), Such stories could be put to the same use as we put the 
works of Cooper, Dumas, and Scott in the teaching here described.
-P-A-G-E-236
  
220 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
Later he said: “Jiggers, it would be fine to have a castle like 
that, with all kinds of secret passages. You could fake some of 
them. I mean you could build a door behind a big picture, but 
there wouldn’t really be any secret passage there. Then your 
pursuers would waste time trying to open this door.” Between 
these remarks, however, he said, “King Charles the Second has 
just come in.” 
Casual conversation brings out historical features.—Such re- 
marks as that about King Charles are inspired by the only in- 
struction which we attempted with these stories ; namely, casual 
conversation, usually at mealtime. For this purpose I usually 
dipped into each book for a few points of contact, but did not 
read the whole. For example, in glancing through “The Three 
Musketeers” I noticed the names of many towns and rivers 
ef northern France which had been made famous during the 
World War. I asked, ‘Did you notice the name of that town 
where the musketeers stopped while pursuing Milady ?” refer- 
ring to the town of Arras, where great fighting occurred in the 
war. This question led to a discussion of the boundary between 
France and Belgium; of the river Lys; of the efforts of Milady 
to seek refuge in a foreign country, Belgium; of the frequency 
of this practice of escaping into foreign countries; etc. Another 
example occurred in contrasting Cardinal Richelieu, who is the 
big French political leader in “The Three Musketeers,” with 
Cardinal Mazarin, who was minister during the period which 
figures in “Twenty Years After.”. A discussion of this contrast 
was started by the question “What does Dumas think of 
Mazarin as compared with Richelieu?” Other questions were 
these: “Is Louis XIV in the story yet? . . . How old is he? 
. When will he be of age? . . . How old is he, then, when 
he begins to rule? . . . Does Dumas give any dates to show 
when these things take place? . . . What civil war was that 
in which the four friends divided?”’ The manner in which such 
questions, coupled with his previous school instruction, tend to 
focus the pupil’s attention on historical facts and conditions,
-P-A-G-E-237
  
UNDERSTANDING SOCIAL LIFE 221 
is illustrated by the following remark volunteered at the supper 
table concerning Louis’s great minister Colbert. “Say!” said 
the boy, “you know Colbert? His father was a wine dealer. 
It was unusual in those days for such a man to rise to prime 
minister.” Then he hesitated a moment and said, “I’m not sure 
that they called him prime minister.” 
These examples illustrate the possibilities of using material 
that appeals to the instinctive interest in adventure and romance 
as a means of filling a pupil’s mind with vivid historical ideas 
and feelings of meaning. We shall now turn to the second 
instinctive interest, or tendency, contained in our list. 
2. Instinctive interest in persons’ actions and conversa- 
tion.—The instinct of gregariousness (that is, the instinctive 
tendency to flock with other people), when combined with certain 
other simple instinctive tendencies, gives us the tendency to 
be interested in the actions and conversation of other people. 
Common manifestations of this tendency are seen in the way 
children who can scarcely toddle will approach other children, 
gaze at them, fondle them, jabber at them, etc. Highly de- 
veloped and cultivated outcomes of the tendency are shown in 
the delight that most readers take in the conversations in stories. 
To most human beings certain other persons are the most con- 
stantly interesting things in the*universe (excepting only one’s 
own person), and the actions and conversations of these persons 
are probably their most attractive features. . 
Personalizing history.—For this reason the more we can per- 
sonalize history, the more hungrily many pupils will acquire 
historical ideas. One of the principal means of doing this is 
through vivid biographies of interesting people. Lincoln’s biog- 
raphy, which we discussed on page 208, is an especially effective 
example of our point. Even “fictionalized” biographies, how- 
ever, are useful, as shown in the attractive little stories of pioneer 
life such as “Hannah of Kentucky.” I found from experience 
with my son that mere descriptions of pioneer conditions which 
lacked the individual personal element contributed by some real
-P-A-G-E-238
  
222 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
or fictitious hero seldom held his attention. In a later connec- 
tion (p. 228) we shall have occasion to refer to the value of 
such personalizing of history in giving reality to pupils’ his- 
torical ideas. Here we are concerned with it as a means of 
appealing to the fundamental instinctive interest in the actions 
and conversations of people. 
Other instinctive interests. Discussed in “General Methods.” 
—Thus we have indicated in some detail how methods that 
appeal to a pupil’s instinctive interest in romance and adventure 
and to his interest in the actions and conversations of people are 
effective in giving him ideas of social life that are vivid and 
impressive. It would be possible to treat similarly, in turn, each 
of the other instincts listed on page 216. I have already done 
this, however, with numerous examples and pictures in the chap- 
ter on interests in my “General Methods of Teaching in Elemen- 
tary Schools,” to which the reader is referred for further details. 
Such detailed accounts serve to impress upon us the importance 
of our first psychological rule for teaching pupils ideas of social 
life; namely, to appeal to or arouse some fundamental instinc- 
tive tendency, interest, or activity. One psychological reason 
why the methods and devices summarized on page 212 are so 
effective is because they do appeal to the instinctive interests of 
pupils in adventure and romance, in the actions and conversa- 
tions of other people, in imitative play, in physical activity and 
manipulation, in collecting, in problem-solving, and in commu- 
nication and competition. We shall now turn to our second rule, 
to discover a second explanation of the effectiveness of some of 
these devices in giving pupils ideas of social life that are clear, 
vivid, organized, usable, recallable, mobile, and modifiable. 
Rule B. Providing Vivid Experiences 
Psychological necessity of first-hand experiences.— The sec- 
ond rule which we derived from our example of the girl and her 
movie hero reads as follows: In effectively teaching pupils ideas of 
social life, provide first-hand personal experiences, with real ob-
-P-A-G-E-239
  UNDERSTANDING SOCIAL LIFE 223 
jects, persons, and situations, or vivid representations of these. 
In the course of study described in Section III we found this 
rule illustrated by excursions to a grocery store, a bird store, 
and a botanical garden; by the examination of samples of weav- 
ing, Indian relics, and pictures of Indians and deserts; by the 
making of butter; by the construction of sand-pan models of 
Scandinavian fiords and feast halls; by the study of maps of 
the Appalachian barrier; by the acting and observing of histor- 
ical plays; etc. After such vivid personal experiences are pro- 
vided they may be used to build up an elaborate structure of 
ideas through discussion and reflection, as will be described 
later under Rule C. The psychological necessity of beginning 
with actual personal experiences is one of the oldest of pedagog- 
ical principles and has been emphasized by all educational re- 
formers from John Locke (1632-1704) down to the present. 
Thus Professor Dewey says: 
A blind man can never have an adequate understanding of the 
meaning of color and red; a seeing person can acquire the knowl- 
edge only by having certain things designated in such a way as to fix 
attention upon some of their qualities. . . . [Such experiencing] is 
required for all sense qualities—sounds, tastes, colors—and equally 
for all emotional and moral qualities. The meanings of honesty, 
sympathy, hatred, fear, must be grasped by having them presented 
in an individual’s first-hand experience. . . . However advanced the 
person is in knowledge and in scientific training, understanding of 
"a new subject, or a new aspect of an old subject, must always be 
through these acts of experiencing directly the existence or quality 
in question. (22: 132.) 
Pupil’s progress from first-hand experience to symbolic repre- 
sentation.—In reviewing from this standpoint the devices used 
in the course of study, we should note particularly the progres- 
sive transition of the pupil’s ideas from those of his immediate 
environment which he has derived from first-hand observation, 
up through those derived from pictures and other forms of repre- 
sentation, to those derived merely from vivid verbal descrip-
-P-A-G-E-240
    224. TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
tions. In the higher grades we found the pupils getting many 
of their ideas merely from reading, but supplementing the latter, 
wherever necessary, by some more tangible or vivid experience 
in order to clarify the ideas. For example, when the seventh- 
grade class was studying the Appalachian barrier to westward 
migration, most of the pupils had no clear notion of these moun- 
tains, with their long valleys down which the settlers could move 
through western Virginia and Carolina into eastern Tennessee 
and Kentucky. To clarify the situation, the teacher used pic- 
tures, relief maps, models in the sand-pan, and other sources 
of experience which more closely resemble the visual reality 
than do the mere words “mountains,” “valleys,” “gaps,” etc., 
that are contained in the verbal descriptions. 
Classification of activities and devices for giving vivid ex- 
periences.— The activities and devices which are used to give 
such vivid personal experiences we may classify into three main 
divisions, as follows : 
I. Observations of real or pictured or modeled or dramatized 
situations, 
II. Imitative reproduction. 
IIL. Listening to or reading vivid descriptions and narratives. 
We shall note briefly the possibilities under each of these 
main types. 
I. Observations.—Under this division we find the following 
possibilities : 
1. Excursions (a) to the actual total social situation, such as 
a grocery store in operation, or (5) to a replica of the situation 
as set up in a museum. Excursions to points more than a few 
blocks from the school are difficult to organize, but the vividness 
of the experience, when properly prepared for, often justifies 
considerable trouble in their organization. For example, among 
the most vivid recollections which I have from my high-school 
days are those of excursions to a gas works, a soap factory, and 
a tannery, the chemical processes of which we had studied in 
our chemistry class preparatory to the visits.
-P-A-G-E-241
  UNDERSTANDING SOCIAL LIFE 225 
2. Motion pictures. The tendency to use motion pictures in 
school has attained great momentum in recent years. Many 
schoals are now equipped with projecting machines, and edu- 
cational films are being manufactured especially for school 
circulation. Educational experiments are being organized to 
determine the most effective technique of using a motion picture 
in teaching, since the mere observation of it may not produce 
the full educational result that we desire. It is obvious, however, 
from observation of the travel pictures and other educational 
pictures that have been used in the commercial motion-picture 
houses, that these furnish a very lifelike source for vivid experi- 
ences of scenes in foreign lands, of manufacturing and agricul- 
tural processes, of battles, of country scenes for city children and 
city scenes for country children, etc. Historical plays, such as 
Griffith’s wonderful “Birth of a Nation” and “The Fall of Baby- 
lon,” enable the spectator to live in the observation of a scene 
with almost the same degree of visual and emotional reality 
as would be experienced in witnessing the actual events. For a 
scientific discussion of the problems needing investigation in the 
educational use of motion pictures see reference 24 on page 262. 
3. Historical plays on the speaking stage. The large possi- 
bilities of this kind of observation are illustrated by the profound 
effect of Drinkwater’s great play ‘Abraham Lincoln” upon. au- 
diences. For example, one of our leading writers about Lincoln, 
who already knew his life very intimately, was so affected by this 
play that he sat for some minutes after the final curtain, over- 
whelmed with emotion and oblivious to the departing audience. 
I think that the most vivid impression that I have of the char- 
acters in our early American history I obtained from viewing 
the drama “Hamilton,” played by George Arliss, in which the 
vigorous Hamilton, the dignified, democratic Jefferson, and 
the truculent James Monroe moved and talked before me for 
two hours. Even the little dramatizations which I have seen 
pupils in the elementary school present in their morning assem- 
blies have enriched my historical knowledge—particularly one
-P-A-G-E-242
  226 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
in which I observed a seventh-grade class stage all the debates 
concerning slavery that occurred in our American national 
assemblies from the Revolutionary times to the Civil War. 
4. Objects and models. In well-equipped elementary schools 
a school museum provides, for use in the classrooms, collections 
of clothing and utensils of various peoples and tribes, objects 
showing various industrial processes and products in various 
stages of manufacture, such as cocoa, coffee, cork, cotton, wool, 
silk, leather, paint, rubber, etc. 
5. Ordinary “still” pictures. In this connection the text- 
books in recent years have shown great progress and now in- 
clude instructive photographs of places and processes in all parts 
of the world, cuts reproduced from old newspapers and other his- 
torical sources, and even full-page colored pictures that quickly 
rivet the pupils’ attention. In the kindergarten and primary 
grades we find large colored wall pictures representing scenes 
on the farm, or among the Indians, or on the desert, etc. Some 
teachers are particularly resourceful in gathering and mounting 
pictures from many sources, including magazines, railroads and 
steamship companies, standard picture collections, etc. 
6. Drawings, maps, and diagrams. These may vary from 
the simple diagram of a farmyard, used in the first grade, to 
elaborate diagrams of the campaigns of our Revolutionary and 
Civil Wars, used in the seventh and eighth grades. It is impor- 
tant to notice that a diagram is often clearer than a more com- 
plete picture, because the former selects for emphasis just the 
features which we desire to impress upon the observer, while the 
picture by its very completeness may distract attention from 
these essential features. 
Summary of observational activities —Thus as sources for 
observations to give pupils clear and vivid experiences we have 
described (1) excursions, (2) motion pictures, (3) historical 
plays on the speaking stage, (4) objects and models, (5) ordi- 
nary “still” pictures, (6) drawings, maps, and diagrams. We 
shall now turn our attention to the second main group of 
 
-P-A-G-E-243
  UNDERSTANDING SOCIAL LIFE 227 
activities and devices to give vivid personal experience; namely, 
imitative reproduction of social situations. 
II. Imitative reproduction.—In our course of study as de- 
scribed in Section III we found the pupils’ imitative reproduction 
of social activities to be a very frequent form of experiencing. 
We may divide their imitations into two main classes, as follows: 
1. Exact reproduction of social activities, in miniature. Good 
examples are the actual making of butter; the actual dyeing of 
woolen yarn with dyes made from cranberries, spinach, etc. ; 
and the actual weaving of a miniature rug. 
2. Playful representation of social activities. For example, 
in playing grocery store in the kindergarten, there was not 
actual buying and selling, but merely a playful substitute. 
Nevertheless the practice in constructing shelves, stocking them 
with cans and boxes, and making purchases with paper pennies, 
nickels, and dimes sufficiently resembled the real social proc- 
esses to give the pupils vivid educative experiences of social 
activities. Similarly, when the fifth-grade class dramatized the 
fusion of Roman and Teutonic civilizations, they did not expe- 
rience the real feelings of conflict, religious zeal, lust for power, 
responsibility for results, etc. that were felt by the Romans and 
Teutons; nevertheless the experience of endeavoring to dress, 
behave, and speak like Cesar or Charlemagne or some other 
hero tended to increase the pupils’ appreciation of the reality 
and characteristics of such a personage. 
Ill. Vivid descriptions in language.—In the two sources 
of vivid experiences described so far—namely, (1) observations 
and (II) imitative reproduction of social activities—there was 
frequently contact with the reality itself or something that 
closely resembled it. From such experiences and reflection upon 
them pupils accumulate a stock of ideas and meanings which 
may be revived and reconstructed through the use of language 
so as to give new ideas that are sometimes as vivid and impres- 
sive as the original experiences with the actual realities. Inter- 
esting examples of this process of vivid representation through 
 
-P-A-G-E-244
228 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
language are found in the effectiveness with which great novel- 
ists and dramatists depict their characters. Thus a character 
in a book, through the completeness and intimacy of the story 
of his life, may become more real to the reader than any actual 
person he knows excepting himself. An ideal example is found 
in the skill with which Dumas makes his great hero D’Artagnan, 
of “The Three Musketeers,” live in the minds of his readers. 
Concerning this romantic figure Robert Louis Stevenson is 
quoted as saying’ 
I do not say that there is no character as*well drawn in Shake- 
speare ; I do say that.there is none that I love so wholly. No part 
of the world has ever seemed so charming to me as these pages; 
and not even my friends are quite so real, perhaps quite so dear, as 
D’Artagnan.t 
If our writers of schoolbooks could make social life as vivid 
to pupils as Dumas has made D’Artagnan and his adventures, 
our texts would be model sources for providing vivid experiences 
through the skillful use of language. 
Summary of Rules A and B for giving pupils insight into 
social life-—Thus far we have considered two of our psycho- 
logical rules for giving pupils ideas of social life; namely, (A) 
appeal to or arouse some fundamental instinctive tendency, 
interest, or activity and (B) provide first-hand personal expe- 
riences, with real objects, persons, and situations, or vivid repre- 
sentations of these. The activities and the devices for carrying 
out Rule B we described under (I) observations by means of 
(1) excursions, (2) motion pictures, (3) historical plays, (4) ob- 
jects and models, (5) ordinary “still” pictures, (6) drawings, 
maps, and diagrams; (II) imitative reproduction through 
(1) exact reproduction of social activities, in miniature, and 
(2) playful representation of social activities; (III) vivid de- 
scriptions in language.

de Bragelonne.”

UNDERSTANDING SOCIAL LIFE 229 
The carrying-out of Rules A and B assures the partial attain- 
ment of our aims in endeavoring to give pupils social ideas that 
are clear, vivid, organized, usable, recallable, mobile, and modi- 
fiable. Much greater success, however, will be assured if we 
carry out also Rule C, to which we shall now turn our attention. 
Rule C. Stimulating Attentive Reflection upon Experiences 
Psychological characteristics that are especially secured 
by reflection.—The third rule that we derived from the exam- 
ple of the romantic girl and her fascinating movie hero was 
worded thus: “Stimulate the pupils to elaborate and reflect 
upon their experiences from many angles and in many connec- 
tions.” We can see the value of this rule if we recall the seven 
characteristics which we desire to impart to pupils’ ideas (as 
listed on page 213) and then notice which of these are especially 
contributed by applying Rules A and B and which are especially 
affected by Rule C. It is likely that the first two characteristics 
—namely, that ideas should be (1) clear and (2) vivid—are es- 
pecially contributed through providing the instinctive appeal 
and vivid experiencing required by Rules A and B. It is likely 
that Rule C, which requires attentive reflection upon experiences, 
not only aids greatly in clarifying the pupils’ ideas, but also 
especially contributes to securing the remaining characteristics ; 
that is, through attentive elaboration and reflection upon their 
experiences, the pupils’ ideas will become (to repeat the descrip- 
tion and numbering used on page 213) (3) organized (that is, 
associated with logically related ideas, subordinate ideas held 
under larger ones, etc.) ; (4) usable (that is, ready to be applied 
in understanding and interpreting new experiences, solving new 
problems, etc.) ; (5) recallable (that is, so deeply impressed and 
well connected with other ideas that they can be recalled when 
needed) ; (6) mobile (that is, not merely clamped in one place 
or system, but freely associated and easily recalled in many 
connections) ; (7) modifiable (that is, not hard and fast, but 
subject to modification from new experiences or data).

230 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
How devices stimulate reflection. Use of problem-solving 
and expression.—If we will now turn our attention to the pupils’ 
activities and the teachers’ devices described on page 212, we 
shall see that several of these are especially valuable because they 
do stimulate and require the attentive reflection upon experiences 
which Rule C calls for. In evaluating each device from this 
standpoint, we try to see how it does make the pupil recall his 
ideas, turn them over, examine them from different angles, test 
them, modify them, rearrange and organize them, etc. We shall 
find that two of the major activities which we outlined —namely, 
problem-solving and pupil expression—are particularly valu- 
able for these purposes. 
Problem-solving. Clarifies, organizes, and freely associates 
ideas. —Examples of problems which occurred in the course of 
study described in Section III are the following: In the kin- 
dergarten (as described on page 185) the children, while con- 
structing a play store, were required to plan their store and its 
contents, from the largest features, such as walls and windows, 
down to the smallest articles, such as vegetables, fruits, baskets, 
money, etc. In the fifth grade, while writing a historical play, 
the pupils were required to decide what situations they wanted 
to represent, to search for descriptions of costumes, to suggest 
action and dialogue, to reject unsuitable parts, etc. In the 
seventh grade the pupils were required to infer the course that 
migrations would take over the Appalachian barrier, to explain 
the reasons for each route, to devise means of transporting goods 
between the old Northwest and the Atlantic-coast states, etc. 
The reader will readily see that such problems require the pupils 
to reflect very extensively and carefully and to examine each 
situation and suggestion from many angles. In our next chap- 
ter we shall describe at great length examples of problem-solving 
lessons and the technique of conducting them. Here we are 
concerned merely to note that such lessons furnish one of the 
most important forms of mental activity needed by pupils in 
order to clarify and organize their ideas and to associate these
-P-A-G-E-247
UNDERSTANDING SOCIAL LIFE 231 
in many useful connections so that they may be easily recalled 
and used when needed in school or after graduation. 
Pupil expression. Many varied activities included.—Most 
of the remaining devices for stimulating pupils to reflect upon 
their experiences fall under the general head of pupil expression. 
As listed on page 212, the various forms of expression included 
the following : 
1. Playful imitating of social activities. 
2. Constructing miniature objects and situations. 
3. Drawing maps, pictures, diagrams, and graphs. 
. Describing experiences, objects, and situations. 
. Composing and presenting historical plays. 
. Discussing problems that arise. 
. Organizing, reviewing, and outlining the outcomes of the 
pupils’ experiences. 
How expression forces one to refine one’s ideas.—The value 
of such expressional devices in stimulating pupils to clarify and 
organize their ideas is easily seen when we recall how our own 
efforts to explain or to draw or construct something have re- 
vealed to us our ignorance and forced us to correct it. For ex- 
ample, suppose you try to describe or to draw or to model the 
Great Lakes. In doing this many persons will find that they do 
not know whether Lake Superior flows into Lake Michigan or 
vice versa, or whether one or the other or both flow into Lake 
Huron. Others will find that they do not know whether Niagata 
Falls is near the eastern end of Lake Erie or of Lake Ontario. 
In general, if you will undertake any activity that requires you 
to express ideas, you will find that you are forced to refine 
and organize the latter in many ways, and you will often be 
surprised to discover enormous gaps in your knowledge and 
uncertainties in your impressions and ideas. 
Progressive schools use many expressional activities to develop 
pupils’ insight.—This fact, that expression of ideas is one of 
the best devices for clarifying and organizing them, has led to 
the very extensive use of many forms of expression in the teach- 
Aun 
pt ~ 
 
-P-A-G-E-248
  
  232 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
ing of history and community life in elementary schools. In a 
later chapter we shall discuss such expressional devices from the 
standpoint of giving pupils skill in communicating ideas to an 
audience. Here, however, we are concerned merely with the 
manner in which such expression aids in acquiring insight 
into social life. 
Imitation and construction in primary grades ; more abstract 
expressions in higher grades.—In the kindergarten and primary 
grades the forms of expression that are especially emphasized in 
acquiring insight into social life are playful imitation of social 
activities, manual construction, discussion, and description. As 
the pupils advance through the grades we find increasing em- 
phasis on language expression and upon drawing, diagraming, 
and graphing. The language expression includes the oral discus- 
sion of problems, outlines for oral and written descriptions and 
narratives, and the composition of historical plays. All these 
forms of expression are important as devices for stimulating 
pupils to reconstruct, elaborate, clarify, organize, and freely 
associate their ideas of social processes, activities, and relations. 
Conclusion and summary of Section IV.—This brings to 
an end our rather long Section IV, entitled “Evaluation of 
Methods and Devices used in studying Community Life and 
History.” In beginning our evaluation we first summarized the 
devices used and then indicated that the value of each device 
depends upon its effectiveness in making pupils’ ideas of social 
life clear, vivid, organized, usable, recallable, mobile, and 
modifiable. From the example of the girl and her movie hero 
we inferred that the psychological processes needed for this 
purpose are (A) strong instinctive appeals, (B) vivid personal 
experiences, and (C) mental elaboration and attentive reflection. 
Each of these processes was then used to explain the effective- 
ness and justify the use of many of the devices included in our 
list. From the whole section the reader should derive the general 
impression that fundamental psychological laws justify progres- 
sive elementary schools in their use of methods that appeal to
-P-A-G-E-249
  
UNDERSTANDING SOCIAL LIFE 233 
the pupil’s varied instincts, give him vivid personal experiences, 
and stimulate him to elaborate, reconstruct, test, modify, and 
organize his ideas of social life as a means of cultivating his 
insight into contemporary civilization. 
Section V. Devices FoR SECURING SocIAL INSIGHT 
THROUGH GEOGRAPHY, Fiction, ARITHMETIC, AND 
APPLIED SCIENCE 
A few examples to be described.— You will recall that in 
opening this chapter with a cross section of contemporary social 
life as represented in the contents of a weekly review, we found 
that the topics contained would be discussed in school in the 
following subjects: community life and history, geography, fic- 
tion, arithmetic, and applied science. Since we have completed 
in Sections III and IV the discussion of methods of teaching the 
first two of these subjects, it would now be in order, if space 
permitted, to give a similarly full discussion of the devices to 
be used in teaching geography, fiction, arithmetic, and applied 
science so as to increase the pupil’s sympathetic insight into 
contemporary civilization. We have not space for this full treat- 
ment, however; hence we shall merely give a few examples of 
devices and practices and suggest that their psychological justi- 
fication will be found in the way in which they appeal to pupils’ 
instinctive interests, provide vivid personal experiences, and 
stimulate attentive reflection according to the principles devel- 
oped in Section III. 
A. Geographic Devices for giving Insight into Contem- 
porary Civilization 
Example. Fifth grade’s study of British Isles.—We may 
illustrate progressive methods of teaching insight into social 
life through lessons in geography by describing the study of the 
British Isles as pursued by a fifth grade in The University of 
Chicago Elementary School about 1917. Before the pupils
-P-A-G-E-250
234 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
reached this stage in their work, they had acquired considerable 
familiarity with the lives and customs of different peoples, such 
as the Indians, Arabs, and Vikings, and had studied thoroughly 
the development of the Chicago region (as described on pages 
194-200). Furthermore, they had learned about the earth as a 
globe, had located upon it the historic peoples of whom they 
had learned, and had spent several months in studying North 
America.t With this background they proceeded to the study 
of the British Isles, as described in the following quotation 
from the course of study for 1917: 
Main problem. Geographic causes of Britain’s leadership.—In this 
unit of study the work centers about the question, Why do the Brit- 
ish Isles lead the world in manufacturing and commerce? The physi- 
cal wall map and Longman’s “Atlas” are studied for data upon the 
problem. Such questions as the following are given to develop the 
advantages or disadvantages due to location, climate, surface, and 
other natural resources : Where are the British Isles with reference to 
Europe? to America? How does their location aid or hinder manu- 
facturing? commerce? Is the coast regular or irregular? long or 
short? What are the possibilities for good harbors? Where are their 
harbors? Are there many rivers? Name them. How may they aid 
manufacturing? commerce? Where are the highlands? lowlands? 
What is probably the leading industry in these sections? What 
mineral resources aid manufacturing and commerce? What are 
some of the other conditions that favor these industries? Which of 
these conditions have been found in the British Isles? The topics 
“climate” and “rainfall” are developed in a similar way to show 
how these factors aid the life of the country. Reference to the ap- 
pendix of the text brings out a comparison of the area and popula- 
tion with that of Illinois and the United States and shows that 
though the area is less than twice that of Illinois the population is 
about half that of our whole country. 
Inferences——From the foregoing preliminary study such infer- 
ences as the following are made and written upon the board: 
1See the author’s “ General Methods of Teaching in Elementary Schools,” 
pp. 117-119, for a description of the methods used in studying North 
America.
-P-A-G-E-251
  
  UNDERSTANDING SOCIAL LIFE 235 
England is engaged chiefly in 
1. Manufacturing, because of its probable wealth in coal and iron 
and its lack of large farm lands. 
2. Commerce, because its small area and great population make 
it necessary to import food and raw materials. 
3. Oceanic shipping, because it must reach other nations by sea; 
to do so its merchant marine and navy seek to hold first place 
upon the seas. 
Research for verification —These and many similar inferences are 
made the basis for much reading and sifting’ of the text, the supple- 
mentary readers, magazines, newspaper clippings, travelers’ guides, 
and government leaflets. As each inference is verified and elabo- 
rated it is summed up in a written exercise illustrated by drawings, 
maps, or charts. 
Devices for studying the coal and iron industries—The various 
manufacturing and allied industries are studied somewhat in detail. 
A trip to the Field Museum gives an opportunity to examine models 
of coal and iron mines and the series of models showing the methods 
of smelting iron ore. Drawings of the former are made, and a 
simple cardboard model of a blast furnace is constructed. A visit 
to the high-school foundry and machine shop shows the melting and 
molding and the making of iron goods. A list is made of our iron, 
steel, and other metal wares bearing English trademarks, including 
such things as knives, scissors, needles, pins, skates, hatchets, swords, 
buttons, screws, and rifles. Most of these come from the Birming- 
ham district. Maps are made showing the relation of the coal areas 
to the iron and steel centers. England’s rank among the coal and 
iron nations is found and its significance is discussed. 
Shipbuilding. Devices in composition and literature-—A part of 
Great Britain’s iron and steel is used in making great ocean vessels, 
for the British Isles build almost one. half of the world’s yearly 
output. Pictures of ships are collected; the shipbuilding industry 
of such cities as Belfast, Glasgow, and Edinburgh is studied. Long- 
fellow’s “The Building of the Ship” and Kipling’s “The Ship that 
found Herself” are read in the literature period, and a series of 
lessons on this topic are worked out in the English-composition 
periods. 
Textiles. Personal and historic background—The study of the 
manufacturing of textiles in Great Britain is next taken up. Various  
-P-A-G-E-252
236 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
commercial textiles have been studied in the handwork classes. The 
pupils have scoured, carded, spun, dyed, and woven wool into cloth. 
With this concrete experience as a background a study is made of 
the cotton, woolen, linen, and silk industries of the British Isles. 
While the manufacturing of each of these textiles is studied in de- 
tail, the following topics give the order of development : 
English Colonies and Other Regions producing the Raw Material. 
Location of Manufacturing Districts with Reference to Coal 
Regions ; with Reference to Seaports. 
Important Cities engaged in the Textile Industry. 
Kinds of Cloth Made. 
Amount of World’s Supply Produced. 
Reasons for Britain’s Supremacy in Textiles. 
This last topic is developed somewhat in detail in the history 
course in connection with the introduction of the Flemish weavers 
into England during the reign of Edward III; the extension of sheep- 
farming following the period of the Black Death, when landholders, 
unable to cultivate or dispose of their lands, turned them into sheep 
pastures ; and the growth of textile manufactures under the domes- 
tic, guild, and factory systems. 
About eight lessons are devoted to the topic “The Textile Indus- 
try” at this time, but later, in studying the industry in France, Ger- 
many, and Belgium, the main points are again briefly reviewed. 
Pottery.—In teaching the manufacture of china and porcelain the 
method is similar to that described above. It may be added, how- 
ever, that a trip is made to the school pottery department, where the 
whole process is seen—mixing the clays, casting, molding on the 
potter’s wheel, glazing and firing in the kiln. 
World commerce.—The last large topic is “Trade and Transpor- 
tation.” While England has numerous rivers and a close network of 
railroads and canals that aid her internal trade and facilitate the 
transportation of goods to the seaboard, these make but a small link 
in the chain of transoceanic routes with which Great Britain has 
girded the earth. Every yard of goods or pound of steel made for 
export must be transported overseas to her markets. In this con- 
nection attention is called to her many good harbors, her facil- 
ities for loading and unloading, the Manchester ship canal, and the 
steamship routes to the markets throughout the world. The col- 
onies are indicated on outline maps, and lists are made of the goods 
 
-P-A-G-E-253
  UNDERSTANDING SOCIAL LIFE 237 
sold to the colonies and of those brought back to the mother country 
to balance the trade. 
Notebook organizes answers to main problems.—Throughout the 
study of the British Isles repeated reference is made to the main 
problem, Why do the British Isles lead the world in commerce and 
manufacturing? The salient points bearing on the problem are now 
organized, and oral and written summaries are made. Before com- 
pleting the study of the British Isles each child compiles a book in 
which he places his written exercises, drawings, maps, charts, pic- 
tures, magazine articles, newspaper clippings, and other data cover- 
ing the essential points of interest. 
Interpretative basis for other countries—In general the other 
leading countries of Europe are studied in much the same way, 
though less time is given to each than to Great Britain. More time 
is given to the latter in order to develop a geographic background 
for the history course of the grade and to organize in detail topics 
used repeatedly in the remainder of the course. Such topics as re- 
lations of climate and surface to industries, type industries, and req- 
uisites for good harbors furnish data for the study of other countries. 
(3b: 117-120) . 
General characteristics of methods used.— With these con- 
crete examples of geographic devices in mind we can readily 
appreciate the following general statement of the methods used 
in fifth-grade geography as quoted from the course of study: 
Methods based on pupils’ interests—Interests characteristic of 
fifth-grade children have in a large measure guided the selection of 
the subject matter and the method of presentation. 
Interest in “Why ?”—Interest in the “‘why” has necessitated the 
emphasis on the causal relation. The children, while still retaining 
a fondness for the story of a people, no longer accept it unquestion- 
ingly. They constantly ask: “Why is it so?” “Why do one half 
of Canton’s people live in boats?” ‘Why is China so crowded when 
she has so much room?” “Why doesn’t she work her coal mines ?” 
Problem method.—Interest demanding a sustained effort in fol- 
lowing out the steps in the solution of a problem determines in gen- 
eral the method of approach to the study of the different countries. 
In such problems as Why has Great Britain become the leading
-P-A-G-E-254
    
238 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
manufacturing country of the world? or Why is Japan becoming 
the Great Britain of the Far East? the children show a keen interest 
in organizing step by step the geographic factors that control the 
manner of life among the people and that explain why their ambi- 
tions are like or unlike those of other nations. The problem method 
necessitates the extensive use of books and maps ; hence considerable 
attention is given to teaching the children how to study these in 
gathering and organizing data. 
Collections and organized pasted books.—Interest in collecting is 
strongly characteristic of this age of the child. The interest leads 
to the collecting of all sorts of material, such as pictures, maps, 
pamphlets, products, railroad and steamship folders, and excerpts 
from magazines and books. The interest is utilized as a determining 
motive for the pupil in compiling a book containing written exer- 
cises, maps, drawings, pictures, and clippings that bear upon the 
problem studied. 
Concrete beginnings—In considering each of the leading coun- 
tries of Eurasia a preliminary survey is made of the people by 
means of pictures, lantern slides, museum material, accounts of those 
who have visited the country, and stories recalled from reading 
and earlier studies. 
Discovering a principal problem.— During the introductory lessons 
a problem is discovered or suggested, the solution of which gives a 
definite motive for considering the important geographic factors that 
influence the conditions of the life of the country. (8b: 116-117) 
Details of actual lessons.—It is obvious from these quo- 
tations that in progressive methods of studying geography we 
find provision for the same psychological processes as we dis- 
covered in our study of the devices used in teaching community 
life and history ; namely, strong instinctive appeals, vivid per- 
sonal experiences, and attentive elaboration and reflection by the 
pupils. In order to secure a more detailed impression of what 
actually goes on in the classroom, we may examine the following 
concrete examples of a few lessons’ which were taught by Miss 
Edith Parker in The University of Chicago Elementary School: 
1I am indebted to Miss Eula Sleeth for the descriptions of these’lessons. 
 
-P-A-G-E-255
  UNDERSTANDING SOCIAL LIFE 239 
Practice in using intellectual tools—The devices which 
are especially illustrated by these lessons include practice in 
(1) map-reading, (2) picture-reading, and (3) graphing. In- 
cidentally they illustrate several other phases of geographic 
teaching. In the next chapter we shall give two additional 
lessons to illustrate problem-solving in geography. 
Fourth-grade practice in map-reading.— The lesson illus- 
trating map-reading was observed in the work of a fourth-grade 
class that had just begun the study of Greece. 
Preparation.—The lesson opened with a discussion of certain 
matters concerning Greece with which the pupils were somewhat 
familiar and which provided the desired setting and approach 
for the practice in map-reading. 
The challenge.—The teacher then said that she was going to 
ask the class to do something which would really be difficult, 
even for the older pupils, but that she felt sure they could do it, 
because they had shown such excellent thinking ability. Every- 
one was at attention and eager to prove that her confidence was 
not misplaced. A colored contour map of the Mediterranean 
region was displayed, and its coloring was explained by using 
portions of countries studied before taking up Greece. 
Asking the map two questions.—The teacher said: “I am 
now going to let you ask the map two questions—‘Is it high or 
low?’ ‘Is it rough or smooth?’ Look at it carefully, and, when 
the map has answered you, come and tell me what it says.” 
She then seated herself some distance from the class. One by 
one the children skipped up and whispered to her. ‘‘Good,” she 
said to one. “Yes, you have seen one thing, but look again, for 
you haven’t heard the map’s answer to the second.” Or, “Do 
look again, for you haven’t heard the answers.” Children thus 
addressed went back to the map. The class as a whole were 
commended and were told that this was called “reading a map.” 
“Reading without words,” commented one little girl. The class 
decided it was great fun.
-P-A-G-E-256
  240 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
Interpreting Greek islands.—Attention was then called to 
the islands near Greece, and the teacher spoke of them as 
“stepping-stones” and asked what the islands would tempt 
the Greeks to do. ‘Build boats,” said the class. Then it was 
brought out through discussion that as islands stretched on 
and on, the Greeks would be tempted to go farther and farther 
and improve their boats; that they would become traders and 
colonists. The teacher asked whether any of the class knew the 
parts of the Bible called Ephesians, Philippians, etc., and ex- 
plained their connection with the Greek colonies. The idea of 
the Greeks’ being merchants was reémphasized, and then the dis- 
cussion centered around the Greek fruit and confection stores in 
Chicago. These two things, “fruit and confections,” were 
shown to be the special commodities in which they deal. The 
class was told that many Greeks come to this country and 
become good citizens. 
Practice in reading pictures.—Training pupils to secure geo- 
graphic information from pictures is illustrated by the fourth- 
grade lesson described below. It occurred on the day following 
the map-reading lesson (described above). 
Review.—“ What questions did we ask the map on Friday?” 
queried the teacher, and thus introduced a review of the surface 
of Greece, followed by points learned concerning her trade. 
Inferences from pictures.—A picture of the Acropolis was 
shown, the children in their discussion bringing out the fact that 
its ruins seemed to signify age. When the stadium was shown, 
the teacher asked that they notice what the picture told about 
the country. Noting the hillsides where the seats were built, 
they recalled that the map had told of uneven ground. A pic- 
ture of a mountain was introduced, with the question ‘“‘What 
does this tell that the map did not tell you?” “It tells of steep- 
ness, which the map did not,” said one. Another: “It tells that 
the mountains are rocky.” “It tells that people live chiefly 
in the valleys,” was suggested by another illustration. A picture 
of sheep evoked a discussion of grazing, while another showed 
 
-P-A-G-E-257
  
UNDERSTANDING SOCIAL LIFE 241 
“farms in valley floors.” One which showed fruit trees caused 
the teacher to suggest that the fruits were the same as those in 
Palestine, only in greater abundance. As olives, figs, grapes, 
and other fruits were being named, she said, ‘I wonder whether 
you are beginning to see the connection between this topic and 
one we had yesterday.” ‘ Yes—why the Greeks are fruit mer- 
chants,” said a boy, with great pleasure at being able to see the 
relation. A picture to show how the coasts have helped Greece 
a little showed men fishing, while one of goats called forth from 
the teacher the question “In valley or mountains?” Stereo- 
graph slides were then given to the class. Four were of Greece, 
and the class was asked to look for new things which these 
would tell of the land or its people. 
Graphing Japan’s imports.—Practice in using graphing as 
a technical tool for studying social life is illustrated by the fol- 
lowing lesson from a fifth grade: 
Exports reviewed.—“When we worked on the export map 
of Japan what did you find was the greatest export ?” asked the 
teacher. The class replied, “Raw silk.” ‘Did they need to 
bring in anything to produce the raw silk?” was the second 
question, to which the class said, ‘‘No.” “What was the next 
important export from the standpoint of value?” ‘Cotton 
yarn.” “Did they “heed anything for this from some other 
country?” ‘Raw cotton,” answered the class. 
Directions for cotton imports——The teacher then asked the 
class to take out their graph books and dictated, “Leaving one 
large square at the bottom, count up ten large squares.” The 
pupils did this, outlining the squares so that a narrow vertical 
column was shown. This was explained as representing the 
amount of raw cotton shipped into Japan from other countries. 
Questions brought out the fact that India as well as the United 
States is a great cotton-growing country, and that, India being 
nearer to Japan than the United States is, more cotton would 
probably be secured from India. The teacher then dictated: 
“Count up seven squares on the ten already marked off. Label
-P-A-G-E-258
  242 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
this to show that it is India’s share to Japan.” ‘Two large and 
two and one-half small squares will be sent from the United 
States, and the rest from China.” 
Other products represented.—By following similar directions 
other products, such as oil cake, machinery, pig iron, etc., were 
represented in the graph. In the case of oil cake several min- 
utes were spent in discussing its nature and utility before draw- 
ing the column to represent the amount imported. 
Planning an assembly program on Japan.—As a final pic- 
ture of actual classroom activities in teaching geography we 
shall give descriptions of two lessons in which this fifth-grade 
class was engaged in the preliminary planning of a program to 
be presented to the assembled classes at the opening morning 
exercises of the intermediate grades. 
First lesson. Pupils suggest suitable points for presentation. 
—The class was reminded by the teacher that they were to 
plan an assembly program. She suggested that they take five 
minutes to think it over, each jotting down points which would 
offer a basis for a good discussion, keeping in mind their audi- 
ence and choosing topics which would interest both sixth-grade 
and fourth-grade pupils. After the allotted “thinking” time was 
finished, Mary suggested the topic “How the sea has helped 
Japan,” adding: ‘‘I think there should be five topics under this, 
one person to talk about each. Have the first ‘Protection’ and 
let somebody tell the story of Kublai Khan.” “Fishing” was next 
proposed, and after discussion the class decided on the following 
subtopics: (1) “Warm and cold currents”; (2) ‘‘ What is done 
with the fish—dried, used as fertilizer,” etc.; (3) “Methods 
of catching fish—nets, cormorants, trawlers, drifters, whalers” ; 
(4) “Diet—menu.” One pupil then said that “Farming” 
should certainly be on the program, and the class voted to have 
two subjects discussed under this heading; namely, ‘‘What they 
raise” and “How Japan has fed herself for centuries.” When 
the next pupil to speak proposed that ‘How Japan gained her 
colonies” should be considered, an interesting discussion by the
-P-A-G-E-259
  UNDERSTANDING SOCIAL LIFE 243 
class arose as to how much of this subject would be understood 
by the fourth grade, and some suggested ideas were rejected as 
unsuitable. The next idea brought forward was that pictures of 
the country should be shown on the screen. Just as the lesson 
period was finished, “Exports and imports” was added to the 
list at the suggestion of a member. 
Second lesson. Discussing methods of presentation.—The 
first point taken up was how the subject of imports could be 
presented so as to be most interesting. One boy said he thought 
there should be two blackboards on the platform—on one a 
map of Japan; on the other a boat. He said the pupil who was 
to speak to the assembly could draw a boat, load it, and send it 
off. This would be then erased, and a boat shown with things 
brought into Japan. One little girl objected, “I think there 
must be two boards for boats, because if you try to erase the 
first, then the board will get too messy.” Another child said, 
“Take the picture of the boat; load it with exports for China 
and the United States.” He got no farther, for this met vigor- 
ous objection on the score that it would “mix up” the fourth- 
grade children. “Dress and houses” was then taken up, and as 
the children were discussing the points to be presented, the 
teacher asked whether they were going to represent the Japa- 
nese as an especially strange people or as neighbors with different 
customs from ours. The children thought they should be con- 
ceived in the latter way. The teacher said this was right and 
reminded them that we seem just as peculiar to foreign people 
as they do to us. She gave a résumé of a letter written back to 
Japan by one of the first Japanese consuls to come to the United 
States, in which he described some of our customs and manners, 
showing that they were ridiculous to him. She added that it 
would be all right to present on their program enough differences 
to make the Japanese appear picturesque and interesting, but 
not in such a way as to make them seem peculiar. This was all 
said in such a pleasing way that, with other remarks of the 
teacher, it reminded the writer of a quotation: “The duty of the
-P-A-G-E-260
  244 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
teacher of geography is to instill into the heart of the child a love 
for his brother, regardless of nationality, color, or creed.” 
Conclusion of geographic devices. Outcomes in sympathetic 
social insight.—This concludes our series of examples to illus- 
trate the devices used in giving pupils insight into contemporary 
civilization through the study of geography. The broad lines 
along which the pupils’ development is to be guided in such 
teaching are effectively stated in the following quotation of cer- 
tain of the aims laid down in the fifth-grade course of study in 
geography which we quoted above: 
1. To give impressions of Eurasia and its people through the use 
of concrete material, reading, field trips, map study, etc. 
2. To emphasize the fact of adjustment to environment by bring- 
ing out the relation of such factors as soil, climate, mineral re- 
sources, and location to the life of the people. 
3. To show something of the interrelation and interdependence of 
nations through the study of the products, trade routes, industries, etc. 
4. To engender a sympathetic understanding of the peoples dif- 
fering from us in race, customs, ideals, and modes of living. 
B. Reading Fiction to develop Social Insight 
What books to use. Rousseau’s use of “Robinson Crusoe.” 
—One of the most influential modern suggestions for using a 
work of fiction to give social insight was made by Rousseau in 
1762, when he advised using “Robinson Crusoe” as a textbook 
in which the pupil would find vivid pictures of a man meeting 
his needs through his own efforts. This suggestion was accepted 
by certain noted educators in Europe, and for over a century its 
influence can be traced in their schools. A very recent example 
of a similar practice in this country is found in a course of study 
in community life for the junior high school of The University 
of Chicago. At the end of the first chapter, which is entitled 
“Myself and Others,” we find these questions : 
1Published in slightly modified form as H. C. Hill's Community Life 
and Civic Problems.” (Ginn and Company, 1922.) 
 
-P-A-G-E-261
UNDERSTANDING SOCIAL LIFE 245 
After Robinson Crusoe had been wrecked on his lonely island, was 
he dependent in any way on others ? 
While on his island Robinson Crusoe became in turn a house- 
builder, farmer, stock-raiser, doctor, basket-maker, hatter, miller, 
cook, boat-builder, tailor, and teacher. Why did he not become a 
merchant, banker, policeman? 
Systematic fiction readings for community life—Since the 
time of Rousseau, fiction that is suitable for giving pupils correct 
ideas of social life has become so abundant that Mr. H. C. Hill, 
who organized the course of study in community life just re- 
ferred to, was able to append to each chapter a long list of books 
of fiction that contain relevant stories or discussions. For ex- 
ample, on the topic “The family” we find about thirty titles, 
including such well-known stories as “Little Women,” “Little 
Men,” “The Cotter’s Saturday Night,” The Mill on the Floss,” 
“Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch.” On the topic “The 
church” we find about twenty titles, including ‘The Pilgrim’s 
Progress,” ‘The Sky Pilot,” “The Vision of Sir Launfal,” “The 
Cloister and the Hearth,” and “Ben Hur.” On the topic “The 
school” we find some thirty titles, including “Nicholas Nic- 
kleby,” “The Hoosier Schoolmaster,” “Tom Brown’s School- 
Days,” “Stover at Yale,” “Emmy Lou.” Mr. Hill’s list of 
fiction titles gives the most impressive suggestions that I have 
seen for furnishing pupils with ideas of the various complex 
phases of social life through the use of fiction, and demonstrates 
clearly the great possibilities of systematically using such read- 
ing in school to increase the pupils’ sympathetic insight into 
contemporary civilization. 
Varied methods of teaching fiction for social insight. Ex- 
amples——The methods of teaching that should be used in 
order to interest the pupils in such reading, direct their choices, 
and organize, stimulate, and correct their thinking have not 
been clearly determined. One noted authority emphasizes the 
value of the mere enrichment of the pupil’s experience that 
comes from abundant reading of this type, regardless of any
-P-A-G-E-262
246 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
discussions or recitations or reports that may be required. 
In addition to such valuable enrichment through mere vivid 
experiencing, it is probably also desirable in some cases to 
use methods that will require the pupils to reflect upon the 
experiences presented. The two questions given above relative 
to Robinson Crusoe illustrate instruction of this type. 
Lesson on “ Marmion.” —Another example of such teaching 
is found in the following brief excerpt from the stenographic 
report of a high-school literature lesson on Scott’s “Marmion.” 
During the lesson the discussion turned to the topic ‘‘ Knight- 
hood,” and proceeded as follows: 
(1) Teacuer. What were the ideals of the knights of that period ? 
Pupit. They must be brave, fight well, ride well, and be faithful. 
(2) T. Anything else ? 
P. They must always be loyal to their king and help anyone in 
trouble. 
(3) T. These were the chief points. Have you read any stories 
of any other knight besides Marmion? 
ist P. Sir Launfal, Ivanhoe. 
2p P. All the stories of the Round Table. 
4p P.-“Parsifal.”” 
(4) T. Does that belong to this period? 
P. A little earlier. 
(5) T. Still, you have read about knights and their ideals. Any 
other stories ? 
P. “Sir Nigel.” 
(6) T. Who is the most interesting knight you have read about ? 
P. Ivanhoe. 
(7) T. You liked that best? How many do? (Hands) 
(8) T. A good story of a very interesting knight. Do you think 
Marmion was a true knight? (Hands) 
P. I think he was, as far as fighting and braveness were con- 
cerned ; but when he put Clare in prison I don’t think that showed 
a good spirit. 
(9) T. Why did he put Clare in prison? 
P. I mean Constance—he wanted to marry Clare, and he put Con- 
stance in prison to get her out of the way.
-P-A-G-E-263
UNDERSTANDING SOCIAL LIFE 247 
(zo) T. Did he put her in there expecting she would be killed? 
Pea. 
(11) T. Your opinion, Arthur? 
ArtTHuR. He was worse when he forged the letters. (23: 90) 
Three contrasting purposes in reading fiction.—The problem 
of determining what methods to use in teaching fiction in order 
to develop social insight is complicated by the fact that works 
of fiction may be read for at least three different purposes : 
1. For the harmless enjoymént of leisure. This is the chief 
purpose and will be discussed at length in Chapter XIV, on 
harmless enjoyment. 
2. For moral inspiration. This is a perfectly worthy purpose 
and will be discussed in Chapter XV, on civic-moral training. 
3. For sympathetic understanding of human nature and in- 
sight into social life. This is the purpose that concerns us in 
this chapter. 
Purposes discussed by Rousseau and Herbart.—Many great 
authorities from Plato down to the present time have discussed 
the proper balancing of these three purposes. Thus Rousseau, 
the most inspiring influence in modern education, objected in 
1762 to teaching children AXsop’s fables because, he asserted, 
the child would miss the moral point intended and would sym- 
pathize with the villain instead of with the virtuous hero. Again, 
Herbart, one of the greatest German writers on education, 
stated, about 1809, that he thought Homer’s Odyssey contained 
the finest revelation of human nature to be found anywhere, and 
accordingly he thought that children should read it; but he 
objected to “preachy,” moralizing methods of teaching it. 
For social insight provide interest, vivid experiences, and at- 
tentive reflection—tThe selection of the appropriate method to 
be used with any particular piece of fiction that is being read 
will doubtless be correctly determined by the dominant purpose 
which we have in view. If merely the harmless enjoyment of 
leisure is our purpose, certain procedures may be appropriate ; 
if giving the pupils moral inspiration is our purpose, other

procedures may be used ; but if giving clear, vivid, usable ideas 
of social processes, problems, and relations is our purpose, we 
can probably safely use some of the various devices for arousing 
interest, giving vivid experiences, and stimulating attentive re- 
flection which we summarized and interpreted in Section IV of 
this chapter. 
C. Devices for Social Insight through Arithmetic 
Illustrated by example in chapter on arithmetical com- 
putation.—In the social topics of arithmetic, such as buying 
and selling, interest, 
banking, insurance, 
and various forms of 
practical  measure- 
ment, the school has 
an opportunity to in- 
troduce pupils to a 
study of many im- 
portant quantitative 
aspects of contem- 
porary life. In our 
chapter on arithmet- 
ical computation, we ELECTRIC BELL MADE BY A SEVENTH-GRADE

school supplies in 
order to clarify the pupils’ ideas of the arithmetical aspects of

cedure to be followed in appealing to pupils’ instincts, giving 
them vivid personal experiences and requiring them to reflect 
upon these in order to secure an understanding of important 
social relations and processes.     Courtesy of E. R. Downing

D. Attaining Social Insight through Applied Science 
Illustrated by lessons on machines.—The possibilities of 
enriching the pupil’s comprehension of social life through the 
study of applied science may be illustrated by an outline of 
some upper-grade lessons upon certain machines that have 
played an important part in industrial life and, consequently, 
in human progress. Such machines include the lever, the wind- 
lass and derrick, the pulley, and the steam engine. The exam- 
ples given in the outline suggest the numerous uses of these in 
daily life. In some cases the devices used in The University 
of Chicago Elementary School for familiarizing pupils with 
each machine are also indicated in the outline. 
Study of simple machines : 
1. The teeter-totter, or seesaw [or lever] : 
a. With sticks, fulcrums, and weights the pupils solve simple 
problems and learn the relations between the lengths of the 
parts of the seesaw on each side of the fulcrum, on the one 
hand, and the weights, on the other. 
By using the same stick as a crowbar the power necessary to 
pry up, or lift, a given weight is easily solved. Such topics 
as this are correlated with mathematics. 
6. The following machines are studied and classified: scissors, 
balance scale, pincers, pump handle, wheelbarrow, nut- 
cracker. 
c. Pupils make balance scales of blocks, sticks, and cardboard, 
and weigh things and study [the] principle. 
2. Other machines : 
a. Another type of machine, represented by the windlass and 
water bucket, is demonstrated, and the relation between 
the weight of the bucket of water and the muscular power 
necessary to draw it up is studied. 
b. The principle of the derrick is illustrated in the same way. 
Practical mathematical problems are solved. 
Applications of this type of machine: drawing well water; 
railroad hand cars; capstan or windlass on ships; moving 
buildings by horse power; etc.
-P-A-G-E-267
    
UNDERSTANDING SOCIAL LIFE 251 
3. The skid, or plank, used by teamsters in loading wagons : 
a. Groups of pupils demonstrate by using a board three or four 
feet long. If this is inclined and a toy cart is loaded and 
rolled up or pulled up by spring balance, the relation be- 
tween the length and height of the skid, the weight of the 
load, and the power needed to push it up are learned. 
Applications: loading wagons and cars; coal and ore cars 
pulled out of mines; wagons drawn up hills; gang planks in 
loading steamers; etc. 
4. The pulley—another type of machine: 
a. Pupils in groups experiment with pulleys and learn the ad- 
vantages and disadvantages of each kind, or combination 
of kinds. 
Problems are given to solve with pulleys, involving the 
principles learned. 
Applications: hoisting heavy objects; raising sails on ships; 
moving buildings; clotheslines; derricks; dredges; wreck- 
ingtrains; etc. 
5. Steam engines : 
a. Teacher demonstrates the power of a small amount of steam 
by boiling a little water in a corked test tube. 
6. Steam power applied to running an engine. A toy engine is 
run to demonstrate its working, and pupils draw it and 
learn its parts and principles. 
6. Discussion of machines: advantages and disadvantages ;_ types 
which sacrifice power in exchange for speed, or vice versa; 
etc. (3c: 581-582) 
Conclusion of devices and methods in various school sub- 
jects.—This brings us to the end of the three long sections in 
which we centered our attention on the devices to be used in 
teaching community life, history, geography, fiction, arithmetic, 
and applied science so as to give pupils sympathetic insight 
into contemporary civilization. In evaluating these devices, we 
explained at length in Section IV how their success depends 
upon appealing to the pupil’s instinctive interests, giving him 
vivid personal experiences and requiring him to reflect upon 
these experiences in order to arrive at ideas that are clear, vivid,
-P-A-G-E-268
  252 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
organized, usable, recallable, mobile, and modifiable. We have 
still before us in the chapter another important psychological 
problem; namely, to determine the nature of sympathetic in- 
sight into social life, in order that we may know when we have 
succeeded in cultivating it in pupils. 
Section VI. Wuart 1s SYMPATHETIC INSIGHT 
INTO CONTEMPORARY CIVILIZATION 
Four factors. (1) Type examples, (2) systematized knowl- 
edge, (3) feelings of meaning, (4) attitudes.—The foregoing 
concrete sections of the chapter have given us background for 
the consideration of the question propounded in this section ; 
namely, What is sympathetic insight into contemporary civiliza- 
tion? Thus Section I gave us a cross-section view of contem- 
porary life as exemplified in the contents of a weekly review of 
the world; Section II showed us how the topics of this review 
are found in certain common subjects in elementary schools, 
such as community life, history, geography, fiction, arithmetic, 
and applied science; while the remaining sections gave us a 
notion of the devices used in teaching these subjects and a 
partial psychological justification for the activities required of 
the pupils in progressive elementary schools. In securing further 
psychological reasons for these methods we shall consider the 
following problems relative to the nature of sympathetic insight : 
1. How effective are type examples in developing social 
insight ? 
2. How much of this insight consists of clear-cut systematized 
knowledge, information, or definitions ? 
3. How much consists of mere “feelings of meaning”? 
4. What part do attitudes play, particularly in view of our 
use of the word “sympathetic” ? 
1. Value of type examples.—Several illustrations of the use 
of type examples occurred in the foregoing pages. For instance 
(on pages 208-209), we described the value of the study of
-P-A-G-E-269
  UNDERSTANDING SOCIAL LIFE 253 
Lincoln’s life as typifying certain aspects of the war between 
the North and the South, and called attention to the tendency 
of even adult minds to use the lives of great leaders as a means 
of grasping, symbolizing, and remembering great social develop- 
ments. Again (on page 190), we indicated that the types of 
primitive life chosen for the primary course of study should be

CHILDREN RAISING PLANTS IN A HOTBED 
Illustrates giving insight into an important modern method of providing flowers 
and food for city markets 
such that the ideas derived from them might be widely used by 
the children in interpreting other social situations. We found 
shepherd life and Scandinavian sea life to be strategic types for 
this purpose. Finally, in my own writing I have frequently 
developed a topic around type examples, such as the type 
lessons on the British Isles described in the geographic section 
of this chapter. 
Illustrated by Jesus’ teaching through parables.—The justi- 
fication for such teaching by types is found in the fact that 
most human beings do much of their interpretation and evalua- 
tion in terms of impressions which they have gathered from a few 
 
-P-A-G-E-270
  254. TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
impressive examples. Jesus, who is often described as a great 
teacher, took advantage of this mental tendency when he taught 
through parables. His simple type stories, such as his parable 
of the wheat and the tares, or the one concerning the house 
built on the sand versus the house on the rock, have been used 
by his followers for two thousand years to inipress truths of 
human nature and social life upon young and old. 
Strong contrast adds to effectiveness of types.—In many of 
these parables we find the use of contrasting types to bring out 
the essential lesson which is to be taught. The value of such 
use of contrast has long been emphasized by psychologists and 
rhetoricians. In our course of study on community life and 
history we found frequent examples of the contrasting of type 
examples to bring out the peculiar points of each. Thus we had 
the strong contrast between Arab civilization and Viking civ- 
ilization ; between Romans and Teutons ; between the British 
sympathies and the colonial sympathies in the American Revo- 
lutionary War; between primitive Chicago and the metropoli- 
tan Chicago of today. 
Choose clear, vivid types of significant aspects of civilization. 
—Thus from the foregoing paragraphs we derive an answer to 
our first question ; namely, How effective are type examples in 
determining social insight and attitudes? We find that our 
judgments and interpretations of human life and civilization 
are very frequently formulated in terms of single examples. As 
teachers it behooves us to choose examples that clearly, vividly, 
and truly typify great human events or important characteris- 
tics of civilization. By presenting strongly contrasting types 
we shall add even greater effectiveness to the impressions we 
desire to convey to pupils. 
2. Systematized knowledge. Skeletonized outlines of the 
main facts and principles of civilized development.—The sec- 
ond feature of sympathetic insight into contemporary civili- 
zation which we would emphasize is the need of giving the 
pupil systematized knowledge concerning the most important
-P-A-G-E-271
  UNDERSTANDING SOCIAL LIFE 255 
problems and aspects of contemporary life. As yet we have. 
not adequate data to prove just what these most important 
problems and aspects are, but scientific educators are at work 
determining them. As examples, however, we may feel safe in 
using the following: (1) Every American and Americanized 
foreigner should know the fundamental stages and character- 
istics in the development of Anglo-Saxon democratic govern- 
ment—the most valuable factor in the world’s governments 
of today. This knowledge should include familiarity with the 
causes, developments, and consequences connected with such 
strategic events as the signing of Magna Charta; the Common- 
wealth of Cromwell’s time; the English revolution of 1688 and 
the writings of John Locke concerning it ; the development of the 
power of Parliament during the eighteenth century; the weak- 
ening of this power through the intrigues of George III; the 
inheritance of English democratizing traditions by the Amer- 
ican colonists; the violations of these traditions by the govern- 
ment of George III; the natural revolt of the colonies; the 
existence of a strong English sentiment favorable to the colo- 
nists; the winning of American independence; the long period 
of American experimentation in developing a strong central 
government, culminating in the Civil War; the development 
of effective machinery for administering democratic govern- 
ment, as described in Viscount Bryce’s recent and remarkable 
book entitled ‘Modern Democracies”; and the extension of 
the ideals of Anglo-Saxon democratic government to France, 
Italy, the present British colonies, China, etc. (2) Every 
citizen of the world today should understand the ownership 
of private property and the part it plays in human progress 
and civilization. The principal facts to be systematized and 
learned in this connection are more difficult to specify than 
in the case of Anglo-Saxon democratic government. They 
would include, perhaps, knowledge of the instinct of owner- 
ship as one of the strongest of human characteristics; the 
history of the private ownership of land in some countries
-P-A-G-E-272
    256 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
‘where this has had a notable influence, as in France; the his- 
tory of the failures of communistic enterprises that have tended 
to abolish private ownership; the part played by government 
agencies in protecting the property rights of the weak against 
the aggressions of the strong; etc. It takes little knowledge 
of the troubles which afflicted the world following 1914 to 
make us realize that systematic knowledge and understanding 
of these two phases of contemporary life (namely, Anglo- 
Saxon democratic government and the institution of private 
property) are important factors in securing a sympathetic 
insight into contemporary civilization. Within a few years we 
may hope to have, from the scientific investigations of the con- 
tents of contemporary newspapers and magazines, a valid out- 
line of the most essential facts that every intelligent pupil 
should systematically master in order to understand the prin- 
cipal aspects of contemporary civilization. 
3. Feelings of meaning.—Our next problem in determining 
what constitutes sympathetic insight into contemporary civili- 
zation may be introduced by a quotation from William James, 
our greatest American psychologist. The quotation follows his 
report of some experiments upon memorizing which showed 
that although the learners had apparently forgotten a memo- 
rized poem after the lapse of some time, the fact that they re- 
learned it more easily proved that some considerable effect of 
the first learning had persisted. Hence, says James: 
[These] experiments show that things which we are quite unable 
definitely to recall have nevertheless impressed themselves, in some 
way, upon the structure of the mind. We are different for having 
once learned them. The resistances in our systems of brain-paths are 
altered. Our apprehensions are quickened. Our conclusions from cer- 
tain premises are probably not just what they would be if those 
modifications were not there: . . . 
The teacher should draw a lesson from these facts. We are all 
too apt to measure the gains of our pupils by their proficiency in 
directly reproducing in a recitation or an examination such matters 
as they may have learned; and inarticulate power in them is some-
-P-A-G-E-273
  
UNDERSTANDING SOCIAL LIFE 257 
thing of which we always underestimate the value. The boy who 
tells us “I know the answer, but I can’t say what it is” we treat 
as practically identical with him who knows absolutely nothing [at 
all] about the answer. . . . But this is a great mistake. It is but a 
small part of our experience in life that we are ever able articulately 
to recall. And yet the whole of it has had its influence in shaping our 
character and defining our tendencies to judge and act. Although the 
ready memory is a great blessing to its possessor, the vaguer memory 
of a subject, of having once had to do with it, of its neighborhood and 
of where we may go to recover it again, constitutes in most men and 
women the chief fruit of their education. 
Be patient, then, and sympathetic with the type of mind that cuts 
a poor figure in examinations. It may, in the long examination which 
life sets us, come out in the end in better shape than the glib and 
ready reproducer, its passions being deeper, its purposes more worthy, 
its combining power less commonplace, and its total mental output 
consequently more important. (21: 141-143) 
This quotation brings out clearly for us the distinction be- 
tween two styles of mental products—the one consisting of 
clear-cut, well-remembered information and definitions; the 
other consisting of much vaguer, intangible outcomes, which 
James has called, in another place, feelings of meaning. Our 
problem is to determine the place of each of these sorts of 
mental products in giving a pupil sympathetic insight into 
contemporary civilization. 
Precise information needed for technical decisions ; feelings 
of meaning frequently adequate for appreciations —The value of 
precise information can readily be demonstrated in many phases 
of social life. For example, in matters of health it is absolutely im- 
portant to know that typhoid fever is usually contracted from 
drinking polluted water and that boiling the drinking-water or 
keeping the original supply free from polluted drainage is an 
effective preventive. On the other hand, in the same field of 
bacteriology and health it is easy to demonstrate the importance 
of the more intangible mental products, such as one’s general 
impression that some bacteria are harmful and some are help-
-P-A-G-E-274
  
258 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
ful, or one’s general attitude toward cleanliness, which makes 
one like to have people wash their hands before coming to meals 
or makes one dislike eating in a dirty restaurant. In a thorough 
psychological discussion of our problem it would be necessary 
to determine rather precisely what part of our knowledge should 
consist of exact information and definitions and what part of 
general feelings of meaning. Obviously both play important 
réles. For our present purposes we may lay down these prin- 
ciples: (1) In technical studies and in technical behavior, such 
as medical practice, legal practice, bridge-building, voting, leg- 
islating, investing, teaching, etc., we need many precise items 
of information, technical definitions, etc. (2) In the general 
appreciation of contemporary civilization the more intangible 
feelings of meaning, attitudes, etc. are frequently sufficient. 
(3) However, when called upon to decide or think clearly 
in a social crisis, such as that presented by an epidemic of 
disease or an economic catastrophe like that in Russia following 
the World War, we should refine our knowledge to the point of 
technical precision in order to reach a true and safe judgment. 
4. Value of attitudes, particularly “sympathetic insight.” 
—Our final question in determining the psychological nature of 
sympathetic insight into contemporary civilization concerns the 
part played by attitudes, particularly sympathetic attitudes. 
Professor Bobbitt has effectively illustrated this problem in con- 
nection with conflicts between one nation and another or conflicts 
between capital and labor. How can you get a sympathetic view 
of each side in such a controversy? Bobbitt says you can’t do it 
by simply “sitting on the fence and disinterestedly observing 
both,” but you must plunge in, imaginatively, “first on one side 
and then on the other, and learn each side by experiencing it. 
When one relives the fight, he has to be on one side or the other. 
If he is neutral, then he is not reliving the fight. He is an idle 
bystander.” Bobbitt proceeds to illustrate his point by examples 
from our American wars and our national economic struggle for 
world markets, as brought out in the following quotations :
-P-A-G-E-275
UNDERSTANDING SOCIAL LIFE 259 
Let students relive the experiences of the Revolutionary War as 
accurately presented from the British point of view; imaginatively 
traveling and associating with the British armies and unconsciously 
taking on its valuations and aspirations and seeing everything from 
its side. This was just as much a part of the actual experience of 
the times. Let the student read the history of the Mexican War as 
a shadow-member of the army of Santa Ana, and thus see the war 
through Mexican eyes. This is just as true a view of it as the one 
from the American side. 
Let the program of conflict, however, be no narrow one of military 
wars alone. Let there be far fuller experience on the part of youth 
in the nation’s economic struggle for the world’s markets. This is 
going on at the present time. It has been going on these hundred 
years or more. Let youth read a spirited history of our American 
merchant marine; of the contest we have made in the markets of 
South America, China, Russia, Australia, the Philippines, etc. ; and of 
our struggles to keep our home markets for our home producers as 
against foreign competition. Let the present aspects of this economic 
struggle be made to stand out clearly, giving full space to the last 
decade or two. . . . [Again, in order] to prevent distorted social per- 
spective, [let the pupil] read also vivid accounts of British commerce 
from [the British] point of view; of French commerce from [the 
French] angle of vision; of Japanese commerce; etc. (20: 137-138) 
Imitative and imaginative behavior influence our attitudes — 
These examples, in themselves, are sufficient to prove that atti- 
tudes are very central factors in determining a pupil’s sympa- 
thetic insight into civilization. As Bobbitt points out, these 
attitudes are fundamentally influenced by our active experi- 
ences in participating, either actually or imaginatively, in the 
social situations to be studied. In this fact we find special jus- 
tification for the varied forms of imitative behavior and ex- 
pression which we found pupils experiencing (as described on 
pages 224-232) and which stimulate them to reproduce in 
miniature or in imagination the dramatic and problematic 
aspects of life among historic or remote peoples. 
Conclusion of section on the psychology of social insight.

tematized knowledge; (3) feelings of meaning ; and (4) mental 
attitudes—all playing important rdles in developing sympa- 
thetic insight into contemporary civilization. 
Conclusion of the chapter.—The reader may now breathe 
a sigh of relief that he has reached the conclusion of this seem- 
ingly endless chapter. Your relief, however, is no greater than 
that of the author, who started to write it one winter; found 
himself so tangled up by the time it was half finished that he 
had to desist ; pondered it for another year ; and finally, the next 
winter, spent ten days in completing it. Now, with only the 
“main points” and the bibliographical notes to be written, I 
wonder what the effect upon the reader will be. Is there any 
chance that the subtitle “Acquiring sympathetic insight into 
contemporary civilization” may become one of your “favorite 
pedagogical possessions,” as I suggested in the opening para- 
graph? Or shall you proceed to forget the whole matter, retain- 
ing only the vague feelings of ennui that the chapter may have 
fostered? Or, by chance, do you want an airplane view of the 
whole thing, to clear away the tangle of detail? If you do, read 
the “main points,” which I shall now proceed to write and 
which you will find at the beginning of the chapter.

CHAPTER X 
PROBLEM-SOLVING, OR PRACTICE IN THINKING 
Main points of the chapter.—1. A problem is a question involv- 
ing doubt, as in Hamlet’s “To be or not to be.” 
2. Both large and small problems abound in daily life and should 
be provided in school. 
3. Both practical and speculative problem-solving are enjoyed and 
practiced by children and adults. 
4. Illustrations of the great variety of problems in life are sug- 
gested by the following types: constructive, transportational, diplo- 
matic, moral, expressional, artistic, mathematical. 
5. Problems arise from something puzzling, perplexing, strange, 
unexpected, or disconcerting. 
6. When a pupil’s mind is challenged by such a situation he has 
a genuine problem. 
7. Both presented problems and discovered problems abound in 
everyday life and are appropriate in training pupils. 7 
8. Both conclusive and inconclusive solutions of problems occur 
in everyday life and should be provided for in school. 
g. Sometimes everyday problems are solved by an individual work- 
ing alone, but many are solved by problem-solving group discussions. 
to. Pupils should be trained to solve problems reflectively instead 
of impulsively. 
11. In school, examples of such reflective problem-solving occur in 
the following lessons : 
a. Determining, in a seventh grade, whether the United States 
should produce enough sugar to meet its own needs. 
b. Constructing, in the kindergarten, the front for a cardboard 
store. 
c. Planning, in a second grade, the costumes for some Arab dolls. 
d. Deciding, in a fifth grade, why London Bridge was so located, 
and where the docks, factories, and residences would tend to be 
developed.

12. In discovering the answers to problems even the greatest 
thinkers make many erroneous guesses, but are skilled in devising 
means of testing these. Such thinkers are quite willing to give up 
erroneous ideas and to suspend judgment until adequate evidence or 
proof is secured. 
13. In conducting problem-solving lessons so as to train pupils to 
be skilled problem-solvers, the teacher should aid the pupils 
a. Clearly to define the problem. 
6. To keep it in mind at all times, thus avoiding being side- 
tracked. 
c. To make many relevant suggestions. 
d. To evaluate all suggestions critically. 
e. To keep the thinking systematically organized. 
The second “thoughtful process” of Part II.—This chap- 
ter, on problem-solving, is concerned with the second of the 
“four thoughtful processes” to be discussed in Part II of the 
book. The first of these processes—namely, “understanding 
social life”—-was discussed at great length in the preceding 
chapter. In the account which we gave there of the rich intel- 
lectual life that a progressive elementary school affords, we had 
frequent occasion to indicate how problem-solving activities of 
the pupils are utilized as a means of clarifying and organizing 
their ideas of contemporary civilization. Such problem-solving 
activities furnish the special topic for discussion in the present 
chapter. 
Definite technique established.—During the past twenty- 
five years a definite technique of giving to pupils practice in 
problem-solving, or thinking, has been developed in progressive 
American elementary schools. It is the chief purpose of this chap- 
ter to acquaint more teachers with this technique, so that any 
skilled teacher who is a good thinker may give pupils practice in 
problem-solving and make them aware of the elements of skill in 
effective thinking. In order to show the importance and validity 
of the practices to be described we shall discuss also the place 
of problem-solving in everyday life and the ways in which 
skilled problem-solvers think.
-P-A-G-E-281
  
  PROBLEM-SOLVING 265 
Sections of the discussion.— We shall divide our discussion 
into four main sections, with certain subdivisions, as follows: 
I. Problems of everyday life (p. 265). 
II. Actual lessons illustrating problem-solving in school (p. 279): 
A, Seventh grade: Should the United States produce its own 
sugar? (P. 279.) 
B. Kindergarten problem: How to make the front of a card- 
board store (p. 286). 
C. Second grade: How to dress an Arab doll (p. 293). 
D. Fifth grade: Standardized short geography problems on the 
British Isles (p. 300). 
III. How skillful problem-solvers think (p. 307). 
IV. Rules for training pupils in reflective problem-solving (p. 314). 
Section I. PropireMs oF EverypAy LIFE 
Definition. A problem is a question involving doubt. “To 
be or not to be.” —For our purposes a problem may be defined as 
“a question involving doubt.” From this point of view the prob- 
lem frame of mind is well depicted in Hamlet’s famous lines be- 
ginning, “To be or not to be, that is the question.” Whenever we 
thoughtfully search for means of dealing with any such doubt or 
perplexity ‘or uncertainty or difficulty, we are engaged in reflec- 
tive problem-solving. The problem may arise from some prac- 
tical difficulty or from mere curious wondering about some 
unexplained or unusual fact. Such a practical problem as “Where 
shall I spend my vacation?” often causes the most profound 
thinking and inquiry. Similar investigation is often entailed in 
deciding whether to go to college or to enter business. After one 
has decided upon a certain resort for his vacation or a certain 
school for his education, the clothes problem or baggage problem 
may become crucial. One may say to oneself, “To take a suit- 
case or a trunk, that is now the question.” If a suitcase is decided 
upon, the problems may become very minute, such as, “To take 
this sweater or not, that is the question.” 
1 This definition is based on Webster’s International Dictionary.
-P-A-G-E-282
266 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
Large and small problems. From large policies to minute 
issues.—Thus we see that the practical problems of life may 
vary from momentous decisions, such as deciding upon a college 
education, down to such minute matters as pondering whether to 
take or leave a certain garment. In the larger responsible posi- 
tions of life we find the same contrast between large and small 
problems. For example, a business executive has large matters 
of policy to determine, such as how to increase his business, or 
how to keep his salesmen full of “pep” and to make them skill- 
ful in selling, etc. On the other hand, in his correspondence he 
solves scores of small problems each day, many of which involve 
merely a moment’s glance at a letter and a half-minute dicta- 
tion of the answer. In the life of a school superintendent or 
principal or dean the same extremes occur. For example, at one 
time when I was “‘deaning” I had the following /arge problems: 
(1) “How to discover a talented young man to become my suc- 
cessor as dean.” To solve this required three years of explora- 
tion. (2) ‘How to improve the annual catalogue so that it could 
be more easily read by entering students.” This required occa- 
sional editorial pondering during four years. (3) ‘How to re- 
construct certain rooms so as to provide more offices for an 
increasing faculty.” Securing satisfactory plans for remodeling 
two particular rooms took several months of occasional planning. 
At the opposite extreme were the small, short problems of advis- 
ing students who were registering. On registration days from 
twenty-five to forty students were advised. Each case usually 
took from one to ten minutes and was determined in the light of 
such questions as: (1) What is the student planning to do in 
life? (2) What are her special talents? (3) What has been 
her previous training? (4) What required courses does she 
have to take? (5) What courses are offered that will meet her 
needs? (6) How can conflicts of hours be avoided ? 
Need of training in both short problem-solving and prolonged, 
patient thinking.—The relative proportion of large and small 
problems in life will influence our plans for organizing opportu- 
 
-P-A-G-E-283
  PROBLEM-SOLVING 267 
nities for problem-solving in school. It is my impression that the 
small, short problems play such a prominent part in the daily 
life of most persons that we are justified in organizing in school 
thousands of such problems, each of which may consume only 
from one to ten minutes in its solution. At the same time we 
should provide for solution large problems which may puzzle the 
student for one hour or many hours, and thus train them to do 
the prolonged, patient thinking that is required in the larger, 
longer problems of later life. 
Practical versus speculative problems. “The Lady or the 
Tiger.” —Up to this point our examples of problems have all 
been of a practical nature in the sense that they have related to 
practical plans or actions, usually of the person who was solving 
them. It is important to realize, however, that much problem- 
solving thinking in daily life is concerned with purely theo- 
retical, or speculative, questions, the answers to which are not 
needed by the thinker in order to determine some important line 
of practical activity. To take an extreme example, some years 
ago Frank Stockton, the well-known writer, published a puzzling 
story called ‘The Lady or the Tiger?” This story tells of a low- 
born hero who dares to woo a princess. The king opposes the 
match and casts the hero into the arena, where he must choose 
between two doors. If he opens one a tiger will come out and 
devour him ; if he chooses the other a woman will appear whom 
he must then marry. The princess, in the balcony, knows the 
secret of the doors. She gives her hero lover a sign, and he opens 
one of them. The story ends with the question Which comes 
out—the lady or the tiger ? 
Girls puzzle over princess’s choice.—When this unexpected 
puzzling ending to the story appeared, the country became 
involved in a turmoil of discussion in an effort to solve the 
problem. I watched a class of high-school freshmen recently 
discussing it. One girl said she had read every line about the 
princess eleven times in an effort to determine which door the 
princess’s love and jealousy would lead her to indicate.
-P-A-G-E-284
  
268 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
Playful speculation abounds in politics, religion, and science. 
—Other examples of such unresponsible problem-solving occur 
in politics, religion, and science. The chief mental recreation of 
many persons consists in puzzling over the political issues of the 
day— issues that are often so remote that the thinkers have ab- 
solutely no possibility of modifying matters in a practical way. 
Arguments about the Bible are often of a similar unpractical 
character. Finally, in the realm of science we find all types of 
inquiring persons, from the young boy who puzzles over polly- 
wogs and electric bells and flying machines up to the advanced 
astronomer who tries to locate a new comet or planet—all con- 
cerned merely with “Why does it do that ? or How does the 
thing work ? or Where is the planet that explains these gaps 
in our calculations ?” 
Playful puzzling may train for practical problem-solving.— 
Often such playful puzzling proves of value to the problem-solver 
and to society. For example, the adolescent girls who puzzled 
about love and jealousy as exemplified in Stockton’s princess 
were probably acquiring knowledge and skill in judging some of 
the most crucial issues of life—issues to which we find our 
greatest novelists and dramatists devoting their best talents. 
Similarly, the inquiring reader who ponders with interest politi- 
cal issues that do not concern him in a practical way is acquiring 
knowledge and skill which may help him in arriving at sound 
decisions upon political issues in which he does have a voice. 
The way in which playful, theoretical, or speculative problem- 
solving thus prepares for practical problem-solving is merely 
one example of the way in which play in general trains for seri- 
ous activities. Dogs play at running, catching, biting, and fight- 
ing and are thus prepared for the real fighting and hunting of life. 
Men, women, and children play at puzzling out all kinds of inter- 
esting problems,and may thus be trained and kept in condition to 
cope with more serious problem-solving when this is required. 
Project problems involve practical devising, contriving, 
scheming.—The term “project” is.commonly used in every-

PROBLEM-SOLVING ° f. (2003 
day life to designate practical problems which require much 
consideration, scheming, or planning to reach a solution; that 
is, to determine what to do and how to do it. Thus, at present 
writing, a commission from the United States and Canada is ac- 
tively working upon the project of providing a means for large 
ocean vessels to reach the Great Lakes via the St. Lawrence

River. This example illustrates the dictionary statements that 
a project is “something of a practical nature thrown out for 
the consideration of its being done,” and that to project 
means “to contrive, to devise, to scheme.” In recent years 
special efforts have been made to parallel in school this kind 
of everyday practical problem-solving. Hence pupils are now 
given practice with construction projects, dramatic projects, 
assembly projects, editorial projects, and other projects similar 
to those of everyday life. In this book, whenever we refer to 
pupils’ projects we have in mind some such practical pupil
-P-A-G-E-286
  270 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
activity which calls for practical contriving, devising, and schem- 
ing, as distinguished from the mere speculation which prevails 
in solving purely theoretical problems. Examples of such pupil 
projects are pictured in the frontispiece and on pages 186, 195, 
and 201, while detailed descriptions of pupils at work planning 
typical projects are given on pages 9, 288 ff. 
Great variety of problems in social life. Mechanical, diplo- 
matic, moral, expressional, esthetic, scientific, and mathemati- 
cal_—The examples discussed above have given us some notion 
of the varieties of problems found in everyday life. In order to 
extend our impressions of the many types of problems that exist 
we may note the following partial classification of them: 
1. Mechanical-construction problems; that is, problems of 
how to make something. These may vary from the small but 
very puzzling problem of how to “make over” an old garment 
up to such a complex scientific problem as how to make a flying 
machine—a problem that puzzled the world for centuries. Many 
construction problems are now provided in elementary schools. 
1Avoid confusing project teaching and motivation—The description 
which we have given of project teaching will help the reader to avoid con- 
fusing the term with the educational concept of motivation. The central 
idea in the recent discussions of motivation seems to be that a pupil 
secures valuable training through clearly conceiving some interesting end 
toward which he directs his present activity and from which the latter 
derives interest. The writers on motivation have emphasized the desir- 
ability of well-defined pupil purposes and whole-hearted interests as 
educative factors. Motivation thus becomes one phase of the doctrine 
of interest, and its adequate discussion would require a consideration of 
human instincts and motives, as found in such chapters as those by James 
and Thorndike on human instincts and in such books as McDougall’s 
“Social Psychology.” It is clear from these facts that motivation is quite 
a different concept from project teaching, in which the central element is 
the contriving, devising, and planning by the pupils of some practical ac- 
tivity—something to be done. (For a full discussion of project teaching 
from this point of view, see the author’s articles in the Elementary 
School Journal for January and February, 1922, Vol. XXII, reprinted 
and sold separately by the Department of Education of The University 
of Chicago for 25 cents.)
-P-A-G-E-287
  
PROBLEM-SOLVING 271 
It is important to notice that in the present chapter we are 
interested in the thoughtful planning and designing that. enter 
into the solution of such problems, rather than in the actual 
mechanical construction. 
2. Transportation problems ; that is, problems of how to take 
or send something to some place. These may vary from the 
simple personal problem of how to get a parcel to a friend around 
the corner up to the enormous transportation problems that con- 
fronted the Allies during the World War. Such problems occur * 
in all kinds of situations. For example, in department stores 
there is the problem of transporting the money from the sales- 
men to the cashiers. In large libraries enormous problems of 
human energy and convenience are involved in the stacking 
and arranging of books so as to render their transportation to 
readers swift and economical. In the courses in history, civics, 
geography, and science, problems of transportation are being 
pondered more and more in progressive schools. 
3. Problems of personal relations, reactions, and influences ; 
for example, ‘Would Stockton’s princess prefer to see her lover 
devoured by the tiger or to see him become the husband of 
another woman?” In daily life we are constantly pondering such 
human-nature problems. Often they are of a diplomatic charac- 
ter; for example, how to influence our relatives, friends, and 
associates. Recently I pondered for two days how to present a 
business proposition to a certain man. At first I decided to write 
an outline of it, lay it before him, and explain it. On my way to 
see him, however, I decided that he so disliked listening to others 
that the only thing to do was to let him talk and then gradually 
to insinuate my own proposals piecemeal, as occasion offered, 
during his conversation. This proved successful. In all the so- 
cial studies—history, civics, biography, literature, etc_—per- 
sonal relations, reactions, and influences appear which offer 
opportunities for problematic discussions that train pupils in 
solving such human-nature problems when they are encountered 
in daily life. 
 
-P-A-G-E-288
272. TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
4. Problems of social organization, such as ‘How shall we 
organize our literary society?” or “Which is better, for the 
government to own and operate the railroads or merely to control 
and supervise their operation?” From the simple organization of 
domestic activities up to such international organizations as the 
League of Nations we find thousands of problems under this 
heading. In the social studies, when these are properly taught, 
pupils are given training in planning, suggesting, criticizing, and 
evaluating solutions of such problems. 
5. Moral problems, such as “‘Is it right for me to accept an edu- 
cation and services from my parents without making any imme- 
diate return in the form of home service?” Literature, biography, 
history, civics, and school activities are full of moral problems 
which especially competent teachers have pupils ponder and solve 
with benefit to their future powers of moral discrimination. 
6. Expressional problems; for example, “What is the best 
way to word my refusal of this invitation?” or ‘How shall I 
write this chapter?” In planning to write the present chapter 
I pondered for weeks whether to open it with this section, 
on problems of daily life, or to open with actual lessons illus- 
trating problem-solving in school. I finally decided to place 
the lessons as the second section, but I am not sure that this is 
the best order. Thus expressional problems vary from the simple 
choice of a word to the large outlining and planning of a book 
or to outlining a whole series of addresses. Training in expres- 
sion in school thus offers one of the best opportunities for train- 
ing in problem-solving. 
7. Artistic problems; for example, “What is the most pleas- 
ing arrangement of the pictures in this room?” or “What is the 
most pleasing way of massing the shrubbery in this park?” or 
“What is the most pleasing color scheme for this window dis- 
play ?” In the art courses reflective thought about such problems 
is now encouraged in many schools. 
8. Pure-science problems; for example, ‘Why does the mist 
hang in clouds a short distance up the mountain, but disappear

lower down ?” or “Is the interior of the earth a molten mass or 
is it rigid and solid?” We are all familiar with such problems 
from our high-school science courses. In the grades, instruction 
in geography and science is being improved so as to offer increas- 
ing opportunities for pupils to puzzle out answers to scientific 
problems instead of 
merely learning scien- 
tific facts. 
9. Purely mathe- 
matical problems; for 
example, ‘How do I 
calculate the amount 
of income tax that 
I have to pay?” or 
“What is the best 
way of auditing the 
report of the treas- 
urer of our society 
in order to verify his 
accounts ?”. Notonly 
in arithmetic but also

progressive schools 
are being trained to puzzle out problems of arranging quanti- 
tative data and determining quantitative relations in order to 
prepare for the mathematically precise scientific method of 
problem-solving which is playing an ever-increasing part in 
solving modern civic, philanthropic, and business problems. 
These examples suggest the large social value of training 
in problem-solving.—Several other types of problems could be 
described, but sufficient has probably been said to serve the 
purpose of this introductory section; namely, to give the reader 
a notion of the importance of the type of learning and training 
 
-P-A-G-E-290
  
274. TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
which we have under discussion. In discussions of handwriting 
and spelling it is possible to present the results of precise inves- 
tigations showing just what degrees of handwriting skill and 
what spelling words are important in everyday life. For problem- 
solving we do not possess similar precise information, but our 
examples probably serve to impress the reader with the fre- 
quency of problem-solving in daily life and with the consequent 
desirability of training pupils to be skillful problem-solvers. 
Origin of problems. In something puzzling, perplexing, con- 
fusing, disconcerting, unexpected, queer, strange, or odd.— 
Before proceeding to the discussion of sample lessons which il- 
lustrate the organization of such training it is desirable to get in 
mind the idea with which this section opened; namely, that a 
problem involves both a certain intellectual and a certain emo- 
tional mental condition in the thinker—a problem is a question 
involving doubt. Consequently, for our purposes a problem is 
not merely a topic, as it often appears to be in some courses of 
study, nor is it merely a question. It is a type of mental condi- 
tion in the pupil—a condition in which he is possessed of a 
question plus doubt. The more doubtful, uncertain, and per- 
plexed he is, the more intense is his problematic frame of mind. 
Creating such a state of mind in the pupils, consequently, is the 
starting-point of problem-solving activity. Several words to 
describe this initial frame of mind have been brought together 
by Professor John Dewey, our leading authority on reflective 
thinking, in his excellent book entitled “How We Think.” In 
one place (p. 12) he says, “The origin of thinking is in some 
perplexity, confusion, or doubt.” Again (on page 74) he speaks 
of “something unexpected, queer, strange, funny [that is, odd], 
or disconcerting” as furnishing the starting-point for reflective 
inquiry. Finally (on page 9), under the heading ‘““The Impor- 
tance of Uncertainty,” he speaks of a “genuine problem” as 
existing in “whatever—no matter how slight and common- 
place in character—perplexes and challenges the mind so that 
it makes belief at all uncertain.”
-P-A-G-E-291
  
  PROBLEM-SOLVING 275 
Genuine problem for pupil when mentally challenged by some- 
thing strange, perplexing, unexpected, or disconcerting. —From 
these terms we may derive a meaning for the rather ambiguous 
statement that has been current; namely, that the problem must 
be a problem for the pupil, not merely for the teacher. In terms 
of our discussion this means that the starting-point for the pupil 
must be something—no matter how slight or commonplace in 
character—that puzzles or perplexes him; something that ap- 
pears to him as unexpected, queer, strange, odd, or disconcerting. 
When his mind is challenged by such matters the pupil has a 
genuine problem. It may be practical or it may not. It may be 
merely something “funny” in the sense of being unexpected 
or strange ; in fact, much of our most intense problem-solving 
thinking by adults and children occurs in response to just such 
“funny,” unexplained phenomena. 
“Presented” problems and “discovered” problems.—Some- 
times problems are “presented” to a person in daily life, and at 
other times he seems to “discover” them. The common use of 
the expression “the problem then presented itself” suggests the 
frequency of the first type of appearance of a problem. Many 
mediocre thinkers never seem to feel a problem at all keenly 
unless it is vigorously “presented” to them by some obvious 
difficulty, such as missing a train or having no money to buy 
something to eat. They are perfectly complacent mentally ex- 
cept in the face of some such vital emergency. At the opposite 
extreme we find persons who are of such an inquiring frame of 
mind that they are continually poking around and turning up 
doubtful questions or problems in all kinds of unexpected places. 
“Presented” problems abound in practicalaffairs.—Inpractical 
affairs we meet frequent occasions both for solving “‘presented” 
problems and for “discovering” problems. For example, a 
business executive or manager is “presented” with a batch of 
problems every time he reads his mail or listens to questions from 
his subordinates or customers. A busy executive solves scores of 
problems a day which are presented to him in this manner. One
-P-A-G-E-292
  276 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
of the greatest elements of skill in executive work is the ability 
to decide rapidly many such problems as they are presented. 
Consequently, when we present pupils in school with many prob- 
lems which they did not originate but which they must solve 
rapidly, we are paralleling one of the most important types of 
problem-solving in practical life. 
Discovering problems illustrated by inquiring experts.—On 
the other hand, the discovering of problems is constantly illus- 
trated in practical affairs when an expert examines a situation 
with a view to improving it. For example, a friend of mine 
took over the management of a large business, and one of the 
first questions he asked was “When do you have your sales- 
men’s meetings ?” The old manager said they did not have any 
meetings and was surprised when my friend pointed out that this 
was a serious defect in the organization. It is becoming more 
and more common to employ consulting experts (for example, in 
making school surveys), who visit a situation and by prying here 
and there with their questions uncover many problems which the 
“home folks” never realized were there. The importance of 
organized training for this type of activity is stated by Judd 
when he says: 
Not merely the solution of problems suggested by one’s own ex- 
periences, then, constitutes the end and aim of school training, but 
the discovery of new problems is an important part of education. 
Youth is a period of learning to see problems as well as learning to 
solve problems. (12: 153) 
Modes of solving problems. Conclusive versus inconclusive 
solutions.—For some of the problems that are presented or dis- 
covered, perfectly conclusive solutions may be found, but for 
other problems the solutions that are finally accepted may still 
be very uncertain, doubtful, and inconclusive. An example of 
a problem with a rather conclusive solution is ‘How shall I 
calculate my income tax if I am a bachelor with no dependents 
and with only a salary of $1500 a year for income?” The direc-
-P-A-G-E-293
PROBLEM-SOLVING 277 
tions given on the income-tax blank for solving this problem are 
so definite that practically all competent persons would reach the 
same conclusion, or answer. Similarly, in solving the problem 
‘“How shall I fix this screen door, which sticks at the top?” there 
would probably be a conclusive, satisfactory answer that com- 
petent carpenters would agree upon. On the other hand, when 
we confront such a problem as “Whom shall we nominate as 
candidate for president of the United States?” we sometimes 
find the greatest uncertainty prevailing, even after the nomina- 
tion has been made. Citizens frequently feel that possibly a 
better choice could have been made, and sometimes months or 
years must elapse to prove whether the chosen candidate was a 
satisfactory one or not. Throughout our daily affairs we are con- 
fronted with problems calling for such uncertain and doubtful 
solutions; for example, “Shall I give money to this apparently 
helpless beggar or refer him to the office of the Associated 
Charities?” Such problems with uncertain solutions are so 
common in the field of personal relations, financial investment, 
artistic production, etc. that we need to give pupils frequent 
practice in school in dealing with them. 
Group discussions and individual solution.—Sometimes the 
problems which are presented or discovered are solved by an 
individual working alone, but frequently group discussion plays 
a very large part in the solution. Even where one individual does 
most of the thinking which attains the solution, he is often 
greatly aided by a few moments of discussion with someone else. 
In organized business and social life many of the crucial deci- 
sions, such as occur in undertaking new business ventures or 
passing new laws or trying cases in court, are reached only 
after many hours of problem-solving discussions by groups of 
persons. Hence, while it is important to train pupils in school 
in the solving of problems individually, it is equally impor- 
tant that they be given practice in problem-solving discus- 
sions in social groups so as to acquire skill in this important 
social art.  
-P-A-G-E-294
  
278 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
Reflective problem-solvers to be trained, not impulsive ones. 
—Finally, before turning to the sample lessons which will best 
illustrate how pupils are actually given practice in the art of 
problem-solving, we may note that we desire io produce reflec- 
tive problem-solvers, not impulsive ones. To reflect means to 
turn the matter over in the mind, to view it from various angles, 
to consider carefully the various possibilities of solution. To 
develop skill in securing the true solution of problems by such 
reflective study is the topic of this chapter. 
Summary of Section I.—In this section of the chapter 
we have been concerned with the problems of everyday life as 
brought out in the following summary: (1) Such problems vary 
from very large questions of policy to minute issues requiring 
only a moment’s thought for their solution. (2) Consequently 
in school we need many small problems as well as larger ones. 
(3) Both practical problem-solving and speculative problem- 
solving prevail in daily life. (4) Playful, speculative problem- 
solving, “just for fun,” is a very characteristic human activity 
and has large social value. (5) The great variety of problems 
found in daily life appears when we try to classify them as 
mechanical, diplomatic, moral, expressional, esthetic, scien- 
tific, mathematical, etc. (6) Consequently training in problem- 
solving may be provided in many subjects in the school. (7) In 
order to start problems for pupils we must know what a problem 
is psychologically and how it originates. (8) For our purposes 
a problem may be defined as a question involving doubt. 
(9) Problems originate in something puzzling, perplexing, con- 
fusing, disconcerting, unexpected, queer, strange, or “funny.” 
(10) When a pupil’s mind is challenged by something of this 
nature he has a genuine problem. (11) Both “presented” 
problems and “discovered” problems abound in our daily life. 
(12) Some problems have conclusive solutions, but many have 
inconclusive solutions. (13) Sometimes everyday problems are 
solved by an individual working alone, but many are solved by 
problem-solving group discussions. (14) Hence practice in the
-P-A-G-E-295
PROBLEM-SOLVING 279 
solution of group problems through group discussion trains 
pupils in a very useful social art. With this social setting of 
problem-solving in mind we shall turn our attention to a number 
of actual lessons which will illustrate how training in problem- 
solving has been organized by progressive teachers. 
Section II. ActuaL LESSONS ILLUSTRATING PROBLEM-

A. Seventh Grade: Should the United States produce its 
Own Sugar ? 
Illustrates results of preceding training in problem-solving. 
—tThe first lesson which we shall describe is taken from an 
upper-grade class in order to illustrate what large issues may be 
considered reflectively by pupils who are about to graduate from 
an elementary school in which training in problem-solving is 
provided from the kindergarten up. After presenting this upper- 
grade example we shall describe lessons from the kindergarten 
and the second and fifth grades, in order to illustrate the gradual 
progress in the pupils’ reflective abilities as they advance 
through the grades. All the lessons were taught in the Elemen- 
tary School of The University of Chicago, about 1919, but 
similar instruction may be found in hundreds of progressive 
schools throughout the country. The seventh-grade geography 
lesson which we shall present first was taught by Miss Edith 
Parker.* 
Relation to preceding lessons. Pupils reviewing various fac- 
tors in America’s progress.—The class was reviewing the geog- 
raphy of the United States, following a previous study of it in 
the fourth grade some years before. As the University Elemen- 
1To satisfy the curiosity of the reader I may say that Miss Parker and 
the author of this book are not related. Hence it is not inappropriate 
for me to remark that Miss Parker’s technique in conducting problem- 
solving lessons is a model of artistic teaching of this type. We shall de- 
scribe some of her fifth-grade geography lessons later in the chapter.

tary School at that time completed its work in seven years,’ the 
culmination of the geography training was so organized at the 
end of the seventh grade that it gave the pupils an opportunity 
to use their knowledge in considering certain large geographic 
problems of their native country.? As this class was studying 
the country in 1919, shortly after the close of the World War, 
they had been especially impressed with the marvelous achieve- 
ments of the United States and had become interested in the fol- 
lowing large question as the basis of the review: ‘“‘What are the 
factors that make the United States such a great nation?” In 
discussing the matter they had brought forward a number of 
geographic factors such as the location and size of the country, 
its varied topography and natural resources, the character and 
amount of immigration, etc. For a few days they had con- 
cerned themselves with ascertaining the relative achievements 
of the United States and other countries in crop production. 
They had studied the cotton and corn crops and had become 
enthusiastic over our production of these staples. They next 
turned their attention to sugar production, and it was at this 
stage that the lesson which I shall describe occurred. 
Pupils disconcerted by small sugar production. Problem 
keenly felt.—After some preliminary discussion Miss Parker 
raised the chief problem for the day by pointing to a graph which 
she had drawn on the blackboard. The pupils examined it and 
found that the United States had produced ina givenyear only one 
fifteenth of the world’s supply of sugar but had consumed one fifth. 
After their earlier findings of the enormous production of cotton 
and corn in America, and their general contention that a great

Junior High School.

ganizing a large problem in geography, see her paper entitled “The Par- 
tition of Africa—a Seventh-Grade Geography Unit,” Elementary School

  PROBLEM-SOLVING 281 
nation should try to be self-sufficient in its production of the 
necessities of life, many of the pupils were nonplused at this 
revelation of the sugar situation. Many of them were greatly 
disconcerted, perplexed, and puzzled by this unexpected shock 
to their strong national complacency. A psychological prob- 
lem situation had been skillfully and easily created by the 
teacher. The current shortage of sugar served to make the 
problem felt even more intensely. 
Problem clearly defined. Proposition to increase production 
written on the board.—The problem was then clearly presented 
for solution. “If we produce only one fifteenth and use one fifth 
of the world’s supply of sugar, what should we do about it?” 
Some pupils suggested that we use less; others, that we produce 
more. One pupil finally presented a clear proposition that we 
produce as much more sugar as possible in order to try to meet 
our domestic needs. Miss Parker deliberately wrote this on the 
board and then asked all the pupils to decide whether they 
agreed with it. They all gave their assent. 
Search for solution. Geographies consulted to determine the 
possibility of raising more.—The question then arose, Why, if 
this was advisable, had not the country done it before? In 
answering this question, attention became centered on the word 
“possible” in the proposition to produce more, and the teacher 
asked the pupils how they could find out whether it would be 
possible for us to produce more sugar. The pupils suggested 
looking up in their geographies the maps and other data show- 
ing the areas of possible sugar production and the conditions 
governing it. They decided to deal with cane sugar first. 
Pupils suggest conditions ; get data from maps ; decide greater 
production is possible.—In reply to Miss Parker’s question con- 
cerning the conditions which they would have to ascertain, the 
pupils replied “number of growing-days,” “suitable soil,” and 
“amount of rainfall.” She wrote these items on the board, as 
she had done with a number of other crucial points in the discus- 
sion. Following their suggestion to ascertain the number of 
 
-P-A-G-E-298
  282 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
growing-days needed, she directed the pupils to turn to their 
geographies and refer to a map of the United States with a line 
showing how far north sugar cane could be grown. They then 
compared this map with one showing actual cane production, 
and decided that as far as the number of growing-days was con- 
cerned much more cane could be raised. In like manner, they 
took up suitable soil conditions and rainfall and arrived at 
similar conclusions. 
Teacher verifies pupils’ conclusions by reference to a special 
treatise.—In order to verify their conclusions Miss Parker read 
from a special book on sugar a statement to the effect that thou- 
sands of acres in the country in which conditions were favorable 
for raising sugar cane were not being used for this purpose. 
Teacher holds the discussion to possibility before considering 
profit—aAs all these data were being produced and were 
gradually bringing out the possibility of easily producing more 
sugar in the United States, one boy kept suggesting that it might 
not be profitable to do so. Miss Parker made a memorandum of 
his suggestion on the board for later discussion, but suggested 
that they finish the investigations of the crop possibilities before 
they took up questions of profit, since the fundamental propo- 
sition to which they had all agreed and which was written on the 
board stated that more should be grown if possible. Some diffi- 
culty was experienced in getting the boy to give up his idea of 
considering profitableness before determining possibility. 
Pupil’s suggestion of lack of profit examined. Uncertainty 
about original proposition. However, after the possibility had 
been definitely proved Miss Parker turned to the issue of profit. 
The pupils readily saw that what is possible is not necessarily 
profitable, and began to think that perhaps the proposition to 
which they had all assented at the beginning—namely, to pro- 
duce enough sugar to meet our needs—might not be sound. In 
considering why the South had not raised more sugar cane, since 
it was quite possible, they suggested two important factors ; 
namely (to use their own language), “competing crops” and 
 
-P-A-G-E-299
PROBLEM-SOLVING 283 
“cost of labor.” They stated that probably portions of the 
South found cotton and other crops more satisfactory than 
cane, and that labor in Cuba was probably cheaper than in the 
Southern states. 
Pupil suggests the tariff. Teacher leaves it an open question, 
—Thus they concluded that the United States did not produce 
enough sugar to meet its own needs because it could be imported 
so cheaply that the farmers found it more profitable to raise 
other crops. The period was almost ended. Hence, in order to 
relate the day’s problem concerning sugar to the larger issue con- 
cerning the greatness of the United States and its self-sufficiency 
in producing the necessities of life, Miss Parker again raised the 
question of what we should do about the sugar problem. One 
boy suggested that we place a tariff on sugar. Miss Parker 
asked, “Who would pay the tariff?” The pupils said, ‘The 
people of the United States.” ‘“‘Who are the people of the United 
States ?” she then asked. ‘“ Weare,” they said. She then asked 
whether it seemed wise to make every family in the United 
States pay more for its sugar by means of a tariff in order that 
the country might produce enough sugar to meet its own 
needs. Without waiting for an answer she concluded the hour 
by saying, “This is a problem upon which the greatest Ameri- 
can statesmen disagree and to which Congress devotes long 
discussions,” 
Principles Illustrated 
Broad, flexible grasp of subject matter needed by teacher 
in ‘such lesson.—This type of geography-teaching is becoming 
common in schools where a special departmental teacher is em- 
ployed to teach the subject in the middle and upper grades. It 
is obvious that the teacher needs a thorough mastery of the sub- 
ject matter of geography if the discussions of the pupils are to 
be as flexible and broad as in the foregoing lesson. The teacher 
in such a case has to be familiar not only with such large issues 
as the question of protecting native sugar production by means
-P-A-G-E-300
  284 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
of a tariff, but also with such details as the number of growing- 
days required to mature sugar cane. 
Broad knowledge anticipates issues and prepares scientific 
data.—It is important to note, however, that when a teacher is 
thoroughly informed concerning the problem under discussion, 
as Miss Parker was in this case, she can anticipate the various 
issues that will arise, have ready the necessary scientific treatises 
and references, and guide the discussion so that it follows impor- 
tant scientific lines instead of being sidetracked on minor or irrel- 
evant issues. Thus Miss Parker realized in advance that the 
pupils would need to use the map showing sugar-cane produc- 
tion, and to save time had a memorandum prepared of the page 
on which it was to be found. She knew that the pupils would 
reach certain conclusions that needed verification, and she had 
on hand a special treatise on sugar and a certain report of the 
Department of Agriculture, with memoranda of the pages upon 
which the verifications could be based. 
Pupils suggest and evaluate data and procedures.— Yet with 
all this definite anticipation, planning, and direction by the 
teacher, the pupils carried the main burden of solving the prob- 
lem—they made all the important suggestions and evaluated 
most of them. Their suggestions included not only matters of 
fact, such as the necessity of enough growing-days and of suit- 
able soil, but also methods of procedure; for example, sugges- 
tions that they examine certain maps in their geographies to 
find certain data. These suggestions of procedure went even 
farther and included decisions concerning how the question 
should be subdivided and which phase should be taken up first, 
etc. For example, early in the hour the question arose whether 
to consider the possibilities of increased production of cane 
sugar or of beet sugar. Miss Parker had the pupils decide which 
of these should be investigated first. They chose cane sugar and 
held to it. 
Points of technique in seventh-grade lesson. Rapid view — 
Before turning to other lessons which will further illustrate the
-P-A-G-E-301
PROBLEM-SOLVING 285 
special technique to be used by a teacher in guiding problem- 
solving by pupils, we may note briefly some points of such tech- 
nique as is illustrated in this lesson. It is not necessary to study 
these carefully at this point, as most of them will be illustrated 
repeatedly in the later lessons and will be summarized in Section 
IV of the discussion. However, the cumulative effect of frequent 
reference to them will be helpful. Miss Parker’s lesson, then, 
had the following general characteristics found in the artistic 
direction of problem-solving discussions : 
1. She created an intense problem frame of mind by discon- 
certing the pupils with a graphic representation of the contrast 
between our large consumption and relatively small production 
of sugar. 
2. She had the problem for discussion clearly formulated and 
wrote it on the board. 
3. She kept the problem clearly before the pupils by frequent 
reference to it as written. 
4. She encouraged suggestions from the pupils not only in 
matters of fact or data but also in the matters of procedure ; that 
is, in regard to such questions as ‘‘ What shall we do next?” or 
“How can we find out about that ?” 
5. She encouraged the pupils in careful evaluation and crit- 
icism of the various suggestions. 
6. She gave practice in the use of scientific treatises as the 
source of data and as a means of verification. 
7. She encouraged the attitude of desiring verification of sug- 
gestions by reference to standard authorities. 
8. She conducted the lesson at a deliberate pace, so that pupils 
were required to think before answering. As a special device in 
this connection she occasionally said, “When you have your 
‘mind made up, you may rise,” and then waited until most of 
the pupils had risen. 
g. She kept the discussion organized along definite lines by 
outlining on the blackboard the various important suggestions 
that were made and then holding to the order in which they had
-P-A-G-E-302
  286 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
decided to pursue the discussion. In this way the main problem 
became analyzed into a number of subordinate problems which 
were disposed of in an orderly manner. 
Small subordinate problems that arise give even dull pupils a 
chance.—These subordinate problems included some very large 
ones and some small ones. Perhaps the largest that arose was 
the final one; namely, “Should a tariff be placed on sugar?” 
This seems almost as large as the original dilemma; namely, 
“Should the United States produce all the sugar it needs?” 
Somewhat smaller were these problems: ‘‘ What factors make it 
unprofitable to grow more cane?” and “What conditions are 
necessary to produce sugar cane?” Still smaller were these 
problems : ‘How shall we find out how far north sugar cane can 
be matured?” and ‘ How can we find out what states produce 
sugar cane?” The breaking up of the large issue into these 
smaller ones results in the lesson’s providing training in the solu- 
tion of both large and small problems. Some of the duller pupils, 
who might not be able to wrestle with the larger issues involved, 
might readily suggest looking up a sugar-production map and be 
able to read from it the data needed. 
In the next lesson to be presented—namely, one from the kin- 
dergarten—we shall find such small, simple problems presented 
that even five-year-old children can easily solve them. By read- 
ing through the other lessons which are to follow we can see how 
children are gradually trained to the point where they carry on 
the high-grade type of reflective problem-solving illustrated in 
Miss Parker’s seventh-grade lesson on sugar. 
B. Kindergarten Problem: How to make the Front of 
a Cardboard Store 
Contrast old-fashioned dictated constructions with new 
problem type.—In the kindergarten and primary grades many 
of the problems which pupils solve are concerned with the 
question how to make something. In the old-fashioned kinder-
-P-A-G-E-303
  PROBLEM-SOLVING 287 
gartens it was customary to dictate to pupils just what steps to 
take in constructing each object. There was little room for re- 
flective thinking by the pupils. In a modern, progressive kin- 
dergarten, on the other hand, large opportunities are given to 
pupils to experiment in their construction, and the experimen- 
tation is made of a reflective, thoughtful type through class 
discussions which the teacher organizes. In order to bring out 
the contrast between the old, dictated type of constructive 
activity and the newer, experimental type, we shall present 
first a lesson from an old kindergarten manual published in 
London in 1874, and then follow with a modern problem- 
solving lesson in making the front of a cardboard store. In the 
old manual the “fifth gift” is described as consisting of twenty- 
seven small cubes piled together to make one large cube. Some 
of the small cubes were further subdivided into triangular 
prisms. Each child had this material before him ; and in the 
dictated exercises all performed the same operations, as illus- 
- trated in the following quotation, in which the teacher addresses 
the children thus : 
“Show me the three top cubes in front. Place them on the three 
back cubes. What has our large cube become? A flight of steps 
or a flower stand? [The teacher then talks with the child about 
these objects.] Divide the flower stand the long way into three 
parts—what does it become?” “Three narrow flights of steps.” 
“Place the three together again. I take the middle step away and 
place the three cubes upon the top step. What have we now?” etc. 
While the pupils may be gaining in motor control and in ability 
to follow directions in such a lesson as that quoted above, and 
may even be quite happy in the process, it is obvious that they 
are not being trained in thinking and are not acquiring much 
skill in solving construction problems. 
Problem lesson. How to make a suitable front for a card- 
board store —In striking contrast with such mechanical, dictated 
activity, we present the following description of a lesson in the 
kindergarten of The University of Chicago Elementary School
-P-A-G-E-304
288 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
in 1918. The problem which engaged the attention of each pupil 
was the making of a suitable front for a small cardboard grocery 
store. The teacher was Miss Olive Paine. 
Relation to course of study in community life —According 
to the course in community life, history, and civics in this ele- 
mentary school, the children in the kindergarten study the family 
in its relation to the community. Needs of the family and the 
community as supplied by grocery stores furnish many prob- 
lems. The pupils engaged in the lesson to be described were 
almost ready for the first grade. 
Previous work. Trip to a grocery store.—The children had 
been taken to a grocery store some days before, where they 
observed the arrangement of the windows, doors, front of the 
store, shelves inside of the store, articles on the shelves and in 
the windows, etc. 
A store of large blocks previously constructed.—A store of 
some considerable size had been constructed of large blocks and 
was still standing in the recitation room. 
Individual stores started.—The day before the lesson each 
child had almost completed a small store made from heavy con- 
struction paper or from a cardboard box. The new lesson cen- 
tered in the completion of a suitable front for each store. For 
this purpose each child had been given a piece of construction 
paper somewhat larger than the front of his store. Some chil- 
dren had already cut out windows and doors in these sheets. 
Problem for the day. Making suitable fronts—The stores 
and fronts were brought out. The fronts were to be criticized, 
and to be remade if necessary. In short, the problem was the 
making of suitable fronts for the stores. 
Working-out of the problem. 1. Criticism of previous work. 
—As the teacher handed a child his store and his front, she asked 
him to place the front in position and see whether he thought it 
was just as he wanted it to be. Sometimes the windows extended 
beyond the outside walls of the store. Sometimes the doors and 
windows were higher than the store.
-P-A-G-E-305
  
PROBLEM-SOLVING 289 
2. Children suggest modifications ; discovering how to fit the 
fronts.—One child was asked how his front could have been 
made to fit the store. He held the sheet of pasteboard in front of 
the store and folded it around the side. Miss Paine asked what 
that was for. The child replied, ‘You could paste it tight to the 
store to hold the front on.” One child suggested folding the sheet 
over. The teacher asked how. Various children made sugges- 
tions, and they finally concluded that the sheet might have been 
held up in front of the store before the windows and door had 
been cut out. The place at which to fold it might have been 
marked with lines drawn with a pencil. Miss Paine asked how 
they would have marked straight lines. Finally, it was brought 
out that the sheet might be laid on the floor and folded over in 
a straight line by placing the edges of the top exactly together. 
Some of the children needed new sheets of paper and were 
hence provided with fresh material. Each child was led to 
hold the sheet up in front and mark a place with the pencil ; 
then to lay the sheet on the floor and fold it over at one side; 
then to hold the sheet up again and find the other side. 
3. Deciding how to make doors and windows ; crude idea of 
one child.—Then the children were led to see that the doors and 
windows must come in between the two folds thus made at the 
side. Some wanted two windows and one door. One little girl 
(the least able of the class, it seemed) cut a very narrow door 
1 An interesting dilemma arises in deciding how much to let children ex- 
periment in such construction work. On the one hand, it might be said that 
such experimentation, with its frequently erroneous results, is necessary 
tor children of kindergarten age in order to get them to feel the need for 
such thoughtful planning as prevailed in the lesson which we are describing. 
On the other hand, some educators would favor more direction by the 
teacher in order to avoid the waste of material incurred in this lesson. In 
the steel industry Carnegie would tear down and throw on the scrap heap 
an expensive plant which had been in use only a short time in order to 
make way for another which afterthought had shown to be better. How 
much should kindergarten children be permitted similar waste in solving 
construction problems? A later section on the nature of problem-solving 
will throw some light on the dilemma,
-P-A-G-E-306
290 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
about twice as high as her store. She was asked why she had 
cut so high a door. She said she wanted it that way. The other 
children said it was too high. The girl then said it was for an 
upstairs. The teacher asked whether stores and houses had a 
high door that was for both the lower floor and the upstairs. 
The child insisted that hers was all right. Finally, the teacher 
gave her a new sheet, pretty closely directed her work, and 
tried to get her to see the proper proportions for windows, 
door, etc.t 
4. Informal but directed designing and making ; what next, 
and how.—The children worked on the floor in a perfectly in- 
formal way. They were led to see what, the next thing was and 
to want to do that thing. How it could be done was “discussed 
and worked out very skillfully. Some of the children left the part 
designed for a window uncut at one end. Some wanted to use 
this to raise for an awning, and some wanted it for a shelf under 
the window. Apparently something of this kind had been done 
at some other time. The observer doubted whether this tend- 
ency came out accidentally on the part of so many without 
having been brought out in a previous lesson. However, it was 
quite skillfully used by many of the children. 
5. Teacher suggests standards for comparison.—Miss Paine 
kept bringing out the idea of size by comparison of the relative 
heights of doors, windows, shelves, men, women, etc. in the store 
they had seen and also in the store made of blocks. 
6. Children vary ideas of hinges.—The number of hinges 
needed for the door was discussed. One child had just one hinge 
and seemed happy. She was sent to examine a door to find out 
1Children with low-grade intellects are often unable to plan intelligently, 
but can acquire skill in motor arts; for example, Goddard indicates that 
a certain type of moron can learn to use machinery and care for animals 
and needs no supervision for routine work, but cannot plan. It is a waste 
of time to try to train such pupils to be skilled thinkers, but it is profitable 
to teach them practical motor arts by careful supervision. For Goddard’s 
convenient table showing some of the possibilities of the feeble-minded, 
see pages 554-555.
-P-A-G-E-307
  
PROBLEM-SOLVING 291 
how many hinges other doors had. Different children decided 
that two or three hinges would be best. One boy said four would 
be best. He wanted that number. 
7. Intercomparison and exchange of judgments by children. — 
The children were led to judge of the quality of their own work, 
and to supplement the judgment of others concerning their work 
and to supplement the judgment of the teacher. 
8. Fast children plan further work.—Two children proved 
much quicker and showed more ability in motor coérdination 
than did the rest. They completed their windows and doors and 
were ready to go on. They were asked what they wanted to do 
next. They said, “Make a shelf.” They were asked what they 
wanted to make it out of. ‘Pieces of cardboard.” The teacher 
handed one a piece and asked if that would do. “It is too little,” 
he said. The teacher said they should make the shelves the next 
day, as the end of the period had arrived. 
9. Articles put away until the next day.—The children were 
asked to get their stores and fronts ready to put up. ‘How will 
you know them?” asked Miss Paine. ‘Mark letters on them,” 
they said. Then they made their initials on the inside of the 
stores and the fronts. Quite naturally they gathered up their 
scraps and put them into the wastebasket. 
Evaluation of a kindergarten problem-solving lesson. 
Remarks by trained observer—The foregoing account of the 
observed lesson, except the paragraph headlines, was written 
by an experienced teacher of high-school mathematics, Miss 
Eleanora Harris, who had become interested in problem-solving 
in general. She was in the process of organizing her ideas of the 
technique of such teaching while attending a class for super- 
visors of teaching. Consequently the following comments, which 
she made as a high-school mathematics teacher observing a 
kindergarten construction lesson, are suggestive concerning the 
general matter of problem-solving : 
1. Definite aims.—The object of the lesson was clear to both 
teacher and children and was kept before the minds of the chil-
-P-A-G-E-308
  292. TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
dren all the time. Suitable fronts for the stores were to be made. 
This was the object in the minds of the children. In the mind of 
the teacher many purposes were in view. Each thing done was a 
preparation for that next higher. Progressive development was 
aimed at. This was evident in her questions, suggestions, etc. 
2. Self-criticism by pupils.—Progress was made in the chil- 
dren’s criticism of their own work. Each child, as he worked on 
his own front, was led to judge his own work from time to time 
as it was completed at that stage. He was led to find out how 
he could determine whether it was just what he wanted it to 
be. This was one of the parts of the recitation in which the 
teacher showed skill above the ordinary. : 
3. Codperative suggestion and evaluation—The matter of co- 
operative work, suggestions, etc. was brought out by the pupils 
in supplementing criticisms of each other and of the teacher. 
The teacher worked with the pupils, and they worked together, 
and yet each child was busy with his own store front. 
4. Encouraging pupils to make suggestions.—Independence 
on the part of pupils was encouraged by such questions as 
“What would you do?” “How might you do this time?” ‘Could 
you do it this way?” “If that is not just as you want it, how 
can you make it as you want it to be?” 
5. Responsibility for planning.—Each child was led to feel 
his own responsibility for the making of his front, planning, etc. 
He was first led to see what he wanted, and then he tried to find 
out how he could make what he wanted. 
6. Pupils interested.—The children were interested in their 
own work. This was shown by the fact that they wanted to go 
on even after the end of the period. 
7. Teacher anticipates pupils’ difficulties —A child’s prob- 
able difficulty was anticipated. The teacher really kept a sharp 
lookout on each pupil’s work, although she seemed to be leaving 
him to do as he pleased. If she saw a child marking a place 
that would result in the same error he was trying to avoid, she 
would ask him questions and get him to try to find out whether
-P-A-G-E-309
  PROBLEM-SOLVING 203 
that mark was just right. Sometimes she would ask a child who 
was about to get into trouble to look at the work of another who 
was succeeding and see what he thought of that. The child, 
without any suggestion, often got a clue for his own work and 
proceeded. If not, the teacher suggested something. 
8. Leaves a problem for the next day—The teacher left a 
problem in the minds of the children to be worked out for the 
next day—how to make the shelves on which to put the things 
they wanted in their stores. 
Transition to higher lessons.— Having gained these impres- 
sions of the technique of conducting problem-solving lessons in 
the kindergarten, let us now turn our attention to sample lessons 
from the second and fifth grades which will illustrate the practice 
in thinking that the pupils are given as they progress from the 
simple construction problems of the primary grades to the 
ability demonstrated in the seventh-grade sugar-production 
lesson with which the present section began. 
C. Second Grade: How to dress an Arab Doll 
Relation to course in community life.—The study of the 
pupils’ immediate environment which we found illustrated in the 
kindergarten lesson on grocery stores was followed in the first 
grade by a study of farm life and Indian life. As described in the 
preceding chapter, these social types enrich the pupils’ ideas 
of human wants and needs and of means of meeting these. In the 
second grade another strategic type of civilization was encoun- 
tered in the study of primitive shepherd life. Here the Arabs of 
the desert were being studied when the lesson which we shall 
describe was observed. The lesson occurred after the class had 
been studying the Arabs for some time. On the sand-table the 
children had made a desert, sand hills, and camel tracks and had 
planted some miniature palm trees. On the blackboard along 
one side of the room were pictures of deserts, sand hills, and 
several camels, The teacher was Miss Mary Cameron.

for the day was a study of the dress of the Arabs. The funda-

mental aim was to clarify and enlarge the ideas of the children 
concerning costumes. In the minds of the children it was 
dressing dolls to people their desert. 
Procedure: 1. The children suggest several things that need 
to be done.—“We have finished our oasis and desert. What 
shall we do today ?” asked Miss Cameron. The children replied : 
“Make a cam- 
el.” “Make some 
Arabs.” “What 
Arabs should you 
like to make?” 
“Some traveling 
Arabs.” “We can 
make some tents 
too,” said the 
children. “How 
many Arabs shall 
we plan for?” 
“Twelve.” “But,”

from a little girl. “How many do you want in your family?” 
“The father, the mother, and a little boy or a little girl.” 
“All right, or there might be both a little boy and a little 
girl. Now, here are the dolls you brought me. Which shall we 
choose for the father?” One doll was chosen. “What shall we 
do next ?” “Make his clothes?” “Yes, but what must we do 
before we actually make the clothes ? What does your mother do 
before she makes you a dress ?”” “She cuts a pattern.” “Yes, 
and what else?” “She measures me.” “Yes, and what else?” 
It was then decided that the clothing must be planned first.

THE SCHOOL REPORTER 
OUR THEATER 
We were studying about the Arabs and so we decided to make 
a puppet theater and show plays of Arabia to the other grades. 
We took an old kitchen table and nailed a wooden post in each 
corner. Then we took a piece of cardboard and cut an arch- 
way and nailed it to the front posts. We did this to cover the 
posts and make the stage look like a real theater. We stretched 
wire around all the posts. We stretched wire across the stage 
for scenes to move on. We had a wire between the two front 
posts to hang the curtain. We have a linen curtain with a 
border of tents and palm trees. We have strings fastened to 
it so that we can pull it back and forth. 
We drew pictures of wide, hot plains for the backgrounds. 
Some show the sunrise and some show the sky at night. Then we 
dressed some dolls. We made an Arab chief and a woman and 
a boy and girl. We dressed camel drivers. We modeled camels 
out of clay for a caravan. We have palm trees and tents, too. 
We have one play with it and we are practicing another. 
We put wires onto our dolls so that we can move them. The 
dolls can’t talk so we get behind a curtain and talk for them and 
moye them with the wires so that the people cannot see us. 
We will write you the play we made and are practicing in 
our theater now. This is it :

2. Teacher focuses attention on planning clothes for the 
father doll—What clothes shall we need to make for the 
father ?” asked Miss Cameron. “A turban.” “A robe.” “A 
sash.” “Weapons.” Then someone else suggested sandals. ‘How 
can we make sandals?” came from a little girl. “We will leave 
that for another time,” replied the teacher. “What else shall 
we need for the father?” “A shawl.” “Why does an Arab 
wear a shawl?” “It is so cold at night.” 
3. Summary of suggestions by children—‘Who can tell me 
everything that we shall need to make for the father 2?” A child 
volunteered, “A sash, a robe, a turban, sandals, and a shawl.” 
“Let’s look at some pictures,” said the teacher. ‘Notice care- 
fully what these Arabs have on. Think about how we can make 
the clothes for the father.” Then the children all looked at the 
pictures. 
4. Attack problem of making a robe.—One little girl ex- 
claimed, “We shall ave to have a robe.” “What shall you need 
to make a robe?” Then from various children came “Scissors.” 
“Thread.” ‘Red cloth.” “A ruler.” “Needles.” ‘White cloth.” 
“All right,” said‘Miss Cameron ; “here is some cloth. Who has 
a suggestion for making the robe ?” 
5. Boy experiments on robe.—A boy went up to the table 
and, taking a small piece of white cloth, cut a hole in it and 
slipped it over the head of the doll. The teacher asked him to 
hold it up so that the others might see it. 
6. Criticisms and alternative suggestions by other children. 
—Several of the children objected to the looks of the robe, say- 
ing, “It is too short.” “How long should it be?” “It should 
come below the knees.” ‘Oh, it should come clear to the heels,” 
said another pupil. “What else can you suggest about this 
robe?” ‘Robes are loose over the shoulders.” “How could we 
make a robe that way?” One boy said he would have a piece 
hang over each shoulder. Another wanted it to come to a point 
in the back. Another wanted it fastened in some way. One said 
the hole for the neck was too large. “Why is it too large?” 
 
-P-A-G-E-314
  298 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
  asked Miss Cameron. “It won’t stay on the shoulder.” ‘You 
could button it on,” said one girl. “Who thinks he can make a 
better robe?” A girl tried. She held the doll up and said, “I 
would hold it together, this way, with a sash.” “‘Js it all right?” 
asked the teacher. ‘No, it is not full enough.” 
7. Subordinate problems arise: sleeves and sash.—‘ Where 
are the sleeves?” asked a child. ‘Will someone show us how the 
sleeves might be fixed so that they will be right ?” added the 
teacher. A girl pinned the sleeves. “Do you think that is bet- 
ter ?”? “No,” came from several. Finally, the children got the 
sleeves pinned a little more to their taste. “What could we use 
for a girdle ?” queried Miss Cameron. “A piece of cloth.” “A 
piece of tape.” “Paper.” “J am thinking of something that your 
mothers are using a great deal these days,” said she. “Yarn!” 
A piece of yarn was selected and wound around the doll. “Do 
you like the side of this robe? Shall we make the side this way 
tomorrow?” “No,” said a child, ‘“‘we must sew it.” The teacher 
then had the children examine a seam of a little child’s dress. 
They decided that the edge of the seam must be straight,—not 
left rough. “We can tuck it in,” said a child, meaning that it 
should be French-seamed. 
8. Devising a turban.—What else can we make for the 
father?” “A turban.” “All right.” A girl then took a piece 
of white cloth and tried to make a turban. She made it look 
about like a veil, hanging down the back. “Do you think it looks 
like a turban?” “No, it should not hang down,” said a. boy. 
“You try it,” said the teacher. The boy got up and tore a very 
narrow strip off and wound it around the head of the doll. The 
result was a pretty good turban. “Looks like the father had a 
sore head,” said one child. 
9. Standard for comparison presented by teacher.—“'Com- 
pare it with a picture of a turban,” said the teacher, producing a 
picture of a man with a turban. “Pretty good,” was the general 
verdict. But some were not satisfied with the sore-head appear-
-P-A-G-E-315
  PROBLEM-SOLVING 209 
ance. “See if you can improve upon it,’ suggested the teacher 
to a little girl. The latter tried to make a turban by first wind- 
ing it around her finger. She failed, and then wound the strip 
around the doll’s head, as the boy had done. However, she took 
a broader strip. Some liked this better. “Why do you think it 
is better?” “Tt covers the head better.” ‘It is more the shape.” 
“Is the turban finished?” “No, a cord should be around it.” 
“You come and put a cord on.” A boy put a bit of yarn around 
the turban for a cord. “It should be the same color as the 
sash,” came from a girl. “That might look better,” said the 
teacher. 
10. Problem for next day.—“Tomorrow we shall make a 
shawl. If any of you have anything at home that you think you 
would like to use to make your shawl, it would be nice to bring 
it to school.” Then different children told of what they could 
bring. “We must make a collar. Men wear collars,” came from 
one child. “Do Arabs wear collars?” They decided not. 
11. Child off the track.—One girl arose and very earnestly 
began telling how a doll she had was dressed. It was brought 
from abroad. It was a French doll. The teacher listened a mo- 
ment and then asked, “But what kind of people are we talking 
about ?” “Arabs,” came in a chorus. “Bring your things for a 
shawl tomorrow, and we shall finish dressing the Arab father.” 
Thus ended the lesson. 
Conversational method prevails in problem-solving discus- 
sions.—As indicated above, the conversational form in which 
this second-grade lesson is described helps us to get a clearer idea 
of the conversational spirit that prevails in a problem-solving 
discussion lesson than we derived from the seventh-grade lesson 
‘on sugar production or from the kindergarten construction les- 
son. It is important to realize, however, that in both these 
lessons the same informal, conversational give-and-take between 
teacher and pupils prevailed. At the same time, in all the lessons, 
we feel that the teacher is a very definite, stimulating, and guid-
-P-A-G-E-316
    300 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
ing force. She keeps the pupils’ minds actively directed along 
educative lines so that they are acquiring important ideas at the 
same time that they are securing training in the reflective solu- 
tion of problems. 
D. Fifth Grade: Standardized Short Geography Problems 
on the British Isles 
Transition from simple, primary construction problems to 
technical scientific problems of higher grades.—As a final 
example of problem-solving lessons in the elementary school we 
shall present one from a fifth-grade class in geography. This 
lesson will show the transition from (1) the simple construction 
problems arising out of social needs which we have illustrated 
from the kindergarten and second grade to (2) the more com- 
plicated, technical problems of the upper grades which we illus- 
trated by the problem of the United States’ increasing its sugar 
production, and which brought in such technical issues as the 
number of growing-days required by sugar cane, the cost of 
labor, competing crops, and the question of a tariff on sugar. In 
this fifth-grade lesson we shall find the children dealing with 
certain simple technical matters such as the tides in navigable 
rivers and the use of a scale of miles and of the directions east, 
west, north, and south in reading a map. 
London problems. How is London influenced by the Thames ? 
Dialogue.— Under the direction of Miss Edith Parker the chil- 
dren in the fifth grade of The University of Chicago Elemen- 
tary School had taken up the study of the British Isles. They 
had begun the study of London shortly before the lesson which 
we shall describe. In order to give the reader further notions 
of the conversational technique of problem-solving discussion 
lessons, we shall present most of this lesson in dialogue form 
as reconstructed from rapid memoranda which I made during 
my observation. We shall use capital “T” to designate the 
teacher’s remarks (which are printed in italics) and capital
-P-A-G-E-317
PROBLEM-SOLVING 301 
“P” to designate the pupils’ remarks. Occasionally, where I 
caught the name of the pupil, I have used it. Much of the 
dialogue is omitted, but enough is given to illustrate the proce- 
dure and to give the reader an impression of some of the fine 
points of the technique. The teacher’s remarks are numbered, 
in order to facilitate discussions of the lesson. 
The lesson.— When the children were seated and quiet, 
the lesson proceeded as follows: 
Introductory.— (1) T. How many can now see London on 
the map without looking at the latter? (Several of the pupils 
held up their hands as Miss Parker waited a moment.) About 
how far from the mouth of the river is it? Look at your maps 
and, using your scale of miles, work it out. 
P. I say it is exactly forty miles, because it is double the 
distance across the Strait. 
Another P. I say it is just thirty-five by the scale. 
(2) T. Your differences may be due to your choosing dif- 
ferent places as marking the mouth of the river. Measure clear 
out to the place marked North Foreland. (The children then 
discussed and decided upon the distance.) 
(3) T. How could such a large seaport as London develop so 
far up the Thames River? Put up your hands when you are 
ready. I want to see many of you ready before I call on anybody. 
(She then waited about half a minute.) 
Martha. Because of the tides. 
(4) T. How do the tides. help? 
Martha. I don’t know how. 
Julian. The tides help to make it a great port. They let the 
boats come in. 
(5) T. How many agree with Julian? (A brief discussion 
followed which brought out the fact that the high tides make the 
river deep enough to let the big boats come up. The teacher told 
of large vessels waiting at Gravesend for high tide, to ascend the 
river, and of “locked” docks being used to keep these vessels 
afloat during Jow tide.)

302. TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
Written questions presented.—T. We have here (indicating 
the blackboard) some questions for you. Some you can answer 
easily and others you will have to think out. Will you read the 
first question and answer it, Ellwood? (The full list of questions 
is printed below.’) 
First written question.—Ellwood read, “How is the city 
situated with regard to the Thames? See map on page ——.” 
(The pupils turned to a small map of London. Ellwood’s answer 
was vague.) 
Another P. The map shows the river running right through 
London. They have a Hyde Park! (These children lived in 
the Hyde Park of Chicago.) 
Another P. The river looks awfully twisty here—not straight. 
(6) T. What other points about London and the Thames do 
you find from this map? 
Various P. Many parks. Victory roads. (Other irrelevant 
answers.) 
(7) T. Do those have anything to do with the Thames? It 
is not a good answer unless it shows how London is related to 
the Thames. (The pupils now held better to the question.) 
P. It has many bridges. 
Another P. The city extends far along the river, both north 
and south of it. 
1The questions for Miss Parker’s lesson on London were written on the 
blackboard as follows:

(8) T. How long is London? 
P. About eighteen miles. (Various other answers to the first 
question were developed.) 
Summing up first question.—(9) T. Now let us sum up 
what we have found in answer to the first question, (As the 
pupils enumerated their points the teacher wrote them on the 
board in outline form, thus: 
. On both sides. 
. Winding. 
. 20 miles. 
. Bridges.) BWR

Second question—P. (Reads from blackboard) ‘What 
determined the location of London Bridge?” 
(10) T. If you had visited the Thames River and the site of 
London before the city was built, you would have seen something 
like this. (Then she drew on the board a diagram of the river 
and described the location of the highlands and the low marshes 
and swamps.) When the people wanted to build a bridge over 
the Thames, where should you say it would have been, judging 
from this diagram? (The children were very quiet and consid- 
erably puzzled.) 
P. (Indicating a certain point on the diagram) Right here, 
where it is narrowest. 
(11) T. My diagram is not exactly right if the river seems 
narrower to vou at this point. I will change it, because the river 
is not really narrower there. What do you think, Frank? 
Frank. I should say right here, near the highland; one 
could easily get at it. (The pupils now became quite active in 
agreeing or disagreeing with Frank.) 
P. I agree with Frank, but I want to ask a question first. (He 
then went to the board and asked something about the depth of 
the river. He quickly decided his own idea was not a good one 
and retired to his seat. After the hour was over, Miss Parker 
said that this boy was an impulsive thinker and that his self-
-P-A-G-E-320
  304. TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
checking in this case really represented growth on his part. As 
a rule the class or teacher had to check him in his impulsive or 
irrelevant discussions.) 
(12) T. Now let’s finish the discussion of Frank’s plan before 
we take up another. (Several pupils discussed the question, 
largely in terms of carrying timbers, of easy access to one bank 
or the other, etc.) 
(13) T. How many are pretty well convinced now that this 
would be the best place for the bridge? (Many hands were held 
up.) Have you something new to offer, Oliver? (Oliver started 
to talk along the same line.) 
(14) T. Yours is just a part of the same general argument. 
. .. Are you ready to know what really happened? ... This 
is the place (pointing to the diagram) where the bridge was built. 
Here the river swings in against the cliff. It was the first place, 
as people came up the river, where they could find a good spot te 
build a bridge. . . . (The teacher then sketched in the bridge 
on the diagram.) 
Third question—(15) T. Our next question, Jack. 
Jack. (Reads) ‘In which direction are the docks from the 
bridge, and why?” 
P. That’s the easiest question yet. Seaward. 
(16) T. Yes, that’s a good answer ; but I mean what cardinal 
direction—north, east, south, or west. 
Various P. North. West. East. 
(17) T. Isn’t it strange that you can’t tell me from this small 
map whether the docks are east, west, north, or south of the 
bridge! . . . What is the difficulty ?+ (The period was now at 
an end; so this problem, together with questions 4, 5, 6, and 7, 
which dealt with the location of factories and residence sections 
and the reasons for the greatness of London, were left for the 
next lesson.) 
1Miss Parker explained to me later that while the children had at- 
tained fair skill in reading directions on large colored maps, they needed 
more drill in applying the same principles to small city maps. 
   
-P-A-G-E-321
  PROBLEM-SOLVING 305 
Growth of diagram summarizes results of thinking.—At 
the end of the discussion of all the questions, the simple diagram 
of the bends in the river with which they had begun had been 
supplemented through answers from the later questions until it 
showed the docks for various kinds of merchandise, factories 
of various kinds, residence districts for poor and for rich, etc. 
Points of technique briefly noted.—As in the case of the 
first two lessons which we described, it will be helpful to note 
certain general characteristics of this London lesson preliminary 
to our organized discussion of technique which is to be pre- 
sented in Section IV. Briefly stated, these characteristics are 
the following: 
1. A deliberate pace prevailed. For example, in the paragraph 
numbered 3 in the dialogue, Miss Parker waited about a half- 
minute after saying: “Put up your hands when you are ready. 
I want to see many of you ready before I call on anybody.” 
2. Evaluation by the pupils was encouraged. Among Miss 
Parker’s favorite remarks are “Do you think that is a good 
point ?” “Do you agree with that ?” “Is that a good argument ?” 
3. Standards of good thinking were taught the pupils. Exam- 
ples occur in paragraph 7, where Miss Parker emphasized hold- 
ing to the question by saying, “It is not a good answer unless it 
shows how London is related to the Thames”’; in paragraph 12, 
“Now let’s finish the discussion of Frank’s plan before we take 
up another” ; and in paragraph 14, “Yours is just a part of the 
same general argument.” 
4. Summing up the discussion was periodically attended to. 
The best example given above is in paragraph 9, which points 
out that the answers to the first problem were reviewed by a 
pupil and written on the board by the teacher as a few concise, 
numbered points. 
5. The thinking was kept organized by four devices: (1) writ- 
ing the principal questions on the board; (2) holding to the 
main point of each discussion (as described under 3); (3) sum- 
ming up periodically (as described under 4); and (4) plotting

upon a diagram the important data, suggestions, and conclusions 
as they were accepted. 
Experimentation in grading problems, technical data, 
and activities for fifth-grade geography.—Finally, before 
turning to Section III of the discussion, in which we shall in- 
quire how skilled problem-solvers think, we may, as a further 
preliminary to our general conclusions about technique in Sec- 
tion IV, present Miss Parker’s own memorandum concerning 
experimental work in organizing problem-solving lessons in the 
middle grades. These points she gave me for presentation to 
my class of teachers before we observed one of her fifth-grade 
lessons. She wrote as follows : 
Experimental work in teaching geography in this fifth grade is 
being done in order 
1. To determine what problems are of the right difficulty for chil- 
dren of this age; in other words, to grade problems. 
2. To determine the degree of subdivision of problems necessary 
and the definite steps in solution that need to be indicated for chil- 
dren of this age. 
3. To grade the map-reading, text-reading, picture-reading, and 
statistics-reading that are motivated by these problems. 
4. To devise means of establishing thoroughly those principles 
of interpretation of maps, pictures, statements, and statistics that 
can be established in this grade. 
5. To devise means of helping children of this age to work inde- 
pendently and to check their own inferences. (Written directions are 
being used at present in an effort to lessen dependence on the teacher.) 
6. To devise means of getting reactions at each step from each 
individual rather than from only one or two. This is a vital matter 
in the fifth grade, where basic interpretation habits are being formed. 
It is a matter that is often neglected where the problem-solving 
method is dominant. 
Conclusion of discussion of actual lessons of Section II. 
Transition to Section III.—This concludes our long Section II, 
in which we have presented, in considerable detail, four prob- 
lem-solving lessons in order to give the beginning teacher a 
 
-P-A-G-E-323
  PROBLEM-SOLVING “307 
vivid idea of this type of teaching as it is actually carried on in 
a progressive elementary school. The seventh-grade lesson on 
sugar and the kindergarten cardboard-construction lesson gave us 
general notions of the organization of such instruction. The con- 
versational data given in the second-grade Arab lesson and the 
dialogue of the fifth-grade London lesson brought us more inti- 
mately into the conversational give-and-take between teacher 
and pupils that characterizes problem-solving discussions. In 
all the lessons we found the teacher aiding the pupils to get the 
problem clearly in mind, to make and evaluate suggestions, and 
to keep their thoughts moving actively along some particular 
educative line. We found many of the pupils alert and active 
in suggestion, sometimes keenly critical, and gradually devel- 
oping in ability from the kindergarten, where they decided how 
many hinges a door needed, to the seventh grade, where they 
were ready to consider whether a tariff should be placed on sugar 
in order to encourage home production. In Miss Parker’s final 
memorandum we found a skilled teacher especially concerned 
about the issue of grading problems in the middle grades so 
as to adapt them in general to this grade of pupils and to give 
even the slow pupils practice in thoughtfully using the technical 
tools of problem-solving that are used by scientific specialists in 
geography. We shall now turn to a description of how problem- 
solving thinking is done by skilled thinkers—notably by great 
scientists, such as eminent geographers, astronomers, etc. 
Section III. How Sxittrut PropirEM-SoLvers THINK 
Need for analyzing skill in problem-solving to determine 
methods.—In our discussions of the teaching of various forms 
of skill, such as handwriting or reading, we found it necessary 
to determine how skillful performers behave—for example, 
how skillful handwriters and readers perform—in order to 
determine how to give pupils similar skill. In the case of 
handwriting, for example, we found that careful laboratory ex-
-P-A-G-E-324
    308. TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
periments were necessary in order to prove that in much expert 
handwriting the letters are made predominantly with finger 
movements instead of with arm movements. In the case of 
reading we found that a variety of types of reading-skill can 
be distinguished, and that many tests and laboratory experi- 
ments have helped us considerably in understanding how skilled 
reading is done and how to train children to be skillful, re- 
sourceful readers. 
Similarly, in the case of problem-solving we need a clear 
understanding of how skillful problem-solvers think in order to 
train pupils to perform the same type of thinking. As in the 
case of handwriting and reading, so in the case of thinking, a 
number of erroneous ideas have prevailed concerning the nature 
of the processes of skilled performers. We shall not have time or 
space, however, to discuss these mistaken notions here, but shall 
turn our attention immediately to an account of the methods of 
thinking and inquiry used by some of the greatest thinkers ; 
namely, by great scientists as these are described by W. Whewell 
in his ‘History of the Inductive Sciences.” * 
Biographies of certain great scientists reveal methods of 
thinking.— Whewell had made a profound study of the methods 
and results of most of the great scientists up to his time. In 
connection with his account of the great astronomer Kepler 
(1571-1630), he describes methods of scientific study and 
research in general and at the same time gives an interesting 
account of Kepler’s peculiar traits. 
1Whewell’s work, published in 1837, is an excellent exhibition of careful 
English scholarship. T. H. Huxley, in “The Advance of Science” (p. 74), 
characterizes Whewell as a man of “great acquirements and remarkable 
intellectual powers.” It would be well if more persons would secure their 
ideas of scientific method from such works as Whewell’s instead of from 
Francis Bacon’s false theories. In contrast with Bacon’s ignorance of actual 
scientific investigations and his ridicule of the methods of his great scien- 
tific contemporaries (such as Copernicus), Whewell proceeded to derive 
correct notions of the nature of scientific thinking by an examination of 
the methods actually used by great scientists in their work,
-P-A-G-E-325
  PROBLEM-SOLVING 309 
Accounts should include failures as well as successes. Whew- 
ell’s description.— Kepler’s investigations furnish especially good 
material from which to determine how a great scientist thinks, 
because he left accounts of his whole process of inquiry, includ- 
ing his incorrect ideas and unsuccessful endeavors as well as the 
correct ones. With these accounts in mind Whewell wrote the 
following discussion of how great scientists discover new truths 
and solve great scientific problems (17: Vol. I, pp. 291-292): 
Bold guessing —Advances in knowledge are not commonly made 
without the previous exercise of some boldness and license in guess- 
ing. The discovery of new truths requires, undoubtedly, minds care- 
ful and scrupulous in examining what is suggested, but it requires, 
no less, such as are quick and fertile in suggesting. What is inven- 
tion except the talent of rapidly calling before us many possibilities 
and selecting the appropriate one? It is true that when we have re- 
jected all the inadmissible suppositions, they are quickly forgotten 
by most persons, and few think it necessary to dwell on these dis- 
carded hypotheses and on the process by which they were con- 
demned, as Kepler has done. 
Reasoning on many errors.—But all who discover truths must 
have reasoned upon many errors to obtain each truth ; every accepted 
doctrine must have been one selected out of many candidates. In 
making many conjectures which on trial proved erroneous, Kepler 
was no more fanciful or unphilosophical than other discoverers have 
been. Discovery is not a cautious or rigorous process in the sense of 
abstaining from such suppositions. But there are great differences, 
in different cases, in the facility with which guesses are proved to be 
errors and in the degree of attention with which the error and the 
proof are afterwards dwelt on. Kepler certainly was remarkable for 
the labor which he gave to such self-refutations and for the candor 
and copiousness with which he narrated them; his works are in this 
way extremely curious and amusing and are a very instructive ex- 
hibition of the mental process of discovery. But in this respect, I 
venture to believe, they exhibit to us the usual process (somewhat 
caricatured) of inventive minds—they rather exemplify the rule of 
genius than (as has generally been hitherto taught) the exception. 
We may add that if many of Kepler’s guesses now appear fanciful 
and absurd, because time and observation have refuted them, others,
-P-A-G-E-326
  310 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
which were at the time equally gratuitous, have been confirmed by 
succeeding discoveries in a manner which makes them appear mar- 
velously sagacious, as, for instance, his assertion of the rotation of 
the sun on axis before the invention of the telescope. Nothing can 
be more just, as well as more poetically happy, than Kepler’s picture 
of the philosopher’s pursuit of scientific truth, conveyed by means of 
an allusion to Virgil’s shepherd and shepherdess : 
Coy yet inviting, Galatea loves 
To sport in sight, then plunge into the groves; 
The challenge given, she darts along the green, 
Will not be caught, yet would not run unseen. 
Devising tests of falsé suppositions.—We may notice as another 
peculiarity of Kepler’s reasonings the length and laboriousness of the 
processes by which he discovered the errors of his first guesses. One 
of the most important talents requisite for a discoverer is the in- 
genuity and skill which devises means for rapidly testing false sup- 
positions as they offer themselves. This talent Kepler did not 
possess ; he was not even a good arithmetical calculator, often mak- 
ing mistakes, some of which he detected and laments, while others 
escaped him to the last. 
Willingness to abandon false hypotheses.—But his defects in this 
respect were compensated by his courage and perseverance in under- 
taking and executing such tasks ; and, what was still more admirable, 
he never allowed the labor he had spent upon any conjecture to 
produce any reluctance in abandoning the hypothesis as soon as he 
had evidence of its inaccuracy. The only way in which he rewarded 
himself for his trouble was by describing to the world, in his lively 
manner, his schemes, exertions, and feelings. 
Scientists’ method of solving problems. Bold guessing, erro- 
neous guessing, devising tests, abandoning errors.—Careful 
reading and study of the above quotation will give us most of 
the ideas that we need in order to understand the thinking 
processes in problem-solving. We may list them briefly as 
follows: 
1. Bold guessing as the basis of fertile suggesting. 
2. Erroneous guessing—‘All who discover truths must have 
reasoned upon many errors to discover each truth.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-327
  
PROBLEM-SOLVING 311 
3. Skill in devising means of testing the truth of guesses.t 
4. Willingness to abandon an erroneous guess or untenable 
hypothesis. 
Kepler succeeded, though handicapped by slowness and by 
poor calculations.—In addition to these characteristics of reflec- 
tive thinking as found in the work of great scientists, it is 
interesting to note that Kepler succeeded wonderfully in spite 
of certain personal handicaps. For example, “He was not even 
a good arithmetical calculator, often making mistakes, some of 
which he detected and laments, while others escaped him to the 
last.” When one recalls what an important factor mathematical 
precision is in modern scientific method, one can appreciate what 
a handicap Kepler labored under. Moreover, he was not rapid 
in devising means of testing his suppositions, but he compensated 
for this lack “by ‘his courage and perseverance in undertaking 
and executing such tasks.” In general, these characteristics of 
Kepler suggest that a person—for example, a pupil—may be a 
very competent thinker and, in the long run, very successful in 
solving problems, and yet be very slow and laborious in his 
methods of criticism and verification. 
1Huxley (‘The Advance of Science,” p. 33) supports Whewell’s state- 
ment of the place of guessing, or conjecturing, in careful scientific thinking, 
in the following words: 
“Tt is a favorite popular delusion that the scientific inquirer is under 
a sort of moral obligation to abstain from going beyond that generaliza- 
tion of observed facts which is absurdly called Baconian induction. But 
anyone who is practically acquainted with scientific work is aware that 
those who refuse to go beyond fact rarely get as far as fact, and anyone 
who has studied the history of science knows that almost every great step 
therein has been made by the “anticipation of nature”; that is, by the 
invention of hypotheses which, though verifiable, often had very little 
foundation to start with and, not unfrequently, in spite of a long career 
of usefulness, turned out to be wholly erroneous in the long run. 
“The geocentric system of astronomy, with its eccentrics and its epi- 
cycles, was an hypothesis utterly at variance with fact, which nevertheless 
did great things for the advancement of astronomical knowledge. Kepler 
was the wildest of guessers. Newton’s corpuscular theory of light was 
of much temporary use in optics, though nobody now believes in it.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-328
  312. TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
Scientific biographies reveal how we think.—Such accounts 
as Whewell gives of the personal efforts of scientific workers to 
solve problems help us to understand the actual mental processes 
involved in skilled thinking. On the basis of this understanding 
we can proceed to give pupils practice in doing similar thinking. 
In recent years the psychological writings of William James and 
John Dewey have especially emphasized the nature of these 
thinking processes. From their discussions educators may derive 
help in understanding how we think and how to train pupils 
in thinking. 
Dewey’s notable account of how we think.— Professor 
John Dewey is himself one of America’s greatest thinkers and is 
at the same time a trained psychologist who has specialized in 
the study of thinking processes. Consequently his book ‘How 
We Think” (1910) deserves very special study. It should be 
read carefully time and again in order to grasp its detailed 
meanings. I have known a number of students and even writers 
upon education who have studied the book superficially and, as 
a consequence, failed to grasp some of its most significant points. 
Some of his most fundamental ideas, for our purposes, are con- 
tained in the three following paragraphs. The headings are not 
in the original, and the paragraphing is slightly altered. 
Origin in some perplexity—We may recapitulate by saying that 
the origin of thinking is some perplexity, confusion, or doubt. Think- 
ing is not a case of spontaneous combustion; it does not occur just 
on “general principles.” There is something specific which occasions 
and evokes it. General appeals to a child (or to a grown-up) to 
think, irrespective of the existence in his own experience of some 
difficulty that troubles him and disturbs his equilibrium, are as futile 
as advice to lift himself by his bootstraps. 
Form a tentative plan based on analogous past experience and prior 
knowledge.—Given a difficulty, the next step is suggestion of some 
way out—the formation of some tentative plan or project, the en- 
tertaining of some theory which will account for the peculiarities in 
question, the consideration of some solution for the problem. The 
data at hand cannot supply the solution; they can only suggest it.
-P-A-G-E-329
  PROBLEM-SOLVING 313 
What, then, are the sources of the suggestion? Clearly past expe- 
rience and prior knowledge. If the person has had some acquaint- 
ance with similar situations, if he has dealt with material of the same 
sort before, suggestions more or less apt and helpful are likely to 
arise. But unless there has been experience in some degree analo- 
gous, which may now be represented in imagination, confusion re- 
mains mere confusion. There is nothing upon which to draw in order 
to clarify it. Even when a child (or a grown-up) has a problem, to 
urge him to think when he has no prior experiences involving some 
of the same conditions is wholly futile. 
. Plan not accepted until carefully examined and criticized.—If the 
suggestion that occurs is at once accepted we have uncritical think- 
ing, the minimum of reflection. To turn the thing over in mind, to 
reflect, means to hunt for additional evidence, for new data, that 
will develop the suggestion and will either—as we say—bear it out 
or else make obvious its absurdity and irrelevance. Given a genuine 
difficulty and a reasonable amount of analogous experience to draw 
upon, the difference, par excellence, between good and bad thinking 
is found at this point. The easiest way is to accept any suggestion 
that seems plausible and thereby bring to an end the condition of 
mental uneasiness. Reflective thinking is always more or less trouble- 
some, because it involves overcoming the inertia that inclines one 
to accept suggestions at their face value, it involves willingness to 
endure a condition of mental unrest. . .. Reflective thinking, in 
short, means judgment suspended during further inquiry, and sus- 
pense is likely to be somewhat painful... . The most important 
factor in the training of good mental habits consists in acquiring the 
attitude of suspended conclusion and in mastering the various meth- 
ods of searching for new materials to corroborate or to refute the 
first suggestions that occur. To maintain the state of doubt and to 
carry on systematic and protracted inquiry—these are the essentials 
of thinking. (9: 12-13) 
Dewey’s text ; state of doubt plus systematic and protracted 
inquiry.—In general this quotation from Dewey’s work gives 
us the same notions of careful inquiry that we derived from the 
accounts of Kepler’s thinking; namely, (1) prolonged careful 
search for suggested solutions, (2) careful, open-minded evalua- 
tion and testing of each suggestion or plan, (3) suspended judg- 
 
-P-A-G-E-330
    314. TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
ment, patience to wait until the true solution has been discovered 
and verified. Since the language of Dewey’s paragraphs varies 
from Whewell’s account of Kepler, we can pick up from Dewey 
some excellent additional phrases to use in our thinking about 
training in problem-solving. Perhaps the best of these are con- 
tained in the final sentence, ‘To maintain the state of doubt 
and to carry on systematic and protracted inquiry —these are 
the essentials of thinking.” f 
With such an understanding of the nature of skillful problem- 
solving as we can derive from these accounts by Whewell and 
Dewey, and from the accounts of actual problem-solving lessons 
given earlier in the discussion, we can now proceed to summarize 
our ideas of how to train pupils in problem-solving. 
SecTION IV. RULES FOR TRAINING PUPILS IN REFLECTIVE 
PROBLEM-SOLVING 
Assume suitable problem, adequate experience, and in- 
teresting dilemma.—At the outset of this section we may 
assume (1) that a problem adapted to the pupils’ maturity and 
experience is to be solved; (2) that the pupils have analogous 
previous experience and related information needed for the so- 
lution or that they know how to proceed to get this information ; 
and (3) that an interesting dilemma, or quandary, has been 
created. In other words, we shall assume that a suitable problem 
for solution has already arisen from some puzzling situation 
and that the pupils are interested to solve it. 
Interest in problem increased by competition —The pupils’ 
interest may arise from the mere instinctive interest in think- 
ing which we described early in the chapter and which leads 
many adults and children to enjoy playful puzzling about all 
sorts of perplexing, strange, unexpected, or disconcerting occur- 
rences. This instinctive interest easily maintains itself and is 
greatly aided by the instinctive interest in competition. Pupils 
compete to make appropriate suggestions, to criticize the sugges-
-P-A-G-E-331
  
PROBLEM-SOLVING 318 
tions of others, and, in general, to “win out” personally in achiev- 
ing the solutions of the major problem and its many subdivisions. 
Teacher’s threefold task.—With such an interesting situa- 
tion created, the teacher’s task becomes one of (1) guiding the 
thinking of the pupils; (2) aiding them when confronted by 
difficulties that are beyond their powers or which they would 
waste their time in solving; and (3) eventually making them 
aware of what good thinking is, so that they may consciously 
strive for it during their thinking, just as they strive to improve 
their handwriting or their reading. 
Thorndike’s parallel for guiding thinking. Finding the road 
to grandpa’s.—The general nature of a teacher’s activity in 
assisting pupils in problem-solving is cleverly suggested by 
Thorndike when he compares it to assisting a child to discover 
the road to grandpa’s house instead of merely taking him by the 
hand and leading him there. In such guidance, says Thorndike, 
You must make sure (1) that the youngster knows what place he 
is to try to reach and (2) keeps it in mind. (3) He must also at 
least know that to get to a place [or to solve a problem] you must 
keep going and not lie down and go to sleep; (4) he must have some 
knowledge of the direction in which the house lies and of the roads 
and woods and valley in the neighborhood. 
He starts off correctly and at a crossroad [or alternative in the 
problem] turns to the left. 
“What did you do that for, John?” [asks the guide]. ‘I don’t 
know.” “Where are you going?” “To grandpa’s.” ‘Where does 
that road go?” “To the schoolhouse.” “Is that on the way to 
grandpa’s?” “I don’t know.” “What comes after the schoolhouse 
if you go down this road?” “The church.” “How long does it 
take to go from grandpa’s to the church?” “Oh, a long time.” 
“Is grandpa’s near the church?” “No; it is a long way.” ‘This 
road goes to the church. Is it a good way to go to grandpa’s?” 
If your boy is bright enough, he now turns to the right, but soon 
comes to the end of the road [or the suggestion that is being followed 
in trying to solve the problem]. ‘Where do I go now?” says he. 
“Where do you think?” “I think we go through that field.” ‘Well, 
try it and see.”
-P-A-G-E-332
  
  316 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
You rapidly approach a pond [or discouraging difficulty in the 
problem], and the boy sits down and cries. ‘I can’t find the way to 
grandpa’s.” ‘“What’s the trouble?” “You can’t get around this 
pond, it’s all swampy.” “Do you have to go around it?” “Yes; 
grandpa’s is up there and you have to go around the pond.” “Go 
and look at the pond [or examine the difficulty] and-see if you can re 0? find something that will help you to get to grandpa’s. 
And so on, with constant stimulation to the examination of each 
situation confronted, and with the selection and rejection of ways in 
the light of knowledge of their consequences, until grandpa’s house 
is reached, or until the problem is solved. (12: 150) 
Five specific rules for conducting problem-solving lessons. 
—The general impression of the methods of guiding pupils in 
problem-solving which we derive from this little imaginary story 
may now be formulated into the specific rules given below. 
These rules summarize and definitize most of the points of 
technique brought out in the sample lessons in Section I, 
plus the characteristics of skillful problem-solving described in 
Section III of the discussion. 
1. Define problem.—Aid the pupils to define the problem 
clearly. This rule is important in good individual thinking, but 
is particularly important in group thinking. For example, while 
writing the preceding paragraphs I was disturbed by two well- 
intentioned, intelligent persons who were arguing most vig- 
orously but quite uselessly, because they were talking at cross 
purposes. I said to them: ‘Do you folks realize that you are not 
talking about the same thing? One of you misunderstood what 
the other asserted a moment ago.” Upon a little inquiry my 
statement proved to be true, the parties found themselves in 
perfect agreement, and I could proceed with my work undis- 
turbed. In college debates we find some of our best examples of 
care in defining the question or problem for a group discussion. 
Many hours or days or weeks may be spent in getting the prob- 
lem clearly in mind and giving it such a satisfactory wording 
that definite, profitable debating may be undertaken. In our 
seventh-grade lesson on sugar production we noticed that Miss
-P-A-G-E-333
PROBLEM-SOLVING 317 
Parker had the class formulate a definite proposition as the 
basis of the discussion, and then wrote it on the board so that 
all got it clearly in mind. In our fifth-grade lesson on London 
we found that she had written eight carefully phrased problems 
on the board as the basis of the lesson and that each one that 
needed further defining received it in the discussion. 
2. Keep problem in mind.—Help the pupils to keep the 
problem clearly in mind. This rule is necessitated by the large 
waste of time and energy that results from being sidetracked, 
even after the problem has been clearly defined. “Scatterbrained 
thinking” is.a term to designate thinking that does not hold 
definitely to the question. In deliberative bodies that have good 
rules of procedure one important duty of the presiding officer is 
to hold the discussion to the question before the house and to 
rule out digressions. In the lessons in Section II we saw frequent 
occasions for this procedure; for example, in the second-grade 
lesson a child began to talk about dressing a French doll instead 
of an Arab doll,and in the seventh-grade sugar-production lesson 
the teacher had difficulty in restraining a boy from discussing 
profitableness instead of possibility. Through such guidance the 
pupils learn that “keeping to the question” is a characteristic 
of good thinking. They come to realize this from repeated 
suggestions from the teacher, such as Miss Parker’s remark 
(when the class was discussing the relation of London and the 
Thames), “It is not a good answer unless it shows how London 
is related to the Thames.” 
3. Stimulate suggestions. Analysis, recall, guesses.—Aid 
the pupils to make suggestions by getting them (1) to analyze 
_ the problematic situation into parts, or elements, each of which 
may suggest a solution; (2) to recall previously-experienced 
similar cases or, as in arithmetic and geography, general rules 
that may apply; (3) to formulate from vague guesses definite 
hypotheses or tentative plans. 
Control of one’s own associations is difficult. Galton.—These 
rules are among the most difficult to explain and apply, because 
 
-P-A-G-E-334
  318 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
fertility in suggesting is probably less easily controlled by a 
thinker and, consequently, by a pupil than any other phase of 
thinking. This fact is picturesquely described by the eminent 
English scientist Sir Francis Galton, a member of the noted 
Darwin family and well known as founder of the eugenics move- 
ment. He compares his mind, when solving a problem, to two 
rooms: one an “audience chamber,” in which the main ideas of 
the moment have the floor, and the other an “‘antechamber,” in 
which there is a throng of those ideas that are vaguely present 
in his mind at the time. ‘Successful progress of thought,” he 
says, “seems to depend, first, on a large attendance in the ante- 
chamber. . . . [This] thronging of the antechamber is, I am 
convinced, altogether beyond my control; if the ideas do not 
appear, I cannot create them nor compel them to come.” 
Maneuvers for attracting appropriate suggestions.—While 
Galton’s statement that we cannot compel appropriate ideas or 
suggestions to appear is true, yet we can go through certain 
maneuvers that will tend to attract or arouse or recall them to 
our minds. 
a. Analytic attention focuses upon one element at a time— 
One such maneuver is to proceed to focus our attention on one 
part of the problematic situation at a time. For example, in the 
sugar-production problem the class divided the issue into cane 
production and sugar-beet production and then focused their 
attention on the former. Holding, then, to the problem of grow- 
ing more cane, a host of issues were suggested, such as the 
number of growing-days, competition with Cuban labor, etc. 
Similarly, in fitting the front to the cardboard store in the kin- 
dergarten, attention was focused for a time on the width, and 
suggestions “sprouted” for determining this, for marking straight 
lines by folding, etc. In studying the growth of London the fifth- 
grade class was found breaking the issues up into such problems 
as where the docks would be located, where the warehouses 
would be located, and similar questions relating to factories, 
homes for workers, fine-residence districts, etc.
-P-A-G-E-335
  
PROBLEM-SOLVING 319 
Each focused element brings its suggestions. By dividing we 
conquer.—Thus, by actively dividing a problematic situation 
into certain of its elements, and purposely attending to one of 
these for the time being and neglecting others, we open up many 
sources of suggestion which might not have opened so soon had 
we merely passively regarded the large problem and waited for 
something to happen. The teacher can often help a class over an 
apparently insurmountable difficulty in their problem by merely 
suggesting that they devote their attention to a certain phase 
of it which she mentions, or by naming a number of alternative 
phases, one of which they take up and examine.* 
b. Recalling similar cases and rules that apply. Degrees of as- 
sistance.—Recalling previously-known similar cases or general 
tules that may apply is particularly easy in arithmetic or geog- 
raphy where the material is systematically organized. For ex- 
ample, when asked what conditions must be studied in planning 
to grow sugar cane, a pupil might say to himself, “Let me see— 
what conditions did we take up for growing cotton and corn?” 
Similarly, if the fifth-grade pupils who had studied London should 
later study the growth of New Orleans, they might say, ‘‘Let’s 
see—what were some of the factors we brought out in the case of 
London?” In the case cf mathematics the procedure of recall- 
ing the desired rule is often aided mechanically by turning the 
1The proper location of analysis as a method of control in problem- 
solving has puzzled me more than any feature of this section. Its value is 
quite obvious and has been especially emphasized by William James (see 
his “ Principles of Psychology,” Vol. II, pp. 339-340). Whether (1) to locate 
such purposeful, analytic concentration of attention under rule 3, as one 
means of controlling suggestions, or (2) to give it an independent place 
has been my dilemma. In placing it as a control device under the more 
general heading of stimulating suggestions, I have been guided largely by 
my own experience in solving geometry exercises. In this case, it seems 
to me, I commonly focus my attention on a certain angle or a certain line, 
in hope that it will suggest some further possibilities of procedure. By 
thus controlling our attention we discount somewhat Galton’s point about 
being unable to control the thronging of the antechamber, because the aspect 
attended to will, figuratively speaking, invite its own crowd to the room.
-P-A-G-E-336
  320 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
pages until an appropriate one appears. The practice of looking 
up some related discussion in a book is a device that many 
students and scientists use to start suggestions that may help 
solve the problem. Such systematic recall may*be aided by the 
teacher in various degrees. For example, in the kindergarten the 
teacher may make a very general suggestion, such as “‘How can 
we find out how many hinges a door should have?” or the more 
definite suggestion “What shall we look at to determine how 
many hinges a door should have?” or the very specific sugges- 
tion “Look at the doors in this room to see how many hinges 
we ought to have on our door.” 
c. Guessing. Leaps in the dark definitized as hypotheses — 
Guessing and formulating definite hypotheses from the more 
vague guesses are processes that we found especially emphasized 
in Whewell’s description of scientific procedure. Recently I 
heard a chemist say that for two years he had tried without 
success to obtain a certain reaction in his laboratory. He had 
tried a score of devices in vain. One day, while walking across 
the campus, it occurred to him to try out a procedure that he had 
frequently thought of but had-always mentally discarded be- 
cause it seemed too foolish. He went to his laboratory, tried it, 
and. it proved to be the long-sought method. Provided that 
pupils are seriously concerned with their problems and have a 
fund of related experiences, such courageous guessing—leaps 
into mental darkness—should be encouraged. In class discus- 
sions, in which many such pertinent guesses are rapidly made, 
they may be immediately noted on the blackboard, and then 
the more probable ones taken up and definitely formulated and 
examined to determine their value.* 
1In high-grade scientific investigations this “method of multiple hy- 
potheses” is highly esteemed. Its general character is brought out in the 
following quotation from Dewey (“How We Think,” p, 75): “Suggestion 
is the very heart of inference; it involves going from what is present to* 
something absent. Hence it is more or less speculative, adventurous. Since 
inference goes beyond what is actually present, it involves a leap, a jump, 
the. propriety of which cannot be absolutely warranted in advance, no’  
-P-A-G-E-337
PROBLEM-SOLVING 321 
4. Evaluate suggestions. Open-mindedness, criticism, veri- 
fication.—Encourage pupils to evaluate suggestions carefully 
by getting them (r) to “maintain the state of doubt” (that is, to 
delay their final conclusion and to remain open-minded until the 
matter is finally proved), (2) to criticize thoroughly all sugges- 
tions (that is, to anticipate mentally objections that might be 
made to them or consequences that might follow), (3) to verify 
suggestions and conclusions by reference to facts as revealed 
in ordinary experience or in miniature experiments or in stand- 
ard scientific treatises. The subdivisions of this rule we found 
especially emphasized in the last paragraph from Dewey at the 
close of Section III. 
a. Maintain state of doubt. Avoid pugnacious, stubborn argu- 
ment.—The rule about suspending judgment defines the general 
spirit that should prevail in the class and in the mind of each 
“inquirer. It raises an interesting question concerning the amount 
of argument that should be permitted in classes. While argument 
may be very stimulating to thought and interest, the spirit of 
argument is often just the opposite of the spirit of open-minded 
inquiry. Argument is often closely akin to fighting: the more 
your opponent hits you, the harder—and frequently the more 
blindly —you hit back. I have seen pugnacious, argumentative 
boys in upper-grade classes who cared nothing about careful 
evaluation of their suggestions, but were concerned merely to 
maintain these at all costs. Where such a spirit is allowed to 
become strong in a class, the opportunities for training in im- 
partial, open-minded, scientific inquiry are jeopardized. The 
teacher should herself be a model of impartiality in inquiry ; she 
should make this the dominant spirit of the teaching and should 
matter what precautions be taken. Synonyms for this are supposition, con- 
jecture, guess, hypothesis, and (in elaborate cases) theory. Since sus- 
pended belief, or the postponement of a final conclusion pending further 
evidence, depends partly upon the presence of rival conjectures as to the 
best course to pursue or the probable explanation to favor, cultivation 
of a variety of alternative suggestions is an important factor in good 
thinking.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-338
  322 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
train each pupil to esteem fair-minded search after truth as a 
high ideal and a desirable personal attribute. 
b. Acquire the attitude of criticizing suggestions. Anticipate 
objections and consequences.—Teaching students to criticize— 
to anticipate mentally possible objections to, and consequences 
of, a suggestion or schheme—appears as the notable feature of the 
work of certain teachers. The actual calling to mind of specific 
criticisms is a matter of fertility of suggestion, but the general 
attitude of testing mentally each suggestion before adopting it 
can be maintained even in cases where one may be unsuccessful 
in calling to mind specific objections and consequences. 
c. Verify by known conditions, miniature experiments, and 
scientific treatises.—Closely related to this mental testing is 
the verification of suggestions and conclusions by reference to 
known facts as revealed in our ordinary experience or in stand- 
ard scientific treatises. For example, in the kindergarten con- 
struction lesson a child who wanted to have only one hinge on 
a door should have felt that this was probably undesirable after 
examining a number of doors and finding none with one hinge. 
Of course, he might have tried one hinge and found that it 
would not work. Wherever possible, however, in social life, 
people try to avoid an expensive, poorly conceived experiment 
if it is possible to determine in advance, from facts already 
known, that it will be a failure. Often scientific experimen- 
tation in a laboratory consists in carrying on some process in 
miniature, or on a small scale, to see if it will work. In pri- 
mary construction classes a similar practice is often followed by 
letting one child try out a suggestion before others of the class 
adopt it. As further examples of the process of verifying sug- 
gestions, we found the pupils in the Arab-doll lesson referring to 
standard pictures of Arab life to verify some of their plans for 
the Arab costumes; and in the sugar-production lesson we 
found the teacher provided with a report of the Department of 
Agriculture and a special scientific treatise on sugar, to use in 
checking up the conclusions that the pupils reached.
-P-A-G-E-339
  PROBLEM-SOLVING 323 
5. Keep discussion organized. Outlines, graphs, summa- 
ries.—Help the pupils to keep the discussion organized by pro- 
ceeding (a) to build an outline of the main ideas on the board 
as they appear in the discussion ; (b) to use diagrams and graphs 
for condensing fundamental facts and relations into a simple 
picture; (c) to take stock from time to time by summarizing 
the ground covered and the next steps to be taken; (d) to for- 
mulate from time to time, as definite propositions, the net out- 
come of the discussion. 
These last rules are very objective and easy to understand and 
illustrate. We found an example of building an outline on the 
blackboard in the sugar-production lesson, of the effective use 
of a graph to summarize the sugar situation in the same lesson, 
and of a diagram to clarify and summarize the development of 
London in the fifth-grade lesson. We found the second-grade 
class taking stock of their plans for the Arab costume, and the 
fifth-grade class summarizing their facts about the relation of 
London and the Thames. The concise formulation of definite 
propositions containing the net outcome of the discussion oc- 
curred several times in the sugar-production and London lessons. 
Summary of rules for conducting problem-solving les- 
sons.—The five major rules with their subdivisions presented 
above describe many, if not most, of the special practices that 
should characterize a teacher’s guidance of pupils during a prob- 
lem-solving lesson. They may be summarized in more concise 
form in the following statement : 
To stimulate and assist pupils in reflective problem-solving the 
teacher should 
1. Get them to define the problem clearly. 
2. Aid them to keep the problem in mind. 
3. Get them to make many suggestions by encouraging them 
a. To analyze the situation into parts. 
6. To recall previously-known similar cases and general rules that 
apply. 
c. To guess courageously and formulate guesses clearly. 
 
-P-A-G-E-340
  324 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
4. Get them to evaluate each suggestion carefully by encouraging them 
a. To maintain a state of doubt or suspended conclusion. 
b. To criticize the suggestion by anticipating objections and con- 
sequences. 
c. To verify conclusions by appeal to known facts, miniature ex- 
periments, and scientific treatises. 
5. Get them to organize the material by proceeding 
a. To build an outline on the board. 
b. To use diagrams and graphs. 
c. To take stock from time to time. 
d. To formulate concise statements of the net outcome of the 
discussion. . 
Primary education no longer mere arbitrary memoriza- 
tion.—The type of training summarized in the foregoing rules 
differs greatly from that which prevailed in many schools a gen- 
eration ago and which was seriously advocated by a prominent 
American writer on education as late as 1904, when he said that 
the age before twelve is the age for “arbitrary memorization, 
drill and habituation, with little appeal to the children’s interest 
or understanding.” Such a theory was based on the assumption 
that young children cannot succeed in reflective problem-solving. 
It requires little observation to show that young children solve 
their problems by the same processes of making and evaluating 
suggestions that ordinary adults use. The great growth that may 
be made by pupils in reflective ability, through providing oppor- 
tunities from the kindergarten up, appears when one contrasts 
the recitations observed in the upper grades of an old-fashioned 
memorizing school with those in the same grades of a progressive 
school in which problem-solving methods prevail in construction, 
expression, history, geography, and other subjects. In such a 
progressive school pupils in the upper grades are prepared to 
attack technical problems, such as increasing American sugar 
production, in the effective manner described in this chapter 
and with a mastery of technical devices of research and inquiry 
not possessed even by some adults who have had a college 
education.
-P-A-G-E-341
  PROBLEM-SOLVING 325 
Both routine drill and problem-solving have a place.— 
Let us hasten to say, however, that this emphasis on problem- 
solving should not lead to a neglect of routine drill of the type 
that prevails in the modern scientific teaching of handwriting, 
spelling, reading, and arithmetic. The necessity of such drill has 
been amply demonstrated in scientific investigations, and its 
presence in the school need not interfere at all with the adequate 
organization of problem-solving. Both may proceed on the same 
day without mutual interference; for example, during the hand- 
writing and spelling periods the most intense, gameful, effective 
drills may be carried on with little or no problem activity, while 
in some of the history and geography periods the most intense 
reflective problem-solving may prevail. 
Reasoning not incompatible with routine or imitation.—The 
fact that reasoning is not incompatible with routine or with 
imitation has been most effectively demonstrated by Professor 
E. L. Thorndike in an article entitled “Education for Initiative 
and Originality.” (15.) Some of his evidence is contained in 
the following quotation: 
During the past month I have been studying the ratings of sixty 
electrical engineers employed by the Westinghouse Company and rated 
by the company’s officers for originality and seventeen other qualities, 
such as thoroughness, knowledge, industry at routine tasks, and the 
like. Far from there being any antagonism between originality and 
industry at routine tasks, or between originality and common sense, 
or between originality and system, there is a positive correlation, and 
one as close as that between industry and enthusiasm or that be- 
tween thoroughness and system. 
The truly independent thinker does not make less use of other 
men’s ideas than [does] the servile thinker, but more. The expert man 
of science or law or business has a thousand masters, while the servile 
mind has but a few. The truly independent thinker does not put less 
faith in his masters than [does] the servile mind. He puts more faith 
in them, but he chooses the right ones to put his faith in. The 
servile mind has faiths that seem strong only because he never ques- 
tions them. His faith in Jones’s liver pills or the divine right of kings
-P-A-G-E-342
  326 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
is really at the mercy of any new quack or Napoleon. In fact, a 
good definition of intellectual independence is “reasoned dependence.” 
The truly initiating mind does not imitate less, but more. It 
imitates more men, in more fields, in a greater variety of conditions. 
But here again it is reasoned imitation ; and out of multifarious rea- 
soned imitatings comes—to him who has the capacity, [who has] 
insight to discern, and the zeal to take—the profitable risk, the 
hopeful leap in the dark, the courageous step upward where no foot- 
hold may be found. (15: 407) 
Give both habits and standards of good thinking.—Such 
training in problem-solving should not only give pupils greater 
skill in solving problems along special lines, such as construction 
or geography, but it should also make them eventually clearly 
aware of what the attributes of good thinking are. For example, 
we suggested that pupils should come to esteem open-minded, 
impartial, suspended judgment as an ideal, as a personal attribute 
which they desire to possess. Similarly, we suggested that they 
learn to be on their guard to hold to the question under discus- 
sion. Again, we might have noted under rule 5 that pupils 
should learn to appreciate the value of outlines, graphs, diagrams, 
and summaries as aids to effective thinking, and consciously 
strive to use these when appropriate occasions offer. 
“Cultivating originality.” What does it mean?—The fore- 
going discussion helps us to define clearly what we mean by 
“cultivating originality,” a phrase that is extensively but often 
vaguely used in many educational discussions. Very commonly 
such discussions consist merely of vicious attacks upon drill, 
routine, memorizing, and imitation, with strenuous appeals to 
rid the schools of these and to substitute, instead, training in 
originality and initiative. We have called attention in the pre- 
ceding paragraphs to the fallacy of this position. So confused, 
however, is the issue concerning the proper balancing of reflec- 
tive, original thinking, on the one hand, and routine drill and 
imitation, on the other, that we shall note a few more points 
concerning it.
-P-A-G-E-343
  
PROBLEM-SOLVING 327 
Capacity for original thinking is inborn, varies between in- 
dividuals, and is often specialized.—In trying to render our 
discussion concrete we may think of Edison, Darwin, Newton, 
and other great originators and inventors as typifying great ca- 
pacity for original thinking. At the opposite extreme we have the 
feeble-minded, many of whom may be able to learn such rou- 
tine tasks as washing dishes or dusting, but none of whom have 
much ability to solve problems. It is perfectly clear from scien- 
tific studies of geniuses and the feeble-minded that the differ- 
ences between them are due to inner characteristics of the 
individuals, usually inherited characteristics. These differences 
cannot be overcome by training. You cannot make an Edison 
out of a feeble-minded person. In the intermediate ranks as 
well, between the original geniuses and the feeble-minded, the 
capacity for original thinking is determined by the individual’s 
native endowment: if he is well endowed by nature he may 
become a skilled thinker; if he is poorly endowed the best 
training will still leave him a poor thinker. Moreover, his ca- 
pacity for original thinking may be specialized; for example, a 
boy may prove quite ingenious in devising mechanical appli- 
ances, but fail in working original problems in mathematics. 
Similarly, a person may rank high in the capacity for original 
thinking in mathematics, but fail in making original compo- 
sitions in music, or writing original poems, or devising original 
plots for novels. For our present purposes it is sufficient if we 
can get the teacher to think of each pupil as possessing a certain 
amount of native capacity or incapacity for original thinking. 
Her task is to cultivate each pupil’s capacity quite specifically. 
If he is brilliantly original in geography give him large opportu- 
nities; if he is rather stupid and unoriginal in geography give 
him some small, easy problems that will give practice for what 
little talent he possesses. If he is capable in mathematical rea- 
soning, cultivate his originality there. In every case treat each 
pupil sympathetically so as to develop such talents as he does 
possess for the good of himself and society.  
-P-A-G-E-344
  328 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
The pupil must succeed in order to improve.—Such sym- 
pathetic treatment may be further justified by the scientific fact 
that in any type of learning a pupil learns through his successes. 
It is the successful performances, not the unsuccessful ones, that 
establish the correct habits in solving problems and doing origi- 
nal thinking, just as in learning spelling or handwriting. A 
pupil who never succeeds in solving an original problem will 
not learn to solve original problems. Owing to the fact that 
problem-solving, as a rule, necessarily involves erroneous guesses 
and the testing of these, the teacher is confronted with a very 
delicate task in determining just how difficult the problems 
should be for each pupil, and just how much aid to give him in 
order that he may succeed and yet be required to do sufficient 
mental experimentation to secure the necessary practice. 
Standardized, graded, printed problems with teachers’ 
manuals.— Great help will be afforded in this dilemma when we 
have developed in each grade, for each subject, standardized, 
ready-made, published problems varying from easy ones, for 
the dull pupils, to those of sufficient difficulty to challenge the 
ability of the best thinkers in the class. We noticed how Miss 
Parker was engaged in devising such problems with the nec- 
essary data for fifth-grade geography. (For other examples see 
references 1, 4, and 5 at the end of this chapter.) However, 
the mere possession of such suitable ready-made problems in 
itself will not assure profitable problem-solving activity by the 
pupils. This fact is illustrated by the frequent mechanical 
teaching of arithmetic (even when the class possesses excel- 
lent textbooks) owing to the lack of skill on the part of the 
teacher, who reduces the pupils’ activities to mere unintelligent 
“ciphering.” Hence, while well-made printed problems in geog- 
raphy, history, civics, and other subjects will greatly assist 
inexperienced teachers to adopt problem-solving methods, the 
successful use of the latter will depend upon a thorough mastery 
of the technique of teaching which we have described in this 
chapter. Fortunately teachers’ manuals in the various subjects
-P-A-G-E-345
  
PROBLEM-SOLVING 329 
are now being published which contain detailed instructions for 
helping teachers to use problem-solving methods in connection 
with particular textbooks in geography, arithmetic, and other 
subjects. When these manuals have become as refined in their 
suggestions as arethe manuals for teaching beginning reading (de- 
scribed on page 124), we may hope for much wider successful 
use of problem-solving methods by teachers in various subjects. 
Individual solutions during supervised study.—The pos- 
session of printed, standardized, graded problems in the various 
subjects will also make it possible for pupils individually to 
puzzle out the solutions during supervised study periods, as they 
frequently do in arithmetic. Such practice should supplement 
the training in group discussions of problems which we have 
illustrated at length in this chapter. 
Individual differences. Vary recitations for the timid, the 
aggressive, the slow, the impulsive, etc.—In the problem-solving 
recitation the teacher must provide for individual differences by 
calling on pupils according to their capacities and temperaments. 
For example, for the dull pupils, those who have little native 
capacity, she will save the easiest questions, remembering that 
they need to succeed in order to profit. The slow but capable 
thinkers will be taken care of by slowing up the pace frequently 
for their especial benefit. The timid but capable thinker will be 
watched carefully, and probably given at first easy questions 
that can be answered in a few words. As he acquires confidence 
from his successful answers to these, he may eventually lose his 
timidity in this particular class. The impulsive thinker, who 
does not stop to evaluate his suggestion before popping it out, 
will need to be restrained, possibly by promising to ignore him if 
he continues wildly to make suggestions, but to favor him after 
he has made a well-considered one. The argumentative quibbler 
will need his spirit changed by being made to realize that the 
class does not care for his pugnacious, stubborn adherence to 
a suggestion, but will welcome him if he really tries to aid in an 
impartial inquiry for the true solution. 
 
-P-A-G-E-346
330 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
Group solution of large problems often overlooks the timid 
and slow.—It is in problem-solving which centers in large group 
undertakings that the teacher needs particularly to be self- 
possessed and resourceful in providing for individual differences. 
For example, one sixth-grade class spent twelve weeks on the 
topic “Ships and shipbuilding.” In carrying on their work the 
pupils undertook a variety of problems of an expressional char- 
acter. In such teaching the more capable pupils exhibit so much 
talent in planning and devising things to do that they are likely 
to monopolize the interest of the teacher, leaving little or noth- 
ing of a problem type for the slow or the timid pupils. This fact 
led Miss Parker, who had organized this twelve weeks’ unit, to 
emphasize the fact, as we noted above, that in many problem- 
solving lessons the slow pupils are left out of the game. 
Conclusion of chapter on problem-solving.—We opened 
this chapter with an account of the part played by problem- 
solving in social life. We found both practical and speculative 
problems interesting children and adults. We found problems of 
many types, such as mechanical, diplomatic, moral, esthetic, 
mathematical, etc. In Section II we presented in detail four 
actual lessons which gave us concrete pictures of the conversa- 
tional reflective activity that prevails in skillfully conducted 
problem-solving discussion lessons. In Section III we showed 
how great problem-solvers think. We found them making many 
suggestions, evaluating these carefully and discarding the errone- 
ous ones, and maintaining an unbiased, impartial attitude in 
their conclusions. From Sections II and III we derived a number 
of rules for training pupils in problem-solving, which we pre- 
sented in Section IV. We suggest that the reader learn the sum- 
mary of these rules as given on page 323 and then, with concrete 
pictures of the actual lessons given in Section II, plan to under- 
take, at least occasionally, to conduct problem-solving lessons in 
her own teaching. We prophesy that if she is a good thinker her- 
self, she will find great pleasure in trying to develop skill in this 
important type of artistic teaching.

  CHAPTER XI 
SKILLFUL SILENT READING 
Main points of the chapter.—1. The large amount of reading 
matter that Americans can purchase for twenty-five cents illustrates 
the great opportunities for silent reading in this country. 
2. The need for skill in such reading is shown by the manner in 
which it contributes to improve health, afford recreation, and in- 
crease good will and social service. 
3. In order to grow in skill in silent reading, a pupil needs an in- 
terest in it, a stock of experiences and ideas with which to interpret 
what he reads, a large, automatic reading vocabulary, and practice in 
various types of cursory reading and studious reading. 
4. Some second-grade and seventh-grade lessons are described at 
length to illustrate the special technique of organizing practice in 
silent reading. 
5. These are followed by a systematic description of examples of 
silent-reading exercises of many types, including cursory newspaper- 
reading, the detailed analysis of arithmetic problems, the determi- 
nation of the truth of historical statements, etc. 
Third “thoughtful process” of Part IJ.—‘“Skillful silent 
reading” is the third of the “four thoughtful processes” to be 
considered in Part II of this book. The two discussed in the pre- 
ceding chapters were “understanding social life” and “problem- 
solving, or practice in thinking.” Our study of the part 
played by these two in a progressive elementary school gave us 
some impression of the rich intellectual life which prevails 
there and of the sympathetic insight into contemporary civili- 
zation which the pupils receive. It seemed desirable to give this 
impression before discussing silent reading, since the organi- 
zation of the latter depends so much upon the opportunities 
provided for acquiring ideas and solving problems in history, 
biography, community life, geography, literature, and science.

SKILLFUL SILENT READING 333 
Training in silent reading is also bound up with our discussion 
of forming habits of enjoying leisure (which is to be discussed 
in Chapter XIV), as will be brought out in Section I of the 
present chapter. 
Review. of Chapters V and VI, on reading.—As an ele- 
mentary skill, beginning reading was thoroughly discussed in 
Chapter V. The two big ideas presented there were (1) that 
pupils should be taught reading, from the start, as a process of 
acquiring interesting, meaningful experiences, and (2) that prac- 
tice in phonetic analysis makes them independent and accurate 
in recognizing new words. 
By the end of the second grade the brightest pupil, we found, 
could read easy new material more rapidly than he could clearly 
enunciate the words. This relation between silent reading and 
oral reading. was canvassed scientifically in Chapter VI along 
with other problems. Our principal practical conclusions in that 
chapter were (1) that silent reading requires special practice, 
(2) that phonetic training is desirable to make accurate readers, 
(3) that the difficulties of poor readers can be scientifically 
diagnosed and remedial measures prescribed, and (4) that skill- 
ful silent reading is active selective thinking, often closely related 
to acquiring ideas and solving problems. This last point led us to 
postpone the special discussion of silent reading until we had 
studied the processes of acquiring ideas and solving problems. 
Divisions of the present chapter.— We are now prepared to 
proceed with the discussion of training pupils to be skillful silent 
readers. We shall organize this discussion under the following 
main headings: 
I. Social opportunities and need for skillful silent reading (p. 334). 
II. What a pupil needs in acquiring skill in silent reading (p. 340). 
III. Practice exercises in silent reading (p. 351). 
A. Sample lessons from second and seventh grades (p. 352). 
B. Systematic description of devices (p. 367). 
1. Developing interest (p. 367). 
2. Giving ideas and meanings for interpreting reading 
(p. 370).

Section I. SoctaL OpporTUNITIES AND NEED FOR 
SKILLFUL SILENT READING 
Opportunities. Weekly periodicals. Ninety large magazine 
pages a week delivered at your door for four cents.—The op- 
portunities for silent reading may be illustrated by ascertain- 
ing how much high-grade reading matter can be purchased for 
twenty-five cents a week. To begin with, our leading weekly 
magazine, which advertises its sales as “more than two million 
and a quarter weekly,” can be purchased for five cents ; or if the 
annual subscription rate of two dollars is paid, the weekly cost is 
less than four cents. For this amount even a remote resident on 
a rural mail-delivery route may receive weekly (when the coun- 
try is prosperous and magazines are flourishing) about ninety 
pages of reading matter plus ninety pages of advertising. The 
stories and articles in a single number would fill about five hun- 
dred pages similar in size to the pages of this book. This amount 
is almost equivalent to two complete recent novels which I hap- 
pen to have at hand. Thus for four cents a week the postman 
will deliver to you the equivalent of about two popular books a 
week, or about one hundred books a year. The following table 
of contents from one week’s issue is typical of this weekly four 
cents’ worth of contemporary literature:

Famous story-contributors fascinate even literary profes- 
sors.—If you are familiar with contemporary writers you will 
recognize among these contributors some of the most skilled 
and generally pleasing, such as Irvin Cobb, Harold MacGrath, 
and Emerson Hough. While the ‘just for fun” story material is 
especially prominent, you will note also discussions of serious 
topics, such as “Siberian Impressions,” ““How Many are Des- 
titute in Europe?” “The Philippine Situation.” Moreover, we 
must not forget the additional ninety pages of advertising mat- 
ter, in which the pictures are often especially fascinating to cer- 
tain readers. Finally, lest you may feel that such reading is not 
very creditable, let me say that I have watched one of our most
-P-A-G-E-352
336 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
literary university professors of English absolutely absorbed 
and fascinated in reading an issue of this magazine, and have 
heard that one of our most brilliant classical professors, who is 
a voracious reader, devours every day one novel such as those 
by Harold MacGrath. 
An additional eight cents a week brings review of the world 
affairs.—For an additional ten cents a week you may purchase 
copies of one of our leading weekly reviews which summa- 
rizes the discussions of all types of contemporary problems. If 
you pay the annual subscription price of four dollars, your 
weekly cost is about eight cents. In prosperous times an issue 
of this magazine contains from eighty to one hundred pages 
and is about one half advertising matter. Thus for eight cents 
a week the postman will deliver to you full discussions of 
contemporary politics, foreign affairs, art, literature, religion, 
science, etc. A detailed picture of the contents of one issue of 
this magazine was given at the beginning of our chapter on un- 
derstanding social life (pp. 175-176), where we used it to pre- 
sent a cross section of contemporary life and civilization. 
Ten to twenty hours of high-grade reading matter for twelve 
cents.—These two opportunities for securing reading matter 
may be summarized as follows (if we omit the advertising) : 
go large magazine pages of fiction etc.1. . . . 4centsa week 
40 smaller magazine pages of reviews . . . . 8centsa week

1The fact that so much reading matter can be obtained for such a 
small sum is due to the high prices paid for advertising in the very popu- 
lar periodicals. Thus, in the “‘Americanization of Edward Bok” (p. 421), 
it is stated that in October, 1919, the magazine that Bok edited sold 
2,000,000 copies and carried $1,000,000 worth of advertisements. If we 
estimate that each copy sold for fifteen cents, we find that the whole 
issue sold for only $300,000, while the advertisements in it paid the pub- 
lishers $1,000,000. This fact explains why popular magazines diminish 
greatly in size when hard times prevail and business firms curtail their 
advertising. 
 
-P-A-G-E-353
SKILLFUL SILENT READING 337 
For this amount the postman will deliver to you weekly 
enough excellent fiction and serious reading matter to occupy 
an ordinary reader twenty hours, or a fairly fast reader about 
ten hours. In a home this material would, of course, be available 
not merely for one reader but for several. 
Great metropolitan papers delivered for a few cents a week.— 
We still have left thirteen cents from the original twenty-five 
which we planned to invest in high-grade reading matter as a 
means of illustrating the opportunities for silent reading that pre- 
vail today. Before the World War this balance would have pur- 
chased in the larger cities a daily and a Sunday paper for a week. 
At the present writing it would not suffice for this purpose, but it 
would bring through the mails either a daily or a Sunday metro- 
politan paper. Unfortunately many of my readers who live 
remote from our largest cities do not realize what wonderful 
collections of reading matter are issued by the great metropoli- 
tan papers. The Sunday editions of these papers are complete 
magazines, while even the daily editions contain masterly dis- 
cussions of events transpiring in all parts of the world. 
Thus the American public enjoys rich opportunities for silent 
reading.—Thus by discussing merely periodical literature we 
have shown that for a few dollars a year every household that is 
reached by the United States mail may be supplied with enough 
excellent reading matter to engage the leisure time of most adult 
workers. Such periodical literature contains much of the best 
that is published—the stories being most fascinatingly told, and 
the serious articles often being written by well-qualified experts. 
We might go further and describe the excellent library facilities 
that exist in many communities, and other opportunities for 
securing material for reading, but we have probably already 
said enough to make clear the fact that the American public 
enjoys such rich opportunities for silent reading that every 
family that can afford to spend twenty-five cents a week may be 
well supplied. Having thus canvassed the opportunities, let us 
now turn to the need for skillful silent reading.
-P-A-G-E-354
  
338 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
Social need for skillful silent reading. Relation to broad 
educational aims.—The social need for skillful silent reading 
may be demonstrated under all the broad, fundamental social 
aims of teaching. In the author’s ‘General Methods of Teaching” 
these aims have been formulated as follows: 
. Good health 
. Harmless enjoyment of leisure time 
. Good will 
. Social service 
a. Business service 
b. Home service 
c. Civic service 
Rod 
H 
1. Scientific health articles combat quackery and superstition. 
—The social need for skillful silent reading in order to improve 
health is illustrated in the daily press by the articles relative to 
health which are now a constant feature. For example, in the 
Chicago Tribune we find in Dr. Evans’s excellent articles recent 
discussions of the following topics: the stages of a cold; the 
health of teeth; the amount of sleep needed at different ages ; 
improvement in typhoid rates in cities. In the smaller cities the 
daily papers frequently contain syndicated health articles as 
well as discussions contributed by the United States Health 
Service and other health agencies. The contrast between these 
scientific health articles and the advertisements of fraudulent 
“patent” medicines is very striking. The need of training per- 
sons so that they can read easily and intelligently the scien- 
tific articles and discover the fallacies and falsehoods in many 
patent-medicine discussions illustrates the desirability of train- 
ing pupils in active analytic, reflective reading in school. 
2. Enjoyment of reading enriches the harmless enjoyment of 
leisure.—Attaining the second broad social aim—namely, 
harmless enjoyment of leisure time—is also greatly facilitated 
by skill in silent reading. Among educated Americans reading 
is probably the most common method of enjoying leisure, yet 
there are many adults and children who miss the joys so close
-P-A-G-E-355
SKILLFUL SILENT READING 339 
at hand merely because they cannot read well enough to grasp 
them. Hence one of the easiest ways of greatly increasing the 
enjoyment of leisure is to train all pupils in the elementary 
schools to be facile silent readers. 
3- Good will may be increased by broad-minded, unbiased 
reading.—The third broad social aim—namely, good will— 
is greatly dependent upon a broad mutual understanding and 
sympathy, to which wide reading of many types contributes. 
The enormous influence of such reading, when ill-directed, 
is shown in the extremely vicious and narrow views of those 
who read on only one side of a controversy; for example, 
reading either a rabid Republican or a rabid Democratic paper. 
During a political campaign, if you read one partisan paper you 
may decide that a certain candidate is almost a god, whereas 
if you read a newspaper of the opposing party you might con- 
clude he is the greatest of villains. To develop intelligent good 
will, pupils should be trained to read skillfully on both sides 
of a public controversy, to detect personal animus, to suspend 
judgment, to balance arguments, and finally to decide for the 
right. This is only one way in which skillful silent reading may 
contribute to the development of good will. In a later chapter, 
on moral ideals and habits, we shall note other ways in which 
reading contributes to the realization of this educational aim. 
4. Efficient social service is facilitated by skillful technical 
reading.—Finally, it is easily shown that skill in silent reading 
contributes to the three forms of social service which constitute 
the fourth broad social aim of teaching. For each technical line 
of business—law, medicine, engineering, brokerage, farming, 
etc.—there is much technical reading to be done. Recent devel- 
opments in scientific farming furnish striking examples, since 
the isolation of many farmers makes them especially dependent 
upon agricultural bulletins and magazines for progressive im- 
provements in farm practice and marketing. The second type 
of social service—namely, that of the home—is also greatly 
aided by skillful silent reading of cookbooks and of magazines  
-P-A-G-E-356
340 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
on good housekeeping, in which suggestions abound for feeding 
the family, decorating the home, and caring for the health and 
education of the children. As for civic service, it has long been 
recognized that intelligent reading of public discussions is the 
best and most influential guide. Hence in recent revolutions 
in Europe one of the first acts of the revolutionists has been 
to seize all printing establishments and repress all newspapers 
except those favorable to their cause. 
Social opportunities and needs for skillful silent reading con- 
cluded.—Thus we see that the enormously enriched oppor- 
tunities for silent reading offered by American life parallel 
corresponding needs for such reading in order to secure good 
health, harmless enjoyment of leisure, good will, and social serv- 
ice. Ina later section we shall show how progressive elementary 
schools endeavor to provide equally abundant opportunities for 
silent reading in order to give sufficient practice to develop the 
habits and skill in such reading which we have found to be so 
valuable a feature of contemporary American social life. Before 
examining the opportunities which a progressive school offers, 
however, we shall canvass the needs of pupils in school in acquir- 
ing skill in silent reading. Then, with the social needs and pupils’ 
individual needs for silent reading both in mind, we can better 
understand the opportunities which a progressive school provides. 
Section IJ. Wuat A PupPiIL NEEDS IN ACQUIRING 
SKILL IN SILENT READING 
1. Intense interest in reading. Makes practice effective. 
—One of the first needs of a pupil who is to acquire skill in 
silent reading is an interest in reading. Even in the less complex 
forms of skill, such as learning to spell or to play baseball or to 
knit, the presence of an intense interest in the activity has been 
found particularly helpful. In such a complex process as reading, 
in which many hours and years of practice are required to attain 
skill, little progress will be made by the pupil who must be con- 
 
-P-A-G-E-357
  SKILLFUL SILENT READING 341 
tinually driven to the task. If, on the contrary, reading appears 
to him as fascinating as playing a game, or doing something else 
that he greatly enjoys, he will practice it frequently with the 
alertness and energy that are so helpful in any learning process. 
In our chapter on beginning reading (pp. 72-124) we described 
a playful introduction to reading in the first grade through kin- 
dergarten games, nursery rimes, and fairy tales, which makes 
reading seem one of the most delightful of activities to children. 
In the first and second grades skillful teachers have many suc- 
cessful devices to maintain this interest. In the middle and upper 
grades similar devices must be provided. 
Adventure, problem-solving, and other interests utilized.— 
The general lines along which these devices may be developed 
are suggested by the list of instinctive interests which we con- 
sidered at length in the chapter on understanding social life 
(p. 216). For story-reading, appeal to the instinctive inter- 
est in adventure and romance will attract most children to 
read fairy tales and such books as ““Tom Sawyer,” “Treasure 
Island,” etc. For the more studious types of reading, devices 
must be used to appeal to the instinctive interest in problem- 
solving, communication, manipulation, physical activity, collect- 
ing, imitative play, games, and emulation and to the desire for 
social approval. In our chapter on understanding social life we 
have already seen how historical reading may be stimulated by 
some of these interests, and in a later section of this chapter we 
shall report further examples. 
2. Experiences, ideas, and meanings needed for interpreta- 
tion.—A second need of the pupil who is to acquire skill in silent 
reading is a store of experiences, ideas, and meanings with which 
to interpret what he reads. I was especially impressed with this 
fact in connection with my son’s reading of historical fiction 
and biography at the age of twelve (as described on pages 217— 
221). At the same age the most advanced reading which I could 
easily do included such books as Alger’s “Ragged Dick” and 
Castleman’s ‘“‘Frank on the Gunboat.” I did not attain ability
-P-A-G-E-358
  342 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
to read Dumas’s “Three Musketeers” easily until I had entered 
high school and had had some instruction in European history. 
As for historical biography, I remember trying to read Irving’s 
“Life of Washington,” of which we had a copy at home. It was 
quite beyond me both in ideas and vocabulary. Yet at the same 
age of twelve my son was able to read the early volumes with 
ease, thanks to the excellent historical course which he had 
enjoyed in the elementary school and which had given him the 
necessary historical ideas for interpreting Irving’s language. 
3. Vocabulary of ten thousand words automatically rec- 
ognized.— The third need of a pupil who is to be a skilled silent 
reader is a large reading vocabulary ; that is, such familiarity with 
some ten thousand printed words that he recognizes each auto- 
matically at sight, without hesitation. In highly skilled silent 
reading the reader should be perfectly free to concentrate his 
attention upon the meanings that the phrases, sentences, and 
paragraphs present and should seldom have to hesitate to puzzle 
out a word. To attain this automatic familiarity with words 
calls for a very large amount of reading matter and reading 
practice. It is not enough that a word be deciphered and read 
once. Usually it must be met several times in order to make 
its recognition automatic. Hence progressive schools endeavor 
to provide an abundance of reading matter to facilitate such 
automatizing of a large reading vocabulary. 
The ten thousand most common words.—A scientific basis 
for determining what words should be included in the pupil’s 
automatic reading vocabulary was provided in 1921 by the pub- 
lication of E. L. Thorndike’s “'Teacher’s Word Book,” which 
he describes as follows: 
The “Teacher’s Word Book” is an alphabetical list of the 10,000 
words which are found to occur most widely in a count of about 
625,000 words from literature for children; about 3,000,000 words 
from the Bible and English classics; about 300,000 words from 
elementary-school textbooks; about 50,000 words from books about 
cooking, sewing, farming, the trades, and the like; about 90,000 
 
-P-A-G-E-359
  
SKILLFUL SILENT READING 343 
words from the daily newspapers ; and about 500,000 words from cor- 
respondence.... A measure of the range and frequency of each word’s 
occurrence is given by the credit number following it. (12: iii) 
It will probably not be long before such a standard reading 
vocabulary as Thorndike has listed will be made the basis of 
published systems for teaching this vocabulary, just as the 
spelling vocabulary of some three thousand common words has 
been made the basis of numerous recent spelling books. 
Thus we have considered three needs of the pupil who is 
acquiring skill in silent reading: (1) an interest in reading; 
(2) a stock of experiences, ideas, and meanings with which to 
interpret what he reads ; (3) a vocabulary of thousands of words 
which he recognizes automatically. 
4. Practice in both cursory and studious reading.—The 
fourth need of a pupil who is to acquire skill in silent reading 
is abundant practice in the two principal types of silent read- 
ing; namely, (1) cursory, unreflective, nonstudious reading and 
(2) reflective, studious reading. We shall describe briefly the 
nature and value of each of these types as a preparation for a 
later discussion of special practice devices for each kind. 
a, Cursory, unreflective, nonstudious reading. Fiction.— 
The nature of this type of reading may be easily illustrated by 
the mental processes involved in reading fiction. For example, 
imagine yourself reading Scott’s “Abbot” at the point where 
the young hero, Roland, had caught a glimpse of his lady love, 
Catherine Seyton, on the streets of Edinburgh and pursued her 
until she entered a strange, ancient mansion. Boldly he opened 
the door and followed, but soon found himself in trouble. 
A little recalled to sober thought by an appearance of serious dan- 
ger, he was deliberating whether he should stand fast or retire, when 
Catherine Seyton reéntered from a side door, running toward him 
with as much speed as a few minutes since she had fled from him. 
“Oh, what mischief brought you hither?” she said. ‘Fly—fly, or 
you are a dead man,—or stay—they come—flight is impossible— 
say you came to ask for Lord Seyton.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-360
  344. TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
She sprang from him and disappeared through the door by which 
she had made her second appearance ; and, at the same instant, a 
pair of large folding doors at the upper end of the gallery flew open 
with vehemence, and six or seven young gentlemen, richly dressed, 
pressed forward into the apartment, having, for the greater part, 
their swords drawn. 
“Who is it,” said one, “dare intrude on us in our own mansion?” 
“Cut him to pieces,” said another; “let him pay for this day’s 
insolence and violence. . . .” 
Enjoyment of rapid action, or of pictures or personalities.—In 
reading such material you may hasten along as fast as possible 
in order to enjoy the thrill of the action and ascertain the out- 
come of the hero’s adventures. You may become impatient of 
all delay and skip descriptions that are not necessary to an 
understanding of the action; for example, while reading “The 
Abbot” near the point described above I impatiently skipped 
most of these words : 
. a paved court, decorated with large formal vases of stone, in 
which yews, cypresses, and other evergreens vegetated in somber sul- 
lenness, and gave a corresponding degree of solemnity to the high 
and heavy building in front of which they were placed as ornaments, 
aspiring towards a square portion of the blue hemisphere, . . . 
To be sure, another reader, with a special interest in medieval 
architecture, might enjoy reading the parts which I omitted. 
When I asked my son at the age of twelve what parts he had 
omitted he startled me by saying, “Oh, those long-drawn-out 
conversations between two lovers.”’ Possibly when slightly older 
these same conversations may fascinate him. 
Skillful, active detecting and selecting of interesting portions 
involved.—In such rapid, cursory, just-for-fun reading you don’t 
stop, as a rule, to turn the matter over in your mind. For this 
reason we may call it nonreflective reading, to distinguish it 
from more studious, reflective types of reading to be described 
later. Such nonreflective reading, however, is not unthinking or 
merely passive. Instead, it involves the most active selection of
-P-A-G-E-361
  
SKILLFUL SILENT READING 345 
certain portions of the material or certain lines of thought, with 
conscious neglect of others. It requires considerable skill to be 
able to see at a glance what portions are needed for your present 
purpose and what portions you may neglect. For example, in the 
selections from Scott given above, by the time you read “a paved 
court, decorated,” the word “decorated” gives a hint that you 
may overlook a considerable amount that follows, if you are 
interested merely in the action; but where it reads “a pair of 
large folding doors . . . flew open with vehemence,” you take 
careful note of what is said. 
Serious matter also cursorily read for enjoyment of flow of 
ideas.—This rapid, cursory, nonreflective, yet active, selective 
reading is perhaps the commonest type to be found in ordinary 
life. It is especially prominent in the reading of fiction and of 
the news of the day as reported in the daily papers. In the case 
of well-educated persons it is also very common in reading serious 
matter, such as history, biography, travel, civic discussions, etc., 
just for the enjoyment of the flow of ideas that the reading 
arouses. In such cases we must distinguish such serious reading 
from the more studious, reflective types to which we shall now 
turn our attention. 
b. Reflective, studious reading. (1) Detailed analysis of 
meanings.—The first kind of studious, reflective reading that 
we shall consider may be illustrated by the reading of arithmetic 
problems. As an example notice your mental activity in trying 
to grasp the following problems preparatory to solving them: 
Bordeaux mixture, for spraying, contains 14 per cent by weight of 
copper sulphate, 1} per cent of unslaked lime, the rest being water. 
How many pounds are there of each in a barrel containing 250 lb. 
of the mixture ? : 
If steel rails weighing 120 lb. to the yard are used between New 
York and Chicago, a distance of 980 mi., how many tons will be re- 
quired for a double-track road between these two cities? 
The Bordeaux-mixture problem may puzzle you (if you have 
not had experience in spraying gardens or using chemicals) 
 
-P-A-G-E-362
346 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
merely through its strange terms, although the arithmetical 
features of it are easy to understand. On the other hand, in the 
steel-rail problem you will easily grasp the meaning of the 
individual terms, but in getting the full meaning of the problem, 
in order to solve it, you will probably glance back and forth over 
it several times, pick out certain features, work with them, then 
return for others, etc. 
Textbooks call for much careful analysis of meanings.—This 
kind of reading we may call “detailed analysis of meanings.” 
The need of training pupils to do it skillfully is emphasized by 
Thorndike in the following quotation from a description of his 
reading-scale for measuring ability to understand sentences: 
It will be profitable for any group of teachers to examine the text- 
books used in Grade IV, marking passages that seem harder to read 
than Difficulty 5.25 [of the scale]; to examine textbooks used in 
Grade V, marking passages that seem harder than Difficulty 6; 
and so on. Such passages evidently need to be taught as reading be- 
fore they are taught as arithmetic or geography. It will be still more 
instructive to test the pupils in advance with these passages in tests 
constructed after the pattern of the scale. The results will prove 
that for many pupils the task in arithmetic is not to understand the 
purely arithmetical problem and know the means for meeting it, but 
to read the description of the problem. Many failures to learn 
geography will be found due not to inability to use certain facts, nor 
to inability to remember certain facts for use, but to inability to get 
these facts from the paragraph presenting them. The pupils in ques- 
tion never had these facts at all. (14: 46) 
Pupils need skill in analyzing meanings in higher studies and 
in practical documents.—As the pupil progresses into high school 
and college he will find more and more occasion for the careful 
analysis of meanings in reading his textbooks in mathematics, 
science, grammar, psychology, philosophy, religion, law, med- 
icine, engineering, etc. When he gets into practical life he will 
have frequent need for such analysis in reading directions for 
practical operations, in studying contracts and other legal docu- 
ments, in puzzling out the complications of insurance policies,
-P-A-G-E-363
  SKILLFUL SILENT READING 347 
and in many other examples of practical technical reading. 
Thus we find the first type of reflective, studious reading— 
namely, detailed analysis of meanings—to be an important need 
of the pupil both in school and in practical life. 
(2) Grasping and organizing main points of a chapter or 
an article.-—Another type of reflective, studious silent reading 
may be illustrated by the studying which you would do in case 
your instructor were in the habit of giving in his tests such di- 
rections as the following: “Give a concise, organized summary of 
the discussion of the pupil’s needs in silent reading.”’ In study- 
ing for such questions you would try to grasp the points in an 
assignment, outline these as main points and subpoints, and re- 
member them at least until the test should be over. In my own 
instruction I have recently tended to emphasize such test ques- 
tions in order to train the students in doing this type of reading. 
Moreover, in writing this text, a number of devices have been 
used, such as paragraph headings, numbered series of points, 
division of chapters into sections, etc., in an effort to help the 
reader to grasp and organize in his mind the main points of a 
chapter. Unless a reader purposely tries to do this he may be- 
come lost in the details, or remember merely some interesting 
examples instead of the general points which they illustrate. 
Examples of selecting points in an article on Hoover.—This 
selecting and organizing of the principal points of an article or 
chapter is particularly important in reading serious articles in 
magazines for technical or civic purposes. For example, shortly 
after the World War my wife and I read in a magazine a 
sketch of the life of Herbert Hoover. From the wealth of de- 
tail in the article these points seemed to stand out: 
1. Hoover was a poor boy, and through his own genius and efforts 
he attained eminence. 
2. He is an efficiency expert. 
3. He is a wizard as an organizer. 
4. He sacrificed personal wealth in order to serve in large social 
enterprises. 
 
-P-A-G-E-364
  348 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
5. Through practical experience in mining-engineering and the 
food administration he knows intimately the Orient, Europe, and al- 
most every corner of the world. 
6. Hence he is familiar with international relations. 
Activities involved in selecting and organizing points.—In 
picking out such points as these the reader may pursue some 
of the following activities : 
1. With definite intention he may watch for main points as he reads. 
2. He may underline them, or mark them in some other way. 
3. He may review the article to “spot” them or to refresh them 
in mind. 
4. He may recall them mentally after reading the article. 
5. He may write an outline of them, either while perusing the 
article or from memory. 
6. He may talk them over with someone. 
Practice exercises in Section III for selecting and organizing 
main points.—In a later section of the chapter we shall describe 
some sample lessons in which special practice was given in this 
second type of reflective, studious reading ; namely, the selecting 
and organizing of the main points of a chapter or article. 
(3) Reading to remember main ideas.—Closely related to 
this selective, organizing reading is studious reading with the 
definite purpose and intention of remembering the principal 
ideas. In much of the cursory, nonreflective reading of fiction 
and other matter just for fun, we don’t care whether we remem- 
ber the contents or not—our chief purpose is merely to enjoy the 
train of ideas that the reading involves. When we are doing re- 
flective, studious reading, however, we often desire to remember 
the principal points for future use. Our reading of the Hoover 
article described above is an example in point. At an earlier 
date, when Hoover was feeding Belgium, I had read an account 
of his life, but had given him only casual attention as one of the 
many figures in the World War. Later, however, the possibility 
of his being a candidate for public office led me to read with 
the definite intention of remembering the main facts. This
-P-A-G-E-365
  
SKILLFUL SILENT READING 349 
purpose is subserved by the same activities as we described 
above for selecting and organizing the main points. To these 
we would add the need for reviewing the article after a little 
time had elapsed for its main points, as well as restudying the 
written outline of these. 
(4) Critical evaluation of statements. Reading of the 
League of Nations.—We shall now turn to a fourth type of re- 
flective reading, in which careful, critical evaluation of the 
printed statements is carried on, in order to determine if they 
are true or valid, or if they are inconsistent, or if the policy they 
express is sound and profitable, etc. In order to illustrate this 
type of reading imagine yourself a member of the United States 
Senate in 1920, during the debate on the ratification of the 
Versailles Peace Treaty. You are trying to decide whether to 
vote for or against the famous Article X in the Covenant of 
the League of Nations, which reads as follows: 
The members of the league undertake to respect and preserve as 
against external aggression the territorial integrity and existing po- 
litical independence of all members of the league. In case of any 
such aggression or in case of any threat or danger of such aggression, 
the council shall advise upon the means by which this obligation shall 
be fulfilled. 
In trying to decide which way to vote you would not only try 
to puzzle out the full force and meaning of certain crucial words 
in these two sentences, such as the words “advise” and “obli- 
gation,” but you would also evaluate carefully the desirability of 
the proposed arrangement. In doing this you would have to 
read the covenant over and over to get the relation of this 
paragraph to others. Moreover, you would have to recall how an 
apparently isolated attack by Austria on Serbia embroiled the 
whole world in a great war, how similar aggressions in the 
future may have similar results, how such aggressions can be 
avoided, etc. In other words, you would have to do the high- 
est type of reflective thinking while evaluating this important 
historical document.
-P-A-G-E-366
  350 . TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
Critical reading on civic issues, investments, vacation plans, 
etc.—However, you do not have to attain high office in order 
to do such critical political thinking, since all American men 
and women are called upon to do it in reading about civic issues, 
especially during political campaigns. These issues may vary 
from local matters (such as the desirability of a bond issue for 
good roads) to large national issues (such as national prohibi- 
tion or participation of the United States in foreign wars). In 
other practical affairs the same critical evaluating reading is 
frequently demanded ; for example, in reading alluring advertise- 
ments of real-estate bargains or of oil and mining stocks, in 
studying catalogues and courses of study of higher schools while 
planning an education, in comparing descriptions of resorts and 
routes of travel when arranging to spend a vacation, in studying 
a contract preparatory to signing it, etc. 
Mental processes in critical reading.—The mental activity 
in such skilled critical reading may include such operations as 
the following : 
1. Recalling related facts and evidence with which to test 
the truth or value of the printed statements. 
2. Making cross comparisons within the material to ascertain 
inconsistencies, contradictions, supporting arguments, etc. 
3. Comparing with other documents bearing on the same 
question. 
In Section III of this chapter we. shall give examples of 
lessons in which practice in these activities is provided. 
(5) Bibliographical research. Consulting books and period- 
icals.—As the final type of practice in studious, reflective read- 
ing we may note the need for training in consulting books and 
periodicals while searching for discussions of particular topics. 
This practice may consist in using any of the following sources: 
(1) the table of contents and index of a single book or periodi- 
cal, (2) collections of several volumes, including encyclopedias 
and other books of reference, (3) the catalogues of libraries, 
(4) the cumulative indexes to all periodicals, (5) the open
-P-A-G-E-367
  SKILLFUL SILENT READING 351 
shelves of libraries. In a poorly equipped elementary school 
and community, practice may be possible in only the first of 
these; but in a well-equipped school and community, pupils 
may receive considerable practice in the consultation of whole 
libraries before they have finished the elementary school. 
Conclusion and review of Section II, on pupils’ needs.— 
This concludes our discussion of the topic of Section II of the 
chapter ; namely, what a pupil needs in acquiring skill in silent 
reading. We have indicated that his needs include the following : 
1. An intense interest in reading. 
2. A stock of experiences, ideas, and meanings for interpreting what 
he reads. 
3. A vocabulary of ten thousand words which he recognizes auto- 
matically. 
4. Practice in both 
a. Cursory, unreflective reading and 
b. Reflective, studious reading, including 
(1) Detailed analysis of meanings. 
(2) Grasping and organizing main points. 
(3) Reading to remember main ideas. 
(4) Critical evaluation of statements. 
(5) Bibliographical research. 
In Section III we shall describe actual lessons and devices 
which illustrate the practices of progressive schools in organizing 
the training of pupils in silent reading so as to meet these needs. 
Section III. Practice EXERCISES IN 
SILENT READING 
Details of technique illustrated.—In order to give the begin- 
ning teacher a concrete idea of the actual classroom procedure 
in conducting silent-reading lessons, we shall first describe in 
detail a second-grade lesson which exhibits pupils in the very 
early stages of learning to read silently, and then describe some 
seventh-grade lessons that illustrate the technique that may be 
 
-P-A-G-E-368
352. TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
used in the higher grades. These descriptions will be followed 
by a systematic account of devices to meet each of the pupil’s 
needs listed in the preceding section of the chapter. 
A. Sample Lessons from Second and Seventh Grades 
  Second-grade lesson. Compare with earlier silent-reading 
lesson and silent-reading tests.—The second-grade lesson was 
taught by Miss Laura Lucas in The University of Chicago 
Elementary School. We may prepare ourselves to appreciate her 
technique by recalling two of our earlier discussions of the 
teaching of reading. The first of these is the description (on 
pages 120-123) of one of Miss Lucas’s lessons in which the 
second-grade pupils, in the fall, read silently the story of a 
crocodile who tried to catch a monkey. This lesson illustrated 
the general spirit of Miss Lucas’s teaching, in addition to giv- 
ing us a picture of a different type of practice in silent reading 
from that which we shall describe below. The other discussion, 
which we might review to advantage, concerns the use of silent- 
reading tests (as described on pages 133-135) to determine how 
well pupils can grasp and remember some of the main points 
of a story they have just read. The lesson to be described was 
intended to test the pupils’ abilities in this line and to give 
them practice in it. 
' Pupils from middle third of the class: average abilities. —The 
group of second-grade children to whom the lesson was taught 
represented in ability the middle third of the class. The top third 
included the fast, skilled readers who needed no special help in 
reading ; the lowest third included children who lacked phonetic 
training or ability and needed much special assistance ; while the 
middle group, whose lesson I observed, needed some help but 
had considerable skill and a fair reading vocabulary. 
Opening directions: pupils to read carefully, then answer ques- 
tions.—At the beginning of the lesson this group assembled in 
their little chairs at the front of the room. After some prelim-
-P-A-G-E-369
  SKILLFUL SILENT READING 353 
inary remarks Miss Lucas said: “Today we are going to read a 
story which I think you have never seen before. We shall read 
it to ourselves, silently. I want you to see not how quickly you 
can read it but how well you can do it, so that you can write the 
answers to all the questions that I am going to give you. Be sure 
to answer each question in a complete sentence and be careful to 
watch your capitals and periods.” 
Difficult phrases and words studied on the board.—Miss 
Lucas then went on: “In order that you may read each ques- 
tion easily, and not have to ask me for help, I am going to write 
on the board some phrases and words which you will meet in 
the story. The name of the story is this [writing]: ‘Talkative 
Mr. Shellback.’” By means of their phonetic abilities the chil- 
dren readily pronounced this new title. “You may study these 
phrases and words as I put them on the board, and then I shall 
ask different ones to read them.” 
The children watched attentively as Miss Lucas wrote the 
following : 
among the lilies opened his mouth 
clever remark lifeless 
talkative turtle moment 
traveling through the air jealous 
Phonetics and meanings.— Miss Lucas then asked, ‘‘Do you 
see any phrase or word that gives you trouble?” Individual’ 
pupils stepped to the board and pointed to several. The pro- 
nunciation of each one was worked out phonetically. Attention 
was called to the meaning of some of the phrases by such ques- 
tions from the teacher as, ‘What does ‘clever remarks’ mean?” 
A pupil replied, “Like they were smart.” ‘What does this 
phrase mean ?” continued Miss Lucas as she pointed to different 
ones. ‘“Let’s name them all together,” she said, in concluding 
this step in the lesson. 
Silent reading timed and answers to questions written.— 
“Now,” said the teacher, “we shall read the story silently and
-P-A-G-E-370
    354 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
then answer the questions.” As she gave each pupil a book, she 
added: ‘Open your books to page 88, then hold your finger in 
the place and close the book. Remember, you are going to read 
the story through carefully, then hold up your hand as soon as 
you have finished so that I can time you. Then read each ques- 
tion through carefully and write the answer. If you don’t un- 
derstand a question, ask me.” 
The pupils then returned to their desks. Miss Lucas said: 
‘All ready? You may start.” She noted the time on her wrist 
watch and made a memorandum of it on a piece of paper. The 
children opened their books and began to read silently. 
Miss Lucas then removed a large sheet of manila paper which 
hid twelve questions that she had written on the blackboard. 
The first five of these read as follows: 
. Who was Mr. Shellback? 
. Where did he live? 
. Who were his friends ? 
. Where were they going? 
. What did the turtle want to do? AbBwnH 
Much vocalization.— Meanwhile the children were absorbed 
in reading. All except two or three were moving their lips and 
some were vocalizing quite audibly. 
Timing and helping each child.—As each pupil finished his 
reading he raised his hand and Miss Lucas wrote down his time. 
The child then took out pencil and paper and began to write the 
answers to the questions. If he needed help on spelling he raised 
his hand and named the word. Miss Lucas then wrote it on the 
board; for example, “house,” “worm,” “ducks,” “country.” 
Everybody worked rapidly and quietly. Miss Lucas was alert 
to note each pupil’s needs, as she moved around the room giv- 
ing individuals occasional suggestions in a very low tone. Only 
twice did I notice a pupil open his book to refresh his memory 
in preparation for answering a question, although the children 
understood that they might do this whenever necessary.
-P-A-G-E-371
  SKILLFUL SILENT READING 355 
Supplementary reading.—When a pupil finished writing he 
took his paper to the teacher for her approval. He then opened 
his book and proceeded to read another story. 
Close of period. —At the end of the period, when the remain- 
ing papers were handed in, Miss Lucas said, ‘I shall correct 
your papers later, and then we can see how well you have done.””+

  Comparative rates. Fastest equals twice the average and 
three times the slowest.—The next day I secured from Miss 
Lucas the rates of reading which she had calculated from the 
scores of the children. In spite of the fact that these pupils con- 
1Samples from the papers of two of the children who finished first 
are shown above. These papers exhibit interesting contrasts in motor skill 
as represented by the handwriting. Miss Lucas told me that the poorly 
written paper was from a little girl who had a very fine mind, but who 
experienced so much difficulty in the handwork classes that she scarcely 
succeeded in constructing anything.

  356 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
stituted a comparatively homogeneous group from the middle 
of the class, the fastest pupil had read 155 words a minute while 
the slowest had read only 50. The most frequent score was 77. 
Diagnosing needs.—From these scores as well as from the 
quality records of the pupils, Miss Lucas was able to diagnose 
each pupil’s peculiar needs, as well as the general needs of the 
group as compared with second-grade classes in general. 
How the lesson meets pupil’s needs in silent reading.—If we 
will recall our general canvass of a pupil’s needs in acquiring 
skill in silent reading (as summarized on page 351), we may 
note that this lesson meets these in the following manner: 
1. The pupil’s interest in silent reading was stimulated by the 
fascinating story material and by the game element contained in 
discovering the answers to questions and in comparing the 
rates of reading. 
2. His reading vocabulary was increased by the specific prac- 
tice on new and difficult phrases and words such as “clever 
remarks” and “jealous.” 
3. He received practice in careful silent reading of material 
with the intention of remembering its main ideas. 
Variety in practice secured by several devices.—Other types 
of silent-reading practice which Miss Lucas used in other lessons 
with this group include the following: (1) rapid silent reading 
of a story preparatory to telling it (as described on page 121) ; 
(2) oral answers to questions on the story, instead of written 
ones; (3) varying the questions so that they can be answered 
by “‘yes” or “no” (this readily creates an interesting game for 
the pupils) ; (4) re-reading a familiar story from a new point 
of view which is determined by a few broad questions presented 
before the reading; (5) presenting questions on a new story 
before it is read; (6) drill games in flashing phrases for rapid 
recognition; (7) individual remedial work with pupils who 
experience special difficulty (as described on page 139). 
Contrast more technical lessons from an upper grade.—With 
these impressions of silent-reading lessons on a very elementary
-P-A-G-E-373
  
  SKILLFUL SILENT READING 357 
level, we may now contrast some lessons which are chosen from 
a class that is near the upper end of an elementary school, and 
which illustrate, consequently, much more technical training in 
meeting the needs of pupils who are acquiring skill in silent 
reading. 
Sample seventh-grade lessons. Training in reading material 
from community life.—The lessons which we shall describe are 
from a seventh-grade class in which the study of community life 
was correlated with the study of English. The content of the 
course consisted of civic material, and the methods used included 
special attention to training in reading and in oral and written 
expression. The lessons were taught by Miss Edith Shepherd, 
departmental teacher of English in The University of Chicago 
Junior High School. 
Three types of reading matter: text, supplementary, and 
recreational.—The topic which was being studied was ‘The 
school.” The material read by the pupils included three distinct 
types; namely, (1) a textbook, (2) supplementary reading 
closely related to the text, and (3) recreational reading of stories 
of school life. The textbook took up such subtopics as ‘‘ How the 
American school developed,” ‘The money value of an educa- 
tion,” “How to get the most out of school”; the supplementary 
reading included references to such books as “Child Life in 
Colonial Days,” “Indian Boyhood,” etc. ; the recreational read- 
ing included such stories as “’Tom Brown’s School-Days,” ‘“‘The 
Hoosier Schoolmaster,”’ etc. 
Three devices illustrated: (1) arousing interest, (2) teaching 
rules of practice, (3) finding “signpost” paragraph.—Miss 
Shepherd was engaged, in codperation with other members of 
the faculty, in experimenting to determine the best devices to 
use in improving pupils in various kinds of silent reading. We 
shall present her description of two of her lessons which illustrate 
particularly the three following points: (1) arousing the pupils’ 
interest in improving their reading, (2) making them aware of 
the nature of effective practice, and (3) training them in rapidly  
-P-A-G-E-374
  358 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
grasping the central thoughts or main points in chapters, sec- 
tions, or paragraphs. Miss Shepherd’s account will give a vivid, 
concrete notion of her method of conducting the class work. 
She wrote as follows: 
Outstanding lessons—A few lessons worked out experimentally 
with these pupils seem to me especially suggestive. Not only do they 
remain outstanding in my mind, but they were significant in the read- 
ing experience of the children, as evidenced by their frequent refer- 
ences to them and clear memory of them. One of these lessons was 
the second lesson of our experimental series. In it the children led 
the way in motivating their whole reading problem in a manner quite 
unforeseen by either teacher or pupils at the beginning of the lesson. 
Arousing curiosity about pupils’ rates of reading.—During the first 
lesson the curiosity of the children about their speed in silent read- 
ing was aroused by such questions as, “Have you ever had a silent- 
reading test?” “Do you know how fast you read or whether you 
read as fast as you ought to in your grade?” “Would you like to 
know?” Of course the last answer was affirmative, and an informal 
timed test for speed and comprehension was given on the spot. At 
the close of the test individual scores (number of words read per 
minute) were placed on the board arranged in order, beginning with 
the highest. The class was amazed to see that the scores ranged from 
405 to 141 words per minute. They immediately wanted to know 
how fast their reading should be, but discussion of this question had 
to be postponed until the next lesson. They were dismissed with the 
promise that their question would be answered the following day. 
Discovering how to practice most advantageously.—The class 
came eagerly to English the next day, the question again on their 
lips, “How fast ought we to read?” I told them the standard rate 
for their grade—280 words per minute (“Richmond Course of 
Study in English,” p. 34)—and the median for their own class. One 
of those who fell below the median asked me to give him another 
test that day. Protests were at once forthcoming from three: 
Pupil III. No, we ought to practice awhile first. 
Pupil I. I think we ought to discuss why we are slow and how 
we can speed up. 
Pupil VIII. There’s no use talking about how—just read. All 
we need is practice.
-P-A-G-E-375
  
    SKILLFUL SILENT READING 359 
At this point I asked, “Is that true of games—that you need just 
to practice, no matter how?” A negative answer from Pupil VIII 
brought the question “Why not?”—to which he answered, “You 
have to practice the right way to get results.” To this the class 
agreed. “What do you mean by the right way?” I asked. The 
class discussed this question for several minutes in relation to games, 
no reference being made to reading. When no more suggestions 
were forthcoming from the class, I suggested that we sum up the 
points that had been brought out in our discussion. The summary 
which follows is given in the wording suggested by the class, even 
to the high-sounding title. I have inclosed in parentheses the con- 
crete cases on which they based their generalizations. 
ADVANTAGEOUS WAYS OF PRACTICE 
1. Practice something a little hard for you. (Don’t always prac- 
tice batting with an easy pitcher.) 
2. Practice according to the rules of the game. (Don’t hold the 
ball in practice if it is against the rules to hold it in the game.) 
3. Practice with your mind alert. (Be ready for your opponent.) 
4. Practice a variety of exercises. (In basketball don’t practice 
throwing baskets all the time, but practice also passing—long pass, 
dribbling, etc.) 
After these rules had been formulated I asked, “Do you think 
these principles of right practice are true only of games, or would 
they hold true in general?” The class was of the opinion that they 
would be true in general. ‘In reading?” I asked. “Yes,” came 
the answer, “if we knew the rules.” Here was my opportunity. 
Each of the principles I planned to teach was one of the rules; I 
had only to present it as such and show why it was effective in in- 
1This conclusion of the pupils needs rather careful interpretation. For 
example, in the case of remedial work for very poor readers it is often 
necessary to go back to the easiest first steps in reading and to develop 
the learner’s skill by very easy, graded steps. The example of Grace, de- 
scribed on page 139, is an illustration. Some skilled observers have 
concluded that when special practice in silent reading is introduced for 
poor readers, it is necessary to begin with material from schoolbooks at 
least two grades below that to which the pupils belong. Compare the 
cases of the boys who “struck out” all the time in baseball (as described 
on page 44).

creasing speed, to assure its ready acceptance. I shali illustrate how 
this was done by describing the lesson which introduced the pupils 
to the practice of discovering the “signpost” paragraph in a chapter, 
or section of a chapter. 
Introducing the “signpost” paragraph—The paragraph that ini- 
tiated this lesson is from H. C. Hill’s textbook on “Community 
Life and Civic Problems.” It follows a discussion of two questions ; 
namely, What should modern education be? What are the needs of 
today? The paragraph reads as follows : 
There are many different answers to [these] questions. .. . There are 
[some] people who say that the chief purpose of education should be to 
prepare boys and girls to support themselves; others insist that culture 
should be the chief goal; and a large number declare that education 
should be primarily for the promotion of social efficiency. 
I recalled to the children the facts we had learned in a previous 
lesson,—that the Spartans, the Indians, and the Puritans had chosen 
a kind of education for their youth which would prepare them for 
their later life, and that they had succeeded largely because they 
were united in opinion. I here asked them to read the first two 
paragraphs of the section and see if in the author’s judgment we 
are united in our opinion today. They found, of course, that there 
are at least three different opinions. After these had been stated I 
asked them what they expected the author to do in the rest of the 
section. They answered, “He will probably tell about each of these 
aims.” I then compared the purpose of this paragraph to that of 
a signpost pointing the way of our journey with the author through 
his ideas. Next I pointed out that following the direction on a sign- 
post brings the traveler to some destination, and asked what was 
probably the destination we would reach if we followed the author’s 
signpost. When I pointed out that the destination of a discussion is 
generally a conclusion, or a decision, the class saw that in this case it 
would be a decision as to which is the best aim of education. At 
this point I said: “I'll give you two minutes to find out which the 
author thinks is best. Where will you look?” “In the first and last 
sentences of the paragraphs,” they answered. Inside of the two 
minutes they had discovered his preference for the third aim. The 
next step was to see why, and what were the faults of the other two 
aims. They pointed out the sentences which told, and found that 
social efficiency included both self-support and culture, and training
-P-A-G-E-377
    
SKILLFUL SILENT READING 361 
in citizenship besides. With these facts in mind the class was next 
asked to represent this signpost paragraph on the board. After a 
little thought they decided on a signpost with three arms, all point- 
ing along the same road, the first-arm bearing the legend “Self- 
support, 3 miles”; the second, “Culture, 5 miles”; the third, “Social 
Efficiency, 10 miles.” The distance, of course, indicates both the 
order of the three topics in the chapter and the fact that the third 
is larger than the other two. 
The striking points of the lesson were (1) the discovery by the 
pupils that they need read no further than the second paragraph to 
know the main points of the discussion; (2) the realization that they 
could find quickly the conclusion drawn by the author, as the des- 
tination of the thought; and (3) the diagrammatic representation 
of these facts by means of the signposts. 
Grouping pupils according to reading-ability, and differentiat- 
ing instruction.—With these concrete lessons in mind to typify 
the general spirit of Miss Shepherd’s class work, we may note 
with profit certain more general features of her experiment; 
namely, (1) grouping pupils of the class according to their 
ability in silent reading and (2) differentiating the practice 
exercises for the groups. 
Superior, mediocre, and poor groups based on tests.—After 
giving one of the standard scientific reading tests to the pupils, 
the results were used to divide the class into groups of superior, 
mediocre, and poor readers. 
Types of poor readers.—Miss Shepherd’s characterizations 
of certain of the poor readers will help us to realize some of the 
special problems involved in overcoming the special deficiencies 
of such readers. The following are typical cases and reveal 
striking contrasts in pupils’ needs: 
Lazy, hazy, purposeless readers —Pupils IX and XI were habitu- 
ally lazy thinkers. They never attacked a piece of reading purpose- 
fully or with vigor; never gained more than a few hazy ideas from 
a ten-minute reading assignment, and were satisfied with that. Pupil 
XI had a limited reading vocabulary, and no initiative in attacking 
new words or in getting meaning from the context. 
 
-P-A-G-E-378
  362 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
Conscientious, intelligent, plodding, word-by-word reader —Pupil 
X was of a different type: all his reactions, physical and mental, 
were slow, but positive and intelligent. His reading vocabulary was 
poor, and his pertinacious habit of never leaving a word until he 
had grasped its meaning and pronounced it slowed up his silent 
reading and showed a distorted sense of values. He was a thorough 
plodder who had to learn not to be so thorough about details as to 
miss the main idea. 
Timid, nervous, uncertain reader—Pupil XII was nervous and 
very timid, and did not work well under pressure. He felt his lack of 
reading skill, and distrusted his grasp of material he had read. He 
needed more than anything else to have some standard by which to 
measure his own accomplishment, that he might know, after he had 
done a piece of reading, whether he had done it successfully. 
Docile, undiscriminating memorizer—Pupil XIV was a girl of no 
great ability, but was easily stimulated to effort and very teachable. 
She would read rapidly unless expected-to reproduce, or answer ques- 
tions; then she would go painstakingly over the material until she 
had undiscriminatingly memorized it. But she willingly adopted new 
methods and faithfully used them. I attribute most of her progress 
to docility in following directions. 
Lack of standards and of sense of relative values—For one rea- 
son or another all these pupils had failed to learn to do effective 
silent reading. One difficulty they had in common, and I believe in 
common with most poor readers—none of them had any standard 
for judging the effectiveness of his reading nor any clear sense of 
relative values. Pupils IX, XI, XIII, and XIV were as well satis- 
fied to remember a few striking details as to have mastered the 
central idea of a selection, and the four who had difficulties with 
words would spend an undue amount of time on a new or difficult 
word whether it was vital to an understanding of the content or not. 
Practice differentiated for superior, mediocre, and poor read- 
ers.—The manner in which Miss Shepherd endeavored to over- 
come these special defects of poor readers and at the same time 
provide the special practice needed by mediocre and superior 
readers is suggested in the following description which she 
wrote of a series of six lessons that were intended to give the 
pupils special practice in selecting the central ideas, or main
-P-A-G-E-379
  SKILLFUL SILENT READING 363 
points, in their reading. This was one of the principles or rules 
of effective reading which she wanted the pupils clearly to 
understand and skillfully to apply. In her description the 
superior, mediocre, and slow groups are designated by the 
letters A, B, and C respectively. Her account reads as follows: 
Six practice lessons in finding central ideas.—Perhaps the relation 
of principles of effective reading, text content, and supplementary 
assignments may be made clear by a detailed description of a series 
of lessons given in the second semester. These six lessons were 
consecutive lessons in the textbook and in application of the reading 
principle, but did not occur on consecutive days. Lessons one and 
two were given one week, lessons three and four the following week, 
and lessons five and six the third week. The intervening days were 
occupied with composition and other phases of English work. 
Sections of the text—The topic was “The School,” the third 
chapter in Hill’s “Community Life and Civic Problems.” The text- 
book, which was then in experimental mimeographed form, divided 
the chapter into six sections, as follows: 
I. How we Learn (about eight pages of ordinary text). 
II. How the American School Developed (4 pages). 
III. How the Public Schools are Controlled and Supported (6 pages). 
IV. What Education should be (6 pages). 
V. The Money Value of an Education (4 pages). 
VI. How to get the Most out of School (7 pages). 
The six lesson periods were spent as follows : 
First day: Presentation to the whole class of the principle of 
finding central ideas. Application and practice in finding central 
ideas in Section I of the text. 
Second day: For the first thirty minutes the C group reviewed 
the presentation given the day before and reviewed the application to 
Section I of the text. The B group read Section II, and the A group 
Sections II and III, and both prepared to report to the C group the 
important facts of these sections. During the last twenty minutes 
the A and B groups reported to the class, which asked questions and 
discussed points. 
Third day: For the first thirty minutes the C group read Sec- 
tion II of the text, marking in the margin sentences that state central 
ideas and finding the points that the B group should cover in the quiz
-P-A-G-E-380
  
364 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
which they were making. The B group was assigned the task of 
making a quiz for the class on this section. Their questions were to 
bring out important points and required only brief answers. The 
A group could do general library reading as soon as they felt pre- 
pared for the quiz. The last twenty minutes were devoted to writing 
the quiz and discussing the answers. 
Fourth day: All the groups read Section IV silently, the C group 
marking central ideas. The teacher passed about among the C group 
observing sentences marked, helping those who were making mis- 
takes, answering puzzling questions, and, in general, giving individual 
instruction to those who needed it. The A group, when they finished 
reading, were instructed to meet in the rear of the room, decide 
upon the main topics and subtopics of the section, and delegate one 
of their number to put the outline on the board to guide the class 
discussion. The B group were allowed to do library reading when 
prepared to discuss the text assignment. When all the groups were 
ready the entire class took part in the discussion based on the outline. 
Fifth day: All the groups read Section V silently, the C group 
marking central ideas and comparing points with the author’s sum- 
mary in the last paragraph of the section. The A and B groups, 
in addition, prepared to discuss certain problems and questions from 
the list at the end of the chapter; for example, “Was Lincoln an 
educated man? Give reasons for your answer.” ‘What social 
dangers in the home are corrected by the school?” The last part 
of the period was spent in discussing the section and the assigned 
questions. 
Sixth day: All read Section VI, the first four pages—the A and B 
groups independently, the C group under supervision. The B group 
read also the last four pages and prepared to tell the main facts to 
the rest of the class. The A group prepared to read aloud to the 
class some poem or incident related to the topic; as, for example, 
“In School Days,” by Whittier, or a passage from “Hiawatha’s 
Childhood,” by Longfellow. These may have been chosen by the 
children or assigned by the teacher. This completed the series of 
six lessons in finding central ideas. 
Additional supplementary activities for capable groups.—Other 
supplementary activities for the A and B groups which I have used 
are the following: (1) Summarizing for class discussion; for ex- 
ample, a summary of likenesses and differences of a primitive and a  
-P-A-G-E-381
  
SKILLFUL SILENT READING 365 
frontier community, put on the board by four members of the A 
group, formed an excellent basis for discussion when the C group 
had finished reading. (2) Preparation of a debate on a related ques- 
tion; for example, “Resolved, That the average home is better 
today than the average home one hundred years ago.” (3) Prepara- 
tion of a dramatization of a story or poem related to the topic; for 
example, “A Knight’s Toast to his Mother,” by Scott. Other suit- 
able activities suggest themselves in the course of the work. 
Much practice needed on each principle. Variety needed for in- 
terest.— Much practice is necessary to make each of the principles 
function habitually in the reading of pupils in the C group. Two 
or three lessons are not enough. One boy, Pupil X, finally formed 
the habit of looking for and marking the sentences which state the 
central ideas, after perhaps twenty lessons in which he had used the 
principle. So much practice is likely to become tedious unless vari- 
ous devices are used to arouse interest. A few of those I have found 
most successful are the following: (1) Marking central ideas as the 
selection is given a rapid silent reading ; then comparing results with 
those of other members of the group. (2) Making an outline with 
central ideas marked by Roman numerals. (3) Guessing from the 
title what the central ideas will be and verifying or correcting by 
reading; for example, from the title “Dangers to the Family” the 
class guessed that the central ideas would be statements of different 
dangers, and guessed what several of them were. Their reading then 
verified, supplemented, and corrected these guesses. (4) Marking 
sentences in first reading, then comparing with points of the author’s 
summary. 
Reénforced by correlating with principles of composition—In 
order to reénforce these principles it is helpful to emphasize them 
in the composition work at the time they are taught with reading. 
In connection with finding central ideas I taught the use of the topic 
sentence, the “signpost” paragraph, and the summarizing paragraph. 
When teaching how central ideas are supported I taught the methods 
of paragraph development in the composition work, and the use of 
subtopics in an outline. The children see that these rhetorical re- 
quirements are not mere whims of the teacher but devices useful 
for the reader or listener, and they enjoy using them in their themes 
and talks. After a well-organized talk has been given by one of the 
group, they enjoy trying to reproduce the speaker’s outline or to
-P-A-G-E-382
366 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
recall his topic sentences or his “signpost” paragraph. So, threugh 
frequent use, the principles are kept in mind. What is more, there 
is no need of laying aside the principle that has been learned, in order 
to take up a new one. On the contrary, each forms a basis for the 
addition of the succeeding one. A child may first learn to read with 
a question in mind, then he may learn to look for the key sentences 
in the reading which answer his question, then for the details which 
build these ideas up. 
Results. Notable improvement by poor readers.—In my judg- 
ment the reading power of the weaker pupils was markedly improved 
by their practice. After the latter they attacked a reading assign- 
ment with a spirit of concentration quite lacking early in the year, 
and possessed a considerable ability in selecting essential points of 
a passage. 
Instead of a few hazy ideas, Pupil IX generally had developed an 
assured grasp of the important points of materials he had read. In 
fact, in a recent assignment he organized his outside reading for three 
days so well that he was able to assign topics for reports to four 
members of the B group. 
Pupil XIV no longer resorted to memorizing assignments and had 
quite lost the air of strain and uncertainty she wore at first. 
Pupil XII had lost much of his timidity in discussing his reading. 
When alone with the teacher and the class he showed increasing 
confidence. 
Pupil X was undoubtedly the slowest pupil in the class, though 
_ not the least intelligent ; yet following this special training he went 
through a three-page selection after he had had a chance to read it 
silently once, and told the central ideas without an error and without 
hesitation. 
Pupils XI and XIII, in my judgment, gained least in the course. 
They still lacked a sense of relative values, and their ideas of a pas- 
sage read were apt to be somewhat hazy. Possibly this lack of im- 
provement was due partly to lack of general mental ability, since the 
Binet-Simon Intelligence Test showed that with one exception these 
pupils ranked lower in intelligence than any other in the group. 
Second-grade and seventh-grade lessons illustrate a de- 
veloping technique.—The sample lessons described on pages 
352-366 exemplify a technique in teaching silent reading 
 
-P-A-G-E-383
  
  SKILLFUL SILENT READING 367 
that has been invented largely since 1915, when the first scien- 
tific tests of ability in silent reading were popularized. Before 
this period there had been occasional emphasis upon the need. 
of such training, but little systematic effort to analyze the 
elements of skill in silent reading and to invent systematic 
devices to develop each type of skill. Eventually we shall have 
printed manuals of detailed practices and devices to be followed 
in each grade, similar to the excellent detailed manuals for 
teaching first-grade reading which have been on the market for 
some years and to which we have referred on page 124. Pending 
the publication of these manuals, and the experimental testing 
of their devices, the best we can do in a chapter on silent reading 
is to give a few illustrations of the lines along which the practice 
exercises for silent reading have been developing. We have done 
this in a way in the lessons described above. We shall now en- 
deavor to give a more systematic turn to our discussion by 
reviewing the analysis of a pupil’s needs in silent reading as 
described and numbered in Section II of the chapter and by 
giving a few fundamental examples of how each of these needs 
has been met. 
B. Systematic Description of Devices 
1. Developing interest.—As indicated on page 340, one of 
the first tasks in giving practice in silent reading is to arouse the 
pupil’s interest. In Miss Lucas’s second-grade lesson we found 
this practice illustrated in the interest aroused by the fascinating 
story content and by the game element in getting the answers to 
questions and comparing reading rates (as described on page 
354). In Miss Shepherd’s seventh-grade lessons we found sim- 
ilar curiosity about the rates of reading, plus an eager interest 
in devising rules to guide the pupils’ practice for improving their 
reading. Other examples of arousing the pupils’ interest in 
reading, which I have secured from experienced teachers in my 
summer classes, include the following:
-P-A-G-E-384
  
  368 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
Timing “Treasure Island.”—A seventh-grade teacher’ told 
of beginning in class the reading of “Treasure Island” and then 
asking the class to finish it during the several days that re- 
mained before the beginning of the next week. “Gee!” said 
one boy—“read the whole book by Monday!” The teacher 
suggested that most of the class would find the story so fas- 
cinating that they wouldn’t want to lay it down; but, seeing 
that some were still displeased, said: “Just see how long it 
really does take you to read it. Keep a record of the time you 
actually read; that is, don’t count the time when your mother 
calls you away to do things, etc.” The assignment included 
other points which need not concern us here. When Monday’s 
reading lesson came it developed that most of the pupils had 
finished the book. These included the boy who had thought in 
advance that it would be a hardship. It had taken him about 
thirteen hours, however, which proved that he was a slow 
reader, since several of the pupils had completed it in seven 
hours. The teacher then brought to his attention other books 
which might interest him. 
Challenging the pupils’ ability to read.—A device that a fifth- 
grade teacher? used was described by her in these words: 
At the beginning of some interesting topic I say to the children, 
“There would be lots of fun in this if you only knew how to read.” 
There are usually vigorous protests and expressions of surprise that 
I should question their reading ability, so I say, “All right, read 
page 59 (something easy and interesting) and tell me what it says.” 
After a while a hand will go up, and I allow the child to tell us what 
it says. Others who have read more intensively will supplement 
what he says, and I finally admit that they know how to read that. 
In talking about it, however, while some will challenge me to find 
something they cannot read, others will admit there are many things 
they don’t understand. Some will say they often read a paragraph 
over and over and know every word but can’t understand the para- 
graph. Some will say they can read it if they even “sorta” know 
1 Adelbert S. Anderson. 2Mary Roberts Scott.
-P-A-G-E-385
  SKILLFUL SILENT READING 369 
the words, while those who are weakest will probably not talk at all. 
This discussion initiates interest in improving the pupils’ ability to 
read, but it is necessary constantly to invent new devices to keep 
their interest alive, especially in the case of poor readers. 
“Hopeless” pupils interested through their hobbies.—Con- 
cerning her devices for interesting “hopeless” pupils the same 
teacher wrote as follows: 
There are about ten out of forty children that don’t like to read 
anything, and there are generally three or four out of the ten that 
seem hopeless in reading. Sometimes we resort to special tricks to 
aid the latter, since there are always a few (three or four) very bright 
pupils who have a lot of time to read and whose aid we may enlist 
in helping the slow. One of the slow pupils was named Horace. As 
a pupil he was almost a blank. His only interest was in horses. 
Tom, on the other hand, should have been in a higher grade and was 
an inveterate reader. One day Tom said something about Wildfire, the 
horse of Zane Grey’s novel. Horace wanted to hear more about it, 
but I told him he might take the book when Tom was through. He 
actually read the book. It was his first. Tom caught on, and read 
everything he could find about horses and gave interesting incidents. 
It cultivated his interest in animals, which was weak, and gave 
Horace an introduction to interesting reading. 
Charles was a mechanical genius, but he would not look at a 
book if he could help it. There were some books about boys that 
did wonderful things with motor boats and aéroplanes. The children 
learned that the discussion of any kind of machinery would arouse the 
interest of Charles, and they tantalized him into learning to read. We 
liked to have him pronounce judgment on the reasonableness of the 
ideas. Sometimes he would say, “Shucks! they never can do that,” 
or “I wonder if anyone ever will do that.” 
Securing interest through competition for tangible scores.— 
Among the most impelling instinctive tendencies in human be- 
ings is the competition for tangible scores, such as those in 
baseball, football, golf, bowling, billiards, rifle-shooting, etc. 
This interest is exhibited not only in the zeal of the players 
but also in the rapt attention that enthusiasts give to the re-
-P-A-G-E-386
  370 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
ports of the scores in the newspapers and on the bulletin boards 
in the large cities. Recently this interest in tangible scores has 
been used in practice exercises in school by exhibiting individ- 
ual scores and graphs showing the rise or fall of each pupil’s 
efficiency, and by exhibiting class scores and graphs showing 
how the score and progress of one class compared with similar 
data from other classes. O’Brien describes the effectiveness of 
such tangible scores in arousing pupils’ interest in improving 
the speed of their silent reading during his extensive experi- 
ments. Speaking of the individual graph, he says: 
The single line ascending or descending tells the pupil the story 
of his success or failure. It is simple, impressive, and comprehended 
at a glance. . . . The direction or slant of the line tells the whole 
story. The ascent of the line becomes a source of joy; its decline a 
source of grief. The latter tells, moreover, in a convincing manner 
the necessity for greater effort on the next occasion. The zest of a 
game, the spirit of combat, is aroused. The pupil becomes deter- 
mined to “make that line go up.” . . . Of the various devices em- 
ployed in the present investigation, the individual graph made one of 
the strongest appeals to the pupils and proved one of the most effec- 
tive instruments in stimulating their speed in silent reading. (4: 75) 
Frequent and varied devices needed to interest many read- 
ers.—These examples serve to illustrate methods used by skilled 
teachers to interest pupils in silent reading. While the naturally 
talented and voracious readers need little artificial stimulus, 
probably a fourth of each class will do only a small part of the 
reading necessary to develop skill unless they are periodically 
stimulated by varied special devices to arouse their interest. 
We shall now turn our attention to the second phase of a pupil’s 
needs in developing skill in silent reading and to the corre- 
sponding phases of teaching. 
2. Giving ideas and meanings for interpreting reading.— 
The methods that are used in progressive schools to give pupils 
ideas and meanings that will aid them in interpreting reading 
matter were illustrated at length in the two preceding chapters
-P-A-G-E-387
  
SKILLFUL SILENT READING 371 
on understanding social life and problem-solving. It will suffice 
here to give one further example to illustrate this phase of the 
training. The example is from a seventh-grade class that had 
begun the study of Africa at the time the question of the dis- 
position of the German colonies was before the Versailles Peace 
Conference. From the current newspapers and magazines the 
children brought in clippings, some of which were read to the 
class and commented on. Several of the articles proved un- 
intelligible to the children. They found that in order to under- 
stand them, much more information about Africa was needed. 
Later, after five weeks’ study of Africa in their textbook and 
many supplementary sources, the pupils turned to the original 
clippings and to others that had been added, and found that 
they could now read them with understanding. 
3- Building up the pupil’s automatic reading vocabulary. 
—The third need of a child who is to become a skilled silent 
reader (as noted on page 342) is a large automatic reading vocab- 
ulary. We have illustrated the systematic increase of this vocab- 
ulary in the primary grades by a number of devices. These 
include (1) the flash drills with word and phrase cards, and 
(2) the writing of new and difficult words and phrases on 
the board, where they are analyzed phonetically, sometimes 
defined, and, in general, woven into their place in the story. 
This second practice is very common in connection with oral 
reading in the intermediate grades and seems to me very useful. 
The need of it is’ illustrated by some of the absurd mistakes 
that children make. For example, when my youngster was in the 
fourth grade, he would frequently use in conversation words de- 
rived from his wide reading and impart to them the weirdest 
pronunciation. Thus, one day while looking at a catalogue of a 
college, he said, “Here’s a picture of the boogy-zoogy building,” 
meaning biology-and-zodlogy building: While the use of the 
dictionary is to be encouraged in the higher grades in such 
cases, a more rapid growth of the pupils’ automatic vocabularies 
is probably facilitated by continuing to emphasize on the black-
-P-A-G-E-388
  
372, TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
board daily a dozen or more words and phrases from the reading 
matter. These should include not only literary phrases, such as 
“forest primeval,” “unjust sentence,” “infirm steps,” “swarthy- 
skinned,” from recreational reading, but also technical terms, 
such as “irrigation,” “equatorial region,” ‘ Mediterranean,” 
“Teutonic civilization,” etc. 
Individual vocabulary books.—Another device was described 
by a sixth-grade teacher who had organized in her class a 
‘Just-for-Fun Club” which read from a select list of books and 
told stories of what they had read. The vocabulary phase of 
the work was described in these words: 
During the language periods, lessons were given which involved 
the use of ideas gained from their reading. For instance, the chil- 
dren made vocabulary booklets in which they put new and unusual 
words which they had learned to use. One day a week each pupil 
responded to roll call with one new word from his silent reading. 
The word was written on the blackboard, pronounced, and the mean- 
ing was given. Then the child would tell how it had been used in 
his particular reading. 
Other devices.—Several other types of lessons for building 
up the pupils’ automatic reading vocabulary are given on 
pages 197-203 of C. R. Stone’s “Silent and Oral Reading.” 
(1.) The first lesson was based on Poe’s “Bells” and con- 
sisted in listing the various words descriptive of each of the 
kinds of bells. The second lesson was on Hawthorne’s 
“Chimera” and centered in the listing of expressions from the 
reading that meant the same as “Pegasus.” Another lesson 
involved the detailed study of prefixes, suffixes, and word-stems 
in such words as “subtract,” “detract,” etc. Other lessons illus- 
trate in detail other devices for enriching the pupils’ automatic 
reading vocabulary. As suggested on page 343, we may expect 
to have published within a few years adequate systematic 
manuals of devices for acquainting pupils with all the ten 
1 Harriet F. Siewart.

  SKILLFUL SILENT READING 373 
thousand common words which were included by E. L. Thorn- 
dike in his ‘'Teacher’s Word Book,” published in 1921. 
With these impressions of a few devices for (1) arousing a 
pupil’s interest in silent reading, (2) giving him a wealth of 
interpretative ideas and meanings, and (3) increasing his 
automatic reading vocabulary, we are now ready to consider 
the fourth aspect of his training in skillful silent reading; 
namely, practice exercises in the several common kinds of 
cursory and of studious reading. 
4. Practice in cursory and in reflective, studious reading. 
Material and method should be mutually appropriate.— 
Before describing the several kinds of reading matter and read- 
ing exercises to be considered under this heading, let us note 
that the material to be read should be appropriate to the type 
of practice to be given, and, conversely, that the method of 
reading should correspond to the nature of the material. For 
example, considerable rhythmic poetry is particularly appro- 
priate for oral reading rather than silent reading; arithmetic 
problems call for detailed analysis rather than rapid, cursory 
reading; while “Treasure Island” is especially suited to rapid, 
cursory reading for the mere enjoyment of the action. Violations 
of this general principle of adapting the method to the material 
were common in the English classes in high schools a few years 
ago, when poetic English classics would be done to death by 
methods of reading appropriate for a legal contract or for 
directions for building a bridge, but quite inappropriate in 
much esthetic reading. 
a. Exercises in cursory, unreflective reading. Reading 
short stories in readers.—Modern school readers are coming 
more and more to be rich collections of fascinating short stories 
from all lands and literatures. Owing to their wide sale these 
books are comparatively cheap, thus providing a very suitable, 
convenient body of material for rapid, cursory reading. If read 
silently as a class exercise, the material is usually broken into 
suitable units for pauses during which the slow readers catch up 
 
-P-A-G-E-390
  374. TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
with the fast ones. These units are usually thought sections 
suitable for brief comment by pupils and teacher. The units and 
pauses offer opportunities for bringing out new words and 
phrases and for reading orally short selections particularly 
suited to oral reading. While such practices are valuable, it is 
probably desirable, in order to preserve the essential features of 
cursory reading, to arrange for much of this reading to be done 
individually, so that each pupil can advance at his own pace. 
Supplementary story-reading.—The collecting in the class- 
room of a library of storybooks makes it easy to require pupils 
to read whole storybooks silently. For example, when my young- 
ster was in the seventh grade, during November each child who 
could do so was asked to lend an adventure book to the room 
collection. Charging cards were arranged, a library committee 
of pupils appointed, fines collected, etc. After reading a book, 
each pupil filed a report on a card or slip of paper four by six 
inches. Some sample reports are shown on page 375. At the 
end of the month the adventure books were taken home, and the 
children brought animal books, such as those by Ernest Thompson 
Seton, Jack London, and Kipling, to be read during December. 
Cursory reading of books of travel, geography, history, sci- 
ence, etc.—A strong appeal for a large amount of cursory 
reading of popular geographical, historical, and scientific mate- 
rial has been a notable feature of Professor Franklin Bobbitt’s 
recent discussions of reading. He says, for example, that in 
geography pupils should read rapidly many such books as 
Darwin’s “Voyage of the Beagle,” Doubleday’s “Year in a 
Yawl,” Perkins’s “Dutch Twins,” and such periodicals as the 
National Geographic Magazine. In history he suggests that 
pupils read such books as Parkman’s “Oregon Trail,’ Mar- 
shall’s “Scotland’s Story,” and Mowry’s “Inventors and In- 
ventions.” (For his fuller lists see reference 11, at the end of 
this chapter.)

Miss Besse Cannon, who organized a series of exercises in news- 
paper reading and writing, as described in her account printed 
below: 
We had been collecting and selling old newspapers through the 
school. I discovered that very few of the seventh-grade English class 
ever read a daily paper. This disappointed me, so I attempted to give 
them some practice. The first lesson proceeded about as follows : 
Teacher. You have been so generous with your papers this morn- 
ing that I believe you must like to handle them. Charles, if you will 
get on the job and deliver the Star to each pupil, we shall have a 
little reading game with this new material.— What papers are pub- 
lished daily in Kansas City ? 
Rachel. Kansas City Star, Times, Post, and Journal. We take 
those, Miss Cannon. 
T. Very good indeed. Now for our game. We are to discover 
something on each page that has not been on a preceding page. 
Otterson. Gee! I don’t understand, and I want to play that game. 
T. For example, what general name will apply to the kind of read- 
ing on page 1? 
Nena. “Current events.” 
James. I'd say “news.” 
Helen. What about that weather report ? 
James. That’s “news.” 
T. All who feel that “‘news” is the best general name may use it. 
What do you find on the second page which was not on the first 
“news” page? 
Thomas. Advertisements and illustrations. 
T. On page 3? 
William. A cartoon. 
T. How many understand what we are doing? Finish it now, 
alone. You may read for twenty minutes; then I want to talk with 
you again. 
Each child worked interestedly, quietly, and earnestly. They read 
and seemed to enjoy it, sometimes calling a neighbor’s attention to 
some newly discovered item of interest, particularly a mention of 
“our school.”

would be great. May I write the sport page? I know a lot about

T. We'll see how that works out. Tomorrow, hand in your list 
and a page of suggestions for the section you are most interested in. 
You may work at it now until the bell rings. 
The results were as follows: 
1. We had a very clever paper. 
2. We visited the Kansas City Star building. 
3. Fifteen children subscribed for the paper. 
4. The bulletin board was generally filled with clippings.

Elements of skill in cursory reading. Rapid recognition, selec- 
tion, and skipping.—Thus we have given examples of practice 
exercises in cursory silent reading centering in school readers ; 
storybooks; popular books dealing with travel, geography, 
history, and science; and current newspapers. The essential 
elements in skillful cursory reading which such practice con- 
tributes are probably (1) skill in rapidly recognizing words and 
meanings and (2) skill in selecting interesting, significant por- 
tions and skipping the rest. We shall now turn to the discus- 
sion of practice in reflective, studious reading. 
b. Exercises in reflective, studious reading. (1) Detailed 
analysis of meanings.—Material appropriate to this type of 
reading is found in anything in the child’s experience that 
naturally requires detailed analysis to understand it or follow it. 
An example from everyday life is found in the efforts of children 
to understand peculiarly worded hymns. Concerning such ex- 
periences one teacher? said: 
I have great sympathy for children who can’t understand unusual 
arrangements of words. I remember being very much puzzled about 
these lines of a hymn when I was a child: 
Thou of Life the Fountain art, 
Freely let me take of Thee ; 
Spring Thou up within my heart, 
Rise to all eternity.

SKILLFUL SILENT READING 379 
My mother helped me, and I analyzed the first sentence in a 
childish way ; and after that I always felt that I had a method of at- 
tack when I found something that didn’t seem to have any sense 
in it. The exercise was so helpful to me that I like to try to teach 
children to do the same thing. 
Application to arithmetic problems.—Concerning the ap- 
plication of such methods to arithmetic problems, the same 
teacher said: 
Take a sentence like this, for instance: “Separate by points each 
side of a square yard into three equal parts.” It takes considerable 
dynamic force for a fifth-grade child to get through that. The first 
four or five words are likely to confuse him, and if it has not been 
demonstrated to him frequently that those crazy combinations of 
words really mean something, it is likely to floor him. 
One year when everyone was getting interested in reading, and the 
children were beginning to think they could read anything, we came 
upon this: “With a pole or tape a rod in length measure the dis- - 
tance in rods and feet around a square or field.” Some little time 
elapsed; then a child came up to me with his face beaming. I told 
him to whisper the meaning to me if he knew it. “It says for me 
to measure something. May I take the tape measure and go out in 
the yard?” he asked. I said, “John knows what it means, and he 
wants to go out into the yard. Instead of that we will play it is 
a riddle, and he shall be umpire.” Every child in the room was alert. 
That particular type of sentence was soon mastered. 
Training in detailed mathematical reading.—There has been 
less discussion of the devices to be used in teaching such de- 
tailed analysis of meanings than of any of the other types of 
reading. However, the following examples will put us in touch 
with some of the material bearing on such reading in the case 
of mathematics. 
(a) In his “Psychology of Arithmetic” (pp. 89-91) Pro- 
fessor E. L. Thorndike shows that the use in the elementary 
books of words that are rare and unimportant in children’s 
experiences, such as “absentees,” “bouquet,” “bronze,” 
“worsted,” etc., makes the reading and understanding of many 
 
-P-A-G-E-396
380 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
problems unnecessarily difficult for pupils. On the other hand, 
he shows (on pages 133-138 of his “New Methods in Arith- 
metic”) that problems are frequently made “unduly easy” in 
their wording, so that pupils are not required to do the same 
kind of reading as they would if they met such problems in 
social situations where they would be confronted with printed 
price lists and similar complexities. 
(b) In an article entitled “Improving Ability to read Arith- 
metic Problems” (10) Miss Estaline Wilson describes a va- 
riety of devices which are intended to make the pupils realize 
more clearly the social, material, and arithmetical realities in- 
volved. Sometimes the quantitative facts are completely ignored 
until, through reading, discussing, and even dramatizing, the 
pupils have learned what the problems are really about. 
(c) Mr. W. C. Reavis has used extensively, in elementary 
schools, tests consisting of problems without numbers and of in- 
complete problems such as those shown on page 381. Mr. Reavis 
states that the results from these tests readily show which 
teachers have trained their pupils in the careful reading of 
problems and which ones have not. After the first tests have 
been given, noticeable improvements in reading problems may 
be secured by proper supervision. 
(d) Finally, Mr. E. R. Breslich, a noted teacher of high- 
school mathematics, states that when a pupil says he cannot 
understand a problem, he asks, “Not any of it? Look at 
your book and read the first few words. Do you understand 
that?” The pupil usually says “Yes,” and begins to smile. 
Mr. Breslich then has him read through the whole problem, 
phrase by phrase, in the same careful way. Frequently, this 
detailed attack is all that is necessary to master the problem. 
Sometimes a phrase that is not understood is passed for the 
moment and then cleared up after the rest of the problem has 
been read. With each new phase of mathematics (geometry, 
trigonometry, analytical geometry, etc.) Mr. Breslich finds 
that this insistence upon grasping the exact meaning of each

mathematical term must be reiterated. Otherwise, many of the 
pupils will use the term in loose, meaningless ways, or sit in lazy, 
discouraged contemplation of a problem, instead of attacking it 
by a detailed analysis of the meaning of each word and phrase. 
Analyzing meanings in higher technical studies.—Frequently 
in college classes in education I have found it profitable to have 
the class pause for a few moments to dig out the force or mean- 
ing of particular words in a sentence. For example, in one text 
there occurred a psychological definition of the term “sensations” 
as designating “consciousness of qualities or conditions either 
of things or of one’s own body.” One girl who was asked to 
recite upon this point described sensations as “consciousness of 
things of quality.” Such examples are so numerous in technical 
studies that they justify us in giving pupils careful training in 
the detailed analysis of meanings which we have listed first in 
our kinds of reflective, studious reading. 
Elements of skill in detailed analysis of meanings. Knowledge 
of ignorance, courageous attack, persistent application.— Among 
the chief elements of skill in the detailed analysis of meanings 
that a pupil should derive from such practice exercises are the 
following : 
1. To know when he understands and when he does not. 
2. To be courageous and hopeful in attacking difficult words, 
phrases, sentences, paragraphs, etc. 
3. To be persistent in working the material over, getting the 
force of each word, the relations of words in peculiar construc- 
tions, the effects of modifiers, etc. 
(2) Practice exercises in grasping and organizing main 
points.—The type of reflective silent reading indicated in this 
heading has probably been more successfully cared for in recent 
years than any other phase. Most of the examples that experi- 
enced teachers give me in my classes fall under this head. For 
instance, before me is a long description of the methods a fourth- 
grade class used in reading a selection about the Pilgrims and 
finding answers to such questions as these: “Why did the Pil- 
 
-P-A-G-E-399
SKILLFUL SILENT READING 383 
grims leave England?” ‘How did they like Holland?” Another 
teacher described at length a lesson on Socrates in which the 
pupils read rapidly and silently section after section of “Men 
of Old Greece.” After some preliminary discussion of Athens 
and of Socrates, the teacher’s talk, in preparation for reading 
the first section, included such remarks and questions as the fol- 
lowing: “Now turn to the story of Socrates, the boy who lived 
in Athens, and let’s see how his life differed from yours. Find 
out what was prophesied for him when he was a child and 
whether the prophecies came true. See what sort of school he 
attended,” etc. In our account of Miss Shepherd’s seventh- 
grade lessons (on pages 363-365), we gave a detailed descrip- 
tion of her methods of training pupils in finding central 
thoughts in material read. 
Practice in outlining. Graded steps from imitation to inde- 
pendence.—We may supplement these several examples with an 
account of the methods used by an upper-grade geography 
teacher? in training pupils to outline material. The manner in 
which she has graded the steps by first giving the class an exam- 
ple of her own outlining and then gradually assigning more and 
more difficult processes is noteworthy. In any art, imitation 
offers the most effective initiation for giving the learner an 
idea of what to do. Learning the art of outlining is no excep- 
tion to this rule. The five steps in this teacher’s procedure are 
clearly set forth in the following paragraphs : 
1. Teacher's blackboard outlines supplemented by pupils —My 
first step is the assignment of lessons in which I have outlined on 
the board the main points for the class. Together in class we study 
the topics of the outline and of the text, especially noting how the or- 
ganization of the points in the text supports the plan of the outline. 
In the class discussion I help the children to fill out the outline by 
organizing the subordinate material around the central ideas, and 
I give special encouragement to those individuals who are having 
difficulties in the work.

-P-A-G-E-400
  384 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
2. Class develops outline on board.—My next step is the assign- 
ment of lessons to be read intently by the pupils in their supervised 
study period; then at the beginning of the recitation period we 
develop on the blackboard an outline of the assignment. It is here 
that I expect the children to take the initiative—to make suggestions 
as to main and subordinate points, to criticize one another’s state- 
ments, and to give reasons for, and verifications of, suggestion and 
criticisms. This training helps the children to read thoughtfully and 
to search for the pivotal point in each topic or paragraph. After- 
wards the outlines are copied in the pupils’ notebooks. 
3. Individuals outline assignments independently.— Following this 
work comes the assignment of lessons in which each individual pupil 
makes his own outline for the next day’s lesson during the supervised 
study period, and this is the opportune time for me to find out just 
what is the weak pupil’s difficulty. Each day following the day for 
preparation of the outline, the recitation part of the period is spent in 
having different children discuss the main points of the lesson as they 
have organized them in their outline. Detection of faulty silent read- 
ing is then comparatively easy, and many of the children are able 
to give suggestions and make corrections. Often it is evident that 
the children have failed to comprehend as they have read, for they 
have read words—not meanings. 
4. Teacher assigns questions to direct the study.—The fourth stage 
in this development of silent-reading ability is to assign lessons by 
means of questions that will direct the child’s study. These are lead- 
ing questions that demand a thoughtful, comprehensive organization 
of the material as he reads silently. 
5. Individuals devise questions covering main points —Following 
this, I assign lessons in which I ask the pupils to make out lists 
of questions that they think cover the essential elements of the 
lesson. This step is greatly in advance of the previous step, for now 
the child is thrown entirely upon his own powers of effective silent 
reading, of interpretation, and of organization. Such questions, given 
by pupils, as do not center around fundamental and vital points of 
the lesson are criticized in the class discussion, and an effort is made 
to lead each child to read main factors as main factors and subordi- 
nate elements as subordinate elements. 
Experimental proof of value of practice in grasping, organiz- 
ing, and outlining main points.—A technique in outlining and
-P-A-G-E-401
  
SKILLFUL SILENT READING 385 
studying, somewhat similar to that just described, was taught 
to pupils by Mr. W. L. Beauchamp in an experiment con- 
ducted in 1922 in The University of Chicago High School. He 
taught two parallel and similar classes in general science so 
that all studying was done in the classroom under supervision. 
One class was given specific instruction and practice, for a 
period of about three months, in economical and effective out- 
lining of main points and subpoints. The other class was al- 
lowed to pursue its own devices in taking notes, reviewing, etc. 
At the end of each large unit of subject matter (covering three 
or four weeks of study) the pupils in both classes were tested 
regarding their ability to reproduce all they could remember of 
the unit. It was found that the class that had been given the 
special training reproduced 8 per cent more at the end of the 
first unit, 27 per cent more at the end of the second unit, and 
73 per cent more at the end of the third unit than did the 
untrained class. 
Elements of skill in grasping and organizing main points.— 
These examples illustrate clearly the exercises and devices that 
numerous skilled teachers are using to give pupils practice in 
grasping and organizing the main points of an article or chapter 
during silent reading. As suggested on page 348, these exercises 
may include (1) reading with the definite intention of culling 
the main points; (2) underlining these; (3) reviewing the mate- 
rial to note them; (4) recalling them mentally after finishing 
the reading; (5) writing an outline of them; (6) discussing 
them with someone. From such practice the pupils should 
form habits of carrying on such activities in much of their 
reflective, studious reading. 
(3) Reading to remember main ideas.—As indicated on 
page 349, effective reading to grasp and organize the main ideas 
also contributes to remembering these ideas. However, after 
they are once grasped and organized they may be forgotten 
unless they are reviewed sufficiently to fix them in mind. Con- 
siderable investigation has been devoted to determining the best
-P-A-G-E-402
  386 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
methods of memorizing organized material that we desire to 
retain. Some of the conclusions from these investigations I have 
utilized in drawing up the following directions to students in my 
own classes who are studying for tests upon assigned readings in 
textbooks. They are reprinted here so that they may be of 
service to some students of this text. You may not only follow 
them, if you care to, in your own studying but you may also 
modify them and adapt them to training pupils in the upper 
grades or in high school. 
HOW TO STUDY FOR THE TESTS 
In order to succeed in the tests you will need to study each assign- 
ment several times. The following procedure is suggested : 
1. First rapid reading —(a) Read a chapter through as rapidly as 
you can comprehend it. (b) If you own the text, underline a few 
“key” words or phrases in each paragraph. Watch alertly for 
these. As a rule, don’t underline long statements. (c) Determine 
your reading rate by writing on the margin of the page the time of 
starting a chapter, and later noting the time when you stop reading 
or are interrupted. From the number of pages completed compute 
the number of pages you can read in an hour. Fast readers will 
read fifty pages an hour; average readers, about thirty pages an 
hour. Those who read more slowly than this are handicapped by 
a slow reading rate. 
2. Review for outlining —(a) After this rapid first reading, review 
the chapter and outline its main points and subpoints mentally. 
(b) Assist this mental outlining by numbering the points with pencil 
in the book (if you own it). Use some such scheme as “I,” “A,” 
“r,” “a” to indicate main divisions and subdivisions. (c) Many 
students will be further assisted by making a sketchy written out- 
line consisting of the “key” words and phrases numbered as in (0). 
Other students will profit more by merely rereading the underlined and 
numbered points and trying to form a clear mental outline of them. 
Think carefully. Write rapidly. Use few words. Your grasp of the 
organization of the chapter as well as its specific points will be tested. 
3. Review for memorizing ideas and organization.—After the chap- 
ter has been comprehended and outlined as described above, restudy 
the text and your outline (mental or written) several times in order
-P-A-G-E-403
  SKILLFUL SILENT READING 387 
to fix the particular ideas and their organization in your memory. 
Try to recall from your outline the related discussion in the text. 
4. Psychological intervals—Begin at least six days beforehand 
your study of the portion of the text assigned for a test. By the 
second day before the test you should have all the assignment well 
outlined, its organization fairly clear, and the ideas fairly well mem- 
orized. The day before the test, carefully review your outline 
(mental or written) and the text and clear up points which you 
cannot easily recall from memory. Before coming to class try to 
get an unhurried “last look” at your outline. If these directions 
are followed, your record in the tests will be greatly benefited. 
5. Attend to questions strictly—When the questions are placed 
on the board put all books and outlines away. Pay careful attention 
to the wording of the questions and give concisely what is asked for. 
Be sure that your fountain pen is filled or your pencil well sharpened. 
Have several sheets of paper ready so that you will not have to open 
your notebooks to get a new supply. The time is limited but ample. 
(4) Practice in the critical evaluation of statements. Con- 
troversy over the battle of Lexington——Perhaps the most 
infrequent type of practice in silent reading in elementary 
schools is practice in critically evaluating printed statements in 
order to determine if they are true or valid, or if they are 
inconsistent, or if the policy they express is sound and profit- 
able, etc. The possibilities of organizing such practice, however, 
particularly in historical studies, are suggested by the many con- 
troversial questions that arise in determining historical truths and 
policies. For example, Who was responsible for the actual be- 
ginning of hostilities in our Revolutionary War—the Americans 
or the British? In the case of the recent World War we became 
familiar with the gravity of such questions when diplomatic 
books of various colors were issued by the several European 
governments, with evidence intended to throw upon their enemies 
the blame for beginning the war. Great skill was required for 
an American to read these accounts so as to get at the real truth 
in the matter. In the case of the American Revolution the issue 
centers to a considerable extent in the question Who fired the
-P-A-G-E-404
388 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
first shot at the battle of Lexington—the British regular soldiers 
or the Massachusetts militia? There are numerous documents 
tending to support contradictory answers to this question. 
Some of these documents have been brought together in a volume 
entitled “Parallel Source Problems in American History,” in- 
tended primarily for college students, but it is obvious from the 
brief quotations printed below that even eighth-grade pupils 
could canvass with profit some of the more elementary evi- 
dence. One of the eighteen documents printed in the Lexing- 
ton chapter of the “Sources” and signed by “One of the 
Committee for Safety” begins as follows: 
Watertown, Wednesday morning, 
Near ten o’clock, April 19, 1775 
To ALL Frrenps oF AMERICAN LIBERTY LET IT BE KNOWN: 
That this morning before break of day, a Brigade, consisting of 
about one thousand or twelve hundred men, landed at Phipp’s farm 
at Cambridge, and marched to Lexington, where they found a Com- 
pany of our Colony Militia in Arms, upon whom they fired without 
any provocation, and killed six men and wounded four others. By 
an express from Boston, we find... (13) 
You can readily imagine the effect of such news upon Ameri- 
can readers of that day. On the other hand, you can realize 
the importance of the contradictory testimony given by an officer 
of the British regulars to the effect that the colonial militia fired 
first upon the approaching regulars, etc. 
Standards for evaluating testimony concerning events.—Al- 
most every day in reading the newspapers we are confronted 
with the necessity of evaluating, in connection with momentous 
issues, just such contradictory accounts as appear in these colo- 
nial testimonies. In view of this fact the following critical 
notes from the introduction to the eighteen Lexington sources 
are very instructive: 
We naturally wish to know (1) What opportunity did each witness 
have for learning the truth? Was he a participant in the events
-P-A-G-E-405

described? Was he a spectator? Or did he get his information from 
eyewitnesses, or only from heresay? We try to determine also (2) 
what possible motives existed for downright falsehood, or for twist- 
ing or coloring the truth, or for suppressing part of it, or for mis- 
interpreting facts. How probable is it that each particular witness 
would be affected by any of these motives? It is safe to ask also (3) 
What are the possibilities for honest mistakes or for self-deception 
on the part of any witness? How soon after the event was the 
record made? (13: 5) 
Historical problems organized by experts safer than current 
problems.—It would be possible for a teacher to give pupils 
training in critically evaluating contradictory accounts of current 
events as found in the daily papers or in such unbiased reviews 
as the Literary Digest. It would probably be dangerous, how- 
ever, to permit most ordinary teachers to attempt this. On the 
other hand, from interesting historical sources expert historians 
can organize and publish source material concerning significant 
questions of the past which will provide almost as valuable 
training as could be secured from controversial accounts of cur- 
rent events. The types of problems to be set for the study of 
such sources are suggested by the following quotations from the 
material on the battle of Lexington: 
The student in all cases should be prepared to give the exact 
references to sources justifying his answers. 
1. What connected accounts on each side seem to you of most 
importance? Why? 
2. What was the fundamental point on which the accounts dif- 
fered? Why was it important ? 
3. Why do the contemporary American accounts emphasize the 
dispersing of the Lexington company ? 
4. What statements in extracts 1, 2, and 3 are not confirmed by the 
rest of the evidence? (13: 9) 
Twenty-four more questions are contained in the assignment. 
Need ready-made materials to provide for critical evaluations.

suitable for practice in such critical evaluating reading would 
provide training in one of the most important forms of reading 
that adults are called upon to do. The material should prepare 
not only for evaluating accounts of current events in later life 
but also for evaluating proposed laws, seeing the bearings of cur- 
rent laws, finding the hidden implications in contracts, evaluat- 
ing varied interpretation of the Bible, etc. As indicated on 
page 350, such material should give the pupil practice in the 
following activities : 
1. Recalling related facts and evidence with which to test the 
truth or value of the printed statements. 
2. Making cross comparisons within a single document to 
ascertain inconsistencies, contradictions, supporting arguments, 
etc. 
3. Comparing with other documents bearing on the same 
question. 
The technique of training in problem-solving (summarized on 
pages 323-324) is practically all applicable in training pupils 
in doing this type of critical evaluating reading. 
(5) Practice in bibliographical research—We have now 
reached the final type of reflective, studious reading in our dis- 
cussion; namely, practice in consulting books and periodicals 
to discover needed information or to find answers to problems. 
We have called this practice in bibliographical research. Such 
practice is becoming very common in progressive elementary 
schools, and examples abound particularly in the books on how 
to study. For instance, in the study of the partitioning of Africa 
mentioned on page 371, the seventh-grade pupils searched for 
needed information in the following manner: they consulted 
(1) their textbook in geography ; (2) supplementary geograph- 
ical readers on Africa; (3) other special books about Africa; 
(4) special books on related subjects, such as exploration, 
railroad-building, etc.; (5) current newspapers and magazines, 
as well as some newspapers five, ten, and twenty-five years old; 
(6) a children’s encyclopedia,
-P-A-G-E-407
  
SKILLFUL SILENT READING 391 
Drill game in using index etc.—A device for giving drill in 
consulting the index, the table of contents, the maps, etc. in 
such a study as that outlined above is contained in the following 
description by a sixth-grade teacher: + 
A GAME 
Material : Supplementary reader on South America containing (1) 
alphabetical index, (2) twelve map plates, (3) chapter titles. 
Method: Use large white cards on each of which is printed one 
item from the material. Give each pupil a copy of the book and 
explain the game. Then hold up one card and have the pupils find 
the reference. The one who finishes first stands. He receives the 
card. There are fifty gards, and the one who receives the largest 
number wins the game. 
To interest all pupils in such games some handicapping 
arrangements should be made, such as having one team of six 
slow readers compete with another similar team, or having one 
team of fast readers compete with another similar team. In any 
case the slow readers should feel they have a chance to win 
occasionally or to aid some team in winning. 
Research on the value of mountains.—Another geography 
example occurs in the work of the teacher? whose systematic 
eighth-grade training in outlining was described on page 383. 
She followed this training with the practice described in the 
following quotation: 
The next step is the assignment of topics in the form of problems, 
and several references are cited which the children must read silently. 
” [ shall illustrate this with a type lesson. 
The problem was stated as follows: From the human standpoint 
would it be better if there were no mountains in the world? The 
references were several standard geography texts. 
From the previous study of the meaning of economic relations, 
the pupils themselves decided to place on a large sheet of paper 
these words: “Economic Relations of Mountains”; and at the top 
1Florence Woodson. 2Hannah Lindahl. 
 
-P-A-G-E-408
  
392 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
of the left-hand side of the page to place the word “Advantages,” and 
at the top of the right-hand side “ Disadvantages.” Each child then 
read silently the various references and organized the points under two 
headings, having been cautioned to make no duplications. The next 
day the lists were brought to class and were freely discussed, criticized, 
verified, clarified, and illustrated by members of the class. Having 
made our lists satisfactory to the class, we then worked on the prob- 
lem of judging the influence of these advantages and disadvantages. 
Fifth-grade research in writing a historical play.—Even as 
low as the fifth grade we not uncommonly find teachers giving 
pupils practice in looking through the table of contents and in- 
dex of a textbook or of a supplementary reader, or even in con- 
sulting a children’s encyclopedia in order to find material needed 
for some purpose. An elaborate example of such research in - 
the study of history occurred in the case of the fifth-grade class, 
which was engaged in writing a play to represent the fusion of 
Roman and Germanic civilization in Great Britain (as described 
on page 203). The considerable amount of investigation in 
books which is entailed by such activity probably justifies us in 
characterizing even such fifth-grade activity as practice in bib- 
liographical research, the last of the types of reflective, studious 
reading included in our discussion. 
Review of elements in training in skillful silent reading.— 
As outlined on page 351, the whole task of training pupils to be 
skillful silent readers includes the following elements: (1) 
arousing interest; (2) giving a stock of interpretative ideas; 
(3) building up an automatic reading vocabulary; (4) giving 
practice in both (a) cursory, unreflective reading and (b) re- ° 
flective, studious reading, including (1) detailed analysis of 
meanings, (2) grasping and organizing main points, (3) reading 
to remember, (4) critical evaluating of statements, and (5) bib- 
liographical research. In nearly all the cases it was possible 
to secure numerous illustrations from progressive schools of 
teachers actually engaged in conducting appropriate exercises. 
The most notable exceptions were in the detailed analysis of
-P-A-G-E-409
  SKILLFUL SILENT READING 393 
meanings and the critical evaluation of statements, in which 
less practice is being given than in the other types of reading. 
In the second case, however, the abundance of suitable material 
for the critical study of historical sources makes it only a 
matter of time until ready-made collections with appropriate 
problems will be prepared by historical experts and published 
for use in elementary schools. 
Make pupils aware of rules in skillful silent reading.— 
After educators have themselves become clear concerning the 
practices to pursue in the various types of skillful silent reading, 
we may not only give pupils practice in the several types but 
also teach them the rules to follow. For example, in the detailed 
analysis of obscure or difficult meanings, the pupils might be 
taught: (1) in the case of important obscure words, to remember 
to consult the dictionary for the meanings; (2) in the case of 
involved poetic sentences, to search for the subject and predi- 
cate; and (3) in involved arithmetic problems, to outline the 
major and minor steps in the solution before beginning to cipher. 
In such reading as determining the validity of printed testi- 
mony, the historians have already developed certain standards 
(such as those quoted on pages 388-389) which pupils should 
learn to use in judging the probable truth of statements that 
they encounter in their newspaper-reading. Eventually we shall 
probably have such rules for procedure in all types of silent 
reading formulated in simple manuals for practice which any 
well-trained teacher can easily follow. 
Increasing rates of reading in each type.—In the types of 
reading that we have described, the pupil’s rate is likely to in- 
crease as he masters the elements of skill appropriate to each 
type. Additional increase may be secured by timing the pupil’s 
performances in each type, urging him to greater speed, keeping 
graphs, etc. (as illustrated on pages 358 and 370). Some- 
times training in one type (such as careful analytical reading) 
may interfere with the rate in some other type (such as rapid 
cursory reading).

394. TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
Conclusion of chapter on silent reading.—This concludes 
our discussion of the third of the “four thoughtful processes” to 
be discussed in Part II of the text. The first of these was 
understanding social life. The other three—namely, problem- 
solving, silent reading, and the communication of ideas—are 
intellectual activities in which progressive elementary schools 
endeavor more and more to give pupils skill. In the case of 
problem-solving we found that a very definite technique has 
been perfected for giving pupils practice and skill. In silent 
reading we found that the schools are busily engaged in trying 
to devise such a technique. In the next chapter, on learning to 
communicate ideas, we shall find that the principles of correct 
teaching have been clearly realized for some time and that con- 
siderable scientific progress has been made in perfecting prac- 
tice exercises and a definite technique of teaching.

  CHAPTER XII 
PRACTICE IN COMMUNICATING IDEAS 
Main points of the chapter.—r. Topics from everyday activities 
replaced discussions of abstract virtues in elementary composition 
- during the nineteenth century. 
2. Emphasis was shifted by Pestalozzi from written to oral 
expression. 
3. He also emphasized the following practical rules for training 
pupils in expression : 
a. Make sure that the pupil has clear ideas to express. 
b. Build up his vocabulary. 
c. Train him to keep in mind longer and longer series of ideas 
to be expressed. 
4. Conversational or discussion lessons in all subjects were another 
Pestalozzian development that gave pupils active vocabularies along 
many lines. - 
5. Toward the end of the nineteenth century we get these two 
additions to the Pestalozzian practices : 
a. Contribution recitations for training pups in presenting a 
series of new ideas to an audience. 
b. The creation of real audience situations to appeal to the strong 
instinctive interest in communication and to give standards for judg- 
ing the effectiveness of the pupil’s performance. 
6. The importance of oral communication at present is shown 
by its use in conversations, practical discussions, dictated business 
letters, and short talks. 
7. The following types of school activities especially train in 
oral communication : 
a. Conversational and discussion lessons. 
b. Contribution recitations. 
c. Telling selected points after silent weadine! 
d. Special expressional devices, such as composing plays and con- 
ducting a current-events club.

PRACTICE IN COMMUNICATING IDEAS 397 
8. Written communication is especially practiced in the ele- 
mentary school in letter-writing and in written reports in the content 
subjects. 
9. Varied oral and written practice with a rich social topic that 
is intensively studied in the English periods furnishes some of the 
best training in communicating ideas. 
to. Practice in correct grammatical usage is being organized on 
the basis of scientific knowledge of the common errors in children’s 
speech. 
11. The success of instruction in written composition is being 
judged by standard tests and scores. 
12. Drawing, as a means of communicating ideas, may be taught 
with the same emphasis upon expressing some experience to others 
and building up a pupil’s expressional vocabulary that we found in 
the case of teaching linguistic communication. 
Introduction.—Learning to communicate ideas is the last 
of the “four thoughtful processes,” or four types of learning, to 
be discussed in Part II of this book. The phrase “training in 
expression” might also have been used to furnish a title for this 
chapter, but the title ‘Practice in Communicating Ideas” has 
been chosen instead, because it suggests one of the most impor- 
tant factors in modern training in expression ; namely, the exist- 
ence of a real audience to which the ideasare to be communicated. 
Sections of the chapter.—We shall divide our chapter into 
the following sections : 
I. History and principles of teaching composition (p. 398). 
II. Practice in oral communication (p. 407). 
III. Practice in written communication (p. 424). 
IV. Varied oral and written practice with a rich social topic 
(p. 439)- 
V. Correct grammatical practice; scientific outlines (p. 448). 
VI. Measuring the results of practice in composition (p. 453). 
VII. Learning to communicate ideas through drawings (p. 457): 
The first section, which follows the historical method, will 
quickly introduce us to the fundamental principles of training in 
the communication of ideas.

398 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
Section I. History AND PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING 
CoMPoSsITION: FROM WRITTEN TO ORAL 
Example. Vitalizing composition in a country school. 
From “Virtue” and “Honesty” to “Making soap” and “ Hunt- 
ing squirrels.” —About 1820 a Harvard student came to a coun- 
try school in New England to teach during a term in order to 
earn some money to continue his college education, He in- 
troduced the “newfangled” subject of composition, which had 
never been taught in that school before. Taking his topics from 
his college rhetoric courses, he asked the older pupils to write 
compositions on such subjects as “Humility,” “Virtue is its 
own reward,” “Honesty is the best policy.” 
Great distress immediately resulted among the few pupils in 
the class. Susie was humble. enough herself, but had no ideas 
on humility to express. She stared blankly ahead of her for a 
time, and then gave it up and cried. Tom fidgeted for a while, 
looked around to see what the others were doing, dug at his desk, 
but produced no ideas on humility or virtue or honesty. The 
subject of composition was a dismal failure, and the teacher 
abandoned it. 
After “living around” in the neighborhood, however, for a 
week or so, he took a fresh start. ‘‘Susie,” he said, on Monday 
morning, “when I passed your house on Saturday I saw you 
were making soap. You seemed to be having some trouble with 
it. What was the matter?” After a brief oral statement from 
Susie, he said, ‘“‘That’s interesting; suppose you write us an 
account of it.” To the boy he said: “Tom, I saw you had a 
couple of squirrels when you came out of Smith’s woods. How 
did you get them?” After a brief oral statement from Tom, 
the boy was asked to write the story of his squirrel hunt. With 
this change in the type of topics assigned for compositions, the 
subject changed from one of dismal, fruitless drudgery to one of 
great popularity. The reasons are easy to see. The pupils were 
now concerned with interesting topics from everyday life, con-
-P-A-G-E-415
  
  PRACTICE IN COMMUNICATING IDEAS 399 
cerning which they were well informed, and they felt that the 
teacher was really interested in hearing about their experiences. 
Change from abstract topics to telling of real, personal 
experiences.— This anecdote epitomizes the history of composi- 
tion topics in American schools during the nineteenth century. 
Such abstract topics as were first used in this country school 
were common in nearly all schools up to 1890, and are still found 
in classes where the work is not adapted to pupils’ experiences 
and modern social needs. For example, I recently read a first- 
year high-school composition entitled ‘‘Inspiration”—a dismal, 
halting, illogical, contentless production—written in 1920. It 
was refreshing to turn from it to a boy’s lively account of his 
first experience in operating a well-known make of automobile. 
Emphasis shifted from written to oral composition. 
Pestalozzi’s crude pioneer lessons.—In elementary schools, how- 
ever, below the sixth grade, practice in written communication 
now occupies a very small place in progressive schools compared 
with the practice in oral communication. The introduction of 
oral composition in elementary schools dates back to the time of 
Pestalozzi (1746-1827), the great Swiss educator who intro- 
duced many of the educational reforms that were adopted during 
the nineteenth century. In 1799, during a war between the 
French and other nations, a certain Swiss village named Stanz 
was devastated just as villages were in Belgium during the 
World War. A great horde of the orphaned children were 
gathered in a building and Pestalozzi was placed in charge. He 
was eager to teach them but had no adequate facilities, so he re- 
sorted largely to concert recitations in which they repeated after 
him things that he said. In a few months he moved to another 
poorly equipped elementary school and carried his crude but 
novel oral methods with him. We have the following description, 
by one of his pupils, of the oral language lessons of this school : 
The language exercises were the best thing we had, especially those 
on the wall paper of the schoolroom. . .. We spent hours before 
this old and torn paper, occupied in examining the number, form,
-P-A-G-E-416
    
400 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
position, and color of the different designs, holes, and rents, and 
expressing our ideas in more and more enlarged sentences. Thus 
Pestalozzi would ask, ‘Boys, what do you see?” 
Answer. A hole in the paper. 
Pestalozzi. Very well, say after me: “I see a hole in the paper.” 
“I see a long hole in the paper.” 
“Through the hole I see the wall.” 
“Through the long, narrow hole I see the wall.” 
“I see figures on the paper.” 
“T see black figures on the paper.” 
“I see round black figures on the paper.” 
“T see a square yellow figure on the paper.” 
“By the side of the square yellow figure I see a round black one.” 
“The square figure is joined to the round figure by a large black 
stripe, etc.” (23: 326) 
Three Pestalozzian principles: clear ideas, increasing 
vocabulary, series of ideas.—Such pioneer lessons by Pesta- 
lozzi, while not as artistic as the best present-day teaching, 
exemplify three important principles in the teaching of primary 
oral composition. 
1. Clear ideas.—The first principle is to make sure that 
pupils have clear ideas to express. In this case, as in the New 
England country-school example, the ideas are derived from 
real, personal experiences. In Pestalozzi’s lessons actual objects 
from the schoolroom or objects observed during excursions were 
used to give the experiences. f 
2. Increasing vocabulary.—The second principle is steadily 
to build up the pupil’s vocabulary.» In Pestalozzi’s lessons with 
his great horde of children this was done through imitative con- 
cert recitations. In this respect we shall find improvements upon 
his technique at the present day, but it is important to notice 
that such imitative repetition of language is really an effective 
method of increasing a learner’s vocabulary. We shall notice 
below how this is done in a modern first-grade lesson on “The 
Three Billy Goats Gruff.” Evidence of the efficiency of this 
method in aiding in increasing a person’s speaking vocabulary
-P-A-G-E-417
  
PRACTICE IN COMMUNICATING IDEAS — 4or 
is found in the learning of a foreign language by a conversa- 
tional method. In such cases, if the class is small, rapid concert 
repetition after the teacher is a most fruitful aid in giving pupils 
a ready command of an oral vocabulary. 
3. Keeping longer and longer series of ideas in mind.— 
The third principle of Pestalozzi’s method is to give practice in 
“expressing . . . ideas in more and more enlarged sentences” 
and series. You will notice that the first sentence in his lesson 
contains no adjectives, the second contains one adjective, the 
third is slightly more complex, and so on until the last sentence 
contains quite a complicated statement. Practice in keeping in 
mind longer and longer series of ideas is one big essential in 
training in oral composition. The importance of this factor 
appears strikingly in the composing of long addresses or even 
books by dictating them. Thus, one of my colleagues who is well 
known as one of the best educational speakers in the country 
owes a part of his skill to his ability to keep a long series of ideas 
clearly in mind. For example, with few notes, he dictated to a 
stenographer one of his most important books, working at it 
about three hours a morning for about three months. To do this 
he had to keep in mind practically the whole book. While such 
extreme skill is attained only with large native talent for oral 
expression, yet everyone who expresses himself orally must learn 
to keep in mind a number of points, and we see how Pestalozzi’s 
crude primary lessons aimed to give young children practice in 
doing this by gradually enlarging the sentences which they used. 
Descriptive narrative helps pupil to keep series of ideas in 
mind.—About 1840—that is, about forty years after Pesta- 
lozzi’s lesson described above—Calvin E. Stowe of Ohio and 
Horace Mann of Massachusetts made separate visits to Europe 
and found Pestalozzian language lessons in vogue in several 
places. Stowe described one first-grade lesson as follows: 
A boy has assigned to him for a lesson a description of the re- 
markable objects in certain directions from the schoolhouse, which 
is situated in Little Cathedral Street. He proceeds as follows:
-P-A-G-E-418
  402, TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
“When I come out of the schoolhouse into Little Cathedral Street 
and turn to the right, I soon pass on my left hand the Maria Place, 
the Gymnasium, and the Anklam Gate. When I come out of Little 
Cathedral Street,” etc. (23: 330) 
In this lesson we see the practice in keeping a series of ideas 
in mind better exemplified than in the lesson on the hole in the 
wall paper. The nature of the topic—namely, ‘What I see as 
I walk down the street ”—especially aids the pupil to keep the 
series of ideas in mind. Simple narratives of actual events and 
descriptions of objects in a fixed order are especially suited, then, 
to give this type of training. 
Thus we see how the early pioneer lessons of Pestalozzi, as 
gradually improved upon by later educators, provided three 
of the technical essentials in training in elementary oral com- 
position; namely, (1) clear ideas based on real experiences, (2) 
additions to the pupil’s vocabulary, (3) practice in keeping in 
mind longer and longer series of ideas. In the next paragraph 
we shall see how the American observers of Pestalozzian lessons 
in Europe noted the large amount of training in oral expression 
that occurred in the more informal conversational lessons ahout 
natural phenomena. 
Conversational methods train in conveying ideas.—After 
describing lessons which he observed, Horace Mann emphasized 
the value of such conversational object lessons for training in 
oral communication in the following words: 
The method I have described necessarily leads to conversation, and 
conversation with an intelligent teacher secures several important 
objects. It communicates information. It brightens ideas before 
only dimly apprehended. . . . It teaches the child to use language, 
to frame sentences, to select words which convey his whole meaning, 
to avoid those which convey either more or less than he intends to 
express ; in fine, it teaches him to seek for thoughts upon a subject and 
then to find appropriate language in which to clothe them. (28: 331) 
Conversation lessons in geography etc. give pupils active 
technical vocabularies,—This paragraph describes what is still
-P-A-G-E-419
  
PRACTICE IN COMMUNICATING IDEAS = 403 
one of the best forms of training in oral communication to be 
found even in the most progressive elementary schools ; namely, 
the conversation and discussion lessons in the regular school 
subjects. Such lessons were described in our earlier chapters. 
For example, in the chapter on problem-solving we considered 
a second-grade class planning the costume for an Arab doll, a 
fifth-grade class discussing freely the development of London, 
and a seventh-grade class debating almost with the skill and 
vocabulary of educated adults the desirability of increasing 
America’s sugar production. 
In such discussions the child’s stock of ideas is carried far 
beyond the realm of immediate experiences—of such objects as 
wall paper and citystreets—to the realm of such distant phenom- 
ena as tidal rivers, marshy banks, docks, and factories in for- 
eign lands, and such abstractions as millions of pounds of sugar, 
the number of growing-days required for sugar cane, compet- 
ing crops, the tariff, etc. The pupil’s vocabulary grows apace 
with his ideas. Moreover, it is not merely a reading vocabulary, 
but one that he has actively at his tongue’s end as a result of 
practice in using it in the discussions. 
Conclusion of discussion of Pestalozzi’s oral training.—One 
element in skilled oral expression that is lacking in such con- 
versational discussions is the keeping in mind of a long series 
of ideas which is to be expressed. This factor is best provided 
for by organizing in the content subjects “contribution recita- 
tions.” Before turning to these, let us note that our historical 
study of the Pestalozzian methods has given us the following 
points: (1) Pestalozzi placed the emphasis upon training in oral 
communication instead of written; (2) in his training in oral 
expression he emphasized (a) clear ideas based on real experi- 
ences, (b) additions to the child’s vocabulary, (c) practice in 
keeping in mind longer and longer series of ideas; (3) the con- 
versational recitations which grew out of the Pestalozzian reforms 
give pupils fluent use of the technical vocabularies of all the 
elementary-school subjects.

404. TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
Developments since Pestalozzi. Contribution recitations. 
Give practice in presenting series of ideas to an audience.—Two 
notable additions to the Pestalozzian training in oral expression 
were made toward the close of the nineteenth century. These 
were (1) the development of contribution recitations and 
(2) emphasis on the creation of real audience situations. In 
the contribution recitation a pupil contributes to the group’s 
discussion of a topic an account of some related matter that he 
has especially studied. He may say only a few short sentences 
or he may talk two or three minutes. In such a case there is 
a real audience situation, consisting of (1) persons who are 
interested, or who are to be interested, in hearing about a certain 
matter; and (2) a speaker with new material to present to them. 
Such contribution recitations were introduced into elementary 
schools late in the nineteenth century, but did not receive much 
emphasis until improved school libraries made it possible for 
pupils to read different accounts of the topic under discussion. 
Audience situations. Create interest through appeal to in- 
stinct of communication.—The emphasis on audience situations, 
as a desirable factor in practice in communication, became strong 
toward the close of the nineteenth century as a result of the in- 
creased knowledge of human instincts. Psychologists emphasized 
the instinct of communication as one of the strongest of human 
inborn tendencies. From the instinctive babbling of babies up 
to the most irrepressible senatorial oratory we find this tendency 
exemplified. Since it is such a powerful instinctive driving 
force, it is wise to utilize it in giving interest to school practice 
in expression and communication. This fact has been especially 
emphasized during the last twenty-five years (1895-1920) by 
such leaders in educational thought and practice as Professor 
John Dewey. Dewey well expressed the fundamental audience 
idea when he said, ‘‘ Language is primarily a social thing, a means 
by which we give our experiences to others and get theirs in 
return.” From this position it naturally follows that the proper 
basis for vital training in communication includes (1). the pupil
-P-A-G-E-421
PRACTICE IN COMMUNICATING IDEAS 405 
with some experience he desires to express, and (2) an audience 
that he feels is interested to learn of his experience. 
Audience idea gradually winning a place in training in com- 
munication,—This is essentially the situation that the New 
England country-school teacher created when he inquired about 
Susie’s soap-making and Tom’s squirrel hunt and asked them 
to tell him about their experiences. Hence we see the idea of 
creating real audience situations is not new in methods of train- 
ing in expression. Yet it took extensive efforts of psychologists 
and leading educators after the close of the nineteenth century 
to bring about its general adoption even in progressive schools, 
and it is still woefully absent in many schools where training 
in composition is the driest and least vital of subjects. 
Audience situations also give basis for judging success of 
communication.—The establishment of real audience situations 
for practice in communicating ideas not only stimulates interest 
through appeal to the pupils’ instinct of communication but also 
gives a natural basis for judging the effectiveness of each per- 
formance and for determining the specific needs for improvement. 
We found one example of this fact in the description (on 
pages 242-244) of the planning of an assembly exercise by a 
fifth-grade geography class. When one pupil suggested discus- 
sing “How Japan gained her colonies,” the class debated whether 
this would be understood by the fourth-grade pupils in the 
assembly. Later, other proposals were rejected because they 
would “mix up” these fourth-graders. In general, under the 
guidance of the teacher these pupils kept asking themselves, 
“Will this material or this mode of presentation be clear to the 
audience? Will it be interesting? Will it give them the right 
impression ?” 
Pupil considers how audience is interested, instructed, and 
impressed.—This practice in keeping in mind the point of view 
and interests of the particular audience to whom the ideas are to 
be presented is one of the most important in successful training 
in communicating ideas. It is an indispensable addition to the
-P-A-G-E-422
  
406 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
pupil’s technique and skill in expression. A pupil may have the 
other three attainments which we have mentioned—namely, 
clear ideas, an adequate vocabulary, and skill in keeping a long 
series of ideas in mind—and yet absolutely bore his audience 
with a presentation unadapted to its understanding or interests. 
The person who speaks or writes glibly from his own point of 
view, but fails to get his message “‘over” to his audience— fails 
to interest, instruct, and impress his hearers or readers—is not 
successfully communicating ideas, although he may be express- 
ing them. Hence, as we indicated in opening the chapter, we 
prefer the title “Practice in Communicating Ideas” to the title 
“Training in Expression,” since the former places the emphasis 
upon what the listeners or readers get and how they are interested, 
informed, and impressed by the expressional efforts of the pupil. 
Old-fashioned recitation develops callous indifference to audi- 
ence effects.—Instead of developing an adequate regard for the 
audience effects that are being produced, some of the methods 
of recitation that are used in the old-fashioned school so dull the 
pupil’s feeling for these effects that he tends to disregard 
them altogether. This may frequently be the case in the 
ordinary recitations, in which each pupil recites material that 
all the other members of the class have studied in common. The 
consequent lack of any natural audience stimulus in such a 
situation is reflected in the listless, inattentive attitude of the 
other pupils and in the indifference of the speaker, who is con- 
cerned merely to show that he knows the assignment. If instead 
of such a situation the pupil is required to present new material 
or a new interpretation of old material in such a manner as to 
interest, instruct, and impress his audience, not only will the 
whole spirit of the classroom be changed but the pupil will be 
developing skill in judging his own expressional efforts, and 
the crop of irrepressible bores who inflict their uninteresting 
messages upon the world may be reduced.

effects.—In this section we chose to introduce our subject by a 
review of the principles of training in communication as these 
have developed historically in modern elementary schools. We 
did this (1) because of the obvious progress shown in some of 
the early sample lessons; (2) because of the early emphasis on 
oral composition by Pestalozzi; and (3) because of the clearness 
with which the fundamental principles of training in communica- 
tion stand out in the historical discussion. These principles may 
be summarized now in somewhat inverted order, as follows: 
I. The first essential in vital training in communication is to 
create real audience situations consisting of (1) the pupil, with 
some experience he desires to express; and (2) an audience 
that he feels is interested, or can be interested, in learning of 
his experience. 
II. In order that the pupil may grow in his ability to com- 
municate ideas, the teacher should (1) make sure he has clear 
ideas, (2) build up his vocabulary, (3) train him in keeping 
in mind longer and longer series of ideas, and (4) stimulate him 
to judge and improve the audience effects which he produces. 
Transition to Section II, on oral communication With 
these essential principles of training in communication derived 
from our historical approach, we shall now turn to a special sec- 
tion on oral communication, in which it will become clear why we 
have given so much emphasis in this section to oral practice. 
Section II. Practice In OraL CoMMUNICATION 
Social importance. Oral expression more frequently used 
by most persons.— Oral communication was given such a promi- 
nent place in the preceding section because it is socially much 
more frequent and important in the lives of most persons than 
their written expression. The most frequent occasions for oral 
communication will be listed below and briefly evaluated. 
Social occasions and values. 1. Conversations. Learning to be 
@ good conversationalist.—Ordinary conversations present the 
 
-P-A-G-E-424
408 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
most common opportunities for oral communication. Practically 
all persons, except infants, engage in them daily. To be skilled 
in conversation is very highly esteemed. Such skill depends 
upon abundance of ideas of general interest, a corresponding 
vocabulary, and easy use of these factors in oral communica- 
tion. The liberal contact with contemporary social life which 
a progressive elementary school now gives, and the conversa- 
tional lessons which prevail, when provided together, are most 
effective devices in training good conversationalists. 
2. Practical oral discussions ; explanatory, problematic, argu- 
mentative, persuasive.—Next to leisure conversation, practical 
discussions between two or more persons appear most frequently 
in oral communication. These may occur in the family, in 
business, and in the affairs of such organizations as clubs, 
churches, charitable institutions, etc. Telephone discussions of 
business are common examples. Committee meetings call for skill 
in practical oral discussion. The discussions may be of various 
types. Explanatory discussions occur frequently ; for example, 
a business executive is discussing with a subordinate plans which 
the former has in mind, The subordinate listens, asks questions, 
makes suggestions, and tries to get the matter clear through dis- 
cussion before leaving the office. Problematic discussions are 
another type and are well illustrated in committee meetings. 
Argumentative discussions—that is, rapid, informal give-and- 
take between disputants—occur on all kinds of practical oc- 
casions. Persuasive discussions are particularly important in the 
work of traveling salesmen, insurance solicitors, etc. In family 
affairs, love affairs, and other types of social relations skill in oral 
persuasion is a great asset. The problematic discussions which 
are provided in problem-solving lessons are especially helpful 
in developing this socially valuable skill in oral discussion. 
3. Dictating business letters.—It is a significant fact for the 
schools that most of the “writing” of business letters is now a 
matter of oral expression by the person who composes the letter. 
Nearly all business correspondence is dictated. Such dictation
-P-A-G-E-425
  PRACTICE IN COMMUNICATING IDEAS = 409 
calls for a very different form of skill from what is required in 
actually writing letters. My own experience was very striking. 
Some years ago I was placed in an executive office where I had, 
for the first time, to dictate letters. I had been a very fluent 
writer of personal letters for years and had written even a five- 
hundred-page book without much trouble. Yet it was over two 
years before I developed sufficient skill in dictating long busi- 
ness letters to do so without elaborate outlines or memoranda. 
My previous training had not fitted me to keep such an outline 
of main and subordinate points clearly in mind while talking. 
Thus we see that practice in keeping in mind a series of ideas 
to be expressed orally (which we emphasized in Section I) is 
especially needed in training for one of the most common 
forms of oral expression in modern life; namely, dictating 
business letters. 
4. Short talks.—Occasionally persons are called upon to give 
short talks. Sometimes these are impromptu, as in certain re- 
ligious services or in meetings of deliberative bodies where the 
speaker secures the floor for a few minutes. Often the talks are 
prepared in advance, either in outline form or carefully written 
out. The art of the short talk calls for special study. The failure 
of many banquet and college-chapel speakers to realize the 
artistic limits of the short talk gives evidence of the need for 
occasional training in school in this occasional form of oral 
communication. 
Social frequency of such occasions for oral communication 
justifies special emphasis.—These four types of oral expression 
—namely, leisure conversations, practical discussions, dictated 
business letters, and short talks—include the most common 
examples of oral communication in social life. The first three 
are so frequent as to justify very extensive practice in similar 
oral expression in school. They are so much more common than 
written communication in the lives of most persons as to justify 
us in giving comparatively little training in written as compared 
with oral communication.
-P-A-G-E-426
  410 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
Child’s easy use of oral language justifies emphasis —Further 
justification for placing special stress upon training in oral com- 
munication in the elementary school is found in the difficulties 
that young children have with handwriting. Not until the 
higher grades are reached do children have sufficient control of 
handwriting to enable them to express their thoughts fluently 
and easily in writing. On the other hand, from the first days in 
the kindergarten, pupils can be given practice in oral expression 
without any such hindrance as we encounter in written expres- 
sion. Thus we find additional reasons, from the maturing of 
pupils’ abilities, to supplement the social reasons for empha- 
sizing oral communication which we presented in the preced- 
ing paragraphs. 
Sample lessons in oral communication. The kinds of ac- 
tivities in a progressive elementary school which give practice 
in oral communication are so numerous and varied that we have 
not space to introduce the reader to all of them. The best we can 
do is to indicate a few types and examples, as follows: 
1. Discussion lessons especially valuable.—As indicated 
before, the conversation or discussion lessons which prevail 
in history, geography, science, art, etc. are especially effective in 
giving pupils a wealth of ideas, as well as the necessary vocabu- 
lary and practice in expressing them. For sample lessons of 
this type see pages 279-306. 
2. Contribution recitations require longer sequences.—The 
‘contribution recitation usually gives the expresser practice in 
keeping in mind a longer series of ideas to be expressed than 
is the case in conversation lessons. For a sample contribution 
talk by a pupil see the talk on steamships printed later in this 
chapter (p. 443). 
3. Telling after silent reading; active vocabulary.—Telling 
portions of a story or other assignment after silent reading of it 
gives excellent practice in oral expression. In the second-grade 
reading lesson on page 122 we noticed how the pupils, after 
silent reading of the story, told with ease and accuracy about
-P-A-G-E-427
  
PRACTICE IN COMMUNICATING IDEAS) 411 
the crocodile’s plan to catch the monkey. It is remarkable how 
rapidly a child’s active speaking vocabulary improves through 
such practice. He quickly learns to use the nicer descriptive 
terms and turns of expression which occur in the books, but 
which the ordinary converse of the street and home does not 
make a part of his vocabulary. The exercises in silent reading 
in the higher grades, which we described in Chapter XI and 
which call for reproduction of portions of the matter read, also 
enlarge the pupil’s vocabulary and habituate him to expressing 
himself in clearly formulated points. The difference between 
such oral reproduction and mere oral reading is tremendous 
from the standpoint of training in oral expression. In oral read- 
ing the reader merely speaks words which he sees printed on the 
page. He does not have to hold a series of ideas in mind or 
find words to express them. But in the oral reproduction of 
selected points he must recall the points in order and recollect 
appropriate words to express them. This is real training in oral 
expression. Unfortunately it frequently lacks a real audience 
situation, but its value in increasing the pupil’s vocabulary is 
so great as to justify its frequent use. 
4. Special expression periods.— Finally we may note a few 
of the devices used during the special periods set apart in the 
programs for training in oral communication. We shall begin 
with the kindergarten. 
a, Kindergarten. Telling of toys.—A favorite device used 
for the special conversation periods in a kindergarten is to have 
a child bring from home some favorite toy, show it to the class, 
and say a few words about it. Naturally some of the five-year- 
olds are so timid they can say nothing. A somewhat less timid 
child might hold up her doll and say, “‘This is my doll.” A still 
less timid child might say : “This is my doll. Her name is Mary.” 
A little natural-born talker whom I know would probably say: 
“This is my doll. Her name is Mary. Santa Claus brought her. 
I found her under the Christmas tree. Mamma said, ‘What are 
you going to call your new dolly?’ I said—” and so on until
-P-A-G-E-428
  412. TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
the teacher has to resort to some artful device to put a stop 
to the child’s endless flow of ideas and words. 
Coéperative descriptions of activities —Another favorite kin- 
dergarten device is for the pupils to codperate in building up a 
story of something they have done. Here is a sample from The 
University of Chicago Elementary School : 
OUR VISIT TO THE BIRD STORE 
We went to the bird store to buy some goldfish. 
We saw canary birds. 
They said, “Cheep, cheep, cheep.” 
We saw some rabbits. 
We saw a stuffed squirrel on a part of a branch. 
We saw a stuffed parrot on the trunk of a tree. 
We saw some empty cages and some little cages. 
We bought four fish and some seaweed and some fish food. 
The children composed the sentences in this story ; the teacher 
wrote them down; then the children practiced telling them. 
Thus the pupils secure elementary practice in organizing a simple 
series of ideas and keeping them in mind while telling them. 
They also gain in confidence through the concert recitations with 
others and through the individual telling of a single line or of 
the whole story. Numerous natural occasions for the repetition 
arise out of the class activities with the story. For example, they 
may make little books containing the story and pretend to 
read them. 
b. First grade. Learning, telling, and dramatizing a story. — 
The types of training described for the kindergarten continue 
into the first grade, but for variety of illustration we shall present 
here the plans of a teacher for training first-grade pupils in 
relating the story of “The Three Billy Goats Gruff.” The large 
amount of repetition which occurs in these lessons might seem 
tiresome to one unfamiliar with the tastes of first-grade children. 
The delight which they take in repetition I saw illustrated in 
the case of my little nephew and niece, who possessed a phono-

graph record of “The Three Billy Goats Gruff.” Day after day, 
time and again, they placed the record on the machine and 
listened with undiminished delight to the adventures and con- 
versations of the troll and the three goats. An account of the 
method of teaching children to tell and dramatize this story is 
given below. It was written by Miss Mattie L. Hatcher and 
is reprinted with her permission. 
TEACHING “THE THREE BILLY GOATS GRUFF” TO A FIRST 
GRADE. By MATTIE L. HATCHER 
First Lesson 
Teacher’s aim: So to tell the story thatthe children’s attention 
will be gripped, their imagination quickened, and their interest 
sustained to the end. 
Method. ‘““How many of you have ever seen a billy goat? ... 
How many of you have one at home? ... What can yours do? 
[Free expression.] Do you think he is very bright? .. . I know 
a story about three billy goats, who were very interesting. Should 
you like to hear the story? Listen while I tell it. [Teacher tells the 
story wjth dramatic effect and without comment.] What do you 
think of these goats? [Free expression.] See if you can tell the 
story to your mothers when you go home.” 
Seconp Lesson 
Teacher’s aim: To clear up obscure points in the minds of the 
children and to assist them in getting a more definite idea of the story. 
Method: ‘You remember the story we had the other day about 
the three billy goats. What were these billy goats named? .. . 
Where did they go? . . . Who tried to keep them from going? ... 
Some of you have seen billy goats, but some of you have not. I am 
sorry that I cannot show you a live one. I haven’t any, but here are 
some pictures of billy goats. [Teacher shows several pictures. | 
Should you like to hear the story again? I shall tell it if you help 
me.” [Teacher tells the story, assisted by children. ] 
Teacher. Once upon a time there were— 
Children. Three billy goats [etc.]

414. TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
T. Under the bridge there lived— 
C. A great troll. 
T. What is a bridge? . . . Where is there one near here? .. . 
This is the picture of a bridge—another picture. I am sure you 
never saw a troll—they do not live now. We can only think how 
they looked. This troll had eyes— 
C. As large as saucers. 
T. And a nose— 
C. As long as your arm. 
T. Shut your eyes and think of a troll that looked like that. Think 
of him as under the bridge. I am sure we should be afraid to cross 
that bridge, but these little goats were not afraid. Help me to tell 
what Little Gruff did; Middle Gruff [and so on until the entire story 
has been retold by teacher and children]. 
Tuirp LEsson 
Teacher’s aim: To induce the children to think through the story, 
putting incidents in their chronological order. 
Method: “We know the story of the three billy goats so well that 
today we shall try to tell it and not leave out anything. How does 
the story begin? [Once upon a time there were three billy goats.] 
Where were the billy goats? . . . Where did they want to go?... 
What was the trouble they were likely to have in getting there? . . . 
Which billy goat went first? . . . Tell what the troll said to him, 
and what he said to the troll... . Tell about the next billy goat. 
. . . What comes next in the story? . .. Tell about it... . What 
are the billy goats doing when the story ends? ... ” 
FourtH LEsson 
Teacher’s aim: To lead the children to dramatize the story. 
Method: “We shall play one of our little stories today. Which 
one do you want? [This story will be selected at some time. The 
teacher can afford to let it wait until the children want to play it.] 
I am sure that we know the story of the Billy Goats Gruff well 
enough to play it today. What must we have? [Children will prob- 
ably name the three billy goats and the troll.] We shall need some- 
thing else besides animals. [Children will probably mention bridge, 
hill, and lowland.] Where shall we have the hill? . . . What can we

have for the bridge? . . . Where shall be the plain where the billy 
goats were first eating? [Children arrange details. Actors may be 
selected (1) by the teacher, (2) by a leader, or (3) they may be 
volunteers. Several sets of children may play the parts before the 
period ends.] Remember where the goats are at first, where they are 
to go, and exactly what they are to say. Take places” etc. 
FirtH Lesson 
Teacher’s aim: To lead the children to tell the story with atten- 
tion to order of events, in good language, and with vivid interest. 
Method: “1 wonder if we can tell the story of the Billy Goats 
Gruff today. Tell of the three goats, what they were doing, and what 
they thought they would like to do, John.” 
“Tell of the trouble they were likely to have in getting to the 
mountain and what Little Gruff did, Mary.” 
“Tell what Middle Gruff did, Edward.” 
“Tell what Big Gruff did, and how the story ends, Anna.” 
“Tell the whole story, Edith.” 
SixtH LEsson 
Teacher’s aim: To allow the class to give free expression to the 
story. 
Method: ‘What story do you want today? ... Shall we tell 
it or play it?” [Children volunteer to tell or play it. Children 
arrange all details etc.] 
SUGGESTIONS 
1. Tell some stories to the children without expecting any re- 
sponse from them other than the light upon their faces. 
2. Often let the children volunteer to tell stories. 
3. Often let them select the stories to tell or to be told. 
4. Let the story-teller face the audience and try to interest them. 
5. The audience should be free to clap or to show approval in 
any way if the story is pleasing to them. 
6. The audience should be encouraged to ask questions at the 
close of the story. 
7. The teacher in her favorable comment may take occasion to 
call attention to something which she is emphasizing with the class ; 
for example: “We enjoyed Ben’s story. He spoke so clearly.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-432
  416 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
8. The teacher should draw the class as closely around her as 
possible. 
9. A good story will stand many repetitions. 
zo. An uninteresting story should not be repeated. 
11. Never forget that literature should give joy. (2: 525-528) 
c. Composing plays and assembly exercises.—A favorite de- 
vice for giving practice in oral discussion and composition is to 
have pupils compose a play from some story which has appeared 
in their history or other reading. For example, here is the 
foreword to a play entitled “ David and Goliath,” composed by 
the second grade in The University of Chicago Elementary 
School and printed by the upper-grade children in the school’s 
print shop. 
FOREWORD 
The story of David and Goliath was told to the second grade in 
connection with the study of shepherd life. It was then dramatized, 
the children at first working out the scenes and using their own words 
to express the thought. Later the words were taken directly from 
the Bible. 
The children planned the costumes and made their own shields, 
swords, spears, and helmets. From pictures and descriptions they 
were able to weave David’s sling. 
Third grade. Aisop’s stories dramatized.—On the opposite 
page is reproduced a play written by the third and printed by 
the seventh grade. The foreword reads thus: 
FOREWORD 
These short plays were written and illustrated for the pupils of 
the second grade by their friends in the third grade. They are favor- 
ite fables from A‘sop, made into dramas easy and short enough to 
be played as they are read. The pictures are to help in showing the 
players what to do and how to do it. 
Other plays composed : “‘ Horatius,” “ Robin Hood,” “Rip Van 
Winkle.” —Other examples of classes composing plays from lit- 
erary or historical materials are the following: A fourth-grade

418 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
class dramatized portions of Macaulay’s “Horatius.” They 
devised a number of tableaux representing crucial points in 
the story. Before the curtain arose for each tableau, a child 
appeared and recited the appropriate lines from the poem. The 
devising of the tableaux, the selecting of the portions of the poem 
to be used, and the choosing of the actors called for much oral 
discussion. The presentation of the whole before the school 
assembly helped to develop confidence before a large audience. 
Other simple plays were devised by a sixth grade from Howard 
Pyle’s “Robin Hood” and from the story of Rip Van Winkle. 
In case the original story contains much conversation, it is easy 
for the pupils to compose the dialogue. Frequently, however, 
they must invent the dialogue as a substitute for narrative or 
descriptive matter in the text. This calls for much discussion 
and experimentation with different forms of expression. 
Sample class discussion during preparation of assembly exer- 
cise.—In order to give the beginning teacher some notion of the 
method of thus training pupils in practical discussion through 
the planning of a play or of some exercise to be presented to the 
school assembly, there is printed below a partial stenographic 
report of the discussion held by a fourth-grade class in the 
Francis W. Parker School of Chicago while preparing an as- 
sembly exercise on the poet and artist William Blake. After 
the class had discussed the desirability of preparing the exercise, 
the conversation continued as follows: 
Robert G. If it is just going to be Blake’s poems, I think we 
should tell something about him. 
Teacher. How many like that idea? (Many hands are raised.) 
What things shall we tell about him? 
(Teacher writes topics on the board as they are suggested.) 
1 Child. Where he was born. 
2 Child. What he was interested in. 
3 Child. His visions. 
T. What visions ? 
1 Child. When he saw the child in the cloud.

3 Child. Fairy’s funeral. 
4 Child. The men he saw go to the altar—the Apostles. 
Miriam. One time he was sitting on the seashore and saw the 
kings and all the pages and the people going along the shore. 
Karl. And once when his father died he thought he saw his soul 
go up to heaven. 
Mary. How he came to write his poems and how he learned to 
engrave. 
Charles. You would not call it sculpture if he engraved things. 
T. Who will set Charles right ? 
Charles. A sculptor makes statues from marble, and an engraver 
carves great stones. 
T. No. 
Alexander. They have copper plates, and with a sharp tool do what 
they want to on this, and then fill the lines with ink and press it down 
on paper or whatever they are going to put it on. 
T. What other points do we want about Blake? 
Child. How he used to go to Westminster Abbey and draw 
statues. 
T. Should you like to have someone who knows about his draw- 
ings tell about them at the exercise? You don’t know his drawings. 
They are strange and weird. I have seen some of them, and maybe 
someone has seen a whole book of them. 
All. Yes. 
T. I will try to find someone who knows about them. 
Child. Should we not tell about the wife who did not know any- 
thing, and he taught her, and then she helped him with all his things ; 
and the name of his first book, “Songs of Innocence,” and why he 
named it that ? 
T. And about the long walks that he and his wife took together ? 
(No more points are suggested.) 
T. What poems do you know of Blake? 
Children. “Laughing Song”; introduction to “Songs of Inno- 
cence”; “Night”; “The Lamb”; “The Tiger”; “The Shepherd.” 
Child. Can’t we sing ‘““The Shepherd” at the beginning of the 
exercise ? 
T. What grade can sing it ? 
All. We can.

420 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
Further planning and discussion followed, and certain children 
volunteered to prepare to talk upon the various topics outlined 
on the board. The next day the lesson proceeded as follows: 
[On the board is the list of points planned the day before, with 
names of children volunteering to talk on each topic. ] 
Teacher. Yesterday we began to plan our morning exercise about 
Blake. Without my saying anything, let the children come in the 
order in which their names appear on the board. And remember that 
you must connect with one another, so the story will be complete. 
René. This is going to be a morning exercise about William Blake. 
I am going to tell you when he was born and when he died. William 
Blake was born in London in 1757 and died in 1827. 
Mary. When Blake was a little boy he loved to draw and used 
to illustrate his own poems. He went to Westminster Abbey and 
drew different things around there. He drew all his life, and did most 
of his drawing before he was married, but after he was married he 
kept it up and illustrated the rest of his poems. 
Frederick. Blake’s wife did not know how to read and write, so 
he taught her, and it was hard for him because he did not know very 
well either. He loved to live out of doors, and they took long walks 
and sometimes went thirty miles. They would stop at an inn, and 
then go back to their home at night. 
Frances. When Blake was a little boy he never went to school, but 
learned by himself. When he was twenty-five years old he married 
Catherine Boucher. Though she was very talented she could neither 
read nor write, but he taught her. 
Henry. William Blake was a very good man, and some things were 
very queer about him. I think these are true. He had quite a num- 
ber of visions. Once he was at the seashore and thought he saw a 
lot of kings and queens marching along the sand. Another time, when 
his brother was very ill and died, he thought he saw his soul clapping 
his hands and going up to heaven. When he was a little boy and 
was going through a field, he thought he saw a tree full of angels, 
and he thought the reason he could make poetry was because his 
brother’s soul used to come down and tell him what to write. 
After four other children had spoken, a critical discussion of 
their performances began with the following conversation: 
 
-P-A-G-E-437
PRACTICE IN COMMUNICATING IDEAS = 421 
Teacher. What do you think? Does that do what you want done 
for the story? I am not asking you to choose the people who seem 
to you to do it best, but whether you think it is right for the story 
of Blake’s life. Or are there things left out, or is it not pleasant the 
way it is planned? 
Child. I don’t like the way some of them said he saw his brother’s 
soul clapping his hands. 
T. But that is what Blake said. 
Robert G. I think someone ought to tell about his engraving. 
Mary. I thought you only wanted the drawing. I can change it. 
T. It is not true, Mary, that he did most of his drawing before 
he was married. He went on all his life. All the famous book 
drawings he made later in life. And, Fred, you gave me the impres- 
sion that Blake did not know very much. 
Frederick. Well, he did not go to school, did he? 
T. No; but he studied and was an educated man. 
Frances. He said he got his education from reading. He read all 
the time. 
T. What do you think about what René had to say, John? 
[René had been the first to speak.] 
John, I don’t think it was quite enough. 
Child. I think he ought to tell more dates—when he started 
engraving and some things. 
T. How many were interested in what René said? (A few hands 
are raised.) How many were not? (Many hands are raised.) Why 
was it that what he said was not interesting? (1) 
This critical discussion, with further planning, continued on 
the second day until satisfactory schemes were devised. On the 
third and fourth days the aspiring performers were further 
tried out in the classroom. Finally, the children who were chosen 
to present the exercise to the morning assembly of the school 
rehearsed once in the assembly hall. 
Simple dramatizings develop skill in discussion and audience 
presence ; oratoricals avoided.—This account should impress 
the reader with the fact that in our discussion of the organiza- 
tion of dramatic activities we are not especially interested in 
making dramatic actors of the children. Our chief interest cen-
-P-A-G-E-438
422, TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
ters in the training in practical oral discussion which is illus- 
trated in the above reproduction of the actual words of teacher 
and pupils. To be sure, the pupils who act or speak in the per- 
formance are securing valuable practice in talking to audiences. 
The skill which they develop in this line is quite remarkable if 
they have occasional opportunities from the kindergarten to the 
end of the elementary school. At the end of such training many 
of the children are thoroughly self-possessed in appearing before 
an audience of two hundred children and adults. They speak in 
an informal, natural, conversational manner that is in pleasing 
contrast with the declamatory efforts characteristic of the old- 
fashioned elocutionary training in memorizing classical orations. 
Such happy naturalness results from the whole course of training, 
beginning with such simple little plays as “The Crow and the 
Pitcher” (which we reproduced on page 417), and ending 
with such an elaborate historical dramatization as the reproduc- 
tion in miniature, by seventh-grade children, of all the impor- 
tant debates concerning slavery, as these occurred in American 
national assemblies, from those of the Revolutionary period 
down to the Civil War. 
d. Current-events club trains in parliamentary discussion of 
topics of the day.—Another valuable special device for train- 
ing pupils in oral discussion is the organization of a current- 
events club. My son was in such a club in the sixth grade. 
The English teacher initiated the organization and set apart 
one period a week for its discussions. The class elected a 
chairman and secretary for short periods. The first secretary 
had seen parliamentary bodies in the motion pictures, but never 
in real life. When told that he had to keep the minutes, he asked 
for the gavel. When the teacher asked what he wanted it for, he 
said, ‘Why, to pound out the minutes.” He thought “keeping 
the minutes” meant to time each speaker, pound at the end of 
each minute, and make a record of the time consumed. Needless 
to say, all the class acquired much clearer notions of parliamen- 
tary procedure before the club had completed many sessions.
-P-A-G-E-439
    
PRACTICE IN COMMUNICATING IDEAS = 423 
The topics for discussion by the club were suggested by the 
children themselves. They included the following: ‘“Street-car 
fares in Chicago,” “President Wilson,” ‘Distinguished foreign 
visitors,” “Other prominent people,” “The steel strike,” “The 
high cost of living,” etc. Each pupil had to bring for each 
meeting one or more newspaper clippings about his topic, with 
a brief unified paragraph written by him about a single phase of 
it. In the meeting he had to speak on his topic when the chair- 
man called on him. When my son had his turn as chairman he 
was in great glee, because he could call on himself when he 
was well prepared, and did not have to fear a surprise attack. 
However, the club had a rule that upon a motion properly 
seconded and voted, the chairman would have to report. Free 
discussion, including questions and arguments, could follow each 
topic. Occasionally these discussions lasted fifteen minutes and 
became quite as tangled as those of the American Senate. 
Conclusion of discussion of devices for oral practice.—The 
examples which we have given above will probably suffice to give 
the reader some notion of the great variety of methods used in 
progressive schools to give pupils vital, continuous, daily train- 
ing in practical oral communication. As indicated above, for this 
purpose we esteem most highly the regular daily lessons in 
history, geography, science, etc., which are conducted by the 
discussion and contribution methods. Silent reading that is 
followed by oral reproduction of selected points also contributes 
daily to build up the pupil’s vocabulary and his ability to hold 
a series of ideas in mind and express them clearly. In addition to 
these activities in various subjects, we have described special 
devices used during the period specifically devoted to training 
in oral expression. These include telling about toys which the 
pupils have brought in the kindergarten, codperative descrip- 
tions of class activities in the primary grades, repetitional story- 
telling in the first grade, the discussion and composing of plays 
and assembly exercises in all grades, a current-events club in 
the upper grades, etc.
-P-A-G-E-440
424 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
Resulting effectiveness of pupil’s oral communication.— 
Where such constant training is provided in a progressive ele- 
mentary school, the resulting ease, versatility, and effectiveness 
attained in oral communication are always noted by visitors who 
are familiar only with the old-fashioned or conservative elemen- 
tary school, in which little free discussion by pupils occurred but 
in which stilted written composition prevailed. In the next sec- 
tion of the chapter we shall treat briefly of written expression, 
which, owing to its less frequent use by most persons and the 
difficulty of training young children in it, deserves much less 
emphasis than does oral expression in elementary schools. 
Section III. Practice In WRITTEN CoMMUNICATION 
Social need. Restricted with most people to letter-writing. 
—The writing of personal and business letters (unless these 
are dictated) is practically the only form of written com- 
munication that will be used frequently by most elementary 
pupils after they leave school. However, such writing is so 
common and offers such large opportunities for improvement 
that we are justified in giving pupils considerable practice 
in the art. 
Letter-writing. Cleverly organized in progressive text- 
books.—The more recent improved textbooks in composition 
have given much space to helpful exercises for training pupils in 
letter-writing. For example, in one text’ that I have at hand, 
the first lesson on letter-writing opens with an anecdote of a 
little girl, Lily, who wrote a letter to the great author Dickens, 
whom she knew very well, asking him to come and read a story 
to her. The author’s letter in reply is printed in the text. After 
some discussion of this interesting incident and model letter, 
each pupil writes a letter to the teacher, asking that school be 
dismissed so that the children can attend the circus.

(Ginn and Company, 1917.)
-P-A-G-E-441
    
PRACTICE IN COMMUNICATING IDEAS = 425 
Self-active comparison of pupil letters with model letter — 
This exercise is followed by two pages of discussion in which 
each child is asked to compare in detail his letter with that of 
Dickens. This discussion opens as follows: 
17. LETTER-WRITING 
Oral exercise. Refer to the letter in the preceding section. Where 
did Dickens live when he wrote to Lily, and when did he write? 
Examine the letter which you wrote to your teacher. Does it name 
the city and state in which you live? Does it tell the date of your 
writing? It should give the reader all this information. Besides, it is 
well for your letter to tell on what street you live and the number of 
your house. 
This part of a letter, which tells where the letter was written and 
when, is called the heading. 
Refer to the letter in the preceding section to see just where and 
how the heading should be written. 
After considerable further discussion of this type, each pupil 
is asked to write an answer to his request that school be dis- 
missed for the circus. The text says: “As if you were the 
teacher, explain in your answer why it seems best not to dismiss 
school. Or shall you grant the request, so that the children may 
all go to the circus?” 
Group exercises suggested in teacher’s manual.—At this point 
in the book the teacher is referred to the following suggestions 
in the teachers’ manual that accompanies the text : 
It may be that a group exercise in letter-writing, reviewing the 
matter contained in section 17, will prove profitable at this point. 
Throughout the book, group exercises should be used continually for 
review purposes. Vital reviews [consisting of group discussions or 
group corrections of compositions recently written] are much to be 
preferred to formal reviews of rules and definitions unrelated to the 
pupils’ speaking and writing. 
Letters about fairy-tale writer follow oral preparation.—The 
next lesson in the text is based on a two-page account of the life  
-P-A-G-E-442
  
426 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
of Hans Christian Andersen, the writer of popular fairy stories. 
This is made the basis of an oral exercise in which the following 
directions are given: 
Oral exercise. Tell the story of the life of Hans Christian Ander- 
sen as he might have told it to you and your classmates if you had 
all visited him in his home near Copenhagen. Or, if you have read 
some of his famous fairy tales, tell the one you like best. 
Then comes another exercise in letter-writing. This is based 
on the Andersen material and grows naturally out of the pre- 
paratory oral exercise. 
Continued-story letters of imaginary children.—These initial 
lessons on letter-writing cover about five pages of the text and 
are followed by a series of lessons distributed at intervals through- - 
out the book. This series concerns the correspondence between 
an imaginary girl and boy who live in California and a girl and 
boy who live in Michigan. The first lesson of this series begins 
as follows : 
33. LETTER-WRITING 
Oral exercise. Elizabeth is at her desk, trying to write a letter to 
her friend Harriet in California. But, although she is fond of Harriet 
and wants to send her a pleasant letter, she says she can think of 
nothing to say. Give her some suggestions. Possibly the difference in 
the climate between California and Elizabeth’s home would make a 
good starting-point. Then she could tell of games she had been play- 
ing, of books she had been reading, of something interesting that has 
recently happened in the neighborhood. What other subjects could 
she write about in her letter? Make the brightest suggestion you can. 
Written exercise. Write Elizabeth’s letter for her, addressing the 
envelope when you have finished. 
Features of a good textbook on letter-writing.—These quota- 
tions illustrate the clever organization of practice exercises in 
letter-writing as found in one textbook for the intermediate 
grades. Equally ingenious devices can be found in some of the 
other recent improved texts. In general, these devices have the 
following characteristics :
-P-A-G-E-443
PRACTICE IN COMMUNICATING IDEAS 427 
1. The text is addressed to the pupil in just such simple lan- 
guage as a skilled teacher would use in the classroom. 
2. The discussion centers in interesting content such as a trip 
to the circus, or a little girl writing to a great author, or popular 
fairy tales and their author, or imaginary children whose books 
and games and travels and adventures in breaking through the 
ice, etc. savor of the real matters of child life. 
3. This content is made the subject of practice in oral dis- 
cussion preliminary to letter-writing. : 
4. The greatest difficulty of untrained letter-writers—namely, 
“knowing what to say””—is alleviated considerably by this oral 
preparation and by other means of suggesting phases of the topic 
which the pupils might treat. 
5. Individuality and freedom of choice are encouraged in 
capable writers by inviting varied treatments and_ bright 
suggestions. 
6. The formal rules of letter-writing are introduced by ques- 
tions which stimulate the pupil to discover the conventional 
practices by examining samples printed in the book. 
7. The pupil is made clearly aware of the place of these con- 
ventions in his own writing by means of questions which stim- 
ulate him to examine his own productions carefully and compare 
them with good models. 
8. Group discussions and group corrections of pupils’ let- 
ters, which are written on the board or read to the class, serve to 
bring out, emphasize, and review the general principles of letter- 
writing. 
Four phases of practice in letter-writing.—If we now turn 
to a more systematic discussion of practice in letter-writing, we 
may, for convenience, distinguish four phases of the training; 
namely, training in (1) the use of conventional forms of ad- 
dress, (2) correct capitalization and punctuation, (3) the correct 
formation of sentences, and (4) securing interesting content and 
an effective style. We shall take up each of these for brief 
comment.
-P-A-G-E-444
  428 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
1. Conventional forms of address.—In order to give prac- 
tice in the first of these phases of the art of letter-writing, it is 
probably best to follow rather closely the directions given in a 
good elementary textbook in composition or in the syllabus 
especially issued by the local schools for training in letter- 
writing. The conventional forms are so well standardized as to 
need little discussion here. The main points in teaching are 
(1) to arouse the pupil’s interest in correct address; (2) to 
give him clear ideas of the conventional forms; and (3) to give 
much practice in which attentive repetition prevails so as to 
make the pupil’s use of the conventional forms automatic. 
With such teaching, most of the pupils will be perfected in these 
simple formalities by the time they leave the eighth grade. 
2. Correct capitalization and punctuation.—In teaching 
correct capitalization and punctuation the same general prin- 
ciples apply as are given in the preceding paragraph, on teach- 
ing the correct forms of address. 
3. Correct formation of sentences.—The third phase of 
training in letter-writing—learning to form sentences correctly 
—is much more complex than the first two phases. We may 
introduce the problem of developing skill in this phase by a 
quotation from the Boston bulletin entitled “Determining the 
Achievements of Pupils in Letter-Writing.” The discussion of 
developing the pupil’s “sentence sense” reads as follows: 
SPECIAL STUDY OF SENTENCE SENSE 
Much has been said and written about the need of developing in 
the children “sentence sense,” and, indeed, the need is vital. A sen- 
tence, no matter what may be its length and complexity, must contain 
a subject and a predicate and must not be grammatically dependent 
on any words outside itself. If a child has gained the ability to dis- 
tinguish both in his mind and on paper a sentence as a unit of 
thought, then he has gone a long way toward enabling his reader to 
grasp and follow the thoughts which he wishes to communicate.
-P-A-G-E-445
PRACTICE IN COMMUNICATING IDEAS = 429 
There are two principal types of violation of “sentence sense” : 
(I) the incomplete sentence and (II) the failure to make a new 
sentence for a new thought. 
Under (I), the incomplete sentence, we may distinguish the follow- 
ing types: 
1. Subject omitted : 
a. Hope you are well. 
b. The pieces you spoke were very interesting and am glad to know 
you did well. 
c. And as for the pains in your side are only growing pains. 
2. Whole or part of verb omitted : 
a. I suppose the piece that was entitled “The Death of Pyramus.” 
b. Your letter received. 
c. I am feeling very well and also the family. 
d. I hope you will be well after this and no more pains. 
3. No subject or predicate : 
a. Noun phrase used as sentence : 
(1) Just a few lines to answer your letter. 
(2) Best regards to all from all. 
(3) That pain also (following the sentence “I hope your nose 
is better’). 
b. Subordinate clause standing, alone : 
(1) Because I want to see you. 
(2) Which I am certain are not better than yours. 
(These are really parts of foregoing sentences.) 
c. Participial phrase used as sentence (chiefly at end of letter) : 
Hoping to see you Saturday (wrong, even if followed by 
comma, unless also followed by J am or I remain). 
d. Prepositional phrases standing as sentences : 
(1) With loves 
(2) In reply to your letter which I received yesterday. 
Under (II), the failure to make a new sentence for a new thought, 
attention is called to the following groups: 
1Jt is recognized that this use of an incomplete sentence is not to be 
judged so harshly as the other examples noted. But while it is true that 
cultured people sometimes allow themselves the privilege of using this 
construction at the end of a friendly letter, nevertheless it should be 
discouraged in letter-writing in school in order that the children may not 
extend its use to other types of written work.
-P-A-G-E-446
  
430 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
1. Independent clauses joined as one at the end of the letter. 
a. Give my love to everybody, I am. 
b. Write soon, I am. 
2. Independent clauses, not related in thought, joined without con- 
nective : 
a. I am glad to say you have been honored good and I hope you 
also feel that way too, I hope your nose will not be bleeding 
as much as it did before, because sometimes I have them, 
but mostly I have them in the summer. 
b. I hope you will come home soon and help with the garden the 
baby is well and all the family but mother. 
c. I hope you will not have any nosebleeds also I am sorry your 
side has pained. 
This classification is admittedly incomplete. As can be seen, only 
the major violations of sentence structure are included here. All 
the examples are taken from pupils’ letters. (15: 25-27) 
Frequency of error and possibilities of improvement shown. 
—The extent to which such errors in sentence structure existed 
among Boston school children was ascertained from a series of 
tests. The conclusions of the Boston authorities are stated in 
the following quotation: 
These figures show that gross violations of sentence structure exist 
to an alarming extent in the pupils’ writing. In other words, about 
one in three of the pupils in Grades VIII and VII (36 per cent and 
38.2 per cent respectively) and about every other pupil in Grade VI 
(46.5 per cent) made one or more of the kinds of error in sentence 
structure listed above. This certainly would indicate a need for work 
in developing “sentence sense.” It is only fair to add that these pupils 
were by no means evenly distributed among classes, for while there 
were as many as 61 per cent of one class who had errors of this kind, 
there were as few as 19 per cent of another class in the same district 
who had errors in sentence structure, showing that some teachers have 
been more successful in attacking the problem than others. It seems 
to indicate, too, that a large part of the error is unnecessary. (15: 28) 
Follow a good text and adapt Herbartian formal steps.—It is 
probably advisable in teaching this phase of letter-writing to fol- 
low one of the best recent texts in which the lessons are based
-P-A-G-E-447
PRACTICE IN COMMUNICATING IDEAS 431 
upon scientific investigations of pupils’ errors (such as the Bos- 
ton study) and are carefully graded and systematically arranged. 
In introducing pupils to each correct form and giving them prac- 
tice in using it, some adaptation of the Herbartian formal steps 
is probably desirable—similar, perhaps, to the procedure which 
we described on pages 155-156, in the case of arithmetic. 
4. Securing effective content and style.—The fourth phase 
of the art of letter-writing—securing interesting content and an 
effective style—is far more difficult to develop in many pupils 
than the other three phases which we have discussed; namely, 
(1) correct address, (2) correct capitalization and punctuation, 
and (3) correct sentence structure. Since these three involve 
primarily a limited number of formal rules and formal habits, 
they present a somewhat definite, limited task for the teacher. 
On the other hand, in training pupils to write effective letters 
from the standpoint of content and style, the teacher is confronted 
with a much larger task, which includes the whole problem of 
building up the pupil’s ideas of social life and developing his 
skill in clear-cut thinking and in organizing ideas. For such 
training the natural opportunities for letter-writing in school 
offer comparatively meager possibilities, while the opportunities 
for written expression in community life, history, literature, 
geography, and science offer manifold possibilities. For this rea- 
son we shall turn our attention to the training in written com- 
munication which may be provided in these content subjects. 
Written communication in the content subjects. Examples. 
—Some of the possibilities of training in written communication, 
or expression, in these content subjects may be illustrated by a 
few examples. 
In science. Notebook entries chosen by vote.—Our first ex- 
ample is from the science work of a fourth-grade class that was 
studying the habits of fur-bearing animals. Each child prepared 
a manila-paper notebook in which he pasted a large colored pic- 
ture of each animal on a left-hand page and, on the opposite 
page, gave a few brief paragraphs about the animal’s characteris-  
-P-A-G-E-448
432 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
tics and habits. These paragraphs were chosen by vote of the 
class from brief compositions which werewritten by all the pupils 
at the conclusion of the study of each animal. For example, the 
following paragraphs were chosen for the permanent record con- 
cerning the raccoon and the beaver : 
THE RACCOON 
The covering of the raccoon is a brown and white mixture which 
gives his whole appearance a sandy color. He is about the size of a 
medium-sized cat, but he looks larger on account of his long hairs. 
His face has a black mark. He has about seven black rings on his tail. 
The raccoon’s tail am ring-around, 
The possum’s tail am bare, 
The poor ole rabbit has no tail, 
But jest a bunch of hair. 
The raccoon lives in a hollow tree. He prefers the oak or sycamore. 
His food is: fresh shell fish, frogs, birds, poultry, eggs, fruits and 
vegetables. 
One of his habits is to walk on tiptoe. Another is to wash his food 
before eating it. Another is to sleep in the day and hunt in the night. 
One of the raccoon’s ways of protection is to jump into the water if 
water is handy. Another is to climb a tree, and yet another is to 
climb up a tree and jump down on the other side so the dogs will lose 
the scent. In the north the raccoon hibernates in the winter— Dan 
THE BEAVER 
It is interesting to know what beavers eat. The beavers are very 
fond of water plants and the bark of trees. They carry the twigs to 
their house and eat the bark. Then they take the rest of the stick 
down to the dam to help mend it. The beavers store their food in the 
channel of the stream near the dam. When winter comes, the beaver 
can get his food whenever he wants it. Don’t you admire the beaver? 
JOSEPHINE 
In geography. Accounts of activities in making sand-pan 
map.—To illustrate the use of written communication in geog- 
raphy, we print two short compositions written by fifth-grade
-P-A-G-E-449
PRACTICE IN COMMUNICATING IDEAS = 433 
pupils whose class had just finished making in the sand-pan a 
surface-and-products map of the United States. In order to illus- 
trate rather fully the spontaneous expressional abilities of fifth- 
grade children, the compositions are presented in their original 
form (prior to correction for misspellings and punctuation). 
Later we shall comment on the contrast between such rela- 
tively rough drafts and the revised drafts. The sample com- 
positions follow: 
5B. GEOGRAPHY 
Kenneth U.E.S. 
MINING 
We made a soil map of the United States. I was on the mining 
committee and I put some iron in the Lake Superior region, in Sout 
Carolina and Pennsylvania. I also put some gold in colorado and 
California. I put some coal in Pennsylvania, Indiana, North and 
South Carolina, New York and Nebraska. I put some copper in the 
Kewahnee peninsula. I put some zink in Missouri also. 
5B. GEOGRAPHY 
Warren University Elementary School 
Our Sor Map 
We have been studying the United States in Geography and our 
teacher suggested that we make a soil map of the United States. 
We had the janitors put the soil in a pan which we had made seven 
by five feet, and we started to model the map. We all helped to model 
it. When we got the shape the best we could we put clay in little 
strips around the shape so that the water when put in the oceans 
would not swamp the soil. We had a lot of trouble with Maine and 
the Great Lakes. Miss Storm did not help us but told us whether the 
shape was good or not. She told us the Great Lakes were not good. 
We tried again and again until we got the shape to suit us. Then we

Mississippi River so we put in clay. But we found it better not to 
have it so we put in silver paper. 
History. Accounts of constructions and of Roman mythol- 
ogy.—As examples of practice in written communication by 
pupils who are studying history, we give two compositions by 
fourth-grade children who were studying the history of Rome. 
The first one, as in the case of the geography compositions, is 
based on some construction work, while the second is derived 
from reading Roman mythology.

THe CAPITOL 
Another important temple we built in our sand pan was the Capitol. 
After Tarquinius Priscus’s enemies had been subdued he set to work 
to improve the city and in honor of Jupiter, Minerva and Juno he 
built a splendid temple called the Capitol. While the workmen were 
working on it they had to remove a few altars that had already been 
put in but Tarquinius would not let them move the altar of the god 
of youth because he said, if they did they would not keep young and 
strong any more and also he would not let them move the altar of the 
God of Boundaries because he said, their boundaries would keep going 
backwards if they did, so the two altars were left standing. When the 
temple was finished it was the most beautiful temple Rome had ever 
had. It burnt down three times but was always rebuilt again. One of 
these times when it was rebuilt it was so pretty that I will have to 
describe it to you. The gates were of brass covered with gold while 
the inside was of marble and was decorated with gold and silver 
ornaments. It was situated on the south west side of the Capitoline 
hill and covered eight acres of ground. The children that modeled 
the Capitol in the 4 A grade are Payson Wild, Helen Farwell, Roger 
White and Harry Harkins.

4A. HISTORY 
THE Founpinc oF RoME 
Long ago there was a King of a town called Alba Longa, but his 
brother who was a wicked man and wanted to be king himself took 
him off the throne, and locked his daughter up in prison where twin 
sons were born to her. When her uncle heard this he became jealous 
and ordered them to be drowned in the river, Tiber. At that time the 
river Tiber was overflowing and the servant was afraid to go near so 
he left them in shallow water and they drifted down the river where 
they caught in some vines on the south side of the river. After awhile 
the twin babies began to cry and a mother wolf who had lost her cubs 
came and nursed them. But as time wore a shepherd who had seen 
the wolf going and coming, soon found the boys and named them 
Romulus and Remus. It wasn’t long before they heard how their 
father had been taken off the throne. So one day they set out to put 
their father back on the throne. But the people of Alba Longa could 
not live inside its walls so Romulus and Remus made a city on the 
Palatine hill. But the people did not know what to call the city, so 
one day Romulus stood on one hill and Remus on another hill, after 
awhile Remus saw six vultures and Romulus saw twelve vultures and 
the city was called Rome after Romulus. 
Content subjects provide abundant content and audience 
situations.—These examples illustrate a few of the numerous 
and varied opportunities for practice in written communication 
in the content subjects. Among the advantages of such oppor- 
tunities for written practice are these: (1) the pupils are readily 
provided with “something to write about” from the vast stores 
of information which these subjects provide; (2) natural au- 
dience situations may easily be created by having individual 
pupils or groups of pupils investigate, discuss, and interpret 
special topics that are of general interest to the class, but con- 
cerning which many pupils are not informed. 
How to balance spontaneity and good form.—In introduc- 
ing the compositions from geography we noted the fact that 
mistakes in spelling and punctuation still remained in the sam- 
ples, This fact raises the question of securing a proper balance,  
-P-A-G-E-452
  
436 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
in pupils’ writing, between (1) spontaneity of expression and 
(2) good form. Teachers of English are divided into two 
rival camps in debating this balance. One camp insists on 
“accuracy first” and usually succeeds in killing spontaneity and 
interest; the other camp believes strongly in “vital content and 
spontaneous expression” and is likely to neglect accuracy. 
Both rough drafts and corrected drafts to be inspected and 
encouraged. —Probably the proper balancing of spontaneous ex- 
pression and grammatical accuracy is best secured by distinguish- 
ing between (1) the rough first drafts which are common in 
actual authorship and (2) the revised and corrected drafts which 
the author prepares later. The proper balancing of these is well 
suggested by Charters in the following statement: 
Teachers complain of two things. One group of teachers says that 
the composition work of children is very slovenly. [Other] teachers 
say that children, when they pay too much attention to writing, 
spelling, grammar, and so forth, become stilted and stiff in what 
they write or talk about. 
In dealing with both these criticisms a double standard will solve 
many problems, for a teacher should allow two standards in written 
work. I find that most people who write anything important need to 
make at least a first draft and a final draft. Sometimes one has to 
make two or three drafts in between the first and last. The first draft 
is usually very rough. ... It is not the kind of work that one 
would wish to be judged by. The final draft .. . looks very dif- 
ferent. It is worked out with due consideration for form. 
Now the first criticism—that pupils’ work is slovenly—is due to 
the failure of the teacher to require a final draft, legible and readable 
in form. The teacher accepts the first draft and complains of slovenli- 
ness instead of requiring a readable draft. The second criticism—that 
pupils are stilted and formal—arises from the failure of teachers to 
allow the pupils time for making a first draft, or to show them how 
to do the preliminary work. Then, of course, when the pupils have to 
write very legibly, and when they have to stop to make corrections, 
all the time fearing that they may make some mistake, they will write 
as stiltedly as a young man talks when he visits very precise people in 
unusual surroundings and fears with every word he says that he will 
 
-P-A-G-E-453
  
  PRACTICE IN COMMUNICATING IDEAS = 437 
make some bad mistake. If the teacher would permit and show the 
pupils the use of the two drafts, allowing natural work in the first and 
requiring careful work in the second, the content would be sponta- 
neous and the form careful and readable. (8: 46-47) 
Outlining is an important stage in rough-drafting.—One of 
the most important stages that frequently appears in rough- 
drafting is outlining. In actual authorship this often does not 
go beyond merely jotting down topics in a certain order, with 
subtopics indented under main topics. Frequently much shift- 
ing, crossing out, and inserting of topics will be made upon the 
same draft, which, consequently, may not appear very neat but 
may represent a maximum of careful thought. Such thoughtful 
organizing and reorganizing frequently involve all the activities 
in problem-solving described in Chapter X and, in fact, offer 
some of the best opportunities for training pupils in reflective 
thinking. Hence the teacher should encourage pupils to exhibit 
to her their rough outlines as objective evidence of the organizing 
and reorganizing that they are thinking out. Frequently, in 
order not to lose the heat of spontaneous expression, the fuller 
writing may be done from such rough-draft outlines in which 
mere indention is the only device used to indicate subordination 
of topics. Sometimes, in order further to clarify the thoughts 
before beginning solid writing, a scheme of numbering the main 
topics and subtopics may be imposed on the rough-draft outline 
after the latter is written. At other times, if the pupil-author 
has had considerable time (minutes or hours or days or weeks) 
to organize his material mentally before beginning to write, his 
first rough-draft written outline may be clearly numbered, as he 
proceeds to write it, by using some such scheme as 
Il. 
 
-P-A-G-E-454
  438 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
In such cases extensive experimental outlining has often taken 
place in the pupil-author’s mind before the jotting down of his 
topics on paper. If he is going to “publish” his outline (for 
example, by writing it on the blackboard), he may need to polish 
it; but if he is using it merely as a helpful, tangible, mechanical 
guide in a process of thoughtful, somewhat fluent statement, 
such polishing may impede effective expression. 
Distinguish outlining in communication from outlining in 
silent reading.—In view of the preceding discussion of rough- 
drafting in outlining, we should distinguish between the use of 
outlining as an aid in expression and outlining as an aid in silent 
reading. In the latter case the outline is intended sometimes to 
force the pupil to grasp the main points and sometimes to aid 
him to grasp these points through the graphic objectification of 
another author’s organization that has already been settled or 
congealed in print. On the other hand, when the pupil is him- 
self the author in the act of composing, his outline may be merely 
a transient stage in a process of thought that is still somewhat 
fluid and subject to rapid modification. 
Oral communication a further aid to writing.— Finally, we 
may note that oral communication is, like rough-drafting, also 
an important aid to written communication. For example, I find 
that my own writing proceeds much more easily and fluently 
when I have had opportunities to lecture from rough-draft out- 
lines upon a topic before undertaking the written discussion of 
it. In recent years composition teachers have emphasized such 
preliminary oral discussion in connection with much of the writ- 
ten composition in elementary schools and high schools. We 
have already noted one clear-cut example of this practice in the 
“oral exercises” which preceded the letter-writing exercises in 
the textbook described on pages 425-426. 
Oral discussion a central factor in several types of learning. 
—Hence we find additional reasons for esteeming the practice 
in oral discussion which we have already emphasized in several 
connections. Thus in our chapter on problem-solving we showed
-P-A-G-E-455
  PRACTICE IN COMMUNICATING IDEAS 439 
(on page 277) that important social problems are frequently 
solved through oral discussions, and (on pages 279-304) we 
gave examples of pupils’ securing training in such problem 
discussions. Again, in the section of this chapter devoted to 
oral communication (pages 407-409) we showed the social im- 
portance of practical oral discussions and the need of the 
pupil's acquiring skill in this art. Finally, in the present con- 
nection we see how progressive composition teachers frequently 
organize preliminary oral discussions of topics in order to aid 
pupils in organizing and formulating their material for exercises 
in the written communication of ideas. In the next section of 
the chapter we shall turn our attention to an example of skillful 
teaching in which we find the most intimate interrelating of oral 
and written communication in the study and discussion of an 
important topic from social life. The manner in which this new 
section is related to the preceding sections may be observed 
by reviewing the titles of the latter; namely, I. History and 
Principles of Teaching Composition: from Written to Oral; 
II. Practice in Oral Communication; III. Practice in Written

Twelve weeks on “Ships and Shipbuilding.’””—In this sec- 
tion of the chapter we desire to give the reader a concrete idea of 
one of the most effective methods of skillfully organizing prac- 
tice in oral and written communication. We shall do this by 
presenting a detailed description of the activities of a sixth-grade 
class in English which spent twelve weeks in the study of the 
topic “Ships and Shipbuilding.” During this period many varied 
forms of practice in oral and written communication were pro- 
vided with the rich content—historical, scientific, biographical, . 
and literary—that this topic afforded. The teaching was con-

ducted by Miss Edith Parker,’ in 1914, in The University of 
Chicago Elementary School. The account given below is a re- 
print of an article by her in the Elementary School Journal for 
October, 1914. It is one of the best descriptions of skillfully 
organized teaching that I have ever read. 
A SIXTH-GRADE ENGLISH UNIT: SHIPS AND SHIPBUILDING 
BY EDITH PUTNAM PARKER 
Choice of topic.—Search for a topic which would be of genuine 
interest to eleven-year-old and twelve-year-old boys and girls, and 
which would, moreover, open to them a broader view of some of 
today’s work in the world, led to the selection of the subject “Ships 
and Shipbuilding.” The purpose of this article is to sketch the de- 
velopment of the topic as worked out with a group of sixth-grade 
children. 
Beginning with children’s experiences.—The children’s own experi- 
ences with boats or ships of any kind were utilized to introduce the 
topic. These stories were told orally to the class. The variety of ex- 
periences was surprising, and interest increased steadily as the stories 
multiplied. Use of the suspense element in interesting others and 
clever selection of titles were two of the several good points dis- 
covered by the children in the following account : 
A New Kuinp or Sarrpoat 
When my father was a little boy, he always spent the winter in New 
Orleans and the summer in Kentucky. One autumn when the family 
were going up the Mississippi River, a very funny thing happened. 
Father was on the top-deck looking up the river when, all of a sudden, 
he heard a scream from the nurse who was standing near him. A few 
minutes before, she had been holding a chubby baby in her arms. Now 
she was empty-handed. She stood there screaming and pointing to the 
water. There was the baby floating along the river. The baby’s dress 
had a very long, full skirt, and a strong gust of wind had carried the 
baby from the nurse’s arms to the water. There the skirt, being full of 
air, helped the child to float gently along until it was rescued. The 
baby had enjoyed the ride, and was none the worse for its wetting.

may state that Miss Parker is not related to the author of this book. Some 
of her cleverly conducted geography lessons are described on pages 238 ff.

  PRACTICE IN COMMUNICATING IDEAS 441 
Started scrapbooks.—In these reports mention had been made of 
boats and ships as widely different as tugs, colliers, yachts, schooners, 
ocean liners, warships, and canoes. Distinctions were discussed orally, 
and many of the children started scrapbooks containing pictures of 
as many as possible of the kinds discussed. Though the subject of 
shipbuilding had at no time been mentioned to the children, pictures 
of ships in construction soon began to appear in these scrapbooks— 
particularly in those of the boys. “Building a Three-Decker”; “The 
Ridavavia, nearing Completion at Quincy, Massachusetts”; ‘The 
Latest Work in Shipbuilding: the White Star Line’s New Britannic”; 
and “Turbines being hoisted on Board the Aguitania, now building 
at Clydebank,” were titles of some of the illustrations secured. 
Letters to steamship companies.—To all the class, excepting two 
boys particularly interested in hydroplanes and hydroaéroplanes, the 
great ocean liners seemed more attractive than any other vessels. This 
preference directed the course of procedure and led the class to write 
letters to the best-known ocean-steamship lines for further informa- 
tion. Each child chose the company to which he or she wished to 
write. Many asked permission to write to several. The substance of 
all the letters was much alike. Answers were awaited with much 
interest. [The following is an example of a pupil’s letter :]

Will you please answer for me the following questions concerning your 
steamships? What are the names of your largest boats? How large are 
they? Where and how are they built? What are your principal sailing 
routes? I shall be grateful for any pamphlets about them or pictures of 
them which you can send me. 
Yours truly,

Ark and “Argo” Stories.—While awaiting the replies to these let- 
ters, the class read the stories of the two famous prehistoric boats, the 
Ark and the Argo. The Biblical version of the Ark story was read, 
talked over, and re-read. Additional motivation for expressive read- 
ing of the passage lay in the knowledge that one child was to be 
chosen by the others to read the story in the morning exercise on 
ships that the class had been asked to give before other classes.
-P-A-G-E-458
442, TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
Retelling and illustrating —After the reading of the story, opportu- 
nity was given for two modes of self-expression. First, the written 
story of the Ark was reproduced in the children’s own language. Then 
a crayon drawing of the Ark, as the child conceived it, was made. 
Owing to individual differences the amount of Biblical diction which 
was carried over into the children’s accounts varied widely. The 
two copied below were chosen to illustrate this particular point. 
Noan’s Ark 
The Lord requested Noah to build an Ark, so that when the flood came, 
he could preserve himself, his family, and the various animals. It was 
built of gopher wood, which we now call conifer cypress. The Ark was 
five hundred twenty-five feet long, eighty-four feet wide, and fifty-two 
feet high. It was not built for travel, and merely floated about until the 
flood subsided. 
Noan’s Ark 
Many, many years ago, not long after the time of Adam and Eve, the 
Lord saw that there was nothing but evil in the mind of man whom he 
had created. So God determined to send a flood and wash the face of the 
earth bare from man. In this dreadful time, there was but one patriarch 
who won favor in the sight of the Lord. This was Noah. He only had 
not forsaken the Lord, . . . 
In the working-out of the crayon drawings in the art period, ques- 
tions such as those of proportion, of coloring, of placing of door 
and window, of showing three stories, and of the general shape of 
the boat presented individual problems to be met. The decision 
‘was unanimous and very amusing that no steering gear was neces- 
sary, because Noah desired only to float. The finished drawings 
were most interesting. 
The Argo story was similarly treated. The sources used for this tale 
were Lowell’s “Jason’s Quest” and Baldwin’s “Golden Fleece.” 
Since only one copy of each was available, each child read in turn to 
the rest of the class. English periods did not come often enough to 
satisfy their desire for the completion of this story, and the class 
voluntarily held after-school sessions to hear it finished. The little 
accounts reproduced after just the one hearing were usually good. 
Some chose to write of the building, some of the launching, and 
some of the return of the famous craft. [The following example 
treats of the building :]
-P-A-G-E-459
PRACTICE IN COMMUNICATING IDEAS 443 
THE BUILDING OF THE ARGO 
Jason walked through the land crying, “ Who will build me a ship large 
enough for fifty men?” Men laughed at the idea of so huge a boat, but 
at last a man called Argus volunteered to try. One day as he was at work 
among the timbers on the beach, a beautiful woman came toward him. 
As she approached him she asked, “ What kind of a thing is this?” 
“T am trying to build a ship,” he answered humbly. 
She told him that so poor a craft could never sail the seas, and the next 
moment disappeared. But in her place there stood Athena, the goddess of 
wisdom. She showed him how to use strong cedars for his hull, and for 
the prow she bade him secure a bough from the talking oaks of Dodona. 
Before long, with such help, he completed a seaworthy vessel, wonderful 
to behold, and after its builder it was named the Argo. 
Telling about material from steamship companies—By the time 
the Argo stories were finished, a mass of material (truly alarming in 
quantity from the teacher’s standpoint) had been accumulated from 
the steamship companies. Several very large pictures had been sent, 
and pamphlets and small pictures of every description. More delight- 
ful to the children than anything else, however, were the personal let- 
ters which they received answering some of their many questions. 
Much clamoring to be first to tell about and show their treasures en- 
sued. The coveted permission was given to the one who showed the 
best simple outline of facts to be presented. A class hour was spent 
discussing the organization and selection of the material. When two 
or three children wanted to talk about ships of the same company, 
they decided among themselves upon the division of the subject to 
be made. For example, of the three who wrote to the Hamburg- 
American Line, one talked upon the /mperator, another upon the trip 
of the Cleveland around the world, and a third upon the Vaterland — 
at that time still in process of construction at the great shipyard 
of Blohm & Voss, Germany. Several of the children laboriously 
made extra diagrams and maps of routes to help them picture 
effectively the exceedingly great size and merit of their respective 
ships. A mere skeleton of one of these oral reports, taken down by 
a student assistant as the child talked, is included below. 
CUNARDERS 
This large picture is of the Lusitania. This ship is 700 feet long and has 
a tonnage of 32,000 tons. If you look down to the water from this deck, 
you are looking down a distance of 80 feet to the water. Here is a dia-

444. TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
gram I have made of the Auditorium Hotel. If the Lusitania were put 
down Michigan Avenue in front of the Auditorium, it would reach this far. 
If you put one of these funnels down on the street, two street cars could 
run through it at once on double tracks the usual distance apart. 
The Lusitania has a sister ship, the Mauretania. They are both fast ships 
and sail weekly between New York and Liverpool. The Lusitania was 
built on the Clyde, Scotland, and the Mauretania on the Tyne, England. 
The Cunard Company are now building the Aquitania and Transyl- 
vania. The Aquitania is already launched. The hull of the Transylvania 
is just being built. This picture shows the fourth funnel as it is being put 
into place on the Aquitania, These new boats will be the finest and largest 
on the line. The names of all the large Cunarders end with ania. 
Search for further steamship information.—Needless to say, all 
this information was divulged to the rest of the class with no small 
degree of pride on the part of the possessor. As reports multiplied, 
the children made it a point to learn the names and sailing-routes 
of the great liners not only of their own companies but of all the com- 
panies discussed. Then they began, also quite of their own accord, 
to bring in reports from the daily papers as to the whereabouts of 
the various ships that day. Atlases were consulted more eagerly than 
in the geography class. That the Cleveland had arrived in Bombay 
late the preceding night was a subject of before-school conversation. 
Perhaps the most interesting report made was upon the French 
Line. This told how all these liners could be converted into war ves- 
sels by the French government; . . . how they were built at the St. 
Nazaire yards, although they could be built much more cheaply in 
England ; and why these things were true. 
Reports on great ships of history— As soon as a child had given 
a report on his material a subject for later report was chosen. This 
was to be based upon reading done in the library. Unless special re- 
quest for a different kind of topic was made, the assigned reading 
was upon some of the great ships of history. All read and illustrated 
a chapter upon the evolution of a boat. Individual instruction was 
given in the use of a card catalogue in finding the books referred to. 
The “American Sailor,’ “The Boys’ Wonder Book of Ships,” and 
E. Keble Chatterton’s two volumes were found particularly adapted 
to children’s use. Some of the topics assigned were ‘The Norse Boat 
of Gokstad,” “The Golden Hind,” “The Bucentaur,” “The Great 
Harry,” “The Blessing of the Bay,” “The Clermont,” “The Great 
Western,” “The Constitution,” etc.

The subject of the Merrimac and the Monitor was written up by 
one lad upon his own request. 
Modern shipbuilding reported on.—The children, already not a 
little familiar from their various reports with the chief shipbuilding 
regions of the world and with the parts of a great ship, were now 
quite ready to study the chapter “Ships and Shipbuilding,” in Allen’s 
“Industrial Studies—Europe.” The personal touch—the picture 
of the shipbuilder as well as of shipbuilding—was supplied by the 
teacher’s stories of Peter the Great, Phineas Pett, Robert Fulton, 
and other great shipbuilders. Many shipbuilding articles from maga- 
zines were brought in by the class, the best of which was from the 
Scientific American of January 31, 1914. It was entitled “The 
Most Modern Shipbuilding Plant in the World.” Early in the dis- 
cussion of building ships of iron and of steel, the children were 
puzzled as to how an iron ship could float. The following is one 
boy’s volunteered effort to explain: ~ 
Wuy AN IRON or STEEL SHIP CAN FLOAT 
If you put a piece of wood on the water in a basin—like this—you see 
it floats. We found out in our study of primitive boats that logs floating 
down stream gave early suggestions of boats. Therefore people were 
not surprised when a boat built of wood floated. But if you put a lump 
of iron in the water in the basin—like this—you see it instantly sinks. 
So when people first heard of steel ships, they were sure they would 
sink. I am going to try to show you why they do not. When I put this 
little iron cup in the water, you see it floats. The secret is in its shape. 
You see this is not a solid piece of iron but a shell of iron filled with air. 
* The air and the iron together are light enough to be held up on top of 
the water just as the wood was. The cup sinks to within half an inch 
of the brim. Then we know that it is lighter than an amount of water 
just the size the cup would be. Steel ships are hollow like the cup. 
Longfellow read—The class next read together Longfellow’s 
“Building of the Ship” and liked it. Modern shipbuilding methods 
were often compared to those of the “master.” The parts of a ship 
named presented nothing strange. The thought content was easily 
mastered. 
Short reports on library work.—During the study of the poem, 
five or ten minutes each day were taken up with the reports based on 
“the library work. Some of these were oral and some written. The 
following one was written :

THE BUCENTAUR 
Venice is built on islands, with the sea upon all sides. For this reason, 
and because she had obtained most of her wealth by commerce, she grew 
to love the sea, Venice felt that the sea loved her, too, and would pro- 
tect her. From this idea there came to be held a beautiful ceremony 
called the Marriage of Venice and the Sea. 
Once every year the Doge, or chief ruler of Venice, accompanied by the 
priests and many attendants, sailed out into the harbor to perform the mar- 
riage service. It was the most important of all the holidays of the Venetians, 
and the harbor was gay with throngs of people and bright decorations. 
The Bucentaur, the boat in which the Doge sat, was a beautiful boat. 
It had two floors, or decks. Upon the low deck sat the men who rowed the 
boat. The upper deck was covered with velvet and adorned with much 
gold braid and many tassels. At the stern was a small window from which 
the Doge cast a ring into the sea, while the priest solemnly read the words 
of the service. 
For almost four centuries this beautiful ceremony was performed every 
year, and many different boats were made to be used for it. Always, how- 
ever, the boats were named the Bucentaur. 
Original poems.—As a final step the class wrote original poems 
about any phase of ships or shipbuilding that they chose. The results 
exceeded expectations, especially in the distinctly ethical content 
embodied in such an attempt as the following (for such a “moral” 
had never in any way been pointed out or mentioned in class). 
For us the steel is glowing, 
For us the ribs are bent, 
For us the hammers plying, 
For us are labors spent. 
The builder in his office, 
With master mind does plan, 
But every little labor counts, 
Down to the lowest man. 
Many rather long rimed stories of ships and wrecks and building 
were composed, but more pleasing than any of them was this little 
four-line production: 
If you were but a fairy, 
And could grant me wishes three, 
T’d choose to be an architect 
Of ships that sail the sea.

Kipling read.—Last of all came Kipling’s story of “The Ship that 
Found Herself.” The children, already familiar with his ‘‘oo7,” were 
rejoiced to know that he had written a ship story too. It was read 
to them by the teacher during the last two days of the twelve weeks’ 
period over which this unit of English work had extended. They 
seemed to enjoy every word of it. 
Training provided.—When the unit of work was over, the chil- 
dren realized only that they had found out some very interesting 
things about ships and shipbuilding, and that they wanted and in- 
tended to know more. The adult onlooker knew, however, that train- 
ing in oral composition, in writing stories (both reproduced and 
original), in oral reading, in the proper use of a library, in letter- 
writing, in spelling and dictionary work, and in outlining and organ- 
izing material had been given them, as well as a knowledge of some 
of the world’s mightiest carriers and a glimpse of one of her greatest 
industries. 
Other examples of expressional practice based on rich 
social topics.—The above account by Miss Parker needs no 
comment from me to impress the reader with the interest, vitality, 
effectiveness, and value of such intensive study of a rich social 
topic,in an English class, as the basis of various forms of practice 
in communication. The opening and closing paragraphs of Miss 
Parker’s article summarize very well these general features of 
the teaching. Another example of the same type of practice 
under a different teacher, but in the same school, centered in the 
topic “Life-saving.”’ The fact that a life-saving station on Lake 
Michigan was close to the school made it easy to provide con- 
crete experiences, which were supplemented by many others 
from literary sources. Another example of such intensive study 
of a social topic by English classes in another school centered in 
the study of the pioneer history of the local community. Pupils 
specialized in investigating and reporting upon various phases 
of the topic, and many sources of information were canvassed for 
material upon pioneer occupations, amusements, notable enter- 
prises, biographies of leading pioneer citizens, etc. The titles 
of typical report were “The Nationality of our Pioneers,” “A
-P-A-G-E-464

Chat with the Earliest Settler,” “The Spelling Bee,” “The Husk- 
ing Bee,” “Digging the Old Canal,” “Building the First Rail- 
road,” etc. Finally, for an extended account of the thorough 
use of social-science topics for composition purposes the reader 
should study reference ga at the end of this chapter. Such 
teaching, with its rich experiencing and varied practice in com- 
municating vital social content to real audiences, contrasts very 
strongly with the contentless formal language lessons that for- 
merly monopolized the English lessons in many schools. Yet in 
some schools frequent formal language lessons are still desirable 
and necessary in order to correct the wrong habits of speech 
that pupils form in uncultured homes and on the street. The 
task of conducting such formal language lessons has been greatly 
simplified in recent years through certain scientific studies of 
pupils’ language errors, which we shall discuss in the next sec- 
tion of the chapter. 
SecTION V. Correct GRAMMATICAL PRACTICE; 
ScIENTIFIC OUTLINES 
Scientific studies of pupils’ errors simplify grammar course. 
—In our discussion of sentence errors in letter-writing (on pages 
428-430) we have already given an excellent example of the ef- 
fort to ascertain pupils’ grammatical needs through a study of 
the errors that they actually make in their speech and writing. 
Another similar investigation, which is among the most reliable 
of many that have been conducted, was made by studying 1040 
pages of stenographic reports of the oral classroom language of 
children in the Speyer School in New York City. From such in- 
vestigations of the common grammatical errors of children, re- 
vised courses of study in grammar have been prepared which 
omit many topics that fattened the old-fashioned English gram- 
mars. These omitted topics are now known to be unnecessary 
for most children, because the latter do not make the errors in 
speech upon which the eliminated discussions were based. Thus
-P-A-G-E-465
PRACTICE IN COMMUNICATING IDEAS 449 
—just as in the case of handwriting, spelling, and arithmetic— 
scientific studies of social needs have greatly simplified the prob- 
lem of teaching English grammar. 
Emphasize devices for attentive repetition of correct forms. 
Grammar games.—Another great improvement that has recently 
become popular in the teaching of English grammar is to give 
pupils more practice exercises or drill in correct grammatical 
usage. This drill centers upon the forms in which the pupils 
need special corrective exercises. Such exercises are not only 
embodied in improved textbooks but are also described in man- 
uals for teachers, which contain many clever devices to secure 
attentive, interested repetition by pupils, since such attentive 
repetition is necessary to make the practice effective. Among 
these devices are grammar games. For example, in order to 
teach children to say “I saw” instead of “I seen,” one syllabus 
gives this game: 
The teacher has an “I saw” box. From this she draws all sorts 
of objects. These she holds up in rapid succession, then hides them, 
calling upon pupils to tell what they saw, thus : 
Teacher. What did you see, Fred? 
Fred [very likely]. I seen a top [or perhaps “I sawn a top”]. 
T. I saw a top. 
F. I saw a top. 
T. [taking out another object]. What did you see, Mary? 
Mary. I saw a ball [and so on]. 
Many other games, each devised to correct some special gram- 
matical error, are described in the teachers’ manuals. When 
such games are so conducted as to place a premium on correct 
responses, they help considerably in forming correct habits of 
speech. On the other hand, if the pupils become wildly inter- 
ested in the game to the neglect of correct grammatical re- 
sponses, little good results. An example of such wrong practice 
occurred in the case of a grammar game in which the pupils _ 
“fished” gleefully for slips of paper but shouted ungrammatical 
answers to the questions contained on the slips.

450 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
Practical grammatical rules aid some pupils to improve 
their language.—While such corrective grammatical practice 
provides the most effective grammatical training for most pupils, 
discussions of the related rules will help some pupils who are 
interested enough and competent enough to think intelligently 
about the improvement of their language. For this reason a 
limited amount of practical grammatical information is retained 
in the improved grammars. For example, related to the practice 
with “I saw” (which is described above) is the practical in- 
formation about verbs in the various tenses. 
Sample lesson illustrating how to teach tense.—In familiariz- 
ing pupils with any one of these general grammatical topics, a 
common practice used by skilled teachers is to follow the Her- 
bartian five formal steps which we discussed on pages 155-156. 
An excellent example of teaching that illustrates this practice is 
contained in the following quotation from Thorndike’s “ Princi- 
ples of Teaching.” The topic of the lesson is ‘“Tense— Present, 
Past, and Future.” The same type of teaching, in which fairly 
full discourse addressed to the pupils appears, is found in the 
more improved textbooks. The lesson proceeds as follows: 
Review.—Pick out the verbs in these sentences : 
The boat now goes at eight o’clock, but next year it will make two trips, 
one at six, and one at nine. This arrangement was made by the company 
at their last meeting. The residents had hoped for many months tbat 
better means of communication with the city would soon be established. 
oe ne Why do you call “goes,” “will make, 
and “would be established” verbs? 
Aim.—A verb may tell more than what somebody or something 
does or is. Today we will find out one of the other things that a 
verb tells. 
New examples compared.—Look at the verbs in the sentences be- 
low and see what the difference is between those in the first column 
and those in the second : was made,” “had hoped,” 
The boat went yesterday. The boat will go next year. 
She sang that song Sunday. She will sing it again tomorrow. 
They were sick last week. They will be sick for a few days longer.
-P-A-G-E-467
  
PRACTICE IN COMMUNICATING IDEAS = 451 
Abstracting ideas of time——Which of these verbs tell that some- 
thing was in the past? Which verbs tell that something will be in 
the future ? 
Write two sentences about the action of a man going to New York. 
In the first sentence tell about the man’s going to New York in the 
past; in the second tell about the man’s going to New York in 
the future. 
Look at these sentences : 
The train is going sixty miles an hour now. 
Hear how loud that bird sings. 
They are sick. 
What other time is there besides the past and the future ? 
Practice in using ideas of time ——Tell in the case of each of these 
sentences whether the verb expresses a past action or a present 
action or a future action : 
He will knock at your door at four o’clock. 
He knocked at my door yesterday. 
They write during this period. 
He wrote a letter in the evening. 
The wheels go around very fast. 
They went around faster the other day. 
Abstracting variations in form.—What is the difference between 
the form of the verb “knock” when it expresses or denotes future 
action and its form when it expresses or denotes past action? What 
is the difference in the form of the verb “write” when it denotes 
past action? What word is used to tell about a person going in the 
past? to tell about a person going now ? 
Summary.—Verbs tell not only the kind of action or event but 
also the time when it takes place. When the action or event is 
represented in the past, the form of the verb is different from 
what it is when the action or event is represented in the present or 
in the future. 
Definition.—A difference in the form of a verb to denote time is 
called tense. 
A verb that denotes present action is in the present tense. 
A verb that denotes past action is in the past tense. 
A verb that denotes future action is in the future tense,

Practice in using —Write under each verb in the sentences below 
what tense it is in (as is done in the first line). 
It is hotter this summer than it was last summer. It will be cold (present) (past) 
enough in the winter. The sun will rise later and set earlier. Evening 
came so soon last November that the lights were being lit in the house 
when I reached home from school. We do not light them now until 
after seven. You can see that it is quite light now, though the bells are 
ringing seven. 
Did they send up my trunk from the station? No. They would not 
promise that it should be sent without a check. If you will send them 
the check it will be sent. I shall be passing the office this evening, any- 
. way. Won’t it be open? It used to be open evenings. 
Write two sentences each with a verb in the present tense. 
Write two sentences each with a verb in the past tense. 
Write two sentences each with a verb in the future tense. (6:

Lessons provide (1) clear-cut example, (2) attentive scrutiny, 
and (3) varied practice.—lIt is obvious that this lesson follows. 
in general the Herbartian steps which we described on pages 
155-156 of our arithmetic chapter; namely, (1) preparing the 
pupil for the new topic; (2) presenting examples; (3) compar- 
ing examples; (4) defining their general characteristics; and 
(5) giving practice in using the general rules with new examples. 
To summarize in three rules the fundamental characteristics of 
such skilled teaching of the abstract ideas and rules of grammar, 
we may repeat here the statement that the most essential fea- 
tures of this Herbartian procedure are as follows: 
1. Experiencing clear-cut examples. Give the pupils personal 
experiences with clear-cut, varied, typical examples of the gram- 
matical form, principle, or rule. 
2. Attentive scrutiny. Raise questions which stimulate the 
pupils to scrutinize attentively these examples so as to note 
the general characteristics of the latter. 
3. Varied applications. Give varied exercises that will train 
the pupils in recognizing the grammatical form or in applying 
the grammatical rule in new situations,

Section VI. MEAsuRING THE RESULTS OF PRACTICE 
IN CoMPOSITION 
Examples of scales.—Considerable progress has been made 
in devising tests and scales for measuring pupils’ attainments 
and progress in punctuation, grammatical accuracy, and general 
quality in written composition. We shall give three examples to 
illustrate this fact. 
Punctuation scale.—An example of a punctuation scale is the 
one prepared by Daniel Starch. It reads in part as follows: 
PUNCTUATION SCALE A 
Punctuate the following sentences : RowwvyH Peon H ROH Step 6 
. We visited New York the largest city in America 
. Everything being ready the guard blew his horn 
. There were blue green and red flags 
. If you come bring my book 
Step 7 
. I told him but he would not listen 
. Concerning the election there is one fact of much importance 
. The guests having departed we closed the door 
. The train moved swiftly but Turner arrived too late 
Step 8 
. Last year I studied grammar history and geography 
. Next we went to Vienna the capital of Austria 
. But alas this was not the case 
. Ever since Betty has loved the flag 
The sentences continue to increase in difficulty of punctuation 
up to Step 16. A pupil is given a score corresponding to his suc- 
cess in punctuating correctly the successive steps in the scale. 
Blanks are furnished for recording the pupils’ scores. Standard
-P-A-G-E-470
  454 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
scores that high-school classes and the higher grades in the 
elementary schools should attain are also provided. 
Diagnostic language tests.—Tests of the attainments of pupils 
in grammatical accuracy may be illustrated by the Charters 
diagnostic language tests. These consist of a series of sentences, 
some grammatically correct and some incorrect. The pupils are 
asked to mark with a cross those that are correct and to rewrite 
correctly those that are incorrect. Here are a few samples of the 
miscellaneous sentences: 
1. The boy got well. 
2. I don’t like that there color. 
3. I left it go. 
Samples from the test on verbs are as follows: 
1. I saw him. 
2. They set there yesterday. 
3. The boys have ran away. 
Similar sentences are especially organized for testing pupils” 
use of pronouns. 
Composition scales.—Scales for measuring pupils’ attainments 
in written composition were first scientifically organized about 
1912 by E. L. Thorndike and M. B. Hillegas. Their scheme may 
be illustrated by a modified scale especially devised by M.H. Will- 
ing and described in the English Journal for March, 1918. Pupils 
who are to be tested with this scale are asked to write a com- 
position on some exciting experience and are given a suggested 
list of ten topics, such as “A Storm,” “An Accident,” “An Er- 
rand at Night,” etc. After the compositions are written they are 
graded for general quality by comparing them with eight sample 
compositions which range from very poor to excellent, as illus- 
trated in the following samples. The score of each sample 
composition is indicated by the number printed above it. Only 
the. opening sentences of the compositions for steps 40, 70, 
and go of the scale are given here, but sample 20 is given 
completely.

456 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
Directions accompany the scale for scoring the pupils’ com- 
positions for both general quality and grammatical errors. Stand- 
ard scores showing what averages should be attained in each 
grade are also provided. 
Variety of scales.—The three examples of tests and scales 
for measuring language habits which we have given serve to 
illustrate the types of measurements that are being used. There 
are many additional forms on the market, and the teacher who 
is interested in such measurements should write for catalogues 
to the firms named before reference 18 on page 463. 
Must not overlook skill in oral communication.—While 
these measurements of written compositions are important in 
estimating a pupil’s skill in communicating ideas, we should not 
forget our analysis of the common occasions for oral communica- 
tion in social life; namely, in leisure conversations, in practical 
discussions, in the dictation of business letters, and in short 
talks. The abundant need of giving practice in these most fre- 
quent forms of communication is often overlooked by teachers 
and supervisors, who become absorbed in drilling pupils upon the 
formalities of written composition. We should remember that 
an efficient commercial school can take intelligent pupils and 
perfect them in the formalities of correct letter-writing in a very 
short time, but that it takes years of enrichment of a pupil’s ex- 
perience and vocabulary and much practice in real audience 
situations to make him a good conversationalist about the world’s 
affairs, an efficient participant in explanatory, problematic, ar- 
gumentative, and persuasive discussions, a skilled dictator of 
effective business letters, and a master of the art of making short 
speeches. Therefore we need tests and scales for measuring such 
oral skills also, since it is along such lines that the progressive 
elementary school, with its enriched curriculum for giving insight 
into social life and with its varied audience situations for giving 
daily practice in informal oral discussion, is especially success- 
ful in giving pupils skill in some of these types of oral communi- 
cation that are so common in the daily life of educated persons.

Section VII. LEARNING TO COMMUNICATE IDEAS 
THROUGH DRAWINGS 
Social needs for description and information through 
drawing.—This final section of our chapter is concerned with 
the problem of training the pupils in drawing as a means of

communicating ideas. If we had time for a thorough discussion 
of this method of expressing ideas, we should approach the sub- 
ject by an analysis of the social needs for ‘drawing in the lives of 
ordinary pupils and adults. This has been done by Professor 
W. G. Whitford in a series of articles entitled “Curriculum-  
-P-A-G-E-474
458 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
Building in Art.” In his discussions of the social uses of draw- 
ing he distinguishes three types: (1) “artistic drawing,” which 
aims primarily at artistic effect; (2) descriptive, or informa- 
tional, drawing; and (3) instrumental drawing, such as the 
mechanical drafting of plans for buildings, machine construc- 
tion, etc. As examples of artistic drawing and descriptive, or 
informational, drawing, Whitford gives the pictures shown on 
page 457. From the standpoint of our chapter on training ele- 
mentary pupils to communicate ideas, it is obvious that we are 
concerned primarily with the second type; namely, descriptive, 
or informational, drawing. The opportunities for using this 
form of drawing in daily life need to be canvassed by the same 
objective, mathematically precise methods as were used in as- 
certaining the spelling words and arithmetical problems of 
everyday life (as described on pages 53-54 and 146-147). 
How pupils learn to draw.—Having ascertained the social 
needs for descriptive and informational drawing as a means of 
communicating ideas, our next problem is to find out how pupils 
learn to draw. Several investigations along this line were sum- 
marized by Professor F. C. Ayer in 1919 (as described in ref- 
erence 20 at the end of this chapter). As typical of his 
conclusions, we may quote the following: 
Story-telling interest dominant in early drawing.—The narrative, 
or story-telling, interest is the predominant motive underlying the 
child’s use of drawing as a method of expression. 
The various biographical studies of children’s drawings give direct 
evidence concerning the earlier stages of drawing. Statistical studies 
of school children and classroom experiments show that few children 
take an interest in the representative value of drawing in the first 
grade and that there is a distinct loss in emphasizing detailed appear- 
ance during this year. Insistence upon correctness of details causes 
children at this age to stop using drawing as a spontaneous means 
of expression. The same line of evidence indicates that if not sup- 
pressed by criticism, the narrative tendency persists and may be used 
from the second grade on as a strong incentive to learn visual 
representation. (20: 105)

PRACTICE IN COMMUNICATING IDEAS 459 
Principles of teaching drawing for communication of ideas. 
Building up a pupil’s “graphic vocabulary.”—One of the most 
useful practical accounts of the progress of pupils’ abilities in 
drawing is a book by Professor Walter Sargent and Miss Eliza- 
beth Miller, entitled “How Children Learn to Draw.” In this 
account the story-telling interest is illustrated by numerous 
examples of pupils’ drawings. In general, there is a close

SKETCH VIKING SHIPS 
parallel between the principles of teaching informational draw- 
ing as laid down by these authors and the principles which we 
emphasized in the earlier sections of this chapter. One of these 
principles—namely, the systematic increase of the pupil’s vo- 
cabulary—is especially emphasized in terms of building up a 
pupil’s “graphic vocabulary.” For example, the pupil’s drawing 
vocabulary is enriched in the kindergarten by ability to represent 
a green plant in a red flowerpot by using colored crayon. In the 
first grade he may add the ability to diagram a farmyard; in the 
second grade, to sketch an Indian wigwam ; in the third grade, to 
sketch a green and brown palm tree on a yellow and purple 
desert bounded by the horizon line. And so he progresses,

gradually enriching and refining his graphic vocabulary until, 
when he leaves the elementary school, he has learned to draw 
so many common objects that he can sketch roughly for descrip- 
tive, or informational, purposes any situation which he desires 
to depict to his associates. (For further details concerning the

Conclusion of chapter on communicating ideas.—In closing 
this chapter it is well to recall the fundamental principles of 
training in communicating ideas which we emphasized in the first 
section; namely, to create real audience situations for the pupils 
and to see that each pupil in his efforts to express himself gains 
clear ideas of his topic, an enlarged vocabulary, increased skill 
in keeping in mind longer and longer series of ideas, and ability 
to judge whether he is making his message interesting, clear, and

impressive to his audience. Most of the other points presented in 
the chapter are merely discussions of the value of such training 
or of detailed devices for giving the necessary practice and for 
measuring the pupils’ attainments. However, since skilled teach- 
ing consists frequently in the use of effective devices, the latter

should be highly esteemed and imitated wherever they can be 
effectively used, whether this be in the simple codperative 
kindergarten discussions of a trip to the bird store or in the 
elaborate twelve weeks’ investigation and discussion of ‘Ships 
and Shipbuilding” in the sixth grade. 
Conclusion of Part II on “four thoughtful processes.”— 
This chapter concludes our discussion of the “four thoughtful 
processes” included in Part IT of the text. As indicated in the 
introduction to this part, these four processes include, first, 
acquiring the ideas and attitudes that give sympathetic insight 
into contemporary civilization, and, second, acquiring certain
-P-A-G-E-478
  462 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
intellectual skills; namely, skill in problem-solving, in silent 
reading, and in communicating ideas. We have seen how inter- 
related these four thoughtful processes are in the progressive 
elementary school ; how the rich social content furnishes abun- 
dant opportunities for problem-solving, silent reading, and com- 
municating ideas ; and how these three latter processes serve to 
enrich, clarify, and organize the learner’s ideas of social life. 
Many elementary-school pupils who have had the good fortune 
to experience skilled teaching along all these lines are well started 
in the direction of a liberal education and in the mastery of the 
fundamental tools of intellectual life; namely, skill in problem- 
solving, in silent reading, and in communicating ideas. Because 
of the intimate interrelation and interaction of these four factors, 
we grouped them together in Part II under the general title 
“Four Thoughtful Processes,” in contrast with the “four 
elementary skills” (handwriting, spelling, beginning reading, 
and automatic arithmetical calculation), which we discussed in 
Part I. We still have left for discussion two types of teaching 
and learning, which we shall include in Part III under the title 
“Recreational and Moral Behavior.”

  PART III. RECREATIONAL AND 
MORAL BEHAVIOR 
CHAPTER XIII 
INTRODUCTION TO PART III 
A review glance at all types of learning.—As indicated 
before, the chapters of this text are divided into three groups 
largely to aid the author and the reader in organizing and grasp- 
ing the main topics. These three groups are as follows: 
Handwriting 
Spelling 
Beginning reading 
Arithmetical calculation Four elementary skills 
Understanding social life 
Problem-solving 
Skillful silent reading 
(Communicating ideas 
( Habits of harmless enjoyment 
Civic-moral ideals and efficiency Four thoughtful processes 
Recreational and moral behavior 
What unity has Part III ?—We shall leave it to the ad- 
vanced reader to discover whether Part III, with its title “Re- 
creational and Moral Behavior,” possesses sufficient unity to 
justify its title and organization. The beginning teacher does 
not care about this issue and need not bother about it. The 
grouping of the two chapters together will have served its pur- 
pose for such a reader if it aids her to remember that Part III 
contains one chapter entitled “Forming Habits of Harmless 
Enjoyment” and another entitled “Civic-Moral Ideals and 
Efficiency.”

  CHAPTER XIV 
FORMING HABITS OF HARMLESS ENJOYMENT 
INCREASING THE HARMLESS ENJOYMENT OF LEISURE 
Main points of the chapter.—tr. “More fun for more people” has 
become a slogan of many serious, democratic, humanitarian, and in- 
dustrial leaders. 
2. A teacher who sympathizes with this idea must avoid puritan- 
ism and “highbrowism” and must understand the great differences 
between individuals in their methods of enjoyment. 
3. In any recreational pursuit the teacher may help the pupil by 
(1) introducing him to the recreation, (2) arousing his interest in it, 
(3) giving him the necessary recreational skill, (4) providing a suf- 
ficient number of pleasurable experiences so that he comes habitually 
to seek this recreation. 
4. Among the principal lines of leisure occupation in which pupils 
may be trained are the following: reading, music, plays and games, 
dancing, contemplation of beauty, curious observation of nature and 
society. 
5. Recreational programs for training in reading and music are 
rapidly being developed in elementary schools. Programs for read- 
ing are described here at length. 
6. Less progress has been made in organizing training along the 
other recreational lines. 
Sections of the chapter.—Our discussion of “forming habits 
of harmless enjoyment” or “increasing the harmless enjoyment 
of leisure” is divided into four main sections: namely, 
I. Social values of harmless enjoyment (p. 467). 
II. General precautions for the teacher (p. 470). 
III. General view of the school’s recreational opportunities 
(p. 475). 
IV. Details concerning various lines of recreation (p. 477).

Section I. Socrat VALUES oF HARMLESS ENJOYMENT 
More fun for more people.— You can make your own choice 
for the title for this chapter. Which do you prefer: ‘Forming 
Habits of Harmless Enjoyment,” or “Increasing the Harmless 
Enjoyment of Leisure,” or the heading of this paragraph, ‘‘ More 
Fun for More People”? Any one of these suggests that we are 
concerned with the recreational activities of people in this world 
and are interested in bringing as much of fun and frolic or of 
quiet, contemplative enjoyment into their lives as we can with- 
out interfering with their service to society. 
What is your attitude toward fun?—The last phrase, “with- 
out interfering with their services to society,” raises an old ques- 
tion that has been seriously debated ever since Calvin, about 
1540, cleaned up the town of Geneva, Switzerland, and put a 
ban on light amusement. His attitude—which, through its vig- 
orous adoption by the Puritans of England, has come to be 
known as puritanical—strongly affected New England life and 
still colors the views of many communities that oppose games 
and theatricals and pleasant reading. But such great changes 
have been wrought in modern life by the factory system and 
the consequent development of industrial cities and strong 
labor unions, that we find large numbers of civic and industrial 
experts who now maintain that organized recreational activities 
are among the most important needs of society. What is your 
view on this matter? Try to decide by determining in which 
of the following ways you regard plays, games, music, story- 
reading, and other pleasant leisure pursuits of children and 
adults. Are these activities 
1. Instruments of Satan, or 
2. A means of keeping people out of mischief, or 
3. A means of keeping them healthy mentally and physically, 
so that they can work harder and more efficiently, or 
4. Activities which are fully justified merely by the enjoyment 
which they afford?

468 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
Increased enjoyment for masses in democracies.—The 
answers of different readers will vary according to their tem- 
peraments and their training, but the answers of the great 
democracies of Europe and America are tending more and more 
in the direction of the fourth conception; namely, that in- 
creased happiness for the multitudes in this world is the great 
aim of the democratic governments, and that increased leisure 
and the means of enjoying it are important and worthy con- 
tributors to this happiness. As Sir Auckland Geddes said, in a 
notable address in which he interpreted the outcomes of the 
World War, there is ‘‘a realization of the aimlessness of life 
lived to labor and to die, having achieved nothing but avoidance 
of starvation and the birth of children also doomed to the 
weary treadmill.” 
Historical view. Influence of Industrial Revolution, human- 
itarianism, and democracy.—If space permitted, it would be 
instructive to examine carefully the influence of three great social 
movements in propagating a belief in more enjoyment of more 
leisure by more people. These movements and their influence 
may be briefly described as follows: 
1. TheIndustrial Revolution developing fromthe growth of the 
factory system. In England, through the invention of the steam 
engine and automatic machinery for spinning and weaving, this 
movement developed rapidly between 1792 and 1830; in Amer- 
ica it had its initial rapid development between 1830 and 1860; 
in Japan it began late in the nineteenth century; in India it 
appeared only very recently; and in China it promises to be 
the great development of the immediate future. Everywhere 
one effect of the development of the factory system is even- 
tually to create labor organizations which gradually attain great 
power. One of their first and most insistent demands is for 
shorter working hours or, conversely, for increased leisure and 
means of enjoying it. ; 
2. Practical humanitarianism. One of the most recent nota- 
ble examples of the interest of practical humanitarians in the
-P-A-G-E-485
  HABITS OF HARMLESS ENJOYMENT 469 
leisure pursuits of the masses is found in the social settlements 
and recreational centers. Speaking of the function of these, 
Jane Addams, famous founder of the Hull House settlement 
in Chicago, says: 
We have no sense of responsibility in regard to the pleasures of 
young people, and continually forget that amusement is stronger 
than vice and that it alone can stifle the lust for it. We see all 
about us much vice which is merely a love for pleasure “gone 
wrong”—the illicit expression of what might have been not only 
normal and recreative pleasure but an instrument in the advance of 
higher social morality. 
3. Democratic government for the people. This is the third 
historical factor in developing an increased sentiment in favor of 
more harmless leisure fun for all. This sentiment arises naturally 
from the conception of a democratic government as one “of the 
people, by the people, for the people.” In its operations for the 
people, in its efforts to increase the happiness of the multitudes, 
democratic governments have reduced the hours of labor in many 
cases and have organized recreational opportunities, which may 
vary from the small playgrounds of congested tenement districts 
to the great state and national parks, where the poor are privi- 
leged to roam at will in wonderlands that excel the private 
hunting preserves which were formerly the exclusive right of the 
noble and wealthy.* 
Democratic schools aid in training all for recreation.—Thus 
we see that great facilities for the enjoyment of leisure are no 
longer considered the special prerogative of the favored few 
who, throughout history, have always especially esteemed them, 
but are being rapidly developed everywhere in democratic coun- 
tries to increase the happiness of the multitudes. In this demo- 
cratic work the school plays an important réle in introducing 
pupils to many sources of enjoyment and in giving them rec- 
reational skills for enjoying reading, music, games, etc.

  470 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
Section II. GENERAL PRECAUTIONS FOR THE TEACHER 
Teacher needs correct temperamental attitude toward 
recreation.—The first essential of a teacher who expects to suc- 
ceed in aiding the school in its program for developing pupils 
along recreational lines is to possess a favorable attitude toward 
enjoyment, toward fun for fun’s sake. To secure this favorable 
attitude three precautions are important: (1) to avoid puri- 
tanism; (2) to avoid ‘“thighbrowism”’; and (3) to respect indi- 
viduals’ varied methods of enjoyment. 
1. Avoid puritanism.— Obviously, if the teacher’s attitude 
toward fun is puritanical, if she regards plays and games and 
pleasant reading as reprehensible, she cannot sympathetically or 
successfully train pupils along recreational lines. 
What enjoyments are harmless ?—In order to attain a balanced 
moral attitude toward enjoyment, it is desirable to ascertain what 
we mean by the term “harmless,” which we have used in our 
chapter title. For a number of years I used the term “noble,” 
which I had derived from another author, instead of the term 
“harmless.” Then in class discussions the question arose whether 
the enjoyment of playing tennis or reading “Treasure Island” 
could be called noble. We concluded that this term was not very 
useful for our purpose, and changed it to “harmless enjoyment.” 
After I had used this for about ten years, a professor criticized 
it as being merely negative, and asserted that negative proposi- 
tions are “no good.” This bowled me over at the time, but after 
awhile I recalled that most of the Ten Commandments are nega- 
tive (“Thou shalt not steal” etc.) ; so I decided that since this re- 
markable moral code had been so useful for centuries, we should 
be justified in keeping the negative term “harmless” in our 
thinking about enjoyment. Moreover, it is easy to point out that 
we have a big positive civic point in our striving to increase 
greatly the recreation and enjoyment of life experienced in this 
world by the masses. On the negative side we have merely to 
see that the recreational activities do not interfere with the at-
-P-A-G-E-487
HABITS OF HARMLESS ENJOYMENT — 47 
tainment of the other broad social aims of the school; namely, 
(1) good health, (2) good will, and (3) social service (business 
service, home service, and civic service). 
Recreation has positive hygienic and moral-service values.— 
For those, however, who are interested primarily in serious 
hygienic and moral-service problems, it is easy to show that 
recreation positively contributes to improve human life along 
these lines; that great leaders in medical practice, Y. M.C. A. 
work, civic welfare, and industrial efficiency lend their aid to 
the development of recreation in many ways. As Jane Addams 
suggested in the quotation above, harmless enjoyment may not 
only give normal and recreative pleasure but may be also “an 
instrument in the advance of higher social morality.” 
2. Avoid “highbrowism.”— This heading recalls the second 
feature in a teacher’s favorable attitude toward recreation, Pos- 
sibly some of you do not know what “highbrowism” is. You may 
have a clearer notion, however, after you read the quotations 
which are given below and which depict the baneful effect of 
highbrow tendencies in drying up one’s sources of sympathetic 
enjoyment. 
Highbrow musician’s musical miseries exceed her joys.— 
The joy-killing effects of too much technical training in music 
are humorously described by Percy Hammond, formerly the 
clever dean of Chicago dramatic critics, in an editorial which he 
has entitled, ‘The Joys of Mediocrity.” In it he writes of an ac- 
quaintance, “an eager lady who, proficient in the art of music, 
seeks her happiness through that medium.” Yet so thoroughly 
trained is she in this art that she sits through most concerts 
“in gloomy disapprobation.” 
Even her own endeavors to reproduce the masters do not always 
please her, and so the miseries of her musical existence far exceed 
her joys. 
This lady is a frequent patron of the theater. Of the drama she 
knows enough to find her way about, to look for her favorite authors 
and actors, and to attend them when they exhibit in this vicinity.
-P-A-G-E-488
472, TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
Her taste in the matter, however, grades with that of one who in 
music would be moved by the specious measures of “You Made 
Me Love You, and I Didn’t Want to Do It.” I saw her the other 
evening at a performance of “A Perfect Lady.” Now “A Perfect 
Lady,” despite its apparent effectiveness as an amusement, is not a 
good play. Irving Berlin or Gus Edwards, dredging the depths of 
sound, never dug up a product so hopeless musically as “A Perfect 
Lady” is dramatically. Yet my friend sat through its progress en- 
tranced. She was as happy as the most tainted wether of the flock. 
Her childlike raptures at each obnoxious discord were delightful to 
behold. Vanished was her recital look of bitter yearning, gone the 
discomfort and despair. I learned upon inquiry that she invariably 
found happiness in the theater. “Peg o’ My Heart” fascinated her, 
as did “Pygmalion” and ‘Potash and Perlmutter” and “The Legend 
of Leonora.” Yet for the art and the pseudo-art of the theater 
which contribute so much to the joy of her living she has the mild 
contempt of an expert in another art whose disappointments for her 
outnumber its fulfillments. 
Too refined a taste may bring distress.—A very similar inter- 
pretation of the opportunities for enjoyment in a great city, and 
of the limitations resulting from too great refinement of one’s 
artistic taste, was written by another noted Chicago journalist 
and observer of human nature, the late B. L. Taylor (B. L. T.). 
The opening lines are 
I met a friend of lofty brow— 
As lofty as the laws allow; 
and in the first stanza he describes “the recoil” of his friend from 
the realms of highbrow “litrychoor” to the cruder reading of 
simple folk. In the second stanza the friend’s similar recoil is 
depicted in the art of painting, and finally, in the last stanza, 
he is shown finding pleasure in the plebeian motion-picture 
theater instead of enduring being bored by classic plays. 
Most persons would rather smell a rose than analyze a thistle. 
—These satires on “highbrowism” from the pens of noted and 
well-educated journalists and observers of the recreational life 
of a great city prepare us to understand one definition of a high-
-P-A-G-E-489
HABITS OF HARMLESS ENJOYMENT 473 
brow as a person who would rather analyze a thistle than smell a 
rose. There is little doubt that most persons, however, would get 
much greater joy from smelling the roses of life than from an- 
alyzing its thistles. While we must make some allowance for the 
humorist’s license in Taylor’s lines about good taste’s bringing 
distress, we must admit that the “joys of mediocrity,” of which 
Hammond wrote, offer far greater and surer possibilities in 
increasing the harmless enjoyment of leisure by the multitudes. 
Hence in arranging to introduce pupils to greater sources of 
enjoyment, we shall do well to appeal to the common instinctive 
interest in rhythm, rime, melody, simple harmony, color, story, 
action, competition, and humor, instead of emphasizing the 
enjoyment of technique such as is involved in the study of 
structure, composition, and technical analysis. 
3. Respect individuals’ varied methods of enjoyment.— 
Our final requirement in a teacher’s correct attitude toward rec- 
reation is that she regard sympathetically the great differences 
in the recreational tastes of individuals. Owing to inborn quali- 
ties one individual may be decidedly lacking in the enjoyment of 
music and poetry, but be naturally very fond of thrilling stories 
and competitive games ; while his brother, with the same educa- 
tion, may be very fond of music, poetry, and quiet reading, but 
abhor competitive games. It is obviously absurd to try to force 
one of these persons to find his enjoyment in the same manner as 
the other. Even when different persons are enjoying intensely 
the same objective situation, such as a poem, or a novel, or a 
song, or a symphony, or a football game, or a golf tournament, 
they may enjoy very different features of it. 
Seven methods of enjoying a poem.—This fact may be illus- 
trated by the varied reactions of different persons in reading the 
following verses* by B.L.T.

Two,” by the kind permission of the publishers, the Reilly & Britton Co.,

474. TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
WHY ? 
By Bert Leston Taylor 
Why, when the sun is gold, 
The weather fine, 
The air (this phrase is old) 
Like Gascon wine ;— 
Why, when the leaves are red, 
And yellow, too, 
And when (as has been said) 
The skies are blue ;— 
Why, when all things promote 
One’s peace and joy,— 
A joy that is (to quote) 
Without alloy ;— 
Why, when a man’s well off, 
Happy and gay, 
Why must he go play golf 
And spoil his day! 
I find that different readers may enjoy any of the following 
aspects of these verses: (1) the general suspense and expectation 
created by the “Why”; (2) the suggestion of a brisk autumn 
day ; (3) the color effects of the foliage and sky; (4) the paren- 
thetical phrases by which the author pokes fun at his own tech- 
nique in writing jingle; (5) the gross humorous suggestion that 
golf is a foolish game; (6) the subtle humorous suggestion that 
the golfer has spoiled his day by poor playing; (7) the idea of 
the futility of striving for enjoyment and losing it, instead of 
easily enjoying the simple things close at hand. 
Summary concerning teacher’s attitude.—Thus we have 
seen how the teacher should (1) avoid puritanism, (2) avoid 
“highbrowism,” and (3) respect individuals’ varied methods of 
enjoyment, if she is to succeed in fully using the school’s recrea- 
tional opportunities, to which we shall now turn our attention.

HABITS OF HARMLESS ENJOYMENT 475 
Section III. GrNERAL VIEW OF THE SCHOOL’s 
RECREATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES 
School opportunities for recreational training.—The prin- 
cipal opportunities for training pupils in elementary schools for 
increased enjoyment of leisure are along the following lines: 
reading, music, sports and games, dancing, contemplation of 
beauty, curious observation of nature, contemplation of human 
nature and society. 
Teacher’s recreational services to the pupil. IJntroduc- 
tion ; arousing interest ; giving recreational skills ; habituation 
through frequent pleasures.—The service which a teacher may 
render a pupil in each of these lines will vary with the pupil’s 
previous training and with the subjects concerned. In general 
the teacher’s services may be classified as follows: 
1. Introducing the pupil to certain enjoyable activities, or 
forms of recreation. 
2. Arousing his interest in these activities. 
3. Giving him the necessary recreational skills. 
4. Providing sufficient pleasurable opportunities for each 
recreation, so that it becomes a specific habit of harmless 
enjoyment on the part of the learner. 
1. Introducing the pupil to recreational opportunities.— 
We may illustrate the first of these services by some such game 
as tennis or golf. Some persons are so ignorant of these games 
that they do not even know they exist; while other persons 
may have observed them, but never had the pleasure of taking 
part. In the case of golf many uninitiated observers consider it 
a silly game until they are introduced to it by being given a 
chance to play. Frequently after playing only a few holes, these 
same scoffers become confirmed enthusiasts, so intent do they 
become upon making a good score. 
2. Devices may be necessary to arouse interest.—For other 
players, however, a mere introduction is not sufficient—interest 
must be aroused by some device such as arranging competitive 
 
-P-A-G-E-492
  476 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
matches. For instance, I belonged to a golf club in which the 
men could not get their wives to show much interest in the game 
until competitive tournaments were arranged for the ladies; 
whereupon many of the latter became enthusiastic players. 
3. Recreational skills early acquired open up avenues to 
varied enjoyments.—Giving pupils the necessary skills some- 
times calls for very expert teaching, as exemplified in the case of 
pupils who have difficulty in acquiring skill in silent reading. 
Thus in the case of Grace, described on pages 139-140, the child 
was very fond of stories and begged her mother to read to her, 
but was so lacking in skill in silent reading herself that it took 
many weeks of special training to prepare her to read easily and 
silently the pleasant stories adapted to her grade. I once ob- 
served a very romantic country girl of sixteen struggling to read 
a simple love story called ‘‘Dick’s Sweetheart.” Day after day 
she would pick up the book and laboriously pronounce word after 
word. So difficult was the task, however, that she usually de- 
sisted after mastering a few pages, in spite of her craving to 
know the further developments in the romance. In the case of 
reading, music, sports, games, and dancing the recreational 
skills are frequently difficult to acquire, but, once attained, 
they pave the way for many hours of harmless enjoyment. 
Hence in childhood and adolescence it is important to develop 
the pupil’s skills along these lines. 
4. Habituation through frequent pleasurable association. 
—The final recreational service of the teacher to the pupil is the 
providing of sufficient pleasurable opportunities so that the pupil 
forms the habit of indulging in each form of recreation that may 
prove congenial to him. The difference between this service and 
that of giving merely the necessary skill is demonstrated in the 
case of pupils who learn to sing in school but at the same time 
learn to hate music; or the pupils who learn to read fluently but 
come to regard literature as a form of punishment. The ren- 
dering of this final service toward increasing pupils’ recreation 
requires, then, that the teacher should maintain a spirit of rec-
-P-A-G-E-493
  HABITS OF HARMLESS ENJOYMENT 477 
reative pleasure in each leisure activity and give the pupils 
such frequent experiences that they habitually reach out for 
further contacts with favorite authors or musical performances 
or games or beautiful things or the fascinating phenomena of 
nature and social life. 
Section IV. DETAILS CONCERNING VARIOUS LINES OF 
RECREATION 
A. Reading for Fun 
Wonderful joys in the world of books.—In spite of the fact 
that pleasant reading constitutes the most frequent and con- 
venient leisure pursuit of many Americans, there are many 
persons who miss the joys and thrills that are so near at hand, 
because they have failed to find them or lack the necessary 
skill to avail themselves of them. The great recreational loss 
suffered by such persons is best appreciated by one who has 
drunk deep of the pleasures of fiction, poetry, and other forms 
of literature. Think of the thrills that children have missed who 
have never read the stories written by the master romancers, 
from Homer to the modern weavers of fascinating tales. An ap- 
preciative suggestion of these pleasant experiences of childhood 
is given in the following poem by B. L. Taylor, in which his 
little daughter speaks to him wistfully of a book she has just 
completed. In order to test your knowledge of good stories I 
shall omit the title of the poem, which is the name of the book, 
and let you see if you can guess it. 
Comes little lady, a book in hand, 
A light in her eyes that I understand, 
And her cheeks aglow from the faery breeze 
‘That sweeps across the uncharted seas. 
She gives me the book, and her word of praise 
A ton of critical thought outweighs. 
“T’ve finished it, daddie!”—a sigh thereat. 
“Are there any more books in the world like that?”
-P-A-G-E-494
  
478 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
No, little lady. I grieve to say 
That of all the books in the world today 
There ’s not another that ’s quite the same 
As this magic book with the magic name. 
Volumes there be that are pure delight, 
Ancient and yellowed or new and bright ; 
But—little and thin, or big and fat— 
There are no more books in the world like that. 
And what, little lady, would I not give 
For the wonderful world in which you live! 
What have I garnered one half as true 
As the tales Titania whispers you? 
Ah, late we learn that the only truth 
Was that which we found in the Book of Youth. 
Profitless others, and stale and flat ; — 
There are no more books in the world like that. 
Can you guess the name of the book about which this poem is 
written? My son, at the age of ten, succeeded in two guesses. 
First he said “Tom Sawyer,” of which at that time he was 
reading a copy over and over. His second guess, however, was 
correct. In my classes to which I have frequently read the poem, 
a common guess has been “Alice in Wonderland,” owing to the 
fact that a little girl is speaking. If you want to know the correct 
answer look at the note on page 480. For our educational 
purposes the poem points out the wonderful joys of the world 
of books to which we are ambitious to initiate more pupils. To 
the means of doing this we shall now turn our attention. 
Book lists. Make a local reading list for each grade.—The 
first problem in organizing the recreational reading of any group 
of pupils in any community is to make a list of suitable books 
which the community can afford. In some wealthy city com- 
munities this list knows no financial limits; in some poor, iso- 
lated communities comparatively few books can be provided. 
One of the neatest arrangements that I have seen is the Toledo, 
Ohio, scheme of giving in each grade to each pupil a small card

containing the names of forty-five books adapted to the grade 
and circulated by the public library. A full-sized facsimile 
reproduction of each side of the seventh-grade card is shown on 
page 479. The cards are of durable, stiff cardboard of varying 
soft colors, a different color for each grade. To show the possi- 
bilities of such recreational reading, even in the first grade, we 
give on page 481 the contents of the first-grade card. 
A clever first aid to makers of reading lists.—The most 
cleverly arranged reading list that I have seen is one for high- 
school pupils. It is entitled ‘The World of Books: a Guide to 
Reading for Young People in which may be found Volumes of 
Many Kinds both Grave and Gay.” It was compiled by M. J. 
Herzberg of the Newark, New Jersey, High School. The pupil’s 
attention and interest are especially aroused by the novel head- 
ings appearing in black type with half a dozen or more books un- 
der each. Sample headings are “On the Wings of Fancy—Tales 
of Imaginary or Unknown Lands,” which initiates the freshman 
first-semester list; ““The Humor of Things”; ‘‘Adventures on 
the Briny Deep”; ‘Dogs and Other Animals”; ‘Books that 
Girls will Enjoy”; ‘Soldiers of Fortune—in War, Commerce, 
and Mankind’s Service” ; ‘Pleasant Tales of Olden Days”; “If 
you read these Books you will receive Extra Credit in Other Sub- 
jects: ‘Strange Tales of Many Lands told in Cunning Verse’; 
‘Fun and Frolic—at School and Elsewhere.’” It is fascinating 
just to see the author’s ingenuity in devising a seemingly endless 
list of such attractive rubrics. He further divides the books into 
fiction and nonfiction, giving under each a list for each semester 
of each high-school year. So unusual is this list, so novel and 
numerous its virtues, that it is a remarkable first aid to the 
busy teacher who is confronted with the problem of making a 
reading list for the upper grades or for high-school classes.

  ADAPTATION OF A READING-LIST CARD TO THE NEEDS OF THE 
FIRST GRADE
-P-A-G-E-498
482 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
Standards for listing books. A pupil’s word of praise. —The 
principal guide to follow in choosing books for the list of any 
grade is the interest of the pupils. As B.L.T. said of the girl 
in the poem quoted above, ‘‘Her word of praise a ton of critical 
thought outweighs.” Several investigations have been made of 
these reading interests of pupils from which we may derive 
notions as to how these interests change with age. These in- 
vestigations are listed in the bibliography at the end of this 
chapter. In arranging the books according to grades the diffi- 
culty of the vocabulary and sentences will also be considered. 
It would be interesting to note as the years go by, and pupils 
in the lower grades have fuller and fuller reading experiences, 
whether books formerly suited to a higher grade will find a 
place in a lower grade. In the case of upper-grade reading 
this has already come about, so that we find there “Treasure 
Island,” Poe’s “Tales,” and other classic writings which for- 
merly first appeared in high-school lists. 
Reading lists in content subjects.—Extensive opportunities 
for recreational reading are found in some of the content sub- 
jects, especially in geography, history, and civics. The most 
notable examples of lists in the last-named subject are those 
found at the ends of the chapters in H. C. Hill’s “Commu- 
nity Life and Civic Problems.”* (These we have discussed on 
page 245.) Many of the elementary-school history texts con- 
tain lists of historical fiction at the ends of the chapters. 
Coéperating with the public library.—In making the listed 
books accessible to pupils, codperation with the public library is 
an important factor. Frequently the public library furnishes 
sets of books to the school for a school library, or even for room 
libraries. In the latter case competent children serve as librari- 
ans in making charging cards, circulating the books, collecting 
fines, etc. In one city the board of education furnished the 
money for a selected list of books which the library then 
purchased and handled.

Familiarizing the teachers with the world of books.—It 
frequently happens that the teachers of a school in which a rec- 
reational reading program has been inaugurated prove to be 
unfamiliar with the books listed. Obviously this condition needs 
immediate remedying through stimulating each teacher to secure 
a sympathetic knowledge of the books listed for her grade. 
Unless the teacher is a very lame reader (as some unfortunately 
are) or is entirely uninterested in reading, it should not take her 
long to become acquainted with the necessary forty or fifty 
books. In Youngstown, Ohio, the public library furnished 
teachers with descriptive notes on each book, of which the fol- 
lowing is a sample : 
LITTLE WOMEN 
For fifty years “Little Women” has enjoyed and been fully 
worthy of an immense popularity. In thousands of homes Meg, Jo, 
Beth, and Amy are household favorites. Miss Alcott wrote this 
story out of her own family experience. There were four “little 
women” in her own home, and she was “Jo.” While the story does 
not follow the actual history of her own family, their struggles with 
poverty and their beautiful home life are well portrayed. The spirit 
of the whole book teaches service for others. Besides the four March 
girls, there is Laurie, the grandson of old Mr. Laurence, who is Jo’s 
especial chum. The incidents in the story are very natural— Beth’s 
shyness, which she overcomes to make an old man happy, and her 
rapturous joy over the gift of a piano; Amy’s humiliation when, for 
breaking a rule in school, she is whipped and made to stand in front 
of the class; Jo’s dreadful remorse over the temper which so nearly 
results in Amy’s death; and many more of like character. The first 
part of the book closes with the beginning of Meg’s romance with 
John Brooke, Laurie’s young tutor. The second part of the book 
shows us Meg’s marriage and her attempts at running a model home. 
Many laughable mistakes occur. In time two wonderful twin babies 
are born to them, and there are funny incidents concerning Meg’s at- 
tempts to have “model” children. No girl but mourns over Jo’s re- 
fusal of Laurie or is quite reconciled to her marriage with Professor 
Baer, kind and good as he is. Beth’s death and Amy’s happy mar- 
riage with Laurie round out the lives of the “little women.” They
-P-A-G-E-500

are grown up now, and the book ends with their reunion at Plum- 
field, which old Aunt March has willed to Jo. The story is not 
great because of its literary style; it is because it is so “human.” 
It touches the heart and holds a place, unique in children’s literature, 
which it will never lose.t 
Interesting the pupils.—Some pupils will need no special 
stimulus to read the listed books—their natural interest in read- 
ing prompts them sufficiently. Others will take sufficient interest 
merely because it is a class exercise—merely through imitation. 
Some will need artificial stimulation, such as that afforded by 
certificates, bookplates, requirements that a certain number of 
books be read each year, etc. By the time we reach this group 
in our thinking, we must raise the general question which we 
took up on page 473 concerning the desirability of trying to 
force a person to enjoy some particular form of recreation. After 
we have introduced the natural nonreader to the world of books 
and he refuses to care about it, we violate one of our funda- 
mental recreational principles if we keep nagging him to fur- 
ther efforts. To be sure, in order to give him sufficient practice 
in silent reading, so that he may acquire the skill needed for 
practical purposes, we may continue our instruction as de- 
scribed in the chapter on silent reading; but for the purpose of 
increasing his enjoyment of leisure, our efforts could be spent 
more profitably along other lines. 
Devices for arousing interest in individual books.—The 
skilled teacher will frequently introduce pupils to individual 
books by special devices for arousing their interest. Among 
these devices are the following : 
1. The continued-story device. In this case the teacher reads 
the book to the class until she reaches a thrilling point, and then 
stops, with the suggestion that the pupils may read the continua- 
tion themselves. 
2. Contagion devices. The popularity of books is contagious, 
as demonstrated by the brief but great popularity of new “best 
1 Elementary School Journal, January, 1919, pp. 325-326.
-P-A-G-E-501
  
HABITS OF HARMLESS ENJOYMENT 485 
sellers” or by the strong social demand for an old book when 
some occasion revives public interest in it. Fashions in reading 
books that others are reading are as potent in some circles as 
fashions in wearing clothes or arranging the hair or dancing are 
in others. Consequently in school, if popular pupils are per- 
mitted to talk of the books they like, a fashionable interest may 
be created through imitation. After a run is started on a book, 
not to have read it may make some feel as uncomfortable as not 
to know the standing of the local baseball team or the latest 
trick in jumping the rope or playing jacks. 
3. Appealing to individual tastes. Our incident of the boy who 
cared only about books concerning horses and other animals 
(described on page 369) illustrated the possibilities of the 
teacher’s arousing the reading interest in individual books by 
bringing appropriate ones to the attention of each pupil. Cas- 
ual occasional conversation about his favorite topics, with each 
reader of eccentric tastes, tactful reference to certain books, 
placing the book in his hands, even opening it to an attrac- 
tive picture or incident, are details to be considered in this 
connection. 
Class reading of selected books.—Sometimes whole books 
are read in class in place of the reading of short selections from 
school readers. Thus a fifth-grade class read Howard Pyle’s 
“Men of Iron,” and a seventh-grade class read W. H. Meadow- 
croft’s “Life of Edison.” Such practice is usually effective in 
introducing many pupils to a more advanced type of reading 
than they would undertake individually. Some of the class 
reading will be silent and some oral, according to the appro- 
priateness of the material. 
Poetry. Contrast of happy and unhappy early experiences — 
By means of effective oral reading some teachers succeed in in- 
troducing many pupils to the enjoyment of reading poetry. One 
fourth-grade teacher gave pupils copies of a few selected heroic 
or dramatic or sonorous poems. Each pupil made his own 
“poem book,” with a manila-paper cover, and pasted the poems  
-P-A-G-E-502
486 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
in it. All the poems were read effectively by the teacher and 
selected pupils, and each child was asked to learn a poem of his 
own selection and be able to recite it. I remember how my son, 
who happened to be in this class, regaled me one Sunday, as we 
were walking in a Chicago park, with 
It was the schooner Hesperus 
That-sailed the wintry sea. 
This incident recalled to me my own meager and disappointing 
early experiences with poetry. In childhood these consisted of 
memorizing certain moralizing “gems” such as “Be good, sweet 
child, and let who will be clever,” and of certain tearful home 
scenes preparatory to reciting similar verses in Sunday School. 
In college, after several years of technical training in the natural 
sciences, I decided to “broaden myself” by electing a course 
entitled “Introduction to English Poetry.” Again I was tor- 
tured, this time by a professor who spent the time with metrical 
analyses and nonsense syllables. Some of the students resorted 
to drawing cartoons of the professor, writing limericks, and other 
devices to pass the weary class time. Not until I was thirty-five 
and had a nervous breakdown, which forced me to find some 
recreations while hibernating in a sanitarium, did I discover the 
leisure possibilities of poetry. I found by chance the poetry 
section of a weekly review, a section then edited by the talented 
and lamented war poet Joyce Kilmer, who, it seemed to me, was 
unusually happy in selecting from contemporary verse the most 
pleasing of poems. 
Buying poetry collections for a boy.—Having in mind my 
own early painful experiences I decided to try to experiment 
with my son’s poetry reading to see what might be done. Follow- 
ing his pleasant fourth-grade experiences, we bought him a book 
called ‘Four American Poets” (Bryant, Longfellow, Whittier, 
and Holmes). This book contained a mixture of biography and 
selected poems. The boyhood of the four poets aroused some 
interest, as did also some poems that had well-defined rhythm or
-P-A-G-E-503
  HABITS OF HARMLESS ENJOYMENT 487 
humor. The boy said he didn’t like some of Bryant’s poems be- 
cause “‘they had no swing to them,” but he laughed in glee over 
some of the humorous verses by Holmes. Meanwhile I kept on 
the watch for a collection of poems for children, and finally pur- 
chased a volume edited by Kate Douglas Wiggin. This proved 
to be much more successful in arousing interest than the ‘Four 
American Poets.” The long humorous narrative poem by Cowper 
entitled “The Diverting History of John Gilpin” was read and 
re-read. The adventure poems were early favorites ; while at the 
age of twelve the boy even hit upon Southey’s endless string of 
descriptive terms in the ‘Cataract of Lodore” and pestered his 
mother by following her around the house and reading to her 
he li Sa anes Rising and leaping, 
Sinking and creeping, 
Swelling and sweeping. . . . 
Finally, in the seventh grade he was fortunate in being under 
a teacher, Miss Edith Shepherd, who organized a series of les- 
sons on ballads, such as “Lochinvar,” “The Wreck of the Hes- 
perus,” “Horatius at the Bridge,” and “The Burial of Sir John 
Moore.” Many of these were read, and out of a select list of 
twenty-five ballads there were only two or three with which the 
boy’s previous poetry-reading had not made him familiar. 
Devices for teaching ballads—The devices used by Miss 
Shepherd in teaching these lessons is suggested by the following 
assignment : 
THINGS YOU MAY DO WITH BALLADS 
I. Make a card for each ballad. 
II. Prepare to read to class one which you especially like. 
III. Prepare to give one in pantomime or dialogue reading, with two 
or three classmates, keeping it secret from the rest. 
IV. Memorize and recite to the class a ballad approved by the teacher. 
V. Choose one for a class play. 
VI. Guess from the teacher’s reading of selected lines which ballads 
she is quoting.

  488 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
Poetry-scale measures features that interest pupils.—In order 
to ascertain what types of poems are appropriate in developing 
the recreational habits of pupils of various ages, Professor Allan 
Abbott devised graded poetry tests which contain such assign- 
ments as the one on the opposite page. This assignment con- 
tains Amy Lowell’s poem “Sea Shell,” and three other versions 
which lower the poetic quality of the original. Abbott says 
of these: 
In lowering the poetic quality . . . of each poem the attempt has 
been made in one version (called hereafter “sentimental”) to falsify 
the emotion by introducing silly, gushy, affected or otherwise insin- 
cere feelings; in another version (the “prosaic’’) to reduce the poet’s 
imagery to a more pedestrian and commonplace level; in a third (the 
“metrical”) to render the movement either entirely awkward or less 
fine and subtle than the original. (10: 103) 
From his experiments with these tests Abbott reached the 
following conclusion : 
Vigorously expressed feeling is the demand of the middle years, 
—the upper grades, high school, and early college. . . . Poetry of a 
vigorous, unrestrained, and emotional type ought to meet their moods. 
. Much work needs to be done in finding and in adjusting to the 
course of study more good, vigorous verse in which the emotions are 
not too subtle and complex, not too individualized, and not in any 
case forced for the occasion . . . by making use of the ballads, of 
Burns, of Scott, of the best of Byron, of Kipling, of Vachel Lindsay, 
in comparison with the study, say, of the “Golden Treasury” or 
Milton’s “Minor Poems.” (10: 125) 
Favorite poems for children of elementary-school age.— The 
heading of this paragraph is the title of an investigation con- 
ducted by Miss Cora King in ten American cities and published 
in the Teachers College Record for May, 1922. From the re- 
sults a course of study in poetry is outlined, which should prove 
quite helpful to elementary teachers.

  490 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
enjoyment of poetry as a means of increasing their harmless 
enjoyment of leisure moments (for poetry is seldom read by the 
hour), we may suggest that the following items are important 
factors in the teacher’s equipment for such teaching : 
1. A keen enjoyment of simple, well-defined rhythms, similar 
to the enjoyment of rhythmic dancing or marching. 
2. Sympathy with the common human interest in adventure, 
romance, humor, rime, and jingle. 
3. Skill in full-toned rhythmic phrasing and oral reading of 
poetic lines. 
4. Intimate knowledge of the varied enjoyment values to be 
found in a few select poems adapted to her grade, plus specific 
skill in reading these poems so as to impel the listener to expe- 
rience these values. 
Periodical-reading. Frequent, convenient, and pleasant.— 
As a final point in our discussion of preparing pupils for the 
increased enjoyment of leisure through reading, we may note the 
possibilities of introducing them to periodical-reading. Among 
well-educated persons this constitutes probably the most common 
type of recreational reading. On pages 376-378 we described at 
some length a teacher’s method in introducing upper-grade pupils 
to newspaper-reading. Similar specific training could be organ- 
ized with periodicals which appeal especially to the varied whole- 
some interests of young readers. Their love of stories, their 
delight in adventure, their enjoyment of pictures and descrip- 
tions of strange lands, the joy that many find in what may be 
included under the general name of “tinkering,”—all these are 
met and served in good periodical literature. A library table 
containing these, together with occasional class exercises cleverly 
devised by the teacher to stimulate pupils to read them, may 
initiate or develop in many pupils habits of periodical-reading 
as a pleasant, convenient, and frequently instructive leisure 
occupation. 
Conclusion of discussion of reading for fun.—This con- 
cludes our discussion of the most common form of leisure oc-
-P-A-G-E-507
HABITS OF HARMLESS ENJOYMENT 491 
cupation among educated Americans; namely, reading. We 
have suggested how the school can surround the pupil with books 
and magazines, arouse his interest in reading these, and give him 
such frequent pleasant experiences with them that he will form 
the habit of reaching out for similar recreational experiences 
when he leaves school. In an earlier chapter on teaching reading 
we discussed methods whereby the necessary recreational skill 
in silent reading might be developed in all pupils. Even with 
the best of teaching, however, some pupils will remain uninter- 
ested in reading as a means of enjoying leisure. There are, 
however, many other forms of harmless enjoyment, to which 
we shall now turn for briefer consideration. 
B. Music for Recreation 
Need for songs that are enjoyable.—In order that pupils 
in school may have more fun with music, the first necessity is 
the use of songs that are intensely enjoyable,—lilting, haunting 
melodies, the gems of the art that fascinate people and leave 
them with a “song in the heart” to lighten the glooms of life. 
As one of our recent popular songs suggests, 
Tho’ the road may be long, 
In the lilt of a song 
I forget I was weary before. 
The publication of such collections for elementary schools is 
pleasingly suggested in the following description of a new series 
of school music books : 
Song material—TIn the books of this course the song is paramount. 
Each volume is a collection of beautiful songs. 
The books for the early grades contain a large number of rare 
and attractive folk songs, people’s songs, traditional songs, and naive 
songs of the varying moods, experiences, and ideals of childhood. 
As the course progresses, simple melodies from great and noted 
composers are presented, culminating in more varied cultural pro- 
ductions of the masters.
-P-A-G-E-508
  
492 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
Not dependent upon method.—The plan of each book neither em- 
phasizes nor ignores any particular method. It aims to present beau- 
tiful song material which may be used successfully by any teacher 
with any method. 
  
Fun through listening.—The second provision which is de- 
sirable in order to give more pupils more fun with music is the 
provision of experiences (and even graded practice) in listening 
to enjoyable music. The series of school music books mentioned 
above brings out this point in the following quotation: 
While the most progressive educators of today believe that singing 
is essential, they also believe that school music should mean some- 
thing more than singing. The musical activity common to the great- 
est number of people is listening. Pupils should therefore be taught 
to listen as well as to sing. They should be taught how to listen, in 
order that they may get additional enjoyment from music. Listening 
involves instrumental as well as vocal music; the two are closely 
associated. The pupils’ voices furnish the vocal music, the piano and 
school orchestras furnish instrumental music, and the phonograph 
furnishes both. 
A genuine growth in music means a gradual and progressive de- 
velopment. The songs of this course are selected and arranged so as 
gradually to lead the pupil to the goal. Running parallel with the 
songs is a suggested course in music listening. 
While the singing and listening courses of the series have reciprocal 
relations, yet each course may readily be used separately and inde- 
pendently or in conjunction with any other course. 
C. Plays and Games 
Specialized problems.—Except in the kindergarten, plays 
and games are commonly supervised by special teachers. For 
the kindergarten teachers valuable special training courses in 
plays and games are offered in normal schools. Under teachers 
who have been thus specially trained for supervising games, 
pupils develop recreational skills and a spirit of play that con- 
trast strongly with the attitudes and skills of pupils who have 
not enjoyed this favorable instruction.
-P-A-G-E-509

Example of a survey of plays and games in Cleveland.—A 
broad social study of the place and organization of plays and 
games in a school system was made by G. E. Johnson in connec- 
tion with the survey of the Cleveland (Ohio) schools. It is en- 
titled ‘Education through Recreation,” and considers such topics 
as the following: a play census of Cleveland pupils; their rec- 
reational interests ; baseball as much social as physical; base- 
ball for girls ; basketball ; football ; when the school should catch

the boy; early appearance of the gang instinct; etc. To such 
special treatises the reader is referred for details about the games 
and methods appropriate to each grade. Suffice it to say here that 
we esteem the development of an interest in play and of skills in 
many games as among the most valuable additions to one’s per- 
sonal equipment for getting more harmless fun out of leisure time. 
Dramatic play recently emphasized.—In many progressive 
schools dramatic plays, organized and presented by the chil- 
dren, have recently been emphasized. Within a few years we 
may expect to see published practical manuals that will instruct 
teachers in the organization of such plays which employ the 
dramatic talents of the children, delight the assembled: school, 
and give to many pupils skill in this important form of recreation.  
-P-A-G-E-510
494. TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
D. Dancing 
A moot problem.—Perhaps the most unsettled problem in 
organizing leisure training in public schools concerns dancing, 
since certain organizations and communities are so definitely 
opposed to it. For example, I heard of one school superintendent 
who introduced folk dancing into the curriculum and soon was 
overwhelmed by an avalanche of protests from groups of citizens. 
He wisely withdrew the subject, but after a safe interval intro- 
duced the same activities under the title of “folk games,” which 
aroused no suspicions or objections. In view of the fact that 
social dancing in America, if taught in the public schools at all, 
is usually assigned to the high school, we need not discuss it 
further in this book.t 
E. Contemplation of Beauty 
“Life has loveliness to sell.””—The possibilities of the enjoy- 
ment of beauty are suggested by Sara Teasdale, one of America’s 
leading poets, in the following poem, which was ranked by the 
Boston Evening Transcript among the thirty best American 
poems for 1916-1917. While you are reading it, phrase it so as 
to bring to your mind each of the beautiful pictures or moments 
which your experiences may have prepared you to appreciate. 
BARTER? 
Life has loveliness to sell, 
All beautiful and splendid things, 
Blue waves whitened on a cliff, 
Soaring fire that sways and sings, 
And children’s faces looking up 
Holding wonder like a cup.

Life has loveliness to sell, 
Music like a curve of gold, 
Scent of pine trees in the rain, 
Eyes that love you, arms that hold, 
And for your spirit’s still delight, 
Holy thoughts that star the night. 
Spend all you have for loveliness, 
Buy it and never count the cost ; 
For one white singing hour of peace 
Count many a year of strife well lost, 
And for a breath of ecstasy 
Give all you have been, or could be. 
Wide range of esthetic reactions. Untutored and tutored.— 
There is sufficient variety in the experiences of beauty suggested 
in this poem to appeal to almost every adult’s experience and to 
suggest the wide range of opportunities for enjoying the con- 
templation of beauty. I hesitate, however, to attempt a discussion 
of the practical problem of training pupils so as to enrich their 
enjoyment of beautiful things, since we should be dealing with 
some of the most elusive and varied of psychological reactions. 
What is the fascination that lurks in “blue waves whitened on a 
cliff” ? in “soaring fire that sways and sings’’? in “‘scent of pine 
trees in the rain”? What elements have these experiences in 
common with “children’s faces looking up holding wonder like 
a cup”? We all know persons who linger delighted with such 
experiences and long for them when absent. They have needed 
no tutoring to develop their enjoyment. On the other hand, we 
find persons who through training have Jearned to enjoy observ- 
ing certain combinations of color in a sunset or mountain scene 
or deep-shaded woods—color tones and variations which they 
would not have distinguished if untrained in color perception. 
Similarly, many of us can recall how the few simple references to 
Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian columns in our high-school courses 
in ancient history created in us the tendency to notice with 
pleasure these architectural elements in buildings.

496 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
Acquaintance courses.—In all the esthetic arts we find the 
former school instruction commonly dominated by the same 
striving for technical skill, the same emphasis on the elements of 
technique, that frequently dominated the teaching of music. 
Also, as in music, we find the development of new types of 
acquaintance courses which seek to enrich a learner’s possibil- 
ities of contemplative enjoyment without attempting to give

him creative or technical skill. In the realm of pictures the 
organization of such courses is greatly facilitated by the ex- 
cellent reproductions that have been especially prepared and 
commercialized for school use. 
F. Curious Observation of Nature 
An example.—The recreational possibilities to be found in 
the curious observation of birds and animals, trees and flowers, 
are illustrated by the general popularity of zodlogical and botan- 
ical gardens and by many personal examples. For instance, I’ 
have a brother-in-law whose interest in woods life has persisted 
from his adolescent days, spent in the Maine woods, although 
for many years he has been a business man in large cities in the 
Middle West. He and his four children, who are from six to
-P-A-G-E-513
  HABITS OF HARMLESS ENJOYMENT 497 
thirteen years of age, find much fun in observing birds, animals, 
trees, and flowers. Each child has specialized on one of these 
and, when camping or motoring, is called upon to identify ex- 
amples from his or her field of specialization. All, however, are 
learning something about every phase of nature. For example, 
  
  WHY IS THIS PICTURE (““THE ANGELUS”) NOT SO SUITABLE FOR 
FOURTH-GRADE CHILDREN AS “ATALANTA’S RACE”? 
they all—father, mother, and children—read with great pleasure 
“The Burgess Bird Book for Children,” the only volume among 
a dozen similar ones that is written in such a story form 
as to fascinate little children. It is obvious that such training 
parallels a part of the nature study of the elementary schools, 
which, in its efforts to train for the leisurely contemplation of 
the curious in nature, might be dominated at times by a very 
different spirit from that which prevails in the more cold- 
blooded training along scientific lines, valuable as the latter 
is in its proper place.

G. Contemplation of Human Nature and Society 
Illustrated by Walt Whitman’s rapture in crowds.—The 
recreational pleasures to be found in the contemplation of human 
nature and society are illustrated by the following portion of a 
letter written by the poet Walt Whitman to a car conductor with 
whom he had formed a friendship: 
New York, Oct. 9, 1868. 
Dear Pete,—It is splendid here this forenoon—bright and cool. 
I was out early taking a short walk by the river only two squares 
from where I live. . . . Shall I tell you about [my life] just to fill 
up? I generally spend the forenoon in my room writing, etc., then 
take a bath fix up and go out about twelve and loaf somewhere or 
call on someone down town or on business, or perhaps if it is very 
pleasant and I feel like it ride a trip with some driver friend on 
Broadway from 23rd Street to Bowling Green, three miles each way. 
(Every day I find I have plenty to do, every hour is occupied with 
something.) You know it is a never ending amusement and study 
and recreation for me to ride a couple of hours on a pleasant after- 
noon on a Broadway stage in this way. You see everything as you 
pass, a sort of living, endless panorama—shops and splendid build- 
ings and great windows: on the broad sidewalks crowds of women 
richly dressed continually passing, altogether different, superior in 
style and looks from any to be seen anywhere else—in fact a perfect 
stream of people—men too dressed in high style, and plenty of 
foreigners—and then in the streets the thick crowd of carriages, 
stages, carts, hotel and private coaches, and in fact all sorts of ve- 
hicles and many first class teams, mile after mile, and the splendor 
of such a great street and so many tall, ornamental, noble buildings, 
many of them of white marble, and the gayety and motion on every 
side : you will not wonder how much attraction all this is on a fine 
day, to a great loafer like me, who enjoys so much seeing the busy 
world move by him, and exhibiting itself for his amusement, while he 
takes it easy and just looks on and observes. (2: 250) 
What are the educational possibilities ?—The recreation 
which Whitman describes in this letter furnishes a leisure occu- 
pation that many persons greatly enjoy. Just what educational
-P-A-G-E-515
HABITS OF HARMLESS ENJOYMENT 499 
possibilities it offers I am unable to decide. It may be that it can 
be developed into the playful reading of biography, current 
events, books of travel, etc. and the playful puzzling about social 
problems that is so characteristic of the leisure life of many 
educated persons. Very likely the same interest in contem- 
plating human nature and society explains the great popularity 
of motion pictures, whose recreational features have not yet 
been adequately explored by scientific students of education. 
Conclusion of the chapter on harmless enjoyment.—To a 
considerable extent this chapter has consisted of propaganda to 
arouse an interest in developing practical recreational programs 
for giving more harmless fun to more pupils. In this respect it 
contrasts strongly with other chapters, such as the one on begin- 
ning reading, in which a highly developed technique of teach- 
ing was described. However, in some recreational lines, such as 
increased enjoyment of reading as a leisure occupation, great 
practical progress has already been made. In the next chapter 
we shall turn to our final type of teaching ; namely, civic-moral 
training, for which we shall have many sample lessons to illus- 
trate the great variety of practical forms of training that schools 
have devised.

CHAPTER XV 
CIVIC-MORAL IDEALS AND EFFICIENCY 
Main points of the chapter.—1. Examples of civic-moral training 
may be divided into those giving training in actual behavior and 
those which merely discuss behavior. 
2. Such examples bring out the value of the following factors in 
civic-moral teaching: insight into social life, skill in solving civic- 
moral problems, enthusiastic belief and interest in civic welfare, 
and habits of efficient civic-moral behavior. 
3. In studying the psychological factors involved in these we must 
consider the inborn components of the pupil’s character and the 
acquired components. 
4. Some of our best scientific studies of character development 
concern the native intelligence and moral behavior of the feeble- 
minded. 
5. In the secularized schools of America and France civic-moral 
courses of study have been developed to replace the older religious- 
moral instruction. 
6. As this civic-moral instruction becomes effective through uni- 
versal education and universal suffrage, we may anticipate increased 
improvement in the civic morality of democratic nations. 
Sections of the chapter.—Our discussion of the develop- 
ment of civic-moral ideals and efficiency will be divided into the 
following sections: : 
I. Examples of civic-moral training (p. 503). 
A, Examples of training through actual behavior (p. 503). 
B. Examples of training through discussions (p. 524). 
II. Psychological factors in developing character (p. 533). 
A. The instinctive elements in character (p. 534). 
B. The acquired components of character (p. 543). 
C. Special application to the feeble-minded (p. 552).

Ill. From religious-moral to civic-moral training in public 
schools (p. 562). 
A, Religious-moral training (p. 562). 
B. Civic-moral training (p. 565). 
Section I. Exampes oF Civic-Morat TRAINING 
Two types of examples. (A) Actual behavior ; (B) discus- 
sions of behavior.—Again we have a chapter title, ‘“‘Civic-Moral 
Ideals and Efficiency,” which will need considerable explaining 
before you will grasp its full meaning. However, every reader 
has some idea of the meaning of “moral training,” which is the 
central idea in the chapter; so we shall proceed to give several 
concrete examples of skillful moral teaching, and then take up 
some of the more abstract problems suggested by the title. Our 
examples will be divided into two groups: (A) those which pro- 
vide training in actual behavior and (B) those which contain 
merely discussions of behavior. 
A. Examples of Training through Actual Behavior 
1, A campaign against cheating. Social need for combat- 
ing graft, deceit, and cheating—Ordinary observation of 
social life reveals that cheating is one of the most prevalent forms 
of immoral behavior. Many boys and girls cheat in their games ; 
some adults cheat scandalously in cards and golf and other forms 
of play; frequently politicians graft and cheat the public out of 
the public money and public benefits in many and devious ways ; 
while dishonest business men abound, from the small grocer who 
gives unfair measure up to the richest corporation officers who 
employ talented legal advisers to enable them safely to break 
the laws and cheat the public. Practically everyone knows what 
cheating is, and knows that it is considered immoral; yet many 
have no personal ideals which condemn in their eyes their own 
cheating, loudly as they may condemn it in others. Such facts 
show us that we are confronted with a very definite and specific
-P-A-G-E-520

task in developing in pupils gripping ideals and habits that will 
cure many of them of tendencies to cheat. 
Miss McGuire’s account of her seventh-grade drive.—The 
following account of a skillful drive by a seventh-grade teacher 
against cheating is one of the finest examples that I have ever 
known of courageous, patient, persistent, good-natured moral 
training. It was written by Miss H. E. McGuire of the 
Chicago public schools, in response to my request in one of my 
summer classes for descriptions of actual civic-moral teaching. 
A CAMPAIGN AGAINST CHEATING 
By Miss H. E. McGuire 
Pupils’ letters acknowledge helpfulness—The two letters accom- 
panying this paper brought very vividly to me the results of the 
vigorous campaign against copying which I had waged early in the 
year. The letters were unsolicited so far as testimony was concerned. 
They were answers to a letter I had written on the blackboard to all 
the children on the Jast day of school. 
Chicago, Illinois 
June 26, 19— 
Dear Miss McGuire: — 
I think that I have learned more in this year, than any other year that 
I have to school. Before I came to your room I would just as soon copy 
my whole exam as to eat. But after awhile you got talking about honor. 
At this time I was in trouble at the Scouts. I found that if I would work 
everything out myself it would be much better for me. 
Your room has been the nicest room I have been in. I like the class 
that Iam with. X and I have caused a great deal of trouble in the room, 
but I have never seen a room that every one was perfect. Spelling was my 
worst study as you know. Geography I liked because the was something 
interesting to study about. 
I will be a Camp —— the first two weeks of my vacation, and the 
rest of the summer I am going to work at my father’s office. The next 
one of our family that will be in your room will be my brother . He 
is as bad as I am so watch out for him. If you get a chance to write me 
between the 29 of June and the 12th of July write me as we do not get 
many letters at Camp.   
  
Yours truly

Chicago, Illinois 
June 26, 19— 
Dear Miss McGuire: — 
I think this room has as much as gained two years worth of action in- 
stead of one, and I think it is all mostly on your part. I for one was the 
boy who had much brain work when I came here, partly because in arith- 
metic I generally depended on some one else for my answer. When I 
came here you knocked most of it out of me and I can truly say I have 
not done a dishonest thing this year. 
I will show that my steadiness of purpose will serve me well in eighth 
grade. 
I will always remember you as one who helped me along in life. That 
is to say lifted me a rung on the ladder. 
Yours always 
Vicious copying: a seventh-grade evil—I have always felt that 
children of eleven, twelve, and thirteen ought to realize the evil in 
deliberately scheming to get the results of a neighbor’s work. I know 
that teachers in the lower grades harp continually on the subject, and 
yet when children get to the seventh grade the vicious habit per- 
sists. I realize there is a difference in copying,—some is intentional, 
some is not,—but it has always seemed gross and evil to me for big 
boys and girls to squirm and strain and hide in order that they might 
see what is written on their neighbor’s paper. | 
September epidemic of cheating—Farly in September I noticed 
that my class contained a number of children who made a practice of 
cheating, and I determined to make a strong effort to make it plain 
to the children what this meant. I conferred with the principal and 
gave her to understand that if I sent a boy or girl to her on that basis 
the case was to be especially handled. As it happened, I never had 
occasion to. Meanwhile the class was one of the worst in that respect 
I had ever had. I noticed that the daily spelling lesson and the 
arithmetic problems which the children worked at the blackboard, 
side by side, were the sorest spots. I was not going to give up the 
arithmetic board work, for I enjoyed that work very much. The Sep- 
tember examinations brought out a perfect epidemic. There were very 
few exceptions—notes were written and other methods employed. 
First talk delayed until October—Now, at the end of the first 
month, I spoke for the first time on the subject. It came in among 
other topics in my talk—whispering, self-control, trustworthiness,
-P-A-G-E-522
506 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
etc. This was the first time I had given the children any idea of 
what my schoolroom ideals were. I had delayed such a talk for one 
reason. At the end of the month I feel the children have become 
acquainted with a teacher’s peculiarities and are not so apt to be dis- 
tracted by them while she is talking. A talk of the sort I want 
children to hear is wasted if given the first few days. 
Review of cases cured many.—I spoke very plainly, but men- 
tioned no names. I told of the spelling lessons I had noticed—the 
times at the blackboard. I recalled specific instances, so that those 
who took part might recognize the circumstances and know whom I 
meant. By this first talk I hoped to do quite a little weeding out. 
Some children would never again copy in my room, because they 
would realize I was aware of what was going on—some would be 
shocked out of it; some scared; some won, because I tried to be as 
human, as kind, and as firm as I could. 
Sore spots left: a particularly bad case-——During the second 
month I felt a marked decrease in the everyday copying. There 
were now but three or four sore spots in the room. One of these 
centered in a boy who wrote one of the letters. given on page 504. 
It seemed to me that he was possessed. He had a hard time in spell- 
ing, and he forgot everyone and everything in his effort to get his 
words from his neighbors. His arithmetic at the board was painful. 
He felt that such a hard time was before him that he gave up before 
he began and took all he could get. 
Frequent comment continued ; cases and principles —In the mean- 
time I spoke frequently and in as friendly a fashion as I could about 
the practice, trying always to give the impression that I knew what 
it was—that it might be common among younger boys and girls, 
but among seventh graders—no. I often spoke right up when I saw 
signs: “What do you want, X? The word is ——” (as if I 
supposed he was looking at his neighbor’s paper for the word), 
or, “Take your seat. You can see his work from there” (when any- 
one at the board looked right or left). This kept before the class 
the aim I had spoken of in my talk at the end of the first month— 
to tend to one’s own business, to stand on one’s own feet, to take 
the grade one had earned. Then, too, I spoke often of those who 
were so absolutely dependable. By this time I had found many who 
were. I laid stress on the comfort a teacher got from a roomful 
of children who were trustworthy in the highest degree. 
 
-P-A-G-E-523
CIVIC-MORAL IDEALS AND EFFICIENCY 507 
October examinations : still some devious devices——Finally came 
the examinations of the second month. I did my part. By various 
maneuvers I had so seated the class that temptation was reduced to 
a minimum. I watched, and saw almost no communication. After 
the examination I said: “I’m going to ask a peculiar favor of you. 
You know what our ideals are in a situation of this sort, and you 
have all been trying to attain them. I feel confident that many of 
us are on the right track, but I want to be in a position to help those 
that are not. I want you each to hand me a slip.of paper on which 
is one sentence. I want no name or means of identification of any 
sort. Fold it once. Write on it, ‘I know of no communication during 
the examination,’ or ‘I do know of communication.’” Out of the 
forty odd papers twelve or fifteen said there had been communica- 
tion. My work was far from finished. Some of this might have been 
innocent, but some I knew was not. The more public I made the 
disgrace of cheating, the more devious and secret the ways of carry- 
ing it on. I knew I would have to reach it through the children 
themselves. 
Pupils describe their clever tricks ——By the third month I had a 
large background to work on. For instance, one boy and one girl 
frankly told me, in after-school conversations, of the tricks they had 
used in the sixth grade. The boy was good in arithmetic, the girl 
in other things. They traded work. The schemes of children are 
beyond the shrewdest teacher. They thought the best trick was 
when one child walked up to the wastebasket and deposited a piece 
of paper, the next child carrying the valuable scrap back with him. 
Boys after school entertained me with tales of cheating-exploits. 
But I could see the point of view was changing. They could not tell 
me about it and do it this year. 
November campaign: “Samurai honor roll.”—During the third 
month I attacked cheating from a new angle. I announced that our 
roll of honor—mostly for well-behaved nonwhisperers—was to be 
erased, and a new list enrolled. We often did this—sometimes a 
roll for spelling, sometimes for punctuation, etc. But this time I 
wrote the word “Samurai” on the roll board. This was to excite 
the children’s curiosity. When they knew what I wanted, the list 
would be made. Overnight they found all kinds of information for 
me, and when they got the impression of nobility, high caste, that 
T wanted, I told them the roll was elective. 
 
-P-A-G-E-524
  508 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
“You have been together for some years. You know each other 
pretty well; much better than I do. Put on this list the names of 
those who deserve your respect for their strict interpretation of 
honesty. Each day we will ballot, and you may be proud to see your 
name there—put there by your classmates.” 
There was much excitement. “No fair to count last year!” 
“Count only this month!” ‘How will the new people get on?” 
“TI can’t decide on just one!” 
We concluded to count only this year, and to write three slips of 
paper, on each of which should be the name of one we knew to be 
roo per cent honorable. 
Before I allowed the class to make their first choice, I talked very 
gravely and earnestly to them but just as close to their level as I 
could. I spoke to twelve or fifteen by name and included all the 
others by implication, and thanked them for the remarkable change 
in the room in two and one-half months and especially for the effort 
all had put forth in this direction—toward a real roll of honor. I 
spoke again of the great pleasure a teacher feels when her children 
“fill the bill.” Not all of us could get on the roll the first day or 
first few days. Each child would have three choices. The three 
children who got the most votes each day would be entered. I 
warned against making it a popularity vote. I said it might include 
the whisperers, the noisiest boy,—anyone who had faithfully fol- 
lowed the call on his honor, gum-chewers and all,—but it must not 
include anyone who still took his grade from his neighbor. 
There was a great solemnity and gravity about this whole busi- 
ness. The names went up day after day, just as I would have put 
them there. The choice at first was almost unanimous, for there are 
children who always engender respect. In this way I hoped to put 
a new face on the matter—from proving to me to proving to their 
classmates. The ‘Samurai roll” was a fresh fillip. 
End of November: roll erased——When twenty or thirty names 
were on the list the end of the month had come, when we were in 
the habit of cleaning all slates, rolls reports, etc., to start fresh with 
the new month. This obviated the necessity of forcing the children 
te vote on some who had not yet risen to the occasion. In fact, 
several blank slips were handed in toward the last. 
Front seats and teacher’s eye courted—From now on I took more 
pleasure in the aspect of the room—no more scrouging around to
-P-A-G-E-525
CIVIC-MORAL IDEALS AND EFFICIENCY 509 
escape my eye. The children courted it rather. They wanted front 
seats! When bad grades came they took them, and worked hard to 
escape them in future. I could leave my room in the midst of 
written work and feel that (1) some would not even think of cheat- 
ing; (2) some might, but would refrain; (3) those who were weak 
would find scant encouragement. 
June letters reveal where seeds fell—And now in June, when I 
had forgotten much of it, I received the accompanying letters to 
show where the seeds had fallen—the seeds of fear, or love, or pride. 
Principles of teaching illustrated by Miss McGuire’s cam~ 
paign.—In interpreting Miss McGuire’s account of her cam- 
paign against cheating, we may note that the campaign had 
the following general characteristics: 
1. It was concerned with actual day-to-day behavior of the 
pupils ; it gave actual practice in moral behavior ; and in many 
instances it actually eradicated certain immoral practicés. 
2. There was a direct specific attack, instead of vague, indef- 
inite, indirect suggestions. 
3. The teacher showed great moral courage in openly attack- 
ing the evil that prevailed. 
4. Yet at the same time she was good-natured, thus securing 
the confidence and liking of the pupils. 
5. She planned the details of her drive carefully. 
6. She had patience to wait until the psychological moment 
to begin the drive. 
7. She was persistent in keeping it going month after month, 
8. She varied her devices so as to secure a cumulative effect. 
9. She created an ideal in the form of personal beliefs of in- 
dividual pupils and general public sentiment. Contributing to 
this ideal were the teacher’s obvious belief in it, her own sincerity 
and squareness, the social approval of the pupil group, the his- 
toric Samurai symbol and formula, etc. 
zo. She gave sufficient practice on varied occasions to habit- 
uate considerably the practice of honest effort. 
11. The results showed the value of the training.
-P-A-G-E-526
  510 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
Other examples of Miss McGuire’s civic-moral teaching. 
—Fuller appreciation of Miss McGuire’s methods of civic-moral 
teaching is secured if we realize that the above direct campaign 
is merely one out of many varied forms of training that she pro- 
vides. For example, one Saturday when I attended the perform- 
ance of Drinkwater’s “Lincoln” I found Miss McGuire and 
practically her whole class of seventh-grade boys and girls also 
there. Between acts they exchanged many comments on the play 
and doubtless used the experiences later in class in interpreting 
and appreciating Lincoln’s great moral strength and leadership. 
On another occasion Miss McGuire gave me a description of the 
manner in which her pupils had dramatized the meetings of our 
First Continental Congress and had debated some of the crucial 
questions which arose there, thus getting vivid ideas of some of 
the civic issues that early confronted our country. Both of these 
examples would serve admirably to illustrate our later discus- 
sion of civic-moral training through the study of literature, 
biography, and history. Here, however, we are especially con- 
cerned with Miss McGuire’s campaign against cheating as a 
remarkable example of the possibilities of developing in school 
civic-moral ideals and efficiency through actual behavior or 
practice. : 
2. Learning responsibility in a first grade.—Our second 
example of civic-moral training through actual behavior is from 
the work of Miss Marjorie Hardy in the first grade of The 
University of Chicago Elementary School. This example came 
to my attention when I was observing Miss Hardy’s methods of 
teaching reading (as described in Chapter V). At the end of 
the reading lesson, in which the children had been given their 
first books to keep in their desks, the teacher said: 
Put your markers in your books and close them. Notice how 
clean your markers ate. They will keep clean if you use them only 
for markers. Each child is responsible for his own book. Do you 
remember we learned yesterday what “responsible” means? Put 
them in your desks carefully.
-P-A-G-E-527
  CIVIC-MORAL IDEALS AND EFFICIENCY 511 
Miss Hardy’s account of her methods.—I was so impressed 
with this practice of teaching first-graders responsibility that I 
asked Miss Hardy if she would tell me about her system of civic- 
moral training. She kindly accommodated me by writing as 
follows: 
My dear Mr. Parker : 
What I have to say about our civic-moral ideals is what you al- 
ready know. However, I can tell you how we began, though there 
probably is a better way. 
I try to “nip in the bud” the idea which the children get at home 
that they are coming to a place which belongs to someone else; that 
they must listen to the teacher because she is going to teach them 
many things; etc. So the first day of school or soon after, while 
they are still interested in “taking in” the details of their strange 
surroundings, I talk over the situation with them. It quite impresses 
them when I say that the room is not mine but theirs while they are 
in this grade; that everything in the room is for their use, not 
for mine. 
This year we talked of the things we had and should use in com- 
mon, then of the things that belonged to individuals, as our desks and 
hooks in the coat-room and each person’s space in the cupboard. 
Right away the attitude of the children changed, and I believe it 
was because they were being met on a level with me; because each 
felt he had a place to fill and I took it for granted each was capable 
of filling it. 
We talked a little bit of what is meant by an orderly room and 
coat-room and an orderly desk. There were many suggestions. I told 
them there was one thing that they had not mentioned that had 
much to do, in my estimation, with the appearance of a room, and 
that was the appearance of each child’s desk when not in use. This 
brought up the question of what should be done with the desk chairs 
before we leave them. ‘They all gave reasons for not having them 
pushed out into the room in a disorderly fashion, the most evident 
reasons being that they took up space, would be in visitors’ way, 
and, aside from these, looked bad. This habit of pushing chairs 
up to desks became automatic in a week’s time by allowing no excep- 
tions to occur. As soon as a child had to be spoken to for running 
through the halls and for being noisy while working in the room (the 
 
-P-A-G-E-528
  512 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
bad habit of “thinking out loud”), I made a point of having the 
group decide on a way to pass to classes and on ways of working. 
Thus some rules were drawn up by the group, and any violator of 
these rules was not a coworker with the group and in such instances 
had to suffer consequences determined upon by the group. 
One thing I feel is very essential is to call the children “children,” 
or “boys” and “girls”— not “little folks,” or “little boys” and 
“little girls.” If any adjective is used it should be “big” or “strong” 
—they hate being called “little.” 
Another little device that works is to tell them that quite often 
visitors ask to see what materials the children keep in the desks, 
and that a visitor can tell just what kind of person the child is 
who sits at the desk by the way the desk looks. This again appeals 
to the children’s desire for social recognition. Of course they dis- 
cover that if their desks are disorderly, things can’t be found 
quickly. They have got now so they hate to feel they are keeping 
the group waiting because they can’t find their books, owing to 
the mussed-up condition of their desks. 
They were very much impressed by the word “responsible.” I 
told them that to be called a responsible person was one of the finest 
things in the world, because it meant that one kept the rules and 
could be trusted to do things for the good of the group. When we 
acquired goldfish a responsible person was chosen to care for them 
for the sake of the fish and for the sake of the group which owned 
them. This was also the basis for choosing other monitors. 
Such routine factors as falling quickly into line, wasting no time 
in getting down to work, getting a chair somewhere if one is lacking, 
never asking what to do but using one’s own judgment—these are 
things that not only make it easy for the teacher but also are good 
for the pupils’ growth. Such expressions as “I can’t,” “I have no 
paste” or “I have no paper ” etc. are taboo. A responsible person 
will make a point of looking each morning to see whether he has 
all his materials or, if he forgets until too late, quietly get up and 
secure whatever is needed. A “frequent forgetter,” however, is a 
very undesirable person to work with. 
The children soon realize that a child is measured in worth by 
what he contributes to the group, and that his contribution must 
represent his maximum ability. Such expressions as the following 
make me feel they are “getting it.” Frequently a child is seen  
-P-A-G-E-529
CIVIC-MORAL IDEALS AND EFFICIENCY 513 
straightening his desk before school, and this remark is made : “ Miss 
Hardy, what kind of a person sits at this desk?” Often a child says 
during a reading period, “If no one wastes any time for the group, 
maybe we can read the whole story today.” They know that having 
to ask a child to keep the place properly, to keep his finger away 
from words, to try not to drop his book, etc. takes extra time away 
from reading. I might go on with more “sayings,” but will not 
take your time. I believe they show that children can quickly get 
the “feeling” of law and order. 
Yours truly, 
Marjorie Hardy 
General characteristics of this first-grade civic-moral 
training.—In interpreting this example of civic-moral teaching 
in a first grade we may note the following important general 
features : 
1. It provided actual practice in moral behavior. 
2. The pupils were made intelligent about the situation and 
were led to see the reasonableness of the correct practices. 
3. Their interest was aroused through appeals to such in- 
stincts as ownership, the desire for social approval, etc. 
4. A public sentiment was created in the pupil group in favor 
of correct behavior. 
5. The teacher maintained a friendly, codperative spirit. 
- 6. She permitted no exceptions, thus observing one of the 
most important rules in habit formation. 
If you desire further impressions of the nice balance that 
Miss Hardy maintains between (1) the spirit of happy, intelli- 
gent, codperative child life and (2) careful habituation and 
drill, I suggest that you review Chapter V, in which are de- 
scribed at length her pleasant, progressive methods of teaching 
beginning reading. 
3. Combating the ravages of the tussock moth.—Our 
third example of civic-moral training through actual practice is 
from the work of Miss Mary E. Payne, a departmental teacher 
of natural science in a suburb of Chicago. The same genial,
-P-A-G-E-530
    
514. TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
coéperative spirit prevailed in this case as in the two preceding 
examples; hence I shall not go into as great detail, but merely 
give a few quotations to indicate the general setting and pro- 
cedure. The class was a fifth grade; the time, autumn. The 
situation, writes Miss Payne, was as follows: 
The trees of the village were infested with caterpillars of the de- 
structive tussock moth. The community takes great pride in the care 
and condition of its trees, and the school had a good variety on the 
playground. The nature-study classes and arbor-day programs had 
interested the children in knowing the trees and their history. 
The fifth-grade class knew from previous observation and expe- 
rience the life history, appearance, and characteristics of the Cecropia 
and sphinx caterpillars and moths, the monarch butterfly, and the 
silkworm. It was their custom to bring to the science class for identi- 
fication any insects they found interesting. Several of the unique- 
looking caterpillars of the tussock moth had been brought in. The 
teacher knew that in neighboring towns, especially where the trees 
were smaller and less numerous, the devastations of this species had 
become serious. The pests were spreading rapidly and getting estab- 
lished in the village to such an extent that the village forester had 
published in the weekly paper an appeal to all citizens to rid their 
trees and shrubs of the caterpillars and egg masses as soon as pos- 
sible. I planned this series of lessons to get the children to take 
action and to have a part in the local campaign. 
The earlier lessons which Miss Payne conducted by observa- 
tions, laboratory exercises, and discussions familiarized the chil- 
dren with the habits of the tussock moth, the reasons why birds 
do not destroy the pests, the special danger to the wonderful elms 
of the town, and the public appeal of the town forester for aid in 
dealing with the problem. Miss Payne’s sketch of the fourth les- 
son depicts the children’s discussion of their part in the campaign 
and reads as follows: 
My plan in this lesson was to present to the class the forester’s 
appeal for help, to renew and corroborate the observations made 
as to the life history of the moth, to add the forester’s sugges- 
tions as ‘to other methods of protection besides gathering cocoons,
-P-A-G-E-531
  CIVIC-MORAL IDEALS AND EFFICIENCY 515 
in order to take care of many beyond reach, and to get the children 
to plan active participation in the campaign. 
The forester’s article was read and commented upon. The chil- 
dren expressed a desire to do something, saying: ‘We cleaned most 
of the egg-bearing cocoons off our trees on the playground.” “Every- 
one ought to be able to get them off the trees in his yard.” “How 
will we know that each one is doing it?” ‘Bring them in as we did 
the others.” A girl who, during the summer, had been in a similar 
but more seriously affected village told that children there were paid 
for certain amounts brought in. This was not received very enthusi- 
astically : “The scouts wouldn’t take pay.” “It would be fun just 
to see how many we could collect.” ‘Let’s choose sides.”” Two most 
enthusiastic boys were chosen for leaders. These then chose sides 
and set boxes, labeled for their sides, where children coming in could 
put in egg-bearing cocoons. 
The teacher, referring to the forester’s article, suggested that they 
try a way of taking care of those otherwise out of reach—by touch- 
ing them with a sponge fastened on the end of a pole and soaked in 
creosote. Any who would bring their poles and sponges to school 
could use creosote from a supply furnished the school by the 
forester. 
Later, the children’s work was publicly recognized through the 
weekly paper as being of service to the community. 
Additional general features illustrated.—In addition to 
some of the points which we noted in commenting on the two 
preceding examples of civic-moral training through actual be- 
havior, this example illustrates the following general points: 
1. Pupils may be trained by actual participation in affairs of 
the local community. 
2. A knowledge of applied science may be helpful in directing 
this service along effective lines. 
3. Discussions by the pupils may train them in organizing 
civic campaigns and make them intelligent thinkers concerning 
civic issues. 
4. Boy Scouts trained through graded “man-sized stunts 
for kids.”—A fourth example of civic-moral training through 
actual behavior is the work of the Boy Scouts, Camp Fire Girls,
-P-A-G-E-532
  
516 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
and similar organizations, whose methods contain many sugges- 
tions for the effective organization of moral training in schools. 
We shall assume that the reader has some familiarity with the 
“stunts” of these groups, such as (in the case of the Scouts) 
knot-tying; bandaging; signaling; tracking; fire-building; 
camp cooking; the use of the compass; earning a bank deposit 
of one dollar; ‘‘seven-miles round trip alone”; distance judg- 
ing; hiking; exploration; wearing the uniform; the “daily 
good turn”; “merit-badge promotion” ; activities such as agri- 
culture, advanced swimming, taxidermy; and such public- 
service activities as ushering at conventions, guiding strangers, 
etc. You may not be so familiar with the fact that at the outset 
the boy takes the Boy Scout Oath, which reads as follows: 
On my honor I will do my best : 
1. To do my duty to God and my country, and to obey the Scout 
Law; 
2. To help other people at all times ; 
3. To keep myself physically strong, mentally awake, and morally 
straight. (2: 20) 
Furthermore, he learns the Scout Law, which teaches him 
that a Scout is trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, 
kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean, and reverent. 
Thus we find in the Boy Scout scheme a fusing of (1) activ- 
ities that appeal to the boy’s interest in romance and adventure 
and physical play with (2) fine moral ideals and practices. 
In evaluating the civic-moral training provided by these activ- 
ities, Professor David Snedden wrote an unusually suggestive 
article for the Teachers College Record of January, 1917, which 
deserves very careful study by those who are interested in the 
practical organization of similar training. We shall quote merely 
one brief statement, as follows: 
The pedagogical genius . . . of the founders of the Boy Scout 
System of extra-school education . . . is especially shown: (1) in 
the fact that the ideals made conspicuous for the Scouts and the ac-
-P-A-G-E-533
CIVIC-MORAL IDEALS AND EFFICIENCY 517 
tivities enjoined are in very great degree “‘man-sized” and “man- 
used,” but adapted to boys in that transitional period when they stil 
want in large part to “behave like kids but be treated like men”; 
and (2) in the fact that the whole scheme of training is based on 
  
GOOD CITIZENSHIP CARD 
Savanna Education teaches that boys and girls become good citizens by 
practicing in the schools those valuable acts which are for social better- 
ment out in the world. We believe the doing of things which make for 
social uplift is the fundamental work of any school. We believe that all 
those things—-helpfulness, fairness, thoughtfulness, cleanliness— which 
constitute good citizenship can be developed in the schools only through 
actual appreciation of and participation in citizenship’s invaluable values. 
We believe that these desirable ends which education must build upon 
may be developed in boys and girls while they are pursuing their daily 
round of work —on the playgrounds, in the recitation rooms, in the halls 
and during study. 
This card is given to

practicable “teaching units,” “stunts,” “graded steps,” “projects,” 
concrete achievements, specific opportunities for self-measurement, 
and self-criticism. (2: 28) 
Another notable discussion of the civic-moral aspects of Boy 
Scout training is contained in a Teachers College dissertation 
entitled ‘The Function of Ideals and Attitudes in Social Educa- 
tion,” by P. F. Voelker. Unique features of Voelker’s work in- 
clude experiments with groups of boys to determine the effects 
of specific instruction concerning trustworthiness, and the use 
of tests to measure the moral changes brought about.

5. Score cards for rating behavior—Our fifth and final 
example of civic-moral training through actual behavior is the 
use of score cards for rating the moral qualities exhibited by 
pupils. A simple form is shown on the preceding page, namely, 
a “Good Citizenship Card,” which is given once a month to 
members of each grade who receive a majority vote of the class. 
Score card for hygienic living.—A more complex analysis 
of certain aspects of a pupil’s behavior is required in the “Score 
Card for Hygienic Living” (5: 268), which is shown on 
page 519. The influence of this card may be shown by the 
manner in which it stimulated my son to brush his hair. I had 
brought the card home from my office one day, and the boy 
started to rate himself just for fun. He decided in advance that 
he wanted to make a score of at least 75. Fortunately his 
school and home training took care of some of the big items 
like sleeping with open windows, which was given a value of 
Io points; hygienic dinner, valued at 10; vigorous exercise, 5 ; 
and retiring early, 10. His total, however, was only 74, so he 
looked for an easy “‘stunt” that he might add to raise his score 
to 75. He spotted “Hair brushed twenty-five times [strokes? 
or more,” a practice which we had endeavored in vain to culti+ 
vate in him. He immediately adopted it for several days, much 
to the improvement of his appearance. I imagine he might have 
learned to be careful even in exploring his ears when washing if 
credit for this had been given in the score card. 
Elaborate analysis of moral behavior in Horace Mann 
score card.—The most complete analysis and scoring of a 
pupil’s moral characteristics and behavior that I have seen is 
the “Scale for Measuring the Importance of Habits of Good 
Citizenship,” prepared for the Horace Mann School of Columbia 
University and published and discussed in the Teachers College 
Record for January, 1919, and January, 1922. The maximum 
score which a pupil can attain on this scale is 1000 points. 
Many items contribute to this total; for example, if he is re- 
fined in speech and manner he may receive 25 points; if or-

siderate, 60 points; if obedient, 35 points; if characterized by 
helpful initiative, 60 points; if honest and reliable, 70 points. 
Analysis of being courteous, codperative, and considerate.— 
In order that teachers and pupils may understand clearly the 
acts or behavior that indicate the possession of these general 
qualities, each one, such as being courteous or being codpera- 
tive and considerate, is analyzed as shown on page 521. 
Use in diagnosing needs of troublesome children.—It is not 
intended that all the details of this card should be used with all 
children, but it would prove particularly useful in analyzing 
the behavior of a troublesome child, diagnosing his special 
weaknesses and needs, and deciding upon specific treatment. 
In its more general features the card is made the basis of regu- 
lar statements to parents upon the report form shown on 
page 522, as indicated in the following quotation: 
In the second part of the report card, only the habits and atti- 
tudes in which the child is notably strong or weak are reported, no 
mention being made of those which show average development. . . . 
Habits and attitudes “in which improvement has been marked” are 
also reported. (4a: 39) 
Parents are given reports of pupils’ strong, weak, and improv- 
ing qualities.—The desirability of furnishing to parents such a 
report upon the pupil’s moral qualities is brought out in the 
following quotation : 
In spite of the fact that the Horace Mann School had attempted 
to lay implicit emphasis on character formation as the most vital 
function of the school, only occasional, if any, reference to progress 
in character development in the children was made to the parents 
[before the adoption of this report card]. Naturally the parents and 
pupils felt that the school was sending home on the regular report 
card the information about the child which was considered most im- 
portant; and the teachers themselves, for a similar reason, were 
likely to view the instruction in the traditional school studies as their 
chief duty. (4a: 36)

The word “average” is used to indicate the achievement in a given sub- 
ject of the middle half of a representative class. “ Above average ” or “ below 
average” indicates the achievement of that per cent of the class (approxi- 
mately 25 per cent) that is above or below this middle group. Only the best 
and the worst points are mentioned, both in studies and in habits and attitudes. 
The studies unchecked in the list below are those which your child is pur-

Conclusion of examples of civic-moral training through 
actual behavior.—This concludes our first series of real ex- 
amples of civic-moral training ; namely, those which center in the 
pupil’s actual behavior. The list included (1) a seventh-grade 
campaign against cheating; (2) a first-grade method of training 
pupils to be responsible; 
(3) a fifth-grade participa- 
tion in a community cam- 
paign against the ravages 
of the tussock moth; (4) 
the “man-sized stunts for 
kids” organized for the Boy 
Scouts; and (5) score cards 
for rating the civic-moral 
attitudes and behavior of 
pupils. From these exam- 
ples the reader should de- 
rive some concrete notions 
of the skillful teaching and 
varied devices that expert 
teachers and organizershave 
successfully used in train- 
ing pupils in civic-moral 
behavior. These practices wyray cryic-MORAL TRAINING DOES and devices ranged from the SCHOOL GARDENING OFFER?

moral training; namely, those concerned less with actual prac-

  524. TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
B. Examples of Civic-Moral Training through 
Discussions 
Subjects included.—Under the general heading we shall 
include examples from the teaching of literature, biography, 
history, geography, and civics. 
Literature. Effect of story about helping old lady with 
basket.—Some of the possibilities of moral instruction through 
the study of literature are suggested by an incident from my 
own experiences when a child in the fifth grade. In our school 
reader we had one day an illustrated story of two boys who 
assisted an old woman to carry a basket of apples. Each was 
appropriately rewarded by being given a large red apple. After 
school two other boys and I were walking up the railroad track 
and overtook an old woman carrying a wash basket full of 
clothes. Following the example in the story which we had read 
that day, we volunteered our services and carried the basket 
about a mile up the track to a mysterious cottage in the woods. 
The old woman gave us no red apples, but did show us her 
canary bird. We all arrived home late for supper and suffered 
the consequences. However, the incident illustrates the fact 
that the old-fashioned, made-for-the-purpose moral tales were 
sometimes effective in influencing pupils to perform worthy 
deeds. 
How Dickens’s “Christmas Carol” cured a boy of stinginess. 
—A more elaborate example of the use of literature to develop 
moral insight and sentiments is found in a description furnished 
me by Miss Lydia Weber of her methods of teaching Dickens’s 
“Christmas Carol” just before the Christmas season. She wrote 
in part as follows: 
I believe the story should be read rapidly and an effort made to 
discover by direct or indirect questioning the reaction the story may 
have had upon the different pupils. For example, after the first chap- 
ter had been read over thoughtfully, I conducted the lesson in the 
following manner : 
Teacher. ‘Whom did you meet in Mr. Dickens’s story ?”
-P-A-G-E-541
CIVIC-MORAL IDEALS AND EFFICIENCY 525 
All hands went up, but since I knew the child to whom the con- 
crete appealed, I directed my question to him. It is my experience 
that he is frequently the pupil whose ideals should be altered or 
raised by the morals represented in the story. Hence James was 
called upon. 
James. “Nephew, Scrooge, ghost, and clerk.” 
Someone reminded him he had forgotten the two gentlemen solic- 
iting for charity. 
Teacher. ‘What made you mention the nephew first, James? Is 
he the most important character of our story?” 
James. “Oh, no; but he was so funny and was always teasing his 
grouchy old uncle and didn’t care what he said.” 
Teacher (with a laugh). “Grouchy, you say. Why?” 
Whereupon James mentioned a few reasons, such as, “He wouldn’t 
say anything but ‘Bah’ and ‘Humbug,’” indicating that he did not ° 
comprehend the real Scrooge further than was expressed in these 
monosyllabic answers. 
Teacher. “John, you seemed to think he was a grouch, too. 
Why?” 
John. “Well, he was hard and sharp as flint, and had a grating 
voice.” 
Teacher. “Have you any proof of his being grouchy other than 
his manner toward his nephew?” 
Reflecting a moment, John stated that it was mentioned in a para- 
graph. I asked him to find the statement and read the whole para- 
graph, since he was a good oral reader—one who could bring a vivid 
picture to the minds of his fellow pupils. At the conclusion of the 
paragraph someone volunteered the remark that Scrooge was chilly 
and made everyone else uncomfortably cold, as told in a certain 
paragraph, which the pupil then read. The pupils suggested readily 
the characteristics they had discovered. Thus, without further ques- 
tioning, timid Mary volunteered, “Everyone was afraid of him— 
man, woman, and child, and even the dogs leading their blind 
masters.” 
Teacher. “Don’t you think you could frighten Scrooge?” 
James. “No, he doesn’t care what happens.” 
This idea for fearlessness on the part of Scrooge was later con- 
trasted with the extreme fear displayed when the ghost appears. 
Another Pupil. “Oh, he was awfully mean and stingy—he wouldn’t 
even contribute toward the Christmas-dinner fund for the poor.”  
-P-A-G-E-542
  526 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
Another Pupil. “He was so stingy he didn’t even want his obedient 
clerk to have Christmas Day off with pay.” 
After we had summarized all Scrooge’s faults and had noticed 
certain historic or current parallels, I led the pupils to make com- 
parisons within their own experience, which gradually turned to self- 
introspection in many cases. To give a concrete illustration, there 
was a lad who came from a home where every energy was bent upon 
accumulating a sum of money. It was constantly encouraged by the 
family. This seventh-grade boy at thirteen had, through his untiring 
efforts as a newsboy and through ability to sacrifice his personal 
wants, accumulated $350. He was so desirous of enlarging this sum 
that rather than buy his necessary school equipment, he would bor- 
row paper, pencils, in fact everything he needed, from his school- 
mates. Somehow he caught the idea of stinginess, and I could see he 
was overcoming the borrowing habit. He even gave liberally from 
his own purse that season toward the Christmas charity carried on 
in the building—a thing no member of that family had ever been 
known to do before. 
There are many little characteristics, commonplace but lovely, 
which we bring out in studying the Bob Cratchit family life in much 
the same way, and these elicit from the school group a noticeable re- 
action. It may not be permanent, but that is due to lack of oppor- 
tunity in the school to follow up the impressions and to combat 
thoroughly old habits and strong outside influences. 
Third-grade. studying and dramatizing of Sir Galahad’s 
knightly qualities—Many other examples of using literary 
selections as the basis of developing moral insight and senti- 
ments have been described for me by the experienced teachers 
in my summer class. Thus a third-grade teacher, Miss Sara 
Little, described three lesson periods devoted to the story of 
Sir Galahad. These included a telling of the story, the pur- 
chase of a large picture of the knight to decorate the room, and 
a dramatization which involved the pupils’ choosing for the 
principal character a boy who had Sir Galahad’s qualities. The 
knight, said the pupils, was honest, truthful, noble, brave, 
polite, and kind and helped the old and weak. In selecting a 
boy suited to this part, they chose by secret ballot one of the
-P-A-G-E-543
CIVIC-MORAL IDEALS AND EFFICIENCY 527 
best boys in the class, who was kind, courteous, and never 
rude. After the play was given, the teacher occasionally used 
its moral lessons by saying in the case of rudeness or unkind- 
ness exhibited by pupils, “Do you think Sir Galahad would 
do that?’”’ Occasionally she heard members of the class on 
the playground saying, ‘Oh, Sir Galahad wouldn’t do that,” 
thus showing that the instruction had carried beyond the 
schoolroom. . 
Principles and rules illustrated by these literature lessons. 
—In interpreting these examples of moral instruction through 
discussions of literature, we may note the following points: 
1. They illustrate the fact that such instruction does some- 
times actually influence the behavior of some pupils, as shown 
by the boys’ carrying the old woman’s basket. 
2. Discussions by the pupils help the teacher to get an idea 
of each child’s impressions and reactions. 
3. These discussions, if skillfully directed, serve to bring out 
the strong, decent sentiments that are frequently latent in many 
of the pupils, and thus to formulate and objectify a helpful 
public sentiment in the group. 
4. Dramatization is an expressional device that may be used 
for clarifying and vivifying moral ideas and sentiments, just as 
we found it used in Chapter IX for giving insight into con- 
temporary social life. 
5. A typical character, such as Scrooge or Sir Galahad, may 
serve to impress and symbolize moral ideas more effectively than 
would mere abstract or general principles. 
6. In general, instruction that is intended to give moral in- 
sight and sentiments may well observe the same principles 
as were laid down in Section IV of our chapter on under- 
standing social life. With slight modification these read as 
follows : 
a. Appeal to some fundamental instinctive tendency, interest, 
or activity ; for example, in the Sir Galahad lessons the instinc- 
tive interest in romance and dramatization was utilized.  
-P-A-G-E-544
  528 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
b. In presenting moral examples through literature, select 
vivid representations of the trait that is to be discussed, such 
as Dickens’s notable characterization of Scrooge. 
c. Stimulate the pupils to elaborate and reflect upon their 
experiences from many angles and in many connections. 
7. We shall have to add to these rules covering methods of 
giving clear, vivid ideas two others that are particularly im- 
portant in civic-moral training; namely: 
a, Endeavor to arouse the pupil’s sympathies, hatreds, and 
other emotional responses, so as to cultivate an enthusiastic, 
impelling belief in correct behavior (such as being generous) 
and dislike of wrong behavior (such as being stingy). 
6. Give pupils opportunities to turn their beliefs into habits 
of action, as illustrated by pupils’ actually giving to the Christ- 
mas charities. 
These rules probably apply also to civic-moral training that 
centers in discussions of biography, history, geography, and 
civics, to which we shall now turn our attention. 
Biography. Example of studying Stevenson’s life for cheer- 
fulness.—An illustration of methods of using biography to incul- 
cate moral ideas and sentiments was given me by Miss Margaret 
Dease, who used material from the life and writings of Robert 
Louis Stevenson to teach pupils the virtue of cheerfulness. 
Upon pupils who have been fascinated by Stevenson’s lilting, 
haunting poems of childhood and who have been thrilled by 
his “Treasure Island” and “Kidnapped,” the facts of his 
cheerfulness under great physical pain may make a very vivid 
impression. In addition, then, to giving the pupils many other 
interesting facts about Stevenson, Miss Dease centered their 
attention upon the following paragraph written by him the year 
before he died: ; 
For fourteen years I have not had a day’s real health; I have 
wakened sick and gone to bed weary; and I have done my work 
unflinchingly. I have written in bed and written out of it, written 
in hemorrhages, written in sickness, written torn by coughing, writ-
-P-A-G-E-545
  CIVIC-MORAL IDEALS AND EFFICIENCY 529 
ten when my head swam for weakness; and for so long, it seems to 
me I have won my wager and recovered my glove. I am better now, 
have been, rightfully speaking, since first I came to the Pacific; and 
still, few are the days when I am not in some physical distress. And 
the battle goes on—ill or well is a trifle; so as it goes. I was made 
for a contest, and the Powers have so willed that my battlefield 
should be this dingy, inglorious one of the bed and the physic bottle. 
At least I have not failed, but I would have preferred a place of 
trumpetings and the open air over my head.t 
Accompanying this were other quotations which brought out 
Stevenson’s belief in cheerfulness, such as his lines beginning, 
“There is no duty we so much underrate as the duty of being 
happy,” and the lines of the “Celestial Surgeon,” which reads 
in part: 
If I have faltered more or less 
In my great task of happiness ; 
If I have moved among my race 
And shown no glorious morning face; 
If beams from happy human eyes 
Have moved me not; if morning skies, 
Books, and my food, and summer rain 
Knocked on my sullen heart in vain: — 
Lord thy most pointed pleasure take 
And stab my spirit broad awake ; 
Or, Lord if too obdurate I, 
Choose thou, before that spirit die, 
A piercing pain, a killing sin, 
And to my dead heart run them in! 
The reader will appreciate by this time that many devices 
calling for expression and action by the pupils may be used in 
order to carry out fully the moral instruction latent in this 
material. As I have presented the example here, it merely sug- 
gests the large possibilities of using the biography of a man who 
has given the pupils some of their greatest joys and thrills, to 
typify cheerfulness under great suffering. If skillfully handled

  530 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
according to some of the rules described above, similar cheerful 
behavior may be stimulated in some of the pupils. 
Biographical teaching long esteemed.—Throughout history 
biographical material has been highly esteemed for its value in 
moral teaching. In our own country the lives of national lead- 
ers such as Washington, Franklin, and Lincoln have been ex- 
tensively used. I regret that space forbids further description 
and evaluation of the classroom devices that are appropriate. 
History, geography, and civics. Contributions to civic- 
moral insight shown in earlier chapters.—From the standpoint 
of giving an understanding of social needs and relationships, we 
have already thrown considerable light in our earlier chapters 
upon the services rendered by modern methods of studying his- 
tory, geography, and community life or civics. Our long Chap- 
ter IX, on “Understanding Social Life,” was specifically devoted 
to this matter, while some of the sample lessons in Chapter X, 
on “Problem-Solving,” showed how pupils are given some un- 
derstanding of the economic factors involved in such complex 
problems as the cost of sugar or the growth of London. 
Moral decisions frequently require technical understanding 
of modern interdependence.—Owing to the complex interde- 
pendence of highly civilized communities and individuals in the 
world today, there is frequently need of very extensive technical 
information about society to enable a person to decide correctly 
some of the larger civic-moral issues that confront him. For ex- 
ample, a member of a labor union has to decide whether he will 
side with the more conservative labor leaders who believe in 
friendly codperation with employers, or whether he will desert 
the established unions and join a labor organization that is bent 
upon destroying modern industry and instituting a revolution 
to overthrow the United States government. Or, to take another 
example, a voter has to decide whether to vote for a party that 
believes in a tariff which gives special protection to certain 
American industries, even though the tariff makes the voter pay 
more for his food and clothing, or whether to vote for a party
-P-A-G-E-547
    
CIVIC-MORAL IDEALS AND EFFICIENCY 531 
that believes in free trade which will enable the voter to make 
his personal purchases more cheaply, although it may throw 
some men out of work. 
Civic lessons illustrating technical study of public health.— 
In order to illustrate the methods of class procedure in giving 
pupils insight into such technical civic problems, we quote the 
following account of an eighth-grade lesson in Indianapolis on 
the topic of public health: 
The lessons extended over several days, including observational 
work etc. Textbook assignment was made only after the class dis- 
cussion was well under way. 
The pupils discussed informally what good health means to each 
one and gave examples from their own experiences of consequences 
of sickness. They discussed specific dangers to their own health, 
such as impure food, water, or air. They explained how they indi- 
vidually cared for their own health or how at times they were careless 
of it. They discussed how in many cases their health depended not 
merely on their own care but on the care of others, and how the 
danger to health is increased where many people are gathered to- 
gether. They gave examples of the dependence of each upon others 
for health protection, as in the case of epidemics. They derived 
from this the need for codperation in the interest of health. They 
illustrated such coédperation in the home and in the school, and men- 
tioned rules that necessarily exist in home and school for health 
protection. They gave examples of neighborhood codéperation for 
health protection, such as combined efforts for clean yards, alleys, 
and streets. After observation and inquiry they reported on actual 
menaces to health in their own city, and made the logical deduction 
regarding the necessity for codperation on the part of the entire city 
to avoid these dangers or to remove them. This raised the question 
as to whether the city did so codperate, and led to a thorough dis- 
cussion of how the city government provides the means for such 
codperation. They went into detail in regard to how the department 
of health insures pure water for the use of each family, provides for 
the removal of garbage from their back doors, and prevents the 
spread of contagious diseases. This brought under review the regu- 
lations (laws, ordinances) bearing on these matters, the activities of 
the various health officers, and how these are supervised by the board
-P-A-G-E-548
  532 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
of health. The relation of the latter to the people was discussed, and 
also the responsibility of each citizen for codperation with the board 
of health for the health of the community. 
In a discussion of the various duties of the board of health, one 
boy asserted that “it passes pure-food laws.” Another at once ob- 
jected, ‘No, it is the national government that makes the pure-food 
laws.” At once the horizon was broadened, the question why the 
national government acts in a case like this was discussed, and the 
relation of the great packing houses (for example) to the common 
health interests of the entire nation was disclosed. This led to a 
consideration of other national health interests and of what the 
national government is doing in this field. It suggested also the 
sphere of state activity, which was in turn related to the interests 
of the individual and to the activities of the local and the general 
government. 
Principles of teaching through civic-moral discussions. 
Insight supplemented by moral beliefs and habits of action.— 
It is obvious from such examples that a high grade of civic- 
moral insight is required in order to determine the answers to 
many complex practical civic-moral problems, and that such in- 
struction as we described in the earlier chapters on social insight 
and. problem-solving has very large civic-moral value. This 
instruction needs supplementing, however, in the two directions 
of belief and action which we indicated (under rule 7, p. 528) 
in discussing moral instruction through literature. If we sum- 
marize, then, the general impressions concerning civic-moral 
insight, belief, and action toward which our examples of moral 
instruction through discussion have been leading us, we may 
formulate the four following rules: 
1. Give pupils an extensive knowledge of the intricate inter- 
dependence of human beings and of the forms of individual and 
group behavior that increase the happiness of the multitudes 
(as described in Chapter IX).

2. Give them skill in correctly solving civic-moral problems by 
practice in problem-solving in school (as described in Chapter X). 
3. Cultivate in them enthusiastic, impelling beliefs in correct 
behavior and dislike of wrong behavior. 
4. Give them opportunities to turn their beliefs into habits of 
action through actual practical behavior in and out of school. 
Conclusion of Section I (on examples).—This concludes 
our first section, in which we have presented about ten examples 
of methods used in organizing civic-moral training. These ex- 
amples we divided into two groups, as follows : 
A, Examples of training through actual behavior, including a 
seventh grade overcoming cheating, a first grade learning re- 
sponsibility, a fifth grade assisting the community in a campaign 
against the tussock moth, Boy Scouts practicing ‘“man-sized 
stunts for kids,” and schools using score cards for rating the 
civic-moral qualities of pupils. 
B. Examples of civic-moral instruction through discussions, 
including literature lessons about Scrooge’s stinginess and Sir 
Galahad’s knightly qualities, biographical lessons about Steven- 
son’s cheerfulness, and a civics lesson about public health. 
In noting the general principles and rules of teaching illus- 
trated by these examples, we came to use such psychological 
terminology as “insight and understanding,” “skill in problem- 
solving,” “impelling beliefs,” “habits of action,” etc. Hence in 
order to give us a clearer basis for our evaluation of such examples 
of civic-moral training, we shall devote Section II to a discussion 
of certain of the psychological aspects of the making of character. 
Section II. PsycuozocicaL Factors IN THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF CHARACTER 
Two component parts of character: instinctive and ac- 
quired.—An individual’s character consists of two sets of 
characteristics: (1) those that are instinctive and (2) those 
that are acquired. The instinctive characteristics are inborn,
-P-A-G-E-550
534. TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
or native. The acquired characteristics are the results of ex- 
perience, including school education. In our efforts to change 
or develop the moral character of any pupil we should start 
our plans with a knowledge of what his particular inborn 
characteristics are, and then try to direct and modify these to 
the extent that scientific studies have shown to be possible 
and desirable. 
A. The Instinctive Elements in Character 
Measure your own instincts.—In order to make these ab- 
stract propositions more concrete let us examine a list of the 
human instincts that are obviously important in judging any 
pupil’s inborn character. As you read each one you might judge 
the part it plays in your own character (which you probably 
know rather well) and in the characters of some of your friends. 
For example, in the case of the instinct of pugnacity, you might 
ask: ‘Am I very pugnacious by nature? How do I compare 
with Scrappy Bill, who goes around with a chip on his shoulder, 
always looking for a fight? Or how do I compare with timid 
little Susie, who is so lacking in pugnacity that she seldom re- 
sists any affront but lives on peaceful terms with the most 
aggressive tormentor?” You might proceed thus with each of 
the following instinctive elements in the characters of yourself 
and your acquaintances. 
A list of a few select instincts important in civic-moral be- 
havior.—From the long list of human instincts we shall select 
a few whose influence in determining moral or immoral social 
behavior is very profound. As you read each, therefore, you 
may not only think of the part it plays in individual characters 
that you know but also how it is related to crime and selfish- 
ness, on the one hand, or to virtue and altruism and social 
betterment, on the other. 
1. The hunting instinct. This inborn characteristic of human 
beings Thorndike describes as “the natural tendency to pursue
-P-A-G-E-551
  CIVIC-MORAL IDEALS AND EFFICIENCY 535 
and pounce upon moving or escaping objects that are of mod- 
erate size and not of offensive mien. In seizing the chased 
object, man is likely to throw himself upon it, bear it to the 
ground, choke and maul it until it is completely subdued, giving 
then a cry of triumph.” Under savage conditions the value of 
such behavior as a means of procuring food is obvious. Under 
civilized conditions, however, this value largely disappears, as 
brought out by Thorndike in the following quotation: 
The presence of this tendency in man’s nature under the condi- 
tions of civilized life gets him little food and much trouble. There 
being no wild animals to pursue, catch, and torment into submission 
or death, household pets, young and timid children, or even aunts, 
governesses, or nursemaids, if sufficiently yielding, provoke the 
responses from the young. The older indulge the propensity at great 
cost of time and money in hunting beasts, or at still greater cost 
of manhood in hounding Quakers, abolitionists, Jews, Chinamen, 
scabs, prophets, or suffragettes of the nonmilitant variety. Teasing, 
bullying, cruelty, are thus in part the results of one of nature’s 
means of providing self and family with food, and what grew up as 
a pillar of human self-support has become so extravagant a luxury as 
to be almost a vice. (136: 19) 
2. The seize-and-keep instinct. A simple example of this in- 
stinct is found in the bulldog’s ferocious grip on something that 
it seizes in its mouth. Among children it early manifests itself 
in the tendency to reach for any object, to resist efforts of others 
to take the object away, and to become angry and cry when for- 
cibly deprived of it. This instinct frequently impels selfishness 
and stealing. It is closely related to the complex instinct of 
ownership which motivates so many useful social activities. 
3. The fighting instinct. This complex natural tendency in 
human beings is analyzed by Thorndike into several components. 
One of these is the tendency to escape from restraint, as mani- 
fested in the behavior of a child who is being held against his 
desire, and who responds by stiffening, writhing, kicking, push- 
ing, slapping, biting, and scratching. Another is the tendency
-P-A-G-E-552
  536 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
to overcome a moving obstacle by shoving, dodging around, 
hitting, and pulling. Other components of the complex fighting 
instinct include the tendencies to counterattack, to thrash 
around when in pain, and to subdue a rival, particularly in 
courtship. Simple examples of these fighting tendencies are 
seen in the schoolyard wrestling and scrapping of boys in the 
lower grades. In social life they are manifested not only in 
physical fighting but also in political and commercial contests, 
pugnacious scientific arguments, etc. They are among the 
chief causes of survival in primitive life and of discord in 
civilized life. 
4. The instincts of mastery and submission. In describing 
these instincts Thorndike notes under the instinct of mastery the 
natural tendency to go up to an unprotesting human being, look 
him in the eye, inspect him generally, nudge or shove him, and to 
feel satisfied if he submits. Concerning the instinct of submis- 
sion he says: 
There is a [natural] tendency to respond to the situation, “the 
presence of a human being larger than oneself, of angry or mastery 
aspect,” and to blows and restraint—by submissive behavior. When 
weak from wounds, sickness or fatigue the tendency is stronger. 
The man who is bigger, who can outyell and outstare us, who can 
hit us without our hitting him, and who can keep us from moving, does 
originally extort a crestfallen, abashed physique and mind. Women 
in general are thus by original nature submissive to men in general. 
Submissive behavior is apparently not annoying when assumed as 
the instinctive response to its natural stimulus. Indeed, it is per- 
haps a common satisfier. Every human being thus tends by original 
nature to arrive at a status of mastery or submission toward every 
other human being, and even under the more intelligent customs of 
civilized life somewhat of the tendency persists in many men. 
(136: 34) 
Extreme manifestations of mastery and submission in social 
behavior are found in the naturally strong leadership exhibited 
by some persons and in the cringing following exhibited 
by others.

5. The gregarious instinct. This is the “tendency to seek 
the company of other beings rather than isolation.” A special 
manifestation of it is in convivial gatherings, mere loafing

ing. For an earlier portion of her letter see page 33 
around or running with the gang. At the same time it is an 
important stimulus to church attendance in many communities. 
6. The instinctive desire for social approval. This is the 
tendency to “feel pleased at the approval of others and to feel 
miserable upon being scorned or criticized.” It is one of the chief 
   
-P-A-G-E-554
  538 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
elements in moral control. If all persons could be led or di- 
rected so as to desire the approval of the best persons, great 
moral progress would result. The extreme individualist who 
cares nothing for the opinion of others is a troublesome person 
in any social group, be he a genius or an imbecile. 
7. The instinct of rivalry. This is the “tendency to try to 
get ahead of others that are engaged in the same activity.” The 
activity may be villainous, as in the case of greedy grabbing ; or 
virtuous, as in the case of competing teams in a Red Cross drive. 
8. The instinct of sympathy. This is the tendency “to be 
satisfied when others are happy and to be dissatisfied when 
others are wretched or in pain.” It leads to some of the finest 
activities of life, such as nursing and charitable relief. 
9. The sex instinct. This has been defined as the tendency 
to “notice, approach, and mate with members of the opposite 
sex.” It keeps the race alive and is the cause of much happy 
romancing and family life, but it also impels much unwise and 
immoral behavior. 
10. The instinct of physical activity, including manipulation, 
This manifests itself in tramping, hopping, skipping, jump- 
ing, throwing, building—in all the activities of games and 
industries. 
11. The instinct of mental activity. This is the inborn tend- 
ency to have ideas, to think, to solve problems, to control one’s 
attention. It is the basis of intellectual life, of practical plan- 
ning for remote ends, of self-control, and of reflective moral 
behavior. 
Other human instincts which we might list as having a bear- 
ing on the analysis of inborn character include fear, anger, 
motherly behavior, and the imitation of such particular forms of 
behavior as smiling, jabbering, running, etc. The eleven in- 
stincts which we have described above are sufficient to enable 
us to proceed with our discussion of the teacher’s task in be- 
ginning her plans for the development of each pupil’s character 
by first taking stock of the inborn qualities in his character.

Differences between individuals in the same instinct. Nor- 
mal distribution.—When you start to study your pupils with 
respect to any instinct such as sympathy or pugnacity or rivalry, 
you will find that some pupils are extremely strong in the char- 
acteristic in question and others extremely weak, but most of 
them possess it in a moderate degree. For example, if you 
would try to picture the strength of the instinct of rivalry in a 
group of one hundred ten-year-old boys whom you had ob- 
served intimately in their competitive games and tests on many 
occasions, you might write the name of each boy on a slip 
of paper and then arrange these slips in five piles, labeled 
as follows: 
Very Below the Moderate Above the Excessively 
weak average (average) average in strong 
inrivalry in rivalry rivalry rivalry in rivalry 
Or if you wanted to use the fighting instinct instead, you could 
follow a similar procedure after watching groups of third-grade 
boys on the playground for a long time. In the case of either 
instinct your piles of names would tend to contain something 
like the following numbers: 
3 a2 50 22 3 
Very Below Moderate, Above Excessively 
weak the average or average the average strong 
This kind of distribution is always found with any biological 
characteristic that is measured in a homogeneous group; for 
example, on page 540 is shown the distribution of the heights 
of one thousand ten-year-old boys. This form is known as the 
normal-frequency surface or normal-distribution curve. 
Knowledge of normal distribution aids teacher to plan a 
moral drive.—Knowledge of the normal distribution enables 
the teacher—when she is planning, for example, to develop 
native sympathy into habitual charity among her pupils—to 
say: “Most of these children have enough of the instinct of 
 
-P-A-G-E-556

sympathy to make it a comparatively easy task to develop 
charitable habits. A few are so excessively sympathetic that they 
will be immediately enthusiastic helpers, but there are a few

who are so lacking in natural sympathy that it’s going to be a 
hard pull to make them charitable. I’ll have to see whether 
they haven’t some other instinct in strong degree, such as 
rivalry or the desire for social approval, to which I can appeal
-P-A-G-E-557
  CIVIC-MORAL IDEALS AND EFFICIENCY 541 
so as to get them into the charity game and develop in them 
habits of giving.” 
Scoring each pupil’s instincts reveals his possibilities. —If, 
instead of regarding the group as a whole, the teacher gets to 
pondering, in the long watches of the night, the problem of 
developing the civic-moral character of any particular pupil, 
she could, as her first step, score him, as it were, in several of 
the more influential instincts. For example, a boy might be 
found to have these qualities: 
Pugnacity —average 
Submission—average 
Gregariousness— excessive 
Desire for approval—above the average 
Rivalry—excessive 
Physical activity—excessive 
Mental activity—very weak 
This youngster’s gregariousness plus his other strong and 
weak qualities would lead him to “run with the gang” and do 
vigorously all the physical “stunts” that the gang leaders pro- 
posed and the gang esteemed. If it were a Y.M.C.A. gang, 
the boy’s instincts might easily lead him into good citizenship ; 
but if it were a truant gang, fond of robbing stores and delivery 
wagons, they might early land him in jail. I regret that space 
does not permit us further examples of the game of scoring 
pupils’ instinctive characteristics. It may become quite fas- 
cinating to you if you are interested in human nature. In any 
case it is the first step to take in making plans for developing 
any pupil’s character. 
Specialized vocations demand different instinctive combina- 
tions.—Another line of thought that the teacher may pursue in 
her plans for character development for pupils is to picture to 
herself the social needs for different types of characters, such 
as the sympathetic nurse, the pugnacious soldier, the masterful 
executive leader, the submissive willing subordinate, the writer
-P-A-G-E-558
  ‘542 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
of romantic verses, etc. When the teacher understands clearly 
these varied social needs, she can foresee more clearly the pos- 
sibilities for useful civic-moral development in each of the varied 
personalities whose instinctive reactions she has a chance to 
stimulate and direct. 
Encouraging the good and inhibiting the bad impulses.— 
One of the best statements concerning the general problem of 
encouraging and inhibiting instincts in the making of character 
is the following by E. L. Thorndike, one of our leading American 
authorities on the educational aspects of instinctive behavior. 
Harmful instincts . . . are weakened or inhibited (1) by disuse 
(that is, by depriving them of exercise, by not allowing the situations 
which evoke them to appear), (2) by substitution (that is, by form- 
ing the habit of meeting the situation in some other way), and (3) by 
punishment. Thus the tendency of a child to chase and torment 
a kitten may be inhibited by giving the child no kitten to play with, 
or by teaching him early to stroke and feed the kitten, or by punish- 
ing him in case he does pull its tail and throw stones at it. 
Disuse is convenient and is an excellent method to employ when 
the harmful tendency is transitory, but it is never quite sure. Punish- 
ment is ineffective in the case of very strong instincts. To be of 
service in any case, it must be so administered as to connect the 
discomfort closely with the harmful act. Substitution is in most 
cases by far the best method for the teacher’s use. Habits of care 
for pets are the best preventive of cruelty to animals; to divide a 
class into two groups and give marks to the groups instead of to indi- 
viduals—to substitute, that is, team emulation for individual emu- 
lation—may be the best cure for selfish ambition and envy; for a 
restless class, manual work is better than scolding. 
Some instincts apparently injurious may have bound up with them 
valuable traits of intellect and character, and consequently may require 
encouragement and especially redirection. The annoying questioning 
by very young children is part and parcel of a general intellectual 
impulse that is a chief source of mental growth; the disobedience and 
defiance of boys in their teens, often very troublesome to school and 
family life, is to some extent at least a necessary accompaniment of 
the general instinct of independence and mastery which comes at 
 
-P-A-G-E-559
CIVIC-MORAL IDEALS AND EFFICIENCY 543 
adolescence and which is essential to vigorous manhood ; awkward- 
ness and lack of courtesy may be necessary features of a modesty 
which would suffer if they were artificially overcome. (18a: 23) 
B. The Acquired Components of Civic-Moral Character 
Habits, insight, beliefs.—If now we turn our attention from 
the inborn components of civic-moral character to those that are 
acquired through experience, we find the latter consisting of 
three types: (1) habits of civic-moral behavior ; (2) insight into 
social relations, including ideas of right and wrong ; (3) dynamic 
beliefs, interests, and enthusiasms. We shall take up each of 
these for brief consideration. 
1. Habits of civic-moral behavior. Specific detailed habits 
in animals and children.—Specific habits, well automatized, 
are among the simplest and most primitive of the acquired ele- 
ments in moral character and behavior. Even animals may be 
taught simple habits that seem to make them better residents 
in a community. For example, dogs may be taught to keep 
out of the house and to refrain from barking at strangers. 
Children, by much practice, may be trained to brush their teeth 
habitually every night before retiring. The civic-moral value 
of this habit is obvious. It not only makes the person more 
attractive and less disagreeable in company but through con- 
tributing to his general health keeps him in a better humor and 
makes him socially more efficient. 
Role of specific habits illustrated in moral training of the 
feeble-minded.—In the development of the moral characters of 
the feeble-minded we find one of the clearest examples of the 
special function of specific habits in moral training, since these 
unfortunates are frequently unable to control their lives by 
civic-moral ideas. The following quotation from Leta Holling- 
worth brings out this point very clearly: 
Can the school do anything to instill morals in the mentally defec- 
tive children? Can the school aid at all in preventing the crimes 
and misdemeanors which they commit as children and adults? 
   
-P-A-G-E-560
    
544 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
Improvement takes place in the feeble-minded . . . only through 
the formation of specific habits. 
If it were possible for the school to foresee and reproduce every 
situation involving instinct to which the defective would have to 
respond in the course of life, and could by repetition connect perma- 
nently the desired response with each situation, it might insure 
morals just as it can insure skill. This being utterly impossible, the 
school can only select certain general situations, and strive to con- 
nect the desired response with each, by many repetitions. To the 
situation “a dumb animal” it may strive to attach the response “be 
kind”; to the situation “an object that is not mine” it may strive 
to attach the response “don’t take it”; to the situation “being an- 
gry” it may strive to attach the response “don’t strike.” 
The difficulty always is that the very limited intelligence is usually 
not capable of even this amount of generalization. The instruction 
tends to degenerate in the mind of the instructed into the much more 
concrete situation “being angry at Johnny” and the response “don’t 
hit Aim,” without affecting relations with Tom or Joe or with people 
at whom he will be angry ten years after leaving school. (15: 168) 
Extensive réle of habits in adult life. Emphasis by William 
James.—It is not only in the lives of domestic animals, children, 
and the feeble-minded, however, that good civic-moral habits 
are important. Throughout life they are essential components 
of a good character and of good behavior. In the life of adults 
such valuable semiautomatic behavior may range from such 
simple matters as brushing the teeth, which we used to illustrate 
habits in childhood, to such large civic habits as keeping one’s 
name on the registration books and voting at all elections. In 
America some very noted chapters on habit by William James, 
our greatest American psychologist and philosopher, have served 
to popularize the psychological view of the importance of habit. 
These chapters are frequently made the basis of moral sermons 
by churchmen and educators. The chapter in his “Talks to 
Teachers” emphasizes the role of habit in the following terms: 
It is very important that teachers should realize the importance 
of habit, and psychology helps us greatly at this point. We speak,
-P-A-G-E-561
CIVIC-MORAL IDEALS AND EFFICIENCY 545 
it is true, of good habits and of bad habits, but when people use the 
word “habit,” in the majority of instances it is a bad habit which 
they have in mind. They talk of the smoking-habit and the swearing- 
habit and the drinking-habit, but not of the abstention-habit or the 
moderation-habit or the courage-habit. (10: 64) 
So far as we are thus mere bundles of habit, we are stereotyped 
creatures, imitators and copiers of our past selves. And since this, 
under any circumstances, is what we always tend to become, it fol- 
lows first of all that the teacher’s prime concern should be to ingrain 
into the pupil that assortment of habits that shall be most useful to 
him throughout life. (10: 66) 
Rules for habit formation: (1) interest, (2) frequent oppor- 
tunities, (3) no exceptions.—The important rules to follow in 
cultivating civic-moral habits in pupils might well be derived 
from a careful study of the five examples of civic-moral training 
through actual behavior with which we opened this chapter. Per- 
haps the three most important of these rules, which we saw well 
illustrated in Miss McGuire’s eighth-grade drive on cheating 
and in Miss Hardy’s first-grade teaching of responsibility, are 
the following: (1) appeal to, arouse, and build upon the pupils’ 
instinctive tendencies and interests; (2) give many and fre- 
quent opportunities for practicing the new habit; (3) permit 
no exceptions, but by firm, good-natured reminders hold the 
children to the new form of behavior until it is ingrained in 
their characters. As James says, 
Lie in wait . . . for the practical opportunities, be prompt to seize 
these as they pass, and thus at one operation get your pupils . . . to 
think, to feel, and to do. The strokes of behavior are what give the 
new set to the character and work the good habits into its organic 
tissue. (10: 71) 
2. Insight into social relations.—The second division of the 
acquired components of civic-moral character we styled “insight 
into. social relations, including ideas of right and wrong.” 
Methods of giving sympathetic insight into social relations. 
—lIn our chapter on understanding social life, we described at 
 
-P-A-G-E-562
  546 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
length the methods used in a progressive elementary school to 
give pupils clear ideas of social needs, relations, processes, etc. 
Furthermore, in Section I of the present chapter (pp. 530-533) 
we indicated how necessary such instruction ‘is in order that 
pupils may make intelligent moral decisions and behave wisely 
in our complex society of today. 
Impulsive, inhibitive, and guiding power of ideas. Described 
by James.—In view of these elaborate preceding discussions 
we shall merely indicate here the great esteem attached by 
such psychologists as James to the influence of correct moral 
ideas when these are kept clearly before the mind. The following 
quotations from his chapter on “The Will” in his “Talks to 
Teachers” express this fact. Let us begin where he gives a 
concrete example. He says: 
I am lying in bed . . . and think it is time to get up; but along- 
side of this thought there is present to my mind a realization of the 
extreme coldness of the morning and the pleasantness of the warm 
bed. In such a situation the motor consequences of the first idea are 
blocked, and I may remain for half an hour or more with the two 
ideas oscillating before me in a kind of deadlock, which is what we 
call the state of hesitation or deliberation. In a case like this the 
deliberation can be resolved and the decision reached in either of 
two ways: 
1. I may forget for a moment the thermometric conditions, and 
then the idea of getting up will immediately discharge into act; I 
shall suddenly find that I have got up—or 
2. Still mindful of the freezing temperature, the thought of the 
duty of rising may become so pungent that it determines action in 
spite of inhibition. In the latter case I have a sense of energetic 
moral effort, and consider that I have done a virtuous act. 
The interesting thing to note is the extreme delicacy of the in- 
hibitive machinery. A strong and urgent motor idea in the focus 
may be neutralized and made inoperative by the presence of the very 
faintest contradictory idea in the margin. For instance, I hold out 
my forefinger, and with closed eyes try to realize as vividly as pos- 
sible that I hold a revolver in my hand and am pulling the trigger. 
I can even now fairly feel my finger quivering with the tendency-to
-P-A-G-E-563
  CIVIC-MORAL IDEALS AND EFFICIENCY 547 
contract ; and if it were hitched to a recording apparatus, it would 
certainly betray its state of tension by registering incipient move- 
ments. Yet it does not actually crook, and the movement of pulling 
the trigger is not performed. Why not? Simply because, all con- 
centrated though I am upon the idea of the movement, I neverthe- 
less also realize the total conditions of the experiment, and in the 
back of my mind, so to speak, or in its fringe and margin, have the 
simultaneous idea that the movement is not to take place. The mere 
presence of that marginal intention, without effort, urgency, or em- 
phasis, or any special reénforcement from my attention, suffices [for] 
the inhibitive effect. (10: 174-176) 
Relation of habitual to deliberative social behavior.—James 
then couples this discussion of the influence of ideas with his 
earlier discussion of habits which we quoted above, by showing 
how certain ideas become in us habitually the forerunners of 
certain forms of action. For example, in the confirmed Republi- 
can voter the idea “He is a Republican” has become the habitual 
forerunner of approving remarks concerning Republican candi- 
dates and of acts of marking crosses before the names of such 
candidates on the ballot. However, if a personal enemy of the 
voter should happen to be a candidate, the voter finds himself in 
a conflict beween two sets or habits. In coupling his discussions 
of habits and of ideas as related to such dilemmas, James says: 
How is it when an alternative is presented to you for choice and 
you are uncertain what you ought to do? You first hesitate and then 
you deliberate. And in what does your deliberation consist? It con- 
sists in trying to apperceive the case successively by a number of 
different ideas, which seem to fit it more or less, until at last you 
hit on one which seems to fit it exactly. If that be an idea which 
is a customary forerunner of action in you, which enters into one 
of your maxims of positive behavior, your hesitation ceases and you 
act immediately. If, on the other hand, it be an idea which carries 
inaction as its habitual result, if it ally itself with prohibition, then 
you unhesitatingly refrain. The problem is, you see, to find the 
right idea or conception for the case. This search for the right con- 
ception may take days or weeks. (10: 184-185)
-P-A-G-E-564
  548 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
Moral discrimination trained in problem-solving exercises.— 
Thus we see the importance of the practice in deliberate, reflec- 
tive thinking concerning social relations which we described in 
Chapters IX and X and reviewed on pages 531 and 533 of the 
first section of this chapter. 
Controlled attention essential in difficult moral situations.— 
Finally, James emphasizes the importance of our efforts of atten- 
tion in holding firmly before ourselves the correct, helpful ideas 
of what to do in spite of the attractiveness of counteracting ones. 
3. Dynamic beliefs, interests, and enthusiasms. I/lustrated 
in Roosevelt.—Our third division of the acquired components 
of character we have labeled “dynamic beliefs, interests, and 
enthusiasms.” We may illustrate the presence of such factors in 
a person’s character by the life and temperament of Theodore 
Roosevelt, who impressed himself to an unusual degree upon his 
generation through the intensity of his beliefs, the breadth of his 
civic-moral interests, and the vigor of his enthusiasms. More- 
over, he did not sit quietly by and merely feel intensely his be- 
liefs and interests and enthusiasms, but he acted vigorously and 
consistently along the lines which they prompted. In this respect 
he illustrated our adjective “dynamic,” which, as the opposite of 
“static,” suggests vigorous action. 
Psychological composition. Inborn drives associated with 
acquired ideas and habits—The psychological composition of 
such beliefs, interests, and enthusiasms is more complex than 
in the case of the other acquired components of character; 
namely, habits and ideas. It is obvious that inborn, instinctive 
characteristics play an important part in a perscn’s interests ; 
thus, Roosevelt was by inborn nature intense, many-sided, vig- 
orous, and enthusiastic. On the other hand, the particular 
directions that his beliefs, interests, and enthusiasms took were 
clearly acquired. Thus he was always keenly interested in cow- 
boy life. Why? Because he had acquired a cowboy interest 
and enthusiasm while living for many years on ranches in 
the West.
-P-A-G-E-565
CIVIC-MORAL IDEALS AND EFFICIENCY 549 
Intensification by inspirational devices.—Not only may the 
particular directions taken by one’s beliefs and interest be de- 
termined by experience, including education, but these beliefs, 
interests, and enthusiasms may be intensified in any pupil’s 
character by using appropriate inspirational devices in the 
family, the school, the church, or in society at large. In the 
church the art of sermonizing has been studied for centuries in 
order to perfect its technique for converting young and old and 
for rendering beliefs so strong that a communicant will never 
stray. In politics oratory was especially perfected by the Romans, 
and notable scientific treatises were written upon the art by such 
great orators as Cicero. Many high-school pupils know the ora- 
tion of Mark Antony in Shakespeare’s “Julius Cesar” as an 
example of the Roman skill in converting and convincing an 
audience and arousing it to vigorous action. Intense patriotic 
action is commonly stimulated in times of national crises by 
special devices of propaganda and inspiration, with which we 
all became familiar during the World War. It is in the need for 
such inspiration that we find the justification for much of the 
use of literature in teaching morals, since great literary artists 
have frequently used their expressional talents in formulating 
a moral message in a convincing, gripping manner which stimu- 
lates belief, interest, and enthusiastic action. The teacher who 
can take a coldly scientific moral truth and warm it up by 
devices that impel belief and conduct is engaged in an artistic 
activity to whose perfecting the greatest preachers, orators, and 
poets have devoted their best energies. 
Technique for each should be described.—If we knew just 
what to say, it would be desirable to write about the devices to 
be used in the case of beliefs or strong convictions, in the case 
of interests, and in the case of enthusiasms. Doubtless we could 
find many suggestions if we examined the Roman writings on 
oratory, churchly works on sermonizing (or homiletics), etc. 
We shall have to confine ourselves, however, to a few remarks 
about each of these psychological stimuli to virtuous action.
-P-A-G-E-566
  550 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
Beliefs. Historic réle illustrated by the Ten Commandments. 
—The influence of negative beliefs is illustrated in the behavior 
of the person who says, “I don’t believe in gambling” and con- 
sistently avoids anything that savors of that vice. Sometimes 
this belief is rational; that is, the person understands what 
social troubles are caused by gambling and consequently avoids 
it. At other times the belief is merely the result of a habitual 
prohibition learned in church. As an example of the influence 
of a positive belief we have the behavior of the person who says, 
“T believe in being loyal to one’s job, putting in one’s best licks 
all the time, whether the boss is looking or not, and doing more 
than one is paid for.” If we go into the religious field we find 
the enormous moral influence which has been exerted by belief 
in the Ten Commandments—belief that is sometimes moti- 
vated by fear, sometimes by habit, and sometimes by a rational 
enthusiasm for the social improvement that these rules of con- 
duct have stimulated among many historic peoples and among 
many social groups of today. 
Correct, many-sided interests. An aid to virtue.—The con- 
nection between virtuous behavior and correct, many-sided 
interests is so close that Herbart (1776-1841), a great and 
influential German writer on education, considered interest to 
be the one surest means of attaining virtue, as brought out in 
the following quotation: 
The ultimate purpose of instruction is contained in the notion, 
virtue. But in order to realize the final aim, another and nearer one 
must be set up. We may term it many-sidedness of interest. The 
word “interest” stands in general for that kind of mental activity 
which it is the business of instruction to incite. Mere informa- 
tion does not suffice, for this we think of as a supply, or store, of 
facts which a person might possess or lack and still remain the same 
being. But he who lays hold of his information and reaches out for 
more takes an interest in it. Since, however, this mental activity is 
varied, we need to add the qualification supplied by the term 
““many-sidedness.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-567
CIVIC-MORAL IDEALS AND EFFICIENCY 551 
Enthusiasms. Characteristic of dynamic leaders.— Finally, 
the réle of enthusiasm in contributing to active civic virtue is 
easily recognized in dynamic social leaders such as Roosevelt. 
One of my colleagues -has a somewhat similar personality and 
has been appropriately characterized as an “enthusiast” by an 
eminent psychologist and friend. When this enthusiast gets 
behind any movement it takes on vigorous life, and people begin 
to notice it and flock to join it. Such enthusiasm is not merely 
sentimental bubbling, however, but consists primarily of vigor- 
ous action by the enthusiast—action that inspires interest and 
belief and, through imitation and contagion, stimulates similar 
action in others. 
Summary of psychological factors.—This concludes our 
general discussion of the psychological factors in character- 
building. Under the head of (A) instinctive characteristics, we 
noted the part played by eleven particular instincts, the differ- 
ences between individuals in respect to each instinct, and the 
consequent necessity of taking stock of each pupil’s peculiar 
combination of instinctive tendencies as the first step in plan- 
ning to develop his character further. Under the head of (B) 
acquired characteristics, we considered (1) specific civic-moral 
habits which may be formed even by persons of low-grade in- 
telligence; (2) civic-moral insight, which, in our present com- 
plicated society, calls for very elaborate knowledge and for 
skill in the reflective solution of civic-moral problems; and 
(3) dynamic beliefs, interests, and enthusiasms which impel to 
many-sided, vigorous, virtuous action. 
Complexity of the problem of civic-moral training re- 
vealed.—Such a psychological study reveals the complexity of 
the problem of developing the civic-moral characters of any 
group of forty or fifty pupils with whom a teacher may be con- 
fronted. In the primary grades these pupils will range from 
imbeciles who can scarcely comprehend any moral ideas, to 
intelligent, virtuous youngsters who readily appreciate very 
subtle aspects of social relations. Only in the case of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-568
  552. TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
feeble-minded have we much scientific evidence concerning 
their moral possibilities and training. For this reason, and be- 
cause this scientific knowledge will relieve many conscientious 
teachers from worrying about their failures in training these 
unfortunates, we shall devote a number of pages to a discussion 
of the scientific evidence relating to the civic-moral training of 
the feeble-minded. 
C. Special Application to the Feeble-minded 
Réle of habits, intelligence, and instincts.—The scientific 
studies of feeble-minded persons have revealed very clearly the 
part played in their behavior by habits, intelligence, and in- 
stincts. The great importance of specific habits in their train- 
ing has already been mentioned earlier in the chapter (p. 543). 
We shall now consider the influence of their intelligence and 
instincts upon their conduct. 
Réle of intelligence in feeble-minded behavior. Example 
illustrating failure to comprehend social relations.—The civic- 
moral problem presented by the poor intelligence of a feeble- 
minded person may be illustrated by the following example of 
an imbecile prisoner who had been arrested for breaking into a 
freight car in winter in search of shelter. Although only thirty- 
five years of age he had already been committed to the work- 
house or penitentiary eight times. He had the mental ability 
of an average child of about six years, as illustrated by the 
following conversation which took place in a room of the 
observation ward : 
Examiner. What place is this? 
Prisoner. A room. 
Q. What kind of room? 
A. A big room. 
Q. Why were you sent here? 
A. Judge said I’d be well took care of here. 
Q. How did you get before the judge? 
A. I was in Bronx Park. Little drunk.

Feeble-minded easily made the tools of intelligent criminals. 
—lIt is obvious from this examination that this imbecile is not 
only incapable of understanding the real purposes of prison but 
could readily be made to agree to almost any suggestion and 
would easily be made the dupe and tool of more intelligent 
criminals. 
Intelligence tests reveal and measure mental deficiency.—In 
order to assist public authorities to discover, grade, and diagnose 
cases of feeble-mindedness, intelligence tests were especially de- 
vised for this purpose. The most notable ones are those which 
were developed in France by Binet (Béé na’), about 1911, and 
adapted and improved in this country by Goddard and Ter- 
man. They have been given not only to feeble-minded but also 
to thousands of normal children, from whose records the aver- 
age scores for children of each age have been ascertained. From 
these average scores of normal children it is possible to deter- 
mine precisely how far below the average intelligence for his 
age any particular feeble-minded child falls who has been given 
the tests. He may be actually (or chronologically) ten years of 
age but make a score equal only to the average of five-year-olds.
-P-A-G-E-570
  554 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
In this case he would be said to have a chronological age of 
ten years but a mental age of five years; that is, his mental 
age is only 50 per cent of his chronological age. This figure, 
which is obtained by dividing a person’s mental age by his 
chronological age, is called his intelligence quotient, or I. Q. 
In the case of average children the chronological age equals the 
mental age; hence their I. Q’s are approximately roo per cent. 
In the case of a child whose chronological age is ten years but 
mental age : 
chronological age 
is 42, giving an I. Q. of 120 per cent. To simplify reference 
to these figures the term “per cent” is dropped, and a person 
is spoken of as having an I. Q. of 50 or 100 or 120, as the 
case may be. 
Precise meaning of “‘feeble-minded” and of “idiot,” “im- 
becile,” and “moron.” —By using the facts about mental ages 
which these tests reveal, it is becoming possible to attach quite 
a precise meaning to the term “feeble-minded” and the three 
subordinate terms— “idiots,” “‘imbeciles,” and “morons.” These 
precise meanings are suggested by the very convenient table 
from H. H. Goddard’s “Feeble-mindedness: its Causes and 
Consequences,” given on page 555. In the right-hand column 
you will find the terms “idiot,” “imbecile,” and “moron,” and 
in the left-hand column the mental ages which these unfortu- 
nates may eventually attain. Thus a low-grade idiot never 
exceeds the mental age of average children under one year of 
age, while a high-grade moron (according to Goddard’s classi- 
fication) will never grow beyond the mental ability of average 
normal children of twelve. All these classes, from low-grade 
idiot to high-grade moron, are known as feeble-minded. In the whose mental age is twelve, the quotient, 
1Slight variations from the age limits given by Goddard are indicated by 
Terman, who says, “The adult idiot would range up to about three-year 
intelligence, . . . the adult imbecile would have a mental level between three 
and seven years, and the adult moron would range from about seven-year 
intelligence to eleven-year intelligence.” (16: 79)

INDUSTRIAL CLASSIFICATION 
Conclusion concerning incompetence to comprehend civic- 
moral ideas. —From such facts as we have given you can infer 
the civic-moral possibilities of the feeble-minded as far as these 
are determined by native intelligence, or ability to comprehend 
ideas, and by industrial possibilities. Thus our example of the 
prisoner who was examined showed us the case of an imbecile 
criminal of thirty-five years of age with a mental age of about 
six years, unable to comprehend the purposes of prisons in which 
he had been incarcerated eight times, but capable, according to
-P-A-G-E-572
556 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
Goddard’s table, of learning such routine manual tasks as wash- 
ing dishes. As an illustration of the civic-moral possibilities of 
a high-grade moron with a mental age of twelve, we may quote 
Goddard’s statement that such a person could learn to run an 
elevator but should not be trusted to do so. In order, now, to 
gain an understanding of the woeful possibilities of these low- 
grade intellects when their instincts prompt them to immoral 
acts, we shall turn our attention to the part played by instincts 
in the moral characters and behavior of the feeble-minded. 
Instincts in the behavior of the feeble-minded. Examples 
of failure to restrict native impulses.—In our discussion of the 
instinctive components of character on pages 535 ff. we indi- 
cated how the fighting and sex instincts and the instinct to seize 
and keep, while they serve certain useful purposes when intel- 
ligently directed, may become the source of much social discord 
and immoral behavior. From a feeble-minded person in whom 
these instincts are especially strong we may consequently expect 
much immoral and criminal behavior, owing to the lack of 
intelligent inhibition by correct ideas of social relations. Below 
are examples of this type of uninhibited immoral behavior: 
The following is the verbatim story of a woman thirty-four years 
old with a mental age of six years and six months,—an inmate of an - 
institution for the feeble-minded. She appeared before the examiner 
with a blackened and swollen eye, and the following conversation 
took place : 
Question. How did you get that black eye? 
Answer. You know we have chicken for dinner on Sunday, and 
I took that girl’s chicken away from her plate. So she pulled my 
hair first and she knocked me on the floor, and she landed on my 
stomach, too. But I give it to her back, though. I pulled her hair. 
That’s all. See, that girl didn’t want me to do it. And then I went 
up to wash my hands, because they was all greasy from holding on 
to the chicken. She didn’t like me, that girl. 
[Another case of the same sort concerns] a feeble-minded girl 
fifteen years of age, also an inmate of an institution, who appeared 
with a black eye.
-P-A-G-E-573
CIVIC-MORAL IDEALS AND EFFICIENCY 557 
Question. How did you get that black eye? 
Answer. (After a sulky silence) Well, there’s a girl and she called 
me a——Sheeney, and I called it to her back a guinea, and 
she hit me in the eye, and I hit her in the nose. (15: 159)   
Instincts involved. Pugnacity, resentment at being thwarted 
or scorned, etc.—In commenting on these cases Hollingworth 
indicates that the instinctive tendencies to fight and to resist 
having something taken away from one are involved in the first 
example; while, in connection with the second case, she says, 
“Fighting and assault, and at times murder, may be motivated 
by resentment at being scorned.” Concerning the influence of 
the instinctive tendency to be angry when thwarted in the pur- 
suit of a desired end, she says: 
Fighting, assault, and murder result, in the majority of [feeble- 
minded] cases, from anger at being thwarted. [Thus] a boy thirteen 
years [old], with a mental age of eight years, drew a knife on the 
teacher [who had] reproved him for something he had undertaken 
and had asked him to stop. He had been placed with this teacher, 
who was a good disciplinarian, because he had thrown a heavy flower- 
pot at his former teacher, when thwarted in some act. He remained 
good-natured and grinning so long as he was permitted to have his 
own way. (15: 158) 
Crimes of feeble-minded impelled by instincts of acquisitive- 
ness, pugnacity, and sex.—These incidents serve to put us in 
the general atmosphere of the immoral and criminal acts of the 
feeble-minded. As indicating in general the instincts that are 
concerned in such cases, Hollingworth states that the crimes of 
ninety-eight feeble-minded offenders committed to Sing Sing 
Prison had been classified as follows, on the basis of the instincts 
that impelled the crimes: 
Crimes which had their impulse in the instinct to take things, 58. 
Crimes which had their impulse in the instinct of pugnacity, 26. 
Crimes which had their impulse in the sex instinct, 13.

-P-A-G-E-574
    558 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
Instinctive impulses not sole explanation of feeble-minded 
immorality.— However, the feeble-minded person’s immoral be- 
havior is not due merely to the presence of certain strong in- 
stincts such as acquisitiveness, pugnacity, and the sex impulses, 
since we can readily prove that these instincts are equally strong 
in many well-behaved persons. For example, some of our great- 
est social leaders are strong fighters, and our greatest financiers 
are characterized strongly by the instinct to acquire more and 
more wealth. Furthermore, says Hollingworth: 
Of the instincts which do not ordinarily lead to crime, such as the 
tendency to feel pleased at the approval of others, and the tendency 
to be satisfied by seeing others comfortable and happy, there is every 
reason to suppose that these are as well developed in the subnormal 
as are the instincts which lead more readily into difficulty. Mentally 
deficient children are as susceptible as others to nods and pats of 
approval, to smiles, praise, and rewards, and their affection attaches 
as readily to those who win their confidence. (15: 164) 
Lack of inhibition by ideas that give grasp of social relations. 
—The reason why the strong instincts of acquisitiveness, pug- 
nacity, and sex operate so banefully in the feeble-minded is 
because they are not checked or inhibited by ideas that give an 
intelligent grasp of social relations. In order to see the seri- 
ous consequences to society we shall turn our attention to 
certain social effects resulting from the inheritance of feeble- 
mindedness.* 
1Qne of the best accounts of the inheritance of feeble-mindedness is 
H. H. Goddard’s study entitled ‘“‘Feeble-mindedness: its Causes and its 
Consequences,” in which he reports an investigation of the life histories of 
three hundred feeble-minded persons. He concludes that the feeble-minded 
condition was clearly due to heredity in 54 per cent of the cases, and 
probably due to heredity in 11.3 per cent. His summary of the causes is 
as follows: 
Clearly due to heredity, 54 per cent. 
Probably due to heredity, 11.3 per cent. 
Ancestry showing brain diseases, 12 per cent. 
Due to accident, 19 per cent, 
Unexplained, 2.6 per cent.

Heredity in feeble-minded. Enormous cost of descendants 
to society.—The relation of inherited feeble-mindedness to 
“crime, pauperism, prostitution, vagrancy, illegitimacy, and all 
forms of social disorder” is most strikingly shown in the case of 
the records of certain families, such as the “Jukes,” whose an- 
cestral records have been studied in detail. In reporting one of 
these investigations Hollingworth says: 
One of the most widely known of similar studies is that of the 
Kallikaks, reported by Dr. Goddard. Martin Kallikak, a soldier in 
the Revolutionary War, had an illegitimate son by a feeble-minded 
girl whom he met in a tavern. In 1912 there were 480 traceable 
descendants of this union, 143 of whom were known as feeble-minded 
and many others of whom were of questionable mentality. The anti- 
social conduct of these descendants makes a long history. 
[On the other hand,] after his return from the war Martin Kallikak 
married a girl of good family. Of the descendants of this union 496 
individuals were traced. No feeble-minded person was found among 
them. On the contrary, lawyers, educators, traders, physicians, and 
Jandowners predominated among them, and there were no criminals. 
(15: 212) 
In the case of the Jukes family 1258 members, half of them 
feeble-minded, were living in 1915 from an original stock of five sis- 
ters who had begun to propagate their kind about one hundred and 
thirty years before. ; 
In a detailed estimate of crime, pauperism, disease, and debauch- 
ery [connected with this family] Estabrook estimates that the de- 
scendants of the five Juke sisters have cost the taxpayers of the 
communities where they have resided about $2,516,685 in money, 
aside from the trouble and contamination of which they have been 
the source. (15: 212) 
Scientific restriction of feeble-minded being developed.—Thus 
we see the woeful consequences to society of the propagation of 
feeble-minded children who lack sufficient native intelligence to 
develop ideas of social relations that will restrict the unlicensed 
action of their fighting, acquisitive, and sex instincts. Fortu- 
nately for society, scientific methods for testing and identifying
-P-A-G-E-576
  
560 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
these unfortunates are rapidly being developed, along with public 
institutions and a public sentiment that will eventually greatly 
improve the moral status of the world through restricting the 
behavior of the feeble-minded and the propagation of their stock. 
The school’s problem. Frequent presence of feeble-minded 
in lower grades.— Meanwhile the teachers in the lower grades of 
school systems that have not developed segregated, special 
classes for the feeble-minded will be confronted with numerous 
puzzling or troublesome cases of this type. Thus Hollingworth 
gives as a typical example a first grade observed in a Nebraska 
town of four thousand inhabitants. The teacher had two rows 
of these pupils far beyond first-grade age. “Some had spent 
three or four years in the room, taking the time of the teacher 
from the other pupils and disturbing the class, held there to 
tasks which were irrelevant to their needs.” In the third and 
fourth grades morons are likely to stick in considerable numbers. 
Such children, even in their intellectual education, are entailing 
an enormous waste of the teacher’s energy and the state’s money 
when they are kept with the regular classes instead of being 
placed under special instruction adapted to their peculiar needs. 
As regards the moral training of such children, if it happens that — 
their pugnacious instincts are very strong, the teacher is con- 
fronted with a task that should be assigned only to specialized 
experts in institutions or classes for the feeble-minded. 
Conclusion of discussion of civic-moral problems of 
feeble-minded.— This brings us to the end of our study of the 
psychological factors in character-making as illustrated in the 
case of the feeble-minded. I have seen fit to introduce this long 
account of this limited portion of the school population for three 
reasons: (1) because we have more objective, precise, scientific 
studies of character and character-making in the cases of the 
feeble-minded than in those of more normal pupils; (2) be- 
cause the influence of inborn qualities—instincts and native 
intelligence—upon moral character has been more definitely 
diagnosed in such cases; and (3) because such cases give the
-P-A-G-E-577
  CIVIC-MORAL IDEALS AND EFFICIENCY 561 
ordinary school so much trouble that a teacher frequently be- 
comes distraught and discouraged in her futile efforts to reform 
them morally, whereas in a well-organized school system they 
would be segregated for specialized expert teaching adapted to 
their intellectual, industrial, and moral needs and deficiencies, 
thus enabling the ordinary teacher to proceed with the more 
pleasant task of developing the characters of normal children. 
Summary of Sections I and II on practical and psycholog- 
ical aspects.—We have now completed two sections of our 
chapter on developing civic-moral ideals and efficiency. In Sec- 
tion I we gave ten examples illustrating two types of civic- 
moral training; namely, (A) training through actual behavior 
and (B) training through discussions of behavior. In Sec- 
tion II we considered the psychological components of moral 
character under two main headings: (A) instinctive inborn 
characteristics and (B) acquired characteristics. We saw under 
(A) that each pupil’s character contains a combination of im- 
‘portant instincts, such as pugnacity, sympathy, emulation, etc., 
which determine to a large extent his civic-moral behavior. 
Under (B) we saw how the acquired components of his charac- 
ter—his habits, ideas, beliefs, and interests—may determine 
the specific directions along which his instinctive impulses will 
impel him, and may inhibit instinctive behavior that is unsuited 
to civilized society. Finally, in the case of the feeble-minded 
we saw how their lack of intelligence frequently renders them 
incapable of wisely restricting their crude animal instincts, thus 
making them a moral menace to society. We noted how society, 
in order to protect itself against this menace, is developing 
intelligence tests and social practices and institutions to restrict 
the circle of activities of these unfortunate but contaminating 
individuals. In the next section of the chapter we shall see how 
democratic nations through their public schools are experiment- 
ing in developing a civic basis for moral teaching to replace the 
religious basis which the law has banished from many public 
elementary schools.

  A REPENTANT BOY’S LETTER 
In America we are all familiar with this intimate connection be- 
tween religion and morals, as exhibited in the moral teachings 
of Sunday schools and churches and in the fact that ministers 
frequently assume moral leadership in their communities. We 
are also all familiar with individuals in whom such religious- 
moral teaching has been an influence to better behavior. For 
example, yesterday, while I was working on this chapter, an 
 
-P-A-G-E-579
CIVIC-MORAL IDEALS AND EFFICIENCY 563 
unknown boy of about thirteen brought back a bag of golf 
clubs he had stolen from me two years before. He was weep- 
ing and very much agitated. I gathered from kindly ques- 
tioning about the school and Sunday School which he attended 
that some religious influence had affected him. The facsimile 
(on page 562) of the note which he had written illustrates his 
general reformed attitude. 
Strong possibilities in combination of Christian ethics and 
religious sanctions.—Not only has there been a very close 
connection between religion and morals but in the case of 
Christianity there is clear historic evidence of the beneficial in- 
fluence of combining the strong sanction and force that religion 
possesses with such a helpful, wholesome ethical code as that 
of Jesus. Hence we shall always expect to find improvement 
of morals resulting from a strong religious interest in a fine 
moral code. 
Early American public schools emphasized religion.—Fur- 
thermore, not only has there been an intimate connection be- 
tween religious and moral training in the home, the church, and 
the Sunday School but even in the week-day elementary schools 
religious instruction has frequently been prominent. Our most 
impressive American examples are found in the early schools of 
the Puritans in Massachusetts, where the General Court, or 
legislative assembly, passed in 1647 a very famous law which 
reads in part as follows: 
It being one chief point of that old deluder, Satan, to keep men 
from a knowledge of the Scriptures, as in former times, by keeping 
them in an unknown tongue, so in these latter times, by persuading 
from the use of tongues, that so at last the true sense and meaning 
of the original might be clouded by false glosses of saint-seeming 
deceivers, that learning might not be buried in the grave of our 
fathers in church and commonwealth, the Lord assisting our endeav- 
ors. It is therefore ordered that every township in this jurisdiction, 
after the Lord has increased them to the number of fifty household- 
ers, shall then forthwith appoint one within their town to teach all 
such children as shall resort to him to write and read, etc.

  CIVIC-MORAL IDEALS AND EFFICIENCY 565 
In many other American states this same religious connec- 
tion between elementary education and religion was prominent, 
so much so that as late as 1830 in some communities we find 
citizens insisting that the State had no right to concern itself 
with elementary schools—that these belonged exclusively to 
the Church. 
B. Civic-Moral Training 
Secularization of American public schools forced by sec- 
tarian religionists——As time went on, all the American states 
developed public-school systems. Frequently religious instruc- 
tion prevailed in these, especially where one religious sect pre- 
dominated strongly in the community. When the children of 
several sects attended the same school, however, those citizens 
who believed very strongly in their own particular sectarian 
teachings began to fear the contaminating influences of religious 
instruction conducted by a teacher of a different sect. Hence 
these sectarians raised objections to such teaching, and even- 
tually succeeded in eliminating religious instruction from public 
elementary schools in most states. The legal basis for this 
procedure is found in the general American theory requiring 
the separation of Church and State, and is further set down in 
state laws and constitutions. (18: 171-181) 
Specific civic-moral instruction developed recently in sec- 
ularized schools.—Thus we see how American public elemen- 
tary schools progressively dropped religious-moral instruction 
and created the necessity for the development of moral in- 
struction on a new basis. For a long time—throughout the 
nineteenth century, in fact—the schools were largely at sea 
concerning what to do. Practically the only specific moral in- 
struction that was given was through the regular discipline of 
the school and through the “morals” attached to literature les- 
sons. Since about 1900, however, very extensive and positive 
progress has been made in developing courses in community 
life and civics which provide a type of specific moral instruc-

Government bulletins depict the character of this develop- 
ment.—One of the best methods of securing a perspective

of civic-moral instruction is to purchase the following bulle-

France illustrates great national possibilities of civic- 
moral training.—To comprehend fully the vast significance 
of this movement for developing secular civic-moral instruction 
in great democracies, one must study it in France, where, since 
1882, there has been a national system of civic-moral instruction 
in secular schools, with a national course of study and a great 
variety of textbooks from which teachers may choose. In France, 
better than in America, we see the fundamental relation of such 
instruction to the welfare of a democratic nation. 
A means of saving the life of the Third Republic.—The 
French course in civic-moral instruction was developed in 1882 
as a great means for saving the life of the Third Republic (1870) 
from being strangled by monarchists, as had been the fate of the
-P-A-G-E-584
  
568 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
First Republic (1792) and the Second Republic (1848). In 
order to give this historic background, which is omitted from so 
many accounts of the French systems of instruction, but which is 
so fundamental in understanding this system, we include the 
following sketch of the three French revolutions and republics: 
Bloody sacrifices of democratic revolution of 1789 succeeded 
by Napoleonic empire.—In 1789, following generations of 
terrific monarchical and ecclesiastical abuses, paralleled for a 
time by democratic propagdnda led by Montesquieu and Rous- 
seau, the great French Revolution began. It ran its course of 
meetings, oratory, constitutions, reforms, and terrors. For a 
short time it experimented with a constitutional monarchy. In 
1792 was proclaimed the First Republic; but in 1793, in the 
midst of civil, religious, and foreign wars, a tyrannical dictator- 
ship was instituted which “ground to powder the fragile liber- 
ties” that the revolution had evolved for the people. During the 
reign of terror which followed, the guillotine claimed nearly all 
the leaders of France who might have saved the republic, thus 
leaving it an easy matter for the sallow-faced young artillery 
officer—the Italian-born genius, Napoleon Bonaparte—to gain 
military leadership and displace the republic, as real ruler in 
1799 and as ordained emperor in 1804. 
Second Republic (1848) overthrown by Napoleon III in 
three years.—Monarchical control lasted from the first Napo- 
leon’s assumption of power to the Revolution of 1848, which 
proclaimed the second republic of France. However, through 
universal suffrage the untrained voters of France elected, owing 
to the glory of his name, Louis Napoleon as the first president 
of the Second Republic. Three years later (1851), by a coup 
d’état, he imprisoned most of the civil and military leaders of 
France and soon made himself emperor of the French. The 
Second Republic was dead. 
Third Republic (1870) proclaimed by democratic Paris, but 
dominated during early years by monarchists.—The third re- 
public of France, the republic of today, was born in the midst of
-P-A-G-E-585
  CIVIC-MORAL IDEALS AND EFFICIENCY 569 
the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, after the Emperor Napoleon 
had been captured at Sedan. It was proclaimed in Paris by a 
crowd led by Gambetta, Jules Favre, and Jules Ferry, on Sep- 
tember 4, 1870. Yet when a national assembly to conclude 
peace with Germany was elected by universal suffrage in 1871, 
it contained a majority of monarchists. Although it was con- 
vened merely to make peace, this assembly continued to exercise 
control until 1873, when it adopted for the republic a constitu- 
tion which, it calculated, would keep the balance of power in the 
hands of the monarchists. 
Legislative victory of republicans.—However, in the early 
elections under the new constitution the republicans of France 
triumphed. They immediately sought to insure the life of the 
Third Republic by appropriate legislation. This included the 
establishment of a national system of secular elementary schools 
in which no religious instruction should be permitted, but in 
which a special program of civic-moral teaching should prevail. 
It is unnecessary for us to go into the details of this scheme. 
Those who want them may read the book entitled ‘French 
Educational Ideals of Today,” listed in reference 17 at the 
end of this chapter. Our chief purpose here is to realize that 
the great French statesmen who organized the scheme were con- 
cerned with the enormous problem of saving the life of a republic 
from monarchical plotters and of developing a healthy demo- 
cratic intelligence and spirit in all citizens. Their plans for 
doing this included extending to all pupils, even those in the 
most remote rural secular schools, the benefits of a scheme of 
civic-moral teaching which had been initiated by the greatest 
minds of France and which educational leaders have since been 
endeavoring for some forty years to perfect. 
Parallel of French and American developments.—In 
America our efforts—which closely parallel those of France— 
date, in their local developments, from about 1910 and, in 
their national developments, from the entrance of America into 
the World War in 1917. At this date the national government
-P-A-G-E-586
  
570 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
undertook the publication of the ‘“‘Lessons in Community and 
National Life,” mentioned on page 567. 
Aid from the social sciences.—In both the French and the 
American experiments in developing published courses_of study 
and textbooks for teaching civic morality, great help has been 
afforded by the social sciences—particularly the scientific stud- 
ies of economics, civics, and sociology. In fact, this assistance 
furnishes one of the crucial points in the new type of moral 
teaching, since the latter endeavors to get each pupil to under- 
stand how interdependent people are today and how his village 
or city, his state or nation, even the world, can be made better 
by following the precepts derived from scientific knowledge of 
wealth and poverty, good citizenship, etc. For example, in one 
of the American lessons on community life referred to above, 
we find the following opening paragraph: 
We saw in our earlier lessons how many are our wants and how 
complex is the social organization that has grown up in the effort to 
supply these wants. The frontiersman with his simple life and direct 
methods of getting food has disappeared, and a city has grown up 
on the site of his farm. Many of the people in the city never see the 
sources of their food and clothing and the other commodities which 
they use. We must go back in all of our studies of complex modern 
life to the natural resources which underlie our civilization. Coupled 
with these natural resources are human energy and human ingenuity 
which work over the materials supplied and ultimately produce the 
things which we use. These facts may be expressed in technical 
terms by saying that production depends on (1) natural resources, 
(2) labor, (3) capital, and (4) organization.? 
Another extract which illustrates this effort to aid pupils to 
understand better the complex civic-moral relationships that 
prevail in modern business and government and between business 
and government is the following conclusion of an imaginary 
discussion between John, a young high-school graduate who is 
interested in getting a job, and his father, who is trying to give 
1Lessons in Community and National Life,” Series A, p. 41.
-P-A-G-E-587
  CIVIC-MORAL IDEALS AND EFFICIENCY 571 
him an idea of the part played by the codperation of many 
specialists in modern life. 
“And that isn’t all of it,” said his father. ‘My own work as a 
factory-inspector illustrates another [phase of this complex coéper- 
ation]. My business is to see that working conditions in factories 
are as good as the law requires. The law is, as you know, a set of 
rules that society has drawn up to govern the whole business. [To 
be sure,] many of the factories that I visit have conditions much 
better than the law requires. The owners are controlled far more by 
their own standards of right and by the opinion of other people— 
their friends or the public—than by law. ... The state pays my 
salary, and the state gets the money from the taxpayers; so they all 
help in the process. Many laws about property rights also enter into 
the control of business. The men who made all these laws and the 
officers who administer them must be counted among the coéperators. 
Nor can we leave out the advertisers, through whom many of these 
specialists tell others of their wares and persuade them to think they 
need these wares. This brings in all the newspaper and magazine 
workers, the writers, the circulation men, the typesetters and press 
operators. The employment agencies and the men who operate them 
also have important duties. . . . Schools have trained many of these 
people for their work. Physicians have kept up their health. Actors 
and ministers have given them recreation and encouragement. Police- 
men and soldiers have given protection and security. All of these, 
therefore, are among the codperators and must be counted in, whether 
we are talking about [the production of] a loaf of bread, a coat, a 
shoe, a song, a sermon, a hairpin, or a battleship.” 
“Well,” said John, “the more I see of this thing, the more there is 
to see.” 
Intelligent comprehension of solidarity gives new sanction to 
civic morality.—It is to this conception of interdependence— 
the dependence of each upon others for his own well-being—that 
modern leaders in the organization of civic-moral instruction 
look for a “sanction” that will appeal to pupils with as much 
force as the fears of hell or the hopes of heaven appeal under 
religious instruction. The French have given more thought to 
1“TLessons in Community and National Life,” Series A, p. 40.
-P-A-G-E-588
  572 TYPES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 
this matter than Americans, who, as a people, are just awaken- 
ing to the need and the problem. Thus, in one of the higher 
French textbooks on civic morality, we find six chapters dealing 
with “solidarity,” which is defined as “the fact that the individ- 
ual cannot realize the conditions of his organic and spiritual 
life except through the codperation, voluntary or involuntary, 
of his fellows.” Among the subtopics under solidarity in this 
text we find the following: (1) physical solidarity—heredity, 
contagion; (2) economic solidarity—meaning of wealth, its 
production as the result of collective labor, nature of the solidar- 
ity that results from the division of labor, solidarity relative to 
the consumption of wealth; (3) scientific solidarity—impor- 
tance, science as a collective labor; (4) moral solidarity— 
imitation, the opinion of others, education; (5) duties that re- 
sult from solidarity—not to harm or exploit society, to codper- 
ate with good will toward social ends; (6) obligation created 
by the instruction one has received, the responsibility of those 
who know. 
Be optimistic about favorable outcomes from civic-moral 
training.—I think, in view of our earlier discussion of the pazt 
played by intelligence in civic-moral behavior, we may be quite 
optimistic about the ultimate success of these comparatively 
new experiments in secular civic-moral training in great de- 
mocracies. The line of argument which justifies this optimism 
would run somewhat as follows: (1) Our psychological analysis 
of character revealed the close connection between an intel- 
ligent understanding of social relations and civic-moral behavior. 
(2) Such an understanding is being facilitated by the rules for 
the guidance of society that are being discovered by modern 
social sciences, including medicine, economics, civics, sociology, 
education, etc. (3) Intelligent educated persons readily see the 
improvement in social living that results from following these 
rules. (4) Many of these persons are altruistic enough by nature 
to work unselfishly for the good of society according to such 
scientific rules. (5) Others, merely through imitation and the
-P-A-G-E-589
  CIVIC-MORAL IDEALS AND EFFICIENCY 573 
desire for social approval, will fall in line. (6) Others, who may 
be naturally more selfish, will see that they and their families 
and relatives will benefit from similar social behavior. (7) A 
small class of feeble-minded and natural-born criminals will 
remain unaffected, but will be more and more restricted, as 
time goes on, through early scientific detection of their immoral 
tendencies and through scientific restriction of their operations. 
(8) As universal suffrage and universal education give increased 
power and wisdom to the masses, there will be increased mo- 
mentum imparted to all movements that make for intelligent 
increase in the happiness of the multitudes, which is the purpose 
of moral democratic life. 
Ideals and efficiency necessitate also inspiration and hab- 
its——We should not forget, however, that such insight into 
social life as the social sciences may give the pupil needs to be 
supplemented by inspirational teaching that strengthens his 
civic-moral beliefs, interests, and enthusiasms and, by unremit- 
ting practice, develops habits and skill in civic-moral behavior. 
For this reason we included in the title of our chapter the words 
“ideals and efficiency.” The word “ideals” suggests insight plus 
the emotional vigor of belief, interest, and enthusiasm. The 
word “efficiency” suggests skillful behavior, such that the 
learner does not merely stumble around with good intentions 
but actually and efficiently performs deeds that are socially 
serviceable. In our sample lessons in Section I we indicated how 
such training in developing civic-moral ideals and efficiency is 
actually in operation in many American classrooms. To the 
extent that your talents permit, you can undertake similar teach- 
ing, be it in the direction of improving moral insight, or moral 
feeling, or actual moral behavior. 
Review Chapter I for perspective view. —At last we have 
reached the end of the discussion of our ten “types of teaching 
and learning.” I wonder if the reader can name the types, di- 
vided into three groups as they are in the text. In order that you 
may keep the balanced point of view of all the types which we
-P-A-G-E-590

invited in our opening chapter, I suggest that you review 
pages 1 to 10 in which a general perspective view of the whole 
book is given. By doing this we can make our introduction 
serve also as a conclusion, which is not inappropriate since each 
should give the reader a general overview of the whole.

  PREE AGE: 
HIS little book does not treat exhauftively of any of the 
aT fubjects which are brought to view in its pages; it is 
more full of fuggeftion than inftruction. Its aim is to ftim- 
ulate thofe who live in the country, or who love the country, 
to a fuller and wider range of thinking about the means of 
naking their homes enjoyable—rather than to lay down any 
definite rules by which this may be accomplifhed. 
I have efpecially fought to excite the ambition of thofe 
holders of humbler eflates, who believe that nothing can be 
done in the way of adornment of country property, except 
under the eye of accomplifhed gardeners. I have endeavored 
fteadily to fhow—whatever may have been the divergence 
of topic—that the proper appliance of fmall means will pro- 
duce effects whofe charms mutt, in their way, ftand unrivalled, 
and that there is no neceflary gulf of diftinction in quality 
of beauty between the beft-ordered large eftate and the ju- 
dicioufly ordered fuburban home of the mechanic.

AN OLD-STYLE FARM.

AN OLDSTYLE FARM. 
OME twenty odd years ago—more or less—I 
chanced to be the owner of a wild, unkempt, 
slatternly farm, of three or four hundred acres in 
extent, amid the rocky fastnesses of eastern Connec- 
ticut. The township in which it lay was a scattered 
wilderness of a settlement, lying along the Hartford 
and New London turnpike. There was a toll-gate (I 
remember that), and I have a fancy that the toll-gath- 
erer was a sallow-faced shoemaker with club-feet, who 
sometimes made his appearance with a waxed-end in 
his mouth, and a flat-headed hammer in his hand. 
He hardly wields the hammer any more ; and his last 
waxed-end must long ago have been drawn tight, and 
clipped away. 
There was a wild common over which the Novem- 
ber winds swept with a pestilent force, with nothing 
to break them, except a pair of twin churches. One

of these was Congregational—severely doric, with 
square-headed windows, painted columns, and a cupola 
for ornamentation. The other was Episcopal, with 
sharp-headed windows, and three or four crazy-look- 
ing turrets; but the paint upon this latter was nearly 
worn away by the storm-gusts that beat unbroken 
over the Common. I am compelled to say too that 
the services were only occasional in this gothic taber- 
nacle; and regret exceedingly to add that, after a 
fitful and spasmodic life, the Episcopal society which 
maintained nominal ownership of this turreted temple 
made over its interest and debts to certain worldly 
parties, and the sharp-headed windows now shed their 
light upon “town meetings,” and the late church is 
abased to the uses of a town hall. It must be said, 
that the rural residents of New England haye no 
large or growing appreciation of the beautiful Litany. 
They like long sermons and a “talking out” in 
prayer. You orl may feel differently ; but the men 
of the population in the retired districts, where books 
and newspapers rarely come, want to hear on a Sun- 
day what the parson will say—not only in his sermon, 
put in his invocations. 
The doric meeting-house, however, gloried in a 
thick, white sheen of paint. The blinds were green 
toa fault. No exterior mark of prosperity seemed 
wanting but a flanking line of horse-sheds, the lack 
 
-P-A-G-E-17

of which upon that bare waste was a terrible source 
of discomfort to the poor brutes who, after a drive 
of three, four, or even five miles, stood shivering in 
the December weather under the lee of the fences. 
A good, kind parson, who presided over the parish 
in the days of which I speak, was earnest in his appeals 
for shelter to the poor brutes, (my little bay mare 
often shivering among them,) but the charitable en- 
thusiasm of the good minister counted for nothing ; 
and to this day, as I am credibly informed, the “ con- 
templated sheds ” remain unbuilt. 
There was a tavern, lying to the northward, along 
the turnpike ; and if I remember rightly, the tavern- 
keeper was a deacon—a staid man, of course, who 
kept an orderly house, and whose daughters, in flam- 
boyant ribbons, were among the belles of the parish. 
The father was, I bélieve, a most worthy man; but 
his rusty brown wig showed badly beside the great 
— flock of golden curls that flanked him in his meeting- 
house pew. His boys were absentees, and addicted 
to horse-trading. 
There was a cooper’s shop upon the sprawling 
street, in which a great clatter and bang were kept 
up every work-day upon shad-barrels. There was 
a carriage-repairing shop, whose restive proprietor 
once brought suit against me for the non-payment 
of a bill. (I am still perfectly satisfied, in my 
 
-P-A-G-E-18
  
  4 RURAL STUDIES. 
own mind, that I paid twice for that “ white-oak 
%”) 
There was a green country store, where “ domes- 
tics” were sold, and West India sugars, and hoes— 
“ Ames’ best cast-steel””—and, I greatly fear, occa- 
sional tipple. It was burned down long ago; ten 
years after, I saw the yawning, ragged cellar, and a 
giant growth of stramonium springing from the door- 
step. 
There was also somewhere along this dreary street 
a manufactory of musical instruments—whether of   
harps or organs I cannot justly say ; but I have been 
given to understand that the manufactory has since, 
under zealous and spirited management, grown into a 
great musical institute, where young misses in white 
(with blue sashes) woo the muses with a thundering 
success. But more distinctly than the manufactory 
—whatever it may have been—I remember a little 
brook, that stole away in the meadows thereabout 
under clumps of alder, under lines of willows, under 
plank bridgelets, and how, on many a May day my 
line drifted on into dark pools, until some swift strike 
gave warning of a venturesome, golden-spotted swim- 
mer that presently tossed and flounced in my creel. 
I profess no great love for music—no knowledge of 
it even; but the whizzing of a reel which a pound 
trout will make at the end of thirty feet of taper line
-P-A-G-E-19
  AN OLD-STYLE FARM. 5 
is to me very charming—charming in those old days 
when the woods and meadows were new, and charm- 
ing now when the woods and the meadows are old. 
Well, well, I began to tell the story of a farm, and 
here I am idling along the borders of a brook! 
The toll-gate, the churches, the tavern, the store 
lay strewn along a high-road, three miles away from 
the valley-farm, of which in those days I was busy 
occupant. And yet so bare of trees was the interval, 
that from many a nook under the coppices of the 
pasture-land I could see the twin churches, the tavern, 
and, with a glass, detect even a stray cow, or the lum- 
bering coach which from time to time wended along 
the high-road of the village. 
The farm was suitably divided (as the old adver- 
tisements were wont to say) into tillage, meadow, and 
pasturelands. This distribution of parts implied that 
the meadows would furnish enough hay in ordinary 
seasons for the winter’s keep of such and so many 
animals, as the pastures carried in good condition 
through the summer; and the arable land was sup- 
posed equal to the growth of such grain and vege- 
tables as would suffice for man and beast throughout 
the year. It was an old, lazy reckoning of capabili- 
ties, which implied little or no progress, and which 
took no account of any systematic rotation. I never 
see a farm advertised under the formula I have named
-P-A-G-E-20
6 RURAL STUDIES. 
—suitably divided into tillage, mowing, and pasture- 
land—but I feel sure that the advertiser is a respect- 
able, old-fashioned gentleman, who keeps a long-tailed 
black coat for Sundays and training-days, and who 
has inherited his agricultural opinions from a very 
* dull and stiffnecked ancestry. Such announcements 
—and they are to be seen not unfrequently in the 
journals—impress me very much as the advertise- 
ment of a desirable dwelling might do—“ suitably 
divided into cooking, eating, and sleeping quarters.” 
There are, to be sure, rough pasture-lands strewn 
with rocks, or full of startling inequalities of surface, 
which must retain for an indefinite period their office 
for simple grazing purposes; but, with rare excep- 
tions, there are not anywhere in the northeastern 
States any considerable stretches of meadow capable 
of growing the better English grasses, which are not 
susceptible of improvement under occasional tillage. 
Draining, indeed, may be first needed, and a scarify- 
ing with the harrow, to root out the old mosses and 
foul growth; but after this, a clean lift of the plow 
and judicious dressing will work wonders. 
But, to return, (for I wish to make the picture of 
an old-fashioned farm complete,) there were mossy 
meadows lying along the borders of a great romping 
millstream, which had been mown for forty years 
without intermission; here and there, where these
-P-A-G-E-21
AN OLD-STYLE FARM. Vi 
meadows lifted into gravelly mounds, patches of plow- 
land had been taken up at intervals of five or eight 
years, and by dint of heavy, laborious cartage of the 
scant manures from the barnyard, over the interven- 
ing meadow “swales”, had shown their periodic 
growth of corn or potatoes, these followed by oats— 
more or less rank as the season was wet or dry—and 
again, on the following year by clover, which in its 
turn was succeeded by red-top and timothy—upon 
which the wild meadow-growth steadily encroached. 
There was, of course, the “ barn-lot,” of which all 
old farmers boasted, maintained in a certain degree 
of foodful succulence and luxuriant fertility by reason 
of the leakage and waste which it inevitably secured, 
and whose richness was due rather to lack of care 
than to skill. There were intervals too of meadow 
upland, through which some little rivulet from the 
pasture hill-side meandered on its way to the larger 
brook of the lowland, and which were kept in verdant 
wealth (no thanks to any human manager) by the 
refreshing influences of the rivulets alone. Four or 
five such straggling brooklets murmured down from 
the pasture high-lands, and a Devonshire farmer 
would have given to each one a wide and wealth-giv- 
ing distribution over acres and acres of the slanting 
meadows. But there was nothing of this. They 
watered their little rod-wide margin of succulent
-P-A-G-E-22
8 RURAL STUDIES. 
grasses, then dropped away into some marshy flat, 
where the flags and rushes grew rampantly, until these 
too gave place to alders, poison sumacs, soft maples 
and black-ash trees. 
The fences were as motley as the militiamen’s 
coats on a first Monday of May. From time to time 
some previous tenant or owner had devoted “ fall 
leisure” to the erection of a wall—mostly in continua- 
tion of a great range of barrier which separated the 
hill-lands from the flat. In this erection each owner’s 
views of economy (no other views being recognized) 
had taken wide divergence. Thus, one had given a 
circular sweep to his trail, for the sake of inclosing 
some tempting smooth spot upon the lowest slope of 
the hills ; another had made a flanking movement in 
the other direction, for the sake of excluding some 
unfortunate little group of innocent rocks. But the 
sinners and the well-doers, on the score of the wall- 
ing, must have long before gone to their account, 
since the stones were all mossy, and the frequent gaps 
had been blocked up by lopping over some vigorous 
young hickory or chestnut which had started from 
the base of the wall. 
But even this rustic device had not given full 
security, for with settlements and the “bulging” 
under frosts, this great line of barrier was no proof 
against the clambering propensities of the sheep; and 
 
-P-A-G-E-23
  AN OLD-STYLE FARM. 9 
the whole line of fence had been topped with long 
poles, kept in their places by cross stakes firmly 
driven into the ground and sustaining the “riders” 
at the point of intersection. To complete the fence 
picture, I have to add to those half-lopped hickories in 
the gaps—to those bulging tumors of stone—to those 
gaunt over-riding poles—a great array of blackberry 
briers, of elders, of dog-willows, of dried stems of 
golden-rod, of raspberries, and of pretentious wild- 
cherries. Still further, I must mark down a great 
sprawling array of the scattered wall, in some half- 
dozen spots, where adventurous hunters had made a 
mining foray after some unfortunate woodchuck or 
rabbit. 
So much for the average New England walling in 
retired districts twenty years ago. Is it much better 
now? As for the wooden fencing, there stretched 
across the meadow by the road a staggering line of 
“posts and rails”—one post veering southward the 
next veering northward—a wholly frightful line, 
which was like nothing so much asa file of tipsy 
soldiers making vain efforts to keep “eyes right.” In 
the woodlands and upon the borders of the farm, 
were old, lichen-covered Virginia fences, sinking rail 
by rail into the earth; luxuriant young trees were 
shooting up in the angles, brambles were overgrow- 
ing them, and poisonous vines—the three-leaved Ampe- 
1*
-P-A-G-E-24
  10 RURAL STUDIES. 
lopsis among them (which country people call mer- 
cury, ivy, and I know not what names beside)—and 
this entire range of exterior fence was gone over each 
springtime—April being the usual month—and made 
effective, by lopping upon it such lusty growth as 
may have sprung up the season past. It is afflictive 
to think what waste of natural resources is committed 
in this way every year by the scrubby farmers of New 
England ! 
The stock equipment of this farm of nearly four 
hundred acres, consisted of twelve cows, some six 
head of young stock, two yoke of oxen, a pair of 
horses, and a hundred and fifty sheep. I blush even . 
now as I write down the tale of such poor equipment 
for a farm which counted at least two hundred and 
seventy acres of open land—the residue being wood, 
or impenetrable swamp. And it is still more melan- 
choly to reflect that the portion of the land which 
aided most in the sustenance of this meagre stock, 
was that which was most nearly in a state of nature. 
I speak of those newly cleared pasture-lands from 
which the wood had been removed within ten years. 
In giving this description of a farm of twenty years 
ago, I feel sure that I am describing the available 
surface of a thousand farms in New England to-day. 
We boast indeed of our thrift and enterprise, but 
these do not work in the direction of land culture—
-P-A-G-E-25
AN OLD-STYLE FARM. U1 
at least not in the way of that liberal and generous 
culture which insures the largest product. I doubt 
greatly if there be any people on the face of the 
earth, equally intelligent, who farm so poorly as the 
men of New England; and there are tens of thou- 
sands less intelligent who manage their lands infinitely 
better. I do not quite understand why the American 
character, which has shown such wonderful aptitude 
for thrift in other directions, should have shown so 
little in the direction of agriculture. I feel quite con- 
fident that seven out of ten of the most accomplished 
and successful nurserymen, gardeners, and farmers in 
the country, are of foreign birth, or of foreign parent- 
age. Within the limits of my own experience, I find 
it infinitely more difficult to secure a good American 
farmer, than to secure a good Scotch or even an Irish 
one. And I observe with not a little shame, that 
while the American is disposed to make up the tale 
of his profits by sharp bargains, the Scotch are as 
much disposed to make it up by liberal treatment, of 
the land. Why is this? The American is not illib- 
eral by nature ; a thousand proofs lie to the contrary ; 
but by an unfortunate traditional belief he is disposed 
to count the Jand only a rigorous step-dame from 
which all possible benefit is to be wrested, and the 
least possible return made, 
Is the Congressional grant for agricultural colleges 
   
-P-A-G-E-26

to work a change in this belief in the minds of those 
who hold the great mass of the land under control ? 
Not surely until the newly started colleges shall have 
madesome more vigorous practical demonstration than 
they have made thus far. The bearings of science 
upon agriculture were well taught previously under 
the wing of the established universities; what the 
public had reason to hope from the new endowment 
was such practical exhibit of the economic value of a 
thorough system in tillage and management, as should 
carry conviction to the popular mind. As yet we 
wait in vain. Looking at results thus far, I am 
strongly of the opinion that a few thousands devoted 
to the gratuitous distribution of one or two sterling 
agricultural newspapers would have worked more 
good to the farming interests of the community, than 
the millions which have been committed to the wis- 
dom of the several State legislatures. I have no hope 
that these views will mect the concurrence of those 
who have present control of the funds; nor do I 
mean to express a doubt of the honesty and good 
intentions of those who have become the supervisors 
of this great trust ; but I am strongly of the assurance 
that the common sense of the country is largely dis- 
posed to ask of the scientific gentlemen who have 
been so largely the recipients of this congressional 
bounty some practical demonstration upon the land, 
of the faith they hold and teach.
-P-A-G-E-27
  AN OLD-STYLE FARM. 18 
I come back to the old farm, with its meagre 
stock and its wide acres. Of course there was some- 
thing to be sold. Farmers never get on without that. 
First of all, came the “ veals ”—selling in that day 
for some two cents a pound, live weight. (They now 
sell in the New York market for ten.) This bridged 
over the spring costs, until the butter came from the 
first growth of the pastures. 
—How well I remember tossing myself from bed 
at an hour before daylight, Seth (by previous orders) 
having the horse and wagon ready, and by candle- 
light seeing to the packing of the spring butter—the 
firkins being enwrapped in dewy grass, fresh cut— 
and then setting forth upon the long drive (twelve 
miles) to the nearest market town, What a drive it 
was! Five miles on, I saw the early people stirring 
and staring at me, as they washed their faces in the 
basin at the well. Then came woods, and silence, but 
a strange odorous freshness in the air—possibly some 
near coal-pit gave its kreosotic fumes, not unpleasant ; 
some owl, in the swamps I passed, lifted its melancholy 
hoot ; further on I saw some early riser driving his 
cows to pasture ; still further I caught sight of chil- 
dren at play before some farm-house door, and the 
sun being fairly risen, I knew their breakfasts were 
waiting them within. 
After this, I passed occasional teams upon the
-P-A-G-E-28
  14 RURAL STUDIES. 
road, and gave a “good morning” to the drivers. 
Then came the toll-gate: I wondered if the day’s 
profits would be equal to the toll? After this came 
the milk wagons whisking by me, and I envied them 
their short rounds; at last (the sun being now two 
hours high) came sight of the market town—city, I 
should say; for the legislature had given it long 
before the benefit of the title; and on the score of 
church spires, and taverns, and shops, and news- 
papers, and wickedness, it deserved the name. 
I wish I could catch sight once more of the old 
gentleman (a good grocer as the times went) who 
plunged his thumb-nails into my golden rolls of but- 
ter, and said: “ We’re buying pooty fair butter at 
twelve and a half cents, but seein’ as it’s you, we'll 
say thirteen cents a pound for this,” and he ‘cleaned 
his thumb-nail upon the breech of his trowsers. 
I am not romancing here, I am only telling a 
plain, straightforward story of my advent, some 
twenty years ago, upon a summer’s morning into the 
city of N—. I recall now vividly the detestably 
narrow and. muddy strees—the poor horse, (I had 
bought it of the son of our deacon,) wheezing with 
his twelve-mile drive—my own empty faint stomach 
—the glimpses of the beautiful river between the 
hills—and the golden butter which I must needs sell 
to my friend the grocer at thirteen cents! I hope he
-P-A-G-E-29
  AN OLD-STYLE FARM. 15 
had never any qualms of conscience ; but it is a faint 
hope to entertain of grocers. I knew a single naively 
honest one; but to him I never offered anything for 
sale. I feared he might succumb to that temptation. 
After the butter, (counting some forty odd pounds 
in weight per week,) the next most important sale was 
that of the lambs and wool. The lambs counted ordi- 
narily—leaving out the losses of the newly dropped 
ones by crows* and foxes—some hundred or more. 
And nice lambs they were; far better than the half I 
find in the markets to-day. Nothing puts sweeter and 
more delicate flesh upon young lambs than that luxu- 
riant growth of herbage which springs from freshly 
cleared high-lying wood-lands. In piquancy and rich- 
ness, it is as much beyond the lambs of stall-fed 
sheep, as the racy mutton of the Dartmoors is beyond 
the turnip-fatted wethers of the downs of Hampshire. 
And yet these lambs were delivered to the butcher 
at an ignoble price; I think a dollar and a half a head 
was all that could be secured for animals which in 
* Enthusiastic bird-lovers will learn, may be with surprise, that 
crows are capable of this mischief, but it is even true. Their vil- 
lainous method is to pluck out the eyes of the newly born innocents, 
and then leave their prey until death and putrefaction shall have 
ripened it to their taste. Only extreme hunger, however, will drive 
the crow to such game. I think I have never felt more murderously 
inclined than when I have seen upon a bleak day of April one of 
these black harpies perched upon the head of its faintly struggling 
victim, and deliberately plucking away the eyes from the socket. 
 
-P-A-G-E-30
16 RURAL STUDIES. 
the city would bring to-day nearly five dollars. The 
wool was bought up by speculators in that time, and 
the speculators were not extravagant. I remember 
very well driving off upon a summer’s afternoon, 
mounted upon twelve great sacks of fleeces, and being 
rather proud of my receipts, at the rate of twenty- 
eight cents per pound. (The same wool would have 
brought two years since eighty cents per pound.) 
After we disposed of the butter and the wool, and 
during the late autumn months, came the cartage of 
wood—some eight miles—to a port upon the river, at 
which four dollars per cord was paid for good oak 
wood, and five for hickory. At present rates of 
labor, these are sums which would not pay for the 
cutting and cartage. 
I must not forget the swine—two or three vener- 
able porkers, and in an adjoining pen a brood of 
young shoats—that would equip themselves in great 
layers of fat, from the whey during the hot months, 
and the yellow ears of corn with the first harvesting 
of October. Day after day, through May, through 
June, came the unwearied round of milking, of driy- 
ing to pasture, of plowing, of planting; day after day 
the sun beat hotter on the meadows, on the plow- 
land, on the reeking sty; day after day the buds 
unfolded—the pink of orchards hung in flowery sheets 
over the scattered apple trees; the dogwood threw

out its snowy burden of blossoms from the edges of 
the wood; the oaks showed their velvety tufts, and 
with midsummer there was a world of green and of 
silence—broken only by an occasional “ Gee, Bright!” 
of the teamster, or the cluck of a matronly hen, or 
hum of bees, or the murmur of the brook. All this 
inviting to a very dreamy indolence, which, I must 
confess, was somehow vastly enjoyable. 
Nothing to see? Lo, the play of light and shade 
over the distant hills, or the wind, making tossed and 
streaming wavelets on the rye. Nothing to hear? 
‘Wait a moment and you shall listen to the bursting 
melodious roundelay of the merriest singer upon 
earth —the black and white coated Bob-o’-Lincoln, as 
he rises on easy wing, floats in the sunshine, and 
overflows with song, then sinks, as if exhausted by 
his brilliant solo, to some swaying twig of the alder 
bushes. Nothing tohope? The maize leaves through 
all their close serried ranks are rustling with the 
promise of golden corn. Nothing to conquer? There 
are the brambles, the roughnesses, the inequalities, 
the chill damp earth, the whole teeming swamp-land. 
I have tried to outline the surroundings and ap- 
pointments of many a back country farmer of New 
England to-day. I am sure the drawing is true,

sunrise. It is his market day, and the old sorrel mare 
is harnessed, and tied to the hitch-post. The wagon 
is of antique shape, bulging out in front and rear, and 
with halfrounded ends. The high-backed seat is sup- 
ported upon a V-shaped framework of ash, and coy- 
ered over with a yellow buffalo skin, of which the 
fur is half worn away. An oaken firkin is presently 
lifted in, with a white linen cloth shut down under 
its cover, and a corner of the buffalo turned over it 
to'shield it from the dust and the sunshine. Then 
comes a bushel basket of eggs, packed in rowen hay ; 
next the great clothes-basket, covered with a table 
cloth, in which lie the two hind quarters of a veal 
killed yesterday, (the fore quarters being kept for 
home consumption.) In the corner of the wagon is 
thrust a squat jug—its stopper being a corn-cob 
wrapped around with newspaper—which is to be 
filled with “ Port 0’ reek” molasses. Then, at last, 
Jerusha, the wife, in silver spectacles, and Sunday 
gown, clambers in—a stout woman, with her waist 
belted in, after a loose sausage-like way—who has a _ 
last word for her ‘darter’ Sally Ann, and then 
another last word, and who cautions Enos (her hus- 
band) about “ turnin’ too short,” and who asks if the 
mare “an’t gittin’ kind o’ frisky with the spring 
weather ?” 
So they drive away—Enos and Jerushy. They _
-P-A-G-E-33
  AN OLD-STYLE FARM. 19 
talk of the new “ howsen ” along the way ; they dis- 
cuss the last Sunday’s sermon: Enos says, “I’ve 
heerd that Hosea Wood is a cortin’ Malviny Smith.” 
“Don’t b’lieve a word on’t, Enos. No sich a 
thing. Did you put a baitin’ for the hoss in the 
waggin, Enos ?” 
“No, Ivum! I forgot it,” says Enos. 
“ What a plaguey careless creeter you're a gittin’ 
to be, Enos!” 
And so the good worthy couple jog on. In town, 
the jug is filled; the stout matron peers through her 
spectacles at tapes, thread, needles, and a stout “ cal- 
iker ” gown (fast colors) for Sally Ann. Pater-fami- 
lias sees to the filling of the flat jug, he makes a fair 
sale of the two quarters of veal, he buys a few “ gard- 
ing” seeds, a new rake, a scythe snathe, and dickers 
for a grindstone—unavailingly. Two hours before 
nightfall, the good couple jog homeward again, with 
humdrum quietude. 
It is not such a scene of domesticity as I ever 
forecast for my own enjoyment. I believed, and still 
believe, that the dead life upon the back country 
New England farms, is capable of being stirred into 
alive life. Over and overI forecast the day when 
the inequalities should be smoothed, the swamps 
drained, the woodlands cleared up, (leaving only here 
and there some clump of giant oaks or chestnuts

about a loitering brooklet,) the cattle quadrupled in 
number, the muck-lands yielding their harvests to be 
composted with the concentrated manures of the 
town, the very walls to be straightened (of which a 
beginning had been made), and such stir and move- 
ment and growth and cumulative fertility as should 
make the neighborhood open its eyes wide, and stare 
to a purpose. I saw the wasting rivulets dammed 
and distributing their fertilizing flow over acres of 
the side-land ; I saw the maple swamps giving place 
to wide stretches of heavy meadow; I saw the wild 
growth of the pasture-lands cut and piled and burned, 
and all the hillsides glittering with a new wealth of 
green, 
But: it was not to be. In the very heat of the 
endeavor, there came a flattering invitation to change 
the scene of labor and of observation, a single night 
only being given for decision. I remember the night 
as if only this morning’s sun broke it, and kindled it 
into day. One way, the brooks, the oaks, the crops, 
the memories, the homely hopes, lured me ; the other 
way, I saw splendid and enticing phantasmagoria— 
London Bridge, St. Paul’s, Prince Hal, Fleet Street, 
Bolt Court, Kenilworth, wild ruins. Next morning 
I gave the key of the corn-crib to the foreman, and 
bade the farm-land adieu. 
Within a month I was strolling over the fields of
-P-A-G-E-35

Lancashire, wondering at that orderly, systematic 
cultivation of which New England had not dreamed 
—wondering at the grand results of this liberal and 
generous culture, and more than ever disgusted at the 
pinched and starveling way in which my countrymen 
were cheating the land of its opulent privilege of pro- 
duction. 
I have written this little descriptive episode of 
a farm-life in New England to serve as the background 
for certain illustrative hints toward the amendment 
of rural life—whether in matters of good husbandry, 
or of good taste; I have furthermore ventured upon 
certain homeliness of detail in these opening pages, to 
show that I may have privilege of speech. 
There is no manner of work done upon. a New 
England farm to which some day I have not put my 
hand—whether it be chopping wood, laying wall, 
sodding a coal-pit, cradling oats, weeding corn, shear- 
ing sheep, or sowing turnips. Therefore, in any 
future references which I may make in the course of 
these papers to farm life, I trust that my good readers 
will credit me with a certain connaissance de cause.

Pomologists and Common People. 
DO not know that the Horticulturists proper are 
the best advisers of a man who wishes—as so many 
do in these times—to establish his little home in the 
country, and to make it charming with fruits and 
flowers, and all manner of green things. I think that 
the professional tastes or successes of one devoted to 
Horticulture might lead him into a great many extray- 
agances of suggestion, in the entertainment of which, 
the plain country liver—making lamentable failures— 
would lose courage and faith. The Pomologists may 
indeed say that there is no reason to make failure if 
their suggestions are followed to the letter, and the 
proper amount of care bestowed. This may be very 
true; but they do not enough consider that nine out 
of ten who love the country, and its delights of garden

or orchard, can never be brought to that care and 
nicety of observation, which, with the devoted Hor- 
ticulturist, is a second nature. 
Most men go to the country to make an easy thing 
of it. If they must commence study of all the later 
discoveries in vegetable physiology, and keep a sharp 
eye upon all new varieties of fruit—lest they fall be- 
hind the age ; and trench their land every third year, 
and screen it—may be—in order to ensure the most 
perfect comminution of the soil, they find themselves 
entering upon the labors of a new profession, instead 
of lightening the fatigues of an old one. Any 
thorough practice of Horticulture does indeed involve 
all this ; but there are plenty of outsiders, who, with- 
out any strong ambition in that direction, have yet a 
very determined wish to reap what pleasures they can 
out of a country life, by such moderate degree of 
attention and of labor as shall not overtax their time, 
or plunge them into the anxieties of a new and en- 
grossing pursuit. 
What shall be done for them? To talk to such 
people—and I dare say scores of them may be reading 
these pages now—about the comparative vigor of a 
vine grown from a single eye, or a vie grown from a 
layer, or about the shades of difference in flavor be- 
tween a Vicomtesse berry and a Triomphe de Gand— 
is to talk Greek to them; it is as if a druggist were
-P-A-G-E-41
ADVICE FOR LACKLAND. 27 
to talk about the comparative influences of potash or 
of some simple styptic upon an irritated mucous 
membrane, to a man who wants simply—something 
to cure a sore throat. It is the aim of the Horticul- 
turist to push both land and plants to the last limit 
of their capacity—to establish new varieties—to pro- 
voke nature by incessant pinchings into some abnor- 
mal development; whereas the aim of the mass of 
suburban residents is to have a cheery array of flowers 
—good fruit and plenty of it, at the smallest possible 
cost. If indeed the latter have any hope of winning 
what they wish, by simple transfer of their home 
from city to country, without any care or cost what- 
ever, they are grossly mistaken. Ifa mere, bald love 
of fruit-eating, without any love for the means of its 
production—calls a man to the country, I would 
strongly advise him to stay in town, and buy fruit 
at the city markets ; and the man who goes into the 
country merely to stretch his legs, I would as strongly 
advise to do it on Broadway, or in bed. Nature isa 
mistress that must be wooed with a will; and there 
is no mistress worth the having, that must not be 
wooed in the same way. 
But the distinction remains which I have laid 
down between the aims of the Pomologists and of the 
quiet country liver. And I am strongly inclined to 
think that the former are a little too much disposed 
 
-P-A-G-E-42
  28 RURAL STUDIES. 
to sneer at the simple tastes of the latter. There is 4 
sturdy professional pride that enters into this, for 
something. I have before now been thrown into the 
company of breeders of blooded stock who would not 
so much as notice the best native animals—no matter 
how tenderly cared for, or how assiduously combed 
down; and yet a good dish of cream most people 
relish, even if the name of the cow.is not written in 
the Herd-books. Of course that nice discrimination 
of tastes which enables a man to detect the minute 
shades of difference in flavors, is a thing of growth 
and long culture, and every man is inclined to respect 
what has cost him long culture. But if I smack my 
lips over the old Hovey, or a mahogany colored Wil- 
son, and stick by them, I do not know that the zeal- 
ous Pomologist has a right to condemn me utterly, 
because I do not root up my strawberry patches and 
plant Russell’s Prolific, or the Jocunda in their place. 
It is even doubtful if extreme cultivation of taste does 
not do away with a great deal of that hearty gusto 
with which most men enjoy good fruit. The man 
who is all the summer through turning some little 
tid-bit of flavor upon the tip of his tongue, and going 
off into fits of rumination upon the possible difference 
of flavor between a Crimson-Cone when watered from 
an oak tub, and a Crimson-Cone when watered from 
a chestnut tub, seems to me in a fair way of losing all
-P-A-G-E-43
  ADVICE FOR LACKLAND. 29 
the appreciable and honest enjoyment of fruit which 
he ever had in his life. There lives about the London- 
Dock-Vaults a race of pimpled-faced men whose pro- 
fessional service it is to guzzle small draughts of 
Chateaux Margaux or of rare Port, which they whip 
about with their tongues and expend their tasting 
faculties upon, with enormous gravity: but who in 
the world supposes that these can have the same 
appreciation of an honest bumper of wine, which a 
quiet Christian gentleman has, who sits down to his 
dinner with a moderate glass of good, sound Bor- 
deaux at his elbow ? 
Outsiders may, I think, find a little comfort in 
this, and take courage in respect of their old Hovey 
patches—if they will keep them only clean and rich. 
But I have not said all this out of any want of 
regard for Horticulture as an art, demanding both 
skill and devotion; nor have I said it from any want 
of respect for those pomologists who are boldly lead- 
ing the van in the prosecution of the Art; but I have 
wished simply to clear away a little platform from 
which to talk about the wants of humble cultivators, 
and the way in which those wants are to be met. 
And here my old question recurs—what shall be 
done for them ? 
To give my reply definite shape, I picture to my- 
self my old friend Lackland, who has grown tired of
-P-A-G-E-44
  30 RURAL STUDIES. 
thumping over the city pavements, who has two or 
three young children to whom he wishes to give a 
free tumble on the green sward, and who has an in- 
tense desire to pick his grapes off his own vine, in- 
stead of buying them on Broadway at forty cents the 
pound. He comes to me for advice. 
“My dear fellow,” I should say, “ there’s no giv- 
ing any intelligible advice to aman whose notions 
are so crude. Do you want a country home for the 
year, or only a half home for six months in the year, 
from which yow'll be flitting when the leaves are 
gone?” 
“To be sure,” says he, “it’s worth considering. 
And yet what difference could it make with your 
suggestions? Once established, I could determine 
better.” 
“Tt makes this difference :—if you propose to es- 
tablish a permanent home for the year, you want to 
provide against wintry blasts; you don’t want a hill- 
top where a northwester will be driving in your teeth 
all November; you want shelter; and you want near 
walks for your children through the snow-banks to 
school or church ; and you don’t want the sea boom- 
ing at the foot of your garden all winter long. If it’s 
only a summer stopping place you have your eye 
upon, all these matters are of little account.” 
“Suppose we make it a permanent home,” says
-P-A-G-E-45
~ ADVICE FOR LACKLAND. 31 
Lackland, “how much ground do I want to grow all 
the fruit and vegetables I may need for my family ?” 
“That depends altogether upon your mode of 
culture. If you mean to trench and manure thorough- 
ly, and have good soil to start with, and keep it up 
to the best possible condition, a half acre will more 
than supply you.” 
“ Call it two acres,” says he, “and what shall I 
plant upon it ?” 
What shall a man plant upon his two acres of 
ground, on which he wishes to establish a cozy home, 
where his children can romp to their hearts’ content, 
and he—take a serene pleasure in plucking his own 
fruit, pulling his own vegetables, smelling at his own 
rose-tree and smoking under his own vine? If he 
goes up with the question to some high court of Hor 
ticulture, he comes away with a list as long as my 
arm—in which are remontants that must be strawed 
over, vines that must be laid down, vegetables that 
must be coaxed by a fortnight of forcing, rare shrubs 
that must have their monthly pinching, monster ber- 
ries that must have their semi-weekly swash of guano 
water, and companies of rare bulbs that, after wilting 
of the leaves, must be dug, and dried, and watched, 
and put out of reach, and found again, and replanted. 
And my friend Lackland reporting such a list to 
me, sees a broad grin gradually spreading over my face. 
 
-P-A-G-E-46
  a2, RURAL STUDIES. 
“ You think it a poor list, then?” says he. 
“TI beg your pardon; it’s a most capital one; 
there are the newest things of every sort in it; and 
if you cultivate them as they ought to be cultivated, 
yowl make a fine show; they'll elect you member of 
a Horticultural Society; heaven only knows but 
they'll name you on a tasting committee.” 
“That would be jolly,” says he. 
“And yowll need plenty of bass-matting, and 
patent labels, and lead wire, and a box of grafting 
instruments, and brass syringes of different capacities, 
and gauze netting for some of your more delicate 
fruits, and porcelain saucers to float your big goose- 
berries in, and forcing beds, and guano tanks, and a 
small propagating house, and a padlock on your 
garden, and a Scotchman to keep the key at seventy 
dollars a month, and a fag to work the compost-heaps 
at forty-five more.” 
“The devil I will!” he says. 
“Don’t be profane,” I should say, “or if you 
needs must, you'll have better occasion for it when 
you get fairly into the traces.” 
And then—more seriously—“ My dear fellow, the 
list, as I have said, is a capital one; but it supposes 
most careful culture, extreme attention, and a love for 
all the niceties of the art—which you have not got. 
You want to take things easy; you don’t want to 
 
-P-A-G-E-47
  ADVICE FOR LACKLAND. 33 
torment yourself with the idea that your children 
may be plucking unaware your specimen berries; you 
don’t want to lock them out of the garden. As sure 
as you undertake such a venture you'll be at odds 
with your Scotchman ; you'll lose the names of your 
own trees; you'll forget the hyacinths; your ‘ half- 
hardys’ will all be scotched by the second winter ; 
your dwarf ‘ Vicars’ that need such careful nursing 
and high dressing will dwindle into lean shanks of 
pears that have no flavor. My advice to you is—to 
throw the fine list in the fire ; to limit yourself, until 
you have felt your way, to some ten ora dozen of 
the best established varieties ; don’t be afraid of old 
things if they are good; if a gaunt Rhode Island 
Greening tree is struggling in your hedge-row, trim 
it, scrape it, soap it, dig about it, pull away the turf 
from it, lime it, and then if you can keep up a fair 
fight against the bugs and the worms, you will have 
fine fruit from it; if you can’t, cut it down. Ifa 
veteran mossy pear tree is in your door-yard, groom 
it as you would a horse—just in from a summering 
in briary pastures—put scions of Bartlett, of Win- 
ter Nelis, of Rostiezer into its top and sides. In an 
unctuous spot of your garden, plant your dwarf 
Duchess, Bonne de Jersey, Beurre Diel, and your 
Glout Morceau. If either don’t do well, pull it up 
and burn it; don’t waste labor on a sickly young

tree. Save some sheltered spot for a trellis, where 
you may plant a Delaware, an Iona or two, a Re- 
becca, and a Diana. Put a Concord at your south- 
side door—its rampant growth will cover your 
trellised porch ina pair of seasons: it will give 
you some fine clusters, even though you allow it to 
tangle: the pomologists will laugh at you; but let 
them: you will have your shade and the wilderness 
of frolicsome tendrils, and at least a fair show of 
purple bunches. Scatter here and there hardy her- 
baceous flowers that shall care for themselves, and 
which the children may pluck with a will. Don’t 
distress yourself if your half acre of lawn shows 
some hummocks, or dandelions, or butter-cups. And 
if a wild clump of bushes intrude in a corner, don’t 
condemn it too hastily ; it may be well to enliven it 
with an evergreen or two—to dig about it, and paint 
its edges with a few summer phloxes or roses. You 
will want neither Scotchman nor forcing houses for 
this.” 
This is the way in which I should have talked to 
my friend Lackland, who would want to take things 
easy. 
I should not wonder if he were to buy his placa 
of two acres, and make trial. God bless him if he 
does.

Lackland Makes a Beginning. 
Y friend Lackland—as I suspected he would— 
has purchased a little place of two and a half 
acres, some thirty or forty miles from the city by the 
New Haven railway. He makes his trips to and 
fro with a little badly-disguised fear of decayed 
“sleepers,” it is true ; and suffers from the still more 
frequent embarrassment of riding upon his feet—all 
the seats being occupied, and the company being 
unfortunately too much straitened in their circum- 
stances to add to the number of their carriages. 
He was disposed to resent such things at the start, 
and was even stirred into writing a brief and indig- 
nant appeal to an independent morning journal; but 
upon being answered by an attorney for the company 
or a road commissioner, who called him names and 
abused him, as if he had been a witness before a 
court of justice, he subsided into that meek respect 
for corporations, and awe of all their procedure, 
which are the characteristics of a good American 
citizen, and of most well-ordered newspapers. 
New Yorkers learn how to bear such things; 
there is no better schooling for submission than a 
two or three years course of travel upon the city 
railways; Lackland is submissive. And after a
-P-A-G-E-50
  36 RURAL STUDIES. 
fatiguing day in Maiden Lane, having come up~ 
Fourth Avenue with a stout woman in his lap, he 
is grateful for even a standpoint upon one of the 
New Hayen cars. 
But this is all by the way. 
My friend Lackland has, as I said, bought a small 
country place within a mile of village and station, 
for which the purchase-money, in round numbers, was 
six thousand dollars, A certain proportion of this 
sum was paid in view of a projected horse railway, 
which is to pass the door, and to unfold building 
sites over his whole area of land. As yet, however, 
it is in the rough. There is indeed “a brand-new 
house upon it—two stories, and only three years 
built,” as he writes me, “ with ell wash-room, and 
all well painted with two coats of white lead. The 
property is distributed into six different enclosures, 
of which I send you a draught.” 
And herewith I give the exhibit of Mr. Lack- 
land’s little place, with its condition at time of put- 
chase. 
“You will observe,” he continues, “ that there is 
rather a cramped. aspect about the door-yard and 
entrance, these being hemmed in by a white picket 
fence on either side and in front. It is unfortunately 
the only sound fence about the premises ; the garden

pattern, and the other enclosures never having boasted 
anything finer than ‘post and rail’ fixtures, with a 
half-wall to prop them upon some of the exterior 
lines. The enclosure (d) is what the previous owner 
called his back yard ; it was traversed, as you see, by 
a cart-path leading straight to the barn court, and 
was encumbered with a prodigious array of old wood, 
brush heaps, a broken cart or two, and one of the 
most luxurious thickets of burdock and stramonium 
which I ever remember to have seen. He (former 
owner) tells me stramonium is good for ‘biles.’ Is it? 
“The buildings around the little enclosure marked 
(g) will explain themselves—a barn, a hog-pen, a cow- 
shed—all in most dilapidated condition, so much so 
that I shall have to make a new investment in the

orchard upon the plot marked (), with only three or 
four ragged and disorderly looking trees; at (j) 
again, there is a patch which has been in potatoes and 
corn for an indefinite number of years, and which has

run with briars and stunted cedars, that I fear will 
cost a round sum to reduce to a level. The fields (7) 
and (A) are pieces of mangy grass scattered over with 
occasional bushes, but I do not despair of putting a 
smooth face upon them, The only view from the 
premises that is worth considering, is rather a pretty 
one (indicated by a dotted line) of the village spire, 
and a few of the village roofs peeping out from the 
trees, and back of them a glimpse of the Sound. I 
send a rough sketch of it.

“But the misfortune is, the view is only to 
be seen to advantage from my wash-room door, or 
from one spot in the garden just now encumber- 
ed with enormous Lawton briars. The first posi- 
tion is soapy and damp for visitors, and the last— 
tedious. 
“ What I wish of you,”—my friend Lackland con- 
tinues to write,—“ is to give me a hint or two about 
the combing of this rough little home of mine into 
shape. And in order to a more definite understand- 
ing I will tell you briefly what I don’t want, and next 
what I do want.

to say, has been capitally arranged. 
“T don’t want such a great array of fences; I

“T do want a little of good elbow-room about the 
house and entrance, as if I were not in momentary 
fear of an incursion of pigs from the back yard ; I do 
want a garden of somewhat larger area, where I can 
grub away at my will; and if you draw me a plan, 
put at least a fourth of the whole land into herbs and. 
garden stuff. I want the view kept of the village 
spire, and the background of sea, and some lounging 
place from which I may look upon it at my leisure.

my boys, or cut a bit of hay, or—if the humor takes

sunny stable court to the south of it. At (m) you 
have your paddock for the mare, or your mall for 
base-ball, or your plow-ground for a premium crop— 
utterly free from shrubbery, and communicating with 
barn and with street alike. The lawn explains and

shrubbery marked (j) will be a capital spot, under

plant apple trees, and at fifteen feet of distance, a

trees forming the screen, and the other the interposition of a wall. 
The last is expensive and the former liable to be neglected. An 
open ditch, some two feet deep by eighteen inches wide, I have seen 
most effectively employed for the end proposed, by a very successful 
southern horticulturist, who succeeded, year after year, in securing 
a magnificent bloom of some ten or twelve varieties of Azaleas, 
within twenty feet of gigantic cypresses and magnolias. The ditch 
may also serve as a convenient receptacle for leaves and the rakings 
of the borders.

Lackland’s House Plans. 
i NFORTUNATELY, almost every city gentle- 
man who comes into possession—whether by 
purchase or otherwise—of a plain country house, 
from which some honest well-to-do farmer has just 
decamped, puzzles his brain first of all, to know how 
he shall make a “fine thing” of it. My advice to 
such puzzled gentlemen, in nine cases out of ten, 
would be—‘ not to do it.” 
If the ceilings are low, and the beams show here 
and there the generous breadth and depth of timber 
which old-time builders put into their frames, cherish 
these remembrances of a sturdier stock than ours; 
scrub and paint and paper as you will, but if the 
skeleton be stanch, and no dry rot shake the joints 
or give a sway to the floors and ceiling—try, for a 
few years at least, the moral effect of an old house. 
It can do no harm to a dapper man from the city. It 
may teach his wife possibly some of the humilities 
which she cannot learn on Broadway. With a free, 
bracing air whistling around the house corners, and 
here and there an open fire within, low rooms are by 
no means poisonous; and if the trees do not so far 
shade the roof as to keep away the fierce outpourings 
of a summer’s sun, and the low chambers carry a
-P-A-G-E-59
  ADVICE FOR LACKLAND. 45 
stifling air in August, it is only necessary, in many 
instances, to tear away the garret flooring, and to run 
up the chamber ceilings into tent-like canopies, with 
a ventilator in their peak—to have as free circulation 
as in the town attics. And such tented ceilings may 
be prettily hung with French striped papers, with a 
fringe-like border at the line of junction of the verti- 
cal with the sloping wall—in such sort that your 
military friend, if he comes to pass a July night with 
you, may wake with the illusion of the camp upon 
him, and listen to such réveile as the crowing of a 
cock, or the piping of a wren. 
But a monstrous and intolerable grievance to all 
people of taste lies in the attempt to set off one of 
those grave exteriors, at which I have hinted, by 
some of the more current architectural cockneyisms. 
Thus, an ancient door, with the dark green paint in 
blisters upon it, and opening in the middle, perhaps, 
is torn away to give place to the newest fancy from 
the sash factories, and a glazing of red and blue. 
For my part, I have great respect for a door that has 
banged back and forth its welcomes and its good- 
byes for half a century; the very blisters on it seem to 
me only the exuding humors of a jovial hospitality ; 
and all the weather-stains are but honorable scars of 
a host of battles against wind and rain, I would no 
more barter such an old-time door against the new- 
 
-P-A-G-E-60
46 RURAL STUDIES. 
ness of the joiners, than I would barter old-time 
honesty against that of Oil Creek, or of Wall Street. 
Then again, your cockney must tear away the 
homely sheltering porch, with its plank “ settles” on 
either side, for some stupendous affair, with columns 
for which all heathenism has been sacked to supply 
the capitals. 
If renovation must be made, it should be made in 
keeping with the original style of the house—except 
indeed change go so far as to divest it altogether of 
the old aspect. In some farm-houses that may be 
taken in hand for repairs, it might be well even to 
strain a point in the direction of antiquity, and to 
replace a swagging door by a stanch one of double- 
battened oak or chestnut, with its wrought nails show 
ing their heads in checkered diamond lines up and 
down, and its hinges, worked into some fanciful pat- 
tern of a dragon’s tail, exposed. Then there should 
be a ponderous iron knocker, whose din should reach 
all over the house, and the iron thumb-latch—not cast 
and japanned, but showing stroke of the hammer, 
and taking on rust where the maid cannot reach with 
her brick-dust. Of course, too, there should be the 
two diamond lights like two great eyes peering from 
under the frontlet of the old-fashioned stoop. All 
these, if the house be so ancient and weather-stained 
as to admit of it, will demonstrate that the occupant 
   
-P-A-G-E-61
  ADVICE FOR LACKLAND. 47 
is among the few who are left in these days of petro- 
leum, who make a merit of homeliness, and cherish 
tenderly its simplest features. If the house be really 
weak in the joints, the sooner it comes down the 
better; but if it has snugness and stiffness and com- 
fort, let not the owner be persuaded of the carpenters 
to graft upon it the modernisms of their tricksy 
joinery. I can well understand how a dashing buck 
of two or three and thirty should prefer a young 
woman in her furbelows, to an old one in her bomb- 
azine; but if the fates put him in leash with an 
ancient lady, let him think twice before he bedizens 
her gray head with preposterous frontlets, and puts a 
mesh of girl’s curls upon the nape of her old neck. 
I have said all this as a prelude to a little talk 
about certain changes which my friend Lackland has 
wrought in his country place—thirty miles away by 
the New Haven road. The house he purchased could 
boast no respectability of age. The height of its 
rooms was of that medium degree which neither sug- 
gested any notion of quaintness nor of airiness. Its 
entrance-hall was pinched and narrow; its stairway 
inhospitably lean, and altogether its appointments 
had that cribbed and confined aspect, which, to one 
used to width and sunshine, was almost revolting. 
The wash-room was positively the only apartment 
below stairs which had a southern aspect. I give his

drawing of it, and it is a good type of a great many 
“small and convenient houses” scattered through our 
country towns. 
     
   
  KITCHEN 
PARLOR 
“Of course, this will never do,” wrote Lackland 
to me, “and yet the skin of*the house (as our car- 
penter calls it) is very good, and I wish to make the 
needed changes, so far as possible, without disturbing 
the exterior outline of the main building. But how 
shall I rid myself of that preposterously narrow en- 
trance-way in which I can almost fancy Mrs. L., (who 
is something large) getting wedged on some warm 
day ? How shall I throw sunlight into that dismal 
parlor? You will perceive that along the whole 
south front there is not a single available window 
below. Now, half the charm of a country place, to 
my notion, lies in the possession of some sunny porch 
upon which the early vines will clamber, and under 
whose eaves the Phebe birds will make their nests,

  ADVICE FOR LACKLAND. 49 
I want, too, my after-dinner lounges at a sunny door, 
where I can smoke my pipe, basking in the yellow 
light, as I watch the shadows chasing over the grass. 
About the stupid little design I send you, there is 
neither hope nor possibility of this. 
“ Again, even with a dining-room, or library 
added, and perhaps a kitchen, I shall be still in want 
of further chamber range, which if I gain (as our 
carpenter suggests) by piling on a story more, it 
appears to me that I should give to the narrow front 
of the house an absurd cock-loft look that would be 
unendurable. 
  “Mrs. L. and myself have scored out an incredible 
number of diagrams—all which have been discussed, 
slept on, admired, and eventually condemned. Some- 
times it is the old pinched entrance way that works

condemnation ; sometimes (on my part) the lack of 
sunny exposure; and oftenest (on hers) the lack of 
closets. She insists that no man yet ever planned a 
house properly on this score. She doesn’t see clearly 
(being deficient in mathematics) why a closet shouldn’t 
be made in every partition wall. She don’t definitely 
understand, I think, why a person should thwack his 
head in a closet under the stairs. She sometimes (our 
carpenter tells us) insists upon putting a window 
through a chimney; and on one occasion (it was 
_Teally a very pretty plan) contrived so as to conduct 
a chimney through the middle of the best bed room ; 
and the nicest scheme of all, to my thinking, posi- 
tively had the stairs left out entirely. 
“Tn this dilemma, I want you to tell us what can 
be done with the old shell, so as to make it passably 
habitable, until we find out if this new passion for 
country life is to hold good.” 
Upon this I ventured to send him.this little plan 
‘of adaptation, which, though not without a good 
many faults that could be obviated in building anew, 
yet promised to meet very many of their wan‘s, and 
gave to Lackland his sunny frontage. 
“Here you have,” I wrote him, “ your south door, 
and porch to lounge upon, and your south bow win- 
dow to your library, which, if the rural tastes grow 
upon you, you can extend into a conservatory, cover-

parlor, too, has its two south windows, and although

the northern side, to the exclusion of the window 
there, yet it seemed best to make use of the flue 
already established. The hall is well lighted from 
the north, and will give room for the hanging of any 
of your great-aunt’s portiaits, if you have any. 
“There is an objection to traversing the dining- 
room in going from the kitchen to the hall-door ; but 
it could not well be obviated, with the existing shell 
of your house, without reducing the size of the dining- 
room too much, or (another resource) without increas- 
ing largely the dimensions of the hall—throwing the 
intervening space between it and kitchen into store

rooms and making the library do duty for the spread 
of your table. 
“The dining-room, moreover, having only north 
exposure, you may condemn as dismal. I propose to 
obviate this and to give it a cheerful south light by 
an extravagance which I dare say the architects will 
condemn, but which will have its novelty and possi- 
ble convenience. 
“The fireplaces of library and of dining-room, are, 
you observe, back to back. Now I would suggest 
that the two fiues be carried up with a sweep to 
either side (uniting in the garret) in such sort, that a 
broad ‘arched opening shall be left above the mantel 
from one room .into the other. This may be draped, 
if you like, with some tasteful upholstery ; but not so 
far as to forbid a broad flow of the warm light from 
the bow window of the library; while upon the 
mantels of even height, you may place a Wardian 
case that shall show its delicate plumes of fern 
between your table and the southern sunlight all 
winter long. It would moreover be quite possible, 
owing to the breadth of partition wall afforded by 
the two flues, to arrange folding shutters for the 
complete closing of the arch-way whenever desired. 
For my own part, I love such little novelties of ar- 
rangement, which mark a man’s house as his own, how- 
«ver much they may put the carpenters to the gape.

“ As for the additional chamber-room, never think 
of putting a third story upon so narrow-throated a: 
house, or you will give it an irredeemable gawkyness. 
If the space be needed, find it by throwing a mansard 
roof over all, and lighting your cock-lofts with dormer 
windows. Then paint with discretion ; avoid white, 
and all shades of lilac—the most abominable color 
that was ever put upon a house—you can’t match the 
flowers, and don’t try, I beg. A mellow brown or a 
cool gray are the best for the principal surfaces. In 
  
  
  the trimmings, study narrowly the gradients of color. 
Let there be no forced contrasts, and no indecisive 
mingling of tones; above all, remember that with

your elevations, you want to aim to reduce the ap- 
parent height ; work in, therefore, as many horizontal 
lines of decisive color as your exterior carpentry will 
allow; give dark hoods, if you will, to your front 
parlor windows, and let the cornice-finish below your 
mansard roof reach well down, and carry dark shad- 
ing. 
“When you are fairly in, I will come and see how 
you look.” 
Lackland’s Gardener. 
ITH his grounds laid out and his house in 
s fairly habitable condition—according to the 
plans already laid before the reader—Lackiand holds 
various consultations in regard to a proper gardener 
—consults as in duty bound, first of all, Mrs. Lack- 
land. 
Mrs. Lackland wishes an industrious, sober man, 
who will keep the walks neat and tidy, who knows 
enough of flowers not to hoe up any of her choice 
annuals,—(whose seeds she dots about in all direc- 
tions, marking the places with fragments of twigs 
thrust in at all possible angles) ; she wishes moreover, 
a good-natured man, who shall be willing to come 
and pot a flower for her at a moment's notice; one 
who will not forget the sweet marjoram or the sage, 
 
-P-A-G-E-69
ADVICE FOR LACKLAND. 56 
and who will not allow the thyme to die in the 
winter. 
He consults the city seedsmen, who refer him to 
a half-dozen of stout men who may be lounging upon 
the barrels in the front of their sales-rooms on almost 
any fine morning in April; but, on entering into 
parley with them, he is so confounded with their 
talk about ranges, and pits, and bottom heat, and 
Pelargoniums, and Orchids, that he withdraws in 
disgust. 
He consults the newspapers, where he finds a con- 
siderable array of advertisements of “ steady, capable 
men, willing to make themselves useful upon a gentle- 
man’s place;” he communicates with some two or 
three of the most promising advertisers, and arranges 
for an interview with them. Lackland has great faith, 
like almost all the men IJ ever met, in his study of 
physiognomy. About a man’s temper or his honesty, 
he can hardly be mistaken, he thinks, if he can once 
set eyes upon him. He is therefore strongly disposed 
in favor of a stout, jolly-faced Irishman, who assures 
him he can grow as good “ vigitables as enny man in 
Ameriky.” 
“ And flowers, Patrick (Patrick O’Donohue is his 
name), you could take care of the flowers ? ” 
“Oh, flowers, and begorra, yis, sir—roses, pinks, 
vi’lets—roses—whativer you wish, sir.” 
Q* 
   
-P-A-G-E-70
56 RURAL STUDIES. 
“ And, Patrick, you could harness a horse some- 
times if it were necessary.” 
“Horses, and indade, yis, sir; ye may jist say ’m 
at home in a stable, sir.” 
“ And the poultry, Patrick, you could look after 
the poultry, couldn’t you? ” 
“ And indade, sir, that’s what I can ; there’s niver 
aman in the counthry can make hens lay as I can 
make ’em lay.” 
In short, Lackland bargains with Patrick, and 
reports him at the home-quarters “a perfect jewel of 
a man.” 
The best of impleinents are provided, and a great 
stock of garden seeds—the choice of the latter being 
determined on after family consultation, in which all 
the vegetables ever heard of by either party to the 
counsel, have been added to the list. If a man have 
a garden, why not enjoy all that a garden can pro- 
duce—egg-plants, and okra, and globe artichokes, and 
salsify, and white Naples radishes, and Brussels 
sprouts? The seed of all these are handed over to 
the willing Patrick, who, as Mrs. Lackland im- 
pressively enumerates the different labels (Patrick 
not being competent to the reading of fine print, 
as he freely confesses), repeats after her, “ Naples 
radish, yis, m’am ; artichokes, yis, m’am; okra, yis, 
mam.” 
   
-P-A-G-E-71
  ADVICE KOR LACKLAND. en 
Lackland provides frames and glass for the early 
salads he covets so much, and Patrick, with the fresh 
sweepings of the stables, has presently a bed all 
asteam. At the mere sight of it the Lacklands regale 
themselves with thoughts of crisp radishes, and the 
mammoth purple fruit of the egg-plants. The seeds 
are all put in—early cabbage, cauliflower, peppers, 
radishes—under the same frame by the judicious 
O’Donohue. The cabbages and the radishes come 
forward with a jump. Their expedition forms a 
pleasant theme for the physiological meditation of 
Lackland. He is delighted with the stable manure, 
with the cabbage seed, and with the O’Donohue. He 
is inclined to think disrespectfully of the seed of 
peppers and of egg plants in the comparison. But 
the bland O’Donohue says, “‘ We must give’em a little 
more hate.” 
And after some three or four days, Lackland is 
stupefied, on one of his visits to his hot bed, to find 
all his fine radishes and cabbages fairly wilted away ; 
there is nothing left of them but a few sun-blackened 
stumps; the peppers and egg-plants show no signs of 
germination. 
“What does all this mean?” says Lackland ; 
“the cabbages are dead, Patrick.” 
“Yis, sir—it’s the hate, sir. The sun is very strong 
here, sir; we must give ’em a little more air, sir.”
-P-A-G-E-72
    58 RURAL STUDIES. 
And they get the air—get the air (by a little for- 
getfulness on the part of Patrick) night as well as 
day; the peppers and egg-plants, after a fortnight 
more of expectation, do not appear. 
“ How’s this, Patrick ? no start yet.” 
“ And are ye sure the seed’s good, sir?” 
“Tes all Thorburn’s seed.” 
“Then, of course, it ought to be good, sir; but, 
ye see, there’s a dale o’ chatery now-a-days, sir.” 
In short, Lackland’s man Patrick is a good-natured 
blunder-head, who knows no better than to submit 
his young cauliflowers and peppers to the same 
atmospheric conditions in the forcing frame. The 
result is that Lackland buys his first salads in the 
market, and his first peas in the market, and his first 
beets in the market. All these creep along very 
slowly under Patrick’s supervision, and the onion seed 
is fairly past hope, being buried too deep for the sun 
to have any influence upon its germinating proper- 
ties. 
“ But how is this,” says the long-suffering Lack- 
land, at last, “ our neighbors are all before us, Pat- 
rick?” 
“ Well, sir, it’s me opinion that the land is a bit 
cowld, sir. Wait till July, sir, and you'll see vigi- 
tables.” 
And Patrick grubs away with a great deal of
-P-A-G-E-73
ADVICE FOR LACKLAND. 59 
misdirected energy—slicing off, in the heat of his 
endeavor, two or three of Mrs. Lackland’s choicest 
rocket larkspurs; whereupon that lady comes down 
upon him with some zeal. 
“Larkspur! and that’s a larkspur, is it, m’am 
(scratching his head reflectingly) ? and, begorra, I 
niver once thought ’twas a larkspur, Pity, pity; and 
so it was, indade, a larkspur? Well, well, but it’s 
lucky it wa’nt a rose-bush, m’am.” 
And yet the good-natured blunder-head in the 
shape of a gardener is far more endurable, to one 
thoroughly interested in country life, than the surly 
fellow who, if he gives you early vegetables, resents 
a suggestion, and who will take a pride in making 
any particular scheme of the proprietor miscarry by 
a studied neglect of its details. 
Upon the whole, I should lay down as sound 
advice for any one who, like Lackland, is beginning 
to establish for himself a home in the country that 
shall be completely enjoyable, the following rules 
with respect to the pursuit and employment of a 
gardener : 
First, if your notion of country enjoyment is 
limited by thought of a good place where you may 
lie down under the trees, and frolic with your chil- 
dren, or smoke a pipe under your vine, or clambering 
rose-tree at evening—find a gardener who is thorough+ 
 
-P-A-G-E-74
    60 RURAL STUDIES. 
ly taught, and who can place upon your table every 
day the freshest and crispest of the vegetables and 
fruits of the season, leaving you no care, but the care 
of bills for superphosphates and trenching. If you 
stroll into his domain of the garden, take your walk- 
ing-stick or your pipe there, if you choose—but never 
a hoe or a pruning knife. Joke with him, if you like, 
but never advise him. Take measure of his fitness by 
the fruits he puts upon your table, the order of your 
grounds, and the total of your bills, If these are 
satisfactory—keep him: if not, discharge him, as you 
would a lawyer who managed your case badly, or a 
doctor who bled or purged you toa sad state of 
depletion. 
If, on the other hand, in establishing a country 
home, you have a wish to identify yourself with its 
growth into fertility and comeliness, in such sort that 
you may feel that every growing shrub is a little 
companion for you and yours—every vine a friend— 
every patch of herbs, of vegetables, or of flowers, an 
aid to the common weal and pleasures of home, in 
which you take, and will never cease to take, a per- 
sonal interest and pride—if all this be true, and you 
have as good as three hours a day to devote to per- 
sonal superintendence—then, by all means, forswear 
all gardeners who come to you with great recom- 
mendations of their proficiency. However just these 
 
-P-A-G-E-75
  ADVICE FOR LACKLAND. 61 
may be, all their accomplishments, ten to one, will be 
‘only a grievance to you. It is far better, if you be 
really in earnest to taste ruralities to the full, to find 
some honest, industrious fellow—not unwilling to be 
taught—who will lend a cheerful hand to your efforts 
to work out the problem of life in the country for 
yourself. 
You will blunder; but in such event you will 
enjoy the blunders. You will burn your young cab- 
bages, but you will know better another year. Your 
first grafts will fail, but you will find out why they 
fail. You will put too much guano to your sweet 
corn, but you will have a pungent agricultural fact 
made clear to you. You will leave your turnips and 
beets standing too thickly in the rows; but you will 
learn by the best of teaching—never to do so again. 
You will buy all manner of fertilizing nostrums—and 
of this it may require a year or two to cure you. 
You will believe in every new grape, or strawberry, 
—and of this it may require many years to cure you. 
You will put faith, at the first, in all the horticultural 
advices you find in the newspapers,—and of this you 
will speedily be cured. 
In short, whoever-is serious about this matter, of 
taking a home in the country (if his rural taste be a 
native sentiment, and not a whim), should abjure the 
presence of a surly master in the shape of a gardener,
-P-A-G-E-76
  62 RURAL STUDIES. 
who can tell him how the Duke of Buccleugh (or any 
other) managed such matters. 
God manages all of nature’s growth and bloom in 
such way, that every earnest man with an observant 
eye can so far trace the laws of His Providence, as to 
insure to himself a harvest of fruit, or grain, or 
flowers. And whatever errors may be made are only 
so many instructors, to teach, and to quicken love by 
their lesson. 
Let us not then despair of our friend Lackland, 
though his cabbages are burnt, and his beets are 
behind the time. I shall visit him again, and trust 
that I may find his verbenas and lilies in bloom, 
though his larkspurs have been cut down. 
A Pig and a Cow. 
PROPOSE an odd horticultural subject ; but the 
man who plants a garden, and builds a cottage, 
and carries in his thought the hope of shaking off the 
dust of the city under green trees upon his own 
sward-land, where some—nameless party—in white 
lawn, with blue ribbon of a sash (as in Mr. Irving’s 
pretty picture of a wife), stands ready to greet him, 
after an hour of torture at the hands of our humane 
railroad directors—the man, I say, who looks forward 
to all this, and enters upon the experience, thinks,
-P-A-G-E-77
ADVICE FOR LACKLAND. 63 
sooner or later, of a cow and a pig—the pig to con- 
sume the waste growth of his garden, and the cow to 
supply such tender food for his growing ones as they 
most need. 
The pig can hardly be regarded as a classic ani- 
mal; Virgil, indeed, introduces him as crunching 
acorns under elm-trees—which account I cannot help 
reckoning as apocryphal. But he is a very jolly and 
frisky little animal in his young days, not without a 
good deal of clumsy grace in his movements, and 
showing a most human zeal for the full end of the 
trough. 
There is almost the same diversity of opinion with 
respect to the different races of pigs, which our horti- 
cultural friends indulge in with respect to fruits. It 
is always an awkward matter to discuss the merits of 
different families, whether of animals who talk, or 
animals who only grunt or bellow. If the raw sub- 
urban resident, in whose interest I make these notes, 
has an ambition to rear a prize hog that shall out- 
weigh anything his neighbors can show, and intends 
to keep his bin full of rank material, I should cer- 
tainly advise the great-boned Chester County race, 
which, with judicious feeding, come to most elephan- 
tine proportions. If, on the other hand, he should 
prefer a dapper, snug-jointed beast, that shall not be 
particular in regard to food, and which will yield him

cutlets in which the muscular material shall not be 
utterly overlaid and lost in fatty adipose matter, I 
should counsel the sleek Berkshire. Or if, uniting the 
two, he should desire a delicate limbed, well-rounded, 
contented little animal, that shall browse with equa- 
namity upon the purslane and the spare beet-tops 
from his garden, I know none safer to commend than 
the Suffolks. Nor is it essential that he be thorough 
bred, since the tokens of pur sang are a red baldness, 
and a possible twisting away of the beast’s own tail, 
which do not contribute to good looks.* 
All this is but preparatory to my reply to Lack- 
land, who writes to me: “ We have voted to have a 
pig and a cow; what kinds shall I get, and how shall 
I keep them, and what shall I do with them?” 
And I wrote back to him: “Buy what the dealers 
will sell you for a Suffolk; if he lack somewhat in 
purity of blood (as he probably will), don’t be punc- 
tilious in the matter. Let his sleeping and eating 
quarters be high and dry; and if you can manage 
beyond this a little forage ground for him to disport 
himself in, and wallow (if he will) on wet days—so 
much the better. The forage, if you keep him sup-

plied with raw material in the shape of muck, or old 
turfs from your hedge-rows, will add largely to your 
compost heap, and in this way he will make up any 
possible sacrifice in his flesh. Miss Martineau, I 
know, in her ‘Two Acre Farming,’ advises severe 
cleanliness ; and if the only aim were a roaster for 
your table and accumulation of fat, there might be 
virtue in the recommendation. But a pig’s work 
among your turfs is worth half of his pork. He will 
thrive very likely upon the waste from your table and 
your garden. But, against any possible shortness of 
food supply, it were well to provide a bag of what 
the grain people will sell you as ‘ship stuff;’ and 
this, stirred into the kitchen wash, will make an 
unctuous holiday gruel for your little beast, for which 
he will be clamorously grateful. 
“ Again; the stye should be convenient to the 
garden (a hemlock spruce or two will shut off the 
sight of it, and a sweet honey-suckle subdue the odors 
of it) ; then you may throw over chance bits of purs- 
lane, or the suckers from your sweet corn, or a gone- 
by salad, and find thanks in the noisy smacking of his 
chops. I would not give a fig for a country house 
where no such homely addenda are allowed, and 
where a starched air of propriety must always reign, 
to the complete exclusion of every stray weed, and to 
the exclusion of the rollicking Suffolk grunter in its

corner, who squeals his entreaty, and declares thanks 
with the click-clack of his active jaws. 
“ He will take on larger and clumsier proportions 
month by month, and will be none the worse for the 
occasional carding which your zealous Irishman can 
afford him in spare hours; and when, in the month 
of October or November, the waste growth of the 
garden is abating, and the frost has nipped the bean- 
tops, and laid your tomatoes in a black sprawl upon 
the ground, your Suffolk (with, say, one or two addi- 
tional bags of mixed feed) should be ripe for the 
knife. 
“ My advice, at this conjuncture, would be—sell 
him to the butcher. Those who like pig flesh better 
would give you rules for cut and curing. But, while 
Ihave considerable respect for the pork family when 
fairly afoot and showing grateful appreciation of the 
delights of life and of a full trough, I have very little 
consideration for the same animals when baked or 
stewed. Charles Lamb’s pleasant eulogium on roast 
pig is one of the most terrible instigators of indiges- 
tion that I know; and I want no better theory for 
that charming writer’s occasional periods of bitter 
despondency, than to suppose him to have dined ‘ at 
seven, sharp,’ upon the dish he has so pleasantly and 
fearfully extolled.

made in favor of a good rasher of bacon at breakfast, 
with a fresh egg (from the cock—as a city friend 
once suggested in a flow of cheery, rural exuberance) ; 
nor do I think anything can be righteously said 
against a snug bit of clear pork in a dish of boiled 
corned brisket of beef; nay, I would still further 
extend the exception to a crisp fry of delicate slices 
as an accompaniment of grilled trout, where the latter 
fall below a half-pound in weight; nor do I think 
great harm of a thin blanket of the same condiment 
to enwrap a roasted quail, or slivers of it to enlard 
delicately a fricandeau of veal. But, as for pork 
chops, or pork roast, or pork boiled, to be eaten as 
the chief piece nutritive of a dinner—it is an abomi- 
nation! Our friends the Jews have not only Scrip- 
tural reason in the thing, but reasons physiological. 
“ And now, my dear fellow, having despatched 
your pig (who should be bought for five or six dollars 
at seven weeks old, and should be sold at twenty— 
from the growth of your garden and a splicing bag 
of ship stuff), you will have, if you have used proper 
vigilance, some three to four loads of choice compost 
to contribute to the vegetable growth of the next 
season. There isa notion that manure from such a 
source provokes the growth of club-foot in cabbages 
and cauliflowers; but after repeated trials with a 
view to fix this averment, I am unable to do so.

Club-foot is not lacking with awkward frequency ; 
but appears quite as often, so far as my experience 
goes, with other fertilizers as with that from the pig 
stye. A good liming and fresh-turned soil are, so far 
as I can determine, the best preventives. Another 
precaution, which, in my view, should never be neg- 
lected, is to remove and destroy at once all plants 
which show symptoms of this ailment. 
“The cow is a more tractable subject. Of course, 
you wish one that never kicks, that any one can milk, 
that will not resent indignities, and will yield you all 
the milk and the butter you need, and possibly the 
cheese. 
“T remember that a city gentleman of great horti- 
cultural (and other) ability called upon me not many 
years ago, and after descanting upon the absurdity 
of planting two acres for a crop which could be easily 
grown from half an acre, he asked me how many 
quarts of milk my cows averaged per diem? ‘ Four- 
teen to fifteen quarts,’ said I, ‘in the flush season.’ 
“*But that is very small,’ said he; ‘there is no 
more reason why you should not have cows giving 
twenty to twenty-four quarts a day, than why you 
should not have strawberries giving two quarts to 
the plant.’

horticulturists that blinds me even to their wildest 
assertions. What has an humble cultivator to do, or 
to say, in the presence of a man who has bagged his 
premiums at a New York Horticultural Society, and 
is taster ex-officio at the Farmer’s Club ? 
“T did not argue the matter with him; I sub- 
mitted ; I acknowledged my mediocrity humbly. 
“Now, my dear fellow, there are cows which 
yield their twenty to twenty-five quarts a day, but 
they are very exceptional. Many such, whose private 
history I have known, have been fed upon their own 
milk with the cream taken off. This involves, as you 
will admit, I think, a quick reconversion of capital, 
which, with children in the family, is not always 
practicable. 
“Tn a general way, I should say, it would be far 
safer to count upon an average of twelve to fifteen 
quarts per day, even with the best of care. And as 
regards your actual purchase of an animal, I dare say 
you will have Wall Street friends, who will talk 
grandly of the short horns, and suggest some Daisy, 
(1397, A. H. B.,) at a cost of six or seven hundred 
dollars, and—viewing her pedigree—cheap at that. 
My advice to you is, don’t buy any such, unless you 
intend to turn breeder, and enter the lists with the 
herd book people. I say this, not because the short- 
horns are not admirable animals; but admirable ani-

mals are not always the best domestic animals,—as 
some of your recently married friends may possibly 
be able to testify. 
“ But a man who, like yourself, comes to the 
country for a leisurely enjoyment of all country boun- 
ties, does not wish an animal that must invariably be 
kept under the best possible condition ; he wishes a 
docile, adaptable creature. Even a snug native beast 
might meet all the ends you would have in view, 
without figuring largely upon the cash book. 
“ Or, still better, a sleek Ayrshire, that shall carry 
in her air and horn a little show of better breeding 
and full returns to the milk pail. But if you have a 
fancy for cream that is fairly golden, and for occa- 
sional conversion of excess of milk into a little paté 
of golden butter, nothing will suit your purpose bet- 
ter than a dainty Alderney, with her fawn-like eyes 
and yellow skin. 
“T am aware that the short-horn people—who can 
see nothing good in a cow, except her figure show 
mathematical straightness of line from tail to the set- 
ting of her horn—sneer at the comparatively diminu- 
tive Alderneys. It is true, moreover, that there may 
be in them a hollow of the back, and an undue droop 
to the head, and possibly an angular projection of the 
hip-bones; but their nose is of the fineness of a 
fawn’s, their eyes bright and quick as a doe’s; their

skin soft and silken, and with a golden hue (if of 
good family), which gives best of promise for the 
cream-pot. Above all they have a tractability which, 
in a domestic pet, is a most admirable quality. ‘Spot,’ 
(the black and white Alderney,) the children can 
fondle; she can be tethered to a stake upon the lawn, 
and will feed as quietly as if she were in a field of 
lucerne: she is grateful for a bonne bouche from the 
garden, and takes it from the hand as kindly as a 
dog. This docility is a thing of great consequence 
upon a little country place where every animal is 
made more or less of a pet. It is not every cow that 
will bear tethering upon a lawn; there are those 
indeed who can never be taught to submit to the 
confinement. The sleek Alderneys inherit a capacity 
for this thing, and I have seen upon the green 
orchards near to St. Hiliers, (Isle of Jersey,) scores 
of them, each cropping its little circlets of turf as 
closely and cleanly as if it had been shorn. In way 
of convenience for this service, it is well to have an 
old harrow tooth with a ring adjusted to its top, 
and revolving freely, upon which ring an iron swivel 
should be attached. To such a fixture, easily moved, 
and made fast in the ground by a blow or two of a 
wooden mallet, a halter may be tied without fear of 
any untwisting of the rope, or of any winding up or 
other entrapment of the poor beast. I give these 
 
-P-A-G-E-86

hints because it is often convenient to furnish a pet 
cow, from time to time, some detached feeding ground, 
where the shrubbery will not admit of free rambling ; 
and there are none whose habit is better adapted to 
such indulgence upon the lawn than the Alderneys. 
“If your cow be kept up constantly for stall-feed- 
ing, an earthen floor is desirable, and by all means a 
half hour’s run in the barn yard of a morning. A 
darkened shed will be a great luxury to her in fly 
time, and will largely promote the quiet under which 
she works out the most bountiful returns from the 
succulent food of the garden. A bit of ground in 
lucerne—say four rods square (it should be in drills 
and kept hoed the first season)—will yield an enor- 
mous amount of food material, and if convenient to 
the stall, your children will delight in binding it up 
in little sheaves for “Moolly.” If such a bit of 
ground be so situated as to admit of an occasional 
sprinkling with liquid manure, five good cuts in a 
season may be safely counted on; nor do I know any 
summer herbage which cows love better. Remember 
furthermore, that the lucerne, as well as corn fodder, 
is improved by a half day’s wilting before being 
fed. In winter, the carrots and mangel wurtzel will 
become avyaijable; both of which any cow may be 
taught to love, (if teaching be necessary,) by giving 
them a good sprinkling of meal. In the change from

summer to winter diet, and from winter to summer, 
it must be remembered that all sudden changes from 
great succulence to dry food, or vice versa, is to be 
most cautiously avoided. Lack of care on this score, 
is the secret of half the cow ailments. 
“Tf I were to lay down a pleasant and productive 
winter dietary for your Alderney, it would be a peck 
of sliced roots in the morning, not forgetting a lock 
of sweet hay; at noon, a quart or two of brewer’s 
grains and fresh water ad libitum ; at night, a warm 
pailful of drink, into which a quart of coarsely ground 
buckwheat meal shall have been stirred, and another 
lock of sweet hay in way of nightcap. 
“With such food, and an occasional combing, at 
the hands of Patrick, (all the better if daily,) I think 
you may count upon such golden returns of cream as 
will bring back a taste of the grassy spring-time.” 
Thus much for Lackland’s Pig and Cow. 
On Gateways. 
HAVE often wondered why the professional 
writers on landscape gardening have so little to 
say of gateways. Among the more pretentious 
authors of this class I find sketches of gate-lodges, 
very charming in their details, many of them; but I 
find little or no mention of those modest gates which 
4
-P-A-G-E-88
  "4 RURAL STUDIES. 
must hang at every man’s door-yard—those unpre- 
tending swinging barriers, by which every country 
house-holder is shut off from the world, and by which 
he is joined to the world. They may be made to give 
a good deal of expression to a place; they have 
almost as much to do with it, in fact, as a man’s 
mouth has to do with the expression of his face. 
There was once a gate called “ Beautiful,” by 
which a lame man lay—we all remember that; there 
was once too a certain “ wicket-gate” (with a great 
light shining somewhere beyond it) which Evan- 
gelist pointed out to Christian, whereby the pilgrim 
might enter upon the path to the Celestial City—we 
all remember that gate ; and there was another gate, 
belonging to our days of roundabouts and satchels, by 
which we went out, noon and morning, by which we 
returned, noon and evening—on which we swung 
upon stolen occasions—a gate whereat we loitered 
with other philosophers, in other roundabouts and 
with other green satchels, and discussed problems of 
marbles, or base-ball, or of the weather,—a gate 
through which led the path to the first home ; well, I 
think everybody remembers such a gate. And thus 
it happens that the subject has a certain poetic and 
romantic interest which cannot be wholly ignored, 
and which I wonder that the landscapists have so 
indifferently treated,
-P-A-G-E-89
  ADVICE FOR LACKLAND. 15 
Fancy, if you can, a rural home,—without its gate- 
way—lying all abroad upona common! The great 
charm of privacy is gone utterly ; and no device of 
shrubbery, or hedge, can make good the loss of some 
little wicket which will invite approach, and be a 
barrier against too easy familiarity. The creak of 
the gate-hinge is a welcome to the visitor, and as he 
goes out, the latch clicks an adieu. 
But there are all sorts of gates, as there are all 
sorts of welcomes; there is, first, your inhospitable 
one, made mostly, I should say, of matched boards, 
with a row of pleasant iron spikes running along its 
top, and no architectural decorations of pilaster or 
panel can possibly remove its thoroughly inhospitable 
aspect. It belongs to stable-courts or jail-yards, but 
never to a home or to a garden. 
Again, there are your ceremonious gates, of open- 
work indeed, but ponderous, and most times scrupu- 
lously closed ; the very opening of them is a fatigu- 
ing ceremonial, and there is nothing like a lively wel- 
come in the dull clang of their ponderous latches. 
Next, there is your simple, unpretending, rural 
gate, giving promise of unpretending rural beauties— 
homely in all its aspect, and giving foretaste of the 
best of homeliness within. And I make a wide dis- 
tinction here between the simple rurality at which I 
have hinted, and that grotesqueness which is com-

passed by scores of crooked limbs and knots wrought 
into labyrinthine patterns, which puzzle the eye, more 
  than they please. All crooked things are not neces- 
sarily charming, and the better kind of homeliness is 
measured by something besides mere roughness. 
Lastly, there is your hospitable gate, with its little 
rooflet stretched over it, as if to invite the stranger 
loiterer to partake at his will of that much of the 
hospitalities of the home. Even the passing beggar 
gathers his tattered garments under it in a sudden 
shower and blesses the shelter. And I introduce upon ° 
the next page a very homely specimen of this class of 
gates, which I remember to have sketched many 
years ago somewhere in County Kent, England. 
Hither my own pencillings were very bad, or else 
the engraver has failed to give the character of its 
rough rooflet ; which, if I remember. rightly, was but 
 
-P-A-G-E-91
  ADVICH FOR LACKLAND. a4 
a thatch of broom, or of sedge. Yet who does not 
see written all over it—plain as it is: Loiter if you 
like! Come in, if you like! And I love to think that 
  some little maid, under it—in some by-gone year— 
said her good-night to some parting Leander. Who 
shall laugh at this, that has ever been young? Are 
not the little maids and the Leanders always growing 
up about us? I always felt sure when I found such 
covered wickets that no curmudgeon lived within. 
A second example of somewhat more orderly pro- 
portions, but identical in expression, I take from my 
note-book of travel, finding it credited to some little 
hamlet of Warwickshire; the posts and supporting 
arms being of unhewn elm, and the roof a neat thatch 
of wheat straw, which at the time of my visit was 
gray and mossy. 
Has not somebody somewhere a cottage home, 
whose homeliness would be enforced and beautified 
by such a cosy covered wicket of thatch ?
-P-A-G-E-92
  78 RURAL STUDIES. 
Thatch, indeed, does not take on with us, and 
  under our climate, that mellow mossiness which be- 
longs to it in Devonshire. Our winds are too high 
and drying, and the sun too hot. Still, a thatch pro- 
perly laid will, with us, keep its evenness for a great 
number of years; and for the benefit of those living 
within easy reach of the coast, I may say that nothing 
is better for this :purpose than the sedge (so called) 
of the salt. marshes. 
In default of thatch, however, very pretty rural 
effects may be made by slabs (being log-trimmings 
from the saw-mills), or oak bark (which is almost 
imperishable), or by scolloped shingles. 
An example of the effect of these latter I venture 
to give. 
In this case, all beneath the roof is of cedar with 
the bark undisturbed, while the posts above the roof 
are trimmed to a square, tapering and carrying a ball 
—the balls and the tapering extremities of the posts
-P-A-G-E-93
ADVICE FOR LACKLAND. 49 
being painted white, and the roof red. The effect is 
exceedingly good—though it mixes the rustic and 
  more finished work in a way which the professional 
artists do not venture upon. But I have lived long 
enough to know that professional traditions in all the 
arts—landscape gardening and architecture among 
the rest—stand in the way of a great many beauties. 
Every country-place wants its special art-garniture 
(without respect to traditions) as much as every 
pretty face wants its special environment of colors 
and of laces. When, therefore, I hear a man declaim 
against white gates, or red gates, or rustic gates, or 
stone gates, per se, without reference to their position,
-P-A-G-E-94
  80 RURAL STUDIES. 
or suggestive aims, I condemn him as an iron method- 
ist, who apprehends no beauty by intuition, but only 
by force of precept. 
Perhaps I have myself rather hastily condemned 
all close gates, as belonging to stable-courts and jail- 
yards. There are situations, certainly, where they 
are not only allowable, (as upon back-entrances of 
gardens,) but where they contribute eminently to the 
air of privacy which must mark every true home. 
And I am reminded, in this connection, of a certain 
garden-door-way, which I saw near Keightley, in 
Yorkshire ; it opened upon a narrow lane in the rear 
              
  of the suburban grounds to which it was attached, 
and showed such homely, resolute determination to 
work up into tasteful shape the stones abounding in 
the neighborhood, that I made a rough draught of it 
upon the spot. 
This picturesque use of rock material is appre- 
ciated and practised in many parts of Great Britain. 
Thus in the neighborhood of the slate quarries of
-P-A-G-E-95
  ADVICE FOR LACKLAND. 81 
North Wales, near Caernarvon, the refuse material 
from the ledges is laid up by the adjoining proprie- 
tors in snug fences, that appear at a little distance 
away, to be crowned with a regularly castellated bat- 
tlement. This effect is produced simply by alternat- 
ing cubical and oblong fragments of slate rock upon 
the summit of the wall. 
In Derbyshire, again, I have seen a kindred effect 
wrought by the tasteful disposition of the big boulders 
which are scattered pretty thickly over some of the 
high moorlands of that country. In Cumberland and 
Westmoreland, indications of the same rural adaptive- 
ness abound. 
Thus much has been suggested at present by our 
friend Lackland’s request that I should supply for him 
the plan of a gate. We will now see what can be 
done for his special needs. 
. Gateways and Rural Carpentry. 
fe turning back to page of ground plan, the 
reader will perceive, from the drawing of my ~ 
friend Lackland’s grounds, that he has need of three 
principal gateways—a small one for the footpath, 
being the entrance nearest to the village; a larger 
one for his drive, and a third opening for his grass 
field. This last he will not have very frequent occa- 4*
-P-A-G-E-96
  82 RURAL STUDIES. 
sion to use; for that reason the gateway should not 
be very striking, or seem specially to invite entrance. 
Supposing that the occupant has availed himself of 
the old walls about the premises to build a substan- 
tial stone fence along a considerable portion of his 
front, I should advise that he mark this field entrance 
by two substantial columns built of the same material, 
and place between them a gate or movable panel of 
fence, constructed of cedar poles, or such other 
homely or lasting wood as may be most available. 
I give a rough drawing of what I would propose. 
  I think that everyone will admit that these col- 
umns have a tasteful effect, and add largely to the 
architectural character of the wall. And it is a great 
mistake to suppose, as many do, that such columns 
require hammered stone, or that it is requisite that 
they be laid up in mortar, and by an adept in mason- 
ry. All that is required is, that stones carrying fairly 
developed angles should be laid aside for its con- 
struction—that the face of the column should project 
three or four inches from the surface of the wall in
-P-A-G-E-97
ADVICE FOR LACKLAND. 83 
order to mark distinctly its faces, and that it be 
bound in firmly, (a thing which the engraver has 
omitted to do,) with such long stones as are available. 
A boulder sufficiently round to crown the structure 
may be found in almost any rod of old country wall; 
and if it be well covered with lichens, so much the 
_ better. The great error in such attempts, is in at- 
tempting too great nicety, which, by contrast with 
the homely farmwork around it, offends more than it 
gratifies. In humble art, as well as in the highest 
art, there must be keeping. 
But though finical nicety is to be avoided, and 
such hammering out of faces, as to increase largely 
the expense, and defeat the economy which should 
declare itself unmistakably in all rural decoration, 
there should be no sacrifice of solidity. A column 
that will not stand for years, had better never be 
built. 
The country wall-layers, ordinarily, are indisposed 
to attempt such work, either doubting their own 
capacity, or considering it an encroachment upon the 
province of the mason. The consequence has been, 
in my own experience, that of some half-dozen or 
more which stand here and there about the fields at 
Edgewood, every one has been laid up with my own 
hands; and I may aver, with some pride, that after 
eight or ten winters of frost, they still stand firmly 
 
-P-A-G-E-98
    84 RURAL STUDIES. 
and compact. One only has lost its capping boulder, 
which certain errant boys could not resist the temp- 
tation to tumble off, that they might watch its roll 
down a pretty declivity of a hundred rods, or more. 
I wish I had no more grievous charges to bring 
against errant boys. 
For the entrance to the drive-way, supposing that 
my friend Lackland has plenty of cedar at hand, I 
give another design: 
  And I have this much to say in favor of it, that « 
similar one was erected at Edgewood eleven yearz 
since, and its gates have swung back and forth a 
dozen times a day, without, as yet, a single hammer’s 
stroke in way of repair. 
The dotted lines upon the right half of the gate
-P-A-G-E-99
  ADVICE FOR LACKLAND. 85 
indicate two half-inch iron rods, which were passed 
through and fastened by a nut upon the longer up- 
right sapling. Once or twice it has been necessary 
to give this nut a turn or two with the wrench, and 
this completes the tale of the attention it has re- 
quired. 
The first panel (and part of the second) of the 
fence to which it is attached, is given to show its 
relation to its surroundings, and the perfect simplicity 
of detail which belongs to it. The posts are firm 
and cannot swag. The gates are light—perfectly 
braced, and held in place by the iron rods which pass 
through them. They bid fair to last until the sap 
portion of the wood (cedar) is fairly rotted away. 
The three horizontal arms are inserted ‘with tenons ; 
the braces are fitted only with the gouge, and made 
fast with wire nails. And here I wish to enter a 
plea for the wire nails, used all over the continent of 
Europe, but, as yet, little known with us; though, I 
believe, they are to be found in the larger hardware

(and a half-inch in length) to that corresponding to 
our “ten pennies,” and lighter by two-thirds than 
these. 
  The third gate is equally simple, and in way of 
ornamentation, has only its little rooflet. The de- 
sign represents this as of equal width with the 
gate; but a somewhat better effect may be secured 
by an extension of the roof some six or eight inches 
on either side, in which case, of course, the posts 
must be cut off even with the ridge, and finials of 
cedar sticks adjusted at either end. This bit of roof 
over the gateway gives. not only the hospitable air, 
which I remarked upon in the previous chapter, but 
serves to protect the rustic work from the weather to 
such a degree that the bark will hold fast for double 
the length of time. In all such work, great annoy- 
ance is given by an insect which devours the sapwood

  ADVICE FOR LACKLAND. 87 
under the bark, thus loosening the latter, and filling 
it with an ugly yellow powder. I have observed, in 
my own experience, that the ravages of this insect are 
much more decided and constant upon cedar cut in 
the winter, than upon such as has been cut in the 
growing season of the year. The fact, however, may 
be accidental, and I must confess utter ignorance of 
the habits and tastes of this disagreeable grub. 
The virtue of all such rustic work as I have com- 
mented upon, lies in its exceeding simplicity, joined 
to great serviceableness. Home repairs do not tell 
badly on it; the joints need not be arranged with 
mathematical precision; the materials are near at 
hand and inexpensive ; the creeping vines cling to it 
lovingly ; it wears age with a veteran sturdiness. 
Iam by no means prepared to say that my friend 
Lackland will adopt my views on this head. I sus- 
pect that his country or city joiner, when confronted 
with the hints I have thrown out in these gate 
sketches, (they are really intended for nothing more 
than hints), will shake his head doubtfully, and lay 
before my friend some stupendous affair of carpentry, 
with an infinitude of mouldings, which, to his eye, is 
vastly finer. And I shall expect Lackland to yield to 
the charm of the rectangular elevations that are set 
before him; or, if he absolutely insists upon the 
working up of what stray cedars, or other wood, may 
 
-P-A-G-E-102
    88 RURAL STUDIES. 
be about the premises, I shall expect his carpenter to 
make such a bugbear of the exuding pitch, and of the 
impossibility of bringing his square and his gauge 
into requisition, and (if he goes on) to keep so reso- 
lutely by a determination to counterfeit, as far as 
possible, all the mouldings of his joiner work, that he 
will construct a cumbrous affair, at such great cost 
of labor, as will disgust my friend Lackland, and at 
such cost of simplicity as will disgust every tastefal 
observer. 
What then? There can be no doubt of the pos- 
sibility of working this unruly material into tasteful 
forms, that shall have practical and economic uses ; 
but in the ordering of this matter, as in the ordering 
of a great many others, connected with rural life, if 
the proprietor can put no zeal into his intention, and 
has no eye for the charms of homeliness, let him 
abandon the pursuit. A good fence of white pickets, 
with gate to match, will keep the pigs out, and the 
young Lacklands in. 
Village and Country Road-side. 
VERY Christian dweller, in village or in coun- 
try, owes a duty to his road-side ; which, if he 
neglects, he relapses—horticulturally speaking—into 
heathenism. This duty is to maintain order and neat-
-P-A-G-E-103
  ADVICE FOR LACKLAND. 89 
ness; and he is no more relieved of this duty because 
the highway is assigned over to public uses, than 
he is relieved of any other duty whose accom- 
plishment must of necessity contribute to the public 
convenience and public education, as well as to his 
own. Because my front entry is shared, for all legit- 
imate purposes, with my friends and chance callers, 
shall I therefore treat it with neglect and allow the 
dust and cobwebs to accumulate about it, while I 
ensconce myself churlishly in my well-swept den? 
Yet, every visitor—unless he be a vagabond fruit- 
stealer, or an equally vagabond bird-killer—comes up 
the road-way, and if you choose to put him through a 
course of scorie, and old tins, and tansy tufts, and 
briary heaps of stones along your road-side, you 
might as benevolently and as prudently, (so far as the 
growing tastes of your children are concerned,) lead 
him up to your front door between piles of gaping 
clam shells. There is no rule of order, or of taste, or 
of benevolence, that belongs to a man’s door-yard, 
that does not belong to his road-side. 
It is true, there is a liability outside the fence to 
the incursions of road-menders, who are, for the most 
part, barbarians ; but there is no more reason for not 
covering or removing the odious traces of these ani- 
mals, than for not removing the disagreeable traces 
of others. An ugly yellow scar in the turfy mound

that supports, maybe, your garden wall, by due atten- 
tion, and a shovel full or two of fresh mould, can be 
thoroughly obliterated; but if submitted to the 
swash of the rains, it gapes and throws off a great 
ooze of yellow mud, which, next spring time, tempts 
the foraging shovel of the road-menders again, and in 
a few years your whole road-side is a disorderly line 
of jagged earth-pits, with raw boulders clustering at 
the front of each. A little timely care, often repeated, 
may at last win upon the regard of the barbarian fol- 
lowers of the scraper and hoe, and they may grow 
unwittingly into a respect for your love of order 
Such miracles are subject of record. A safer alter- 
native, however, if your road-side be no more exten- 
sive than that of my friend Lackland, is to supply, 
at your own cost, an occasional defect in the road-bed 
from the screenings of the coal, or the rakings of the 
garden, by which you may easily secure so even and 
compact a surface, as to escape the attention of the 
road viewers. If, on the other hand, the reach be 
long, an arrangement can sometimes be made with 
the select-men to keep its whole extent in perfect 
condition, for a sum which, if it be small, will be 
remunerative in the exemption it gives. 
I say sometimes such convention may be estab- 
lished by an order-loving individual, but not always. 
Your true old-style representative of a select-man

always scents some party bargain, or sly scheme in 
such a proposition—most of all if the proposals run 
below current rates. Indeed, if it were desirable for 
prudential reasons to keep the world from revolving 
as it does, I think the matter (if feasible) could be 
most safely entrusted to the “ select-men ” of a coun- 
try town. I do not know any better types of old 
fogyism than the average of black-coated select-men, 
who will meet ten evenings to discuss a nine-penny 
bridge, and spend six months of consideration upon 
the opening of six rods of new highway. If the 
Pacific Railway is ever completed, (as I hope it may 
be,) I would suggest that a committee of “ select- 
men” from our country towns (with a change of 
linen and the last week’s paper) be put through on 
the first car,—in the hope of opening their eyes to at 
least one current fact of the age. I am sometimes 
tortured with the notion that after twenty years of 
spectacled observation, (I do not yet wear spectacles,) 
and after twenty years of voting the “rig’lar ” ticket, 
I may become a candidate for the office of select-man. 
The thought oppresses me like a night-mare. 
To return to road-side,—I know nothing which 
contributes more to that air of thrift, which should 
belong to every country township, than neat and 
orderly road-sides ; and when I say neat and orderly, 
I do not mean any finical arrangement of turf, or clip-

    92 RURAL STUDIES. 
ping of the road-track, but only such judicious comb- 
ing down of unsightly roughnesses, such watchful- 
ness against encumbrance, such adaptation of exist- 
ing shade trees, or such planting of others, as shall 
show that the adjoining proprietor does not limit his 
charities by his own walls, or his eye for neatness by 
the line of highway. 
Once upon a time, when the writer was in search of 
a country homestead, he remembers deciding against 
certain “ strongly recommended ” places, because the 
highroad to them led through a considerable ar- 
ray of suburban houses, whose occupants made it a 
religious duty to throw all their offal in the public 
street, and to cumber the same locality with their 
hoop-poles, or their wood-piles, or their shoe-parings. 
It is so hard to unlearn such a noisome depravity of 
taste! Many of the small towns on the banks of the 
Hudson (near to New York) and in New Jersey, 
offer an extended exhibition of this sort of local econ- 
omy and fragrant treasures. And I have sometimes 
thought that New York citizens, by reason of the 
offal in their streets, become quite agreeably wonted 
to such disposition of cast-away bones and filth, and 
scent it, upon their drives to their country homes, 
with an appetizing relish. But in the name of all 
true rural delight, I beg to enter protest, and to urge 
every man who has his homestead under green trees,
-P-A-G-E-107
  ADVICE FOR LACKLAND. 93 
to use what influence may lie in him (albeit he is not 
select-man) to abate the nuisance, and to make our 
village and country road-sides smack of order and 
thrift and cleanliness. Good example will do very 
much in way of reform—more, in most instances, than 
any zeal of preachment. If you approach an old- 
school neighbor, who has inherited the propensity to 
cumber the highway before his door with all conceiv- 
able odds and ends, with any suggestions for a change 
on the score of neatness or good looks, you will find 
him, very likely, fortified with his own “idees” on 
that subject—“ idees,” which, like the independent 
American citizen that he is, he is in no mood to 
relinquish. 
“He can’t git a livin by looks,” and with such 
speech shrewdly uttered, and emphasized with a rat- 
tling horse-laugh, he floors your blandest sugges- 
tions. Yet a wholesome attention to neatness on 
your own score, which shall creep up to the edge of 
his enclosures, and work by contrast, will in time 
operate insensibly upon him.—There is something 
after all “‘ very catching ” in good order. 
But most of all, the co-operation of all the town’s 
people, who are disposed to neatness, is to be relied 
upon. Every country place of any size should have 
its “ village-improvement society,” to look after the 
planting of shade trees, the proper condition of high- 
   
-P-A-G-E-108
  94 RURAL STUDIES. 
ways, the arrest of stray cattle, and to discuss and 
earry into execution whatever may promote the thrift 
and attractive appearance of the place,—whether in 
the way of new streets, laying down of side-walks, 
or removal of offensive debris or noxious weeds. I 
commend most heartily to Lackland the instigation 
and establishment of such a society. And if sucha 
club could have their little room for occasional meet- 
ing, and stock it with a few valuable horticultural 
and agricultural books and papers, so much the 
better. An entirely new air might be given to very 
many of our slatternly country villages in a few years, 
by the energetic operations of such a club, and the 
value and attractiveness of property be correspond- 
ingly increased. 
Most of the North-eastern States have, within a 
few years, by legislative enactment, outlawed all 
strolling cattle. This is well, and relieves from a 
great nuisance. But in not a few broad-streeted 
towns there has sprung up in consequence, a rank 
growth of weeds, (formerly kept down by grazing 
cows,) which, as it seems no individual’s concern, are 
allowed to ripen their seeds, thus multiplying next 
year’s labor in the fields, besides offering a terribly 
straggling appearance. In fault of such co-operative 
elub as I have hinted. at, (which should order them 
cut at common expense,) every man should see to his

own frontage. If such nursery beds had not been 
tolerated, we should long ago, I think, have scotched 
the Canada thistle, if not that detestable weed, the 
wild carrot. 
At a considerable remove from towns, we fre- 
quently come upon some quiet streak of country road, 
charmingly bordered with a wild sylvan tangle of 
hickories, sumacs, brambles, cedars, and all festooned 
perhaps with the tendrils of the wild grape, or the 
bittersweet. Neither economy or good taste com- 
mand the removal of these, even when bordering cul- 
tivated fields, except (which rarely occurs) they har- 
bor bad weeds to spread within the enclosure. Nay, 
in nine cases in ten they furnish a grateful shelter 
from the winds,—a matter too little appreciated as 
yet, either by fruit growers or grain growers. And 
on the score of taste, no more charming contrast can 
be devised than that of such wild profusion of growth, 
with the neat and orderly array of crops beyond. I 
can recall no more delightful rural scenes in England, 
than certain ones in Devonshire, where, after strolling 
along some admirable bit of Macadam, with high 
hedge-rows on either side, sprinkled with primroses, 
and tasselled with nodding ferns, and wild with tangled 
thickets of bramble, I have, with a leap, broken 
through and seen beyond,—so near the road I could 
have tossed my hat into the field—such trim lines 
   
-P-A-G-E-110
  96 RURAL STUDIES. 
of emerald wheat,—without ever a weed or a crook, 
—as made the heart rejoice. The high hedge-rows 
are indeed now being cut down throughout the best 
cultivated districts, but only for the economy of land, 
the surface occupied being needed. But while we 
have country roads from five to six rods wide, the 
same objection does not obtain with us. Observe 
again, I beg, that I do not counsel the planting of any 
such road-side tangles, or indeed the sparing of them, 
when any better use can be made of the land. I only 
plead for their continued presence in place of a rude 
hurly-burly of stubs and harsh boulders, to which 
condition many farmers reduce them, and call it a 
judicious “ slicking up.” 
I have run widely away from the little homestead 
of my friend Lackland; so widely indeed, that I shall 
not soon encounter him again. Whenever that may 
be, I trust I may hear that his pelargoniums are all 
a-bloom—that: his pig and his cow are thriving—his 
road-side in order,—his Patrick a jewel of a man, and 
that all rural felicities attend him.

Talk about Porches. 
COUNTRY house without a porch is like a 
-\ man without an eyebrow ; it gives expression, 
and gives expression where you most want it. The 
least office of a porch is that of affording protection 
against the rain-beat and the sun-beat. It is an inter- 
preter of character; it humanizes bald walls and 
windows ; it emphasizes architeetural tone ; it gives 
hint of hospitality ; it is a hand stretched out (figura- 
tively and lumberingly, often) from the world within 
to the world without. 
At a church door even, a porch seems to me to be 
a blessed thing, and a most worthy and patent 
demonstration of the overflowing Christian charity, 
and of the wish to give shelter. Of all the images of 
wayside country churches which keep in my mind, 
   
-P-A-G-E-114
  100 RURAL STUDIES. 
those hang most persistently and agreeably, which 
show their jutting, defensive rooflets to keep the 
brunt of the storm from the church-goer while he yet 
fingers at the latch of entrance. 
I doubt if there be not something beguiling in a 
porch over the door of a country shop—something 
that relieves the odium of bargaining, and imbues 
even the small grocer with a flavor of cheap hospitali- 
ties. The verandas (which is but a long translation 
of porch) that stretch along the great river front 
of the Bellevue Hospital, diffuse somehow a gladsome 
cheer over that prodigious caravansery of the sick ; 
and I never see the poor creatures in their bandaged 
heads and their flannel gowns enjoying their conva- 
lescence in the sunshine of those exterior corridors, 
but Ireckon the old corridors for as much as the 
young doctors, in bringing them from convalescence 
into strength, and a new fight with the bedevilments 
of the world. . 
What shall we say, too, of inn porches? Does 
anybody doubt their fitness? Is there any question 
of the fact-—with any person of reasonably imagina- 
tive mood—that Falstaff and Nym and Bardolph, 
and the rest, once lolled upon the benches of the 
porch that overhung the door of the Boar’s Head 
Tavern, Eastcheap? Any question about a porch, 
and a generous one, at the Taberd, Southwark—pre- 
 
-P-A-G-E-115
  WAY-SIDE HINTS. 101 
sided over by that wonderful host who so quickened 
the story-telling humors of the Canterbury pilgrims 
of Master Chaucer ? 
Then again, in our time, if one were to peel away 
the verandas and the exterior corridors from our vast 
watering-place hostelries, what an arid baldness of 
wall and of character would be left! All sentiment, 
all glowing memories, all the music of girlish foot- 
falls, all echoes of laughter and banter and rollicking 
mirth, and tenderly uttered vows would be gone. 
King David, when he gave out to his son Solomon 
the designs for the building of the Temple, included 
among the very first of them (1 Chron. xxviii. 11) 
the “pattern of a porch.” It is not, however, of 
porches of shittim-wood and of gold that I mean to 
talk just now—nor even of those elaborate architec- 
tural features which will belong of necessity to the 
entrance-way of every complete study of a country 
house. I plead only for some little mantling hood 
about every exterior door-way, however humble. 
There are hundreds of naked, vulgar-looking 
dwellings, scattered up and down our country high- 
roads, which only need a little deft and adroit adap- 
tation of the hospitable feature which I have made 
the subject of this paper, to assume an air of modest 
grace, in place of the present indecorous exposure of 
@ wanton. 
 
-P-A-G-E-116
  102 RURAL STUDIES. 
But let no one suppose that porch-building, as 
applied to the homely lines of a staid old house of 
thirty or fifty years since, can be safely given over to 
the judgment of our present ambitious carpenters. 
Ten to one, they will equip a barren simplicity with 
an odious tawdriness. A town-bred girl will slip 
into the millinery bedizenment of the town haber- 
dasher without making show of any odious incon- 
gruity ; but let some buxom, round-cheeked, stout- 
ankled lass of the back country adopt the same, and 
we laugh at the enormity. In the same way, every 
man of a discerning taste must smile derisively at the - 
adornment of an unpretentious farm-house with the 
startling decorative features of the shop joinery of 
the day—the endless scroll-work (done cheaply, by 
new methods of machine sawing)—the portentous 
moulding—the arches, whose outlines are from By- 
zantium or the new Louvre—columns whose propor- 
tions are improved from the Greeks—capitals whose 
fretting sculpture outranks the acanthus. Seriously, 
I think the carpenters, if left to their own efflo- 
rescence, now-a-days, can out-match Demorest or any 
of the wide-hooped milliners. We seem to have 
drifted into an epoch of the largest and crudest flam- 
boyance—in morals, in brokerage, in carpentry, in 
(may I not say ?) congressional eloquence. A sober, 
simple-minded man is worse than lost in the new 
brood of improvers.
-P-A-G-E-117
  WAY-SIDE HINTS. 103 
Notwithstanding all this, I venture to plead for a 
wholesome severity of taste; if simple material is to 
be dealt with, it should be dealt with simply. If we 
have a homely old-style house to modify and render 
attractive, do not let us make its modification a 
mockery by the blazon of Chinese scroll-work. There 
is a way of dealing with what is old, in keeping with 
what is old, and of dealing with what is homely, in 
keeping with what is homely. A sensible middle- 
aged lady of the old school, if she have occasion to 
present herself afresh in society, and assert her pre- 
rogatives once more, will not surely do so by tying 
tow-bags at the back of her head and widening her 
skirts indecorously. But she will bring her old man- 
ner with her, and so equip the old manner by the 
devices of a judicious art that we shall wonder and 
admire in spite of ourselves. 
In illustration of my views about homely porches, 
I venture to give upon the next page a rough drawing 
of one of the plainest conceivable. It is a sort of cross 
between the Dutch stoop and the lumbering roofiet 
which in old times overhung many a doorway of a 
New England farm-house. It offers shelter and rest ; 
it is inno way pretentious ; it declares its character 
at a glance; you cannot laugh at it for any air of 
assumption that it carries; you can find no such 
shapen thing in any of the architectural books. 
 
-P-A-G-E-118
  104 RURAL STUDIES. 
What then? Must it needs be condemned for this 
reason ? 
I do not, indeed, commend it for any beauty, per 
se, but as being an honest, well-intended shelter and 
resting-place, which could be grafted upon many an 
  old-style farm-house, with bare door, and set off its 
barrenness, with quaint, simple lines of hospitality, 
that would add more to the real effect of the home 
than a cumbrous series of joiner’s arches of tenfold its 
cost. In the door itself I have dropped a hint of 
many an ancient door which confronts the high-road 
in a score of New England villages. People do not 
instruct their carpenters to build such doors now; 
yet I can conceive of worse ones, glazed up and
-P-A-G-E-119
  WAY-SIDE HINTS. 105 
down, with blue and yellow and green glass, in most 
irritating conjunction. Ido not know that I would d 
absolutely advise the building of those ancient divided 
doors with their diamond “lights ;” but wherever 
they show their quaint faces, looking out tranquilly 
upon the clash and turmoil of our latter half of the 
century, I would certainly cherish them ; or if I hung a 
porch over them, it would be such a one as should be 
in keeping with their quaintness, and yet offer all 
promise—which a sensible porch should offer—of 
shelter and rest. There is a village I never pass 
through but I ache to clap over one or more of its 
old-time doors (now battling without vestige of roof- 
let, with sun and rain) some such quaint, overhang- 
ing beacon of hospitality as I have pictured; I am 
sure the houses would take on a double homeliness, 
and I should think of all the inmates as growing 
thenceforth, every day, more kindly, and every day 
mellower in their charities. 
I next give a sketch of a little stone porch, which, 
if I do not mistake, is taken from some stone cottage 
in Cumberland County, England. It belongs, certain- 
ly, by its whole air and by its arrangement, to a 
country where stones of good, straight-splitting qual- 
ity (such as gneiss) are plentiful, and are used for 
unpretending cottage architecture. It would seem to 
have pertained to a house of very modest character 
5* 
 
-P-A-G-E-120
  106 RURAL STUDIES. 
and to one whose position and exposure demanded 
special shelter. I think it may offer a hint, at least, 
of the proper use of’ similar material in our country. 
We have not half learned yet all that may be accom- 
plished in domestic architecture, with the wealth of 
stones scattered over our fields. Dear lumber is 
teaching us somewhat; but necessity will presently 
teach us more. The great cost of mason-work is in 
the way of any present large use of stone for building 
purposes, least of all such purpose as a cottage porch. 
But with straight-cleaving stone at hand, such a 
porch as I have drawn could be put together, with 
all its real effect (though not perhaps a great nicety), 
by common wall-layers; and it is for this reason I 
have introduced it, hoping that some intelligent pro- 
  prietor who is in the neighborhood of quarries will 
put his hands to the task of imitation.
-P-A-G-E-121
  WAY-SIDE HINTS. 107 
I give still another design copied rudely from 
an actual porch at Ambleside (Westmoreland) ; it 
was shading the door, some fifteen years since, of 
i i p ' 
  a village curate. There were vines clambering over 
it, which I have omitted, in order to give a full idea 
of the simplicity of its construction. I know it is the 
way of the grand architects to sneer’ at all rustic 
work as child’s play ; but I cannot see the pertinence 
of their sneers; it is quite true that rustic work will 
not last forever—neither will we; house-holders and 
architects, and all the rest of us, have the worms 
gnawing at our vitals, and the bark falling away, and 
 
-P-A-G-E-122
108 RURAL STUDIES, 
the end coming swift. But a good, stanch tree trunk, 
cut in its best season (late autumn), is a very toler- 
able sort of God’s work, and, seems to me, can be put 
to very picturesque uses. I don’t think the curate’s 
porch is a bad one; as a hint for better ones, I think 
it is specially good. 
Upon the question of the use of right material for 
rustic work, there is very much to be said; here, I 
have only space for a suggestion or two. There are 
some trees which hold their bark wonderfully well ; 
of such is the sassafras, which, after its tenth year, 
takes on a picturesque roughness and a rhinoceros- 
like thickness of skin, which admirably fits it for 
rustic use. The white ash, assuming after fifteen 
years a similar thickness of outer covering, holds its 
coat with almost equal tenacity. The ordinary “ pig- 
nut ” hickory holds its bark well; the oak does not; 
neither does the chestnut. The cedar is perhaps most 
commonly employed for rustic decoration; cut in the 
proper season, and due precaution being taken, by 
coating of oil or varnish, against the ravages of the 
grubs (which: have an uncommon appetite for the 
sapwood of cedar), it may hold its shaggy epidermis 
for a long time. I would suggest to those using it 
for architectural purposes a wash of crude petroleum ; 
it is a wash that, so far as I know, is proof against 
the appetite of all insects. Its objectionable odor 
  
-P-A-G-E-123
  WAY-SIDE HINTS. 109 
soon passes away. Very many of the smooth-barked 
trees, such as beech, birch, maple, and sycamore, will 
hold their bark firmly if precautions be taken to 
exclude the air by varnishing the ends and all such cuts 
as have been made by the excision of a limb. Old 
and slow-growing wood will, it must be observed, 
have less shrinkage, and maintain a better bark sur- 
face, than young saplings or trees of rapid growth. 
But, irrespective of all questions of durability, is 
there not something rurally attractive in this unpre- 
tending porch, whose columns have come from the 
forest, and whose overarching arms are the arms that 
overarch God’s temples of the wood? Not lacking, 
surely, some elements of the beautiful in itself; and 
at the door of a village clergyman, with the ivy show- 
ing its glossy leaflets in wealthy labyrinth, and the 
convolvulus twining up at the base upon whatever 
vine-hold may offer, and handing out its purple chali-

God’s simplest graces, answer. 
On Not Doing All at Once. 
HERE are a great many ardently progressive 
people who will be shocked by the caption 
under which I write. The current American theory 
 
-P-A-G-E-124

is, that if a thing needs to be done, it should be done 
at once,—with railroad speed, no matter whether it 
regards politics, morals, religion, or horticulture. And 
I wantonly take the risk of being condemned for an 
arrant conservative, when I express my belief that 
there are a great many good objects in life which 
are accomplished better by gradual progression to- 
ward them than by sudden seizure. I shall not stay_ 
to argue the point with respect to negro suffrage, or 
female suffrage, or a temperance reformation, or the 
Gearing out of Maximilian’s Mexican Imperialism— 
which are a little removed from the horticultural 
arena, where our humbler questions are discussed— 
but I shall urge a graduation and culmination of 
triumphs in what relates to rural life and its charms. 
One meets, from time to time, with a gentleman 
from the city, smitten with a sudden rural fancy, who 
is in eager search for a place “made to his hand,” 
with the walks all laid down, the entrance-ways es- 
tablished, the dwarf trees regularly planted, the con- 
servatory a-steam, and the crocheted turrets fretting 
the sky-line of the suburban villa. But I never heard 
of any such seeker after perfected beauties who was 
an enthusiast in country pursuits, or who did not 
speedily grow weary of his phantasy. He may take 
a pride in his cheap bargain; he may regale himself 
with the fruits and enjoy the vistas of his arbor; but 
 
-P-A-G-E-125
WAY-SIDE HINTS. 111 
he has none of that exquisitely-wrought satisfaction 
which belongs to the man who has planted his own 
trees, who’ has laid down his own walks, and who 
has seen, year after year, successive features of beauty 
in shrub, or flower, or pathway, mature under his 
ministering hand, and lend their attractions to the 
cumulating charms of his home. The man of 
capital, who buys into an established business, 
where the system is perfected, the trade regular 
and constant, the details unvaried, may very pos- 
sibly congratulate himself upon the security of his’ 
gains; but he knows nothing of that ardent and in- 
toxicating enthralment which belongs to one who 
has grown up with the business—suggested its en- 
terprises—shared its anxieties, and by thought, and 
struggle, and adventure, made himself a part of its 
successes. 
A man may enjoy a little complacency in wearing 
the coat of another, (if he gets it cheap,) but there 
can hardly be much pride in it. Therefore, I would 
say to any one who is thoroughly in earnest about 
a country home—make it for yourself. Xenophon, 
who lived in a time when Greeks were Greeks 
advised people in search of a country place to buy 
of a slatternly and careless farmer, since in that 
event they might be sure of seeing the worst, 
and of making their labor and care work the lar- 
 
-P-A-G-E-126
  112 RURAL STUDIES. 
gest results. Cato,* on the other hand, who rep- 
resented a more effeminate and scheming race, 
advised the purchase of a country home from a 
good farmer and judicious house-builder, so that the 
buyer might be sure of nice culture and equipments, 
—possibly at a bargain. It illustrates, I think, rather 
finely, an essential difference between the two races 
and ages :—the Greek, earnest to make his own brain, 
tell, and the Latin, eager to make as much as he could 
out of the brains of other people. 
I must say that I like the Greek view best. I 
never knew of an enthusiast in any pursuit,—whether 
grape-growing, or literature, or ballooning, or poli- 
ties,—who did not find his chiefest pleasure in fore- 
casting successes, not yet made, but only dimly con- 
ceived of, and ardently struggled for. The more 
enthusiasm, the more evidence, I should say, in a 
general way, of incompletion and apparent confusion. 
Show me a cultivator whose vines are well 
trained by plumb and line, whose trees are every one 
planted mathematically in quincunx order, whose 
dwarfs are all clipped and braced after the best pyra- 
midal pattern, and I feel somehow that he is a fash- 
ionist, that he reposes upon certain formulas beyond 
* I shall make no apology for the introduction of these two 
heathen names, since both authors have written capitally well on 
subjects connected with husbandry and rural life.
-P-A-G-E-127
  WAY-SIDE HINTS. 118 
which he does not think it necessary to explore. But 
where I see, with an equal degree of attention, irreg- 
ularity and variety of treatment,—tendrils a-droop 
and fruit-spurs apparently neglected,—I am not un- 
frequently impressed with the belief that the cultiva- 
tor is regardless of old and patent truths, because 
their truth is proven, and because his eye and mind 
are on the strain toward some new development. 
When a good, kind horticultural gentleman takes 
me by the button-hole, and tells me by the hour of 
what length it is necessary to cut the new wood in 
order to insure a good start for the buds at the base, 
and how the sap has a tendency to flow strongest into 
the taller shoots, and other such truisms, which have 
been in the books these ten years, I listen respect- 
fully, but cannot help thinking,—‘ my dear good sir, 
you will never set the river a-fire.” 
Nor indeed do we want the river set on fire; but 
we want progress. And all I have said thus far is 
but preliminary to the truth on which I wish to insist, 
—that a graduated progress is essential to all rational 
enjoyment, whether in things rural, Christian, or com- 
mercial. 
And for this reason I allege that all things which 
are proper to be done about a country house, are not 
to be done at once. Half the charm of life in such a 
home is in every week’s and every season’s succeed-
-P-A-G-E-128
114 RURAL STUDIES. 
ing developments. If, for instance, my friend Lack- 
land, whose place I have described in previous pages, 
had found a landscape gardener capable of inaugurat- 
ing all the changes I have described, and had estab- 
lished his garden, his mall, his shrubberies, and had 
made the cliff in the corner nod with its blooming 
columbines, within a month after occupation, and 
established his dwarf pears in full growth and fruit- 
age, there may have been a glad surprise; but the 
very completeness of the change would have left no 
room for that exhilaration of spirits, with which we 
pursue favorite aims to their attainment. No trout- 
fisher, who is worthy the name, wants his creel 
loaded in the beginning ; he wants the pursuit—the 
alternations of hope and fear; the coy rest of his fly 
upon this pool—the whisk of its brown hackle down 
yonder rapid—its play upon the eddies where possi- 
bly some swift strike may be made—the sway of his 
rod, and the whiz of his reel under the dash of some 
struggling victim. 
It is a mistake, therefore, I think, to aim at the 
completion of a country home in a season, or in two, 
or some half a dozen. Its attractiveness lies, or 
should lie, in its prospective growth of charms. Your 
city home—when once the architect, and plumber, 
and upholsterer have done their work—is in a sense 
complete, and the added charms must lie in the genial
-P-A-G-E-129
  WAY-SIDE HINTS. 115 
socialities and hospitalities with which you can invest 
it; but with a country home, the fields, the flowers, 
the paths, the hundred rural embellishments, may be 
made to develop a constantly recurring succession of 
attractive features. This year, a new thicket of shrub- 
bery, or a new gate-way on some foot-path; next 
year, the investment of some out-lying ledge with 
floral wonders ; the season after may come the estab- 
lishment of a meadow (by judicious drainage) where 
some ugly marsh has offended the eye; and the suc- 
ceeding summer may show the redemption of the 
harsh briary up-land that you have scourged into 
fertility and greenness. This year, a thatched rooflet 
to some out-lying stile; next year, a rustic seat under 
the trees which have begun to offer a tempting shade. 
This year, the curbing of the limbs of some over- 
growing poplar; and next year—if need be—a lop- 
ping away of the tree itself to expose a fresher 
beauty in the shrubbery beneath. 
Most planters about a country home are too much 
afraid of the axe; yet judicious cutting is of as much 
importance as planting; and I have seen charming 
thickets shoot up into raw, lank assemblage of boles 
of trees without grace or comeliness, for lack of cour- 
age to cut trees at the root. For all good effects of 
foliage in landscape gardening—after the fifth year— 
the axe is quite as important an implement as the 
 
-P-A-G-E-130
116 RURAL STUDIES. 
spade. Even young trees of eight or ten years 
growth which stool freely—(such as the soft maple, 
birch, chestnut, and locust,) when planted upon de- 
clivities, may often be cut away entirely, with the 
assurance that the young sprouts, within a season, 
will more than supply their efficiency. Due care, 
however, should be taken that such trees be cut 
either in winter or in early spring, in order to ensure 
free stooling or (as we say) sprouting. The black 
birch, which I have named, and which is a very beau- 
tiful tree—not as yet, I think, fairly appreciated by 
our landscapists—will not stool with vigor, if cut 
after it has attained considerable size; but the sap- 
lings of three or four years, if cut within a foot of 
the ground, will branch off into a rampant growth of 
boughs, whose fine spray, even in the winter, is 
almost equal to its glossy show of summer foliage. 
I do not know if I have made my case clear; but 
what I have wished has been to guard purchasers, 
who are really in earnest, against being disturbed or 
rebuffed by the rough aspect of such country places 
as commend themselves in other respects. The sub- 
jugation of roughness, or rather, the alleviation of it 
by a thousand little daintinesses of treatment, is what 
serves chiefly to keep alive interest in a country 
homestead. 
I must say, for my own part, that I enjoy often
-P-A-G-E-131
  WAY-SIDE HINTS. 117 
for months together some startling defect in my 
grounds—so deep is my assurance, that two days of 
honest labor will remove it all, and startle on-lookers 
by the change. 
But let no rural enthusiast hope to up-root all the 
ill-growth, or to smooth all the roughnesses in a year. 
He would be none the happier if he could. We find 
our highest pleasure in conquest of difficulties. And 
he who has none to conquer, or does not meet them, 
must be either fool or craven. 
Ploughing and Drilled Crops. 
NE of the most striking of those contrasts which 
arrest the attention of an intelligent agricul- 
tural observer, between the tillage of English fields 
and those of New England, as well as of America 
generally, is in the matter of plowing. In England, 
bad plowing is rare; in New England, good plowing 
is even rarer. Something is to be allowed, of course, 
for the irregular and rocky surface of new lands, but 
even upon the best meadow bottoms along our river 
courses, a clean, straight furrow, well turned, so as to 
offer the largest possible amount of friable mould for 
a seed-bed, is a sight so unusual, that in the month of 
spring travel we might count the number on our 
fingers. I go still farther, and say—though doubtless
-P-A-G-E-132
118 RURAL STUDIES. 
offending the patriotic susceptibilities of a great 
many—that not one American farmer in twenty knows 
what really good plowing is. Over and over, the   
wiseacres at the county fairs give their first pre- 
miums to the man who, by a little deft handling of 
the plow, can turn a flat furrow, and who wins his 
honors by his capacity to hide every vestige of the 
stubble, and to leave an utterly level surface. But a 
flat furrow, with ordinary implements, involves a 
broad cut and a consequent diminution of depth. 
The perfection of plowing upon sward-land implies, on 
the contrary, little pyramidal ridgelets of mould, run- 
ning like an arrow’s flight the full length of the field, 
—all which a good cross-harrowing will break down 
into fine and even tilth, like a garden-bed. Yet again 
and again, I have seen such plowing, by Scotch 
adepts, condemned by the county wise men for its 
unevenness. The flat furrow is not, indeed, without 
its uses under certain conditions of the land, and with 
special objects in view—as, for instance, where, by a 
fall plowing, one wishes a partial disintegration of 
the turf, in view of a “turning under” of the whole 
surface upon the succeeding spring for a crop of 
roots, This is practised upon the island of Jersey (so 
famous for its dairy stock) with great success. The 
sod is “skimmed ” (such is their term) in the month 
of November or December, and with the opening of 
 
-P-A-G-E-133
WAY-SIDE HINTS. 119 
spring all is turned under by a plow, which, so far as 
I have observed, is peculiar to that island, and which 
works ten inches in depth, and requires a team of 
four horses for its effective use. 
I must have a word or two to say here m regard 
to American plows, which, from the fact that they 
have received occasional commendatory prizes from 
foreign committees, have been counted by the san- 
guine superior to all other implements of the name, 
and gushing orators have lavished brilliant periods 
upon our superiority to the world in this branch of 
agricultural mechanism. Nothing surely can exceed 
the best American plows in their adaptation to present 
American needs, They are light, compact, strong, 
and in rough lands are by half more manageable than 
the best English implements., But supposing a great 
reach of well-tilled and perfectly cleared field, and 
the improved iron Scotch plow will lay a far more 
true and even furrow with one half the expendi- 
ture of manual force. Under such circumstances, the 
great weight of the Scotch implement, added to its 
carefully adjusted poise, counts in its favor. We shall 
gain nothing by denying this and by exaggerating 
the value of our wooden framework, which has been 
suggested at once by the cheapness of timber material 
and by the exigencies of a rough country. Nor have 
I any manner of doubt that as our culture ripens into 
 
-P-A-G-E-134
  120 RURAL STUDIES. 
seizure of all economic methods, our implement 
makers will adapt themselves to the new demands 
with that shrewdness which has thus far been so 
characteristic of their efforts. 
Again, we have no regularly educated plowmen 
in America. Every man who farms five acres of land 
thinks he can plow—nay, he is in doubt if anybody 
in the world can do it better. But good plowing is 
a thing of education, as much as good preaching, or 
carpentering, or shoemaking, or wiiting. Nothing 
but experience gives the final and effective vis manu- 
tigit. With the wonderful division of labor in all 
old countries, every agricultural laborer has his special 
province and domain of work. And it is quite absurd 
to suppose that a man who plows only a month out of 
the twelve can have anything like that due knowledge 
of the craft, which one acquires by handling the plow- 
stilts every day, for a hundred days in succession. It 
is quite true that under a European sky—whether of 
Belgium, France, or England—tillage can be carried 
on far into the winter, and that, therefore, there is 
more occasion that a man be educated for the special 
office of plowing. But whatever occasion may be, 
the fact remains the same that, while in Belgium and 
in Great Britain there is an annual crop of appren- 
tices to the plow, in America there is none. Every 
man who can use a hoe or a pitch-fork is supposed to
-P-A-G-E-135
  WAY-SIDE HINTS. 121 
be a competent tailsman for the plow. The result is 
—execrably bad work. And I would respectfully 
suggest as a subject to which the newly inaugurated 
Agricultural Colleges may fitly turn a portion of their 
attention, the indoctrination of a certain number of 
ambitious young farmers (every fall time) into the 
merits of good plowing. I have not, indeed, the 
slightest idea that the purveyors of this Congres- 
sional agricultural charity would, in most instances, 
be capable of giving the requisite instruction, but 
they might avail themselves of the offices of here 
and there a Scotch farmer who would be competent 
to fulfil the trust, and there are always young Ameri- 
cans willing to learn, 
Another noticeable feature in European field man- 
agement, which contrasts strongly with much of 
our helter skelter planting, is the almost universal 
adoption of the drill system in the culture of all hoed 
crops, by virtue of which fertilizing material is ap- 
plied directly to the plants, and the same distributed 
—by a transverse plowing the succeeding season—for 
the benefit of the cereal which comes next in rota- 
tion. It may be questionable if our corn crop (maize) 
will not succeed best under so-called “ hill” culture, 
and with a broadcast application of manure, since it 
is a gross and wide feeder, and demands full flow of 
sun and air; but in respect to most other hoed crops 
6 :
-P-A-G-E-136
  122 RURAL STUDIES. 
there can be no doubt of the superior economy, as 
well as the more orderly appearance of the drill 
system. 
Take for instance our ordinary crop of potatoes, 
(and I think the details of its management were never 
before subject of discussion in a similar context ;) four 
out of ten patches of this worthy esculent, are, in 
New England soil, put down in wavy lines of hills— 
irregular in distance, slatternly in culture, and yet 
involving per bushel a far larger expense for tillage 
and harvesting, than if dressed, planted, cleaned, and 
earthed up according to some system which would 
demand trim lines, even distances, and a complete 
shading of the whole ground in the season of their 
most rampant growth. PerhapsI shall not be counted 
too intolerably practical, if I indicate the actual 
method of procedure which has been sometimes fol- 
lowed under my own observation. We will suppose 
that a good surface of sward-land (requiring a lift by 
reason of its weediness) is turned over lightly, (and 
flatly, if you please,) in the month of October. Noth- 
ing offers better pabulum for potatoes, or indeed 
almost any crop, than decaying turf. In April the 
raw surface is levelled with a light Scotch harrow, 
and thereupon all is turned under seven inches by the 
best plow at command with three horses abreast; 
(two will weary of the work.) After this the harrow
-P-A-G-E-137
  WAY-SIDE HINTS. 123 
is put on again, up and down, and across. There is 
no fear of harrowing too much. This being accom- 
plished, and the manure disposed (since March) in 
huge heaps at either end of the field, three deep fur- 
rows are opened at, say, two to three rods apart, by 
a plowman who can drive his furrow across as straight 
as the flight of an arrow. Immediately upon the 
opening of the first, the cart follows, and two men 
strew the open furrow with the halfrotted manure. 
Another hand follows with a sprinkling of guano and 
plaster: and still another follows to drop the seed. 
Upon this the plowman laps a furrow in way of 
cover: two furrows follow as in ordinary plowing, 
and every fourth one is treated as we have described 
with ample dressing and séed. Three series of fur- 
rows being opened at the start, permit the plowman 
to go his rounds without interfering with the plant- 
ing and dressing. When the whole field is gone over 
after this system it has simply the appearance of a 
thoroughly plowed surface. Nothing more is done 
until the young shoots begin to appear; at this time 
the Scotch harrow is put on, and the land completely 
weeded and levelled, little or no harm being done by 
this procedure to the starting crop. The whole field 
has thus the evenness and the cleanness of a garden. 
Three weeks later, especially if the season be favor- 
able to weed growth, it may be necessary to go be- 
 
-P-A-G-E-138

tween the rows—now most distinctly and luxuriantly 
marked with tufts of green—with the cultivator; and 
no future culture is needed until the “ earthing- 
“up” process is accomplished with a double-mould- 
board plow. This done, the crop takes care of itself’ 
until harvesting time ; no hand hoe, or further culture 
being essential. I venture to say that the cost per 
bushel is twenty per cent. less than that by the ordi- 
nary, hap-hazard hand tillage. In addition to this 
there is the delight to the eye of trim rows of luxu- 
riant foliage, interlacing by degrees, and covering the 
whole surface with a rich mat of green. If the 
experts in the growth of this old esculent—whether 
in Maine or on the Bergen flats—have any fault to 
find with the method, I will be a patient listener. 
Roads and Shade. 
LEAVE potatoes and their culture for a further 
consideration of the more striking contrasts be- 
tween European and American landscape. Not the 
least noticeable of these contrasts springs from the 
vast difference in the outlay and treatment of the 
public roads. A neat and well-ordered public road 
in any of the rural districts of America is altogether 
exceptional. Throughout Great Britain a slatternly 
and ill-kept one is most rare. There is no particular
-P-A-G-E-139
WAY-SIDE HINTS. 125 
reason why a cross-country road for farm traffic only 
should have the width of a village street; yet one 
uniform turnpike rule of breadth seems to have pre- 
vailed in the laying down of all country thorough- 
fares in America: of course, did the disposition exist, 
it would by no means be so easy a matter to keep a 
rambling highway of forty or fifty feet in width, in 
such orderly condition as a narrower one which would 
amply suffice for the traffic. Neither towns nor tarn- 
pike companies, who mostly have American roads in 
charge, have any system in their management or any 
regard for appearances. Exception is to be made in 
favor of a few public-spirited townships (in Massa- 
chusetts mostly) which have taken this matter boldly 
in hand and encouraged order and thrift by whole- 
some regulations in regard to encroachments upon 
the highway, and the judicious planting of trees. 
For the most part, however, American highroads, 
throughout the rural districts, offer to the eye two 
great slovenly stretches of land, cumbered with stones, 
offal, wood-yards, and gaping with yellow chasms of 
earth, from which, every spring-time and autumn, a 
few shovelfuls of clay are withdrawn to patch the 
road-bed which lies between. Under such conditions 
the utmost neatness and regularity which the farmer 
may bestow upon his fields and crops lose half their 
effect, and the landscape lacks that completed charm 
 
-P-A-G-E-140
  126 RURAL STUDIES. 
which regales the eye along the rural by-roads of 
England. 
While town authorities continue to be appointed 
for their political aptitude, it is useless to hope for 
any mending of such defects, or for any deliberate 
scheme of improvement. The most that can be done 
is by the combination of adjoining proprietors, in 
which they will have little to hope from the codpera- 
tion of any town board of advisers. ‘As an instance 
in point—I have repeatedly offered to undertake full 
charge of the half-mile of highroad leading through 
farm lands of my own, guaranteeing a more serviceable 
condition than the road has yet known, and a dimi- 
nution of cost to the town of at least twenty per 
cent., yet the proposition is ignored. The selectmen 
would lose their little private jobbing in way of 
repairs, and some future board might annul any such 
disorderly and unheard of contract. 
I have alluded to the planting of trees along high- 
ways—a practice which many towns have favored by 
public action, and one contributing largely to the 
enjoyment of ‘a summer’s drive, as well as adding to 
the inviting aspect of our country villages. The same 
practice obtains along the great public highways of 
France, but not so generally in England where the 
sunshine is not so common or so fierce. as to call for 
special protection. Even the country houses of Great

Britain are by no means so shaded as our own; and 
the most considerable piles of buildings, such as Eaton 
Hall, Blenheim, Dalkeith, and Burghley House, have 
hardly a noticeable tree within stone’s throw of their 
walls. The flower patches, and coppices of shrubbery 
approach more nearly, and to the garden fronts of 
those magnificent homes you walk through walls of 
blooming shrubs. But the full flow of the sunshine 
upon the window is a thing courted. Allowing for 
all difterence in climate, I think there may be a ques- 
tion if we do not errin this country by over-much 
shading. A cottage in a wood is a pretty subject for 
poetry, but it is apt to be uncomfortably damp. And 
there are village streets with us so embowered that 
scarce a ray of sunshine can play fairly upon the roofs 
or fronts of the village houses, from June to October. 
A summer’s life under such screen cannot contribute 
to the growth of roses in the cheeks any more than 
to the growth of roses at the door. There is no pro- 
vision against agues—whether moral or physical— 
like a good flow of sunshine. 
In the establishment of new country houses with 
us I often observe infinite pains bestowed upon the 
elaboration of flower-patches, and banks of shrubbery 
within enjoyable distance of the door, while in the 
midst of them, or at such little remove as works the 
same result, a great array of shade trees is planted.
-P-A-G-E-142

After only a few years, these gross feeders have seized 
upon all the available plant-food within reach, and 
with the great lusty boughs of the maples waving 
over his cherished parterres, the proprietor is amazed 
at the shrinkage of his flower-growth. It should be 
fairly understood that about a densely shaded door- 
step, the conditions of vigorous and healthful flower- 
growth can never be maintained. 
But far worse, and more to be deprecated than a 
starvation of the flowers in the immediate neighbor- 
hood of a country house, is the starvation of the turf; 
yet in many of the old established village yards, and 
about many suburban homes where the fancy for 
dense overhanging shade has had full sway, even the 
grasses maintain a doubtful livelihood, and their place 
is taken by the wild mosses. It may be laid down, I 
think, as a safe rule, and of universal application in 
our Northern latitudes, that wherever shade immedi- 
ately contiguous to the house is too dense for the vig- 
orous growth of the ordinary lawn grasses, it is too 
dense for proper conditions of health; and I would 
recommend to the invalid tenants of such a house—in 
place of nostrums—the axe. 
Of course, we can hardly venture to expose our 
whole frontage to the sun, in the generous way in 
which the British country liver is wont to do; but 
sunshine on the roof should, I think, be religiously

WAY-SIDE HINTS. 129 
guarded, whatever may become of our old favorites, 
the trees. 
There is another condition of English country 
life—aside from the climate—which admits of a freer 
play of sunshine than we may be disposed to admit : 
it lies in the fact that British houses, whether of 
brick or stone, are thick-walled (covered, many times, 
with lichens, if not ivy), and so ward off very effect- 
ually the fiercest blasts of July. The thatched roofs 
of Devon and of Somerset are an even greater pro- 
tection from the sun. 
English and American Hedging. 
NOTHER striking subject of contrast between 
British and American country road-side, is 
offered by the numberless array of live hedges which 
belong to the former, and which probably for genera- 
tions to come will be wanting in America. In the 
best-cultivated districts of England, however, hedges 
are rapidly losing favor for the partition of arable 
lands, as engrossing too much space, stealing some- 
what from the productive capacity of the soil, and 
offering shelter for noxious weeds. The system of 
soiling is moreover doing away with the necessity for 
them, and such ground-feeding as is permitted, is 
more closely and economically controlled by the

adoption of movable hurdles. The clearing up of 
those old lines of hawthorn may give delight to the 
agricultural eye, but the lover of the picturesque will 
lament their destruction. The cumbrous hedge-rows, 
too, of Devon and of the Channel Isles (huge dykes 
of earth with hedge and trees springing from their 
top) are yielding to the demands of new and progres- 
sive culture. I recall many a loitering of a summer’s 
day between these huge banks of green, within sound 
of the Dart, or of the Exe, or of the beat of the 
water in Za Fret—the primroses dotting the close 
sward, the hedges shutting out the light, the scattered 
boles wound round with cloaks of ivy, the scant, 
scraggy limbs interlacing above, and a constant mois- 
ture upon the macadamized way, giving life to little 
truant mats of mosses. But near to the centres of 
travel and improvement, all these delightful old ridgy 
banks of moss, and earth, and hedges, and trees, 
have disappeared. The keen tenants, with the per- 
mission of the landlords, are hunting them down in 
the retired districts. And no wonder; they occupied 
full twenty feet in width; every rod of them shaded 
a good perch of grain land; they offered capital 
breeding places for scores of rabbits. But though a 
great change is going on in this respect, as well as in 
the removal of many of the hedges which mark the 
interior divisions of the farms, the border lines, and
-P-A-G-E-145

the way-side still show, throughout the month of 
April, that wondrous wealth of white hawthorn bloom 
which is so associated in the thoughts of all with 
English rural landscape. Not always trim, it is true, 
are the hawthorn hedges ; not without an occasional 
interlacing of rampant brambles }, not without some 
stray sapling of other growth cropping out, and — 
lording it. over the line of hedge; but gnarled, stiff, 
strong, waving with the undulations of the hills, 
twining with the curves of the road-way—unbroken, 
save by here and there a stile or a cumbrous farm- 
gate—with a fine spray of interlacing branchlets from 
ground to top—white, and noisy with bees in all the 
season of bloom—green, and wavy, and flowing in 
the flush of the summer’s growth—carrying their red 
haws through all the early winter, and when the light 
snows (as they do, rare times) veil the ground, show- 
ing their creeping lines of brown up the hills, and 
athwart the hills, and in soldierly array flanking every 
country by-road. 
When I think of those long billows of green skirt- 
ing the paths, and look upon my prosaic posts and 
rails, it seems to me plain enough that a great bit of 
the warp upon which have been woven so many of 
the charming rural pictures in British art and song, 
is forever wanting to us here. Fancy a trim line of 
posts running across the clayey ground of one of
-P-A-G-E-146

Gainsborough’s landscapes! Fancy old Walton sit- 
ting under the “rails” for a little chit-chat. with his 
blooming milk-maid! Fancy Milton planting his 
Russet lawns and fallows gray, 
Where the nibbling flocks do stray, 
under the lee of a well-morticed rail-fence ! 
Yet, poetry apart, we shall probably keep by our 
timber fences for many generations to come in Ameri- 
ca} first, because, in most parts of the country, it is 
good economy to do so; and next, because we have 
as yet no hedge-plant which can thoroughly make 
good the place of the hawthorn in England. 
We are able to grow the hawthorn indeed ; but 
it must be done daintily. It will never bear. the 
rough usage which its ordinary use as a hedge-plant 
for farm purposes involves. The same is true to an 
equal extent of the buckthorn, which, in addition, has 
the bad habit of dying in many of our hard winters ; 
and both these thorns are liable to the attacks of 
insects (far more pestiferous with us, it would seem, 
than in Europe), which seriously abridge their use. 
The white-willow, so trumpeted by bagmen through- 
out the country is thoroughly a humbug. It is indeed 
sadly derogatory to the good sense of our rural popu- 
lation that pretenders could ever foist a claim in 
favor of a willow, of any known habit of growth, 
 
-P-A-G-E-147
WAY-SIDE HINTS. 133 
upon their acceptance. The osage orange in certain 
portions of the West, and of the Southwest, promises 
to be very effective. It starts late in the spring, but 
holds its foliage until the frost withers it. In the 
extreme North, and in the Northeast, its shoots are 
liable to be winter-killed, and its own rampant growth 
is also against it, as an economic plant for hedging. 
For effective treatment it requires two or three clip- 
pings in the year. This is more, we fancy, than the 
holders of Western prairie farms will be willing to 
bestow. After mature years it may possibly show a 
more tractable disposition in this respect. The honey- 
locust has been adopted in many quarters, and has its 
sturdy advocates. But it is open to the same objec- 
tion of a too luxuriant growth on congenial soils, and 
of the still more odious objection of a disposition to 
“sucker,” or send up shoots from the roots at a long 
remove from the parent stem. 
The barberry (Berberis vulgaris) is strongly com- 
mended by many, but it has never yet had, so far as 
I am aware, fair field trial. A strong objection to it 
appears to me to lie in the fact that, like the willow, 
it never inclines to branch from near the root. It 
sends up indeed a great number of shoots; but shoots 
of this kind, growing parallel, and showing few leaf: 
lets, or little side-spray, can never make a compact, 
or even a graceful hedge. The old-fashioned farmers
-P-A-G-E-148
134 RURAL STUDIES. 
of the East have still another objection, as firmly 
cherished as any dogma they listen to on Sunday, to 
wit,—the barberry “blasts the rye.” This faith is 
indeed so firmly and persistently cherished that I have 
been disposed to look for the source of it in some 
tribe of aphides peculiar to the barberry, which by 
juxtaposition may transfer its labors to the cereal. 
The native white-thorn remains—and it has always 
seemed to me that with proper nursing, education, 
and development, much might be made of this as a 
hedge-plant. The hornbeam, also, of our forests, is a 
small tree, of profuse spray, bearing the shears ad- 
mirably ; but, so far as I know, never as yet adopted 
on a large scale for hedges. The green walks of the 
gardens of Versailles demonstrate amply what its 
European congener will suffer in way of clipping. 
In the way of evergreen hedge-plants we have 
nothing to ask for from the nurserymen of Great 
Britain. Both the arbor-vite and the hemlock spruce 
are admirably adapted to the purpose. The beauty 
of this latter nothing can exceed, particularly in the 
season of its first growth (early June), when its flossy 
light green tufts hang over it like a great shower of 
golden bloom. The arbor-vite is perhaps more man- 
ageable, and certainly less impatient of removal; but 
it can never become so effective. The Norway spruce 
is also admirably adapted to hedge uses, and will
-P-A-G-E-149
  WAY-SIDE HINTS. 135 
bear (if treated early) the closest clipping of the 
shears. The grand error ia its employment hitherto 
has been in allowing it to gain some three or four 
feet in height before resorting to the clipping pro- 
cess. 
In fact, the general failure of our hedge experi- 
ments throughout the country—whether for service 
or ornamentation—may be summed up in one word, 
a lack of care. Farmers have bought hedge-plants 
by the thousand, and plowing a single furrow or two 
along the lines of their fields, have set them down 
under the absurdly ill-founded opinion, that thence- 
forward they would take care of themselves. But 
the young and tender hedge-plant, like the young 
growth of corn, needs culture. And the man who is 
too indolent or too short-sighted to bestow it, will 
surely never reap any considerable reward. It is 
amazing—the short-sightedness which prevails in this 
regard, not only with respect to hedging, but or- 
charding, and tree-planting of all kinds. I count it 
as necessary to the vigorous establishment of a newly- 
set tree or shrub, that all foreign growth should be 
kept away from an inclosing circle of from two to 
four feet radius, as to bestow the like attention upon 
a hill of corn or of melons. The little fibrous root- 
lets, such as give nursing to the transplanted stock, 
are as impatient of any robbery of those sources of
-P-A-G-E-150
136 RURAL STUDIES, 
sustenance, which find their way through the ground, 
as the annual plants. We should have heard far less 
lament in this country over the failure of hedges if 
there had been more considerate treatment of them 
during the early years of their establishment. 
If this careful nurture be requisite in respect to 
stock from the nurseries, it is ten-fold more important 
with respect to young plants transferred directly from 
the forest. Scores of failures I have known on the 
part of those, who—being delighted with the appear- 
ance of some lusty screen of hemlocks—have under- 
taken to rival it by direct transfer of the wild growth 
to some lean streak of plowed land, and have there- 
after left the shivering field-pensioners to struggle for 
themselves. The half would very likely or very prop- 
erly die; the rest maintain only a meagre semblance 
of life, and show none of that rampant vigor which is 
essential to the beauty of a hedge. Indeed, except in 
fully kept garden-ground, I would advise no one to 
make this direct transfer. A season or two in the 
nursery rows develops an enormous stock of rootlets, 
and thereafter, with ordinary care, every plant may 
be counted on. 
I doubt very greatly the serviceableness of any of 
the evergreen hedges for farm purposes; both the 
hemlock and Norway spruce, for full development, 
demand considerable width, more than would be con-
-P-A-G-E-151
  WAY-SIDE HINTS. 137 
sistent with farm-economy, and much greater than 
would be ordinarily accorded to the hawthorn ; be- 
sides which, they are by no means proof against the 
mischievous forays of cattle, who love nothing better 
than to tangle their horns in a wall of soft green and 
twist away the branchlets. The thorn-bearing shrubs 
are by no means so inviting to their ventures of this 
sort. 
I have not spoken of the holly—of which many 
charming hedges are to be found on English estates 
—because the British plant has not proved itself 
wholly equal to our climate, and the American holly 
(besides being somewhat inferior in glossiness and 
density of foliage) has not yet been commonly intro- 
duced even among nurserymen. In the way, how- 
ever, of leafy screens for garden parterres and ter- 
races, I have great hopes of what may yet be accom- 
plished with our Rhododendron and Kalmia latifolia. 
The lank, lean habit of this latter under its ordinary 
transplanting is no measure of its capacity for making 
a full, rounded, dense wall of green. Whoever has 
wandered over high-lying pasturelands of New 
England which have recently been cleared of their 
forest growth, and has seen the wanton, luxuriant, 
crowded tufts of Kalmia shooting from the old roots, 
can form some measure of the capacity of the shrub 
for good screen effects. The lank growth, too, of the
-P-A-G-E-152
  138 RURAL STUDIES. 
Rhododendron in a few shaded swamp-lands where it 
finds its habitat in New England, is no indication of 
what may be done with it under fairer conditions of 
growth. 
And this mention of the laurel family (I like that 
old popular naming of these shrubs) reminds me of 
the screens and coppices which greet the eye so often 
in English gardens and in English landscape. It is 
quite possible that with our climate, we can never 
equal their variety. The Bay, the Spanish laurel, the 
Laurestina, will very likely be fastidious in adjusting 
themselves to our winters. But with our narrow- 
leaved laurel, our Latifolia, our Rhododendrons, we 
can pile up a wealth of glossy green against the 
northern sides of our gardens, which even the best 
British farmers might envy. Add to these our 
spruces (hemlock and others), our white pine (Stro- 
bus), for background, and we have nothing to covet. 
But if we have nothing to covet, we have very 
much to learn in the adjustment of our leafy screens. 
Over and over I observe some ambitious gentleman 
(at the hands of his gardener) attempting to establish 
a protective coppice, and after careful and expensive 
preparation of the ground (there is nothing lacking 
on that score), placing his rare evergreens where they 
will be presently overgrown and lost, or putting out 
his Rhododendrons where they will have no room for
-P-A-G-E-153
  WAY-SIDE HINTS. 189 
full and rounded development, or crowding his 
spruces, and his Deodars, and Scotch pines, so that in 
a few years there is but a thicket of close-growing 
boles—offering no shelter from the wind, and graded 
by no forecast of the relative measure of growth. 
Or if, by accident, the planting be judicious, there 
follows none of that resolute trimming and bold use 
of the axe, under which only a protective group of 
trees can be made to maintain its rounded symmetry 
and its artistic agreement with the landscape. 
Indeed, we are as yet only beginning to learn 
what the real worth of screening banks of foliage are 
to fruit, to gardens, and even to grain-fields. It is 
doubtful if it be not the last-lesson—but certainly not 
the least important—which is learned in ornamental 
or economic arboriculture. 
Village Greens, 
FI enter a little quiet plea for the old-fashioned 
Village Greens, I hope I shall not be decried by 
the reformers. Village Greens are not quotable at 
the “ Board.” Our friend of the Avenue cannot dash 
through them with his equipage. There are no 
patches of choice exotics upon the village green— 
possibly not even a serpentine path; no fountain, I 
am sure, that shows the spasmodic gush of the city 
 
-P-A-G-E-154
  140 RURAL STUDIES. 
fountains. And yet the name—Village Green, is, 
somehow, tenderly cherished ; it rallies to my thought 
a great cycle of rural memories belonging to song, to 
childhood, to story and to travyel—wherein I see, in 
bountiful procession, broad-armed elms, dancing peas- 
ants, flocks of snowy geese, shadows of church 
spires, boys with satchels, bonfires of fallen leaves, 
militia “trainings,” and some irate Betsey Trotwood, 
making a soldierly dash at intruding donkeys. It is 
quite possible that these ill-assorted memories may 
confound public and private Greens, as well as Eng- 
lish and American, but all have their spring in that 
good old name of the Village Green. I hope that it 
is not a strange name, and that it will never grow 
strange while grass is green, and villages are founded. 
In old days of stage-coach travel, one came, after 
a tedious, lumbering drag over hills, and through 
swampy flats, (where, if season favored, wild grape- 
vines, or white azalias, tossed their rich fragrance into 
coach windows,) upon some lifted plateau of land, 
where the white houses shone among trees, flanking a 
level bit of greensward, and geese grazed the com- 
mon; and where was a whipping-post, may be—pos- 
sibly a decaying pair of oaken stocks, and a court- 
house with its belfry. I do not think such old village 
commons of New England, (and I suspect they were 
rarely to be seen in other parts of the country,) were
-P-A-G-E-155
  WAY-SIDE HINTS. 141 
ever very nicely kept. The geese cropped the grass 
short, to be sure; but geese are not a tidy animal ; 
the pool, too—if any pondlet of water broke the 
surface of the level—was apt to show the stamp of 
adventurous hoofs and a muddy margin ; for all this, 
however, such eyelets of green space in the centre of 
country towns, around which and upon which all the 
gayety and cheer of the settlement might disport 
itself, were very charming. I do not know but I 
would rejoice to see the village stocks brought into 
use again, for the sake of the broad common where 
they stood: certain it is, that if they were ever ser- 
viceable (I speak of the stocks), they would be ser- 
viceable now. I think I could mention a fat grocer 
or two, and two or three editors, or more, who 
would look well—sitting in the stocks. And as for 
the whipping-posts, who would not rejoice to see 
their revival, provided only he could name the incum- 
bents of the post-office ? 
But I have no right to speak of the Village Green 
as wholly a thing of the past, although such symbols 
of order and discipline as the stocks and the whip- 
ping-post have gone by. 
Travellers rarely meet with them, it is true; but 
we do not travel by stage-coach nowadays. We do 
not face the old orderly frontage of quiet, outlying 
towns, as we did when we clattered down the main
-P-A-G-E-156
  142 RURAL STUDIES. 
street to the common and the tayern and the pump. 
If we travel thitherward, we are thrust into the back- 
sides of towns upon some raw cut of a railway, amid 
all manner of debris and noisome smells. Now I 
suppose that old-time villagers took a pride in their 
common, with its stately trees—in their court-house, 
their breadth and neatness of high-road, as being the 
objects which must of necessity fasten the regard of 
those from the outside world who paid their town a 
visit. The two deacons who lived opposite, would 
never coquette in their door-yards, or fences, for the 
entertainment of each other, but rather for the ad- 
miration of the public, which must needs pass their 
doors. But yet—and it is a curious fact in the his- 
tory of public taste—in these times, when old villages 
are disembowelled by the railway, and all their showi- 
ness turned inside out, there seems very little regard 
paid to the observation of that larger public which is 
hurtling by every day in the cars. 
The former traveller along the high-road, was cau- 
tiously placated with orderly palings, neat door-yards, 
an array of grass and flowering shrubs, with a church 
in imposing position ; but the larger public that now 
visits the locality is greeted with a terrific array of 
backsides, of lumbering styes, disorderly fences, and 
no token that the village world is cognizant of their 
presence, or careful of their judgment. Of course, the
-P-A-G-E-157
  WAY-SIDE HINTS. 143 
habit of a village life cannot be changed so quickly 
as a railway cutting is made—the new world of pro- 
gress may be upon them before they are aware; but 
when actually present, why not meet it with some- 
thing of the old tidiness and pride ? 
Can any rural philosopher explain us this matter ? 
Does the whirl of the world into sudden sight of all 
our disorderly domesticity, break up self-respect, and 
weaken faith in appearances ? 
Here, and there indeed, I observe one who newly 
paints his rear door, and trims his hedges, and plants 
his arbors, and gravels his walks, so as to impress 
favorably the new passers-by of the rail; but for one 
who shows this solicitude respecting the new public, 
a dozen keep to a stolid indifference, and living with 
their faces the other way, leave the pigs and a mangy 
dog to squeal and bark a reception to the world of 
the railway. : 
I cannot quite explain this. Most of us love to 
carry a name for respectability and good order and 
decency, and do not like to be discovered kicking the 
cat ortindulging in any similar personal gratifications 
or wants, It is true we do not know one in a thou- 
sand of the ten thousand who hurtle past our home- 
stead; but how many of those who make up the 
body of that public opinion, in the eye of which we 
wish to live with decency and: order, do we know ? 
 
-P-A-G-E-158
  144 RURAL STUDIES. 
What all this may have to do with the topic of 
Village Greens, may be not quite clear to the reader ; 
but I will try and develop its bearings, All the lesser 
towns through which or near to which a railway 
passes, have virtually changed face; they confront 
the outside world no longer upon their embowered 
street or quiet common, but at the “station.” There 
lies the point of contact, and there it must remain 
until the mechanicians shall have devised some airy 
carriage which shall drop visitants from the clouds 
upon the threshold of the cosy old hostelrie. There 
being thus, as it were, a new focal point of the town 
life, it wants its special illustration and adornment. 
The village cannot ignore the railway: it is the com- 
mon carrier; it is the bond of the town with civiliza- 
tion; it lays its iron fingers upon the lap of a hundred 
quiet valleys, and steals away their tranquillity like a 
ravisher. 
What then? Every village station wants its little 
outlying Green to give character and dignity to the 
new approach. Is there any good reason against 
this? Nay, are there not a thousand reasonssin its 
favor? In nine out of ten wayside towns, such space 
could be easily secured, easily held in reserve, easily 
made attractive; and if there were no room for a 
broad expanse of sward, at least there might be 
planted some attractive copse of evergreens or shrub-
-P-A-G-E-159
  WAY-SIDE HINTS. 145 
bery, to declare by graceful type the rural pride of 
the place. He would be counted a sorry curmudgeon 
who should allow all visitors to make their way to 
his entrance-hall, through wastes of dust and piles of 
offal; cannot the corporate authorities of a town be 
taught some measure of self-respect, and welcome the 
outside world with indications of orderly thrift, bloom- 
ing and carrying greeting to the very threshold of 
the place ? 
First impressions count for a great deal—whether 
in our meeting with a woman, or with a village. Slip- 
shoddiness is bad economy in towns, as is people. 
Every season there is a whirl of citizens, tired of city 
heats and costs, traversing the country in half hope 
of being wooed to some summer home, where the 
trees and the order invite tranquillity and promise 
enjoyment. A captivating air about a village station 
will count for very much in the decision. There will 
be growth, to be sure, in favored localities, in spite 
of disorder. I could name a score of little towns 
along the line of the New Jersey and Erie and Hud- 
son Railways, with their charming suburban retreats 
near by, to which the occupant must wade his way 
through all manner of filthiness and disorderly debris, 
making his landing, as it were, in the very dung-heap 
of the place, and smacking with a relish, it would 
seem, these prefatory incidents of his country home, 
7 
 
-P-A-G-E-160
  146 RURAL STUDIES. 
Is there no mending this? Are selectmef all 
swine or swineherds? Do city residents count for 
nothing or care for nothing in the health or air of 
the railway centre of the towns of their adoption ? 
Dram-shops, and. oyster-shops, and as dirty land-of- 
fices, will, doubtless, in the present civilization, have 
position somewhere ; but must they needs be foisted 
upon the area about the village station? Is no re- 
demption possible? Must we always confront the 
town with its worst side foremost? Suppose for a 
moment that the old Village Green were translated to 
the neighborhood of the station, or a companion spot 
of rural attractiveness established there, around 
which the waiting equipages might circle in attend- 
ance—suppose a pleasant shade of elms spreading 
itself upon that now dusty area—suppose the corpo- 
rate authorities keenly alive to the aspect which their 
town and its approaches may wear in the eye of the 
world which looks on, and forms its judgment every 
day by thousands—suppose an inviting inn, duly li- 
censed, swings its sign under some near bower of 
trees, will all this count nothing toward the growth, 
the reputation, the dignity of a country locality? I 
know I am writing in advance of the current practice 
in these respects; but I am equally sure that Iam 
not writing in advance of the current practice fifty 
years hence, if only the schools are kept open. The
-P-A-G-E-161
  WAY-SIDE HINTS. 147 
reputation of a town for order, for neatness, for liber- 
ality, or taste, is even now worth something, and it 
is coming to be worth more, year by year. 
Railway Gardening. 
HAVE alluded to the railway station and its 
surroundings, because it seems to me that—in 
the lessons of public taste which are being read from 
time to time by those competent to teach on such 
topics—this new junction of the world with country 
localities is being sadly overlooked. Where indeed 
can there be a hopeful opening for any esthetic teach- 
ing, if this inoculation and grafting-point of the busi- 
ness world with the world ruminant and rural, is al- 
lowed to fix, with all its ugly swell of swathing band- 
ages and pitch and mud, uncared for ? 
The question of proprietorship might give some 
difficulty, but it is one whose difficulties would vanish, 
if only the corporate authorities of town and road 
could be brought to act in harmony. Nor is there 
any reason in the economies of the matter why they 
should not. The road secures a limited area for the 
establishment of its station, and some outlying 
grounds, in most cases, to guard against future con- 
tingencies—which grounds usually rest in a most 
.
-P-A-G-E-162
  1438 RURAL STUDIES, 
forlorn condition, giving refuge, may be, to con- 
demned sleepers or wreck of wheels—possibly ten- 
anted by some burly night porter, who thrusts his 
stove-pipe through the roof of a dismantled car— 
showing just that disarray, in short, which declares 
no pride or proof of ownership. If there chance to 
be any half-filled pits upon the premises, enterprising 
Celtic citizens of the neighborhood count them good 
spots into which to shoot their garbarge. All this 
the town authorities regard as a matter which con- 
cerns only the distinguished corporation of the road. 
Thus, between them, the most unkempt and noisome 
wilderness about the half of such of our country 
towns as are pierced by railways is apt to lie in the 
purlicus of the station. Yet railway directors are, 
some of them, professing Christians, and so are town 
authorities—at times. What now if these good peo- 
ple (hee verbi magnificentia !) would lay their heads 
together to compass what might prove a gain to the 
town thrift, and so indirectly to the road, without 
positive loss to either? What if the town were to 
extend the area of the corporation lands at its own 
cost, so far as to establish a little bowling green, that 
should give piquant welcome to every stranger, and 
grow to be an object of town pride? What if care 
of all grounds adjoining the station should be subject 
to some custodian, bound to control them after some

  WAY-SIDE HINTS. 149 
simple prescribed rules of order, whose fulfilment 
would work an economy to the company, and add a 
grace to that portion of the village ? 
I cannot help recalling to mind here some of 
those charming wayside stations upon the Continent 
--in France, Germany, and Switzerland—where the 
station-master is also manager of a blooming garden 
(the property of the company), which he manages 
with such tender care that the blush of the roses and 
the muffled scent of the heliotropes come to me again   
as I read the name of the station upon the Guide 
Book, And yet those French, those German, those 
Swiss corporators, who encourage their station-mas- 
ters to such handicraft, are shrewd money men. 
They find their account in all this; they like to make 
their roads attractive ; the way-side villagers encour- 
age them in it to the full bent of their capacity. 
In one quarter (among those stations of which I 
speak, but I cannot now just say where) I was pro- 
voked into special inquiries: “This nice treatment 
involved a great bill of expense doubtless ? ” 
“Very great care—grand labor!” 
“Jt must make a heavy bill for the company to 
foot?” 
«& Pardon, monsieur, the work is mine and the 
gain is mine.” 
“ Not very much, it is to be feared.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-164
  150 RURAL STUDIES. 
“ Pardon” again; the station-master (it was only 
an out of the way country station) has sold enough 
of bouquets to passing travellers to establish his boy 
at a pension: he hopes everything for his boy. The 
story gave anew fragrance to the roses, and to the 
marguerites which he handed me. 
Now, I am afraid our station-masters, whether in 
Massachusetts or along the Hudson, will not be ca- 
pable of making themselves good florists at a bound; 
but yet the hint has its value. What objection can 
there possibly be to the careful culture of such strips 
of land as come within the jurisdiction of every stay 
tion-master upon our iron roads? In not infrequent 
instances he has the lea of some deep cutting for 
shelter ; he has the eyes of an observing crowd (who 
are debarred from pilfering) for an incentive ; he may 
have his thousand customers for floral offerings every 
summer’s day. Could not the townsfolk aid, with 
prudent foresight, in any such diversion of the waste 
strips of railway lands? The area in gross is not 
small; miles upon miles of bank cutting, of marsh 
land, of embankment, of green level, each one of 
which will grow its own crop after methods which a 
wealthy and intelligent railway corporation might _ 
surely direct. Osiers upon the low lands, shrubs 
upon the raw cuttings (binding them against wash), 
grasses upon the verdant lands, a flame of flowers

around every station. Does anybody doubt that this 
thing is to be in the years to come? Does anybody 
doubt (who believes in progress) that some day the 
directors, now so stolid and indifferent, will make a 
merit of it, and take a pride in pointing out their 
horticultural successes upon their league-long strips 
of garden ? 
One very great advantage in that nice culture 
which is to be observed about many of the British 
and Continental railway stations lies in the fact, that 
the culture and its success are submitted every day to 
thousands of eyes. What you or I may do very suc- 
cessfully, and in obedience to the best laws of taste 
and vegetable physiology on some back country prop- 
erty, may really benefit the public very little, for the 
reason that the public will never put eye upon it; 
but what our horticultural friend at a railway station 
may do (if done well) is of vastly more profit. It is 
in the way of being seen; it is in the way of being 
seen of those who are not immediately engrossed 
with other care than the easy care of travel; it gives 
suggestions to them in their most accessible moods. 
To this day I think I have fixed in my mind many a 
little gracefully arranged parterre of bloom, only 
petunias and pansies and four o’clocks, may be, which 
I saw only a few moments on some day, now far 
gone, in other latitudes, and of which the scant

memorial is but some jotting down upon a foreign 
note-book, followed by a scant pencilling of the actual 
adjustment, so far.as the brief stay allowed of tran- 
script. 
The chemists tell us that the air of cities and their 
neighborhood is richer in available nitrogen (in shape 
of ammonia or nitric acid) than the air of the country, 
by reason of the outpourings from so many chininey- 
tops, and the attendant processes of combustion. May 
not the cinders and the fine ash and the gases 
evolved from a great highway of engines always 
puffing and smoking in the lower strata of the atmo- 
sphere contribute somewhat, and that not inconsider- 
ably, to the plants found along the lines of such high- 
way? Iam not aware that experiment has as yet 
determined anything on this score; and whatever 
such determination might be, it is certain that abund- 
ant sources of fertilization might be secured at every 
country station, sufficient amply to equip an invest- 
ing garden. Upon the oldest roads very much could 
be done still in way of this charming investiture, and 
in way of the adjoining bowling-green, under encour- 
agement of the town, or of neighboring property- 
holders ; and upon all new lines of railway, wherever 
new stations are established, everything could be 
done. To make a township attractive, the approach 
to it must be attractive. Will not our Western   
-P-A-G-E-167

burghers who are interested in the growth of town- 
ships make a note of this fact, and do somewhat for 
the benefit of the coming generation as well as for 
their own advantage, by so ordering the establish- 
ment of railway stations as to determine and insure 
the attractive features I have named ? 
Landscape Treatment of Railways. 
HILE upon this subject of railway gardens 
and culture, I have a word to say to all who 
have lands adjoining upon these iron clamps of our 
present civilization. A great accession of responsi- 
bility comes to them by reason of their position. A 
slatternly wall, a disgraceful method of tillage, a reek- 
ing level of undrained land, in far away districts, may 
corrupt but few young farmers and confirm them in 
bad practices, by reason of their isolation. But upon 
a great highway of travel, where a thousand eyes 
measure the shortcomings day by day, a good or a 
bad example will have a hundred-fold force. 
It would seem, indeed, as if a shrewd business 
economy would commend care and nicety of tillage. 
The adventurous hair-dressers and fabricators of a 
myriad nostrums, paint their advertisements on the 
rocks; what better advertisement of a farm or garden,

or nursery or wood or meadow, than such equipment 
of them all with the best results of thorough care 
and culture, as to fasten the eye and pique investiga- 
tion? I know:a suburban architect who, by the har- 
monies and order of a homestead, in full view of a 
thousand travellers a day, has doubled his business. 
So the grace of a parterre or the artistic arrangement 
of a terrace or a walk in the eye of so many, may 
make the reputation of a gardener. Every dweller, 
indeed, upon a line of railway, has a reputation to 
make or lose in all that relates to his treatment of 
ground, whether as woodland, farm, or garden. 
If the homestead be so near the clatter of the 
trains as to give too great exposure of the domestic 
offices, good taste, as well as the quiet which most 
country-livers enjoy, will suggest a planting out of 
the line of traffic by thickets of evergreens; and 
these, by their careful adjustment, and occasional 
openings for a glimpse at the more attractive features 
of the situation, will themselves give such a place a 
character. If, however, the house be so remote as to 
admit of all desired seclusion about the dooryard 
and to yield only distant views of the trail of carri- 
ages whirling up their white curls of steam, a mere 
hedge may mark the dividing-line, or some simple 
paling, and the lands between, whether in lawn or 
tillage, may be so ordered as to greet the eye of
-P-A-G-E-169
  WAY-SIDE HINTS. 155 
every intelligent traveller, or impress upon him such 
rural lessons as every adjoining proprietor should 
make it a virtue to teach. 
‘When a farm or country-seat is traversed by a 
deep cutting for the railway bed—so deep as to for- 
bid any extended side views—a tasteful proprietor 
may still mark his lands noticeably, and well, by 
arranging—in concert with the railway officials—an 
easily graded slope upon either side of the cutting, 
which, by a few simple dressings, shall be brought 
into a grassy surface—telling a good story for the 
flats above, and showing upon their extreme height a 
skirting hedge-row or coppice, or possibly the trellis 
of some rustic paling, blooming with flowers, and (if 
convenience of pathway require it) stretching upon 
either side of a bridgelet, across the chasm of the 
road. Even where such cutting is through cliff, noth- 
ing is to forbid the dressing of the higher ledges with 
a few crimson bunches of columbines, to nod their 
heads between the eye of the traveller and the sky, 
and make good report, from their little corners, of the 
people whose every-day walk skirts the cliffs. If a 
gradual slope, or terraces, are admissible by the 
nature of the cutting, it is a question if these may not 
be made to carry their parterres of flowers, or of 
blooming shrubs, to give charm to the borders of an 
estate. I have somewhere seen such slope, whereon
-P-A-G-E-170
156 RURAL STUDIES. 
an adventurous nurseryman had given advertisement 
of his name and calling by an ingenious arrangement 
of his box-borders in gigantic lettering—not, perhaps, 
a very legitimate rural decoration, or such as a severe 
taste would commend—and yet I cannot but think 
that a little trail of fiery flowers, scattered, as it were, 
upon a bank of lawn, and spelling out some graceful 
name (of the homestead), which should be discerni- 
ble only one swift moment as the train flashed by, 
while to one looking forward or backward, it should 
be only a careless ribbon of flowers flecking the green 
—I say I can hardly fancy that this would smack of 
tawdriness. However this may be, devices there are, 
innumerable, for conferring grace upon such sudden 
slopes as I have hinted at: a slope to the north will 
carry admirably its tufts of rhododendron and of 
kalmia, or its confused tangle of hemlocks and Deodar 
cedars. 
The English ivy, too, will grow admirably in such 
situations, upon a ground surface, taking root here 
and there, and covering all the lesser inequalities 
with its glossy network of leaves. Such condition 
of growth, moreover, (trailing over the surface of the 
ground,) insures protection by snows ; or, if that be 
wanting, a thin coating of litter spread over the 
creeper will be an ample defence. The ivy is winter- 
killed, not so much by extreme cold, as by sudden
-P-A-G-E-171
WAY-SIDE HINTS. = SIDE 
alernations of temperature, and exposure of its stiff 
ened leaves to the scalding sunbeams which some- 
times belong even to a northern winter. Protection 
from the January sun is, I believe, as important as 
protection from extreme cold. 
Where the railway passes through a country prop- 
erty upon the same general level with a lawn surface 
or farm lands, the rules for adjustment—of crops or 
of decorative features—so as to carry their best land- 
scape effects, will be comparatively easy. All right 
lines—whether of annual crops, hedge-rows, or ave- 
nues—will, of a surety, lose effect by being established 
parallel to the line of road. At what angle they 
should touch upon it, will be best determined by the 
nature of the surface, and by the conditions of the 
background. 
I know that it is the habit of many who control 
large estates adjoining railways, to ignore, so far as 
possible, this iron neighbor, and to make all their 
plans of improvement with a contemptuous disregard 
of the travelling observers, who count by thousands, 
considering only the few who look on from the old 
high-road, or those, still fewer, who have the privilege 
of the grounds. But in a republican country, this is 
monstrous ; monstrous, indeed, in any country where 
a man properly reckons his responsibilities to his fel- 
lows. If he has conceived new lessons of taste, it is 
 
-P-A-G-E-172
  158 RURAL STUDIES. 
his duty so to illustrate them as to make them command 
the acceptance of the multitude. He has no right to 
ignore the onlook of the world, and be careless if the 
world condemns or approves. 
A high railway embankment traversing the low 
lands of a country estate, if at a good remove from 
the homestead, is not so awkward a matter to deal 
with as might at first be supposed. A few years of 
well-tended growth in a forest screen may be made 
to exclude it altogether; but care should be taken 
lest such screen, by its uniformity, should present the 
same tame outlines with the embankment itself. To 
avoid this, the woody plantation should flow down in 
little promontories of shrubbery upon the flat; it 
should have its open bays upon the embankment it- 
self, disclosing at intervals a glimpse of the passing 
trains; and, above all, the bridge or culvert, which 
keeps good the water-courses of the land, should be 
distinctly indicated, and might have its simple deco- 
rative features, 
All this, if picturesque effect only is aimed at: 
but if it be desirable to utilize such monster embank- 
ment, it may be remembered that its shelter, if look- 
ing to the south, would almost create a summer cli- 
mate of its own, and would make admirable lee for 
the forcing-houses of the gardeners, and for the 
growth of whatever plants or vegetables crave the
-P-A-G-E-173
  WAY-SIDE HINTS. 159 
first heats of the spring sun. The traveller will recall 
the “little Provence,” in the garden of the Tuileries, 
where, by the mere shelter of a twelve-foot terrace wall 
circling around against cool winds, a summer balmi- 
ness is given to the locality even in winter, and phthi- 
sical old men and feeble children find their way 
thither to luxuriate in the sunshine. 
If, on the other hand, such embankment flank the 
north, its shadow will offer capital nursery-ground for 
the rhododendrons, ivies, and all such plants as are 
impatient of the free blast of the sun. 
And, after all, if these happy accidents of posi- 
tion and opportunity did not favor such special culture, 
it should be the duty and the pride of the true artist 
in land-work to ascertain what other growths would 
be promoted by exceptional disturbances of surface. 
The finest and highest triumphs in landscape art are 
wrought out in dealing with portentous features of 
ugliness, and so enleashing them with the harmonies 
of a given plan as to extort admiration. 
The railway, with its present bald embankments, 
and its baldness of all-sorts, is a prominent feature in 
many of our suburban landscapes. It cannot be 
ignored, and the study must be to harmonize its 
sweep of level line, its barren slopes, its ugly scars, 
its deep cuttings, with the order and grace of our 
fields and homes. Rains and weather-stains and wild
-P-A-G-E-174

growths are doing somewhat to mend the harshness ; 
but a little artistic handling of its screening foliage, 
and adroit seizure of the opportunities furnished for 
special culture, will quicken the work. And it is to 
this end that I have thrown out these hints upon so 
novel a subject as that of railway gardening.

Landscape Gardening. 
Ir it an art or a trade that I propose for discus- 
sion? I think it is an art. The backwoodsman 
would not agree with me; there are many plethoric 
* citizens who would not agree. Good roads, and paths 
laid where you want them, and plenty of shade trees 
—is there anything more than this in the laying out 
of grounds? Is there any finesse, any special aptitude 
requisite, or anything that approaches the domain of 
art in managing the matter, as such matter should be 
managed ? 
I think there is; and that it is an art as yet, in 
this country, almost in its infancy; and yet an art 
instinctively appreciated by cultivated persons wher- 
ever it declares itself, whether upon a small ora large 
area.
-P-A-G-E-178
164 RURAL STUDIES. 
We have admirable engineers who can lay down 
an approach road, or other, with easy grades, and 
great grace—so far as the curves count for grace ; and 
we have gardeners who shall lay down your flower- 
beds and grounds for shrubbery according to the 
newest rules, and with great independent beauties in 
themselves ; but it is quite possible that both these 
classes of workers may fill their designs admirably, 
and yet steer clear of the great principles of the art I 
purpose to discuss. It is an art which takes within 
its purview good engineering and good architectural 
work, and good gardening, and good farming, if you 
please; but which looks to their perfect accordance— 
which dominates, in a sense, the individual arts 
named, and accomplishes out of the labors of each a 
congruous and captivating whole. 
Good farming, good gardening, good engineering, 
and good architecture may stand side by side upon a 
given estate, and yet, for want of due conception of 
what the landscape really demands for its completed 
charm, the effect may be incongruous and unsatisfy- 
ing. Over and over again a wealthy proprietor seeks 
to supply the somewhat that is lacking by inordina- 
tive and cumulative expenditure: he may thus make 
outsiders wonder and gape; he may also secure a 
great assemblage of individual beauties; but the 
charming oneness of effect which shall make his place
-P-A-G-E-179
LAYING OUT OF GROUNDS. 165 
an exemplar of taste and a perpetual delight is some- 
how wanting. 
The true art of landscape gardening lies in such 
disposition of roadways, plantations, walks, and build- 
ings as shall most effectively develop all the natural 
beauties of the land under treatment, without con- 
flicting (or rather in harmony) with the uses to which 
such lands may be devoted. Thus, in a private estate, 
home interests and conveniences must be kept steadily 
in view, and these must never be sacrificed for the 
production of a pictuesque effect, however striking in 
itself. Again, in a public park the same law obtains, 
and any good design for such must show great ampli- 
tude of roadway, and broad, open spaces for the dis- 
port of the multitude. Upon farmlands, which I 
hold to be not without the domain of landscape treat- 
ment, there must be due regard to the offices of rural 
economy, and the decorative features may be safely 
brought out in the shape of gateways, belts of pro- 
tecting shrubbery, or scattered coppices upon the 
pasture-lands. Upon ground entirely level, the range 
of possible treatment is, of course, very much limited ; 
but the true artist in landscape effects can do some- 
thing even with this; no architect worthy of the 
name despairs if he is confined to four walls of even 
height ; in his own art, if he loves it, he finds deco- 
rative resources. 
 
-P-A-G-E-180
    166 RURAL STUDIES. 
I have alluded to the possibility of artistic land- 
scape treatment in connection with farm-lands ; this 
opinion is, I am aware, opposed to the traditional 
theory of the British writers upon the subject; but 
we are living in advance of a good many traditions 
of that sort. The Duke of Marlborough keeps the 
open glades of his park-land short and velvety by his 
herd of fallow deer. Our wealthy citizen, on the 
other hand, will probably keep his largest stretch of 
level land in presentable condition with a Buckeye 
Mower, and will depend upon the cutting as a win- 
ter’s baiting for his Alderney heifers; but this will 
not forbid an occasional group of oaks or maples, or _ 
the massing of some graceful shrubbery around an 
intruding cliff. It will never do, indeed, for us as 
Americans to sanction the divorce of landscape from 
our humbler rural intentions—else the great bulk of 
our wayside will be left without law of improvement. 
Not only those broad and striking effects which 
belong to a great range of field and wood, or to bold 
scenery, come within the domain of landscape art, but 
those lesser and orderly graces that may be com- 
passed within stone’s throw of a man’s door. We do 
not measure an artist by the width of his canvas. 
The panoramas that take in mountains are well, if the 
life and the mists of the mountains are in them; but 
they do not blind us to the merit of a cabinet gem.
-P-A-G-E-181
  LAYING OUT OF GROUNDS. 167 
I question very -much if that subtle apprehension of 
the finer beauties which may be made to appear about 
a given locality does not express itself more pointedly 
and winningly in the management of a three or five 
acre lawn, than upon such reach of meadow and 
upland as bounds the view. The watchful care for a 
single hoary boulder that lifts its seared and lichened 
hulk ont of a sweet level of greensward; the auda- 
cious protection of some wild vine flinging its tendrils 
carelessly over a bit of wall, girt with a savage 
hedge-growth—these are indications of an artist feel- 
ing that will be riotous of its wealth upon a bare acre 
of ground. Nay, I do not know but T have seen 
about a laborer’s cottage of Devonshire such adroit 
adjustment of a few flowering plants upon a window- 
shelf, and such tender and judicious care for the little 
matlet of turf around which the gravel path swept to 
his door, as showed as keen an artistic sense of the 
beauties of nature, and of the way in which they may 
be enchained for human gratification, as could be set 
forth in a park of a thousand acres. Of course, I do 
not mean to imply that the man who could fill a 
peasant’s rood of ground with charms of shrub or 
flower, would, by virtue of so humble attainment, be 
competent to produce the larger effects of landscape 
gardening. This would, of course, involve a wider 
knowledge and a different order of experience ; but
-P-A-G-E-182
168 RURAL STUDIES. 
the eye and the taste, which are the final judges, must 
be much the same. 
Farm Landscape. 
N further reference to the possible connection of 
landscape art with lands submitted every year to 
agricultural and economic uses, I propose to examine 
the matter in detail. If all farm-lands showed only 
the method of Alderman Mechi’s, and his system 
of pumping dirty water by steam into the middle of 
any field—to be distributed thence by hose and 
sprinklers—should prevail, we should have, of course, 
only flat surfaces and rectangular fields to deal with. 
But it is safe to say that it will not prevail upon most 
of our American farms for many years to come; yet 
it is none the less true that farm-lands are chiefly 
valued for the crops they will carry, and for the 
annual return they will make. Are lands under such 
rule of management susceptible of an esthetic gov- 
ernance as well? Will treatment with a view to 
profit, discard of necessity all consideration of taste- 
ful arrangement? I think not, and for reasons 
among which I may adduce the following: Judicious 
location of a farm-steading, with a view to profit 
simply, will be always near the centre of the lands 
farmed: this is agreeable, moreover, to every land- 
 
-P-A-G-E-183
LAYING UT OF GROUNDS. 169 
seape-ruling in the matter. The ricks, the chimney, 
the barn-roofs, the dove-cots, the door-yard, with its 
skirting array of shrubbery and shade trees,—if only 
order and neatness belong to them, as good economy 
would dictate,—form a charming nucleus for avy 
stretch of fields. If there be a stream whose power for 
mechanical purposes can be made available, economy 
dictates a location of the farm buildings near to its 
banks: taste does the same. If there be a hill whose 
sheltering slope will offer a warm lee from the north- 
westers, a due regard for the comfort of laborers 
and of beasts, to say nothing of early garden crops, 
will dictate the occupancy of such sheltered position 
by the group of farm buildings: taste will do the 
same. If such slope has its rocky fastness, incapable 
of tillage, and of little value for pasture, economy will 
suggest that it be allowed to develop its own wanton 
wild growth of forest: a just landscape taste will 
suggest the same. If there be a broad stretch of 
meadow or of marsh land, subject to occasional over- 
flow, or by the necessity of its position not capable 
of thorough drainage, good farming will demand that 
it be kept in grass: good landscape gardening will 
do the same. 
Again, such rolling hillsides as belong to most 
farms of the East, and which by reason of their 
declivity or impracticable nature are not readily sub 
8 
 
-P-A-G-E-184
  170 RURAL STUDIES. 
ject to any course of tillage, will be kept in pasture, 
and will have their little modicum of shade. The 
good farmer will be desirous of establishing this 
shade around the brooklet or the spring which waters 
his herd, or as a sheltering belt to the northward and 
westward of his lands: the landscapist cannot surely 
object to this. The same shelter along the wayside 
is agreeable to all aesthetic laws, and does not surely 
militate against any of the economies of farming. 
Indeed, I may remark here, as I have already done in 
the progress of these pages, that the value of a shel- 
tering belt of trees is not sufficiently appreciated as 
yet by practical farmers; but those who are not 
insensible to the quick spring growth under the lee 
of a northern garden-fence, will one day learn that an 
evergreen belt along the northern line of their farms 
will show as decisive a gain in their fields or their 
orcharding, 
Again, in the disposition of roadways, there is no 
rule in landscape gardening which is not applicable 
to a farm. Declivities are to be overcome by the 
easiest practicable grades, and the curves which will 
insure this in most landscapes are those which are - 
justified at a glance by the economic eye, as well as 
by the eye of taste. A straight walk up and down a 
hill, is a monstrosity in park scenery; and it isa 
monstrosity that cannot be found in pasture-lands,
-P-A-G-E-185
  LAYING OUT OF GROUNDS. 171 
where cattle beat their own paths. Even sheep, who 
are good climbers in search of food, whenever they 
wend their way to the fold, take the declivities by 
zigzag, and give us a lesson in landscape art. An 
ox-team, in worming its way through woodland and 
down successive slopes, will describe curves which 
would not vary greatly from the engineering laws of 
adjustment. ; 
Once more, there are certain special features about 
a farm-steading, which may be led to contribute 
largely to landscape effect without violation of econo- 
mic law. These are the ventilators upon the barn 
roof (which no good barn should be without), the 
dove-cots, the chimney-stacks, the ricks (for which a 
nice thatch is an economy), the Dutch barns, with 
their pointed roofs and rustic base, the windmill (if 
one is dependent upon pumps), the orcharding—all 
which may be made to contribute their quota to an 
effective landscape, without great violation of the 
practical aims of the farmer. 
I have dwelt upon this point, because I love to 
believe and to teach that in these respects true taste 
and true economy are accordant, and that the graces 
of life, as well as the profits, may be kept in view by 
every ruralist, whether farmer or amateur. There 
have been certain fermes ornées both in England and 
France (may be in this country too), which I do not
-P-A-G-E-186
172 RURAL STUDIES. 
at all reckon in my estimate of the relations of good 
farming to the positive laws of taste. They are play- 
farms, upon which it is thought necessary, (however 
flat the surface,) to give to the fields all manner of 
irregular and curvilinear shapes. Such an arrange- 
ment is to every judicious farmer an affront. If a- 
field takes irregular shape for sufficient reason—in its 
surface, or encroachment of cliff, border territory, or 
water,—well and good; the farmer can account for 
it, and accommodate his labors to it. But ifit bea 
fantasy merely, which requires him to back his team 
and give inequality to his “lands,” his common-sense 
revolts at it; he sees an empty device that interrupts 
his labor and provokes his conterapt. The contempt, 
I think, any man of true taste will share with him. 
There is nothing horrible in a straight line (what- 
ever some gardeners may think) upon flat surfaces. 
I am inclined, indeed, to favor strongly the old Dutch 
instinct for long clipped avenues, and for the straight 
belts of trees along their water-courses, in Holland. 
Why should they puzzle themselves with curves, 
where no curves were needed? Or over the great 
sheep plains of Central France, what mockery it 
would have been to conduct a highway (or any other 
way for convenience) by the meanderings which 
belong so naturally to a highway of Devonshire! 
Of course, I speak of landscape here in a large
-P-A-G-E-187
LAYING OUT OF GROUNDS. 173 
way. Aman may very properly have his door-yard 
and garden curvatures upon a plane surface, if they 
be accounted for by judicious planting. I have even 
seen little hillocks thrown up upon a two-acre patch 
of adroitly arranged pleasure-ground which suggested 
agreeably larger and more graceful hillocks near by 
that were not attainable. But a man who should 
undertake the building of a considerable hill in a 
level country to relieve the monotony, would very 
likely have his labor for his pains. Even the great 
tumulus upon the field of Waterloo, upon which the 
Belgian lion snuffs the air, had to me always a most 
absurd look of impropriety. A group of white head- 
stones or a column of marble would have told more 
gracefully the story of the Belgian dead. The stu- 
pendous rock-work at Chatsworth, again, always ap- 
peared to me a most monstrous waste of good honest 
material and honest labor. It is very costly and 
expensive ; but one of the least of God’s cliffs would 
overshadow it utterly. Its artificiality cannot cheat 
one who knows what rocks are in the fissures of the 
hills; and he looks upon it, at best, with the same 
sort of foolish wonderment with which he looks upon 
the wooden puppets in the Dutch gardens of Broek. 
Thus much I have written to show, so far as I 
might, that the small landholder can avail himself 
of the laws of the best landscape art, and in virtue
-P-A-G-E-188
  174 RURAL STUDIES. 
of them can confirm and establish the neatness and 
order of his fields. There is, indeed, an artificiality 
about his straight lines of crops, and his rectangular 
enclosures which does not tempt the painter; but it 
is an artificiality that excuses itself. There 1s a fitness 
and propriety in it, which, when contrasted, as it 
may be, with the farmer’s clumps of pasture shade, 
his wayside trees, and his leafy screen of the farm 
buildings, is not without a certain charm. 
Lands not Farmed. 
HERE is, however, a higher grade of landscape 
beauty than can belong to lands tilled for their 
economic returns, just as there is a higher grade of 
man than the agricultural laborer. I propose to 
indicate some of the methods by which this higher 
beauty may be made to declare itself. First of all, in 
the immediate neighborhood of every country home- 
stead, (the site and architecture being already deter- 
mined on, and not, therefore, subject to present dis- 
cussion,) there must be neatness and order; no 
tangled weedy growth, no paths half matted over: 
there must be abundant evidence of that presiding 
and watchful care without which every homestead, 
whether within or without, lacks its most considera- 
ble charm. If the beauty of the remoter landscape 
 
-P-A-G-E-189

LAYING OUT' OF GROUNDS. 175 
lie in its wild and unkempt condition, the contrast’ of 
extreme care at the house-side with such savagery, 
will be all the more engaging. And if the beauty of 
the outer landscapes lie merely in graceful and undu- 
lating forms, care around the doorstep will be requi- 
site to mark definitely the outflow of the domestic 
wants and infiuences. The path I tread ten times a 
day should be smooth; the patch of croquet ground 
should be reduced to absolute level, and any intrud- 
ing tussock be shorn away from reach of the tender- 
footed gamesters; but the walk along the further 
hill-side, where I go only after a long reach of days, 
may be only a tramped foot-path on the sward; and 
the stretch of turf-land where the Alderneys are feed- 
ing may have its eyelets of dandelion and ‘golden 
buttercups. But the care and order of which I speak 
should not be a finical nicety. Martinetism is odious 
everywhere. It must be acare that shall conceal 
itself—that shall be marked by the lack of every- 
thing disagreeable, and not be cognizable by traces 
of a recent broom or roller. The scar of a spade-cut 
is an unpleasant reminder of the art which is best 
when all traces of its mechanical devices are out of 
sight. Of course, there must be clippings and roll- 
ings, but they should be so deftly done, and with such 
watchfulness, as regards season, as to make the 
observer forget they had ever been used.

Again, it comes within the domain of landscape 
art to secure an agreeable lookout from the door and 
the cherished windows of the country homestead, 
whatever may be its situation. Accident or choice 
of site may, indeed, secure this beyond question ; 
but, site being established, where views are limited 
or obnoxious objects fret the eye, it is surprising 
what may be done by judicious planting, and the 
re-adjustment of walls or fencing or hedging, to offer 
the pleasant lookout we demand, though it be bound- 
ed by a gunshot. With a reach of twenty rods 
before one’s eye and in one’s keeping, there is no 
possible excuse for not giving it charming objects to 
rest upon—objects that will not pall, but grow upon 
the affections of every true lover of the country. 
Your neighbor’s slatternly barn troubles you— 
plant it out; the toss of the tops of hemlocks will 
not be odious. A wavy bald wall irritates you; if 
needed as a barrier, cover it with wild vines, or flank 
it with hedging, or so plant your coppices on either 
side, in and out, that its line shall be indistinguish- 
able. Is there a low bit of sedgy ground that can be 
made nothing of, for the reason that the adjoining 
proprietor (who holds the lower lands) will enter 
into none of your schemes of drainage? Plant it 
with rhododendrons and the red-berried alder ; or if 
it be a mere morass, tumble into it a few of the
-P-A-G-E-191
  LAYING OUT OF GROUNDS. 177 
mossy stones from the higher slopes, and equip it 
with the wood-ferns or clematis. There is no spot, 
indeed, so ungainly that it cannot be cheated of its 
roughness by such appliances of bush and vine and 
plant as our own woods will furnish; no stretch of 
lawn so meagre that you may not throw across it 
morning and afternoon, such splintered bars of light 
and shadow from its encompassing trees as will 
charm the looker-on. In all places of limited range, 
and which, from the necessities of position, are with- 
out wide-reaching views, it is doubtful if the eye 
should be allowed to rest upon any very determinate 
and defined barrier, as marking the extreme limit of 
the grounds. An irregular belt of wood or lesser 
growth of shrubbery will offer pleasant concealment 
and take away the sharpness of limitation, while some 
picturesque feature in a neighbor’s grounds beyond, 
though it be only a dove-cot or the ventilator upon 
the barn-roof, or a gardener’s cottage, may, by the 
vagueness and indeterminate character of the inter- 
yening barrier, become more surely yours by the pos- 
session of the eye. It is specially the province of the 
art we are considering, to avail itself of all within 
reach of the view, whatever may lie between, and 
make it contribute to the oneness of the home pic- 
ture. True art does not inquire who made the pig: 
ments, or whose name they bear, but only, will they 
gt
-P-A-G-E-192
  
  178 RURAL STUDIES. 
add to the effect of the work in hand? If, by cut- 
ting a few trees from the copse upon the hill-side, I 
can bring my neighbor’s broad-armed windmill into 
view, I am taking a very legitimate means of availing 
myself of his expenditure; and if the usual anchor- 
age-ground for my neighbor’s yacht is shut off only 
by a tuft of shrubbery upon my lawn, I will cut it 
away and enjoy his yacht (at anchorage) as much as 
he. 
There are many country places which from their 
position, possess an outlook so broad and grand as 
to demand no consideration of special views, and 
where landscape art will find range not only in the 
ordering of lesser details, but in partial concealment 
of the beauties that confront the eye. The situations 
to which I allude are upon such range of highland as 
to offer—yvery likely from the adjoining public road—a 
similar width of view; but the house-view must have 
some special consecration of its own—some veil of 
intervening foliage may be, through which the ravish- 
ing distance shall come by glimpses; some embower- 
ment of trees, under which, as in a rural framing, the 
great picture of the rivers and the mountains shall 
take new sightliness ; some tortuous walk through im- 
penetrable shrubberies, from the midst of whose dim- 
ness you shall suddenly burst out upon the glory of 
the far landscape. Such devices are needful not only
-P-A-G-E-193
LAYING OUT OF GROUNDS. 179 
to qualify the monotony of one unvarying scene, be- 
wildering from its very extent—not only to distinguish 
the home view from that of every plodder along the 
highway, but furthermore, and chiefly, to show such 
traces of art management as shall quicken the zest 
with which the natural beauties, as successively un- 
folded, are enjoyed. A great scene of mountains, or 
river, or sea, or plain, is indeed always a great scene; 
but in the presence of it a country home is not neces- 
sarily a beautiful home. To this end, the art that 
deals with landscape effect must wed the home to the 
view ; must drape the bride, and teach us the piquant 
value of a “ coy, reluctant, amorous delay.” 
Again, it should be a cardinal rule in landscape 
art (as in all other art, I think) not to multiply means 
for producing a given effect. Where one stroke of 
the brush is enough, two evidence weakness, and 
three incompetency. If you can secure a graceful 
sweep to your approach-road by one curve, two are 
an impertinence. If a clump of half a dozen trees 
will effect the needed diversion of the eye and pro- 
duce the desired shade, any additions are worse than 
needless. If some old lichened rock upon your lawn 
is grateful to the view, do not weaken the effect by 
multiplying rocks. Simple effects are the purest and 
best effects as well in landscape art as in moral 
teaching.
-P-A-G-E-194

A single outlying boulder will often illustrate by 
contrast the smoothness of a lawn better than the 
marks of a ponderous roller. One or two clumps of 
alders along the side of a brooklet will designate its 
course more effectively and pleasantly than if you 
were to plant either bank with willows. A single 
spiral tree in a coppice will be enough to bring out 
all the beauty of a hundred round-topped ones. Be- 
cause some simple rustic gate has a charming effect 
at one point of your grounds, do not for that reason 
_ repeat it in another. Because the Virginia creeper 
_ makes a beautiful autumn show, clambering into the 
tops of one of your tall cedars with its five-lobed 
crimson leaflets, do not therefore plant it at the foot 
of all your cedars. Because at some special point the 
red rooflet of a gateway lights up charmingly the 
green of your lawn, and fastens the eye of visitors, 
do not for that reason make all your gateways with 
red rooflets. If some far-away spire of a country 
church comes through some forest vista to your eye, 
do not perplex yourself by cutting forest pathways to 
other spires. 
_ Again, (and I think I have trenched upon this topic 
previously in the course of these pages,) every pos- 
sessor and improver of a country estate, however 
small or however large, should work upon clearly 
defined plans, decided upon from the beginning. I
-P-A-G-E-195
LAYING OUT OF GROUNDS. 181 
do not mean to say that diagrams and surveyor’s 
maps ‘may be positively necessary, provided the 
director of the improvements has a clear understand- 
ing of the boundaries and surface, and a clear under- 
standing of the effects he wishes to accomplish. I 
only insist that promiscuous planting, and the laying 
down of paths, little by little, or year by year, with- 
out reference, clear and constant, to the final results, 
and to a plan that shall embrace the whole property, 
will involve great waste of labor, and the inevitable 
undoing in the future of what may be done to-day. 
Of course, where such work is intrusted to a corps 
of gardeners and laborers, complete diagrams will be 
necessary ; and it is only where the constant personal 
supervision of the director, whether proprietor or 
other, can be counted on, that such detailed exhibit 
of the work in hand can be dispensed with. No 
general plan, such as I refer to, can be safely matured 
without, first, full and intimate knowledge of the 
ground and its environs, and, second, a clear under- 
standing of the intentions and tastes of the proprietor 
under whose occupancy the plan is to reach fulfil- 
ment. 
Ido not at all mean to say that the laws of taste 
in respect to landscape art are to meet revision 
at the will of any chance proprietor, or that the art 
itself has not its elemental principles which no occu- 
 
-P-A-G-E-196
  182 RURAL STUDIES. 
pant of a country estate can safely disturb. But one 
landholder has a penchant for agriculture, and wishes 
to make all the available acres contribute to his taste 
for cattle or crops; another has a horticultural mania, 
and wishes the outlay to take such a shape as shall 
most contribute to his special pursuit ; still another 
foresees a demand for his acres as villa sites, and 
desires such arrangement as shall best contribute to 
their conversion into some half-dozen or more of 
attractive homesteads; and yet another wishes such 
improvement as shall best develop the natural features 
of the place, and insure the most economic treatment 
of the same, without any view to future sale, or to 
whims, whether horticultural or agricultural. 
Now it is strictly within the province of land- 
scape art to meet either or all of these views without 
violation of its elemental principles. I have already 
intimated how far the offices of husbandman and his 
methods of culture may be subordinated to good 
landscape effect: of horticulture this is even more 
true. In laying out with a view to ultimate division 
of country property for villa sites, there are certain 
difficulties in the way. In a general sense, it is true 
that the more you make beautiful a country property, 
the more you make it inviting for country residences. 
But landscape design with a view to a single owner- 
ship and a single home establishment must needs be
-P-A-G-E-197
  LAYING OUT OF GROUNDS. 183 
different from one which looks to the dispersion of 
the property into a dozen lesser homes. Absolute unity 
of plan will, in such a case, be naturally out of the ques- 
tion. There must be some measure of sacrifice to the 
contingencies reckoned upon; no sacrifice of charm, 
indeed, when the purpose is understood: six adjoin- 
ing sites, well ordered, and planted with a view to 
future occupancy, may embrace a thousand beauties, 
but will not, of course, preserve that unity of effect 
which would belong to a single permanent property. 
On the score of taste, a competent landscape-gar- 
dener has no need to compare notes with the pro- 
prietor of country property ; but he should be put in 
full possession of all the economies of his plan. Does” 
he wish a reservation for agricultural purposes, for 
vineyard, for orcharding, more than will be essential 
to his household supply ? Does he count upon subse- 
quent division of the property for building purposes ? 
These questions should meet full discussion and 
the outlay be adjusted thereby. But it is unfortu- 
nately true that half the owners of country estates 
entertain no considerations of this kind, and, entering 
upon their improvements with a vague improvidence, 
find after a lapse of years, the bulk of them useless 
and inconvertible. City improvements may be under- 
taken without long look into the future ; errors may 
be amended as fast as brick and mortar can be piled
-P-A-G-E-198
  184 RURAL STUDIES. 
together ; but great trees do not grow in a night, or 
ina year. In America, we must count upon divisions 
and subdivisions of property. Great ancestral estates 
will nowhere be long ancestral. Our republican mill 
grinds them sharply. Hence we lack, and must 
always lack that artistic dealing with country estates 
which can count upon oneness of proprietorship for an 
indefinite period of years. Better to admit this in 
the beginning, and let our landscape art take its form 
accordingly, than to weary itself with imitation of 
what is feudally and mercilessly old. Nothing can 
cheat us, indeed, of the beauty of God’s trees and 
flowers and wood-paths. Nature is as much to the 
occupant of a fifty-acre holding, as to the Duke of 
Devonshire, or the Marquis of Buccleugh. But half 
a thousand acres of sylvan glade and of velvety turf 
cannot be maintained with us from generation to 
generation as the feeding ground for fallow deer ; it 
may, however, have such keeping and embellishment 
as shall fit it for a score of fair homes. Better the 
homes with cheerfulness in them than the deer-park 
with want shivering beyond the walls. 
City and Town Parks. 
\HE office of a park is wholly different from that 
of a village green; the same demands do not
-P-A-G-E-199
LAYING OUT OF GROUNDS. 185 
suggest the two. The city square or plaza is the city 
representative of the village common: this latter 
being only a rural plaza whereon the green-sward is 
a more economic and appropriate pavement than 
stones ; the incessant traffic and wear of a metropolis 
do not blot the grass. 
The park represents not only a demand for space 
and trees, but a revival and reassertion of country 
instincts which city associations are only too apt to 
infold and entomb ; but, however drearily infolded, 
there comes some day to all denizens of cities a resur- 
rection of those earlier rural instincts which crave 
growth and food—an outburst, through all the stony 
interstices of pavement, of the love of trees and 
green things. Not until a city has become so large 
as to deny to very many living in its interior intimate 
association and familiarity with the encompassing 
belt of country will this new need declare itself 
strongly. Nay, in a city, whose elevated situation, 
gives outlook from its open spaces upon great fields 
of greenness around it, such need of park land will 
not for a long period of years be felt. 
Eventually, not only will the instinctive rural 
longings of the masses stimulate to this struggle to 
recover the lost birthright of trees and turf, but the 
very vanities of city growth will demand a larger 
airing than populous streets can supply ; and the man
-P-A-G-E-200
  
  186 RURAL STUDIES. 
who loves a sleek team, and indulges in its display, 
will vie with the workman (who wants romping 
place for his children) in clamor for a public park. 
If our vanities and our healthful tastes were always 
as closely yoked, we ‘should have a better growth 
from the yoking. However, it may come about— 
whether from the natural impulses of a crowded 
population to ally themselves once again with the 
bounteous amplitude of the fields, or whether from 
the artificial desire to give room and exhibition to 
equipages—it is undeniable that all towns of ambi- 
tious pretensions and of assured and rapid growth do, 
after a certain period of street packing, bestir them- 
selves in a feverish way to secure some easy lounging- 
place under the trees. Unfortunately the stir is, for 
the most part, at so late a day, that all available or 
desirable localities have been secured for other pur- 
poses. But, whatever the alternative of cost, I can- 
not learn that such en enterprise, when thoroughly 
matured and in complete operation, has ever proved a 
disappointment. I have never heard of a disposition 
on the part of voters to rescind any appropriation for 
such a purpose, and to convert a public garden or 
park to economic uses. I never heard of an instance 
where pride did not speedily attach to the public 
grounds, if accessivle and well cared for, and where 
the people of such a town did not make a boast and 
a glory of the endowment.
-P-A-G-E-201
       LAYING OUT OF GhOUNDS. 187 
Even in countries where such far-sighted improve- 
ments are effected by the force majeure of an Imperial 
edict, popular resentments or revolutions never find 
their leverage in such tokens of extravagance. There 
are not a thousand men in Paris, rich or poor, who 
would make quarrel with Louis Napoleon for the 
millions lavished upon the Bois de Boulogne, or the 
appointments of the Park Monceau. But there were 
tens of thousands of malcontents, in Louis Philippe’s 
time, with the fortification bill, and the inclosure for 
private uses, of a terrace of the garden of the Tuil- 
leries. The people may not, indeed, have a very clear 
sense of their wants in the matter of a public park, 
but once supply them attractively and accessibly, and 
they feel the appositeness of the supply, and cling to 
it with as much obstinacy as pride. 
We Americans have a way of shrinking from pro- 
spective taxation, whatever the purpose of it may be; 
but when once fairly saddled with it, whether for the 
benefit of corporations or monopolies or public im- 
provements, we bear it with a most admirable un- 
flinchingness. The costs of public gardens or parks, 
if well ordered, and not made the vehicle of private 
peculation, are not such as would create a remon- 
strance from the people of any American city; and 
the difficulty in the way of establishment would 
lie not so much in a general spirit of hostility to    
-P-A-G-E-202
  188 RURAL STUDIES. 
increased taxation, (though that spirit, as I have 
hinted, has a wonderful catlike watchfulness,) as in 
the private jealousies that must be harmonized before 
any large real estate improvement is practicable. I 
defy any benevolent gentleman, in a town of thirty 
thousand active, and newspaper-reading inhabitants, 
to propose a scheme for a public garden or park, upon 
a designated spot of ground, without starting an 
angry buzz of opposition from other equally benevo- 
lent gentlemen, who see in it only a device to bring 
about the rapid appreciation of property which is not 
their own. The quick-sightedness with which the 
philanthropists of one side of a smallish city will detect 
flaws in the philanthropy of men living on the other 
side of a smallish city, is indeed something marvellous. 
Thus it happens that some brave and honest project: 
for park or water supply, or sewerage, will welter for 
years in some slough of opposing doubts, all whose 
obstructing slime is made up of such miserable, local 
jealousies as I have hinted at. The same traces of 
satanic influence belong, I think, to the philosophers 
who make up our national Congress, so that our 
best bits of legislation seem to come upon us by ac- 
cident, when our wisest legislators are asleep, or tired, 
or   
‘worse. 
In the days of our present civilization and educa- 
tion, it is hardly to be doubted that the majority of
-P-A-G-E-203
  LAYING OUT OF GROUNDS. + BO 
intelligent voters in any considerable town would 
declare for the utility of a public park or garden; 
but whether their wishes can be made effective for 
the establishment of such a result is another ques- 
tion, and one which must drift into the arena of town 
polities—where I leave it ; proposing only to discuss 
here some of the aims of such an endowment, some 
of the possibilities in that direction, the conditions 
of its success, and permanent usefulness to the 
masses. 
Place for Parks, 
RST of all, a public park should be as near as 
possible to the town ; best of all, perhaps, if in 
the very centre of the town, or, as in the case of some 
of the old walled towns of Europe, girting it with a 
circle of green. I hardly think any public gardens 
of the world contribute more to the health and enjoy- 
ment of the adjacent population than those of Frank- 
fort-on-the-Main, which lie all about their homes, and 
which are planted upon the line of the old fortifica- 
tions. Even the ill-kept walks upon the ancient walls 
of Chester and York (in England), by their nearness 
to the homes of the people, and by the delightful out- 
look they offer, are among the most cherished prome- 
nades I know. But with us, who have no girting
-P-A-G-E-204
    190 RURAL STUDIES. 
walls, and rarely vacant spaces about our commercial 
centres, these pleasant breathing-places must be 
pushed into the outskirts of our towns. I say:   
rarely 
vacant spaces; but while I write, there occur to me 
instances of beautiful opportunities neglected, one of 
which, at least, I will record. The thriving little city 
of Norwich, in eastern Connecticut, is situated at the 
confluence of two rivers, which form the Thames. 
Along either shore of the Yantic and the Shetucket, 
the houses of the town are picturesquely strewed in 
patches of white and gray; but between the rivers 
and the lines of houses, the land rises into a great 
promontory of hill—toward the east, forming a Sal- 
vator-Rosa cliff, shaggy with brush-wood and cedars— 
toward the south and west, a steep declivity on which 
the swiftly slanting sward-land is spotted with out- 
cropping ledges; to the north a gradual slope falls 
easily away to the great plains, where lie the bulk of 
the suburban residences. Within twenty or thirty 
years the whole upper surface of this central hillock 
might have been secured for the merest. bagatelle, and 
would have made one of the proudest public prome- 
nades imaginable, accessible to all walkers from the 
south and east, and to all equipages from the north, 
and offering level plateau for drives that would have 
commanded the most enchanting of views; but the 
oceasion has gone by; inferior houses hold their

uneasy footing on the hill-side, and a gaunt-jail, 
which is the very apotheosis of ugliness, crowns this 
picturesque height, 
Another little city, that of Hartford, in the neigh- 
bor State of Connecticut, has made the most of its 
opportunities by converting into a charming public 
garden a weary waste of ground that lay between its 
railway station and the heart of the city. The op- 
portunity was not large, to be sure, but it was one 
that needed a keen eye for its development, and the 
result has shown that commercial thrift may not 
unfrequently take its lesson with profit from the sug- 
gestions of a cultivated taste. There is many a 
growing town having somewhere within its borders 
such unsuspected aptitude and capability, that only 
needs an eye to discern it, and the requisite enterprise 
to develop in the very heart of the population a 
garden and a public promenade that would become a 
joy forever. It must be remembered, furthermore, 
that it is quite impossible to make such transmutation 
of waste and unsightly places into an attractive area 
of garden-land, without increasing enormously the 
taxable value of all surrounding property. I recall 
now, in one of our most thriving seaside cities, a 
great slough of oozy tidemud of many acres in 
extent, shut off from the harbor front by a low rail- 
way embankment, showing here and there a riotous
-P-A-G-E-206
  
  192 RURAL STUDIES. 
overgrowth of wild sedges, foul with heaps of 
garbage, uninviting in every possible way, and yet 
lying within stone’s throw of the centre of the city. 
Sandy highlands, almost totally unimproved, flank it 
immediately upon the west—disposed there, as it 
would seem, for the very purpose of furnishing easy 
material for the filling in of the flat below. A few 
thousands would accomplish this, and judicious plant- 
ing and outlay would in three years’ time establish a 
charming promenade or garden in the centre of the 
sea-front of the town, and there is not one of the 
adjoining pieces of property but would be doubled in 
value by the operation. The neglect of such oppor- 
tunities, whether due to miserable local jealousies, or, 
as often happens, to the short-sightedness and indif- 
ference of municipal authorities, is surely not compli- 
mentary to our civilization. ‘ 
The term “ near to town,” in these times of horse 
railways, has rather a relative than positive signifi- 
cance. Three miles, by a fair, broad avenue, upon 
which well-equipped cars are making their rounds 
every half hour of the day, is not half so large a 
distance for either the laboring or the business man 
to compute, as a mile and a half of ill-kept, old- 
fashioned turnpike road. 
The truth is, that citizens of sleepy towns in the 
interior are losing their reckoning about distances ;
-P-A-G-E-207
  LAYING OUT OF GROUNDS. 193 
they have not been educated to metropolitan esti- 
mates. The Wall Street man sneers at two miles of 
walk before business ; your small broker of a country 
city, on the other hand, advertises for a tenement 
“within half a mile of the post-office.” I never see 
such an advertisement but I think some Rip Van 
Winkle has just waked, and that his friends should 
give him a combing and nursing. 
Ready accessibility is the true measure of distance 
in our day, and a town park must be easily accessible 
to all classes. It must be a matter in which the 
humblest citizens can take pride and comfort. Those 
cities which have considerable open spaces in the 
” “ oveen,” or “ squares,” scattered shape of “ common, 
here and there, are the last to wake to any need of a 
park which shall give drives, and such sources of 
diversion as belong legitimately to a public park. 
The central commons and greens may do very well 
in the early stages of a city’s growth, but there comes 
a time when the municipal edicts forbid ball-playing 
and cricket, at which date there is reason to plan 
some larger forage ground for our youthful sports. 
And it is precisely this forage ground for the 
developing muscle of Young America that the town 
park should furnish. Cricket ground, base-ball 
ground, and parade ground for the ambitious troops 
of the municipality should be as sedulously cared for

as a good roadway for carriages. A skating pond 
would belong fitly to the requirements, and, if no 
river or harbor offered better space, an opportunity 
for boating would be wisely included. It is not 
supposed that a feasible spot of ground in the neigh- 
borhood of most cities can command and make good 
these requirements. But much more can be done 
than is imagined if the best available talent is secured 
for the work in hand. Even in our fast days, it is 
quite wonderful to find what a multitude of people 
go to sleep upon advantages which, judiciously 
ordered, would make them rich. There is many a 
river valley, in the close neighborhood of cities, 
covered now with rank and unprofitable grasses, over 
which, at small cost, might be given flow toa lake 
that would wash on either shore the banks of high- 
lands, admirably fitted for drives, and already clothed 
with the forest growth of half a century. 
Equipment of Public Gardens. 
S T have already said, it is requisite that a town 
park should offer a charming drive; so far 
charming that every townsman will feel it incum- 
bent on him to give each stranger guest a full view 
of its attractions. These latter must lie, either in 
commanding views of the town itself and its environs,
-P-A-G-E-209
  LAYING OUT OF GROUNDS. 195 
or in landscape etfects which have been wrought out 
by skill and attention in the park itself. Neither 
Hyde Park nor the Bois de Boulogne offer any com- 
manding range of view; the delights all lie in the 
neatly kept roadway, the flanking lakes and parterres, 
the bright, green slopes of shaven turf; at Richmond 
Hill or on the Pincian at Rome, on the other hand, 
you forget the roadway, you forget the bits of pretty 
turflet, you ignore the copses, you are careless of the 
odor of flowers, for your eye, carrying all your per- 
ceptive faculties in its reach, leaps to the fair vision 
of flood and field and trees, which sweep away, in 
sun and in shadow, to the horizon. 
Undoubtedly if the surface of adjoining country 
will permit, it will be far less expensive to establish 
a park whose charm shall lie in exterior views than 
one whose. attractions shall consist in what the pro- 
fessional men call (by use of an abominable word) its 
gardenesque features. Yet, with such economic pur- 
pose, it will never do to go too far in the country. 
It must never be forgotten with us that the men of 
equipages are by no means the only class who are to 
participate in our esthetical progress ; the town park, 
to have its best uses, must not only be within easy 
reach by walk or by the street tramway, but it must 
have, too, its spaces of level ground to allure the 
cricket or the base-ball players, Areas should be

ample enough to prevent the possible interference of 
these sports, (which every sensible township would 
do well to encourage,) with the enjoyment of a quiet 
dviye. 
While there is no need for making the wood of a 
public park a complete arboretum, I think that 
special care should be taken to give specimens of all 
the best known timber and shade trees, and that 
these should be definitely marked with their botanical 
as well as popular names, so that strollers might come 
to a pleasant lesson in their seasons of idleness. The 
particular habits of individual specimens and of forest 
growths might, I think, be safely and profitably 
noted as lending additional interest to them, and 
creating a sort of fellowship with the trees. Every 
forester knows that oaks and maples of the same 
species have yet idiosyncrasies of their own—one 
blooming a full fortnight before its neighbor, and 
another ‘taking a tawny hue, while its companion is 
still in full array of green. In the garden of the 
Tuilleries there is a chestnut which enjoys the tradi- 
tional repute of showing leaflets upon the twentieth of 
March (hence called Vingt de Mars), and the vener- 
able old tree, well known to every frequenter of the 
garden, has come to have a character of sanctity by 
reason of this early welcome of the spring. In a field 
within sight of my own door, there is a sugar-maple

LAYING OUT' OF GROUNDS. 197 
which, by some fault in the planting, or some inherent 
defect in the tree, has made little or no growth these 
last six years, and which every August—a full month 
before the earliest of its companions—takes on a 
hectic flush of color, which it carries, with the buoy- 
ancy of a consumptive, all through the autumn. This 
accident of coloring gives an individuality and in- 
terest to the tree which distinguishes it from all its 
stalwart and thrifty fellows. 
I do not think a town park can ever safely be 
mated with a trotting course; either the trotting or 
the park will go under. It is not intended to speak 
against trotting-courses, or greased pigs, or the climb- 
ing of greased poles; but the arena for these sports 
is not usually such a one as to entice a quiet family 
man toa park drive. Quiet family men are not, to 
be sure, very plentiful, and are not much considered 
nowadays; they still subsist, however, ‘in sufficient 
nunbers to give astale flavor of respectability to many 
of our growing provincial towns, and to shape, to a 
certain degree, the municipal improvments. The love 
for fast trotters and for trotting matches is so decided 
an American taste that a good trotting-course will 
become a cherished institution in every town of a 
. dozen or fifteen thousand inhabitants. Indeed, I 
think its establishment may be regarded as a kind of 
necessary safety-valve, through which unusual speed 
 
-P-A-G-E-212

and the accompanying howls may be worked off 
safely without frightening staid old gentlemen who 
keep to the quiet high-roads. A good flat, a good 
bottom, and a good amphitheatre of seats, are about 
all the requisites of an approved trotting-course, and 
anything picturesque in the way of trees or decora- 
tive features is an impertinence. There is no fear, 
therefore, that the trotting taste will ever have large 
interference with the demand for public parks. 
It is a common mistake, I think, to imagine that 
anything like a finical nicety in the arrangement of 
turf or walks or parterres is essential to the perma- 
nent and larger utilities of a town park. This, in- 
deed, involves great cost, and diverts from larger and 
more important ends. A flock or two of South- 
Downs, confined by movable hurdles, and under 
charge of some custodian, who might have his rural 
cottage at the gate of entrance, would keep turf in 
very presentable condition. After this, good drain- 
age, hard gravelled roads—subject to monthly rolling 
—and judiciously disposed clumps of shade, are the 
main things; following upon which, as the town 
grows in taste or ability, the parterres of flowers and 
the arboretum and observatory might be superadded. 
But quite above and beyond our present question 
of treatment is the larger one of gaining, in due time, 
possession of available space. No town that counts
-P-A-G-E-213
  
  LAYING OUT OF GROUNDS. 199 
upon its thirty or forty thousand inhabitants within 
the next score of years should neglect it. There can 
be no loss in its becoming a large landholder within 
its own territory. If the charming but costly dis- 
guisements of a park cannot be ventured upon at 
once, the land may at least be turned over into a 
town farm, where the town’s poor may be set to the 
work of combing down its roughness or preparing it 
by slow degrees, earning their own support, mean- 
time, for the richer ends in view. The scheme is by 
no means chimerical ; scores of workers, through the 
less active months of the year, and who are dependent 
on the town for partial support, might thus be put to 
remunerative labor upon the town property. A 
judicious design of a park as a finality upon the land 
in question might underlie, in a measure, and qualify 
the regular farm labors. A well-appointed drive 
might gradually uncoil itself over the hills and 
through the cultivated flats, the wood crop out upon 
the cliffs, and the flowers unfold in their sequestered 
nooks. It seems to me that a park or garden, grow- 
ing up in this way by degrees under the tutelage of 
the town, not fairly throwing off its economic and 
food-providing aspect until the plantations have rip- 
ened into fulness, would have a double charm. I 
commend the suggestions to such boroughs as keep 
their town’s poor festering in some ill-ventilated alms-

house, with limited grounds, in the foulest suburb of 
the place. 
Burying Grounds. 
VERY considerable town requires, or will 
require at no late day, not only fields for the 
disport of its living swarms, but other fields (requir- 
ing exceptional care of their own) for the interment 
of its throng of dead. Indeed, the living can steal 
some chance moments of rural enjoyment, by burst- 
ing into fields and gardens of their neighbors, or by 
plunging into untamed wilds; but a man cannot steal 
a grave: there is no larceny possible to us of some 
charming spot upon a neighbor’s hill-side where- our 
bones may rest. 
I cannot quite share in what seems to be the 
popular disposition nowadays—to make a favorite, if 
not fashionable drive of the cemetery. That it should 
be beautiful, that it should carry report of the delight- 
some things of every season in its flowers, its fading 
wealth of leaves, its evergreens, I can well under- 
stand. But that it should be made voyant, inviting 
chance-comers, offering views of sea or environs, 
cheating one into the belief that he is in a well-kept 
garden, and not among graves, lured thither by views 
or prettinesses of landscape design and not by the
-P-A-G-E-215
LAYING OUT OF GROUNDS. 201 
memories or the sentiment of. the place—this is awk- 
ward. Hence, it seems to me that a sheltered hill- 
side, a glen, a protected valley, are far more appro- 
priate than a plain, scalding in the sun, or heights 
which invite by a great range of exterior views. 
Tastes will differ widely in this regard; but it 
certainly does appear as if the whirl of lively and 
clattering equipages day after day along the edges of 
the graves of quiet men would make a terribly per- 
turbed sleep for them; and if real grief ever stalk 
thither to pay a last melancholy tribute, it must 
needs make a sad public exhibition of itself, or prac- 
tise a galling reticence. 
In dealing with the question of a public cemetery, 
adequate to the needs of a growing population—as in 
the question of a public park,—our larger towns show 
a provoking delay, blinding themselves year after 
year to the necessities of the case, and deferring 
positive action, until the needed investment assumes 
gigantic proportions. There are scores of towns 
whose cemeteries are absolutely brimming with the 
dead, who yet take no decisive measures for an 
increase of the privilege we all sigh for at last—of a 
quiet sleep under trees. 
Among the requisites for a country cemetery are to 
be named, I think, first, a distance not exceeding forty 
minutes drive from town; next, a feasible soil, and one 
g* 
 
-P-A-G-E-216
202 RURAL STUDIES. 
not underlaid with ledges. An absolutely dry soil is 
also desirable, and a sheltered position: for in the 
last tender offices of respect to the dead, we are 
exposed to all seasons, and a harsh sweep of northerly 
winds adds dismally to the chill of a wintry burial. 
I think we love to catch, too, in such localities, the 
first warm beat of the spring sunshine, and that we 
welcome the early violets on graves we know, as we 
welcome them nowhere else. 
If with ali these requirements can be associated 
picturesque variety of surface, secluded glens and 
pools, where, as in Mount Auburn, water flowers 
show their white regalia, it would be well; but there 
should be no sacrifice of the quiet seclusion which 
should belong to such a spot to compass the garish 
charms of over-nice and pretentious gardening. 
Park gardening and decoration is one thing ; that 
of cemeteries is quite another. Aims, treatment, 
effects, all should be different. Sombre masses of 
wood, heavy shadows, these should be present ; above 
all things, there should be avoidance of those sudden 
surprises and graceful deceits by which gardeners 
sometimes win their lesser honors. Great. simplicity 
of design is also essential, not only as in keeping 
with the sepulchral offices of such ground, but being, 
to a certain extent, proof against the harm which an 
elaborate plan must suffer by injudicious -planting in 
private inclosures.
-P-A-G-E-217
  LAYING OUT OF GROUNDS. 203 
From the fact last named—the giving over of 
individual lots to private caprices of planting or 
arrangement, no consummate or finished gardening 
can, of course, ever be looked for in our cemeteries. 
The general effect will be at best spotty, and lack 
coherence. The trail of the principal drives or walks, 
the establishment of the capital masses of foliage, the 
ordering and adaptation of the encircling belt, the 
finish and appointments of the entrance-way—these 
are the objects which will demand taste and skill for 
their happy execution. To twirl a great labyrinth 
of serpentine paths through a forest, shaver clean of 
its under-brush—to throw rustic bridges over a flow 
of sluggish ditch-water, and to construct grottoes 
where they sit like mountebanks in the hollows of 
the hills, is not good gardening for cemeteries—if it 
be good anywhere. If there be great reach of irreg- 
ular surface, there should be sunny glades to contrast 
with masses of solemn shade. Rustic or other little- 
nesses should not pique and arrest attention. The 
story of the place should be told in the largest letters 
of the gardener’s vocabulary and the interpretation 
easy—quiet—seclusion—REST. 
Something might be said of the character of the 
trees which should be planted in these fields of the 
dead. The willow is the traditional weeper, and in 
place; but such product of the gardener’s art as a 
 
-P-A-G-E-218
204 RURAL STUDIES. 
weeping ash is a terribly starched mourner, and 
should be banished as an impertinence. All curious 
and rare exotics, I should say, have no place there; 
unless, like the yew or the European cypress, they 
bear some story of association which chimes evenly 
with the solemn shadows around. The darker ever- 
greens generally, are most fitting; and there is a 
yariety of the Norway spruce, with long, pendulous 
arms, that is one of the stateliest and comeliest and 
friendliest of mourners it is possible to imagine. If 
the Mediterranean cypress would but withstand the 
rigor of our season, its dark plumes, leading up on 
either side to the gateway of a tomb, would make a 
standing funereal hymn. 
Near to Savannah, in Georgia, and upon one of 
the creeks making into the irregular shores there- 
‘about, is a cemetery called, if I remember rightly, 
Buena Ventura. In old times, any visitor at the Pulaski 
used to find his way there, and was richly repaid for 
the visit. There was no proper “keeping” to the 
grounds. You passed in under a lumbering old gate- 
way of unhewn timber ; the paths were not carefully 
tended ; there was much of rampant and almost in- 
decorous undergrowth; the tombs were mossy, and 
the graves, many of them, sunken; but great live- 
oaks over-reached your path, and from their gnarled 
limbs hung swaying pennants of that weird gray
-P-A-G-E-219
  LAYING OUT OF GROUNDS. 205 
moss of the Southern swamp lands—festooned, tan- 
gled, streaming down—now fluttering in a light 
breeze, and again drooping, as if with the weight of 
woe, to the very earth. There was something mys- 
teriously solemn and grave-like in it. The gnarled 
oaks and the slowly swaying plumes of gray told the 
completest possible story of the place. Had ‘there 
been no tombs there, you would have said that it was 
the place of places where tombs should lie and the 
dead sleep. I have alluded to the scene only to show 
what and how much may be done by foliage and tree 
limbs, with their investing mosses, to give character 
to such a spot. 
Neither the live oak nor the Spanish moss is avail- 
able, indeed, in our Northern latitudes ; but there are 
various degrees of fitness in the trees at command. 
The yew and the compact-headed Austrian pine, and 
the balsam fir are always in their sables; even the 
much-degraded Lombardy poplar, in full vigor, car- 
ries a ceremonious, self-possessed stiffness not unbefit- 
ting; while the glittering leaved beech, and horn- 
beam, on the contrary, with their ceaseless, idle flut- 
ter, are the most unseemly of chatter-boxes. The ash, 
again, without liveliness of color has great dignity of 
carriage, and in its half mourning of autumn purple is 
one of the stateliest and fittest of attendants. 
I know there is a philosophy which denies the
-P-A-G-E-220
206 RURAL STUDIES. 
propriety of seeking for, or multiplying any solemn 
symbols in connection with death, or the places 
where the dead lie; which believes in opening wide 
and laughing landscapes around graves, and in smoth- 
ering all memory of the short-lived, funeral black 
under the gayest of colors. It seems to me, however, 
that so far as such a philosophy puts its meddlesome 
liveliness upon church-yards and tombs, it is only a 
gay hypocrisy. Death is always death; and the 
place where the dead lie, always Golgotha. The real 
grief that goes thither with its bitterness, will be put 
down by no pelting of bright colors, and mock grief 
may be mended by what solemnity belongs to the 
scene. 
We are not to go through the world mourning, it 
is true; but the graveyards, thank God, are only in 
scattered places. And if we can spend liveliness and 
cheer over all the rest of our ways, we can surely 
afford to leave the funereal plumes hanging over the 
one little path where we mourn.

Real Estate Purchase. 
HAT on earth my friend Mr. Urban wants of 
a farm of fifty acres, I do not know; but he 
wants it. At least he says as much; and I am not 
the man to dispute him, I feel assured that when 
he gets it, he will grow red in the face over it, and 
perspire fearfully, and use language forbidden in the 
decalogue, and find his pet Alderneys, season after 
season, very obstinately dropping calves of the wrong 
sex, and his steers breaking into his cabbage patch. 
I am confident that he will feel persuaded, before 
the end of the first year, that all his country neigh- 
bors have conspired to fleece him, and that the butch- 
ers are all cut-throats—in which opinion he will not
-P-A-G-E-224
  210 RURAL STUDIES. 
be far out of the way. Notwithstanding this, which 
I have represented to him in the mildest manner pos- 
sible, (seeing his infatuation,) Mr. Urban still wants 
a fifty-acre farm. Of course, he is no farmer; and his 
idea of a good farmer is of one who raises large vege- 
tables, keeps his fences and buildings in Pimlico 
order, and owns fine stock. It is, I must be allowed 
to say, a somewhat imperfect idea. He has not the 
slightest doubt of his capacity to treat land ju- 
diciously, and make it produce huge crops at a min- 
imum cost. How he expects to accomplish this, I 
do not know ; neither, I think, does he. 
Naturally, he does not mean to buy a farm full 
of rocks; on the contrary, he wishes smooth land— 
rich, of course, with no uncouth assemblages of 
brush—gently undulating withal—giving fine views 
—not hard to till, with serviceable buildings upon 
it—in a healthy region, convenient to schools, rail- 
ways, churches, mills, steamboats, and the world 
generally—with ample society in the neighborhood 
—plenty of the choicest fruit:   
abounding in good 
spring-water—no incumbrances, and at a very low 
price. All this, he thinks, is to be found easily, any 
day in the week, and that a moderate sized check 
will transfer it to his possession. 
There is a little presumption in the thought; 
but, if the advertisements are to be believed, not
-P-A-G-E-225
MR. URBAN AND A COUNTRY HOUSE. 211 
much. City-bred men have indeed rather a pre 
sumptuous way of regarding those who live and 
gain their living by country pursuits. 
Think of it for a moment :—Here (in the country) 
is your quiet landholder, living in the performance 
of a humble range of duties—rearing brown-cheeked 
boys, who will make their way to high places of 
trust—to generalships, to governorships, by dint of 
their sturdy habits of self-denial, and of work, which 
have belonged to their early life; and, on the other 
hand, yonder by the gas-lights is your business man 
of the city, rearing boys under the shadow of the 
Broadway shops, who, by reason of no self-denial 
at all, will hardly arrive at the governing even of 
themselves (to say nothing of States) ; and yet, such 
a person counts it no difficult matter, by the gains 
of only a week’s profitable venture, to oust the coun- 
tryman from his home, and take possession of his 
lands. It is lamentable to think that the accomplish- 
ment of such undertaking is so easy. An instinctive 
clinging to one’s home, isa good nucleus for the 
growth of orderly virtues. Iam not going to enter 
into the question as to whether the better man may 
grow up under trees, or under brick walls; it is a 
large question ; and there is a leafy side to it, which, 
to me, is particularly engaging: but to-day, our con- 
cern is with Mr. Urban and his search and its results.
-P-A-G-E-226
  212 RURAL STUDIES. 
As I have said, the advertisements are most 
promising—so also are the representations of the 
real estate agents, (the most citified of citizens,) who 
are loudest in their praises to a new comer—of some 
property, dull of sale, which has been a long time on 
their books. 
And here, I wish to interpose, by way of paren- 
thesis, a suggestion—our need of a more intelligent 
and trustful real estate agency (so far as relates to 
country homes,) than now exists. It should be in 
the hands of parties who have lived in the country, 
who are familiar with the country, and with coun- 
try resources, and country drawbacks, who by travel 
and experience are competent to advise, and who 
by large intercourse with landholders can put an 
inquirer on the right trail. Still further, it is emi- 
nently desirable that such party be able to furnish 
leading hints for whatever changes may be requisite 
—the system of management that may be safely pur- 
sued, and to forecast the home which is sought for. 
Iam by no means suggesting what is impracticable, 
or impossible. Older countries have long seen the 
advantages of such agency as I describe. A man of 
business in London, who after a series of successes 
conceives the idea of establishing a country home, 
is able to put himself at once in communication with 
certain well-known parties, who (though they may
-P-A-G-E-227
  MR. URBAN AND A COUNTRY HOUSE. 213 
not advertise in the journals,) are understood to be 
in correspondence with such landholders as are will- 
ing to sell, but entertain a horror of seeing their 
homes and lands trampled over day after day by 
whatever curious people may obtain a search ticket 
from the established and ordinary real estate agents. 
A home is a home, even to the humblest; and to 
those whose needs demand a peremptory sale, the 
interposition of some adroit agent who makes the 
visit of a purchaser appear to be only the visit of a 
curious friend, is an immense relief. 
Still more important is it that such negotiator be 
competent to give advice based upon long experience 
and observation. There is many a man, my friend 
Urban among them, who, conceiving a longing for 
the quietude or other indulgences of the country, has 
yet the most dim and vague notions of what he is 
really in search of. Is it simply a quiet reach of 
garden ground which may supply all the enjoyment 
of the lesser fruits? Is it sea air alone—or mountain 
air, simply—without a thought or care of anything 
beyond? Is it shade and trees, and a taste of wild- 
ness? Is it the care of fine cattle and the requisite 
attention and expenditure? Is ita two months’ 
disport with a model-farm in summer, without much 
regard to the returns? Is it the establishment of a 
country home which shall be complete in all its equip-
-P-A-G-E-228
  214 RURAL STUDIES. 
ments ? Not one in ten of those freshly smitten with 
a desire to purchase a country residence can definitely 
say. So much the more need of one who can intelli- 
gently, by a few practical questions, interpret their 
own wishes to the purchasers themselves and fathom 
the full reach of their country longings. 
Cost and Returns of Fifty Acres. 
FARM of fifty acres may be a large thing, or it 
may be a small thing; small, if remote, and 
submitted only to the “hand to mouth” culture of a 
great many of the present holders ; but large, extray- 
agantly, if it be favorably placed, and be wrought to 
the full measure of its capacity by the best appliances 
of agricultural and horticultural art. Yet the appli- 
cant at the city offices can form no idea of this dis- 
tinction, nor will his queries in such a quarter put 
him in the way of arriving at the just grounds of such 
distinction. If, on the other hand, such applicant 
(Mr. Urban, we will say,) were to address himself to 
one of wide experience and observation in such 
matters, he would probably say: “My dear sir, do 
you wish a fifty acre farm, that shall return revenue ? 
Do you wish it as a plaything, for which you will be 
willing to pay as much annually as for your opera-box 
and its attendant expenses? Do you wish to engage
-P-A-G-E-229
MR. URBAN AND A COUNTRY HOUSE. 218 
your sympathies in the affair, and demonstrate some 
improved method of culture at whatever cost? 
Finally, do you wish it as a summer home, enjoyable 
—through all the time of leaves and fruitage—and 
not acancer upon the purse through all the remaining 
months of the year?” 
Well—not one in ten who talks vaguely about 
having a farm—a country place—is prepared to 
answer intelligibly and directly such questions. Can _ 
you—who have sometimes thought of giving your 
children breatiing-room, under trees? Can you— 
who have sometimes thought of glorifying your busi- 
ness successes in Wall Street, by a tasteful home in 
the country? Can you—publisher, jobber, grocer, 
bookseller, tailor—who have some vague notions of 
eventually giving dignity to your gains by establish- 
ing a home under elms—have you any precise idea 
of what you propose? What limit of land—what 
‘what   
range of landscape—what fertility of soil 
addenda of convenience ? 
I don’t think, for a moment, that you have; I 
don’t think that one in a hundred has, who amuses 
himself in dreamy hours with forecasts of a pleasant 
home in the shade of oaks, and in the midst of corn- 
lands, which, in boyish days, he knew—only too well. 
The man who is eager for a town purchase of house 
or lot, has very distinct notions (ordinarily) of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-230
  216 RURAL STUDIES. 
size he covets—the number of rooms requisite—of 
the household service he will possibly require, and 
of the probable range of his annual costs in maintain- 
ing the same. But, with respect to the country, 
whenever his aspirations turn in that direction, he is 
in a maze. He counts it an indulgence, which, like 
city indulgences, has no determined laws of cost; it 
is another opera-box, of which the trees make the 
upholstery, and some Killarney manager presents the 
bills in brogue. Under these conditions of uncer- 
tainty, an intermediate agent, who can interpret in 
some measure a man’s own indefinite wishes, and by 
a few direct, practical questions, reduce his intentions 
to form, is eminently needed—one, moreover, who, 
by his own experience and observation, can suggest 
the costs and capabilities of farm, garden, or country 
seat, and enable the purchaser to take a complete 
trade view of his proposed enterprise. 
To return to Mr. Urban—his negotiations must 
be largely through the established real-estate offices, 
or by personal reply to the newspaper advertise- 
ments. These leave him in a dreary muddle. Those 
who have had experience, know why, and how. The 
established agencies take no account of an applicant’s 
tastes, or positive wants, (if he were able intelligibly 
to express them,) and are only anxious to make sale ; 
the advertisements are naturally exaggerated to a
-P-A-G-E-231

degree that makes the consequent search a ludicrous 
bore. One “charming place” is next to a great 
reach of marsh land, where every informant is pale 
and quaking with the ague; another is so beset with 
rocks that it would require double the cost of pur- 
chase to clear a smooth bit of greensward at the 
door. 
Such incongruities naturally shock a man of com- 
mercial susceptibilities—if he proposes to carry them 
to the country with him. Mr. Urban does; and, 
fretted by an accumulation of mischances, and of 
misdirections, as well as by not a little conscious 
ignorance of his own, appeals to me for certain prac- 
tical hints in way of guidance—putting his appeal 
indeed in the shape of a rambling talk, which I take 
the liberty of digesting into this formulary of ques- 
tions :— 
Ist. How much ought fifty acres of land, with 
respectable farm-house, and out-buildings, within 
accessible distance—say not over three to four hours 
from the city—to cost ? 
2d. Will the possible or probable revenue from 
such a farm be sufficient to keep it in good order— 
best of order, say—so that it shall not become a bill 
of expense ? 
3d. What crops or treatment will insure such 
return, without destroying altogether the picturesque

  MR. URBAN AND A COUNTRY HOUSE. 219 
When a man’s rambling conversation for two or 
three hours is capable of digest into such interroga- 
tive formule, it is evident that he has some rural 
intentions; and I proceed to reply to such (in behalf 
of my friend Urban) seriously and seriatim. 
The price of land, within the required distance of 
New York, is as variable as the weather. There are 
lands within a radius of a hundred miles of the City 
Hall, equipped with rocks and trees, which would be 
dear at ten dollars the acre, and there are lands 
within the same radius, equipped with rocks and 
trees, and without architectural improvements, which 
would be cheap at two thousand dollars per acre. In 
fact, there is no rule for price of land, as prices rule 
for other commodities. Lands along the Hudson, for 
instance, are valued—for their river views, or, may be, 
the social attractions of their neighborhood—at prices 
upon which the best ordered cropping would not pay 
a rental of one per cent. On the other hand, there 
are level garden grounds on Long Island to be 
bought at prices on which eight, ten, and even fifteen 
per cent. might be made secure by judicious culture. 
Within four miles of Edinboro Castle there are grass- 
lands which rent, per acre, for one hundred and fifty 
dollars. a year. Of course, near to great cities, the 
rental of gardening or grazing-land, is measured by 
the length of lease—if long, it is worth more; if
-P-A-G-E-234
  220 RURAL STUDIES. 
short, it is worth less. In general, I should say that 
any easily-tilled, fairly productive land, within three 
miles of a good market, (by which I mean any city 
of twenty-five to forty thousand inhabitants,) ought, 
upon a ten years’ lease, to pay a rental of at least 
twelve to fifteen dollars per acre. This supposes, 
however, full agricultural or horticultural aptitude on 
the part of the manager—a qualification which rarely 
belongs to city purchasers. If such a purchaser looks 
simply to agricultural rental, as a justification of the 
enterprise, he can hardly afford to pay more than two 
hundred or two hundred and fifty dollars an acre for 
lands adapted to easy tillage. But a largely qualify- 
ing circumstance lies in the fact that all such lands 
near to centres of business, take on annual increase 
of value by reason of the growth of the town. In 
the last ten years such rate of increase in all thriving 
neighborhoods might safely be reckoned at six to 
eight per cent. for each twelvemonth. This is, how- 
ever, only true of those farm-lands which lie so near 
to cities or large towns, as to suggest the outlay of 
new roads across them, or a prospective demand for 
suburban building lots. In view of this, the sagacious 
purchaser of a fifty acre farm will not leave out of 
view—if he desires the surest possible increase of his 
capital—the attractiveness of the land for building 
sites; and if, as we suppose, his purchase be within
-P-A-G-E-235
MR. URBAN AND A COUNTRY HOUSE. 221 
fifteen to twenty: minutes’ drive of a growing city, he 
will project his improvements, whether of planting or 
grading, with an eye to its ultimate adaptation for 
such purpose. 
Will the farm revenue of fifty acres pay for care 
and keeping? Most unquestionably, if there be a 
reasonable amount of smooth tillable land, and aver- 
age fertility, and no woful mismanagement. If, 
however, “care and keeping” are understood to 
imply the introduction of gravelled walks in all 
directions, and trenching for shrubbery, agricultural 
returns will scarcely pay for the weeding and the 
watering. Luxuries are luxuries all the world over, 
and must be paid for out of hand. What I count 
legitimate care and keeping, is such management as 
shall insure a gradually cumulative fertility to the 
cultivated portions, a neat and orderly air to the 
necessary buildings and walks, and a gradual but 
positive development of those features which con- 
tribute most to its attractiveness as a place of resi- 
dence. 
As for the proceeds of a sudden sale growing out 
of disgust with the rural enterprise, I should hope 
that a man—or a woman either—might be duly 
punished for such vacillation of purpose. ’T'would be 
a good ethical result, whatever might be its econom- 
ics to the Urban adventurers. Any such quick-
-P-A-G-E-236
  222 RURAL STUDIES. 
coming disgust arises, I think, in the majority of 
instances, from the lay out of more considerable im- 
provements than can be thoroughly kept in hand or 
matured: and it is needless to say that no new pur- 
chaser will ever pay a large price for gravel walks 
overgrown with turf, or gullied by the rains, or for 
shrubbery that leads a starveling life in a great en- 
compassing circle of foul growth. An inferior plan 
completed is always more salable than a grandiose 
scheme but half carried out. Again, ornamental 
country architecture never brings its cost, save under 
very exceptional conditions; therefore the proprietor 
who forecasts a possible early sale, should be very coy 
of placing much capital in flamboyant joinery or 
expensive walks. 
On the other hand, whatever expenditure con- 
tributes to the real productive capacity of the land, 
whether in the way of drainage, or permanent 
fertilizers, or judicious farm buildings proper, will 
prompt buyers, and in nine cases in ten, return 
its full cost. The man who spends five thousand 
dollars in bringing up the revenue of a fifty-acre farm 
from four hundred to a thousand dollars a year, is 
working upon a safe basis; but the man who expends 
an equal sum in finical equipments of house and 
garden, and in the shaping of a great mass of walks 
and the planting of exotics—while the land remains

MR. URBAN AND A COUNTRY HOUSE. 293 
at its old fixed point of productiveness—may find 
buyers who will refund the cost of his whims; but 
the chances are by no means in his favor. 
Another large source of disgust with rural under- 
takings lies in the difficulty of finding efficient and 
honest directing labor. We have in this country no 
class of farm bailiffs who, by education and tradition, 
know their duties, and quietly perform them. We 
have indeed shipments, from year to year, of stray 
specimens of this old country class; but the demo- 
cratic instinct speedily overtakes them—of becoming 
directors in chief. As good democrats—which of 
course all Americans are—we ought not to regret 
this, but it comes awkwardly in the way of a great 
many city visions of rural felicitude. Mike, who has 
toiled far into the twilight, under the shadows of the 
hills of Wicklow, comes deftly and easily into a ten- 
hour system, by virtue of which, on some June day 
your out-spread hay lies smoking under the evening 
dew; and Bridget, the stout lass, red-armed, and 
crimson-cheeked, commended for all work, who has 
milked the spotted kine in the folds that border 
Killarney, ‘‘ many a time, and oft,” is quick to com- 
prehend the American deference for the sex, and 
explodes upon you with “Shure! and it’s niver a 
woman’s work ! ” 
But, short-comings of subordinates could be borne,
-P-A-G-E-238
224 RURAL STUDIES. 
if we might be sure of the intelligent and faithful 
direction of superiors. In fault of this from outside 
sources, Mr. Urban, if he insists upon his fifty-acre 
experiment, must undertake it himself. And, in that 
event—as I hinted at the beginning—I expect to see 
him grow fearfully red in the face, and struggle 
against his wife’s repinings, and yet, through all—if 
the rural love be strong in him—work out results 
that will be charming in spite of their toils. 
As for the pears and the Chittagongs, about 
which, if I remember rightly, my friend Urban insti- 
tuted some inquiries, I have nothing in particular to 
say. Bad fruit is due more to lack of good culture, 
than to choice of bad varieties; let a man select the 
best specimens he can find in the city-markets—test- 
ing them by taste—secure the trees from a nursery- 
man who has a reputation to lose, then cultivate with 
care, and he will never lack good fruit. 
There is as much dilettanteism in pomology as in 
old pottery, or in poetry ; a sound man who wearies 
of the dilettanti chooses what he likes, and gives it 
protection and reaps his reward. I would as soon 
think of choosing my fruits by the advices of the 
horticultural disputants, as of choosing my pictures 
(if I ever bought them) by the advices of the news- 
paper critics. The pomologists stand related to those 
who raise fruit for home enjoyment, and under fair

garden culture, as the lexicographers and philologists 
are related to those who use language to enwrap a 
sermon or a plea; a finical nicety, if it engross them, 
will be at the cost of vigor and directness of thought. 
So of the improved races of poultry. The hen- 
fanciers are, I dare say, very worthy people; far be 
it from me to pluck a feather from the tail of any of 
their brood. But to my obscure sense, an egg is 
always very much of an egg, whatever fowl may have 
the laying of it. Nor can I detect much difference 
between a “ broiler ” of the Chittagong, or any other 
heathen family, and the “ broiler” Bridget may dress, 
and lay before me at a June breakfast, from the 
cackling company that have always laid and scratched 
about the dung-hills of our Christian country. Nay, 
I take a rather pleasant entertainment in fancying my 
cheerful and cackling barn-door brood are lineally 
descended from those veterans of the British roost, 
who, under the name of Chanticleer, have for so 
many centuries lifted up their welcome to the morn- 
ing. There are family associations which are a source 
of pride ; what if my gallant fellow in white, yonder, 
with golden legs, and blood-red comb, curveting with 
wings down-spread, and giving a coquettish look to 
the demure feathered people of his harem, comes in 
direct lineage from the alert old Chanticleer of the 
House that Jack Built ?

This is the cock that crowed in the morn,

That married the man all tattered and torn, etc. 
Can we say as much, or fancy as much for an 
awkward, frizzled creature of Shanghae name, as 
stupid as the celestials with their hair tied into a 
cue ? 
And yet those city gentlemen who have come 
newly into possession of fifty acres, or ten acres of 
farm land, are prone to distress themselves with the 
notion that they have not precisely the right breed 
of cattle, or hens, or geese. Their griefs (allow me 
to say)—for they will have them—vwill not rest upon 
so inconsiderable a base as a wrong choice of animals ; 
any of God’s creatures will be good enough, if they 
give them requisite care. 
Question of Localities, 
PERCEIVE even now that I have not replied 
to every query of my friend Urban. “ What do 
I think of New Jersey as a residence ?” 
I know a great many excellent people in New 
Jersey—entirely unconnected with its railway system. 
I have reason to believe that there are villages in the 
retired parts of the State where the houses and door-
-P-A-G-E-241
MR. URBAN AND A COUNTRY HOUSE. 227 
yards are neat, and where the streets are not filled 
with offal and mangy dogs. Fifty acres of land in 
New Jersey—soil being equal—will bear as good corn 
or rye as in any other spot of our common country 
where the sun shines with equal force. I do not 
indeed think that “Vineland” is soon to become 
our Eden, or that, if we ever have an Eden, it will 
lie in New Jersey. If a Euphrates were ever to 
spring up in the Highlands, I doubt much if it 
could ever cross the Central or the Camden and 
Amboy track—without good lobby management. 
All this, however, is said jokingly. 
There are good farms in New Jersey; there is 
most excellent garden-ground, and—best of all—one 
can come from it easily to New York. There is no 
reason why its near lands should not become the 
paradise of fruiterers, and of vegetable-growers for 
the market. Its general surface—short of the moun- 
tains, or of the beautiful rolling lands of Monmouth— 
does not invite those who look for the picturesque as 
well as the practical. 
But what boots it, talking of this or that locality ? 
If a man has really made up his mind to be shaven, it 
matters little on which half of his chin the operator 
shall commence. If Mr. Urban, or any other good 
friend, is determined to possess himself of fifty acres, 
he will undoubtedly have associations which will
-P-A-G-E-242
228 RURAL STUDIES. 
draw him in this or that direction, against all reason- 
ing upon the mere merit of the land. 
Agriculturally speaking, it does not much matter 
where the amateur farmer may go. I do not say this 
ironically, but in full soberness. If a man, used to 
city life and its lusts, has made up his mind to redeem 
himself, so far as he may, by grappling with fifty of 
God’s acres, and by putting the stamp of his energy 
and toil upon them, he cannot go wrong, wherever, 
within reasonable distance, the hills and the meadows 
are spread out. Earnest work will declare itself 
effectively, on the harsh rocky banks of the Hudson, 
or upon the unctuous level of Jersey. This much, 
however, is to be said practically—the nearer a man 
can establish himself to one of those great avenues 
of travel—that is, toward Philadelphia, Boston, or 
Albany—the more sure he will be of finding sale in 
the event of failure, and the more sure of ready and 
constant market for whatever produce he may have 
on hand. 
I am perfectly well aware that my friend Mr. 
Urban (and others of like humor) will insist that he 
has no intention of selling out or of marketing ex- 
tensively. It is pleasant, however, to feel that we can 
do such things if we choose. From my own observa- 
tion I am persuaded that the man who has no chance 
of selling his country place or his farm is always a
-P-A-G-E-243
  MR. URBAN AND A COUNTRY HOUSE. 229 
great deal more eager to sell than the one who has 
opportunities flowing upon him weekly.. Above all 
things, it is imperative that a proprietor who would 
enjoy to the full a delightful country place, or a well- 
managed farm, should allow others to enjoy it with 
him. By which I mean, that his improvements and 
successes should be in the sight of people, and not in 
some utterly inaccessible locality, out of view and 
out of mind. 
To plant charming shrubberies and lay down cap- 
tivating walks in quarters that no one can reach but 
by a break-neck scramble over abominable roads, is 
like making a fine speech to empty benches—always 
an ungrateful thing to do, as many a good man 
knows. Half the charm of the river-bank places 
along the Hudson lies in the fact that they, with their 
surroundings, really form a part of that great water 
highway of travel—gazed upon every summer day 
by the world that floats downward and upward 
through the mountain gates of the river, dotting the 
green hills with lessons which every floating traveller 
may read—massing their showy rhododendrons so 
that thousands from below and above may see the 
pink crown of blossoms. The boat, the car, those 
hundred eyes, do not steal away any home-like pri- 
vacy ; they equip it rather with a new content—the 
content that comes of seeing others enjoy what we
-P-A-G-E-244
230 RURAL STUDIES. 
enjoy and take a pride in ourselves. Never a man 
yet, no matter how crotchety or unassailable, who 
possessed farm or garden, into whose management 
his pride and care had largely entered, but enjoyed 
seeing it admired. The eye of the world upon a 
man’s work is healthfully stimulative. He who 
denies it, and plants for his solitary gratification only, 
has a weak spot in his head or heart, and deserves to 
go crazed in an island-garden. There are charming 
places, so far as banks and trees and water view go, 
along the far away shores of Long Island, but it is a 
long day’s journey to reach them over a road where 
nobody travels. There are very grateful, inaccessible 
nooks in Rockland County, where 
“A hermit hoar, in solemn cell,” 
might wear out life’s “evening gray,” 2 ig gray, very jollily ; 
but no man who wants his flowers to catch a new 
tint from the reflected grace of fair faces, wishes to 
bury himself there. There are magnificent grazing 
farms in the wilds of Greene County, great waves of 
rolling hills, great Tors of shaggy, shaded cliff, great 
wealth of brooks, purling amid the undulations of the 
meadows, great rampant crests of forest growth, with 
_ century-old hemlocks piling out of them their won- 
drous pagodas of green; but who wants the torture 
of a drive over the Catskills to enjoy it all? 
Mr. Urban does not, neither do I.

Testimony of Experts. 
T the risk of iteration, and in the hope of throw- 
-\ ing all possible light upon the subject under 
notice, I propose the examination of a few fifty-acre 
farmers, who shall represent respectively the stock- 
breeder, the amateur, the business man, the philoso- 
pher, the practical man and the trader. 
Mr. Urban being in company—in whose interest 
the inquiries are made—we first encounter Mr. Up- 
den, of Deep-Dale, well known among Committee 
men, and eminent at Agricultural Fairs. 
His system is simply—to breed cattle of pure 
blood. We venture the query—if Mr. Upden’s stock 
is fed mostly from the land, or if he is in the habit 
of buying food? 
Witness. “I buy, I should say, from twenty to 
forty tons a year.” 
Mr. Urban innocently asks if Mr. Upden makes 
sufficient butter for the consumption of his family ? 
The question is almost resented. 
“ Butter-making is an annoyance. Six or seven 
hundred dollar cows can be put to better uses. I 
prefer to buy my butter.” 
Query. “ We are to suppose then, I think, that 
 
-P-A-G-E-246
232 RURAL STUDIES. 
the milk of your cows goes to the rearing of your 
young animals. Does this prove sufficient ? ” 
Witness. “Tn most instances; we sometimes, 
however, purchase native animals to suckle our 
choice calves.” 
Query. “ With the milk from two cows, I sup- 
pose, you are able to rear a fine calf?” 
Witness. “ That is our intention.” 
Query. “Is it your opinion that a calf so reared 
will be able to sustain itself in good condition with- 
out extra feeding for a series of years ?” 
Witness. “I do not understand the term ‘ extra 
feeding.’ It is our way to give animals whatever 
they will eat at whatever cost.” 
Query. “Is there an active demand for your cattle 
trom practical farmers ? ” 
Witness. “Not so large as we could wish. We 
sell mostly to breeders.” 
Query. “ Are the prices you receive remunera- 
tive?” 
Witness. “We endeavor to make them so; 
though with a large stock on hand we are compelled 
to pass off some animals on private terms.” 
Query. “ Have the results been such as to war- 
rant you in recommending to a friend a similar 
course of agricultural operations ? ” 
Witness. “If the friend had large capital, and an
-P-A-G-E-247
  MR. URBAN AND A COUNTRY HOUSE. 233 
assured income, independent of his land, and had a 
taste for fine cattle I think I could do so.” 
All which is eminently discreet: but if to a taste 
for fine cattle, any rurally inclined gentleman adds a 
thorough knowledge of them, and aptitude in the 
handling of them, and a keen eye for the apprehension 
of their good or bad points, (such as few men are 
born to,) he may become a successful breeder. But 
to undertake such a business with only the flimsy 
basis of a love for fine cattle, will prove a very profit- 
less venture. 
The next witness is a stout man, partially bald, 
who carries a bandana pocket-handkerchief and per- 
spires freely—John Heaviside, of Three-Hills Farm : 
retired from business going on five years. 
Query. “ Would Mr. Heaviside be good enough 
to detail in brief his system with respect to stock and 
labor ?” 
Witness. “ Well upon my word, there’s not much 
of asystem. I keep a pair of carriage-horses, and a 
little roadster for the boys, and a pair of mules, and 
a pony and a saddle-horse, and we sometimes hire a 
neighbor’s oxen. Then there’s a cow or two and 
their calves; and there’s a foreman, and gardener, ard 
coachman, and five out-door hands in the summer.” 
Query. “What are your crops principally, Mr. 
Heaviside ? ”
-P-A-G-E-248
234 RORAL STUDIES. 
Mr. Heaviside dabs the top of his head reflec- 
tively, and replies: “ Grass and vegetables, I should 
say, mostly ; and fruit—we’ve plenty of fruit.” 
Query. “Do the sales meet the expenses of the 
place ?” 
The witness gives over for a moment his exercise 
with the bandana and stares blankly at the questioner. 
Query. “ You sometimes make sales ? ” 
Witness. “Oh! yes—four hundred quarts of 
blackberries, for instance, the last season. Upon my 
word and honor it’s true.” 
Query. “ Anything further ?” 
Witness. “ Not that I know of. Mrs. Heaviside 
could tell better. She claims the sales for pin- 
money.” 
Query. “ What would you reckon the probable 
cost of maintaining a farm of fifty acres ? ” 
Witness. “I should put it at four thousand a 
year—taking one year with another.” 
Query. “Have you much shrubbery, and have 
you laid down gravel walks ? ” 
Witness. (Dabbing cheeks and head with his 
bandana.) “ Ouf! miles!” 
Mr. Heaviside, upon being interrogated on that 
point, testifies that there is no lack of vegetables ; 
indeed, he is of opinion that enough are grown for 
ten families; why so many he is unable to say; he 
 
-P-A-G-E-249
  
  MR. URBAN AND A COUNTRY HOUSE. 235 
believes the garden was laid out with a view to such 
an amount, and of course, it is necessary to keep the 
garden planted. 
On being asked if he could suggest any more 
economic method of management than that at present 
pursued he seems at first at a loss; but being pressed 
for an answer “ would allow forty acres of the land 
to grow up to wood, and drop the gravel-walks.” 
In the event of putting his farm on the market, 
could the witness hope to secure the original price 
with the sum for improvements added ? 
The witness has his doubts. 
“Could he realize the original sum, with half the 
cost of improvements added ? ” 
(His farm is within a half-mile of a very lovely 
and stagnant little town of Berkshire County.) Mr. 
Heaviside loses his temper and retires, being joined 
by a young lady in large hoops, who cheers him 
with the sight of a lovely new carnation, and a 
charming little assemblage of the new Mathiola 
Bicornis. 
The next informant is Mr. Limbold, a lithe, wiry 
gentleman of great self-possession, and a refreshing 
breeziness of manner. 
He has purchased a farm of fifty acres within 
three hours of New York; he spends three months 
there in mid-summer ; his wife prefers Newport, but 
 
-P-A-G-E-250
236 RURAL STUDIES. 
yields to him in consideration of a fortnight at the 
close of the season at the Ocean House. He has not 
built—not he; he has added a wing sufficient for his 
summer accommodation. He has not employed a 
Scotch gardener—not he. The old owner, a practical 
farmer, remains in charge under agreement to share 
sales, the owner furnishing half stock and equip- 
ments. He transports his household the twentieth of 
June; and by contract, shares the farmer’s larder, 
adding such private delicacies as he chooses. He 
secures all his winter butter and poultry, and makes 
sales of the excess, on partnership account, to well- 
known dealers. The farm is not a moth to him—by 
no means. Returns fully balance the interest ac- 
count; and the farm, lying within three miles of 
a thriving city, is rapidly appreciating in value. 
In view of this fact, he expends five hundred a 
year in such improvements as will make the land 
more desirable for suburban sites, and in five years 
hence is confident of quadrupling his money. 
Mr. Urban, who has wavered under the Heaviside 
story, is as cheerfully intent upon his farm as ever. 
The next witness is a philosopher and reformer. 
He believes in drainage—deep drainage—in sub-soil- 
ing, in phosphates, in science, in anything almost 
which is told him seriously. The consequence is, he 
ras bought a farm that no one else would buy, and
-P-A-G-E-251
MR, URBAN AND A COUNTRY HOUSE. 9237 
has put contrabands and refugees of various sorts 
at work upon it, until he has expended more money 
to the acre than was ever expended for agricultural 
purposes in Orange County before. 
Mr. Creed is asked at what depth he is accustomed 
to plant his drains ? 
Witness. “ Four to five feet; six feet I think is 
better.” 
Query. “ And if you come upon rocks ?” 
Witness. “TI blast them out.” 
Query. “ And you find a profit in this?” 
Witness. “It’s thorough.” 
Mr. Creed has possibly misapprehended the ques- 
tion. 
Witness. (Sharply.) “Not at all, I can’t tell 
about profits ; we hear too much of profits; thorough- 
ness is better. Farmers ought to do things thorough- 
ly. I try to show them how.” 
“May we ask,” resumes Mr. Urban, “what are 
your principal crops, Mr. Creed—those.on which you 
place your main reliance ?” 
Witness. “I am trying at present some experi- 
ments with vetches, and a new pumpkin, recom- 
mended very strongly by Dr. Newton, of the Agri- 
cultural Department. I am also making trial of a 
few new grapes. I have still some faith in the Dios- 
corea Batata.”
-P-A-G-E-252
238 AURAL STUDIES. 
Query. “ Would Mr. Creed recommend to an 
enterprising young man, or toa middle-aged man, 
anxious to secure a home, the purchase of a fifty-acre 
farm, and thorough drainage of the same ?” 
Witness. “I would recommend to an honest young 
man to keep as clear as possible of the cities ; country 
gains are honest if they are small; city gains are 
devilish.” 
Query. “ Are we to understand, Mr. Creed, that 
the means which you have lavished upon your farm 
operations are derived from the land ?” 
Witness. “I shall be happy, gentlemen, to further 
your agricultural investigations ; if you confine your 
inquiries to that class of subjects, I shall be glad to 
make reply.” 
Query. “Ts it your opinion, Mr. Creed, that a man 
of energy and industry, who should purchase a farm 
in a retired district, and carry out your system of 
thorough drainage and blasting, would lay the base 
of permanent pecuniary success ? ” 
Witness. “I care very little about pecuniary suc- 
cess. We hear altogether too much of it. I think a 
young man of industry and good habits might secure 
a competence by hard work anywhere in the coun- 
try; and with a competency any man ought to be 
content. Iam inclined to think that I should recom-

Mr. Creed, it appears further, is ihe owner of 
quite a number of pure-bred animals; but his fences 
falling into a bad condition in the course of his 
improvements and experiments, (some of these being 
in the shape of patent hurdles,) and his neighbor’s 
«male animals being intrusive and aggressive, he is 
not quite sure of his calves. His sales, therefore, 
have been subject to the discount of the uncertainty, 
and have brought only fair butcher’s prices. It is 
hinted that the adjoining farmers laugh at Mr. 
Creed’s operations. But in what age have the rustics 
failed to laugh at a philosopher ? 
We next encounter—in the person of Mr. Sloman 
—an eminently respectable man, of the upper part of 
Westchester County, who has managed his farm of 
fifty acres for the past thirty years. 
Query. “Do you find a profit in farming Mr. Slo- 
man ?” 
Witness. “‘ Wail, that’s as folks count profit. 
These ’ere chaps that go into heavy wallin’ and 
drainin’ may be don’t count profit as we count it. 
If I-keep my family along, and buildins in repair, 
and put up five or six hundred dollars, I call it a 
pooty clean thing.” 
Query. “ Would you tell us, Mr. Sloman, some- 
thing of your method ? ” 
Witness. “* Wail, there an’t much method to

speak of. We keep ten or twelve cows through the 
summer, accordin’ to the season; if hay is lookin’ up, 
“long in the fall, we fat an old cow or two, and may 
be a pair of cattle. We mean to keep our mowin’ 
up and put eight or ten acres—’cordin’ to the season 
—in corn and potatoes.” 
Query. “Potatoes are a pretty good crop, are 
they not, Mr. Sloman ?” 
Witness. “ There an’t no better crop, if a man is 
nigh enough to market to send in a hundred bushels 
a day without worryin’ his team.” 
Mr. Sloman being asked his opinion in regard to 
the improved systems of husbandry, replies : 
“ Wail, ’ve pooty much made up my mind that 
books is books, and farmin’ is farmin’. I’ve nothin’ 
to say agin these gentlemen that like to spend money 
a ditchin’ ; I’ve nothin’ to say agin a good tidy crittur, 
and you may call her Durham, or you may call her 
what you like. If she fills a pail she comes up to my 
idee of a good critter; if she doan’t—she doan’t. 
That’s my opinion. May be I’m wrong ; but that’s my 
way 0’ lookin’ at it.” 
An effort is made to bring back the inquiry to a 
rnore definite issue by asking Mr. Sloman “ what he 
thinks about the labor question ? ” 
Witness. “ Wail, good help is ruther skerce.” 
Your intensely practical man under qnestion—

anused to formal investigation—is apt to bring 
forward the awkward facts that confront him every 
day, without measuring their relations. It appears 
in the end that Mr. Sloman pays out some four to 
five hundred dollars a year for labor—in addition to 
his own and that of his boy of fifteen. Reckoning 
this at five to six hundred more, it would appear that 
the needed labor upon a farm of fifty acres under 
ordinary cultivation would be not far from a thou- 
sand dollars. Meeting this, and the taxes, and “ put- 
ting by ” some four or five hundred from his returns, 
the country proprietor thinks he is doing a very fair 
thing. When a man of this stamp is confronted with 
such statements as appear from saifguine Western 
vineyardists, about a return of six thousand dollars 
per acre for land in vines, “prepared with the 
plow at a cost of twenty-five dollars the acre,” he 
simply puts a fresh quid in his cheek, and indulges in 
remarks not creditable to the veracity of the vine- 
yardist. 
I am inclined to think that the real truth lies mid- 
way between the parties. Mr. Sloman, with his old- 
fashioned habits, is not accomplishing the half that 
ought to be accomplished with his fifty-acre farm ; 
the not unfrequent extraordinary representations of 
vineyard product, on the other hand, I cannot but 
regard as palpable exaggerations, I have not the 
i

slightest notion that a vineyard in Missouri—how- 
ever exquisite the vintage—will return the treble per 
acre of the Lafitte estate of Medoc. There have 
been exceptionable periods—as in the days of the 
morus multicaulis fever—when an acre under ordi- 
nary cultivation would yield its three or four thou- 
sand dollars of profit; but whoever makes such excep- 
tional returns, whether due to wine or mulberry 
delirium, the basis of certain and continued horticul- 
tural successes, is either blinded by his enthusiasm, 
or wantonly misleads. 
I record one other fifty-acre experience. Mr. 
Stimpson, an active, red-bearded, prompt man, is 
understood to have purchased some eight years since, 
a farm of some forty to fifty acres, within a couple 
of miles of the thriving city of , for the sum of   
twenty thousand dollars. Does he recommend a simi- 
lar purchase to such inquirers as Mr. Urban ? 
Witness. “If Mr. Urban can make as good a pur- 
chase—unhesitatingly.” 
Mr. Stimpson has found his farming profitable 
then ? 
The witness begs to correct a possible misappre- 
hension; his farming was not profitable. He had 
undertaken the raising of vegetables; but he could 
never find a grocer or vegetable dealer who would 
pay him half price for them ; he undertook the small

  MR. URBAN AND A COUNTRY HOUSE. 243 
fruits, but between the destruction of baskets, small 
prices, or the payment of vagabond berry-pickers 
from the town, (who trampled down more in value 
than they gathered,) he abandoned that scheme; he 
thinks he never bought a cow, but he paid one third 
more than she was worth, to the shrewd neighbors 
who hemmed him in; if labor was twenty dollars a 
month, he could never get it under twenty-five ; his 
breeding sows inevitably devoured the half of their 
litters, though his watchfulness was constant—(per- 
haps too constant.) As for horses, he never bargains 
for one now, but he insists that he should have a 
spavin or two and the heaves, and by strict insistance 
on this, he has the satisfaction of knowing some of 
the defects in advance—a satisfaction he never had 
until he adopted the rule; he had undertaken the sale 
of milk in a weak moment of resolve, but he found 
he was selling large quarts, whereas his rivals in the 
traffic were all selling small quarts—he was selling 
pure milk, and the neighbors were cooling down their 
overheated cans with an infusion of cool spring water. 
In short, Mr. Stimpson declares that between dis- 
contented and overpaid laborers he could not realize 
four per cent. upon his purchase, with his own super- 
vision and anxieties, (which were immense,) thrown 
into the bargain. 
“ And yet you would purchase ? ” 
 
-P-A-G-E-258
244 RURAL STUDIES. 
‘This is the explanation,” says the witness; “the 
increase of population and manufactures, has brought 
the skirts of the town upon me. I have opened a 
new street or two; I have already sold three very 
charming sites at prices which cover all my original 
payment, and I have some half-dozen in hand, after 
the sale of which I shall still have my homestead 
with some four or five acres, which I can afford to 
devote to horticultural pursuits ; or if my wife insists 
—and when she does insist she insists pretty strongly 
—I can retire to town with my investment trebled.” 
Results of Inquiry. 
HAVE thus brought to view through the vehicle 
of an imaginary examination—and in the interest 
of my friend Mr. Urban, and similar inquirers—all 
the aspects of a fifty-acre farm purchased at the East, 
with which I am familiar. The inquiry as herein set 
forth, may possibly help him to an intelligible decision. 
There may be learned from it, I think—First : 
that with unlimited means, and the simple wish to 
lavish them in country employments, it matters very 
little where a man may establish himself, or what 
special whim he adopts—whether for fine cattle, or 
horticultural successes ; but he may be assured that
-P-A-G-E-259
  MR. URBAN AND A COUNTRY HOUSE. 245 
he will win no confirmed triumph in either one or the 
other, without having a personal love for the business 
and a knowledge of it, or without employing, invari- 
ably, those who do have such love or knowledge. 
Second: it may be fairly inferred that a fifty-acre 
purchase is not necessarily a bad affuir, even if the 
purchaser is not personally competent to direct opera- 
tions, provided he has the shrewdness to avail him- 
self of the experience and good common-sense of 
those who have the competency. ‘ 
Third: it may be learned that all the theories 
about drainage, and particularly breeds, and the 
blasting away of rocky fastnesses, and the use of con- 
centrated manures will avail nothing, except they be 
under the direction, and subject to the execution of a 
thoroughly practical man, who has an eye to sale as 
well as purchase, and to crop as well as tillage. 
Philosophers, at best, make doubtful farmers: but 
adventurous philosophers whose brains bristle with 
theories, and who are without that breadth of knowl- 
edge which enables a man to compare theory with 
theory and understand remote as well as immediate 
relations, make the worst farmers it is possible to 
imagine. I have a high regard for our agricultural 
newspapers, and think they are doing far more good 
than our agricultural colleges (as developed thus far) ; 
but there are weaklings, who, finding support from a 
 
-P-A-G-E-260
246 : RURAL STUDIES. 
newspaper correspondent for some ill-digested theory 
of their own, leap to monstrous conclusions. 
Fourth: the inquiries will show that a shrewd, 
old-fashioned farmer—no matter where his land may 
lie—may make fifty acres yield fair return, and not 
involve inordinate expenditure. True, very possibly, 
that such as my friend Mr. Urban do not wish to live 
as Mr. Sloman lived, or to labor as he labored ; but his 
report (which may be well substantiated) is a fair 
indication of the possibilities of fifty-acre farming. 
Fifth: it is clearly enough demonstrated that 
however inapt a man may be at farming or horticul- 
tural pursuits, if he have the business forecast to 
make purchase of land near to a growing centre of 
population, his pecuniary success is made sure, There 
is indeed a sort of commercial genius—of low rank it 
may be—which consists in simply holding on to land 
when the tide of population surges around it, and the 
“ offers” beat like waves upon it, and spend a great 
spray of promise over it. 
In view of all these “ findings” Mr. Urban can- 
not surely be at a loss to regulate his determination. 
If his means are large, (as largeness is counted now- 
adays,) and he has a love for fine cattle of best blood, 
let him—anywhere he will,—import the best animals, 
look to their rearing, and he may establish a herd 
that will carry away the premiums and give him
-P-A-G-E-261
MR. URBAN AND A COUNTRY HOUSE. 247 
reputation, if they give him no profit. Great repu- 
tation may go without great profit, though great 
profit hardly ever goes, in our time, without great 
reputation. 
If he have a fancy for architectural and other 
decorations, it may safely be said that fifty acres will 
furnish ample margin for the most riotous expendi- 
ture. It is quite amazing indeed—as much to the 
proprietor as outsiders—to witness the voracity with 
which a small place even—under elegant and mis- 
guided direction—will consume moneys. The en- 
grossing tastes of the city are not without a capa- 
bility in this direction; but one or two good sand- 
banks, a small ledge, a plantation, and artificial ponds 
—in connection with a rural taste which is ambitious 
without being experienced, will I think absorb money 
as easily as any outlets of the metropolis. 
I should strongly counsel Mr. Urban, or any 
other, who feels this inclination possessing him, 
thoroughly to mature his plans before beginning ; 
there is no rural wasting so monstrous as the waste 
of building walls and removing them, or of excavat- 
ing valleys and the next summer filling them up. A 
few judicious hints at the beginning, based on good 
sense and taste combined, may work the saving of 
thousands. I am inclined to think that the pleasant 
scenes of the Central Park are to be credited (or
-P-A-G-E-262
248 RURAL STUDIES. 
charged) with a great deal of riotous or ineffective 
private expenditure: those who have gleaned all 
their knowledge of landscape-gardening from that out- 
of-door school—a very charming one in many of its 
features—have left out of consideration the fact, that 
public expenditure knows no economies, and an army 
of lazy laborers, dragging at the bosom of the public 
treasury, may keep in presentable shape the walks 
and drives which would be ruin to a private holder. 
The rule of action, as of taste, in public parks, is, to 
produce the best effects at inordinate cost: the whole 
question of economy, whether of establishment or 
future treatment, is eliminated from discussion. With 
private holders, on the other hand, the great ques- 
tion is,—what effects may be produced at a minimum 
of cost for their establishment, and at a minimum 
of cost for their future annual keeping. 
For these reasons, I think the ruralist who medi- 
‘tates a repetition of a bit of the Central Park upon 
his grounds, will sink fearfully in the mire of costs 
and of mud. There are charming features in the 
Park undoubtedly, but the charming things are, most 
of them, underlaid with gold, and will be found to 
require a golden watering for a long time to come. 
Again, if Mr. Urban or any other farm adventurer 
has his chemical or other hobbies which he wishes to 
carry out, let him not count implicitly upon his
-P-A-G-E-263
  MR. URBAN AND A COUNTRY HOUSE. 249 
power to uproot in a season all the practices of cen- 
turies. There is an obstinacy (after all) in God’s soil 
and seed-beds which humiliates the wittiest lecturers 
or the best adepts at the retort. If he be thoroughly 
infected, I only counsel modest expectations—a proper 
humanity toward his working cattle, and the ordinary 
business foresight of keeping a good balance at his 
bank when the bills come in. 
If he has neither short-horn nor landscape ambi- 
tion, and is not infected with any mania of drainage, 
or peat, or Liebig—wishing only the grateful shade 
from trees not subject to the visitations of the curcu- 
lio, and a sweet bowl of milk to his supper, let him 
not be too eager to discard the offices of those old- 
style farmers, who, if not adepts in culture, are 
adepts in saving. 
Finally, if his rural fantasy is only: a short-lived 
whim that may pass one day—if not from his own 
mind, at least from the more sensitive and demon- 
strative mind of his help-meet—let him buy where he 
can sell. He may be sure that the trees will lose 
none of the pleasantness of their leafy rustle if it be 
spent on ears that listen more eagerly than his own. 
His porches, his arbors, his walks, his fields will 
entertain him none the less, if covetous eyes look 
over the fence at them. There may be something 
very wicked, but there is something very human in 
11* e

the cheerfulness with which we watch people break- 
ing the tenth commandment. Horace has touched 
the matter prettily in his satire; but he might have 
added that the merchant is never so contented, as 
when he hears the old soldier, or the officer on half- 
pay exclaim: “ O fortunati mercatores!” And the 
country is never more charming than when we read 
—and reading, believe— 
“ Agricolam laudat juris legumque peritus.” 
When Mr. Urban shall have made the skilful 
lawyer covetous of his fruits, his fields, his walks, he 
may sell—if he chooses. As I said, we never cease 
breaking the tenth commandment and trying to make 
other people break it. And pray, who keeps the 
other nine ? 
Country Houses and Repairs. 
HAT man or woman of us all does not some 
time think of a house that shall one day be a 
home? Who does not ponder the subject—forecast 
its details—outline its surroundings—invest it with 
charms—dally with its image, and give to his imagin- 
ings a most grateful acceptance? For my own 
part, I think I began to build, when as yet I stood in 
daily fear of the fervle of a school-mistress, and 
when, under a knitted Scotch school-cap, there came
-P-A-G-E-265

into my brain a delicious jumble of porches and gables 
and broad roofs dabbled over with the sunlight and 
the shadows. I cannot doubt but that very many 
others have had much the same experience. 
There is a class indeed (not very large, I should 
hope) of both men and women, always afloat, who 
find all their home appetites in those great caravan- 
saries which we call hotels, and whose local attach- 
ments must be of a very vague and illusory char- 
acter: but I cannot fancy such among my readers— 
first, because these have no leisure to listen to what I 
may say; and next, because their sympathies must 
be altogether remote from the topics I discuss. I 
address myself rather to those who have some day 
had thoughts of building houses of their own, and 
who have invested the thought with a thousand 
homely fancies. 
A low, gray, irregular range of buildings with a 
multitude of gables, and here and there a turret lift- 
ing above them—broad windows blazing in the sun- 
light, and windows darkened with trailing festoons 
of some wall-creeper—an ample hall of entrance, with 
quaint stairway climbing to some landing lit with an 
oriel—a blue chamber, a green chamber, an oak 
chamber—rambling corridors opening upon yet other 
chambers—a great dim garret with the sunlight flash- 
ing in through some dormer window upon roof-beams
-P-A-G-E-266
252 RURAL STUDIES. 
hung with dried herbs and gone-by clothing and 
wreck of discarded furniture—porches that invite and 
protect and throw welcome shadows on the door— 
little mantling rooflets of windows that temper the 
glare of day, and at dusk break the dark mass of 
building with picturesque outlying angles: I think I 
have indicated some of tlie features which belong to 
most people’s ideal of a country home. But who 
makes them real? who reaches their ideal in any 
thing—whether in home, in reputation, or success of 
any sort ? 
But as regards the country home, what is in the 
way? We will suppose that our friend Mr. Urban 
has possessed himself at last of the fifty acres he 
sought for; there is wood, there is water, there are 
meadows, and withal there is an old farm-house, the 
home of the out-going owner, with its clumps of 
lilacs, its bunches of syringa, its encompassing mat 
of green sward. Its site is not, may be, precisely the 
one that be would have chosen; but the poor drag- 
gled bit of shrubbery and the mossy cherry-trees that 
“stand near give to it a pleasant homeliness of aspect, 
with which any new site with its raw upturned 
gravels and fresh-planted shrubs must for a long time 
contrast very painfully. Thus the question comes up 
—more appealingly every day he looks on it, Will 
not the old hulk do with a little modernizing? And
-P-A-G-E-267
  MR. URBAN AND A COUNTRY HOUSE. 958 
the thought of putting a new, jaunty look upon the 
old tame outline of building, has something in it that 
- is very captivating. 
This suggests our first topic of discussion—Is it 
wise to undertake the repair of an old country house ? 
The aie or the architect, eager for a fat job, will 
say no: the mistress, with a settled distaste for low 
ceilings and wavy floors that tell fearfully upon the 
carpets, will say no: but a practical man will be 
guided in his decision by the condition of the build- 
ing, and by the range of the proposed changes. Two 
or three axioms in connection with this subject it 
may be worth while to bear in mind. First: it is 
never quite possible to make an altogther new house 
out of an old one. Second: it is the most difficult 
thing in the world to determine in advance the cost 
or limit of the proposed repairs to an old country 
house. Third: it is altogether impossible to say in 
advance that any system of change, however deliber- 
ately considered, will prove ultimately satisfactory to 
the (female) occupants. 
These truisms would seem to count against the 
undertaking to remodel an old house: yet there are 
conditions which make it eminently wise, as well ina 
practical as in an esthetic point of view. 
If, for instance, the walls be of stone or brick, and 
not wholly inconsiderable in extent, it would be bad
-P-A-G-E-268
254 RURAL STUDIES. 
economy as well as bad taste to sacrifice them to any 
craving for newness. In the brick, if well laid, a 
man may be sure of stanchness; and in the stone, 
with the lichens of years upon it, he has a mellowness 
of tone which not all the arts of the decorators can 
reach. But even upon walls of such material, es- 
pecially if they carry the blotches of age, it will 
never do to engraft the grandiose designs of the 
modern builders. If a country liver be really am- 
bitious to match all the pretensions of the latest arch- 
itecture in respect of high ceilings and mansard-roofs, 
let him begin by pulling down; but if his aim be of 
that finer temper which seeks to qualify what is old 
by enlargement of dimensions and by such simple 
decorative features as shall add a piquancy to the 
wrinkles of age—even as the twist of some sober- 
colored ribbbon will set off some be-capped and wid- 
owed face more attractively than all the snow-flake 
haberdashery that could be devised—let him cherish 
all the quaintness that is due to years, and seek only 
to magnify and illustrate it by such enlargements as 
are in keeping with it, and by such sober adornments 
as shall seem to be rather a restoration of old and lost 
graces than the ambitious display of new ones. The 
thing is feasible. It only wants an eye to perceive 
the need, and a courage to discard the flash carpentry 
of the day.
-P-A-G-E-269
MR. URBAN AND A COUNTRY HOUSE. 255 
' I beg that I may be not misunderstood. I by no 
means intend to say that the country houses of fifty 
years ago were in any sense equal or comparable, on 
the score of fitness or of taste, to the country houses 
of to-day; but I do mean to say, that if the walls 
of such old houses are plumb and true and sound, and 
repairs are undertaken, it will be far wiser, and call 
for nicer exercise of skill, to carry forward such 
repairs with the quaint flavor of the old homely tastes 
upon them—thus working out artistic agreement and 
adornment together—than it will be to belittle the 
old by a shocking contrast, and wantonly dress our 
grandame in the furbelows of sixteen. 
Again, let me lay down another distinction. 
There are old houses which, in any traditional or 
artistic sense, are zot old houses. They are mere 
square boxes of lumber or stone, without noticeable 
feature or flavor. Such, if posssible, may be incor- 
porated into any new design, without fear or favor ; 
none but economic considerations will stand in the 
way. But there are others which, without being 
accordant in any sense with the artistic designs of 
the present day, have yet a character of their own— 
a character which any architectural adviser (by the 
qualities of his profession) is bound to detect; and 
which (by the niceties of his profession) he cannot 
ignore in carrying out his changes.
-P-A-G-E-270
256 RURAL STUDIES. 
I know of nothing which an architect can do 
better (in the way of illustrating his real artistic 
capacity) than to take hold of one of those old, almost 
uninhabitable country houses of forty years ago, and, 
without violating its homeliness, graft upon it such 
convenient addenda of rooms, porches, halls (gables, 
possibly) as shall result in a charming homestead, 
in which the old is forgotten in the new, and the 
new made racy by a certain indefinable smack of the 
old. 
For all such renovation, however, as I have hinted 
at, stanch walls and sound timbers are essential pre- 
requisites. If otherwise—if the examining carpenter 
can thrust his scratch-awl eight inches into the sills— 
if the posts have taken gradual settlement and the 
ceiling shows gaping rents, any effective remodelling 
must be of doubtful conomy. Of course there must 
be a substitution of new sills, and a splicing of the 
posts which will make even wider gaps in the ceiling. 
Then comes the pleasant suggestion of the mater 
familias that the mantels are awkward and must be 
replaced by something new and tasteful. The adroit 
mason, being called into consultation, decides that the 
chimneys are hardly worth the change, and that a 
renovation from top to bottom would give a large 
addition of closet room. So the old chimneys come 
down, with such dirt and breakage and necessary
-P-A-G-E-271
MR. URBAN AND A COUNTRY HOUSE. 257 
removal of partition walls as are surprising. The 
ceilings, too, must needs show ugly patches, and it 
would be wiser (the amiable mason suggests) to re- 
plaster altogether. There must be new hearths too, 
and in place of an awkward patched floor perhaps it 
would be better to renew the flooring. This being 
undertaken, it is found that the sleepers are awry, 
and to make square work the carpenter suggests a 
replacement of the flooring timber. This being 
accomplished, it is hinted by the observant mistress 
that the windows are hardly in keeping, and the 
order, is given for new frames and sashes. The 
doors must needs match the windows; and next 
there is a sly regret that the plain ceilings should not 
have their fretting of a town cornice: and so the 
poor old house is gradually dwarfed with a great 
burden of pretentious modernisms that it can carry 
with no grace. Even the mater familias has at last 
her disappointments, and says quietly : “ Sylvanus (it 
is of Mr. Urban that I write), I think ’twould have 
been perhaps better to build a new house.” 
Unquestionably. 
Site and Material. 
UT if new, what is to be said of site, of material, 
of style? Not absolutely upon a hill-top, I 
should say, unless there be some great flanking wood 
 
-P-A-G-E-272
258 RURAL STUDIES. 
against the north, or such planting and arrangement 
of outbuildings as shall presently secure shelter: not 
upon low land either—least of all near to any body 
of fresh water which from artificial causes is subject 
to great inequalities of level, or which in the heats 
of September may show a broad margin of quagmire. 
Lakes are very beautiful, and very healthful too, as 
God made them ; but when the manufacturers or the 
water companies tap them, as they will most persist- 
ently in the seasons of least rain, all their charm and 
glory go sounding down the sluices. 
One would say too that a model country house or 
an enjoyable one should be placed upon such lift of 
ground as to give a good honest out-look over mea- 
dow and wood, and streaks of river (if such can be 
compassed). The near sight of the roofs and towers 
of a city, too, will give a good every-day feeling of 
companionship with the world, without the world’s 
noises ; and I am not sure but that 9 spire or two 
lifting above trees or among trees will breed a 
healthful religious habit in a man—shining always in 
his eye—trim, solid sermons—not smirched with the 
dust of groundling conflicts, and (unlike many written 
sermons) always carrying a good point in them. 
There should be also some glimpse, if nothing more, 
of one of the world’s great highways ; a near railway 
is indeed terrific with its din, but if so far away  
-P-A-G-E-273
  MR. URBAN AND A COUNTRY HOUSE. 259 
that its roar is mellowed by distance, the arrowy 
flight of its trains gives a pleasant bit of movment to 
the landscape. Best of all, for picturesque effect, is 
the feathery trail of white vapor which the rattling 
monster breathes out and which lies floating after 
him like a line of mist over the whole breadth of the 
valley-crossing. Such objects as I have indicated for- 
bid that feeling of solitude which steals upon one 
immured in a scene of absolute retirement. Trees 
are never less than trees indeed, and mountains are 
always writ over with grand lines; but after all, it 
is a weary silence that only birds break or the mono- 
tone of frogs or the locusts. An echo from without, 
whether from a bell-tower or the sweep of a railway 
train, is a sort of brazen world’s voice booming in, 
that by contrast makes the bird’s notes sweeter, and 
the leafy rustle of the trees more beguiling. 
Of the material of which a country house should 
be constructed I shall say some things which are not 
in agreement with prevailing opinions. The use of 
wood is almost universal ; and for producing a certain 
largeness of effect under limitations of cost, it is by 
odds the most economical. The necessary conditions 
too of warmth and dryness may be easily secured by 
a builder in wood; and under these circumstances, 
where fitness and economy seem combined, it is 
hardly reasonable to hope for the substitution of any
-P-A-G-E-274
260 RURAL STUDIES. 
other material than wood. Yet I venture to suggest, 
(and shall urge as I best can,) thatin a country where 
stones abound, and they abound in most of the 
Eastern States, they furnish the most fit material, 
and their use will subserve a higher if not a more 
immediate economy. 
Let me test, one by one, the objections which are 
commonly urged against buildings for home purposes, 
of stone. 
First, on the score of appearance: There are 
those who object to the rough and unbecoming par- 
ticolored surface of a house of stone—who believe 
that a “ handsome house” (a most destestable collo- 
cation of words) must have smooth exteriors, and 
submit to the finical niceties of the painters. This, 
indeed, is a question of taste, in which all ordinary 
reasoning is adrift. It certainly seems to me that 
the real beauty of a country house depends not so 
much upon nice finish of surface as upon outline, and 
the agreement of its general tone of color with the 
surrounding landscape. No tint, surely, can be more 
agreeable than that of our sand-stones, and the yellow 
ochreous stain which belongs to the old cleavage of 
the trap-rock is as rich as that of the quarries of 
Caen. Then there is the lichened surface of a world 
of scattered boulders—their fresh bright cleavage 
with its spangles of mica, or the homely brown  
-P-A-G-E-275
. MR. URBAN AND A COUNTRY HOUSE. 261 
weather stains of myriads of dispersed fragments. 
And even if agreement of tint be wanting, it is quite 
feasible to build of wholly refuse stones in such way 
as to admit of a “rough-cast ” covering of mortar, 
which by the simple appliance of lime-wash and 
some cheap pigment, may be toned to any color 
desired : or, by selection of stones for the quoins and 
window jambs, these might show their natural sur- 
faces, while the intervals were “ rough-cast.” A kin- 
dred though more decided contrast of color might be 
secured by quoins and window trimmings of brick, 
while the general surface (sunk two or three inches) 
might be treated as already suggested. By these 
devices the rudest stones might be worked into a 
solid home. 
Another method, in which comparatively worth- 
less material may be utilized in the construction of 
a house, which would have all the warmth and nearly 
all the durability of a building wholly of stone, is to 
blend the timber and mason-work together—framing 
as usual, though with a nice regard to joints and 
effective panelling, and after this, building in with 
coarse rubble, to be rough-cast on completion, leaving 
the timbers exposed. This is the old Saxon country 
house, of which many examples are to be found in 
the cathedral cities of England, and of which the 
Shakespeare house is a notable but very humble type. + 
 
-P-A-G-E-276

Instances of this mode of construction are not 
common in this country—scarcely known indeed at 
the North; but quaint specimens are to be seen in 
Louisiana and in Florida. By the favor of a friend, 
T introduce a little sketch of a very modest building 
of this sort in the neighborhood of New Orleans.

  I am sure that something larger might be done in 
this way, which would haye a very racy quaintness ; 
and which, with its timber balcony and jutting 
rooflets and ample porches might offer a very invit- 
ing show. 
Brick may also be used effectively for the filling 
in of such exposed carpentry of the frame ; and if such 
timber be given a dark chocolate tint, the contrast is 
very striking and pleasing. 
I give a sketch of such a house, with the addition

Aside from those who object to the appearance of a 
stone house, there are many who entertain the very 
   
-P-A-G-E-278
  
  264 RURAL STUDIES. 
current prejudice that such buildings must needs be 
damp. If damp, the dampness must be due to faulty 
construction. Nothing more is needed to secure dry- 
ness than to “fur off” widely from the stone, and 
to allow a free circulation of air between the interior 
and exterior walls. In this way not only is dryness 
secured, but a degree of warmth in winter, and of 
coolness in summer, which no wooden walls can 
maintain. In this connection it may be worth while 
to note the fact, that the larger part of the civilized 
portion of the world have been living in stone houses 
for the last few centuries, and they have weathered 
the damps pretty courageously. 
But the objection to country houses of stone is 
not so much on the score of appearance or of. 
imagined dampness, as of cost. The great durability 
is hardly taken into our American estimates. There 
are rural householders who look forward twenty 
years—some who look forward fifty years ; but those 
who look forward a century and build for the genera- 
tions to come, may be counted on one’s fingers, 
What builder of our day reckons upon the wants or 
comforts of his grand-child ? What boy counts upon 
living in his father’s house? There are exceptions, 
doubtless, but the rule is, dispersion—sale—aliena- 
tion; and not one man in a thousand is shaded by 
the oaks that gave shelter to his grandsire. If I
-P-A-G-E-279
MR. URBAN AND A COUNTRY HOUSE. 265 
build a house which is in sound and saleable condi- 
tion forty or fifty years hence, what more is needed ? 
But even under this short-sighted view, is the house 
of wood more economical than the house of stone ? 
If, as I have hinted, the projector aims at a finical 
nicety of exterior surface, there can be no question 
that economy is largely in favor of the use of wood; 
but if a man will have the courage to violate conven- 
tional tastes in this respect, and be content, nay, be 
boastful of a rural residence—if it offer only agreea- 
ble outline and afford ample security for all comfort 
and elegance within, there is a large doubt if stone, 
if readily accessible, be not the more economic 
material. A large allowance in its favor is to be 
made in view of the fact that the painters’ bills must 
needs be modest, and that repairs for an indefinite 
series of years will be almost infinitesimal. And yet 
whatever may be a man’s plottings in favor of rude 
material, and a resolute indifference to other beauty 
of exterior than the natural faces of the scattered 
boulders in his fields, it is quite possible that the city 
masons, if consulted, will swell their estimates to the 
same aggregate that belongs to the nice finish of the 
town houses. Every experiment, even in the direc: 
tion of economy, is taxed somewhat by reason of its 
quality of experiment. 
To avoid this tax it would be well to seek out 
12 
   
-P-A-G-E-280
  266 RURAL STUDIES. 
some trusty and sagacious foreman who could be 
brought to entertain some pride in the issue of the 
proposed scheme and allow him to select the laborers 
through whom it should be carried into execution 
on “day’s wages.” Good country wall-layers, who 
have only a little deftness in the use of the trowel, 
would be capital co-workers ; and at all hazards, that 
riffraff of lazy fellows should be discarded who de- 
light in hammering out ten listless hours in deface- 
ment of the beautiful natural cleavage of our rocks. 
Another matter worthy of full consideration is 
the fact that the cost of a stone house increases 
rapidly with its height ; the first twelve feet may be 
easily manageable, but the next twelve involve por- 
tentous array of scaffolding, and the lifting of large 
masses of material: economy would thus seem to 
dictate, where stone is employed, low walls and a 
large area. Would our country houses lose in pic- 
turesqueness or in comfort by such a redidjustment of 
proportions ? 
Form and Color. 
HIS leads me to speak of form. The man who 
goes up two flights of stairs every night in the 
country to his bed, does a very preposterous thing. 
If not two, why go up one? A large compensa-
-P-A-G-E-281

tion of country life lies in the possession of space: no 
brick wall flanks your rear; no neighbor’s area lies 
under your dining-room windows ; ample stretch of 
ground for all architectural fancies surrounds and in- 
vites you. Why not improve it? Does character 
lie in tallness? The old Romans—those luxurious 
comfort-seekers—understood the charm that lay in a 
cubiculum, if not a dormitorium on the first floor ; and 
with a door half open (such doors as they had) they 
might go to sleep, lulled by the tinkle of a fountain 
in the hall. I don’t think any of Pliny’s villas were 
as high as those of a great many (in sight from my 
door) who don’t know whether he was Greek or 
Chinaman. 
Of course we don’t want, in this age of the world, 
to take our building fancies from the dead men of 
Pompeii or of Tusculum; and I have only interpo- 
lated this allusion to show that a man’s dignity is not 
necessarily measured by the height of the house he 
lives in. All the strong, robber classes of the world, 
whenever they have lived in houses, have, I think, 
inclined to tall ones. Such were those German 
barons who perched their eyries along the Rhine, 
and the thievish borderers by the Tweed who have 
left us such precious specimens as “ Johnny Arm- 
strong’s Tower.” On the other hand, the domesticity 
of the old Saxons expressed itself in low, wide
-P-A-G-E-282
  268 RURAL STUDIES. 
spreading buildings, typical of a quiet life, and of a 
country abundance that came by peaceful labor. 
There are robber classes in our day, and they live 
(many of them) in tall houses; so do a great many 
nonest people, for that matter. In fact a great fault 
of our country architecture lies in its being too am- 
pitious: it has indeed come out from that old hid- 
eous conventionalism of two stories, white clap-boards 
and green blinds; but it still seeks to startle with 
something grand—something that shall tell a noisy 
brazen story at the first glance. Yet a fit house 
and home—fit for its belongings—fit in size, in color, 
in outline (like a man of wholly fit character)—should 
win upon you by degrees, charming you at each suc- 
ceeding look by some rare and modest beauties, 
which are the more attractive because found only 
after intelligent search. A great, gaunt, cumbrous 
exterior tells all its story at a glance: you may study 
it curiously in search of details, but there is no hearty 
interest in the study. But a humbler line of roof, so 
humble that we catch sight bit by bit of its peeping 
gables, its jutting porches, its low flanking line of 
offices—half hid by shrubbery and half warmed by a 
blaze of sunlight—this, somehow, by a certain relishy 
smack of domesticity belonging to its vague indis- 
tinguishable outline and scattered chimney-stacks, 
piques all the home-feeling in a man.
-P-A-G-E-283

A great house, whose picture we have seen in the 
architectural books, we know; and we admire it 
coldly, if we admire it at all. But a lesser one—less

beautiful, possibly, judged by the conventional laws 
of the art—whose quaint assemblage of modest peaks

-P-A-G-E-284
  270 RURAL STUDIES. 
viduality of the occupant, and is invested with a 
homely yet cheery quietude—this we admire with a 
livelier interest. 
If, however, economy in the use of stone for do- 
mestic purposes demands comparatively low walls, it 
need not cheat us wholly of our chambers. A French 
roof, with great perpendicularity to its first pitch, 
will give airy height for upper rooms and ample 
ventilating space above; and such a roof, slated in 
diamond pattern, will contrast admirably with the 
natural surfaces of the boulders below, and the 
irregular lines of mortar. : 
Again, I do not know anything in the laws of 
taste, apart from conventionalisms, to which we all 
yield so implicitly, which would forbid the placing 
of an upper story of wooden construction upon a 
ground-story of stone. The idea may be shocking at 
first, but I ask the reader to fancy for a moment an 
irregular mass of honest stone building of the height 
and simplicity I have suggested, pierced with win- 
dows of irregular proportions (just where needed 
for the best light). Next imagine a wooden structure 
of a story in height, with simple sharp pent roof, 
relieved by a gable half down its length, placed upon 
the stone—overhanging it if you please by a foot in 
width and length, with its floor timbers rounded into 
the shape of supporting corbels; then imagine here
-P-A-G-E-285

and there a half-dozen of these floor-beams projecting 
four feet or more, so as to form a dainty balcony at 
  
            
  some upper window, supported by simple timber 
braces carried down into the stone-work; others
-P-A-G-E-286
272 RURAL STUDIES, 
taay project still further, to carry the peaked rooflet 
of a porch, whose supporting posts shall reach the 
ground; the wooden covering may be of sheathing 
arranged vertically, tinted brown to harmonize with 
the stone, and the battens of whitish gray to har- 
monize with the mortar lines below. The profes- 
sional men might call this very inelegant; but I am 
not sure that strict artistic elegance is the best quality 
for a home in the country. The best qualities in it 
will be those that call out most promptly a man’s 
sense of domesticity—that suggest easy comfort, 
ample room, odd loitering nooks, indefinite play of 
fire-light and lamp-light, wide and unpretentious hos- 
pitality. Above all things a country house, to have 
its best charm, must look livable. I use an excep- 
tionable word, but I think readers will catch my 
meaning. The mere suggestion—such as tightly- 
closed shutters will give—of rooms kept for show, 
barred for weeks and months against light and air, 
will ruin its charm. Its walls, windows, roof, chim- 
neys, must beam with cheeriness. Its porch must 
nod a welcome. A terrier frisking through a half- 
opened door, a cat dozing on a balcony, a dove 
swooping round the gable, will lend more charms by 
odds than carefully swept gravel and a statue of 
Diana on the lawn. There must be no stiff pairing 
of circle against circle, or of hanging basket against 
   
-P-A-G-E-287
    
  
  MR URBAN AND A COUNTRY HOUSE. 273 
hanging basket—above all, no such execrable tom- 
foolery as iron dogs or wooden puppets. A Grecian 
temple for a-coal shed, or a small Strasburg minster 
for a dog-house, will help largely to make a country 
house absurd. Nay, an excess of nicety upon the 
walks, as if the spade and roller of the gardener left 
it only yesterday and would be there again next 
morning, takes off the edge of a true home relish} 
even flowers themselves, if piled up in very trim 
and very orderly masses, as in the show-rows of a 
florist, will lose half their power to lend grace; still 
worse if they are perched in soldierly array along the 
porch or veranda, renewed so soon as their bloom 
fades, like children never allowed to appear even in 
party dress save under promise of keeping still. 
Who, pray, can take comfort in lounging upon a 
porch, where a careless step may break off some 
floweret of a rare cactus, or enjoy a bit of greens- 
ward where he fears to knock off the ashes of his 
cigar? Who wants to be petrified in a country 
house, either his own or another’s? I have seen 
them before now so terribly fine, so prudishly neat, 
so martinet-like in order, that it seemed to me the 
very gardeners should be wearing leathern stocks 
and pipe-clay: a week of such atmosphere would 
drive me mad. 
Perhaps I am peculiar in these notions about the 
12* 
 
-P-A-G-E-288
  274 RURAL STUDIES. 
real homishness of a country place. I know there 
are very good and Christian people who never allow 
a dog about their premises, or a duck, or a dove, or 
a stray dandelion upon their lawn, and who buy 
statuary and rustic iron work (always in pairs) for 
their grounds, and who keep the front blinds closed, 
and who manage to give to their sunniest porch the 
look of a church door upon week-days; but why 
such people should come into the country or live in 
the country I could never understand. It puzzles me 
prodigiously. 
I like hugely that good old English word—home- 
liness. It ought to have again its first meaning. 
Pretty-faced women have corrupted it. It describes 
all that is best about a country house. I have ad- 
vocated the use of homely material and of homely 
methods, believing these are best fitted judiciously 
used, to lend real homeliness to a house in the 
country. 
Mr. Urban’s Purchase. 
R. URBAN has at last positively succeeded in 
making purchase of his farm of fifty acres, or 
thereabout. It has its undulations, its scattered woods, 
its obtruding cliff—in short, a sufficiently varied sur- 
face to admit of a certain picturesque treatment,
-P-A-G-E-289
  MR. URBAN AND A COUNTRY HOUSE. 275 
without great interference with ecorfomic results. 
For Mr. Urban is bent upon having his corn- 
patch—however much it may cost him; and bent 
upon having his trim lines of carrots, his mercers, 
his half dozen or more of fine cattle, and his pastur- 
age, where he may watch his Alderneys at their 
quiet grazing, or their noontide siesta under the 
trees. 
I give, on the next page, a drawing of his farm as 
it appeared at the time of his taking possession. 
The house, .A, is reasonably sound, and well situ- 
ated, but small. It will admit of temporary repairs and 
additions, which he determines upon forthwith. The 
barn, B, is wholly unfit for his plans, being small, ill- 
placed, and shaky in its joints. He consults me in 
regard to the position for a new one, andI advise 
him to place it in the edge of the mossy old orchard 
(whose trees are nearly worthless), where a little rise 
of ground will admit of a cellar underneath both 
barn and carriage-house. I suggest also in connec- 
tion with it a cow-stable which shall extend west- 
ward in order to furnish a protecting lee to his cattle- 
yard, and to connect immediately with the fields in 
the rear. 
The fences are terrible in number, but are for- 
tunately nearly all of rails, and can therefore be 
placed out of consideration in the new laying out of
-P-A-G-E-290
  276 RURAL STUDIES. 
  
      
the farm. An exception is to be noted in regard 
to the line of enclosure marked O upon the diagram,
-P-A-G-E-291
MR. URBAN AND A COUNTRY HOUSE. 27% 
which—as well as the fences along ings side uf the 
high-road—are of old mossy boulders, too cumbrous 
to be removed without great cost. Mistress Urban 
is in despair at this, as she thinks that the partic- 
ular fence designated will prevent any breadth to 
her lawn. In the interests of economy, however, I 
venture to advise that it be left ip its presert posi- 
tion—that it be righted where it shows any bulging 
propensities, and promise that in two or three years 
at most the greater part of it shall be screened by 
irregular groups of shrubbery, and that where its 
line is discernible, it shall be mantled with such a 
tangled wealth of Virginia creepers and ivy (the 
exposure being north) as shall make it worthy its 
place, and divide admiration with the half dozen of 
mouse-colored Alderneys feeding beyond. 
The garden is out of position, besides being upon 
a soil ill suited to it. Mr. Urban is moreover urgent 
for a “ great garden ;” he wishes to prepare one in 
the best manner, and means that his standard pears 
and dwarf fruits and grapevines shall come in for a 
share of the benefit. 
I establish it upon the level plateau of land to the 
southward of his cattle-yard, giving it the advantage 
of shelter from the stables, the cold grapery, the 
compost-shed, the hot-house and the hennery—as 
will appear by consulting the second drawing of

The cold grapery is marked 7’; the hot-house, Z, 
whose fire, by proper adjustment of one of its flues, 
gives warmth to the poultry-house, which (marked 
D) is immediately adjoining. A sheltered spot for 
hot-bed and compost-heap is provided in a position 
convenient to the manure deposits of the cattle-yard. 
A broad walk, at least eight feet in width, traverses 
the garden, and divides near the southern border, to 
give place to a picturesque coppice of trees and 
shrubs, whose interior border is planted with hardy 
and showy herbaceous flowers; these again are 
hemmed in every summer-time by a narrower and 
exterior border of the gayest of “bedding” plants. 
Behind, and to the southward of the garden paling 
or hedge is a green lane, serving to connect the pas- 
ture-land by the high-road, with the cultivated lands 
to the westward, and with the stable court. This 
connection may be established, while the west lands 
are under tillage, by means of a hurdle fence, which 
shall extend the lane along the west border of the 
garden. 
The fields marked Wand F are, as expressed upon 
the diagram, either in tillage or in meadow ; and the 
multitude of fences has been done away with. The 
southernmost of these two fields is laid bare for 
thorough tillage of any character, and its neighbor 
to the north has only a protecting belt of wood. 
   
-P-A-G-E-294

The enclosure X, having a ledge and an old group 
of forest trees in its northwestern angle (offering 
admirable shelter), may have its picturesquely dis- 
posed orcharding, or may be planted with ornamental 
trees, as the proprietor may fancy. In either case, 
with a few protective hurdles, it may be cropped by 
a score of Southdowns; but it must be fairly under- 
stood that no orcharding will do its best or even its 
second best, except it be kept under thorough culti- 
vation, and no grass permitted within reach of its 
most divergent rootlets. 
The walks and entrance drive explain themselves. 
The dotted line H J, indicates a view of a distant 
village spire, which upon the first diagram, as will be 
seen, was entirely cut off by two or three intruding 
trees ; and even when these were removed, the view 
was sadly interfered with by the mossy wall already 
spoken of. To obviate this difficulty I suggested a 
gap in the wall thereabout, and the establishment 
of a broad rustic gate under whose rude arch the 
distant spire would come into sight as through a 
frame-work. A rough sketch will give a hint of the 
vista. 
No pencilling, however, will represent that soft 
suffusion of smoky color which enwraps the little 
spire and house-roofs, as they come to the eye through 
the gap in the sharp dark green of the foreground. 
 
-P-A-G-E-295
MR. URBAN AND A COUNTRY HOUSE. 281 
The view to the northeast (in the direction of the 
dotted line 7), at the time of taking possession, looked 
over a foul marsh lying upon the opposite side of the 
high-road ; this marsh received the drainage of all 
  the elevated ground to the north and west, and its 
excess of water leaked away by an indecisive and 
intermittent flow through the pasture land marked 
P. Under the old regime—as will be seen by recur- 
rence to the drawing of the farm at time of purchase 
—this pasture served as “meadow,” and produced 
its annual quota of bog hay. Beyond the marsh and 
the highlands which skirted it to the northeast, was 
an extremely pretty view of a range of low moun- 
tains, some two miles distant, in the lee of which were 
to be seen a spire and one or two tall chimneys. 
But the unkempt, slatternly marsh-land in the fore- 
ground ruined the scene. It might be planted out 
indeed ; but an effective planting out would interfere
-P-A-G-E-296
282 RURAL STUDIES. 
somewhat with some of the most picturesque objects 
in the distance. I advised a slight excavation of a 
portion of the marsh so as to show a little lakelet, 
over whose farther arm a rustic bridge might be 
thrown—the bridge serving” as a portion of the bar- 
rier between the area of plaisance ground around the 
pond and the pasture beyond. By this device and 
adroit disposition of shrubbery, the whole area south 
of the high-road would appear from the windows of 
the mansion to constitute but one enclosure, within 
which the pet Alderneys might be seen cropping the 
herbage, or cooling themselves in the pool beyond 
the bridge. 
Of course such disposition of the matter (which 
I have tried to illustrate in the drawing) commended 
  itself most warmly to Mrs: Urban and to the Misses 
Urbans. Nor did the pater familias greatly object. 
To add still more to the picturesqueness of this 
 
-P-A-G-E-297
  MR. URBAN AND A COUNTRY HOUSE. 283 
view across the road, I proposed the introduction of 
the gardener’s cottage upon the wayside, in such man- 
ner that its quaint gable should peep from the trees 
upon the right of the scene, and a well-trimmed hedge 
of hemlock shut out all sight of the road-way. The 
diagram already given will show the position of the 
water, the walks, the gardener’s cottage, and the 
gardener’s patch of vegetables—this latter being 
quite out of sight from the high grounds by the man- 
sion. , 
It is quite essential to the effectiveness of this 
design for the lay-out of the grounds that the public 
road be kept in neat and trim condition—so neat and 
so trim that the visitor approaching it from the south 
(the direction of the nearest railway station), shall, 
when he arrives opposite the gardener’s cottage 
(whose porch must jut upon the highway), involun- 
tarily reckon it a gate-lodge of some private domain 
into which he just there enters. For the fuller 
establishment of this pleasant deceit, the real entrance 
gates should be of the simplest and most unpretend- 
ing character—as if they were but portions of some 
interior enclosures. Whatever grass or shrubs may 
grow within the public road after passing the gar- 
dener’s cottage should be as zealously cared for and 
as trimly kept as if they were within the enclosing 
wall. One may be assured that the neighboring
-P-A-G-E-298
  284 RURAL STUDIES. 
public will never resent such careful keeping of the 
high-road, and they may be brought by it, in time 
to practise some such picturesque devices on their 
own account. 
Another hint I think it necessary to drop here. 
The lay-out of a place upon paper it is easy to make 
very engaging and tasteful; there is indeed no limit 
to the graces of curve, which may be laid down by 
an adroit draftsman upon a fair sheet of Bristol 
board. But it is a very different matter to establish 
the same graces upon the land itself. Unlimited 
expenditure may indeed make any surface conform 
itself to the curvatures and devices of a drawing. 
But the art of arts in landscape gardening is to make 
outlay illustrate the beauties of the land, and not to 
cramp and deplete the land to illustrate the charms of 
the drawing. 
Particular curves or undulations of surface, which 
may have a most attractive look in a finished land- 
scape, may lack very many of the esentials of grace 
if transferred to paper, after the ordinary manner of 
topographical drawing. If we looked at landscape 
effects always from a balloon—if the hills were all 
fore-shortened, and the curves of walks or drives all 
determinable at a glance, a ground map would be a 
very fair guide by which to determine artistic effects. 
But the truth is that in nature the hills have their

perspective ; the scattered trees or coppices are not 
mere woolly blotches, but slant their shadows upon 
the surface and toss their tops into the sky-line ; 
curves are not cognizable in their length, or ease, 
or abruptnesses at a glance—we steal upon them by 
degrees; they please by their easy cheatery—by 
their unexpected sequence—by such abrupt diver- 
sions, even, as have palpable cause in inequality of 
surface or obtruding rock or cliff. It is quite pos- 
sible, indeed—nay, it is altogether probable that the 
curves and devices which are most charmingly effect- 
ive in the work itself, may have a stiffness and an 
impertinence upon the map which will thoroughly 
disappoint. 
As cases in point, I remember once looking down 
with exceeding interest from the height of some 
Italian town (I think in Bologna) upon what seemed 
a charming garden; its curves were full of grace ; 
its little coppices were admirably adjusted ; its flow 
of walks as happy as a dream; but when I found my 
way to it afterward, by a bribe to its custodian, and 
met it upon tame level—the bird’s-eye view being 
gone—it seemed the baldest of dreary pattern-work 
in turf—with no significance in its curves, and no 
keeping in its lines. 
Again, there was a day when I went wandering 
in sun and shadow through the masses of a Scotch  
-P-A-G-E-300

garden, not far from Hawthornden, with cliff and 
brook and water and bridge and tangles of wild- 
wood—all so caught by the landscape designer and 
so strung along the foot-ways he had planted, that 
delight was unceasing; and when I asked for a 
sketch of its meandering over that broken surface, it 
presented such an array of tame lines, and meaning- 
less curvatures and violent crooks as to express 
nothing of the grace which on the grounds themselves 
flowed over, and made constant enchantment. 
A Sunny House. 
* 7-E will suppose that Mr. Urban is thoroughly 
satisfied with his garden and grounds—that 
he finds his newly planted trees growing apace—that 
his Southdowns are all that an accomplished grazier 
could desire; but the old house becomes at last a 
weariness. Not because it is old; nor yet because it 
is comparatively small—so small that he has to billet, 
from time to time, a bachelor visitor in a little loft 
of his tool-house ; but it has no wide and open front- 
age to the sun. He insists that the new one, of 
which he projects the building out of the rough 
material from his cliff, shall have at least a glimpse 
of southern sunshine in every habitable room below.

“Tam tired of the gloom of north exposures,” he 
writes ; “ wood-fires are very well, but the blaze of 
them is not equal to the blaze of sunshine. Do what 
you will with the north side, but the parlor must look 
to the south, and the library (of course) and the din- 
ing-room, and—without going up-stairs—there must, 
if possible, be a billiard-room and a bed-room, looking 
the same sunny way. In brief, my notion is, to have 
a house with plenty of room, and no north side to it. 
Can the problem be solved ? 
“T don’t care for shape, if it be only picturesque, 
and meet the wants I have named above. A con- 
siderable slope of the land toward the west upon the 
locality I have chosen, (keeping all the old charming 
views in leash) will admit of an airy basement at the 
western end, and full windows (two of them) to the 
south. This would furnish a good spot for billiards, 
if you can contrive a respectable stairway down from 
the hall; and if the billiard-room opens out west- 
wardly into a special conservatory, where one can 
smoke his cigar to kill the red spiders (or green ones, 
I forget which), all the better. 
“ What on earth you will do with the north side 
of the house under this ruling of windows and wants, 
Idon’t know. I should say a long picture-gallery, 
if I had pictures. What if it were to be a blank 
wall with ivies growing over it? But then there’s

the kitchen and laundry, which the mistress insists 
must have either western or eastern light—if not 
both. Treat the problem as you will, keeping in 
mind the coveted exposures—the wish to use up 
some of my raw material in the shape of rocks, and 
withal, the desire not to make the affair too burden- 
somely expensive. 
“P. S—Mrs. Urban wishes a boudoir, which 
must have a south look-out too, and mind—no base- 
ment kitchen. 
“P. S—Again. Mrs. U. says the laundry 
might be in the basement, but not near the billiard- 
room, and the dairy must be convenient and cool, and 
the kitchen must not be too far from the dining-room, 
and no dumb-waiters ; and it would be very nice to 
have a veranda for flowers, by the dining-room, and 
not to forget the sunny bed-room. 
“She wishes a large hall, and well lighted, and 
servants’ stairs apart, and hopes you'll place the front 
door in a protected situation ; (south side, if possi- 
ble.) And a good large China closet and butler’s 
room, very well lighted ; and bath-room convenient, 
on the first floor.” 
Fortunately a considerable slope of the land to 
the west admitted of the establishment of laundry and 
of larder (adjoining) in the basement of the kitchen 
extension, and also of a roomy billiard-room with

east, I give a rough draft, showing the general dispo- 
sition of the rooms. 
By this it will be seen that every considerable 
apartment, including even the boudoir, has a southern 
exposure. I give no drawing of any ground-plan, 
save that of the first floor, and supplement it only by 
arude perspective sketch of the building, in which 
Ihave endeavored to incorporate some of the hints 
already given with respect to the use of homely ma- 
terials and the intermingling of a timber framework 
with country masonry. One great advantage of this 
humble style lies in the fact, that it permits of the 
attachment of many of the rural offices (as, for 
instance, the ice-house and work-room above, and con- 
tiguous dairy) to the main building, without offensive 
contrast,—at the same time contributing to the 
general effect of the mass of building. Mass counts 
for a great deal in a country house and in landscape ; 
—most of all irregular mass—which can be compassed 
(economy considered) only by associating some of the 
exterior offices of a rural home with the home itself. 
All this, the rough material, and the simple method 
of combining timber framework with a rude filling- 
in of masonry, permits and invites. 
Observe that the tall, tower-like building on the 
right of the view requires no expensive interior fin- 
ish; it covers offices which must be provided in

graceful, climbing plants, it adds wonderfully to the 
general effect. 
The outline and the tints of a country house, as 
I have already urged, are the great things to be reck- 
oned, when we rate landscape effects. It is quite pos- 
sible that the finesse and precision of the city architect 
will tell no story upon a brook side, or on such slope of 
land as Mr. Urban has chosen for his site. Effective 
building of a country house wants a picture-maker as 
much as architect. First, and chiefest of all, every con- 
venience must be supplied—all sunny exposure made 
available—all juxta-positions reconciled—all home-, 
like qualities guarded. Next, the mass of building 
must tally with the landscape, and illustrate it with 
a rich, good color of home. Outline must not be 
monotonous or heavy, but varied and piquant: roofs 
must gleam a welcome, porches promise hospitality, 
and chimney-tops, showing pennants of smoke, 
lift up standing invitations. 
Conclusion. 
AVING thus presented—as it were, by turn of 
kaleidoscope and probably by wearisome re- 
petition—all the shades and outlines of the fifty-acre 
purchase which my friend Urban has had in mind, T 
cannot close without a summing up. 
 
-P-A-G-E-307
  MR. URBAN AND A COUNTRY HOUSE. 2938 
All that I have laid down in way of design, 
whether for walks, plantations, or country-house, has 
been intended for suggestion rather than literal ful- 
filment. Every locality must have its own interpreta- 
tion at the hands of the artist. Method must vary— 
not only as the hills and the slopes vary, but as the 
wants and the tastes of the occupant vary. : 
There are farms I know, unctuous with an accu- 
mulated fertility, and with right lines running athwart 
their slopes, which might be converted into charming 
park-lands, with every grass-field rounded into a 
lawn ; but, to my eye, they would gain nothing, if in 
this conversion the economic interests of the holder 
were ignored. Land does its best service where it 
best feeds our human wants: not necessarily gross 
wants, but all wants,—fine as well as gross. 
I have endeavored to demonstrate that economic 
management need not necessarily offend against the 
rulings of good taste. I feel sure that the highest 
beauty of landscape will ultimately bring no loss; 
and I forecast confidently the time—perhaps a cen- 
tury hence—when all the beauties and all the econo- 
mies and all the humanities will be in leash. 
Again, a country home will not yield its largest 
enjoyments to any who adopt it in virtue of a mere 
whim ; there must be love; and with love, patience ; 
and with patience, trust. This mistress who wears
-P-A-G-E-308
  294 RURAL STUDIES. 
the golden daffodils in her hair, and the sweet violets 
at her girdle, and heaps her Jap every autumn time 
with fruit, must be conciliated, and humored, and 
rewarded, and flattered, and caressed. She resents 
capricious and fitful attentions—like a woman; re- 
ceiving them smilingly, and sulking when they are 
done. 
I would not counsel any man to think of a home 
in the country, whose heart does not leap when he 
sees the first grass-tips lifting in the city court-yards, 
and the boughs of the Forsythia adrip with their 
golden censers. Many a man mistakes a certain 
pleasurable association of his boyish days with the 
country, for an earnest love; it may well be only a 
sentiment which will wilt with the scorching heats 
of August, and die utterly when the frosts nip the 
verdure of the year. 
A man may take his business te the country— 
whether as manufacturer, stock-breeder, tobacco-grow- 
er—and decorate his business with country charms ; 
but the retired citizen cannot go there, and find en- 
joyment, except he have an ineradicable love for such 
charms—except he can read lovingly such books as 
those of Walton, or White of Selborne. 
I quote, in closing, a verse by that “ excellent 
preacher and angler,” Phineas Fletcher; there is a 
heavy British mildew on the lines; and the country- 
 
-P-A-G-E-309

man bepraised by the poet would not surely make a 
very active railway-director ; and yet the mouldy old 
British portrait will not serve badly as a pendant to 
these Rural Studies :— é 
No empty hopes, no courtly fears him fright, 
No begging wants his middle fortune bite, 
But sweet content exiles both misery and spite. 
His certain life, that never can deceive him, 
Is full of thousand sweets, and rich content ; 
The smooth-leaved beeches in the field receive him 
With coolest shade, till noontide’s heat be spent : 
His life is neither tossed in boisterous seas, 
Or the vexatious world, or lost in slothful ease : | 
Pleased, and full blest he lives, when he his God can please,

  MY FARM OF EDGEWOOD. By DONALD G. MITCHELL. 
2 vol. 2mo., on Laid Tinted Paper. Price, $1 75. 
A new issue now coming from the press for the Spring Trade. 
“The cultivation of the scholarly gentleman shows itself in every page, 
and a sunuy geniality of soul throws a softening tint over the ordinarily 
unpoetical and angular characteristies of agriculture.”—Hvening Post. 
“The instruction which it embodies will be none the less valued because 
of the desultory method which the author has followed, or the many di- 
ressions into which he has been beguiled. By the great mass of readers, 
fextures will be considered asan additional charm. The light 
movement of the author's style, the graceful and delicate transi- 
tions which he makes, the quiet humor in which he so naturally indulges, 
the sly but good-natured satire which seems to drop so naturally from his 
pen, and the unaffected yet chastened pathos into which he rises for a mo- 
ment, are all exquisitely wrought into a varied and beautiful tissue, which 
is fitted to give perpetual delight to the cultivated reader, and to be itself 
rument of culture to the unrefined.” —New-Englander. 
“It is a book whose merit can hardly be over-praised. It should be in 
every farmer's library, as a volume full of practical advice to aid his daily 
work, and full of ennobling suggestions to lift his calling into a kind of 
epic dignity.”—Atlanlic Monthly. 
“Mr, Mitchell has unusual skill in putting his experience, his culture, 
his taste, his delicate perceptions, into such literary forms as to make them 
of use to others, ‘This work has the vitality which springs from a love of 
and acquaintance with nature, and-will long be read as one of the best and

drawbacks of our New-England country life.”—North American Review.

TIONAL Minister or Connecticut. By Donatp G. Mrrouett, author 
of “ Reveries of a Bachelor,” “My Farm of Edgewood,” &c., &. 
2vols.12mo0. Price, $3 50. 
“The work affords a rare picture of New England life and manners, 
It is every way a charming sketch, and must improve the mind and heart 
of every one who reads it.”—Episcopalian. 
«The book shows the blended powers of the student, the thinker, the 
poet, and tie humorist, and is read as we read Addison or Goldsmith, 
with tranquil delight.”—Boston Transcript, 
“ Asa piece of rhetoric, it is charming, of course; for no American 
writer, since the days of Washington Irving, uses the English language as 
the ‘Ik Marvel? of « few years since, and the ‘Farmer of Edgewood? 
of to-day."—Round Table. : 
“Ttis quite evident that, personally, the author has no sympathy with 
the theological system which ‘Dr, Johns? is made to represent, and which 
is drawn in its hardest and extremest form ; but still his sturdy sense of 
justice makes him to deseribe him as a really noble character, of which 
no school of orthodoxy and no church has need to be ashamed, and one 
which commanded the profoundest respect and lifelong confidence of the 
worldly Maverick.’—Hours at Home. : 
“No book of the author seems to us so good. The great charm of it 
lies in the truthfulness of its picture of New England life.’—New Haven 
Palladium. 
“In one respect Dr. Johns can be spoken of with unalloyed approval ; 
it is a picture of life and manners that were of a social state that is fast 
passing away, the mere shadows of which are on the land.”—Boston 
Traveller. Z 
“The doctor is a kind, unworldly man, and the most interesting person 
in the book ; his life has been shadowed and softened by sorrow, and he 
learns to love the little Adéle, though she is a Roman Catholic, and by his 
love converts her to Protestantism. With his rebellions and warm-heart- 
edson he has a sadder experience ; the boy, driven from home by his 
father’s apparent, and his hard old aunt’s real, harshness, drifts about the 
world, doing nothing bad, but tossed and worn by religious doubts and 
love for Adéle, till at last he finds rest in perfect reconciliation with his 
father, the knowledge of Adéle’s love for him and death.”— Daily Spy. 
“Heh ently seen, face to face, much of what he describes. His 
characters stand out clear, distinet, and life-like, with their geveral fea- 
tures of worldly wisdom, shrewd common sense, kindly feeling, exuber- 
ance of spirits, precise manners, and unfeigned picty. In dealing with 
these the autlior is quite at home, and his dclineations are at once graceful 
and truthful" Y. Evangelist.

    FOREWORD 
Excellence of workmanship on the part of the 
playwright is the basis of choice on which plays have 
been included in A Guide to Longer Plays. In the 
mind of the compiler, the plays listed are considered 
worthy of revival by Little Theatres and independent 
and serious dramatic organizations. In connection 
with any plays not listed, it must be remembered that 
many of the theater’s best productions have not yet 
appeared in printed format. 
Every effort has been made to make A Guide to 
Longer Plays as complete as possible and, from time 
to time, it is planned by the compiler and by the 
publisher to revise the list and include in it additional 
longer plays as they appear in printed form from the 
presses of various publishers,

  Longer Dramas from Appleton’s List 
THE SEA WOMAN’S CLOAK 
and NOVEMBER EVE 
By Amélie Rives (Princess Troubetzkoy) 
Out of the legends and folklore of Ireland and her own particular 
fantasy she has made two plays as Irish as anything of Yeats's, 
Synge’s, Lady Gregory's. As individual. As enchanting. 
The Sea Woman’s Cloak (3 m. 3 w. and others.), November 
Eve (8 m. 8 w. and others.). $2.00. 
MARCH HARES 
By Harry Wagstaff Gribble 
A satire in three acts. First presented in New York at the Bijou 
Theatre, later at the Punch and Judy in the summer of 1921, later 
revived at the Little Theatre. “It offers,” says Heywood Broun, 
“some of the most agile dialogue that our theatre has known and 
reveals its author as the possessor of a rare gift for nonsense. And 
his nonsense is not just for the sheer trick of the thing, but molded 
with satirical intent.” New York Evening Telegram: “A delightful 
work, as good as Oscar Wilde at his best, sharply defined, brilliant, 
and deliciously amusing.” $2.00. 
GOAT ALLEY 
By Ernest Howard Culbertson 
Introduction by Ludwig Lewisohn 
A drama of Negro life in three acts. First presented at the Bijou 
Theatre, New York City, in June, 1921. (7 m.4w.). New York 
Tribune: “A stunning tragedy. In the characterization there are fine 
perception and vivid writing. There is heartbreak in this play.” 
Oakland Tribune: “‘Splendidly and heroically written. A play to 
meditate over.” $1.75. 
THE SUN CHASER 
By Jeannette Marks 
Author of ‘‘Three Welsh Plays’’ 
The search for happiness is the theme of this play, which is both 
realistic and—in the poignant figure of Ambrose Clark, who drunk- 
enly, lamely chases the sun—subtly symbolic (11 m. 3 w. 4 g. 1 b.). 
John Barrymore: “| have read “The Sun Chaser.’ I think it has great 
beauty and a curious sense of mood and imminent vague things. 
I also think it brilliantly characterized,” $1.75.

The Pulitzer Prize Play of 1921 
MISS LULU BETT 
A Play 
by Zona Gale 
With Foreword by 
Robert Benchley, Dramatic Critic of “Life,’”’ and 
Thomas Dickinson, Editor, “The Wisconsin Plays” 
A comedy of American life whose every speech brings 
delighted recognition of its human, everyday truth. 
Winner of the Pulitzer drama prize in 1921. The story 
of the play is woven around Lulu, a colorless household 
drudge, living in the home of her sister and brother-in- 
law. Dialogue so commonplace and ugly that it is 
highly effective and clever character delineation accom- 
pany the working out of the plot to the end, where 
Lulu finds a lover and happiness and so brings satis- 
faction to the sympathetic audience (4 m. 5 w.). 
“Realism raised to the nth power by Miss Gale's 
magic—True ‘comedy of manners,’ archly witty, deli- 
cately brilliant, glowingly human.”—Detroit News. 
“*(Miss Gale) has accomplished a miracle of character- 
ization and has done it with the economy the stage 
demands." —Springfield, Mass., Union. 
“A milestone in American Drama.’—Thomas Dickin- 
son.

of being a poet. No oneseems so subtly to get inside the child mind 
while writing for the theatre. While these plays have both action 
and piccorial values, the delightful way in which the phrases are 
turned and the inherent tenderness that is such an insistent note 
throughout are things that combine to make them strangely attrac- 
tive.” The Chicago Evening Post: ‘These plays really make as 
good reading as they make playing.” Oakland Tribune: “They 
are whimsical and charming, natural with the naturalness of a child.”

WILLIAM HAROLD PAYNE 
Wuwu1Am Harotp Payne was born at Farmington, Ontario 
County, New York, May 12, 1836. Quaker parentage and up- 
bringing were the formative influences of his youth. He 
studied first in the common schools, afterwards in Macedon 
Academy and in the New York Conference Seminary at Char- 
lotteville. After teaching for a time in the country schools, 
he was promoted to the headship of the public schools at 
Victor, New York. 
In 1858 he moved to Michigan, becoming principal of the 
Pnion School at Three Rivers, where he remained six years. 
The two following years he was in charge of the schools at 
Niles, the next three years at the head of Union Seminary, at 
Ypsilanti, then the leading preparatory school of the state. In 
1869 he was elected to the superintendency of schools at Adrian, 
Michigan, where he worked ten years. His Chapters on 
School Supervision published in 1875 and The Science and the 
Art of Teaching, 1879, are outgrowths of the Adrian period. 
From 1866 to 1870 he was editor of The Michigan Teacher. 
In 1879 he was called to the chair of the Science and the Art 
of Teaching at the University of Michigan, the first of its kind 
established in America. Here he remained eight years devel- 
oping his course of study and publishing two of his most notable 
works: Outlines of Educational Doctrine, 1882, and Contri- 
butions to the Science of Education, 1886. 
In 1888 the trustees of the Peabody Education Fund invited 
him to the presidency of the Peabody Normal College at 
Nashville, Tennessee. During the fourteen years that followed, 
Dr. Payne was the constructive leader in the training of

teachers for the Southern States. The chapters of this volume, 
which appeared first in 1901, were wrought in the main out of 
lectures and addresses made during the Peabody presidency, 
some of them being intended to further his administrative 
plans. They express variously the working idea he emphasized 
in his teaching and in the conduct of the College: sound schol- 
arship is the basis of the teacher’s professional training. 
In 1901 he was called to his old chair at Ann Arbor to re- 
main but a few years; on the eighteenth day of June, 1907, he 
died. 
The development of the Department of Education at Ann 
Arbor and of the Peabody College at Nashville, aside from his 
contributions to educational thought, are among the germinal 
achievements of this generation. 
For the material of this sketch we are largely indebted to 
the ‘‘In Memoriam’? address before the senate of the Univer- 
sity of Michigan by Professor Isaac N. Demmon, published in

PREFACE 
iv may help the reader to interpret the doctrines embodied 
in the following essays if he has before him a brief synopsis 
of the writer’s opinions on the education of teachers. Every 
man who has patiently studied the problems of education has 
formed for himself, little by little, an educational creed, or 
confession of faith; and it is well on such an occasion as the 
writing of a book to throw into articulate form the articles of 
one’s faith or belief as they relate to the field of thought 
traversed by writer and reader. 
Teaching is a spiritual art and classifies with music, poetry 
and oratory, rather than with the mechanic arts, the arts that 
deal with matter and its fixed and uniform relations. 
As teaching has to do with spirit, methods of teaching should 
not be fixed and invariable, but flexible and fluid, adapted to 
the modes and phases of variable spirit. In all intelligent and 
effective teaching, principles, rather than rules, should be 
held ata premium. Versatile teaching will draw its methods 
from prolific principles and will reflect the personality of the 
teacher who uses them. When methods become uniform, 
teaching becomes mechanical and wooden. 
Teachers should be educated rather than trained, education 
pointing to versatility and freedom, training to uniformity and 
mechanism. A teacher’s education should be of the liberal 
type. The teacher’ himself should first of all be a scholar in 
spirit and attainment, and his strictly professional studies 
should also be of the liberal type. 
A teacher’s strictly professional education will consist of 
5

4wo main elements or parts, the one psychological, the other, 
for want of a better term, logical; he must have a knowledge 
of mind in its organic modes of procedure while engaged in 
the act of acquiring knowledge, and he must know the educa- 
tion value of the different knowledges presented for acquisi- 
tion. The teachers’ art will then consist in intelligently 
adapting means to ends, and will exhibit the play of cause 
and effect. 
The science of psychology is convertible into the art of 
teaching only to a limited extent, many of the truths of psy- 
chology being as remote from human control as certain truths 
of astronomy, There is now in process of slow formation, 
within the science of education, » scienve of education values. 
So far, its previsions are mainly qualitative, but even with 
this limitation a rational science of teaching is dependent 
on a determination of these values. 
Modern pedagogy assumes too large a difference between the 
mind of the child and the mind of the adult, The difference 
is in degree, rather than in d. When the child of six 
enters school he represents all the modes of mental activity 
that are manifested by the adult; and it is safer and better to 
infer the essential elements of child mind from the known 
elements of adult mind than to rediscover them by experiment 
in the modern ‘‘ psychological !aboratory.’”’ 
  Education is a conservative art, and progress in this art 
should take place by evolution rather than by revolution. 
Perhaps the term progressive conservatism best indicates the 
ideal attitude of the wise teacher. The tonic effect of histori- 
cal study is conservative; and a wholesome check to educa- 
tional fads and vagaries would pe a patient study of the 
history of education.

PREFACE 
Teaching is a beneficent vocation and the highest motive of 
the teacher is the love of doing good. To be humane in spirit 
and benevolent in act is to possess the highest qualifications 
for the vocation of teaching. The basis of good order and 
wholesome discipline is the respect and affection which the 
young have for their benefactors. 
A sense of superiority and a pride of authority have often 
alienated the student body from the teaching body, and have 
fostered antagonisms detrimental to peace and good order. A 
scrupulous respect for the rights and feelings of students 
should be a first principle in the art of school management. 
As a school is an organization, there must be a certain 
amount of mechanism in school administration; but when a 
love for the mechanical has become the prevalent spirit, the 
higher life of the school will be destroyed. Where masses of 
childrea are to be taught by a comparativaly small number of 
teachers, too much reliance is placed on the mechanics of 
school administration, and there is many a school system, 
highly organized as a machine, which provokes the inquiry: 
Can these dry bones live ? 
The low state of educational science is indicated by the fact 
that writers who speak with authority have invented a fiction 
they call Nature, and then, by a curious illusion, have pro- 
ceeded to build on it as though it were a fact, thus confusing 
science with mythology.

THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
Tue history of normal schools shows that their 
original purpose was merely to extend the scholarship 
of those students who intended to become teachers, 
the theory being that fitness for teaching consisted in 
the possession of more than the average amount of 
learning. This had been the conception held by the 
ancient universities, which were teachers’ seminaries, 
whose students, obliged to teach as a condition of 
graduation, bound themselves to teach for a specified 
time after graduation. It is easy to see how this 
thought would naturally be transferred to the people’s 
schools at the time when the Reformation had made 
it necessary that every child should be educated. 
This new movement required the sudden creation of 
an army of teachers who were to be improvised, so 
to speak, by selecting the brighter pupils in the 
schools and giving them a more thorough and a more 
extended knowledge of subjects. 
The next movement in normal instruction might 
have been anticipated. It would necessarily happen 
 
-P-A-G-E-12
  12 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
that teachers having good scholarship would some- 
times fail, while other teachers, though having poorer 
scholarship, would meet with surprising success; and 
it was an easy inference that method was another 
element in a teacher’s professional outfit almost c6- 
ordinate with scholarship. Pestalozzi was an illus- 
trious example of the fact that a man of very limited 
learning may nevertheless become a great teacher. 
He had such sovereign confidence in method as dis- 
tinguished from scholarship that he believed a text- 
book constructed according to his method would 
enable an illiterate man or woman to become a good 
teacher. His dream was to make education universal. 
To this end he would make of every home a school, 
and of every mother a teacher; and to the obvious 
objection that these mothers were too ignorant to teach, 
he replied that, armed with his method, ignorance 
was no bar to home instruction. Jacotot also aimed 
at universal instruction, and in answer to the objec- 
tion that it was not possible to supply the requisite 
number of teachers, owing to the prevailing ignor- 
ance, he resorted to his famous paradox: Onn oan 
TEACH WHAT HE DOES NOT KNOW. 
Following what may be called the Pestalozzian 
movement in education method became the dominant
-P-A-G-E-13
THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 13 
feature in normal instruction, and scholarship was 
relegated to a subordinate place. 
The next movement might also have been antici- 
pated. The brilliant success of Pestalozzi brought 
forth a lusty crop of competitors and rivals. As it 
was by his ‘‘ method’? that Pestalozzi had triumphed, 
each contestant felt obliged to exploit his own method 
in order to make a stand against the reigning craze, 
just as in these latter days each ambitious educator 
must exploit his fad in order to compete on even 
terms with his brethren who are exploiting their fads. 
Method was thus pitted against method, and it could 
not fail to happen that each innovator would finally 
be forced to defend his hobby by pleading some doc- 
trine or principle as its basis and final justification. 
The center of debate has thus been transferred to the 
field of science where the final stand must be made, 
and here the contest is waxing warmer and warmer. 
One educator invokes the name of Spencer, another 
of Freebel, and another of Herbart. Each is appa- 
rently deaf to the merits of every system of educa- 
tional philosophy save his own, holding that his 
prophet has delivered the final message to the world. 
It results from this brief historical statement that 
experience has developed three main factors in the
-P-A-G-E-14
  14 THE EDUCATION OF\ TEACHERS 
professional education of teachers : scholarship, method 
and doctrine. Under scholarship is included little more 
than a thorough knowledge of the subjects included in 
the ordinary school course. By a sort of forecast it is 
determined what subjects a student may be called on 
to teach; these he is made to master with great thor- 
oughness, and with the ever present thought that they 
are to be the instruments of his calling, and that their 
chief value lies in their instrumental use. The nar- 
rowing effect of this mode of study is still further in- 
tensified by the student’s preoccupation with method. 
Much of the working power of his mind is absorbed 
in the effort to answer the ever recurring question : 
‘“‘How shall I present this subject to my class??? 
Insistence on technique reaches its culmination in the 
practice school when the student, in a class not his 
own, and in the face of perfunctory critics, is made 
to exemplify the methods that have been prescribed 
by the teacher in charge of this branch of the pro- 
fessional work. Iam far from saying that this ques- 
tion of method is unimportant. My only purpose in 
this place is to show that under the conditions named 
the attainment of real scholarship becomes impossible. 
Perhaps liberal learning is not desirable as a qualifica- 
tion for the teaching office, That may be an open
-P-A-G-E-15
THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 15 
question; but if it be considered a condition essential 
to high success in the teacher’s vocation, it must be 
secured under different conditions. In the pursuit of 
liberal learning, or culture proper, the mind must 
work in an air of freedom, and must be absorbed in 
the subject itself, and not in the utilities that it may 
be made to serve. What Plato says of the study of 
arithmetic is true of every study that is to enter into 
a liberal education: ‘‘ Not cultivating it with a view 
to buying and selling, as merchants and shopkeepers, 
but for purposes of war, and to facilitate the conver- 
sion of the soul itself from the changeable to the true 
and the real.’’ 
I shall now venture to speak of scholarship, method 
and doctrine, or science, in what seems to me to be 
the sequence of their importance, and shall try to give 
in outline my conception of the attainments, general 
and professional, which constitute real fitness for the 
teaching office. : 
It is a flagrant misuse of the term scholarship to 
limit its content to the branches of study included in 
the ordinary normal school course, or even in a college 
course. Scholarship includes spirit as well as matter, 
an attitude of mind and disposition of soul, as well as 
the knowledge communicated in class rooms. Many 
 
-P-A-G-E-16
  16 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
a man has been graduated from college and university 
without in any true sense becoming a scholar; while 
many a man has brought from the high school, and 
even from the farm and the shop, the essential spirit 
and some of the literary attainments of the genuine 
scholar. In respect of knowledge, scholarship implies 
breadth, perspective, a lifting of the intellectual hori- 
zon, making of the man ‘‘the spectator of all time 
and all existence’’; and in respect of spirit, it implies 
delicacy of taste, a tempered imagination, and that 
awakened zeal in learning which makes the man 
‘curious to learn and never satisfied.’? The scholar 
must advance far enough in the literary life to reach 
that state which Macaulay calls ‘‘ intellectual emanci- 
pation,’’ that consciousness of power and that poise 
of judgment which, in the realm of thinking, makes 
the man ‘‘a law unto himself’? in the formation of 
his own opinions. A sense of mastery and power, a 
free flight of the liberated spirit, an abiding pleasure 
in intellectual pursuits, a conscious participation by 
the individual in the moral life of the race, these are 
some of the marks of the scholarly vocation. The 
study that does not lead up to these high endowments 
misses its supreme prerogative. It is not to be ex- 
pected that even under the best conditions a student
-P-A-G-E-17
    
THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 17 
will manifest in any full measure the spirit of the 
scholar while his studies are in progress; but it is to 
be expected that the conditions under which he studies 
should be favorable to the growth of this spirit, and 
that as he enters more and more fully into the benefi- 
cent school of experience, riper and more abundant 
fruits will be gathered from the seeds of this early 
planting. 
It is very certain that students who are pursuing 
their studies under the galling stress of official and 
officious criticism, and are constrained to ask at each 
step of their progress, ‘‘ what utility can I draw out 
of this,’’ are working under conditions that are hostile 
to the rise and growth of the scholarly spirit. An 
atmosphere of freedom should pervade every school. 
Every course of study, however elementary, should be 
liberal in its spirit and purpose. Studies should be 
learned for their own sake, and not with reference to 
the utilities that they may be made to serve; for 
‘*they teach not their own use, but that is a wisdom 
without them and above them, won by observation.’’ 
The more perfect the form and manner in which a 
study is learned, the greater will be its utilities when 
experience calls for them; and it is no paradox to say 
that this form and manner will be most perfect when 
z
-P-A-G-E-18
18 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
the study is learned without the least reference to its 
future utilities. A divine admonition warns us against 
‘disquieting ourselves concerning the three great wants 
of the physical life—food, drink and raiment, and 
directs us first of all to make sure of that which 
includes them all, the Kingdom of God, that perfect 
state of soul which is righteousness and peace and joy. 
This sharp insistence on the technical and the prac- 
tical, which I think has wrought such harm in the 
education of teachers, has resulted from a false con- 
ception of the teacher’s art, which degrades it into 
a handicraft or trade with rules as rigid as those of 
the mason and the carpenter. Teaching is a spiritual 
act or art in which mind comes into mysterious and 
quickening contact with mind, soul with soul, heart 
with heart, life with life. Analogies drawn from our 
dealings with matter utterly fail us when we come to 
deal with spirit. We are not dealing with uniform 
material and fixed dimensions, but with all the varia- 
tions and diversities of impalpable spirit. The pro- 
ducts of our art are not uniform, but multiform, and 
our processes must needs be so variable that we cannot 
follow rules, but must be guided by principles. We 
are not working in that sphere of activity where two 
times two is four, but where two times two is often 
 
-P-A-G-E-19

ten. In its highest aspect, teaching is a process of 
provocation, or induction, whereby a free and impress- 
ible spirit takes on moral and scholarly qualities by 
near presence to a soul highly charged with moral and 
scholarly qualities. What better advice can be given 
toa teacher than this: ‘‘Become addicted to the schol- 
arly vocation until you are possessed by the scholarly 
spirit; charge yourself highly with benevolence, and 
be kindly affectioned towards those whom you would 
guide and teach; make large investments in yourself, 
to the end that you may become ‘noble and gracious, 
the friend of truth, justice, courage, temperance?’ ’’ 
The studies whose special value lies in the fact 
that they are catholic, or breadth-giving, are geogra- 
phy, history and literature; hence the teacher who 
would endow himself with a proper frame or attitude 
of mind should addict himself in an especial manner 
to these three subjects. 
In geography the central thought is the fact that 
the earth is the home or dwelling place of the human 
race. From this point of view geography becomes a 
humane or culture subject of the first quality, and the 
effect of this study is to make the student cosmopolitan 
and catholic, tolerant and beneficent. 
The charm and value of history lie in its delinea-

tions of national life, its record of the strugg.es en- 
dured by the race and the steps taken in its upward 
and onward progress. In its pages we witness the 
slow and painful evolution of human liberty and the 
gradual development of the moral and intellectual 
life. Seeing the struggles and sorrows of the race, 
we are brought into sympathetic relations with the 
human family and are prepared to do service towards | 
the betterment of the world. 
Literature brings us into special and intimate rela- 
tions with the very heart, mind and life of the race 
through its choicest spirits and noblest representatives. | 
The highest attainments of the race in thought and 
feeling, its highest, purest aspirations and ideals be- 
| come our heritage and endowment through the reading 
and mastery of good books. Virtue becomes capitalized 
in the literature of the race, so that in the moral life 
we may start with the attainments made by the better 
spirits of our age. These three humane studies give 
us poise, vision, and tempered zeal, and so prepare us 
to deal intelligently with the problems of human 
education. 
The best defence for the general study of the phy-   sical sciences is not their practical utility which ac- 
  erues to the race through specialists; but their culture i

  THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS a1 
value, as they enable the mind to interpret the cosmos, 
to unravel the mysteries of our physical environment. 
As they deal with matter and not with life, and par- 
ticularly not with human life, they cannot be classed 
with geography, history and literature as humane 
studies; but as they deal with general causes and 
reach large generalizations they give the mind a firm 
grasp on details, explain phenomena and make the 
cosmos intelligible. Their study greatly increases the 
comprehensive power of the human mind and gives a 
comfortable sense of mastery over infinite details. For 
the great mass of men these studies serve, not for 
ability, but for delight. We need to know astronomy, 
not that we may draw utilities from the stars, but that 
we may be made worshipful and reverent. 
The biological sciences have the same defense. 
Human physiology, seemingly the most practical of 
them all, is best defended on the ground that it ex- 
plains the curious mechanism of the living human 
body. Save in the limited domain of hygiene, a 
knowledge of physiology is only indirectly useful to 
the mass of men. In the main there is the same 
reason for knowing the structure of the human body 
as for knowing the structure of a steam engine; the 
knowledge resolves a mystery :—-we can comprehend
-P-A-G-E-22
22 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
a wonderful piece of mechanism. It is a debatable 
question whether, on the whole, a knowledge of phy- 
siology is conducive to the health and happiness of the 
laity. If we could tamper with the mind as we can 
with the body, who can doubt that a knowledge of 
psychology might be harmful rather than helpful? 
Whether a physician’s knowledge of his own body is 
conducive to his health and happiness is doubtful; 
indeed the contrary may be maintained with much 
show of reason. 
The teacher’s interest in psychology is twofold It 
is a prime culture subject in the sense that it enables 
him to comprehend the world within, the world of 
spirit; and its main principles are readily convertible 
into rules for guidance, teaching being in the main an 
applied psychology, just as medicine is an applied 
physiology. To serve these purposes in a high degree 
psychology should be a positive science, dealing with 
the actual facts of the spiritual life, and not a specu- 
lative science dealing with mere hypothesis and cloth- 
ing the treatment in congenial obscurity. It should 
represent in a natural sequence the series of processes 
through which the mind passes while engaged in the 
art of learning; motive, will, attention, acquisition, 
retention, representation and elaboration. Studied 
 
-P-A-G-E-23
  THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 23 
from this point of view, psychology has the same con- 
crete, attractive interest for the teacher that physiology 
has for the physician. The main facts and laws of 
the spiritual life are as plain and as easy of compre- 
hension as the main facts and laws of the physical 
life. 
The teacher should aspire to know something about 
art, if not in the way of execution, at least in the way 
of appreciation; just as he may be addicted to poetry 
and music without being either a poet or a musician. 
From the noble creations of architecture, sculpture 
and painting, he should find contemplative delight 
and refreshment of spirit, and gain delicacy of taste 
and some power of esthetic discernment. Such ex- 
travagance of beauty as there is in the world of form 
and color is not without some high purpose and should 
not fail to yield some high uses. To this end there 
must be some development and training of the es- 
thetie sense, which is the mission of art. Alike in 
literature and in art the aim of the student should not 
be criticism, but appreciation. To pose as a critic 
before the masterpieces of literature, architecture, 
sculpture and painting is ridiculous. The only be- 
coming attitude for the mass of intelligent men is 
appreciation, enjoyment. What a sorry business to
-P-A-G-E-24
  24 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
sit in judgment on Wordsworth, Wren, Canova, and 
Turner! But what a privilege and delight to enter 
somewhat into the beautiful world which these masters 
have created for us! 
Under scholarship there should be included a knowl- 
edge of what we may call the major educational classics 
of the world. It is almost a liberal education to be 
well versed in this literature; for it is literature in the 
best sense of the term which De Quincey calls ‘‘ the 
literature of power.’’ Much of the so called educa- 
tional literature of these days is not of this rank, but 
would, by comparison, classify more appropriately 
with cookbooks and gazetteers. 
It is hardly possible to overestimate the value of the 
history of education. In all ages of the world the 
wisest and the best men of their time have devoted 
themselves to the betterment of the race through pro- 
cesses and systems of education, and the record of 
these great humane movements, showing how the art 
of education has been perfected through successive 
failures and successes, is certainly the most instructive 
page of human history. The great need of teachers 
is vision, broad and accurate 58 discriminating outlook 
upon the drama of existence as it portrays the strug- 
gles of the race upwards towards the light. Each
-P-A-G-E-25
THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 25 
age of the world has verified Plato’s Allegory of the 
Cavern. The race has been saved by a remnant, but 
the consoling fact is that this remnant has grown 
steadily larger, and we may hope that finally all men 
will turn their faces to the light, and that the cavern 
of ignorance and bigotry will become tenantless. A 
just historical perspective will make us optimistic, will 
give us poise, will make us courageous, and will arm 
us with the moral power and resolution of the race. 
In one of his moments of inspiration Rousseau ex- 
claimed, ‘‘ A teacher! What a noble soul he ought 
to be!’’ To teachers of this sort, to teachers worthy 
of the name, the kindly light coming from the history 
of education is worth a whole library of ‘‘devices.’’ 
Rightly conceived and rightly taught, this is a culture 
subject of the highest type, while at the same time its 
practical bearings are of hourly value. A certain 
style of school building, once in vogue, was con- 
demned and abandoned fifty years ago by the wisest 
school men of the country; but strange to say this 
abandoned plan is still copied in expensive structures 
to the discomfort of pupils and the waste of public 
funds. Without a knowledge of the successes and 
failures in school administration, it is easy to miss 
what is best in current practice, and quite possible to 
 
-P-A-G-E-26
  26 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
rediscover abandoned systems and methods. A con: 
stitutional cure for fads would be the historical spec- 
tacle of the wrecks and ruins thickly strewn along the 
path of educational experiment; for all along the ages 
education has been experimental science, and what 
remains in the best current practice is the survival of 
the fittest, the small residue out of many ambitious 
systems and projects. When one becomes enamored 
of a fad, it would be a wholesome caution to recall 
De Witt Clinton’s premature apotheosis of Lancaster 
and Bell. Both for culture and for guidance, a 
teacher should be ‘‘ the spectator of all time’? in the 
field of educational history. 
In respect of scholarship in the narrower sense of 
the term, in a knowledge of the subjects to be taught, 
the normal schools supported by the State have always 
been true to the best traditions. They have uniformly 
aimed at thoroughness and have never disgraced sound 
learning by a profitable resort to expeditious methods. 
No risk is incurred in declaring that in the high and 
legitimate sense of the term the college and the uni- 
versity of the future will be of the normal type; that 
is, their avowed purpose will be to educate men and 
women, not to be mainly useful to themselves and 
their families by the gathering of wealth and renown,
-P-A-G-E-27

but to become living factors in the education of the 
race. Education is becoming more and more an ethnic 
problem; the conception is growing that the supreme 
aim of living in this world is the perfection of the 
race; that in an active and real sense all men and 
women must become educators; and that the main 
and particular purpose of the higher institutions of 
learning is to prepare students for the work of elevat- 
ing and perfecting the race. Perhaps in an uncon- 
scious way the universities of the age are now moving 
towards this larger conception. The chairs of educa- 
tion established in so many of them serve a high pur- 
pose for the general student, as well as a special 
purpose for the student who expects to teach. It will 
ultimately appear that their largest following will be 
from students who are in quest of a liberal education. 
In other words, it can hardly be doubted that the uni- 
versity of the future will be modeled after the con- 
ception so happily expressed by Herbert Spencer: 
“The subject which involves all other subjects, and 
therefore the subject in which the education of every 
one should culminate, is the Theory and Practice of 
Education.” 
It will be the aim of the student, through religion, 
through history, through literature, through science,
-P-A-G-E-28
  28 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
to epitomize and embody in himself the net attain- 
ments of the race in virtue, in discipline, in learning, 
in culture, and all to the end that he may be'an agent 
in the education and perfection of human society. 
The golden age of the world is to be the age that is 
most wisely and wholly devoted to the betterment of 
humanity; in that age all men and all women will be 
either teachers or educators, and all schools will be 
avowedly normal in spirit and purpose. 
‘And the law giver will appoint guardians: some 
who walk by intelligence, and others by true opinion 
only.’? In this quotation Plato marks the distinction 
between guidance that proceeds from the interpreta- 
tion of a principle, and guidance that proceeds from 
the application of a rule. As teaching has to do with 
spirit, and as spirit is multiform in the modes of its 
operation, education is a free or liberal art whose 
practice requires that versatility which springs from a 
broad intelligence and from a comprehensive knowl- 
edge of general principles. It cannot be too often 
repeated that teaching bears no likeness to the me- 
chanic arts where rigid rules and exact measurements 
are required. It is even doubtful whether procedure 
by fixed rule is ever permissible in real teaching.
-P-A-G-E-29
  THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 29 
In our dealings with spirit all analogies drawn from 
the manipulations of matter'are full of mischief. 
In all the arts that deal with the imponderable, the 
free or liberal arts, procedure by fixed rule is impossi- 
ble; the utmost and the best that can be done in the way 
of preparation for the practice of these arts is a clear 
comprehension of general principles. A school that 
should propose to teach the art of statesmanship 
would be laughed out of existence in a month. 
Neither journalism, oratory, nor literature, can be 
* taught as an art, as a system of processes. Each man 
must construct his own art out of his fund of intelli- 
gence and out of the special requirements of time, 
place, and circumstance. In medicine, no one but a 
  follows a fixed rule of practice. In his college 
the physician learns the science of medicine and out 
of general principles he draws his art, in each case 
modifying his practice to suit temperament, age and 
sex. He will have as many arts as he has patients. 
In the practice of the law the same thing is true. In 
the law school the student learns a science, and when 
he comes to practice he will have as many arts as he 
has cases. In the practice of teaching the relation of 
art to science is the same as in the instances just cited. 
In his professional school the teacher should learn a
-P-A-G-E-30
  30 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
science, out of which, on the occasion of experience, 
he should construct his art. The texture and character 
of this art will depend on the net personality of the 
teacher, on the quality of the science he has learned, 
on the character and disposition of his pupils, and even 
on the environment of his school; so that there will 
be as many arts of teaching as there are teachers, even 
as many as there are pupils. 
Whether a science can be turned into a successful art 
will of course depend in the main on the intelligence 
of the teacher. Some men cannot learn a science, 
and some men, having learned a science, are incompe- 
tent to convert it into an art. We may suppose that 
many teachers stand in this case. What are they to 
do? Manifestly if one is stupid and must teach, he 
will do better with rules than he could do without 
them; but such a man has mistaken his calling; he 
should be drawing water or hewing wood. <A turn 
of the political wheel may put a stupid man in a posi- 
tion where statesmanship is required, and if he must 
act, it will be better for him to follow a blind rule 
than to follow his mere caprices or guesses; but such 
a man has no call to play at statesmanship; he should 
follow some vocation compatible with his stupidity. 
In order to be readily convertible into an art, a
-P-A-G-E-31
THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 31 
science should not be composed of ultimate principles, 
but of what logicians call aatomata media, or middle 
principles, that stand between the broadest generaliza- 
tion and the narrower empirical rules. To say that 
education is life may in some occult or metaphysical 
sense be true, but it is a formula so void of meaning, 
so remote from experience, that it is a mere philo- 
sophie or poetic ornament; it can be converted into 
no utility. Psychology readily shades off into meta- 
physies, or the search for ultimate causes, and finally 
loses itself in that region of obscurity which is so con- 
genial to speculative minds. When psychology has 
reached that state it is worthless for a teacher’s use. 
Asa teacher must himself be sane, his science must 
be sane also. Muddiness is often mistaken for depth. 
A statement may be profound, yet clear. Any state- 
ment that is not clear, that cannot be interpreted by 
the intelligence, should be cancelled from the teacher’s 
science. 
Education is a derived or composite science drawing 
its matter chiefly from religion, ethics, sociology, psy- 
chology and logic. Teaching, for the most part, is 
an applied psychology and logic, but education derives 
its inspiration and aim from the other sciences named. 
In one very important department, as yet without a
-P-A-G-E-32
32 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
name, the science of education has matter all its own, 
matter not derived from any other science. It is that 
department which discusses and determines the educa- 
tion value of studies. The discussion of these values 
is as old as Plato’s philosophy and as new as Herbert 
Spencer’s, while between come contributions from 
Rabelais, Montaigne, Locke, Bacon, Hamilton, Whe- 
well, and Bain. Ultimately we shall have within the 
great science itself a science of values, a sort of materia 
medica of the teaching art, and until this step has been 
taken it is difficult to see how any further rational pro- 
gress can be made in the art of human education. It 
is just as important for a teacher to know the education 
value of literature as for a physician to know the thera- 
peutic value of quinine. Under the conception that 
education is a process of growth taking place through 
nurture and exercise, studies become foods and disci- 
plines, and to prescribe them wisely one needs to know 
their several values. 
Method may be defined as a mode of procedure 
based on some principle or law. Divorced from the 
principle which justifies it, a method becomes a rule, 
and rules are the bane of teaching. This statement 
will make clear the objection that has been urged 
against the practice current in many normal schools of 
  on
-P-A-G-E-33
  THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 33 
making the main part of its professional instruction 
consist of methods and devices to the neglect of schol- 
arship and science. Freedom, versatility, ‘variety, 
adaptation, are pedagogic virtues of the first order; 
but there is no freedom in mere method, in method 
isolated from the principle that underlies it. Freedom 
is to be found in some large truth, in some principle 
that includes many instances and so suggests many 
applications. The science of mechanics comprises 
only one or two general principles, but these princi- 
ples include an infinite number of instances and so 
admit of a countless number of applications. It has 
been well said that nothing is so uniformt as ignorance. 
The uniformities of rule invariably lead to routine, 
and routine destroys the life of teaching. The only 
uniformity that can be desired in method is typical 
uniformity, that is, likeness to a type or class, and not 
to an individual of aclass. The general principle that 
‘perception begins with masses and then descends to 
parts, gives rise to that method in reading which pre- 
sents words before letters, or sentences before words; 
but twenty good teachers of reading may follow this 
general principle and each may introduce into her 
practice some modification or variety that will make 
twenty methods in the aggregate, but they will all be 
3 
   
-P-A-G-E-34
  34 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
correct methods because they all conform to one ra- 
tional type. In a company of ladies there may be a 
hundred costumes, each reflecting the taste and per- 
sonality of the individual wearer, but all conforming 
to one type or style. Even so every real teacher will 
introduce into her methods something of her own per- 
sonality, but at the same time they will agree in type 
with the methods of other teachers who follow the 
same general principle. 
Whether a teacher’s metinods shall be inspiring and 
creative, or obstructive and deadening, will depend 
on whether, to borrow Carlyle’s imagery, he is a live 
coal, or a dead cinder; and it is necessary to be kept 
in mind that in some way a student must be trans- 
formed into a quickening spirit before he can become 
areal teacher. In aschool devoted to the education 
of teachers there must be a prevalent spirit provoca- 
tive of high moral aims, devotion to duty and love 
of the scholarly vocation. This spirit should be so 
prevalent and so tonic as to form the vital breath of 
every learner; it should proceed, not from one in- 
structor, but from all; and it should be so effective 
that it can be felt as a living, vitalizing power where- 
ever students congregate—in chapel, in classrooms, in 
lecture halls,.in art rooms, in library, everywhere.
-P-A-G-E-35
  
THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 35 
By virtue of this indefinable but real spirit some 
schools predispose their students to scholarly habits, to 
sobriety and refinement of manners, to beneficent pur- 
poses, to noble ambitions; and this spiritual tuition is 
infinitely better than mere drill, learning, or method, 
and must certainly accompany them if education is to 
be a transforming and perfecting power. If the term 
enthusiasm had not lost its primitive and noble mean- 
ing it might suffice to say that all real teaching must 
be pervaded by enthusiasm; but it is now better to 
say that all real teachers must be inspired, in the same 
sense that biblical teachers and prophets were inspired ; 
that education will fall sadly short of its transforming 
and creative power unless it is accompanied by a cer- 
tain noble ardor and elevation of spirit, unless it affects 
the noble passions and emotions of the learner. Edu- 
cation is shorn of more than half its power when it is 
addressed to the head to the exclusion of the heart. 
An educated man is not a mere intellectual gymnast 
with a large endowment of solid learning, but a man 
whose emotional and intellectual powers have been 
duly trained and brought into just equipoise; a man 
who can not only think, reason and discern, but can 
love, admire and worship; who can recognize beauty 
as well as truth, whose highest motives are feelings
-P-A-G-E-36
  36 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
tempered with reason. It is in such an atmosphere as 
this that a teacher should be educated. Nothing less 
stimulating will serve the noble purpose of his calling. 
In the way of facilities for instruction in science, 
literature and art, the best is not good enough for a 
school whose high mission is the education of teachers. 
A good laboratory, a good library and a good art gal- 
lery should therefore be thought indispensable adjuncts 
to a normal school. The world of matter is to be 
interpreted, the world of letters is to renew the morai , 
life, the world of beauty is to be revealed and ad- 
mired, and unless these three worlds make large con- 
tributions to the teacher’s equipment he has not made 
the investments which become his high office. 
While, through delicacy of feeling and breadth of 
intellectual vision, a teacher should be responsive to 
the spirit of his age, he should be wisely conservative 
in his opinions and policy:. In no other department 
of human activity should the maxim nihil per saltum 
be so rigorously construed. Both as a process and a 
policy education is a growth, and the margin between 
the work of today and the attempt of to-morrow 
should be a narrow one. What we now have in theory 
and practice is the net product of the best thought 
and truest effort of the past; that it is radically wrong  
-P-A-G-E-37
  THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 37 
is inconceivable. Education should be progressive, but 
this progress should: be along historical lines. The 
future should be a logical evolution out of the past 
and the present. In this domain revolution is treason. 
To be swayed about by every wind of doctrine is the 
mark of an unsound mind. To be absorbed in new 
and doubtful experiments is to betray a sacred trust. 
Innocent children should be shielded from the experi- 
ments of callow teachers who would use them as 
material for their ‘‘laboratories.’’ It is appalling to 
think that the normal schools of the country should 
send out into society relays of half educated teachers 
devoted to the exploitation of fads, and bent on revo- 
lution under the name of progress. The policy of 
such schools should be a progressive conservatism. 
They should encourage a hearty respect for the past 
and its legacies, and should at the same time create an 
aspiration for a better future. ‘*All the centuries of a 
nation are the leaves of one and the same book. The 
true men of progress are they who have for point 
of departure a profound respect for the past. All 
that we do, all that we are, is the outcome of secular 
oni.

peaceful transformation which is to end, we may 
believe, in a state of society that is perfect in its kind. 
This process of transformation is education in its 
catholic and proper sense. Those who are charged 
with this supreme mission are the world’s teachers; 
to be fit for this high service their own education 
must be catholic, wholesome and conservative.

I mp a fitting introduction to what I wish to say 
in this chapter, in the following quotation from an 
editorial in the Wew York Tribune, on the then re- 
cent death of Professor Lincoln, of Brown University : 
‘¢ Professor Lincoln, who was buried in Providence 
yesterday, after half a century of active service in 
Brown University, received during his closing years 
2 unique testimonial of the affection and respect of his 
pupils. A fund of $100,000 was raised by the alumni 
of the college, from which he was to draw an annuity 
while he lived, and which was to be a standing memo- 
rial of his work. It was a remarkable tribute paid to 
one of the really great educators of New England, 
and attested the personal appreciation of a large body 
of students who had drawn inspiration from his no- 
bility of character, his devotion to good letters and 
his thoroughness and enlightened methods as a teacher. 
Many college professors there are who do faithful work 
in their time, and here and there will be one whose 
memory will be perpetuated after death by the endow-

ment of a new chair, or the naming of an additional 
building on the campus; but it is almost an unprece- 
dented thing for a body of alumni representing the 
graduating classes of fifty years to unite with enthusi- 
asm in providing the memorial in the honored old age 
of the teacher. 
‘‘The glory of the medieval universities was trans- 
sitory, their reputation and popularity depending upon 
great teachers who rallied throngs of students around 
them. One man would make a school of learning 
famous, and while he lived and taught, the lecture 
halls would be crowded with sympathetic youths 
touched by the fire of his earnestness. When he died 
the university would languish and a rival school with 
another great teacher would draw upon its resources. 
Modern colleges are educational machines with too 
many cogs and wheels to receive the impulse of a 
single will. One man cannot now make a university 
as in medieval times; but an educator of noble im- 
pulses and an overmastering love of what is immortal 
in literature can still be a tremendous force in mflu- 
encing the labors of colleagues and in directing and 
quickening the aspirations of students. What Arnold 
was at Rugby, Lincoln was at Brown, during bis half- 
century of laborious service. Every associate in ad-  
-P-A-G-E-43
WHOLESOME CULTURE 43 
joining class rooms felt the stimulus of his enthusiasm 
for study, and was sobered by his sense of responsi- 
bility in training young men for useful work in the 
world. Every student breathed in his lecture room a 
higher atmosphere than could be found anywhere else. 
There was no force in the old college of Roger Wil- 
liams’ state so ennobling and so invigorating as the 
example and influence of this warm-hearted and full- 
minded Latin professor. 
‘« Educators, as the world grows older, seem to ac- 
quire technique and finish without gaining creative or 
informing power. There is perfection of system and 
elaboration of method, but how rare it is to find in 
school or in college, teachers of the type of Arnold 
and Lincoln endowed with the incomparable gift of 
inspiring enthusiasm for learning and good letters! 
To read Horace’s ‘‘Ars Poetica’’ or Geethe’s ‘‘Faust’’ 
under Lincoln was something more than to master the 
grammatical difficulties of a language. It was, in 
Byron’s phrase, ‘‘to feel, not understand the lyric 
flow,’’ to study not the mechanism, but the spirit of a 
literature, and to be conscious of coming into close 
communion with intellectual genius. The graduates 
of the classes in University Hall may have forgotten 
their rules of Latin syntax and prosody and have mis-

laid their German accent; but whatever ardor thev 
may retain for orderly processes of study or whatever 
love they may have for what is ennobling in literature, 
bears the impress of the hand and heart of Lincoin.”” 
What I admire in this quotation is the thought that 
the power of a teacher lies in his worth as a man 
rather than in his skill as a drillmaster, and that his 
title to a grateful remembrance will at last be found 
in those services which were inspired by sympathy and 
affection, rather than in the conscious additions which 
have been made to the pupil’s knowledge. At least 
the half, and perhaps the better half, of education 
consists in the formation of right feelings. The great 
mobiles to action are the emotions.. He who teaches 
us to look out upon the world through eyes of affec- 
tion, sympathy, charity and good will, has done more 
for us and for society than he who may have taught 
us the seven liberal arts. Good teaching, like good 
preaching or good oratory, must be persuasive. It 
not only sets forth truth in a clearer light, but will 
invest truth with a warm halo of feeling. 
The school should be strong in the affections of its 
students. After they have left it their thoughts ought 
to turn back to the scenes of their school life, to places, 
persons and associations, with that fondness, affection,
-P-A-G-E-45
  WHOLESOME CULTURE 45 
and reverence which children ever feel for the homes 
of their childhood. The young Alexander loved 
Philip, his father, but Aristotle, his teacher, was even 
dearer to him. The most affecting incident in ‘‘Tom 
Brown at Rugby”’ is the boy’s return to the old 
Chapel, and there alone and in silence, his heart heav- 
ing with emotion, kneeling at the tomb of the beloved 
Doctor. The attachments which a student feels for 
his Alma Mater are emotional, not intellectual ;. they 
relate, not to what he has learned, but to what he has 
felt. I have seen gray-haired men return to their 
university after years of absence; but the places they 
visited, the places to which they are attached, are not 
the lecture rooms, but the old trees under whose shade 
they once lounged and chatted, and the playgrounds 
which once witnessed the friendly ardor of their 
boyish encounters; and the names which they most 
fondly call up are not those of their drillmasters but 
of those whom they learned to love for their good 
offices and amiable qualities. The heart of Mary 
Lyon has immortalized Mount Holyoke, and to-day 
her beautiful spirit is reflected from the faces of 
thousands who are reproducing her devotion and 
good works. At intervals during my professional life 
I have met gray-haired men and women who were 3

students of the Albany Normal School in the days of 
its greatest glory, and in the heart of each there was 
a shrine sacred to the memory of David Page, and the 
immortality of this great teacher is due, not to his 
intellect, great as it was, and not to his methods, good 
as they were, but to the humanity, to the heart, that 
was in him. The world is to be redeemed, not by 
change of intellect, but by change of heart; the real 
leaven of society is charity and good will, not logic, 
not even liberty and justice. If students are to put 
this better spirit into the world they must put it into 
their work; if it goes into their work it must come 
from their lives, and their lives must borrow it from 
other lives that have been touched and transformed 
by it. 
‘We have all heard music that was wonderful in 
technique, but void of soul. It exhibited the com- 
pass and power of the instrument, and the trained 
deftness of eye and finger, but as it did not proceed 
from the heart it did not touch the heart. It was not 
music, but noise scientifically and laboriously produced. 
The intellect, while ‘‘a cold logical engine,’’ may dis- 
cover truth, but only an intellect warmed by the heart 
can make truth lovable and therefore persuasive and 
conquering. There is something to admire in the cold
-P-A-G-E-47
  
WHOLESOME CULTURE 47 
exactness with which truth is proclaimed from the ros- 
trum, but if this truth is not mixed in due proportion 
with feeling, there can be no real oratory, for there 
can be no persuasion. 
Goldsmith described the good village preacher as 
one who ‘‘lured to brighter worlds and led the way”? ; 
with scarcely a turn in the thought this is a happy de- 
scription of the good teacher. It was Plato who said 
that ‘‘we do not readily learn from a teacher whom, 
we do not love’’; and it is certain that all the great \ 
teachers of the world have been men of humane | 
instincts, of warm sympathies and ardent affections, 
and have owed their immortality quite as much to a | \ 
responsive heart as to a sound head. It is a sad day 
for education when the belief prevails that it is only 
the head which should enter into the service of the 
teacher, and that a deep emotional nature is a source 
of weakness rather than of strength. Other things 
being equal, he is the best teacher to whom pupils 
most readily turn for consolation and direction in 
sorrow or misfortune. There is something gravely 
wrong in that teacher, whether man or woman, who 
gains no other feeling in his pupil’s heart than mere 
respect.

up into fragments, to employ one set of faculties or 
activities while suffering the unused members to lan- 
guish or perish, and thus to mar the original whole- 
ness of our nature and so rob our service of its normal 
quality. It should be the whole man who preaches, 
teaches, pleads, plows, spins, or sings, and we. sin 
against our better nature and powers when we allow 
any form of specialization to destroy, or even mar, 
the beautiful wholeness or wholesomeness of our origi- 
nal creation. 
All who are engaged in school work may profitably” 
reflect on. the dangers of specialization, for the direct 
tendency is to exalt the instrument at the expense of 
the man. ‘‘ Who is that gentleman yonder ?’? said 
a traveler to a stranger whom he met on the highway. 
” “That, sir, is not a gentleman,’’ said the stranger, 
‘but a grammarian, and I am a logician.”’ 
Nothing more is intended in these remarks than te 
point out the dangers that beset every man who be- 
comes addicted to a special pursuit or to a special 
study. Every profession, trade, or calling is narrow- 
ing in its tendency and will infallibly dwarf the man 
who follows it unless he finds relief in some breadth- 
giving pursuit that is alien to his special vocation. A 
sinister consequence of this tendency when not thus
-P-A-G-E-49
WHOLESOME CULTURE 49 
checked is to betray us into false judgments concerning 
other pursuits and other branches of learning. We 
must all specialize our pursuits by the intensity of our 
devotion to them, but in some way we must make 
ourselves so catholic in our sympathies that we shall 
be able to give a hearty welcome to the favorite pur. 
suits of other men. One of my venerated colleagues 
in the University of Michigan was an acute metaphy- 
sician. While in his library one morning I observed 
that among his books were the latest and best treatises 
on physics and biology. When I expressed surprise 
at this anomaly, his quick response was: ‘‘Do you 
imagine that I am content to be merely a dried up 
metaphysician?’’ He had learned the happy art of 
reconciling breadth with depth. 
As the school proposes to train men and women—~ 
gentlemen and ladies—rather than grammarians and 
logicians, it is of the first importance that those who 
teach should be men and women in this catholic and 
wholesome sense. I feel sure that my words will not 
be misconstrued when I say that a teacher’s usefulness 
diminishes in proportion as he sinks into a mere spe- 
cialist, but that the prime quality of an instructor is 
breadth of intellectual vision and of scholarly attain- 
ments. Ihave mingled somewhat with college men 
4
-P-A-G-E-50
  50 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
and have been an observer of their opinions and ways, 
but I have only very rarely seen a specialist who had 
any respect for any specialty save his own. In the 
main most college feuds and jealousies have their 
origin in this narrowing of the intellectual perspective, 
in this contraction of the intellectual horizon; and so 
it has come to pass that seats of liberal learning are 
sometimes occupied by men of the most illiberal spirit. 
I have spoken of the extension of our sympathies 
to subjects and pursuits different from and perhaps 
remote from our own as a necessary condition for high 
service in a school; and I now wish to speak approv- 
ingly of another extension of sympathy and aims which 
is even more important. My acquaintance with col- 
leges and college men has led me to another observa- 
tion—that in many cases the instructor’s interest in the 
pupil ceases the moment the recitation period is over ; 
that the instances are rare in which students think of 
their teachers in any other light than that of drill- 
masters; and that it is only in exceptional cases that 
they are held in affectionate and grateful remembrance 
as friends, advisers and guides. I believe that this is 
the highest standard by which a school or teacher can 
be tried. 
It is well to recollect that a student does not present
-P-A-G-E-51
WHOLESOME CULTURE 51 
  himself to his several instructors in fractions, bringing 
the logical faculty into one class room, the esthetic 
into another, the reminiscent into a third, ete., but 
that all the powers of the mind are present and in 
waiting, and that it is but the semblance of teaching 
which addresses itself to but one mode of mental ac- 
tivity. It is perhaps even more important to remem- 
ber that the student brings with him his susceptibility 
of feeling as well as his capacity for thinking—that 
he can be hurt by harshness and unkindness, and 
helped by courtesy and gentle speech. The root and 
basis of character is in the heart, in the depths of the 
sensative and emotional nature; hence there is no such 
thing as character-building in teaching which does not 
address itself to the heart as well as to the head. 
It is a mistaken notion that there is something pro- 
fessional in an icy dignity, in rude speech, in uncouth 
manners, and in austere if not unkind reproof. Any- 
thing that distinguishes the teacher from the gentle- 
man or the lady is an evidence of unfitness for this 
high office; but the gentleman is first of all a gentle 
man, courteous, kind, considerate, respectful, especi- 
ally in his dealings with those who by age, position, 
or acquirement, are his inferiors, Dulta reverentia

great reverence is due the young. 
So far as equipment goes, scholarship, wide and 
thorough, must be regarded as the teacher’s mainstay ; 
he must be a man of learning if he would secure and 
hold the respect and confidence of his constituents and 
patrons, and even of his pupils, and without this re- 
spect and confidence he can maintain no professional 
standing, and is likely to abandon a calling in which 
success requires attainments that he does not possess. 
If public education is to prosper there must be a per- 
manent teaching class with well defined traditions, 
rights, prerogatives, and duties, and the members of 
this class must not only maintain their own self- 
respect, but must secure public respect; they must 
constitute one of the learned professions and as such 
must inherit and transmit all that is implied in pro- 
fessional spirit and standing. I sharply distinguish 
teachers of this class from accidental, provisional, or 
non-professional teachers, those who teach for a term 
or a year through caprice or necessity, without any 
special competency, and then pass to some regular 
employment. Money spent on such teachers is in the 
main wasted. 
The professional teacher must be not only a scholar,
-P-A-G-E-53
WHOLESOME CULTURE 53 
but also a man of science; he must understand the 
principles which underlie the practice of his art, must 
profess an educational creed, must be versed in some 
school of educational thinking, must be addicted to 
some mode of philosophizing on human nature and 
its wants. I use the term science to designate that 
special knowledge which is required for the rational 
practice of the educating art, and which distinguishes 
the teacher from the scholar, constituting what the 
logicians call the specific difference between genus and 
species, between scholar and teacher. In a quasi 
sense, a teacher’s knowledge of subjects, as of gram- 
mar, algebra, or latin, is professional knowledge, for 
he must employ it in the practice of his art, though 
in another sense it is non-professional, for in this 
respect a teacher is merely on a par with all well edu- 
cated men; but a doctrine of education, along with 
its derived methods of teaching, is professional knowl- 
edge in a legitimate sense: it is knowledge which a 
teacher should be presumed to have, but which a 
general scholar need not be presumed to have. 
There is a radical antagonism between the culture 
aim and the technical aim, when pursued simulta- 
neously; it is like attempting to weave the fabric 
and make the garment at one and the same time;  
-P-A-G-E-54
  54 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
either the fabric, or the garment, or very likely both, 
will be spoiled. Mr. Bain notes the difficulty of 
“reconciling the whole man with himself,’’ that is, 
man simply as a man with man as an instrument. 
Plato declares that arithmetic as taught to merchants 
and shopkeepers is incompatible with arithmetic when 
taught for discipline and culture. For purposes of 
liberal training, studies should be disinterested, they 
should be pursued for their own sake and not for the 
utilities that can be extracted from them. A student 
is in an unwholesome mental and moral condition 
when he feels constrained to say of his studies, ‘‘ How 
can I turn this knowledge to practical account in the 
way of earning my bread?’? Under such conditions 
learning ceases to be liberal, it sacrifices freedom and 
breadth to the exactions of utility. To paint because 
painting is a delight is a very different thing from 
painting to earn one’s bread; just as the ardor of an 
amateur is different from the industry of an artisan. 
Moderate bibliomania is a generous passion, but its 
virtue can be destroyed by buying books to sell. 
Speculation soars on free and lofty wings, but it is 
brought to earth when tied to staid utilities. 
‘Lhe only complete relief from this antagonism be- 
tween the liberal and the technical is to be found in
-P-A-G-E-55
    WHOLESOME CULTURE 55 
making them successive and not simultaneous; in 
securing liberal training first, and then superadding 
to it that special training required for the practice of 
an art. On the Continent, for example, men whose 
ultimate aim is to become physicians or clergymen 
first become scholars through the training of the gym- 
nasium and the university; and with this endowment 
of culture, breadth and discipline, they then apply 
themselves to the mastery of their chosen profession 
or calling. In this country a young man enters a law 
school or a medical college without breadth and culture, 
learns his art under the stress of these limitations, and 
enters upon life maimed and hampered in many ways. 
The professional training of teachers is on a higher 
plane. Young men and women while gaining their 
technical training in normal schools are at the same 
time carrying forward their academic training; and 
while they rarely become scholars and possess but 
little of the scholarly spirit, they have at least the 
rudiments of an education along with some knowledge 
of their art. 
Every consideration disposes me to speak kindly of 
normal schools and of the men and women who shape 
their policy and do their work. They doubtless per- 
form a service which could be performed so well in
-P-A-G-E-56
      56 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
no other way, and whatever faults affect their work 
are due to existing conditions that cannot be materially 
changed. So far as they affect the teaching service of 
the country, the upper limit of their field falls a little 
within the high school grade of the public school. | 
Their field is the country school, and in the city | 
school it reaches upwards to the eleventh grade. 2 
Ideally, all teachers, of whatever grade, should be 
scholars both by instinct and attainment; but under 
existing conditions this ideal is unattainable, and the 
best professional training that is practically attainable 
by the great mass of those who teach is doubtless given 
in the normal schools of the day. Their academic 
work is mainly of the secondary or high school type, 
and their technical training is mainly in method and 
in the elements of psychology. Their courses of 
study are not in themselves of the liberal type, and 
they fall still farther short of this end because the 
student’s thought is kept so continuously on the me- 
chanics of his art. The culture aim and the technical 
aim are in sharp and constant collision, to the great 
detriment, almost to the defeat, of both. Their tech- 
nical training is too mechanical, too rigidly exact, 
seeming to assume that the rules of treatment and 
construction applicable to matter are also applicable
-P-A-G-E-57
  WHOLESOME CULTURE 5T 
to spirit. These schools have contributed but little in 
thought, doctrine or personnel to the permanent teach- 
ing profession of the country. If I am not mistaken in 
my observations, their graduates have made but slight 
contributions to the educational thought of the day, 
have shown but little skill in solving the graver prob- 
lems in public education, and are but slightly repre- 
sented among the recognized leaders of public opinion 
in matters of educational doctrine and practice. 
When I speak of the imperfections of normal 
schools I have in my mind the quality of their work 
as related to what may be called the higher teaching 
service of the country, or to the teaching profession 
properly so called. As I view them, these schools 
fail to meet the needs of this higher service in two 
particulars: they do not create scholars, and they do 
not give their students what I have just called scéence. 
Their aim is so empirical and so practical that culture 
aims are made impossible. In academic work their 
graduates seldom reach that stage of growth known 
as ‘intellectual emancipation,’’ that stage of learning 
where the mere drillmaster is abandoned and the stu- 
dent comes into possession of the free and voluntary 
use of his powers, where learning is a delight and 
constitutes the natural vocation of the mind. For
-P-A-G-E-58

58 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
anything above routine service, fixed methods of 
teaching are an obstruction to growth and progress. 
They absolve the teacher from all efforts at invention 
and destroy the possibility of his best gift, versatility, 
the power to adapt himself to new conditions, to rec- 
ognize exceptional cases, and to rise superior to the 
iron rule of tradition and routine. For artistic work 
in teaching, for that spontaneity of effort which is 
implied in all high service affecting spirit, I think the 
happiest conditions are these: the zeal of an amateur 
supported and directed by a knowledge of general 
principles. Outside of these conditions I see no op- 
portunity for growth. In the lower teaching service 
it may be that purely routine work is best, but I am 
now thinking of that higher service to which a college 
is devoted. 
I have dwelt a little on the situation of normal 
schools, not for the purpose of criticising them, for 
the uniformity of their organization and the intelli- 
gence of those wko conduct them oblige me to believe 
that they respond to existing conditions; but rather to 
show how very difficult it is to hold the delicate bal- 
ance between the culture aim and the technical aim, 
to reconcile the artist with the artisan, the man with 
the instrument. i

THE POLICY OF BENEVOLENCE 
Scuoors exist and are maintained not for the sake 
of their teachers, but for the sake of their pupils. 
So far as the prime purpose of a school is concerned 
the pupil has clear precedence over the teacher. The 
interest, the needs, the convenience and the comfort 
of students are to be consulted first, and in all these 
respects the teacher is to adjust himself to his pupils. 
A recitation is to be set for a given hour, not because 
this hour suits the convenience of the teacher, but 
because it is the most convenient hour for his pupils. 
Students come to be served, not to serve. Our highest 
function is that of service to our pupils, in the same 
sense that the highest office of parents is to serve their 
children. This is scriptural condescension. The valid 
ground on which obedience is enjoined on children, 
pupils and citizens is that docility is the necessary con- 
dition of being served. The world’s divine Teacher 
came down to men not to be ministered unto, but to 
minister. I know how contrary this doctrine is to 
the assumption often made that the wishes, wants and 
   
-P-A-G-E-62
hi li a i aa 
62 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
pleasures of the teacher stand first, and that the stu- 
dent must adjust himself to the caprices cf his in- 
} structor. This is no doubt the cause of much of that 
antagonism between teacher and pupil which in some ; 
schools leads to insubordination and riot, and in others 
to a sort of armed neutrality or smothered spirit of 
insurrection that is a constant menace to good govern- 
ment. 
In some institutions, by what we may call university 
license, offences are committed against the person, in 
the way of hazing, which would be counted as pun- 
ishable crimes if committed outside of college walls. 
In such cases university tradition is mightier than civil 
  law, and the ordinary processes for punishing crimes 
i are found to be powerless. Now what is the explana- 
i tion of such facts? I know of but one explanation 
of this anomaly. In a state of war, deceit, theft, rob- 
bery and murder cease to be crimes when they are 
practiced on the enemy; they in fact become virtues, 
and are rewarded as such. So in college life, a stu- 
; dent who gains an advantage by ruse, artifice, fraud, 
: or force over jis enemy—his teacher—not only does 
not lose caste among his fellows, but he thereby be- 
comes a hero if his offence is sufficiently great to 
attract public notice, 
   
-P-A-G-E-63
  
THE POLICY OF BENEVOLENCE 63 
I believe that in all schools there is some shade or 
degree of this secular antagonism, and that the expla- 
nation of this phenomenon lies in some false relation 
that has been allowed to grow up through years, 
perhaps through centuries, between students and 
teachers; and it is my further belief that the fault 
in this case lies mainly at the door of the teaching 
body. What is this fault, or, rather, what are these 
faults? In the main they seem to me to be the 
following : 
Teachers asswme too great a difference in rank 
between themselves and their pupils. In the early 
days of universities, when the little learning that 
existed was a monopoly of the clergy, the pride of 
letters put an almost impassable gulf between the 
teacher and his pupils. The teacher was a prince, a 
ruler, made such almost by divine favor and appoint- 
ment, while his pupils were his vassals, his subjects, 
made such by their ignorance and dependence. 
In some quarters there still exists university courts, 
university codes, and even university prisons; and it 
is not long since the university whipping-post has 
passed out of use. The severity of the old-time school 
and college discipline is notorious; it was harsh, often 
cruel, and at times inhuman. Harsh family discipline 7

  64 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
is offset and tempered by that respect and affection 
which spring from kinship, and resentment, if ever 
felt, soon dissolves under parental tenderness and 
benevolence; but the wounds left by tutorial punish- 
ment do not readily heal; the scar that was left on 
the twig remains on the tree. Whatever the original 
cause may have been, the fact remains that there is 
an inherited tendency on the part of students to look 
upon teachers as their natural enemies, just as a brood 
of chickens, anterior to experience, is terrified and 
scattered by the shadow of a swooping hawk. The 
distance between teacher and pupil is even lengthened 
in modern times, especially in public schools, by the 
fact that children are taught in such masses that direct 
contact is made well-nigh impossible, and hence all 
education, in its true and deeper sense, made equally 
impossible. This isolation of pupil from teacher I 
count as the radical vice in school administration. It 
makes sympathy either difficult or impossible; and 
lack of sympathy breeds distrust, dislike and even 
defiance. In American colleges and universities the 
faculty is the college court, but a court of anomalous 
constitution, its members being at once prosecutors, 
witnesses, jurymen, judges, and in their corporate 
action, executioner. By a further anomaly the student
-P-A-G-E-65
  
THE POLICY OF BENEVOLENCE 65 
is tried and convicted in his absence, and so, without 
the privilege accorded to the worst of criminals in 
civil courts of introducing evidence in his own behalf 
and of cross-questioning the evidence brought against 
him. Is it any wonder that students distrust decisions 
of sucha court? Is it any wonder that they are restive 
under a system of government which appears to them 
little less than an oligarchy, and that they sometimes 
resort to measures, fair or foul, which have in them 
some promise of protection or relief? 
For this evil of the first magnitude there are two 
means of relief, and of these I now wish briefly to 
speak. 
Evidently our first duty is to descend somewhat 
from the heights of our assumed superiority, and to 
regard our pupils more as our equals in point of social 
position, moral worth, general intelligence and honesty 
of purpose. Our pupils are our inferiors only in 
knowledge and experience, but this is a difference in 
degree, not in kind, and merely signifies that we are a 
body of learners aiming at the same goal, some only 
fairly started, others in the heat of the race, and still 
others, perhaps, in sight of the prize which lies at 
life’s close. The fact that we are all learners should 
stamp such a corporation of teachers and students with 
5 
 
-P-A-G-E-66
  66 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
the seal of unity and equality. This was the original 
idea of a university, a corporate body of learners in 
which the more proficient taught the less proficient as 
a sort of payment to the future for a debt incurred in 
the past. This is the meaning of the device we love 
to honor: Epucarron 1s A DEBT DUE FROM PAST TO 
FUTURE GENERATIONS. 
This fact of virtual equality should be instructive 
in more ways than one. Are we sensitive to the good 
opinion of others? So are our pupils. Would it 
shock, mortify and hurt us to be reproached in public 
or in private for our ignorance or our stupidity? Our 
pupils are similarly hurt, for their feelings are as acute 
as ours. Do we find it hard to bear our daily burdens 
when ill, or in trouble, or in sorrow of any sort? So 
do our pupils. Are our burdens lightened, or our 
backs strengthened, by a kind word or an approving 
smile? They, too, are affected and helped in a like 
manner. Do we who are older and wiser and stronger   
      
stand in need of charity, forbearance and mercy? So 
should we be kind and merciful to those who are pre- 
sum tbly weaker and less wise. And we need not fear 
to f ce this question of equality in its other phase. If 
the ‘aults of our pupils are to be noted, corrected and 
pos: bly punished, so may not our own faults be 
 
-P-A-G-E-67
  
THE POLICY OF BENEVOLENCE 67 
subject to some process of reproof and amendment? 
As our pupils are not above correction, so neither 
are we. 
Another fact must not be overlooked. Many stu- 
dents, perhaps the most of them, labor under some 
stress of circumstances, some res angustw domi. It 
is home sacrifice that allowed them to enter school, 
and it is still home sacrifice and personal sacrifice that 
keep them there. I well know that the issue of this 
burden-bearing is strength, a higher and better type 
of manhood and womanhood, and that a life of ease 
is not a thing to be desired; but we may at least 
forbear to place on willing shoulders any unnatural or 
unnecessary burdens, and may employ our best efforts 
and wisest, kindest plans towards fortifying our pupil’s 
  ability to do and to dare, to suffer and to bear. In 
Fuller’s quaint phrase, we may ‘‘strengthen the 
back’? even if we cannot ‘‘ lighten the burden.’’ 
The second measure of relief which I propose is a 
college court of equity, as distinguished from that col- 
lege court of law known as the Faculty. Students 
have some ground for looking on the Faculty as a sort 
of Star Chamber, where their fate is determined 
within closed doors, and in a manner more or less 
arbitrary. Virgil’s variwm et mutabile semper might  
-P-A-G-E-68
  68 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
aptly be applied to this college court. In its hearings 
and decisions a Faculty is merely a large jury, and 
juries are untrustworthy in proportion to their size, 
because individual responsibility becomes smaller as 
the divisor becomes greater. Safety lies in fixing 
responsibility on an individual or on a small number 
of known individuals. In such cases evidence will be 
weighed with extreme care, and decisions will be made 
with extreme caution. At best a college Faculty is a 
court of law in which decisions are reached through 
forms and processes more or less arbitrary and inflexi- 
ble. Mere law as distinguished from equity is heart- 
less, unfeeling, unsympathetic; and it not infrequently 
happens that a decision may be strictly legal, but at 
the same time unjust. This fact has become so appa- 
rent in the history of judicature that courts of equity 
have been established to supplement courts of law, so 
that appeals may be taken for review toa smaller,jury 
where justice may be tempered with mercy and where 
the letter that kills may be offset by the spirit which 
gives life. It is no doubt best that the college Faculty 
should remain, in the main, what it now is, a court of 
law, but with the necessary proviso, that it is supple- 
mented by a court of equity. If, in the final sum- 
ming up, it appears that a student lacks merely a poor
-P-A-G-E-69
THE POLICY OF BENEVOLENCE 69 
one-fifth in the requirements for graduation, it is just 
and proper that the Faculty should follow the strict 
letter of the law and deny him graduation; but in 
this and all similar cases there should be the privilege 
of appeal to a higher court where the decision of the 
lower tribunal may be reviewed in the light of equity 
as well as of law. I see no good reason why the 
course of college judicature should not be substantially 
the same as that of civil judicature. Experience has 
shown in the last case that there must be channels of 
appeal from lower tribunals to higher, to the end that 
injustice and oppression may be prevented by appeal- 
ing from the tyranny of form and the prejudice of 
passion to the wider principles of jurisprudence and 
the larger precepts of equity. I feel sure that such 
asystem of college judicature would commend itself 
to the student body and would prevent that suspicion 
and alienation which tend to maintain a gulf between 
itand us. A college judicial system might be com- 
posed of three courts as follows: The Faculty, or 
court of law; the executive committee, or court of 
appeal; and the president, or court of equity, the 
court of last resort. Neither of these lower courts 
should be suspicious or envious of the one next above 
it, through the feeling that its own prerogatives may 
   
-P-A-G-E-70
  70 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
be set aside, or its owm dignity compromised. Neither 
of these bodies should assail the decision of another, 
but in thought and speech should confirm it. In this 
way each court will become conservative and safe 
and the whole system sound and beneficent. There 
should be an organization of Faculty and students 
into one compact, harmonious body, living and acting 
in a concert undisturbed by suspicious or rival interests, 
and ambitious only for the common good. In other 
words we want, in the best and completest sense, a 
college commonwealth, a true republic of letters, 
where, through community of interest and vocation, 
teachers and students shall be wrought into one cor- 
poration for the promotion of knowledge and virtue. 
The other fault which I shall notice is this: The 
assumption that college administration should illus- 
trate the law of the survival of the fittest, that the 
mediocre and the dull should be forced or crowded 
out, and that only the bright and the brilliant are 
worthy of the teacher’s efforts. Stated in these plain 
terms, no one will acknowledge that he justifies such 
a policy; but practically the colleges and universities 
whose avowed or implied mission is a ‘‘standard ”’ 
conduct their teaching and examining on this hy- 
pothesis. Just what I mean will become plainer if I
-P-A-G-E-71
  THE POLICY OF BENEVOLENCE Th 
state what I think should be an axiom in college 
administration: THE woRTH OF A SCHOOL IS DETER- 
MINED, NOT BY THE FEW WHO SURVIVE THE RIGORS 
OF ITS DISCIPLINE, BUT BY THE MANY WHO ARE MADE 
TO THRIVE ON ITS NURTURE. The feeling is widely 
prevalent that a college is open only to the select, the 
elect, that it is closed to minds of the common mould, 
that it is an institution set apart, if not for the aris- 
tocracy of wealth, at least for the aristocracy of intel- 
lect. TI incline to a wholly different view. A college 
should be democratic in its aims and methods, it 
, Should be open to the poor and the lowly, it should 
afford an opportunity for the common mind to add to 
its powers and its stores, and its usefulness should be 
measured by the breadth of its helpfulness and not by 
the height to which it can push exceptional talent. 
Who may be admitted toa college? He who is likely 
to profit by the advantages which it offers. Who 
may be retained in a college? He who is making an 
honest and profitable use of his time and talents. Who 
may be removed from college? He who misuses his 
time and opportunity, or who is unable to profit by 
the advantages offered him. As there are diversities 
of gifts, so there will be diversities of improvement. 
In a class of twenty there may be twenty grades of

scholarship, and still each student may be in his right 
place; just as in a church there may be an audience 
of a thousand, and while no two hearers are equally 
edified by the sermon, all are profited according to 
their several ability. A teacher’s power is to be 
estimated, not by what his best pupils do, but by what 
the more: poorly endowed are enabled to do by his 
‘inspiration and aid. Dullness and ignorance are mis- 
fortunes to be patiently relieved, not offences to be 
summarily punished. Diligence and good intent, even 
when associated with dullness, are cardinal virtues to 
be respected and rewarded. The false ambition of 
teachers to set up standards entails countless miseries 
on the timid and the weak. Generally speaking, 
colleges are conservative and careful; but overdriving 
is not unknown, and one of the last lessons for some 
instructors to learn is to assign lessons of reasonable 
length, and to recollect that other teachers are entitled 
to a fair share of the student’s time. Instances have 
occurred in which the lessons assigned in one class, if 
well learned, would require three-fourths of all the 
student’s available time. Under such an unmerciful 
stress, students will either bolt or break, and the 
student of finest fiber will break first. Some years 
ago a high spirited, ambitious and most benevolent

student began her work in college with high hopes. 
She soon began to feel the pressure of inordinate tasks 
and sharp reproof. She made heroic attempts to re- 
cover lost ground and lost favor, but her burdens 
became heavier and her powers of resistance feebler. 
Near the close of the first semester, broken in health 
and in mind, wounded in spirit, she returned to her 
home to nourish resentments which were too well 
founded to be argued away. This case of overpressure 
was not the result of any intent, but was the conse- 
quence of a policy whose faults I am now trying to 
expose. Teachers without nerves do not readily sym- 
pathize with students who have nerves. Teachers 
whose feelings for any reason have become callous, 
sometimes make—eruel_assaults-on_the sensitiveness of 
By way of summary and conclusion : 
The general fault in college administration which I 
have here pointed out, andfor which I am trying to 
find a remedy, is not peculiar to any one school. It 
is a fault so general that the hope of extirpating it 
may be a chimera, but we may at least hope to reduce 
it to its minimum degree of evil. This fault is the 
secular antagonism between the student body and the 
teaching body. I call it secular because it is as old
-P-A-G-E-74
eT Cen er ee Cee nrere 
T4 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
as universities themselves. I want to see these two 
interests fused into one so that the school shall be an 
organic whole, made such by perfect harmony of con- 
duct and intent, instead of a house divided against 
itself. The cause of this breach of harmony lies 
mainly in the teaching body. If students are suspi- 
cious and resentful it may be because they have been 
treated with some measure of harshness and injustice. 
A. school should develop docility, responsiveness and 
loyalty in its students. With the rarest of exceptions, 
they deserve only kindness, courtesy and hearty re- 
spect, and need no other stimulus than mild and 
deserved commendation for perseverance under diffi- 
culties. 
In conclusion what better counsel can I give than 
this from Sartor Resartus ?

ants, without knowledge of man’s nature, or of

thinking and to come to its own conclusions. This 
mode of procedure is particularly necessary when 
mature minds are dealing with those complex and 
many-sided questions which are connected with prac- 
tical education. However long and patient our think- 
ing may have been, it is not very probable that any of 
us have looked through and entirely around even the 
simplest question involved in the educating art. It is 
by a division of labor that these problems are finally 
compassed. Men severally look at the different phases 
of a complex question, and thus by discussion, com- 
parison and ultimate agreement, there results a com- 
posite view of the truth more or less perfect as the 
thought has been catholic, penetrating and judicial. 
It is worth while to remind ourselves that the 
problem of human education is one of the very earliest

that taxed the ingenuity and wisdom of thinking men; 
and that this theme has been a favorite topic of dis- 
cussion by the most learned and the most saintly men 
in all ages of the world. The most interesting and 
the most instructive chapter in the general history of 
the world is that which relates to the rise, progress 
and fate of those countless systems which have been 
devised for the education and training of the young. 
This is no less than the history of civilization itself, 
and exhibits man’s power, by deliberate thinking, over 
the destiny of the race to which he belongs. 
Family pride, based on noble living and virtuous 
achievement, is one of the most wholesome and in- 
spiring emotions of the soul. It puts a precious 
heritage in the keeping of each new generation and 
reinforces individual worth and power by the worth 
and power accumulated and capitalized through gen- 
erations of noble lives. Virtue thus becomes a tradi- 
tion and an inheritance, and their possessor is placed 
on vantage ground that may insure victory in the race 
of life. Pride in one’s professional ancestry is a kin- 
dred emotion, and any calling which inherits noble 
traditions will have a following of superior spirits. 
To be ashamed of one’s calling is to confess defeat, 
and in some measure to deserve it, for one of the first

rules of living is to shun any occupation into which one 
cannot put one’s whole soul. When oppressed with 
the routine cares of my profession I find reinforcement 
and relief in the thought that the masterpiece of the 
world’s master thinker, Plato, isa treatise on education, 
and with the pages of the incomparable ‘‘ Republic” 
before him the teacher may feel a conscious pride of 
calling which will make him step lightly over the vex- 
ations that sometimes embarrass his steps. Can we 
ever forget that the highest office ever conferred by 
heaven on mortals was to be the teacher of men? The 
essence of real preaching is effective teaching, and we 
- mniss the grandeur of the teaching office if we fail to see 
that the ministry of the schoolroom is as sacred as the 
~ministry of the altar. 
With respect to their influence in raising the tone 
and type of human thought and life, occupations 
naturally fall into three categories or classes—those 
which degrade and corrupt, those which are merely 
neutral or conservative, and those which, by their 
positive and aggressive character, lift the race to 
higher and higher planes of thinking and living. In 
other terms, some men employ their activities in 
making the world worse, and if their numbers were 
not restricted and their influence checked and counter-

acted the race would lapse into beastliness and infamy ; 
other men receive from society the best it ean give, 
return to it a fair equivalent for what they have 
received, and leave the world in the same condition as 
though they had never lived in it; while others, and 
this by far the smaller number, return to society much 
more than they take from it, transform the common 
things of life into things of noble nature and use, and 
leave the world a better and a happier place because 
they have lived and labored in it. By slothful and 
wasteful tillage one farmer will impoverish and ruin a 
field that nature had blessed with fatness; another 
will hold an even balance between waste and repair, 
and in the end will leave his fields neither better nor 
worse for his occupancy; while a third will develop 
the hidden resources of the earth, will transform air, 
rain and sunlight into orchards and herds and har- 
vests, will fill his barns with the precious fruits of the 
earth, and will leave his fields endowed with tenfold 
fertility through his creative and transforming power. 
By means of human industry, art and genius, the 
material world is passing through a series of trans- 
formations which in the end will amount to a re-crea- 
tion. Fertile and populous Holland, reclaimed from 
the sea, is the type of what civilized man is doing all
-P-A-G-E-83
  
  TEACHING A SPIRITUAL ART 83 
over the face of the earth. Literally the wilderness 
is being made to blossom as the rose. Deserts are 
being converted into arable and productive fields; 
mountains are brought low; the deep places of the 
earth filled up; pestilent marshes are drained and 
cultivated; treasures hidden under the mountains 
since the morning of creation are unearthed and con- 
verted into beauty and power; and over the earth and 
the sea, and through the air, men are constructing 
numberless highways for the transmission and diffu-   
sion of wealth, comfort, intelligence and happiness. 
In an analogous way the moral world is passing 
through a series of upward transformations towards 
peace, charity, brotherly kindness and righteousness, 
and in the end, we cannot doubt, there will be a new 
people for the new earth; the world of matter and 
the world of spirit will have been changed from one 
glory to another till the thought of God for man and 
his dwelling place shall have ended in its perfect: reali- 
zation. Taken in its broad but legitimate sense, this 
work of re-creation or restoration is the final aim of 
education; and the glory of the teacher’s calling is 
that it is the agency by which human society is to be 
lifted to higher and higher planes of physical, mental 
and moral. perfection. Of the three categories of
-P-A-G-E-84
84 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
occupations just noted, the educating art belongs pre-- 
eminently to the third and highest—its aims are bene- 
ficent and beneficent only. 
“Teaching,’’ says Mr. Fitch, ‘‘is the noblest of 
professions, but the sorriest of trades,’’ and in speak- 
ing of the dignity of the educating art, I have asso- 
ciated it with all that is best in mind, heart and 
character. ‘‘A teacher,’? says Rousseau, ‘‘ what a 
noble soul he ought to be!’’? Education might be 
defined as the art of moulding or transforming char- 
acter, and the teaching which is tributary to this high 
art must be an alliance of intellect with heart. There 
is much teaching that does not take hold on character ; 
it leaves the heart untouched and so leaves the springs 
of conduct unaffected. Into teaching which effects 
the ends that education has in view, there must be 
infused generous measures of honest affection. Mag- 
nanimity, benevolence and moral courage are three 
requisites for attaining real success in the educating 
art, and the whole process is spiritual to an extreme 
degree. Plato, and Ruskin after him, make teaching 
a process of eliciting; Emerson calls it provocation; 
and some have represented it as induction, as when 
President Garfield speaks of a college as consisting 
essentially of two things, an impressible boy on one
-P-A-G-E-85
  TEACHING A SPIRITUAL ART 85 
end of a bench and a Mark Hopkins on the other. It 
suflices to place a bar of soft iron in the near presence 
of a magnet in order to cause it to take on magnetic 
qualities. We call this induction, and it is by an 
analogous process that children become generous, 
magnanimous, noble and scholarly, by absorbing the 
qualities from those who are highly charged with 
them. This amounts to saying that education is 
character-building, and as character is affected chiefly 
by character, all that is best in life and letters should 
enter into the spirit of the teacher. It was once said 
of avery beautiful and accomplished woman that to 
be on terms of close friendship with her was a liberal 
education; and it is certain that the near presence of 
a scholarly man or woman is more potent than text- 
book or lecture can be in the production of manly or 
womanly character. Perfunctory teaching that begins 
and ends merely with a didactic lesson falls sterile on 
the sensitive soul and leaves nothing which makes for 
righteousness and peace. Good teaching must have 
much of the persuasive power of oratory. It must 
kindle enthusiasm, establish motive, fortify the will 
and inspire the soul to noble acting. When the boys 
at Rugby saw the face of Dr. Arnold looking kindly 
and approvingly on them from his study window as

they swayed and struggled in the quadrangle below, 
  they were affected by the same’ impulse to heroic 
achievements which urged on Napoleon’s soldiers at 
the battle of the Pyramids. In this sense every great 
teacher is a great captain; he prevails more by his 
presence and example than by any set lesson in science 
or letters. I think we must all lament the decay of 
discipleship, that ardent affection which attaches pupil 
to master, and that devotion which espouses his cause 
and propagates his doctrines. Teaching that does not 
end in some degree of discipleship is lacking in one 
essential feature, for Aristotle has observed that we 
do not readily learn from one we do not love. The 
modern doctrine that the pupil must early become 
independent of his master, must become a law to him- 
self, and espouse only his own opinions, though true 
to a certain extent, sacrifices the dearest element in 
education, the guiding, moulding and transforming 
power of a serene and cultured soul. 
There is much in modern education which encour- 
ages the purely mechanical aspect of teaching, which 
regards the child as a piece of matter to be trimmed 
and fitted into regulation shape, which deals with free 
and versatile spirit as the artisan deals with senseless 
wood and iron. This danger has always been abroad
-P-A-G-E-87
TEACHING A SPIRITUAL ART 87 
in the world, but it has become imminent and actual 
in this age when children are taught in masses under 
machine pressure, and when products are to be turned 
out that must fit into prescribed places. It seems to 
be a very general law that the first stage in the evolu- 
‘tion of human organizations is the mechanical; that 
before they emerge into the perfect law of liberty they 
must suffer a bondage to harsh and unfeeling prescrip- 
tions; that routine and rule must for a time usurp the 
place of spontaneity and reason. Christianity had 
such an evolution, and it is not singular that educa- 
tion, falling perchance under the fashioning of coarser 
hands, should obey the same tendency. The coming 
era in the history of public education in the South is 
the era of the graded school, for it cannot be doubted 
that in the lifetime of some of us every city and every 
village in this vast domain will have its ‘‘ people’s 
college,”’ its graded school, free and open to all who 
choose to enter it, and offering to rich and poor an 
education which, a century ago, could have been 
obtained only by the privileged few in a college or a 
university; for the first-class high school of to-day is 
superior to the college of the last century. I know 
the graded school too well to speak of it slightingly, 
and I am too good a friend of it to ignore or deny a
-P-A-G-E-88
88 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
danger, which besets its administration. In dealing 
with masses of children, as with masses of men, there 
must be order, precision and prompt obedience to 
authority, and in a school, as in an army, there must 
be a certain amount of routine and a certain degree of 
mechanism. The type of school organization is doubt- 
less military; there must be subordination as well as 
coordination ; there must be one responsible head, and 
there must be a downward distribution of authority 
through subordinates, whose jurisdiction becomes 
smaller as their number becomes larger. But while 
the mechanical is thus a necessity, it should not absorb 
the working power of the organization. The machine 
does not exist for itself, as superintendents sometimes 
  seem to think, but for the inner life which it embodies 
and manifests, and which alone gives value to its crude 
tenement. More than one man whose dull sense sees 
only the outward has become enamored of the smoothly 
working machine which he calls his school. I once 
visited a graded school which moved with the fatal 
accuracy of clockwork. At recess the three hundred 
or four hundred pupils marched down to the play- 
ground with military precision, and an inflexible rule 
would have carried out a line of children into a pelt- 
ing rainstorm, for the symmetry of the parade must
-P-A-G-E-89
  TEACHING A SPIRITUAL ART 89 
not be marred for health’s sake. While the sports of 
the play-ground were at their height the bell struck, 
and instantly every arm and foot and feature became 
fixed in the very-attitude in which it had been caught, 
as though petrified or frozen by the sudden summons. 
After a moment’s suspense another signal was given, 
the dispersed columns were reformed, and the pupils 
returned to their places in military order. I soon 
discovered that this man’s power was very largely 
absorbed in his darling machine, and that the life of 
his school was lean and thin and sickly. Up to 
a certain point organization promotes life, growth 
and development, but beyond this point it absorbs and 
neutralizes the vital forces and tends to impoverish- 
ment and death. I have seen farmers whose revenues 
were so absorbed in buildings, fences, gates and ma- 
chinery, that the downward road to ruin was rapid 
and inevitable. The soul will live on friendly terms 
with a body that is normally developed, but the athlete 
soon becomes an animal, and then the soul shrivels 
and perishes. The ancient Greek teachers knew this, 
and held that gymnastic exercise was not for the body, 
but for the soul, and that it was necessary to maintain the 
physical and spiritual in a state of delicate equipoise. 
The school, like the soul, must have a body or
-P-A-G-E-90
  90 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
tenement in which to live and through which to mani- 
fest its life and power; but the mere domicile may 
absorb so much time, attention and money that the 
school itself may be lean and languishing. I have 
known ambitious towns having a population of a few 
thousand, out of sheer rivalry with wealthier places, 
to build magnificent temples of learning and bequeath 
a heritage of taxation to succeeding generations. 
Almost immediately this burden of debt would begin 
to gall and vex, relief would be sought in a reduction 
of salaries and necessary working expenses, till the 
soul of the school was starved and shrunken. Where 
heroic and devoted teachers have remained at the post 
of duty under this adverse stress the burden of debt 
has virtually been shifted to their shoulders; for what 
has been saved out of a just remuneration has gone to 
liquidate a debt unwisely contracted by the public. 
No one will for a moment call in question the advan- 
tages of commodious, well-arranged and well-equipped 
school buildings; and in structures built at public 
expense and for public use the public school should 
outrank all others; but any expenditure in brick, 
architecture or adornment that cripples the intellectual 
and spiritual resources of the school is not only bad 
economy but a great public wrong.
-P-A-G-E-91

I have just noted the fact that a teacher may so 
expend himself and his resources in mere discipline j 
that his real usefulness as an instructor may be de- 
stroyed; but the fact deserves notice how mere love 
of precision and mechanical order may lead to down- 
right cruelty. It is a good thing by the use of all 
fair measures to reduce tardiness to a minimum, but 
some teachers stake their whole reputation on the 
absolute prohibition of this evil. They make tardi- 
ness a simple impossibility by closing and locking the 
doors the moment the hour for opening school has 
come. This was the rule in a winter school in a dis- 
tant State. At 9 o’clock the outer door was locked. 
A few minutes later two little children, a brother and 
sister, belated by a long walk over roads blocked with 
snow, came to the door with hands and feet benumbed 
with cold. Being unable to enter, they stood shiver- 
ing on the steps till finally a lady who was passing in 
a cutter took them in and carried them to her own 
fireside. This, doubtless, is an extreme case, but it 
illustrates the vice of that mechanical discipline which 
would sacrifice health, comfort and reasonable freedom 
to the vain show of mere routine. 
I repeat the thought that there must be a certain 
amount of mechanism, and even routine, in every 
 
-P-A-G-E-92
  92 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
school organization. Viewed externally, a large public 
school with its companies and regiments of children 
supervised and governed by a chief and his subordi- 
nates is a machine, and a very complex one; but 
whether this mechanism shall promote and facilitate 
the intellectual life within or shall obstruct and per- 
vert it—all this depends on the manner in which the 
school is administered. There is doubtless a disposi- 
tion among schoolmen and teachers to trust too much 
to the working power of mere machinery, just as men 
may depend too much on the mere church for personal 
salvation; and in this formative period in the history 
of public education in the South it cannot be amiss for 
us to guard against a danger that has beset the older 
systems of public instruction. We are to recollect 
that the public school is everywhere coming to the 
front, and that with us, as with all the progressive 
people of the world, it is coming to stay. The State 
has become a public educator, and the public school 
has the right of eminent domain. The typical school 
of the future is not the private academy nor the school 
that is half free and half public, but the public school, 
free and open to all, graded and supervised by public 
authority, and taught by men and women whose quali- 
fications have been tested by official inspection.

Ir I were asked to define the mission of a normal 
college, my definition would be this: Zo aid in the 
formation and recruitment of w teaching profession 
which should devote itself to the cause of public-school 
education. . 
As between public education and private education, 
the former has the right of eminent domain. The 
modern State, as a measure of self-preservation, has 
made itself a public educator. Education has become 
a branch of the public service, maintained and super- 
vised at public expense, and teachers are State officials, 
acting under legal sanctions, and paid, at least in part, 
out of the public revenues. There is no interference 
with schools conducted by individuals, or by religious 
denominations; but the State has such a vital interest 
in the quality of its citizenship that it has become the 
dominant patron of education. The South is now in 
a state of rapid transition from private education to an 
education prescribed and supported by public au-
-P-A-G-E-96
    96 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
thority; and the great problem of the day is the 
creation of a teaching class competent to administer 
this branch of the public service with intelligence and 
skill. 
There never will be a teaching profession in the 
exclusive, compact sense in which there is a legal or a 
medical profession. Teaching is a profession of the 
military type. As all who bear arms are not profes- 
sional soldiers, so all who teach are not professional 
teachers. In both cases there is the regular and the 
volunteer, the former educated at some West Point, 
the other trained for a brief service in some camp by 
official experts. The regular has a vocation, and re- 
mains permanently in the service of his country; the 
volunteer’s service, however valuable and important 
at the time, is merely an incident in his career. The 
institute, the training class and the county normal 
school are in scholastic life what the soldiers’ camp is 
in military life; while West Point and Annapolis are 
typical of the higher institutions devoted to the edu- 
cation of professional teachers, the characteristic fea- 
ture of whose course of study is the history and science 
of education. 
As I understand it, the prime function of the 
normal college should be the education of professional
-P-A-G-E-97
TEACHERS TO BE EDUCATED NOT TRAINED 97 
teachers, as distinguished from the training of volun- 
teer teachers; or, in more definite terms, the prepara- 
tion of men and woman to become teachers and 
guides, endowed with powers of initiative and com- 
mand, rather than the preparation of men and women 
to do the more mechanical work of the schoolroom. 
Of course all the men educated at West Point do 
not become actual military leaders, but the course of 
education is such as to make of every man a possible 
leader—the typical quality aimed at is leadership. 
Similarly, the aim of normal schools of the higher 
type is leadership; and, while it is not possible for all 
their graduates to reach this high vocation, it being 
dependent on circumstance as well as on ability, those 
who fall short of it are still qualified: for efficient ser- 
vice as subordinates. . 
It t goes without ‘ saying that the prime, the funda- 
mental qualification for teachings service of high valie~ 
is “scholarship. It is true that there are some poor 
teachers who are good scholars, certain moral or 
mental defects operating to defeat success; but it is 
certain that no one need hope for permanent and 
growing success in the teaching profession without the 
instincts and habits, and some of the attainments, of 
the real scholar. To secure and retain professional 
7
-P-A-G-E-98
  98 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
standing, a teacher must earn the confidence and re- 
spect of the better educated people in the community 
in which he lives. The vocation of teaching will not 
become a recognized profession until in the popular 
mind the terms ‘‘teacher’’ and ‘‘scholar’’ become 
synonymous. It is a very significant fact that the 
‘trained’? teacher adds little to the repute of the 
teaching profession, it being understood that ‘‘ train- 
ing”? at best implies mere technique, or manual dex- 
terity, and carries with it the suspicion of shallow 
learning; just as elocution, the noble art of vocal 
expression and interpretation, has fallen into disrepute 
through the performances of young persons who mis- 
take sound for sense and gesticulation for eloquence. 
The spirit of the age has set in strongly towards the 
mechanical, the empirical, the practical. This spirit 
has become rampant in normal schools. | Teachers are 
no longer to be educated, but ‘‘ trained; ’’ and this 
‘training’? is to be done in ‘‘laboratories,’’? where 
students are encouraged to operate on children. The 
inevitable but deplorable consequence of this fad is 
that normal schools have lost the respect of educated 
men, and it is very commonly taken for granted that 
a teacher ‘‘trained’’ in these schools is a man or 
woman of slender scholarship, who expects to succeed
-P-A-G-E-99
  TEACHERS TO BE EDUCATED NOT TRAINED 99 
by ‘‘ devices’? and ‘‘methods.’? There seems to be 
but one way to rescue the vocation of teaching from 
this false position, and this is to return towards the 
older conception that a teacher must be a gentleman 
and a scholar. Over the entrance of every normal 
school there should be this legend: ‘‘Tracurne: 
THE NOBLEST OF THE PROFESSIONS, BUT THE SORRIEST 
OF TRADES.”” 
For the reasons here set forth in outline it should 
be the purpose of a normal college to make some 
degree of liberal learning the professional endowment 
of each graduate; to hold fast to the doctrine that 
teachers are to be educated rather than trained, and 
instincts~are-of inore value 
  than-empirical devices and methods. Seeing that the 
‘teachers are the real guardians of the State, why 
should we set for them a lower standard of attainment 
than that which Plato prescribes for the guardians of 
his ideal republic? ‘‘ Lovers, not of a part of wis- 
dom, but of the whole; who have a taste for every 
sort of knowledge and are curious to learn and are 
never satisfied; who have magnificence of mind, and 
are the spectators of all time and all existence; who 
are harmoniously constituted; of a well-proportioned 
and gracious mind, whose own nature will move spon-
-P-A-G-E-100
  100 . THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
taneously towards the true being of everything; who 
have a good memory, and are quick to learn; noble, 
gracious, the friends of truth, justice, courage, tem- 
perance.’’ * 
Surely this ideal is scarcely attainable in any school 
of the present, but it may be approached; and who 
will say that it is not wise to lure our pupils forward 
as far as possible on this pleasant way ? 
But a school may be addicted to liberal learning of 
this high type and still not be a school for the profes- 
sional education of teachers. A teacher must first of 
all be a scholar both in attainment and spirit, but in 
addition to that knowiedge which every well-educated 
man should possess, he must also have that special and 
specific knowledge which distinguishes the teacher 
from the mere scholar. ) All the professions stand in 
the same case. The lawyer, the physician, the clergy- 
man, must be scholars, but each must also have that 
special knowledge which fits him for the practice of 
his profession—knowledge which educated men in 
general need not have. There is knowledge of this 
specific sort for the teacher’s professional use, and it 
is this which differentiates a normal college from a 
college of the ordinary type. The history and the 
* “Republic” (Jowett), 475-487.

science of education; the principles of school organi- 
zation and school management; the science of educa- 
tion values; school hygiene and school legislation ; the 
construction of rational courses of study for schools 
of various grades; the principles of school supervi- 
sion—these and kindred subjects comprise a vast field 
of study and constitute a body of special or profes- 
sional knowledge of larger volume than that which 
enters into the education of the clergyman or the 
lawyer. It should be a distinctive aim of this college 
to communicate to its students as much of this knowl- 
edge as its teaching force makes possible. 
It is believed that the best way to teach a liberal art 
is to teach the essential doctrines and principles that 
underlie that art. Law, medicine and theology are 
taught on this plan. It is legal science that the 
student learns at the law school; and it is out of this 
science, on the occasion of actual experience, that he 
must evolve his art. At the medical college it is the 
science of medicine that the student learns. He may 
visit patients with his preceptor, and may witness 
surgical operations at the clinic; but while a student, 
he is not allowed to administer medicine to the sick, 
nor to practise surgery upon the wounded. — It is out 
of his science and his observation, when his profes-
-P-A-G-E-102
  102 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
sional course is terminated, that he must evolve his 
art. In those vocations in which the hand is princi- 
pally concerned, the handicrafts and trades, an art is 
’ doubtless best learned empirically, by assiduous manual 
practice; but in those higher employments where the 
major or exclusive effort is mental or spiritual, an art 
is best learned by first compassing the science which 
underlies it. Now teaching is an almost purely spirit- 
ual act or art, scarcely involving the manual or mus- 
cular dexterities at all, but in its real essence closely 
akin to the supremest of human arts, the art of lofty 
living; but it is the procedure in all ethical systems 
first to master a theory of life, and then to evolve out 
of it, through daily experience, a corresponding art of 
living. The Sermon on the Mount is pure precept or 
doctrine, first promulgated and learned on authority 
and then expanded into all the phases of righteous 
living. ‘‘ First know and then do,’’ was one of the 
oldest and wisest precepts of Greek philosophy, and it 
would be well if we could turn aside from such mis- 
leading cant as ‘‘ We learn to do by doing,’’ and 
recast our modes of teaching on the basis of a principle 
that is catholic and statesmanlike. Whether in the 
making of a horseshoe or in the construction of a 
treaty, the point of departure is knowledge; and as 
 
-P-A-G-E-103
  
TEACHERS TO BE EDUCATED NOT TRAINED 103 
we rise in an ascending series through the grades of 
activity lying between these two extremes, the em- 
pirical element in instruction gradually diminishes 
until in the last member it dwindles to the zero point. 
In the category of human activities teaching is to be 
classified with statesmanship rather than with black- 
smithing. 
A school of children is now universally regarded as 
a necessary adjunct to a normal school. In most 
cases this supplementary school is employed as an 
experimental or practice school (known in jin de siécle 
terms as a ‘‘laboratory’’), in which students are sup- 
posed to serve a sort of apprenticeship in teaching; 
while in other cases it is simply a well-organized and 
well-taught school, in which students observe models 
of good school work as done by competent teachers, 
and known as a model school, or school of observation. 
Such a school should be employed, not as a practice 
school, experimental school, or ‘‘laboratory,’’ in 
which students experiment on children and thus 
“learn to do by doing,’’ but as a school that may 
serve students as a model which, in whole or in part, 
they may reproduce in their own practice, and which 
represents to them, in the concrete, what the theory of 
the school had before represented to them in the abstract.

reproduction. 
Insistence_on technique tends to defeat the culture 
     holarly in- 
stincts and habits, knowledge must be pursued for its¢ 
own sake, in an atmosphere of freedom and repose. 
The formal prescriptions and arid criticisms of the 
training school foster a dreary and lifeless routine that 
defeats the main purpose of education—the love of 
learning and the quickening of the intellectual powers. 
Teachers and pupils attain freedom only through truth, 
and the larger the truth the greater the freedom. 
Rules have their place in education, but they should 
follow principles, not precede them, and much less 
supersede them. When teachers are very ignorant, 
rules are doubtless more serviceable than general prin- 
ciples; but in a school where professional teachers are 
being educated such ignorance is not to be presumed. 
Except under extraordinary conditions an experi- 
mental school cannot give to students what may be 
called an experience in the honest sense of this term, 
much less an amount of practice equivalent to an
-P-A-G-E-105
    TEACHERS TO BE EDUCATED NOT TRAINED 105 
apprenticeship in teaching. After what term of ser- 
vice may one be called an experienced teacher? The 
very lowest minimum that would seem to me to justify 
such a declaration would be ten weeks or fifty days of 
five hours each, making two hundred and fifty hours 
in the aggregate. Let us suppose that there are five 
teachers employed in the model school, each devoting 
three hours a day to practice work. This would yield 
seventy-five hours a week, three hundred hours a 
month, or two thousand four hundred hours a year. 
Supposing again that one hundred students share this 
opportunity, the maximum experience of each student 
is only twenty-four hours, or less than five days. 
This is probably not an unfair picture of the average 
normal school. If this be true, it would, therefore, 
require a school of ten times this teaching force to 
afford the students the minimum of practice that would 
constitute an experience in teaching. I know of no 
normal school provided with a supplementary school 
large enough to furnish its pupils with enough practice 
work to constitute a real experience in teaching. It 
is almost a pure illusion to regard a few days of such 
practice work as a training in the art of teaching. 
At best, the conditions under which this experience 
is gained are so peculiar, so abnormal, that it may
-P-A-G-E-106
  106 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
fairly be questioned whether it is not a disadvantage 
rather than a real help. There is no virtue in expe- 
rience per se; it may be very helpful or it may be 
very harmful, all depending on the conditions undex 
which it takes place. In order that a young teacher 
may turn his experience to profitable account, the fol- 
lowing conditions should be supplied: The school, or 
the class, should be his own; he should work in the 
light of some clearly conceived principle; there should 
be present to his mind some ideal as a model for imi- 
tation; he should work with composure, with nothing 
to stimulate his self-consciousness; whatever criticism 
is passed on his work should be sparing and judicious, 
and administered in private. 
In the practice school the class taught by the student 
is not his own; it very recently came to him from a 
fellow-student, and will soon pass into the hands of 
another student. He teaches in the presence of official 
critics, pencil and note-book in hand, who are present 
for the express purpose of criticising, and who, there- 
fore, must criticise. These critics being his fellow- 
students, what probability is there that their criticism 
will be just and wise ? Besides, what chance is there 
that the work of this tyro will be done with serenity 
and composure ? What veteran teacher would expect 
 
-P-A-G-E-107
TEACHERS TO BE EDUCATED NOT TRAINED 107 
to succeed in the presence of four or five official 
critics? I have witnessed this practice teaching in 
normal schools of the best class, and I have purposely 
understated the adverse conditions under which stu- 
dents attempt to learn the art of teaching in these 
pedagogical ‘‘ laboratories. ’” 
An easy calculation has shown that a supplementary 
school of children cannot furnish our large classes with 
practice work enough to constitute even the semblance 
of real experience, but it is large enough and complete 
enough to serve as a concrete whole to be observed, 
studied and imitated. This is the original notion and 
intent of a normal school; that is, a school organized 
and taught in such a way as to serve as a norma, 
measure or pattern, by which its students are to try 
their own schools.* Naturally, students will teach as 
they have been taught, and their first impulse will be 
to make their schools like the one with which they are 
most familiar; and if the students of a normal school 
were all destined to organize normal schools of their 
own, no other rule or pattern would be necessary ; 
but as other and different schools will require their 
skill, a supplementary school for observation and

study becomes a necessity. Without such a corrective 
and guide, a college education might disqualify a stu- 
dent for work in a primary or a secondary school. 
The importance of having a wholesome school, well 
graded, well governed and well taught, as an organi- 
zation to be studied and comprehended, will readily 
appear when it is recollected that probably three- 
fourths of the students had never seen such a school 
previous to their entering college. To all such a 
model school is a concrete, living object-lesson. 
In the school, as in the Church and in the State, 
there is the conservative party, holding that the roots 
of all true progress reach far back into the soil of the 
past; that there should be no break in the continuity 
of life; that a better future is to be a gradual and 
equable evolution out of a good past; that the first 
duty of the reformer is to interpret with ‘becoming 
reverence and modesty the past achievements of the 
good and the wise: and the radical party, holding that 
revolution is the main instrument of progress; that 
the first and main duty of the reformer is to destroy ; 
that each new generation must discover for itself by 
experiment and induction the principles of human 
conduct; and that universal unrest is the sign and 
condition of human progress.

Listening merely to the noise that is made in the 
educational world by the loud-voiced and not over- 
modest reformer, we might conclude that the school 
is in a very bad way, that nothing has really been set- 
tled in the way of principles and methods, but that 
the whole scholastic régime is to be created de novo. 
A striking phenomenon of the times is a rapid succes- 
sion of educational fads, some philosophical, some 
methodical, some enduring for a season, others disap- 
pearing after a fitful effort to maintain an existence. 
A favorite vocable to conjure with has been ‘‘Apper- 
ception.’’ It is sufficiently vague to be attractive, and 
sufficiently indefinite to accommodate different shades 
of interpretation. Competing, but less fortunate fads, 
have been ‘‘ Concentration,’’ ‘‘ Interest,’’? and ‘‘Con- 
gruity.”? These form a sprightly troop of hobbies, 
each for a season the favorite of an enthusiastic group, 
but all the subjects of unforeseen and vexatious mis- 
haps. No one can predict the events of the coming 
season, but the course will certainly have its varied 
attractions. This is the way we go; but what a pity 
that the noblest of the professions should be subject 
to such ignoble conditions of growth! 
Just now the hobby of the normal school is the so- 
called ‘‘laboratory.”? This term, deliberately chosen,  
-P-A-G-E-110
  110 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
. marks the height or the depth of the experimental 
method as applied to education. The name is patheti- 
cally suggestive. Children are material, and on this 
material young men and women are to operate for the 
double purpose of making discoveries in infant psy- 
chology, and of learning the art of teaching by the 
experimental method. As vivisection, so much in 
vogue in biology, rediscovers from year to year, at the 
cost of numberless lives, what is well known in physi- 
ology; so the ‘‘ pedagogical laboratory » rediscovers 
truths in the mental life that in one form or another 
have been well known for centuries. It is barely con- 
ceivable that, after countless experiments and disasters, 
some essentially new truth may be added to what is 
already known; but it is infinitely more probable that 
in each bushel of new chaff there will be found only 
the one grain that in kind is as old as the Pharaohs 
and their mummies. 
It is so easy to assume that there are no ancient 
landmarks which our forefathers have set! So modern 
and so scientific for each callow scholar to mark off the 
highways of knowledge with milestones of his own de- 
vising! But the supreme pity is that this laboratory

opinion as it bears on human interests of such infinite 
moment that no method should be tolerated which is 
not conservative and cautious. Seeing that education 
is the architectonic or master art, it should be the most 
conservative of all the arts; of all human institutions 
the school should be the one the least addicted to 
change, the least exposed to innovations. To be con- 
servative is to be neither stationary nor retrogressive, 
but to be wisely circumspect and cautious while adapt- 
ing old methods to new needs. It is the school that is 
piloting the race across the centuries, and its hands 
should ever be held firmly on the helm, and its eyes 
steadily fixed on the compass. In such a voyage ex- 
periments in navigation are not only perilous, but

Hz would do the world no mean service who would 
write an impartial history of fads, showing the rise, 
progress, termination and results of each. Such a 
history would doubtless discover to us the fact that 
even the thinking world is addicted to hobby-riding, 
and that successive fads are the rungs of a ladder on 
which thought ascends from lower conceptions to 
higher, and thus gains wider and wider horizons of 
truth. What were nominalism and realism but phi- 
losophical fads, engrossing men’s thoughts for a sea- 
son, kindling the controversial spirit up to the fight- 
ing point, then waning in interest, and finally giving 
place to other fads? Phlogiston, Malthusianism, Dar- 
winianism, the nebular hypothesis, phrenology, Chris- 
tian science and hypnotism are phenomena of the same 
sort. These are all “guesses at truth.” Their devo- 
tees, indeed, regard them as truth itself, but successive 
thinkers finally separate the grains of pure metal from 
the larger volume of alloy, garner the precious residue 
into the general storehouse of science and then make 
a venture at now guesses, The line of Sherman’s

march to the sea is now marked by abandoned forts, 
exploded shells and half-filled trenches. So the 
triumphal march of thought is marked by abandoned 
hypotheses, exploded theories, and empty conjectures. 
The same phenomenon is observable in the special 
science to which we are addicted. Men of my years 
have lived through a succession of educational fads, 
and our predecessors, near and remote, were doomed 
to traverse a similar route. Within our own time ob- 
ject-teaching rose in the Fast, if not as the sun, at least 
as a star of the first magnitude, but its distinctive light 
has been lost in its passage across the horizon. Then 
appeared other lights, from time to time, great and 
small, to which we did homage, such as manual train- 
ing and the inductive method; and now the suns or 
meteors that are in full blaze on our pedagogic firma- 
29 6, Om Cee ment are “concentration,” “apperception,” “interest,” 
“eongruity” and “a pot of green feathers.” 
We are not to forget that the monitorial system 
swept over the country eighty years ago like an epi- 
demic, and that it took such a stalwart as De Witt 
Clinton clear off his feet. The head that could project 
the Erie canal could also utter such a wild prophecy 
as this: “TI recognize in Lancaster the benefactor of 
the human race. I consider his system as creating a, 
.,  
-P-A-G-E-117
  EDUCATION ACCORDING TO NATURE 117 
new era in education—as a blessing sent down from 
heaven to redeem the poor and distressed of this world 
from the power and dominion of ignorance.”* Re- 
turning to the figure just employed, Lancastrianism 
was a blazing comet, creating a profound sensation at 
the time of its appearance; but it speedily burned ont, 
leaving hardly as much as a poor cinder by way of re- 
membrance. 
In place of fad I might have used the word craze, 
or hobby, but fad is the newer term, and I use it to 
denote a wide class of phenomena, social, political, 
philosophical, educational and even religious. I use 
the term in a more serious sense than the ordinary, to 
indicate a phase of thought that, while serious, is at 
the same time partial and shallow, and, in its appear- 
ance and disappearance, epidemic. 
It will be readily guessed that I include “Education 
According to Nature,” or “Follow Nature,” among 
educational fads. In the sense just stated, I do; only 
“Nature” must be considered as the most respectable 
of these fads, by reason of its antiquity and longevity; 
though sometimes, as in the case of Joseph Payne and 
*§. S. Randall, ‘‘History of the Common Schools of New 
York,’’ p. 28.
-P-A-G-E-118
  118 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
other imitators of Mr. Spencer, the whole treatment is 
little better than cant—shallow and offensive. 
The precept, “Follow Nature,” is prevalent in 
ethics, in education, and in medicine, where Nature is 
set up as a criterion of right and wrong, of true and 
false. A practice that is supposed to be in conformity 
with Nature is thereby proved to be right, or true; 
while a practice that can be shown to be contrary to 
Nature is assumed to be wrong, or false. Thus, Aris- 
totle defends slavery because it is “natural,” some men 
being born to rule, others to serve, some being strong, 
others weak; while he condemns usury, or the taking 
of interest, because it is “unnatural.” Flocks and 
crops springing from the soil are wealth proper, and 
for convenience they may be converted into money; 
but to produce money from money, a dead thing from 
a dead thing, is unnatural, and therefore wrong. 
“Down to the Norman conquest the Britons had ‘living 
money’ and ‘dead money,’ the former being slaves and 
cattle, the latter metal.” Our modern temperance 
reformers use the same argument. Alcohol is an evil, 
because it is produced by the decay or rotting of a 
natural product, as corn, rye, or wheat; though just
-P-A-G-E-119
EDUCATION ACCORDING TO NATURE 119 
why vinegar should escape condemnation is not at all 
clear. 
Peter the Great suffered a similar delusion when he 
ordered his naval cadets to use sea water for drinking 
purposes. Is not the sea the natural domain of the 
sailor, just as the land is the natural domain of the 
soldier? The sailor must therefore adapt himself to 
his environment; he must draw his sustenance from 
the elements on which he lives. Had Peter taken wise 
counsel before giving this order, he might have been 
reminded that it was a scientific error to include sailors 
and saltwater fish in the same category; but he was 
following Nature, as he supposed, and his cadets had 
to perish. 
The same false analogy betrayed John Locke into 
”” Men in a “state of nature” his “hardening process. 
wear no shoes, and though their clothing is very scant, 
even in winter, they adapt themselves to rigors of tem- 
perature without harm; my young gentleman should 
therefore follow Nature rather than art in the matter 
of clothing, and so should wear no shoes; but as he is 
compelled to live in society, we will strike a compro- 
mise, and he may wear shoes, provided they are plenti- 
fully supplied with holes. 
The phrase “Education According to Nature” at 
 
-P-A-G-E-120

120 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
once suggests the name of Rousseau, for it was he who, 
in his “Emile,” fairly set the fashion for subsequent 
writers on education, great and small. Mr. Spencer 
adopts the new fashion, and his pages are overshad- 
owed with capital N’s. He accepts the new mythol- 
ogy, writes out a new creed, and virtually founds a 
new school of theorists. No theologian was ever more 
dogmatic. He postulates Nature as an infallible guide, 
and then deduces educational processes with almost 
mathematical precision. Whatever will not fit into 
his system, as history, he conveniently rejects. 
Rousseau was essentially a pessimist, placing the 
Golden Age in the distant past rather than in a dis- 
tant future. Civilization, so-called, was full of perver- 
sions and defilements; the arts and sciences were in- 
struments of corruption; and the only salvation for the 
race was a return to primitive simplicity and purity. 
As the main principle of political philosophy was the 
assumption that society was retrograding because it 
was receding from Nature, he readily adopted the con- 
ception that the salvation of society lay in a new sys- 
tem of education, whose purpose should be to bring 
men back to Nature, and thus to purity and to peace. 
The myth Nature dominated Rousseau’s thought, or 
rather his feeling; for he felt rather than reasoned.
-P-A-G-E-121
  
  EDUCATION ACCORDING TO NATURE 121 
Everything must be “natural,” even his children. Like 
Mr. Spencer, though in another manner, Rousseau 
was a rhetorician, enamored of the sound of his own 
voice; such rhetoric is always fatal to logic. He car- 
ries conviction, as the advocate or the orator does, by 
enlisting the feelings on his side of the controversy. 
Hence, his “Emile” is a romance, and the characters 
that appear in it are as unreal as any that one may find 
in modern fiction. And yet it is not a contradiction to 
say of it what Rousseau himself said of the “Repub- 
lic:” C'est le plus beau traité deducation quwon a 
jamais fait.” 
Though Rousseau nowhere defines Nature, it is not 
difficult to understand the general sense in which he 
uses this term. His whole creed is virtually contained 
in the opening paragraph of the “Emile”: “Every- 
thing is good as it comes from the hands of the Author 
of Nature; but everything degenerates in the hands 
of man. He forces one country to nourish the produc- 
tions of another; one tree to bear the fruits of another. 
He mingles and confounds the climates, the elements, 
the seasons; he mutilates his dog, his horse and his 
slave; he overturns everything; he loves deformity, 
monsters; he will have nothing as Nature made it, not 
even man; like a saddle horse, man must be trained
-P-A-G-E-122
122 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
for man’s service; he must be made over according to 
his fancy, like a tree in his garden.” 
; In other terms, restore the world to the condition it 
was in before it began to be modified by man’s agency, 
and we have it in its ideal state, “the state of Nature.” 
Relieve a modern garden from human interference, 
and it will soon revert to a state of nature. Natural 
fruit is better than fruit that has been cultivated. The 
ideal horse is the wild horse. The ideal man is the red     Indian. Education is not an ascent from wildness, 
but a return towards wildness. Rousseau admits men 
to his state of Nature provided they make no attempt 
to refashion one another or to modify their environ- 
ment. The moment they begin to do this, perversion 
sets in and art usurps the place of Nature. This per- 
version of Nature by art has gone to the greatest length 
in cities. Hence, relatively, we return to Nature when 
we go from the city into the country, as from Paris to 
the woods of Montmorency. 
How much of this is rhetoric, and how much sober 
conviction, it is doubtless impossible to tell with any 
exactness. In construing Rousseau’s theory we must 
make some allowance for temperament, and also for . 
the extravagances into which reformers invariably 
fall. Over-statement is an element in a reformer’s
-P-A-G-E-123

outfit, whether it takes the form of a satire, as in 
Rabelais and Dickens, or of fiction and fancy, as in 
Rousseau. All an interpreter can do is to trace the 
main lines of the argument and show the limitations 
of the theory by typical examples. This I will attempt 
to do in the sequel. 
The practical application of Rousseau’s theory is 
well exhibited in his doctrine of discipline by natural 
consequences. Through wilfulness, Emile breaks the 
windows of his chamber. His father replaces them, 
but the boy again breaks them. The transgressor is 
thereupon turned over to the relentless laws of Nature. 
The windows are not replaced, but the boy is confined 
to his room, where the cold wind blows on him by day 
and by night, thus exposing him, not only to disecom- 
fort, but to danger; he might take a severe cold and 
die of pneumonia. The great danger of this exposure 
occurs to Rousseau, but he promptly replies that it is 
better to die of a cold than to be a fool! In the case 
of Emile, however, matters do not come to this sad 
pass, but he is finally conquered by suffering the dis- 
agreeable consequences of his own folly and reforms 
in a manner befitting the author’s theory. 
The application of this doctrine is extended still 
further. To cure Emile of his vanity and forwardness, 
 
-P-A-G-E-124
  124 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
he is allowed to compete with a professional juggler, 
who readily makes him the laughing-stock of a jeering 
crowd. To teach him worldly wisdom and caution, he 
is allowed to fall into the hands of sharpers and cheats, 
who fleece him in fine fashion; and, finally, to make 
him virtuous, he is allowed to fall into vice—he is 
drawn through the mire in order that he may after- 
ward be washed and experience the sensation of being 
clean. In outline, this is Emile’s course in experi- 
mental ethics. 
Though Rousseau, as before noted, does not define 
Nature, he makes it quite easy for us to infer what he 
means by the term, and a proximate definition would 
stand about as follows: The material world affected 
by physical forces (gravity, heat, light, electricity, 
ete.,) and inhabited by uncivilized men. 
For purposes of right education, Emile is to be 
pushed as far back as possible into this primitive and 
uncorrupted world; and society itself, in order to be 
rescued from growing corruption, must make a return 
toward this primitive simplicity and perfection. This 
was Rousseau’s ideal education and his ideal state of 
society; but he had the sense to know that these ideals 
were impracticable, and so he accepts a compromise. 
He uses consummate art to reproduce a quasi state of 
 
-P-A-G-E-125
  
  EDUCATION ACCORDING TO NATURE 125 
mature, but this more than Herculean effort involves 
him in countless contradictions, absurdities and follies. 
Mr. Spencer personifies Nature, and thus carries the 
myth to its most perfect development. With him 
Nature is physical force personified, and education is 
experience, or contact with environment. His general 
theory may be summarized as follows: The individual 
of to-day must be educated just as the race was edu- 
cated historically; the race was self-instructed through 
‘experience; the individual must therefore rely on his 
personal experience for his knowledge and training. 
As Nature was the tutor of the race, so Nature must 
be the tutor of each individual of the race. Of course, 
in accordance with this theory, the knowledge that is 
of most worth is science, for science has grown out of 
the experiences of the race—is, in the Aristotelian 
sense, a natural product—and is knowledge that can 
be reproduced and verified by each succeeding genera- 
tion of learners. Past experiences constituting what 
is commonly known as history cannot be thus repro- 
duced and verified, and therefore history is not knowl- 
edge proper. And as literature—a play of Shake- 
speare, for example—cannot be rediscovered or repro- 
duced according to the Spencerian dogma, there is no 
natural place in this system for literature and kindred  
-P-A-G-E-126
  126 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
subjects. Literature is too much tainted with art to fit 
into a scheme of education according to Nature. 
Like Rousseau, Mr. Spencer is clearest when he ap- 
plies his hypothesis to moral education. Prior to ex- 
perience, an infant, if permitted, will put its little 
fingers in the flame of a candle. Let it do this, advises 
Mr. Spencer, even though a painful blister is the conse- 
quence.. According to the same method the child may 
lay hold of hot fire-bars and spill boiling water on its 
tender skin. In this fashion the infant is being edu- 
cated through experience by its godmother, Nature. 
This is a reappearance of Rousseau’s doctrine of conse- 
quences. From this point of view education may be 
defined as experience coming from contact with matter 
and with physical force, or in shorter phrase, with one’s 
environment. 
It may be urged against Rousseau and his disciples 
that the Golden Age of society is not in the remote 
past, but in the future—that humanity is making a 
forward movement, slow, perhaps, but sure; that what 
we call civilization will not be abandoned for savagery; 
that cities, Rousseau’s especial abomination, are both a 
product and an agent of civilization; and that his as- 
sumption of the nobility of primitive man is an unsup-
-P-A-G-E-127
EDUCATION ACCORDING TO NATURE 127 
ported fiction. The untutored savage, as seen and 
described by travelers, is Nature’s handiwork, a fair 
specimen of what she can do in the way of educating 
when unassisted by human art. It has not been ob- 
served, however, that men are made either happier or 
better by being allowed to revert to a state of nature. 
Again, a proper conception of Nature will include 
man, his endowments and his works. Is not man as 
natural a product as a beaver or a horse? If instinct 
is a natural endowment of the beaver, why are not 
reason, imagination and language also natural endow- 
ments of man? Why make a radical distinction be- 
tween the defenses built by beavers and the defenses 
built by men? Why is it less natural and right for 
men to live in communities than for bees and ants? 
Why is not a poem as natural a product as a bird’s 
nest? 
‘When Mr. Spencer asserts that “humanity has pro- 
gressed solely by self-instruction,” he either falls into 
an obvious error or he uses terms in an extraordinary 
sense. It would be as true to assert that humanity has 
progressed solely by capitalization. Men capitalize 
their experiences in labor-saving machines and in pro- 
verbs. One generation invents a snare, a trap, or a
-P-A-G-E-128
  128 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
hook; the next generation is spared the effort of 
making these inventions, but simply accepts and uses 
them, and devotes the time and effort thus saved to the 
making of other inventions. Experience begets wis- 
dom, this wisdom is embodied or capitalized in pro- 
verbs, and then these proverbs serve other men for 
warning and guidance in place of wasteful experience. 
Humanity has never squandered its time in reinvent- 
ing and rediscovering. The “genesis of knowledge 
in the race” takes place through capitalization and dis- 
covery, and thus understood, it is quite true that the 
individual must follow the same course. Mr. Bain is 
evidently right in declaring that the assumption that 
the child’s education is to be in the main a process of 
discovery or of rediscovery is a “bold fiction.” In 
some subjects, as mathematics and physical science, 
rediscovery is conceivable, but, in the main, impracti- 
cable; while in others, as history and literature, it is 
impossible, if not inconceivable. Mr. Spencer’s hy- 
pothesis of Nature as the true guide in human educa- 
tion easily runs into the reductio ad absurdum. Let 
us see where this specious hypothesis will land us. 
This Nature is simply brute matter or brute force, 
absolutely divested of feeling, without sympathy and
-P-A-G-E-129
EDUCATION ACCORDING TO NATURE 129 
without pity; the teacher should therefore be the per- 
sonification of brute, unfeeling force. 
In her distribution of pains and penalties Nature 
never distinguishes between innocence and deliberate 
transgression—the same punishment falls on the in- 
fant as on the hardened criminal; the teacher is there- 
fore to take no account of motive, but must regard the 
fact of transgression only. 
Nature makes no distinction between a block of 
wood that falls from the roof of a house and a child 
that tumbles from a chamber window—for her use 
they are merely two pieces of matter, which she treats 
in the same manner, or, if she makes any distinction 
at all, she favors the block of wood, life and feeling 
here being at a discount; children should therefore be 
manipulated, shaped and governed as though they were 
inert, senseless matter. 
There are no gradations in Nature’s lessons; she 
deigns no explanation, she is as silent as a sphinx. 
The graded school is therefore unnatural, and the 
teacher should be merely a stern and silent monitor. 
I call attention to these absurdities, not because 
they are sanctioned by Rousseau and Spencer, but 
because they show the near limitations of this specious 
doctrine of Nature. Both these writers set up Nature 
9 
 
-P-A-G-E-130
  130 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
as a criterion and guide, and they quote her in a free 
and easy way as standard authority for certain educa- 
tional processes. Their argument runs in this wise: 
“Nature does so and go; therefore we should do so and 
so.” But, evidently, this Nature does some things 
that no sane or moral man should ever think of doing. 
Mr. Spencer allows a little child of three or four years 
to lay hold of hot fire-bars with his little hands, but 
objects to his playing with an open razor. It is plain, 
therefore, that Nature is not to be followed at all 
lengths. Who is to decide how far, or in what cases, 
we are to follow Nature? Some who have had larger 
experience in the management of children than Mr. 
Spencer has probably had, would stop short of the fire- 
bars and the boiling water. It is a reasonable pre- 
sumption, therefore, that we are not here dealing with 
science, but with opinion; and that it is an open ques- 
tion, not only how far we should follow Nature, but 
whether we should follow her at all; seeing how un- 
natural she sometimes is and how questionable some of 
her proceedings are. 
Instead of accepting the poetical fiction that Nature 
(still using the term in the Spencerian sense) is our 
goddess and our guide, some of us who have not the 
fear of the new mythology before our eyes would
-P-A-G-E-131
EDUCATION ACCORDING TO NATURE 131 
respectfully maintain that this same Nature, in some 
of her work, should be disinfected, deodorized, and 
otherwise prevented from doing her worst. Only give 
her a fair chance, and Nature, in the form of scarla- 
tina, diphtheria, or cholera, will decimate whole vil- 
lages and cities. In such and all similar cases Nature 
is a remorseless, relentless fury, who is to be pursued, 
captured and thrown headlong into the sea and mis- 
erably drowned. In other terms, and dropping the 
figure, the joint work of Christianity, science and 
civilization is to subdue Nature, to make her man’s 
servant rather than man’s master, to make her minister 
to his joys rather than to his sorrows. There is to be 
a new earth, rescued from Nature and transformed by 
human art, and it is to be peopled by a race recreated 
by education and the gospel; and throughout this 
secular process the dominant force is to be the human 
intelligence and the human will. The Nature that 
we are to follow is “Nature humanized,” or “Nature 
informed with humanity,” to adopt the happy phrase 
of Richard Grant White. 
So far, the treatment of my theme has been nega- 
tive, in the main; the purpose being to show that the 
hypothesis of Nature as a faultless paragon is subject 
to grave limitations; that this general doctrine is very
-P-A-G-E-132
  132 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
far from being safe and wholesome; and that, like all 
other fads, it seizes upon a fraction of a truth, fancies 
that it is the whole truth, and then proclaims the new 
marvel to the world with a cackling of delight. 
I will now venture on a more positive treatment of 
this theme, and, putting entirely aside whatever is 
mystical or mythical, will try to state in plain prose 
some of the things that seem to be implied in education 
according to Nature. I hope my readers will do me 
the favor to remember that my purpose in this dis- 
cussion is not controversy, but the discovery of truth. 
I aim at nothing more than interpretation. The 
writers who invoke Nature so persistently and so freely 
make no attempt whatever to define the term; they 
leave their readers to interpret the word for them- 
selves. 
In dealing with the precept “Follow Nature,” the 
task of the interpreter is twofold: (1) To determine 
what Nature is and what she does; and (2) to deter- 
mine whether it is wise to follow her in the cases 
stated. At this stage of educational science it is high 
time to disregard fiction, myth and personification, 
and to give to this vague term an articulate meaning. 
My interpretation of the term Nature may not be the 
correct one, but it is an honest effort to reach the truth,
-P-A-G-E-133
| EDUCATION ACCORDING TO NATURE 133 
Those who reject any given interpretation owe it to 
the cause they are attempting to serve to state in plain 
terms their own interpretation. 
The one word that most nearly interprets Nature, 
as it seems to me, is experience, and to follow Nature 
is to make experience the sole or the main source of 
our knowledge and discipline. It is usually said that 
there are two sources of knowledge—experience and 
language; but the precept “Follow Nature” forbids 
the intervention of language as a source of knowledge, 
and makes the process of learning a course in personal 
experience. ixperimental knowledge, it is claimed, 
is the only real knowledge; all we truly know is in- 
cluded within the circle of our personal experiences, 
of our sensations, and of the inferences we draw from 
them. Rousseau sequesters Emile, so far as possible, 
from the society of men, in order that he may be 
tutored by Nature; that is, by experience. Instead of 
the mother, Mr. Spencer makes the candle flame, the 
fire-bars, and boiling water the teachers of the child. 
Primitive man, we are told, had no teacher but expe- 
rience; the successive generations of men have gained 
their knowledge in the same way; experience is there- 
   
-P-A-G-E-134
  134 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
fore the typical process of human education, the only 
royal road to learning. 
A few tests applied to this theory would seem to 
show its general unsoundness. Is history knowledge? 
On the hypothesis that the real test of knowledge is 
experience, there can be no such thing as historical 
knowledge, for we cannot be brought into personal 
relations with the events which have given rise to his- 
tory. 
Is our knowledge of geography limited to what we 
have learned by travel? May we be said to know any- 
thing of the countries we have never visited? I once 
had a pupil who was a thorough convert to the Spen- 
cerian doctrine that there could be no knowledge 
where there was no personal experience. “Have you 
ever been abroad?” I asked. “No.” “Then do you 
know that there is such a city as London?’ “No.” 
“How would you gain this knowledge?” “I would go 
there.” “How would you know when you reached 
there?” So authority confronts us on every hand— 
the new theory broke down at this point. 
Again, on this hypothesis, what is the function of 
 
-P-A-G-E-135
  
EDUCATION ACCORDING TO NATURE 135 
books? Possibly Mr. Spencer may have learned all 
his philosophy from his own observations and reflec- 
tions; but, on his own hypothesis, why does he write 
so many books for other men to read? Scholarship 
and culture have always meant and will ever mean a 
loving devotion to good books. 
I venture to say that the following statements are 
substantially true: 
The process we call civilization is the triumph of art 
over Nature, and is a mark of human progress. Men 
will not renounce the essential concomitants of civili- 
zation and revert to a state of Nature in pursuit of 
happiness or moral good. The men of each new gen- 
eration will start forward from the vantage ground 
secured for them by their predecessors on the earth. 
They will accept and use the labor-saving machines 
which they inherit from the past, and, without wasting 
time and strength in the effort to reinvent, they will 
capitalize their own experience and wisdom in some 
other or better labor-saving devices. 
The knowledge gained by experience and experi- 
ment is capitalized and transmitted in books, and the 
great mass of men in each new generation will gain 
their knowledge by the interpretation of the books 
left by the wise and the good. The pretense lately set
-P-A-G-E-136
  136 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
up, that students in science are to gain their knowledge 
inductively, by personal research in the way of redis- 
covery, isa shallow fad. It would be just as reputable 
to counsel men to construct their own almanacs. Try 
to imagine a class of even university students attempt- 
ing to rediscover the atomic weight of chlorine, or even 
the specific gravity of iron! If we commit ourselves 
to such folly at all, why not be radically and consist- 
ently foolish, and set about reinventing the apparatus 
of the modern laboratory? Students should certainly 
have some training in physical manipulation and ex- 
periment, not on the pretense of rediscovery, but 
rather as a means of initiation into the processes of 
modern scientific research. The culminating absurdity 
of this doctrine of rediscovery is vivisection, which, 
as practiced in all ordinary cases, is nothing less than 
a crime. 
Can virtue, in an intelligible sense, be capitalized, 
transmitted and taught, so that in the moral life each 
generation may start from a higher vantage ground; 
or must we be remanded to an experimental ethics, as 
our reformers would remand us to experimental 
science? This question cannot be argued at this time, 
but a little reflection will show that the world can 
grow better only on the hypothesis that the attainment 
BPs
-P-A-G-E-137
EDUCATION ACCORDING TO NATURE 137 
of virtue is made somewhat easier for each succeed- 
ing generation. In other words, virtue can be taught; 
each child is not to construct a code of ethics out of 
his own experiences, but is to accept the highest code 
of ethics that humanity has bequeathed to him. 
Interpreting Nature in the sense of experience, or 
contact with environment, which is the prevailing 
sense in which Rousseau and Spencer use this term, 
and speaking only for myself, I find but little that is 
really helpful in the stock precept “Follow Nature,” 
save this: It serves to keep alive the fact that learn- 
ers are ever in danger of mistaking words for things, 
and so guards us against an education that is purely 
“livresque,” as it has been styled. Thomas Hobbes 
uttered the same caution when he declared that “words 
are wise men’s counters, but the money of fools.” 
I find much more help in a side conception which 
appears in the “Emile” as a sort of undertone—that 
there is an imminent tendency of civilization toward a 
distracting and unwholesome complexity, and that the 
need of the age is a return to simplicity. Rousseau’s 
illustration of his meaning is very happy. Speaking 
of teaching children to read, he says: “We no longer 
know how to be simple in anything. Look at the ma- 
chines we invent for teaching children to read—eabi- 
   
-P-A-G-E-138
138 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
nets, charts, and what not—all uscless lumber. We 
do everything save the one thing essential, creating in 
the child a desire to read; do this, and all methods are 
good.” As I interpret this phase of Rousseau’s edu- 
cational philosophy, it is this: Follow main routes; 
abandon bypaths; strike at creative motives; occupy 
strategic or dominant positions. Educate as artists 
paint—begin with broad stroke, leaving details for 
after consideration. Imitate the unity of Nature, and, 
instead of reducing a child to fractions, treat him as 
an integer, making his education wholesome and hu- 
mane. 
The stress we put on training is the symptom of a 
general unsoundness. A trained horse or a trained pig 
is not a normal and wholesome horse or pig, but an 
animal artificially shaped and fashioned into a frac- 
tion or fragment. A thin glaze of bookkeeping con- 
verts an ignorant boy into a writing or adding ma- 
chine, and unfits him for the functions of a man pro- 
per. Teachers are now being trained rather than edu- 
cated, and these fractions tend to perpetuate frag- 
ments. The one great merit of the kindergarten is 
that it keeps children whole and allows them to grow 
by an organic process into symmetrical units. The 
danger of the graded school, and even of the college,
-P-A-G-E-139
EDUCATION ACCORDING TO NATURE 139 
is stratification—the deposition of knowledge in layers 
by specialists; and the remedy for this and kindred 
evils is a return to a wholesome simplicity of Nature— 
to an education according to Nature. 
In a more specific sense, we follow Nature when we 
adapt our instruction to the organic mode of the mind’s 
activities. The mind is an organism having its own 
predetermined mode of activity. This constitutes its 
nature; and when we respect this order of procedure 
in the presentation of knowledge, we may with scien- 
tific accuracy be said to follow Nature. When the 
mind works naturally—that is, in accordance with the 
laws of its organization—it proceeds from aggregates 
to parts, from the vague to the definite, and, in child- 
hood, from the concrete to the abstract; and the teacher 
follows Nature when he allows the mind to elaborate 
its knowledge in this order. 
In conclusion, I venture to offer this bit of advice 
to those who are trying to make of their teaching a 
rational art: In your thinking and writing never al- 
low yourself to personify the term Nature, but leave 
the mythologist, the poet, and the novelist in sole pos- 
session of this deity.

A THEORY OF EDUCATION VALUES 
Tue thesis that I aim to present is as follows: 
Studies serve three main purposes and therefore have 
three main values. They serve for discipline, as a 
mental gymnastic; they endow the mind with instru- 
mental knowledge, or knowledge for guidance; and 
they serve for delight. Studies will thus fall into 
three classes, corresponding to three mental needs— 
disciplinary studies, instrumental studies, and culture 
studies. 
In the prosecution of this inquiry, we shall be well 
started on our way by recollecting that studies have 
their distinctive qualities or properties, just as mine- 
rals, vegetables and other natural substances have. In 
its characteristic qualities history is as distinct from 
algebra as bread is from quinine, and it would be as 
gross an error to prescribe history at random as to pre- 
scribe quinine at random. 
And another thing, about as obvious, is also true. 
It is just as easy to discover the characteristic qualities 
of studies as of minerals and vegetables. In both cases 
we may proceed in one or both of two ways. We may
-P-A-G-E-144
  144 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
examine the thing itself and thus discover its nature 
or properties, or we may examine its effects when ap- 
plied to use, and in this way discover its nature or 
properties. Whenever the results of these two pro- 
cesses agree, we have absolute proof that our conclu- 
sions are valid. The mechanic, wishing to construct a 
plow beam, has before him two pieces of wood, oak 
and whitewood. He need never have made plow 
beams out of these two kinds of wood to know that oak 
is fit, and whitewood unfit, for his special purpose. 
Just so experience in results is not needed in order to 
distinguish a training subject from a culture subject; 
a critical examination of the subjects themselves is 
quite sufficient to determine that point. Still, the con- 
sensus of enlightened opinion as to the observed re- 
sults of studies is a valuable aid in determining edu- 
cation values, for it cannot fail to be true that the 
long-continued observation of educated men as to the 
actual outcome of various studies, mathematical, lin- 
guistic and scientific, should be substantially accurate, 
just as the collective opinion of medical men as to the 
effects of drugs must be accepted as trustworthy by 
the students of medical science. This inquiry does not 
lie in the region of hypothesis and conjecture, but in 
the clear field of science, where certitude is possible.
-P-A-G-E-145
  A THEORY OF EDUCATION VALUES 145 
The science of education values is both qualitative 
and quantitative—qualitative in an exact scientific 
sense, and quantitative in the same sense that the tem- 
perature of water is quantitative: high or low, as 
determined by a thermometer. 
It is only this science of values that can furnish ra- 
tional answers to such questions as these: On what 
ground has the study of algebra been made universal 
in our high schools? What rational defense is there 
for the study of the classics? Such inquiries arise with 
reference to every subject that is taught in our schools, 
and if education is ever to become a rational art, there 
must be established a science of education values, just 
as there must be a science of food values before there 
can be a science of dietetics. 
The question of method is also involved in this in- 
quiry. If two teachers of chemistry, or of literature, 
hold different views as to the major purpose of these 
studies, they will follow different routes and therefore 
adopt different methods. It is to be assumed that each 
instructor knows the major effect of his subject, and 
therefore its major value, for on no other assumption 
can he be presumed to concentrate his skill in such a 
way as to make his art effective. Nay, how can a 
teacher be said to have an art unless he keeps clearly 
10
-P-A-G-E-146
146 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
in view a definite end to be reached? The first element 
in school economy is therefore a knowledge of the 
value of studies. 
In this discussion two facts will be assumed, as 
follows: 
  Every subject has some major or characteristic | 
value, and also one or more subordinate or minor | 
values. This major value is its normal or natural 
value, a value inherent in the subject itself, resulting | 
from its very constitution and not created by human . 
device. By express effort, or through ignorance, a | 
subject may be perverted from its natural use, and | 
what is essentially a minor value may be made a major 
value, and thus its wholesome effect lost. Thus, what 
is naturally a culture subject may by perversion be 
made a disciplinary subject, and so lose its major value. 
Perversions in use usually follow this line; they are 
all lapses into training. 
The second fact to be assumed is that the future 
vocation of students is unknown, that their education 
is general or liberal, and not special or technical. The 
whole scheme of values is disturbed the moment we 
come to deal with students who are studying for spe- 
\Y cial vocations. We must assume that we are serving 
| ‘the intellectual and moral needs that are common to
-P-A-G-E-147
A THEORY OF EDUCATION VALUES 147 
all men, quite regardless of their special vocations. 
All men, regardless of their special occupations, must 
be taught to read and write, for these instrumental 
arts are necessary to the conduct of life; but, for prac- 
tical ends, chemistry need not be taught to all men, 
‘since the world may be served by a few chemists, as it 
is served by a few doctors and lawyers. 
This is one of the oldest of speculative questions. 
Plato discusses the education value of arithmetic, 
geometry and dialectic, and Aristotle, of music and 
painting; and in modern times the subject has been 
taken up anew by Lord Bacon, Dr. Whewell, Sir Wil- 
liam Hamilton, Alexander Bain and Herbert Spencer. 
Only two of these writers attempt any classification 
of studies, Lord Bacon and Dr. Whewell, and of these 
classifications Lord Bacon’s alone is sufficiently analyti- 
cal to be scientific and valuable. His well-known state- 
ment is as follows: “Studies serve for delight, for 
ornament and for ability. Their chief use for delight 
is in privateness and retiring; for ornament, is in dis- 
course; and for ability, is in the judgment and dispo- 
sition of business.” In substance, and with a little 
modification, this is the classification that I shall pro- 
pose. 
I suppose no one nowadays would recommend a 
   
-P-A-G-E-148
  148 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
study merely because it is “ornamental;” that is, be- 
cause it will enable one to shine in conversation. But 
if we construe the term “ornamental” in a wider sense, 
so as to include the art of pleasing, the studies that 
serve this high purpose have a legitimate place in a 
scheme of values, and will be considered in another . 
place. It is equally obvious, from the phraseology 
and from the context, that Bacon includes two things 
under the term “ability’—a habit or disposition of 
mind expressed by the term “judgment,” and the 
turning of a study to practical account in the “dis- 
position of business.” When he says that “studies 
serve for delight,” he evidently refers to the contem- 
plative pleasures that come from a_ well-furnished 
mind. With one retrenchment, and with this legiti- 
mate amplification, and expressed in modern terms, 
Lord Bacon’s classification stands as follows: Studies 
serve three main purposes, and therefore have three 
characteristic values. They serve for mental disci- 
pline, for guidance in affairs, and for contemplative 
delight, and therefore have three normal or natural 
values: (1) Disciplinary, (2) Practical, and (8) Cul- 
tural.

Bacon fully realized the disciplinary value of studies 
is abundantly shown by the following statement: “His- 
tories make men wise, poets witty; the mathematics 
subtle; natural philosophy deep; moral; grave; logic 
and rhetoric able to contend. Abeunt studia in mores 
(studies terminate in manners). Nay, there is no 
stond or impediment in the wit but may be wrought 
  out by fit studies, like as diseases of the body may have 
appropriate exercises. Bowling is good for the loins 
and reins, shooting for the lungs and breast, gentle 
walking for the stomach, riding for the head, and the 
like. So, if a man’s wit be wandering, let him study 
the mathematics, for, in demonstrations, if his wit be 
called away never so little, he must begin again. If 
his wit be not apt to distinguish or find differences, let 
him study the schoolmen, for they are cymini sectores. 
If he be not apt to beat over matters, and to call up one 
thing to prove and illustrate another, let him study 
the lawyers’ cases. So, every defect of the mind may 
have a special receipt.” 
In this notable quotation we have the clearly cut 
conception of study as a mental gymnastic. The gen- 
eral philosophy that underlies this fact is easy to dis- 
cover. Milo, the athlete, as Quintilian affirms, by 
lifting the calf day after day, was, in the end, able to 
 
-P-A-G-E-150
150 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
lift the ox. Mind and muscle agree in this fact that, 
by being taxed, they acquire new power and skill, and 
this is what we mean by discipline. When the mind 
is engaged in study, its powers are necessarily taxed, 
and the reflex effect is discipline, so that all studies 
must have some kind and degree of disciplinary value, 
the kind and degree depending on the nature of the 
study and the intensity of the effort. Mathematics and 
history call into exercise different modes of mental 
activity, and therefore produce different kinds of dis- 
cipline. Again, in some cases, the mind works at high 
tension, at a white heat, under the whip and spur, 
while in other cases it is in a quiescent, almost passive 
state, very like the state of a sensitive plate in a 
camera, receiving impressions rather than creating 
them. In respect of mental tax or tension, the dif- 
ference between reading Kant’s Critique and Dickens’ 
Oliver Twist is immeasurable, very like the difference 
in respect of muscular effort between climbing the 
Alps and gliding through the country in a palace car. 
The reflex effect of this tax is what we call discipline, 
and is subject to the following law: If the reflex effect 
is to be cumulative, the tax must be cumulative also, 
the utmost that a uniform tax can do being to preserve 
the status quo. To resolve the quantity «*—y* into 
 
-P-A-G-E-151
A THEORY OF EDUCATION VALUES 151 
  its factors for the first time requires considerable effort, 
and this effort yiclds considerable discipline; but the 
repetition of this analysis for the thousandth time en- 
dows the mind with no new power. C'est le premier 
pas qui coute. This principle shows us the wisdom 
of allowing students to struggle with difficulties, as- 
sisted, at most, by suggestion, and the folly of making 
his tasks easy—of converting work into play. 
The conception of power and skill, as aims of dis- 
cipline, admits of some analysis, as follows: 
Insight or penetration: the power to make a mental 
analysis of a phenomenon and to discover its secret 
cause; as, e. g., the motive which underlies human 
conduct. 
Comprehension: the power to classify phenomena 
or facts according to their essential marks, and to deal 
with wide classes rather than with single instances. 
Versatility: the power to apply general principles 
to the solution of new cases, or to meet vicissitudes 
with composure and success; fertility in resources. 
Good judgment: the ability to see things in their 
true relations, and from these relations to draw correct 
conclusions. 
Discrimination: the power to note minute but 
essential differences, to look below surface resem-
-P-A-G-E-152
  152 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
blances, and to distinguish from one another objects 
seemingly alike. 
Mental, like physical gymnastics, aims at whole- 
ness, soundness, perfection, at what is hale, hearty and 
robust. To this end it must curb an exuberant faculty 
and stimulate to activity a faculty that is either weak 
or dormant. It is true alike of mind and of body that 
“unto every one that hath shall be given; but from 
him that hath not shall be taken away even that which 
he hath.” When, by nature or use, a mode of activity 
has become easy and therefore pleasurable, it makes 
its way with an ever swelling tide, and drains other 
modes of activity of their just opportunities. That a 
student has a marked predilection for a certain study 
is proof that his mind is a facile instrument in one 
main line of activity, and may be a valid reason why 
he should be excused from this intellectual pursuit; 
while marked unsuccess in another study indicates a 
dormant or undeveloped faculty, and may be a valid 
reason why the study should be maintained, even un- 
der painful pressure. That a student dislikes a study 
is no good reason in itself why he should be excused 
from it. There is some truth in the ascetic doctrine 
that one’s appetencies should be suppressed and his 
repugnancies disregarded. All that is said in this para-
-P-A-G-E-153
  A THEORY OF EDUCATION VALUES 153 
graph proceeds on the hypothesis that symmetry and 
wholeness are postulates in the art of education. 
Much of the skill that is ascribed to the hand is 
really located in the head. Thus, one may never have 
employed the left hand in writing, but in case the 
right hand is disabled, its fellow, without any training 
whatever, will come to the rescue and write, not only 
legibly, but in the usual style of letters. Evidently, 
the origin of this potential skill is in the mind. 
While the immediate condition of discipline is exer- 
cise, its fundamental condition is nurture. Perhaps it 
ig nearer the truth to say that discipline is the joint 
effect of nurture and exercise. Nurture produces or 
maintains growth, that is, addition to structure, but 
volume is not discipline, that is, power and skill; while 
exercise, without nurture, is wasting and weakening. 
From the standpoint of mere discipline, the mind is 
an intellectual machine with all its parts in perfect 
working order and ready on the instant to obey the 
voice of motive and to execute the manifold behests 
of the will. It is a mighty engine, ready to move at 
the voice of command on any one of a thousand routes, 
or to turn out any one of a thousand products; but 
without this voice of command, without the mental 
and the moral fiber that gives coherence and strength
-P-A-G-E-154
  154 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
to its working parts, without the propelling force of 
will and emotion, and without instrumental knowl- 
edge, it is a beautiful but useless piece of spiritual 
mechanism. Discipline is an essential element in edu- 
cation, but it is only one of three codrdinate elements. 
What has now been said under the head of discip- 
line may be summarized as follows: 
Discipline is the reflex effect left on the mind by 
the studies and pursuits that call into play its energies, 
or tax its powers. 
As every study requires either a maximum, a me- 
dium, or a minimum of mental effort, it will have one 
of these three degrees of disciplinary value. 
For purposes of discipline, the mind must work at 
high tension, or under continuous strain, and the tax 
on its powers must be cumulative. 
Discipline as a process creates power and converts 
this power into skill. 
Some of the special intellectual qualities included 
under the term are insight or penetration, comprehen- 
sion, versatility, good judgment, discrimination. 
Discipline should aim at wholeness, soundness, sym- 
metry; and to this end it must follow a system of curb- 
ing and stimulation. 
Distaste for a study, when not the result of poor
-P-A-G-E-155
A THEORY OF EDUCATION VALUES 155 
instruction, results from a dormant or imperfectly de- 
veloped state of the activities which this study requires, 
and indicates wise stimulation by the very study 
which the mind seems to reject. 
In its origin manual skill is a mental endowment; 
it is the creative and directive mind that communicates 
delicacy and deftness of touch to the fingers. 
Discipline creates an instrument that is useless with- 
out will, motive, moral power and instrumental knowl- 
edge. 
II. Wisdom is Profitable to Direct.—From studies 
disciplinary we now pass to studies instrumental—that 
is, to studies that furnish the mind with its working 
tools. We must distinguish the hand, with its strong 
muscles trained to deftness, from the tools which it 
employs in the execution of its work; the bent bow 
with its cord stretched to high tension, from the tipped 
arrow waiting to be sent to the target. However well 
trained or disciplined the mind may be, it is a useless 
instrument unless furnished with its appropriate tools, 
these tools being the studies or knowledges which the 
mind may employ in the performance of its manifold 
functions. It should be almost as easy to distinguish 
the mind from these instrumental possessions as to dis- 
tinguish the artisan from his assortment of tools. But 
 
-P-A-G-E-156
  156 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
these tools, these saws, chisels, and planes, are but 
secondary; the box of primary tools is the artisan’s 
head with its ideas or working plans, its knowledge of 
matter and its laws, and its knowledge of tools and 
their uses; for without this knowledge how could he 
know what to saw, when to saw, and how to saw? At 
this stage of our inquiry the important thing is to dis- 
tinguish the items of instrumental knowledge as pos- 
sessions of the mind quite distinct from the mind itself. 
This is what we mean by practical knowledge, knowl- 
edge that the mind can employ in the solution of prob- 
lems, in the doing of work, in the calculation of results, 
in the execution of plans, or, more concretely, in build- 
ing houses, in curing diseases, in pleading suits, in 
writing sermons, in educating children, in piloting ves- 
sels, in making treaties, in conducting a campaign, in 
cooking a dinner, in buying and selling, and so on 
without end. If one limitation to beneficent doing is 
lack of skill, another and greater limitation is lack of 
knowledge. It is not said that people perish for lack 
of skill, but for lack of knowledge. When language 
was young and speech picturesque, knowledge was 
light, light-giving, enlightening; it was a lamp to the 
feet and a light to the path. Just as in the dark we 
throw a light ahead of us to guide us on our way, so 
 
-P-A-G-E-157
  A THEORY OF EDUCATION VALUES 157 
in the conduct of life we throw the light of knowledge 
upon the problems we have to solve, and so trace our 
course with certainty and success. Light is an instru- 
ment, and the most beneficent of all instruments. 
To show how old these truths are that we are dis- 
cussing, and how clear was the distinction between the 
mind as an instrument, and the knowledge held for its 
guidance, observe this quotation from Hcclesiastes x., 
10: “If the iron be blunt and he do not whet the edge, 
then must he put to more strength; but wisdom is pro- 
fitable to direct.” Here we see the blunt, untrained 
mind, doing its work only by dint of painful effort, 
contrasted with the sharp, incisive mind, doing its 
work easily and deftly; and in the final clause we have 
the conception of knowledge as light—“profitable to 
direct.” It is with this last conception that we are now 
dealing. 
Easy illustrations of instrumental knowledge are 
found in every profession, art and trade where special 
knowledge is employed in the application of means to 
ends, or in the production of effects by the use of 
mown causes; as, when an alkali is applied to flesh that 
is burning with an acid, or when sulphur is thrown into 
the grate to quench a fire in the chimney, or when a 
decision is quoted to throw a case out of court, or when 
    
 
-P-A-G-E-158
  158 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
the forge fire is sprinkled with water to increase the 
heat, or when an impending examination is used to 
spur a class to diligence, or when a fact in history is 
used to impress a lesson in political economy. Politics 
as an art consists in the deft manipulation of motive. 
As man is a gregarious animal, his most pressing need 
as a social creature is communication with his fellows; 
and to this end he turns to hourly and momentary ac- 
count his knowledge of symbols, and so resorts to 
speech, to writing, to the telegraph, to the telephone; 
at sea, to the language of flags and whistles, and on 
railroads to colored lights and signals. The hourly 
use of computation in the transaction of business is a 
familiar illustration of the instrumental value of 
knowledge. Man might be defined as the animal de- 
voted to the conversion of knowledge into the uses and 
utilities of hourly life. 
For the purposes contemplated in this discussion it is 
necessary to mark the distinction between knowledge 
that is directly instrumental and knowledge that is in- 
strumental indirectly or at second hand. The instru- 
mental value of telegraphy is incalculable, but one 
may enjoy all the practical benefits of this art without 
having any personal knowledge of it whatever; that is, 
telegraphy confers its benefits on the great mass of
-P-A-G-E-159
A THEORY OF EDUCATION VALUES 159 
mankind through a few specialists; its instrumental 
value is of the secondary or indirect order. The same 
is true of every variety of professional and technical 
knowledge. One does not need to be a hatter to enjoy 
the use of hats, or a physician to participate in the 
benefits of the healing art, or a chemist to profit by the 
utilities of this science. This truth may become clearer 
by contrast. Thus the instrumental value of reading, 
writing and simple computation is of the direct order; 
that is, we must all know and practice these arts in 
order to participate in their benefits; they do not com- 
monly serve us by proxy. It follows from the distinc- 
tion just made that there are certain kinds of knowl- 
edge that all men should have for self-guidance, while 
there are many other kinds of knowledge which serve 
them by proxy; they do not need to know them in 
order to enjoy all their practical benefits. Our courses 
of study contain many subjects that the average stu- 
dent will never turn to practical account; they are to 
be defended on other and higher grounds. 
This narrowing down of knowledge whose instru- 
mental value is of the direct or primary order has been 
brought about by the division and specialization of 
labor and it will happen as this process is extended that 
the volume of directly “practical” knowledge will
-P-A-G-E-160
160 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
grow smaller and smaller; that is, men will more and 
more employ the knowledge of specialists, will more 
and more specialize their own activities, and will re- 
duce to a narrower and narrower compass the knowl- 
edge which is required for self-direction and self-help; 
individual effort will become less extensive bat more 
intensive, it will cover a smaller field but will go down 
deeper, men will do fewer things but will do them bet- 
ter, and the vast field of knowledge will be cultivated 
less and less for its practical utilities, but more and 
more for the edification and perfection of the human 
personality. 
“Studies that serve for ornament,” to repect Ba- 
con’s phrase, have their place under the head of in- 
strumental studies. On occasion it may be our direct 
purpose to please, to entertain, as in telling a story, 
reciting a poem, singing a song, playing a piece of 
music, or acting a drama, and the studies that serve 
this high purpose have an instrumental value in ex- 
actly the same sense in which trigonometry has an 
instrumental value to the surveyor. There is an art 
of pleasing, just as there is an art of making shoes, and 
those who practice this art must master certain studies 
and then turn them to practical account as the tools 
of their trade.

III. Studies Serve for Delight—We have now 
come to the consideration of certain studies whose 
value lies, not in their use as instrumental knowledge, 
nor in the discipline which they impart, but in mere 
possession, and in the contribution which they make 
to the moral life of the soul. We must distinguish 
between the instruments of the kitchen and the adorn- 
ments of the parlor, and ask ourselves such questions 
as these: In what does the education value of a vase, 
or of a painting, consist? What educative purpose 
does ornament serve? Is there a value in mere pos- 
session quite independent of any utility into which it 
may hg converted? What is the major educative value 
of travel? What is the highest purpose served by a 
piece of literary art? For purposes of education, is it 
desirable to cultivate happiness, serenity of spirit, and 
composure of mind? These questions will exhibit the 
scope and direction of this branch of our inquiry. 
‘When Bacon says that it is “in privateness and re- 
tiring” that studies serve most for delight, he evi- 
dently turns aside from the world of utilities, from all 
consideration of what we shall eat or of what we shall 
drink or of what we shall put on, and directs our 
thoughts to that higher region of the contemplative 
life where the soul is maturing its powers, acquiring 
il
-P-A-G-E-162
  162 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
new graces, fortifying its purposes, purifying its mo- 
tives, and in this state of isolation and retirement pre- 
paring itself for new conquests in the lower regions 
of active life where the law of service compels men to 
be instruments. In discussing the value of arithmetic, 
Plato expressly distinguishes the lower world of com- 
mercial life from that higher world of the contempla- 
tive life where the soul dwells in serenity and peace 
while maturing its heaven-aspiring powers. 
This higher region of the spiritual life cannot be 
defined in such a way as to cut it off from the lower 
regions of the purely intellectual life, but some of its 
marks or characteristics may be noted, as follows: 
It is the region of feeling, affection, emotion, as dis- 
tinguished from the region of mere thinking. The 
intellectual discernment of an object, and the loving 
or hating of that object, are irreducible phenomena; 
neither can be expressed in terms of the other. All 
that we can say is that the intellectual discernment 
must come first, and that the clothing of the object 
with the halo of feeling is a subsequent phenomenon; 
that the two phenomena originate in different regions 
of the spiritual life, and that what is most truly hu- 
man in man is his purified and exalted emotion. The 
problem of moral education would be solved if there
-P-A-G-E-163
  A THEORY OF EDUCATION VALUES 163 
were an art of investing the objects of thought and 
perception with the best emotional attachments. This 
would not only make the will operative, but it would 
always work in right lines. It is not mere feeling that 
is wanted (animals and savages have enough of that), 
but feeling that has been chastened, purified, and dis- 
ciplined by the regal understanding. A pure heart, 
the home of saintly emotions and holy aspirations, is a 
higher attainment than a wise head garnished with the 
most brilliant intellectual endowments. 
The spiritual life is also the region of ideals. An 
ideal may be defined as a perfected idea with an at- 
tached feeling of admiration which often constitutes 
a motive or stimulus for realizing higher effects. 
Plato held that the work of creation was accomplished 
by means of ideas, patterns, or types, held in the 
divine mind and embodied in the objects of his crea- 
tion. Thus, every tree is a copy, more or less imper- 
fect, of a divine pattern laid up in heaven. The divine 
idea is thus the divine ideal; the pattern is perfect, is 
seen to be good, and is employed by the creative en- 
ergy in constructing the visible world. In human 
experience, however, the case is different. The men- 
tal picture left in the mind when we have observed a 
tree is an idea of a tree, but it is imperfect because the
-P-A-G-E-164
  164 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
tree itself is imperfect; but out of all our ideas or 
mental pictures of trees we construct a new pattern or 
type, embodying the excellencies of all, and invested 
with added perfections by the creative power of the 
human soul, and this last pattern or type is an ideal. 
The works of creation are therefore the interpreters 
of the divine mind; so our ideals help us to come a 
little nearer into the divine presence, and to under- 
stand more fully the divine purpose and thought. 
Work of high quality, whether by the artist or the 
artisan, is dependent on the formation and possession 
of wholesome ideals. In one of its highest aspects the 
art of education is the art of creating ideals. 
It is the region of reverence and of worship. Man’s 
emotional and affectionate nature reaches its culmina- 
tion in reverence and worship—that homage which 
the heart pays to what is supreme in goodness and 
power. Affection purifies and ennobles by bringing 
us into likeness with the object of our affection. We 
idealize what we love, and thus are insensibly trans- 
formed by our aspiration after the perfection that we 
ascribe to the object of our affections. The supreme 
transforming power is reverence, adoration, worship; 
and the measure of human greatness is the degree to 
which the nature has been transformed and renewed
-P-A-G-E-165
A THEORY OF EDUCATION VALUES 165 
by a pure spiritual worship. If the region of the in- 
tellect is holy, this region of the higher emotions is the 
holy of holies; and the education that has failed to 
affect the soul in these higher movements has fallen 
short of its truest mission. 
It is the region of emotional and judicial calm. 
One of the last and highest attainments made by the 
human soul in its upward progress is a settled state of 
emotional repose, of judicial calm, of genial serenity, 
of inward peace. In order to put forth all its powers 
and to attain to its predetermined and possible perfec- 
tion, the soul must finally establish this inner court 
or sanctuary where emotional storms never penetrate 
and where the fruits of righteousness may mature in 
peace, and into which the spirit, weary and worn, may 
retire for comfort and strength. That education is 
vain, and that religion is vain, which does not culmi- 
nate in this repose of the passions and the emotions, 
and in a dominant state of serenity and peace. The 
route to this supreme attainment is not through insen- 
sibility and fatalism, but through wide intelligence 
and sharp conflict, through a lifting of the intellectual 
horizon and a chastening and purification of the emo- 
tions. 
It is the region of faith and hope. It is through 
   
-P-A-G-E-166
166 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
faith and hope that we escape the hard limitations of 
matter and sense, gain some grasp on the unseen and 
the eternal, and thus manifest our essential divinity 
and immortality. It is through faith that man main- 
tains fellowship with his kind, and it is through faith 
that he maintains fellowship with his creator. Faith 
is the sure and steadfast anchor to the soul. The life 
that has lost its buoyancy and spring has degenerated 
into the lower regions of the animal and the vegeta- 
tive. It is hope that gives to life its buoyancy and 
spring, and therefore the man who has lost hope has 
ceased to be a man. For the maintenance of hope, 
life must have an outlook, a vista through which dis- 
tant glories may be discerned. The opening of such 
vistas is a prime function of education and study. 
It is the region of the contemplative life. When 
Plato declares that the educated man should be “the 
spectator of all time and all existence,” he evidently 
refers to the inner contemplative life, as distinguished 
from the outer, active life, where the energies ex- 
pended are physical rather than spiritual. Men with 
the weight of the world’s betterment and redemption 
upon them have found it necessary to withdraw from 
society for a period, in order to give themselves up 
to contemplation, and to mature their purposes and to
-P-A-G-E-167
  
A THEORY OF EDUCATION VALUES 167 
renew their spiritual strength in solitude. What is 
so essential to great men is, in a measure, essential to 
all men. All men need intellectual and spiritual per- 
spective, and to this end they must resort to the con- 
templative life, where the soul, in peace and repose, 
can enter into communion with itself. All men must 
do something, but the condition and support of the 
outer, instrumental life is the contemplative, reflec- 
tive life, which fits men to be something. 
It is the region of character. . Two steel cables may 
be identical in weight and appearance, but under 
equal stress one may break while the other holds. 
We ascribe the difference to internal constitution or 
fiber, to some invisible but real quality inherent in 
the matter or metal of the cable. And so when men 
break under the stress of circumstances we ascribe the 
fault to some weakness or flaw in that moral fiber of 
the soul which we call character. We are again in a 
region where exact definition is impossible, but we 
may say that the fundamental element in character is 
will, or the focusing of energy on effort. This deter- 
mining power of the soul is largely constitutional and 
is innate, but as the antecedent to will is motive, or 
emotion, we gain some control over the will by the 
creation or manipulation of motive, so that a strategic
-P-A-G-E-168
  168 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
point in moral education is the culture of the feel- 
ings. But the current of feeling may set in strongly 
towards a given course of action which the will may 
suddenly reverse or inhibit, stemming or overcoming 
the flood tide of emotion. This veto power comes 
down from the intellect as the prerogative of the 
dominant reason. Another strategic point is there- 
fore a broad and prophetic intelligence that can dis- 
cern the remote consequences of proposed lines of 
conduct. The operations of the intellect affect char- 
acter in still another way. High states of feeling 
prevent clear and effective thinking, and, conversely, 
vigorous thinking allays or checks the vehemence of 
feeling. Now character, in order to be judicial, must 
be protected from emotional storms, and so it happens 
that a mind addicted to thinking produces that “quies- 
cence of the emotions” which is favorable to the 
prevalence of right conduct. It is also to be noted 
that when the higher emotions are dominant, the 
lower or dangerous emotions are either suppressed or 
checked. A man who finds pleasure in literary, scien- 
tific or artistic pursuits is in little danger of the 
pleasures that pervert and degrade. 
All educational effort should terminate in charac- 
ter, for character is the highest aim of the teacher’s
-P-A-G-E-169
A THEORY OF EDUCATION VALUES 169 
art. Studies that are directly tributary to this end 
transcend in importance studies whose major value 
is of the disciplinary or of the instrumental type. 
Comenius rightly defined the school as an officina 
humanitatis, a manufactory of men, and were this 
conception generally prevalent, studies of the hu- 
mane or culture type would regain the standing which 
they held in a less “practical” age. 
With this outline well in view, we may now con- 
sider some of the questions raised in another place in 
this essay. 
It must be apparent, even on a slight examination, 
that only a few of the studies embraced in the ordi- 
nary curriculum can be converted into instrumental 
uses by the general student. For example, what is a 
valid defense for the study of astronomy in school or 
college? It is evident that this science as a whole 
cannot be converted into a correlative art. For the 
most part, astronomical laws are entirely beyond 
human control; the knowledge of them cannot be 
made instrumental by man in the satisfaction of his 
needs or in the execution of his purposes. Neither 
can it be said that the study of astronomy, as it is 
pursued by the general student, has such a marked 
disciplinary value as to give it a permanent place in  
-P-A-G-E-170
  170 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
our courses of study. The very best, and indeed the 
only, answer that can be returned to this question is 
the declaration of the Psalmist: “The heavens de- 
clare the glory of God and the firmament showeth his 
handiwork.” The one culminating effect left on the 
soul by this study is admiration, awe, reverence, wor- 
ship. It isa spiritual tonic, refreshing, inspiring, and 
lending a subtle potency to the very substratum of 
character. 
You stand under the glorious dome of St. Paul’s, 
you traverse the aisles and chapels of Westminster 
Abbey, you sit in rapture before Rubens’ “Descent 
from the Cross,” you linger and dream in the earthly 
paradise of the Lake District, or you listen to the 
peals of the great organ as they reverberate through 
“the long-drawn aisles and fretted vaults” of Durham 
Cathedral. What is the grand outcome of it all? 
Have you gained anything that you can sell for 
money or convert into food, dress or shelter? Or, if 
you could, would you sell it? Would you not rather 
keep it as a priceless possession than to convert it into 
any mere utility? 
In matters educational we are so accustomed to 
raise the question of utility at every step, to inquire 
anxiously the money value of this or that study, and
-P-A-G-E-171
A THEORY OF EDUCATION VALUES 171 
to ask how each branch of knowledge will contribute 
to our “getting on in the world,” that we have prac- 
tically lost sight of the fact that there is often a 
supreme value in mere possession, without any 
thought of conversion into instrumental uses, that 
an acquirement often serves its highest purpose sim- 
ply as a source of contemplative delight. What ac- 
count are we to render of the paintings that hang on 
our walls, or of the ornaments that stand on our man- 
tels? Are we to be picture venders or dealers in bric- 
a-brac, in order to realize the value of our art pos- 
sessions? This would be to ruin their natural and 
proper value; such a perversion would be but little 
short of sacrilege. The noblest value of such art 
treasures lies in their possession and enjoyment; the 
fact that they “serve for delight” is their sufficient 
vindication. 
Money lying untouched in a bank often has a 
higher value than money that is expended in food and 
raiment. In the way of an abiding and bracing sense 
of security, a deposit has a moral value that far 
transcends the value of money that is employed in 
mere utilities. The moral value of life insurance is 
incalculable. The person insured does not hope to 
realize any return or profit from his investment, but
-P-A-G-E-172
  172 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
his rich reward is found in the feeling that his provi- 
dence will protect the objects of his affection. This 
feeling of security is a moral tonic that is a stimulus 
in health and a medicine in illness. 
What is here set down as true of material posses- 
sions is equally true of those spiritual treasures which 
the soul acquires through studies—those possessions 
which are chiefly valuable because they yield us con- 
templative delight. We cannot barter them for 
bread or raiment, nor can we make them the instru- 
ments of personal guidance, but their higher service 
is the “sweetness and light” which they diffuse over 
the soul, and the tone and spring which they give to 
character. A poem is neither a commodity nor an 
instrument, but its subtle spirit enters into the very 
structure and fiber of the soul, endowing it with 
serenity and poise, while, as a work of literary art, it 
is a perennial source of contemplative enjoyment. It 
affects conduct through character, just as food affects 
conduct through structure. The value of religious 
literature does not lie in rules and maxims that are 
directly convertible into conduct, but in its power to 
transform and renew the human soul. 
The office of the esthetic in human education and 
in ordinary life has not been sufficiently considered.
-P-A-G-E-173
  
A THEORY OF EDUCATION VALUES 173 
I have two pencils costing, respectively, one cent and 
five cents. Their instrumental value is the same; 
they both serve me equally well in writing. Why 
should one cost four cents more than the other? Evi- 
dently because in form and finish there is an element 
of attractiveness or beauty in the one which has a 
money value. Even in such a little thing as a lead 
pencil we pay heavy tribute to the wsthetic. But this 
dual quality of utility and beauty is universal; it 
inheres in everything we buy or possess, in every in- 
strument we use, in furniture, in dress, in every form 
which matter is made to assume for human use. And 
thus, in the cosmos as a whole, what exuberance, what 
prodigality, we might almost say, what waste of 
beauty! In field and forest, in mountain and plain, 
in the heavens above, in the earth beneath, which is 
the dominant note, utility or beauty? I think the 
astonishing but real fact is that the visible world is 
primarily and chiefly a cosmos, a thing beautiful, and 
that utility is a secondary and subordinate purpose in 
its creation. This human cradle is sometimes hard, 
but it is adorned with tree and flower and canopied 
with blue and gold. While man is embodying more 
and more of the beautiful in everything that is fash- 
ioned by his hand, nature still outdoes him by creating
-P-A-G-E-174
  174 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
things that are wholly beautiful, things in which 
there is no vestige of the useful. Beauty is their 
sole and sufficient excuse for being. As studies at 
best are but a transcript of nature, why should not 
education be a reflection of the cosmos? In other 
words, why should not the dominant note in educa- 
tion be the esthetic, as distinguished from the utili- 
tarian? Food and drink and clothing are all neces- 
sary, but they are subordinate to the kingdom of God, 
which is not meat and drink, but righteousness, and 
peace, and joy. This having been attained, all the 
other things will be added. 
Studies whose major value lies in their humane and 
culture effect have some or all of the following char- 
acteristics: 
They have a large human interest; they touch man 
in what is most intensely human, his hopes, his fears, 
his aspirations, his affections, his destiny; they pul- 
sate with life and feeling, and endow the individual 
with the accumulated moral power of the race. 
They refer to some imposing unit that impresses, 
the mind by its vastness or magnitude, or to some 
living, organic whole that excites human interest 
through the phenomena of life. 
They give breadth and perspective, create a sense
-P-A-G-E-175
  A THEORY OF EDUCATION VALUES 175 
of mastery and power, and endow the mind with mag- 
nanimity and tolerance. 
They give contemplative delight, disposing the 
soul to serenity and peace, and fortifying it against 
the vicissitudes and calamities of life. 
As the question of method is necessarily involved 
in this subject, it is entitled to a brief consideration. 
In his “Education,” Mr. Spencer utters a dictum 
to the following effect: The genesis of knowledge in 
the individual must be the same as the genesis of 
knowledge in the race. In other words, the individual 
must gain his knowledge just as the race gained its 
knowledge. Then follows this deduction: as the race 
gained its knowledge inductively by experience, the 
individual must gain his knowledge by experience, 
experiment or observation. He makes his dictum 
still stronger by declaring that the individual can 
gain his knowledge in no other way. 
Following this eminent authority, some modern 
teachers insist that whenever the subject permits it, 
it should be learned, not as literature, as Matthew 
Arnold advises, but by personal experience and ex- 
periment; that in science, especially, the student 
must actually discover or rediscover by his own per- 
sonal effort what the race has learned during its cen- 
 
-P-A-G-E-176
  176 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
turies of history. This theory virtually throws books 
out of court and reduces the rdle of the teacher to 
little more than suggestion or guidance; he must not 
communicate anything on his own account, he must 
not interfere with the natural and necessary law 
which Mr. Spencer has so clearly and so authorita- 
tively announced. Without discussing this subject at 
length, I submit these observations which I think will 
commend themselves to the common sense of all. 
In that large and very important domain of knowl- 
edge known as the historical, the inductive or experi- 
mental method absolutely fails. Historical events 
cannot be reproduced, and therefore cannot be 
brought within the range of the student’s experience. 
The facts of history must be learned out of books, 
learned as literature. And, then, in literature and in 
art, how is it possible to put the student in the place 
of the original writer or artist, and evolve his knowl- 
edge by any kind of experience such as this theory 
requires? 
In science proper, where this theory is practicable 
if anywhere, it is applicable only in a modified form 
and to a limited extent. In any one science—as 
chemistry—to throw the pupil on his own resources
-P-A-G-E-177

and to require him to discover or even rediscover the 
atomic weights, would be a farce; but when a half 
dozen sciences are to be treated in Mr. Spencer’s 
fashion within the student’s ordinary term of study, 
the business becomes a piece of mere stupidity. 
The whole question reduces itself to this: Shall 
we ride or shall we walk? If the route is short and 
pleasant, and we have an abundance of leisure, we will 
walk, but if the journey is a long one, and tedious in 
whole or in part, and we are pressed for time, we will 
ride. In fact, riding has become the normal mode of 
travel, and the little walking that is done is merely 
incidental. A trip to the Matterhorn by railway 
would please all save a few reckless enthusiasts. The 
whole world might then indulge in Alpine travel. 
Books are to scholars what railways are to travelers, 
and to condemn books, as some prolifie bookmakers 
are accustomed to do—Plato, for example—is as 
senseless as to condemn bicycles, railway carriages 
and steam vessels. The millions who need to learn 
geography must learn it out of books rather than by 
personal travel, and the same thing is true of all the 
sciences. 
If there is any department of knowledge where 
Mr. Spencer’s theory can be applied, it is that of phi- 
12 
 
-P-A-G-E-178
  178 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
losophy, where all the material is within the reach of 
every man who has a head. But even here Mr. Spen- 
cer thinks it wise to lighten the student’s burden by 
doing the most of his thinking for him, and so invites 
him to read the volume of his “Synthetic Philoso- 
phy.” If this justly distinguished philosopher were 
Joyal to his own announced creed, his vocation would 
be gone. 
In the third place, Mr. Spencer’s assumption that 
the race has gained its knowledge solely by personal 
experience in the way of discovery is conspicuously 
and profoundly untrue. The race as such has made 
no discoveries in science, has created no livcrature, 
has made no original advances in ethics or religion, 
has not in any real sense been even studious; but in 
every age it has crucified, stoned and persecuted its 
prophets and seers, and has stoutly resisted every 
attempt to lead it up to higher planes of intellectual 
and moral attainment. In every age the race has 
been saved by a mere remnant, and the utmost it has 
done for its own progress is to accept under protest, 
in a spirit of defiance and hatred, some of the lessons 
which its teachers have set for it. The picture of the 
race engrossed in study, and with knitted brow at- 
tempting to read the book of nature and to solve the
-P-A-G-E-179
  A THEORY OF EDUCATION VALUES 179 
riddle of existence, is truly ‘bucolic, but wholly imagi- 
nary—it lacks every trait of fact and reality. What- 
ever advance the race has made towards the higher 
intellectual and moral life, it has made reluctantly 
and haltingly, always under stress, and with many 
backslidings. Rather than sit on hard benches and 
learn the daily lessons of wisdom, it has learned to 
play truant and to vex and harass its teachers. In 
every age a half dozen men have done the thinking 
for the race, in science, in philosophy and in religion, 
and to-day the race is a century behind its thinkers 
and teachers. The race has made progress, not by 
making original discoveries through personal re- 
search, but by accepting the discoveries made by its 
exceptional geniuses and scholars, and it is in this 
way, in the main, that the individual is to gain his 
knowledge. The volume of capitalized knowledge is 
ever becoming greater and greater, and the mastery 
of this knowledge through the interpretation of books 
is to be the main occupation of the student. The real 
additions to existing knowledge will be made by a 
half dozen men in the course of a century, so that the 
main function of schools and teachers is diffusion 
rather than discovery. 
The question will be asked whether there is not a 
 
-P-A-G-E-180
  180 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
place for actual observation and experiment in the 
study of science. Most assuredly, but not under the 
delusion that the purpose is discovery or rediscovery. 
In physics, the actual manipulation of apparatus is 
invaluable, because it gives a comfortable sense of 
reality to the study, as well as an introduction to the 
modes and processes of scientific investigation. The 
pretense sometimes set up that students under ordi- 
nary conditions are to reach independent conclusions 
by a course of inductive study is a sort of pious fraud, 
useful mainly to bookmakers and to pedants. When 
this theory of critical and independent study is ap- 
plied to literature and art, the results are most deplo- 
rable. In these departments the critical spirit is un- 
seemly and mischievous, even in the higher courses 
of instruction; but when in grammar schools, or even 
in colleges, students who barely have the gift of ap- 
preciation presume to sit in judgment on the works of 
poets and painters, and to express ew cathedra opin- 
ions on their merits and demerits, the sight is sicken- 
ing. What a school of modesty, respect and rever- 
ence! 
Mr. Spencer pleads the “beautiful economy of na- 
ture” to support his declaration that the studies that 
are best for guidance are also the best for discipline.
-P-A-G-E-181
  A THEORY OF EDUCATION VALUES 181 
This case illustrates the vice of the high a priori 
method in philosophy. The assumption of “nature” 
as a faultless guide is a pure fiction, and any argument 
based upon it is unworthy of serious attention. 
Whether a good disciplinary study is also a study 
that is equally good for guidance is a mere question 
of fact, and all the facts in the case point to an oppo- 
site conclusion. For example, algebra is a better dis- 
ciplinary subject than arithmetic, but for the general 
student is nearly valueless for guidance; and in arith- 
metic itself the parts that are the most remote from 
the student’s daily needs, such as the roots, pro- 
gressions, etc., are the parts that yield the highest 
discipline. An interest table, a mere machine, is far 
more “practical” than the doctrine of percentage, but 
no one will say that the daily use of such a table has 
any appreciable disciplinary value. It would be far 
nearer the truth to say that the studies that yield 
themselves the most readily to guidance are the least 
valuable for disciplinary purposes. 
The main positions taken in this chapter will now 
be recapitulated in the form of a general summary. 
Studies are the agents which the teacher employs 
in the practice of his art, and if his practice is to be
-P-A-G-E-182
  182 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
rational he must needs know the education value of 
these several agents. 
Skill in teaching consists in ministering wisely to 
the wants of the mind and soul, and so the first ele- 
ment in the teacher’s professional knowledge is psy- 
chological. 
The first need of the uneducated mind is discipline, 
or the endowing of its activities with power and skill; 
and corresponding to this need there are studies whose 
preéminent value lies in the fact that they are a men- 
tal gymnastic. 
Another need of the mind is instrumental knowl- 
edge, or knowledge that can be converted into per- 
sonal guidance, or into the utilities of life; and cor- 
responding to this need there are studies whose major 
value consists in their ready convertibility into guid- 
ance and utility. This instrumental value of knowl- 
edge is either direct or indirect; that is, it accrues to 
the individual through his own abilities, or it reaches 
him indirectly through specialists. 
An organic need of the soul is serenity, poise, con- 
templative enjoyment and a chastening and purifying 
of the emotional nature as the basis of character; and 
responding to this need there are studies of the cul- 
ture type, whose supreme value lies in the fact that 
 
-P-A-G-E-183
A THEORY OF EDUCATION VALUES 183 
they “serve for delight;” that they are breadth- 
giving, pleasure-giving; that they generate moral 
power and reénforce character; and that they endow 
the soul with judicial poise and calm. 
Studies, therefore, serve three distinct purposes, or 
supply three distinct organic needs, and hence have 
three distinct values: disciplinary, instrumental, and 
culture. These values may be tabulated as follows: 
Disciplinary Direct 
Epvucation Vauuss < Instrumental { 
Indirect Culture ° 
Every study has a characteristic or major value, 
and one or both of two minor values. Every study 
has a disciplinary value, high or low, and it often hap- 
pens that the studies most valuable for discipline have 
a low value for guidance. 
Disciplinary studies require the mind to work at 
high tension, under stimulus and stress; but the mind 
may deal with culture studies while in a state of com- 
parative repose, simply receptive rather than active. 
The conception that learning is to be a process of 
rediscovery, in which the pupil is to repeat the expe- 
riences of the race, is “a bold fiction.” The attitude 
of the learner must often be that of simple acceptance 
on faith, and much that has been originally acquired 
 
-P-A-G-E-184
  184 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
by slow and painful inductive effort must now be 
learned as literature, by the reading and study of 
books. We may now ride where the pioneers in 
learning were obliged to walk; we may draw water 
without the labor and cost of digging a well; we miss 
the discipline of pioneer toil, but we have immeasu- 
rable gains in “sweetness and light.”

Ir is my belief that the almost universal antago- 
nism between students and their instructors, and the 
existence of a code of school morality quite distinct 
from that code of morals that obtains outside the 
school, are due in large measure to an injustice, not 
to say immorality, originally introduced into exami- 
nations by instructors themselves. By means of his 
examination paper a teacher may make himself the 
arbiter of his pupil’s fate; he can condemn him to any 
desired degree of ‘humiliation, can block his progress 
in the school, and can send him home in disgrace. 
By constructing his paper on unjust principles, or by 
looseness or injustice in the management of results, 
a teacher may decimate his class and spread a con- 
sternation throughout the school that is demoralizing 
to the last degree. In the hands of ian unwise or un- 
just teacher, the examination paper becomes a sort 
of Gatling gun mowing down its score of hapless vic- 
tims. Woe to the school where this instrument of 
tremendous power is used unwisely or maliciously! 
It creates secret hostility between teacher and pupil; 
   
-P-A-G-E-188
188 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
arbitrary power, unjustly exercised, is offset by tricks 
and frauds on the part of the victims; and the school 
becomes the scene of sorry encounters between those 
who should be united by the ties of a common in- 
terest and a common respect. I have purposely 
thrown this dark side of examinations into sharp out- 
line, for it is my purpose ‘to find a. cure, if possible, 
for the evils that have sprung from the misuse of an 
instrument that is in itself not only valuable, but in- 
valuable. 
Leaving out of present consideration the purposes 
served by an examination as a motive and a discipline, 
I will discuss its use as a test. 
An examination properly conceived and conducted 
puts to the proof both the wisdom and the skill of the 
teacher and the degree to which the pupil has profited 
by his opportunities. During a term of weeks a 
teacher has been expending his wisdom and skill in 
the production of a desired result—some proficiency 
of his pupil in knowledge, some gain in mental dis- 
cipline, some addition to culture and moral power. 
Simply as an artist, on his own personal account, he 
needs to know with some exactness the degree of his 
success. For this purpose he can do no less than 
resort to an examination of his work, to an inquest 
a»
-P-A-G-E-189

for results. The mason must try his wall by the 
plumb line, the seaman his course by compass and 
chronometer, the political economist his theories by 
statistics, every successful workman his work by 
methods in keeping with the nature of his craft. 
Teacher and pupil are codrdinate factors in the 
work of education. The teacher has duties to himself 
and to his pupil; the pupil, duties to himself and to 
his teacher. The pupil must be responsive to his op- 
portunities, and from time to time should give proof 
that he has been loyal to duty. In subjects where 
there is logical sequence he must make it clear that 
he has a knowledge of the lower topic sufficient to 
justify his admission to the higher. For these pur- 
poses some test must be applied, not the same in all 
eases, but varying with the nature of the theme and 
with the nature of the product to be tested. As it is 
at this point that examinations so often break down, 
attention must be called to some distinctions in sub- 
jects as seen from an examiner’s point of view. 
The subjects included in a course of study serve 
different purposes, produce different results, and have 
different values. In some cases the desired end is 
knowing, in others doing, and in still others being. 
In some cases the mind must work at high tension,
-P-A-G-E-190
  190 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
every power alert and in a state of intense activity; 
‘in others the mind is chiefly in a receptive attitude, in 
a state of repose, simply absorbing the impressions 
made upon it, without putting forth any conscious 
volitional effort; and in still others there is a middle 
state of activity, the grasping and holding of material 
by the power of the memory. In other words, there 
is a maximum, a minimum and a medium of mental 
exertion and effort. So far as subject matter is con- 
cerned knowledge is either employed to generate 
power, somewhat as dumb-bells are used to strengthen 
the muscles, or it quietly passes into structure by a 
process of absorption and assimilation, or it is simply 
held in the mind as useful furniture ready on occa- 
sion to be turned to practical account. The mind 
must often be made to work at high tension, under 
the lash and goad, and the justification of this pro- 
cedure is discipline; study and recitation are a mental 
gymnastic, and the teacher a trainer or gymnasiarch. 
But at the other extreme, the mind must often be al- 
lowed to work at low tension, in a state almost passive, 
in an attitude of repose favorable to nourishment and 
growth. I am coming to think that this is the normal 
mental state, the only state favorable to that organic 
growth which constitutes character. In all of its
-P-A-G-E-191
  EQUITY IN EXAMINATIONS 191 
highest aspects education is growth, and all true 
growth, as we know, is insensible, unconscious; of the 
fact or result of growth we may become conscious, 
but not of the process. Give the mind food in proper 
quantity and of proper quality, and growth, in the 
main, will take care of itself; if any stimulus is needed 
let it be gentle. 
‘We should divest ourselves of the conceit that the 
main purpose of the school is drill. If all the teach- 
ers in a school were drillmasters, the school would 
soon become converted into an asylum of lunatics, of 
imbeciles or of cranks. The situation is saved by the 
so-called “easy subjects,” for which we sometimes feel 
the need of making an apology. If periods of com- 
parative repose did not alternate with periods of high 
pressure and mitigate their severity, education in its 
real sense would become impossible, and the mind 
would lose its just balance. An ideal in education is 
yet to‘be realized: to make a fair adjustment between 
disciplinary studies and culture or growth studies, 
and by way of relief introduce into subjects which 
lend themselves most readily to drill, something that 
will regale, nourish and refresh. Let us temper gym- 
nastic with music, using this term in Plato’s sense. 
Let us gain firm hold of the notion that the mind
-P-A-G-E-192
    192 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
must be fed as well as trained; that nurture should 
not only accompany training, but that wholesome and 
liberal nurture is the essential condition of training. 
Let us also acknowledge another codrdinate truth: 
that with the mind as with the body, when training 
passes a certain point it not only prevents growth, 
but leads to perversion and distortion of structure. 
The law, both of physical and of mental gymnastic, 
is this: make training subsidiary to development and 
growth; do not insist on it for its own sake; use it 
simply as a means to a higher end. 
From an examiner’s point of view, the subjects con- 
stituting a course of study may be distinguished as 
follows: 1. Knowledge or information subjects; 2. 
disciplinary subjects; 3. culture, growth, or humane 
subjects. Owing to the circumstance that a given 
subject, in addition to its major or characteristic 
value, has one or two minor values, these classifica- 
tions overlap, but the main lines of demarkation may 
be determined without serious trouble. It is also to 
be observed that by a special method of instruction 
the natural use of a subject may be sacrificed to a 
perverted use, and its proper classification destroyed. 
Again, the elementary parts of a subject may fall
-P-A-G-E-193
  EQUITY IN EXAMINATIONS 193 
under the first description, while the advanced parts 
pertain to the second or to the third classification. 
Whe following may be taken as examples of knowl- 
edge or information subjects: tables of weights and 
measures, names and dates in history, local and de- 
seriptive geography, mere facts of physical science, 
the precepts of hygiene, and, in general, the “litera- 
ture of knowledge.” 
All subjects necessarily have some degree of dis- 
ciplinary value, for they can be learned only by some 
degree of mental effort, ‘high of low;* but certain 
subjects produce the disciplinary effect in a preémi- 
nent degree, while their practical and culture effects 
are either nil or very small. The disciplinary studies 
of the common school course are grammar, the ad- 
vanced parts of arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and 
trigonometry. 
The subjects whose preéminent value is their con- 
tribution to culture and growth, which give breadth, 
moral power and contemplative delight, are geogra- 
phy, history, literature, science, art, music. 
This whole discussion assumes that the instrumen-

-P-A-G-E-194
  194 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
ta: arts of speaking, reading, writing and spelling 
have been adequately learned; they condition study, 
recitation and examination. If this were a study, of 
values, instead of examinations, these arts would be 
considered under the head of practical studies. 
In conducting an examination in knowledge sub- 
jects, it must be assumed that nothing can be revealed 
but matters of fact. It is not a-question of opinion, ° 
of taste nor even of judgment, but simply of fact; 
and the questions proposed by the examiner should 
require of the pupil nothing but statement of fact. 
‘When the examiner’s questions have been correctly 
answered, what inferences are to be drawn? At least 
within the region of the inquest, there must have been 
diligence, attention, memory and recollection. This 
is all that can safely be inferred from correct answers. 
The important thing to note is that by means of such 
examinations. nothing definite can be inferred as to 
the higher qualities of the mind and spirit, such as 
judgment, taste, reflection, versatility, insight, 
breadth, skill, ete. Doubtless all examinations must 
deal more or less in matters of fact, and for this rea- 
son it is important to understand how very limited is 
the range of inference which such matter allows. 
When we advance to subjects of the second class
-P-A-G-E-195
EQUITY IN EXAMINATIONS 195 
we enter a wider and more fruitful field of inquest. 
The searchlight of the examination penetrates farther 
and illuminates wider regions of the mind and spirit. 
The question is not merely, what is the fact? but, 
what use can you make of this fact? In this region 
the mind can be made to exercise its power of doing, 
as distinguished from its power of knowing. Having 
learned the rule of Square Root, the pupil may be 
required to extract the square root of an assigned 
number; or, having learned the principle of Cube 
Root, he may be required to demonstrate the princi- 
ple of Fourth Root. And so in grammar, knowing 
may be easily converted into doing. Not only do the 
principles and rules of grammar lead directly to the 
constructive effort, but the art of parsing is the art 
of classification, an art that requires the nicest insight 
and the best powers of judgment. The mere art of 
reasoning is best learned from mathematical drill, 
but the application of this art to contingent or proble- 
matic matter is best learned from the classification 
of words. Parsing is strictly a logical process, but 
before this process can begin, the sentence as a whole 
must be interpreted, and as the interpretation varies, 
the marks of words also vary, so that this exercise 
calls into play the balancing of probabilities. The
-P-A-G-E-196
  196 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
real import of grammatical discipline will become 
more apparent as we reflect that its problems are the 
very type of the problems that are of hourly occur- 
rence in human life. Another point in favor of gram- 
matical discipline is the fact that it is concerned, not 
with abstract quantities, as in mathematics, but with 
what is intensely vital and human—thought expressed 
in significant words. I call attention to these facts 
to show what significant inferences may be drawn 
from an examination in the disciplinary subjects. 
The mind is not exhibited in its passive state, holding 
in its possession certain furniture, but as an active 
power devoted to its characteristic function, thinking. 
I would say, then, that a prime purpose of an exami; 
nation in what may be termed art subjects should be 
to discover the pupil’s ability to think. In this, as in 
the former case, it should be noted that the region of 
the emotions, feelings, taste, of all that is most truly 
human, is left for the most part untouched; there is 
little or no revelation of the real inner life. 
Exception will no doubt be made to the composi- 
tion of the third group of subjects. For example, the 
study of the sciences will be recommended by some 
on the ground of their practical value, and by others 
they will be placed in the second group, because, when
-P-A-G-E-197
  EQUITY IN EXAMINATIONS 197 
taught inductively, they form such an admirable dis- 
cipline. In the first place, the day has forever passed 
when every man is to be his own doctor, lawyer, hat- 
ter and chemist. By reason of the minute division of 
labor most of the so-called useful subjects have be- 
come useful only ina secondary or indirect way. Men 
may participate in the practical benefits of chemistry 
without having any personal knowledge of this 
science, just as they wear hats and coats without being 
hatters and tailors. In the second place, considering 
the fact that a student must learn a half dozen 
sciences within three or four years, the attempt to 
teach these subjects in a manner that is in any ade- 
quate sense inductive, is a pretence and a sham. I 
hold that the sciences have a higher and a nobler pur- 
pose, that of explaining and interpreting to us the 
universe in which we live. The sciences have but 
little direct practical value to people in general; as 
they must necessarily be taught, they have a dis- 
ciplinary value only in a secondary degree; but their 
major value is of the culture or human type. They 
contribute breadth, enjoyment, reverence, poise, se- 
renity. 
There will be no dispute as to the rank and office 
of literature in a scheme of education. “The true 
 
-P-A-G-E-198
  198 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
reason why literature should have precedence over 
all other subjects of instruction is that it is a sort of 
free and living philosophy. It is a general outlook 
upon the world, first upon the world of sense and 
imagination, the first with which the child comes in 
contact, and then upon the intellectual, social and 
moral world; it is a series of dissertations on art, 
morals and science. Literature is something even 
more than this. It is, we might say, the very beat- 
ing of the heart of humanity, a beating which must 
be communicated to all if we do not wish to have it 
cease.”* Ancient classics have been very properly 
called the humane studies, or the humanities, because 
of their effect on character and life, and modern 
classics have a right to the same distinction and desig- 
nation. By a perversion of use, an English classic is 
sometimes made a vehicle for teaching etymology, 
linguistics and history, and by a sort of ultimate 
analysis is spoiled as a work of literary art, sacrificed 
to the demon of thoroughness and drill. There is a 
sort of proximate analysis that enhances the sense of 
organic unity in a work of art, and up to this point 
it is helpful and to be commended; but any analysis 
that breaks the spell of artistic unity is fatal to the 
*Fouillé,
-P-A-G-E-199
  EQUITY IN EXAMINATIONS 199 
noble uses of any work of art, be it a statue, a paint- 
ing, or a poem. 
It is only by some perversion of use that geogra- 
phy, history and literature lend themselves to drill. 
They constitute a trio of humane or culture studies 
whose purposes may be thus defined: 
The purpose of geographical study is to make the 
pupil acquainted with the dwelling place of the race; 
of historical study, to make him acquainted with the 
notable deeds of the race; and of literary study, to 
acquaint him with the best that the race has done in 
the way of creating ideals of human excellence in 
thought, conduct and aspiration. 
I believe that any one who meditates long and se- 
riously on the educational problem and on the nature 
of the various subjects constituting a course of study, 
will feel more and more disposed to enlarge the third 
group of subjects and to assign less and less value to 
the so-called practical studies in a scheme of general 
education. If the objective point in education is 
manhood, character and a high type of life, then the 
first place must be given to those studies which are 
breadth-giving, inspiring and humane. 
From the outline thus far given I now deduce the 
following rule of practice for individual teachers:
-P-A-G-E-200
  200 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
Form a clear conception of the nature and purpose 
of your subject; teach it in a manner to accomplish 
this purpose in the most direct and efficient way; and 
then resort to an examination that will discover the 
eatent to which this purpose has been accomplished. 
I now turn to the question of the examination 
paper and the principles on which it should be con- 
structed. The first principle seems to me to be this: 
in its scope, the examination paper should be restricted 
to the field of study actually traversed by the pupil 
under the guidance and direction of the teacher. 
It is manifestly unfair and unjust to spring sur- 
prises on the pupil by demanding what he has not had 
an opportunity to learn. As a preparation for setting 
an examination paper, the teacher should ask himself 
these questions: “What ground have I traversed with 
this class? What knowledge have I given these pupils 
a perfectly fair opportunity to gain? What degree 
of constructive power over new combinations have 
they had an opportunity to acquire?’ What I want 
to insist on is absolute fairness in these dealings with 
students. I have known at least one instance wherein 
one-half of an examination paper bore upon matter 
which the class had never had the opportunity to 
learn. The first effect of this paper was dismay, and
-P-A-G-E-201
EQUITY IN EXAMINATIONS 201 
then a determination to offset wrong by wrong, so 
that pupils who never cheated before now resorted to 
cheating with a will. 
‘Another principle, or rather the first principle 
stated in a different form, is this: An examination 
paper should represent the state of the pupil’s mind 
rather than the state of the teacher’s mind. 
This is very far from being a needless caution. 
We are all in danger of putting too high value on 
our acquisitions, especially when they are in any 
sense unique or exceptional. With this feeling it is 
natural to give such acquirements an airing, and the 
examination paper furnishes an attractive opportu- 
nity. Instead of putting ourselves as much as possi- 
ble in our pupil’s place, we put him in ours, and then 
exact of him what our larger opportunities have given 
us. A young tutor whom I once knew signalized his 
passage from the bench to the chair by setting an 
examination paper which floored nearly the whole 
class. The professor in that department confessed 
that. he could not have satisfied the demands of his 
tutor’s paper. 
Another principle to be observed is this: An exam- 
ination paper should open up the highways and not 
the byways of knowledge—important dates and  
-P-A-G-E-202
  202 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
places, major facts, cardinal principles, typical ex- 
amples; not the trivial, but the respectable. 
Examinations have suffered not a little in reputa- 
tion from the circumstance that they have often been 
employed to puzzle and disconcert hapless students. 
There is no objection to a question which startles the 
pupil into thinking, but there is no excuse for dwell- 
ing by preference on matters purely trivial and un- 
important. Some things are so trifling and valueless 
that it is almost a disgrace to know them. An exami- 
nation paper should have an air of dignity and respec- 
tability and the moral quality of fairness. 
The three groups of subjects previously designate 
indicate in an ascending series three degrees of dif_i- 
culty in the construction of examination papers that 
propose to discover the effects produced on the pupil 
by his several studies. It is easy to test the mere 
holding and recollecting power of the mind, by re- 
quiring the pupil to reproduce or restore what has 
been given him to memorize. In other words, it is 
easy to take an inventory of this kind of mental fur- 
niture. It is not so easy, however, to frame a paper 
that will test the pupil’s power to think and his ability 
to construct on lines somewhat different from those 
to which he has been accustomed by his class-room
-P-A-G-E-203
EQUITY IN EXAMINATIONS 203 
experiences. Good instruction in the disciplinary 
subjects should create a certain facile independence, 
and should generate the power to overcome difficul- 
ties of larger and larger proportions. Such an exami- 
nation will ‘bear on principles rather than on rules, 
on types‘rather than on single instances. A pupil 
who can give a clear analysis of the divisions of one 
fraction by another may be presumed to understand 
all that has preceded this part of the subject. If he 
can demonstrate the principle that underlies Propor- 
tion, it is certain that his understanding, and not 
merely his memory, has received a training. When a 
pupil can turn an English sentence into idiomatic 
French, German, or Latin, there is proof positive 
that he has gained the power to think in a second lan- 
guage, and that he has mastered its etymology and 
syntax. There is no finer discipline than translation, 
for it involves three difficult intellectual feats: the 
separation of the thought from its original symbols; 
the grasping of it as a distinct mental possession; and 
the embodying of it in a new set of symbols. The 
very same thing takes place in English when the pupil 
expresses the author’s thought in his own language, 
‘by an exchange of symbols. Such exercises are an 
effectual test, not only of knowledge, but of power. 
     
-P-A-G-E-204
  204 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
But what test can we employ to discover the high- 
est uses that can be made of knowledge, when it has 
lost its identity through a process of elaboration and 
assimilation, and has been transformed into character, 
habit, opinion, emotion, power? It is easy enough to 
discover whether the pupil really has the knowledge 
that is capable of being transformed into these spirit- 
ual products, but is it possible to frame an examina- 
tion that will discover these products themselves? 
‘We must remember that knowledge often falls short 
of its highest uses; that there is much reading that 
does not affect the heart and the life; that there is 
much seeing and but little discernment; that of the 
throngs that each day crowd the galleries of the 
Louvre perhaps not one in a hundred suffers any per- 
manent change of heart towards the fine arts; and 
that men may listen with respectful attention to the 
preaching of the Gospel without the least spiritual 
edification. To use Bacon’s figure, we may be as- 
sured by an examination that the right kind of food 
has been swallowed, ‘but we cannot infer from this 
circumstance that it has really been digested. Seeing 
this difficulty in the matter of literary study, Dr. 
Corson proposes a. solution in this wise: 
“How is the best response to the essential life of a
-P-A-G-E-205
  EQUITY IN EXAMINATIONS 205 
poem to be secured by the teacher from the student? 
I answer, by the fullest interpretive vocal rendering 
of itt * * * A literary examination may 
then be made to mean something. The student, in- 
stead of being catechised about the merely intellectual 
articulation of a poem, the occasion of its composition, 
the influences which the poet was under when he 
composed it, the vocabulary, and a thousand other 
things, will be required to render it in order that he 
may show, through his voice, to what extent he has 
experienced it within himself, responded to and as- 
similated what the intellect cannot define or formu- 
late.”* 
This is no doubt an approach to the solution of a 
grave difficulty, but as it is easy to simulate emotion, 
we cannot be sure that this vocal rendering of a poem 
may not be mere acting; and, on the other hand, a 
lack of vocal training may prevent the expression of 
thought and emotion that really affect the life. At 
best, however, this solution affects but one member 
of the wide group I am now considering, and speak- 
ing of this group as a whole, I see no sure way of 
overcoming this great difficulty, no way of determin- 
ing conditions of spirit by means of an examiration. 
* “The Aims of Literary Study,’’ pp. 99, 108,
-P-A-G-E-206
  206 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
But examinations should not be abandoned on this 
account, any more than teaching itself should be 
abandoned. Teaching should be reinforced by exami- 
nation, and the best we can do is to assume that when 
the instruction has been of the thorough and inspir- 
ing kind, and when the pupil has done his intellectual 
work with thoroughness, the transformation into 
character and power will follow as a consequence. 
In the region where this inquiry lies the mere 
presence of knowledge is no proof that the character 
and the life have been affected, nor is its absence any 
proof that there has been no spiritual growth. With 
the mind as with the body, nutriment must lose its 
identity before it can be transformed into structure 
and power. A poem may have performed its highest 
office, its effect may have been deeply imbedded in the 
soul, and yet the poem as such may have absolutely 
disappeared from the memory. As we read a new 
book we mark the paragraphs that please us most, or 
that arrest our thought. After an interval of years 
we scan these marked paragraphs, but without any 
internal proof that we have ever read them; but a 
closer scrutiny shows us the genesis of certain opin- 
ions or emotions which these forgotten paragraphs 
had produced. In consideration of such facts, what
-P-A-G-E-207
EQUITY IN EXAMINATIONS 207 
possible inquest after knowledge can reveal these 
mysteries of spiritual adornment and growth? We 
cannot safely infer culture from knowledge, nor can 
we infer its absence from the absence of knowledge. 
Into these deep waters we throw the lead in vain, so 
far as the discovery of bottom facts is concerned. 
In this connection I commend the spirit of the fol- 
lowing quotation: 
“In accordance with the same principles, all knowl- 
edge, however imposing in appearance, is but superfi- 
cial knowledge, if it be merely the mind’s furniture, 
not the mind’s nutriment. It must be transmuted 
into mind, as food is into blood, to become wisdom 
and power. There is many a human parrot and mem- 
ory monger who has read and who recollects more 
history than Webster, but in Webster history has 
‘become judgment, foresight, executive force, mind. 
That seemingly instinctive sagacity, by which an able 
man does exactly the right thing at the right moment, 
is nothing but a collection of facts thus assimilated 
into thought. This power of instantaneous action 
without reflection is the only thing which saves men 
in great emergencies; but far from being independent 
of knowledge and experience, it. is their noblest re- 
sult.”* 
* Whipple, ‘“‘ Literature and Life,” pp. 193-’4, _

  208 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
“At the University of Cambridge he (Wordsworth) 
appears to have read the classics with the divining eye 
and assimilating mind of a poet, and if he did not 
attain the first position as a classical scholar, he cer- 
tainly drank in beyond all his fellows the spirit of the 
great writers of Greece and Rome.”* 
“Whether men sow or reap the fields, 
Divine monition Nature yields, 
That not by bread alone we live, 
As what a hand of fiesh can give— 
That every day should leave some part 
Free for a Sabbath of the heart.”+ 
Throughout this whole group of studies I would 
place supreme stress on the other condition mentioned 
by Dr. Corson, “ sympathetic assimilation on the part 
of the teacher.” The vital act of teaching is best 
described as induction, the taking on of spiritual and 
scholarly qualities from near presence to a man richly 
endowed with spiritual and scholarly qualities. 
But another aspect of the examination question 
now presents itself. What disposition is to be made 
of the papers which students have written under such 
stress, and on which their fate is supposed to hang? 
Students look upon an examination as a very serious 
* Ibid., p. 258. 
t Wordsworth.
-P-A-G-E-209
  EQUITY IN EXAMINATIONS 209 
thing; they have a feeling that it marks a crisis in 
their history; and they put into it the best that is in 
them of heart, mind and soul. I think it is a pity 
that all examiners do not. enter into full sympathy 
with their students in a matter which is so full of 
seriousness. The paper of each student should be 
read as patiently and as carefully as though he were 
the only member of the class; and in marking the 
value of an answer the examiner should be guided by 
the very spirit of judicial fairness. Another thing is 
so important that it should be regarded as a first prin- 
ciple in estimating the value of a paper: nothing 
which is outside the paper should influence the ex- 
aminer in forming his estimate of it. I have lately 
seen the following rule given for criticising a book: 
“Do not go behind the book. Your business is with 
the book, the whole book, and nothing but the book.” 
And so I would say: Do not go behind the paper. 
Your business is with the paper, the whole paper, and 
nothing but the paper. This means that you are not 
to mark a paper from any thought of what the pupil 
has done or has not done in the past, nor of what he 
should do or should not do in the future, but solely 
from the standpoint of intrinsic merit. 
Adhering strictly to this principle, it ought not to 
14
-P-A-G-E-210
    210 THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS 
be very difficult to reach a correct judgment as to the 
deserts of the paper. If it gives evidence that the 
pupil has made a good use of his opportunities and 
has gained a reasonable mastery of his subject he 
should be marked “passed.” If the paper makes it 
clear that the pupil’s knowledge of the subject is 
merely defective in some special parts, he should be 
“conditioned,” and the defective parts should be 
clearly indicated by the instructor. If the paper is 
radically poor, indicating an ignorance or a very poor 
knowledge of the subject, the pupil should be marked 
“not passed,” and should be required to pursue the 
study a second time. 
“A condition” should not be imposed on a student 
either as a punishment for some past irregularity or 
as a stimulus to future diligence. The paper must be 
marked simply on its merits, and a “condition” must 
not be used as a weapon of discipline. I wonder if all 
have reflected on the demoralizing effects of these 
“conditions.” They not only hang over the student 
as an impending calamity, but they rob every instrue- 
tor of a part of the student’s time that is his just due. 
“Conditions” must be removed, and in order to re- 
move them they must have time that would other- 
wise be given to other subjects. By an unwise resort
-P-A-G-E-211
   EQUITY IN EXAMINATIONS 211 
to “conditions” an instructor may “hold up” an entire 
school by making’ ‘every other instructor pay tribute 
to his exactions. In respect of its effect on a school, 
“condition” is much more mischievous than a “not 
passed.” Anything in school administration is mis- 
chievous that allows one instructor to invade the 
rights of other instructors. I once knew a teacher 
who played havoe throughout his school by his merci- 
less impositions and exactions on the time of students. 
He was the prince of task-masters, his subject yielded 
readily to drill, and his pupils were in such terror of 
his rebukes that they virtually gave him the monopoly 
of their time at the expense of other codrdinate de- 
partments of the university. 
It happened in an important western school, a few 
  years ago, that some sixty per cent of the students in 
  a certain class failed to pass their term’s examination, 
  and this fact was advertised as a proof of the remark- 
able thoroughness of the instruction. What a reflec- 
    tion on this man’s skill as an instructor, or upon his 
  wisdom as an examiner, that only four pupils in ten 
  could pass his own test on his own work! Under or- 
  dinary circumstances it is proof of unskillful instruc- 
  tion or of unwise examination to impose a large num- 
  ber of “conditions” and “not passed,” In very large 
      
-P-A-G-E-212

classes, it may be said, individual instruction becomes 
impossible, and many failures are the consequence; 
but evidently these pupils lack opportunity through 
no fault of their own; either their progress should be 
slower in order that it may be surer, or the severity 
of the examination should be duly moderated. A 
large per cent of failures in examination is proof posi- 
tive of poor work at some point on the part of the 
instructor. An evident exception to this rule is the 
case where an instructor restricts pupils, say in Latin, 
who have been taught their grammar with different 
degrees of thoroughness. 
I have spoken of the extreme sensitiveness of stu- 
dents to the good opinion of their instructors and 
classmates, and I would have this feeling most sa- 
credly guarded. Any unnecessary publicity given to 
a student’s misfortunes is almost a crime. If we could 
only put ourselves in the place of our students and 
guard their interests as discreetly as we would have 
our own guarded, we would be doing no more than 
simple charity requires of us.

THE UNIVERSAL VOCATION 
In the way of concrete Christianity, and as defining 
in few words the whole duty of man to his fellows, 
nothing seems to me more admirable than these words 
of Paul: ‘‘ And let us not be weary in well doing: 
for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not. As 
we have therefore opportunity, let us do good to all 
men, especially unto them who are of the household 
of faith.”’ 
I think the world has grown tired of theology, that 
is, of the abstract science of righteousness; but it 
never tires of religion, that is, of ‘‘ that which binds 
and holds us to the practice of righteousness.’?* Men 
will return with perennial joy to the Sermon on the 
Mount, while they will not listen with patience to dry 
statements of theologies and creeds. Is the church 
losing power over intelligent men? Yes, whenever 
the preacher makes the theory of religion the warp 
and woof of his sermon, but never when the Bible is 
used to enforce the practice of righteousness and to

-P-A-G-E-216
   216 APPENDIX 
inspire men with the nobility of right conduct. All 
the great preachers of to-day are great because they 
offer meat and drink to the hungry and thirsty souls 
of men. In too many instances, sincere men and 
women go to their preacher for bread, and they are 
given a stone; they are offered the dry husks of the- 
ology when the thing they want is practical help to- 
wards the conduct of life. How shall we live in 
order that we may die with composure? How shall 
we bear up under the crushing burdens of misfortune 
and sorrow? What shall be our attitude towards 
those who despitefully use us? How shall we add to 
human happiness and mitigate human sorrow? Such 
questions disturb every human soul, and men have an 
instinctive feeling that they are to be answered out 
of the Bible through its authorized interpreters. 
Beneficence, or the doing of good, is the universal 
vocation to which all men are called. As the years 
multiply I have the ever growing conviction that the 
real interpretation of life is to be found only in a 
steadfast devotion to the doing of good; that in the 
intent of our Creator our one mission on this earth is 
to renew its face physically and morally; to reconvert 
it into a paradise for human habitation and delight ; 
and to restore to man the lost image in which he wes 
      
-P-A-G-E-217
  THE UNIVERSAL VOCATION 217 
ereated. All other vocations—all trades, employ- 
ments, professions—should be held strictly subordi- 
nate to this supreme vocation of beneficence. Why 
am I a scholar, a preacher, a lawyer, a poet, a farmer, 
a teacher, a tailor, a cooper, or a merchant? There 
is but one reply to each and all of these queries. 
“¢ Because I see in these several vocations a fair oppor- 
tunity to do good, to serve my generation, and to ben- 
efit the world.’? Contrariwise, why am I to shun 
certain other vocations to which I see many of my 
fellow beings devoting themselves? Because the di- 
rect and the indirect tendencies of such vocations are 
to produce or to perpetuate evil, to make men worse 
and to carry the world farther and farther from its 
ideal state. None of these questions can be answered 
from a consideration of wealth, reputation, or even 
personal happiness. We are to ‘‘seek peace and 
ensue it,’’? even though we are sure to incur stripes, 
reproaches, poverty and shame; and we are to avoid 
evil pursuits, even though they insure wealth, honor 
and reputation. 
This principle places us on high vantage ground. 
from which to survey human occupations and to select 
the one which shall be our life vocation. Two things 
are required in order to make a wise selection of a
-P-A-G-E-218
218 APPENDIX 
vocation: (1) To set aside at once those whose nature 
and aims are evil; and (2) then out of those which 
ure beneficent to select the one most in keeping with 
our tastes and abilities. 
It is not a difficult thing to distinguish and set aside 
the vocations that are evil. On this point the consen- 
sus of human opinion is unanimous. This classifica- 
tion is as old as history itself, and has come down to 
us as an inheritance. For example, no one, not even 
a dramseller himself, will assert that dramselling is a 
beneficent business. That question is not worth debat- 
ing. It has been settled for all time to come. Whether 
farming is a beneficent occupation is not a debatable 
question. That too has been settled. There are not 
two sides to the‘questions. 
However, this circumstance is to be noted: a bene- 
ficent vocation may be maleficently administered, as 
when a farmer vends unwholesome food, or a states- 
man oppresses his people, or a preacher teaches error, 
or a writer composes a bad book. The evil is not in 
the vocation, but in the administration of it. On the 
other hand, no gift in administration can purge a mal- 
eficent vocation of its evil. Theft cannot be converted 
into a virtue; a thief is a public enemy, and thieving 
is an evil; there is no good in it, and no good can 
 
-P-A-G-E-219
  THE UNIVERSAL VOCATION 219 
come out of it. And still another thing is to be 
noted: the more respectability we throw about an 
evil vocation the more dangerous it becomes; the more 
attractive we make it the larger beeomes the number 
of its victims. 
‘When we come to select one out of the many bene- 
ficent vocations we fall upon grave difficulties. Very 
often the selection is made on false principles, especi- 
ally in the case of the professions. Long before the 
boy’s capabilities and tastes have been brought to the 
light by training and maturity, the fond mother has 
predestined him for the pulpit or the bar; and so we 
witness the sad fact of misfits and maladjustments— 
the heaven-born preacher at the plow, and the mis- 
placed plowman in the pulpit. In respect of the pro- 
fessions, I suppose the good rule is this: Defer the 
selection of a profession until the period of general 
training is over in order that the choice may be, based 
on known fitness and well developed tastes. Good 
preparation being assumed, one does best who works 
in the line of his predilections, while to work against 
the grain is to compromise one’s success from the very 
start. \A good high school education seems to me the 
minimum requisite for making a wise choice of a vo- 
cation. So far as possible, duty and inclination should
-P-A-G-E-220
  220 APPENDIX 
lie in the same direction. One’s power for doing good 
is thus doubled. It is a sad check to one’s usefulness 
to do work which is a constant cross to one’s inclina- 
tions. It is only by this concert of will and pleasure 
that we can do with our might what our hands find to 
do. ‘If we read without inclination, half the mind 
is employed in fixing the attention, so there is but one- 
half to be employed on what we read.’’* I allow 
that sometimes, at the very beginning, we must con- 
strain ourselves to reconcile duty with inclination, but 
habit soon comes to the rescue, and what we learn 
to do easily and successfully we come to do with 
pleasure. The important thing is to put heart and 
soul into whatever we do, whether it be making a 
horseshoe, plowing a furrow, preaching a sermon, 
teaching a lesson, or writing a book. We should im- 
part a moral quality to everything that we fashion 
with hand or brain. Whatever we build we should 
build to last; and if it be our privilege to make or 
mould ‘‘a thing of beauty,’’ it should be of such 
temper and virtue as to be ‘‘a joy forever.” Every 
sham is immorality, and the persistent maker of shams 
should be regarded and treated asa criminal. It is 
morality that gives coherence to human society; and 
*Samuel Johnson,
-P-A-G-E-221
* 
THE UNIVERSAL VOCATION 221 
in the last analysis it is morality that keeps a vessel 
from foundering and a house from falling. James 
Carlyle was a stone mason who put his religion into 
every wall that he built, and the great endowment 
that he left to his illustrious son was an instinctive 
and uncompromising hatred of shams in all their 
myriad forms. Burns, another Scotchman, was the 
very scourge of pretense, fraud and sham, particularly 
in their most odious form, hypocrisy, and so he wrote: 
“‘God knows I’m no the thing I should be, 
Nor am I even the thing I could be, 
But twenty times I rather would be 
An atheist clean, 
Than under gospel colors hid be, 
Just for a screen.” 
When we seriously reflect on the prevalence of in- 
sincerity and fraud, and think how thoroughly society 
is honeycombed.with deception and cheat, we for a 
moment grow pessimistic and sick at heart; but when 
we take a broader view and study the course of human 
events as they reflect the morality of the times, we dis- 
cover that through all this misery and corruption there 
is a power working for righteousness, that the tone of 
public morals is steadily rising, that there is a higher and 
higher standard of conduct, and that frauds and shams
-P-A-G-E-222
  222 APPENDIX 
are growing more and more odious as the race advances 
in experience. I pity the man who is not an optimist, 
who believes that the world is predestined to a growing 
corruption, that society is controlled by knaves and 
scoundrels, and that some day the powers of darkness 
are to hold high carnival over the final discomfiture of 
the true and the good. How can a soldier fight when 
he knows that defeat is already inevitable? How can 
a man raise his finger to do good when he knows that 
all the good that all men can do will be swallowed up 
of evil? I pray that you may be delivered from this 
dreary and joyless creed of despair. Bad as it is, look 
hopefully on the world and let its evident wickedness 
be but a stimulus to your devotion to well doing. 
Have faith in the ultimate triumph of righteousness, 
and consecrate all your powers to the betterment of 
human society. A cheerful optimism will multiply 
all your powers for doing good by ten. Listen to no 
man who presumes to preach the gospel of despair. 
Every benevolent and beneficent man may feel assured 
that he is an alliance with the everlasting powers of 
righteousness, that in his work, however humble, he 
is supported by the invincible agents of Truth. 
Now, in further illustration of my theme, I will 
 
-P-A-G-E-223
THE UNIVERSAL VOCATION 223 
mention some modes in which one may exercise the 
vocation of beneficence: 
There is untold and resistless power in a good life, 
in a life exemplifying day by day one’s fidelity to 
duty, one’s loyalty to truth, one’s devotion to right- 
eous conduct and to the unostentatious doing of good. 
To be a loyal citizen, a helpful neighbor, a true friend, 
an affectionate son or daughter—to be thus dutiful in 
a quiet and beautiful way, is to lead a life pleasing to 
God and helpful to men. Such a life is an epistle 
known and read of all men, and all the more persua- 
sive because it issues no commands and excites no 
comparisons and oppositions. Men generally rebel 
against formal attempts to make them better. A pro- 
fessional reformer virtually assumes that he is superior 
to other men, and this assumption is usually irritating 
and offensive; but a man who in a simple and unas- 
suming way leads an industrious, frugal and temperate 
life, who fears God and keeps His ccmmandments, is 
an irresistible power for good and an incomparable 
preacher of righteousness. There is a perennial charm 
in a life of such simplicity and uprightness, and I am 
convinced that the real salt and savor of society is to 
be found in lives of this unassuming type, in lives 
such as the poet pictures :
-P-A-G-E-224
  224 APPENDIX 
“Far from the madding crowd’s ignoble strife, 
Their sober wishes never learned to stray; 
Along the cool sequestered vale of life 
They kept the noiseless tenor of their way.” 
The center and source of a people’s moral strength 
is the home. It is in the serene quiet of the home life 
that are organized the forces that lift society upwards 
in the way of righteousness and peace. If the home 
is the scene of peace and joy and holy living, the 
young have the best possible endowment for serving 
their generation effectively. It is in private, not 
public, life that the saving virtues are nurtured. It 
is under the shelter of the rooftree and around the 
family fireside that are formed the patriot and the 
Christian soldier. It is sometimes necessary to fight, 
as Aristotle declares, but all to the end that we may 
have peace. The ideal state to which Christianity is 
striving is that of peace and good will to men. ‘‘The 
fruits of righteousness are sown in peace of them that 
make peace.’’ 
‘What I have just said amounts in substance to this: 
the prime condition of doing good in the world is to 
have a nature surcharged with good impulses, noble 
aspirations and benevolent purposes. If you are to 
do good you must be good; if you are to promote 
 
-P-A-G-E-225
THE UNIVERSAL VOCATION 225 
peace and good will among men you must yourself 
have a peaceable spirit and a will to do good.to others. 
Mean men may do a good deed from some constraint, 
as an unjust judge may finally listen to a widow’s plea 
out of sheer importunity; but such service is a hollow 
mockery, offensive to God and man. It is out of the 
abundance of the heart that the mouth should speak. 
Good men will seek occasion to do good; they will 
not wait for some form of compulsion. A benevolent 
nature will express itself in good deeds, just as a 
merry heart makes a glad countenance. ‘‘ What a 
delicious fortune is it to him whose strongest appetite 
is doing good, to have every day the opportunity and 
the power of satisfying it.’’* Education, as I ‘am 
coming more and more to understand it, consists 
mainly in assisting young people to be or become 
something as the condition of doing something. The 
education that does not strike deep enough to affect 
the personality beneficently and permanently is of 
little worth. 
Another mode in which you may do good to men 
as you have opportunity is to extend their intellectual 
horizon and give them clearer conceptions of truth. 
Narrowness makes us selfish, intolerant and unchar-

itable. We should all pray for breadth, for some one 
to take us to the mountains whence we may see the 
world’s greatness and our own littleness, to the end 
that we may be modest and at the same time cosmo- 
politan. All men should be travelers, travelers in 
fact, or, through books, travelers by proxy; so that 
while denizens of the little spot we call our home, we 
may become citizens of the world. How many mean 
prejudices slink away from us as we come into wider 
fellowship with our own kind! As we mingle with 
people of other nationalities we discover that be- 
tween them and us there are many more resemblances 
than differences. Doubtless it was Paul’s experience 
as a traveler that had taught him that ‘‘ God hath 
made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on 
all the face of the earth.’? Not until he had parted 
with his Jewish exclusiveness could he have become 
the apostle to the Gentiles. His sojourn in Arabia 
and his experience at Antioch were for Paul a liberal 
education, and with this endowment he became the 
world’s preacher. 
Socrates held that knowledge and virtue are syn- 
onymous, or, rather, that clear intellectual vision is an 
unfailing guide to good conduct. On this hypothesis 
he devoted himself to dialectic, that is, to an unloos-

ening or analysis of the current ethical maxims and 
theories of his day in order to divest them of their 
sophistries and thence to discover the one kernel of 
grain hidden in the bushel of chaff. This theory is 
imperfect because it does not take into account habit 
and emotion; but there is so large an element of help- 
fulness in it that the clear discernment of truth must 
be counted as a fundamental condition of good con- 
duct. Knowing that arsenic is a poison, we do not 
tamper with it; knowing that electricity kills, we do 
not lay hold of live wires; but knowing that intem- 
perance leads to poverty and shame, all men are not 
temperate; knowing that untruthfulness saps honor 
and integrity, all men are not truthful. In the first 
cases there is no element of uncertainty and no seduc- 
tion of habit, and so obedience is easy; but in the 
second cases there are exceptions to a general rule, 
and some men are willing to take their chances on 
these exceptions. (Still, if men have been the subjects 
of moral discipline, they will shun the paths of danger 
when they have been clearly discerned by the intellect.\ 
Socrates no doubt assumed the fact of moral discipline, 
and with this postulate we may certainly build on the 
divine principle enunciated by John, that ‘‘the truth 
shall make us free,’’ It is the business of the schools 
 
-P-A-G-E-228
  228 APPENDIX 
not only to bring pupils face to face with truth, but to 
make the pursuit of truth one of the sweetest joys of 
life. By direct teaching, and perhaps even more by 
the silent and potent influences of example, you may 
fulfill one of your highest duties to man by clear ex- 
positions of truth, and by making the pursuit of truth 
a lovable vocation. ‘‘It isa pleasure to stand upon 
the shore and to see ships tossed by the sea; a pleasure 
to stand in the window of a castle, and to see a battle, 
and the adventures thereof below; but no pleasure is 
comparable to the standing on the vantage ground of 
truth (a hill not to be commanded, and where the air 
is always clear and serene) and to see the errors, and 
wanderings, and mists, and tempests, in the vale 
below: so always, that this prospect be with pity, and 
not with swelling or pride. Certainly it is heaven 
upon earth to have a man’s mind move in charity, rest 
in providence, and turn upon the poles of truth.’’* 
I think it is not possible to overestimate the influ- 
ence of good books and the reading habit on the hap- 
piness and well-being of mankind. In this age of 
universal reading, men make books their companions, 
guides and teachers. The time once was when opin- 
ion, public and individual, was moulded and controlled 
*Bacon, Of Truth.

by the orator and the preacher ; but in these later days 
the pulpit and the rostrum have been largely super- 
seded by the book, aud the occupation of our leisure 
is reading, rather than listening. The old and true 
saying that ‘‘a man is known by the company he 
keeps,’’ should now read, ‘‘a man is known by the 
books he reads.’’? It is as certain as anything can 
be in the moral world that a young man who is an 
ardent lover of good books is in very little danger of 
moral corruption. This is so for two reasons: a good 
book is not only wholesome and stimulating moral 
aliment, but the reading habit is a precious preoccupa- 
tion, and in moral training wise preoccupation is more 
than half the battle. These simple propositions are 
unmistakably true: The pursuit of happiness is a 
need of our nature; men will seek happiness in some 
form; if they cannot find it in the exercise of the 
higher emotions, they will seek it in the exercise of 
the lower; and if the mind is preoccupied with the 
higher pleasures it will be closed to the lower. 
‘« Students do not do enough for themselves, in these 
days of vast educational machinery. They for the 
most part confine themselves to the prescribed work 
of the schools. They are, in fact, obliged to do this, 
in order to keep up with the heterogeneous class work 
   
-P-A-G-E-230
  230 APPENDIX 
imposed on them, and to prepare for examinations. 
They have so much to gobble up that, to turn aside to 
read, in a genial, sympathetic way, a great inspiring 
author, as they should be encouraged and allowed an 
opportunity to do, is quite impossible. The school 
bill of fare, with moral dyspepsia in its wake, must 
be gone through with, ruat coelum.’’* 
Next in potency to the Scriptures as an agent for 
awakening and nourishing the higher life of the soul, 
is genuine poetry; and to be wisely addicted to good 
poetry is to live in a tonic moral atmosphere and to 
put on the form of a higher spiritual personality. 
The true poet is a creator, the creator of a purer 
world, peopled by purified spirits, and purifying all 
who take up their abode init. ‘‘The immoral and 
universal paths of our race are to be read and reread 
till their music and their spirit are a part of our 
nature; they are to be thought over and digested till 
we live in the world they created for us; they are to 
be read devoutly, as devout men read their Bible 
and fortify their hearts with psalms. For as the old 
Hebrew singer heard the heavens declare the glory of 
their Maker, and the firmament showing his handi- 
work, so in the long roll of poetry we see transfigured 
* Hiram Corson.
-P-A-G-E-231
  THE UNIVERSAL VOCATION 231 
the strength and beauty of humanity, the joys and 
sorrows, the dignity and struggle, the long life-history 
of our common kind.’’* 
Next to good poetry as a transforming power is 
good fiction. While poetry constructs for man an 
ideal world and peoples it with ideal characters, fic- 
tion has for its field the analysis and reconstruction of 
the real world inhabited by real men and women, and 
leaves the reader to construct an ideal world for him- 
self, to become his own poet and prophet. 
Whether you can make this beneficent use of books 
or not will depend upon your own intellectual tastes 
and habits. It is not enough that you love to read; 
you should also love books as personal treasures, 
should love them as you love your friends, and with 
the same ardor as some men love pictures. But to 
love books you must own them. If you can associate 
some personal sacrifice with each one of them, so 
much the better. To be loved in the best fashion, a 
book should not only have intrinsic merit, which is, 
of course, the principal thing, but it should have some 
special charms of typography, paper, and binding. 
There are books beautiful and books ugly, books that 
appeal to the esthetic sense as works of art, and books 
* Frederick Harrison.  
-P-A-G-E-232
  232 APPENDIX 
that are offensive to sight and touch. I would have 
you affected with a mild bibliomania, to the end that 
you may accumulate a certain number of book treasures 
which you treat lovingly and guard jealously. Books 
are the tools of your art, and to know how to use 
them wisely and effectively is one of the prime ele- 
ments of your professional outfit. By degrees you 
should accumulate a library, not alone of professional 
books, but mainly of books that bespeak the tastes of 
a general scholar, books of history, philosophy and 
belles-lettres; for in a high and true sense these too 
are professional books, since the teacher is or should 
be first of all a scholar, a man enamored of the schol- 
arly vocation. In fact any pursuit is professional that 
gives extension to a teacher’s intellectual vision, gives 
him higher and truer views of life, or gives tone and 
poise to the sum total of his character. A good poem 
may do him a higher professional service than a book 
on method. 
Withou’ saying with Pope that happiness is ‘‘ our 
being’s end and aim,’’ it is certain that happiness is a 
substantial good, a moral tonic needed by all men as a 
condition for doing a high quality of work. Noble 
work has been done under the stress of poverty and 
sorrow, but no one will say that these are conditions
-P-A-G-E-233
THE UNIVERSAL VOCATION 233 
that are to be desired. At best they are a painful 
stimulus to action, but in the end pain is weakening 
and demoralizing. Happiness, on the other hand, 
acting as a gentle stimulus, produces a constitutional 
condition that is most favorable to human exertion. 
We should pray for happiness, not for the sake of 
personal enjoyment, but because it is the state most 
favorable for doing work of the highest quality; just 
as we pray to be delivered from unhappiness, because 
this is a state unfavorable to the doing of good service. 
Doubtless sorrow is a discipline necessary to lead us on 
toward the perfecting of our nature, but sorrows come 
unbidden, and we have no warrant for bringing them 
forward by express intent. Happiness, however, or 
that state of mind which results from the free and 
unimpeded exercise of our activities, is even more es- 
sential to the normal life of the soul. As it is a state 
dependent more or less on conditions within our con- 
trol, we may make it an object of deliberate pursuit, 
as a good which we may do to all men. 
The case is still stronger when we take children 
into account. Men may react against unhappiness and 
even draw strength from it, but happiness is the vital 
breath of children, the very best, if not the only, 
moral stimulus on which they can thrive. In all its
-P-A-G-E-234
234 APPENDIX 
appointments, a schoolroom for children should inspire 
a wholesome sense of rest and comfort, and should 
predispose its pupils to happiness. The teacher her- 
self should radiate an atmosphere that is kindly, joyous 
and sympathetic—voice, manner and dress all conspir- 
ing to create a very paradise for childhood. One 
incomparable blessing bestowed on education by the 
kindergarten is the spirit of spontaneity and joyous- 
ness which it has introduced into the primary school. 
This I believe to be one of its supreme merits. 
Wherever you work, whether in the narrow circle 
of your school, or in the wider field of the world, I 
would have you, by your good humor, serenity of 
spirit and kindliness of heart, make it one of your 
distinct aims to diffuse about you the wholesome and 
inspiring tonic of human happiness. As far as you 
may be able, take sunshine into darkened homes, lift 
the clouds from heavy hearts and give support to 
drooping spirits. Be sympathetic, speak hopefully, 
treat gently, reserving frowns, censure and hardness 
for the rarest occasions. As the condition for doing 
this, fill yourself with hopefulness, cheerfulness, good 
will and benevolence, and count these as cardinal vir- 
tues in a life that is to be devoted to the dissemination 
of righteousness.
-P-A-G-E-235
  THE UNIVERSAL VOCATION 235 
I venture to call attention to another principle which 
I think of vital importance. Whoever feels obliged to 
look for his happiness outside of himself, outside of 
his own resources, is in a state of great moral danger. 
If education is to be truly a beneficence, it should 
make a man self-contained, self-centered, resourceful, 
a law unto himself, so that when in peril he may 
rescue himself, and when alone he may not be lonely. 
One should learn to be on good terms with one’s self, 
to be one’s own companion, and out of one’s own 
resources to draw comfort, happiness and strength. 
{What a pitiable condition to be dependent on others 
for our daily supplies of happiness and moral strength ! 
/ For the end I have in view the one great essential 
is a well furnished mind, a memory that holds in safe 
keeping and subject to prompt recall some of the 
masterpieces of literature, religious, ethical and poeti- 
cal. As specimens from sacred literature I mention 
the following: The Beatitudes; the Twenty-third, 
the Ninetieth and the One Hundred and third Psalms ; 
the Twelfth of Romans, the Thirteenth of First Cor- 
inthians, the Third of James. Then there should 
come such complete poems as Gray’s Elegy, Thana- 
topsis, J2 Penseroso, and so on almost without limit. 
One of the shames of modern education is the syste- 
 
-P-A-G-E-236
  236 APPENDIX 
matic and almost universal discrediting of the memory. 
It is denied that the memory is a storehouse, but every 
sane an knows that it is. ‘‘ We must most of all 
exercise and keep in constant employment the memory 
of children; for that is, as it were, the storehouse of 
all learning.”’* It is asserted that ‘‘ nothing should 
be committed to memory which has not been under- 
stood”’?; which is as wise as to say that ‘‘no food 
should be committed to the stomach which has not 
been digested.’’ ‘Not only is education without mem- 
ory impossible, but the quality of education is depend- 
ent on the larger or smaller use that is made of the 
memory. At any rate, from our present point of 
view a man, to be well furnished for the highest re- 
quirements of life, has need of a mind that holds in 
store large and select portions of the world’s wisdom. 
I do not know how I could do you a higher service 
than by inducing you to make of your minds a royal 
storehouse of the best things uttered or written by the 
world’s great teachers, its saints, prophets, poets and 
philosophers. 
In the next place I would have you do good to men 
by teaching them by precept and example the essential 
nobility and beauty of simplicity in character, in 
* Plutarch,

habits, in pleasures, in desires, in wants, in dress—in 
all things that pertain to the conduct of life.| In 
religion, in government, in society, in educatioh—in 
every sphere of human activity there is an almost 
irresistible movement towards the artificial, the com- 
plex, the unnecessary. Rousseau was not far wrong 
in saying that men no longer know how to be simple 
in anything, and in believing that the cure for human 
ills is to be found in a return to simplicity, or to 
Nature, as distinguished from art. To know what 
Rousseau means by Nature, and so to comprehend his 
theory of life, one needs to go from Paris to Mont- 
morency, from shops, palaces and prisons to trees, 
lawns and brooks; from din and bustle to solitude and 
silence. There isa strong confirmation of this theory 
in the history of religion, where reforms have always 
been in the line of simplicity, away from forms and 
ceremonies, back to a simple spiritual worship. In 
process of time the reformed religions must themselves 
reform, so irresistible is the tendency to find comfort 
in mere mechanism, and to work out one’s salvation, 
not with fear and trembling, but by proxy, in a gen- 
tlemanly way, without much disturbance to one’s feel- 
ings or sense of comfort. 
Many of our wants are purely artificial, the mere
-P-A-G-E-238
  238 APPENDIX 
creations of fashions or fancy, responding to no real 
demands of our nature, but wasting our money, dissi- 
pating our time, and destroying our health as well as 
our happiness. Simplicity in food, in dress and in 
pleasure would add to our health, our wealth and our 
happiness; and if the young could be impressed with 
the beauty and the utility of simplicity in all the things 
that pertain to the conduct of life, they would be 
placed on higher vantage ground and insured against 
many of the so-called ills of existence. 
I think most people in a normal state of mind and 
heart have periodical longings to retreat to the woods 
and the mountains, and there to renew their spiritual 
and physical strength in solitude and simplicity of life. 
No life can be great that is not nurtured and matured 
in solitude, and any life will be dwarfed and puny 
that does not sometimes retire from the heat and glare 
of society, to gain refreshment from the repose and 
silence of nature. Happy they to whom such retreats 
are open! The solitude of Oraigenputtock was in 
perfect keeping with the genius and the spiritual 
needs of Carlyle during the years that witnessed the 
maturing of his powers and the crystalizing of his 
theories of life. At this supreme juncture, life in 
London, or even in Edinburgh, would have been folly,
-P-A-G-E-239
        THE UNIVERSAL VOCATION 239 
if not ruin: Mr. Carlyle’s latest biographer, Macpher- 
son, speaks of ‘‘Carlyle’s retirement to the howling 
wilds of Craigenputtock’’; and Mr. Froude charac- 
terizes the place as ‘‘the dreariest spot in all the 
British dominions.’ As Craigenputtock appeared to 
me, it is a pleasant, even a charming spot for a man 
of contemplative habits and simple tastes, the only 
spot in Britain that I coveted as a dwelling place. 
One phase of education as a process is growth, spir- 
itual and mental. For such growth reflection or rum- 
ination is necessary, and for this purpose retirement 
or seclusion is an absolute necessity. Student life can 
not be wholesome if it does not have stated periods 
consecrated to reflection and contemplation. Possibly 
the lack of this opportunity explains why it is that 
college life contributes so little to a student’s real edu- 
cation. ‘or the most part, the mind is made to work 
at high tension, such is the pressure of class work and 
examinations, but it is only when the mind is working 
under a mild and gentle stimulus, in a state of com- 
parative repose, that education proper can take place ; 
so that it is the wisest student economy to arrange for 
stated periods of retirement where the sole occupation 
is rumination. I do not think it a paradox to say that
-P-A-G-E-240
  240 APPENDIX 
normal sleep is more favorable to true educational 
growth than the customary drill of the class room. 
I now turn to another mode of doing good which is 
more strictly professional: the dissemination through- 
out your little circle of influence of correct notions as 
to the nature and purposes of education. How you 
could do more good in your day and generation than 
by preaching this evangel I do not know, for educa- 
tion is the architectonic or master art, the art that 
makes all others possible, that determines the value of 
individuals to the state, and that also determines the 
rank of states in the august procession of nations. I 
do not know which is the more potent factor for good 
in a community, a wise teacher dispensing to his little 
flock mental and spiritual food in due quantity and of 
due quality, or a wise patron predisposing the commu- 
nity to support a school of high quality. It is certain 
that both agencies are needed, and it should be true 
that every good teacher is also a good preacher of a 
sound educational gospel. In the order of logic the 
schoolhouse should antedate the church, which is the 
actual historical order. The evangelization of the 
world would proceed more surely and more rapidly if 
a sound educational gospel were to prepare the way 
for the Gospel of peace and good will to men. 
 
-P-A-G-E-241
THE UNIVERSAL VOCATION 241 
It will help us to understand the essential secret of 
education if we reflect on the fact that many students 
who have been graduated from college are essentially 
uneducated, while there are many men who are edu- 
cated in the noble sense of that term who never fre- 
quented an academy or a college. Many a boy has 
abandoned all hope of an education because he is shut 
out from the privileges of the schools, believing that 
education is dependent on the means which they offer. 
All young people should know that in this country of 
churches, newspapers and books, every one may be- 
come educated in some true sense of this term, and 
that one condition and prerequisite is an unfaltering 
will, a will that says inveniam viam aut faciam. 
Five minutes’ conversation with a boy, under fair 
conditions, and pitched to the right key, might pro- 
duce ‘intellectual conversion and wholly change the 
current of his life. In every school there are natures 
quickly responsive to appeals addressed to what is best 
in them; and the beautiful way when once pointed 
out will be lovingly followed to the more beautiful 
end. 
You should disabuse the minds of others, as I hope 
you have long since disabused your own minds, of the 
notion that education is synonymous with the posses- 
16 
 
-P-A-G-E-242
  242 APPENDIX 
sion of much knowledge. Knowledge to be really 
educative must, through a process of assimilation, be 
built up into that spiritual fabric which constitutes the 
human personality. Now, mere knowledge may re- 
main in the mind as unassimilated material, almost as 
foreign matter in the spiritual substance, and it is as 
illogical to infer education from the mere possession of 
knowledge, as to infer warmth from unused fuel, or 
bodily comfort and strength from food still in store. 
‘We come a little nearer the secret of education 
when we call it discipline or power. In a sense, but 
in an incomplete sense, a man is educated whose mind 
has been disciplined; but mere discipline, without 
that substantive being which we call character, that 
chemical compound of intellect, heart and will, ali 
fused into one, and constituting the unit of the human 
personality—such discipline is impotent for good, a 
sword without a patriot’s hand to wield it. Horses, 
pigs and even fleas can be trained but not educated. 
That is, they can be so disciplined as to execute tricks _ 
and feats not in keeping with their original nature, but 
there is no upward modification of character through : 
anything that affects intellect and emotion; and it is 
because they have neither intellect nor emotion that 
they cannot be educated.
-P-A-G-E-243
THE UNIVERSAL VOCATION 243 
Though wise men from Plato to Colonel Parker, 
inclusive, have attempted to define education, no sat- 
isfactory definition of it has been framed; and we 
may be sure that when the definition is concise, it is 
practically worthless. To say that education is devel- 
opment, or life, or perfection, if not nonsense, is an 
affirmation so utterly vague and rhetorical as to be 
practically meaningless. Even the very best defini- 
tions, like those of Plato, Spencer and Huxley, are 
hardly more significant than a wave of the hand show- 
ing us in what direction to look for light. The best ’ 
that can be done is to abandon definition and resort to 
description, such description bearing on one or all of 
the following points: (1) the end or purpose of edu- 
cation; (2) its matter or content; (3) its form; and 
(4) its processes. Proceeding on this line I offer the 
following statements, no one of which, nor all com- 
bined, amounts to a full description, much less to a 
definition : 
Education is the process of bringing a human being j 
“into likeness with the highest type of his kind. 
Supposing that the Apollo Belvidere typifies the § 
_physical perfection attainable by man, or the perfec- ‘ 
tion towards which he is to strive; that the type of 
pure intellect is to be found in Aristotle, and the type 
 
-P-A-G-E-244
244 APPENDIX 
of moral perfection in Jesus; then this statement be- 
comes useful in making known the purpose or end of 
education, but it throws no light on other essential 
elements of the problem, save by implication, on the 
principle that to know the end is almost to know the 
way, and that to have a strong desire to reach this end 
is to find a way. 
The purpose of education is to endow the individ- 
wal, through proper instruction, with the highest 
achievements of the race in thinking, feeling and 
doing. 
Here we have the end somewhat vaguely stated as 
a certain endowment; the process as instruction; and 
the content, by fair implication, as knowledge. 
Education consists in the equable development and 
training of the human powers through proper in- 
struction. 
This statement points out that the end and content 
is development and training; the process is instruc- 
tion; and the form is symmetry, harmony, proportion. 
This is the ancient Greek and the modern German 
conception. 
The purpose of education is to generate within the 
individual right feelings towards the true, the beau- 
tiful, and the good. 
 
-P-A-G-E-245
THE UNIVERSAL VOCATION 245 
This is a statement that the purpose is certain feel- 
ings or emotions; the process is generation, develop- 
ment; the form is rightness, harmony; and, by im- 
plication, the content is certain knowledge. 
‘¢To prepare us for complete living,’’ says Herbert 
Spencer, ‘‘is the function which education has to dis- 
charge.’’ All that is accomplished by this much 
vaunted definition is to declare its end or aims, ‘‘com- 
plete living’’; but this concept is so vague, so gen- 
eral, so indefinable, that its use for guidance is very 
small. Before this definition can be made available, 
we must know what is included in ‘‘ complete living,’’ 
and it is not at all probable that any two wise men out 
of a hundred would agree as to the content of this 
concept. 
Plato declares that ‘‘the end of education is to give 
to the body and to the soul all the beauty and all the 
perfection of which they are susceptible.’? Beauty 
and perfection of body and soul is here the avowed 
end of education. These are wide concepts, we must 
allow, and in consequence, a congenial halo of vague- 
ness hangs over this classical definition ; but by reason 
of its analytical character it affords attachments to the 
teacher’s efforts which are wanting in Mr. Spencer’s 
statement.

   246 APPENDIX 
In these illustrations the thought I wish to impress 
is that in your attempts to make known the secret of 
education you must proceed by description rather than 
by strict definition, and that you must resort to as 
many statements as there are phases to this many 
sided question, the most comprehensive that can oc- 
cupy the mind of man. 
In all that has preceded I have assumed that as the 
fundamental condition for doing good you must be 
possessed in full measure of the spirit of Christianity 
as set forth in the Gospel. The complement and 
crown of your education must be that spiritual trans- 
formation and culture which it is the mission of 
Christianity to bestow on mankind. In the fullest 
and best sense, you must be inspired and possessed by 
the missionary spirit, that spirit which includes in one 
noble group of philanthropists the preacher and the 
teacher.

A THEORY OF LIFE 
Tux prophetic eye of John, looking down the long 
vista of the coming centuries, foresaw that the king- 
doms of this world were to become the kingdoms of 
the Lord and of his Christ. In other words, the moral 
world was to be reconstructed or re-created through the 
gospel of peace and good will to men, just as the physi- 
cal world is now in process of reconstruction or re-crea- 
tion through the transformations and ameliorations of 
science and art. In both cases the agents of this 
transformation are human hearts, human wills and 
human hands. Whoever diverts natural forces into 
the service of man; whoever drains a marsh or clears 
a jungle, builds a bridge, tunnels a mountain or in- 
vents a labor-saving machine; whoever cheapens a 
product necessary for the sustenance of man, stays the 
progress of infection, pestilence or famine, or lightens 
the burdens of the weary and the heavy laden, is an 
agent, under Providence, for the physical regenera- 
tion of the world, and is acting an acceptable part in 
the grand drama of life. And so in the moral world, 
whoever increases the sum of human happiness or di- 
minishes the sum of human misery; whoever extends 
 
-P-A-G-E-250
  250 APPENDIX 
the horizon of the human intelligence, lends inspira- 
tion to noble living and makes it easier to walk in the 
paths of righteousness; whoever dries up a source of 
vice, substitutes an innocent pleasure for a corrupting 
passion, makes virtue lovable and sin loathsome, is 
fulfilling his destiny as a man and is one of God’s. 
instruments for converting the kingdoms of this world 
into the kingdoms of the Lord and of his Christ. 
The work of reformation is therefore the highest 
type of human activity; and taking the term in its 
comprehensive and legitimate sense, it should be the 
aspiration of every human being to become a reformer. 
No human being has the right to live without making 
the world better, and as much better as he has been 
blessed with talent and opportunity. No one has a 
right to lead a life of passive enjoyment, always re- - 
ceiving but never giving; and much less has any one 
the right to make the world worse for his having lived 
init. This, in outline, is what I mean by a theory. 
of life, and is also in outline the theory of life which 
I wish to commend to you. I wish to urge you to 
devote your lives to the work of human reform, and 
to set before yourselves the ambition to add somewhat 
to the grand total of human happiness and virtue. 
In the best sense of the term, every human life must
-P-A-G-E-251

be aggressive in welldoing, and in this divinely or- 
dained mission we must all be members of the Church 
militant; we must do our part toward the redemption 
of the world from wretchedness, ignorance and sin. 
In the moral world, as in the physical, there is 
going on an upward transformation tending to life, 
beauty and righteousness; and also a downward trans- 
formation as surely tending to death, deformity and 
unrighteousness. In all ages of the world there have 
been heroic men and women, saintly in aspiration and 
life, who have drawn humanity upwards towards holi- 
ness and truth; and during all these ages the world 
has been filled with men and women of coarser mould, 
many of whom have been the pronounced champions 
of disorder and vice. Sometimes, and especially when 
our field of view is contracted, we conclude that the 
dominant forces are evil, and then we fall into 
the slough of pessimism; but when we take a broader 
survey of the world, and read the history of morals 
more attentively, we find room to believe that the pre- 
vailing transformation is the upward one toward light 
and life. Surely if each generation of men had been 
tending downward by never so little, the whole world 
by this time had been one Sodom; but it is doubtless 
true that at no other yeriod in the world’s history have 
 
-P-A-G-E-252
  252 APPENDIX 
there lived so many men and women of heroic and saintly 
mould as now. The type of family life has never been 
so high. Public reprobation of sin has never been so 
prompt and so just. It has never been so easy to lead 
a life of moral serenity and sweetness. There has 
never been so much beauty and hopefulness in the 
world. There has never been such abundant reason 
tc thank God for the blessedness of living and work- 
ing. Into your theory of life I wish you would put 
this radiant and inspiring optimism. Be trustful in 
God and in the omnipotence of goodness. Be hopeful 
of mankind and ever look on the brighter side of 
human life. 
The age of martyrs has not passed, but martyrdom 
has taken so many forms and has become so common 
that it has ceased, save in extreme cases, to strike the 
public eye. To-day, in all quarters of the globe, there 
are Christian missionaries with all the fervor and in- 
trepidity of Saint Paul, men and women who, with 
their lives in their hands, turn their backs on civiliza- 
tion and kindred, and joyfully condemn themselves to 
privations and exile to the end that they may aid in 
establishing the promised kingdom of peace and good 
will among men. Was there ever martyrdom more 
conspicuous or more saintly than that of Father
-P-A-G-E-253
A THEORY OF LIFE 253 
Damien? Such a life gives new dignity and grandeur 
to human nature and sensibly exalts the standard of 
human virtue and duty. I see no reason why we may 
not say Saint Damien as reverently and as truly as 
Saint Stephen. We may be sure that whether in 
ancient times or in modern such lives and such sacri- 
fices are well pleasing to God. 
Every true life must embody the spirit of sacrifice 
and self-denial. If we receive and enjoy, it must be 
to the end that we may add to the stock of others’ 
enjoyment. We must see them raised at least to our 
own plane of privilege; and while we thus abandon 
the old satisfaction of passive enjoyment, we shall find 
even a keener and purer pleasure in those activities 
which result in others’ good. The sensible pleasure 
we take in adding to our own stock of knowledge is 
very great; but the pleasure we feel while informing 
another human soul is much greater. It is more 
blessed to give than to receive, and the most beatific 
life is one which is inspired and purified by the spirit 
of self-sacrifice. 
As the instance is modern, let George Peabody 
serve as one term of contrast; let his history typify 
the kind of life that comports with human dignity and 
human destiny. For the other term of the contrast 
 
-P-A-G-E-254
  254 APPENDIX 
select one case of the thousands that force themselves 
on public notice, say that of the man whose occupa- 
tion is to put the bottle to his neighbor’s lips, whose 
income means profligacy, wretchedness, degradation, 
disgrace and hideous death. Has the doctrine of two 
mighty and opposing forces, known as good and evil, 
ever seemed to you no more than an ethical theory? 
In any city or village which you chance to know count 
up all its benevolent and beneficent institutions, such 
as schools, churches, hospitals, etc., and then count 
up the saloons, gambling rooms and other haunts of 
vice. Is there not here an awful hand-to-hand con- 
flict between real men of flesh and blood? What is 
assailed and what defended? Innocence, virtue, hap- 
piness, honor, everything that is noblest and best in 
human life. When the powers of evil so greatly out- 
number the powers of good, what prevents human 
society from falling into absolute and hopeless ruin? 
It must be that the innate tendency of human nature 
is upward, and that good is mightier than evil. It is 
into this conflict that you must enter as active com- 
batants if your life is to have a meaning and a 
purpose. 
For purposes of right living there is no neutral 
ground that an honest man can occupy, It is not
-P-A-G-E-255
        A THEORY OF LIFE 255 
enough merely to subsist or vegetate, to float lazily 
down the stream of time; but real living must be 
aggressive; we must often make our way against the 
current, and must sometimes even turn the current in 
a new direction. The blessedness of living consists in 
an activity directed to benevolent and beneficent ends; 
and for this reason the best condition into which one 
can be born is that of honest poverty. Young man, 
if you have health, thank Heaven that you have no 
visible inheritance save a sound body and brain, a 
tender conscience and an affectionate heart. You have 
everything to live for, and every moment of your con- 
scious life may bring you its peculiar joy. Hope is 
more blessed than consummation. Pioneer life in a 
cabin is happier than a life of ease in a ceiled house. 
Activity brightens and sharpens, while indolence cor- 
rodes and dulls. If you would control your destiny 
and your happiness, place before yourselves some 
worthy and beautiful object for which to hope, pray 
and labor. 
Count it a blessing to be called to do pioneer work. 
There is nothing more inspiring than the work of 
organization. To codrdinate and set in motion forces 
which shall open some new and prolific source of 
human weal is akin to creation; and at such a pros-
-P-A-G-E-256
256 APPENDIX 
pect every noble heart will beat faster, and the active 
brain will find a happy employment for all its inven- 
tive and directive resources. Is it a little thing thus 
to project one’s thought and purpose into the future, 
and to make one’s self an active agent in blessing the 
race long after one’s name has faded from the minds of 
men? We may all aspire after this happy immortality, 
and may make it the deliberate purpose of our lives 
to re-create in some degree, not only the world of 
matter, but the higher world of man’s moral life. 
The sou! of every good man has, in an intelligible 
sense, been incorporated into the world of spiritual 
forces, just as the mind of wise men has been incor- 
porated into the world of material forces. The steam 
engine is the genius of Watt informing inert iron. 
St. Paul’s Cathedral is the soul of Sir Christopher 
Wren incarnate. This republic is the patriotism of 
Washington. There may not be a real transmigration 
of souls, but there is certainly a transfusion of genius, 
intellect and emotion. All this is simple and more 
common than it seems. As I speak I am merely 
translating the mind and heart of my teachers; and 
if I have taught you to any purpose, I shall teach 
most truly when, multiplied by hundreds, I come to 
teach your pupils. If you work in accordance with 
 
-P-A-G-E-257
A THEORY OF LIFE 257 
the theory of life which I am attempting to unfold, 
all that is best in you will become incorporated into 
your schools, and your net personality will be repeated 
in every one of your pupils. 
With each generation the work of the teacher 
begins anew, and if he will, he may taste the peren- 
nial charm of pioneer life. The child of to-day must 
be taught to read just as though no child had ever 
learned to read. Our tools, indeed, come to us by 
inheritance, but our toil is the toil of Sisyphus. The 
burden which our predecessors raised to the top of the 
hill has fallen to the bottom, and we must raise it in 
our turn just as though it had never been lifted. 
Knowledge, indeed, remains and accumulates, but 
skill perishes with the life that uses it. 
In a comparative or modified sense, the work of the 
poet, the painter, the architect and the man of letters 
has been done, and done forever. Those who toil in 
these fields must compete with the whole world and 
with all time. The best that can be done remains, 
and almost as fresh as when it came from the hand of 
the Master. In these fields the achievements of gen- 
ius confront us to inspire, but also to discourage and 
dismay. As distinguished from these well trodden 
and conquered fields, each new teacher finds a new 
v7 
 
-P-A-G-E-258
258 APPENDIX 
world as the sphere of his activities, and he may ed- 
dress himself to the task of a new creation. 
Debt, used in the sense of obligation, is the normal 
and necessary condition of man. On entering life, 
our whole environment, material, intellectual, moral, 
religious, social and political, is ready-made for us. 
The hands that have wrought for us, if clasped in 
line, would reach back to the dawn of human history. 
The axe that has cleared the wilderness for our fields 
has been echoing through the ages. The civil liberty 
we enjoy has cost rivers of human blood. That it is 
possible for us to worship God with no one to molest 
or make afraid is because toleration has been pur- 
chased for us by innumerable martyrs. The largest 
factor in civilization is sacrifice. The men of one 
generation have sown in tears in order that those of 
coming generations might reap in joy. Every advance 
step that humanity has taken has been made at the cost 
of tears, groans, agonies and blood. Since this indebt- 
edness of inheritance is involuntary, we are only half 
conscious of it; and many of its forms are so occult that 
they escape all but the keenest vision. Weare debtors, 
Trepeat, to the entire past of humanity, to all the gen- 
erations of men that have preceded us on the earth; 
and this debt is as real as any debt that we can volun- 
 
-P-A-G-E-259
A THEORY OF LIFE 259 
tarily contract, and the obligation to pay it is as sacred 
as any obligation that can bind a man of honor. But 
as there can be no repayment to the past, to whom 
can we discharge our debt unless to the generation 
that is to follow us? Humanity is one. From hu- 
manity we have borrowed this capital on which the 
business of life has been conducted, and to humanity 
we must return these inherited possessions with some 
rental in the way of improvements. 
It is important to note the fact that if the world is 
to grow better we must transmit more than we have 
received. Our two talents must not be buried in the 
earth, but when returned there must go with them 
other talents which they have gained by use. Into 
what we have inherited we must incorporate some 
precious element which has proceeded from our own 
creative power. For in a secondary sense we are all 
creators, coworkers with God. Whatever material 
passes through our hands, however formless and inert 
it may be, should issue from them bearing the seal of 
our creative skill. The thoughts that we appropriate 
as a part of our intellectual inheritance should be sub- 
jected to the subtile chemistry of our heart and brain 
and transformed into winged messengers of life and 
hope. Freely we have received and freely we must 
 
-P-A-G-E-260
260 APPENDIX 
give. Weare the heirs of all the ages, and we must 
transmit our inheritance in such a way that it may 
give to our successors on the earth visible advantages 
over ourselves. Their lives must be richer and fuller 
than ours, and we must impose a heavier debt on them 
than we ourselves have borne. 
If I have made myself clear in what has preceded, 
you can now understand that a college is a sort of 
clearing house for the adjustment and settlement of 
debts which have accumulated against the last genera- 
tion. We who are teachers are the agents through 
whom these debts are to be paid; while the students 
are not only receiving their own, but are, in turn, 
contracting a debt which they must pay to their suc- 
cessors on the earth. When the men who are now 
active on the stage of life provide schools for the edu- 
cation of the young, they are not engaged in alms- 
giving as some of them seem to think; but they are 
simply doing what honorable men take most pride in 
doing, paying an honest debt. As there is no possible 
escape from this inheritance in its thousand forms, so 
there is no honorable escape from this implied obliga- 
tion to spend our lives in the service of humanity. I 
sometimes hear it said that the obligation to pay for 
the education of others’ children is an injustice, and 
 
-P-A-G-E-261
A THEORY OF LIFE 261 
that to receive such an education is a humiliation. In 
a distant State I am taxed to build bridges which I 
shall never cross, to support asylums and prisons in 
which I have no personal interest, and to pay the sala- 
ries of officials whose services I shall never require. 
Is this tax, therefore, an injustice? All my life I 
have been crossing bridges which I did not build; 
should I not therefore help to build bridges for others 
to cross? The property of others has been taxed in 
order to provide means for the protection of my pro- 
perty and person. Should I not therefore take my 
turn in furnishing such protection to others? The 
inmate of that asylum for whom the public purse 
provides a home is my brother man; shall I not there- 
fore succor him? And possibly his misfortune may 
one day be mine; may I not risk a shilling on such a 
possibility without thinking it robbery? And need it 
cost us any sense of humility to cross bridges we did 
not build, to traverse streets we did not pave, or to 
worship in churches to whose support we have not 
contributed? These are public, and not private goods, 
provided by all for the benefit of all, and we may 
enjoy them with no other solicitude than a desire to 
do our part towards assuring to posterity the enjoy- 
ment of even greater blessings. 
 
-P-A-G-E-262
262 APPENDIX 
There are certain universal goods to the free enjoy- 
ment of which every human being is entitled by 
virtue of his birth, such as air, light, water and free- 
dom, and such also is education which is but another 
name for freedom. When we speak of education as 
being free, we do not mean that it is a charity, as a 
coat given to a beggar is a charity; for the utmost we 
can do is to bring it within the easy reach of every 
human soul. After this has been done it must be 
earned by the sweat of the brain if it is ever acquired 
at all. The man who would provide education for no 
children but his own, has yet to learn the art of manly 
living. 
In a former paragraph, when urging the mission of 
human reform, I had in mind the adaptation of crude 
material to higher uses, or, in more general terms, the 
re-creation of the natural world through human art. 
I will now return to this phase of my theme in order 
to discuss the subject of reform in its secondary and 
usual signification, as when we speak of educational, 
moral or political reform. Here we have in mind the 
giving of a new and better form, not to nature’s 
handiwork, but to man’s; and there is implied in this 
purpose the assumption, on our own part, that the 
existing form is wrong, How does it happen, then,
-P-A-G-E-263
A THEORY OF LIFE 263 
that human institutions stand in need of reformation? 
Reformation implies a return towards simplicity, and 
consists in restoring function to office, spirit to form, 
and content to word; or, in general, it consists in 
reuniting soul with body. Formality is always easier 
than spirituality; and the danger of mistaking form 
for spirit is always imminent. The comments of the 
rabbins on the law of Moses became so numerous and 
so authoritative that the law disappeared from sight 
and the Mishna remained; and following the natural 
course of things, there arose commentators on the 
Mishna whose comments became in turn so numerous 
and so authoritative that the Mishna was lost from 
sight and the Gemara remained, a commentary on a 
commentary on the law of Moses! In the fifth cen- 
tury B. C., the Sophists made a merchandise of 
knowledge and reduced human learning to a verbal 
formulary. The progress of human thought was 
arrested, for men were no longer dealing with ideas, 
but with terms. Then Socrates, ‘‘the cross-question- 
ing god,’’ appeared, and restored to empty forms their 
spiritual content, and so produced the first great 
intellectual reform. 
The ancient Jews had become spiritually dead be- 
cause they had lapsed completely into hollow formalism ; 
 
-P-A-G-E-264
  264 APPENDIX 
spirit had been completely divorced from letter; and 
they worshipped the letter. Then the Great Teacher 
appeared whose mission, in his own words, was to 
fulfill; that is, to restore to the words of the law 
their spiritual and living content. I need not point 
out how Protestantism, Puritanism, Quakerism and 
Methodism all had their origin and vindication in this 
tendency to exalt form over spirit. 
In the time of Charles the First the progress of 
civil freedom had been obstructed because the king 
had substituted prerogative for function. Then Crom- 
well took the case in hand, with one blow of his axe 
cut away the offending thing and restored to English 
liberty her rightful way. In France, in 1789, the 
monster that had crushed out human liberty under the 
name of kingly prerogative was hydra-headed; but 
the deliverer came, the guillotine was set up in Paris, 
her streets ran blood for a season, function was re- 
stored to office, and French liberty went on her way 
triumphant. 
In general, educational reform has consisted in the 
substitution of things for signs, or, rather, in bringing 
together word and content. This was particularly the 
mission of Comenius and Pestalozzi, whose constant 
exhortation was to study things rather than words,
-P-A-G-E-265
A THEORY OF LIFE 265 
Rousseau took a wider survey of the field of reform 
and aimed to relieve education of its conventionalities 
by bringing it back to nature, or, so far as possible, 
to the reactions of the child’s primitive environment. 
In education there is always danger of substituting the 
book for the teacher, the word for the idea which it 
represents. Reform should consist, not in displacing 
the book and the word, but in endowing teachers with 
the power of interpretation, and in learning things 
through words, or in making an indissoluble union 
between things and words. 
In all these cases, religious, political, intellectual 
and educational, the important question is whether it 
is not possible to keep the stream of thought and 
action clear of those conventional and artificial ob- 
structions, whether the periodical blocking of the 
stream may not be avoided, or at least, whether relief 
may not be applied at almost insensible intervals so 
that no violent and destructive measures may be re- 
quired. In other words, may not a peaceful and 
normal evolution be substituted for a destructive and 
reckless revolution? If I interpret history aright, 
this is the tendency of progressive civilization; and at 
least in education I feel sure that an every day refor- 
mation is possible under conditions that are not hard
-P-A-G-E-266
266 APPENDIX 
to realize, and that this evolution might avert those 
disasters known as educational reforms. I will speak 
briefly of one or two of these conditions. 
For the wise direction of educational affairs there is 
need of cultivating what might be called educational 
statesmanship: the ability to take an accurate, almost 
prophetic forecast of the current and consensus of 
human opinion as it bears on this subject, and skill in 
organizing forces which will act over wide areas and 
inspire and direct all subordinate agencies as they are 
included in the practical management of schools. 
What is the source of this forecast and this breadth 
of view? As general history is the statesman’s chart 
and logbook, so the history of educational thought 
and practice must be one source of what I have ven- 
tured to call educational statesmanship. From an 
observation of the course of educational thought in 
past time, we may infer its probable direction in the 
future; and warned by the debris of ‘‘systems’’ 
which mark the path of educational history, we may 
economize time, effort and money, and thus eliminate 
" chances of error and failure. I am firm in the belief 
that the serious study of educational history is the 
constitutional remedy for those ‘‘ inconsiderate re- 
forms ”’ or spasms which have become almost periodical
-P-A-G-E-267
A THEORY OF LIFE 267 
and may be predicted with almost as much certainty 
as tornadoes, as well as for those real crises or revolu- 
tions which result from the secular accumulation of 
abuses. 
I have said that the study of educational history 
will give us a clew to the probable direction of edu- 
cational thought; but as the course of events has been 
for the most part instinctive or impulsive, rather than 
rational, its projection into the future needs to be 
corrected by some fixed point in advance, and this 
point of direction is revealed by educational science. 
Patrick Henry was a great statesman and an incom- 
parable orator; but he was manifestly wrong when he 
said ‘‘I know of no way of judging of the future 
but by the past,’’ if he meant this for a general truth. 
The past is not necessarily to be projected into the 
future, and the future itself is subject in no small 
degree to human control. We may shape the future 
into correspondence with our ideals; we may project 
into it, not merely the past, but our own conception 
of truth and beauty; and in educational effort these 
conceptions are in part the products of scientific study. 
There is a science of the soul, there is a science of 
human duty, there is a theory of the State; and their 
point of convergence is the polestar towards which
-P-A-G-E-268
  268 APPENDIX 
humanity is verging, and by which the course of 
education is to be directed. 
In urging upon the teacher the duty of leading an 
aggressive life, and of impressing himself on the 
world for its good, I have been almost unconsciously 
drawn to the work of teaching, because I think that 
the most active and powerful agent in the upward 
transformation of society is the teacher. But it is 
not enough to have a vague sense of being useful to 
the world; effective work of whatever kind requires 
definite conceptions and aims. In what particular 
ways, then, may the teacher be a benefactor? 
One essential condition of right living is correct and 
effective thinking—the ability to divest a complex 
question for the moment of the halo of feeling, to 
analyze it by a process of cold logic, to discover its 
bearings on known principles of right and wrong, and 
to draw a conclusion which ‘shall determine one’s 
course of action with reference to it. This is what 
is comprehended in a training of the judgment, and 
the result of such training is the habit of giving in- 
stant domination to the reason over feeling and 
passion when they interfere to prevent the course of 
action. The logical engine may be trained to work 
automatically, and when this is done it makes its 
 
-P-A-G-E-269
  A THEORY OF LIFE 269 
possessor self-contained and self-poised, a law unto 
himself. These logical processes are best learned by 
dealing at first with problems which are naturally 
divested of all feeling, such as those of mathematics 
and the physical sciences; and when the faculty has 
received its training it may be applied to problems 
which are invested with feeling, such as those of his- 
tory, literature and geography. Only the eye that 
is completely achromatic is fit to perceive the truth in 
the domain of philosophy, politics and morals.* 
Real living brings a human being into close relations 
with the material world, the industrial world, the 
social world, the moral world, and the civil world; 
and the possibility of right living makes necessary a 
knowledge of these various relations. If man is to 
lead an active, positive life, there is every probability 
that he will go wrong unless he can see with some 
clearness his sphere of duty with respect to these 
various orders of activity. This, in the art of educa- 
tion, is the sphere of useful or instrumental knowl- 
edge, and constitutes what is called practical educa- 
tion. If well conducted, it assures to the learner a 
life of prosperity, usefulness, happiness and honor. 
These three things I take to be certain: every man 
*Renan, Souvenirs, p. 285. 
 
-P-A-G-E-270
270 APPENDIX 
has a right to happiness; he will seek this happiness 
in some quarter; if he does not find it in the region 
of the higher emotions he will find it in the region of 
the baser feelings and the passions. I would therefore 
make happiness one of the distinct aims of education ; 
and to this end the mind must be supplied with knowl- 
edge which will yield mental satisfaction or intellectual 
delight. No one is in a state of moral safety while 
his happiness is dependent on conditions which lie 
outside of himself; the sources from which he habit- 
ually draws his happiness should be within. This, in 
the art of education, is the sphere of culture knowl- 
edge, and embraces history, geography, literature, art 
and music, The pupil should not only be made happy 
for the present, but large provisions should be made 
for his happiness in the future. The sorrows of life 
come only too soon and they will make shipwreck of 
the human soul unless there are resources within from 
which consolation and hope may be derived. Perhaps 
there is no spiritual gift more to be coveted than 
serenity, a calmness and composure of soul which 
gives steadiness to purpose and preserves us from the 
fury of emotional storms. Make liberal provision 
for the happiness of your pupils and you will make 
pleasures unnecessary. 
    
ae
-P-A-G-E-271
  A THEORY OF LIFE 271 
Closely connected with the culture element in edu- 
cation there is another to which I can give no name, 
and which I may be unable to describe; but in im- 
portance it takes precedence of all others. I have 
seen men and women whose whole lives have been 
inspired, beautified and ennobled by high ideals that 
they have caught from some inspiring teacher. With 
bent form and hair whitening for the grave, the face 
still beams with high resolve and radiant hope. <A 
peaceful serenity sweetens a life that has experienced 
many sorrows, and a sense of personal dignity lends 
an air of grace to the commonest duties. A bow of 
promise is always in the heavens; and there is always 
some beautiful thing to hope for and to work for. The 
brow has been furrowed by the cares and sorrows of 
a long life, but it seems to reflect some of the radiance 
that falls on it from the brighter world beyond. 
Sometimes measure your teaching power by this 
standard and you may discern the best gift that I 
covet for you. Of all the good you can do in this 
world, this is doubtless the chief; and if you can do 
it you are the very ministers of God, good angels sent 
into the world to aid in its redemption. 
T can dwell only a moment on some of the endow- 
ments you will need for such a mission as I have tried 
to describe,
-P-A-G-E-272
  272 APPENDIX 
You must be benevolent in the truest and fullest 
sense of the term; your whole nature must be swayed 
and governed by a desire to do good in the world. 
The sorrows of life must melt your heart to tender- 
ness and must impel your feet to be ever running on 
errands of mercy. From moment to moment you 
must live in the consciousness that this is the prime 
service which God requires of every creature; and 
you must make every other purpose subservient to 
this. Without any austerity of manner, speech, or 
dress as a visible sign of your resolves, you must lead 
a life of devotion and even consecration. Such was 
the life of Pestalozzi, Arnold, and of the beloved 
Page, real apostles and teachers with a commission as 
sacred as though conferred by the laying on of hands. 
There is a group of moral qualities including mag- 
nanimity, charity, toleration and judicial fairness, 
which should be counted among the very best gifts 
that you can covet; and a life that is inspired and 
guided by these virtues will be mighty in good works.

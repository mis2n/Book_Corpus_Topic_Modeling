FUNDS 
The executors of the estate of Laura Spelman 
Rockefeller (Mrs. John D. Rockefeller), acting 
within the discretion given them by her will and 
in conformity with her wishes, made additional 
gifts to the Rockefeller Foundation during the 
year amounting in value to $86,860. The total 
amount received from Mrs. Rockefeller’s execu- 
tors is $427,733. From this fund $250,000 was 
given by vote of the Trustees to the General 
Education Board for its corporate purposes, and 
by that board fittingly applied upon certain 
terms and conditions to the benefit of Spelman 
Seminary. 
CONSTITUTION, BY-LAWS AND RULES 
Amendments of the Constitution and By- 
Laws were adopted during the year pertaining 
to the office and functions of the Comptroller, 
the powers of the Finance Committee, the bond- 
ing of financial officers, and access to the securi- 
ties of the corporation. A body of Rules was 
also adopted for the administration of the Inter- 
national Health Commission and the name of 
this subsidiary organization was changed to 
International Health Board.1

PUBLICITY AND OFFICIAL RECORDS 
It has been the policy of the Foundation since 
its establishment to give publicity to its acts 
through the publication of all its expenditures, 
a very wide distribution of its annual reports and 
the occasional issue of bulletins. This policy 
was formulated for the permanent guidance of 
* The Foundation appropriated $2,590,000 for war relief during 1916, 
of which sum only the amount indicated had been actually expended 
before the end of the year.

  PUBLICITY AND OFFICIAL RECORDS Bi 
the executive officers by the adoption of the 
following resolution on March 7, 1916: 
“Wuerras the Rockefeller Foundation is a chari- 
table corporation, whose funds are dedicated to public 
uses, and can best accomplish the purposes for which it 
was established by securing the interest, sympathy and 
moral support of the public, and it is therefore its duty to 
keep the public accurately informed in regard to its ac- 
tivities; and 
“Wuereas the Foundation has been established to 
further ‘the well-being of mankind throughout the world,’ 
and as a result of studies along various lines is currently 
securing information and data which would be highly 
useful to the public if broadly disseminated; be it 
“Resolved that the officers of the Foundation be, and 
they hereby are, authorized to take such steps, including 
the employment of individuals and organizations, as in 
their judgment may be necessary to accomplish these pur- 
poses.” 
As the functions and activities of the various 
boards established by Mr. John D. Rockefeller 
are not always distinguished by the public a 
pamphlet was issued during the year setting 
forth briefly the history, purposes, work, per- 
sonnel, and financial resources of the Rockefeller 
Institute for Medical Research, the General 
Education Board and the Rockefeller Founda- 
tion, including the organizations subsidiary to 
the Foundation, namely, the International 
Health Board, the China Medical Board, and 
the War Relief Commission. Revised editions 
of this pamphlet are issued from time to time. 
Full records of all transactions of the Trustees 
and of the Executive Committee are kept and 
vouchers are preserved for every expenditure

whether made on the direct authorization of the 
Trustees or the Executive Committee or by the 
officers acting under their instructions. After 
each meeting of the Trustees or of the Executive 
Committee a copy of the minutes is sent to 
every Trustee for his approval. 
INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 
The work of the International Health Board 
has expanded rapidly. To the list of countries 
in which work for the relief and control of hook- 
worm disease has been carried on the following 
were added during the past year: Ceylon, Siam, 
Salvador, and Brazil; making sixteen countries in 
all, in which the Board is co-operating with gov- 
ernments. Meanwhile certain collateral activities 
referred to in the previous report have assumed 
more definite and significant proportions. 
In fulfillment of the plans announced in the 
last report the Yellow Fever Commission en- 
tered upon its survey of actual or suspected foci 
of the disease. The Commission was composed 
of the following members: Major General Wil- 
liam C. Gorgas, Medical Department, United 
States Army, Chairman; Dr. Henry R. Carter, 
of the United States Public Health Service; Dr. 
Juan Guiteras, of Havana; Major T. C. Lyster 
and Major E. R. Whitmore, of the Medical De- 
partment, United States Army; and Mr. W. D. 
Wrightson. The Commission sailed from New 
York on June 14, 1916, and visited Ecuador,
-P-A-G-E-13
      INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 18 
Peru, Colombia and Venezuela. In order to 
reach Brazil, owing to the impossibility of direct 
communication, the Commission returned to New 
York on September 25, and sailed on October 
11 for the east coast of Brazil, returning to 
the United States on December 12, 1916. 
The Commission’s report expresses the unan- 
imous opinion of its members that the eradica- 
tion of yellow fever is feasible and that the 
present is an opportune time for beginning the 
work. Owing to war conditions there has been 
a great reduction in immigration into those 
countries in which yellow fever prevails. For 
lack of fresh human material upon which to 
“feed,” the disease is now probably at its lowest 
ebb, and therefore a determined attack on the 
remaining cases offers excellent prospects of 
success in stamping out the infection. The 
resolutions adopted by the last Pan-American 
Scientific Congress on the subject of yellow 
fever and the cordial hospitality accorded to 
the Commission in all the countries visited in- 
dicate that the necessary practical steps toward 
the control of the disease in its seed-beds will 
enlist the hearty co-operation of the peoples 
concerned. 
In accordance with authority granted by the 
Board, small experimental units for attempting 
the control of malaria by different methods were 
conducted at Crossett and Lake Village, Arkan- 
sas, and in Bolivar County, Mississippi. At    
-P-A-G-E-14
  14 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
Crossett, a town with a population of 2,029, 
control was attempted entirely through simple 
measures for the elimination of mosquitoes. In 
comparison with previous years, a remarkable 
reduction of malarial cases occurred. The num- 
ber of calls for malaria answered by the physi- 
cians of the town declined from 2,100 for the 
latter half of the year 1915 to 310 for the same 
period in 1916. This work was done within 
reasonable limits of per capita cost, and will be 
continued at the charge of the local authorities. 
Under the general direction of Dr. C. C. Bass, 
of Tulane University, microscopical examina- 
tions were made of all individuals in a selected 
area in Mississippi and the efficacy of quinine 
treatment as a measure of eradication has been 
subjected to a thorough study. It is as yet too 
early to report the results of this work. 
A commission consisting of Dr. Richard M. 
Pearce, Professor of Research Medicine in the 
University of Pennsylvania, Major Bailey K. 
Ashford, Medical Department, United States 
Army, and Dr. John A. Ferrell, Assistant Direc- 
tor General of the International Health Board, 
visited Brazil in the early part of last year, leav- 
ing New York January 22, and_ returning 
May 7. The primary object of this visit was 
to make a study of medical education and public 
health agencies. The eradication of yellow 
fever from Rio Janeiro was one of the most 
brilliant achievements of modern sanitary ad-
-P-A-G-E-15
INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 15 
ministration. The exchange of information and 
the establishment of friendly contact with a 
country which has made such a signal contribu- 
tion to the welfare of this hemisphere is clearly 
of great importance to the medical as well as to 
the other cultural relations of North and South 
America. As a result of the Commission’s visit 
arrangements have been made for the beginning 
of hookworm work on the usual basis of co- 
operation with government, and the State of 
Rio has enacted legislation creating a depart- 
ment of ankylostomiasis. The United States 
has been favored by the presence in this country 
during the same time of Dr. Carlos Chagas, the 
eminent bacteriologist of Brazil, and it is to be 
hoped that similar exchanges of visits between 
the two countries may be frequent. 
The library of the Foundation is primarily a 
special reference and working library for hook- 
worm disease. In addition to a collection of 
nearly all existing treatises and special articles 
on this disease the library contains a large 
amount of excerpted material bearing on the 
subject in health reports and scientific journals. 
This material is not only indispensable to the 
work of the International Health Board but is 
held at the service of individuals, governments, 
mining companies and other industrial organi- 
zations for which hookworm disease is a factor 
of large economic as well as humanitarian sig- 
nificance.  
-P-A-G-E-16
16 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
As a collateral activity, more or less incidental 
to the work for the relief and control of hook- 
worm disease, the officers of the Board have been 
able to acquire much valuable information and 
to render service in respect to other important 
problems of public health. The long and fruit- 
ful experience of Dr. Victor G. Heiser, Director 
for the East, as Director of Public Health in the 
government of the Philippine Islands, has made 
him an appropriate adviser of the Board in all 
its contacts with such problems. His previous 
identification with proposals for the concerted 
action of East Asiatic countries in measures to 
control beriberi has made it fitting for him to 
continue his interest in the subject and it is 
hoped that when the war is over the simple 
expedients that are necessary to abate this 
scourge will receive the concurrent approval of 
the several governments, whereby alone they 
can be made effective. 
Dr. Heiser’s observations in the East in con- 
nection with soil pollution have an importance 
over and above that which this subject possesses 
in connection with hookworm disease. In west- 
ern countries this is a question primarily of 
hygiene and cleanliness. In the East, on the 
other hand, it is also a question of direct eco- 
nomic importance, owing to the use of excre- 
ment for fertilizing purposes. The sudden 
stopping of soil pollution there would mean the 
impoverishment of the soil unless some substi- 
 
-P-A-G-E-17
    INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 17 
tute were placed within the reach of the people. 
Nosuch substitute is now available. Ifthe prob- 
lem could be economically solved in such a way as 
to utilize excrement without danger to the health 
of the people the result would not only be of vast 
economic significance to the East but might also 
prove to be of equal significance to countries 
where the same material is entirely wasted. 
The prevention of hookworm disease, in places 
such as newly developed plantations in countries 
where it has not hitherto made its appearance, 
is a subject demanding early attention. ‘Timely 
preventive methods have been proved to be 
justifiable as an economic investment and as 
such they should commend themselves to the 
managers of the industries involved. The full- 
est. possible co-operation of the International 
Health Board is at their service in this important 
branch of hookworm work. 
The report of the Director General of the 
International Health Board is supported by 
numerous statistical tables showing the volume 
of the Board’s operations in each country and the 
results so far as they can be recorded. While 
it is agreeable to contemplate large contribu- 
tions to the general welfare and happiness of the 
people among whom the Board’s work is carried 
on and while it is not unreasonable to attribute 
such results to all well-directed efforts in the 
promotion of public health, it is the purpose of 
the Director General’s report to lay emphasis  
-P-A-G-E-18
  18 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
upon facts that are susceptible of accurate meas- 
urement and record, leaving the vaguer and more 
indirect benefits to be inferred only with the ut- 
most conservatism until the future shall have 
demonstrated them more clearly. 
CHINA MEDICAL BOARD 
The report of the Director of the China Medi- 
cal Board reveals significant progress in the main 
lines of work to which the Board is devoting its 
energies. These are (1) the promotion of medi- 
cal education by the building up of schools with 
adequate personnel and equipment in Peking 
and Shanghai, and by substantial aid to the 
Hunan-Yale Medical School in Changsha;, (2) 
grants in aid to hospitals of various missionary 
organizations; (3) the granting of fellowships to 
missionary physicians and to Chinese physicians 
in order to give them the advantages of special 
study; (4) aid in the translation of medical books 
including nursing text-books. 
The organization of the Peking Union Medical 
College, as indicated by the Annual Report of 
1915, was completed in May, 1916, when the 
Trustees organized under a provisional charter 
granted by the Regents of the University of the 
State of New York. The officers of the China 
Medical Board have been authorized to proceed 
with the purchase of land, construction of build- 
ings and organization of the College on the basis 
of a preliminary estimate of the cost. The
-P-A-G-E-19
  CHINA MEDICAL BOARD 19 
Rockefeller Foundation appropriated funds for 
the purchase of land on which it is proposed to 
construct the laboratories, out-patient depart- 
ment, hospital wards, nurses’ home and religious 
buildings. Dr. Franklin C. McLean, of the 
Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, has 
been elected Professor of Medicine and Physi- 
cian-in-Chief, and the preparatory department 
will be opened in September, 1917. 
The organization of the Shanghai Medical 
College on the basis described in the preceding 
report was entrusted to a committee, but its 
report was not submitted until after the close 
of the year under review. Meanwhile the 
Red Cross Hospital, formerly used by the 
Harvard Medical School of China, has been 
leased by the China Medical Board in order to 
preserve the continuity of the clinical work and 
to give facilities to men chosen for the staff 
of the new college. Dr. Henry S. Houghton, 
formerly Dean of the Harvard Medical School 
of China, has been employed by the Board and 
placed in charge of the Red Cross Hospital. 
In addition to its contribution of $16,200 a 
year to the Hunan-Yale Medical School for a 
period of five years, the Board has appropriated 
$30,000 for the construction and equipment of a 
laboratory. This school has been fortunate in 
securing co-operation and to a gratifying ex- 
tent a sense of local responsibility on the part 
of the influential citizens of the Province. 
 
-P-A-G-E-20
  20 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
By vote of the Board appropriations made to 
missionary societies for the support of medical 
missionaries and nurses are for a term of five 
years subject to certain conditions designed to 
ensure the successful fulfillment of the purposes 
of the appropriations. Appropriations for hos- 
pitals are hereafter to be made only upon the 
understanding that the societies making appli- 
cation shall contribute at least one fourth of the 
total sum required for increase of staff, equip- 
ment or plant. 
Grants in aid have been made to the following 
missionary organizations: 
American Baptist Mission Society (North). 
Foreign Mission Board of the Southern Baptist Con- 
vention. 
American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. 
Board of Foreign Missions of the Methodist Episcopal 
Church (North). 
Board of Missions of the Methodist Episcopal Church 
(South). Board of Foreign Missions of the Presbyterian Church 
in the U.S. A. (North). 
Executive Committee of Foreign Missions of the Pres- 
byterian Church in the U. S. (South). 
Foreign Christian Missionary Society. 
London Missionary Society. 
Church of Scotland Foreign Mission Committee. 
Canton Christian College for the Canton Hospital. 
Nanking Hospital (Union). 
Huchow Hospital (Union). 
The several denominations having missions in 
Nanking have united to maintain one general 
hospital. To this general hospital the Board 
has appropriated $9,250 for annual expense con-
-P-A-G-E-21
CHINA MEDICAL BOARD 21 
        
    
    
   
   
   
   
   
    
        
   
        
     
   ditioned on the raising of $11,750 for the same 
purpose by the several missionary societies, and 
$25,000 for buildings and equipment conditioned 
on the raising of an equal amount by the mis- 
sionary societies. 
At Huchow, the Northern Baptists and South- 
ern Methodists have joined to maintain a union 
hospital costing $48,500. Toward this amount 
the China Medical Board has subscribed $20,000, 
payable when the balance shall be secured in cash. 
The Board has also pledged a total sum averaging 
about $2,000 a year to cover three fourths of the 
cost during a period of five years of a foreign 
doctor, a foreign nurse, and a Chinese doctor. 
The Board has contributed $4,500 a year for 
five years to the Canton Christian College to be 
used for the current expenses of the Canton 
Hospital, the largest hospital in China. 
The total amount appropriated for mission 
hospitals to be expended during 1916 is as fol- 
lows: 
For capital account.................... $78,704.20 
For current expenses................... 79,798 .00 
BM yee a ee a eed $158,502.20 
The further sum of $291,087 has been pledged 
to be paid during the next five years, of which 
$20,000 is for capital expenditure and the re- 
mainder for maintenance. 
The Board has contributed fellowships for 
graduate study in the United States to twenty-
-P-A-G-E-22
  22 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
seven medical missionaries on furlough from 
China. The cost of these appropriations for 
1916 will be $26,750. Seven Chinese doctors, 
of whom five have already held China Medical 
Board fellowships for a year, have also received 
grants during the year. 
The China Medical Board has assumed a 
grave responsibility to the missionary societies 
and to the people of China as well as to the 
Trustees of the Rockefeller Foundation in its 
far-reaching plans for the improvement of med- 
ical education. Hope for the successful dis- 
charge of this responsibility lies in the enormous 
opportunity which China holds out for carefully 
directed effort in this field; in the earnest co- 
operation of the missionary body in presenting 
Western medicine at its best to the people of 
China, as an adjunct of Christian civilization; 
and in the expressed intention of the Foundation 
to give adequate support to the co-operative 
program now adopted. 
PROMOTION OF MEDICAL EDUCATION 
By its gifts in recent years to Johns Hopkins 
University, Washington University (St. Louis) 
and Yale University, the General Education 
Board, a corporation distinct from the Rocke- 
feller Foundation and chartered by act of Con- 
gress in 1903, has given its support to an im- 
portant movement aimed to place the clinical 
departments of medical teaching upon a thor-
-P-A-G-E-23
  PROMOTION OF MEDICAL EDUCATION 23 
ough going university basis. The method by 
which this result has been sought has been that 
of establishing so-called “full-time” professor- 
ships of the clinical subjects, so that these 
might be taught by men sufficiently free from 
the routine of professional practice and consul- 
tation to give their time and strength wholly to 
teaching and research. 
Single-minded attention to teaching and re- 
search does not, as has been sometimes sup- 
posed, involve the substitution of the laboratory 
for the bedside. On the contrary, its advocacy 
is based on a more and more adequate appre- 
ciation of the subtlety and complexity of the 
human organism and of the consequent ob- 
scurity of the processes of health and disease. 
For this very reason the control of a university 
hospital or its equivalent, combining a varied 
and abundant clinical material with all the 
collateral resources of the laboratory, is re- 
garded as the indispensable accompaniment of 
the “full-time” plan, and those who work under 
it will have a contact with the human patient as 
intensive or extensive as their work requires. 
The student trained under such a plan for pri- 
vate practice will have much to learn of the 
practical requirements of his profession. The 
same is true of the graduate of a course in in- 
dustrial chemistry or law. He will learn from 
practice what only practice can teach. But he 
will bring to his work a disciplined mind thor-
-P-A-G-E-24
  9 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
oughly impregnated with the scientific spirit— 
a spirit that can be acquired best, if not solely, 
from teachers who are thoroughly imbued with 
it. The successful practitioner, thus trained, 
with his numerous patients and his comfortable 
income, may acquire a proficiency no less worthy 
than that of the university clinician, but a 
different proficiency. Of two men equally able 
one may be at his best in one calling, and one 
in the other, while neither could fill the other’s 
shoes. The advocacy of university professor- 
ships of medicine or surgery, strictly so-called, 
is intended not only to differentiate these two 
callings but to raise the standard of both—to 
improve the private practitioner by giving him 
higher scientific ideals and a better discipline at 
the one time of life when he is most amenable to 
both; to improve the teacher and researcher by 
making it possible for him to subordinate all 
other considerations, whether pecuniary or so- 
cial, to the training of his pupils and the ad- 
vancement of medical science. 
During the past year the General Education 
Board by vote of January 27, 1916, invited the 
co-operation of the Rockefeller Foundation in 
such measures as should be recommended “‘for 
the development of medical education in im- 
portant centres of the country.” The Trustees 
of the Foundation having immediately expressed 
their readiness to consider specific reeommenda- 
tions to this end, a communication was received
-P-A-G-E-25
  PROMOTION OF MEDICAL EDUCATION 25 
from the officers of the General Education 
Board on October 25, 1916, setting forth a 
“Plan for the Development of Medical Educa- 
tion in Chicago.” The plan described the 
means which appeared to be feasible whereby 
a medical school of high rank might be estab- 
lished as an integral part of the University of 
Chicago, with a hospital and full-time staff of 
its own, reinforced by the co-operation and re- 
sources of certain other local institutions and 
funds, making the aggregate value of the plant 
and endowments thus brought together about 
$14,300,000, of which $5,300,000 would need to 
be raised. In response to these representations 
the Trustees of the Foundation then adopted the 
following resolution: 
“ Resolved that the Trustees of the Rockefeller Founda- 
tion have learned with profound interest of the plan by 
which it is hoped to create within the University of Chi- 
cago a medical school of high rank and adequate resources, 
and that the Executive Committee be, and they hereby 
are, authorized to make such contribution not exceeding 
one million dollars ($1,000,000) through the General 
Education Board as shall seem wise to the Committee 
for the accomplishment of the above purpose, as set 
forth in the communication of October 23, 1916, from 
the officers of the General Education Board, payment 
to be made in such instalments as the Committee shall 
approve.” 
Since the close of the year under review 
private subscriptions have been assured to the 
amount necessary for the inauguration of this 
great project for a university school of medicine 
in Chicago.

  26 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
It should be stated in this connection that 
while the Rockefeller Foundation has shown its 
disposition to co-operate with the General Edu- 
cation Board in the promotion of medical edu- 
cation, it does not itself entertain applications 
for gifts in this field, but refers to the General 
Education Board those who are concerned with 
such applications. 
MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH 
It will be apparent to anyone comparing the 
activities of the various boards established by 
Mr. John D. Rockefeller, that they have all 
touched the great field of medicine and public 
health in one or another of its aspects. The 
province of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical 
Research is to extend the bounds of human 
knowledge in everything pertaining to the 
causes and nature of disease, its treatment and 
prevention. In the performance of this function 
the Institute, while concentrating its resources 
at any particular time upon selected fields of 
work, ascribes worth and importance to all 
relevant studies, whether dealing with the fun- 
damental facts and laws of organic life, or with 
the more direct application of those facts and 
laws to the problems of particular diseases. The 
General Education Board, by its co-operation 
with American universities, is helping them to 
raise the standards of medical education and 
research. The China Medical Board is be-
-P-A-G-E-27
  MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH 27 
ginning a similar service to China, by strengthen- 
ing the foundations of institutions in that coun- 
try upon which the Chinese themselves will be 
enabled to build up their own structure of medi- 
cal education, research and public health. The 
International Health Board, by its world-wide 
campaign for the relief and control of hookworm 
disease, by its plan of eradicating yellow fever, 
its studies of measures for the control of malaria, 
and its large program of public health as set 
forth in the resolutions establishing the Board 
in 1913, is aiding the movement whereby the 
steadily increasing knowledge applicable to the 
prevention of disease is brought to the actual 
service of governments and peoples. 
It is hardly necessary to point out the correla- 
tion of these main activities or the essential 
unity of the program of human betterment, 
which together they represent. But although ~ 
the three elements of research, education and 
hygiene are all here represented, it has become 
more and more evident that the importance of 
the third element, hygiene, including public 
health and preventive medicine, has thus far 
failed of adequate recognition. Three serious 
evils are attributable to this failure; first, the 
lack of a sufficiently broad and sound basis of 
scientific knowledge for the systematic promo- 
tion of public and personal hygiene; second, the 
1 Annual Report, 1913-14, p. 11.
-P-A-G-E-28
  28 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
lack of a well-defined career as an attraction to 
able men whose interest is in this field rather 
than in the practice of medicine; third, the lack 
of due emphasis, in the training of practitioners 
of medicine, upon the importance of hygiene 
and of the practitioner’s réle as an apostle of 
hygiene no less than of therapy. 
In the rapidly extending work of the Inter- 
national Health Board, calling for men ade- 
quately trained in public health, the fact has 
been only too well demonstrated that until very 
recently no body of men with such training has 
existed except as the health services of nation, 
state, and municipality have laboriously created 
it out of the ranks of medical practitioners, or as 
men trained in bacteriology or sanitary engi- 
neering have been able to step into positions re- 
quiring a command of those specialties. Con- 
sequently, the Board has had to borrow expe- 
rienced men from other services, or to train its 
own men in the field—a training which though 
always essential can be made much more eco- 
nomical and productive if applied to men prop- 
erly grounded in the principles and methods of 
preventive medicine as well as in the funda- 
mental medical and engineering subjects. In 
this respect the experience of the Board has been 
identical with that of every public health or- 
ganization which has striven to keep abreast of 
the time. Young men with a good professional 
training have been few and far to seek.
-P-A-G-E-29
  MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH 29 
These considerations led the Trustees of the 
Rockefeller Foundation, by a resolution adopted 
December 20, 1913, to invite the attention of 
the General Education Board to the subject 
of professional training for public health work. 
The Board immediately undertook an inquiry 
into the subject and called a conference of prom- 
inent representatives of public health teaching 
and administration from different parts of the 
country. The results of this conference were 
crystallized and developed in a report prepared 
by Dr. William H. Welch and Mr. Wickliffe Rose, 
in which the ideals and organization of an insti- 
tute of public health were set forth. A special 
committee consisting of executive officers of the 
General Education Board, the Rockefeller Foun- 
dation and the International Health Board was 
then appointed to consider the more concrete 
aspects of the subject, including the location 
and mode of organization of the proposed in- 
stitute. A report from this committee was 
transmitted to the Trustees of the Foundation 
and considered by them at their meeting of 
January 26, 1916.1 After full discussion a reso- 
lution was adopted “that an Institute of Public 
Health should be established” and the special 
committee was directed to recommend the steps — 
to be taken to bring the institute into existence. 
At a meeting of the Executive Committee, April 
1See Appendix V, pp. 415-427. 
 
-P-A-G-E-30
  30 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
11, 1916, it was decided, upon recommendation 
of the special committee, to proceed with the 
elaboration of the plan in conference with the 
authorities of Johns Hopkins University. On 
May 24, 1916, the proposals of Johns Hopkins 
University for the organization of a School of 
Hygiene and Public Health were approved by 
the Trustees of the Foundation and referred to 
the Executive Committee with power; and on 
June 12, 1916, it was 
“Resolved, that the executive officers be authorized to 
inform the President of Johns Hopkins University that 
the Rockfeller Foundation is prepared to co-operate with 
the University in the establishment of a School of Hygiene 
and Public Health for the advancement of knowledge and 
the training of investigators, teachers, officials and other 
workers in these fields.” 
At the same meeting an appropriation of 
$267,000 was made to Johns Hopkins University, 
to cover the cost of a building and site and cer- 
tain preliminaryexpenses. On the following day, 
when the establishment of the School was made 
known at the Commencement Exercises of the 
University, its Trustees announced the appoint- 
ment of Dr. William H. Welch as Director of the 
School and of Dr. William H. Howell as Assist- 
ant Director and head of the Department of 
Physiology. 
The School of Hygiene and Public Health is 
to be an integral part of Johns Hopkins Univer- 
sity. . It will be co-ordinate with the Medical 
School while drawing largely upon the resources
-P-A-G-E-31
  MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH 31 
of the latter, and of the Engineering and other 
departments of the University, to supplement the 
more specialized instruction in public health 
branches. But the central and vitalizing fea- 
ture of the School will be an institute of research 
in the sciences underlying hygiene and pre- 
ventive medicine. 
Much credit must be given to other institu- 
tions, notably the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology, Harvard University, the University 
of Pennsylvania and the University of Michigan, 
for having led the way in research and technical 
training for public health work and to the dis- 
tinguished sanitarians in national, state and 
municipal service for having in the face of almost 
overwhelming odds, created the nucleus of a 
new profession. American achievements in pre- 
ventive medicine are among the best fruits of 
the new scientific era in our country. What is 
now needed is a more general recognition of 
public health work as offering to the ablest 
talent an attractive career, comparable in dig- 
nity and importance with medicine and the other 
established professions. Signs are not wanting 
that this recognition is beginning, and that the 
demand for trained health officers will more 
than keep pace with the output from the schools. 
It is to help meet this demand, including that for 
the supplementary training of men already pos- 
sessed of practical experience, as well as to 
foster research, that the school at Baltimore 
2

has been established. While the growth of the 
work of the International Health Board and of 
the China Medical Board and the demands of 
other large undertakings above mentioned in 
the domain of medicine and public health point 
to the concentration of the Foundation’s re- 
sources in a few great fields, the Trustees have 
during the past three years aided a number of 
organizations that promise to have a marked 
influence on the diffusion of public health 
knowledge in this country. Among these may 
be mentioned the National Committee for the 
Prevention of Blindness, the National Com- 
mittee for Mental Hygiene, the Training School 
for Dental Hygienists connected with the Van- 
derbilt Clinic, and the American Social Hygiene 
Association, all of which will be found on the list 
of the past year’s expenditures. It is not con- 
ceived to be the function of the Foundation to 
assume the burden of current support for such 
organizations. The Trustees have believed, 
however, that by aiding them at what has been 
the pioneer stage of their activities, results would 
be obtained which would not only be very far- 
reaching, but would help to secure that degree 
of public support to which such organizations 
may appropriately aspire.

  ROCKEFELLER INSTITUTE 88 
ROCKEFELLER INSTITUTE FOR MEDICAL 
RESEARCH 
The complete list of gifts and appropriations 
printed in the Treasurer’s Report contains 
several appropriations both by the Trustees and 
by the Founder to the Rockefeller Institute for 
Medical Research. These appropriations, in 
part for current expenses and in part for building, 
following an appropriation of $1,000,000 for 
endowment made in the previous year, attest the 
confidence of the Trustees of the Foundation in 
_ the usefulness of money invested in productive 
research. It is of the very essence of modern 
scientific work that it should be subjected to 
universal discussion and criticism. By the same 
token its results when established come nearer to 
being of universal human benefit than any other 
form of philanthropic service; none other more 
truly, in the words of the Foundation’s Charter, 
promotes “the well-being of mankind through- 
out the world.” 
EPIDEMIC OF INFANTILE PARALYSIS 
The City and State of New York were sorely 
stricken by the epidemic of infantile paralysis 
which occurred during the past year. The total 
number of recorded cases for the State was 
13,476 of which 9,290 were within the City of New 
York. At a meeting called by the Mayor of 
New York on July 12, a committee was ap- 
pointed by the Mayor to consider measures for 
 
-P-A-G-E-34
84 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
the discovery and continuous observation of 
persons having had contact with known cases of 
infantile paralysis, so that possible consequences 
of such contact might be observed and fresh 
cases promptly reported and isolated. The 
committee having tentatively formulated meas- 
ures to this end, in co-operation with the De- 
partment of Health, the Foundation appro- 
priated the sum of $50,000, or so much thereof 
as might be needed, for the assistance of the 
Department of Health through the agency of 
the Mayor’s Committee. Dr. Alvah H. Doty, 
formerly Medical Officer of the Port of New York, 
was appointed Director of the work, and it was 
systematically carried on by him until the end 
of the epidemic. An appropriation was also 
made to defray the cost of similar work in the 
City of New Rochelle. 
As the summer advanced and the number of 
cases greatly increased, it became apparent that 
the proper after care of survivors left crippled 
by the disease would severely tax the surgical and 
charitable resources of the city, and that there 
was grave danger that large numbers of children, 
especially those apparently only slightly par- 
alyzed, might become seriously and perhaps 
needlessly crippled unless they could have 
prompt orthopedic advice and treatment. A 
conference of leading orthopedic surgeons of New 
York and other cities was called at the office of 
the Foundation in order that advice might be
-P-A-G-E-35
  EPIDEMIC OF INFANTILE PARALYSIS 35 
obtained as to the best way in which the Founda- 
tion might be of service. In conformity with 
the advice received the Foundation gave its 
support to a committee organized by the Com- 
missioner of Health, for the purpose of co- 
ordinating the efforts of the various hospitals, 
dispensaries and charitable agencies, so as to 
minimize the possibility that cases should be 
neglected from lack of knowledge of available 
facilities for treatment, or from lack of means. 
An initial appropriation of $25,000 was made by 
the Foundation for the promotion of after care, 
nearly all of which was assigned to meet the 
administrative expenses of the New York Com- 
mittee on After Care of Infantile Paralysis 
Cases, and classes for the special training of 
orthopedic nurses were organized through the 
generous co-operation of Dr. Robert W. Lovett 
of Boston. Appropriations were also made to 
the Brooklyn Bureau of Charities, in whose 
district a large proportion of the paralysis cases 
oceurred, toward the actual cost of treatment 
and nursing; and to the State Charities Aid 
Association to meet expenses incurred by the 
Association in co-operating with the State. De- 
partment of Health, which had efficiently or- 
ganized and promoted the after care of para- 
lyzed cases outside of New York City. An 
appropriation was also made to the Rockefeller 
Institute for Medical Research for the extension 
of its researches in infantile paralysis.

    36 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
MENTAL HYGIENE 
Reference was made in the annual report for 
1915 to the assistance given by the Foundation 
to the National Committee for Mental Hygiene 
in carrying out a series of surveys in several 
states in regard to institutional provision for the 
insane. These surveys have been carried on 
during the past year and some of them are still 
in progress. Their fruitfulness and the con- 
fidence of the Foundation in the timely value of 
the general activities of the National Committee 
for Mental Hygiene has been such as to lead 
them to extend the loan of Dr. Thomas W. 
Salmon’s services for the scientific direction of 
the Committee’s work. 
During the year a plan was developed for the 
establishment of an adequate medical service at 
Sing Sing Prison in which an important place 
was assigned to the psychiatrical department. 
For this department the Foundation appro- 
priated $10,000 through the National Committee 
for Mental Hygiene. The discovery of mental 
abnormalities or disease is important for the 
humane adaptation of the penal, custodial, or 
therapeutic treatment to the needs of the 
individual prisoner; but it is not less important 
for the reason that it makes it possible to 
eliminate from the consideration of strictly 
penological problems the complications due to 
abnormal or pathological conditions.
-P-A-G-E-37
  WAR RELIEF 37 
WAR RELIEF 
The amount of expenditures for war relief 
during the past year has been such as to neces- 
sitate the continuation of the War Relief Com- 
mission, both for the supervision of work aided 
by the Foundation and for the investigation of 
needs that were being brought to its attention. 
Early in the year Mr. Warwick Greene, Director 
of Public Works in the Philippine Islands, re- 
signed that position to accept appointment as 
Director of the War Relief Commission, and 
sailed for Europe in March. He was accom- 
panied by Mr. William J. Donovan, of Buffalo, 
as a member of the Commission. Before Mr. 
Greene’s arrival Mr. Frederic C. Walcott,<a 
member of the firm of William P. Bonbright & 
Company, had been appointed a member of 
the Commission, for the purpose, first, of in- 
quiring into conditions in Belgium, and later 
of making a similar inquiry in Poland. In co- 
operation with a representative of the Com- 
mission for Relief in Belgium, and at the re- 
quest of the German authorities, Mr. Walcott 
visited Poland and lent his best efforts to the 
revival of the plan for importing relief supplies 
into that country and distributing them there 
as had been permitted by the several belligerent 
governments in the case of Belgium. The 
diplomatic negotiations on this subject, with 
which Mr. Walcott and later Messrs. Warwick 
Greene and Donovan were associated, proved
-P-A-G-E-38
    
38 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
unsuccessful, but the need in Poland, while 
subsequently mitigated with respect to certain 
articles of diet available locally, was still so 
serious with respect to other essential com- 
ponents of a living ration, and to clothing, that 
the devising of measures for bringing relief, in 
some form acceptable to all the governments 
concerned, continued for the whole year to 
engage a large share of the Commission’s 
attention. In the hope that these efforts might 
prove successful, and in order that prompt ad- 
vantage might be taken of any favorable open- 
ing, the Trustees at their meeting of May 24, 
1916, appropriated the sum of $1,000,000 for 
relief in Poland, Serbia, Montenegro and Al- 
bania. The Balkan countries were included 
with Poland in this appropriation in order that 
they might profit by any arrangement per- 
mitting the importation of supplies into terri- 
tory occupied by the Central Powers. 
In September arrangements were consum- 
mated for importing a limited amount of con- 
densed milk into Poland from Switzerland, and 
for the remainder of the year a quantity of milk 
was thus imported sufficient to eke out the 
ration of about sixteen thousand children in 
Warsaw and Lodz. The children thus fed were 
chiefly those between the ages of one and a half 
and five years, the infants under one and a half 
years having already been given the preference 
in the distribution of existing supplies of milk.
-P-A-G-E-39
  WAR RELIEF 39 
All of this relief work, initiated by Mr. Warwick 
Greene, was under the personal direction of 
Mr. Reginald C. Foster, of the War Relief 
Commission, upon whose guarantees as to the 
faithful delivery of supplies to their destina- 
tion the continuation of the relief has depended. 
Local committees were organized in both War- 
saw and Lodz to supervise the delivery of food, 
the committees consisting in each case of the 
representative of the Rockefeller Foundation, 
the American Consul, and a number of Polish 
citizens of high standing in the community. 
In the transactions above described, as in all 
the activities of the War Relief Commission, 
its members have regarded themselves as strictly 
accountable to the supervisory authorities of 
the governments concerned and have scrupu- 
lously observed all the limits set upon their 
activities by the exigencies of the war. Upon 
no other condition could an agency whose oper- 
ations are necessarily carried on in part under 
the supervision of one group of belligerents, and 
in part under that of their opponents, enjoy the 
respect and confidence of the military and civil 
authorities." 
For the proper conduct of the work of the 
War Relief Commission it was found advisable 
to establish headquarters in Berne, Switzer-

-P-A-G-E-40

land, with a small office staff. With this base 
of operations the Director of the Commission 
has been able to keep in fairly close contact 
with matters requiring his attention in all the 
adjacent countries, and particularly with the 
work done by the Foundation in co-operation 
with the generous people of Switzerland, in 
offering a refuge for Belgian children from the 
fighting zone. In this undertaking the Founda- 
tion has had the sympathetic assistance of the 
Belgian Relief Committee of New York, which 
contributed $25,000; the Belgian Relief Com- 
mittee of New England, which contributed 
$10,000, and the Refugees’ Relief Fund, which 
“ made an initial gift of $1,000 followed by 
monthly contributions amounting in all to 
$3,000. The total cost of this work, approxi- 
mating $75,000 for a maximum of five hundred 
children in the first year and $51,000 in the 
second year, if necessary, was guaranteed by 
the Foundation. 
As will be seen in the table accompanying the 
appended report of the Chairman of the War 
Relief Commission, the Foundation continued 
to make appropriations for Armenian and Sy- 
rian Relief ($590,000), for the aid of Belgian 
professors in England ($15,000), for relief in 
Serbia, through the American Red Cross ($30,- 
000), for the welfare of prisoners of war through 
the International Committee of Young Men’s 
Christian Associations ($200,000), and for re-
-P-A-G-E-41
WAR RELIEF 41 
lief work in Turkey, through the American Red 
Cross ($25,000). 
The admirable work for prisoners of war done 
by the International Committee of Young Men’s 
Christian Associations and by the International 
Red Cross at Geneva, and the activities of some 
scores of prisoners’ relief agencies conducted in 
Switzerland and elsewhere were made the subject 
of special study by the War Relief Commission 
with a view to ascertaining whether these various 
activities might not, through some co-operative 
arrangement, become even more serviceable to 
the five or six millions of able-bodied men in 
prison camps whose welfare is a matter of such 
deep concern to their respective countries. ‘ This 
subject was brought before the Trustees in the 
latter part of the year under review, and the 
Director of the War Relief Commission was 
authorized to make such further inquiries as 
might be necessary to determine the feasibility 
of larger and more effective measures for the 
relief of prisoners. A conditional appropriation 
of $500,000 was made for this purpose. 
For medical research at the seat of war the 
Foundation has continued its appropriation 
through the Rockefeller Institute, to which 
reference was made in the last annual report. 
A part of this appropriation was applied during 
the year to research on the subject of shock at 
the Belgian Red Cross hospital in La Panne, 
and the Institute had the good fortune to enlist 
   
-P-A-G-E-42
    
42 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
the services of Professor William T. Porter of 
Harvard University in this study. 
TUBERCULOSIS IN FRANCE 
From time to time during the past year appeals 
were made to the Foundation in behalf of 
agencies formed to combat the increase of tuber- 
culosis in France. After a preliminary report on 
the situation had been made by Professor 
Wallace C. Sabine of Harvard University, a 
member of the War Relief Commission, the 
Trustees of the Foundation requested Dr. Her- 
mann M. Biggs, Commissioner of Health of 
the State of New York, to visit France in order to 
study the situation more fully and to recommend 
what aid if any a foreign agency might render in 
co-operation with the public authorities. The 
French Government expressed its cordial sym- 
pathy with Dr. Biggs’s mission and he sailed for 
Europe on January 9, 1917, as a member of the 
War Relief Commission. He was accompanied 
by Dr. Alphonse R. Dochez of the Rockefeller 
Institute as his assistant and Mr. Geoffroy 
Atkinson of Columbia University as secretary 
and interpreter. 
SOLDIERS’ WELFARE WORK ON THE MEXICAN 
BORDER 
On the application of the International Com- 
mittee of Young Men’s Christian Associations, 
the Foundation made two appropriations of 
$50,000 each for the welfare work so promptly
-P-A-G-E-43
  INTERSTATE PALISADES PARK 43 
and efficiently organized by that Committee for 
the benefit of the soldiers of the United States 
Army serving on the Mexican border. The 
Foundation also contributed $15,000 for the 
purchase and distribution of small circulating 
libraries to be maintained at the recreation 
centres of the various brigades. 
The importance of providing educational, 
recreational, and religious opportunities for men 
in camp has been so conclusively demonstrated 
in this country and in Europe that it is hard to 
see how a factor bearing so directly on the morale 
of troops and hence upon their fighting efficiency 
can hereafter be omitted from any intelligent 
system of military “preparedness.” But the 
greatest significance of this work is suggested 
by the potentiality for good or ill that lies in any 
such large aggregation of men, drawn largely 
from civil life and eventually to return to their 
home communities, either broadened and dis- 
ciplined by their experience, or demoralized both 
morally and physically. 
INTERSTATE PALISADES PARK 
In response to an appeal made on behalf of the 
Interstate Palisades Park Commission, a body 
created with identical personnel by separate 
action of the states of New York and New 
Jersey, the Foundation made a contribution 
of ,$1,000,000 to the Commission toward a 
fund of $5,000,000 raised in part by legislative
-P-A-G-E-44
  44 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
appropriation and in part by private subscrip- 
tions. This large gift for an isolated project 
lying outside the fields to which the attention of 
the Trustees has been chiefly directed was occa- 
sioned by the emergency which threatened the 
destruction for commercial purposes of the one 
portion of the Hudson Palisades not previously 
secured to the public enjoyment and by the 
urgency which attached to the early preserva- 
tion of an extended region back of the Palisades 
in addition to the areas already acquired by the 
Interstate Commission. The Palisades are a 
national monument of great beauty, worthy to 
be held forever as one of the most precious 
possessions of the American people. The great 
park of which they form a part has been saved 
for the recreation and enjoyment of all classes 
of the population in the metropolitan district; 
and its preservation in anticipation of the time 
when that district must inevitably become a 
desert of brick and stone, relieved by only a few 
urban parks, is sure to become recognized as a 
thoughtful provision for future generations com- 
parable with that which, half a century ago, by 
the creation of Central Park, conferred a price- 
less boon upon the New York of to-day. It 
is happily true that the Palisades Park is already 
availed of by hundreds of thousands of the 
masses of the people in this day and generation; 
and it is a source of profound satisfaction to the 
Trustees of a Foundation which owes its cor-
-P-A-G-E-45
  INTERSTATE PALISADES PARK 45 
porate existence to the State of New York to 
have been enabled to give this immediate token 
of obligation to its people. 
The Foundation has shown by two substantial 
gifts its recognition of the vital and urgent im- 
portance of two closely related interests of the 
people of the United States. The first is the pre- 
empting, before it is too late, of such available 
areas as are necessary, whether for urban or 
suburban parks, or for the more extensive state 
and national forest reservations. The second is 
the protection of birds and other forms of wild- 
life, many of which are in danger of extinction, 
such protection consisting in part of federal 
and state game laws and in part of wild-life 
refuges whether within the bounds of parks and 
forests reserved also for other uses or in lowland 
and marsh districts marked off for this special 
purpose. By its purchase and dedication in 1913 
of the Grand Chenier Tract of 85,000 acres on the 
southern shore of Louisiana as a refuge for birds 
and other forms of wild-life, and by its contribu- 
tion to the Interstate Palisades Park in 1916, the 
Foundation has sought to confer a public benefit 
measurable not only by the immediate usefulness 
of these two tracts, but also by such aid and 
encouragement as have been given to a move- 
ment of national extent and importance—a 
movement which ought to engage the timely and 
liberal support of both public and private funds.

FOUNDER’S REQUISITIONS 
The Treasurer’s Report contains the custom- 
ary list of Founder’s Requisitions—by which is 
meant appropriations for objects designated by 
Mr. John D. Rockefeller and approved by the 
Trustees as coming within the corporate pur- 
poses of the Foundation. These requisitions 
are made in accordance with Mr. Rockefeller’s 
letter of gift of March 6, 1914, reserving $2,000,000 
from each year’s income for this purpose. While 
many of Mr. Rockefeller’s beneficiaries under 
the terms of this letter, are, and were ex- 
pected to be, local or denominational charities 
in which his interest is largely personal, it will 
be noted that not a few are closely identified 
with the broader interests of philanthropy, 
among which are to be noted the Rockefeller 
Institute for Medical Research, the National 
Board of the Young Women’s Christian Asso- 
ciation, the International.Committee of Young 
Men’s Christian Associations, Cornell Univer- 
sity and the Training School for Public Service 
of the Bureau of Municipal Research. 
EXTRA COMPENSATION TO EMPLOYEES 
In recognition of the increased cost of living 
due to the abnormal conditions caused by the 
European war, an additional and special com- 
pensation equal to fifteen per cent of the current 
annual salary was appropriated by the Executive 
Committee to each regular employee attached

to the New York office, the amount being pay- 
able January 5, 1917. It was understood that 
this was not an increase of the regular salary and 
did not create a precedent for the future. Simi- 
lar action was taken by a large number of 
private business houses and commercial insti- 
tutions in New York City and elsewhere in rec- 
ognition of conditions that, by common ac- 
knowledgment, bore with special severity upon 
salaried workers.

I. GENERAL SUMMARY 
i 
THE YEAR IN BRIEF 
During the year 1916 the work of the Inter- 
national Health Board continued to be directed 
chiefly toward the relief and control of hook- 
worm disease. In codperation with Govern- 
ment, systematic efforts toward control have 
now been inaugurated in eight of the Southern 
States and in fifteen foreign countries located 
between degrees of latitude 36 north and 30 
south in the tropical and sub-tropical belt which 
is the native habitat of the hookworm. New 
fields of operation in 1916 were Salvador, Brazil, 
Ceylon, and Siam. Arrangements were also 
completed to start work early in 1917 in the 
Fiji Islands, in Papua, and in Queensland, 
Australia. 
In British Honduras and the island of Bar- 
bados, preliminary infection surveys were made; 
and in the Yangtse-kiang Valley of Central 
China a preliminary survey was carried out with 
special reference to the problem of soil pollu- 
tion in shallow mining operations. 
The Board conducted during the year a series 
of four experiments in malaria control. Three 
were finished. The fourth will be completed in 
58 
   
-P-A-G-E-54
  
BA INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 
1917. The object of all four experiments was to 
determine the degree to which malaria could be 
controlled within the limits of reasonable expen- 
diture and under conditions prevailing in typical 
farm communities of the South. Gratifying 
results have been obtained. 
Two commissions were sent to South America. 
One, composed of six sanitarians, with Major 
General William C. Gorgas as chairman, visited 
the Republics of Ecuador, Peru, Colombia, 
Venezuela, and Brazil to study yellow fever 
conditions. Two definite objects were sought: 
(1) to determine the status of doubtful endemic 
centers of infection; (2) to ascertain what 
measures were necessary and feasible to eradi- 
cate the disease from the localities responsible 
for its dissemination. The second commission * 
investigated medical education and public health 
agencies in Brazil. Each of the above activities, 
as well as minor undertakings, will be reviewed 
in subsequent sections of this report. 
Evolution of Working Methods 
Experience derived from working in many 
countries, with their great diversity of races, 
languages, and racial prejudices, is gradually 
evolving working methods adapted to diverse 
conditions. In this, the staff has been fortunate 
in meeting with a universally cordial reception 
and generous codperation on the part of Govern- 
ment officials and the medical profession in the  
-P-A-G-E-55
GENERAL SUMMARY 55 
countries visited or in which work has been be- 
gun. It has also been fortunate in encountering 
a Governmental attitude of great patience in 
dealing with native populations—an attitude 
that accomplishes results by persuasion rather 
than by force. The field staff has endeavored 
to show the same patient spirit and as a result 
has found happy issues out of emergencies which 
could not otherwise have been overcome—emer- 
gencies arising from illiteracy, superstition, 
religious intolerance, and apathy on the part of 
native populations. The working methods that 
are wrought out in one field are immediately 
available for use in every other similar field. 
Thus, a director who enters a new territory now 
has a vast amount of experience upon which to 
draw in making plans. 
Development of Field Staff 
Inasmuch as the success of the work in any 
area is largely dependent upon the personality, 
character, and general fitness of the director in 
charge, in making selection for field directors 
great care is taken to choose men who, after a 
period of probationary training, may become 
qualified to act in administrative positions. 
During 1916 the field staff was increased from 
twenty to thirty-six members. In making the 
new appointments the Board gave preference to 
physicians under thirty-five years of age who 
had received an academic degree, who had a
-P-A-G-E-56
  56 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 
medical degree from an institution of recognized 
standing, and who had served a hospital interne- 
ship of at least twelve months. In the few 
exceptions to these requirements, the candidates 
presented a record of excellent training for the 
service or possessed unusual personal qualifica- 
tions. 
Training of Recruits 
It is the policy of the Board to place no medical 
officer in a position of administrative responsi- 
bility until he has stood the test of practical 
work in the field. In 1916 the islands of Trini- 
dad and Ceylon were used as training centers. 
These remote locations, however, offered serious 
disadvantages. The work could not be super- 
vised adequately from. the home office, and 
unnecessary expense was involved in transport- 
ing to places so distant, untried men who might 
not prove satisfactory. For these reasons it was 
decided to transfer the training centers to a con- 
venient section of the Southern United States. 
The Board selected North Carolina. Dr. B. E. 
Washburn, formerly in charge of the training of 
recruits in Trinidad, is director of the new 
station. 
When the recruit has received preliminary 
training in North Carolina, he completes his 
probationary period under an experienced di- 
rector in a foreign country located as near as 
possible and presenting similar problems to the
-P-A-G-E-57
GENERAL SUMMARY 57 
region in which he is to do independent work. 
Tf he is to serve in Latin America, his training is 
completed in a Latin-American country in 
which work is being done; if he is to serve in the 
British West Indies, he is trained on one of those 
islands. By this plan, a trustworthy idea of the 
capabilities of each new director is gained and 
the director himself secures as thorough equip- 
ment as possible for his future effort. 
Publications and Exhibit Material 
The need of satisfactory printed matter and 
exhibit material for use of field officers has 
become increasingly urgent. Accordingly, with 
the assistance of a number of medical men and 
special artists, original material was prepared 
during the year to illustrate the story of hook- 
worm disease. This equipment includes small, 
light, easily transportable, and durable lecture 
charts adaptable for use in any language; the 
same material, with suitable text, in the form of 
a chart for schools; a set of about fifty selected 
lantern slides and an accompanying popular 
lecture designed to furnish sufficient information 
to enable a man to give an intelligent talk; an 
illustrated leaflet telling in language which young 
children will understand the story of the hook- 
worm and its importance to every child of the 
South; and other similar printed matter. The 
Board codperates with boards of health, boards 
of education, and other exhibitors in supplying 
 
-P-A-G-E-58
  58 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 
this material, as well as slides, photographs, and 
specimens of hookworms, for exhibits and teach- 
ing purposes. 
In 1912 and 1913 Dr. E. K. Strong, Jr., of 
George Peabody College for Teachers, and Dr. 
C. W. Stiles, of the United States Public Health 
Service, made a study of the relation of hook- 
worm disease to the physical and mental devel- 
opment of children. Their report was published 
in 1916. A Spanish edition of the Board’s 
second annual report was also prepared and 
sent to medical journals, medical schools, public 
health officers, government officials, and many 
private individuals in Latin America. 
Collection of Information 
A vast amount of literature written in many 
languages was collected during the year. A 
special bibliography was made on the incidence 
of hookworm disease in mines. Much informa- 
tion also was gathered on medical education and 
public health agencies. All of this material was 
classified, indexed, translated, and made avail- 
able for the guidance of the officers of the Board 
and other interested persons. 
Coéperation with Tropical Diseases Bulletin 
The Tropical Diseases Bulletin, a publication 
issued under the auspices of the British Govern- 
ment, has created a special department for 
recording work for the relief and control of hook-  
-P-A-G-E-59
GENERAL SUMMARY 59 
worm disease. The object is “to devote period- 
ically a section to an account of the various 
hookworm campaigns in progress from time to 
time in tropical regions, and to supplement the 
summaries of the official reports issued by the 
International Health Board with abstracts of 
the more interesting local details and observa- 
tions made by the medical officers in charge to 
the local officers in their periodical reports.” 
The Bulletin is widely circulated in tropical 
countries; it will therefore give to the work 
desired publicity. 
II 
RELIEF AND CONTROL OF HOOKWORM DISEASE 
Active measures to control and prevent hook- 
worm disease are now in operation in Kentucky, 
Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South 
Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia; in 
Antigua, Grenada, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, and 
Trinidad of the West Indies; in British Guiana 
and Dutch Guiana; in Costa Rica, Guatemala, 
Nicaragua, Panama, and Salvador of Central 
America; in Brazil; and in Ceylon and Siam of 
the Far East. 
Complete Infection Survey 
A new and valuable development of the serv- 
ice is the complete infection survey which gives 
to Government and to the Board definite infor-
-P-A-G-E-60
  60 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 
mation upon which to base a future working 
program. 
Two such surveys were made in 1916, in Bar- 
bados and in British Honduras, respectively. 
They brought to light many striking facts. 
They showed particularly the important rela- 
tion between geological structure and hook- 
worm infection. The greater part of the island 
of Barbados is composed of porous coral lime- 
stone, which allows rapid seepage and percola- 
tion. The ground dries quickly, a condition 
unfavorable to the growth of young hookworms, 
and even though the thin superlying stratum of 
soil is polluted by fecal matter, this matter may 
easily seep away during subsequent rain. The 
smaller portion of Barbados, known as the 
“Scotland district,” has an underlying struc- 
ture of impervious sandstone and clay. This 
picturesque, highland district shows heaviest in- 
fection; it is estimated that in it 25,000 persons 
suffer from hookworm disease within an area of 
less than twenty-five square miles. The amount 
of infection in the island is further modified by 
the exceedingly low rainfall. In 1913 the rain- 
fall was 46.16 inches; in 1914, 36.9 inches; in 
1915, 56.7 inches. The average rainfall for a 
tropical country is about 100 inches; in British 
Guiana it is more than 200 inches. 
In British Honduras, when other contributing 
factors have been eliminated, the rate of infec- 
tion is seen steadily to increase as one travels
-P-A-G-E-61
  GENERAL SUMMARY 61 
south, following a change in geological formation 
from porous limestone to impervious clay. The 
average rainfall of British Honduras is about 81 
inches. 
Interesting data as to race distribution of 
hookworm disease were also brought out by the 
two surveys. In British Honduras the greatest 
incidence is found among Indians and Mestizos, 
the latter being a mixture of Spanish and In- 
dian blood. The Negro-creoles who have lived 
in the colony for several generations are, clinic- 
ally speaking, almost immune. In Barbados 
the “poor whites”’ bear the brunt of the disease, 
as is indicated from personal appearance and 
hemoglobin tests. The blacks, though heavily 
infected, do not deteriorate to such a degree as 
the white population. 
A great lack of knowledge on the part of 
native populations as to the dangers attendant 
on soil pollution, has been found in all tropical 
countries in which the Board has worked. A 
recent sanitary inspection of Barbados showed 
that of 4,240 houses visited, 2,132 had no sani- 
tary conveniences; 1,387 had water closets or 
latrines; the remaining 721 had holes or recep- 
tacles of a primitive sort, or none. In British 
Honduras, in all parts of the colony outside the 
city of Belize, both in district capitals and in 
rural settlements, fecal contamination of: the 
soil is universal. As a result, hookworm disease 
is making increasingly serious ravages among
-P-A-G-E-62
  62 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 
agricultural workers, as is recognized by planters, 
particularly in the southern districts. 
Hookworm Infection in Mines 
Germany has spent over $2,500,000 in direct 
outlay to control hookworm infection in a few 
of its mines. The disease has been brought 
under reasonable control in the mines of Wales 
and Belgium. It is known to be prevalent in 
many of the mines of France, Hungary, Spain, 
Sicily, California, South America, and China. 
Until 1916 the Board had not undertaken 
directly the relief and control of hookworm 
disease in mines, though by supplying literature 
it had stimulated active measures in some of the 
mines of Ecuador and California and had awak- 
ened interest in the subject in certain tin mines 
of Spain. The field, however, offers large oppor- 
tunity for service with but small expenditure of 
funds. 
Infection Survey of Yangtse-kiang Valley 
In 1916 the Yale Medical School, through a 
subvention by the Board, carried out a partial 
infection survey in the Yangtse-kiang river 
valley of Central China, a vast agricultural 
region in which extremely active shallow coal 
mining and antimony mining operations have 
sprung up since the beginning of the world war. 
The entire valley, so far as examined, was found 
to be infected, the infection being greatest among
-P-A-G-E-63
GENERAL SUMMARY 63 
farm coolies and miners, particularly in the 
provinces of Hunan and Kiangsi. 
Economic Importance of Human Excrement to China 
The hookworm problem in China presents 
unique features because of the economic impor- 
tance of human excrement as a fertilizer and a 
source of revenue to the state. It is the only 
fertilizer available in sufficient quantities to 
supply agricultural needs. China has no sewer- 
age system. Each night in urban centers the 
excrement is collected by male and female coolies 
who carry it in wooden buckets to temporary 
storage depots outside the city walls. To these 
depots farmers and gardeners go in tank boats 
to purchase supplies, which they convey up the 
rivers to their plantations of rice and mulberry. 
There they dig the excrement into the fields or 
moisten it with water and sprinkle it over grow- 
ing vegetation. A relatively light infection in 
Chinese cities may thus become a serious factor 
in spreading the disease to agricultural districts. 
More than one hundred thousand miners, 
largely recruited from farmers who have worked 
barefoot in the moist, larva-infected soil, are 
employed in the mines of Hunan province alone. 
The Government authorities and mine owners 
have waked to the seriousness of this situation 
and have made inquiry of the Board regarding 
the nature of hookworm disease and possible 
measures for its control. As a result, a plan of 
3
-P-A-G-E-64
    64 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 
codperation in a program of sanitary reform 
has been entered into between the Board and 
the mining interests of Hunan and Kiangsi prov- 
inces. Dr. F. C. Yen, dean of the Yale College 
of Medicine at Changsha, has been placed in 
charge of the initial stages of the work. Dr. 
Yen is at present in the United States, studying 
systems of public health work, in preparation 
for the undertaking in the mines of China. 
Sewage Disposal in Rural Districts 
It becomes increasingly apparent as the work 
of the Board progresses that the solution of the 
problem of soil pollution in rural districts, both 
of this country and foreign countries, would have 
a far-reaching effect in lowering death rates and 
furthering public health. Typhoid, dysentery, 
diarrheal diseases, especially those of infants in 
summer time, and similar enteric infections, are 
in large measure due to this widespread custom 
of polluting the soil. 
There is still diversity of opinion among public 
health officials as to the best method of disposal 
of human excrement in rural communities with 
limited means. In its work for the control of 
hookworm disease, the Board has made it a 
rule to codperate in the installation of such de- 
vices as are recommended by the departments 
of health in the several states and countries. 
In January, 1916, provision was made for 
carrying out, under the direction of the Rocke-
-P-A-G-E-65
GENERAL SUMMARY 65 
feller Institute for Medical Research, a study of 
the relative efficiency of various types of latrines 
suitable for farm use. The investigation will 
cover several years. It is hoped that as it 
progresses many sanitary experts will become 
interested and codperate in the undertaking. 
Uncinariasis Commission to Orient 
In 1914 the Director General, while visiting 
the Federated Malay States, was impressed with 
the amount of hookworm disease and malaria 
which prevailed in that section. The local 
medical profession seemed divided as to which 
of these two diseases was the real menace to 
working efficiency, and as to the interrelation 
between the two. In 1915 an Uncinariasis Com- 
mission, with Dr. S. T. Darling as chairman, 
was sent out to investigate this problem. The 
Commission has now completed its work in 
Malaya and in Java, and has proceeded to the 
Fiji Islands in order to continue the study in a 
country where hookworm disease is not ‘compli- 
cated with malaria. 
Tir 
MALARIA CONTROL 
Four experiments in malaria control were car- 
ried out during 1916 at different points in the 
lower Mississippi river valley. In each a differ- 
ent line of investigation was pursued, the object
-P-A-G-E-66
  or ee rg ree 
66 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 
being to discover a practical method of control 
which the average rural community could afford. 
Experiments in Bolivar County, Mississippi 
An experiment was conducted under the ad- 
ministration of the Mississippi Department of 
Health, with Dr. W. S. Leathers as Administra- 
tive Director and Dr. C. C. Bass of Tulane 
University as Scientific Director. The prac- 
, ticability of control through detecting the car- 
riers and freeing them of the malaria parasites, 
was tested. The experiment covered two hun- 
dred twenty-five square miles of territory, the 
size of the communities varying from nine to 
sixteen square miles, with an average popula- 
tion of one thousand. Adjoining communities 
were taken up one after another as facilities 
permitted, the work in each lasting about four 
weeks, with subsequent visits to insure thorough- 
ness. Blood tests were taken. Quinine treat- 
ment was given to those found infected. The 
experiment will be continued in 1917. 
Experiments at Lake Village and Crossett, Arkansas 
Three experiments were carried out, two at 
Lake Village and one at Crossett, in codperation 
with the United States Public Health Service 
and under the general supervision of the late Dr. 
R. H. von Ezdorf. Assistant Surgeon R. C. 
Derivaux and Dr. H. A. Taylor were in charge 
of the work.
-P-A-G-E-67
GENERAL SUMMARY 67 
At Lake Village, 103 homes were selected from 
plantations in the immediate vicinity of the 
town. These 103 homes were divided into 
groups: in Group A, control was based on 
screening; in Group B, on the issuance of 
prophylactic doses of quinine; in Group C, on 
a combination of the two measures. A fourth 
group of houses was kept under observation 
as an experiment in negative control. The 
experiments at Lake Village have been com- 
pleted, but it is too early to announce their 
results. 
The experiment at Crossett was based on 
mosquito control without major drainage opera- 
tions. The work consisted of the draining and 
re-grading of natural streams so as to secure 
rapid off-flow, the filling of bottoms, the digging 
of ditches, the removal of accumulated vegeta- 
tion, and the systematic use of oil and other 
larvacidal substances by sprays and automatic 
drips. A remarkable decrease in the number 
of malaria calls resulted. During the last six 
months of 1915 there were 2,100 malaria calls in 
Crossett; during the last six months of 1916, 
310 calls. In October 1915, there were 600 calls; 
in October 1916, 46 calls. In December 1915, 
there were 100 calls; in December 1916, 4 calls. 
Thus, at the end of 1916, the malaria index had 
been brought far below the normal winter level 
and was approaching the zero point. (See 
chart, page 69.) As a result of the steady
-P-A-G-E-68
    
68 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 
decrease in malaria cases, community interest 
in Crossett was aroused to take over the work 
for 1917, with a view to making it perma- 
nent. A similar experiment was also under- 
taken and is now in progress at Hamburg, 
Arkansas. 
IV 
WORK OF THE YELLOW FEVER COMMISSION 
The work of the Yellow Fever Commission 
resulted in defining the problem, so far as South 
America is concerned, and in preparing the way 
for extending into new areas definite measures 
for the eradication of yellow fever infection. 
The Commission consisted of Major General 
William C. Gorgas, Dr. Juan Guiteras, Dr. 
Henry R. Carter, Major T. C. Lyster, Major 
Eugene R. Whitmore, and Mr. William D. 
Wrightson. It was appointed early in the year 
and sailed from New York on June 14. It 
finished its work in December, after a period of 
investigation of approximately six months’ dura- 
tion. 
Cordial Reception by Government 
In each country visited the Commission met 
with a cordial reception from Government 
officials, who showed appreciative recognition 
of its distinguished personnel and of the spirit 
of service to humanity which had prompted its

visit. All that could be done was done to facili- 
tate the investigation. Public records were dis- 
played, hospitals and health organizations were 
shown, medical boards were convened in con- 
sultation, and many social courtesies were ex- 
tended. These tokens of good will and interest 
facilitated greatly the progress of the investiga- 
tion. 
Findings of the Commission 
The Commission reported that so far as it 
could determine, the only endemic center for 
yellow fever in South America at present is 
Guayaquil, Ecuador. Peru seems free from 
infection, but certain sections of Colombia, 
Venezuela, adjacent West Indian islands, and 
the entire east coast of Brazil call for close 
observation. 
The problem of yellow fever eradication re- 
solves itself into the following specific under- 
takings: (1) the elimination of the infection 
from Guayaquil, the chief seed-bed of infection 
now existing in South America; (2) the keeping 
under observation of the east coast of Brazil and 
the southern littoral of the Caribbean sea, and 
the undertaking of intensive work for the control 
of yellow fever infection at any point where it 
may be discovered; (3) the extension of the 
investigation to Mexico and West Africa, which 
regions are under suspicion, but have not yet 
been examined. 
 
-P-A-G-E-71
GENERAL SUMMARY 1 
Adoption of Working Plan 
The Board has appointed General Gorgas to 
direct the practical work of eradication along 
the three lines mentioned. It was expected that 
the work would begin in March, 1917. On ac- 
count of war developments, however, it has been 
necessary to postpone the greater part of the 
undertaking. 
v 
MEDICAL COMMISSION TO BRAZIL 
The Medical Commission to Brazil, composed 
of Dr. Richard M. Pearce, chairman, Dr. John 
A. Ferrell, and Dr. Bailey K. Ashford, sailed 
from New York on January 22, and returned on 
May 7. Its inquiries covered the ground of 
medical education, hospitals and dispensaries, 
public health agencies, and sanitary progress. 
Codperation for Hookworm Control 
As a result of the visit, the Government of 
Brazil has asked the Board’s codperation in 
carrying out demonstrations in hookworm con- 
trol in selected areas in the States of Rio de 
Janeiro, Sao Paulo, and Minas Geraes, and on an 
island in the harbor of Rio de Janeiro in the 
Federal District. The Government has created 
a Department of Uncinariasis and appointed 
as its Director the Board’s representative, Dr. 
L. W. Hackett, who will have charge of the 
four demonstrations mentioned above.
-P-A-G-E-72
  
72 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 
Education in Medicine and Hygiene 
The Commission submitted an illuminating 
report on Medical Education in Brazil. As an 
outgrowth of this report and of the personal 
relations established by the Commission in 
Brazil, negotiations are under way looking 
toward a codperative arrangement between the 
Board and the Sao Paulo Medical School for 
the establishment of a department of hygiene 
in that institution. The plan covers a period of 
five years. During this time the head of the 
new department will be an American sent from 
the United States. Two scholarships will be 
awarded to promising young Brazilians who will 
come to the United States for special training 
in hygiene and public health and then return to 
Sao Paulo to serve on the staff of the school. If 
the department succeeds, at the end of the 
five-year period the Government of Brazil will 
take over the undertaking and bear the entire 
expense, which will temporarily be met by the 
Board. 
A scholarship arrangement has also been 
made with the Bello Horizonte Medical School 
in the State of Minas Geraes. The incumbent 
will come to the United States in 1917 for 
special study, with a view to his return to Bello 
Horizonte to be head of the department of 
pathology.

  GENERAL SUMMARY 73 
VI 
ESTABLISHMENT OF SCHOOL OF HYGIENE AND PUB- 
LIG HEALTH AT BALTIMORE 
The Board, as well as other public health 
agencies in the United States, has been greatly 
handicapped in its work by the fact that hitherto 
there has been no school in this country pre- 
pared to give adequate training in public health. 
It is fundamental that the men whom the Board 
employs shall have had such training; that is, 
that before being placed in charge of work in 
the field, they shall not only receive a medical 
degree but shall be familiar with the problems 
in sanitary chemistry, industrial hygiene, bacte- 
riology, protozodlogy, and kindred subjects with 
which the public health officer is constantly con- 
fronted. 
The Executive Committee of the Board on 
May 27, 1915, asked that the matter be called 
to the attention of the General Education 
Board. As a consequence, the Rockefeller 
Foundation has established in Baltimore, in 
connection with the Johns Hopkins University, 
a School of Hygiene and Public Health. The 
new institution will open in October, 1917, with 
Dr. William H. Welch as Director and Dr. 
William H. Howell as head of the department of 
physiology. It will be closely associated with 
the Hopkins medical school, hospital, and school 
of engineering. It will offer instruction and re-
-P-A-G-E-74
  
14 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 
search facilities in hygiene, sanitation, and pre- 
ventive medicine to medical students, engineers, 
chemists, biologists, and especially to men who 
desire to fit themselves for careers in public 
health. 
The school will supply three urgent needs of 
the Board: 
(1) It will furnish a body of trained men upon 
which the Board may draw in recruiting its field 
staff; and to the men who are now in the service 
it will offer special opportunities for additional 
training. 
(2) It will serve as a center to which students 
from other countries may be sent for training in 
hygiene and public health, with a view to their 
returning to their own countries to become 
teachers and investigators, or to fill important 
positions in public health administration. The 
Board is prepared to codperate with other 
countries, as opportunity offers, in developing 
public health agencies and in establishing schools 
and departments of hygiene in which teachers 
and public health workers may be trained. 
When the new institution at Baltimore opens in 
October, 1917, among its students will be en- 
rolled a limited number of foreign students who 
will have been selected on the basis of availabil- 
ity for public health service in their native 
countries. It is expected that in some of the 
foreign countries from which such students come, 
facilities will be offered, in turn, to students
-P-A-G-E-75
  GENERAL SUMMARY 15 
from the United States who may be interested 
in the study of tropical and other diseases. 
(3) The new school will serve as a laboratory 
to which the Board may go for aid in solving 
some of the scientific problems which it meets 
in its work, and for specialists whom it can send 
out to investigate special diseases in regions 
where they are endemic. To the school, the 
Board on its side will supply a body of interest- 
ing and fresh material from tropical countries 
and will give opportunity for research and 
practical field experience. This relation of close 
codperation, it is hoped, will be shared also by 
municipal and ‘state departments of health and 
by the United States Public Health Service.

INCIDENTAL ACTIVITIES 
Without loss of time or expenditure of funds, 
and without allowing themselves to be diverted 
from primary undertakings, members of the 
staff have been able to render many incidental 
services which in the aggregate constitute an 
important contribution to the work of the year. 
For example, when the Yellow Fever Com- 
mission was in Lima, Peru, the mayor of the 
city called the engineer of the commission into 
consultation concerning a new water supply 
system which was about to be installed. The 
modifications suggested provided for a more 
 
-P-A-G-E-76
  76 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 
effective installation at a lower cost than that 
contemplated in the original plans. As a result, 
the engineer was asked to supervise the installa- 
tion of the plant. In response to a similar 
request, the commission inspected the hospitals 
and laboratories of Lima and gave aid in formu- 
lating a new plan of administration. 
The Director for the East, in his travels during 
the year, was called into frequent consultation 
with reference to plans for tropical hospitals, 
the organization of health services, the making 
of laws and regulations for the control of leprosy, 
and for the treatment of persons afflicted with 
beriberi and yaws. 
These concrete examples illustrate fields of 
activity in which it is hoped that greater service 
will be rendered in future. They all contribute 
toward the ultimate purpose for which the 
Board was established: the control of special 
diseases; the encouragement of the development 
of public health agencies; and the spread of the 
knowledge of scientific medicine.

Il. SUMMARY OF ACTIVITIES AND 
RESULTS BY STATES AND 
COUNTRIES? 
SOUTHERN STATES 
During the year 1916, work for the control 
of hookworm disease in the Southern States 
showed definite progress. The chief feature of 
the advance was directed against soil pollution. 
In this undertaking the working force was en- 
larged; the area of operation was extended to 
include the entire county; the time devoted to 
each county was lengthened from three or four 
months to approximately one year; and a pro- 
gram was developed which provided, within the 
one-year period, for definite_ reduction in the 
prevalence of hookworm disease and a marked 
improvement in home sanitation. 
Public sentiment has backed the work. State 
and county appropriations show a decided in- 
crease. A movement is under way to develop 
the county force into a permanent department 
of health, ultimately to be maintained with state 
and county funds, and to assume responsibility 
not only for the completion of the work of hook- 
worm control but for the advancement of other 
measures pertaining to public health.

section of the report, see Addenda, pages 277 to 280.

Cobperative work with the Southern State 
Boards of Health began in 1910. For the first 
two years the undertaking was educational, 
seeking by demonstration, by illustrated lec- 
tures, by the distribution of literature, and by 
other means, to convince the people that hook- 
worm disease was a reality, and that it was 
a serious menace to health which could and 
should be eradicated. In 1912, as a nucleus 
‘or this endeavor, county dispensaries were 
established for the free treatment of all per- 
sons who applied. The dispensaries were widely 
distributed at five or more points in the county, 
and on one day of each week for five succes- 
sive weeks or longer, free clinics were held at 
each dispensary point. The people took advan- 
tage of this opportunity. They were urged to 
do so by the press, by the practicing physi- 
ciass, and by teachers and influential citi- 
zens who set an example by having them- 
selves examined. 
The dispensary plan was successfully operated 
in over seven hundred of the more heavily in- 
fected counties. It paved the way for the in- 
tensive type of work, which, in addition to 
maintaining a central dispensary, carries the 
work into every corner of the community by a 
house-to-house inspection. Since the intensive 
plan is now in universal use throughout the 
South, a brief review of its development and 
method of operation will be given.
-P-A-G-E-79
  
SOUTHERN STATES 79 
Development of the Intensive Plan 
The first experiment in the intensive method 
of hookworm control was conducted in the latter 
part of 1913 on Knott’s Island, a fishing hamlet 
of 567 inhabitants, located in Currituck Sound, 
off the extreme northeastern coast of North 
Carolina. Five hundred sixty persons were 
examined. Ninety-three were found infected 
and were treated. Microscopic re-examination 
showed that practically all of these were cured. 
In its effort to eradicate the infection per- 
manently, the undertaking fell short on the sani- 
tary side, as at the time the staff was unable to 
recommend a suitable type of latrine. How- 
ever, the results were sufficiently encouraging to 
warrant similar undertakings during 1914 at 
various points in Virginia, North Carolina, 
South Carolina, and Louisiana, the four states 
that were first to complete the dispensary work. 
The working staff in the beginning consisted 
of a medical officer, termed a “‘field director,” 
and a trained lay assistant, termed a “micros- 
copist” or “health inspector.” These two men, 
by persistent effort and by confining their atten- 
tion to one small rural community of five or six 
hundred people, could, within a period of three 
or four months, treat practically every infected 
person and secure great reduction in the degree 
of soil pollution. Experience showed, however, 
that it was not practicable to achieve one 
hundred per cent control in any demonstration 
 
-P-A-G-E-80
  80 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 
if ultimately the work of sanitation were to be 
placed on an economic basis within the reach of 
the average rural community. Accordingly, in 
1915, further developments were introduced 
with a view to increased efficiency. 
First, the number of health inspectors under 
each field director was increased to three, the 
object being, without enlarging overhead ex- 
pense, to increase the number of people reached 
and the extent of territory covered by a given 
working staff. This provision proved so satis- 
factory that in 1916 the working force was again 
enlarged to include a field director and a suffi- 
cient number of health inspectors to cover an 
entire county, in approximately one year, taking 
the communities series by series. 
By the end of 1916 the unit of working force 
had come to consist of a field director and five 
to ten health inspectors; the county had become 
the unit of operation; and eight months to one 
year had been adopted as the most satisfactory 
time unit for county work. In some states the 
field director served directly under the State 
Health Officer, and in others under a State 
Director who in turn served under the general 
supervision of the State Health Officer. 
Present Method of Work 
In conducting a campaign by the intensive 
plan the director who is in charge establishes 
an office at the county seat or at some other
-P-A-G-E-81
  SOUTHERN STATES 81 
point convenient to all of the communities in 
the series to be worked. This central office 
keeps financial records, distributes publicity 
material, makes microscopic examinations, tabu- 
lates on specially prepared blanks detailed statis- 
tics of the house-to-house sanitary survey, and 
prepares local maps on which are shown the 
homes, roads, streams, school houses, churches, 
and other features pertinent to the work. 
The field work is done by the health inspectors, 
who report to the central office. They visit the 
people, inspect their premises, and urge changes 
necessary to provide each family with a latrine 
of a type approved by the State Board of Health. 
The health inspector advises as to the location of 
the latrine, and frequently supervises the manual 
labor of construction. He leaves at each home 
containers in which are placed the specimens of 
feces, which are later collected and sent to the 
central office for examination to determine the 
presence of parasites. In short, through per- 
sonal contact with the people, the inspector does 
all in his power to further sanitation and a 
general knowledge of disease prevention. 
Devices to Gain Coéperation 
The working force has discovered many in- 
genious devices to gain the codperation of the 
people. Two agencies brought particularly good 
results in the state of Mississippi in 1916. One 
was the publishing each week in the county 
   
-P-A-G-E-82
  82 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 
newspaper of a. list of heads of families who had 
brought their latrines up to the standard ap- 
proved by the State Board of Health. In For- 
rest county this list aroused local interest where- 
ever the work was in progress. Each family 
wished to be recorded on the honor roll as early 
as possible. (See clipping, page 83.) 
A second device to obtain codperation was 
employed in the communities in Pearl River 
county, Mississippi, in which intensive work was 
conducted. A large, carefully prepared map 
giving the location of every. home was posted in 
a conspicuous place in the community. As each 
householder completed the sanitary program a 
ring was drawn around the dot on the map 
which indicated his home. The map became a 
topic of community conversation. As the scales 
tipped in favor of those who had completed the 
work of sanitation, further delay for the remain- 
ing families became increasingly embarrassing. 
(See map, page 85.) 
Evidence of Growing Interest in Home Sanitation 
Growing interest throughout the South in 
hygiene and in sanitation of the home may 
fairly be ascribed in part to the intensive work. 
One notices that screening against flies and mos- 
quitoes is gaining in popularity. It is also 
significant that the directors of the State Divi- 
sion of Morbidity Statistics in two states have 
mentioned an apparent reduction in the preva-

lence of typhoid fever and also of dysentery and 
diarrhea in the areas in which intensive sanitary 
work has been conducted. The incidence of 
these diseases in the areas worked, as compared 
with their incidence elsewhere, would have to be 
observed for a large number of communities and 
for a long time to warrant drawing definite con- 
clusions, but these statements are worthy of 
mention. 
The progress of State Health Officers in secur- 
ing increased appropriations from states and 
counties for the enlargement of their health 
programs, of which the intensive work for hook- 
worm control is one phase, also affords gratifying 
evidence of greater public appreciation of health 
measures in general. 
Resulting Permanent Agencies 
Still another and even more significant out- 
growth is the fact that the demonstrations are 
creating among the people a demand for per- 
manent agencies to continue and enlarge the 
work. The first definite development in this 
direction occurred in North Carolina. It pro- 
vides that each of ten counties undertake a 
definite health program for a three-year period. 
The work outlined for the control of soil pollu- 
tion diseases will consume the major portion of 
the first year. Gradually, the staff will be 
converted into a county health department and 
the program expanded.

For the support of the undertaking each county 
will pay 50 per cent of the cost for the first year 
and a larger amount in succeeding years. The 
remainder of the expense during the three- 
year period will be shared equally by the North 
Carolina State Board of Health and the Inter- 
national Health Board. 
Measurable Reduction in Infection Secured by Dispensary 
Method 
Under the dispensary plan of work, because of 
the brevity of the campaign, it was exceedingly 
difficult to obtain concrete information as to the 
degree to which hookworm disease was controlled. 
The four to eight weeks during which work was 
carried on in a given county was too short a 
period to admit of adequate re-examination of 
persons who had been treated. The intensive 
method has been used in fifty-five counties, in 
thirty-five of which the dispensary method was 
formerly employed. The following figures are 
significant: 
In these thirty-five counties, 63,882 persons 
were examined by the dispensary plan. Of 
these, 37.5 per cent were found to be infected 
with hookworm disease. At the beginning of 
the intensive work in the same areas, usually 
from three to five years after the completion of 
the dispensary work, 34,727 persons were ex- 
amined. The infection was found to be 26.5 
per cent. Thus, in spite of the opportunities
-P-A-G-E-87
SOUTHERN STATES 87 
offered over a period of years for cases of new 
infection or re-infection to arise, it will be seen 
that the infection recorded in intensive work 
was 11.0 per cent lower than that recorded in 
dispensary work, indicating that as a result of 
the dispensary work the number of persons in- 
fected with the disease was reduced approxi- 
mately one third. The method of comparison 
may be open to error; the number of persons 
examined and the per cent of decrease are, how- 
ever, sufficiently large to be significant. A more 
limited comparison, including only persons who 
were examined by both methods, indicates that 
the estimate of reduction is conservative. Prac- 
ticing physicians and field directors state, more- 
over, that they now encounter but few of the 
severe cases of infection which were so frequently 
seen in 1910 and 1911. 
Sufficient time has not yet elapsed since the 
adoption of the intensive method to warrant a 
tabulation of the percentage of reduction in in- 
fection which it has secured. It can reasonably 
be estimated, however, that this percentage is 
greater than that secured by the dispensary 
method. The intensive type of work, like the 
dispensary, reduces infection through curative 
measures. In addition, by the installation of 
latrines, it seeks to prevent the further spread of 
disease through soil pollution. It is also leading 
up to the establishment of permanent local 
agencies which guarantee the necessary system
-P-A-G-E-88
  88 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 
of inspection. By its means it is reasonable to 
hope that new infections and re-infections will 
be reduced to a minimum, and that as a result 
hookworm disease in course of time will dis- 
appear. 
Comparison of the Two Methods 
The intensive type of work, which involves 
the installation, use, and maintenance of ade- 
quate latrines, while it produces more _per- 
manent results than the dispensary type, is 
nevertheless more difficult of operation than 
measures directed mainly to the treatment and 
cure of infected persons and the education of 
the people. It demands of the population it- 
self a positive contribution. In most cases it 
requires the purchase of building material and 
the expenditure of time and energy to build 
latrines. More than this, it necessitates the 
arousing of a sanitary sense and a change of 
personal habits that will lead the people to use 
and maintain the latrines once built, and calls 
for more intimate contact with the people, more 
persistent and protracted effort, and a more 
marked faculty of leadership by the director in 
charge. 
Increase in State Health Funds 
In 1910, the legislatures of the eleven states, 
Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Louis- 
iana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Caro- 
lina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia, appro-
-P-A-G-E-89
  SOUTHERN STATES 89 
priated $216,195 for health work. In 1915, 
the same eleven states appropriated $512,300, 
an increase of 136 per cent. The present state 
appropriations are much larger. The funds 
available in North Carolina for health work, 
for example, have grown from approximately 
$12,500 to more than $150,000. The state 
health funds for South Carolina have increased 
from $24,000 in 1910 to more than $75,000 at 
present.1 A similar increase is seen in other 
states. 
Increased Budgets for Intensive Work 
While the intensive work was in the experi- 
mental stage, it was financed by the Interna- 
tional Health Board. When its feasibility had 
been demonstrated, and as a result the working 
area had been enlarged, the state and county 
began to assume a portion of the expense. As 
soon as it had been demonstrated in a few 
countries that the enlarged program, when 
carried out on a codperative basis, was within 
the reach: of the people, local contributions 
toward its maintenance increased. Subsequent 
growth in the size of the working staff for each 
base unit has been almost entirely due to in- 
creased appropriations by state and county. 
In the work conducted in 1916,? for instance, 
the Board’s proportion of the total expense 
throughout the South was about 50 per cent. 
1 March, 1917. 
2 For statistical results see pages 94 to 99. 
 
-P-A-G-E-90
  90 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 
The remaining 50 per cent was shared by state 
and county. In the budgets which are being 
developed for 1917,! local agencies furnish from 
50 to 75 per cent. The tendency is toward a 
working arrangement by which the county pro- 
vides 50 per cent, the State Board of Health 25 
per cent, and the International Health Board 
25 per cent. / 
The state budgets which are being developed 
for 1917 show large increases in appropriations 
for intensive work on the county plan. North 
Carolina, as one phase of its health program, 
has developed a budget for the current year in 
excess of $75,000 for this purpose. Of the total 
amount the state pays 25 per cent, the counties 
50 per cent, and the International Health Board 
25 per cent. The South Carolina budget for 
1917 has developed an appropriation amounting 
to more than $25,000 on a similar codperative 
plan. Of the amount, the state pays $9,650, the 
counties $6,000, and the International Health 
Board $9,650. A somewhat larger budget is 
provided by Tennessee. The state pays $10,- 
000, the International Health Board $10,000, 
and the counties the remaining amount. Texas 
has appropriated $70,000 for intensive work 
during the biennial period beginning June 20, 
1917, with the provision that the money is to 
be used, in codperation with counties and other 
agencies, in an effort to eradicate soil pollution

diseases and malaria. The portion of the ap- 
propriation to be used for work in which the 
International Health Board codperates is ap- 
proximately $17,000 yearly, and the total budget 
for intensive work is in excess of $45,000. 
Toward this sum the counties contribute $12,- 
000. The remainder is shared equally by the 
state of Texas and the International Health 
Board.! 
Progress in State Work 
Since 1910 the State Health Officers of eleven 
Southern States have obtained for varying 
periods more or less codperation from the Inter- 
national Health Board and its predecessor, the 
Rockefeller Sanitary Commission. Generally, 
such assistance has taken the form of financial 
aid in the working programs against hookworm 
disease and other soil pollution diseases. In 
other cases it has been the temporary loan of a 
man to carry out a health demonstration, a 
state director, a field director, or an investigator 
to make a special study and recommend a work- 
ing plan for the solution of a definite problem. 
The temporary association of such men with the 
state officials has been uniformly congenial and 
the results mutually satisfactory. 
As has been said, the State Health Officers 
have obtained from state and county increased

priations were not increased to the points mentioned until the early 
months of 1917, shortly before this report reached the press.

appropriations. In enlarging their staff they are 
endeavoring to establish a high standard of 
eligibility, and to have tenure of office and 
promotion rest solely on efficiency. The tend- 
ency is to have new members take a course of 
practical field training the better to fit them for 
the work they are to do. Special training bases 
for men who are to engage in the intensive 
county work, for example, have been established 
in Wilson county, North Carolina, and in Jones 
county, Mississippi. 
The International Health Board is utilizing 
these training bases to give new members of its 
field staff a few months of practical experience 
as a preliminary to their training period in a 
foreign country. This practical training has 
proved invaluable to men who formerly were 
engaged in the practice of medicine, or who, 
on completing their medical education, have 
assumed the responsibilities of health officers. 
The Outlook 
The above developments point to a growing 
public interest in health work and to increased 
efficiency in its administration. As a field, 
preventive medicine is coming to be regarded 
as affording a useful career to efficient men. 
The tendency is toward more liberal compensa- 
tion, greater security in tenure of office, and 
increased authority. The degree to which these 
features are emphasized will determine the at-
-P-A-G-E-93
  SOUTHERN STATES 93 
tractiveness of the field for young physicians of 
the highest type, and this, in turn, will greatly 
influence the progress that will be made in the 
control of preventable diseases. 
Fortunately, the outlock is very promising 
for more money and men, greater efficiency and 
larger results, less sickness, fewer deaths, and 
increased economic and social development.

ANTIGUA 
In Antigua the measures for the relief and 
control of hookworm disease are conducted under 
the supervision of Dr. M. P. Duke, the Chief 
Government Medical Officer. The intensive 
plan is followed. The staff engaged in the cur- 
ative work consists of two microscopists, four 
nurses, two assistant nurses, one clerk, and one 
caretaker, acting under the direction of Dr. 
Don Morse Griswold.'! Since May 15, 1916, the 
Government of Antigua has employed a special 
sanitary inspector to advance the measures of 
sanitary reform. Headquarters are at St. Johns, 
the capital. 
The unit of operations is a group of villages. 
Excluding St. Johns, with its population of 
8,000, the people of the Island, about 85 per 
cent of whom are full-blooded negroes, live 
mainly in rural villages and engage in agricul- 
ture. Sugar is the principal crop. For the pur- 
poses of the work, the Island has been divided 
into six areas. On account of the sparsity of 
the population, these areas have been made as 
large as can be conveniently handled from a 
central point. From the inauguration of the 
work on September 15, 1915, up to December 
81, 1916, work had been completed in three of 
these areas, and was in progress on December 
10n March 8, 1916, Dr. Griswold succeeded Dr. P. W. Covington as 
Director. During the period from December 7, 1915, to March 8, 1916, 
Dr. Harold Leslie Kearney served as Acting Director. 
 
-P-A-G-E-101
  ANTIGUA 101 
31, 1916, ina fourth. All four of these districts 
lie in the southern half of the island, where the 
population is most dense. 
The first area in which operations were un- 
dertaken (York Valley) occupied the south- 
western portion of the colony. This, with the 
second area (Belvidere), just to the east, was 
bounded on three sides by high hills and moun- 
tains. Both districts included all the villages 
within a radius of three miles. The Belvidere 
area had a population of only 884, but the high 
hills surrounding it prevented the inclusion of 
any additional villages. The third area, known 
as the All Saints, adjoined the Belvidere dis- 
trict on the east, and had the largest population 
of any of the areas completed by the end of the 
year. 
Examination and Treatment 
The population of the three areas in which 
work had been completed up to December 31, 
1916, was 7,565. Of this total population, the 
staff examined 7,477, or 98.8 per cent, for hook- 
worm disease; and found 2,229, or 29.8 per cent, 
of those examined to be infected. First treat- 
ment was administered to 2,054, or 92.1 per cent, 
of those infected; and 1,973, or 96.1 per cent of 
those given first treatment, were cured. 
In Table 1 these figures are presented, along 
with a comparison of the results accomplished 
in the three areas completed during 1916.1 
1No areas were completed during 1915.

It will be seen from Table 2 that of the 2,229 
persons originally found infected, only 8.5 per 
cent remained as possible foci of infection when 
operations within the three districts had been 
completed. Almost all of those who were not 
cured during the progress of the work were per- 
sons from whom treatment had to be withheld 
for medical reasons: they represented 6.4 per 
cent of those infected. Persons who refused to 
be cured numbered only 1 per cent of the total 
infected. In the All Saints district, as the table 
shows, the percentage of persons remaining un- 
cured was smaller than in either of the other two 
districts. (See Table 2, page 104.) 
Table 3 presents in detail the results of the 
work of examination and treatment in the York 
Valley, Belvidere, and All Saints districts. In 
this table are included the supporting figures 
upon which Tables 2 and 3 are based. (See 
Table 3, page 105.) 
Educational Work 
In eacharea in which operations are conducted, 
public lectures, accompanied by projection- 
lantern slides, are given in the evening; and 
talks in the school-rooms, illustrated by a chart 
on hookworm disease, are given in the after- 
noon. The plan adopted is to give these lec- 
tures at various places in the districts until the 
total attendance at all of the lectures is approxi- 
mately the same as the population of the dis-

Gazette of the Antiguan Government is mailed 
monthly to each of the district medical officers, 
clergymen, planters, and other influential per- 
sons throughout the colony, as a means of keep- 
ing them informed concerning the work. 
Sanitary Improvement 
The native rural population of Antigua is 
almost entirely without latrine accommodations. 
Tn the three areas in which the work of examina- 
tion and treatment had been completed up to 
 
-P-A-G-E-107
  ANTIGUA 107 
December 31, 1916, for instance, the sanitary 
inspection showed that only 38 among a total 
of 1,830 homes were provided with latrines. 
The task of securing the installation of latrines 
at rural homes is therefore one of the most press- 
ing problems of the local Government. 
The special sanitary inspector appointed by 
His Excellency the Acting Governor, has been 
actively engaged in this work since May 15, 
1916. Up to the end of the year, 32 additional 
homes had been provided with latrines,—15 in 
the York Valley and 17 in the Belvidere dis- 
trict. In the All Saints district, efforts at sani- 
tary reform were also in progress, but no definite 
figures have been reported. In all of these areas 
the sanitary work will be continued until a far 
larger proportion of the homes has been pro- 
vided with latrines,
-P-A-G-E-108

BRITISH GUIANA 
The work conducted by the Government of 
British Guiana for the relief and control of hook- 
worm disease continued during 1916 under the 
direction of the Surgeon General, Dr. K. S. 
Wise. On July 1, 1916, Dr. F. W. Dershimer 
succeeded Dr. F. E. Field as Supervising Medi- 
cal Officer. The intensive plan was followed. 
Measures of sanitary reform remained in the 
hands of a staff of native inspectors maintained 
by the Government. 
The bulk of the population of the colony lives 
in a narrow strip of land along the northern 
coast. With the exception of a few habitations 
extending inland for a short distance along the 
larger rivers, this represents practically the only 
inhabited area. The land is low-lying, flat, 
and swampy, and is used almost entirely for 
cane cultivation and rice-growing. 
Of the total population of the colony, num- 
bering approximately 296,000 persons, about 
one-fourth live on the sugar estates. The re- 
mainder are grouped in towns and villages, there 
being few isolated houses. Approximately 42 
per cent of the inhabitants are East Indians and 
39 per cent negroes. A large variety of races and 
religions are included in the other 19 per cent. 
From the beginning of the work on March 12, 
1914, up to December 31, 1916, operations had 
been completed in three areas: Peter’s Hall,
-P-A-G-E-109
  BRITISH GUIANA 109 
Belle Vue, and Plaisance. The first extends for 
a distance of eight miles along the east bank, 
and the second for a distance of fourteen miles 
along the west bank, of the Demerara river. 
The results accomplished in these areas were 
included in the annual report for 1915. 
In the Plaisance area, the only area completed 
during 1916, the work had been begun on Octo- 
ber 1, 1915. It was completed on September 
80, 1916. Operations were then begun in an- 
other area, but since the work in this fourth 
area had not been completed by December 31, 
1916, the results accomplished in it are omitted 
from this report. 
Headquarters for the Plaisance area were es- 
tablished in the village of that name, located 
near the center of the area, with field offices in 
each of the four districts into which the area was 
divided. Each field office had its staff of nurses 
and distributors, and a caretaker. Early in the 
work the total force employed in the field, exclu- 
sive of the home office, numbered sixty-two 
men. This was found too large for effective 
supervision, and was gradually reduced until, 
towards the close of the campaign, only ten 
nurses, twelve distributors, and four caretakers, 
or twenty-six persons in all, remained. 
The area, with a population of 18,951, ex- 
tends eastward along the northern coast for a 
distance of twelve miles from Georgetown, the 
capital. Its width varies from one to three 
 
-P-A-G-E-110
    
110 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 
miles. The land is flat, and at high tide lies 
several feet below sea-level. Dikes have been 
built to keep out the sea. Drainage is carried 
out by an elaborate system of canals, from which 
the water escapes at low tide through gates in 
the sea wall. Certain of the canals are used for 
drainage and sewerage; others furnish water 
for drinking and culinary purposes. During the 
rainy season, the drainage is sometimes inade- 
quate and large areas are flooded. Storms often 
batter down the sea walls, and until the break is 
repaired large areas are flooded with salt water 
at each succeeding high tide. 
The rice-growing industry, spreading rapidly 
in this area, has resulted in the formation of 
numerous ponds of shallow water. In these, 
as well as in the trenches which have become 
choked with vegetation, mosquitoes breed in 
large numbers. Throughout the area malaria is 
prevalent to a marked degree. 
Huts of from one to three rooms, built either 
of mud, thatched with palm leaves or straw, or of 
wood, house the majority of the people. Many 
of these huts have dirt floors. During the rainy 
season the yards are often covered with water 
and the houses built on the ground are flooded. 
Examination and Treatment 
The total population of the three areas in 
which work had been completed up to December 
31, 1916, was 41,274,—approximately one-
-P-A-G-E-111
ee ae 
BRITISH GUIANA lll 
seventh of the total population of the colony. 
Of these 41,274 persons, 39,568, or 95.9 per cent, 
were examined for hookworm disease; and 22,- 
943, or 58.0 per cent of those examined, were 
found infected. First treatment was admin- 
istered to 20,166 persons, representing 87.9 per 
cent of those infected; and 16,264, or 80.7 per cent 
of those receiving first treatment, were cured. 
In Table 1 figures are presented separately 
for the results accomplished in the areas com- 
pleted during 1915 and 1916. The statistics for 
1915 include the combined results in the Peter’s 
Hall and Belle Vue districts, both of which were 
Sompleted in that year; those for 1916 are for 
the Plaisance area only.

  lig INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 
It will be seen that for the Plaisance area the 
percentage of persons infected and the percent- 
age of persons cured was lower than the average 
for the two areas previously completed. The 
decrease in the percentage of persons cured may 
be explained by the fact that the East Indians 
engaged in the rice-growing industry spend, dur- 
ing the planting and harvesting seasons, seven 
long days each week in the fields, and as a rule 
will not give even one day for treatment. Two 
crops are raised each year, so that there are four 
or five months during which a large part of the 
population can hardly be reached. Therice fields, 
furthermore, are kept submerged until just before 
the harvest, and many of the people believe that if 
they go into the water within a day or two after 
taking salts they will catch cold, and so lose not 
one but two or three days from their labor. 
Table 2 exhibits the thoroughness of the work 
in reducing the number of persons remaining as 
foci of infection. As will be noted, 2,122 of 
the 9,808 persons originally found infected, or 
21.6 per cent, remained in the area uncured at 
the close of the work. The largest single group 
(902) of these uncured persons included those 
who had taken one or more treatments but 
had not been found cured on re-examination. 
These persons, representing 9.2 per cent of those 
infected, are classed as under treatment. The 
persons who could not be treated for medical 
reasons or who refused treatment, formed, re- 
 
-P-A-G-E-113

Educational Work 
The same educational features were employed 
in the Plaisance as in the Peter’s Hall and Belle 
Vue areas. There was an inaugural meeting at- 
tended by prominent officials and citizens, and 
other public meetings were held from time to 
time throughout the area. During the progress 
of the work twenty-six lectures were delivered 
to a total attendance estimated at 5,947. Ten 
of these lectures were to the public and sixteen 
to school children.

The figures in this table do not include all of 
the sanitary work undertaken nor all of the re-

installation of latrines at homes where none 
have previously existed, the inspectors endeavor 
to have old latrines improved and made sani- 
tary, main and interlot drains cleaned out, un- 
necessary vegetation removed, and other meas- 
ures of sanitation introduced; and this work 
often continues in an area for months after the 
population has been examined and treated. In 
the Peter’s Hall and Belle Vue districts, for in- 
   
-P-A-G-E-117
BRITISH GUIANA 117 
stance, which are represented in the table by 
the figures for 1915, it is shown that only 63.7 
of the homes were provided with latrines when 
the curative work ended. A recent report states 
that as a result of the active campaign waged 
by the Government sanitary inspectors, prac- 
tically every home in these districts has been 
provided with an approved latrine, and a tour 
of inspection made by the Surgeon General and 
the Supervising Medical Officer showed that 
every latrine was being used. In addition, 
houses have been razed in overcrowded districts, 
and measures against mosquitoes, such as the 
removal of underbrush from the vicinity of 
houses and the improvement of drainage, have 
been employed. 
In the Plaisance area, the table shows that 
there were only 55 additional homes provided 
with latrines during the progress of the work of 
examination and treatment. In this area it had 
been planned to have the sanitary work com- 
pleted before the curative work was begun, but 
a lack of funds prevented this, and a start was 
not made until the curative work was well under 
way. Unfortunately, however, the villagers ob- 
jected to the enforcement of sanitary laws and 
refused to take further treatment unless the 
inspectors were withdrawn. This was done, 
with the result that conditions in the area re- 
mained practically unimproved while the people 
were being examined and treated.
-P-A-G-E-118

Although the failure to effect the needed sani- 
tary improvement in this area during the prog- 
ress of the work was a disappointment, the 
delay was merely temporary, steps are now being 
taken to enforce the sanitary regulations, and 
the Surgeon General promises that most of the 
necessary latrines will be erected within a few 
months. The Government authorities are now 
carrying out advance measures for the sanitary 
improvement of areas into which the curative 
work is shortly to be introduced. 
The interest which the Government, the Dis- 
trict Medical Officers, and the estate owners are 
manifesting in efforts to banish the disease from 
the colony is reflected in the fact that in the 
three public hospitals, and in most if not all of 
the estate hospitals, every patient admitted is 
examined for hookworm disease without regard 
to the complaint for which he enters. If found 
infected, effort is made to cure him before he is 
discharged. On many of these estates, further- 
more, the indentured laborers are being system- 
atically examined and treated under the super- 
vision of the District Medical Officers. 
As a means of reducing the amount of sickness 
in certain localities, the value of well-directed 
efforts at sanitary improvement, taken in con- 
junction with the treatment and cure of sufferers 
from hookworm disease, is suggested by the fig- 
ures in Table 7. This table shows the num- 
ber of persons admitted to the public hospital at
-P-A-G-E-119
    BRITISH GUIANA 119 
Georgetown during the years 1914, 1915, and 
1916. From the Peter’s Hall and Belle Vue dis- 
tricts, in which operations against hookworm 
disease were in progress, respectively, from 
March 12, 1914, to March 31, 1915, and from 
January 9, 1915, to September 30, 1915, it will 
be seen that the number of patients admitted 
during 1916 was 31.5 per cent lower than the 
number admitted during 1914. In contrast with 
this, the table shows that from the districts in

The work for the relief and control of hook- 
worm disease in Dutch Guiana follows the in- 
tensive plan and provides for two separate staffs, 
one concerned with remedial and the other with 
preventive measures. The first staff is main- 
tained by the Board, the second by the Govern- 
ment. Both are under the supervision of the 
Surgeon General, Honorable A. L. Schenck. 
During 1916, the remedial measures have re- 
mained under the direction of Dr. W. H. Kibler, 
who serves as State Director. From October 
15, 1915, the date on which the work in Dutch 
Guiana was inaugurated, until March 15, 1916, 
his staff consisted of eight persons, including 
two microscopists, four nurses, one clerk, and 
one caretaker. From March 15 to December 
31, 1916, from nineteen to twenty-one persons 
were employed, consisting of three microscopists 
and twelve nurses, and, at different times, 
three or four clerks and one or two caretakers. 
The entire population of Dutch Guiana lives 
in a strip of coastal plain, or mud flat, lying 
along the northern coast and extending inland a 
distance of about fifty miles. Paramaribo, the 
capital, with a population of 40,000, and about 
155 estates and settlements having a population 
of more than 50 persons each, are included within 
this plain. The total population of the 155 
estates and settlements, excluding Paramaribo, 
 
-P-A-G-E-122
  122 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 
is 88,055. For the purpose of the work, each 
estate or settlement forms a separate unit. On 
twelve of these estates and in one of these settle- 
ments, all lying along the Commewyne river in 
what is known as the Lower Commewyne area, 
operations were brought to a close during the year 
1916. The total population of these estates and 
this settlement was 4,470 persons, composed main- 
ly of East Indians and Javanese in about equal 
numbers, with approximately 500 creoles. Full- 
blooded whites and negroes were not numerous. 
Examination and Treatment 
Of the total of 4,470 persons inhabiting the 
area in which operations were completed during 
1916, the staff succeeded in examining 4,411, or 
98.7 per cent, for hookworm disease. The num- 
ber found infected was 3,900, or 88.4 per cent of 
those examined. First treatment was admin- 
istered to 3,667 persons, representing 94.0 per 
cent of those found infected; and 3,233, or 88.2 
per cent of those receiving first treatment, were 
cured. Table 1 presents these figures in tabular 
form. (See Table 1, page 123.) 
Treatment is administered under hospital con- 
ditions. For this purpose, accommodations in 
the hospital located on each estate are provided 
by the estate owners. 
Table 2 illustrates the effectiveness of the work 
in reducing the number of infected persons in the 
area, It will be seen that of the 3,900 persons

cent, remained in the area uncured at the close 
of the work. More than half of these were per- 
sons who could not be cured for medical reasons. 
Those who refused to be treated numbered less 
than 1 per cent of the total infected.

In an attempt to acquaint the people of Dutch 
Guiana with the symptoms, harmful effects, 
prevalence, method of distribution, and means 
 
-P-A-G-E-125
DUTCH GUIANA 125 
of prevention of hookworm disease, several 
measures are pursued. A public lecture illus- 
trated by lantern slides is given before work is 
begun on an estate; pamphlets printed in Dutch, 
Negro-English, Hindustani, and Javanese are 
distributed; and the nurses, in their daily con- 
tact with the people, use every opportunity to 
explain in simple terms the facts about the 
disease. On beginning the work on each estate 
there is a public demonstration of worms that 
have been recovered from persons treated on 
other estates. At this demonstration, charts 
and pictures are exhibited, and the microscope 
is used to show young hookworms recently 
hatched from the eggs. The practice, too, of 
counting in the presence of each patient the 
number of worms recovered from his stool, en- 
lists much interest and lends strong support to 
the work of examination and treatment. 
In the educational work in Dutch Guiana up 
to December 31, 1916, eleven public lectures had 
been delivered to a total attendance estimated 
at 5,000 persons, and approximately 2,000 
printed pamphlets had been distributed. 
Sanitary Improvement 
On the first of January, 1916, a code of general 
sanitary regulations went into effect. In these 
regulations the entire extent of all plantations 
is considered public land, and soil pollution 
thereon is penalized. The district medical offi- 
 
-P-A-G-E-126
126 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 
cers and the police, among others, are charged 
with their enforcement. Additional regulations, 
designed especially to aid] the measures against 
hookworm disease, were presented to the Colo- 
nial Assembly on March 20, 1916, by His Excel- 
lency the Governor. These regulations require 
the construction, maintenance, and use of 
latrines in numbers sufficient to accommodate 
the entire population of all areas wherein opera- 
tions are conducted. 
The barracks, or ranges, built for the estate 
laborers in Dutch Guiana contain from five to 
twenty rooms, each room being occupied by a 
family of two or more persons. In the reports 
these separate rooms are classed as homes. One 
latrine may provide accommodations for the 
occupants of one or more ranges, and thus serve 
a large number of homes. The territory in 
which the curative work had been completed 
up to December 31, 1916, included 1,824 homes. 
Table 4 shows that when the work began, only 
325, or 17.8 per cent, had latrine accommoda- 
tion. During the progress of the work, accom- 
modation was provided for 1,290 additional 
homes, increasing the number with latrine ac- 
commodation to 1,615, or 88.5 per cent of the 
total. The actual number of new latrines in- 
stalled, by which accommodation was provided 
for the 1,290 additional homes, was 226. (See 
Table 4, page 127.)

  The figures in this table, however, do not 
signify the real extent of sanitary reform ac- 
complished. In addition to the new latrines 
installed, a number of old latrines were improved 
and made sanitary; the maintenance and use of 
all latrines was required; drainage for the la- 
borers’ quarters was secured; filth, rubbish, 
and unnecessary vegetation were removed. On 
every hand the laborers gave evidence of gen- 
uine codperation. One manager, representing 
a group of estates, writes: “At first I had some 
doubt that the laborers would use the latrines 
which I was advised to build, but I find they like 
them and use them regularly. I think this will 
continue so long as the latrines are inspected 
and kept clean.” { 
From all of the estates the reports received 
indicate that the laborers show marked improve- 
ment in general health and in working capacity 
following their treatment and cure for hook-

worm disease. On one estate, among five men 
taken at random, their average wage per work- 
ing day was 34 per cent higher for the three 
months following treatment than it had been for 
the three months preceding; and on another, 
among six men chosen at random, their average 
daily wage for a period of two months after 
treatment exceeded by 38 per cent that for a 
period of three months before treatment.

GRENADA 
In Grenada the work for the relief and control 
of hookworm disease is conducted under the 
direction of the Colonial Surgeon, with the as- 
sistance of a local Advisory Committee of which 
the Colonial Secretary is Chairman. On Aug- 
ust 26, 1916, Dr. H. S. Colwell succeeded Dr. 
Angus MacDonald as Medical Officer in Charge 
of the curative work. The staff engaged in this 
work consists of one clerk, three microscopists, 
six nurses and assistant nurses, and two care- 
takers. In addition, a staff of inspectors is 
employed by the Government to secure the 
needed sanitary reform. 
From the beginning of the work in Grenada on 
December 1, 1914, up to December 31, 1916, 
operations had been completed in a part of the 
parish of St. George known as the Mt. Moritz 
area, in the whole of the parish of St. David, in 
approximately one half of the parish of St. 
Andrew, and in a small area (Dougaldston) em- 
bracing two square miles in the parish of St. John. 
In addition, a central office was maintained in 
the town of St. George’s, where persons who 
applied from any section of the Island were 
examined and treated. In all of the areas ex- 
cept Dougaldston, the work was conducted by 
the dispensary plan. On December 31, 1916, 
activities by the intensive plan were also in 
progress in four restricted areas in St. John’s

parish: Concord, Marigot, Grand Roy, and 
Mt. Nesbit, which, taken in connection with the 
Dougaldston area completed before the end of 
the year, include the whole of St. John’s parish 
south of the Dougaldston river. 
In the Concord and Dougaldston areas, the 
work was inaugurated on February 1 and 
February 15, 1916, respectively; in Marigot and 
Grand Roy on September 9; and in Mt. Nesbit 
on November 28. From the first of September 
until the close of the year, the entire attention 
of the staff was devoted to the intensive work in 
these five areas. For this purpose, headquarters 
were established in the town of Grand Roy. The 
other eight months of the year were spent in 
bringing to a close the operations by the dis- 
pensary plan which had been begun during 1915 
in the Mt. Moritz, St. David’s, and St. Andrew’s 
areas. 
The Dougaldston area, the only area com- 
pleted by the intensive plan during 1916, con- 
sists of one large cocoa estate, situated about 
one half mile from the town of Gouyave and 
about twelve miles from St. George’s, the capital. 
The land rises rapidly from the sea-level to the 
high hills near the central ridge of the Island. 
_The people, numbering about 426, are mostly 
negroes, with a few East Indians. About 150 
are housed in barracks and another 150 live along 
the main road near the seacoast. The remainder 
have small houses scattered about the estate,

Examination and Treatment 
In all of the areas in which work had been 
completed by either the dispensary or intensive 
method up to December 31, 1916, a total of 23,- 
896 persons was examined. Of these, 15,420, 
or 64.5 per cent, were found infected. Due to 
the plan followed up to September 1, 1916, of 
administering treatment in certain cases on 
clinical diagnosis, first treatment was given to 
15,669 persons,—249 in excess of the number 
found infected. Of those who received first 
treatment, 4,384, or 28.0 per cent, were cured. 
Table 1 presents these figures, and offers a 
comparison of the results accomplished during 
1916 and prior to 1916.

In the areas in which intensive work was con-

two out-door lectures were held, in addition to 
the customary meetings in schools and churches. 
Occasionally, the microscopists have gone into 
outlying districts and given microscopic demon-

strations to the people in their homes; and in 
some cases the nurses have strained the stools 
of the patients after treatment to exhibit the 
worms that have been expelled. In addition, 
the medical officer and the nurses in their daily 
contact with the people have done much to 
spread a knowledge of the disease. 
Table 3 presents a summary of the educational 
work conducted by means of lectures in the areas 
in which operations by the intensive plan were 
in progress during the last four months of 1916.

  there are 671 homes. Only 75 were found to be 
provided with latrines on the first inspection, 
and 59 of these were in the Mt. Nesbit area, 
which embraces two large cocoa estates and the 
village of Mt. Granby. In this area there are 
319 inhabitants and 87 homes. The owners of 
the estates have provided latrines for the use 
of their laborers, who keep the latrines in fairly 
good condition. Some of the people in the vil- 
lage of Mt. Granby also have creditable latrines. 
Throughout the other areas the homes pro- 
vided with adequate sanitary accommodations 
number less than ten. A spot about 75 feet 
from the house, often on the slope ofa hill directly 
above it, is most frequently chosen for the dis- 
posal of excrement. No attempt is made to 
bury the feces. Persons living near the seashore 
carry their utensils daily to the beach, where 
they exercise a varying degree of caution against 
emptying the contents upon the dry sand above 
high-water mark. 
Very few of the people have shown any dis- 
 
-P-A-G-E-135
  GRENADA 135 
position to provide themselves voluntarily with 
latrines. There is, however, a law for compelling 
the installation of latrines at all homes, except 
where such installation might contaminate the 
water supply. The Advisory Committee has 
urged that this law be more rigidly enforced by 
the local authorities. The Government has also 
been requested to appropriate 300 pounds for 
sanitary improvement. A part of this sum 
would be used to provide dumping stations for 
the convenience of persons living in thickly 
populated districts in proximity to streams or 
other sources of drinking water. 
At Belmont, Concord, and Grand Roy, capa- 
cious and well-constructed latrines, with concrete 
sides to the pit, have been constructed at the 
Government schools by order of His Excellency 
the Governor, and similar structures are in course 
of erection at the Government schools in other 
centers. The installation of these latrines at the 
schools will doubtless have much influence in 
educating the people to build and use latrines at 
their homes.

ST. LUCIA 
Measures for the relief and control of hook- 
worm disease in St. Lucia continued during 1916 
under the supervision of Dr. Stanley Branch. 
On June 19, 1916, the functions of the Advisory 
Committee, which had been appointed by the 
Island Government to direct the work, were 
vested in the Board of Health of the Colony. 
At that time, two influential landed proprietors 
were added to the Board. The Administrator 
is Chairman. 
Beginning January 1, 1916, a strictly inten- 
sive plan of work was followed. In preparing 
specimens for microscopic examination the cen- 
trifuge was used, and in administering treat- 
ment the nurses were required to see that the 
patients swallowed each dose. Throughout the 
year, two microscopists, four nurses, and a clerk 
were engaged in the work of examination and 
treatment, with a special field inspector, em- 
ployed by the Government, devoting his ener- 
gies to measures for the improvement of sani- 
tation. 
Activities during the year were confined to 
the Castries Valley area, immediately surround- 
ing Castries, the seaport and seat of Govern- 
ment of the Island. Work had been completed 
in one third of this area during the last six 
months of 1915; it was completed in the remain- 
ing two thirds during 1916. The area as a
-P-A-G-E-137
  ST. LUCIA 137 
whole embraced a population of 10,482 persons, 
of whom 5,936, or 56.6 per cent, were residents 
of the town of Castries. The remainder of the 
inhabitants lived in districts suburban rather 
than rural. More than 98 per cent were colored. 
Examination and Treatment 
Excluding the preliminary infection survey 
conducted during the closing months of 1914, 
the staff had enumerated in the work extend- 
ing from January 1, 1915, to December 31, 
1916, a census of 14,363 persons. Of this 
total population, 13,927, or 97.0 per cent, were 
examined for hookworm disease, and 6,772, or 
48.6 per cent, were found to be infected. First 
treatment was administered to 6,307 persons,— 
93.1 per cent of those found infected; and 4,081 
—64.7 per cent of those who received first treat- 
ment—were cured. Table 1 presents a summary 
of the results of examination and treatment up 
to December 31, 1916, showing separately the 
results accomplished in the areas completed 
during 1915 and during 1916. In the areas com- 
pleted during 1916, there was a decrease in the 
volume of results, but in every detail the work 
during this period was more careful and more 
thorough, and its results may be expected to be 
more permanent. (See Table 1, page 138.) 
The portion of the Castries Valley in which 
work was conducted during 1916 was divided 
for convenience into two sections, separated by

of six months to the work in each section. In 
Table 2 the results accomplished during each 
half-yearly period are compared. (See Table 2, 
page 139.) 
The section in which work was conducted 
during the first half year included a larger pro- 
portion of town residents than the second; con- 
sequently, the percentage of persons found 
infected was lower, being 32.4 in the first half 
as compared with 47.0 in the second. The 
suburban districts have been found to show a 
steady increase in infection as the work has 
proceeded farther from the town.

cent, remained in the area uncured at the close 
of work. More than half of these were persons 
under treatment. The failure to treat all of the 
infected persons until they had been cured was 
due almost wholly to the migratory habits, pro- 
crastination, and shiftlessness of certain mem- 
bers of the negro laboring population. (See

Educational Work 
The nurses in visiting the patients, and the 
Medical Officer in conversing with persons at 
the central office, have used every opportunity 
 
-P-A-G-E-142
142 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 
to acquaint the people with the measures neces- 
sary for curing and preventing hookworm dis- 
ease. Lectures to the public, particularly to 
school-children, have been held at frequent in- 
tervals during the year, and an address has been 
delivered to the students of Saint Mary’s Col- 
lege, the only school of higher education in the 
colony. 
The managers of primary schools have evinced 
a determined effort to assist the work, and 
among the teachers the codperation, on the 
whole, has been all that could be desired. Ina 
few cases, however, it has seemed that the 
teachers have failed to appreciate the benefits 
which would result if both themselves and their 
pupils were freed of the infection. The Adminis- 
trator has therefore instructed the Inspector of 
Schools to impress upon them the fact that they 
and their scholars should be treated and freed of 
the disease, and that latrines should be used to 
prevent re-infection. 
Sanitary Improvement 
Sanitary regulations framed by the Board of 
Health require that all premises (including 
schools and business places) shall be provided 
with satisfactory accommodations for disposing 
of human feces. Medical officers, the Inspector 
of Nuisances, and the special sanitary inspector 
appointed by the Government are clothed with 
power to see that the regulations are enforced. 
 
-P-A-G-E-143
  ST. LUCIA 143 
At a meeting on March 16, 1916, a joint com- 
mittee of representatives of the General Board 
of Health and of the Castries Town Board 
unanimously agreed as to the most satisfactory 
and economical method of disposing of sewage in 
Castries and its vicinity. This body recom- 
mended that the inhabitants of the town of 
Castries be permitted to continue dumping their 
refuse into the sewage barge which anchors 
nightly in the river; that an additional barge be 
provided for the section of the town most remote 
from the anchorage of the present barge; and 
that, for the low-lying localities just outside the 
town boundaries, central dumping depots of the 
pit type, with proper precautions against the 
contamination of underground waters by seep- 
age, be established. The territory served by 
each of these depots will not extend beyond a 
radius of one half mile. The first of the depots 
was opened in October, and arrangements are 
being made to open others in the localities sug- 
gested by the committee. Provision for the 
additional barge was also included in the finan- 
cial estimates for 1917-1918. 
In the portions of the area which will not be 
served either by the sewage barges or by the 
dumping depots, effort will be made to have 
latrines installed. In these outlying districts 
there are 411 houses. On December 31, 1916, 
the conditions of disposal at 226, or 55.0 per 
cent, were satisfactory. The erection of an out-
-P-A-G-E-144
    144 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 
building for permanent or temporary disposal of 
sewage will be required at every house located 
outside the town, while in the town effort will be 
made to discourage the practice of keeping in 
living rooms, or in other places accessible to 
flies and poultry, the utensils in which the feces 
are carried to the depot or barge for disposal. 
Properly constructed fly-proof boxes, for use in 
storing the feces in the outbuilding, are furnished 
free of charge on orders issued by the field in- 
spector. 
Sanitary supervision will be exercised over the 
areas in which the work of examination and 
treatment has ended, but unless the Govern- 
ment sanitary staff is considerably enlarged 
there may be some degree of reversion to insani- 
tary practices, especially in the rural districts. 
To prevent this, and to see that effective super- 
vision is maintained, the number of sanitary 
inspectors will be increased as soon as possible.

ST. VINCENT 
Active measures for the relief and control of 
hookworm disease have been conducted in St. 
Vincent during the past year by two separate 
staffs, codrdinated under the general super- 
vision of Dr. C. H. Durrant, the Colonial Surgeon. 
One staff devotes its energies to the work of ex- 
amination and treatment; the other endeavors 
to secure sanitary improvement. The staff em- 
ployed in curative measures includes, besides the 
Medical Officer in Charge, two microscopists 
and sixnurses. On November 13, 1915, Dr. P. B. 
Gardner succeeded Dr. W. P. Jacocks as Medi- 
eal Officer in Charge of the curative work. 
The only inhabited part of St. Vincent is the 
narrow strip of land lying between the central 
mountain range, which extends the entire 
length of the island, and the seacoast on both 
sides. It is planned to complete work on the 
windward, or eastern, side before beginning on 
the leeward. Despite the rugged character 
of the country, the scarcity of good roads, the 
widely scattered population, and the long rainy 
season, it has been found feasible to conduct 
operations by the intensive plan. Small areas 
are selected, and the work is confined to them 
until as many as possible of the infected in- 
habitants have been treated and cured. 
The area in which the work of examination 
and treatment had been completed up to De-
-P-A-G-E-146
146 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 
cember 31, 1916, embraced the territory on the 
windward side, extending for a distance of 
eleven miles from Kingstown, the seat of gov- 
ernment. Within this small territory is in- 
cluded the most populous part of the island. It 
was subdivided, for convenience in conducting 
operations, into five smaller areas: Calliaqua, 
Belair, Sion’ Hill, Stubbs, and Mesopotamia. 
Activities in the two first-named areas were 
completed during 1915 and were described in 
the second annual report. During 1916 work 
was completed in the Sion Hill, Stubbs, and 
Mesopotamia areas. 
The Sion Hill area, the first to be completed 
during 1916, included all the territory between 
the town of Kingstown and the Calliaqua and 
Belair areas. Headquarters were established 
on Sion Hill, near Kingstown. One estate and 
two villages just outside of Kingstown were in- 
cluded in the area, but no portion of the town 
itself. In the census taken by the field staff, 
1,880 persons, living in 366 homes, were enu- 
merated. About one half were white; the others, 
black or colored. 
The Stubbs area had as its center the large 
village of that name, located on the seacoast 
about eight miles from Kingstown. The area, 
triangular in shape, had a base five miles long 
on the seacoast and extended inland for a dis- 
tance of two and one-half miles. There were 
four villages and four estates within its limits.
-P-A-G-E-147
ST. VINCENT 147 
Headquarters were at Stubbs. The population 
numbered 2,362; the homes, 457. Of the pop- 
ulation, about 95 per cent were black or col- 
ored, 3 per cent white, and 2 per cent Indians. 
The Mesopotamia area was entirely inland. 
It was composed of a large, crater-like valley, 
circular in shape, surrounded on all sides by 
mountains. The field office was located in its 
center, a distance of nine miles from Kingstown. 
The majority of the inhabitants lived in six 
small villages, but there were many scattered 
homes on the sides of the surrounding moun- 
tains. In one instance, two families lived three 
miles from the nearest neighbor and five miles 
from the field office. The entire population of 
this area was agricultural. There were three 
small estates, but, as in the Sion Hill and Stubbs 
areas, the majority of the inhabitants owned 
and tilled their own small plots of land. The 
census enumerated 696 homes and 3,325 per- 
sons. Approximately 97 per cent of the inhab- 
itants were black or colored, 1 per cent East 
Indian, and 2 per cent white. 
Examination and Treatment 
In the five areas in which the work had been 
completed up to December 31, 1916, there was 
a total population of 11,392. Only 76 of these 
persons, representing slightly more than one half 
of 1 per cent of the total population, were not 
examined for hookworm disease,—the majority 
   
-P-A-G-E-148
  148 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 
because of refusal. Of the 11,316 persons ex- 
amined, 5,738, or 50.7 per cent, were found to be 
infected; and 5,338, or 93.0 per cent of those in- 
fected, received first treatment. Microscopic re- 
examination showed that 4,664, or 87.4 per cent of 
those receiving first treatment, had been cured. 
Table 1, in which these figures are exhibited, 
presents separately the results accomplished in 
the areas completed during 1915 and 1916.

The Sion Hill area presented the highest 
percentage of infection during the year, but the 
infection throughout this area was not uniform. 
In Sion Hill village, located near Kingstown, 
where many of the inhabitants use the public 
latrine over the sea, only about 30 of every 100 
persons were infected, as compared with 85 in 
portions of the district further inland, where 
there are practically no sanitary conveniences. 
In Table 3, which shows the number of persons 
remaining uncured in the three areas completed 
during 1916, the effectiveness of the work on the 
curative side is best exhibited. It will be seen 
that in the three areas combined, there remained 
uncured at the close of work only 17.0 per cent 
of the persons originally found infected. Ap- 
proximately one fourth of these refused to ac- 
cept treatment, another one fourth could not be 
treated for medical reasons, and one half re- 
ceived one or more treatments but had not been 
cured when the work was brought to a close. 
(See Table 3, page 151.) 
Table 4 presents figures showing in detail and 
by areas the results accomplished in the work of 
examination and treatment during 1916. In 
the Sion Hill area, the majority of the persons 
who refused to codperate were residents of Sion 
Hill village; in the Mesopotamia area those who 
refused to codperate lived in two small villages. 
Elsewhere in these areas the residents codperated 
willingly. (See Table 4, page 152.)

    Educational Work 
The purpose and scope of the work are ex- 
plained to the people in handbills and posters 
distributed throughout each area before the work 
of examination and treatment begins. Pre- 
liminary public lectures also are given in areas 
having buildings suitable for public assembly. 
These lectures are illustrated by lantern slides 
describing the disease. In all of the schools 
 
-P-A-G-E-153
  ST. VINCENT 153 
located in the areas wherein work has been con- 
ducted, lectures accompanied by microscopic 
demonstrations of the ova and embryos have 
been a feature. Persons who visit the staff 
headquarters in each area are shown charts and 
given general information concerning the disease, 
and opportunity is afforded them to look at the 
eggs and larvae with the microscope. 
Table 5 indicates that in the work up to De- 
cember 31, 1916, a total of 19 lectures had been 
delivered to an attendance estimated at 4,162 
persons. Eight of the lectures were to the pub- 
lic and eleven to school children.

  During the year the nurses found that demon- 
strations with the microscope in the homes of 
persons who had been unwilling to codperate in 
the work were effective in overcoming indiffer- 
ence or opposition. Visits of this kind to the 
homes of these obdurate persons have therefore 
become an important factor in the educational 
work, 
Sanitary Improvement 
The work of the staff employed by the Govern- 
ment in the construction of latrines is still far 
behind that of the staff engaged in examination 
and treatment. The aim is to have the sanitary 
and curative work proceed simultaneously in 
each area, but the greater part of-the sanitary 
work is not done until after the work of exami- 
nation and treatment has ended and until the 
majority of the persons who have been cured 
have had opportunity to be re-infected. No
-P-A-G-E-155
  ST. VINCENT 155 
compulsion is used in securing sanitary improve- 
ment. The Government makes and sells for 
eighteen cents a fly-proof box to be placed over 
a pit, and the sanitary staff installs the box for 
every person who will purchase one and dig 
a pit. 
Table 7 presents a comparison of the number 
and percentage of homes with latrines when the 
work of examination and treatment was begun, 
with the number and percentage when the work 
ended. In the five areas in which the curative 
work had been completed up to December 31, 
1916, there were 2,255 homes. On the first 
inspection, made when the work began, latrines 
were found at 395 homes, or 17.5 per cent of the 
total, as compared with 905, or 40.1 per cent,

  on the last inspection, made at the close of the 
work. The number of homes at which latrines 
were erected during the progress of the work was 
therefore 510, representing 22.6 per cent of the 
total. (See Table 7, page 155.) 
The figures presented in Table 8 compare the 
conditions on first and last inspections in the 
three areas completed during 1916. (See Table 
8, page 156.) 
This table indicates that during 1916, only 
147 new latrines were erected at homes located 
within the areas of operation while the work of 
examination and treatment was in progress. 
However, this does not measure the full extent 
of sanitary reform accomplished. After the 
curative work had ended, efforts at sanitary 
improvement continued in each of the areas, 
and 246 additional new latrines were erected    
-P-A-G-E-158

             158 
and 35 old latrines improved. These figures 
are exhibited in Table9. (See Table 9, page 157.) 
As this table indicates, on December 31, 1916, 
there remained, among the total homes in the 
Belair, Sion Hill, Stubbs, and Mesopotamia 
areas, 992 homes, or 57.1 per cent, to be pro- 
vided with latrines. The sanitary work will 
undoubtedly proceed until latrines have been 
erected at practically all of these homes.

Measures against hookworm disease in Trin- 
idad are conducted as a department of the Gov- 
ernment Medical Service, under the supervision 
of the Surgeon General. During 1916, the work 
has been conducted entirely by the intensive 
plan. From January 1, 1916, to May 19, 
1916, Dr. B. E. Washburn continued active 
direction of the curative work, under the desig- 
nation of Medical Officer in Charge. From 
May 19 to the close of the year, Dr. Washburn 
was on leave of absence, and the work was in the 
hands of Dr. George C. Payne, who served 
as Acting Medical Officer in Charge. The 
staff consists of six clerks, four microscopists, 
ten nurses, and one caretaker. 
Operations were conducted during the year 
in four adjoining areas: Tunapuna, Tacarigua, 
Arouca, and Lopinot, all included within the 
ward union, or borough, of Tacarigua. With 
the exception of Lopinot, these areas extend east- 
ward for a distance of about six miles along the 
Government railway, running from Port-of-Spain, 
the capital, to Sangre Grande. The Lopinot area 
is located in a range of hills in the northern part 
of the ward union; on its southern boundary it 
is contiguous with the Arouca area. 
All four areas include, besides one large village 
from which the area takes its name, a number of 
smaller villages. Neither the separate villages 
6 
 
-P-A-G-E-160
160 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 
nor the areas as a whole, however, form any 
sort of entity; they are merely a series of vil- 
lages formerly occupied by free laborers on ad- 
joining sugar estates, which have gradually 
grown together to form a compact, thickly 
settled strip along the railway. During the 
progress of the work in each area, headquarters 
for the staff were established in the village from 
which the area took its name. Almost all the 
inhabitants of the four areas engage in raising 
cocoa or sugar,—some as laborers on the large 
estates, the majority on small holdings which 
they own or lease. About 40 per cent are East 
Indians, the remainder consisting largely of 
persons of mixed negro or European blood. 
Work was in progress during 1916 in two other 
areas located further east along the Govern- 
ment railway, but the operations in these areas 
had not been completed by December 31, 1916. 
It was also found possible, during the progress 
of the work in the other areas, to conduct a 
second campaign in the Tacarigua Orphanage,— 
a small institution included within the bounda- 
ries of the original Tacarigua area, in which 
about 225 boys and girls under 17 years of age 
are housed. Special effort has been made to 
eradicate the disease from this institution. 
Examination and Treatment 
From August 11, 1914, the date on which 
measures against hookworm disease in Trinidad 
 
-P-A-G-E-161
  TRINIDAD 161 
were inaugurated, until May 15, 1915, the work 
was conducted according to the dispensary 
method. Since the latter date, however, a 
strictly intensive plan of work has been followed. 
Table 1 indicates that the total number of 
persons examined in all of the work conducted 
up to December 31, 1916, was 23,651,—13,447 
in the areas completed by the intensive method 
during 1916, and 10,204 in those completed by 
the dispensary method prior to 1916. Of the 
total number examined in all of the work to date, 
16,148, or 68.3 per cent, were found infected; 
13,524, or 83.8 per cent of those infected, were 
given first treatment; and 7,636—56.5 per cent 
of those receiving first treatment—were cured. 
In the table a comparison is given of the results 
accomplished by the dispensary and intensive 
methods. (See Table 1, page 162.) 
Although intensive work was in progress dur- 
ing seven and one half months in 1915, all re- 
sults accomplished by this method are assigned 
to the year 1916, owing to the fact that no area 
had been completed by this plan of work up to 
the end of 1915. For the Tunapuna area, in 
which operations were not brought to a close 
until April 30, 1916, the figures published in the 
second annual report have been withdrawn from 
the year 1915 and re-assigned to 1916. 
In the four areas in which operations by the 
intensive plan had been completed up to De- 
cember 31, 1916, there was a population of 14,156

estates, which have been heavily infected for 
many years, is undoubtedly largely responsible 
for the high rate of infection found. Further- 
more, many of the East Indians included in the 
population of these areas are employed on the 
nearby sugar estates, where they come in con- 
tact with the heavily infected indentured labor- 
ers and receive many opportunities to become 
infected. 
The effectiveness of the work in reducing the 
amount of existing infection is exhibited in 
Table 3. In the four areas a total of 10,021 
persons were originally found infected. Of 
these, 2,062, or 20.6 per cent, remained in the 
areas uncured at the close of work. Approx- 
imately three fifths of the persons not cured 
refused to accept or to continue treatment, 
while about one third could not be treated for 
medical reasons. (See Table 3, page 165.) 
Figures in detail showing the results of ex- 
amination and treatment in the areas completed 
during 1916 are exhibited in Table 4. In this 
table are presented the supporting figures upon 
which Tables 2 and 3 are based. (See Table 4, 
page 166.) 
Educational Work 
The first step in conducting educational work 
in an area is to hold a public meeting for ac- 
quainting the people with the nature and scope 
of the measures to be undertaken against hook- 
worm disease. This meeting is usually attended

by dignitaries of church and state, by medical 
officers and school teachers, by prominent 
planters, and by other influential persons. 
Following this meeting, lectures illustrated by 
charts and magic lantern pictures, and ac- 
companied by microscopic demonstrations, are 
held in the different schools. An effort is made 
to have present at some one of these lectures at 
least one representative of every family in the 
area. In addition, there are many informal 
talks in the homes of the people and in the 
office,—those in the office being illustrated with 
charts and photographs and accompanied by 
demonstrations of ova and embryos. 
In Table 5 figures are given showing the 
number of lectures delivered up to December 
$1, 1916, with the estimated total attendance. 
(See Table 5, page 168.) 
In Table 6 figures representing ‘the extent of 
educational work during 1916 are shown by 
areas. (See Table 6, page 169.) 
In the Arouca area the practice of giving 
open-air lectures was inaugurated. Rough 
drawings on frosted glass, accompanied by local 
photographs, are used in a revolving lantern pur- 
chased especially for these meetings. The screen 
is hung on the side of a building or suspended 
from the limb of a tree. By this means it has 
been found possible to reach and influence large 
numbers of persons whose coéperation in the work 
would otherwise have been difficult to obtain.

Sanitary Improvement 
In the principal village of each of the areas 
completed during 1916, sanitary conditions were 
better than in the average tropical town. In 
Tunapuna, an ample supply of water from moun- 
tain streams is piped along the streets and into 
some of the houses. The streets are well 
graded and the village is well drained. When 
measures against hookworm disease in this vil- 
lage were begun, all but 31 of the homes were 
found to be provided with satisfactory latrines, 
and at these 31 homes new latrines have since 
been built by order of the Government authori- 
ties. 
In the village of Tacarigua, the water supply 
comes from the same source as that of Tuna- 
puna; there are excellent roads; and the land is 
well drained by roadside gutters. In Arouca 
also the drainage is good, but the people depend 
for their drinking water upon wells, streams, 
and rainfall collected from roofs. 
Table 8 affords a comparison, for the areas in 
which operations were completed during 1916, 
of the number of homes provided with latrines 
when the work of examination and treatment 
began, with the number so provided when it 
ended. It will be seen that of 3,395 homes 
located within the boundaries of these areas, 
2,409, or 71.0 per cent, were found to be pro- 
vided with latrines on the first inspection. 
Practically all of these homes with latrines were
-P-A-G-E-171
TRINIDAD 171 
included within the boundaries of the principal 
towns. (See Table 8, page 172.) 
Very little progress was made in having new 
latrines installed at homes where none existed. 
The table shows that only 2,638 homes, or 77.7 
per cent of the total, were provided with latrines 
when the work of examination and treatment 
ended. This indicates that during the progress 
of the work, only 229 additional homes were 
provided with latrines. In the Arouca area, 
the latrines at 104 homes fell down or were 
abandoned between the first and last inspections, 
so that although 50 homes in this area were 
provided with new latrines during the progress 
of the work, the records indicate that the number 
of homes with latrines was 54 less when the work 
ended than when it began. If the figures for 
this area are excluded, the number of additional 
homes provided with latrine accommodation 
during the progress of the work was 283, in- 
stead of 229. 
Until December 31, 1916, the enforcement 
of laws governing the installation and use of 
latrines was in the hands of the Surgeon Gen- 
eral, who depended upon the wardens for assist- 
ance in carrying out his orders. Beginning 
with the new year, however, the Government 
has placed entire responsibility for sanitary 
improvement in the hands of the local authorities, 
and has given assurance that this work will be 
pushed with great vigor.

COSTA RICA 178 
COSTA RICA 
Operations for the relief and control of hook- 
worm disease in Costa Rica are conducted by a 
division of the national Department of Police 
known as the Department of Ankylostomiasis. 
Headquarters are in the city of San Jose. Dr. 
Louis Schapiro, the Director in charge, is as- 
sisted in the medical work by a staff consisting 
of an assistant director, three field directors, four 
microscopists, and a secretary. Throughout the 
year 1916, three permanent inspectors have been 
employed to give attention to sanitary improve- 
ment. In August, 1916, four additional tempo- 
rary inspectors, to be employed locally in the 
various areas of operation, and three additional 
local clerks, were authorized. Under the regula- 
tions establishing the Department, the provin- 
cial governors, the police, and the official physi- 
cians are required to aid the work, particularly 
with regard to sanitation. 
The work since its establishment on Septem- 
ber 23, 1914, has followed the dispensary plan, 
though in the later operations there has been an 
approach to the intensive system in every area 
where the topography and proximity of the 
homes would permit. In the latter plan of work, 
a definite area is selected and an accurate house 
and resident census taken. At this time con- 
tainers and identification cards are left, and each 
person is informed as to the date on which he
-P-A-G-E-174
  174 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 
should appear at the dispensary for examination 
and treatment. Frequent visits are made to all 
the homes, to urge those who have not presented 
specimens to come to the dispensary, and those 
who have taken treatment to return for re-ex- 
amination. After the lapse of a reasonable time, 
the inspectors or local sanitary police call for 
specimens and deliver treatments to persons who 
have not absolutely refused to codperate. 
The Republic is divided into seven provinces 
and 46 cantons, the canton corresponding to a 
county in the United States. The canton is 
usually the unit of operations, though in some 
cases certain districts within the cantons are 
selected and worked as units in themselves. 
Exclusive of the laboratory and dispensary main- 
tained in the city of San Jose, where work has 
been in progress since March 1, 1915, operations 
were conducted during 1916 in 12 areas located 
in four provinces of the Republic. In three of 
these areas, the work remained in progress on 
December 31, 1916; for this reason the figures 
for these areas are excluded from this report. 
The areas in which the work was completed are 
listed in Table 3, page 178. To certain of these 
areas—among them Canas; Santa Cruz, and 
Liberia—it is proposed later to return, the un- 
usually heavy rains during the summer having 
interfered with the work to such an extent that 
the operations in them could not be brought to 
a successful conclusion.

Examination and Treatment 
The total population of the areas completed 
from the inauguration of the work in Costa Rica 
on September 23, 1914, up to December 31, 1916, 
was 90,707. The number of persons examined 
was 70,876, or 78.1 per cent of the population; 
and 42,009, or 59.3 per cent of those examined, 
were found infected. First treatment was ad- 
ministered to 40,853 persons,—97.2 per cent of 
those infected; and 7,628—18.7 per cent of those 
receiving first treatment—were cured. These 
figures are shown in Table 1, which also presents 
separately the results accomplished in the areas 
completed during 1915 and 1916.

Included in the above statistics are the results 
accomplished at the Central Office during the 
period from March 1, 1915, to December 31, 
1916. Here the dispensary is in constant opera- 
tion, the work is conducted on a basis different 
from that in the field, and the figures are not 
strictly comparable with those for the field dis- 
pensaries. Table 2, therefore, presents sepa- 
rately the results in the field and at the Central 
Office during the entire period of work. In all 
tables in this chapter the figures for the central 
office at San Jose have been assigned entirely to 
the year 1916, owing to the difficulty, under the 
present system of reporting, of separating these 
figures by years.

persons enumerated in the census, examined, 
found infected, given first treatment, and cured 
in the areas completed during 1916. In this 
table are included the figures for the Central 
Office as well as the field dispensaries. (See 
Table 3, page 178.) 
It should be pointed out that the figures 
now reported for 1915 are not consistent with 
those published in the annual report for that 
year. During 1916, the records in Costa Rica 
were thoroughly revised, the results accom- 
plished in each area were re-assigned to the 
year during which the work in the area was 
completed, and figures for all work remaining 
uncompleted at the end of 1916 were excluded. 
New figures have also been furnished to show 
the number of persons examined and found 
infected; in earlier reports, the figures for 
examinations had related to the number of 
specimens. 
Educational Work 
In each district within the areas of operation 
at least two lectures are given, one to the public 
and the other to school children. These lectures 
are followed by house talks and conferences at 
the dispensary. The house talks have been 
found to afford the best medium for keeping 
in touch with the people and maintaining 
their interest in the work. On every visit 
to a district the director and assistant direc-

Up to December 31, 1916, Table 4 shows that 
614 public and school lectures had been deliv- 
ered to a total attendance estimated at 37,416. 
There were also 11,489 special conferences at 
which an estimated total of 110,040 persons were

laboratory is to be opened in a new district, 
circular letters are mailed to the local authori- 
ties, the church officials, and prominent citizens 
requesting their aid in the work. 
Table 5 indicates that up to December 31, 
1916, a total of 143,315 pieces of literature had 
been distributed, of which 18,053 were booklets 
and 75,196 were leaflets.

  Recently the high schools and colleges and the

their curricula a course on sanitary science and 
hygiene. Two hours weekly during the second 
and third years, and four hours weekly during 
the fourth year, will be devoted to this course. 
For the past one and one half years, weekly

lessons on hookworm disease and personal hy- 
giene have been given in the primary schools. 
Once a month the parents are invited to these 
lectures. From certain of the schools reports 
have been received that the lectures have been 
influential in diminishing the amount of sick- 
ness among the pupils. 
Sanitary Improvement 
Costa Rica has a law, enacted in 1915, which 
makes it obligatory for every home to be pro- 
vided with a latrine of a type approved by the 
Department of Ankylostomiasis. In centers of 
population such as the canton capitals, it is 
possible, by invoking the aid of the authorities, 
to have latrines installed and used; but in the 
rural districts a large staff of inspectors would 
be required to secure this result. In these dis- 
tricts, therefore, the educational work and the 
influence and codperation of the public authori- 
ties are relied upon to convince the householders 
of the need of sanitary betterment. 
Table 6 indicates that in the areas completed 
up to December 31, 1916, there were 9,446 
homes. On the first inspection, 1,273 of these, 
or 13.5 per cent, were found to be provided with 
latrines, as compared with 4,347, or 46.0 per 
cent, on the last inspection. During the prog- 
ress of the work, latrines were constructed at 
8,074 homes, representing 32.5 per cent of the 
total. (See Table 6, page 182.)

In Turrialba and Escasu! the authorities have 
employed a local sanitary inspector to supervise 
the construction of latrines and to help in the 
routine work of the laboratory. After the lab- 
oratories have left these districts, the inspectors 
will remain to continue the work of sanitary 
improvement. In the former district, there are 
one large sugar and four large coffee estates. 
The owners of three of the. coffee estates have 
built latrines for their laborers, and two have 
ordered off their estates all who would not 
be examined or who would not be treated 
and cured if found infected. 
1Work in this district remained in progress on December 31, 1916.

  Provision for three additional sanitary inspec- 
tors to work under the direction of the Depart-

budget of the Minister of Police for 1917, which 
has been approved by the National Congress. 
These men will become available later for ap- 
pointment to municipalities which may desire to 
employ permanent sanitary inspectors. The 
municipality of the Canton of Moras, further- 
more, has appropriated twenty colones to be

The work for the relief and control of hook- 
worm disease in Guatemala is conducted under 
the direction of the Department of Uncinariasis, 
which is a division of the National Board of 
Health. On June 28, 1916, Dr. Alvin M. Struse 
succeeded Dr. Walter H. Rowan as Director of 
this department. The working staff is com- 
posed of an assistant medical director, eight 
technical assistants, and two clerks. Head- 
quarters are in Guatemala City. 
The work of the year 1916 has been marked 
by closer association with the national Govern- 
ment, and by increased codperation and sup- 
port on the part of the Faculty of Medicine, the 
National Board of Health, and the physicians 
of the Republic. By presidential decree the 
installation of latrines on all plantations, and at 
all schools, residences, and other buildings, was 
made compulsory. An official order also pro- 
vides that soldiers and all pupils in the public 
schools shall be examined for hookworm disease, 
and that instruction in hygiene and public health 
shall be given in the schools. Governors and 
mayors are obligated to assist the work in all 
its phases. 
Activities follow the dispensary plan, though 
in the latter part of the year effort was made to . 
put the work on a strictly intensive basis. 
Plantations, or fincas, are the unit of operations.
-P-A-G-E-186
186 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 
Almost all are coffee estates, though there are a 
few on which sugar is raised. On the finca, con- 
ditions are peculiarly favorable for effective 
work against the disease: the population is con- 
centrated within small areas, there is usually a 
high percentage of infection, and considerable 
control may be exercised over the patients while 
they are being examined and treated. 
The medical assistant visits the different fincas 
on invitation from the owners and arranges for 
the work. One or two technical assistants are 
then assigned to each finca, or to a finca which 
serves as a base from which to conduct work on 
other estates in the vicinity. In their work on 
the estates, the technical assistants take a cen- 
sus, distribute containers, examine specimens, 
and dispense treatment. 
In the work to date, approximately 9,218 of 
the 48,290 square miles of the country have been 
covered. More than four fifths of the territory 
covered lies in the plateau region in the southern 
part of Guatemala, a short distance inland from 
the Pacific coast. The other region is located in 
the department of Alta Verapaz, a rich finca 
section in the central part of the Republic. As 
a whole, the country is mountainous, except 
along the coastal plains on the Atlantic and 
Pacific sides and in the extreme northern de- 
partment of El Peten. The soil is rocky and 
sandy; there are both wet and dry seasons; and 
there are marked extremes of temperature.
-P-A-G-E-187
GUATEMALA 187 
The estate laborers, mostly Indians, are illit- 
erate, unsanitary in their mode of life, and in 
the majority of cases present severe clinical 
symptoms of the disease. It has not been 
difficult to persuade them to take treatment. 
The town inhabitants are more intelligent and 
have shown a ready willingness to codperate in 
the work. 
Examination and Treatment 
Up to December 31, 1916, operations had been 
conducted on 294 fincas and in two towns. The 
total population of these fincas and towns, as 
enumerated by the staff, was 70,176. Of this 
total population, Table 1 indicates that 65,183, 
or 92.9 per cent, were examined for hookworm 
disease; and 41,666, or 63.9 per cent of those 
examined, found infected. First treatment was 
administered to 39,744, or 95.4 per cent of those 
infected; and 10,475, or 26.4 per cent of those 
receiving first treatment, were found negative on 
microscopic re-examination. The results during 
1915 and 1916 are exhibited separately in the 
table. (See Table 1, page 188.) 
' Although the table indicates that the infec- 
tion for the country is between 60 and 70 per 
cent, there are regions of low elevation, with 
sandy soil and a hot and moist climate, in which 
the infection is between 80 and 90 per cent. 
The zone of heaviest infection lies in the depart- 
ments of Retalhuleu, Suchitepequez, and Es-

The figures in Tables 1 and 2 include 433

Guatemala City. Here the infection is very 
light, and the work has been largely confined to 
the inmates of the General Hospital and to the 
poor. During the third quarter of 1916, a lab- 
oratory was established at the central office and 
placed at the disposal of the medical profession 
for the examination of specimens. Technical 
assistants in the field are also encouraged to send

to the central laboratory any interesting speci- 
mens, or specimens concerning which they are 
in doubt. 
A large part of the difference between the 
number of persons included in the census and 
the number examined represents the wandering 
element of the population. This is a class diffi- 
cult to control. Its members seem to originate 
from various centers which can be named, and 
it is hoped that eventually, when thorough work 
in these centers is undertaken, it will be possible 
to treat these persons until they have been 
cured. 
Educational Work 
On every finca at least one lecture is deliv- 
ered to the Indian laborers. The lantern slides 
and charts accompanying the lecture always 
interest the natives, even though they may not 
understand the language used by the speaker. 
Visitors are welcomed at the laboratories, and 
informal conferences and talks are held daily at 
the dispensaries and in the homes of the people. 
Table 3 indicates that up to December 31, 1916, 
985 public and 18 school lectures had been 
delivered to a total of 49,287 persons. (See 
Table 3, page 191.) 
Since the beginning of the work, 11,754 pieces 
of literature have been distributed, of which 
4,630 pieces were distributed during 1916. This 
includes bulletins, posters, charts, and letters.

  Sanitary Improvement 
The decree signed by the President during 
1916 makes the construction of latrines obliga- 
tory, but the Department in conducting its 
work has preferred to exercise no authority. 
Rather, it has sought to stimulate interest to a 
point where voluntary codperation could be 
secured. The initial survey of the fincas and 
towns in which work had been conducted up to 
December 31, 1916, showed, for a population of 
70,176 persons, only 576 latrines in use. By far 
7  
-P-A-G-E-192
    
192 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 
the greater number of these accommodated the 
families of finca owners and officials. For the 
laborers almost no accommodation was provided. 
In conference with the finca owners the wis- 
dom of preventing soil pollution on their estates 
is pointed out, and their duty to provide ade- 
quate latrine accommodation for their laborers 
is suggested. The records show that in the 
course of the work on their estates, 2,694 new 
latrines were erected. Each latrine is usually 
placed at the end of a row of laborers’ houses 
and accommodates about twenty persons. The 
total number of persons accommodated by the 
new latrines erected is approximately 47,836, or 
about three fourths of the total population. 
During 1916 alone, 1,646 new latrines were 
installed for the accommodation of 35,260 per- 
sons. These figures are exhibited in Table 4, 
which presents separately .the results accom- 
plished during 1915 and 1916.

The figures in this table do not represent the 
total results accomplished in sanitary reform. 
During the work on the fincas, a general disease 
census is made; the water supply is investigated 
and, if necessary, suggestions for improving it 
are given; and effort is made to develop a public 
sentiment favorable to sanitary measures. More- 
over, large numbers of latrines are built on some 
of the estates after the work of examination and 
treatment has ended. Figures for this work are 
not reported to the Department of Uncinariasis 
and consequently cannot be included in the 
record. 
The indifference or active opposition of a few 
owners has retarded or prevented the construc- 
tion of latrines on some of the estates. This is 
mainly responsible for the fact that, for the area 
of operations as a whole, the number of persons 
provided with latrine accommodation is not 
sufficient when considered in relation to the 
census. This difficulty may be obviated in the 
future under the authority conferred by the 
President’s decree.

NICARAGUA 
Measures against hookworm disease in Nica- 
ragua are conducted by the Department of Un- 
cinariasis, which was created in 1915 by presi- 
dential decree. During 1916, this Department 
remained under the direction of Dr. D. M. 
Molloy, aided by an assistant medical director 
and a staff consisting of three field directors, six 
technical assistants, and a secretary. 
Operations follow the dispensary plan, al- 
though in some areas certain features of the 
intensive method have been introduced. Head- 
quarters are in the city of Managua, where a 
central laboratory is maintained. Three dis- 
pensaries operate in the field. The unit of work 
is the town or municipality, within the jurisdic- 
tion of which certain surrounding territory is 
included. Effort is made to extend the work to 
the entire population embraced in each juris- 
diction. During 1916, practically no work was 
done on coffee or sugar plantations. 
On the Pacific side of Nicaragua, a chain of 
volcanic peaks runs parallel to the coast line a 
short distance inland, forming a great central 
basin and plateau region. The seven depart- 
ments embraced in this territory, although com- 
prising only one fourth the total area of the 
country, contain nearly 90 per cent of the inhab- 
itants. The work, since its beginning on October 
1, 1915, has been confined to the portion of this 
 
-P-A-G-E-195
  
NICARAGUA 195 
region extending from the Gulf of Fonseca on 
the north to the northwestern part of Lake 
Nicaragua on the south. 
The inhabitants of this area depend upon 
agriculture, trades, and commerce for their sub- 
sistence. They live almost entirely in towns, 
villages, or hamlets,—the majority in towns of 
considerable size. Relatively few people live 
permanently on the plantations. Almost all 
land is owned by large holders, the agricultural 
class cultivating the land as small tenants or 
wage-hands. Persons of mixed Indian and 
European descent, known racially as Mestizos, 
constitute about 80 per cent of the population. 
Full-blooded Indians, negroes, or whites are not 
numerous. 
Examination and Treatment 
In the areas in which work was conducted from 
October 1, 1915, to December 31, 1916, 31,570 
persons were examined for hookworm disease, of 
whom 19,199, or 60.8 per cent, were found 
infected. First treatment was administered to 
17,084, or 89.0 per cent of those infected. These 
figures are exhibited in Table 1, which presents 
separately the results during 1916 and during 
the period of three months in which operations 
were conducted during 1915. (See Table 1, 
page 196.)

imately 73 per cent. 
Beginning with the second quarter, 1916, the 
’ free use of the laboratory at the central office 
was tendered to the medical profession of Nica- 
ragua for the examination of feces. Mailing- 
case containers are sent to every physician who 
desires to avail himself of the privilege, and the 
results of the examination are recorded on cards 
sent in sealed envelopes. This service has done 
much to gain the good will of the physicians, 
from many of whom specimens are now regularly 
received,
-P-A-G-E-197

Educational Work 
Every one within the areas under operation is 
afforded an opportunity to hear the illustrated 
lectures; talks are given in all the schools; and 
informal lectures and demonstrations are held 
daily at the dispensaries. The parish priests 
usually aid the work by advising the people to 
codperate, and local physicians sometimes lend

newspapers have been of great importance in 
spreading a knowledge of the work. These 
newspaper supplements, printed by the Govern- 
ment printing office on the regular newspaper 
page, are profusely illustrated and tell in detail 
the story of the disease. They have been dis- 
tributed to the extent of 10,400 copies by seven 
of the leading newspapers in Nicaragua. In 
each case the newspaper has commented edito- 
rially on the importance of the supplement.

  Sanitary Improvement 
In the towns of Nicaragua the poorer class of 
inhabitants, representing at least 90 per cent of 
the population, live in huts with dirt floors, 
often humid or muddy during the rainy season. 
These huts are usually surrounded by large 
yards, in which soil pollution reaches its maxi- 
mum. 
1No figures reported for 1915.
-P-A-G-E-199
  NICARAGUA 199 
Among the middle class of inhabitants, ap- 
proximately one half of the homes are provided 
with latrines. In many cases commodes are 
used, the contents of which are either dumped 
into the latrines, or, in the absence of latrines, 
into the street. The upper class of people, 
though relatively few in number, all have toilet 
accommodations, usually of the flush type. 
On the sugar and coffee plantations during 
the few weeks of the harvesting season, large 
numbers of laborers are housed in barracks where 
almost no attention is paid to sanitation. With 
few exceptions, little or no effort is made to 
protect the health of the great mass of nomadic 
laborers during their temporary residence on the 
plantations. 
Little progress was made during 1916 in im- 
proving these conditions. Only 246 new latrines 
were installed, which, added to the 20 reported 
in 1915, makes a total of 266 to date. The prin- 
cipal reason for the poor showing in this phase of 
the work is that there are no general sanitary 
laws compelling the people to install and use 
latrines. A bill now pending in the national 
Congress offers much encouragement, but until 
it is passed no definite improvement in sanita- 
tion can be expected.

PANAMA 
During 1916, measures against hookworm 
disease in the Republic of Panama continued 
to be conducted by the Department of Unci- 
nariasis, a division of the national Department 
of Public Works. The work received further 
official recognition on December 27, 1916, when 
the Director of the Department of Uncinariasis 
was made, ex-officio, an honorary member of 
the National Board of Health. On January 15, 
1916, Dr. W. T. Burres succeeded Dr. L. W. 
Hackett as Director in charge. 
The work follows the dispensary plan, with 
four dispensaries in constant operation: one at 
the central office in Panama City and three in 
the field. The working staff during 1916 con- 
sisted of the Assistant Director, a secretary, three 
technical assistants, eight microscopists, and a 
porter. 
The Republic, with an area of 32,380 square 
miles, is divided into eight provinces, which are 
sub-divided into districts, corresponding to coun- 
ties in the United States. These districts, often 
of considerable size, average 531 square miles in 
area, and constitute the unit of operations. A 
period of from three to six months is devoted to 
the work in each district. The bulk of the popu- 
lation consists of morenos, or natives of mixed 
Spanish and Indian blood, though there are 
large numbers of full-blooded Indians and ne-
-P-A-G-E-201
  
   PANAMA 201 
groes, the latter being especially numerous in 
the Canal Zone. 
In the period extending from July 15, 1914, 
the date on which the work against hookworm 
disease was undertaken in Panama, to Decem- 
ber 31, 1916, operations had been conducted in 
six provinces and twenty-five districts of the 
Republic, including approximately two fifths of 
the total population of the country. Excluding 
the central office in Panama City, work had been 
completed up to December 31, 1916, in all but 
one of these districts. Since February, 1916, 
activities have been confined to the section of 
the country lying west of the Canal and south 
of the central mountain range, where the popu- 
lation is dense and a heavy infection exists. 
Examination and Treatment 
From the date of opening work on July 15, 
1914, up to December 31, 1916, 60,425 persons 
had been microscopically examined for hook- 
worm disease in Panama, and 43,990, or 72.8 
per cent, had been found infected. First treat- 
ment was administered to 41,227, representing 
93.7 per cent of the infected. Table 1 presents 
these figures in tabular form, and offers a com- 
parison of the results during 1916 with those 
during the period of approximately eighteen 
months prior to 1916. (See Table 1, page 202.) 
In the work conducted during the year 1916, 
as the table shows, 30,094 persons were examined,
-P-A-G-E-202

  of whom 24,193, or 80.4 per cent, were found 
infected, and 23,747, or 98.2 per cent of those 
infected, were treated. The figures for 1916 are 
presented in Table 2 by provinces and districts. 
In the provinces and districts where the number 
of persons given first treatment exceeds the 
number found infected, the excess is due to first 
treatment having been given during 1916 to 
many persons who had been examined and 
found infected during 1915. (See Table 2, 
page 203.) 
The 30,094 persons examined during 1916 rep- 
resented approximately 86 per cent of the total 
population of the districts in which work was 
conducted, including the inhabitants of sparsely 
settled and remote mountain regions. The 
higher percentage of infection found during 1916 
may be explained in part by a more careful 
technique of examination having been followed,

    but more largely by the work having been con- 
ducted in towns such as Divala, Alanje, and La 
Pintada, where the proportion of the population 
infected with hookworm disease greatly exceeds 
the average for the country. 
Although the table indicates that in Panama 
City, 1,281 persons were examined and 429, or 
33.5 per cent, found infected, hookworm disease 
practically does not exist among the actual 
 
-P-A-G-E-204

residents of this city, owing to thorough sanita- 
tion and the universal use of shoes. The persons 
found infected in the work at the central office 
are nearly always visitors from the Interior, or 
local residents who have become infected during 
vacation or other periods spent out of town. 
The most important development of the year’s 
work was the increase in the number of re-ex- 
aminations made and re-treatments adminis- 
tered. During 1916 the staff succeeded in 
administering at least two treatments to 88 per 
cent of the infected, as compared with 58 per 
cent in the period prior to 1916. This increased 
thoroughness is clearly reflected in Table 3, 
which compares the number of persons re-ex- 
amined, re-treated, and cured during 1916 with 
the number during 1914-1915.

Educational Work 
In each area in which work has been con- 
ducted, measures for educating the people along 
the lines of public health and sanitation play an 
important part. By public and private lectures, 
by conferences at the dispensaries, and by 
demonstrations and talks to school children, 
the purpose and scope of the work are ex- 
plained. 
Table 4 indicates that from July 15, 1914, up 
to December 31, 1916, three hundred formal 
lectures had been delivered to a total attendance 
estimated at 15,847 persons. This is exclusive 
of 12,979 personal conferences, at which 39,990 
persons were present.

  Sanitary Improvement 
While excellent results have been accom- 
plished in the clinical and educational work, 
efforts to achieve concrete results in sanitary 
reform have thus far been unsuccessful. A few 
latrines have been constructed for demonstra- 
tion purposes, but there are no effective laws 
requiring the construction of latrines, the Gov- 
ernment has been unable to give financial assist- 
ance to the work, and it is extremely difficult 
to enlist the voluntary codperation of any con- 
siderable number of the inhabitants. The atti- 
tude of the people is frequently that of actual
-P-A-G-E-207
PANAMA 207 
opposition, and in some sections even the physi- 
cians are opposed to latrines for the reason that 
the few that have been used in the past have 
been insanitary and a menace to health. 
In many parts of the country the problem 
would be unusually difficult even if the people 
were in sympathy with the idea. There are 
large areas of lowland, in which during the rainy 
season the latrines would become flooded. The 
basic problem in these sections is one of drainage 
rather than of latrine construction. In certain 
of the larger towns the Government proposes to 
install septic tank systems, but these are beyond 
the means of smaller communities. In the 
absence of effective Governmental supervision, 
pail latrines would unquestionably be neglected. 
Where the topography of the country is favor- 
able, pit latrines are easily constructed, and 
prove satisfactory in use. In such sections the 
staff will re-double its efforts during 1917 and 
endeavor to obtain permanent results in the 
improvement of sanitation. The President has 
been urged to strengthen the sanitary side of the 
work by issuing a decree requiring the construc- 
tion and use of latrines, and it is also hoped that 
funds will shortly become available for erecting, 
at schools and houses favorably situated, latrines 
which may serve as models to the rest of the 
community.

  208 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 
SALVADOR 
On October 25, 1915, the Republic of Salva- 
dor, through its legation at Washington, ex- 
tended the International Health Board an in- 
vitation to participate in measures for the relief 
and control of hookworm disease in that coun- 
try. Acting on this invitation, Dr. John A. 
Ferrell, the Assistant Director General of the 
Board, accompanied by Dr. W. H. Rowan, at 
that time the Director of the work in Guatemala, 
visited Salvador in November, 1915. After a 
series of conferences with the President and 
members of his cabinet, and with members of 
the National Board of Health, a Department of 
Uncinariasis was organized as a bureau of the 
National Board of Health, and arrangements 
were made for undertaking operations. Head- 
quarters were established in the city of San Salva- 
dor. Actual work was begun on March 6, 1916, 
under the temporary supervision of Dr. Rowan. 
On May 15, 1916, Dr. C. A. Bailey, who had 
been appointed to direct the work, arrived and 
assumed active charge of operations. 
Both the dispensary and intensive plans of 
work have been followed. A town or an estate 
is the unit of operations. Here the intensive 
method is applied. Persons who come to the 
laboratory from districts surrounding the towns 
and estates are examined and treated by the dis- 
pensary method. In the reports, however, the

results accomplished by the respective methods 
have not been shown separately, so that for the 
present the entire work in Salvador is classed as 
being of the dispensary type. The working staff 
consists of an assistant director, nine microscopists 
(four of whom are medical students, designated 
assistant field directors), and one secretary. 
To date the work has been confined to the 
department, or state, of San Salvador. At the 
suggestion of the central Government, activities 
were inaugurated in the capital city among the 
soldiers and government employes, and in the 
schools and public institutions. The first field 
laboratory was opened in August in the town of 
Apopa; by the end of the year there were five 
field laboratories in operation. The work in 
Apopa was concluded in December. This was 
the only field area in which operations had been 
concluded by the end of the year. 
Examination and Treatment 
The total population of the districts in which 
work had been conducted up to December 31, 
1916, was 11,727. As will be seen from Table 1, 
9,975, or 85.1 per cent, of these persons were 
examined for hookworm disease; and 3,444, or 
34.5 per cent of those examined, were found in- 
fected. First treatment was administered to 
2,946, representing 85.5 per cent of those found 
infected; and 1,311, or 44.5 per cent of those re- 
ceiving first treatment, were cured.

  The percentage of infection is comparatively 
low, owing to the large number of persons ex- 
amined and found negative in the city of San 
Salvador. The infection varies considerably in 
different localities and among different groups 
of persons. For instance, in a group of military 
recruits belonging to the cavalry, who were 
taken from many sections of the Republic, an 
infection of 89 per cent was found; at Apopa the 
infection was 51 per cent; and on two coffee 
plantations, situated on the slope of an extinct 
volcano, where climatic conditions are especially 
favorable for the spread of the disease, the infec- 
tion was 76 and 67 per cent, respectively. 
The removal of members of the military force, 
of the national guard, and of the municipal 
police from the field of operations after one or 
more treatments had been given but before re-

  examination could be made, is responsible for 
the small percentage of persons recorded as 
cured. There were also many persons treated 
once or twice under the dispensary plan who 
did not return for re-examination.

nation and treatment up to December 31, 1916,

Educational Work 
Educational work is conducted through the 
schools, by public and special lectures, and 
through ‘the press. Public lectures illustrated 
by the stereopticon are held in every district in 
which laboratories are established, and private 
talks are given in the houses when the census is 
taken. Microscopic demonstrations of eggs and 
larvae are also frequently given in the labora- 
tories and houses. ‘ 
The results of lecture work are summarized in 
Table 3. The special lectures include taiks to 
soldiers, municipal employes, and prisoners in 
the penitentiary. Talks with small groups in 
the laboratory and houses are classed as per- 
sonal conferences.

  Sanitary Improvement 
During the early months of the work, opera- 
tions were confined entirely to the city of San 
Salvador. Here there is a sewer system, which 
prevents to a large extent the spread of hook- 
- worm disease. In the rural regions, however, 
soil pollution is almost universal and sanitation 
is one of the greatest needs. For instance, in 
the areas in which operations had been con- 
ducted up to December 31, 1916, among a total 
of 558 homes, only 39, or 6.9 per cent, were pro- 
vided with latrines. In many rural districts, 
furthermore, conditions are peculiarly favorable 
for spreading the disease.
-P-A-G-E-214
  214 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 
Throughout the Republic there are many 
coffee and sugar estates. On the former the 
conditions favoring the spread of hookworm dis- 
ease are well recognized. On sugar plantations, 
latrine accommodations are absent, but the alti- 
tude is lower and the soil is not so well shaded 
nor so moist, especially during the dry season, 
when the sugar cane is harvested. The disease, 
therefore, is not so rife. The native laborers, 
however, often migrate back and forth between 
the two kinds of estates, being engaged today 
in picking coffee and tomorrow in harvesting 
cane. 
Efforts at sanitary improvement during the 
year have had to rely on education and per- 
suasion unbacked by legislation. Under these 
conditions very little progress has been made. 
It seems that there should be a special sanitary 
enactment compelling house owners to con- 
struct latrines under the supervision of the De- 
partment of Uncinariasis, with provision for 
municipal assistance in cases of poverty, and 
with a penalty for non-compliance. There is 
every prospect that during the coming year such 
a law will be passed by every department in the 
country.
-P-A-G-E-215
CEYLON 215 
CEYLON 
During 1916 the International Health Board 
began active participation in measures for the 
relief and control of hookworm disease in Cey- 
lon. The work in this colony is conducted as a 
branch of the Government Medical Department, 
under the supervision of Dr. G. J. Rutherford, 
Principal Civil Medical Officer. Control is 
vested in a local Ankylostomiasis Committee, 
composed of the Colonial Secretary, the Princi- 
pal Civil Medical Officer, members of the Estate 
Agents’ and Planters’ Associations, and promi- 
nent medical men of the colony. Of this com- 
mittee the Colonial Secretary is chairman. 
Efforts to eradicate the disease from Ceylon 
have been made for a number of years. At the 
time of the visit of the Director General of the 
International Health Board in 1914, definite 
plans for bringing the disease under control were 
formulated. These plans provided for the work 
to be conducted entirely by local agencies, the 
expense to be shared equally by the Government 
and the planters. Because of conditions grow- 
ing out of the war, however, this project had to 
be abandoned soon after it was begun. 
Later, on May 26, 1915, during the visit of 
the International Health Board’s Director for 
the East, arrangements were made for resuming 
measures for the control of the disease with the 
codperation of an officer of the Board. Active
-P-A-G-E-216
  216 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 
work was begun on January 12, 1916. At first 
the staff consisted of a Director, an assistant 
medical director, six apothecaries, and one care- 
taker, with all expenses, exclusive of the salary 
and personal allowance of the Director, borne 
equally by the Government and the planters. 
Later, in accordance with a new arrangement 
made by Dr. H. H. Howard, the Board’s Di- 
rector for the West Indies, who had been dele- 
gated to assist in organizing the work in Ceylon, 
the staff was enlarged to include a Director, an 
assistant medical director, three junior field 
directors (in training), four microscopists, twelve 
nurses, two clerical assistants, and one care- 
taker. Six of the nurses speak Tamil and Eng- 
lish and four Sinhalese and English, while two 
are Moors engaged to handle the Moorish 
population in the villages. This division rep- 
resents roughly the proportion of these elements 
of population. Under the new arrangement, the 
cost of the work is divided between the Govern- 
ment and the Board. From October 18 until 
the end of the year, the work in Ceylon was 
directed by Dr. W. Perrin Norris, Associate Di- 
rector for the East, with Dr. John E. Snodgrass 
in direct charge of operations in the field. 
The Matale district, located in the central 
part of the Island about seventy-five miles from 
Colombo, the capital, was chosen for initial 
operations. Roughly, this area is seven by ten 
miles in extent. Included within its boundaries

are twenty-four rubber and tea estates, and 
from forty to fifty towns, villages, and hamlets. 
The estate population numbers about 8,000 and 
averages one person to the acre; the village 
population is approximately 18,000. The dis- 
trict is mountainous, and large portions of it 
can be reached only on foot; on one estate, 
certain of the coolie lines are about five miles 
apart and difficult of access, as the estate ex- 
tends over a mountain range. 
Both the intensive and dispensary plans have 
been followed in the work to date. On the es- 
tates, where it is possible to exercise a consid- 
erable degree of control over the coolies while 
they are being examined and treated, and in the 
villages, the operations have been of the inten- 
sive type. In two of the villages, however, 
Alawatagoda and Wilane, in which operations 
were begun during the month of April, many 
obstacles, most of them of a religious nature, 
were encountered, and the work finally had to 
be abandoned before being completed. Exam- 
ination and treatment by the dispensary method 
was carried out in the central office at Matale 
and in the village of Katugastota. 
Up to December 31, 1916, operations had 
been brought to a close on ten estates and in 
the villages of Alawatagoda and Wilane, while 
work was in progress on five other estates and 
in four other villages, as well as in four schools 
and one college.

Examination and Treatment 
In the areas in which work by either the in- 
tensive or dispensary method had been com- 
pleted up to December 31, 1916, a total of 7,645 
persons was examined, of whom 7,358, or 96.2 
per cent, was found infected. First treatment 
was administered to 6,752 persons, or 91.8 per 
cent of those found infected, and 3,631, or 53.8 
per cent of those given first treatment, were 
cured. These figures are shown in Table 1, 
which compares the results accomplished by the 
intensive and dispensary methods. (See Table 1, 
page 219.) 
The figures in this table include the exami- 
nation of 170 Europeans, only 25 of whom 
were found to be infected. Excluding these 
from the calculations, the percentage of infec- 
tion rises to 98.1. This is the highest percentage 
encountered in any country with which the In- 
ternational Health Board has been codperating. 
The degree of individual infestation is also very 
great, requiring on the average a large number 
of treatments to effect a cure. 
The table shows that the intensive work was 
much more effective on the estates than in the 
villages. In addition to religious opposition, 
which leads the adherents of one faith instinc- 
tively to oppose measures in which the adher- 
ents of another faith are participating, the vil- 
lagers have the fixed belief that it is dangerous 
to take a purgative during wet weather; and as

a large proportion of the days are more or less 
rainy, this constitutes a serious hindrance to 
the work. Many lightly infected Sinhalese vil- 
lagers have also declined to be treated, claiming 
they felt no ill effects from their infection. 
The effectiveness of the intensive work in 
reducing the number of persons infected with 
hookworm disease on the estates and in the 
villages, is exhibited in Table 2. This shows 
that on the estates only 4.7 per cent of the per- 
sons originally found infected remained uncured 
when the work of examination and treatment 
ended. Practically all of these were persons who 
could not be treated or cured for medical reasons.

  The fact that the estate laborers move about

estates while the work was going on. This mili- 
tates strongly against the best results being 
obtained in the work of examination and treat- 
ment. On one estate employing a force of about 
275 men, on which.work had been conducted up 
to September 4, 1916, the superintendent stated 
that at the end of the year there remained not 
more than 30 to 40 per cent of those who had

been treated. In their places, new, and pre- 
sumably infected, laborers had been employed, 
thereby increasing the likelihood that those who 
had been cured would be re-infected. 
The detailed results of examination and treat- 
ment by the intensive method are shown in 
Table 3. (See Table 3, page 221.) 
Educational Work 
Extensive publicity has been obtained through 
the press and by means of lectures and the dis- 
tribution of literature. Table 4 shows that up 
to December 31, 1916, 43 lectures had been 
delivered to a total attendance estimated at 
6,005 persons, and that 118 house-to-house talks, 
attended by an estimated total of 1,565 persons, 
had been delivered.

In addition, more than 3,500 leaflets in Eng- 
lish, Sinhalese, and Tamil were distributed on 
the estates and in the schools, and more than 
1,900 letters were mailed. The most far-reach- 
ing work of this kind was the publication by 
the newspapers and journals of special articles 
and editorials on the subject of hookworm dis- 
ease. A popular article published in the Kand- 
yan Journal, a native newspaper, was translated 
into English for distribution to estates, and into 
Sinhalese for distribution to schools. It is es- 
timated that this article alone reached about 
600,000 persons. Another popular article was 
issued in leaflet form by the Government Medi- 
cal Department, and a copy sent to every estate 
in the colony with the suggestion that it be read 
to the laborers twice weekly at muster. A more 
comprehensive and technical article, published 
originally in the Planters’ Journal, was re-pub- 
lished as a pamphlet and distributed among the 
medical profession. 
Early in the year arrangements were made to 
receive at the office in Matale, for training in 
microscopic technique, a limited number of med- 
ical dispensers from various estates. So great 
was the interest in this work that only a small 
proportion of those who applied could be ac- 
commodated. However, fifty-one men, repre- 
senting nearly every planting district in Ceylon, 
were given instruction for periods varying from 
seven to fifteen days each,

  INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 
Sanitary Improvement 
A sanitary survey made at the beginning of 
operations showed that none of the ten estates 
on which the work was completed during 1916, 
were provided with latrine accommodations for 
their laborers, while in the Alawatagoda and 
Wilane villages only 9 latrines were found at 
274 homes. In April the Senior Sanitary Officer 
detailed a sanitary officer and two inspectors to 
supervise the installation of latrine accommoda- 
tions in these villages. They encountered many 
difficulties, but were able during the progress of 
their work to have 184 additional homes pro- 
vided with satisfactory latrines, leaving only 81 
still to be provided. This work is being con- 
tinued. 
During November, the Government passed 
rules in connection with an existing ordinance, 
making it compulsory for all estates to provide 
adequate latrine accommodations for their labor- 
ers within the period of one year. Previously it 
had made provision for two medical inspectors 
to have charge of estate sanitation. Neither of 
these positions, however, was filled during the 
year. The Senior Sanitary Officer has no au- 
thority to supervise estate sanitation. No sani- 
tary officer, therefore, was available to give at- 
tention to this branch of the work. It is expected 
that in the near future the Senior Sanitary Officer 
will be given authority to supervise both estate 
and village sanitation. Nearly all the estate     
-P-A-G-E-225
  CEYLON 225 
superintendents are anxious to install latrines, 
but lack information as to the most suitable 
type. During the year, 51 composite latrines, 
having a total of 302 compartments, were con- 
structed for use on the ten estates. This work 
will undoubtedly proceed until sufficient accom- 
modations have been provided for all thelaborers.

il. TECHNIQUE OF EXAMINATION 
AND TREATMENT 
I 
MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION 
In British Guiana, St. Lucia, and Nicaragua 
during 1916, experiments were conducted for 
determining the importance of the centrifuge in 
preparing specimens for examination, as well 
as for indicating the proper number of slides to 
be examined from each specimen before and 
after it is centrifuged. In Nicaragua the ex- 
amination of 319 recruits for the army showed 
that 6.9 per cent persons were recorded as 
positive after their specimens had been centri- 
fuged who would have been recorded as negative 
if the centrifuge had not been used. Thefigures 
are as follows:

Approximately the same result was obtained

226
-P-A-G-E-227
       MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION 227 
per cent additional specimens were recorded as 
positive after being centrifuged. 
In British Guiana it had been the custom to 
examine seven 2 x 3” slides before centrifuging, 
and seven additional slides after centrifuging, 
before pronouncing any specimen negative. 
During the year, tests were made to ascertain if 
so thoroughgoing a technique was required to 
detect practically all of the infected cases. 
Three smears were made from each specimen 
and examined. If no eggs were found an 
emulsion was made and centrifuged, and three 
additional slides examined. From the same 
specimen seven slides were then made, and if 
no eggs were found an emulsion was made and 
centrifuged, and seven additional slides exam- 
ined. Two thousand specimens were examined 
in this way. It was found that by the short 
technique the results were the same as by the 
long, with the exception of two specimens. 
In these the result was negative by the short 
method and positive by the long. In other 
words, the extra eight slides which wereexamined 
(four before and four after centrifuging) resulted 
in the finding of only two additional positive 
specimens,—showing that-in the examination 
by the short method there was an error of only 
one tenth of one per cent. 
In St. Lucia a census of 2,662 persons was 
handled, with an infection of 47 per cent, and 
including all necessary subsequent examinations    
-P-A-G-E-228
    
   228 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 
  only three instances were found in which infec- 
tion was recorded on the third slide examined 
after centrifuging. It was therefore decided 
that the examination of two slides after centri- 
fuging was sufficient for practical purposes. 
These experiments in British Guiana and St. 
Lucia during 1916 confirm the tests carried out 
in Trinidad during 1915, in which, among a 
total of 1,434 specimens examined, 895 were 
found positive by the examination of two slides 
before and two after centrifuging. On the third 
slide examined after centrifuging, not one addi- 
tional positive specimen was recorded. 
Il 
TREATMENT 
Further experiments as to the value of oil of 
chenopodium in the treatment of hookworm 
disease were conducted during the year. The 
efficacy of this drug was tested under varying 
conditions of administration, in doses of different 
sizes, and in certain instances studies were made 
of its value in comparison with thymol and 
beta-naphthol. Practically all reports agree 
that oil of chenopodium is the most effective 
remedy for expelling Ascaris, and that it is more 
active than thymol in the treatment of infection 
with Oxyuris and Trichocephalus. As to its 
value in the treatment of hookworm infection, 
however, the reports received have been con-   
-P-A-G-E-229
TREATMENT 229 
flicting in character,—the result, perhaps, of 
differences in the strength and potency of the 
drug, in the laboratory technique employed, or 
in the methods of administration. 
Alarming symptoms, and sometimes death, 
have been reported in the Southern States, the 
West Indian colonies, Panama, Nicaragua, Cey- 
lon, and Egypt following the administration of 
the drug in accordance with accepted methods 
of treatment, and in nearly every instance in 
less than the maximum dose. Extreme caution 
in the use of the drug is therefore indicated until 
its proper method of preparation has been 
learned, its chemical composition and stability 
standardized, and a safe dosage and method of 
administration established. The fact that the 
drug is a powerful poison, often uncertain in 
action under conditions at present attending its 
preparation and administration, should lead all 
medical officers to be extremely discriminating 
in its use. 
In administering the drug in Nicaragua, Dr. 
Molloy reports that no arbitrary dosage has 
been followed. The dose recommended by Dr. 
Schiiffner, 1.00 gram to 1.20 grams as the 
maximum (15 to 18 minims), was followed for a 
while, but this was found to be insufficient under 
ordinary conditions. The dose was finally in- 
creased to a maximum of 2.00 grams (30 minims). 
In none but very exceptional cases was a dose 
of 3.00 grams (recommended by some physicians 
 
-P-A-G-E-230
  230 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 
in the Far East) prescribed in a dispensary. 
The maximum dose which can be safely pre- 
scribed in dispensaries operating in Central 
America, where the average weight is about 120 
pounds, is believed by Dr. Molloy to be 2.00 
grams. 
As a rule the dose is proportioned according 
to age, as follows: Two drops for each year of 
age to the age of 24, 48 drops being considered 
the maximum. ‘This amount of the ordinary oil 
of chenopodium, dropped from a dropping 
bottle, weighs approximately 2.00 grams. This 
dose is always given in two or three equal parts, 
with an hourly, or two-hourly, interval between 
portions (two hours if given in two equal parts, 
or one hour if given in three equal parts). 
The mode of administration followed is 
essentially as follows: All solid food is prohibited 
after the midday meal the day before adminis- 
tering the drug. At 4 p. m. of this day, the 
patient is given a cleansing purge of Epsom 
salts. By giving this preliminary purge at 
4 o'clock, the necessity of having to get up during 
the night is avoided, since the purgative will have 
acted, as a rule, before bed-time. 
At 6 o’clock the following morning, before any 
food is eaten, the first portion of sugar containing 
the chenopodium is taken, followed by the 
remainder at hourly or two-hourly intervals. 
Two hours after the last of the chenopodium, a 
good dose of Epsom salts (usually a little more
-P-A-G-E-231
       TREATMENT 231 
than an ounce for adults) is taken to expel the 
worms. ‘This is repeated, if necessary, in two 
hours. 
During the last quarter of the year, a series 
of experiments was begun in Nicaragua to 
determine the efficacy of chenopodium treat- 
ment under given conditions and in given doses. 
These experiments are still under way, and will 
be continued until a large number of cases have 
been treated. ‘ 
Chenopodium oil, alone, is being used as the 
basis of treatment. Chenopodium oil mixed 
with a sufficient amount of oil of eucalyptus to 
disguise its unpleasant taste and odor (three 
parts chenopodium and one part eucalyptus) 
and chenopodium in capsules, are also being 
used. These treatments are being given to the 
recruits of the Nicaraguan army, are personally 
administered by a technical assistant, and all 
examinations are made with the use of the centri- 
fuge. Data on the treatment of 140 cases to date 
reveal the results shown in Table 1, page 232. 
While this series is too small for drawing 
deductions, it would seem to indicate that the 
addition of 25 per cent of oil of eucalyptus adds 
to the efficiency of the drug (51.4 per cent of 
cures resulting from one treatment, as against 
48.6 per cent from one treatment with oil of 
chenopodium alone). 
In Salvador, oil of chenopodium, given usually 
in capsules, and thymol with equal parts of

sugar of milk, also administered in capsules, 
are the drugs which have been used. In some 
instances both oil of chenopodium and thymol 
have been given to the same patients. When 
chenopodium is taken the preliminary purge is 
omitted, a dose of Epsom salts being given in 
the majority of cases following the last dose of 
chenopodium. No re-examinations are made 
in less than one week following the last treat- 
ment; in most cases, a longer period is allowed. 
The centrifuge is used, two slides being examined 
before and two after centrifuging. 
In this country, experiments were conducted 
as to the relative efficiency of three methods of 
treatment—that is, oil of chenopodium alone, 
thymol alone, and one dose of oil of chenopodium 
followed by thymol for the second and for all 
subsequent treatments. These experiments, 
however, have not progressed sufficiently to 
draw positive conclusions. From the investi- 
gations so far conducted it would appear that 
with fifteen drops of oil of chenopodium ad- 
ministered every one or two hours for three 
doses, followed by castor oil, a larger number of 
persons are cured with two treatments than 
when thymol is administered. The following 
comparison of the results obtained in two 
districts, in one of which thymol was used 
and in the other oil of chenopodium, is offered 
by Dr. Bailey to substantiate this tentative 
conclusion:

  In three laboratories operating in Panama, 
thymol is used; in one, chenopodium. Each 
drug is reported as having its advantages. At 
the close of the third quarter, 1916, a change to 
the exclusive use of chenopodium was being 
considered, but during the last quarter the 
results obtained by the laboratory using cheno- 
podium were unsatisfactory. The cause may 
have been faulty technique on the part of the 
new microscopists employed in that laboratory, 
the drug may have been poor in quality, or 
there may have been some other cause not yet 
determined. 
In administering the drug in Guatemala, a 
mathematical table of dosage is not adhered to. - 
The minimum dose is 0.65 ¢.c.; the maximum, 
8.00 c.c. Toa child below ten years, either the 
minimum dose is given or the dose is increased 
according to the physical condition of the child; 
to an average adult, 2 c.c. is given; and to a 
strong, vigorous male, the maximum dose. At 
each treatment the dose is divided into three 
portions, with one hour intervals. Two hours 
following the last dose, a purge of sodium sul-

phate is administered. The chenopodium is 
given in sugar, in molasses, or in honey. It is 
administered in the early morning, and the 
patient is able to take his treatment and perform 
his day’s work. During 1916, three days were 
allowed to elapse between treatments. Three 
days after the second treatment had been admin- 
istered the patient was re-examined. Three 
slides were carefully examined before the speci- 
men was pronounced negative. The centrifuge, 
however, was not used. 
In Costa Rica, Dr. Schapiro reports that 
chenopodium is used in preference to thymol. 
The following table indicates the maximum 
dose, according to apparent age and 80 per cent 
hemoglobin, as administered in that country. 
The maximum dose, however, is reduced ac- 
cording to the physical development of the 
patient and the percentage of hemoglobin in 
his blood. 
Age Dose 
Years Drops? 
  1 This interval between treatment and re-examination is believed by 
most authorities to be too brief. It has been established that because 
of the action of chenopodium in inhibiting the laying of eggs by female 
hookworms, an interval of at least ten days should elapse between treat= 
ments.

  The drug is administered in a mixture of 
equal parts of syrup of brown sugar and strong 
extract of coffee. Dr. Schapiro reports that by 
this means it is more easily taken, the disagree- 
able taste is masked, and the dizziness frequently 
following its administration is practically elimi- 
nated, so that the patient can return to his home 
to take the second purge. 
In the West Indies, less satisfactory results 
have been reported from the use of chenopodium. 
In Trinidad, the drug was used in lieu of thymol 
in one district, the conditions in which differed 
in no way from those in other districts. The 
work in this district was opened by one of the 
most successful nurses, and later, when he had 
to be taken to another field, it was always possi- 
ble to have an unusually good nurse to administer 
treatment. Work in this district was begun on 
April 2, 1916, and the last treatments were given
-P-A-G-E-237
  TREATMENT 237 
September 29, 1916, the work being carried on 
for a period of practically six months. 
The drug used was supplied in bulk by the 
medical storekeeper of this colony. The name 
of the manufacturer could not be learned. It 
was carefully measured in capsules of proper 
size and sealed in the office, under the direc- 
tion of the Medical Officer in Charge. The 
drug was used the same week that it was encap- 
sulated. 
The dosage was 21 minims for an adult male 
or large female, and 17 minims for the average 
female.. Children received one minim for each 
year of age. A purge, magnesium sulphate, was 
administered the night before the oil of cheno- 
podium was taken. One third of the dose of oil 
of chenopodium was administered at 6 a. m., a 
like amount at 7 a. m., and the last portion at 
8 a.m. At 10 a. m. a second purge of mag- 
nesium sulphate was given. The patient was 
required to fast until noon. It was necessary 
to use magnesium sulphate instead of castor 
oil, because in Trinidad there is an exceedingly 
strong local prejudice against the latter and it is 
practically impossible to induce persons of the 
lower class to take it. 
The centrifuge was used in re-examining speci- 
mens, two slides being examined before and two 
after centrifuging. Specimens were collected 
for re-examination on the sixth day after each 
treatment. If positive, the patient received 
 
-P-A-G-E-238
  238 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 
another treatment the following day. If nega- 
tive, another specimen was obtained on the 
eleventh day or later. No patient was pro- 
nounced cured unless his stool was free of eggs 
at least eleven days after treatment. Sixty- 
three specimens taken six or seven days after 
treatment were negative on microscopic exami- 
nation; twenty-five specimens taken from five 
to ten days later from the same patients were 
positive. This apparently indicates that many 
worms which are not actually killed by the 
drug have their reproductive functions inter- 
fered with in such manner that it is many days 
before they resume laying eggs. Therefore, 
the ordinary method of examining a patient 
six days after treatment is not believed to be 
sufficiently accurate when this drug is employed. 
Patients still positive after five successive 
treatments with oil of chenopodium were given 
thymol for the sixth and seventh treatments, 
after which the use of chenopodium was con- 
tinued. There were 127 patients cured in this 
district, of whom 112 required less than six 
treatments. Four were cured by the sixth and 
four by the seventh treatments, in which 
thymol was administered. Of the other seven 
persons cured, four were cured after the 
eighth treatment, one after the tenth, and 
two after the twelfth, in all of which chenopo- 
dium was used. This is shown in the follow- 
ing summary:

There were no very serious effects of the oil 
on any of the patients. The most serious mishap 
was collapse in a child of three, on whom the 
second dose of magnesium sulphate had had no 
effect. She recovered after a dose of castor oil. 
There were, however, an extraordinary number 
of complaints from this district, complaints 
which, while petty in themselves, had a great 
influence in preventing further treatment of the 
patients and their friends. These complaints 
were of dizziness and weakness, which lasted 
two or three days after treatment. There was 
also the well-known symptom of tingling in the 
palms of the hands. This was described by the 
patients as ‘“‘a heat,” and seemed to have an 
unfavorable psychic effect on them. The com- 
bined effect of these petty complaints was to 
compel the medical officer and chief nurse to 
spend a great deal of their time in this district
-P-A-G-E-240
240 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 
reassuring the patients and urging them to 
continue treatment. 
The statistics for this district, in comparison 
with the average for sixteen districts in which 
thymol exclusively was used, are given in Tables 
2 and 3. (See Tables 2 and 3, page 241.) 
In the district in which chenopodium was 
used, a much greater effort was required on the 
part of the nurse and director to induce the 
patients to take treatment than in the district 
in which thymol was employed. Because of 
this additional effort, the nurse could not handle 
so many patients at a time. The nurse’s work 
was further increased by the additional number 
of specimens that it was necessary to collect, 
and was delayed by the long time which had 
to be allowed between the treatment and re- 
examination of each patient. These considera- 
tions are aside from the possible dangers of the 
drug, as shown by two cases of collapse in the 
Trinidad campaign (one was reported in 1915). 
With thymol, in an experience many times as 
great, no such accidents were recorded in the 
Trinidad work. 
Chenopodium was used in almost all districts 
in Grenada from August 26 until the close of the 
year, because of inability to obtain a supply of 
thymol. The average adult dose was twenty 
minims: ten minims at 6 a. m. and ten at 8 
a.m. Epsom salts was administrated the night 
before treatment, as well as two hours after the

last dose of chenopodium had been taken. One 
district was treated with beta-naphthol for pur- 
poses of comparison. 
In all cases two treatments not less than one 
week apart were administered before re-examina- 
tion. If the patient remained uncured, two 
more treatments were administered before the 
next re-examination. The cases remaining un- 
cured after four treatments were treated with 
thymol. In all cases the medicine was swal- 
lowed in the presence of the nurse. 
As to the comparative efficacy of oil of cheno- 
podium and beta-naphthol, the figures in Table 
4 indicate that 47.3 per cent of those examined 
after two treatments with oil of chenopodium 
were found to have been cured, as compared 
with 25.8 per cent of those examined after two 
treatments with beta-naphthol. Of those ex- 
amined after fourtreatments, the table shows that 
58.3 per cent of those treated with chenopodium 
were found to have been cured, as compared 
with 836.2 per cent of those treated with beta- 
naphthol. Inasmuch as thymol was used for 
treating all cases remaining uncured after four 
treatments, no data were secured as to the 
establishment of tolerance to chenopodium,— 
which in many cases has been urged as an objec- 
tion to the use of this drug. (See Table 4, page 
243.) 
The principal objection noted to the use of 
oil of chenopodium in Grenada is the loss of

more than a week between treatments, due to 
the necessity of waiting fourteen days to obtain 
a specimen for re-examination. This necessity 
was indicated by the re-examination of 55 cases 
which had been re-examined from six to thirteen 
days following treatment and found negative. 
All fifty-five of these cases were again re-exam- 
ined at the end of fourteen or more days after 
treatment, and twelve of the cases were found 
to be positive. In the re-examination of speci- 
mens the same technique was followed as in 
Trinidad. 
Dr. Colwell reports that distaste for the drug 
and irritating symptoms are more marked with 
chenopodium than with thymol. The symp- 
toms noted are mainly dizziness and faintness, 
which may continue for several days. No 
serious or permanent symptoms have been 
observed. 
In St. Lucia a trial of chenopodium was made 
with liberal samples of five and ten-minim cap- 
sules. A small area was chosen, having a 
census of 92, of whom 41, or 44 per cent, were 
infected. One person left the locality before. 
treatment was started. 
The dosage adopted for adults (16 years and 
upwards) was three capsules of ten minims each: 
one capsule every half hour, followed by a dose 
of Epsom salts after the third capsule. On the 
evening before the chenopodium was adminis- 
tered, a dose of salts was given. The dose of 
 
-P-A-G-E-245
  
TREATMENT 245 
salts following the capsules was graduated 
according to the effects that had already been 
produced. Tochildren 9 to 15 years of age, three 
capsules of five minims each were given, with 
still smaller doses for those who were younger. 
No complaints were heard other than of an 
occasional heavy purgation. The activity of 
the oil in expelling roundworms was often a 
source of gratification to the patient or parent. 
Of the 40 who took the first treatment, 29 were 
registered as cured as the result of the treatment; 
7 were cured after two treatments; 3 required a 
third; and one is doubtful, not having yet taken 
the second treatment. 
During the early months of the work in Cey- 
lon, oil of chenopodium was administered in 
maximum doses of eight minims, repeated in 
two hours. Castor oil was the only purgative 
used at this time. Subsequently, the dose was 
increased to ten and then to twelve minims, 
until, upon the recommendation of the Malaya 
Board and of Colonel W. Perrin Norris, Asso- 
ciate Director for the East, it was increased to a 
maximum of sixteen minims, repeated hourly 
for three doses. Towards the end of the year, 
magnesium sulphate was used almost to the 
exclusion of castor oil as a purgative. With 
the 8 minim doses, it was rare that more than 
20 to 30 per cent of cures were secured after 
two treatments. As the size of the dose was in- 
creased better results were obtained, until,
-P-A-G-E-246
  
246 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 
among one group of patients, there were 65.7 
per cent of cures after two treatments. 
At the present time, the dispensers in Ceylon 
are given the following instructions concerning 
the administration of chenopodium: 
1. Oil of chenopodium may be administered in 
accordance with the following table: 
    
   Age Dose of Chenopodium 
Lito Biveatas.. 1... wid 8 minims hourly for three doses 
S3to 5 years 4to 5 minims hourly for three doses 
6 to 10 years..... 6 to 9 minims hourly for three doses 
11 to 16 years 10 to 18 minims hourly for three doses 
17 to 50 years. ....14 to 16 minims hourly for three doses 
Above 50 . -12 to 14 minims hourly for three doses 
In any instance where it is impossible or impracti- 
cable to give three doses for a treatment, the maximum 
dose may be divided into two equal parts, and the 
second portion be administered at an interval of one 
or two hours after the first. 
2. The drug may be administered on sugar, in 
milk, or in gelatin capsules or globules. 
8. On the evening before the treatment is to be 
given, a dose of Epsom salts is administered in accord- 
ance with the following table: 
    Age Dose of Epsom salts solution 
lto 5 years ... 4 drams of the solution 
6 to 10 years. . 8 drams of the solution 
11 to 15 years. .12 drams of the solution 
16 to 20 years. .16 drams of the solution 
21 and above.... .. .% drams of the solution 
Five pounds of Epsom salts dissolved in five gallons 
of hot water makes the above solution. 
In case this solution is objectionable to certain per- 
sons, castor oil may be given as the purgative, in which 
case give as follows: 
Age Dose of castor oil 
 
-P-A-G-E-247
  TREATMENT 247 
One and one_ half ounces is usually the maximum 
dose that should be given to a female. 
4. At, say, 6 o’clock the following morning give 
the first dose of chenopodium and repeat this dose at 
7 and 8 o’clock; at 10 o’clock give a purgative similar 
in size to, or, if the bowels moved thoroughly, smaller 
than, the one given on the previous evening. 
5. Only a light meal should be eaten the evening 
before treatment, and no food and very little water 
should be taken on the morning of treatment, until 
after the bowels have moved well following the second 
purgative. 
6. No alcohol in any form, or acids, should be taken 
for a period of twelve hours before and after taking oil 
of chenopodium, as these substances assist in the ab- 
sorption of the drug into the system, and this is very 
undesirable. Symptoms of poisoning may follow if 
this precaution is disregarded. 
7. Dispensers on estates should keep their cases 
under direct observation until after the last dose of 
the purgative has been given and has acted. Dispen- 
sers in the villages should arrange to be notified in 
case any of their cases become ill after treatment, or 
if the purgative does not move the bowels thoroughly, 
in which case it should be repeated. 
8. No treatment should be given until a medical 
officer has examined the person. The dispenser must 
not treat persons who have developed the following 
conditions after previous treatment, until after re- 
examination by a medical officer: 
(a) Very old or emaciated persons, who are made 
weak by, or after, treatment; 
(b) Persons suffering from acute diseases, such as 
malaria, dysentery, rheumatism, etc.; 
(c) Children under two years of age, who become 
ill after treatment; 
(d) Pregnant women, who should not be treated in 
any instance. 
9. No re-examination of the excrement should be 
made until one week has elapsed after the second 
treatment; such examination should be made one week 
after each succeeding treatment. Treatments should 
be repeated every ten days until the case is cured.
-P-A-G-E-248
  248 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 
In case only two doses are given for a treatment, it 
may be repeated at the end of eight days. The excre- 
ment should not be re-examined in less than one week 
after treatment, for the reason that the drug causes 
the female worm to stop laying eggs for a number of 
days, and if examination is made in less than one week, 
the specimen may be negative when in reality the worms 
have not all been expelled. 
In connection with the use of thymol as a 
specific for hookworm disease, experiments con- 
ducted in Trinidad seem to indicate that when 
this drug is mixed with equal parts of sodium 
bicarbonate it produces cures more promptly 
and with fewer disagreeable symptoms than 
when mixed with equal parts of sugar of milk. 
The first mixture has also the advantage of 
being more economical. 
For conducting the experiments two districts 
were chosen, in the first of which sugar of milk 
and thymol were used; in the second, sodium 
bicarbonate and thymol. In the first district, 
of the total number of persons cured, 43 per 
cent had been cured at the end of two treatments 
and 76 per cent at the end of four treatments, 
as compared with 51 per cent at the end of two 
treatments and 83 per cent at the end of four 
treatments in the second district. This shows 
a greater effectiveness on the part of the sodium 
bicarbonate mixture of 8 per cent at the end of 
two treatments, and of 7 per cent at the end 
of four treatments. 
The conditions of the test were strongly 
favorable to the thymol-sugar of milk combina-
-P-A-G-E-249
TREATMENT 249 
tion. In the district in which this mixture was 
used, the percentage of infection was lower, 
being 82.5 as compared with 95.2 in the district 
where the thymol-sodium bicarbonate mixture 
was used. It has been found that the degree of 
infection is usually most severe and the individ- 
ual cases most difficult to cure in districts having 
the highest percentage of infection, the large 
proportion of infected persons and the absence 
of sanitary accommodations in such districts 
tending to produce a constant source of infection. 
Again, the population of the second district was 
composed almost entirely of East Indians, who, 
because of their insanitary mode of living, 
always present large numbers of heavily infected 
cases. 
The following statement gives in tabular form 
a comparison of the results obtained by the two 
different methods of mixing thymol. In the 
two columns to the right, the total number of 
persons cured by each method is shown, followed 
by the number of persons cured after each treat- 
ment.:. The figures in the two columns to the 
left represent the percentage of persons cured 
after each treatment, 100 per cent representing 
the total number of persons cured in each 
district. (See Table 5, page 250.) 
In addition to the patients treated with thy- 
mol and sodium bicarbonate in District I, 
1In Trinidad, microscopic re-examinations for determining cure are 
made following the first and third treatments.

V. FINANCIAL STATEMENT 
The statement on the following pages shows 
that in the work of the International Health 
Board during 1916, a total of $503,349.74 was 
expended. This statement is based on expendi- 
tures actually made during the calendar year 
1916, regardless of when financial reports were 
received at the New York office. It will be 
seen that the figures differ from those given in 
the Treasurer’s statement, pages 358 to 359. 
The Treasurer’s report includes amounts paid 
in the field during the first three quarters of 
1916, to which in many instances have been 
added amounts paid during the fourth quarter 
of 1915 but not recorded until early in 1916. 
This discrepancy between the two reports is 
caused by the necessity of closing the Treasurer’s 
books shortly after the first of the calendar year, 
before detailed financial reports can be received 
from the foreign countries in which a large part 
of the work of the International Health Board 
is conducted.

In interpreting the statistics included in the 
reports for the separate countries (see Chapter 
II), the following explanations may be helpful: 
1. For Guatemala, Nicaragua, Panama, and 
Salvador the figures represent the total results 
accomplished up to December 31, 1916, in both 
completed and uncompleted areas. 
2. For the countries except Guatemala, Nica- 
ragua, Panama, and Salvador, the figures relate 
only to the results accomplished in areas in which 
the work had been completed by December 31, 
1916. This should be borne in mind when the 
results of one year with another are compared. 
3. The figures given in this report under the 
heading of “Prior to 1916” do not always agree 
with the figures published in the second annual 
report under the heading “Up to December 31, 
1915.” This is due in part to a change in the 
method of reporting which went into effect 
during 1916, and in part to a revision of figures 
which was undertaken in certain countries. 
4. In interpreting the figures relating to the 
number of persons found infected, the technique 
of examination is an important consideration. 
In the various states and countries, different 
techniques, all directed to the same end, are in 
use, but all are not equally accurate or reliable. 
The following summary offers, in succinct form, 
277 
 
-P-A-G-E-278
  278 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 
a comparison of the methods used in examining 
specimens. It indicates whether or not the 
centrifuge is used, and the maximum number of 
slides for the microscope which are prepared 
from each specimen:

5. The number of persons cured is based 
upon the number previously infected in whose 
feces no ova could be detected on re-examination 
following the last treatment. In considering 
these figures it should be borne in mind that in 
practically all dispensary work, and to a more 
limited extent in the intensive work in the 
Southern States, re-examinations for determining 
1The countries omitted from this summary have not reported the 
methods being used in examining specimens, 
2 In Grenada this technique has been used only since August 26, 1916. 
3 The centrifuge is not used. 
4 Tf the patient appears to be clinically infected, and all three slides are 
negative, another specimen is taken. 
5In Nicaragua the use of the centrifuge was begun in the central 
office during the third quarter of the year, and it is proposed to use this 
method of examination exclusively in the work to be conducted during 
1917. When the centrifuge is used, four specimens are examined, two 
before and two after centrifuging. 
 
-P-A-G-E-279
  ADDENDA 279 
whether cures have been effected are lacking. 
In work by these methods, all persons reported 
as “Given First Treatment” receive one or 
more treatments, and as a result a large majority 
of them are doubtless much benefited in health 
if not actually cured; there may be some, how- 
ever, who accept the medicine but either do not 
take it or take it contrary to instructions. It is 
manifestly impossible to correct this error in 
the records. In work conducted by the intensive 
method, the patients actually swallow the 
medicine in the presence of the nurses. 
6. In interpreting the figures relating to cures, 
allowance should be made for the possibility of 
error in examining specimens. In some cases 
a patient may remain infected, but a careful 
search may fail to reveal ova in his stool. The 
number of such cases will depend upon the 
thoroughness of the microscopic technique, but 
in any event will be relatively small and will 
consist mainly of persons who are lightly in- 
fected. For this and for another reason—that 
a certain proportion of the persons who for 
various reasons were not examined were doubt- 
less infected—the actual number of persons 
remaining in the areas uncured at the close of 
work will probably be greater in every instance 
than the tables show. 
7. In figuring the percentage of persons re- 
maining in the areas uncured at the close of 
work, the original number of infected persons
-P-A-G-E-280
280 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH BOARD 
and not the total population of the areas has 
been taken as the base. If the figures for the 
total population were used as the basis of cal- 
culation, the percentage of persons remaining 
uncured would be considerably lower, but in 
order to arrive at such a percentage figure it 
would be necessary to take into consideration 
a number of estimated factors. 
8. In the tables exhibiting the detailed results 
of work by the intensive method, the terms 
“Not Treated tor Medical Reasons” and “Not 
Cured for Medical Reasons” relate to very 
old or emaciated persons, pregnant women, or 
sufferers from acute heart or kidney disease, 
typhoid fever, malaria, dysentery, and diarrhea. 
To administer treatment for hookworm disease 
to these persons might cause serious complica- 
tions and possibly death. Consequently the 
treatment is spoken of as withheld for medical 
reasons. 
9. Persons who have taken one or more treat- 
ments for hookworm disease, but have abandoned 
treatment before being cured, are classed as 
“Refused.” These persons may be divided 
into two groups: those who refuse to accept 
even the first treatment, and those who accept 
one or more treatments but do not continue 
treatment until cured. Persons who die within 
the areas of operation while the work is in 
progress are included in the table as ““Removed” 
from the areas.

STATEMENT OF THE PURPOSES AND 
PLANS OF THE CHINA MEDICAL 
BOARD 
In creating the China Medical Board, it was 
the aim of the Rockefeller Foundation to pro- 
mote the gradual and orderly development of a 
comprehensive and efficient system of medicine 
in China. For a long time the Foundation had 
been considering the need of scientific medicine . 
in China, and in 1914 a Commission was sent 
out, consisting of Harry Pratt Judson, President 
of the University of Chicago; Francis W. Pea- 
body, M.D., of the Harvard Medical School, 
Boston; and Roger S. Greene, at that time 
Consul General of the United States at Hankow, 
now Resident Director in China of the China 
Medical Board. This Commission visited the 
several medical schools in China and a large 
number of hospitals, missionary and other, and 
upon its return to the United States made a 
detailed report to the Foundation.1 This report 
contained a series of recommendations which 
were adopted by the Foundation as a working 
basis, subject to such changes as experience and 
further knowledge might invite. In addition to 
this, the Foundation had at its disposal valuable 
material collected by the Oriental Educational 
Commission, composed of Dr. Ernest D. Burton 
1 This has been published under the title “Medicine in China,” and 
will be sent to any address on application.

288 CHINA MEDICAL BOARD 
and Dr. Thomas C. Chamberlin, who were sent 
out by the University of Chicago in 1909 to 
study general educational conditions in the East. 
Late in 1914 the Rockefeller Foundation created 
the China Medical Board, which held its first 
meeting on December 11, 1914, to effect an 
organization. A report covering the ‘activities 
of the China Medical Board for the year ended 
December 31, 1915, has been published and will 
be sent on request to any address. 
Realizing the importance and value of the 
work the medical missionaries are doing for the 
people of China, the China Medical Board has 
endeavored to co-operate sympathetically with 
the several missionary societies in strengthening 
their medical schools and hospitals. To this end 
the Board has made grants in aid for equipment 
and other facilities in a limited number of hos- 
pitals and at two medical schools, and has also 
made grants in aid for the support of foreign 
trained physicians and nurses on their staffs. 
A number of fellowships have been granted to 
doctors and nurses, both foreign and Chinese, 
for graduate study in this country. 
The main work of the Board, however, will be 
the founding of two medical schools, one at 
Peking and another at Shanghai, which shall be 
of the same grade and character as the better 
medical schools of the United States and Europe. 
During the year 1916 five meetings of the 
China Medical Board have been held as follows:
-P-A-G-E-289
  PURPOSES AND PLANS OF THE BOARD 239 
January 28, April 6, May 26, October 24, and 
December 22. The Executive Committee has 
held thirteen meetings as follows: January 21, 
February 29, March 7, March 27, April 25, June 
12, June 16, June 29, July 10, September 29, 
October 5, November 20, and December 26. 
On January 26, the Rockefeller Foundation 
elected Dr. Frederick L. Gates and Mr. Roger 
S. Greene members of the China Medical Board, 
the former to serve until the annual meeting of 
1918, and the latter until the annual meeting of 
1919. 
For convenience the work of the China Medi- 
cal Board may be classified as follows: I. Medi- 
cal Education; II. Aid to Missionary Hospitals; 
III. Fellowships and Scholarships.

  I. MEDICAL EDUCATION 
1. THE PEKING UNION MEDICAL COLLEGE 
A. ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE TRUSTEES OF THE PEKING 
UNION MEDICAL COLLEGE 
First Meeting 
The first meeting of the Trustees of the Peking 
Union Medical College was held on January 24, 
1916, when the following officers were elected: 
Chairman, John R. Mott; Vice-Chairman, James 
L. Barton; Secretary, Wallace Buttrick; Execu- 
tive Committee: Frederick T. Gates, Chairman, 
Arthur J. Brown, Wallace Buttrick, Simon 
Flexner, Frank Mason North. None of the 
English trustees were present; they were repre- 
sented, however, by Dr. Thomas Cochrane, 
President Emeritus of the Union Medical College 
of Peking who held proxies for Mr. Hawkins 
and Mr. Wenham, and by Dr. William H. 
Jefferys of Philadelphia and formerly connected 
with St. Luke’s Hospital, Shanghai, who held 
the proxy of Dr. Armitage. 
Present Students of the Union Medical College 
At this meeting Dr. Welch, of the Commis- 
sion sent to China in 1915, read from the report 
and recommendations of the Commission the 
section relating to the Union Medical College. 
After discussion, the Trustees decided that no 
new students should be admitted to the institu- 
tion in the fall of 1916, and that the students of 
290
-P-A-G-E-291
     PEKING UNION MEDICAL COLLEGE 291 
the first, second and preparatory classes should 
be transferred to the Union Medical College at 
Tsinanfu, Shantung Province, for the comple- 
tion of their medical training, provided the 
Chinese government would confirm the diplo- 
mas of students so educated upon examination 
by the members of the Peking faculty. Later 
the Chinese government consented to this 
arrangement and the plan has been carried out 
to the satisfaction of all the parties interested. 
The two upper classes are completing their 
clinical work at Peking. 
Committee of Control 
Pending the opening of the reorganized col- 
lege, a Committee of Control was appointed to 
administer the local affairs of the college, con- 
sisting of Mr. Roger S. Greene, Resident Direc- 
tor in China of the China Medical Board, Dr. 
Charles W. Young, Dean of the College, and 
Dr. Edward J. Stuckey, a member of the faculty. 
Language 
At this same meeting, the English language 
was determined upon as the medium of instruc- 
tion, and it was decided that while a knowledge 
of the Chinese language would undoubtedly be 
valuable, it will not be required of all members ~ 
of the faculty. These actions were in accordance 
with the recommendation of the China Medical 
Commission, which may be found on page 91 of 
“Medicine in China.” !

  292 CHINA a BOARD 
Organization 
At the first annual meeting of the Trustees of 
the Peking Union Medical College held on May 
23, 1916, organization was effected under a 
provisional charter granted by the Regents of 
the University of the State of New York, by- 
laws were adopted, and the lease of the property 
from the China Medical Board was accepted as 
contemplated in the memorandum of agreement 
with the London Missionary Society made in 
1915. At this meeting it was our pleasure to 
welcome Mr. F. H. Hawkins, Secretary of the 
London Missionary Society, who represents that 
Society as trustee, and Dr. R. Fletcher Moors- 
head of the Baptist Missionary Society (Eng- 
land), who held the proxy of Mr. Arthur Wen- 
ham of the London Medical Missionary Asso- 
ciation. e officers chosen at the meeting of 
January 2%, enumerated in the first paragraph of 
this section, were unanimously re-elected. It was 
decided to hold the annual meeting of the Trustees 
on the second Wednesday of April in each year. 
Appointment of Executive Head 
On June 20, 1916, the Executive Committee 
of the Peking Trustees elected Franklin C. 
McLean, Ph.D., M.D., of the Rockefeller Insti- 
tute Hospital, Professor of Medicine and Physi- 
cian-in-Chief. Dr. McLean visited China and 
made a careful study of the situation there, 
returning in October, when he submitted a 
report of his findings and recommendations.
-P-A-G-E-293
PEKING UNION MEDICAL COLLEGE 293 
Premedical School 
At the meeting of the Executive Committee 
held December 20, it was decided to open a 
Premedical School at Peking in September, 1917. 
Students in preparatory schools and colleges in 
China at the present time are not receiving 
sufficient instruction in science to enable them 
to undertake work in a high grade medical 
school. The Board, therefore, faced the dilemma 
of either aiding a number of colleges to strengthen 
their scientific departments, or of creating a 
school of its own. After careful consideration, 
the conclusion was reached that for the present 
it will be necessary to conduct a premedical 
school in connection with the Peking Union 
Medical College. This, however, is considered a 
temporary arrangement, and it is hoped that 
within a few years the colleges of North China 
will be able so to advance their courses in science 
as to prepare students for the medical school. 
Meetings 
The Board of Trustees has held two meetings, 
on January 24, and on May 23. The Executive 
Committee has met twice, on June 20, and on 
December 20.

B. ACTIONS OF THE CHINA MEDICAL BOARD AFFECT- ING THE PEKING UNION MEDICAL COLLEGE 
In furtherance of the action of the Peking 
Trustees in sending the first, second, and pre- 
paratory classes of the Peking College to the 
Union Medical College at Tsinanfu to complete 
their education, the China Medical Board on 
March 7 made two substantial appropriations 
to the Tsinanfu Union Medical College: for 
buildings and equipment $50,000, and for main- 
tenance during a period of five years a total 
sum of $100,000, which may be drawn against 
at any time at their discretion. The object of 
this gift was to cover the cost to the Tsinanfu 
Medical College of educating the students sent 
to them by us, and also of the enlargements of 
their plant made necessary for the accommoda- 
tion of these students. The Board also had in 
mind the wish of the China Medical Missionary 
Association to establish a high grade medical 
school to be taught in the Chinese language. 
Land Purchases 
Through the negotiations of Mr. Greene, the 
Resident Director, the Board has acquired the 
palace of Prince Yu, known as the Yu Wang Fu 
property, a tract of over eight acres located . 
about 300 feet from the present medical school 
buildings. On this land the laboratories, out- 
patient department, hospitals, nurses’ home, and 
religious building for the reorganized medical
-P-A-G-E-295
  SHANGHAI MEDICAL SCHOOL 295 
school will be constructed. Mr. Greene has also 
purchased some small parcels of land adjacent 
to the Ying property, and a considerable tract 
adjoining the present hospital. 
Architects 
Mr. Charles A. Coolidge, head of the firm of 
Coolidge & Shattuck, Boston, was engaged as 
consulting architect. He visited China and made 
careful study of our architectural problems, 
returning to this country in October when he 
made a full report of his conclusions and recom- 
mendations. 
On December 22 the Executive Committee 
requested Mr. Harry Hussey, of the firm of 
Shattuck & Hussey, architects, of Chicago, who 
has had considerable experience in building in 
China, to prepare plans and recommendations 
for buildings at Peking. Mr. Hussey, with the 
co-operation of Mr. Coolidge, prepared ten- 
tative plans for the consideration of the China 
Medical Board, and was later instructed to 
make permanent plans. 
2. THE SHANGHAI MEDICAL SCHOOL 
At its meeting held April 6, 1916, the China 
Medical Board formally voted to establish a 
medical school at Shanghai. On April 11, the 
Rockefeller Foundation approved this action 
and designated funds in sufficient amount to 
provide the plant and maintain the school. The 
following persons have been selected as Trustees

8. RED CROSS HOSPITAL, SHANGHAI 
Until July of 1916 the Harvard Medical School 
of China conducted its school in the laboratories 
and hospital owned by the central committee 
of the Chinese Red Cross Society. When the 
Harvard Medical School closed its work in July, 
1916, the China Medical Board assumed the 
support of the hospital for a period of two years. 
This action insures the maintenance for that 
period of a much needed institution in Shanghai 
and will also afford a place for work to members 
of the staff of the Shanghai Medical School who 
may be sent out before the new buildings have 
been constructed. 
The services of Dr. Henry S. Houghton, 
formerly Dean of the Harvard Medical School 
of China, were engaged by the China Medical 
Board from July 1, 1916. He will have charge 
of the Red Cross Hospital and will co-operate 
with Mr. Greene in directing the Board’s activi- 
ties in China. There were some vacancies in the 
hospital staff, occasioned by the withdrawal of
-P-A-G-E-297
  HUNAN-YALE MEDICAL SCHOOL 297 
teachers of the Harvard School, and the Board 
has sent out on temporary appointment Dr. 
Roger I. Clapp, an eye, ear, nose and throat 
specialist, and Dr. William B. Sharp, an intern- 
ist. 
4. HUNAN-YALE MEDICAL SCHOOL, CHANGSHA 
The China Medical Commission of 1914 rec- 
ommended a grant for a laboratory at the 
Hunan-Yale Medical School in Changsha. An 
application for such a laboratory was presented 
to the Board on October 24, and $30,000 was 
appropriated, of which $25,000 is to be used for 
the building and $5,000 for equipment. 
5. ST. JOHN’S-UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA MEDICAL SCHOOL, SHANGHAI 
As stated in the Report of the Director for 
1915, the St. John’s-University of Pennsyl- 
vania Medical School, the University of Nan- 
king, and the Harvard Medical School of China 
have decided to discontinue their medical work 
because of the China Medical Board’s purpose 
to found a medical school in Shanghai. Pending 
the establishment of the school of the China 
Medical Board, however, the St. John’s-Uni- 
versity of Pennsylvania School continues its 
work. An appropriation of $1,500 has been 
made to the school for the salary of a teacher 
of anatomy.
-P-A-G-E-298
  Il. MISSIONARY HOSPITALS 
In aiding missionary hospitals the Board has 
for its main purpose the desire to co-operate 
with the missionary societies in strengthening 
their valuable work. It has also had in mind 
the needs of future graduates from its medical 
schools. When these graduates leave the medi- 
cal school they will need to spend at least one 
year as internes. It is important, therefore, 
that there shall be a number of well-developed 
hospitals where they can serve interneships. In 
making its appropriations the Board, therefore, 
has sought to select hospitals which are accessi- 
ble from Peking and Shanghai. 
It is also the hope of the China Medical Board 
that when its two medical schools are well 
established, it may be possible for missionary 
doctors to be released from their duties for, say, 
three months every year, to take graduate work 
in one or other of the schools. It is obvious that 
such work in association with other missionary 
doctors and under the general guidance of mem- 
bers of the faculties, will be of great service to 
the physicians who are working in missionary 
hospitals. Such an arrangement would not be 
practicable for hospitals which have but one 
doctor on their staffs. Appropriations for the 
increase of staffs of the hospitals, therefore, serve 
as steps toward the consummation of this larger 
plan.

Five-Year Terms 
On April 6 the Board resolved that as a rule 
its appropriations for the support of medical 
missionaries and nurses, including grants already 
made, should be for periods of five years. 
Conditions of Gifts 
On May 26 the Board took the following action: 
“ Resolved, that hereafter appropriations to hospitals in 
China shall be made only upon the understanding and 
agreement that societies making application shall contrib- 
ute at least one fourth of the total sum desired for increase 
of staff, equipment, or plant.” 
It was the belief of the Board that this policy 
would tend to promote larger contributions from 
churches and individuals and in general stimu- 
late interest in medical missions.

Union Hospitals 
In Nanking several missions have united to 
maintain one general hospital, connected with 
the University of Nanking. This was the hos- 
pital formerly connected with the medical school 
of the University of Nanking which has been 
discontinued because of the proposed China 
Medical Board school soon to be established at 
Shanghai. Toward the general expenses of the 
Union Hospital at Nanking the Board has voted 
to provide for five years the salaries of one 
physician and three nurses, together with the 
further sum of $3,000 a year for maintenance, 
on condition that the missionary societies and 
the University shall provide three physicians, 
one nurse superintendent, and $3,000 a year 
for maintenance during the same period. The 
Board has further contributed $25,000 toward 
$50,000 for buildings and equipment. 
At Huchow the Northern Baptists and South- 
ern Methodists have joined to maintain a Union 
Hospital. They propose to build and equip a 
new hospital plant at a total cost of $48,500, 
toward which sum the China Medical Board has 
subscribed $20,000, payable when a further sum 
of $28,500 shall be secured by the two societies. 
The Board has also pledged a sum averaging 
about $2,000 a year for five years to cover three 
fourths of the cost of one additional foreign 
doctor, one additional foreign nurse and one ad- 
ditional Chinese doctor for this Union Hospital. 
 
-P-A-G-E-301
     MISSIONARY HOSPITALS 301 
To the Canton Christian College a grant of 
$4,500 a year for five years has'been made, of 
which $2,500 is for a business manager in the 
Canton Hospital and the remaining $2,000 for 
the general maintenance of the hospital. This 
hospital, which is supported by the Chinese in 
co-operation with several missionary societies, is 
one of the largest and oldest hospitals in China. 
Details 
The total amount appropriated to these 
mission hospitals for expenditure during the 
year 1916 was $158,502.20, of which $78,704.20 
was for capital expenditure and $79,798 for 
annual maintenance. A further sum _ of 
$271,087 has been pledged for current expenses 
during the next five years, and $20,000 will be 
payable in 1917 on capital account. A detailed 
list of these appropriations for mission hospitals, 
giving the location of hospitals, the organiza- 
tion under whose auspices they are conducted, 
and the amount and specific designation of the 
appropriations will be found in the Treasurer’s 
Report, pp. 364 to 370.

  III. SCHOLARSHIPS AND FELLOWSHIPS 
Medical Missionaries on Furlough 
Twenty-seven medical missionaries on furlough 
from China have received appropriations from 
the China Medical Board during 1916 for grad- 
uate study in the United States. Three of these 
grants have been renewals for a second year of 
work. These missionary physicians have studied 
in various institutions in the United States, 
including the Johns Hopkins Medical School, 
the Harvard Medical School, the Mayo Clinic 
in Rochester, Minnesota, Rush Medical College, 
Chicago, the Massachusetts Eye and Ear In- 
firmary, Manhattan Eye and Ear Hospital, the 
New York Post-Graduate Hospital, the New 
York Polyclinic Hospital, the Skin and Cancer 
Hospital, New York, the Lakeside Hospital, 
Cleveland, the Philadelphia Polyclinic, and the 
New York Presbyterian Hospital. In two in- 
stances a doctor and his wife (in one case a 
nurse and in the other herself a doctor) have 
both been given fellowships. The total amount 
appropriated for payment during 1916 for 
these fellowships was $26,750. The names of 
the missionaries who have received such grants

Among the above named missionaries, seven 
have completed their studies and returned to 
China. 
Fellowships for Chinese Doctors 
In 1914 and 1915 six Chinese doctors were 
carefully chosen from a large number of appli- 
cants and sent to this country for graduate study 
in medicine. One of these, Dr. Li Tsing-meu, 
has returned to China and is working at the 
Peking Union Medical College. The remaining 
five, Drs. Li Tsing-liang, Hsieh En-tseng, Shen 
Szejen, Tsen Tsung-hsien and Peter Kiang 
applied for and were granted fellowships for a 
second year. Appropriations were also made 
for the return of all six to China. Two other 
Chinese physicians, Dr. F. C. Yen of the Hunan- 
Yale Medical School and Dr. Géorge Y. Char of 
the Church General Hospital, Wuchang, have 
also received fellowships during the year. 
Chinese Nurses 
In 1914 five nurses’ scholarships were created. 
Two nurses were appointed to these scholarships 
in 1915, Miss Mildred Wu of Changsha and Miss 
Lillian Wu of Kiukiang, and this year Miss 
Elizabeth Li Sing Sze of Soochow has been 
added to their number. The scholarship for 
Miss Mildred Wu was extended for an additional 
period of three months. 
Chinese Pharmacists 
In 1915 the Board appropriated $3,900 for 
scholarships for three pharmacists, covering the
-P-A-G-E-305
SCHOLARSHIPS AND FELLOWSHIPS 305 
cost of travel to America and return to China, 
together with maintenance for one year. These 
scholarships were not filled until April of this 
year, when Messrs. Cheng Tsung-yi of Peking, 
and How Kyan-tsing and Hsi Yin-dah of Chang- 
sha were appointed, and came to America to 
study at the University of Maryland Medical 
School in Baltimore. Later in the year the 
amount of their stipend was slightly increased, 
because the maintenance allowance was found 
to be inadequate for their needs.

IV. MISCELLANEOUS 
Harvard Medical School of China 
In June, 1916, the Harvard Medical School of 
China closed its work. As already noted, the 
Board took Dr. Houghton, formerly Dean of 
. the Harvard Medical School of China, upon its 
permanent staff. Two former members of the 
Harvard Medical School faculty, Dr. A.’ M. 
Dunlap and Dr. W. S. New, have been granted 
fellowships in this country and are now studying 
at the Harvard Medical School, Boston. 
Pursuant to agreement, the China Medical 
Board is completing the education of selected 
students from the Harvard Medical School of 
China. Six of these students are pursuing their 
studies at the Harvard Medical School, Boston; 
one other will arrive later for study here; and 
six students are pursuing their studies in China. 
The total cost to the Board for completing their 
medical education will be not more than $29,800. 
The students who are working at the Harvard 
Medical School in Boston have the benefit of 
the advice and guidance of Drs. Dunlap and 
New, who are taking graduate work there. 
Translation 
On October 24 a grant of $4,500 for the years 
1916-17 and 1917-18 was made to Dr. P. B. 
Cousland, Secretary of the Publication Com- 
mittee of the China Medical Missionary Asso-

Seven hundred dollars was appropriated as a 
renewal of the grant to the Nurses’ Association 
of China for the translation of nursing textbooks.

        WAR RELIEF COMMISSION 
The War Relief Commission of the Rocke- 
feller Foundation was established, it will be 
remembered, in the latter part of the year 1914. 
The purpose underlying the establishment of 
this Commission was to secure authoritative 
reports of the actual conditions in areas where 
relief measures were required and recommenda- 
tions as to work to be undertaken based upon 
first-hand knowledge of the problems to be met. 
The difficulties experienced by the Founda- 
tion during 1915 in making its relief plans 
effective and in keeping closely in touch with 
conditions in Europe, made it evident that in 
order to achieve satisfactory results in war 
relief activities the War Relief Commission 
should be placed on a more permanent footing 
in Europe. Accordingly, the Director of the 
War Relief Commission, Mr. Warwick Greene, 
accompanied by Mr. William J. Donovan of 
Buffalo and Mr. Reginald C. Foster of Boston, 
sailed for Europe in March, and shortly there- 
after established the headquarters of the Com- 
mission at Berne, Switzerland. 
The War Relief Commission consists of Wick- 
liffe Rose, Chairman, Warwick Greene, Direc- 
tor, and the following members: Ernest P. 
Bicknell; Dr. Hermann M. Biggs; Dwight F. 
Davis; Dr. Alphonse R. Dochez; William J. 
Donovan; Charles H. W. Foster; Reginald C.

An account of the war relief projects initiated 
by the Commission during 1916, and also of 
those to which the Foundation contributed 
directly is given in the following pages.! 
RELIEF OF BELGIAN CHILDREN 
The Rockefeller Foundation received, early in 
July, from Mr. Warwick Greene, an appeal to 
the American public for the relief of about five 
hundred children who were at that time living 
in the fighting zone in that part of Belgium which 
had not been occupied by the German forces. 
Arrangements had already been made, and 
money subscribed from Swiss sources, for the 
removal of seven hundred and sixty children 
who had been similarly situated to the canton 
of Fribourg in Switzerland, where provision was 
made for their protection, maintenance, and 
education under the direction of Baroness de 
Montenach, President, and Mlle. Clément, Vice- 
President of the International Young Girls’ 
Protection Society. 
From a careful investigation of this work it 
had appeared to be carried on in an efficient, 
economical and sympathetic manner. When 
the needs of five hundred additional children

found in Appendix VI, pp. 428-431. 
 
-P-A-G-E-315
     RELIEF OF BELGIAN CHILDREN 315 
were brought to the attention of those in Swit- 
zerland who had been interested in the matter, 
it became apparent that their already over- 
taxed resources were unequal to this new de- 
mand. The Queen of the Belgians then asked 
that an appeal be transmitted to America. 
Upon the receipt of this appeal the Rocke- 
feller Foundation took the matter up with the 
Belgian Relief Fund of New York and the New 
England Belgian Relief Fund of Boston, and 
received immediate assurances of co-operation. 
The cost of taking care of the additional five 
hundred children in the manner suggested had 
been estimated at $73,000 for the first year, or 
a cost of forty cents per capita per day. In case 
the prolongation of the war should necessitate 
continued provision for these children, the cost 
for the second year was expected to be $51,000, 
or twenty-eight cents per capita per day. 
In order that the removal of the children 
might not be unnecessarily delayed, the Rocke- 
feller Foundation instructed the Director of the 
War Relief Commission to authorize their 
removal from Belgium and guaranteed the cost 
of carrying out the plan for their maintenance 
in Switzerland. Toward the necessary cost for 
the first year the Belgian Relief Fund of New 
York City appropriated $25,000; the New Eng- 
land Belgian Relief Committee appropriated 
$10,000, and the Refugees Relief Fund appro- 
priated $3,000.
-P-A-G-E-316
  316 WAR RELIEF COMMISSION 
Acting under this authority from the Founda- 
tion, the Director of the War Relief Commis- 
sion entered into an agreement with the Comité 
Central Suisse de Secours aux Refugiés Belges, 
whose activities included the transportation of 
Belgian children to Switzerland. The arrange- 
ment was consummated in detail with the sub- 
committee at Fribourg. Following the com- 
pletion of the arrangements between the War 
Relief Commission and the Comité Suisse de 
Secours, the ladies of the committee busied 
themselves with preparations for the coming of 
the children. Baroness de Montenach and Mlle. 
Clément found four buildings suitable to the 
reception of the children—three at Fribourg and 
one at Vaulruz near Brulle, about thirty miles 
from Fribourg. The building at Vaulruz is the 
historic Chateau de Vaulruz, which now belongs 
to the state. The state has made no charge for 
the use of the building. The buildings were 
rapidly adapted to their new purpose. Furni- 
ture was purchased and clothing prepared. The 
sharp advance in the prices of food and other 
supplies made it very difficult to keep within the 
estimated expense. The committee was greatly 
aided to this end by some fifty women of Fri- 
bourg and Vaulruz, who worked voluntarily for 
two months sewing the wearing apparel and bed 
clothing for the children. 
The first contingent of Belgian children to be 
hospitalized in Switzerland under the grant of
-P-A-G-E-317
RELIEF OF BELGIAN CHILDREN 317 
the Rockefeller Foundation arrived on Septem- 
ber 20. There were 75 children in all—382 girls, 
43 boys. They were first taken to Lausanne, 
where many of the women met them at the rail- 
road station to give them affectionate welcome, 
and to care for them on their way to the hospital 
where they were clothed with the garments 
which had been sent down from Fribourg and 
Vaulruz. The doctors and nurses at the hospital 
spent the day in examining and vaccinating 
them. All of this was voluntary service. In the 
evening they were taken on; the girls to Fribourg 
and the boys to Vaulruz. The children were 
most of them from five to six years of age, 
though one was as young as two years and 
another, who had been the mother to the whole 
party and of inestimable value on the journey, 
was sixteen years of age. 
On account of the difficulty of mail communi- 
cation only fragmentary reports have come to 
hand concerning the Belgian children brought 
into Switzerland under the Foundation’s guar- 
antee. It is probable that about 200 have been 
received up to the present time. A member of 
the Commission saw some of the children in the 
latter part of November, and also inspected 
their living quarters. He reports that the cloth- 
ing provided is amply warm and serviceable, 
and that the children are comfortably housed 
and well managed. Photographs are appended 
of some of the Belgian children, of the building
-P-A-G-E-318

in which they are housed and of one of the dor- 
mitories in the building (pages 335 to 338). 
STIPENDS FOR BELGIAN PROFESSORS 
The grant made by the Foundation to pro- 
vide stipends for Belgian professors of scientific 
subjects who are refugees in England was con- 
tinued throughout 1916, $15,000 being appro- 
priated for that purpose. 
POLAND 
Throughout the year the War Relief Com- 
mission in co-operation with the Commission 
for Relief in Belgium made every effort to bring 
about an agreement between the belligerent 
countries whereby foodstuffs and other supplies 
might be brought into Poland and distributed 
to the distressed population by representatives 
of neutral countries. Mr. Frederic C. Walcott, 
a member of the firm of William P. Bonbright 
& Company, in company with Mr. Caspar 
Whitney of the Commission for Relief in Bel- 
gium, visited Poland on behalf of the Rocke- 
feller Foundation. They found conditions of 
indescribable misery and suffering which had 
been steadily growing worse since the wholesale 
devastation of factories, homes and crops in the 
fall of 1915. Mr. Walcott and Mr. Whitney 
were able to negotiate a tentative agreement 
with officials of the German government cover- 
ing the importation of food and supplies into 
Poland. Upon returning to England, Mr. Wal-
-P-A-G-E-319
  POLAND 819 
cott and Mr. Herbert C. Hoover, Chairman of 
the Commission for Relief in Belgium, took up 
the matter of the relief of the Polish population 
with the British government. The Director of 
the War Relief Commission subsequently took 
Mr. Walcott’s place in the negotiations, Mr. Wal- 
cott being obliged to return to the United States. 
The Trustees of the Rockefeller Foundation 
at their meeting of May 24, 1916, seconded the 
efforts being made to assure relief for Poland by 
appropriating the sum of $1,000,000 for relief in 
Poland, Serbia, Montenegro and Albania. It 
was thought probable that the Balkan countries 
could be included in any arrangement covering 
the importation of supplies into territory occu- 
pied by the Central Powers, which made it 
seem desirable to make provision for them in 
this appropriation. 
While Mr. Hoover and Mr. Greene were suc- 
cessful in securing from the British government 
a statement of the conditions upon which they 
would allow food and other supplies to be sent 
into Poland, it ultimately proved to be impossi- 
ble to reconcile the conflicting stipulations of 
Great Britain and Germany with respect to this 
undertaking. 
The failure of the general plan of relief for the 
Polish people did not cause the members of the 
War Relief Commission to relax their efforts in 
behalf of that afflicted population. On the con- 
trary, they pushed forward with increased energy
-P-A-G-E-320
  320 WAR RELIEF COMMISSION 
the development of certain special relief enter- 
prises, which while only slightly mitigating the 
general misery and suffering, nevertheless offered 
distinct opportunities to save many thousands 
of lives. 
In the latter part of September the Commis- 
sion was able to purchase one hundred and ten 
tons of condensed milk in Switzerland and to 
secure permission to ship it to Poland. Eighty 
tons of the condensed milk were shipped to 
Warsaw and thirty tons to Lodz. Mr. Reginald 
C. Foster, a member of the War Relief Com- 
mission, conducted with officials of the Swiss 
and German governments the negotiations con- 
cerning the shipments of milk into Poland and 
gave the necessary guarantees concerning its 
proper distribution. By permission of the Ger- 
man government he visited Warsaw and Lodz 
late in October, and made arrangements with 
the local officials and representatives of relief 
societies in each city for controlling the appor- 
tionment and distribution of the milk supply. 
In Warsaw, Mr. Foster found the relief work 
well organized. The city, with a population of 
900,000, had been divided for the purposes of 
relief work into twenty-six districts. Each of 
these districts was a complete unit containing 
five soup kitchens in which over 120,000 por- 
tions of a wholesome vegetable meat soup with 
a piece of bread was given daily; institutions for 
the care of children, such as asylums for orphans
-P-A-G-E-321
     POLAND 321 
and day nurseries where working parents might 
leave their children during the day, and sta- 
tions for the distribution of milk to the infants. 
In each district also was a medical unit which 
examined and cared for the poor. 
Using this method of distribution as a basis, 
a Rockefeller Warschauer Hilfsausschuss (Rocke- 
feller Warsaw Relief Commission) was formed, 
combining the heads of the various departments 
and committees already engaged in relief work 
in the city. The names of the members of the 
Commission follow: 
Prince Lubomirski, mayor of the city. 
Mr. Leon Goldstand, representing Prince Lubomirski. 
Mr. Hernando de Soto, American Consul. 
Mr. Witold Fuchs, American Vice-Consul. 
Mr. Geisler, head of the Children’s Relief Committee. 
Mr. Hirzel, head of the soup kitchens. 
Mr. Przanowski, representative of the Deutscher Lebens- 
mittelsekt. 
Mr. S. Natanson, Jewish representative. 
Mr. R. C. Foster, Rockefeller War Relief Commission. 
With the exception of the American Consul 
and the representative of the War Relief Com- 
mission the members named above are all Poles. 
In order to safeguard the distribution of the 
condensed milk the Rockefeller Warschauer 
Hilfsausschuss was directed to observe the fol- 
lowing instructions: 
The milk is intended only for Polish children. 
It is to be distributed without regard to religious faith. 
It is primarily for children up to three years of age and 
is intended to supplement whatever quantities of fresh 
milk the various local committees can obtain.     
  
-P-A-G-E-322
  $22 WAR RELIEF COMMISSION 
The quantity shall be distributed equally over the 
thirty days of the month. 
The milk shall be given out only in prepared form, 
employing day nurseries and other institutions wherever 
possible so as to assure that only children receive it. 
The empty tins shall be checked by the representatives 
of the Rockefeller Warschauer Hilfsausschuss, which in 
turn will turn them over to some organization employing 
the destitute in making various saleable articles from this 
metal. 
Substantially the same arrangements for dis- 
tributing the milk were made by Mr. Foster at 
Lodz. The distribution of the milk began about 
November 15. All told a sufficient quantity of 
condensed milk was shipped to Warsaw and 
Lodz to feed approximately 16,000 children 
daily. It was estimated that the total supply 
imported would last until the middle of January. 
In connection with his visit to Warsaw and 
Lodz, Mr. Foster found the need for clothing to 
be very immediate in those cities and learned 
that a similar condition existed in the other 
large centers of Poland. Men, women, and 
children were walking the streets without shoes 
or stockings and in rags that provided small 
protection against the cold of the winter. Know- 
ing that from time to time the American Relief 
Clearing House in Paris received large shipments 
of new and second-hand clothing, Mr. Foster 
appealed to that organization for help. At the 
same time he caused the need for clothing to be 
brought to the attention of the Polish Relief 
Committee in London and the Commission for 
 
-P-A-G-E-323
SERBIA 323 
Relief in Belgium. Learning also of the possi- 
bility of purchasing odd lots of clothing, cloth, 
shoes and stockings in Switzerland, Mr. Foster 
asked the Foundation to appropriate one hun- 
dred thousand dollars to take advantage of such 
opportunities. The amount requested by Mr. 
Foster was promptly sent to him by the Founda- 
tion. 
Mr. Foster was able to purchase in Berlin in 
the fall some forty-five tons of cocoa, which, 
although not of the usual nutritive standard, 
contained sufficient food value to make it of use 
for the destitute in Poland. The cocoa was 
distributed in Warsaw and Lodz through the 
committees already organized for distributing 
condensed milk. 
SERBIA 
The invasion of Serbia by the Central Powers 
in the fall of 1915 created conditions of extreme 
distress among the civilian population. Hun- 
dreds of thousands of the people fled before the 
invading armies, and it is estimated that fully 
fifty per cent of these refugees succumbed to 
exposure, disease and hunger. 
Following the conquest of Serbia, the control 
of her territory was divided between Austria 
and Bulgaria. Mr. Edward Stuart, of the Ameri- 
can Red Cross, who had charge of relief activities 
in Serbia for that organization, exerted himself 
vigorously to negotiate agreements with the
-P-A-G-E-324
  324 WAR RELIEF COMMISSION 
Austrian and Bulgarian governments whereby 
effective relief work might be conducted in 
Serbia. 
Early in January, the Rockefeller Founda- 
tion contributed $15,000 to the American Red 
Cross to be sent to Mr. Stuart for the purchase 
of supplies, Mr. Stuart at that time expecting 
to receive permission from Bulgaria to proceed 
with relief work. But the Bulgarian govern- 
ment declined to permit the Red Cross to furnish 
relief in that part of Serbia under its control. 
Mr. Stuart thereupon proceeded to Vienna 
where after extended negotiations he succeeded 
in making satisfactory arrangements with the 
military representatives for relief work in Bel- 
grade. The distribution of food supplies by the 
Red Cross, assisted by a citizens’ committee, 
commenced April 14, 1916. 
Mr. Stuart succeeded also in securing an 
agreement permitting relief work in the interior 
of Serbia, in so far as it was controlled by the 
Austrian authorities. Upon receiving word to 
this effect from Mr. Stuart, the officials of the 
American Red Cross at Washington took steps 
to press forward the transportation to Serbia 
of the supplies which were shipped from New 
York by the steamer Frizos on January 1. These 
supplies had been diverted to the port of Mar- 
seilles where they were stored pending the out- 
come of the negotiations with the Austrian 
government. Dr. Edward W. Ryan, of the Red 
 
-P-A-G-E-325
  
SERBIA 325 
Cross, who had done splendid work in Serbia in 
connection with the typhus epidemic, was in 
France when the arrangements for Serbian relief 
were successfully consummated. Under instruc- 
tions from the Red Cross he arranged with the 
French and Swiss governments for the supplies 
to go forward from Marseilles into the territory 
of the Central Powers. There were about thirty 
carloads of supplies all told. They finally 
reached Belgrade about July 1. 
The relief of the population of Belgrade pro- 
ceeded smoothly under Mr. Stuart’s direction 
during the year. Food was furnished at first to 
about 15,000 persons out of a total population of, 
50,000. This numberincreased steadily until Sep- 
tember, 1916, when approximately 35,000 people 
were receiving relief. In July, 1916, the Founda- 
tion contributed an additional $15,000 to the 
Red Cross for this work. 
The extension of relief work to the interior of 
Serbia was fraught with difficulty. In the 
original agreement with Austria relief work out- 
side of Belgrade was permitted only if supplies 
were furnished from this country. As it was 
impossible to secure the passage of supplies from 
this country to Serbia through the blockade it 
was necessary to secure a modification of the 
agreement permitting the purchase of foodstuffs 
in Roumania. Not until June 1 was the consent 
of the Austrian authorities secured to this change 
in the agreement. With the way open at last
-P-A-G-E-326
326 WAR RELIEF COMMISSION 
for more comprehensive relief operations, plans 
were set afoot to establish an adequate relief 
organization for Serbia. These plans were being 
perfected rapidly when the declaration of war 
against the Central Powers by Roumania put 
a stop to their further consideration by cutting 
off the source of food supply. Dr. Ryan dis- 
tributed in the interior of Serbia, however, the 
supplies brought overland from Marseilles. Mr. 
Stuart had succeeded ‘in having shipped out of 
Roumania before war was declared all of the 
food which he had purchased there for the Ser- 
bians. This good fortune made it possible for 
him to continue his work in Belgrade until 
November 1. 
The Director of the War Relief Commission 
reported in September that the crops in Serbia 
were excellent and would probably be sufficient 
‘to care for the needs of the population even 
though there were no other sources of food sup- 
ply. He stated that there was great need for 
social service work in Serbia such as promoting 
the welfare of infants, caring for the aged and 
orphans, relieving the destitute, acting as an 
agency for the distribution of relief funds sent 
into Serbia by friends and sympathizers of the 
Serbian people. It was proposed to attempt to 
establish in Belgrade a commission charged with 
such duties, but the consent of the Austrian 
government has not yet been secured.

    ARMENIAN AND SYRIAN RELIEF 327 
ARMENIAN AND SYRIAN RELIEF 
During 1916, the Rockefeller Foundation con- 
tributed $490,000 to the American Committee 
for Armenian and Syrian Relief, toward a total 
amount of approximately $2,400,000. The relief 
work which this money has supported is divided 
into three main departments: 
1. The relief of Armenians and other non- 
Moslem inhabitants of that part of Turkey 
which is within the control of the Constantinople 
government. In order to reach the centers of 
need the Committee has relied upon the Ameri- 
can Embassy and upon the American Consuls 
and missionaries in touch with the Embassy. 
2. The region in the Trans-Caucasus around 
Tiflis and such points of Armenia as have been 
brought within reach through Russia by the 
western advance of the Russian forces in Asia 
Minor. A very large refugee movement, amount- 
ing to some hundreds of thousands, took place 
at the time of the Armenian massacres and 
deportations. Relief in this section is adminis- 
tered by an American Committee, of which the 
American Consul, Mr. Felix Willoughby Smith, 
is Chairman. 
8. Northwestern Persia: To this region there 
was a refugee movement consisting chiefly of 
Syrians who were driven out of their houses by 
the Kurds. The numbers suffering want in this 
region have probably been in the neighborhood 
of 60,000. A committee of missionaries, with 
 
-P-A-G-E-328
  328 WAR RELIEF COMMISSION 
the co-operation of American consular officers, 
has administered relief in this section. A report 
received concerning the disbursement of the 
funds sent for use in this region during the sum- 
mer of 1915 indicates that thousands of people 
were kept alive by the expenditure of about a 
cent and a half per day per capita. 
Early in the year the Foundation made a 
small contribution toward the expenses of an 
English expedition to the Trans-Caucasus, Ar- 
menia and Northwestern Persia, for the purpose 
of ascertaining the need and appraising the 
efficiency of the various relief agencies. In the 
report of this committee appears a brief account 
of the work of the American relief agents. 
Mention is made of the emphasis laid by the 
American agents on the importance of encourag- 
ing self-help. To this end assistance was given 
in the form of loans of seed to be repaid in full 
out of the harvest, and loans of oxen at the rate 
of one yoke for three families with a scheme of 
payment beginning after the first year. The 
American Committee also made a special point 
of developing industrial work and employed a 
considerable number of men in gardening, saw- 
ing timber, joinery, etc. It has also assisted 
small tradesmen to re-open their shops for the 
benefit of themselves and the public. 
The energy and devotion with which the 
American missionaries have worked under the 
stress of the past two years have been given at
-P-A-G-E-329
  ARMENIAN AND SYRIAN RELIEF 329 
a grave cost of life and health. During the con- 
gestion of refugees at Urumia, dysentery, typhus, 
and typhoid fever broke out. Many of the mis- 
sionaries fell ill and five died of typhus. 
In the latter part of the year, the American 
Committee for Armenian and Syrian Relief sup- 
plied the cargo for a relief ship, a government 
collier under Red Cross auspices, which sailed 
for Beirut about December 15th. 
The collier reached Alexandria in safety, but 
has been unable to proceed further owing to the 
inability of the Turkish government to furnish 
a safe conduct for the ship to and from Beirut. 
Owing to its increasing support of relief work 
in Turkey, and to the probability that aid would 
be required over a long period of time, the Rocke- 
feller Foundation determined to send a repre- 
sentative to Constantinople to inform himself 
concerning the effectiveness of the various relief 
agencies, and to acquaint himself thoroughly 
with the conditions of destitution and disease. 
In April, Mr. Edward R. Stoever was appointed 
to represent the Rockefeller Foundation in 
Turkey. From 1911 to 1914, Mr. Stoever was 
the engineer in charge of the American Expedi- 
tion to Sardis, where archaeological excavations 
were carried on under the direction of Professor 
Howard Crosby Butler of Princeton University. 
Mr. Stoever reached Constantinople in July. 
Shortly after his arrival he found an opportunity 
to render service apart from his routine duties by
-P-A-G-E-330
  330 WAR RELIEF COMMISSION . 
taking charge of the purchase and distribution 
of supplies for the prisoners of war interned in 
the interior of Turkey. 
In November, in response to Mr. Stoever’s 
cabled recommendation the Foundation appro- 
priated $100,000 to be spent for general relief 
purposes in Constantinople and other parts of 
Turkey. Twenty-five thousand dollars of this 
amount was forwarded at once to Mr. Stoever, 
the balance awaiting further reports from him 
as to the success of his endeavors. 
In March, 1916, the Constantinople chapter 
of the American Red Cross cabled to that organi- 
zation at Washington stating that the Turkish 
government would welcome the co-operation of 
the Red Cross with the Red Crescent in the 
conduct of relief work in Turkey for the civilians 
of all races. The cablegram stated that there 
was great suffering throughout the country, that 
hundreds of thousands needed food, and that 
many were dying of starvation. The Turkish 
government offered satisfactory guarantees cov- 
ering the conduct of the work in Turkey. A 
conference was held of representatives of the 
various organizations doing relief work in Turkey 
and it was decided to send to Constantinople 
$50,000 in response to the appeal. Toward this 
sum the Rockefeller Foundation contributed 
$25,000.

PRISONERS OF WAR WELFARE WORK 331 
PRISONERS OF WAR WELFARE WORK 
The widespread activities of the International 
Committee of Young Men’s Christian Associa- 
tions in military and prisoner-of-war camps in 
the countries on both sides of the present struggle 
have continued to command sympathetic sup- 
port from the Rockefeller Foundation. In 
Europe, Asia, and Africa representatives of the 
International Committee are working tirelessly 
making provision for the physical, mental, and 
moral welfare of the millions of men held as 
prisoners, and also for those comprising the vast 
armies facing each other in the various areas of 
conflict. Toward a total expenditure for welfare 
work in military and prisoner-of-war camps by 
the International Committee of Young Men’s 
Christian Associations during 1916 of approxi- 
mately $900,000 the Rockefeller Foundation con- 
tributed $200,000. 
During the period of their service in Europe 
members of the War Relief Commission devoted 
a considerable part of their time to a thorough- 
going study of the question of welfare work 
among prisoners of war. They observed that 
while a few organizations, such as the Inter- 
national Committee of Young Men’s Christian 
Associations and the International Red Cross at 
Geneva, were doing efficient work for prisoners 
of war sufficiently wide in scope to be of great 
value to all the belligerents, there was unfortu- 
nately a confusion of effort resulting from
-P-A-G-E-332
  332 WAR RELIEF COMMISSION 
attempts made by hundreds of small private and 
semi-private relief associations to aid in caring 
for the interests of the prisoners. It became 
apparent that proper co-ordination of the work 
could be brought about only by the building up 
of a single strong organization which would 
command the attention and respect of the bellig- 
erent powers. 
In the latter part of the year, the Director of 
the War Relief Commission, who had returned 
from Europe to submit a report of the activities 
of the Commission, laid before the Trustees of 
the Foundation plans looking to the formation 
of a commission for the welfare of prisoners of 
war through the co-operation of the Foundation, 
the International Committee of Young Men’s 
Christian Associations, and the International 
Red Cross at Geneva. The Trustees approved 
the plan in substance and authorized the Direc- 
tor of the War Relief Commission to undertake 
the necessary negotiations on behalf of the 
Foundation. Five hundred thousand dollars 
was appropriated to forward the plan if it should 
become effective. The Director of the Com- 
mission sailed for Europe on December 28 to 
initiate the negotiations. 
ROCKEFELLER INSTITUTE FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH 
During the year 1916 the Rockefeller Founda- 
tion continued the support, through the Rocke- 
feller Institute for Medical Research, of the
-P-A-G-E-333
  
ROCKEFELLER INSTITUTE FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH 333 
investigations at the special hospital at Com- 
piégne, France, to the direction of which the 
French Service de Santé had detailed Dr. Alexis 
Carrel. At this hospital Dr. Carrel and his staff 
continued their study of procedures for the 
sterilization and treatment of infected wounds. 
No successful preventive analogous to anti- 
tetanus serum has yet been discovered, nor has 
a prophylaxis been found against gas gangrene 
and the pus organisms with which most wounds 
are contaminated under conditions surrounding 
trench warfare. One of the greatest problems 
of modern war surgery has thus been that of 
sterilizing the already infected wounds. The 
procedures worked out by Dr. Henry D. Dakin 
and Dr. Alexis Carrel have produced excellent 
results. In connection with these studies Dr. 
Carrel and his assistants have also made studies 
on the healing process in wounds. Incidental to 
the work of the Compiégne hospital, studies on 
nervous shock and bacteriological studies of 
the gas organism were carried out by Dr. 
William T. Porter of the Harvard Medical 
School and Dr. J. P. Simonds of the North 
Western University Medical School. The Insti- 
tute has used a part of the appropriation made 
by the Foundation to manufacture and supply 
meningitis serum and anti-dysentery serum to 
the British, French and Italian governments 
for use in their armies and in controlling 
epidemics.

MISCELLANEOUS CONTRIBUTIONS 
In order to make it possible for the Director 
of the War Relief Commission to contribute 
moderate sums of money to meritorious projects, 
where large questions of policy were not involved, 
and where prompt action was desirable, a fund 
of $25,000 was placed at his disposal to be ex- 
pended at his discretion for purposes of relief. 
The following gifts have been made by him from 
this fund.

  TREASURER’S REPORT 
New York, January 1, 1917. 
To the Members of The Rockefeller Foundation: 
Gentlemen: 
Herewith I send you a report of the financial operations 
of the Rockefeller Foundation and its subsidiary organiza- 
tions for the year ending December 31, 1916. 
The income for the year from general funds was $6,226,- 
709.71; the balance from the previous year, after adding 
sundry refunds, was $5,229,300.22; making a total of 
$11,456,009.93 available for disbursement. The sum of 
$6,065,847.99 was disbursed, including $2,535,846.13 on 
account of Mr. Rockefeller’s designations, leaving a balance 
of $5,390,161.94, divided as follows;

The above figures do not take into account pledges 
amounting to $1,284,189.94, payable in 1917, nor $715,- 
050, payable in 1918 and subsequent years. 
The year’s income of $6,226,709.71 is $2,043,625.52 in 
excess of that for the year 1915. This increase is account- 
ed for as follows:

FINANCE COMMITTEE’S REPORT OF TRANSACTIONS RE- 
LATING TO INVESTED FUNDS 
The Finance Committee reports the following transactions relating to 
invested funds, which occurred during the year 1916: 
On January 19, the Executors of the Estate of Laura S. Rockefeller 
made a further gift to the Foundation, consisting of securities, as shown 
in the following tables, having a market value of $49,458.05, and accrued 
dividends of $401.95. 
During March, the Foundation, by reason of its ownership of $1,065,- 
000.00 Erie R.R. convertible 4% bonds, and 21,400 shares Erie R.R. 
first preferred stock, received from the company the privilege of sub- 
scribing to $391,500.00 of its new convertible bonds. This “right” was 
sold and the proceeds credited to the cost of the bonds and stocks on 
account of which it was issued. 
During April, the Foundation received from the National Transit Com- 
pany $1,581,012.50, or $12.50 per share, in cash, representing a distri- 
bution of the assets of the company, thereby reducing the par value of 
the stock from $25.00 to $12.50. The number of shares held by the 
Foundation remains the same (126,481) but the valuation is reduced by 
$12.50 per share. 
During May, the Foundation received from the Cleveland Trust 
Company a further sum of $4,790.04, on account of the liquidation of the 
assets of the Euclid Heights Realty Company. The book value of the 
bonds representing the Foundation’s interest in these assets having been 
already received, this sum was added to Reserve. 
On June 1, the Foundation gave to the General Education Board, from 
the Estate of Laura S. Rockefeller Fund, securities and accrued interest 
amounting to $250,000.00. A list of these securities is given in the 
following pages. 
During June, thirteen hundred and eighty shares of new capital stock 
of the Chesebrough Manufacturing Company were received as a div- 
idend and were added to the 690 shares already held. The total 
of 2,070 shares are now carried at the valuation of the original number. 
On June 28, the Executive Committee adopted a resolution providing 
for the merging, into one general investment account, of the investments 
of the several funds heretofore received, or to be received, with the ex- 
ception of those cases in which the conditions of a gift require the sepa- 
rate investment thereof. In accordance with this action the securities 
received from the Estate of Laura S. Rockefeller have been merged with 
the investments belonging to the General Funds. 
During August eighty-six hundred and ninety-six shares of new capital 
stock of the Standard Oil Company (Ohio) were received as a divi- 
dend and were added to the 8,696 shares already held. The total of 
17,392 shares are now carried at the valuation of the original number. 
During September the Foundation received from the Executors of the 
Estate of Laura S. Rockefeller cash amounting to $37,000.00, as an 
additional gift. 
During October the Receiver of the International Mercantile Marine 
Company was discharged and the administration of the company re- 
sumed by its stockholders. Under a compromise agreement its Inter- 
national Navigation 5% bonds and its International Mercantile Marine
-P-A-G-E-379
  
TREASURER’S REPORT 379 
EXHIBIT L—Continued 
43% bonds were paid off as follows: 57% of the par of the above bonds 
in new collateral 6% bonds and 43% in cash, while all arrears of interest 
were paid in cash. For its holdings of $3,692,000.00 44% bonds and 
$1,305,000.00 5% bonds, the Foundation received $2,848,290.00 in new 
6% bonds and $2,148,710.00 in cash. The new bonds have been given 
a valuation of 97.50%, which was the market value on the day of receipt. 
Arrears of interest amounting to $559,419.03 have been credited to 
Income Account. 
During October, the reorganization of the Western Pacific Railway 
Company having been completed, the Foundation’s holding of $4,039,- 
000.00 first mortgage 5% bonds were exchanged for 20,195 shares of 
Bileted stock and 30,2924 shares of common stock of the new Western 
acific Railroad Company. These stocks were taken into the books at 
their market values on the day of receipt, namely 433% and 154%, re- 
spectively. 
During the month of November the completion of the reorganization 
of the St. Louis & San Francisco Railroad Company resulted in the ex- 
change of the Foundation’s $2,000,000.00 refunding 4% bonds for 
$1,500,000.00 prior lien 4% bonds and $500,000.00 adjustment mortgage 
cumulative 6% bonds of the new St. Louis & San Francisco Railway 
Co. These bonds were taken into the books at their market values on 
the day of receipt, namely, 723% and 81.975% respectively. 
To offset arrears of interest on the refunding bonds above mentioned, 
one year’s interest to July 1,1916, on the two new issues was paid by the 
eompany. The amount received, together with the proceeds of sale of 
coupons representing three interest periods of the refunding bonds, until 
now carried in a suspense account, have been credited to income account. 
The reorganization of the New Orleans, Texas & Mexico Railroad 
Company was consummated during the month of November, and in 
exchange for its holding of $450,000.00 St. Louis & San Francisco, New 
Orleans, Texas & Mexico Division first mortgage 5% bonds, the Founda- 
tion received $180,000.00 5% income bonds and 1,125 shares of the 
capital stock of the New Orleans, Texas & Mexico Railway Company. 
These securities were taken into the books at their market values on the 
day of receipt, namely, 42% and 16% respectively. 
The following tables of sales and purchases state the above transac- 
tions in brief and give the profits and losses on the various securities 
sold, redeemed and exchanged.

APPENDIX I 
CONSTITUTION OF 
THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION! 
ARTICLE I 
Members 
The members of the Corporation shall consist of the 
persons named in the first section of the Act to incorporate 
The Rockefeller Foundation, being Chapter 488 of the 
laws of 1913 of the State of New York, viz.: John D. 
Rockefeller, John D. Rockefeller, Junior, Frederick T. 
Gates, Harry Pratt Judson, Simon Flexner, Starr J. Mur- 
phy, Jerome D. Greene, Wickliffe Rose, and Charles O. 
Heydt, together with such persons as they may associate 
with themselves, and their successors. 
New members, whether as successors to those named 
in the Act of Incorporation or otherwise, and such addi- 
tional members as they or their successors shall see fit to 
associate with them, shall be elected by ballot, either at 
the annual meeting of the Corporation or at a special 
meeting duly called for that purpose, by vote of a majority 
of the members of the Corporation attending such meeting. 
Any member may withdraw from the Corporation by 
a notice in writing to the President or Secretary. The 
members shall be at all times divided into three classes, 
equal numerically, as nearly as may be, and the original 
members shall at their first meeting, or as soon thereafter 
as may be convenient, be divided into three classes, the 
members of the first class to hold their membership and 
office until the first annual meeting, the members of the 
second class until the second annual meeting, and the mem- 
bers of the third class until the third annual meeting, and 
1The amendments to the Constitution which have been adopted during 
1916 are shown in italics.

-P-A-G-E-398
  398 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
in every case the member shall hold office after the expi- 
ration of his term until his successor shall be chosen. At 
each annual meeting the successors to those members 
whose terms of office then expire shall be chosen for the 
term of three years and until their successors shall be 
chosen. In case any member shall by death, resignation, 
incapacity to act, or otherwise, cease to be a member dur- 
ing his term, his successor shall be chosen to serve for the 
remainder of his term and until his successor shall be 
chosen. If and when the number of members shall be less 
than nine, the members remaining shall have power to 
add, and shall add to their number, until the number shall 
be not less than nine, but no act of the Corporation shall be 
void because at the time such act shall be done the mem- 
bers of the Corporation shall be less than nine. 
All the powers of the Corporation shall be exercised by 
its members, and they may, by general resolution, subject 
to the provisions of this Constitution and the By-Laws to 
be adopted, delegate to other officers or to committees of 
their own number such powers as they may see fit, in addi- 
tion to the powers specified in this Constitution and in 
such By-Laws. 
ARTICLE I 
Quorum 
A majority of the members of the Corporation shall con- 
stitute a quorum for the transaction of business at meet- 
ings of the Corporation. 
ARTICLE III 
Trustees 
The number of trustees by whom the business and affairs 
of the Corporation shall be managed shall be the same as 
the number of members, and all of the members of the 
Corporation shall be its trustees, and the election of any 
person as a member of the Corporation shall constitute 
him a trustee.
-P-A-G-E-399
  CONSTITUTION OF ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 399 
ARTICLE IV 
Officers 
The officers of the Corporation shall consist of a Presi- 
dent, Secretary, Treasurer and Comptroller, together with 
such other officers as may be determined by the By-Laws. 
These officers shall have the duties and exercise the powers 
assigned to them by this Constitution or by the By-Laws, 
or by resolutions adopted pursuant to the authority of this 
Constitution or the By-Laws. At each annual meeting 
of the Corporation or, in default of election at such meet- 
ing, then at an adjournment thereof, or at any meeting 
duly called for that purpose, the Corporation shall elect by 
ballot a President, Secretary, Treasurer and Compiroller, 
and it may choose such other officers as the By-Laws shall 
from time to time provide. All the officers, whether 
elected or appointed, shall hold office at the pleasure of the 
Corporation, but in no case beyond the time when their 
respective successors shall be elected and accept office. 
ARTICLE V 
President 
The President shall sustain an executive and advisory 
relation to the work and policies of the Corporation similar

her will to apply her residuary estate to such charitable 
corporations as they might select, selected the Rockefeller 
Foundation to be the recipient of the residue of the estate 
after making provision for certain other charitable cor- 
porations. 
Pending the adjudication of the question whether the 
legacies to charitable corporations are taxable under the 
transfer tax law, the executors have reserved a portion of 
the estate to cover that point. The question has now been 
passed upon by the Transfer Tax Appraiser, and on appeal 
from his decision by the Surrogate, both of whom have 
held that the legacies are not taxable. The State Comp- 
troller still has the right of appeal from the decision of the 
Surrogate, but the executors are of opinion that it is 
highly probable that if the appeal is taken the decision of 
the Surrogate will be sustained. 
As the Foundation is entitled to whatever residue there 
may be, the effect of a decision that the legacies are tax- 
able would simply be to reduce the amount which the 
Foundation would receive. In view of the probability 
that the tax will not be imposed, the executors are willing 
now to pay over to the Foundation $37,000 of the cash 
balance in their hands, with the understanding that if it is 
finally adjudicated that the estate is taxable or that in 
any other way the executors are subjected to liability by 
reason of paying over this money, the Foundation will to 
the extent of this payment hold them harmless, and will 
either discharge such liabilities itself or reimburse them for 
any sums that they may have been obliged to pay. 
Upon receipt of advices that this suggestion is approved 
by you we shall be happy to make the payment at once.

   APPENDIX V 
The following report, prepared by Dr. William H. Welch 
and Mr. Wickliffe Rose, was presented to the Trustees at 
their meeting in January, 1916. 
January 12, 1916. 
INSTITUTE OF HYGIENE 
At a conference! on training for public health service 
held at the offices of the General Education Board in New 
York on October 16, 1914, discussion seemed to develop 
substantial agreement on the following points: (1) that 
a fundamental need in the public health service in this 
country at the present time is of men adequately trained 
for the work; (2) that a distinct contribution toward meet- 
ing this need could be made by establishing at some con- 
venient place a school of public health of high standard; 
(3) that such an institution, while maintaining its separate 
identity, should in the interest both of economy and of 
efficiency be closely affiliated with a university and its 
medical school; (4) that the nucleus of this school of 
public health should be an institute of hygiene. 
Mr. Rose and Dr. Welch were asked to formulate a plan 
for such an institute of hygiene and in compliance with 
this request offer the following report, which is designed to 
set forth the scope and general character of organization 
of the institute and the service which it should render in 
training in hygiene, preventive medicine and public health 
and in the advancement of these subjects. If desired, the

I. PUBLIC HEALTH AND HYGIENE IN ENGLAND AND IN 
GERMANY 
The origins of the modern public health movement and 
of the cultivation of hygiene as an independent science 
may be found especially in the passage of the Public 
Health Act in England in 1848 and in the establishment of 
the first hygienic institute by von Pettenkofer in Munich 
in 1865. The greatest stimulus to further development 
came from the discoveries relating to the causation and 
mode of spread of the infectious diseases and the conse- 
quent vastly increased power to control these diseases. 
It is instructive for the present purpose to note the differ- 
ent conceptions and directions of development in this 
field in the two countries. In Germany every university 
has its department or institute of hygiene, conducted by 
a professor and corps of assistants, where the subject is 
represented broadly in all its varied aspects, students are 
taught by lectures, laboratory courses and field work, 
and the science is advanced by research. In England, on 
the other hand, the important hygienic laboratories are 
few and mostly governmental or independent. For train- 
ing the emphasis is laid upon public health administration, 
in which respect Great Britain leads the world. Those 
desiring to qualify as medical officers of health must pos- 
sess the diploma in public health, obtained by passing an 
examination after at least nine months of special prepara- 
tion, most frequently under a qualified medical officer of 
health and in a hospital for infectious diseases. It seems 
obvious that lessons are to be learned from both the Ger- 
man and the English systems, and that the ideal plan will 
give due weight to both the scientific and the practical 
aspects of hygiene and public health.
-P-A-G-E-417
  INSTITUTE OF HYGIENE 417 
Il. THE SITUATION AND THE NEEDS IN AMERICA 
In this country we are wofully lacking both in labora- 
tories of hygiene and in opportunities for training in 
public health work. Three or four medical schools have 
hygienic laboratories, but none is complete, and adequately 
equipped and supported. Still other schools attempt 
something in the way of instruction in this subject, but it 
is all inadequate and unsatisfactory. 
The need for supplying these deficiencies is at present 
the most urgent one in medical education and in public 
health work, and is recognized on all sides. The cry comes 
loudest from public health officials, social workers and 
others interested in public health administration, national, 
state, municipal and rural, who realize the lack of trained 
leaders and trained workers in all grades of the service. 
Here with the rapidly growing appreciation of efficient 
public health organization new and promising careers of 
useful service are opening for those who are qualified by 
ability, character and training. Scarcely less important 
is it for medical students and physicians who engage in 
practice to be well grounded in the principles of hygiene 
and of preventive medicine. Furthermore, the advance- 
ment of knowledge in this field, the cultivation of hygiene 
as a science, is one of the great needs of this country and 
should be a fundamental aim of an institute of hygiene. 
III. VARIOUS CLASSES TO BE TRAINED 
The first and in many respects the most important 
class of persons who will seek to be trained in a school of 
public health are those who expect to devote their lives to 
health work in some of its branches. These will aim to 
become for the most part public health officials or to be 
engaged in some capacity in public health service, but 
some may become teachers or be connected with institu- 
tions or find other opportunities for a career in the ever 
widening field of sanitation. It is of the first importance 
 
-P-A-G-E-418
  418 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
to consider and to supply the needs for the education of 
prospective public health officials. 
Without attempting an exhaustive analysis, the fol- 
lowing classification will suffice to indicate the various 
types of officers or experts required in public health ad- 
ministration: 
1. Higher administrative officials, as commissioners of 
health and health officers in cities and districts, and divi- 
sion or bureau chiefs in the larger state and city cpt 
ments of health. | 
2. Health officers in towns, villages and rural com- 
munities. 
8. Higher technical officials or experts, as statisticians, 
sanitary engineers, chemists, bacteriologists, diagnosti- 
cians, epidemiologists, etc. 
4. Inspectors of various kinds, as school, sanitary, food, 
factory, etc. inspectors. 
5. Public health nurses. 
With this class may be included those preparing to enter 
the Public Health Service of the federal government. 
An institute or school of hygiene should furnish suitable 
training for all of these, and while courses adapted for 
special needs will be supplied, it does not seem desirable 
to conceive of such an institute as constituted primarily 
to provide,training for higher or lower grades of the service 
so much as to furnish opportunities for a good general 
education in all branches of hygiene. 
While it is hardly possible to overestimate the impor- 
tance of providing opportunities for the training of those 
who are to become public health officials, the need here is 
at present so acute that there is some danger of overlooking 
the conception of hygiene as a science and art which is 
much brouder than its applications to public health ad- 
ministration. Hygiene includes much more than state 
medicine. It is not necessary to consider here the dis- 
tinction sometimes made, especially in this country, be-
-P-A-G-E-419
  INSTITUTE OF HYGIENE 419 
tween hygiene and sanitation. In this report the term 
“thygiene” is used to include both, that is, the whole body 
of knowledge and its application relating to the preserva- 
tion and improvement of health of individuals and of the 
community and to the prevention of disease. 
With this broad conception it is obvious that the edu- 
cational. and scientific opportunities of an institute of 
hygiene should not be limited to the use of those who in- 
tend to become specialists in public health work and should 
cover a wider field than that of state medicine or sanita- 
tion. 
It is of the utmost importance that education in the 
principles of hygiene should be available for students and 
graduates in medicine who are to engage in the practice 
of their profession. With the present crowded medical 
curriculum obligatory courses in hygiene for undergraduate 
students of medicine must necessarily be restricted, but 
with the tendency toward greater freedom of election of 
medical studies there is the need and opportunity to pro- 
vide more extensive optional courses in hygiene. There 
is a wide field for the establishment of graduate courses in 
hygiene for physicians. Even in Great Britain, where the 
character of training is designed almost wholly for public 
health officials, many who intend to become medical prac- 
titioners secure the diploma in public health. The mis- 
sion of the practising physician is in many respects chang- 
ing, and there can be no doubt that a year or more of 
graduate work in hygiene would be eagerly sought by 
many physicians and would greatly increase their capacity 
of useful service to their patients and to the community, 
if the proper opportunities for such work were provided. 
Sanitary engineering has become a specialized profes- 
sion, and the institute of hygiene should combine with the 
engineering school in supplying the requisite training. 
The public health nurse, both as a part of the public 
health service and independently of such connection, is
-P-A-G-E-420
  420 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
destined to play a réle of increasing importance in the 
improvement of conditions of healthy living and working 
and in the control of infectious and industrial diseases in 
this country. The institute of hygiene should co-operate 
with schools and organizations for training nurses in meet- 
ing the need for a supply of trained public health nurses. 
When one considers the many points of contact be- 
tween the modern social welfare movement and the public 
health movement, and to what an extent social and eco- 
nomic factors enter into questions of public health it is 
clear that an institute of hygiene must take full cogni- 
zance of such factors and that students of social science 
should profit by certain opportunities in the institute, as 
well as students of hygiene by training in social science and 
social work. 
An important class to be provided for in an institute of 
hygiene will be those engaged in special advanced work in 
some branch of the subject and in original investigations 
of hygienic problems. A main function of the institute 
should be the development of the spirit of investigation 
and the advancement of knowledge, upon which intelli- 
gent public health administration and individual hygiene 
are absolutely dependent. It will be especially from this 
class of advanced workers and investigators and from the 
group of assistants in the institute that the teachers and 
the authorities and experts in hygiene will be recruited for 
service in different fields of activity and the standards of 
the profession of hygiene and of public health will be 
elevated. 
IV. FIELD TO BE COVERED 
The field covered by the terms “hygiene,” “sanitary 
science,” “public health,” “preventive medicine” is so 
broad and varied that it is hardly possible within a brief 
compass to indicate all of the subjects here included. 
Strictly speaking the territory embraces a group of sciences 
or the application of various underlying sciences. Unity 99 «6
-P-A-G-E-421
  INSTITUTE OF HYGIENE 421 
is to be found rather in the end to be accomplished—the 
preservation and improvement of health—than in the 
means essential to this end. It is the focussing upon this 
definite purpose which gives coherence to the organized 
body of knowledge embraced under the designations 
“hygiene” and “sanitation,” and makes important its 
study and cultivation as a professional pursuit. 
Although the practitioner of medicine should have 
knowledge of hygiene and of the means of preventing 
disease and has abundant opportunity in the practice of 
his calling to apply this knowledge, and the public health 
worker, if he is to prevent disease, must have knowledge 
of the origin, mode of spread and diagnosis of disease, still 
it is becoming increasingly clear that public health work 
constitutes a distinct profession, and the wider recogni- 
tion of this fact will be an important result of the creation 
of institutes or schools of hygiene. 
The wide scope of the professional training required 
for the well equipped public health worker is sufficiently 
indicated by the mere enumeration of the more important 
subjects to which more or less attention must be given in 
an institute of hygiene, at least so far as their scientific 
groundwork in relation to sanitation is required. Such 
subjects are vital statistics; epidemiology or the causation, 
spread and prevention of transmissible diseases, including 
tuberculosis and the venereal diseases; diagnosis of in- 
fectious diseases; industrial hygiene; sanitary parasitology, 
including bacteriology and immunology; sanitary chemis- 
try; sanitary engineering; hospital construction and ad- 
ministration; housing, ventilation, heating, lighting; dis- 
infection; the hygiene of air, soil, water and climate; water 
supplies and sewage disposal; infant mortality and child 
hygiene; hygiene of schools; mental hygiene; heredity and 
eugenics; social hygiene; personal hygiene; diet and nu- 
trition; rural, farm and dairy hygiene; milk supply; food 
and drug adulterations; nuisances; public health adminis-  
-P-A-G-E-422
  422 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
tration and organization, sanitary laws and codes; quaran- 
tine and immigration; tropical hygiene; relation of animal 
diseases to human diseases; public education in healthy 
living; social service work; sanitary surveys. 
Vv. AGENCY REQUIRED TO PERFORM THIS FUNCTION 
The central, essential and main agency required to meet 
the needs which have been indicated is an institute of 
hygiene, housed in its own building, provided with the 
requisite laboratories and facilities and with its own staff 
of teachers giving their entire time to the work of teaching 
and investigating. Given such a central institute it is 
easy to add to the curriculum, when found necessary, cer- 
tain courses which are now given, or could readily be sup- 
plied by various existing departments of the medical school, 
the engineering school or other faculties of the university. 
The mere assembling of such courses does not constitute a 
school of hygiene. The great need of the country to-day 
in the promotion of public health is the establishment of 
well equipped and adequately supported institutes or 
laboratories of hygiene, where the science of hygiene in its 
various branches is fruitfully cultivated and advanced and 
opportunities are afforded for thorough training in both 
the science and the art. It would be a misfortune if this 
broader conception of the fundamental agency required 
for the advancement of hygienic knowledge and hygienic 
education should be obscured through efforts directed 
solely toward meeting in the readiest way existing emer- 
gencies in public health service. 
1. Relation to a Medical School.—The profession of the 
sanitarian or public health worker not being identical with 
that of the practitioner of medicine, the institute of hy- 
giene, as the essential part of a school of hygiene, should 
have an independent existence and should not be regarded 
merely as a department of a medical school. But the 
medical school offers much which the institute of hygiene 
will require either as preliminary training or in course and
-P-A-G-E-423
  INSTITUTE OF HYGIENE 423 
which it will not care to duplicate. In the interest of 
economy and efficiency, therefore, the school of hygiene 
should be closely related to a medical school of high stand- 
ard in such way that the facilities of each should be open 
to the students of both. 
It is likewise important for study and training in pre- 
ventive medicine that the institute should have access to 
the facilities of a good general teaching hospital, as well 
as to various special hospitals. The need of opportunities 
for observation and study of patientsin an infectious disease 
hospital is of course obvious. 
2. Connection with a University—To perform to best 
advantage its function, the institute should be a part of a 
university. The medical school has found such connection 
to bea practical necessity. The institute of hygiene would 
draw even more heavily upon certain schools or depart- 
ments of the university, as those of engineering and of 
sociology. In addition to having at its disposal the 
facilities of the university, the institute would find the 
stimulating and sustaining scientific spirit and ideals of 
the university an indispensable asset. 
38. Separate Identity—While intimately related to the 
university and its medical school, the institute of hygiene 
should be established on its own foundation, and should 
preserve and emphasize its own identity as a separate in- 
stitution devoted exclusively to the science and the service 
of health; it should have its own building, and its own 
corps of instructors with adequate provision for teaching 
and research. 
While it is not difficult to bring together on paper a 
group of courses selected from the several schools and 
departments of the university and by the addition of a 
few new courses make a presentable prospectus of a school 
of public health, this is not the conception of such a school 
or institute as\ we believe will best fulfill the functions of 
developing the science and art of hygiene and of training
-P-A-G-E-424
  424 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
for this new profession. If the institute is to make itself 
felt as a constructive force it must have in it a group of 
scientific investigators and teachers whose absorbing 
interest is in developing the science of hygiene and apply- 
ing it to the conservation of health. 
While the concentration of work here advocated involves 
some duplication of equipment, this is not as large as might 
be supposed and, in view of the great advantages, does not 
constitute a serious objection. The institute must have 
its own chemical laboratory; it would be inconvenient and 
unsatisfactory in the extreme to attempt to use chemical 
laboratories devoted mainly to other purposes for the many 
important studies in sanitary chemistry. The principal 
microbiological laboratory of a medical school could with- 
out detriment be transferred to the institute of hygiene, 
although provision must exist for bacteriological work in 
the pathological laboratory, as well as in the hospital. 
Most of the other physical equipment of the institute 
would involve little duplication. 
4. Organization and Departments—At least in the 
beginning there should be a director of the institute, who 
will also be the head of one of the main divisions. Even- 
tually the heads of these divisions may constitute a group 
or faculty with co-ordinate powers in directing the policy 
and affairs of the institute. 
It is possible to indicate only in outline and in a general 
way the principal departments or divisions of an institute 
of hygiene, as details of organization and division of work 
should be left to the staff of teachers whose interests and 
qualifications will vary with the individuals. 
a. Chemical Division—The applications of chemistry 
to sanitary science and art are extremely important and 
varied, and already highly developed. 
b. Biological Division—Here there would be a number 
of subdivisions, as bacteriology, protozoology, medical 
zoology.
-P-A-G-E-425
  INSTITUTE OF HYGIENE 425 
ce. Engineering or Physical Division —A part of this can 
best be provided for in the engineering school, but the in- 
stitute should provide opportunities for the study of cer- 
tain hygienic problems requiring the application of physi- 
cal science. 
d. Statistical Division—While the various questions 
connected with the collection and study of vital statistics 
constitute the most important subject in this field, there 
are other important applications of statistical science to 
hygiene. 
e. Division of General Hygiene and Preventive Medicine.— 
Under this broad heading may be included epidemiology, 
industrial hygiene, the principles of public health adminis- 
tration and other subjects not embraced under the pre- 
vious captions. 
The foregoing classification is not designed to be either 
final or exhaustive and is manifestly reduced to its sim- 
plest terms. 
If qualified men can be found there should be three or 
four teachers of the rank of full professors, but in their 
absence it would be better to select even for some of the 
important divisions younger men of great promise with 
the grade of assistant professors or of associates. In 
addition to these probably at least eight or ten assistants 
at moderate salaries would be required. 
As already stated, the institute once established on its 
own foundation will draw upon the medical school, the 
engineering school and other departments of the univer- 
sity for courses of instruction which it will not care to 
provide on its own grounds, and it will itself co-operate in 
furnishing instruction to students in other departments. 
5. Field Work.—Hygienic excursions to inspect water- 
filtration plants, sewage disposal systems, methods of 
heating and ventilation and for kindred purposes consti- 
tute a valuable part of practical sanitary training. The 
most important training in the field, however, will be 
 
-P-A-G-E-426
    
    426 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
provided by establishing working relations with state and 
municipal departments of health and with the United 
States Public Health Service. This arrangement will pro- 
vide for giving to the students practical experience in 
every department of public health work. The students 
may in this way become acquainted under favorable con- 
ditions with the methods of handling the health problems 
of the large city as well as those of the rural community. 
There will be opportunity for participating in the work 
of sanitary surveys. Co-operation with the federal Pub- 
lic Health Service will give good opportunity for experi- 
ence in quarantine work and in sanitary and epidemiologi- 
cal work on a large scale. Such relations will be mutually 
helpful. The states and cities will reap the benefit of 
intelligent and scientifically trained workers who will enter 
the service as real workers in all fields of its activities. 
The institute and its students in turn will have the benefit 
of this practical experience. 
6. Museuwm.—An important feature of the institute will 
be a good hygienic museum, which will contain models, 
charts, preparations, and other material which can be 
gradually brought together. This will serve not only for 
demonstrative teaching, but also for the education of the 
public. The influence and usefulness of the institute will 
be extended by popular lectures, conferences and exten- 
sion courses. 
7. Special Courses.—The institute should provide for 
the needs of those already engaged in health work, who 
desire to pursue short courses or to do advanced work in 
special branches. 
8. Requirements for Admission; Certificates and Degrees. 
—The details regarding the conditions for admission to the 
institute may be left to future consideration, but it should 
be stated that while the majority of candidates for di- 
plomas and degrees will doubtless be graduates in medi- 
cine, these distinctions should not be limited to physicians.
-P-A-G-E-427
INSTITUTE OF HYGIENE 427 
The institute should be ready to receive and to reward with 
its diplomas and degrees all who come with a satisfactory 
preliminary education and pursue the required training, 
which need not be rigidly uniform for all matriculates. 
Even those who may not meet the requirements for ma- 
triculation and become candidates for the degree may find 
opportunity to’ pursue special courses of study. It has 
been abundantly demonstrated that the profession of 
public health work can be successfully followed by sani- 
tarians whose principal training has been in sanitary en- 
gineering, sanitary chemistry and sanitary biology. 
9. Influence of the Institute-—The benefits to be ex- 
pected from the establishment of such an institute as that 
proposed are not to be measured solely by the number 
of students trained within its walls. The institute can 
supply only a relatively small number of those who desire 
to enter upon public health service. The far-reaching 
influence of the institute should be felt in the advance- 
ment of the science and the improvement of the practice 
of public health, in establishing higher standards and 
better methods of professional education in this field, in 
stimulating the foundation of similar institutes in other 
parts of the country, in supplying teachers and in co- 
operating with schools of a simpler character designed for 
briefer technical training which should be established in 
each state in connection jointly with boards of health and 
medical schools.

EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
Tuer teaching profession is showing signs of a 
somewhat violent reaction against the uniform- 
ity of method that for so long clutched and 
mechanized the schools. Long before teachers 
realized the deadening effects of uniformity, 
there had been many protests from outside the 
teaching fold; but they had availed little in fo- 
cussing professional attention. Parents had no- 
ticed that vigor and freshness were departing 
from the teaching in our public schools. Youth 
at high schools and colleges had in their own 
way filed their protest by turning from the un- 
appealing work of classrooms to affairs of their 
own invention, to school sports and sociability. 
But the professional consciousness was not 
deeply penetrated until the teachers themselves 
were caught in the iron machinery of their own 
making. When the supervision of teachers be- 
came as inflexible and as unindividual as the 
teaching of children, the problem of individu-

ality in education became an acute professional 
one. Particularly was this true in large city 
school systems, where the mere bigness of the 
situation obscured both the individual teacher 
and the individual child. 
Of course there have been other forces con- 
tributing to this awakening to the need of con- 
serving and developing individuality. Great 
institutional movements are far too complex 
to be explained simply, — one set of forces sel- 
dom operates without assistance from many 
others. 
The growing belief that the education of all 
children is a public duty initiated difficulties 
that forced attention to the need of individual 
‘treatment of children. The schools of an older 
generation took care of a selected group. Those | 
children to whom a more or less formal and ab- 
stract intellectual life appealed went to school 
and remained ; the others either did not enter 
school at all or soon left for more congenial em- 
ployment. The traditional methods of school- 
room procedure were adapted only toa picked 
lot of children. The effect of compulsory educa-

tion upon the school was therefore sweeping. 
All varieties of children were compelled to at- 
tend a school the traditional methods of which 
fitted only a few. The maladjustments became 
apparent. The old uniform methods broke down 
before the needs of a new, enlarged, and more 
varied population. Children were eliminated 
from school or retarded in their school careers 
to such a degree as seriously to indict the school 
system. The cry for individual adjustment be- 
came a shibboleth among the reformers ; and it 
found a ready echo in the city teacher who found 
herself becoming a pedagogical mechanic under 
the uniform standards imposed from above. 
The growth of cities also emphasized exist- 
ing maladjustments. The heterogeneous school 
Populations of large industrial and commercial 
centres embrace a wide distribution of eco- 
nomic groups and classes. The evidence of so 
great variation in pupils in the schools of these 
cities helped the school men of the country to 
realize that variety is one of the chief charac- 
teristics of human nature. To be sure the ob- 
served differences in individuals were often due

more to environment than to original causes, and 
were frequently more apparent than real; the 
effect, however, was even more pronounced than 
if the teachers had possessed an accurate, scien- 
tific view of natural and fundamental variations 
among men. The call for special schools, smaller 
classes, and specialized methods of teaching was 
prompt, though not always intelligent. The city 
school system afforded an easy administrative 
opportunity for handling such special classes. 
In a congested population there would be 
enough deaf and dumb, or cripples, or juvenile 
delinquents, or truants, or tubercular children to 
warrant the establishment of special schools or 
classes. Hence the large city easily furnished ex- 
amples of ways of providing for better adjust- 
ment to individuality, and became the initiator, 
as well as the pattern, of new movements of this 
kind, 
It is probable, too, that the child-study move- 
ment in education gave assistance to the other 
factors that were breaking up the uniform 
methods of the traditional school. It took the 
attention off certain ready-made conceptions a8

to what the human mind is, and turned it toward 
the study of the children themselves. The con- 
crete acts of many children, observed under all 
sorts of conditions, could not help but stimu- 
late the growing belief that childhood has in- 
finite variety. 
As a result of these major forces, and of some 
other minor ones at work in our professional 
thought, the reaction against the blight of uni- 
formity in teaching has deepened. It has ex- 
pressed itself positively in the demand for ad- 
ministrative and instructional means that will 
produce an increased regard for individuality. 
For the most part this revolution —for it has 
been nothing less—in point of view, was a re- 
bellion of common sense against an obvious 
wrong. It moved in the right direction, but, as 
is the case when common sense is the sole 
guide, it advanced without much refinement of 
either knowledge or methods. 
To escape from the tyranny of traditional no- 
tions as to what constitutes an average child 
under average conditions, and to reach the be- 
lief general and vague though it be — that

schools must be respecters of individuality, is 
surely a sign of progress. But our pupils will 
never reap the full benefit of this changed point 
of view until we know specifically to what extent 
individuals vary and what are the causes of this 
variation ; as well as the particular practical im- 
plications of these scientific truths. 
Unfortunately the truths of such a complex 
problem as that of human individuality are now 
only in the process of scientific reduction. In so 
far as they exist and may be presented in re 
stricted compass, they are summarized in the 
volume here presented. But this contribution of 
Professor Thorndike’s is significant for more 
than its incidental summary of known facts ; for 
it establishes a point of view and indicates a 
safe method of approach to this intricate study 
of human nature. With ingenious clarity and 
brilliant suggestiveness, coupled with scientific 
caution and accuracy, the author has given us 
the fundamental modes by which uniformities 
and variations are to be perceived in human 
nature; has stated their general and specific 
Causes ; and has pointed out their meaning for so-

. I : os 
THE NATURE OF INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES 
Tur life of a man is a double series — a series of 
effects produced in him by the rest’ of the world, 
and a series of effects produced in that world by 
him. A man’s make-up ‘or nature equals his ten- 
dencies to be influenced in certain ways by the 
world and to react in certain ways to it. To de- 
scribe even one man’s intellect and character 
fully, at even arty one time, it would be neces- 
sary to list all, the world’s happenings that he 
might possibly encounter, and to state in each 
case how he would feel and think and act in 
response to that happening. 
If we could thus adequately describe each of a 
million human beings, —if, for each one, we could 
prophesy just what the response would be to every 
possible situation of life, — the million men would . 
be found to differ widely. Probably no two out

only @ mind, the mind of the human species, but 
also his own, specialized, particular, readily dis- |

deed, men differ so much that it would be hard 
to find, amongst a million, two whose features are 
just alike, who are equally susceptible to every 
disease, who have identical bodily habits. .The 
differences in intellect and character are far 
greater. } Wore ek 
"We may study a human being in respect to his 
common humanity, or in respect to his individ- 
uality. In other words, we may study the fea- 
tures of intellect and character which arecommon 
to all men, to man as a species; or we may study 
the differences in intellect and character which 
distinguish individual men. 
The study of the facts and laws applicable to 
all men by virtue of their common humanity 
gives education its fundamental rules for the con- 
trol of changes in intellect and character. The 
2

NATURE OF INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES 
study of the facts and laws of individual differ- 
ences enables us toapply these principles economi- 
cally in the case of each individual whom we seek 
to educate, 
In studying individual differences, it is cus- 
tomary to reduce the infinitude of tendencies to 
think and feel and act in certain ways in response 
to the varied situations which life offers, to the 
more general, and so fewer, tendencies which 
the psychologist calls abilities, interests, habits, 
qualities of mind, or mental traits. Thus the 
hundreds of connections between the situations 
represented by all the possible problems in ad- 
dition and the responses represented by all their 
solutions, are reduced to the one trait, “ability 
to add.” Thus the many inborn connections be- 
tween, on the one hand, seeing and toyghing 
blocks, sand, strings, wire, stones, water, and 
other material objects, and on the other hand 
examining, poking, pulling, putting together, 
taking apart, forming and re-forming those ob- 
jects, are comprised in the one trait, “ the instinct 
of constructiveness ” or “the interest in manipu- 
lation.” Thus by such a term as “memory for fig- 
3 -

ures” we refer tothe permanence of many con. 
nections, — the thought of a battle with its date, | 
the thought of a person with his address or tele- 
phone number, the thought of a city with its num- 
ber of inhabitants. 
Individuals are commonly considered as differ- 
ing in respect to such traits either quantitatively. 
or, qualitatively, either in degree or in kind. A 
quantitative difference exists when the individ. 
uals have different amounts of the same trait. 
Thus, “John is more attentive to his teacher than 
James is,” “Mary loves dolls less than Lucy 
does,” “A had greater devotion to his country 
than B had,” are reports of quantitative differ- 
ences, of differences in the amount of what is 
assumed to be the same kind of thing. A qual- — 
itative difference exists when some qualityor trait 
possessed by one individual is lacking in the 
other. Thus, “Tom knows German, Dick does 
not,” “A is artistic, B is scientific,” “C is a man 
of thought, D is a man of action,” are reports of 
the facts that Tom has some positive amount 
or degree of the trait “knowledge of German” 
while Dick has none of it, that A has some posi- 
4

NATURE OF INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES 
tive amount of ability and interest in art while 
B has zero, whereas B has a positive amount of 
ability and interest in science, of which A has 
none, and so on. 
A qualitative difference in intellect or charac- 
ter is thus reallya quantitative difference wherein 
one term is zero, or a compound of two or more 
quantitative differences. All intelligible differ- 
ences are ultimately quantitative. The difference 
between any two individuals, if describable at all, 
is described by comparing the amounts which A 
possesses of various traits with the amounts which 
B possesses of thé same traits. In intellect and 
character, differences of kind between one in- . 
dividual and another turn out to be definable, 
if defined at all, as compound differences of de- 
gree, 
If we could list all the traits, each representing 
some one characteristic of human nature, and 
measure the amount of each of them possessed 
by a man, we could represent his nature — read 
his character — in a great equation. John Smith 
would equal so many units of this, plus so 
| many units of that, and so on. Such a mental

inventory would express his individuality conceiv. 
ably in its entirety and with great exactitude. 
No such list has been made for any man, much 
less have the exact amounts of each trait pos- 
sessed by him been measured. But in certain of 
the traits, many individuals have been measured; 
and certain individuals have been measured, each 
in a large number of traits. I shall state first 
some of the more important results of the mea- 
surements of individual differences in the case of 
single traits, differences in the amount of the 
same kind of quality or thing. 
INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN SINGLE TRAITS 
It is useless to recount the traits in which men 
have been found to differ. For there is no trait 
in which they do not differ. Of course if the 
scale by which individuals are measured is very 
coarsely divided, their differences may be hidden. 
If, for example, ability to learn is measured on a 
scale with only two divisions, (1) “ability to learn 
less than the average kitten can” and (2) “ability 
to learn more than the average kitten can,” all 
men may be put in class two, just as if their 
6 .

DIFFERENCES IN SINGLE TRAITS 
heights were measured on a scale of one yard, 
two yards, or three yards, nearly all men would 
alike be called two yards high. But whenever 
the scale of measurement is made fine enough, 
differences at once appear. 
Their existence is indubitable to any impartial 
observér. The early psychologists neglected or 
failed to see them precisely because the early 
psychology was partial. It believed in a typical 
or pattern mind, after the fashion of which all 
minds were created, and from which they differed 
only by rare accidents. It studied “the mind,” 
and neglected individual minds. It studied “the 
will” of “man,” neglecting the interests, im- 
pulses, and habits of actual men. : 
The differences exist at birth and commonly 
increase with progress toward maturity. Individ- 
uality is already clearly manifest in children of 
school age. The same situation evokes widely 
differing responses; the same task is done at 
differing speeds and with different degrees of 
success ; the same treatment produces differing 
results. 
There can be little doubt that of a thousand

INDIVIDUALITY 
ten-year-olds taken at random, some will be four 
times as energetic, industrious, quick, courage- 
ous, or honest as others, or will possess four 
times as much refinement, knowledge of arith- 
metic, power of self-control, sympathy, or the like. 
It has been found that amongst children of the 
same age and, in essential respects, of the same 
home training and school advantages, some do in 
the same time sixtimes as much, or do the same 
amount with only one tenth as many errors. 
The ways in which and the extent to which in- 
dividuals differ in mental traits can be best un- 
derstood by considering the Distribution of the 
trait, that is, the number of individuals possess- 
ing each degree of it. For example, the distribu- 
tion of stature in American boys ten and a half 
years old is roughly as follows. 
Out of 1000 boys, there are: — 
Between rog and 113 centimetres tall, 2 boys.

psychology. They tell us what the “type” or 
“norm” or common tendency is, how and how 
far individuals vary from the type, whether there 
are secondary or sub-types, how “abnormal” any 
given degree of the trait is, and the like. For in- 
stance, in the case of our illustration, it is clear 
10
-P-A-G-E-21
DIFFERENCES IN SINGLE TRAITS 
that there is one central tendency, the typicak 
height for a boy of this age being about 133 cm.; 
that slight individual variations from the type 
are very numerous, but that large variations 
from it are very rare; that the variations are 
continuous, individuals being found of every 
height from 110 cm. to over 150 cm. ; that a boy 
over 149 cm. tall at the age of ten and a half 
would be abnormal in the sense that he would 
occur only once in two hundred and fifty times, 
but would not be abnormal in the sense of being 
removed from ordinary children by a distinct 
gap. . 
All thought about individual differences in 
single traits should be carried on in terms of 
‘such distribution tables or surfaces, each derived 
from the actual measurement of a large and 
representative group of individuals. It is mislead- 
ing to form opinions from casual observations of 
human nature without accurate measurements. 
For casual observation is struck by extreme, 
odd, exciting, and desired facts, It notes, for 
example, that two railroad wrecks occurred at 
the same day and hour, that it has not rained for 
Ir ‘
-P-A-G-E-22
INDIVIDUALITY 
two months, that Walter Scott was thought dull 
as a boy, that the rule of the Republican party 
has greatly increased (or decreased) prosperity. 
It is misleading to judge from measurements 
of a few individuals. For their meaning can be 
rightly seen only by comparison with the total 
distribution in respect to the trait in question. ' 
In theory and in practice, we must think of an 
individual in any one trait not only as he is in 
and of himself, but as he is in relation to all men, 
—as one variation amongst others in the total 
distribution in respect to that trait. There is in- 
deed no one habit of thought about human na- 
ture more important for the understanding of 
individuality than the habit of thinking of the 
different amounts or degrees of each single qual- 
ity or trait as distances along a scale, and of 
men and women as distributed along that scale 
each at his proper point. 
The study of such distributions in the case of 
qualities of intellect and character, has brought to 
light two facts, bothat variance with common opin- 
ion and both of importance for the practical con- 
trol of individuals by schools, laws, books, and the 
12  
-P-A-G-E-23
DIFFERENCES IN SINGLE TRAITS 
like. First, she variations in any single trait as 
usually continuous. Second, the variations usually 
cluster around one and only one type. 
The continuity of variations appears in every 
trait that has so far been measured. Children 
rarely or never fall into distinct classes with 
gaps between, — bright, average, and dull, sane 
and insane, visualizers and non-visualizers, color- 
seeing and color-blind, and the like. On the con- 
trary, between the least and the greatest, the 
best and the worst, every degree is represented, 
The clustering around one type, tHough not 
perhaps as universal as the continuity of varia- 
tions, is also to be expected, save under certain 
special conditions in the causes that produce the 
trait. The true state of affairs is that shown by 
such distributions as those of Figure 3, not by 
such as those of Figure 4. We must not be mis- 
led, by the habit of thinkirfg in words, into the 
false belief that individualities are grouped into

types or modes of character. That the words “de 
ficient,” “normal,” and “superior” are used of 
any trait is no proof that individuals in that trait 
show a separation into three groups, all in one 
group being much like one another and little like 
any of those in the other groups. 
Fic. 4. Distributions around Several Distinct Types, such as are

We must learn to think of the degree or 
amount of any quality in an individual not by an

them into two, three or more classes or species, 
according to the way they are in fact divided, not

according to rhetorical convenience. In the great 
majority of single traits, there is only one type or 
mode, so that any division into distinct classes 
according to the amount of the trait is arbitrary. 
The distribution being as in Figure 5, it is equally 
possible to divide individuals into two, three, four, 
five, six, seven, eight, or eight hundred classes; 
and for any given number of classes one gay put

the dividing lines in one place as well as another. 
Consequently classifications of individuals with 
respect to the amount of any single trait are al- 
most always useless if not misleading. The story 
is to be told, not by a series of names, bit by a 
surface of distribution erected on a numerical 
scale, 
Turning again to Figure 3, one notes that all 
16
-P-A-G-E-27
DIFFERENCES IN SINGLE TRAITS 
the distributions there shown have, as a common ' 
feature, the great frequency of mediocrity and 
the rareness of both specially low and specially 
high degrees of a trait. Approximately this is the 
rule for the original individualities of mankind. 
Approximately this remains the rule for many 
traits throughout the course of life and its training. 
In many traits a very small difference in ability 
or attitude near the middle point of the scale in- 
cludes a great many individuals. This fact explains 
much in human behavior. For instance, social and 
political movements are often instigated by indi- 
viduals who are at the extremes of the scale with 
respect to some doctrine. But the deciding votes 
are almost always cast by individuals who haveno 
very pronounced inclination in either direction. 
The attractiveness of some hero, the suggestive 
power of some battle-cry,.an affront tothe sense of 
fair play, a year of hard times, a moderate expendi- 
ture of money, even the mere desire for novelty, 
may turn the balance, because only a slight addi- 
tion to the attractiveness of one proposal is 
needed to move a great number of those near the 
: point of neutrality. To overturn a large majority 
17
-P-A-G-E-28
INDIVIDUALITY 
requires only a small change in opinion. A slight 
improvement in teaching may make a misunder- 
stood point clear toa large percentage of the class. 
The facts that have been stated concerning the 
distribution of single traits teach, with respect to | 
their educational control, that any method which 
is the best possible for those of one degree of a | 
trait cannot be the best possible for all individu- | 
als. Nor will two or three varieties of treatment | 
suffice to educate all in the best way. Variations 
in human nature are wide and continuous, so that 
theoretically treatment also must vary much and 
continuously. _ ; 
It is not possible with ordinary facilities thus to 
give each individual in each trait the best possi- 
ble treatment, but knowledge of the amount and 
distribution of variations will prevent certain 
blunders. For example, a division into three 
groups is usually very much preferable to a divi- 
sion into two groups, but the gain by adding a 
fourth is far less, One change in school practice 
to make it more conformable to individual differ- 
ences is entirely practicable. Since the variations 
in any trait are so wide, a pupil should always be

measured, not only, as now, by his ability in com- 
parison with his fellows, but also by his improve- 
ment over his own past recdrd. School marks 
should be on absolute as well as relative scales.! 
A child should be given a measure of change as 
well as of present inferiority or superiority to 
some standard in the teacher’s mind. 
INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN COMBINATIONS 
OF TRAITS 
The variety of human nature possible when 
one man is compared with others in respect to 
all possible traits is practically infinite.‘ Even if 
man’s nature included only five traits, a, 3, ¢, 4, 
and ¢, and even if each of these existed in only: 
five degrees, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, there could be over 
three thousand (3125, to be exact) varieties of 
men.’ With hundreds of traits, each represented 
in hundreds of degrees, the varieties possible are 
Practically infinite, All the principles involved 
can, however, be understood in a simplified case 
such as that of the five traits, each appearing in

John Smith = 144 46+ 2¢-++ 5d-+ Ie, 
H. Thomas = 4a--16 + 1c -+| 2d + 3¢, 
or, more clearly, by a series of points on the five 
scales for the five traits as in Figure 6.

Fic. 6. Three Individuals, R, S,.and vr, each measured in the case 
of Five Traits, a, 6, c,d, and ¢, as possessing 1, 2, 3, 4, or § de 
grees thereof. 
Over three thousand varieties are possible, but 
they need not all occur. For example, suppose 
that the amount of trait.@ that an individual pos- 
sessed was so related with the amounts of 8, ¢, d, 
and ¢ that he possessed, that if he had 2¢ he 
would have also 24, 2c, 2d, and 2¢, while if he

had 4a he must have 46, 4c, 4d, and 4e, and 
similarly for 1a, 3a, and 5a. Then the only varie- 
ties of individuals that could exist would be: — 
Some who were 1a + 16-+ ic-+1d-+ te, 
“ & 2qg4 ab 24 2d+24, 
and so on, five varieties in all, shown in Figure 
7. Or suppose that an individual having 5a could

never have less than 3 of 4, ¢, d, ande. Then 
Such individualities as — 
5a 2b + 4c + 3d + 5¢, 
5a + 56 + 1c + 4d + 3¢, 
and the like could not exist. The kind of varie- 
ties that can exist will then express the relations, 
or, as they are commonly called, the correlations, 
between the amounts of the five traits, that is, 
21
-P-A-G-E-32
INDIVIDUALITY 
the extent to which the amount of one trait 
possessed by an individual is bound up with the 
amount which he possesses of some other trait. 
This is as true for five hundred traits as for five, 
and for an infinite number of degrees of each as 
for five degrees. What kind of individuals there 
will be, and what proportion there will be of each 
kind, is a result of the distribution of individuals 
in single traits and of the correlations of the 
traits. To this fact we shall soon need to return. 
Confronted by the infinite variety of total hu- 
man natures, thinkers have hoped to find certain 
types, —the genius, the i insane, the criminal, the 
like, — such that ail, orat least Jeast many, individuals 
would belong under one or another of these types. 
A type represents some particular combination 
of amounts of the list of human traits. For ex- 
ample, suppose the list of traits to be a, 4, ¢, 4 
and ¢, and the degrees of each to range from 0 
to 10. Then

would be possible types. They are represented 
graphically in Figure 8. 
Now such individuals as:— 
(1) 1a + 45+ 5e-+ 94+ 98, 
or (2) 3a + 46 + 5¢-+ 84+ I08, 
or (3) 2a ++ 56 + 6c ++ 84+ Io8, 
obviously vary little from Type I, but much from 
Type Il or Type III.

These facts are easily seen in Figure 9, which 
represents Types I, II, and III and individuals 1

The customary view has been that “types,” or 
particular combinations of amounts of human 
traits, could be found so that any individual would 
be much like some type and much less like any

ing such types, and the more clearly the sup- 
posed types are defined, the surer it becomes 
that intermediate conditions, equally like several 
of the types, exist in great numbers. Either new

own type ; or the number of individuals not fall- 
ing readily under any type is so large that the 
attempt to classify men by them hinders. rather 
than helps thought and practical control. Only . 
very rarely can anything approaching at all .. 
closely to an accurate and adequate account ofa — 
man’s individuality be given by the statement 
that he is of this or that “type.” nd? 
In fact, there is much reason to believe thai 
human individualities do not represent ten or.a 
hundred or a thousand types, but either one 
single type or as many types as there are individ 
uals, according to whether the thinker wishes _ 
to emphasize the mode arourid which they vary 
or the exact nature of their variations from it. 
By this view the effort to assign individuals to a 
number of classes, as we assign animals to the 
classes “mammals,” “reptiles,” “amphibians,” 
“fishes,” etc., is doomed to failure or incompet- 
ence. The first duty of the thinker is to learn 
the constitution of the one’ typé, man. His sec- 
ond duty is to learn each individual's variation 
from this common humanity.’ In theory it means 
that man is mentally, as much as physically, one 
25
-P-A-G-E-36
INDIVIDUALITY 
species. In practice it means that each individ. 
ual must be considered by himself. 
It certainly is the case that almost allof the 
detailed classifications of individuals in accord 
with the multiple-type theory are either useless 
or misleading. The commonest element in such 
classifications is the supposed principle of com- 
pensation or balance, whereby, for example, a 
“quick but careless” type is contrasted with a 
“slow but sure” type; or an “easy learning, 
quickly forgetting” type is contrasted with the 
slow learner who retains long; or efficiency in 
thought, efficiency in actioh, and delicacy in sen- 
timent are supposed to be exclusive, each of the 
other two. Such types, presupposing relations of 
compensation between intrinsically desirable 
traits, are almost certainly illusory. 
All trustworthy studies so far made of the re- 
lations between the amounts of desirable single 
traits in the same individual agree in finding di- 
rect or “positive” relations between such traits. 
Having a large measure of one good quality i# 
creases the probability that one will have more 
than the average of any other good quality. He

who can learn better.than the average through 
the eyes, tends to learn better than the average 
through the ears also; he who can attend to one 
thing better than all other men, will be able to 
attend to many things at once or in rapid succes- 
sion better than most of them. Artistic ability, as 
in music, painting, or literary creation, goes wth 
scientific ability and matter-of-fact wisdom, ‘The 
best abstract thinker will be above the average in 
concrete thought also. The rapid workera are the 
more accurate. Intellectual ability and moral 
worth hang together. 
The correlations are, of course, not perfect. A 
large degree of superiority in one desirable trait 
may involve only a slight superiority. in many 
others, And since the relations vary enormously 
amongst individuals, a person highly gifted in one 
respect will often, though not usually, be very in- 
ferior in others. 
‘ The description which I have given of the va- 
rieties of total human nature doubtless seems to 
the reader to be far from clear. We have. seen 
that millions upon millions of different conditions 
27
-P-A-G-E-38
INDIVIDUALITY 
of traits may exist ; that a large fraction of them 
do exist ; that they do not divide naturally intodis- 
tinct types, but probably vary around one type; 
and that efficiency in one respect is positively cor- 
related with efficiency in others. Wemay add that, 
in general, the greater the variation from the 
one common type of “the ordinary individual,” 
the rarer it, is. But we have failed to get a neat, 
handy summary of the varieties of mankind. Their 
multitudinous complexity and richness remains to 
baffle the mind. : . 
The fact is that a simple, orderly, tidy chart of 
human geography would be sure to bea false one, 
and that until inventories of the amounts of hun- 
dreds of traits are made for many individuals, we 
have no right to construct such a chart of any 
sort. Even by original nature, intellect and char- 
acter are enormously diversified, and differences 
in training add new complexities. For the pre- 
sent each individual’s equation must be written 
out as a result of a direct examination of his 
whole make-up, not inferred from a few symp- 
toms, plus a hasty general theory of individuality.

Sex, remote ancestry or race, immediate an- 
cestry or family, growth or maturity, and that 
total of forces operating on a man’s nature which 
‘ we call the environment, all contribute to explain 
_ why any one man is what he is, To review some 
of the main facts about the influence of these 
factors is the aim of this chapter. 
  THE INFLUENCE OF SEX 
What little scientific study of the differences 
between the sexes in intellect and character there 
29
-P-A-G-E-40
INDIVIDUALITY 
has been, tends to minimize the traditional con- 
ception that they are two distinct kinds of beings, 
never understanding one another and requiring 
very different kinds of treatment..On the con- 
trary, it appears that if the primary sex charac- 
ters——the instincts directly related to courtship, 
love, child-bearing, and nursing —~are left out of 
account, the average man differs from the aver- 
age woman far less than many men differ one 
from another. | 
In no tfait of those studied has a gap been’ 
found between the distributions for the twosexes. 
The upper extreme of one sex always overlaps 
the lower extreme of the other. Some girls like 
to fight better than some boys; some men are 
fonder of babies than some women. 
The overlapping is, in most of the traits stud- 
ied, very great. For example, popular belief would 
perhaps select as impressive sex differences the 
greater originality, activity, independence, and 
frankness of the male, and the greater emotion- 
ality, interest in personal appearance, and reli- 
giousness of the female.. These are indeed pro- 
bably among the largest sex differences, But, sa 
30
-P-A-G-E-41
THE INFLUENCE OF SEX . 
far as-is known, the overlapping in these-cases is 
approximately as shown in Figure 10.“Nearly all | 
women are more original than the iat original * 
man, and probably over a third of women are. 
more original than the average man. Nearly all: 
men are more religious than the least réligious | . 
woman, and probably about a third are more re- \" 
ligious than the average woman. 
    Fic. 10, 
In a study by indirect methods, whose results 
. therefore are somewhat insecure, Heymans and 
Wiersma found as the greatest difference be- 
tween men and women that in the relative 
strength of the interest in things and their me- 
chanisms (strongeg,in men) and the interest in 
persons and cheitBetings (stronger in women), - 
The difference is a trifle greater than that shown _ 
in Figure 11. Other differences not so large ara

that being a man tends to make an individual 
more vigorous in movement, more athletic and 
noisy, more independent, less sensitive to slight 
outside stimuli, less efficient in perceiving small 
details, more often color-blind, a trifle less quick 
to memorize, less shy and conscientious, lazier 
and fonder of games of skill, mental or bodily, 
less emotional, less eager for change, quicker in 
recovery from grief, and less impulsive. 
  Fie. 11. 
The prevailing overestimation of maleness and 
femaleness as determinants of intellect and char- 
acter is probably due to two causes. In the first 
place, literary presentations of the human nature 
of men and women have been concerned largely 
with men and women in coygtship, love, and par- 
enthood. It is just in theseairs of life that the 
sexes do show the greatest mental differences. 
In the second place, outside of courtship, love, 
32
-P-A-G-E-43
THE INFLUENCE OF RACE 
and parenthood, the sexes have been most often 
compared in the persons of their most eminent 
representatives. Such a comparison is unfair for 
the sexes as wholes, because the male sex is the 
more variable, so that even though the average 
man is inferior to the average woman in a given 
_trait, the best men in it may be above the best 
‘women. So in music and literature, although the 
experience of schools and life shows women in 
general to be not inferior to men, the greatest 
achievements have been by men. The greatest 
scientists, poets, painters, and musicians have 
been more frequently males for the same reason 
that idiots are more often males. 
Sex, then, though a real influence, is not so 
great an influence in making individuals differ as 
has been supposed. Many traits are practically 
uninfluenced by it. The variations within one 
sex are not very much less than the variations 
amongst men and women together. 
THE INFLUENCE OF RACE 
Differences in remote ancestry or race account 
for a very large percentage of ‘the differences 
33
-P-A-G-E-44
INDIVIDUALITY 
found amongst men i we consider both their 
direct effect upon original nature and their indi- 
rect effect through the differences in training 
which commonly parallel them. Even if we dis- 
regard the past and confine observation to the 
differences amongst living men, race directly and 
indirectly produces differences so great that 
government, business, industry, marriage, friend- 
ship, and almost every other feature of human in- 
stinctive and civilized life have to take account 
of a man’s race, 
But the effective differences between, say, the 
modern European, Chinese, and Negro are, in the 
first place, in part physical. It is not the Negro’s 
soul but his dody that is despised by many of 
those who despise him. The European /ooks like 
a foreign devil to the Chinese. The white man 
does not boast of his intelligence or virtue, but 
thanks God that at all events he is a whzte man. 
In the second place, clothes, coiffure, physical 
habits, and all the showy but trivial expressions 
’ of intellect and character in customs, ceremonies, , 
and manners, give an impression of fundamental 
unlikeness that is quite out of proportion to the 
34
-P-A-G-E-45
THE INFLUENCE OF RACE 
real facts. The Quakers were outlawed largely 
because they kept their hats on! A Chinese 
must be a queer beast, since he wears a pig-tail! 
The Hottentot, poor creature, knows no. better 
than to go naked! 
For rational control, it is necessary ‘to reach - 
the real differences in intellect and character, 
unmagnified and undistorted. Further, it is de 
sirable to separate off sharply the direct effect 
of racial differences upon original natures from 
their indirect effect through the different civil 
zations or cultures which happen: to accompany 
them. The influence of the latter belongs prop- 
‘erly under the influence of differences in the en- 
vironment, and will be omitted f from considera- 
tion here. : 
If the original mental natures of a hundred 
Negroes, Chinese, Igorots, and Jews were given 
similar bodily externals and brought up under 
the same environment, would they differ more 
than would a hundred, all Negroes or all Chin~ 
ese ; and if so, how much more atid in what ways? 
That is the present question, / 
It is a pity that so important a question, by 
35
-P-A-G-E-46
INDIVIDUALITY 
the answer to which the treatment of the so- 
called lower by the so-called higher races and 
the treatment of the latter by one another should 
be largely guided, can be only so imperfectly an- 
swered. It is literally true that we know how to 
breed and train plants far better than we know 
how to breed and train men for important traits 
of human nature. Of the detailed significance of 
the heredity belonging to each of the races and 
sub-races of men, little or nothing is known. I 
.can only illustrate the attitude which a student 
of the topic should take and the general direc- 
tion in which the truth may be expected to lie. 
This will be done in the case of racial differences 
in general intellect. 
The first fact to note is that racial differences 
in_ original nature are not mere myths. For ex- 
ample, the colored pupils in the public high 
schools of New York City represent probably at 
least as good a selection intellectually from the 
offspring of Negroes and Negro-white crosses 
as do the white pupils from the offspring of pure 
white matings. Any superiority of the white to 
the colored pupils is almost certainly equaled 
36
-P-A-G-E-47
THE INFLUENCE OF RACE 
by the difference between the white race and the 
Negro race. Yet the white pupils are demonstra- 
bly superior in scholarship, as shown in Figure 12. 
  20 40 60° 80 100 Fic. 12. The Relative Frequencies of Different Marks in the High 
School inthe cases of White Pupils (continuous line) and Colored 
. Pupils (broken lines). 
The differences in the environment do not seem 
at all adequate to account for the superiority of 
37
-P-A-G-E-48
INDIVIDUALITY 
the whites. To take the one other case of meas- 
urements of the intellectual capacities of different 
races, Woodworth found that the best of the 
Negritos and reputed Pygmies just reached the 
average European in a simple test of practical 
intellect. 
The second fact to note is that the differences 
in intellect due to race, though real, are in gen- 
eral small. In the test by Professor Woodworth, 
just mentioned, only small differences were found 
between the Europeans and Indians, Eskimos, 
Ainus, Filipinos, and Singhalese. 
This may seem irreconcilable with the testi- 
mony given by the history and present status of 
races. If racial achievement were a fair measure 
of intellect, there would be a real contradiction. 
But achievement is a measure of ability only if 
conditions are equal. Two important conditions 
are the size of the racial group and its communi- 
cation with other races. A small race, though of 
equal average intellect with a larger race, has 
not so great a probability of generating an ex- 
treme variation, —a man of extraordinary ability, 
whose discoveries and practices uplift all who can 
38
-P-A-G-E-49
THE INFLUENCE OF NEAR ANCESTRY 
learn or imitate them. An isolated race in the 
same way loses the means of progress which 
come from borrowed ideas and practices. 
The third fact of importance is the overlap- 
ping. The superiority of a race does not mean 
the superiority of all its members to all those of 
the other race, That never happens; and ordi- 
narily the two distributions overlap for nine 
tenths of their extent along the scale. Even when 
the average of one race is, say, ten percent more 
gifted than the average of another, there will still 
be about nine out of ten of the inferior race who 
will surpass the worst representative of the su- 
Perior race, and about four out of ten who will 
Surpass the average man of the superior race. 
There is, then, hardly a more stupid way of get- 
ting individuals of superior original nature than 
to choose them by race. The variation of original 
individuality within any one race is too wide. 
THE INFLUENCE OF NEAR ANCESTRY 
Within any one of the larger groups that we 
call races there are many strains or “lines,” so 
that, as every one sees in the case of physical 
39
-P-A-G-E-50
"INDIVIDUALITY 
traits, individuals of the same sex, race, and train- 
ing still differ widely. The same is true of traits 
of intellect and character. In them also individ- 
uals of the same sex and race differ in ways and 
to degrees that differences in training cannot 
account for. As will be shown later, the exact 
dividing line between the influence of inheritance 
and the influence of environment or training is 
subject to dispute, but every one who has inves- 
tigated the facts carefully admits that the former 
has some influence. Mental and moral inherit- 
ance from near ancestry is a fact, 
A human being develops from, and in his ori- 
ginal nature és, an ovum, or germ-cell from the 
mother, fused with a sperm, or germ-cel] from 
the father. A germ-cell from any parent is always 
one of many produced by that parent. These 
vary amongst themselves, so that the possible 
heredity from any one parent is far wider and 
richer than his own nature.. A man gives to his - 
children, not one thing, himself, but his manifold 
germs, With respect to any trait, the germs from 
one parent vary, however, much less than do the 
germs from all the parents in, that race. 
40 ,
-P-A-G-E-51
THE INFLUENCE OF NEAR ANCESTRY 
. Let us call that element or constituent of a 
germ which tends to produce, in the individual 
who develops from it, a given feature of intellect 
or character, that feature’s determiner. Then the 
fact just mentioned may be stated in this form: 
Gérms from the same individual differ in their 
determiners; germs from different individuals 
.of the same race differ still more; germs from 
individuals of different races, still more. 
Inheritance is at bottom a matter of the rela- 
‘ tions of germs one to another. A parent resem- 
bles his offspring because the germ that produced 
him produced also the-germs that produce them. 
He differs from his offspring and they differ 
among themselves for the same reason, The 
difference is due to the fact that germs produced 
by one germ vary. The likeness is due to the 
fact that they vary Jess than germs produced by 
many. ; 
Ourinferences about heredity, however, have to 
be made from the resemblances and differences 
of the individuals who develop from the germs. 
The study of mental and moral heredity is thus 
the study of the greater resemblance or less 
41
-P-A-G-E-52
INDIVIDUALITY 
difference of related than of unrelated individ- 
uals. 
The measurements of the influence of near an- 
cestry upon individuality have naturally taken 
the form of measurements of the greater resem- 
blances of related individuals, rather than of 
the greater differences of unrelated individuals. 
Samples of the results obtained are the follow- 
ing: Call the average likeness of two persons 
of the same sex and race, but not near kin, zero. 
Call perfect similarity 1. Then the resemblance 
‘of father to son in general intellect and also in 
moral worth is, according to Woods,’ about .4. 
The resemblance of brother to brother or sister 
in various mental traits is, according to Pearson, 
about .5. The resemblance of twins in ability to 
add and multiply, in finding the misspelled words 
in a passage, and in other mental tests is about .8. 
It would be too long a task. to rehearse the 
evidence from which it appears that these resem- 
blances are due only slightly to resemblances in 
home training. Sample arguments are the follow- 
1 Allowance being made for certain facts not taken account 
of by Professor Woods himself.

ing: Twins are found to grow no more alike 
from nine to fourteen, in spite of the fact that 
any influence home training may have upon abil- 
ity to add, multiply, and the like should be far 
gréater after so much longer action. They are 
found to be as much alike in finding misspelled 
words or giving the opposites of words as in add- 
ing or multiplying, though, presumably, home 
training should count more in the latter. Also 
the home training of twins does not seem to be 
very much more constant than that of two chil- 
dren of the same family, two or three years apart 
in age; but the resemblance is twice as great. 
On the whole, intellectual and moral individu. 
ality seems to be determined to a very large ex- 
tent in the germs all human beings were given 
“exactly the same ‘raining, subjected to exactly 
the same influences from the time of their con- ~ 
ception, they would still differ wide) Hygiene, 
medicine, education, and all social forces have to 
reckon with original differences in men. Their 
aims, means, and methods must be adapted to fit 
hot one nature, but many.

THE INFLUENCE OF EDUCATION 
The intellect and character given to an indi- 
vidual by sex, race, and near ancestry furnish 
the starting point for the general education 
which he gets from the fortunes of life and the 
special education which society prescribes for 
his and its own good. Sometimes these environ- 
mental forces bring him into conformity with 
others, rounding off the corners of his individual- 
ity to make it more like the type: in other cases 
the environment increases initial differences and 
adds to the total variety of human nature. To — 
what extent the differences that come to exist 
amongst individuals are to be attributed to dif- 
ferences in their nurture, is known uncertainly, 
if at all. I shall attempt only to show the atti- 
tude a thinker must take toward the general 
question. 
There is no doubt ‘thaf differences in home, 
school, books, friends, political status, and the 
like, may cause differences in the intellect and 
character which a man comes to possess}— in his 
eventual nature. Two identical origina} natures, 
44
-P-A-G-E-55
THE INFLUENCE OF EDUCATION 
if brought up in 1900 B..c. and 1900 A. D,, or in 
Berlin and Pekin, would result in very differént 
eventual natures. The Japanese of to-day are 
probably almost or quite identical, in original 
nature, with their great-grandfathers. All or 
nearly all of the differences between the two 
groups are attributable to differences in environ- 
ment. Any man’s individuality is determined in 
large measure by his language, occupation, reli- 
gion, customs, and ideas. These again are deter- 
mined in large measure by his nurture. 
But the influence of the environment is sub- 
ject to two important limitations. Any environ- 
mental force has far less effect if it is avoidable. 
If a boy born in China can, if his nature suffi- 
ciently impels, go to a modern school, the influ- 
ence of the old-fashioned Chinese schools, even 
though they outnumber the modern schools a 
hundred to one, is far less than if they are the 
unavoidable form of education. 
If the custom of slavery is universal, men who 
are by original nature just and humane will in- 
humanly deprive the babies born in slavery of 
common human rights. But if the custom.is called 
45
-P-A-G-E-56
INDIVIDUALITY 
in question at all, so that the force of society's 
approval of it is avoidable, —if a man can flee in 
fact or in thought to the company of those who 
distrust slavery,—then the effective force of 
that. custom is enormously weakened. A man 
may, in respect to it, determine his eventual na- 
ture by his original nature. 
Similarly, before any alcoholic beverages were 
known, no man, however intemperate his origi- 
nal nature, could be a dipsomaniac. But, once 
total abstinence is avoidable, the determination 
of a man’s behavior toward liquor may be made 
largely by his original nature. He may shut his 
ears to all tales of the misery caused by drink, 
may not attend to any of the facts which would 
facilitate abstinence, may respond to all restrain- 
ing forces by neglect, and seek out, as a result 
of the inner impulsion of his inborn make-up, 
the rare opportunities for alcoholic intoxication. 
The second limitation to any environmental 
force is that it acts differentially, the result 
being determined by the original nature acted 
upon as well as by the force itself. Even in

of welcome. Being slaves does not make all 
men slavish, much less equally slavish. Evil 
| communications may ennoble the manners of 
some men. “The environmental stimulus ade- 
quate to arouse a certain power or ideal or 
habit in one man may be hopelessly inadequate 
todo so in another. Washing bottles in a drug- 
shop was, if a common story is true, adequate 
to decide Faraday’s career ; and the voyage on 
the Beagle is reputed to have made Darwin a 
,haturalist for life. But if all the youth of the 
land were put to work in drug-shops and later 
sent on scientific expeditions, the result would 
not be a million Faradays and Darwins, or even 
a million chemists and naturalists, All that one 
man may need to be free is a vote; but even a 
long education in self-direction may be inade- 
quate for another. Being told a few words suf- 
fices to secure the habit of reading in one child, 
while the child beside him remains illiterate after 
two years of careful tuition. The amount of 
stimulus required in some cases is so infinitesi- 
mal that the power seems to spring absolutely 
from the man himself. In other men no agency

is found potent enough to arouse a trace of the 
desired result.” 
As a result of these limitations, it is hard to 
find differences between one and another man 
of the same era and general social condition that 
are clearly due to differences in training. The 
great scholar is not made by attendance at a 
university ; rather his own nature made him 
seek that influence scorned by so many others. 
Many a drunkard remains so in spite of fewer 
temptations. Saloons being inaccessible, he 
drinks at home; whiskey being debarred, he 
takes to “bitters” or paterit medicines; one 
suspects that if alcohol did not exist, he would 
soon discover cocaine. Each nature in some 
measure selects its own environment, and each 
nature may get from an environment a different 
influence, so that the relative achievements of, 
say, the boys who this year begin school in 
America, will probably be more closely parallel 
to their relative original talents and interests 
than to their relative advantages in home and 
school environment.

THE SIGNIFICANCE OF INDIVIDUAL DIP- 
FERENCES 
We have seen that individuals differ in what- 
ever trait of intellect or character is examined. 
The variations from the ordinary, common, or 
typical man range continuously to such extreme 
conditions as appear in the idiot and the genius, 
or Nero and Lincoln. But the great majority 
cluster somewhat closely around the “average 
man.” Clear and useful divisions into separate 
Glasses are impossible with respect to either the 
amount of some single trait or the total consti- 
tution of the mind. : 
The differences that characterize men of the 
same time, country, and social status are largely 
original, determined directly by the germs from 
which the individual develops, and so indirectly 
by the ancestry from which he springs. Each 
original nature has so great power of selecting 
and avoiding the forces of social and educational 
49
-P-A-G-E-60
INDIVIDUALITY 
environment that the fundamental powers, in- 
terests, and ideals of such men are largely de- 
termined before they are born. Over the par- 
ticular connections with ideas which we call 
knowledge, and the particular connections with 
acts which we call skill, training has greater 
power ; and, of course, unavoidable differences 
in training, such as go with differences between 
1700 and 1900, England and China, slave and 
free, are far more potent. 
All the sciences and arts of controlling hu- 
man nature must accept the original variety of 
human nature as a condition for thought and 
action. The economist must not consider men 
as all seeking with steadfast rationality to buy as 
cheap and sell as dear as they can. The religious 
worker should not hope to arouse uniformly the 
same sense of guilt and longing for justification 
to which he and his intimates testify. The 
scholar may as well expect all men to be pas- 
sionately eager to use the left rather than the 
right hand, as expect them to prefer linguistic 
or mathematical erudition to ignorance. The 
teacher who has not learned by ordinary experi-

ence that each child is to some extent a separate 
problem, demanding for his best interest an edu- 
cational theory and practice to fit 4, should 
“learn it once for all from psychological theory. 
{Specialization of schools is needed not only to 
fit pupils for special professions, arts, trades, and 
the like, but also to fit the schools to original 
‘differences in the popils) Specialization of in- 
struction for different pupils within one class is 
needed as well as specialization of the curriculum 
for different classes. Since human nature does 
not fall into sharply defined groups, we can lit- 
erally never be sure of having a dozen pupils 
who need to be treated exactly alike. 
All thought and action will be more reason- 
able and humane if we look for variety in men 
and examine each nature in a scientific spirit to 
learn what it really is, instead of idly judging it 
by some customary superstition. For example, 
the most pitiful waste and unreason in human 
affairs is behavior whereby one makes himself 
suffer to secure for another a good which is to 
the other a nuisance or a pain. A parent who 
sacrifices his own joys to protect his children

INDIVIDUALITY 
against the healthy, beloved, and noble struggles 
of life; a philanthropist who lessens his own 
welfare to teach factory-workers refinements, 
knowledge of which can only embitter their in- 
ability to secure them; a religion that spends 
life in stimulating the fears and worries of men 
whom fear and worry will never lead to right 
living, but only to more worry and fear, —in 
such gratuitous miseries, false diagnosis of hu- 
man hearts is prolific. 
“>fThe most necessary elements in the life of- 
“reason and justice are, first, an awareness of 
what individual human natures really are and 
really want; and then an appreciation of the rela- 
tive worth of the myriads of wants thus revealed. 
This valuation of human wants, in turn, is im- 
proved chiefly by knowing what they are and how 
each competes or codperates with all the others. 
Only in proportion as such a science of. the 
nature and behavior of individual men exists 
can man know what his duty is or know how to 
do it.

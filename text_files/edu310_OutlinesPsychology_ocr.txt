TRANSLATOR’S PREFACE. 
Tus translation has been made with the cooperation of 
the author, who has not only contributed many valuable 
criticisms and suggestions in regard to terminology, but has 
‘read all the proof-sheets as they were being prepared for 
the press. A few verbal changes have been introduced into 
the text with a view to making the discussion somewhat 
clearer. 
The difficulties that arise in choosing English equivalents 
for many German words, are too familiar to require detailed 
discussion. The translator has derived assistance in this 
respect from a comparison of other standard translations, 
especially the English versions of Falckenberg’s “History 
of Modern Philosophy”, Wundt’s “Lectures on Human and 
Animal Psychology”, and Ktilpe’s “Outlines of Psychology”. 
The terminology here employed differs, however, at many 
points from that used in the works mentioned. A glossary 
of the principal terms has been added for the benefit of 
those familiar with the German. The translation of the word 
“Perception” is unusual. If it were translated ‘perception’ it 
would be easily confused, especially in its verbal forms, with 
the only possible equivalent of “Wahrnehmung’, “wahr- 
nehmen”, and “Anschauung”. Since the process referred to 
"72-O2522

  Iv Iranslator’s Preface. 
by “Perception” is so entirely different from that indicated 
by the English word perception, it seemed best to employ a 
word whose signification is not so fixed. Apprehension was, 
accordingly, used, and the danger of confusing it with the 
translation of “Auffassung” was for the most part avoided 
by using other equivalents for the latter. 
The thanks of the translator are due to the author for 
his courtesy throughout the progress of the work. Mr. G. H. 
Stempel has kindly aided in the task of preparing the proof- 
sheets for the press.

AUTHOR'S PREFACE, 
Tins book has been written primarily for the purpose of 
furnishing my students with a brief manual to supplement the 
lectures on Psychology. At the same time it aims to give 
the wider circle of scientific scholars who are interested in 
psychology, either for its own sake or for the sake of its 
applications, a systematic survey of the tundamentally im- 
portant results and doctrines of modern psychology. In view 
of this double purpose, I have limited myself in detailing 
facts to that which is most important, or to the examples that 
serve most directly the ends of illustration, and have omitted 
entirely those aids to demonstration and experiment which 
are properly made use of in the lecture-room. The fact that 
I have based this treatise on the doctrines that I have come 
to hold as valid after long years of labor in this field, needs 
no special justification. Still, I have not neglected to point 
out both in a general characterization (Introduction § 2), and 
with references in detail, the chief theories that differ from 
the one here presented. 
The relation in which this book stands to my earlier 
psychological works will be apparent after what has been 
said. The “Grundxiige der physiologischen Psychologie” aims 
to bring the means employed by the natural sciences,
-P-A-G-E-6

especially by physiology, into the service of psychology, and to 
give a critical presentation of the experimental methods of 
psychology, which have developed in the last few decades, 
together with their chicf results. This special problem ren- 
dered necessary a relative subordination of the general psy- 
chological points of view. The second, revised edition of 
the “Vorlesungen tiber die Menschen- und Thierseele”') (the 
first edition has long been out of date) seeks to give a more 
popular account of the character and purpose of experimental 
psychology, and to discuss from the position thus defined 
those psychological questions which are also of more general 
philosophical importance. While the treatment in the “G@rand- 
xtige” is, accordingly, determined, in the main, by the relations 
of psychology to physiology, and the treatment in the * Vor- 
lesungen” by philosophical interests, this Oudlines aims to 
present psychology in its own proper coherency, and in the 
systematic order that the nature of the subject-matter seems 
to me to require. In doing this, however, it takes up only 
what is most important and essential. It is my hope that 
this book will not be an entirely unwelcome addition even 
for those readers who are familiar with my earlier works as 
well as with the discussion of the “Logik der Psychologie” 
in my “Logik der Geisteswissenschaften” (Logik, 2. Aufl. 1, 
2. Abth.). 
I have not thought it necessary to repeat here the refer- 
ences to psychological works, in view of the fact that I have 
given such references very fully under the various heads in 
my “Grundsiige”. The reader who wishes to make a more

thorough study of any particular question will turn in any 
case to the more elaborate work. For the literature that has 
appeared in this department since the fourth edition of the 
“Grundxiige” (1893), the reader has but to refer to the last 
volumes of the various periodicals devoted to psychology: to 
the “Philosophische Studien”, the “Zeitschrift fiir Psychologie 
und Physiologie der Sinnesorgane”, the “American Journal 
of Psychology”, and the “Psychological Review”. The last 
three contain also reviews of the current literature in psy- 
chology. As a recent addition to these the “Psychologischen 
Arbeiten” edited by E. Kraepelin and devoted especially to 
individual characterology and practical psychology, may be 
mentioned.

INTRODUCTION. 
§ 1. PROBLEM OF PSYCHOLOGY. 
1. Two definitions of psychology have been the most 
prominent: in the history of this science. According to 
one, psychology is the “science of mind”: psychical processes 
are regarded as phenomena from which it is possible to 
infer the nature of an underlying metaphysical mind-sub- 
stance. According to the other, psychology is the “science 
of inner experience”: psychical processes are here looked 
upon as belonging to a specific form of experience, which 
is readily distinguished by the fact that its contents are 
known through “introspection”, or the “inner sense” as 
it has been called to distinguish it from sense-perception 
through the outer senses. 
Neither of these definitions, however, is satisfactory to 
the psychology of to-day. The first, or metaphysical, defini- 
tion belongs to a period of development that lasted longer 
in this science than in others. But it is here too forever 
left behind, since psychology has developed into an empirical 
discipline, operating with methods of its own; and since the 
“mental sciences” have gained recognition as a great de- 
partment of scientific investigation, distinct from the sphere 
of the natural sciences, and requiring as a general ground- 
work an independent psychology, free from all metaphysical 
theories.

  2 Introduction. 
The second, or empirical, definition, which sees in psychol- 
ogy a “science of inner experience”, is inadequate because 
it may give rise to the misunderstanding that psychology has 
to do with objects totally different from those of the so- 
called “outer experience”. It is, indeed, true that there are 
contents of experience which belong in the sphere of psycho- 
logical investigation, but are not to be found among the 
objects and processes studied by natural science: such are 
our feelings, emotions, and decisions. On the other hand, 
there is not a single natural phenomenon that may not, 
from a different point of view, become an object of psychol- 
ogy. A stone, a plant, a tone, a ray of light, are, as nat- 
ural phenomena, objects of mineralogy, botany, physics, etc.; 
but in so far as they arouse in us ideas, they are at the 
same time objects of psychology. For psychology seeks to 
account for the genesis of these ideas, and for their rela- 
tions both to other ideas and to those psychical processes 
not referred to external objects, such as feelings, volitions, etc. 
There is, then, no such thing as an “inner sense” which 
can be regarded as an organ of introspection, and thus dis- 
tinct from the outer senses, or organs of objective perception. * 
Ideas, whose attributes psychology seeks to investigate, arise 
through the outer senses no less than do the sense-percep- 
tions on which natural science is based; while the subjective 
activities of feeling, emotion, and volition, which are neglected 
in natural science, are not known through special organs, but 
are directly and inseparably connected with the ideas referred 
to external objects. 
2. It follows, then, that the expressions outer and inner 
experience do not indicate different objects, but different 
points of view from which we start in the consideration and 
scientific treatment of a unitary experience. We are natur- 
ally led to these points of view, because every concrete ex- 
 
-P-A-G-E-21

perience immediately divides into two factors: into a content 
presented to us, and our apprehension of this content. We 
call the first of these factors objects of experience, the second 
experiencing subject. This division points out two directions 
for the treatment of experience. One is that of the natwral 
sciences, which concern themselves with the objects of ex- 
perience, thought of as independent of the subject. The other 
is that of psychology, which investigates the whole content 
of experience in its relations to the subject and in its attri- 
butes derived directly from the subject. The standpoint of 
natural science may, accordingly, be designated as that of 
mediate experience, since it is possible only after abstracting 
from the subjective factor present in all actual experience; 
the standpoint of psychology, on the other hand, may be 
designated as that of immediate experience, since it purposely 
does away with this abstraction and all its consequences. 
3. The assignment of this problem to psychology, making 
it an empirical science coordinate with natural science and 
supplementary to it, is justified by the method of all the 
mental sciences, for which psychology furnishes the basis. All 
of these sciences, philology, history, and political and social 
science, have for their subject-matter immediate experience 
as determined by the interaction of objects with the knowing 
and acting subject. None of the mental sciences employs 
the abstractions and hypothetical supplementary concepts of 
natural science; quite otherwise, they all accept ideas and the 
accompanying subjective activities as immediate reality. The 
effort is then made to explain the single components of this 
reality through their mutual interconnections. This method 
of psychological interpretation employed in the mental sciences, 
must also be the mode of procedure in psychology itself, 
being the method required by the subject-matter of psychol- 
ogy, the immediate reality of experience.

3a. Since natural science investigates the content of ex- 
perience after abstracting from the experiencing subject, its 
problem is usually stated as the acquirement of “knowledge of 
the outer world”. By the expression outer world is meant the 
sum total of all the objects presented in experience. The problem 
of psychology has sometimes been correspondingly defined as 
“self-knowledge of the subject”. This definition is, however, 
inadequate because the interaction of the subject with the outer 
world and with other similar subjects is just as much a prob- 
lem of psychology as are the attributes of the single subject. 
Furthermore, the expression can easily be interpreted to mean 
that outer world and subject are separate components of ex- 
perience or that they can at least be distinguished as inde- 
pendent contents of experience, whereas, in truth, outer ex- 
perience is always connected with the apprehending and knowing 
functions of the subject, and inner experience always contains 
ideas from the outer world as indispensable components. This 
interconnection is the necessary result of the fact that in 
reality experience is not a mere juxtaposition of different ele- 
ments, but a single organized whole which requires in each of 
its components the subject that apprehends the content, and the 
objects that are presented as content. For this reason natural 
science can not abstract from the knowing subject entirely, but 
only from those attributes of the subject which either disappear 
entirely when we remove the subject in thought, as, the feel- 
ings, or from those which, on the ground of physical researches, 
must be regarded as belonging to the subject, as, the quali- 
ties of sensations. Psychology, on the contrary, has as its sub- 
ject of treatment the total content of experience in its imme- 
diate character. 
The only ground, then, for the division between natural 
science on the one hand, and psychology and the mental sciences 
on the other, is to be found in the fact that all experience 
contains as its factors a content objectively presented, and an ex- 
periencing subject. Still, it is by no means necessary that 
logical definitions of these two factors should precede the sep- 
aration of the sciences from one another, for it is obvious that 
such definitions are possible only after they have a basis in the 
investigations of natural science and of psychology. All that it is 
   
-P-A-G-E-23
  
$1. Problem of Psychology. 5 
necessary to presuppose from the first, is the consciousness which 
accompanies all experience, that in this experience objects are 
being presented to a subject. There can be no assumption of 
a knowledge of the conditions upon which the distinetion is 
based, or of the definite characteristics by which one factor can 
be distinguished from the other. Even the use of the terms 
object and subject in this connection must be regarded as the 
application to the first stage of experience, of distinctions which 
are reached only by developed logical reflection. 
The forms of interpretation in natural science and psychol- 
ogy are supplementary not only in the sense that the first 
considers objects after abstracting, as far as possible, from the 
subject, while the second has to do with the part the subject 
plays in the rise of experience; but they are also supplementary 
in the sense that each takes a different point of view in con- 
sidering the single contents of experience. Natural science seeks 
to discover the nature of objects without reference to the sub- 
ject. The knowledge that it produces is therefore mediate or 
conceptual. In place of the immediate objects of experience, it 
sets concepts gained from these objects by abstracting from the 
subjective components of our ideas. This abstraction makes it 
necessary, continually to supplement reality with hypothetical 
elements. Scientific analysis shows that many components of 
experience — as, for example, sensations — are subjective effects 
of objective processes. These objective processes in their ob- 
jective character, independent of the subject, can therefore never 
be a part of experience. Science makes up for this lack by 
forming supplementary hypothetical concepts of the objective 
properties of matter. Psychology, on the other hand, investigates 
the contents of experience in their complete and actual form, 
both the ideas that ure referred to objects, and all the sub- 
jective processes that cluster about them. Its knowledge is, 
therefore, immediate and perceptual: perceptual in the broad sense 
of the term in which not only sense-perceptions, but all concrete 
reality is distinguished from all that is abstract and conceptual 
in thought. Psychology van exhibit the interconnection of the 
contents of experience as .ctually presented to the subject, only 
by avoiding entirely the abstractions and supplementary concepts of 
natural science. ‘Thus, while natural science and psychology are

  6 Introduction. 
both empirical sciences in the sense that they aim to explain the 
contents of experience, though from different points of view, still 
it is obvious that, in consequence of the character of its problem, 
psychology is the more strictly empirical. 
§ 2. GENERAL THEORIES OF PSYCHOLOGY. 
1. The view that psychology is an empirical science which 
deals, not with specific contents of experience, but with the 
immediate contents of all experience, is of recent origin. It 
still encounters in the science of to-day oppositional views, 
which are to be looked upon, in general, as the remnants 
of earlier stages of development, and which are in turn 
arrayed against one another according to their attitudes on 
the question of the relation of psychology to philosophy and 
to the other sciences. On the basis of the two definitions 
mentioned above (§ 1, 1) as being the most widely accepted, 
two chief theories of psychology may be distinguished: meta- 
physical and empirical psychology. Each is further divided 
into a number of special tendencies. 
Metaphysical psychology generally values very little the 
empirical analysis and causal synthesis of psychical processes. 
Regarding psychology as a part of philosophical meta- 
physics, its chief effort is directed toward the discovery of 
a definition of the “nature of mind” that shall be in accord 
with the whole theory of the metaphysical system to which 
the particular psychology belongs. After a metaphysical con- 
cept of mind has thus been established, the attempt is made 
to deduce from it the actual content of psychical experi- 
ence. The characteristic that distinguishes metaphysical from 
empirical psychology is, then, its attempt to deduce psychical 
processes, not from other psychical processes, but from some
-P-A-G-E-25
  
$2. General Theories of Psychology. a 
substratum entirely unlike themselves: either from the mani- 
festations of a special mind-substance, or from the attributes 
and processes of matter. At this point metaphysical psy- 
chology branches off in two directions. Spiritualistic psychol- 
ogy considers psychical processes as the manifestations of a 
specific mind-substance, which is regarded either as essen- 
tially different from matter (dualism), or as related in nature 
to matter (monism or monadology). The fundamental meta- 
physical doctrine of spiritualistic psychology is the assumption 
of the supersensible nature of mind and, in connection with 
this, the assumption of its immortality. Sometimes the 
further notion of preexistence is also added. Materialistic 
psychology, on the other hand, refers psychical processes to 
the same material substratum which natural science employs 
for the explanation of natural phenomena. According to this 
view, psychical processes, like physical vital processes, are 
connected with certain organizations of material particles 
which are formed during the life of the individual and broken 
up at the end of that life. The metaphysical character of 
this trend of psychology is determined by its denial of the 
supersensible nature of mind as asserted by spiritualistic 
psychology. Both theories have this in common, thaf they 
seek, not to interpret psychical experience from experience 
itself, but to derive it from presuppositions about hypothetical 
processes in a metaphysical substratum. 
2. From the strife that followed these attempts at meta- 
physical explanation, empirical psychology arose. Wherever 
it is consistently carried out, it strives either to arrange 
psychical processes under general concepts derived directly 
from the interconnection of these processes themselves, or to 
start with certain, as a rule simpler processes, and then ex- 
plain the more complicated as the result of the interaction 
of those with which it started. There may be various fun-
-P-A-G-E-26
  
& Introduction. 
damental principles for such an empirical interpretation, and 
thus it becomes possible to distinguish several varieties of 
empirical psychology. In general, these may be classified 
according to two principles of division. The first has refer- 
ence to the relation of inner and outer experience, and the 
attitude that the two empirical sciences, natural science and 
psychology, take toward each other. The second has reference 
to the facts or concepts derived from these facts, which are 
used for the interpretation of psychical processes. Every 
system of empirical psychology has its place under both of 
these principles of classification. 
8. On the general question as to the nature of psychical 
experience, the two views already mentioned (§ 1) on account 
of their decisive significance in determining the problem of 
psychology, stand over against each other: psychology of the 
immer sense, and psychology as the science of immediate ex- 
perience. The first treats psychical processes as contents of 
a special sphere of experience coordinate with the experience 
which, derived through the outer senses, is assigned as the 
province of the natural sciences, but though coordinate, 
totally different from it. The second recognizes no real 
difference between inner and outer experience, but finds the 
distinction only in the different points of view from which 
unitary experience is considered in the two cases. 
The first of these two varieties of empirical psychology is 
the older. It arose primarily from the effort to establish 
the independence of psychical observation, in opposition to the 
encroachments of natural philosophy. In thus coordinating 
natural science and psychology, it sees the justification for 
the equal recognition of both spheres in their entirely differ- 
ent objects and modes of perceiving these objects. This view 
has influenced empirical psychology in two ways. First, it 
favored the opinion that psychology should employ empirical 
 
-P-A-G-E-27
$2. General Theories of Psychology. 9 
methods, but that these methods, like psychological experience, 
should be fundamentally different from those of natural science. 
Secondly, it gave rise to the necessity of showing some con- 
nection or other between these two kinds of experience, 
which were supposed to be different. In regard to the first 
demand, it was chiefly the psychology of the inner sense that 
developed the method of pure introspection (§ 3, 2). In at- 
tempting to solve the second question, this psychology was 
necessarily driven back to a metaphysical basis, because of 
its assumption of a difference between the physical and the 
psychical contents of experience. For, from the very nature of 
the case, it is impossible to account for the relations of 
inner to outer experience, or for the so-called “interaction 
between body and mind”, from the position here taken, 
except through metaphysical presuppositions. These presuppo- 
sitions must then, in turn, effect the psychological investigation 
itself in such a way as to result in the importation of meta- 
physical hypotheses into it. 
4. Essentially distinct from the psychology of the inner 
sense is the trend that defines psychology as the “science of im- 
mediate experience”. Regarding, as it does, outer and inner 
experience, not as different parts of experience, but as different 
ways of looking at one and the same experience, it can not 
admit any fundamental difference between the methods of 
psychology and those of natural science. It has, therefore, 
sought most of all to cultivate experimental methods which 
shall lead to just such an exact analysis of psychical processes 
as that which the explanatory natural sciences undertake in 
the ease of natural phenomena, the only differences being 
those which arise from the diverse points of view. It holds 
also that the special mental sciences which have to do with 
concrete mental processes and creations, stand on this same 
basis of a scientific consideration of the immediate contents of
-P-A-G-E-28
  10 Introduction. 
experience and of their relations to acting subjects. It follows, 
then, that psychological analysis of the most general mental 
products, such as language, mythological ideas, and laws of 
custom, is to be regarded as an aid to the understanding of 
all the more complicated psychical processes. In its methods, 
then, this trend of psychology stands in close relation to other 
sciences: as experimental psychology, to the natural sciences; 
as social psychology, to the special mental sciences. 
Finally, from this point of view, the question of the rela- 
tion between psychical and physical objects disappears en- 
tirely. They are not different objects at all, but one and the 
same content of experience, looked at in one case — in that 
of the natural sciences — after abstracting from the subject, 
in the other — in that of psychology — in their immediate 
character and complete relations to the subject. All meta- 
physical hypotheses as to the relation of psychical and phy- 
sical objects are, when viewed from this position, attempts to 
solve a problem that never would have existed if the case 
had been correctly stated. Though psychology must dispense 
with metaphysical supplementary hypotheses in regard to the 
interconnection of psychical processes, because these processes 
are the immediate contents of experience, still another meth- 
od of procedure is open from the very fact that inner and 
outer experience are supplementary points of view. Wherever 
breaks appear in the interconnection of psychical processes, 
it is allowable to carry on the investigation according to the 
physical methods of considering these same processes, in order 
to discover whether the lacking coherency can be thus supplied. 
The same holds for the reverse method of filling up the 
breaks in the continuity of our physiological knowledge, by 
means of elements derived from psychological investigation. 
Only on the basis of such a view, which sets the two forms 
of knowledge in their true relation, is it possible for psychol-
-P-A-G-E-29
$3. General Theories of Psychology. 41 
ogy to become in the fullest sense an empirical science. 
Only in this way, too, can physiology become the true supple- 
mentary science of psychology, and: psychology, on the other 
hand, the auxiliary of physiology. 
5. Under the second principle of classification mentioned 
above (2), that is, according to the facts or concepts with which 
the investigation of psychical processes starts, there are two 
varieties of empirical psychology to be distinguished. They 
are, at the same time, successive stages in the development 
of psychological interpretation, The first corresponds to a 
descriptive, the second to an explanatory stage. The attempt to 
present a discriminating description of the different jsychical 
processes, gave rise to the need of an appropriate class?- 
fication. Class-concepts were formed, under which the various 
processes were grouped; and the attempt was made to satisfy 
the need of an interpretation in each particular case, by sub- 
suming the components of a given compound process under 
their proper class-concepts. Such concepts are, for example, 
sensation, knowledge, attention, memory, imagination, under- 
standing, and will. They correspond to the general concepts 
of physics which are derived from the immediate apprehension 
of natural phenomena, such as weight, heat, sound, and light. 
Like those concepts of physics, these derived psychical con- 
cepts may serve for a first grouping of the facts, but they 
contribute nothing whatever to the explanation of these facts. 
Still, empirical psychology has often been guilty of confound- 
ing this description with explanation. Thus, the faculty- 
psychology considered these class-concepts as psychical forces 
or faculties, and referred psychical processes to thcir alter- 
nating or. united activity. 
6. Opposed to this method of treatment found in the 
descriptive faculty-psychology, is that of explanatory psychol- 
ogy. When consistently empirical, the latter must base its inter- 
 
-P-A-G-E-30
12 Introduction. 
pretations on certain facts which themselves belong to psychical 
experience. These facts may, however, be taken from differ- 
ent spheres of psychical processes, and so it comes that 
explanatory treatment may be further divided into two va- 
rieties, which correspond to the two factors, objects and sub- 
ject, that go to make up immediate experience. When the 
chief emphasis is laid on the objects of immediate experience, 
intellectualistic psychology results. This attempts to derive 
all psychical processes, especially the subjective feelings, 
impulses, and volitions, from ¢deas, or intellectual processes as 
they may be called on acount of their importance for objective 
knowledge. If, onthe contrary, the chief emphasis is laid 
on the way in which immediate experience arises in the sub- 
ject, a variety of explanatory psychology results which attri- 
butes to those subjective activities not referred to external 
objects, a position as independent as that assigned to ideas. 
This variety has been called voluntaristic psychology, because 
of the importance that must be conceded to volitional pro- 
cesses in comparison with other subjective processes. 
Of the two varieties of psychology that result from the 
general attitudes on the question of the nature of inner 
experience (3), psychology of the inner sense commonly tends 
towards intellectualism. This is due to the fact that, when 
the inner sense is coordinated with the outer senses, the con- 
tents of psychical experience that first attract consideration 
are those presented as objects to this inner sense, in a manner 
analogous to the presentation of natural objects to the outer 
senses. It is assumed that the character of objects can be 
attributed. to ideas alone of all the contents of psychical 
experience, because they are regarded as images of the ex- 
ternal objects presented to the outer senses. Ideas are, 
accordingly, looked upon as the only real objects of the inner 
sense, while all processes not referred to external objects, as,
-P-A-G-E-31
§ 2. General Theories of Psychology. 13 
for example, the feelings, are interpreted as obscure ideas, or 
ideas related to one’s own body, or, finally, as effects aris- 
ing from combinations of the ideas. 
The psychology of immediate experience (4), on the other 
hand, tends toward voluntarism. It is obvious that here, 
where the chief problem of psychology is held to be the 
investigation of the subjective rise of all experience, special 
attention will be devoted to those factors from which natural 
science abstracts. 
7. Intellectualistic psychology has in the course of its 
development separated into two trends. In one, the logical 
processes of judgment and reasoning are regarded as the 
typical forms of all psychoses; in the other, certain combi- 
nations of successive memory-ideas distinguished by their 
frequency, the so-called associations of ideas, are accepted 
as such. The logical theory is most closely related to the 
popular method of psychological interpretation and is, therefore, 
the older. It still finds some acceptance, however, even in 
modern times. The association-theory arose from the philo- 
sophical empiricism of the last century. The two theories 
stand to a certain extent in antithesis, since the first attempts 
to reduce the totality of psychical processes to higher, while 
the latter seeks to reduce it to lower and, as it is assumed, 
simpler forms of intellectual activity. Both are one-sided, 
and not only fail to explain affective and volitional processes 
on the basis of the assumption with which they start, but 
are not able to give a complete interpretation even of the 
intellectual processes. 
8. The union of psychology of the inner sense with the 
intellectualistic view has led to a peculiar assumption that 
has been in many cases fatal to psychological theory. We 
may define this assumption briefly as the erroneous attribution 
of the nature of things to ideas. Not only was an analogy
-P-A-G-E-32
  
  14 Introduction. 
assumed between the objects of the so-called inner sense and 
those of the outer senses, but the former were regarded as the 
images of the latter; and so it came that the attributes which 
natural science ascribes to external objects, were transferred 
to the immediate objects of the “inner sense”, the ideas. 
The assumption was then made that ideas are themselves 
things, just as much as the external objects to which we refer 
them; that they disappear from consciousness and come back 
into it; that they may, indeed, be more or less intensely 
and clearly perceived, according as the inner sense is stimu- 
lated through the outer senses or not, and according to the 
degree of attention concentrated upon them, but that on the 
whole they remain unchanged in qualitative character. 
9. In all these respects voluntaristie psychology is opposed 
to intellectualism. While the latter assumes an inner sense 
and specific objects of inner experience, voluntarism is closely 
related to the view that inner experience is identical with 
immediate experience. According to this doctrine, the content of 
psychological experience does not consist of a sum of objects, 
but of all that which makes up the process of experience in 
general, that is, of all the experiences of the subject in their 
immediate character, unmodified by abstraction or reflection. 
It follows of necessity that the contents of psychological expe- 
rience should be regarded as an interconnection of processes. 
This concept of process excludes the attribution of an 
objective and more or less permanent character to the con- 
tents 0! psychical experience. Psychical facts are occurrences, 
not obj:-cts; they take place, like all occurrences, in time and 
are never the same at a given point in time as they were 
the preceding moment. In this sense volitions are typical 
for all psychical processes. Voluntaristic psychology does 
not by any means assert that volition is the only real form 
of psychosis, but merely that, with its closely related
-P-A-G-E-33
  § 2. General Theories of Psychology. 415 
feelings and emotions, it is just as essential a component of 
psychological experience as sensations and ideas. It holds, 
further, that all other psychical processes are to be thought 
of after the analogy of volitions, they too being a series of 
continuous changes in time, not a sum of permanent objects, 
as intellectualism generally assumes in consequence of its 
erroneous attribution to ideas of those properties which we 
attribute to external objects. The recognition of the emmediate 
reality of psychological experience excludes the possibility of 
the attempt to derive any particular components of psychical 
phenomena from others specifically different. The analogous 
attempts of metaphysical psychology to reduce all psychological 
experience to the heterogeneous, imaginary processes of a 
hypothetical substratum, are for the same reason inconsistent 
with the real problem of psychology. While it concerns itself, 
however, with immediate experience, psychology assumes from 
the first that all psychical contents contain objective as well 
as subjective factors. These are to be distinguished only through 
deliberate abstraction, and can never appear as really separate 
processes. In fact, immediate experience shows that there are 
no ideas which do not arouse in us feelings and impulses of 
different intensities, and, on the other hand, that a feeling or 
volition is impossible which does not refer to some ideated object. 
10. The governing principles of the psychological position 
maintained in the following chapters may be summed up in 
three general statements. 
1) Inner, or psychological, experience is not a special sphere 
of experience apart from others, but is émmediate experience 
in its totality. 
2) This immediate experience is- not made up of unchang- 
ing contents, but of an interconnection of processes; not of 
objects, but of occurrences, of universal human experiences 
and their relations in accordance with certain laws.
-P-A-G-E-34
  
16 Introduction. 
3) Each of these processes contains an objective content 
and a subjective process, thus including the general con- 
ditions both of all knowledge and of all practical human 
activity. 
Corresponding to these three general principles, we have 
a threefold attitude of psychology to the other sciences. 
1) As the science of immediate experience, it is sepple- 
mentary to the natural sciences, which, in consequence of 
their abstraction from the subject, have to do only with the 
objective, mediate contents of experience. Any particular 
fact can, strictly speaking, be understood in its full sig- 
nificance only after is has been subjected to the analyses of 
both natural science and psychology. In this sense, then, 
physics and physiology are auxiliary to psychology, and the 
latter is, in turn, supplementary to the natural sciences. 
2) As the science of the universal forms of immediate 
human experience and their combination in accordance with 
certain laws, it is the foundation of the mental sciences. The 
subject-matter of these sciences is in all cases the activities 
proceding from immediate human experiences, and their effects. 
Since psychology has for its problem the investigation of the 
forms and laws of these activities, it is at once the most 
general mental science, and the foundation for all the 
others, such as philology, history, political economy, juris- 
prudence, etc. 
3) Since psychology pays equal attention to both the 
subjective and objective conditions which underlie not only 
theoretical knowledge, but practical activity as well, and since 
it seeks to determine their interrelation, it is the empirical dis- 
cipline whose results are most immediately useful in the in- 
vestigution of the general problems of the theory of know- 
ledge :nd ethics, the two foundations of philosophy. Thus, 
psycho ogy is in relation to natural science the supplementary,
-P-A-G-E-35
  § 2. General Theories of Psychology. Ay: 
in relation to the mental sciences the fwndamental, and in 
relation to philosophy the propaedeutic empirical science. 
10a, The view that it is not a difference in the objects of 
experience, but in the way of treating experience, that distinguishes 
psychology from natural science, has come to be recognized more 
and more in modern psychology. Still, a clear comprehension of 
the essential character of this position in regard to the scientific 
problems of psychology, is prevented by the persistence of older 
tendencies derived from metaphysics and natural philosophy. 
Instead of starting from the fact that the natural sciences are 
possible only after abstracting from the subjective factors of 
experience, the more general problem of treating the contents 
of all experience in the most general way, is sometimes assigned 
to natural science. In such a case psychology is, of course, no 
longer coordinate with the natural sciences, but subordinate to 
them. Its problem is no longer to remove the abstraction 
employed by the natural sciences, and in this way to gain with 
them a complete view of experience, but it has to use the 
concept “subject” furnished by the natural sciences, and to 
give an account of the influence of this subject on the con- 
tents of experience. Instead of recognizing that an adequate 
definition of “subject” is possible only as a result of psycho- 
logical investigations (§ 1, 3a), a finished concept formed exclusively 
by the natural sciences is here foisted upon psychology. Now, for 
the natural sciences the subject is identical with the body. Psychol- 
ogy is accordingly defined as the science which has to determine 
the dependence of immediate experience on the body. This posi- 
tion, which may be designated as “psycho-physical materialism”, 
is epistemologically untenable and psychologically unproductive. 
Natural science, which purposely abstracts from the subjective 
component of all experience, is least of all in a position to give 
a final definition of the subject. A psychology that starts with 
such a purely physiological definition depends, therefore. not on 
experience, but, just like the older materialistic psychology, on a 
metaphysical presupposition. The position is psychologically un- 
productive because, from the very first, it turns over the causal 
interpretation of psychical processes to physiology. But physiol- 
ogy has not yet furnished such an interpretation, an never

will be able to do so, because of the difference between the 
manner of regarding phenomena in natural science and in psy- 
chology. It is obvious, too, that such a form of psychology, 
which has been turned into hypothetical brain-mechanics, can 
never be of any service as a basis for the mental sciences. 
The strictly empirical trend of psychology, defined in the 
principles formulated above, is opposed to these attempts to 
renew metaphysical doctrines. In calling it “voluntaristic”, we 
are not to overlook the fact that, in itself, this psychological 
voluntarism has absolutely no connection with any metaphysical 
doctrine of will. Indeed, it stands in opposition to Schopen- 
hauer’s one-sided metaphysical voluntarism, which derived all 
being from a transcendental original will, and to the metaphysical 
systems of a Spinoza or a Herbart, which arose from intellectu- 
alism. In its relation to metaphysics, the characteristic of psy- 
chological voluntarism in the sense above defined, is its exclusion 
of all metaphysics from psychology. In its relations to other 
forms of psychology, it refuses to accept any of the attempts 
to reduce volitions to mere ideas, and at the same time empha- 
sizes the typical character of volition for all psychological ex- 
perience. Volitional acts are universally recognized as occurren- 
ces, made up of a series of continual changes in quality and 
intensity. They are typical in the sense that this characteristic 
of being occurrences is held to be true for all the contents of 
psychical experience. 
§ 3. METHODS OF PSYCHOLOGY. 
1. Since psychology has for its object, not specific con- 
tents of experience, but general experience in its immediate 
character, it can make use of no methods except such as 
the empirical sciences in general employ for the determination, 
analysis, and causal synthesis of facts. The circumstance, 
that natural science abstracts from the subject, while psychol- 
ogy does not, can be no ground for modifications in the essential 
character of the methods employed in the two fields, though 
it does modify the way in which these methods are applied.
-P-A-G-E-37
  
§ 3. Methods of Psychology. 19 
The natural sciences, which may serve as an example for 
psychology in this respect, since they were developed earlier, 
make use of two chief methods: experiment and observation. 
Experiment is observation connected with an intentional 
interference on the part of the observer, in the rise and 
course of the phenomena observed. Observation, in its proper 
sense, is the investigation of phenomena without such inter- 
ference, just as they are naturally presented to the observer 
in the continuity of experience. Wherever experiment is 
possible, it is always used in the natural sciences; for under 
all circumstances, even when the phenomena in themselves 
present the conditions for sufficiently exact observation, it 
is an advantage to be able to control at will their rise and 
progress, or to isolate the various components of a composite 
phenomenon. Still, even in the natural sciences the two 
methods have been distinguished according to their spheres 
of application. It is held that the experimental methods are 
indispensable for certain problems, while in others the desired 
end may not infrequently be reached through mere obser 
vation. If we neglect a few exceptional cases. due to special 
relations, these two classes of problems correspond to the 
general division of natural phenomena into processes and 
objects. 
Experimental interference is required in the exact deter- 
mination of the course, and in the analysis of the components, 
of any natural process, such as, for example, light-waves or 
sound-waves, an electric discharge, the formation or disinte- 
gration of a chemical compound, and stimulation and metabolism 
in plants and animals. As a rule, such interference is desirable 
because exact observation is possible only when the observer can 
determine the moment at which the process shall commence. 
It is also indispensable in separating the various components 
of a complex phenomenon from one another. As a rule, this 
ie
-P-A-G-E-38
20 Introduction. 
is possible only through the addition or subtraction of certain 
conditions, or a quantitative variation of them. 
The case is different with oljects of nature. They are 
relatively constant; they do not have to be produced at a 
particular moment, but are always at the observer's disposal 
and ready for examination. Here, then, experimental in- 
vestigation is generally necessary only when the production 
and modification of the objects are to be inquired into. In 
such a case, they are regarded either as products or com- 
ponents of natural processes and come under the head of 
processes rather than objects. When, on the contrary, the 
only question is the actual nature of these objects, without 
reference to their origin or modification, mere observation is 
generally enough. Thus, mineralogy, botany, zoology, ana- 
tomy, and geography, are pure sciences of observation so long 
as they are kept free from the physical, chemical, and phys- 
iological problems that are, indeed, frequently brought into 
them, but have to do with processes of nature, not with the 
objects in themselves. 
2. If we apply these considerations to psychology, it is 
obvious at once, from the very nature of its subject-matter, 
that exact observation is here possible only in the form of 
experimental observation, and that psychology can never be 
a pure science of observation. The contents of this science 
are exclusively processes, not permanent objects. In order to 
investigate with exactness the rise and progress of these 
processes, their composition out of various components, and 
the interrelations of these components, we must be able first 
of all to bring about their beginning at will, and purposely 
to vary the conditions of the same. This is possible here, 
as in all cases, only through experiment, not through pure 
introspection. Besides this general reason there is another, 
peculiar to psychology, that does not apply at all to natural 
 
-P-A-G-E-39
§ 3. Methods of Psychology. 21 
phenomena. In the latter case we purposely abstract from 
the perceiving subject, and under circumstances, especially 
when favored by the regularity of the phenomena, as in 
astronomy, mere observation may succeed in determining 
with adequate certainty the objective contents of the pro- 
cesses. Psychology, on the contrary, is debarred from this 
abstraction by its fundamental principles, and the conditions 
for chance observation can be suitable only when the same 
objective components of immediate experience are frequently 
repeated in connection with the same subjective states. It 
is hardly to be expected, in view of the great complexity of 
psychical processes, that this will ever be the case. The coin- 
cidence is especially improbable since the very intention to 
observe, which is a necessary condition of all observation, 
modifies essentially the rise and progress of psychical pro- 
cesses. Observation of nature is not disturbed by this in- 
tention on the part of the observer, because here we pur- 
posely abstract from the state of the subject. The chief 
problem of psychology, however, is the exact observation of 
the rise and progress of subjective processes, and it can be 
readily seen that under such circumstances the intention to 
observe either essentially modifies the facts to be observed, 
or completely suppresses them. On the other hand, psychol- 
ogy, by the very way in which psychical processes originate, 
is led, just as physics and physiology are, to employ the ex- 
perimental mode of procedure. A sensation arises in us under 
the most favorable conditions for observation when it is 
caused by an external sense-stimulus, as, for example, a 
tone-sensation from an external tone-vibration, or a light- 
sensation from an external light-impression. The idea of an 
object is always caused originally by the more or less com- 
plicated cooperation of external sense-stimuli. If we wish 
to study the way in which an idea is formed, we can choose
-P-A-G-E-40
3 Introduction. 
no other method than that of imitating this natural process. 
In doing this, we have at the same time the great advantage 
of being able to modify the idea itself by changing at will 
the combination of the impressions that cooperate to form 
it, and of thus learning what influence cach single condition 
exercises on the product. Memory-images, it is true, can 
not be directly aroused through external sense impressions, 
but follow them after a longer or shorter interval. Still, it 
is obvious that their attributes, and especially their relation 
to the primary ideas aroused through direct impressions, can 
be most accurately learned, not by waiting for their chance 
arrival, but by using such memory-ideas as may be aroused 
in a systematic, experimental way, through immediately pre- 
ceding impressions. The same is true of feclings and voli- 
tions; they will be presented in the form best adapted to 
exact investigation when those impressions are purposely 
produced which experience has shown to be regularly con- 
nected with affective and volitional reactions. There is, then, 
no fundamental psychical process to which experimental 
methods can not be applied, and therefore none in whose 
investigation they are not logically required. 
3. Pure observation, such as is possible in many depart- 
ments of natural science, is, from the very character of psy- 
chical phenomena, impossible in individual psychology. Such 
a possibility would be conceivable only under the condition 
that there existed permanent psychical objects, independent 
of our attention, similar to the relatively permanent objects 
of nature, which remain unchanged by our observation of 
them. There are, indeed, certain facts at the disposal of 
psychology, which, although they are not real objects, still 
have the character of psychical objects inasmuch as they 
possess these attributes of relative permanence, and indepen- 
dence of the observer. Connected with these characteristics  
-P-A-G-E-41
§ 3. Methods of Psychology. 23 
is the further fact that they are unapprochable by means of 
experiment in the common acceptance of the term. These 
facts are the mental products that have been developed in 
the course of history, such as language, mythological ideas, 
and customs. The origin and development of these pro- 
ducts depend in every case on general psychical conditions 
which may be inferred from their objective attributes. Psy- 
chological analysis can, consequently, explain the psychical 
processes operative in their formation and development. All 
such mental products of a general character presuppose as 
a condition the existence of a mental community com- 
posed of many individuals, though, of course, their deepest 
sources are the psychical attributes of the individual. 
Because of this dependence on the community, in par- 
ticular the social community, this whole department of psy- 
chological investigation is designated as social psychology, 
and distinguished from individual, or as it may he called 
because of its predominating method, experimental psychology. 
In the present stage of the science these two branches of 
psychology are generally taken up in different treatises; still, 
they are not so much different departments as different meth- 
ods. So-called social psychology corresponds to the method 
of pure observation, the objects of observation in this case 
being the mental products. The necessary connection of 
these products with social communities, which has given to 
social psychology its name, is due to the fact that the mental 
products of the individual are of too variable a character to 
be the subjects of objective observation. The phenomena 
gain the necessary degree of constancy only when they 
become collective. 
Thus psychology has, like natural science, two exact 
methods: the experimental method, serving for the analysis of 
simpler psychical processes, and the observation of general
-P-A-G-E-42
  24 Introduction. 
mental products, serving for the investigation of the higher 
psychical processes and developments. 
3a. The introduction of the experimental method into psychol- 
ogy was originally due to the modes of procedure in physiology, 
especially in the physiology of the sense-organs and the nervous 
system. For this reason experimental psychology is also com- 
monly called “physiological psychology”; and works treating it 
under this title regularly contain those supplementary facts from 
the physiology of the nervous system and the sense-organs, which 
require special discussion with a view to the interests of psy- 
chology, though in themselves they belong to physiology alone. 
“Physiological psychology” is, accordingly, an intermediate dis- 
cipline which is, however, as the name indicates, primarily 
psychology, and is, apart from the supplementary physiological 
facts that it presents, just the same as “experimental psychology” 
in the sense above defined. The attempt sometimes made, to 
distinguish psychology proper from physiological psychology, by 
assigning to the first the psychological interpretation of inner 
experience, and to the second the derivation of this experience 
from physiological processes, is to be rejected as inadmissible. 
There is only one kind of causal explanation in psychology, and 
that is the derivation of more complex psychical processes from 
simpler ones. In this method of interpretation physiological 
elements can be used only as supplementary aids, because of the 
relation between natural science and psychology as above defined 
(§ 2, 4). Materialistic psychology denies the existence of psychical 
causality, and substitutes for this problem the other, of explain- 
ing psychical processes by brain-physiology. This tendency, which 
has been shown (§ 2, 10a) to be epistemologically and psycho- 
logically untenable, appears among the representatives of both 
“pure” and “physiological” psychology. 
§ 4. GENERAL SURVEY OF THE SUBJECT. 
1. The immediate contents of experience which constitute 
the subject-matter of psychology, are under all circumstances 
processes of a composite character. Sense-perceptions of ex-
-P-A-G-E-43
  § 4. General Survey of the Subject. 25 
ternal objects, memories of such sense-perceptions, feelings, 
emotions, and volitional acts, are not only continually united 
in the most various ways, but each of these processes is 
itself a more or less composite whole. The idea of an ex- 
ternal body, for example, is made up of partial ideas of its 
parts. A tone may be ever so simple, but we localize it in 
some direction, thus bringing it into connection with the idea 
of external space, which is highly composite. A feeling or 
volition is referred to some sensation that aroused the feeling 
or to an object willed. In dealing with a complex fact of 
this kind, scientific investigation has three problems to be 
solved in succession. The first is the analysis of composite 
processes; the second is the demonstration of the combinations 
into which the elements discovered by analysis enter; the 
third is the investigation of the laws that are operative in 
the formation of such combinations. 
2. The second, or synthetic, problem is made up of several 
partial problems. In the first place, the psychical elements 
unite to form composite psychical compounds which are 
separate and relatively independent of one another in the con- 
tinual flow of psychical processes. Such compounds are, for 
example, ideas, whether referred directly to external impressions 
or objects, or interpreted by us as memories of impressions 
and objects perceived before. Other examples are composite 
feelings, emotions, or volitions. Then again, these psychical 
compounds stand in the most various interconnections with 
one another. Thus, ideas unite to from larger simultaneous 
ideational complexes or regular successions, while affective and 
volitional processes form a variety of combinations with one 
another and with ideational processes. In this way we have 
the interconnection of psychical compounds as a class of syn- 
thetical processes of the second degree, consisting of a union 
between the simpler combinations, or those of elements into 
 
-P-A-G-E-44
  26 Introduction. 
psychical compounds. The separate psychical interconnections, 
in turn, unite to form still more comprehensive combinations, 
which also show a certain regularity in the arrangement of 
their components. In this way, combinations of a third degree 
arise, which we designate by the general name psychical 
developments. They may be divided into developments of 
different scope. Developments of « more limited sort are 
such as relate to a single mental trend, for example, the 
development of the intellectual functions, of the will, or of the 
feelings, or of merely one special branch of these functions, 
such as the aesthetic or moral feelings. From a number of 
such partial series arises the total development of a psychical 
personality. Finally, since animals and in a still higher 
degree human individuals are in continual interrelation with 
like beings, there arise above these individual forms the gen- 
eral psychical developments. These various branches of the 
study of psychical development are in part the psychological 
foundations of other sciences, such as the theory of knowledge, 
pedagogy, aesthetics, and ethics, and are, accordingly, treated 
more appropriately in connection with these. In part they 
have become special psychological sciences, such as child- 
psychology, animal and social psychology. We shall, there- 
fore; in this treatise discuss only those results from the three 
last mentioned departments which are of the most importance 
for general psychology. 
3. The solution of the last and most general psychological 
problem, the ascertainment of the laws of psychical phenom- 
ena, depends upon the investigation of all the combi- 
nations of different degrees, the combination of elements 
into compounds, of compounds into interconnections, and 
of interconnections into developments. And as this in- 
vestigation is the only thing that can teach us the actual 
composition of psychical processes, so we can discover the
-P-A-G-E-45
  
  § 4. General Survey of the Subject. 27 
attributes of psychical causality, which finds its expression 
in these processes, only from the laws followed by the con- 
tents of experience and their components in their various 
combinations. 
We have, accordingly, to consider in the following 
chapters: 
1) Psychical Elements, 
2) Psychical Compounds, 
3) Interconnection of Psychical Compounds, 
4) Psychical Developments, 
5) Psychical Causality and its Laws.

I. PSYCHICAL ELEMENTS. 
§ 5. CHIEF FORMS AND GENERAL ATTRIBUTES 
OF PSYCHICAL ELEMENTS. 
1. All the contents of psychical experience are of a com- 
posite character. It follows, therefore, that psychical elements, 
or the «absolutely simple and irreducible components of psy- 
chical phenomena, can not be found by analysis alone, but 
only with the aid of abstraction. This abstraction is rendered 
possible by the fact that the elements are in reality united 
in different ways. If the element a is connected in one case 
with the elements 5, ¢,d..., in another with U’,c',d’..., 
it is possible to abstract it from all the other elements. be- 
cause none of them is always united with it. If, for example, 
we hear a simple tone of a certain pitch and intensity, it 
may be located now in this direction, now in that, and may 
be heard alternately with various other tones. But since the 
direction is not constant, or the accompanying tone the same, 
it is possible to abstract from these variable elements, and 
we have the single tone as a psychical element. 
2. As products of psychical analysis, we have psychical 
elements of two kinds, corresponding to the two factors con- 
tained in immediate experience (§ 1, 2), the objective contents 
and the experiencing subject. The elements of the objective 
contents we call sensational elements, or simply sensations: 
such are a tone, or a particular sensation of hot, cold, or 
light, when we neglect for the moment all the connections
-P-A-G-E-47
  
§ 5. Chief Forms and General Attributes of Psychical Elements. 29 
of these sensations with others, and all their spacial and 
temporal relations. The subjective elements, on the other 
hand, are designated as affective elements, or simple feelings. 
‘We may mention as examples the feelings accompanying sen- 
sations of light, sound, taste, smell, hot, cold, or pain, the feel- 
ings aroused by the sight of an agreeable or disagreeable object, 
and the feelings arising in a state of attention or at the 
moment of a volitional act. Such simple feelings are in a 
double sense products of abstraction: each is connected with 
an ideational element, and is furthermore a component of 
a psychical process which occurs in time, and during which 
the feeling itself is continually changing. 
3. The actual contents of psychical experience always 
consist of various combinations of sensational and affective 
elements, so that the specific character of the simple psychi- 
cal processes depends for the most part not on the nature 
of these elements so much as on their union into composite 
psychical compounds. Thus, the idea of an extended body 
or of a temporal series of sensations, an emotion, and a vo- 
lition, are all specific forms of psychical experience. But 
their character as such is as little present in their sensational 
and affective elements as the chemical properties of a com- 
pound body can be. defined by recounting the properties of 
its chemical elements. Specific character and elementary 
nature of psychical processes are, accordingly, two entirely 
different concepts. Every psychical element is a specific 
content of experience, but not every specific content of imme- 
diate experience is at the same time a psychical element. 
Thus, especially spacial and temporal ideas, emotions, and 
volitional acts, are specific but not elementary processes. 
Many elements are present only in psychical compounds of 
a particular kind, but since these compounds regularly con- 
tain other elements as well, their special characteristics are 
 
-P-A-G-E-48
    
30 I. Psychical Elements. 
to be attributed to the mode of union, rather than to the 
abstract attributes, of their elements. Thus, we always refer 
a momentary sound-sensation to a definite point in time. 
This localization in time, however, is possible only by relat- 
ing the given sensation to others preceding and following 
it, so that the special character of the time-idea can not 
arise from the single sound-sensation thought of as isolated, 
but only from its union with others. Again, an emotion of 
anger or a volition contains certain simple feelings that are 
never present in other psychical compounds, still each of 
these processes is composite, for it has duration, in the course 
of which particular feelings follow one another with a certain 
regularity, and the process itself is not complete without the 
whole train of these feelings. 
4. Sensations and simple feelings exhibit certain common 
attributes and also certain characteristic differences. They 
have in common two determinants, which we call quality and 
intensity. Every simple sensation and every simple feeling - 
has a definite qualitative character that marks it off from 
all other sensations and feelings; and this quality must al- 
ways have some degree of intensity. Accordingly, we distin- 
guish the different psychical elements from one another by 
their qualities, but regard the intensity as the quantitative 
yalue which in any concrete case belongs to the given cle- 
ment. Our designations of psychical elements are based 
entirely upon their qualities; thus, we distinguish such sen- 
sations as blue, grey, yellow, hot, and cold, or such feelings 
as grave, cheerful, sad, gloomy, and sorrowful. On the other 
hand, we always express the differences in the intensity of 
psychical elements by the same quantitative designations, as 
weak, strong, medium strong, and very strong. These expres- 
sions are in both cases class-concepts which serve for a first 
superficial arrangement of the elements, and each embraces
-P-A-G-E-49
§ 5. uhief Forms and General Attributes of Psychical Elements. 31 
an unlimitedly large number of concrete elements. Language 
has developed a relatively complete stock of names for the 
qualities of simple sensations, especially for colors and tones. 
Names for the qualities of feelings and for degrees of intensity 
are far behind. Clearness and obscurity, as also distinctness 
and indistinctness, are sometimes classed with quality and 
intensity. But since these attributes, as will appear later 
(§ 15, 4), always arise from the interconnection of psychical 
compounds, they can not be regarded as determinants of 
psychical elements. 
5. Made up, at it is, of two determinants, quality and 
intensity, every psychical element must have a certain degree 
of intensity from which it is possible to pass, by continual 
gradations, to every other degree of intensity in the same 
quality. Such gradations can be made in only éwo directions: 
one we call dnerease in intensity, the other decrease. The 
degrees of intensity of every qualitative element, form in this 
way a single dimension, in which, from a given point, we 
may move in two. opposite directions, just as from any point 
in a straight line. This may be expressed in the general 
statement: The various intensities of every psychical element 
form a continuity of one dimension. The extremities of this 
continuity we call the minimal and maximal sensation or 
feeling, as the case may be. 
In contrast with this uniformity in intensities, the qualities 
have more variable attributes. Every quality may, indeed, be 
so arranged in a definite continuity that it is possible to pass 
uninterruptedly from a given. point to any other points in the 
same quality. But the various continuities of different qual- 
ities, which we may call systems of quality, exhibit differences 
both in the. variety of possible gradations, and in the number 
of directions of gradation. In these two respects, we may 
distinguish, on the one hand, homogeneous and complex, on 
 
-P-A-G-E-50
  32 I. Psychical Elements. 
the other, one-dimensional, two-dimensional, and: many-dimen~ 
sional systems of quality. Within a homogeneous system, 
only such small differences are possible that generally there 
has never arisen any practical need of distinguishing them 
by different names. Thus, we distinguish only one quality 
of pressure, hot, cold, or pain, only one feeling of attention 
or of activity, although, in intensity, each of these qualitics 
may have many different grades. It is not to be inferred from 
this fact that in each of these systems there is really only 
one quality. The truth is that in these cases the number 
of different qualities is merely very limited; if we were to 
represent it geometrically, it would probably never reduce 
entirely to a single point. Thus, for example, sensations of 
pressure from different regions of the skin show, beyond 
question, small qualitative differences which are great enough 
to let us distinguish clearly any point of the skin from another 
at some distance from it. Such differences, however, as 
arise from contact with a sharp or dull, a rough or smooth 
body, are not to be reckoned as different qualities. They 
always depend on a large number of simultaneous sensations, 
and without the various combinations of these sensations into 
composite psychical compounds, the impressions mentioned 
would be impossible. 
Complex systems of quality differ from those we have been 
discussing, in that they embrace a large number of clearly 
distinguishable elements between which all possible inter- 
mediate forms exist. In this class we must include the 
tonal system and color-system, the systems of smells and 
tastes, and among the affective systems those which form 
the subjective complements of these sensational systems, such 
as the systems of tonal feelings, color-feelings, etc. It is 
probable also that many systems of feelings belong here, which 
are objectively connected with composite impressions, but as
-P-A-G-E-51
$5. Chief Forms and General Attributes of Psychical Elements. 33 
feelings are simple in character; such are the various feelings 
of harmony or discord that correspond to the different com- 
binations of tones. 
The differences in the nwmber of dimensions have been 
determined with certainty only in the case of certain sensa- 
tional systems. Thus, the tonal system is one-dimensional. 
The ordinary color-system, which includes the colors and their 
transitional qualities to white, is two-dimensional; while the 
complete system of light-sensations, which includes also the 
dark color-tones and the transitional qualities to black, is 
three-dimensional. 
6. In the relations discussed thus far, sensational and 
affective elements in general agree. They differ, on the other 
hand, in certain essential attributes which are connected 
with the immediate relations of sensations to objects and of 
feelings to the subject. 
1) When varied in a single dimension, sensational elements 
exhibit pure qualitative differences, which are always in the same 
direction until they reach the possible limits of variation, where 
they become maximal differences. Thus, in the color-system, 
red and green, blue and yellow, or in the tonal system, the 
lowest and highest audible tones, are the maximal, and at the 
same time purely qualitative, differences. Every affective ele- 
ment, on the contrary, when continuously varied in the 
suitable direction of quality, passes gradually into a feeling 
of opposite quality. This is most obvious in the case of the 
affective elements regularly connected with certain sensational 
elements, as, for example, tonal feelings or color-feelings. As 
sensations a high and a low tone are differences that approach 
more or less the maximal differences of tonal sensation; the 
corresponding tonal feelings are opposites. In general, then, 
sensational qualities are limited by maximal differences, affec- 
tive qualities by maximal opposites. Between these opposites

34 I. Psychical Elements. 
is » middle zone, where the feeling is not noticeable at all. 
It is, however, frequently impossible to demonstrate this in- 
difference-zone, because, while certain simple feelings disappear, 
other affective qualities remain, or new ones even may arise. 
The latter case appears especially when the transition of the 
feeling into the indifference-zone depends on a change in sen- 
sations. Thus, in the middle of the musical scale, those feelings 
disappear which correspond to the high and low tones, but the 
middle tones have still other, independent affective qualities 
which do not disappear with these opposites. This is to be 
explained by the fact that a feeling which corresponds to a 
certain sensational quality is, as a rule, a component of a 
complex affective system, in which it belongs at the same 
time to various dimensions. Thus, the affective quality of 
a tone of given pitch belongs not only to the dimension of 
pitch-feelings, but also to that of feelings of intensity, and 
finally to the different dimensions in which the clang-qual- 
ities of tones may be arranged. A tone of middle pitch 
and intensity may, in this way, lie in the indifference-zone 
so far as feelings of pitch and intensity are concerned, and 
yet have a very marked clang-feeling. The passage of affec- 
tive elements through the indifference-zone can be directly 
observed only when care is taken to abstract from other 
accomp:nying affective elements. The cases most favorable for 
this observation are those in which the accompanying elements 
disappear entirely or almost entircly. Wherever such an in- 
difference-zone appears without complication with other affective 
clements, we speak of the state as free from feelings, and of 
the sensations and ideas present in such a state, as indifferent. 
2) Feelings of specific, and at the same time simple and 
irreducible, quality appear not only as the subjective com- 
plements of simple sensations, but also as the characteristic 
attendants of composite ideas or even complex ideational
-P-A-G-E-53
§ 5. Chief Forms and General Attributes of Psychical Elements. 35 
processes. Thus, there is a simple tonal feeling which varies 
with the pitch and intensity of tones, and also a feeling of 
harmony which, regarded as a feeling, is just as irreducible, 
but varies with the character of compound clangs. Still 
other feelings, which may in turn be of the most various 
kinds, arise from melodious series of clangs. Here, again, 
each single feeling taken by itself at a given moment, appears 
as an irreducible unit. Simple feelings are, then, much more 
various and numerous than simple sensations. 
3) The various pure sensations may be arranged in a 
number of separate systems, between whose elements there is 
no ‘qualitative relation whatever. Sensations belonging to 
different systems are called disparate. Thus, a tone and a 
color, a sensation of hot and one of pressure, or, in general, 
any two sensations between which there are no intermediate 
qualities, are disparate. According to this criterion, each of 
the four special senses (smell, taste, hearing, and sight) has a 
closed, complex sensational system, disparate from the other 
senses; while the general sense (touch) contains four homo- 
geneous sensational systems (sensations of pressure, hot, cold, 
and pain). All simple feelings, on the contrary, form a 
single interconnected manifold, for there is no feeling from 
which it is not possible to pass to any other through inter- 
mediate forms or through indifference-zones. But here too 
we may distinguish certain systems whose elements ire more 
closely related, as, for example, feelings from color., tones, 
harmonies, and rhythms. Still, they are not absolutciy closed 
systems, but there are everywhere relations either of likeness 
or of opposition to other systems. Thus, such feeling. as those 
from sensations of moderate warmth, from tonal ham rny, and 
from satisfied expectation, however great their «walitative 
differences may be, are all related in that they belong to the 
general class of “pleasurable feelings”. Still closer relations 
3*

36 I. Psychical Elements. 
exist between certain single affective systems, as. for example, 
between tonal feclings and color-feclings, where deep tones 
seem to be related to dark colors, and bright colors to high 
tones. When in such cases a certain relationship is ascribed 
to the sensations themselves, it is probably due entirely to a 
confusion of the accompanying feelings with the sensations. 
This third distinguishing characteristic shows conclu- 
sively that the origin of the feelings is more unitary than 
that of the sensations, which depend on a number of differ- 
ent and in part distinguishable conditions. It is the same 
distinction that we find in the characterization of the sub- 
ject, which stands in immediate relation to the feelings, as 
a unit, in contrast with the plurality of the objects, to which 
the sensations are related. 
6a. It is only in modern psychology that the terms “sen- 
sation” and “feeling” have gained the meanings assigned to them 
in the definitions above given. In older psychological literature 
they were sometimes used indiscriminatingly, sometimes inter- 
changed. Even yet sensations of touch and those from the 
internal organs are called feelings by physiologists, and the sense 
of touch itself is known as the “sense of feeling”. This corre- 
sponds, it is true, to the original significance of the word, where 
feeling is the same as touching, still, after the very useful 
differentiation has once been made, a confusion of the two terms 
should be avoided. Then again, the word “sensation” is used 
even by psychologists to mean not only simple, but also com- 
posite qualities, such as compound clangs and spacial and tem- 
poral ideas. But since we have the entirely adequate word 
“idea” for such compounds, it is more advantageous to limit the 
word sensation to psychologically simple sense-qualities. Finally, 
the term “sensation” has sometimes been restricted so as to mean 
only those stimulations which come directly from external sense- 
stimuli. For the psychological attributes of a sensation, however, 
this circumstance is entirely irrelevant, and therefore such a 
definition of the term is unjustifiable
-P-A-G-E-55
  § 5. Chief Forms and General Attributes of Psychical Elements. 37 
The discrimination between sensational and affective elements 
in any concrete case is very much facilitated by the existence 
of indifference-zones in the feelings. Then again, from the fact 
that feelings range between opposites rather than mere differ- 
ences, it follows that they are much the more variable elements 
of our immediate experience. This changeable character, which 
renders it almost impossible to hold an affective state constant 
in quality and intensity, is the cause of the great difficulties 
that stand in the way of the exact investigation of feelings. 
Sensations are present in all immediate experiences, but 
feelings may disappear in certain special cases, because of their 
oscillation through an indifference-zone. Obviously, then, we can, 
in the case of sensations, abstract from the accompanying feel- 
ings, but never vice versa. In this way two false views may 
easily arise, either that sensations are the causes of feelings, or 
that feelings are a particular species of sensations. The first of 
these opinions is false because affective elements can never be 
derived from sensations as such, but only from the attitude of 
the subject, so that under different subjective conditions the 
same sensation may be accompanied by different feelings. The 
second is untenable because the two classes of elements are 
distinguished, on the one hand by the immediate relation of 
sensations to objects and of feelings to the subject, and on the 
other by the fact that the former range between maximal differ- 
ences, the latter between maximal opposites. Because of the 
objective and subjective factors belonging to all psychical ex- 
perience, sensations and feelings are to be looked upon as real 
and equally essential, though everywhere interrelated, elements 
of psychical phenomena. In this interrelation the sensational 
elements appear as the more constant; they alone can be isolated 
through abstraction, by referring them to external objects. It 
follows, therefore, of necessity that in investigating the attributes 
of both, we must start with the sensations. Simple sensations, 
in the consideration of which we abstract from the accompanying 
affective elements, are called pure sensations. Obviously, we can never 
speak of “pure feelings” in a similar sense, since simple feelings 
can never be thought of apart from the accompanying sensations 
and combinations of sensations. This fact is directly connected with 
the second distinguishing characteristic mentioned above (p. 34 sq).

§ 6. PURE SENSATIONS. 
1. The concept “pure sensation” as shown in § 5 is the 
product of a twofold abstraction: 1) from the ideas in which 
the sensation appears, and 2) from the simple feelings with 
which it is united. We find that pure sensations, defined in 
this way, form a number of disparate systems of quality; each 
of these systems, such as that of sensations of pressure, of 
tone, or of light, is either a homogencous or a complex con- 
tinuity (§ 5, 5) from which no transition to any other system 
can be found. 
2. The rise of sensations, as physiology teaches us, is re- 
gularly dependent on certain physical processes that have 
their origin partly in the external world surrounding us, 
partly in certain bodily organs. We designate these pro- 
cesses with a name borrowed from physiology as sense-stim- 
uli or sensation-stimuli. If the stimulus is a process in 
the outer world we call it physical; if it is a process in our 
own body we call it physiological. Physiological stimuli may 
be divided, in turn, into peripheral and central, according 
as they are processes in the various bodily organs outside of 
the brain, or processes in the brain itself. In many cases a 
sensation is attended by all three forms of stimuli. Thus, to 
illustrate, an external impression of light acts as a physical 
stimulus on the eye; in the eye and optic nerve there arises 
a peripheral physiological stimulation; finally a central phys- 
iological stimulation takes place in the corpora quadrigemina 
and in the occipital regions of the cerebral cortex, where the 
optic nerve terminates. In many cases the physical stimulus 
may be wanting, while both forms of physiological stimuli are 
present; as, when we perceive a flash of light in consequence 
of a violent ocular movement. In still other cases the 
central stimulus alone is present; as, when we recall a light
-P-A-G-E-57
  § 6. Pure Sensations. 39 
impression previously experienced. The central stimulus is, 
accordingly, the only one that always accompanies sensation. 
When a peripheral stimulus causes a sensation, it must be 
connected with a central stimulus, and a physical must be 
connected with both a peripheral and a central stimulus. 
3. The physiological study of development renders it 
probable that the differentiation of the various sensational 
systems has been effected in part in the course of general 
development. The original organ of sense is the outer skin 
with the sensitive inner organs adjoining it. The organs of 
taste, smell, hearing, and sight, on the other hand, are later 
differentiations of it. It may, therefore, be surmised that 
the sensational systems corresponding to these special sense- 
organs, have also gradually arisen through differentiation from 
the sensational systems of the general sense, from sensations 
of pressure, hot, and cold. It is possible, too, that in lower 
animals some of the systems now so widely differentiated are 
even yet more alike. From a physiological standpoint the 
primordeal character of the general sense is also apparent in 
the fact that it has for the transfer of sense-stimuli to the nerves 
either yery simple organs or none at all. Pressure, temperature, 
and pain-stimuli can produce sensations at points in the skin 
where, in spite of the most careful investigation, no special 
end-organs can be found. There are, indeed, special receiving 
organs in the regions most sensitive to pressure (touch-cor- 
puscles, end-bulbs, and corpuscles of Vater), but their struc- 
ture renders it probable that they merely favor the mechanical 
transfer of the stimulus to the nerve-endings. Special end-organs 
for hot, cold, and pain-stimuli have not been found at all. 
In the later developed special sense-organs, on the other 
hand, we find everywhere structures which not only effect 
the suitable transfer of the stimuli to the sensory nerves, but 
generally bring about a physiological transformation, of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-58
  40 I. Psychical Elements. 
stimulation which is indispensable for the rise of the peculiar 
sensational qualities. But even among the special senses 
there are differences in this respect. 
The receiving organ in the ear, in particular, appears to 
be of a character different from that of the organs of smell, 
taste, and sight. In its most primitive forms it consists of a 
vesicle filled with one or more solid particles (otoliths), and sup- 
plied with nerve-bundles distributed in its walls. The particles 
are set in motion through sound-vibrations, and must cause a 
rapid succession of weak pressure-stimulations in the fibres of 
the nerve-bundles. The auditory organ of the higher animals 
shows an extraordinary complexity, still, in its essential struc- 
ture it recalls this primitive type. In the cochlea of man 
and the higher animals the auditory nerve passes at first 
through the axis, which is pierced by a large number of fine 
canals, and then emerges through the pores which open into 
the cavity of the cochlea. Here the branches are distributed 
on a tightly stretched membrane, which extends through the 
spiral windings of the cochlea and is weighted with special 
rigid arches (arches of Corti). This membrane — the basilar 
membrane, as it is called — must, according to the laws of 
acoustics, be thrown into sympathetic vibrations whenever 
sound-waves strike the ear. It seems, therefore, to play 
the same part here as the otoliths do in the lower forms of 
the auditory organ. At the same time one other change has 
taken place which accounts for the enormous differentiation 
of the sensational system. The basilar membrane has a differ- 
ent breadth in its different parts, for it grows continually 
wider from the base to the apex of the cochlea. In this 
way it acts like a system of stretched chords of different 
lengths. And just as in such a system, other conditions re- 
maining the same, the longer chords are tuned to lower and 
the shorter to higher tones, so we may assume the same to
-P-A-G-E-59
  $ 6. Pure Sensations. 41 
be true for the different parts of the basilar membrane. We 
may surmise that the simplest auditory ‘organs with their 
otoliths have a homogeneous sensational system, analogous 
perhaps to our systems of sensations of pressure. The 
special development of the organ as seen in the cochlea of 
higher animals explains the evolution of an extraordinarily 
complex sensational system from this originally homogeneous 
system. Still, the structure remains similar in this respect, 
that it seems adapted, in the latter case as in the former, to 
the best possible éransfer of the physical stimulus to the 
sensory nerve rather than to any transformation of the stim- 
ulus. This view agrees with the observed fact that, just as 
sensations of pressure may be perceived on regions of the 
skin not supplied with special receiving organs, so, in the 
case of certain animals, such as birds, where the conditions 
are specially favorable for their transmission, sound-vibrations 
are transferred to the auditory nerve and sensed even after 
the removal of the whole auditory organ with its special re- 
ceiving structure. 
With smell, taste, and sight the case is essentially differ- 
ent. Organs are present which render direct action of the 
stimuli on the sensory nerves impossible. The external stim- 
uli are here received through special organs and modified 
before they excite the nerves. These organs are specially 
metamorphosed epithelial cells with one end exposed to the 
stimulus and the other passing into a nerve-fibre. Everything 
goes to show that the receiving organs here are not merely 
for the transfer of the stimuli, but rather for their trans- 
formation. In the three cases under discussion it is probable 
that the transformation is a chemical process. In smell and taste 
we have external chemical agencies, in sight we have light as 
the causes of chemical disintegrations in the sensory cells; 
these processes in the cells then serve as the real stimuli. 
 
-P-A-G-E-60
  42 I. Psychical Elements. 
These three senses may, as chemical senses, be distinguished 
from the mechanical senses of pressure and sound. It is 
impossible to say with any degree of certainty, to which of 
these two classes sensations of cold and hot belong. One 
indication of the direct relation between stimuli and sensation 
in mechanical senses, as contrasted with the indirect relation 
in chemical senses, is that in the first case the sensation 
lasts only a very little longer than the external stimulus, 
while in the latter case it persists very much longer. Thus, 
in a quick succession of pressures and more especially of 
sounds, it is possible to distinguish clearly the single stimuli 
from one another; lights, tastes, and smells, on the other 
hand, run together at a very moderate rate of succession. 
4. Since peripheral and central stimuli are regular physical 
concomitants of elementary sensational processes, the attempt 
to determine the relation between stimuli and sensations is 
very natural. In attempting to solve this problem, physiol- 
ogy generally considers sensations as the result of physio- 
logical stimuli, but assumes at the same time that in this 
case any proper explanation of the effect from its cause is 
impossible, and that all that can be undertaken is to deter- 
mine the constancy of the relations between particular stimuli 
and the resulting sensations. Now, it is found in many cases 
that different stimuli acting on the same end-organ produce 
the same sensations; thus, for example, mechanical and elec- 
trical stimulations of the eye produce light sensations. This 
result was generalized in the principle, that every receiving 
element of a sense-organ and every simple sensory nerve-fibre 
together with its central terminus, is capable of only a single 
sensation of fixed quality; that the various qualities of sen- 
sation are, therefore, due to the various physiological elements 
with different specific energies. 
Thi. principle, generally called the “law of specific energy
-P-A-G-E-61
  § 6. Pure Sensations, 43 
of nerves”, is untenable for three reasons, even if we neglect 
for the moment the fact that it simply refers the causes of 
the various differences in sensations to a qualitas occulta of 
sensory and nervous elements. 
1) It is contradictory to the physiological doctrine of the 
development of the senses. If, as we must assume according 
to this doctrine, the complex sensational systems are derived 
‘from systems originally simpler and more homogeneous, the 
physiological sensory elements must have undergone a change 
also. This, however, is possible only under the condition 
that organs may be modified by the stimuli which act upon 
them. That is to say, the sensory elements determine the 
qualities of sensations only secondarily, as a result of the prop- 
erties which they acquire through the processes of stimulation 
aroused in them. If, then, these sensory elements have under- 
gone, in the course of time, radical changes due to the nature 
of the stimuli acting upon them, such changes could have been 
possible only under the condition that the physiological stimu- 
lations in the sensory elements varied to some extent with 
the quality of the stimulus. 
2) The principle of specific energy is contradictory to 
the fact that in many senses the number of different sensory 
elements does not correspond at all to that of different sen- 
sational qualities. Thus, from a single point in the retina 
we can receive all possible sensations of brightness and color; 
in the organs of smell and taste we find no clearly dis- 
tinguishable forms of the sensory elements, while even a 
limited area of their sensory surfaces can receive a variety 
of sensations, which, especially in the case of the olfactory 
organ, is very large. Where we have every reason to assume 
that qualitatively different sensations actually do arise in differ- 
ent sensory elements, as in the case of the auditory organ, 
the structure of the organ goes to show that this difference
-P-A-G-E-62
  44 I. Psychical Elements. 
is not due to any attribute of the nerve-fibres or of other 
sensory elements, but that it comes originally from the way in 
which they are arranged. Different fibres of the auditory 
nerve will, of course, be stimulated by different tone-vibrations, 
because the different parts of the basilar membrane are tuned 
to different tones; but this is not due to some original and 
inexplicable attribute of the single auditory nerve-fibres, but 
to the way in which they are connected with the end-organ. 
3) Finally, the sensory nerves and central elements can 
have no original specific energy, because the peripheral sense- 
organ must be exposed to the adequate stimuli for a suf- 
ficient interval, or must at least have been so exposed at 
some previous period, before the corresponding sensations can 
arise through their stimulation. Persons congenitally blind 
and deaf do not have any sensations of light or tone whatever, 
so far as we know, even when the sensory nerves and centres 
were originally present. 
Everything goes to show that the differences in the qual- 
ities of sensations are conditioned by the differences in the 
processes of stimulation that arise in the sense-organs. These 
processes are dependent primarily on the character of the 
physical stimuli, and only secondarily on the peculiarities of 
the receiving organ, which are due to its adaptation to these 
stimuli. As a result of this adaptation, however, it may 
happen that even when some stimulus other than that which 
has effected the original adaptation of the sensory elements, 
that is, when an inadequate stimulus acts, the sensation 
corresponding to the adequate stimulus may arise. Still, 
this does not hold for all stimuli or for all sensory elements. 
Thus, hot and cold stimulations can not cause cutaneous 
sensations of pressure or sensations in the special sense-organs; 
chemical and electrical stimuli produce sensations of light 
only when they act upon the retina, not when they act on
-P-A-G-E-63
§ 6. Pure Sensations. 45 
the optic nerve; and, finally, these general stimuli can not 
arouse sensations of smell or taste. When an electric current 
causes chemical disintegration, it may, indeed, arouse such 
sensations, but it is through the adequate chemical stimuli 
produced. 
5. From the very nature of the case, it is impossible to 
explain the character of sensations from the character of phy- 
sical and physiological stimuli. Stimuli and sensations can 
not be compared with one another at all; the first belong 
to the mediate experience of the natural sciences, the second 
to the immediate experience of psychology. An interrelation 
between sensations and physiological stimuli must necessarily 
exist, however, in the sense that different kinds of stim- 
ulation always correspond to different sensations. This 
principle of the parallelism of changes in sensation and in 
physiological stimulation is an important supplementary prin- 
ciple in both the psychological and physiological doctrines 
of sensation. In the first case it is used in producing defi- 
nite changes in the sensation, by means of intentional varia- 
tion of the stimulus; in the second it is used in inferring the 
identity or non-identity of physiological stimulations from the 
identity or non-identity of the sensations. Furthermore, the 
same principle is the basis of our practical life and of our 
theoretical knowledge of the external world. 
A. SENSATIONS OF THE GENERAL SENSE. 
6. The definition of the “general sense” includes two 
factors. In point of time, the general sense is that which 
precedes all others and therefore belongs to all beings 
endowed with mind. In its spacial attributes, the general 
sense is distinguished from the particular senses in having the 
most extensive sensory surface exposed to stimuli. It includes 
not only the whole external skin and the adjoining areas of
-P-A-G-E-64
  16 I. Psychical Elements. 
the mucous membrane, but a large number of internal or- 
gans supplied with sensory nerves, such as joints, muscles, 
tendons, and bones, which are accessible to stimuli either 
always, or at certain times, under special conditions, as is 
the case with bones. 
The general sense includes fowr specific, distinct sensa- 
tional systems: sensations of pressure, hot, cold, and pain. Not 
infrequently a single stimulus arouses more than one of these 
sensations. The sensation is then immediately recognized as 
made up of a mixture of components from the different 
systems; for example, from sensations of pressure and pain, 
or from sensations of hot and pain. In a similar manner, 
as a result of the extension of the sense-organ, we may often 
have mixtures of the various qualities of one and the same 
system, for example, qualitatively different sensations of pres- 
sure, when an extended region of the skin is touched. 
The four systems of the general sense are all homogeneous 
systems '§ 5, 5). This shows that the sense is genetically 
earlier than the others, whose systems are all complex. The 
sensations of pressure from the external skin, and those due 
to the tensions and movements of the muscles, joints, and 
tendons, are generally grouped together under the name touch- 
sensations, and distinguished from the common sensations, 
which include sensations of hot, cold, and pain, and those sen- 
sations of pressure that sometimes arise in the other internal 
organs. This distinction, however, has its source in the re- 
lation of the sensations to ideas and concomitant feelings, 
and has nothing to do with ‘the qualities of the sensations 
in themselves. 
7. The ability of the different parts of the general sense- 
organ to receive stimulations and give rise to sensations, 
can be tested with adequate exactness only on the external 
skin. he only facts that can be determined in regard to
-P-A-G-E-65
  § 6. Pure Sensations. 47 
the internal parts, are that the joints are in a high degree 
sensitive to pressures, while the muscles and tendons are 
much less so, and that sensations of hot, cold, and pain 
in the internal organs are exceptional, and noticcable only 
under abnormal conditions. On the other hand, there is 
no point of the external skin and of the immediately ad- 
joining parts of the mucous membrane, which is not sen- 
sitive at once to stimulations of pressure, hot, cold, and 
pain. The degree of sensitivity may, indeed, vary at different 
points, in such a way that the points most sensitive to pressure, 
to hot, and to cold, do not, in generally, coincide. Sensitivity 
to pain is everywhere about the same, varying at most in such 
a way that in some places the pain-stimulus acts on the sur- 
face, and in others not until it has penetrated deeper. On 
the other hand, certain approximately punctiform cutaneous 
regions appear to be most favorable for stimulations of 
pressure, hot, and cold. These points are called respectively, 
pressure-spots, hot-spots, and cold-spots. They are distributed 
in different parts of the skin in varying numbers. Spots of dif- 
ferent modality never coincide; still, temperature-spots always 
receive sensations of pressure and pain as well; and a pointed 
hot stimulus applied to a cold spot always causes a sen- 
sation of hot, while hot-spots do not seem to be stimulated 
by pointed cold stimuli. Furthermore, hot-spots and cold- 
spots react with their adequate sensations to properly applied 
mechanical and electrical stimuli. 
8. Of the four qualities mentioned sensations of pressure 
and pain form closed systems which show no relations either 
to each other or to the two systems of temperature-sensations. 
These last two, on the other hand, stand in the relation of 
opposites; we apprehend hot and cold not merely as different, 
but as contrasted sensations. It is, however, very probable 
that this is not due to the original nature of the sensations,
-P-A-G-E-66
  48 I. Psychical Elements. 
but partly to the conditions of their rise, and partly to the 
accompanying feelings. For, while the other qualities may 
be united without limitation to form mixed sensations — as, 
for example, pressure and hot, pressure and pain, cold and 
pain — hot and cold exclude each other because, under the 
conditions of their rise, the only possibilities for a given cu- 
taneous region are a sensation of hot or one of cold, or else 
an absence of both. When one of these sensations passes 
continuously into the other, the change regularly takes place 
in such a way that either the sensation of hot gradually dis- 
appears and a continually increasing sensation of cold arises, 
or vice versa the sensation of cold disappears and that of hot 
gradually arises. Then, too, elementary feelings of opposite 
character are connected with hot and cold, the point where 
both sensations are absent corresponding to their indifference- 
zone. 
In still another respect the two systems of temperature- 
sensations are peculiar. They are to a great extent depen- 
dent on the varying conditions under which the stimuli act 
upon the sense-organ. A considerable increase above the 
temperature of the skin is perceived as hot, while a con- 
siderable decrease below the same is perceived as cold, but 
the temperature of the skin itself, which is the indifference- 
zone between the two, can adapt itself rapidly to the existing 
external temperature within fairly wide limits. The fact that 
in this respect too, both systems are alike, favors the view 
that they are interconnected and also antagonistic. 
B. SENSATIONS OF SOUND. 
9. We possess two independent systems of simple auditory 
sensations, which are generally, however, connected as a result 
of the mixture of the two kinds of impressions. They are
-P-A-G-E-67
  
§ 6. Pure Sensations. 49 
the homogeneous system of simple noise-sensations and the 
complex system of simple tone-sensations. 
Simple noise-sensations can be produced only. under con- 
ditions that exclude the simultaneous rise of tonal sensations, 
as when air-vibrations are produced whose rate is either too 
rapid or too slow for tone-sensations to arise, or when the 
sound-waves act upon the ear for too short a period. Simple 
sensations of noise, thus produced, may vary in intensity and 
duration, but apart from these differences they are qualita- 
tively alike. It is possible that small qualitative differences 
also exist among them, due to the conditions of their rise, 
but such differences are too small to be marked by distin- 
guishing names. The noises commonly so called are com- 
pound ideas made up of such simple noise-sensations and of 
a great many’ irregular tonal sensations (cf. § 9, 7). The 
homogeneous system of simple noise-sensations is probably 
the first to develop. The auditory vesicles of the lower 
animals, with their simple otoliths, could hardly produce any- 
thing but these. In the case of man and the higher animals 
it may be surmised that the structures found in the vestibule 
of the labyrinth receive only homogéneous stimulations, corre- 
sponding to simple sensations of noise. Finally, experiments 
with animals deprived of their labyrinths, make it probable that 
even direct stimulations of the auditory nerve can produce 
such sensations (p. 41). In the embryonic development of 
the higher animals, the cochlea develops from an original 
vestibular vesicle, which corresponds exactly to a primitive 
auditory organ. We are, therefore, justified in supposing that 
the complex system of tonal sensations is a product of the 
differentiation of the homogeneous system of simple noise- 
sensations, but that in every case where this development., 
has taken place, the simple system has remained along with 
the higher.

  50 I. Psychical Elements. 
10. The system of stmple tone-sensations is a continuity 
of one dimension. We call the quality of the single simple 
tones pitch. The one-dimensional character of the system 
finds expression in the fact that, starting with a given pitch, 
we can vary the quality only in tro opposite directions: 
one we call raising the pitch, the other lowering it. In 
actual experience simple sensations of tone are never pre- 
sented alone, but always united with other tonal sensations 
and with accompanying simple sensations of noise. But 
since, according to the scheme given above (§ 5, 1), these 
concomitant elements can be varied indefinitely, and since 
in many cases they are relatively weak in comparison 
with one of the tones, the abstraction of simple tones was 
early reached through the practical use of tonal sensations 
in the art of music. The names ¢, c*, d*, and d stand 
for simple tones, though the clangs of musical instruments 
or of the human voice by means of which we produce these 
different pitches, are always accompanied by other, weaker 
tones and often, too, by noises. But since the conditions 
for the rise of such concomitant tones can be so varied that 
they become very weak, it has been possible to produce 
really simple tones of nearly perfect purity. The simplest 
ineans of doing this is by using a tuning-fork, and a resonator 
tuned to its fundamental tone. Since the resonator increases 
the intensity of the fundamental only, the other, accom- 
panying tones are so weak when the fork sounds, that 
the sensation is generally apprehended as simple and irre- 
ducible. If the sound-vibrations corresponding to such a 
tonal sensation are examined, they will be found to corre- 
spond to the simplest possible form of vibration, the pendulum- 
oscillation, so called because the vibrations of the atmospheric 
particles follow the same laws as a pendulum oscillating in

a very small amplitude'), That these relatively simple sound- 
vibrations correspond to sensations of simple tones, and that 
we can even distinguish the separate tones in compounds, can 
be explained, on the basis of the physical laws of sympathetic 
vibrations, from the structure of the organs in the cochlea. 
The basilar membrane in the cochlea is in its different parts 
tuned to tones of different pitch, so that when a simple 
oscillatory sound-vibration strikes the ear, only the part 
tuned to that particular pitch will vibrate in sympathy. If the 
same rate of oscillation comes in a compound sound-vibration, 
again only the part tuned to it wll be affected by it, while 
the other components of the wave will set in vibration other 
sections of the membrane, which correspond in the same way 
to their pitch. 
11. The system of tonal sensations shows its character 
as a continuous series in the fact that it is always possible 
to pass from a given pitch to any other through continuous 
changes in sensation. Music has selected at option from this 
continuity single sensations separated by considerable inter- 
vals, thus substituting a tonal scale for the tonal line. This 
selection, however, is based on the relations of tonal sensations 
themselves. We shall return to the discussion of these 
relations later, in taking up the ideational compounds arising 
from these sensations (§ 9). The natural tonal line has two 
extremities, which are conditioned by the physiological capacity 
of the ear for receiving sounds. These extremities are the 
lowest and highest tones; the former corresponds to 8—10 
double vibrations per second, the latter to 40,000—50,000. 
1) Pendulum-oscillations may be represented by a sime-curve, be- 
cause the distance from the position of rest is always proportional 
to the sine of the time required to swing to the point in question.

C. SENSATIONS OF SMELL AND TASTE. 
12. Sensations of smell form a complex system whose 
arrangement is still unknown. All we know is that there 
is a very great number of olfactory qualities, between which 
there are all possible transitional forms. There can, then, be 
no doubt that the system is a continuity of many dimensions. 
12a. Olfactory qualities may be grouped in certain classes, 
each of which contains those sensations which are more or less 
related. This fact may be regarded as an indication of how these 
sensations may perhaps be reduced to a small number of prin- 
cipal qualities. Such classes are, for examples, sensations like 
those from ether, balsam, musk, benzine, those known as aromatic, 
etc. It has been observed in a few cases that certain olfactory 
sensations which come from definite substances, can also be pro- 
duced by mixing others. But these observations are still in- 
sufficient to reduce the great number of simple qualities con- 
tained in each of the classes mentioned, to a limited number of 
primary qualities and their mixtures. Finally, it has been observed 
that many odors neutralize each other, so far as the sensation 
is concerned, when they are mixed in the proper intensi- 
ties. This is true not only of substances that neutralize each 
other chemically, as acetic acid and ammonia, but also of 
others, such as caoutchouc and wax or tolu-balsam, which do 
not act on each other chemically outside of the olfactory cells. 
Since this neutralization takes place when the two stimuli act on 
entirely different olfactory surfaces, one on the right and the 
other on the left mucous membrane of the nose, it is probable 
that we are dealing, not with phenomena analogous to those ex- 
hibited by complementary colors (22), but with a reciprocal 
central inhibition of sensations. Another observed fact tells 
against the notion that they are complementary. One and the 
same olfactory quality can neutralize several entirely different 
qualities, sometimes even those which in turn neutralize one 
another, while among colors it is always only two fixed qualities 
that are complementary.
-P-A-G-E-71
§ 6. Pure Sensations. 53 
13. Sensations of taste have been somewhat more thoroughly 
investigated, and we can here distinguish fow distinct primary 
qualities. Between these there are all possible transitional 
tastes, which are to be regarded as mixed sensations. The 
primary qualities are sowr, sweet, bitter, and saline. Besides 
these, alkaline and metallic are sometimes regarded as inde- 
pendent qualities. But alkaline qualities show an unmis- 
takable relationship with saline, and metallic with sour, so 
that both are probably mixed sensations (alkaline made up 
perhaps of saline and sweet, metallic of sour and saline). 
Sweet and saline are opposite qualities. When these two 
sensations are united in proper intensities, the result is a 
neutral mixed sensation (commonly known as “insipid”), even 
though the stimuli that here reciprocally neutralize each other 
do not enter into a chemical combination. The system of taste- 
sensations is, accordingly, in all probability to be regarded as 
a two-dimensional continuity, which may be geometrically 
represented by a circular surface on whose circumference the 
four primary, and their intermediate, qualities are arranged, 
while the neutral mixed sensation is in the middle, and the 
other transitional taste-qualities on the surface, between this 
middle point and the saturated qualities on the circumference. 
13a. In these attributes of taste-qualities we seem to have 
the fundamental type of a chemical sense. In this respect taste 
is perhaps the antecedent of sight. The obvious interconnection 
with the chemical nature of the stimulation, makes it probable 
even here that the reciprocal neutralization of certain sensations, 
with which the two-dimensional character of the sensational 
system is perhaps connected, depends, not on the sensations in 
themselves, but on the relations between the physiological stimu- 
lations, just as in the case of sensations of hot and cold (p. 48). 
It is well known that very commonly the chemical effect of 
certain substances can be neutralized through the action of cer- 
tain other substances. Now, we do not know what the chemical
-P-A-G-E-72
  54 I. Psychical Elements. 
changes are that are produced by the gustatory stimuli in the 
taste-cells. But from the neutralization of sensations of sweet 
and saline we may conclude, in accordance with the principle of 
the parallelism of changes in sensation and in stimuli jp. 45), 
that the chemical reactions which sweet and saline substances 
produce in the sensory cells, also counteract each other. The 
same would hold for other sensations for which similar relations 
could be demonstrated. In regard to the physiological conditions 
for gustatory stimulations, we can draw only this one conclusion 
from the facts mentioned, namely, that the chemical processes of 
stimulation corresponding to the sensations which neutralize each 
other in this way, probably take place in the same cells. Of course, 
the possibility is not excluded that several different processes 
liable to neutralization through opposite reactions, could arise in 
the same cells. The known anatomical facts and the experiments 
of physiology in stimulating single papillae separately, give no 
certain conclusions in this matter. Whether we are here dealing 
with phenomena that are really analogous to those exhibited by 
complementary colors (v. inf. 22) is still a question. 
D. SENSATIONS OF LIGHT. 
14. The system of light-sensations is made up of two 
partial systems: that of sensations of achromatic light and 
that of sensations of chromatic light. Between the qualities 
in these two, all possible transitional forms exist. 
Sensations of achromatic light, when considered alone, 
form a complex system of one dimension, which extends, like 
the tonal line, between two limiting qualities. The sensations 
in the neighborhood of one of these limits we call black, in 
the neighborhood of the other azhite, while between the two 
we insert grey in its different shades (dark grey, grey, and 
light grey). This one-dimensional system of achromatic 
sensations differs from that of tones in being at once a 
system of quality and of intensity; for every qualitative 
change in the direction from black to white is seen at the
-P-A-G-E-73
    § 6. Pure Sensations. 5D 
same time as an increase in intensity, and every qualitative 
change in the direction from white to black is seen as a decrease 
in intensity. Each point in the series, which thus has a def- 
inite quality and intensity, is called a degree of brightness 
of the achromatic sensations. The whole system may, accord- 
ingly, be designated as that of sensations of pure brightness. 
The use of the word “pure” indicates the absence of all sen- 
sations of color. The system of pure brightness is absolutely 
one-dimensional for, both the variations in quality and those 
in intensity belong to one and the same dimension. It 
differs essentially, in this respect, from the tonal line, in which 
each point is merely a degree of quality, and has also a whole 
series of gradations in intensity. Simple tone-sensations 
thus form a two-dimensional continuity so soon as we take 
into account both determinants, quality and intensity, while 
the system of pure brightness is always one-dimensional, even 
when we attend to both determinants. The whole system 
may, therefore, be regarded as a continuous series of grades 
of brightness, in which the lower grades are designated black 
so far as quality is concerned, and weak in point of inten- 
sity, while the higher gifades are called white and strong. 
15. Sensations of color also form a one-dimensional system 
when their qualities alone are taken into account. Unlike 
the system of sensations of pure brightness, this system returns 
upon itself from whatever point we start, for at first, after 
leaving a given quality, we pass gradually to a quality that 
shows the greatest difference, and going still further we find 
that the qualitative differences become smaller again, until 
finally we reach the starting point once more. The color- 
spectrum obtained by refracting sunlight through a prism, or 
that seen in the rainbow, shows this characteristic, though not 
completely. If in these cases we start from the red end of 
the spectrum, we come first to orange, then to yellow, yellow-
-P-A-G-E-74
  56 I. Psychical Elements. 
green, green-blue, blue, indigo-blue, and finally to violet, 
which is more like red than any of the other colors except 
orange, which lies next to red. The line of colors in the 
spectrum does not return quite to its starting-point, because 
it does not contain all of the colors that we have in sen- 
sation. Purple-red shades, which can be obtained by the ob- 
jective mixture of red and violet rays, are wanting in the 
spectrum. Only when we fill out the spectral series with 
them, is the system of actual color-sensations complete, 
and then the system is a closed circle. This characteristic 
is not to be attributed to the circumstance that the spectrum 
actually presents for our observation a series returning nearly 
to its beginning. The same order of sensations can be found 
by arranging according to their subjective relationship, colored 
objects presented in any irregular order. Even children who 
have never observed attentively a solar spectrum or a rain- 
bow, and can, therefore, begin the series with any other color 
just as well as with red, always arrange them in the same order. 
The system of pure colors is, then, to be defined as one- 
dimensional. It does not extend in a straight line, however, 
but returns upon itself. Its simplest geometrical represen- 
tation would be a circle. From a given point in this system 
we pass, when the sensation is gradually varied, first to similar 
sensations, then to those most markedly different, and finally 
to others similar to the first quality, but in the opposite 
direction. Every color must, accordingly, be related to one 
other particular color as a maximum of difference in sen- 
sation. This color may be called the opposite color, and in 
the representation of the color-system by a circle, two oppo- 
site colors are to be placed at the two extremities of the 
same diameter. Thus, for example, purple-red and green, 
yellow and blue, light green and violet, are opposite colors, that 
is, colors which exhibit the greatest qualitative differences.
-P-A-G-E-75
§ 6. Pure Sensations. ; 57 
The quality determined. by the position of a sensation in 
the color-system, in distinction to other qualitative deter- 
minations, is called color-tone, a figurative name borrowed 
from tonal sensations. In this sense the simple names of 
colors; such as red, orange, yellow, etc., denote merely color- 
tones. The color-circle is a representation of the system of 
color-tones abstracted from all the other attributes belonging 
to the sensations. In reality, every color-sensation has two 
other attributes, one we call its saturation, the other its 
brightness. Saturation is peculiar to chromatic ‘sensations, 
while brightness belongs to achromatic sensations as well. 
16. By saturation we mean the attribute of color-sensa- 
tions by virtue of which they appear in all possible stages of 
transition to sensations of pure brightness, so that a con- 
tinuous passage is possible from every color to any point in 
the series of whites, greys, and blacks. The term “satura- 
tion” is borrowed from the common method of producing 
these transitional colors objectively, that is, by the more or 
less intense saturation of some colorless soluble with color- 
pigment. A color may be ever so saturated, yet it is possible 
to think of a still greater saturation of the same color-tone, 
and, on the other hand, pure brightness always denotes the 
end of the series of diminishing grades of saturation for any 
color whatever. A degree of saturation may, therefore, be 
thought of as an attribute of all color-sensations, and, at 
the same time, as the attribute by which the system of 
color-sensations is directly united with that of sensations of 
pure brightness. If, now, we represent some particular sen- 
sation of white, grey, or black by the central point of the 
color-circle, all the grades of saturation that can arise as 
transitional stages from any particular color to this particular 
sensation of pure brightness, will obviously be represented 
by that radius of the circle which connects the centre with
-P-A-G-E-76
    58 I. Psychical Elemenis. 
the color in question. If the grades of saturation correspond- 
ing to the continuous transitional stages from all the colors 
to a particular sensation of pure brightness, are thus geo- 
metrically represented, we have the system of saturation-grades 
as a circuar surface whose circumference is the system of 
simple color-tones, and whose centre is the sensation of pure 
brightness, corresponding to the absence of all saturation. 
For the formation of such a system of saturation-grades any 
point whatever in the series of sensations of pure bright- 
ness may be taken, so long as the condition is fulfilled that 
the white is not too bright or the black too dark, for in such 
cases differences in both saturation and color disappear. 
Systems of saturation which are arranged about different 
points in the series of pure brightness, always have different 
grades of brightness. A pure system of saturation, accord- 
ingly, can be made for only one particular grade of bright- 
ness at a time, that is, for only one point in the series of 
sensations of pure brightness. When such systems are made 
for all possible points, the system of saturation will be sup- 
plemented by that of grades of brightness. 
17. Brightness is just as necessary an attribute of a 
color-sensation as it is of achromatic sensations, and is in 
this case, too, at once a quality and degree of intensity. 
Starting from a given grade, if the brightness increases, every 
color approaches white in quality, while at the same time 
the intensity increases; if the brightness decreases, the colors 
approach black in quality, and the intensity diminishes. The 
grades of brightness for any single color thus form a system 
of intensive qualities, analogous to that of pure brightnesses, 
only in place of the achromatic gradations between white 
and black, we have the corresponding grades of saturation. 
From the point of greatest saturation there are two opposite 
directions for variation in saturation: one positive, towards
-P-A-G-E-77
  § 6. Pure Sensations. 59 
white, accompanied by an increase in the intensity of the 
sensation, and the other negative, towards black, with a 
corresponding decrease in intensity. As limits for these two 
directions we have, on the one hand, the pure sensation white, 
on the other, the pure sensation black; the first is at the 
same time the maximum, the second the minimum of inten- 
sity. White and black are in this way opposite extremities 
of the system of sensations of pure brightness, and also of 
the system of color-sensations arranged according to grades 
of brightness. It follows obviously that there is a certain 
medium brightness for every color, at which its saturation is 
greatest. From this point, the saturation diminishes in the 
positive direction when the brightness increases, and in the 
negative direction when the brightness decreases. The grade 
of brightness most favorable for the saturation is not the 
same for all colors, but varies from red to blue, in such a 
way that it is most intense for red and least intense for 
blue. This accounts for the familiar phenomenon that in 
twilight, when the degree of brightness is small, the blue 
color-tones — of paintings, for example — are still clearly 
visible, while the red color-tones appear black. 
18. If we neglect the somewhat different position of the 
maximal saturation of the various colors in the line of brightness, 
the relation that exists between sensations of chromatic 
brightness and those of pure, or achromatic, brightness, by 
virtue of the gradual transition of colors into white on the 
one hand, and into black on the other, may be represented 
in the simplest manner as follows. First, we may represent 
the system of pure color-tcnes, that is, of the colors at their 
maximal saturation, by a circle, as above. Then we may 
draw through the centre of this ciréle, perpendicular to 
its plane, the straight line of pure brightness, in such a 
way that where it cuts the plane of the circular surface, 
 
-P-A-G-E-78
  60 I. Psychical Elements. 
it represents the sensation of pure brightness corresponding 
to the minimum of saturation for the colors with which we 
started. In like manner, the other color-circles for increasing 
and decreasing grades of brightness, may be arranged per- 
pendicularly along this line, above and below the circle 
of greatest saturation. But the decreasing saturation of the 
colors in these latter circles must be expressed in the short- 
ening of their radii; just as in the first circle, the shorter the 
distance from the centre, the less the saturation. These 
radii grow continually shorter, until finally, at the two extrem- 
ities of the line, the circles disappear entirely. This corre- 
sponds to the fact that for every color the maximum of 
brightness corresponds to the sensation white, while its mini- 
mum corresponds to black'). 
19. The whole system of sensations of chromatic bright- 
ness may, accordingly, be most simply represented by a spher- 
ical surface whose equator represents the system of pure 
color-tones, or colors of greatest saturation, while the two 
poles correspond to white and black, the extremities of the 
sensations of chromatic brightness. Of course, any other geo- 
metrical figure with similar attributes, as, for example, two 
cones with a common base and apexes pointing in different 
directions, would serve the same purpose. The only thing 
essential for the representation, is the gradual transition to 
white and black, and the corresponding decrease in the 
variety of the color-tones, which finds its expression in the 
continual decrease in the length of the radii of the color-circles. 
Now, as above shown, the system of saturations corresponding to 
  
1) It must be observed, however, that the actual, coincidence of 
these sensations can be empirically proved only for the minimum 
of brightness. Grades of brightness which approach the maximum 
are so injurious to the eye that the general demonstration of the 
approach to white must be accepted as sufficient.
-P-A-G-E-79
§ 6. Pure Sensations. 61 
a particular sensation of pure brightness, may be represented 
by a circular surface which contains all the sensations of 
light belonging to one grade of brightness. When we unite 
grades of saturation and brightness to a single system, the 
total system of all light sensations may be represented by a solid 
sphere. The equator is the system of pure color-tones; the 
polar axis is the system of pure brightnesses; the surface 
represents the system of chromatic brightnesses, and, finally, 
every circular plane perpendicular to the polar axis, corre- 
sponds to a system of saturations of equal brightness. This 
representation by means of a sphere is indeed arbitrary, in 
the sense that any other solid figure with analogous attri- 
butes may be chosen in its place; still, it presents to view 
the psychological fact that the total system of light-sensations 
ts a closed continuity of three dimensions. The three-dimen- 
sional character of the system arises from the fact that every 
concrete sensation of light has three determinants: color-tone, 
saturation, and brightness. Pure, or achromatic, brightness 
and pure, or saturated, colors are to be regarded as the 
two extreme cases in the series of saturations. The closed 
form of the system comes from the circular character of the 
color-line, on the one hand, and, on the other, from the 
termination of the system of chromatic brightness in the ex- 
tremes of pure brightness. A special characteristic of the 
system is that only the changes in the two dimensions, or 
those of color-tones and saturations, are pure variations in 
quality, while every movement in the dhird dimension, or 
that of brightness, is at once a modification of both quality 
and intensity. As a consequence of this circumstance, the 
whole three-dimensional system is required to represent fully 
the qualities of light-sensations, but it includes also the in- 
tensities of these sensations. 
20. Certain principal sensations are prominent in this
-P-A-G-E-80
  62 I. Psychical Elements. 
system, because we use them as points of reference for the 
arrangement of all the others. These are white and black, 
in the achromatic series, and the four principal colors, ved, 
yellow, green, and blue, in the chromatic. Only these six 
sensations have clearly distinguished names in the early de- 
velopment of language. All other sensations are then named 
either with reference to these or even with modifications of 
the names themselves. Thus, we regard grey as a stage in 
the achromatic series lying between white and black. We 
designate the different grades of saturation according to their 
brightness, as whitish or blackish, light or dark color-tones; 
and we generally choose compound names for the colors be- 
tween the four principal ones, as, for example, purple-red, 
orange-yellow, yellow-green, etc. These all show their relatively 
late origin by their very composition. 
20a. From the early origin of the names for the six qualities 
mentioned, the conclusion has been drawn that they are funda- 
mental qualities of vision, and that the others are compounded 
from them. Grey is declared to be a mixture of black and 
white, violet and purple-red to be mixtures of blue and red, etc. 
Psychologically there is no justification for calling any light- 
sensations compound in comparison with others. Grey is a simple 
sensation just as much as white or black; such colors as orange 
and purple-red are just as much simple colors as red and yellow; 
and any grade of saturation which we have placed in the 
system between a pure color and white, is by no means, for that 
reason, a compound sensation. The closed, continuous character 
of the system makes it necessary for language to pick out certain 
especially marked differences in reference to which all other 
sensations are then arranged, for the simple reason that it is 
impossible to have an unlimited number of names. It is most 
natural that white and black should be chosen as such points 
of reference for the achromatic series, since they designate the 
greatest differences. When once these two are given, however, 
all other achromatic sensations will be considered as transitional
-P-A-G-E-81
§ 6. Pure Sensations. 63 
sensations between them, since the extreme differences are 
connected by a series of all possible grades of brightness. The 
case of color-sensations is similar; only here, on account of the 
circular form of the color-line, it is impossible to choose directly 
two absolutely greatest differences. Other motives besides the 
necessary qualitative difference, are decisive in the choice of the 
principal colors. We may regard as such motives, the frequency 
and affective intensity of certain light-impressions due to the 
natural conditions of human existence. The red color of blood, 
the green of vegetation, the blue of the sky, and the yellow of 
the heavenly bodies in contrast with the blue of the sky, may 
well have furnished the earliest occasions for the choice of cer- 
tain colors as those to receive names. Language generally names 
the sensation from the object that produced it, not the object 
from. the sensation. In this case too, when certain principal 
qualities were once determined, all others must, on account of 
the continuity of the series of sensations, seem to be intermediate 
color-tones. The difference between principal colors and tran- 
sitional colors is, therefore, very probably due entirely to external 
conditions. If these conditions had been other, red might have 
been regarded as a transitional color between purple and orange, 
just as orange is now placed between red and yellow’). 
21. The attributes of the system of light-sensations above 
described, are so peculiar as to lead us to expect a prioré that 
the relation between these psychological attributes and the 
objective processes of stimulation, is essentially different from 
that in the cases of the sensational systems discussed before, 
especially those of the general and auditory senses. Most 
1) The same false reasoning from the names of sensations, has 
even led some scholars to assume that the sensation blue developed 
later than other color-sensations, because, for example, even in Homer 
the word for blue is the same as that for “dark”. Tests of ‘he color- 
sensations of uncivilized peoples whose languages are mich more 
deficient in names for colors than that of the Greeks at th time of 
Homer, have given us a superabundance of evidence that this as- 
sumption is utterly without ground.
-P-A-G-E-82
  64 I. Psychical Elements. 
striking, in this respect, is the difference between the system 
in question and that of tones. In the latter case, the prin- 
ciple of parallelism between sensation and stimulus (p. 45), 
holds not only for the physiological processes of stimulation, 
but to « great extent for the physical processes as well. A 
simple sensation corresponds to a simple form of sound- 
vibration, and a plurality of simple sensations to a compound 
form. Furthermore, the intensity of the sensation varies in 
proportion to the amplitude of the vibrations, and its quality 
with their form, so that in both directions the subjective 
difference between sensations increases with the growing differ- 
ence between the objective physical stimuli. The relation in the 
case of light-sensations is entirely different. Like objective 
sound, objective light also consists of vibrations in some medium. 
To be sure, the actual form of these vibrations is still a 
question, but from physical experiments on the phenomena of 
interference we know that they consist of very short and rapid 
waves. Those seen as light vary in wave-length from 688 
to 393 millionths of a millimetre, and in rate from 450 to 
790 billion vibrations per second. In this case, too, simple 
sensations correspond to simple vibrations, that is, vibrations 
of like wave-length; and the quality of the sensation varies 
continuously with the rate: red corresponds to the longest 
and slowest waves, and violet to the shortest and most 
rapid, while the other color-tones form a continuous series 
between these, varying with the changes in wave-length. Even 
here, however, an essential difference appears, for the colors 
red and violet, which are the most different in wave-length, 
are more similar in sensation than those which lie between’). 
  
1) Many physicists, to be sure, believe that an analogous relation 
is to be found between tones of different pitch, in the fact that every 
tone has in its octave a similar tone. But this similarity, as we
-P-A-G-E-83
    § 6. Pure Sensations. 65 
There are also other differences. 1) Every change in the 
amplitude of the physical vibrations corresponds to a sub- 
jective change in both intensity and quality, as we noted 
above in the discussion of sensations of brightness. 2) All 
light, even though it be made up of all the different kinds of 
vibration, is simple in sensation, just as much as objectively 
simple light, which is made up of only one kind of waves, as 
is immediately apparent if we make a subjective comparison of 
sensations of chromatic light with those of achromatic light. 
From the first of these facts it follows that light which is 
physically simple may produce not only chromatic, but also 
achromatic sensations, for it approaches white when the am- 
plitude of its vibrations increases, and black when the ampli- 
tude decreases. The quality of an achromatic sensation does 
not, therefore, determine unequivocally its source; it may be 
produced either through a change in the amplitude of objective 
light-vibrations or through a mixture of simple vibrations of 
different wave-lengths. In the first case, however, there is 
always connected with the change in amplitude a change in 
the grade of brightness, which does not necessarily take place 
when a mixture is made. 
22. Even when the grade of brightness remains constant, 
this achromatic sensation may have one of several sources. 
A sensation of pure brightness of a given intensity may re- 
sult not only from a mixture of all_ the rates of vibration 
contained in solar light, as, for example, in ordinary day- 
light, but it may also result when only two kinds of light- 
waves, namely those which correspond to sensations sub- 
shall see (§ 9), does not exist between simple tones, but depends on 
the actual sympathetic vibration of the octave in all compound 
clangs. Attempts to support this supposed analogy by finding in the 
color-line intervals corresponding to the various tonal intervals, third, 
fourth, fifth, etc., have all been entirely futile. 
Wonpr, Paychology. 3
-P-A-G-E-84
  66 I. Psychical Elements. 
jectively the most different, that is, to opposite colors, are mixed 
in proper proportions. Since opposite colors, when mixed 
objectively, produce white, they are called complementary 
colors. As examples of such opposite or complementary col- 
ors we may mention spectral red and green-bluc, orange 
and sky-blue, yellow and indigo-blue. 
Like achromatic sensations, each of the color-sensations 
may also, though to a more limited extent, have one of 
several sources. When two objective colors which lie nearer 
each other in the color-circle than opposites, are mixed, the 
mixture appears, not white, but of a color which in the series 
of objectively simple qualities lies between the two with which 
we started. The saturation of the resulting color is, indeed, 
very much diminished when the components of the mixture 
approach opposite colors; but when they are near each other, 
the diminution is no longer perceptible, and the mixture and 
the corresponding simple color are generally subjectively alike. 
Thus, the orange of the spectrum is absolutely indistinguish- 
able from a mixture of red and yellow rays. In this way, 
all the colors in the color-circle between red and green can 
be obtained by mixing red and green, all between green and 
violet by mixing green and violet, and, finally, purple, which 
is not in the solar spectrum, can be produced by mixing red 
and violet. The whole series of color-tones possible in sen- 
sation can, accordingly, be obtained from three objective col- 
ors. By means of the same three colors we can also pro- 
duce white with its intermediate stages. The mixture of red 
and violet gives purple, and this is the complementary color 
of green; and the white secured by mixing these complemen- 
tary colors, when mixed in different proportions with the various 
colors, gives the different grades of saturation. 
23. The three objective colors that may be used in this 
way to produce the whole system of light-sensations, are
-P-A-G-E-85
  § 6. Pure Sensations. 67 
called fundamental colors. In order to indicate their signif- 
icance, a triangular surface is chosen to represent the system 
of saturations, rather than the circular surface which is de- 
rived from the psychological relations alone. The special signif- 
icance of the fundamental colors is then expressed by placing 
them at the angles of the triangle. Along the sides are 
arranged the color-tones in their maximal saturation, just as 
on the circumference of the color-circle, while the other 
grades of saturation in their transitions to white, which lies 
in the centre, are on the triangular surface. Theoretically, 
any set of three colors could be chosen as fundamental col- 
ors, provided they were suitably distant from one another. 
Practically, those mentioned, red, green, and violet, are 
preferable for two reasons. First, by using them we avoid 
having as one of the three, purple, which can not be produced 
by objectively simple light. Secondly, at the two ends of 
the spectrum sensations vary most slowly in proportion to 
the period of vibration, so that when the extreme colors of 
the spectrum are used as fundamental colors, the result ob- 
tained by mixing two neighboring ones is most like the 
intermediate, objectively simple color), 
24. These phenomena show that in the system of light- 
sensations a simple relation does not exist between the 
physical stimuli and the sensations. This can be understood 
from what has been said above (3) as to the character of 
the physiological stimulation. The visual sense is to be 
  
1) In the neighborhood of green this advantage does not exist, 
and the mixtures always appear less saturated than the intermediate 
simple colors. This is a clear proof that the choice of the three 
fundamental colors mentioned is indeed the most practical, but 
nevertheless arbitrary, and at bottom due to the familiar geometrical 
principle that a triangle is the simplest figure that can enclose a 
finite number of points in the same plane.

reckoned among the chemical senses, and we can expect a 
simple relation only between the photochemical processes in 
the retina and the sensations. Now, we know from experience 
that different kinds of physical light produce like chemical 
disintegrations, and this explains in general the possibility 
mentioned above, of having the same sensation from many 
different kinds of objective light. According to the principle 
of parallelism between changes in sensation and in the physio- 
logical stimulation (p. 45), it may be assumed that the various 
physical stimuli which cause the same sensition all produce 
the same photochemical stimulation in the retina, and that 
altogether there are just as many kinds and varieties of the 
photochemical processes as kinds and varieties of distinguishable 
sensations. In fact, all that we know, up to the present time, 
about the physiological substratum of light-sensations is based 
upon this assumption. The investigation of the physiological 
processes of stimulation through light, has not yet given any 
further result than that the stimulation is in all probability 
a chemical process. 
25. The relatively long persistence of the sensation after 
the stimulation that originated it, is explicable on the assumption 
that the light-stimulations are due to chemical processes in 
the retina (3, p. 42). This persistence is called, with reference 
to the object used as stimulus, the after-image of the im- 
pression. At first this after-image appears in the same 
brightness and color as the object: white when the object is 
white, black when it is black, and if it is colored, in the 
same color. These are the positive and like-colored after-images. 
After a short time it passes, in the case of achromatic impres- 
sions, into the opposite grade of brightness, white into black, 
or black into white; in the case of colors, it passes into the 
opposite or complementary color. These are the negative and 
complementary after-images. If light-stimuli of short duration  
-P-A-G-E-87
§ 6. Pure Sensations. 69 
act upon the eye in darkness, this transition may be repeated 
several times. A second positive after-image follows the 
negative, and so on, so that an oscillation between the two 
phases takes place. The positive after-image may be readily 
explained by the fact that the photochemical disintegration 
caused by any kind of light, lasts a short time after the action 
of the light. The negative and complementary after-images 
can be explained by the fact that disintegration in a given 
direction causes a partial consumption of the photochemical 
substance most directly concerned, and this results in a 
corresponding modification of the photochemical processes 
when the stimulation of the retina continues. 
26. The origin of a part of the phenomena included under 
the name light-contrasts and color-contrasts is very probably 
the same as that of the negative and complementary after- 
images. These phenomena consist in the appearance of simul- 
taneous sensations of opposite brightness and color in the 
neighborhood of any light-impression. Thus, a white surface 
appears to be surrounded by a dark margin, a black surface 
by a bright margin, and a colored surface by a margin of 
the complementary color. These phenomena, which are called 
“marginal contrasts” when they are limited to the immediate 
neighborhood of the object, are in part at least nothing but 
negative or complementary after-images that are simultaneously 
visible in the immediate neighborhood of the impression as a 
result of continual weak ocular movements. Whether there 
is also an irradiation of the stimulation is a question; its 
existence still wants certain proof. The fact that these con- 
trasts increase as the light becomes more intense, just as 
after-images do, speaks for their interconnection with the 
latter. In this respect, this physiological contrast differs essen- 
tially from certain psychological contrast-phenomena, with which 
it is generally confused. The latter are closely connected in  
-P-A-G-E-88
  70 I. Psychical Elements. 
their rise with numerous other forms of psychological contrast, 
so that we will not discuss them until later, when we enter 
into the general treatment (§ 17, 9) of such phenomena. 
26a. If we take the principle of parallelism between sensation 
and physiological stimulation as the basis of our suppositions in 
regard to the processes that occur in the retina, we may 
conclude that an analogous independence in the photochemical 
processes corresponds to the relative independence which appears 
between achromatic and chromatic sensations. Two facts, one 
belonging to the subjective sensational system, the other to the 
objective phenomena of color-mixing, can be most naturally ex- 
plained on this basis. The first is the tendency that every color- 
sensation shows, of passing into one of pure brightness when 
the grade of its brightness decreases or increases. ‘This tendency 
is most simply interpreted on the assumption that every color- 
stimulation is made up of two physiological components, one 
corresponding to the chromatic, the other to the achromatic 
stimulation. To this assumption we may easily add the further 
condition, that for certain medium intensities of the stimuli the 
chromatic components are the strongest, while for greater and 
smaller intensities the achromatic components come more and more 
to the front. The second fact is that any two opposite colors are 
complementary; that is, when mixed in suitable proportions, they 
produce an achromatic sensation. This phenomenon is most easily 
understood when we assume that opposite colors, which are subjec- 
tively the greatest possible differences, represent objective photo- 
chemical processes that neutralize each other. The fact that as a 
result of this neutralization an achromatic stimulation arises, is very 
readily explained by the presupposition that such a stimulation 
accompanies every chromatic stimulation from the first, and is 
therefore all that is left when antagonistic chromatic stimulations 
counteract each other. This assumption of a relative independence 
between the chromatic and achromatic photochemical processes, 
is supported in a very striking way by the existence of an ab- 
normity of vision’, sometimes congenital, sometimes acquired 
through pathological changes in the retina, namely total color- 
blindness. In such cases all stimulations are, either on the whole
-P-A-G-E-89
  § 6. Pure Sensations. 7a 
retina or on certain parts of it, seen as pure brightness, without 
any admixture of color. This is an incontrovertible proof that the 
chromatic and achromatic stimulations are separable physiological 
processes. 
If we apply the principle of parallelism to the chromatic 
stimulation, two facts present themselves. ‘The first is that two 
colors separated by a limited, short distance, when mixed give 
a color that is like the intermediate simple color. This indicates 
that color-stimulation is a process that varies with the physical 
stimulus, not continuously, as the tonal stimulation, but in short 
stages, and in such a way that the stages in red and violet are 
longer than in green, where the mixture of colors fairly near 
each other, shows the effects of complementary action. Such a 
non-continuous variation of the process corresponds entirely with 
its chemical nature, for chemical disintegration and synthesis must 
always have to do with groups of atoms or molecules. The 
second fact is that certain definite colors, which correspond to 
rather large differences in the stimuli, are subjectively opposite 
colors, that is, are maximal differences, and the same colors are 
objectively complementary, that is, mutually neutralizing, processes. 
Chemical processes, however, can neutralize each other only when 
they are in some way opposite in character. Any two com- 
plementary color-stimulations must, therefore, stand in a relation 
to each other similar to that which exists between the neutraliz- 
ing processes operative in the case of antagonistic achromatic 
stimulations. Still, there are two very essential differences here. 
First, this opposition in the character of color-stimulations is 
not limited to one case, but appears for every color distinguishable 
in sensation, so that we must conclude, according to our pre- 
supposition, that for every stage of the photochemical process 
of chromatic stimulation which is to be assumed on the ground 
of the results obtained by mixing neighboring colors, there is a 
certain complementary process. Secondly, the difference between 
two opposite colors, which is subjectively the greatest possible 
difference, is mediated by transitional forms, not merely in one 
direction from each color, as in the case of black and white, but 
in two opposite directions. In a similar way, the objective 
complementary action of two colors gradually diminishes as, start- 
ing from opposite colors, they approach each other in either of
-P-A-G-E-90
  72 I. Psychical Elements. 
these two directions. We may, then, infer from this twofold 
elimination of complementary action that the return of the color-line 
to its starting point, corresponds to a repetition of related photo- 
chemical processes, on the same grounds that led us to infer the 
opposite character of the processes corresponding to opposite colors, 
from the fact that they are complementary. The whole process of 
chromatic stimulation, beginning with red and passing beyond violet 
through purple mixtures to its starting point, running parallel, as 
it does, with continuous changes in the wave-length of objective 
light, is to be regarded as an indefinitely long succession of photo- 
chemical processes. All these processes together, form a closed circle 
in which, for every stage, there is a neutralizing opposite anda 
possible transition to this opposite in two different directions. 
We know nothing about the total number of photochemical 
stages in this circle of processes. ‘The numerous attempts made 
to reduce all color-sensations to the smallest possible number of 
such stages, lack adequate foundation. Sometimes they indis- 
criminatingly translate the results of physical color-mixing into 
physiological processes, as in the assumption of three fundamental 
colors, red, green, and violet, from the different mixtures of which 
all sensations of light, even the achromatic, are to be derived 
(Young-Helmholtz hypothesis). Sometimes they start with the 
psychologically untenable assumption that the naming of colors is 
not due to the influence of certain external objects, but to the real 
significance of the corresponding sensations (v. sup. p. 63), and 
assume accordingly four fundamental colors as the sources of all 
color-sensations. The four fundamental colors here assumed are 
the two pairs red and green, yellow and blue, to which are added 
the similar pair of sensations of pure brightness, black and white. 
All other light-sensations such as grey, orange, violet, etc., 
are regarded as subjectively and objectively mixed colors (Her- 
ing’s hypothesis). The evidence in support of the first as of 
the second of these hypotheses has been derived for the most 
part from the not infrequent cases of partial color-blindness. 
Those who accept three fundamental colors, assert that all these 
cases are to be explained as a lack of the red or green sensa- 
tions, or else as a lack of both. Those who accept four, hold 
that partial color-blindness always includes two fundamental 
colors that belong together as opposites, and is, therefore, either
-P-A-G-E-91
  
§ 6. Pure Sensations. 73 
red-green-blindness or yellow-blue-blindness. An unprejudiced 
examination of color-blindness does not justify either of these 
assertions. The three-color theory can not ‘explain total color- 
blindness, and the four-color theory is in contradiction to cases of 
pure red-blindness and pure green-blindness. Finally, both theories 
are overthrown by the cases that unquestionably occur, in 
which such parts of the spectrum as do not correspond to any 
of the three or four fundamental colors, appear colorless. The 
only thing that our present knowledge justifies us in saying, is 
that every simple sensation of light is conditioned physiologically 
by a combination of two photochemical processes, a monochromatic 
and a chromatic. The first is made up, in turn, of a process 
mainly of disintegration, when the light is more intense, and a 
process of restitution, when the light is weaker. The chromatic 
process varies by stages in such a way that the whole series of 
photochemical color-disintegrations forms a circle of processes in 
which the products of the disintegration for any two relatively 
most distant stages, neutralize each other'). 
Various changes as a result of the action of light have been ob- 
served in the living retina, all of which go to support the assump- 
tion of a photochemical process. Such are the gradual change into a 
colorless state, of a substance which in the retina not exposed to 
light is red (bleaching of the visual purple); microscopical 
movements of the pigmented protoplasm between the sensitive 
elements, or rods and cones; and, finally, changes in the form 
of the rods and cones themselves. Attempts to use these 
phenomena in any way for a physiological theory of light- 
stimulation, are certainly premature. The most probable con- 
clusion which we can now draw is that the difference in the 
1) The further assumption is made by the defenders of the four 
fundamental colors, that two opposite colors are related just as bright 
and dark achromatic stimulations, that is, that one of these colors 
is due to a photochemical disintegration (dissimilation), the other to 
a restitution (assimilation). This is an analogy that contradicts the 
actual facts. The result obtained by mixing complementary colors 
is on its subjective side a suppression of the color-sensation, while 
the mixture of white and black, on the other hand, produces an 
intermediate sensation.  
-P-A-G-E-92
  14 L. Psychical Elements. 
forms of the rods and cones is connected with a difference in 
function. The centre of the retina, which is the region of direct 
vision in the human eye, has only cones, while in the eccentric 
parts the rods are more numerous; furthermore, in the centre 
(which also wants the visual purple) the discrimination of colors 
is much better than in the eccentric regions, while the latter 
are much more sensitive to brightness, The natural conclusion 
from these facts is that the differences in sensitivity are connected 
with the photochemical properties of the rods and cones. Still, 
we lack here too any particular evidence. 
§ 7. SIMPLE FEELINGS. 
1. Simple feelings may originate in very many more ways 
than simple sensations, as was noted in § 5. Even such feelings 
as we never observe except in connection with more or 
less complex ideational processes, have a simple character 
(p. 34 sq.). Thus, for example, the feeling of tonal harmony 
is just as simple as the feeling connected with a single tone. 
Several tonal sensations together are required to produce a 
harmony, so that it is a compound so far_as its sensational 
contents are concerned, but the affective quality of certain 
harmonious compound clangs is so different from that of the 
feelings connected with the single tones, that.both classes of 
feelings are, subjectively, equally irreducible. The only essential 
difference between the two is that the feelings which correspond 
to simple sensations can be easily isolated from the inter- 
connections of which they form a part in our experience, by 
the same method of abstraction which we employed in dis-) 
covering the simple sensations (p. 38). Those, on the other 
hand, that are connected with some composite ideational 
compound, can never be separated from the feelings which 
enter into the compound as subjective complements of the
-P-A-G-E-93
§ 7. Simple Feelings. 75 
sensations. Thus, for example, it is impossible to separate 
the feeling of harmony connected with the chord ¢ e g from 
the simple feelings connected with each of the single tones 
ce, e, and g. The latter may, indeed, be pushed into the 
background, for as we shall see later (§ 9, 3a), they always 
unite with the feeling of harmony to form a unitary total 
feeling, but they can never be eliminated. 
2. The feeling connected with a simple sensation is com- 
monly known as a sense-feeling, or the affective tone of a sen- 
sation. These two expressions are capable of misinterpretation 
in two opposite senses. There is a tendency to think that 
by “sense-feeling” we mean not merely a component of imme- 
diate experience that may be isolated through abstraction, 
but one that really exists by itself. “Affective tone”, on the 
other hand, may be regarded as an affective quality that must 
inevitably belong to a sensation, just as “color-tone” is a ne- 
cessary determinant of a color-sensation. In reality, however, 
a sense-feeling without a sensation can no more exist than can 
a feeling of tonal harmony without tonal sensations. When, 
as is sometimes the case, the feelings accompanying sensations 
of pain, of pressure, of hot, and of cold, and muscle-sensa- 
tions, are called independent sense-feelings, it is due to the 
confusion of the concepts sensation and feeling (p. 36) which 
is still prevalent, especially in physiology. As a result of 
this confusion certain sensations, such as those of touch, are 
called “feelings”, and in the case of some sensations accom- 
panied by strong feelings, as sensations of pain, the dis- 
crimination of the two elements is neglected. In the second 
place, it would be just as inadmissable to ascribe to a given 
sensation a definite feeling fixed in quality and intensity. 
The real truth is that in every case the sensation is only one 
of the many factors that determine the feeling present at a 
given moment; besides the sensation, the processes that have
-P-A-G-E-94
  16 I. Psychical Elements. 
gone before and the permanent dispositions — conditions that 
we can only partially account for in special cases — play 
an essential part. The concept “sense-feeling” or “affective 
tone” is, accordingly, in a double sense the product of anal- 
ysis and abstraction: first, we must think of the simple feeling 
as separated from the concomitant pure sensation, and secondly, 
we must pick out from among all the various changing 
affective elements which are connected with a given sensation 
under different conditions, the one that is most constant and 
is connected with the sensation after the removal, so far as 
possible, of all the influences that could disturb or complicate 
the simple effect of the sensation. ; 
The first of these conditions is comparatively easy to 
meet, if we keep in mind the psychological meaning of the 
concepts sensation and feeling. The second is very difficult, 
and, especially in the case of the most highly developed sen- 
sational systems, the auditory and visual, it is never really 
possible to remove entirely such indirect influences. We can 
infer what the pure affective tone of a sensation is, only by 
means of the same method that has already been used for 
the abstraction of pure sensations (§ 5, p. 28)’ ‘Here, too, 
we may assume that only that affective tone which remains 
constant when all other conditions change, belongs to the 
sensation itself. The rule is easily applied to sensation, but 
only with great difficulty to feelings, because the secondary 
influences referred to are generally as closely’ connected 
with the sensation as is the primary occasion of the affective 
tone. Thus, for example, the sensation green arouses almost 
unavoidably the idea of green vegetation, and since there are 
connected with this idea composite feelings whose character 
may be entirely independent of the affective tone of the 
color itself, it is impossible to determine directly whether the 
feeling observed when a green impression is presented, is a
-P-A-G-E-95
  § 7. Simple Feelings. T7 
pure affective tone, a feeling aroused by the attending idea, 
or a combination of both. 
2a. This difficulty has led many psychologists to argue 
against the existence of any pure affective tone whatever. They 
assert that every sensation arouses some accompanying ideas and 
that the affective action of the sensation is due in every case 
to these ideas. But the results of experimental variation of the 
conditions for light-sensations, tell against this view. If the 
attendant ideas were the only sources of the feeling, it would 
necessarily be strongest when the sensational contents of the im- 
pression were most like those of the ideas. This is by no means 
the case. ‘Ihe affective tone of a color is greatest when its grade 
of saturation reaches a maximum. The pure spectral colors 
observed in surrounding darkness have the strongest affective 
tone. These colors are, however, generally very different from 
those of the natural objects to which accompanying feelings 
might refer. There is just as little justification for the attempts 
to derive tonal feelings from such ideas exclusively. It can not 
be doubted that familiar musical ideas may be aroused through 
a single tone; still, on the other hand, the constancy with which 
certain tonal qualities are chosen to express particular feelings, 
as, for example, deep tones to express grave and sad feelings, 
can be understood only under the condition that the correspond- 
ing affective quality belongs to the simple tonal sensation. The 
circle in which the argument moves is still more obvious when 
the affective tones of sensations of taste, smell, and the general 
sense are derived from the accompanying ideas. When, for 
example, the agreeable or disagreeable tone of a taste-sensation 
is increased by the recollection of the same impression as expe- 
rienced before, this can be possible only under the condition that 
the earlier impression was itself agreeable or disagreeable. 
3. The varieties of simple sense-feelings are exceedingly 
numerous. The feelings corresponding to a particular sen- 
sational system also form a system, since, in general, a change 
in the quality or intensity of the affective tone runs parallel 
to every change in the quality or intensity of the sensations. 
 
-P-A-G-E-96
    
78 I. Paychieal Elements. 
At the same time these changes in the affective systems are 
essentially different from the corresponding changes in the 
sensational systems, so that it is impossible to regard the 
affective tone as a third determinant of sensations, analogous 
to quality and intensity. If the intensity of a sensation is 
varied, the affective tone may change not only in intensity, 
but also in quality; and if the quality of the sensation is 
varied, the affective tone usually changes in quality and inten- 
sity both. For example, increase the sensation sweet in 
intensity and it changes gradually from agreeable to dis- 
agreeable. Or, gradually substitute for a sweet sensation 
one of sour or bitter, keeping the intensity constant, it will be 
observed that, for equal intensities, sour and, more especially, 
bitter produce a much stronger feeling than sweet. In gen- 
eral, then, every change in sensation is usually accompanied 
by a twofold change in feeling. The way in which changes 
in the quality and intensity of affective tones are related to 
each other follows the principle already stated (p. 33) that 
every series of affective changes in one dimension ranges 
between opposites, not, as is the case with the corresponding 
sensational changes, between greatest differences. 
4. In accordance with this principle, the greatest quali- 
tative differences in sensations correspond to the greatest 
opposites in affective quality, and to maxima of affective ¢- 
tensity which are either equal or at least approximately equal, 
according to the special pecularities of the qualitative opposites. 
The middle point between these two opposites corresponds to 
an absence of all intensity, so far as only the single dimension 
to which the opposites belong is concerned. This absence of 
intensity can be observed only when the corresponding sen- 
sational system is absolutely one-dimensional. In all other cases, 
a point which is a neutral middle for one particular series of 
sensational differences, belongs at the same time to another
-P-A-G-E-97
  
§ 7. Simple Feelings. 79 
sensational dimension or even to a number of such dimensions, 
in each of which it has a definite affective value. Thus, for 
example, spectral yellow and blue are opposite colors which 
have corresponding opposite affective tones. In passing grad- 
ually along the color-line from one of these to the other, 
green would be the neutral middle between them. But green 
itself stands in affective contrast with its opposite color, 
purple; and, furthermore, it is, like every saturated color, 
one extremity of a series made up of the transitional stages 
of a single color-tone to white. Again, the system of simple 
tonal sensations forms a continuity of only ome dimension, 
but in this case more than in others it is impossible to iso- 
late the corresponding affective tones through abstraction, as 
we did the pure sensations, because in actual experience we 
always have, not only intermediate stages between tones of 
different pitch, but also transitions between absolutely simple 
tones and noises made up of a profusion of simple tones. 
The result of these conditions is that every many-dimensional 
sensational system has a corresponding complex system of 
affective tones, in which every point generally belongs at: 
once to several dimensions, so that the feeling corresponding 
to a given sensation is a resultant of the affective elements 
due to its position in various dimensions of the sensational 
system. It follows that discrimination between simple and 
composite feelings in the sphere of affective qualities, can not 
be carried out. The feeling that corresponds to a particular 
‘sensation, is as a rule, for the reasons given, a product of 
the fusion of several simple feelings, though it is still as 
irreducible as a feeling of originally simple nature (cf. § 12, 3). 
A further consequence is that the neutral middle between 
opposite affective qualities, can be actually found in experi- 
ence only in the special cases where the affective tone of a 
particular sensation corresponds to the neutral middle of all  
-P-A-G-E-98
  80 I. Psychical Elements. 
the dimensions to which it belongs. This special condition 
is obviously fulfilled for the many-dimensional sensational 
systems, especially those of sight and hearing, in just the 
cases in which it is of special practical value for the undis- 
turbed occurrence of affective processes. In the one case, 
sensations of medium brightness and those of the low grades 
of chromatic saturation approximating them, in the other, the 
auditory impressions of our ordinary environment, which are 
between a tone and noise in character (as, for example, the 
human voice), form the neutral indifference-zones of affective 
quality. On both sides of these zones arise the more intense 
affective tones of the more marked sensational qualities. 
The existence of such indifference-zones makes it possible for 
the complex feelings which correspond to the various combi- 
nations of these sensational qualities, to develop almost in- 
dependently, without regard to the accompanying sense-feelings. 
5. The variations in affective quality and intensity that 
run parallel to the grades of sensational intensity, are much 
simpler. They can be most clearly seen in the homogeneous 
sensational systems of the general sense. Each of these 
systems is of a uniform quality throughout, and can be fairly 
well represented geometrically by a single point, so that the 
only possible sensational changes are those of intensity, and 
these can be attended only by a one-dimensional series of 
affective changes between opposites. The neutral indifference- 
zone is, accordingly, always easy to observe in these cases, 
It corresponds to the medium sensations of pressure, hot, 
and cold, that are connected with the normal, medium in- 
tensity of ordinary sense-stimuli. The simple feelings on 
both sides of this zone exhibit decidedly opposite characters, 
and can, in general, be reckoned, on the one side, to pleas- 
urable feelings, on the other, to unpleasurable (v. inf. 6). 
The unpleasurable feelings are the only ones that can be
-P-A-G-E-99
  
§ 7. Simple Feelings. 81 
produced with certainty, by increasing the intensity of the 
sensation. Through habituation to moderate stimuli, such an 
expansion of the indifference-zone has taken place in these 
systems of the general sense, that when the stimuli are weak, 
as a rule only a succession of sensations very different in 
intensity or quality, can produce noticeable feelings. In 
such cases, feelings of pleasure always correspond to sen- 
sations of medium intensity. 
The regular relation between sensational intensity and 
affective tone, can be better observed without this influence 
of contrast, in the case of certain sensations of smell and 
taste. At first a pleasurable feeling arises with weak sen- 
sations and increases with the increasing intensity of the sen- 
sations to a maximum, then it sinks to zero with a certain 
medium sensational intensity, and finally, when this intensity 
increases still more, the feeling becomes unpleasurable and 
increases until the sensational maximum is reached. 
6. The variety of simple affective qualities is exceedingly 
great, much greater than that of sensations. This is due to 
two facts. First, every sensation of the many-dimensional 
systems belongs at once to several series of feelings. Secondly, 
and this is the chief reason, the different compounds arising 
from the various combinations of sensations, such as inten- 
sive, spacial, and temporal ideas, and also certain stages in 
the course of emotions and volitions, have corresponding 
feelings, which are, as above remarked (p. 76), irreducible, 
and must therefore be classed among the simple feelings. 
It is greatly to be regretted: that our names for simple 
feelings are so much more hazy than those for sensations. 
The proper nomenclature of feeling is limited entirely to the 
expression of certain general antitheses, as pleasurable and un- 
pleasurable, agreeable and disagreeable, grave and gay, excited 
and quiet, etc. These designations are usually based on the 
Wenpr, Psychology. 6  
-P-A-G-E-100
  82 I. Psychical Elements. 
emotions into which the feelings enter as elements, and are 
so general that each includes a large number of single 
simple feelings of very different character. In other cases, 
complex ideas whose affective character is similar, are used 
in describing the feelings connected with certain simple im- 
pressions, as, for example, by Goethe in his description of 
the affective tone of colors, and by many musical writers in 
describing the feelings accompanying clangs. This poverty 
of language in special names for the feelings, is a psycho- 
logical consequence of the subjective nature of the feelings. 
All the motives of practical life which give rise to the names 
of objects and their attributes, are here wanting. To con- 
clude, for this reason, that there is a corresponding poverty 
of simple affective qualities themselves, is a gross psycho- 
logical mistake, which is furthermore fatal since it makes an 
adequate investigation of the composite affective processes 
impossible from the first. 
7. In consequence of the difficulties indicated, a complete 
list of simple affective qualities is out of the question, even 
more than is such a list in the case of simple sensations. 
Then, too, there are still other reasons why it would be im- 
possible. The feelings, by virtue of the attributes described 
above, do not form closed systems, as do the sensations 
of tone, of light, or of taste, but are united in a single 
manifold, interconnected in all its parts (p.35). Furthermore, 
the union of certain feelings gives rise to feelings which are 
not only unitary, but even simple in character (p. 75). In this 
manifold of feelings, made up, as it is, of a great variety of 
most delicately shaded qualities, it is nevertheless possible 
to distinguish certain different chief directions, including certain 
affective opposites of predomivant slarasten Such directions 
may always be designated by the t2vo names that indicate 
their opposite extremes. Each name is, however, to be looked
-P-A-G-E-101
§ 7. Simple Feelings. 83 
upon as a collective name including an endless number of 
feelings differing from one another. ; 
Three such chief directions may be distinguished; we will 
call them the direction of pleasurable and unpleasurable 
feelings, that of arousing and subduing (exciting and depress- 
ing) feelings, and finally that of feelings of strain and re- 
laxation. Any concrete feeling may belong to all of these 
directions or only two or even only one of them. The last 
mentioned possibility is all that makes it possible to distin- 
guish the different directions. The combination of different 
affective directions which ordinarily takes place, and the above 
mentioned (p. 79) influences which are due to the overlapping 
of feelings arising from various causes, all go to explain 
why we are perhaps never in a state entirely free from feeling, 
although the general nature of the feelings demands an in- 
difference-zone. 
8. Feelings connected with sensations of the general sense 
and with impressions of smell and taste, may be regarded 
as good examples of pure pleasurable and unpleasurable 
forms. A sensation of pain, for example, is regularly accom- 
panied by an unpleasurable feeling without any admixture of 
other affective forms. In connection with pure sensations, 
arousing and subduing feelings may be observed best in the 
case of color-impressions and clang-impressions. Thus, red is 
arousing, blue subduing. Feelings of strain and relaxation are 
always connected with the temporal course of processes. 
Thus, in expecting a sense-impression, we note a feeling of 
strain, and on the arrival of the expected event, a feeling 
of relaxation. Both the expectation and satisfaction may be 
accompanied at the same time by a feeling of excitement or. 
under special conditions, by pleasurable or unpleasurable 
feelings. Still, these other feelings may be entirely absent, 
and then those of strain and relaxation are recognized as 
6°
-P-A-G-E-102
    84 I. Psychical Elements. 
specific forms which can not be reduced to others, just as 
the two directions mentioned before. The presence of more 
than one direction may be discovered in the case of very 
many feelings which are, nevertheless, simple in quality, just 
as much as the feelings mentioned. Thus, the feelings of 
seriousness and gaiety connected with the sensible impres- 
sions of low and high tones or dark and bright colors, are to 
be regarded as characteristic qualities which are outside the 
indifference-zone in both the pleasurable and unpleasurable 
direction and the exciting and depressing direction. We are 
never to forget here that pleasurable and unpleasurable, ex- 
citing and depressing, are not names of single affective qual- 
ities, but of directions, within which an indefinitely large 
number of simple qualities appear, so that the unpleasurable 
quality of seriousness is not only to be distinguished from 
that of a painful touch, of a dissonance, etc., but even the 
different cases of seriousness itself may vary in their quality. 
Again, the direction of pleasurable and unpleasurable feelings, 
is united with that of feelings of strain and relaxation, in 
the case of the affective tones of rhythms. The regular 
succession of strain and relaxation in these cases is attended 
by pleasure, the disturbance of this regularity by the opposite 
feeling, as when we are disappointed or surprised. Then, too, 
under certain circumstances the feeling may, in both cases, 
be of an exciting or a subduing character. 
9. These examples lead very naturally to the assumption 
that the three chief directions of simple feelings depend on 
the relations in which each single feeling stands to the whole 
succession of psychical processes. In this succession every 
feeling has in general a threefold significance. 1) It repre- 
sents a particular modification of the state of the present 
moment; this modification belongs to the pleasurable and 
unpleasurable direction. 2) It exercises a certain definite 
 
-P-A-G-E-103
§ 7. Simple Feelings. 85 
influence on the sacceeding state; this influence can be distin- 
guished in its opposite forms as excitation and inhibition. 
3) It is determined in its essential character by the preced- 
ing state; this determining influence shows itself in the given 
feeling in the forms of strain and relaxation. These conditions 
also render it improbable that other chief directions of 
feeling exist. 
Qa. Of the three affective directions mentioned, only that of 
pleasurable and unpleasurable feelings has generally been recog- 
nized; the others are reckoned as emotions. But the emotions, 
as we shall see in § 13, come from combinations of feelings; 
it is obvious, therefore, that the fundamental forms of emotions 
must have their antecedents in the affective elements. Some 
psychologists have regarded pleasurable and unpleasurable feel- 
ings, not as collective terms including a great variety of simple 
feelings, but as entirely uniform, concrete states, so that, for 
example, the unpleasurableness of a toothache, of an intellectual 
failure, and of a tragical experience are all regarded as identical in 
their affective contents. Still others seek to identify the feelings 
with special sensations, especially with cutaneous sensations and 
muscle-sensations. Such entirely untenable assertions require no 
criticism. They indicate, however, the uncertain state of the 
doctrine of feelings, even at the present time. 
10. The question has been raised whether or not particular 
physiological processes correspond to the simple feelings, as 
is the case for the sensations. Older psychology was inclined 
to answer this question in the negative, and to contrast the 
feelings as inner, purely psychological, states with sensations 
as processes aroused from without. In modern times, on the 
contrary, the affirmative answer has generally been given, 
but for the most part without the support of adequate em- 
pirical proof. 
Obviously, our assumptions in regard to the physiological 
phenomena accompanying the feelings must he based on
-P-A-G-E-104
  86 I. Psychical. Elements. 
actually demonstrable physiological processes, just as our 
assumptions in regard to the physiological conditions of sen- 
sations were deduced from the structure and functions of 
the sense-organs. In looking for such processes, it follows 
from the subjective nature of the feelings, that we should 
not expect to find them among the processes produced in 
the organism directly by external agents, as the sensations 
are, but rather in reactions which arise indirectly from these 
first processes. The observation of compounds made up of 
affective elements, that is, of emotions and volitions, whose 
easily perceptible concomitants are always external move- 
ments or changes in the state of the organs of movement, 
also points in the same direction. 
The analysis of sensations, and of the psychical compounds 
derived from them, makes direct use of the dmpression- 
method; while the investigation of simple feelings, and of the 
processes resulting from their combinations, can employ this 
method only directly. On the other hand, the expression- 
method, that is, the investigation of the physiological reactions 
of psychical processes, is especially adapted to the examination 
of feelings and processes made up of them, because as shown 
by experience, such reactions are regular symptoms of affective 
processes. All the phenomena in which the inner state of 
the organism is outwardly expressed, may be utilized as aids 
for the expression-method. Such are, besides the movements 
of the external muscles, especially the respiratory and cardiac 
movements, the contraction and dilation of the blood-vessels 
in particular organs, the dilation and contraction of the pupil 
of the eye, etc. The most delicate of these is the beating 
of the heart, which can be examined as exactly reproduced 
in the pulse of some peripheral artery. All other phenomena 
are generally wanting in the case of a simple feeling. It is 
only for high intensities, where the feelings always pass into
-P-A-G-E-105
  § 7. Simple Feelings. 87 
emotions, that we have other, added symptoms, especially 
changes in respiration, and mimetic expressive movements. 
11. Of the chief directions of feeling mentioned above, 
especially that of pleasurable and unpleasurable feelings can be 
shown to stand in regular relation to the pulse. When the 
feeling is pleasurable, the pulse is retarded and intensified, 
when unpleasurable, the pulse is accelerated and weakened. 
For the other directions, the accompanying changes can only 
be inferred with some degree of probability, from the effects 
of the corresponding emotions (§ 13, 5). Thus, exctting feelings 
seem to betray their presence only through stronger pulse- 
beats, and sabdiing through weaker, without a change of rate 
in either case. For feelings of strain, we have retarded and 
weakened pulse, for those of relaxation, accelerated and in- 
tensified pulse. Single feelings belong for the most part to 
several of these directions at the same time; as a result, the 
action of the pulse is in many cases so complex that the most 
that can be concluded is the predominance of one or the 
other direction. The conclusion is, however, uncertain so 
long as it is not confirmed by direct observation of the 
feeling. 
11a. The relations that seem probable from experiments on 
the symptoms of feelings and emotions as found in pulse-activity, 
may be presented in the following scheme. 
Pulse ———

Exciting and subduing feelings, then, show themselves by 
simple changes in the pulse, the others by double changes. But
-P-A-G-E-106
  88 I. Psychical Elements. 
this scheme, which is derived for the most part from the effects 
of complex emotions, needs confirmation from experiments in 
which attention is paid to the isolation of these various affective 
directions. Changes in respiration, muscle-tension, etc., also 
need further investigation. It is obvious from the equivocal 
character of each symptom, that when a particular feeling is given 
in psychical experience, we can infer particular resulting inner- 
vations from the symptoms which appear, but that we can never 
infer the presence of particular feelings from the physiological 
symptoms. It follows that the expression-method can not be as 
highly valued from a psychological point of view as the impression- 
method. From the very nature of the case, the impression- 
method is the only one that can be used in arousing and varying 
psychical processes at will. The expression-method gives results 
that explain only the physiological phenomena which accompany 
feelings, not the psychological nature of the feelings themselves. 
The variations observed in the pulse must be regarded as 
the results of a changed innervation of the heart, coming from 
the cardiac centre in the brain. Physiology shows that the heart 
is connected with the central organs by two kinds of nerves: 
excitatory nerves, which run through the sympathetic system and 
originate indirectly in the medulla, and inhibitory nerves, which 
belong to the tenth cranial nerve (vagus) and also have their 
source in the medulla. The normal regularity of the pulse 
depends on a certain equilibrium between excitatory and inhibitory 
influences. Such influences come not only from the brain, but 
from the centres in the ganglia of the heart itself. Thus, every 
increase and every decrease of the heart's energy may be inter- 
preted in two different ways. The first may be due to an increase of 
excitatory, or to a decrease of inhibitory innervation, and the second 
may be due to a decrease in excitatory or to an increase in inhibitory 
innervation, or in both cases the two influences may be united. We 
have no universally applicable means of investigating these possibil- 
ities, still, the circumstance that the stimulation of the inhibitory 
nerves has a quicker effect than the stimulation of the excitatory, 
gives us good ground in many cases for conjecturing the presence of 
the one or the other. Now, the changes in the pulse always follow 
very quickly the sensations that cause them. It is, therefore, 
probable that in the case of feelings and emotions, we have
-P-A-G-E-107
  
§ 7. Simple Feelings. 89 
chiefly changes in inhibitory innervation, originating in the brain 
and conducted along the vagus. It may well be assumed that 
the affective tone of a sensation on its physiological side, corre- 
sponds to a spreading of the stimulation from the sensory centre 
to other central regions which are connected with the sources 
of the inhibitory nerves of the heart. Which central regions 
are thus affected, we do not know. But the circumstance that 
the physiological substrata for all the elements of our psychological 
experience, are in all probability to be found in the cerebral 
cortex, leads very naturally to the assumption that the same is 
true for the centre of these inhibitory innervations. Further- 
more, the essential differences between the attributes of feelings 
and those of sensations, make it probable that this centre is not 
identical with the sensory centres. If a special cortical region 
is assumed as the medium for these effects, there is no reason 
for supposing a special one for each sensory centre, but the 
complete uniformity in the physiological symptoms goes more 
to show that there is only one such region, which must then 
at the same time serve as a kind of central organ for the con- 
nection of the various sensory centres. (For the further significance 
of such a central region, and its probable anatomical position, 
compare § 15, 2a.)

II. PSYCHICAL COMPOUNDS. 
§ 8. DEFINITION AND CLASSIFICATION OF 
PSYCHICAL COMPOUNDS. 
1. By “psychical compound” we mean any composite 
component of our immediate experience which is marked off 
from the other contents of this experience by particular 
characteristics, in such a way that it is apprehended as a 
relatively independent unity and is, when practical necessity 
demands it, designated by a special name. In developing 
these names, language has followed the general rule that 
only classes and the most important species into which phe- 
nomena may be grouped, shall have special designations, while 
the discrimination of concrete compounds is left to immediate 
perception. Thus, such expressions as ideas, emotions, voli- 
tional acts, etc., designate general classes of psychical com- 
pounds, such expressions as visual ideas, joy, anger, hope, 
etc., special species included in these classes. So far as these 
designations, which have arisen from practical experience, 
are based upon actual distinguishing characteristics, they may 
be retained by science. But science must give an account 
of the nature of these characteristics and also of the pecul- 
iar contents of each of the chief forms of psychical com- 
pounds, in order to give every single term an exact meaning. 
In doing this, we must avoid from the first two presuppo- 
sitions to which the existence of these names might easily 
mislead us. The first is the view that a psychical compound 
 
-P-A-G-E-109
§ 8. Definition and Classification of Psychical Compounds. 91 
is an absolutely independent content of immediate expe- 
rience. The second is the opinion that .certain compounds, 
as, for example, ideas, have the nature of things. The 
truth is that compounds are only relatively independent 
units. Just as they are made up of various elements, so they 
themselves unite to form a complete interconnection, in which 
relatively simple compounds may continually combine to form 
more composite ones. Then, again, compounds, like the 
psychical elements contained in them, are never things, but 
processes which change from moment to moment, so that it 
is only through deliberate abstraction, which is, indeed, in- 
dispensable for the investigation in many cases, that they 
can be thought of as constant at any moment (§ 2, p. 13sq.). 
2. All psychical compounds may be resolved into psychi- 
cal elements, that is, into pure sensations and simple feelings. 
The two kinds of elements behave, however, in an essentially 
different manner, in accordance with the peculiar properties 
of simple feelings as described in § 7. The sensational ele- 
ments found by such a resolution, always belong to one of 
the sensational systems already considered. The affective 
elements, on the other hand, include not only those which 
correspond to the pure sensations contained in the compounds, 
but also those due to the interconnection of the elements into 
a compound. The systems of sensational qualities, accordingly, 
always remain the same, no matter how great a variety of 
compounds arises, while the systems of simple affective qual- 
ities continually increase. Connected with this increase is 
another attribute which is thoroughly characteristic for the 
actual nature of psychical processes. The attributes of 
psychical compounds are never limited to those of the ele- 
ments that enter into them, but mez attributes, peculiar to 
the compounds themselves, always arise as a result of the com- 
bination of these elements. Thus, a visual idea has not only  
-P-A-G-E-110
    92 II. Psychical Compounds. 
the attributes of the light-sensations and of the sensations of 
ocular position and movements contained in it, but also that 
of the spacial arrangement of the sensations, which these 
elements in themselves do not have. Again, a volition is 
not only made up of the ideas and feelings into which its 
single acts may be resolved, but there result from the combi- 
nation of these acts, new affective elements which are specif- 
ically characteristic of the complex volition. Here, again, 
the combinations of sensational and affective elements are 
different. In the first case, on account of the constancy of 
the sensational systems, no new sensations can arise, but 
only peculiar forms of their arrangement. These forms are 
the extensive spacial and temporal manifolds. When, on the 
other hand, affective elements combine, new simple feelings 
arise, which unite with those originally present to make in- 
tensive affective units of composite character. 
3. The classification of psychical compounds is naturally 
based upon the character of the elements that make them 
up. Those composed entirely or chiefly of sensations are 
called ideas, those consisting mainly of affective elements, 
affective processes. The same limitations hold here as in 
the case of the corresponding elements. Although com- 
pounds are more the products of immediate discrimination 
among actual psychical processes than the elements are, still, 
there is at bottom no pure ideational process and no pure 
affective process, but in both cases we can only abstract to 
a certain extent from one or the other component. As in 
the case of the two kinds of elements, so here we can neglect 
the accompanying subjective states when dealing with ideas, 
but must always presuppose some idea for the affective pro- 
cesses. Still, these ideas may be of very different kinds for 
the single species and varieties of affective processes. 
We distinguish, accordingly, three chief forms of ideas:
-P-A-G-E-111
§ 9. Intensive Teas. ; 93 
1) intensive ideas, 2) spacial ideas, 3) temporal ideas; and 
three forms of affective processes: 1) intensive affective com- 
binations, 2) emotions, 3) volitions. Temporal ideas constitute 
a sort of link between the two kinds of processes, for cer- 
tain feelings play an important part in their formation. 
§ 9. INTENSIVE IDEAS. 
1. A combination of sensations in which every element 
is connected with any second element in exactly the same 
way as with any other, is called an intensive idea. Thus, 
for example, a compound clang made up of the tones d fa 
is such an intensive idea. For the immediate apprehension, 
each of the partial combinations into which this compound 
clang can be resolved, as df, da, fd, fa, ad, af, are all entirely 
equivalent, in whatever order they are thought of. This is 
obvious at once if we compare the compound clang with any 
succession of the same tones, where df, da, fd, fa, etc., are 
essentially different ideas. We may define intensive ideas, 
accordingly, as combinations of sensational elements, in which 
the order of the elements may be indefinitely varied. 
It follows from their nature, that intensive ideas do not 
have, arising from the way in which their elements are united 
any characteristics, by means of which they can be resolved 
into separate parts. Such a resolution is possible only through 
the differences in the constituent elements themselves. Thus, 
we discriminate the elements of the compound clang d f a, 
only because we hear in it the qualitatively different tones d, 
f, and a. Still, the separate components in such a unitary 
idea are less clearly distinguishable than in their isolated 
state. This fact, that the elements are pushed into the 
background by the impression of the whole, is of great im- 
   
-P-A-G-E-112
  94 II. Psychical Compounds. 
portance for all forms of ideational combination. We call 
it the fusion of sensations, and in particular, for intensive 
ideas, intensive fusion. If the connection of one element 
with others is so close that it can be perceived as a part of 
the whole only through unusual concentration of the attention 
aided by experimental variation of the conditions, we call the 
fusion complete. If, on the other hand, the elements are im- 
mediately recognized in their proper qualities, and merely 
recede somewhat into the background in comparison with 
the impression of the whole, we call the-fusion tncomplete. 
If certain particular elements are more prominent in their 
characteristic qualities than others, we call them the pre- 
dominating elements. The concept of fusion as heré> defined 
is a psychological concept. It presupposes that the fused 
elements of the idea are really subjectively distinguishable. 
It must not be confounded with the entirely different and 
purely physiological concept of the fusion of external im- 
pressions into a single resultant stimulation. For example, 
when complementary colors unite and give white, the fusion 
is, of course, not psychological. 
In reality, every intensive idea always enters into certain 
spacial and temporal combinations. Thus, for example, a 
compound clang is always a process having a certain duration, 
and is at the same time localized by us in some direction or 
other, though often only very indefinitely. But since these 
temporal and spacial attributes can be indefinitely varied, 
while the intensive character of the ideas remain the same, 
we may abstract from the former in investigating the inten- 
sive attributes. 
2. Among ideas of the general sense we have intensive 
fusions in the form of combinations of sensations of pressure 
with those of hot or cold, or combinations of pain-sensations 
with those of temperature or pressure. All these fusions
-P-A-G-E-113
  § 9. Intensive Ideas. 95 
are incomplete, and very often there is no decidedly pre- 
dominating clement. The combination of, certain sensations 
of smell and taste are more intimate. This is obviously 
favored on the physiological side by the proximity of the 
sense-organs, on the physical side by the regular connection 
between certain stimulations of the two senses. In such cases 
the more intense sensations are generally the predominating 
elements, and when these are the sensation of taste, the 
composite impression is usually regarded as a taste-quality 
only. Thus, most of the impressions known in ordinary life 
as “tastes”, are in reality combinations of tastes and smells. 
The greatest variety of intensive ideas, in all possible grada- 
tions of complexity, are presented by the sense of hearing. 
The relatively most simple of these ideas and those which are 
most closely related to simple tones, are the single clangs. As 
more complex forms, we have compound clangs. Complex noises 
may arise from the latter when they are united with sensa- 
tions of simple noises, and under certain other circumstances. 
3. A. single clang is an intensive idea which is made up 
of a series of tonal sensations regularly graded in quality. 
These elements, the partial tones of the clang, form a complete 
fusion, in which the sensation of the lowest partial tone be- 
comes the predominating element. The pitch of the tone is 
determined ,by this principal tone. The other elements arc 
higher and are, accordingly, called overtones. The overtones 
are all grouped together under the name clang-color as a 
second determinant of the clang, added to the predominating 
tone. All the partial tones that go to determine the clang- 
color are placed along the tonal line at certain regular inter- 
vals from the principal tone. The complete series of possible 
overtones in a clang consists of the first octave of the prin- 
cipal tone, the fifth of this octave, the second octave of the 
principal tone, and the major third and the fifth of this 
 
-P-A-G-E-114
  96 HI. Psychical Compounds. 
second octave, etc. This series corresponds to the following 
proportions between the number of objective tonal waves: 
1 (principal tone), 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, . . . . (overtones). 
When the pitch of the principal tone remains constant, only 
the second determinant of the tonal quality, the clang-color, 
can vary according to the number, position, and relative in- 
tensity of the overtones. In this way we can explain the 
great variety of clang-colors in musical instruments, as 
well as the fact that for every instrument the clang-color 
changes somewhat with the pitch; for in the case of low 
tones the overtones are generally relatively strong, in that 
of high relatively weak, while they disappear entirely when 
they are too high to be audible. Even the slight differences 
in clang-color in single instruments of the same kind, are 
to be explained in the same way. 
From a psychological point of view the chief condition 
for the rise of a single clang, is the complete, or approxima- 
tely complete, fusion of several tonal sensations with only one 
predominating element. As a rule, it is impossible to 
distinguish with the unaided ear the overtones in a clang. 
They can be made perceptible by the use of resonators (re- 
sonator-tubes tuned to the overtones sought), and after they 
have been isolated in this experimental way, the stronger 
ones can be successively heard in the clang, even without 
the aid of the resonators, if the attention is directed to them. 
4. There are three conditions necessary if there is to be 
only one predominating element in a tonal fusion. First, one 
tone must be relatively more intense. Secondly, in its quali- 
tative relations to the other partial tones, the principal tone 
must be the fundamental of a series whose members are all 
harmonious. Thirdly, all the partial tones must be uniformly 
coincident. This coincidence is objectively guaranteed by 
deriving the clang from a unitary source, (that is, producing
-P-A-G-E-115
§ 9. Intensive Ideas. 97 
the clang through the vibrations of one string, one reed-pipe, etc.) 
The result is that the objective vibrations of the partial tones 
always stand in the same relation to one another — a result 
which can not be secured when clangs from several sources are 
united. The first two of these conditions relate to the elements, 
the third to the form of their combinations. The first is the least 
essential to the idea of a single clang. If the second is not 
fulfilled, the combination becomes a compound clang when the 
predominating fundamental is wanting, or a nose when the 
series of tones is not harmonious, or a mixed form between a 
clang and a noise when both parts of the condition are un- 
fulfilled. Ifthe third condition, of constancy in the phases of 
the partial tones, is not met, the clang becomes compound even 
when the first two conditions are complied with. A. series 
of simple clangs from a number of tuning-forks which should 
unite to a single clang so far as intensity and quality are 
concerned, always produces in reality the idea of a com- 
pound clang?) 
5. A compound clang is an intensive combination of single 
clangs. It is in general an incomplete fusion with several 
predominating elements. There are, as a rule, all possible 
1) The case is different when the fundamental itself contains 
overtones of noticeable intensity, which are also repeated as inde- 
pendent clangs in the compound tone. The single clangs of such 
a series arrange themselves in the same phases as these overtones, 
and the compound clang has the character of a single clang with 
very strong overtones. Helmholtz concluded from experiments in 
which he combined in various ways simple clangs from tuning-forks, 
that differences in phase have no influence on the clang-color. But 
as the idea of a single clang can not be produced in this way, it is 
probable that an entirely constant relation of the phases of different 
tonal vibrations from independent sources can never be brought 
about with this method. Experiments by R. Koenig tell for the in- 
fluence on the clang-color, of the form of the clang as determined 
by the relation of the vibration-phases.

grades of fusion in a compound clang, especially when it is 
made up of single clangs of composite quality. In such a 
case, not only does every single clang form a complete fusion 
in itself, but these single clangs fuse the more completely 
with one another the more their fundamentals approach the 
relation of elements of a single clang. So it comes that in 
a compound clang made up of single clangs rich in overtones, 
those components whose fundamentals correspond to the 
overtones of some other single clang in the compound, fuse 
more completely with this related clang than with others. 
The other clangs, in turn, fuse the more completely the more 
their relation approaches that of the first members of a series 
of overtones. Thus, in the compound clang ¢ eg c’ the clangs 
ce and c’ form a nearly complete fusion, while the fusions of 
the clangs ¢ and g, c¢ and e, are incomplete. Still less 
complete is the fusion between ¢ and e’, A measure for 
the degree of fusion may be obtained in all these cases by 
allowing an observer to hear the compound clang for a very 
brief interval, after which he is to decide whether he perceived 
only one clang or several. This experiment is repeated many 
times, and the relative number of judgments in favor of the 
unity of the clang is a measure for the degree of fusion. 
6, Besides the elements contained in the single clangs of 
a compound, there are always, arising from the combination 
of vibrations in the auditory organ, additional elements which 
cause new tonal sensations, characteristic for the different 
kinds of compound clangs. These may also fuse more or less 
completely with the original clang. They are sensations of 
difference-tones; they correspond, as their name indicates, to 
the difference between the number of vibrations in two pri- 
mary tones. They may have a twofold origin, either from 
the interference of the vibrations in the outer ear, especially 
in the tympanum or chain of ossicles (Helmholtz’s combi-
-P-A-G-E-117
§ 9. Intensive Ideas. 99 
nation-tones), or from the interference of the vibrations in 
the auditory nerve-fibres (Koenig’s beat-tones). The first are, 
from the very character of their origin, weak tones; espe- 
cially in comparison with the original tones, they are always 
relatively very weak. The second class, on the other hand, 
are generally stronger and may even surpass the original 
tones in intensity. It is probable that the first appear only 
in the case of harmonious compound clangs, while the second 
appear also in dissonant compound clangs. The fusion of 
difference-tones with the chief tones of the compound is the 
more complete the less intense the former are, and the more 
they tend to form a simple harmonious tonal series with the 
original components of the clang.’ As a result of these attri- 
butes, the difference-tones are to compound clangs what the 
overtones are to single clangs. They are, however, almost 
entirely independent of the clang-color of the components of 
the compound, but vary greatly with the relation in which 
the principal tones of these components stand to one another. 
This explains the relative uniformity in the character of a 
given compound clang even when the clang-colors of its com- 
ponents vary. 
7. A compound clang may pass through all possible inter- 
mediate stages into a third form of intensive auditory ideas, 
that of noises. When two tones are no longer included 
within a series of harmonious tones and when at the same 
time the difference between the number of their vibrations 
does not exceed certain limits, for higher tones about sixty 
vibrations and for lower thirty or even fewer, there arise 
disturbances in the compound clang, which correspond in 
number to the difference between the number of vibrations 
in the primary tones, and are due to the alternating coinci- 
dence of like and opposite phases of vibration. These dis- 
turbances are either interruptions of the clang-sensation, 
7*

  100 II. Psychieal Compounds. 
beats, or, especially in the case of deep tones, intermittent 
sensations of a difference-tone, tonal beats. If the differences 
in the number of vibrations exceed the numbers mentioned, 
the tones at first sound continuous, for the interruptions 
disappear, but they are harsh. Later the harshness dis- 
appears and we have pure dissonance. Ordinary dissonance 
is made up of a mixture of beats or harshness and pure 
dissonance. The first two are due to perceptible or just 
disappearing interruptions of the sensation, the latter to the 
entire absence of the unity of the clang, that is, of the con- 
sonance that would have arisen if a complete or partial fusion 
had taken place.- This lack of accord in tones, due to the 
relation of their pure qualities, may be designated bisonance. 
If through the simultaneous sounding of a great number of 
non-accordant tones the various conditions for an ordinary 
dissonance, beats, tonal beats, harshness, and bisonance, are all 
added together, a motse is the result. On the psychological 
side this means that the predominating tonal elements disappear 
entirely or become mere modifying elements in the total idea. 
For our apprehension of noises, in the case of those which 
last a short interval only, the general pitch of the most in- 
tense elements is determinative, in the case of those which last 
longer, the form of the disturbance resulting from the rapidity 
of the beats, from the accompanying tonal beats, etc., also 
has an influence. 
Human articulations are characteristic examples of different 
forms of noise. The vowels are intermediate between clangs 
and noises with predominantly clang character; the resonants 
are noises of long duration, and the proper consonants noises 
of short duration. In whispers the vowels become simply 
noises. The circumstance that the differences in vowels are 
perfectly distinct in whispers, goes to prove that the character 
of vowels depends essentially on their noise-elements. It is
-P-A-G-E-119
  
§ 9. Intensive Ideas. 101 
probable that simple sensations of noise (p. 49) enter into 
all noises together with the numerous tonal elements that 
go to make them up. The irregular air-vibrations arising 
from the disturbances in the tonal waves, excite both the 
nervous elements in the vestibule of the labyrinth, which 
are sensitive to such stimulations, and the auditory nerve- 
fibres themselves. 
7a. Helmholtz’s resonance hypothesis has aided us materially 
in understanding the physiological substratum of intensive auditory 
ideas, especially those of clangs (p. 51). It is assumed that certain 
parts of the auditory organ are so tuned that tonal waves of a 
given rate always set in sympathetic vibration only the part 
correspondingly tuned. This explains in a general way the 
analyzing ability of the auditory sense, as a result of which we 
can distinguish the elements not only in a compound clang, but 
to some extent even in a single clang. The resonance hypothesis, 
however, accounts physiologically for only one side of tonal fusion, 
the persistence of the single sensation in the total intensive idea, 
not for the other side, the more or less intimate combination of 
the elements. The assumption of an imaginary “organ of fusion” 
in the brain for this purpose, is one of those fictions that are 
more harmful than helpful, in which the attempt is made to 
satisfy a demand for explanation with an empty word. The tonal 
elements that produce an intensive clang-idea persist as real 
sensations and still give up their independence more or less in 
the total idea. Tonal fusion is, then, a psychical process and 
requires a psychological explanation. But since this fusion is 
very different under different objective conditions, as, for example, 
when the impressions are due to the combined vibrations from a 
single source or to vibrations from several distinct sources; these 
differences must have some physiological and physical grounds 
for their explanation. The most natural way to attempt such an 
explanation is properly to supplement the resonance hypothesis. 
If we assume that besides the analyzing parts of the auditory 
organ, the resonant membrane, still others exist which are effected 
by the total, unresolved clang, we have a sufficient physiological 
substratum for the different effects of the various conditions. The  
-P-A-G-E-120
  102 IT. Psychical Compounds. 
observations (p. 41) on birds deprived of their labyrinths make 
it possible to infer that the auditory nerve-fibres in the canals 
of the labyrinth may be such organs. Then, too, the existence 
of beat-tones (p. 99), which sometimes surpass the primary tones in 
intensity, and the observation that the interruptions of a single 
tone may unite to form a second sensation when sufficiently 
rapid, both seem to require a similar supplementation of the 
resonance hypothesis. 
§ 10. SPACIAL IDEAS. 
1. Spacial and temporal ideas are immediately distinguished 
from intensive ideas by the fact that their parts are united, not 
in an arbitrarily variable, but in a definitely fixed order, so 
that when the order is thought of as changed the idea itself: 
changes. Ideas with such a fixed arrangement are called in 
general extensive ideas. 
Of the possible forms of extensive ideas, spacial ideas 
are distinguished by the fact that the fixed arrangement 
of the parts of a spacial compound holds only for the re- 
lation of the parts to one another, not for their relation to 
the ideating subject. This latter relation may be thought of 
as indefinitely varied. The objective independence of spacial 
compounds from the ideating subject is called the movability 
and torsibility of spacial compounds. The number of directions 
in which such movement and torsion may take place; is 
limited. They may all be reduced to three dimensions, in 
each of which it is possible to advance in two opposite 
directions. The number of directions in which the parts of 
a single compound may be arranged as well as the number 
in which various compounds may be arranged with reference 
to one another, is the same as the maximal number of 
directions in which movement and torsion are possible. This 
is what we call the three-dimensional character of space. A
-P-A-G-E-121
§ 10. Spacial Ideas. 103 
single spacial idea may, accordingly, be defined as a three- 
dimensional compound whose parts are fixed in their location 
with regard to one another, but capable of indefinite variation 
in their location with regard to the ideating subject. This 
definition neglects, of course, the frequent changes in the 
arrangement of the parts, which occur in reality. When these 
changes take place, they are to be regarded as transitions from 
one idea to another. This three-dimensional arrangement of 
spacial ideas must of necessity include one-dimensional and 
two-dimensional arrangements as special cases. In such cases, 
however, the wanting dimensions must always be added in 
thought as soon as the relation of the idea to the ideating 
subject is taken into account. 
2. This relation to the ideating subject, which is really 
present in all spacial ideas, renders it from the first psycho- 
logically impossible that the arrangement of the elements in 
such an idea should be an original attribute of the elements 
themselves, analagous to the intensity or quality of sensations; 
it requires rather that this arrangement should result from the 
bringing together of these elements, and should arise from 
some new psychical conditions that come with this coexistence. 
If this is not admitted, it becomes necessary not only to at- 
tribute a spacial quality to every single sensation, but also to 
postulate for every sensation, however limited, a simultaneous 
idea of the whole of three-dimensional space in its location 
with regard to the ideating subject. This would lead to the 
acceptance of an @ priori space-perception prior to all concrete 
sensations, which is not only contradictory to all our ex- 
periences as to the conditions for the rise and development of 
psychical compounds in general, but also contradictory to all 
our experiences as to the influences that affect spacial ideas 
in particular. 
3. All spacial ideas are arrangements either of tactwal
-P-A-G-E-122
104 II. Psychical Compounds. 
or of visual sensations. Indirectly, through of connection of 
other sensations with either tactual or visual ideas, the spa- 
cial relation may be carried over to other sensations. In the 
cases of touch and sight, it is obvious that the extended sur- 
face of the peripheral sense-organs, and their equipment with 
organs of movement, which render possible a varying location 
of the impressions in regard to the ideating subject, are both 
favorable conditions for an extensive, spacial arrangement of 
the sensations. The tactual sense is the earlier of the two 
here in question, for it appears earlier in the development 
of organisms and shows the structural relations in much 
coarser, but for that reason in many respects much plainer, 
form than the more delicately organized visual organ does. 
Still, it is to be noted that where vision is present, the 
spacial ideas from touch are greatly influenced by those 
from sight. 
A. SPACIAL TOUCH-IDEAS. 
4. The simplest possible touch-idea is a single, approxi- 
mately punctiform impression on the skin. If such an impres- 
sion is presented even when the eyes are turned away, there 
arises a definite idea of the place touched. Introspection shows 
that this idea, which is called the localixation of the stimulus, 
under the normal condition where vision is present is not im- 
mediate, as we we should expect it to be if the spacial quality 
were an original attribute of sensations, but that it depends 
upon a secondary, generally very obscure, wswal idea of the 
region touched. Localization is, therefore, more exact near 
bounding lines of the touch-organs than on the uniform 
intervening surfaves, since these bounding lines are more 
prominent in the visual images. The arousal of a visual idea 
through the tactual impression, even when the eyes are turned 
away, is possible because every point of the organ of touch
-P-A-G-E-123
  
§ 10. Spacial Ideas. 105 
gives to the touch-sensation a peculiar qualitative coloring, 
which is independent of the quality of the external impres- 
sion and is probably due to the character of the structure 
of the skin, which varies from point to point and is never 
exactly the same in two separate regions. 
This local coloring is called the local sign of the sensation. 
It varies in different regions of the skin at very different rates: 
rapidly on the tip of the tongue, on the ends of the fingers, and 
on the lips; slowly on the broader surfaces of the limbs and 
trunk. A measure for the rate of this variation may be ob- 
tained by applying ¢2vo impressions near each other to any region 
of the skin. So long as the distance of the impressions is less 
than that of distinguishable local signs they are perceived as a 
single one, but so soon as they pass this limit they are perceived 
as spacially separate. The smallest, just noticeable distance be- 
tween two impressions is called the space-threshold for touch. 
It varies from one or two millimetres (tips of tongue and 
fingers) to sixty-eight millimetres (back, upper arm, and leg). 
On the pressure-spots (p. 47), when the stimuli are favorably 
applied, still shorter distances can be perceived. Then, too, 
the threshold is dependent on the condition of the tactual 
organ and on practice. As a result of the first, for example, 
the threshold is smaller for children than for adults, since 
the differences in structure that condition the local signs, are 
obviously more crowded together. As a result of practice, 
the threshold is smaller in the case of the blind than of 
those who have vision, especially at the ends of the fingers, 
which are most used for touching. 
5. The influence of visual ideas of the regions touched, 
where vision is present, as just described, teaches that the 
localization of tactual impressions and the spacial arrange- 
ment of a number of such impressions is not due to an 
original spacial quality of cutaneous points or to any
-P-A-G-E-124
  106 II. Psychical Compounds. 
primary space-forming function of the tactual organ. On the 
contrary, it presupposes spacial ideas of sight, which can be 
made use of, however, only because the various parts of the 
tactual organ have certain qualitative attributes, local signs, 
which arouse the visual image of the part touched. There 
is no reason for attributing an immediate spacial relation to 
the local signs themselves; it is obviously enough that they 
act as qualitative signals to arouse the appropriate visual 
images. This connection with vision depends upon the frequent 
union of the two. The keenness of localization will, there- 
fore, be aided by all the influences that increase either the 
clearness of the visual images or the qualitative differences 
in local signs. 
We may describe the formation of spacial ideas in this 
case as the arrangement of tactual stimuli in visual images 
already present. The whole process is a consequence of the 
constant connection of these images with the qualitative local 
signs of the stimuli. The union of the local signs and the 
visual images of the corresponding region may, then, be 
regarded as an incomplete, but very constant, fusion. The 
fusion is incomplete because both visual image and tactual 
impression retain their independent character; but it is so 
constant that, when the state of the tactual organ remains 
the same, it seems invariable. This last fact explains the 
relative certainty of localization. The predominating elements 
of this fusion are the ‘actual sensations. For many persons 
the visual images are pushed so far into the background that 
they can not be perceived with any certainty, even with the 
greatest attention. The apprehension of space, in such cases, 
is perhaps an immediate function of tactual and motor sen- 
sations, as for the blind (v. inf. 6). As a rule, however, more 
careful observation shows that it is possible to recognize the 
position and distance of the impressions only by attempting 
 
-P-A-G-E-125
§ 10. Spacial Ideas. 107 
to make the indefinite visual image of the region touched 
more distinct. . 
6. The conditions that hold when vision is present, are 
essentially different from those found in cases of blindness, 
especially congenital or early acquired blindness. Blind per- 
sons retain for a long time memory images of familiar visual 
objects, so that the spacial ideas of touch always remain, to 
some extent, products of a fusion between tactual sensations 
and visual images. But these visual images can not be con- 
tinally renewed, so that the persons in question come more 
and more to make use of movements. The sensations of 
movement that arise from the joints and muscles in passing 
from one tactual impression to another (p. 46), serve as a 
measure for the movement executed and, at the same time, 
as a measure for the distance between the two impressions. 
These sensations of movement, which in acquired blindness 
are additions to the gradually fading visual images and 
in part substitutes for them, are, in congenital blindness, 
the only means present from the first for the formation 
of an idea of the relative position and distance of the 
single impressions. We observe in the latter case contin- 
ual movements of the touch-organs, especially the fingers, 
over the object. Added to these movements are a more 
concentrated attention to tactual sensations and a greater 
practice in their discrimination. Still, the low grade of devel- 
opment of this sense, in comparison with sight, always shows 
itself in the fact that the apprehension of continuous lines and 
surfaces is much less perfect than that of approximately 
punctiform impressions arranged in various ways. The neces- 
sity of making a blind-alphabet of arbitrary figures formed 
by various combinations of raised points. is a striking proof 
of this. Thus, for example, in the ordinary alphabet (Braille’s) 
one point represents A. two points in a horizontal line B,
-P-A-G-E-126
  108 II. Psychical Compounds. 
two points in a vertical line C, etc. With six points at 
most all the letters can be formed, but the points must be 
far enough apart to be perceived as separate with the 
end of the index finger. The way in which this alphabet is 
read is characteristic for the development of the space-ideas 
of the blind. As a rule the index fingers of both hands are 
used for this purpose. The right finger precedes and appre- 
hends a group of points simultaneously (synthetic touch), the 
left finger follows somewhat more slowly and apprehends the 
single points successively (analytic touch). Both the syn- 
thetic and analytic impressions are united and referred to the 
same object. This method of procedure shows clearly that 
the spacial discrimination of tactual impressions is no more 
immediately given in this case than in the case where vision 
was present, but that here the movements by means of which 
the finger that is used for analytic touch passes from point 
to point, play the same part as the accompanying visual ideas 
did in the normal cases with vision. 
An idea of the extent and direction of these movements 
can arise only under the condition that every movement is 
accompanied by an inner tactual sensation (p. 46, 6). The 
assumption that these inner tactual sensations are immedi- 
ately connected with an idea of the space passed through in 
the movement, would be highly improbable, for it would not 
only presuppose the existence of a connate perception of 
surrounding space and of the position of the subject in respect 
to the same (p. 103), but it would include another particular 
assumption. This is the assumption that inner and outer 
touch-sensations, although they are otherwise alike in quality 
and physiological substrata, still differ in that inner sen- 
sations give, along with the sensation, an image of the po- 
sition of the subject and of the spacial arrangement of the 
immediate environment. This would really necessitate a return
-P-A-G-E-127
  $10. Spacial Ideas. 109 
to the Platonic doctrine of the memory of innate ideas, for 
the sensations of movements arising from touch are here 
thought of as the mere external occasional causes for thie 
revival of innate transcendental ideas of space. 
7. Apart from its psychological improbability, such an 
hypothesis as that just mentioned can not be reconciled with 
the influence exercised by practice on the discrimination of 
local signs and of differences in movements. There is no 
other way except to attribute the rise of spacial ideas here. 
as in normal cases with vision (p. 106), to the combinations 
of the sensations themselves as presented in experience. These 
combinations consist in the fact that in passing from one 
outer tactual impression to another, any two sensations, a and 
6, with a certain difference in local signs, always have a 
corresponding inner touch-sensation, @, accompanying the 
movement; while two sensations, a and c, with a greater dif- 
ference in local signs, have a more intense sensation of move- 
ment, y. For the blind there is always such a regular com- 
bination of inner and outer touch-sensations. From the 
strictly empirical point of view it can not be affirmed that 
either of these sensational systems, in itself, brings the idea 
of spacial arrangement; we can only say that this arrange- 
ment results regularly from the combination of the two. On 
this basis the spacial ideas of the blind, arising, as they do. 
from external impressions, may be defined as a product of 
the fusion of external tactual sensations and their qualita- 
tively graded local signs, with internal tactual sensation 
graded according to intensity. The external sensations with 
their attributes as determined by the external stimulus. are 
the predominating elements in this fusion. These push the 
local signs with their qualitative peculiarities, and the sen- 
sations of movement with their intensive attributes, so far 
into the background, that. like the overtones of a clang, they
-P-A-G-E-128
  110 II. Psychical Compounds. 
can be: perceived only when the attention is especially con- 
centrated upon them. Spacial ideas from touch are, accord- 
ingly, due to a complete fusion. Their characteristic peculi- 
arity, in contrast, for example, with intensive tonal fusions, 
is that the subordinate and supplementary elements are dif- 
ferent in character, and at the same time related to one 
another according to definite laws. They are different, for 
the local signs form a pure qualitative system, while the inner 
touch-sensations which accompany the ‘movements of the tac- 
tual organs, form a series of intensities. They are related, 
for the motor energy used in passing through an interval 
between two points, increases with the extent of the interval, 
so that, in proportion to the qualitative difference between 
the local signs, there must also be an increase in the intensity 
of the sensations of movement. 
8. The spacial arrangement of tactual impressions is thus 
the product of a twofold fusion. First, the subordinate ele- 
ments fuse, in that the various qualities of the local sign 
system, which is spread out in two dimensions, are related 
to one another according to the grades of intensity of the 
sensations of movement. Secondly, the tactual impressions as 
determined by the external stimuli, fuse with the product of 
the first union. Of course, the two processes do not take 
place successively, but in one and the same act, for the local 
signs and movements must both be aroused by the external 
stimuli. Still, the external sensations vary with the nature 
of the objective stimulus, while the local signs and internal 
tactual sensations are subjective elements, whose mutual rela- 
tions always remain the same even when the external im- 
pressions vary. This is the psychological condition for the 
constancy of attributes which we ascribe to space itself, in 
contrast wich the great changeableness of the qualitative attri- 
butes of objects in space.
-P-A-G-E-129
$10. Spacial Ideas. 111 
9. After the fusion between local signs and internal tac- 
tual sensations has once been effected, either one of these 
elements by itself, though perhaps in a limited degree, is able 
to bring about a localization of the sensations, and even to 
arouse complex spacial ideas. In this way not only normal 
individuals with vision, but also the blind, even the congen- 
itally blind, have an idea of the place touched, and can per- 
ceive as spacially separate two impressions that are far enough 
apart, even when the touch-organs remain perfectly quiet. 
Of course, the congenitally blind can have no visual image 
of the region touched, but they have instead of this an idea 
of a movement of the part touched and, where several im- 
pressions are received, the idea of a movement from one to 
the other. The same fusion takes place in ideas thus formed 
as in the ordinary ones, where movements are really present, 
only here the one factor, the inner tactual sensation is 
merely a memory-image. 
10. In the same way, we may have the reverse process. 
The real contents of experience may be a sum of inner tac- 
tual sensations which arise from the movement of some part 
of the body, while no noticeable external tactual sensations 
whatever are given, and yet these internal sensations which 
accompany the movement may still be the basis of a spacial 
idea. This is regularly the case when we have pure ideas 
of our own movements. Tf, for example, we shut our eyes 
and then raise our arm, we have at every moment an idea 
of the position of the arm. To be sure, external tactual 
sensations that arise from the torsion and folding of the skin, 
play some part here too, but they are relatively unimportant 
in comparison with the internal sensations from the joints, 
tendons, and muscles. 
It can be easily observed that where vision is present, this 
idea of position comes from an obscure visual image of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-130
  
  112 II. Psychical Compounds. 
limb with its surroundings, which is aroused even when the 
eyes are closed or turned away. This connection is so close 
that it may arise between the mere memory-image of the inner 
tactual sensation and the corresponding visual idea, as is 
observed in the case of paralytics, where sometimes the mere 
will to execute a certain movement arouses the idea of a 
movement really executed. Evidently, the ideas of one’s own 
movements depend, when vision is present, on incomplete 
fusions, just as the external spacial ideas of touch do, only 
here the internal sensations play the part that the outer 
sensations play in the former case. This leads to the assump- 
tion that the inner tactual sensations also have local signs, 
that is, the sensations in the various joints, tendons, and mus- 
cles show certain series of local differences. Introspection 
seems to confirm this view. If we move alternately the 
knee-joint, hip-joint, and shoulder-joint, or even the correspond- 
ing joints on the right and left sides, the quality of the 
sensation seems each time a little different, even if we neglect 
the connection with a visual image of the limb, which can 
never be entirely suppressed. Then, too, it is impossible to 
see how accompanying visual images could arise at all with- 
out such differences. That would require not only a connate 
idea of space in the mind, but also a connate knowledge of 
the position and movements of the limbs in space for every 
moment. 
11. From the relations that exist in the normal cases with 
vision, we can understand the way in which the ideas of their 
own movements arise in the case of the congenitally blind. 
Here, instead of a fusion with a visual image. there must 
be a fusion of sensations of movement with the local signs. 
Outer tactual sensations also act as aids in this case. In 
fact. they are much more important here than when vision 
is present. The ideas of the blind as to their own move-
-P-A-G-E-131
  
$10. Spacial Ideas. 113 
ments are exceedingly uncertain so long as they are unaided 
by contact with external objects. When, however, they touch 
such objects, they have the advantage of greater practice 
with the external tactual sense and a keener attention for 
the same. The so-called “distance-sense of the blind” is 2 
proof of this. It consists in the ability to perceive from 
some distance, without direct contact, a resisting object, as, 
for example, a neighboring wall. Now, it can be experi- 
mentally demonstrated that this distance-sense is made up 
of two factors: a very weak tactual stimulation of the fore- 
head by the atmospheric resistance, and a change in the 
sound of the step. The latter acts as a signal to concentrate 
the attention enough so that the weak tactual stimulations 
can be perceived. The “distance-sense” disappears, accord- 
ingly, when the tactual stimulations are prevented by binding 
a cloth around the forehead or when the steps are rendered 
inaudible. 
12. Besides our ideas of the position and movements of 
the various parts of our body, we have also an idea of the 
position and movement of our whole body. The former can 
never have anything but a relative significance; it is only 
when considered in connection with the latter that they 
become absolute. The organ of orientation for this general 
idea is the head. We always have a definite idea of the 
position of the head; the other organs are localized in 
our ideas, generally, indeed, very indefinitely, with reference 
to it, according to the particular complexes of inner and 
outer tactual sensations in each case. The specific organ of 
orientation in the head is the system of semicircular canals, 
to which are added as secondary aids the inner and outer 
tactual sensations resulting from the action of the muscles 
of the head. The function of these canals as an organ of 
orientation can be most easily understood by assuming that

inner tactual sensations with especially marked differences in 
local signs, arise in them through the influence of the chang- 
ing pressure of the fluid medium, which fills them. It is 
highly probable that dixxiness, which comes from rapid 
rotation of the head, is due to the sensations caused by the 
violent movements of this fluid. This is in accord with the 
observations that partial derangements of the canals bring 
about constant illusions in localization, and complete de- 
rangement of the same is followed by an almost total sus- 
pension of the ability to localize. 
12a. The antagonistic theories in regard to the psychical 
formation of spacial ideas, are generally called nativism and 
empirism. The nativistic theory seeks to derive localization in 
space from connate properties of the sense-organs and sense- 
centres, while the empiristic theory seeks to derive it from the 
influences of experience. This discrimination does not give proper 
expression to the actual opposition that exists, for the assumption 
of connate spacial ideas may be attacked without affirming that 
these ideas arise through experience. This is the case when, as 
above, space-perceptions are regarded as products of psychical 
fusions due both to the physiological properties of the organs of 
sense and of movement, and to the general laws for the rise of 
psychical compounds. Such processes of fusion and the arrange- 
ments of sense-impressions based upon them, are everywhere 
the substrata of our experience, but for this very reason it is 
inadmissible to call them “experience” itself. It is much more 
proper to point out the opposition that really exists, as that of 
nativistie and genetic theories. It is to be noted that the wide- 
spread nativistic theories contain empirical elements, while, on the 
other hand, empirical theories contain nativistic elements, so that 
the difference is sometimes very small. Supporters of the nativ- 
istic view assume that the arrangement of impressions in space 
corresponds directly to the arrangement of sensitive points in the 
skin and retina. The special way in which the projection out- 
ward is effected, especially the ideas of the distance and magni- 
tude of objects, and the reference of a plurality of spacially
-P-A-G-E-133
  
§ 10. Spacial Ideas. 115 
separated impressions to a single object, are all regarded as 
dependent upon “attention”, “will”, or even “experience”. Sup- 
porters of the empirical theory, on the other hand, generally 
presuppose space as given in some way or other, and then in- 
terpret each single idea as a localization in this space due to 
some empirical motive. In the theory of spacial ideas from 
sight, tactual space is generally revarded as this originally given 
space; in the theory of tactual ideas, original spacial qualities 
have sometimes been attributed to motor sensations. Thus, in 
the actual concrete ‘‘.cories empirism and nativism are very 
ill defined concepts. They agree in the use of the complex con- 
cepts of popular psychology, such as “attention”, “will”, and 
“experience”, without any examination or analysis. In this respect 
they are different from the genetic theory, which seeks to show 
the elementary processes from which the ideas rise, by means 
of a psychological analysis of the ideas. In spite of their weak- 
nesses, the nativistic and empiristic theories have served to 
set the psychological problem that exists here, clearly before 
us, and to bring to light a great number of facts for its 
solution. 
B. SPACIAL SIGHT-IDEAS. 
13. The general properties of the touch-sense are repeated 
in the visual sense, but in a more highly organized form. 
Corresponding to the sensory surface of the outer skin, we 
have here the retina with its rods and cones arranged in 
rows and forming an extraordinarily fine mosaic of sensitive 
points. Corresponding to the movements of the tactual organs, 
we have the movements of both eyes in fixating objects and 
following their bounding lines. Still, while tactual impressions 
are perceived only through immediate contact with the objects, 
the refractive media in front of the retina throw inverted. 
reduced images upon it. These images are so small that 
space is allowed for a large number of simultaneous im- 
pressions, and the ability of light to traverse space makes it 
possible for both neighboring and distant objects to yield

impressions. Vision thus becomes a distance-sense in a much 
higher degree than hearing. Light can be perceived from 
incomparably greater distances than sound. Furthermore, 
only visual ideas are directly localized at different distances 
from the subject; for auditory ideas this localization is al- 
ways indirect, through the aid of visual ideas of space. 
14. With regard to its spacial attributes, every visual 
idea may be resolved into two factors: 1) the location of the 
single elements in relation to one another, and 2) their loca- 
tion in relation to the ideating subject. Even the idea of 
one single point of light, contains both these. factors, for we 
must always represent a point in some spacial environment, 
and also in some direction and at some distance from our- 
selves. These factors can be separated only through delib- 
erate abstraction, never in reality, for the relation of any 
point in space to its environment, regularly. determines its 
relation to the ideating subject. As a result of this depend- 
ence, the analysis of visual ideas may better start with the 
location of the elements in relation to one another, and then 
take up later the location of the compound in regard to the 
subject. 
a. The Location of the Elements of a Visual Idea in 
Relation to One Another. 
15. In the apprehension of the reciprocal relations 
between elements of a visual idea, the attributes of the 
tactual sense are all repeated, only in a much more highly 
organized form, and with a few modifications significant for 
the visual ideas. Here, too, we immediately connect with the 
simplest possible, approximately punctiform, impression the 
idea of its place in space; that is, we give it a certain defi- 
nite position in relation to the parts of space about it. This 
localization is not effected, however, as in touch, by the
-P-A-G-E-135
  
§$ 10. Spacial Ideas. 117 
direct reference of the impression to the corresponding point 
of the sense-organ itself, but we project it into a field of 
vision, which lies at some distance outside of the ideating 
subject. Here too we have a measure, as in the case of 
touch, for the accuracy of localization, in the distance at 
which two approximately punctiform impressions can be just 
distinguished as spacially different. The distance is not given 
in this case as a directly measurable linear extension on 
the sensory surface itself, but as the shortest perceptible 
interval between two points in the field of vision. The field 
of yision may be thought of as placed at any distance 
whatever from the subject, so that it is best to use as a 
measure for the fineness of localization, not a linear exten- 
sion, but an angle, the angle formed by the intersection of 
the lines passing through the nodal point of the eye, from 
the points in the field of vision to the corresponding retinal 
points. This angle of vision remains constant so long as the 
size of the retinal image is unchanged, while the distance 
between the points in the field of vision increases in pro- 
portion to their distance from the subject. If an equivalent 
linear distance is sought in place of the angle of vision, it 
can be found in the diameter of the retinal image. This 
may be reckoned directly from the angle and the distance of 
the retina from the nodal point of the eye. 
16. The measurements of the keenness of localixation with 
the eye, made according to this principle, show that there is 
a great difference for different parts of the field of vision, 
just as was found for different regions of the tactual organs 
(p. 105). Still, the distances that measure the smallest per- 
ceptible intervals here are all very much smaller. Then, 
again, there are many regions of finer discrimination scattered 
over the tactual organ, but only one region of finest discrim- 
ination in the field of vision. This is the middle, which  
-P-A-G-E-136
  118 IT, Psychical Compounds. 
corresponds to the centre of the retina. From this region 
towards the periphery the fineness of localization diminishes 
very rapidly. The whole field of vision or the whole retinal 
surface, is, accordingly, analogous to a single tactual region, 
as, for example, that of the index finger, except that it very 
much surpasses the latter in fineness of localization, especially 
at the centre, where two impressions at a distance corre- 
sponding to 60”—90" in the angle of vision, are just distin- 
guishable, while two degrees and a half toward the periphery, 
the smallest perceptible extension is 3’ 30", and at eight 
degrees it increases to 1°. 
In normal vision we turn the eye towards objects of which 
we wish to gain more accurate spacial ideas, in such « way 
that they lie in the middle of the field of vision, their images 
falling, accordingly, on the centre of the retina. We speak 
uf such objects as seen directly, of all others, which lie in 
the eccéntric parts of the field of vision, as seen indirectly. 
The centre of the region of direct vision is called the point 
of regard, or the fixation-point. The line that unites the 
centre of the retina with that of the field of vision is known 
as the kine of regard. 
If we reckon the distance on the retina that corresponds 
to the smallest angle of vision at which two points in the 
centre of the field of vision may be perceived as separate, 
it will be found to be .004 to .006mm. This distance is 
equal to the diameter of a retinal cone, and since the 
cones are so close together in the centre of the retina that 
they are in direct contact, it may be concluded with 
probability that two impressions must fall upon at least two 
different retinal elements if they are to be perceived as sep- 
arate in space: This view is supported by the fact that 
in the peripheral regions of the retina the rods and cones, 
which are the two forms of elements sensitive to light, are
-P-A-G-E-137
  
§ 10. Spacial Ideas. 119 
really separated by greater intervals. It may, then, be 
assumed that the keenness of vision, or the ability to distin- 
guish two distinct points in the field of vision, is directly de- 
pendent on the proximity of the retinal elements to one 
another, for two impressions can be distinguished as spacially 
different only when they act upon different elements. 
16a. Because of this interrelation between the keenness of 
vision and the arrangement of retinal elements, it has often been 
concluded that every such element has from the first the property 
of localizing any stimulus that acts upon it, in that position in 
space which corresponds to its own projection in the field of 
vision. In-this way the attempt has been made to reduce the 
property of the visual sense by virtue of which it represents 
its objects in an external field of vision at some distance from 
the subject, to a connate energy of the retinal elements or of 
their central connections in the visual centre in the brain. There 
are certain pathological disturbances of vision that seem at first 
sight to confirm this assumption. When some region of the 
retina is pushed out of plate as a result of inflammation under- 
neath, certain distortions in the images, the so-called metamor- 
phopsia, arise. The extent and direction of these distortions can 
be fully explained when it is assumed that the displaced retinal 
elements continue to localize their impressions as they did when 
in their normal positions. But it is obvious that these distor- 
tions of the images when, as in most cases, they appear as con- 
tinually changing phenomena during the gradual formation and 
disappearance of the excretion, furnish us with no more evidence 
for a connate energy of localization in the retina than does the 
readily observed fact that distorted images of objects are seen 
when one looks through prismatic glasses. If, on the other hand, 
a stationary condition is gradually reached, the metamorphopsia 
disappear, and that, too, not only in cases where it may be as- 
sumed that the retinal elements return to their original position, 
but even in those cases where such a return is entirely improb- 
able on account of the extent of the affection, In cases like 
the latter, the development of a new connection between the 
single retinal elements and their corresponding points in the field  
-P-A-G-E-138
  120 II. Psychical Compounds. 
of vision, must be assumed!), This conclusion is supported by 
observations made with normal eyes on the gradual adaptation to 
distorted images which are produced by external optical appli- 
ances. If a pair of prismatic glasses are worn before the eyes, 
marked and disturbing distortions of the images are the regular 
results. The straight bounding lines appear bent and the forms 
of the objects are thus distorted. These disturbances gradually 
disappear entirely if the glasses are worn some time. When the 
glasses are removed the distortions may appear in the opposite 
direction. All these phenomena can be understood if we pre- 
suppose that the spacial localizations of vision are not original, 
but acquired. 
17. Besides the retinal sensations there are other psychical 
elements that always take part in the reciprocal spacial 
arrangement of light-impressions. The physiological proper- 
ties of the eye point a priori to the sensations that accom- 
pany ocular movements, as such elements. These movements 
obviously play the same part in the estimation of distances 
in the field of vision as the tactual movements do in the 
estimation of tactual impressions. The grosser conditions of 
touch are, however, here reproduced in a much more delicate 
and hightly developed form. The eye can be turned in all 
directions about its centre of rotation, which is fixed in its 
relation to the head, by means of a most admirably arranged 
system of six muscles. It is thus well suited to following 
continuously the bounding lines of objects or to passing each 
1) A process analogous to this elimination of the metamophopsia 
is sometimes observed in binocular vision when the disturbances 
arising from squinting are gradually overcome. When the squinting 
begins, the two lines of regard no longer meet in the field of vision, 
so that double images of objects arise. These may gradually dis- 
appear, however, if the condition of the eyes remains perfectly 
stationary; a new set of relations is developed for the retinal ele- 
ments of the squinting eye.

$10. Spacial Ideas. 121 
time in the shortest line from a given fixation-point to another. 
The movements in the directions which correspond to the 
position of the objects most frequently and closely observed, 
namely, downward and inward movements, are favored above 
the others by the arrangement of the muscles. Furthermore, 
the movements of the two eyes are so adapted to one another 
through the synergy of their innervation, that normally the 
two lines of regard are always turned upon the same fixation- 
point. In this way a cooperation of the two eyes is made 
possible which not only permit a more perfect apprehension 
of the position of objects in relation to one another, but, more 
especially, furnishes the most essential means for the deter- 
mination of the spacial relation of objects to the subject 
(24 seq). 
18. The phenomena of vision teach that the idea of 
the relative distance of two points from each other is depend- 
ent on the motor energy of the eye employed in passing 
through this distance, just as the discrimination of two dis- 
tinct points in the field of vision depends on the arrangement 
of the retinal elements. The motor energy becomes a com- 
ponent of the idea through its connection with a sensation 
which can be perceived, especially in extensive movements 
and by comparing ocular movements in various directions. 
Thus, for example, the upward movement of the eyes is 
clearly accompanied by more intense sensations than the 
downward movements; and the same is true of outward 
movements of one eye as compared with its inward move- 
ments. 
The influence of sensations of movement on the locali- 
zation are most apparent in the cases of disturbance arising 
from partial paralysis of single ocular muscles. These disturb- 
ances correspond exactly to the changes in the amount 
of energy required to move the eye. The general principle  
-P-A-G-E-140
  122 II. Psychical Compounds. 
of such disorders is that the distance between two points 
seems greater when they lie in the direction of the more 
difficult movement. The more difficult movement has a 
correspondingly more intense motor sensation, which under 
normal conditions accompanies a more extensive movement. 
As a result, the distance passed through appears greater. 
Furthermore, the same illusion may appear for distances that 
lie in the same direction, but have not been actually passed 
through, for the standard found during a movement deter- 
mines the motor impulse in the eye even when it is not moved. 
19. Similar differences in the estimation of distances can 
be demonstrated for the normal eye. Although the ocular 
muscles are so arranged that their movements in various 
directions require about the same amount of exertion, still, 
this is not exactly so. The reasons are apparently closely 
connected with the adaptation of the eye to its functions. 
The neighboring objects of our immediate environment, on 
which the lines of regard must be converged, are the ones 
most often looked at. For this reason, the muscles of the 
eye have so adapted themselves that the movements for the 
convergence of the lines of regard are the easiest, particu- 
larly those directed downwards as compared with other pos- 
sible movements of convergence. This general facilitation 
of convergence has been acquired by the addition of special 
auxiliary and compensatory muscles (superior and inferior 
oblique) to the muscles that move the eye upwards and 
downwards (superior and inferior recti). As a result of the 
greater complexity of muscular activity thus necessary for 
the upward and downward movements of the eyes, the exer- 
tion is greater in these directions than towards the two sides, 
where only the internal and external recti act. The relative 
ease of downward movements of convergence shows itself 
partly in the differences in the intensity of sensations accom- 
 
-P-A-G-E-141
§ 10. Spactal Ideas. 123 
panying the movements, as already remarked (p. 121), and 
partly in the fact that downward convergence is involuntarily 
too great and upward too small. 
There are certain constant optical illusions depending on 
the direction of the object in the field of vision, which cor- 
respond to these differences in the motor mechanism. They 
are of two kinds: illusions of direction, and those of mag- 
nitude. 
Both eyes are subject to an illusion as to the direction 
of vertical lines in the field of vision. Such a line whose upper 
end is inclined 1°—3° outward, appears vertical, and one 
really vertical, seems inclined inward. Since the illusion is 
in opposite directions for the two eyes, it disappears in binoc- 
ular vision. It can obviously be explained by the fact just 
noted, that the downward movements of the eyes are con- 
nected with an involuntary increase, and the upward move- 
ments with a decrease, in the convergence. This deflection 
of the movement from the vertical is not noticed, but 
we refer it to the object as a deflection in the opposite 
direction. 
An equally regular dusion in magnitude appears when 
we compare distances extending in different directions in the 
field of vision. This, too, is very probably to be referred to 
the asymmetry in the arrangement of the muscles which 
arises from the adaptation of the eye to the ordinary posi- 
tion of objects in space. A vertical straight line is judged 
on the average '/, too long as compared with an equal hori- 
zontal line. A square, accordingly, appears as a rectangle 
whose base is shorter than its sides, and a square drawn 
by the eye is always too low. This illusion is explained 
when we remember that, as a result of the highly developed 
tendency to convergence, the muscular activity for upward and 
downward movements is much more complex than for inward
-P-A-G-E-142
  
124 IL. Psychical Compounds. 
and outward movements. The consequence is the same as 
in the case of partially paralyzed eyes, distances in the 
direction of the more difficult movement appear greater. 
19a. Besides this difference between vertical and horizontal 
distances, which is most noticeable because it is so large, there 
are less marked differences between upward and downward, as 
well as between outward and inward distances. The upper half 
of a vertical line is overestimated on the average by 1/;¢ of its 
length, and the outer half of a horizontal line by '/,). The first 
may be due to a slight asymmetry in the arrangement of the 
upper and lower muscles, or it may be due to the involuntary 
convergence of the lines of regard in downward movement, or, 
finally, to a combination of both influences. The effect of. con- 
vergence is due to the fact that it corresponds to an approach 
of the object, so that we are generally inclined to see the lower 
half of the line nearer. In accordance with certain conditions of 
association to be described later (§ 16, 9), when the angle of vision 
remains constant, whatever is judged as nearer is judged to be 
smaller, so that the lower half of a line seems shorter than the 
upper. This explanation by the perspective can not be applied 
to the greater illusion in the overestimation of vertical as com- 
pared with horizontal lines, for if it were applicable, the illusion 
would at most be about equal to that found in the comparison 
of the two halves of a vertical line, while in reality it is approx- 
imately three times as great. The fact that this greater illusion 
appears only when straight distances are compared, not in the 
case of objects bounded by curved lines, is also a proof against 
the explanation by perspective. A circle, for example, does not 
appear as an ellipse with a longer vertical axis, but as a real 
circle. The slight overestimation of the outer half of a hori- 
zontal line is also due most probably to the asymmetrical activ- 
ity of the muscles, which arises from the relative ease of con- 
vergence-movements. 
20. Added to these two illusions, which arise from the 
special structure of ocular muscles in their adaptation to the 
purposes of vision, there are certain other variable optical
-P-A-G-E-143
$ 10. Spacial Ideas. 125 
illusions that are due to certain attributes of all voluntary 
movements and have their analoga in the movements of the 
tactual organs. These illusions may also be divided into 
those of direction, and those of magnitude. The former follow 
the rule that acute angles are overestimated, obtuse under- 
estimated, and that the direction of the intersecting lines 
varies correspondingly. For the illusions of magnitude we have 
the rule, forced or interrupted movements require more exertion 
than free and continuous ones. Any straight line that neces- 
sitates fixation is, accordingly, overestimated in comparison 
with an open distance marked off by two points, and a 
straight line interrupted by several dividing lines is over- 
estimated in comparison with an uninterrupted line. 
The tactual analogon of the illusion in angles is the ten- 
dency to overestimate small articular movements and to 
underestimate large ones. This comes under the general 
principle that a relatively greater expenditure of energy is 
required for a short movement than for a more extensive 
one, because it is more difficult to begin a movement than 
to continue it after it is already started. The tactual phe- 
nomenon analogous to the overestimation of interrupted lines. 
is that a distance estimated by a movement of one of the 
limbs always seems shorter when it is passed through in a 
single continuous movement than it does when the movement 
is several times interrupted. Here, too, the sensation corre- 
sponds to the expenditure of energy, which is, of course, 
greater for an interrupted than for a continuous movement. 
The overestimation of interrupted lines by the eye, takes place, 
as we can easily understand, only so long as no motives 
arise from the way in which the division is made, to hinder 
the movement of the eye over the interrupted line. Such a 
hindrance is present, for example, when the line is inter- 
rupted only once. This one point of division makes fixation 
 
-P-A-G-E-144
  126 II. Psychical Compounds. 
necessary. If we compare such a line with a continuous 
one, we tend to estimate the first without any movement, 
with the point of division as a fixation-centre, while the sec- 
ond is apprehended by a movement of the eye. As a result 
the continuous line seems longer than the interrupted line. 
21. All these phenomena point to the immediate depend- 
ence of the apprehension of spacial directions and magnitudes 
on ocular movements. As further evidence pointing in the same 
direction, we have the negative fact that the arrangement of 
the retinal elements, especially their proximity to one another, 
normally has no influence on the ideas of direction and 
magnitude. This is most strikingly evident in the fact that 
the distance between two points appears the same whether 
observed in direct or indirect vision. Two points that are 
clearly distinguished in direct vision, may become one in the 
eccentric parts of the field of vision, but so soon as they 
are distinguished at all, they will appear just as far apart in 
one region as in the other. This independence of the prox- 
imity of the retinal elements, in our perception of magnitude, 
holds even for a part of the retina that is not sensitive to 
light at all — for the blind spot, where the optic nerve comes 
into the eye. Objects whose images fall on the blind spot 
are not seen. The size of this spot is about 6°, and it is 
located 15° inward from the point of fixation. Images of 
considerable size, as, for example, that of a human face at a 
distance of six feet, may disappear entirely on it. Still, 
when points appear at the right and left or below and above 
this region, we localize them just as far from each other as 
we should in any other, uninterrupted part of the field of 
vision, The same fact is observed when some part of the 
retina becomes blind through pathological conditions. The 
resulting break in the field of vision shows itself only 
in the fact that images falling on it are not seen, never
-P-A-G-E-145
  $10. Spacial Ideas. 127 
through any changes in the localization of objects lying on 
opposite sides of the blind region.') : 
22. All these phenomena teach that the heenness of vision 
and the apprehension of directions and distances in the field of 
vision, are two different functions, which depend upon different 
conditions: the first depends on the proximity of the retinal ele- 
ments to one another, the second on ocular movements. It follows 
directly that spacial ideas from sight can not be regarded 
as original and given immediately in the action of impressions 
of light with their spacial arrangement, any more than can 
the spacial ideas of touch. The spacial order is, here too, 
developed from the combination of certain sensational com- 
ponents which, taken separately, have no spacial attributes 
whatever. Other conditions also indicate that the sensational 
elements are related here in the same way as in the case of 
touch, and that the development of visual space under normal 
conditions runs entirely parallel to the development of space 
in congenital blindness, the only condition under which touch 
attains a similar independence. Retinal impressions corre- 
spond to impressions of contact, and ocular movements to 
touch-movements. Tactual impressions can gain spacial 
qualities only through the local coloring of the sensations 
connected with them — the local signs — and in like man- 
ner, we must presuppose the same for retinal impressions. 
22a. To be sure, a qualitative gradation of local signs on 
1) In this connection, we have the fact that the blind spot does 
not appear as a break in the field of vision, without sensational con- 
tents, but as a continuation of the general brightness and color of the 
whole field; for example, as white when we are looking at a. white 
surface, as black when we look at a black one. This filling out of 
the blind spot is possible only through reproduced sensations, and 
is to be considered as one of the phenomena of association to be 
discussed later (§ 16). 
 
-P-A-G-E-146
  128 II. Psychical Compounds. 
the retina can not be demonstrated with the same evidentness as 
for the skin. Still, by the use of colors it can be established in 
general that for greater distances from the retinal centre the sensa- 
tional quality gradually changes. The colors are not so saturated 
in indirect vision, and the color-tone also changes; for example, 
yellow appears orange. There is, indeed, in these properties of 
the retina no strict proof for the existence of pure local differ- 
ences in the sensations, at least not in the fine gradations that 
must be assumed in the retinal centre, for example. Still, they 
show that local differences in sensations do exist, and this seems 
to justify the assumption of such even beyond the limits of dem- 
onstration. This is all the more justifiable because here, where 
the gradations are much finer, the tendency to translate sen- 
sational differences directly into local differences, which has already 
been noticed in the case of touch, will be much more apt. to 
destroy their specifically qualitative character. As a confirmation 
of this view we have the fact that the clearly demonstrable sen- 
sational differences at greater distances from the retinal centre, 
can be observed only under the favorable conditions of limited 
impressions, and disappears entirely when surfaces of uniform 
color are looked at. This disappearance of qualitative differences 
which are in themselves considerable, must be attributed in part 
at least to their relation to local differences. When, however, 
such relatively great differences disappear as a result of this 
relation, so that special methods are required for their demon- 
stration, it can not be expected that very small differences will 
be demonstrable at all. 
23. We assume, accordingly, qualitative local signs, which, 
judging from the data derived from the keenness of vision, 
are graded in the finest stages at the retinal centre and 
more slowly in the eccentric parts. The formation of visual 
space may then be described as a combination of this system 
of local signs arranged in two dimensions, with a system of 
intensive sensations of movement. For any two local signs a 
and 6 there will be a corresponding sensation of movement

serving as a measure of the same. A longer distance a ¢ 
will have a more intense sensation of moyement, y. Just as 
the point of finest discrimination on the finger is the centre 
of reference, so in the same way the retinal centre is such 
a point of reference for the eye. In fact, this is from the 
laws of ocwar movements more obvious for the eye than it 
is for the tactual organ. Any luminous point in the field 
of vision is a stimulus for the centre of ocular innervatton, 
and tends to turn the line of regard reflexly upon itself. This 
reflex relation of eccentric stimuli to the retinal centre is 
probably an essential condition for the development of the 
synergy of ocular movements mentioned above, and is, at the 
same time, an explanation of the great difficulty of observ- 
ing objects in indirect vision. This difficulty is evidently 
due to the greater reflex impulse toward a point in indirect 
vision when the attention is concentrated upon it, than toward 
less favored points. As a result of the preeminent impor- 
tance which the retinal centre has for ocular movements, the 
point of fixation necessarily becomes the centre of reference 
in the field of vision, and all distances in this field are 
brought under a unitary standard by being determined with 
reference to the fixation-point. The excitation of local sigr 
is due to the action of external impressions, and both to- 
gether cause the movement towards the retinal centre. The 
whole process of visual space-arrangement is thus due to the 
fusion of three different sensational elements: first, the sen- 
sational qualities depending upon the character of the exter- 
nal stimulus, second the qualitative local signs depending 
on the places where the stimuli act, and third, the inten- 
sive motor sensations determined by the relation of the 
stimulated points to the centre of the retina. The latter 
elements may either accompany actual movements — this 
is the original case — or, when the eye remains at rest, are

  130 II. Psychical Compounds. 
mere motor impulses of a particular intensity. Because of 
the regular connection between qualitative local signs and 
intensive sensations of movement, they may both together be 
regarded as a single system of complex local signs. The 
spacial localization of a simple visual impression, is a pro- 
duct of a complete fusion of the sensation caused by the 
external stimulus with the two interconnected elements be- 
longing to this system of complex local signs. The arrange- 
ment of a number of simple impressions in space consists 
in the combination of a great number of such fusions, which 
are graded in quality and intensity according to the elements 
of the system of local signs. The predominating elements 
in these fusions are the sensations due to the external stimu- 
lation. In comparison with these, the elements of the system 
of local signs are so obscure, even in their original qual- 
ity and intensity, that for the immediate apprehension of 
objects they are entirely lost except as spacial qualities. 
Connected with this complex process of fusion, which 
determines the order of the elements in the field of vision, 
is still another. This latter process, which takes place in 
the formation of every spacial idea, arises from the relation 
of the object seen to the subject. We pass now to the 
consideration of this second process. 
b. The Location of Visual Ideas in Relation to the 
Ideating Subject. 
24. The simplest case of a relation between an impres- 
sion and the subject, that can appear in a visual idea, is 
evidently that in which the impression is reduced to a single 
point. If a single point of light is presented in the field of 
vision, both lines of regard are turned upon it as a result 
of the reflex impulse exerted by the stimulus (p. 129), in such
-P-A-G-E-149
§ 10. Spacial Ideas. 131 
a way that in both eyes the images fall upon the retinal 
centres. At the same time the organs of accommodation are 
adapted to the distance of the point. The point thus repre- 
sented on the centres of both retinas is seen as single and 
as situated in a certain particular direction and at a certain 
particular distance from the ideating subject. 
The subject is represented, as a rule, by a point that 
may be defined as the middle point of the straight line 
connecting the centres of rotation of the two eyes. We will 
call this the point of orientation for the field of vision, and 
the straight line drawn from it to the intersection of the 
two lines of regard, that is to the external fixation-point, the 
line of orientation. When a point in space is fixated, there 
is always a fairly exact idea of the direction of the line of 
orientation. This idea is produced by the inner tactual sen- 
sations connected with the position of the two eyes. Such 
sensations are very noticeable because of their intensity, 
when the eyes are rotated much out of the central position. 
They are just as perceptible for a single eye, so that locali- 
zation in direction is as perfect in monocular as in binocular 
vision. In the former case, however, the line of orientation 
generally coincides with the line of regard), 
25. The idea of the distance of the objects from the 
subject, or of the absolute length of the line of orientation, 
is much more indefinite than that of its direction. We are 
always inclined to ideate this distance shorter than it 
really is, as may be shown by comparing it with a standard 
1) The habit of seeing with two eyes results in exceptions to 
this rule. Often when one eye is closed, the line of orientation re- 
mains the same as in binocular vision and does not coincide with the 
line of regard. In such cases the closed eye usually makes the cor- 
responding movements of convergence upon « common fixation-point 
with the open eye. 
oF  
-P-A-G-E-150
  132 II. Psychical Compounds. 
placed somewhere in the field of vision perpendicular to the 
line of orientation. In this way we find that the distance 
on the standard judged to be equal to the line of orientation, 
is always much shorter than the real length of this line. The 
difference between the two increases the further away the point 
of fixation moves, that is, the longer the line of orientation 
becomes. The only sensational components that can produce 
this idea of distance, are those inner tactual sensations con- 
nected with the position of the two eyes, that arise partic- 
ularly from the convergence of the lines of regard and give 
somewhat of a measure for the absolute extent of this con- 
vergence. In fact, it is possible to observe sensations when 
the convergence is changed; mainly from the inner angle 
of the eye when the degree of convergence is increased, from 
the outer, when it is decreased. The sum of all the sen- 
sations corresponding to a given position of convergence 
distinguishes it completely from all other positions. 
26. It follows that an idea of a definite, absolute length 
of the line of orientation can be developed only through 
the influences of experience, where in addition to the sen- 
sational elements a great many associations also have a part. 
This explains why these ideas always remain indefinite and 
why they are sometimes aided, sometimes interfered with by 
other components of visual ideas, especially by the size of the 
retinal images of familiar objects. On the other hand, we 
have a relatively fine measure in the sensations of convergence 
for differences in the distances of objects seen, that is, for 
the relative changes which the length of the line of orien- 
tation undergoes when the fixation-point approaches or recedes. 
For positions in which the lines of regard are nearly parallel, 
changes in convergence may be perceived that correspond 
to un angle of vision of 60” or 70”. When the convergence 
increases, this least perceptible change in convergence also
-P-A-G-E-151
  
§ 10. Spacial Ideas. 133 
increases considerably, but, in spite of that, the corresponding 
differences in the length of the line of orientation become 
smaller and smaller. Thus the purely intensive sensations 
which accompany movements of convergence, are translated 
directly into ideas of changes in the distance between the 
fixation-point and the point of orientation of the subject. 
This translation of a certain particular sensational com- 
plex into an idea of distance, is not due to any connate 
energy, but to a particular psychical development, as is 
shown by a great number of experiences which point to such 
a development. Among these is the fact that the apprehen- 
sion both of absolute distances and of differences in distance, 
is greatly improved by practice. Children are generally 
inclined to localize very distant objects in the immediate 
neighborhood: they grasp at the moon, at the slater on the 
tower, etc. In the same way, it has been observed that the 
congenitally blind are, immediately after an operation, entirely 
unable to distinguish near and far. 
27. It is of importance for the development of this dis- 
crimination between far and near, that under the natural 
conditions of vision not mere isolated points are presented, 
but extended three-dimensional objects, or at least a number 
of points at different depths, to which we assign relatively 
different distances along their respective lines of orientation. 
Let us consider first the simplest case, where two points 
a and b are presented, lying at different depths and connected 
by a straight line. A change in the fixation from a to b 
is always accompanied by a change in convergence, and 
brings about, first, the passage through a continuous serics 
of retinal local signs corresponding to the line ab, and, 
secondly, a sensation of movement, a, corresponding to the 
difference in convergence between these two points. This 
gives us here, too, the elements of a spacial fusion. The 
 
-P-A-G-E-152
    
134 II, Psychical Compounds. 
product of this fusion is, however, peculiar in kind; it differs 
in both its components, in the successive series of local signs 
and in the concomitant sensations of movement, from the 
fusions that arise when a line in the field of vision is passed 
over (p. 128). In the latter case the changes in local signs 
and sensations of movement are alike for both eyes, while 
in changing the point of fixation from far to near or the 
reverse they are opposite in the two eyes. For when the 
convergence gives the right eye a rotation towards the left, 
it will produce a rotation towards the right in the left eye, 
and vice versa. The same must also hold for the movement 
of the retinal images: when the image of the point as it 
leaves the point of fixation, moves towards the right in the 
right eye, it moves towards the left in the left eye, and vice 
versa. The first takes place when the eyes turn from a 
nearer to a more distant point, the latter, when they move in 
the opposite direction. Such fusions arising from movements 
of convergence have, so far as their qualitative and intensive 
components are concerned, a composition analagous to that 
on which the arrangement of the elements in the field of 
vision with regard to one another depends; but the special 
way in which these elements are united is entirely different 
in the two cases. 
25. Thus, the fusions between local signs and sensations 
of convergence form a system of complex local signs which is 
analogous to that deduced above (p. 130), but still peculiar 
in its composition. This system, differing in composition from 
the system of local signs in the field of vision, is supple- 
mentary to the latter in that it adds to the reciprocal rela- 
tion between the objective elements a relation between the 
ideating subject and these elements. The relation to the 
subject divides into two ideational elements, characterized 
by peculiar sensational elements: the idea of direction and
-P-A-G-E-153
  
§ 10. Spacial Ideas. 135 
that of distance. Both refer primarily to the -point of orien- 
tation in the head of the ideating subject, and are then 
secondarily applied to the relations of external objects in 
regard to one another. Thus, we come to assign to two points 
which lie at different distances along the line of orientation 
a direction and distance in relation to each other. All such 
ideas of spacial distance referring to various positions along 
the line of orientation, when taken together, are called zdeas of 
depth, or when they are also ideas of particular single objects 
ideas of three dimensions. 
29. An idea of depth arising in the way described varies 
according to objective and subjective conditions. The deter- 
mination of the absolute distance of an isolated point in the 
field of vision, is always very uncertain. Even the deter- 
mination of the relative distance between two points a and / 
lying at different depths is generally certain only under the 
condition assumed above, that they are connected by a line 
along which the points of fixation for the two eyes can move 
in changing the convergence from a to b. We may call 
such lines which connect different points in space with one 
another lines of fixation. The principle may then be for- 
mulated: points in space are apprehended in their true rela- 
tions only when they are connected by lines of fixation, along 
which the point of fixation may move. This principle is ex- 
plicable on the ground that the condition of a regularly 
connected change in the local signs of the retina and in 
the accompanying sensations of convergence, that is, the 
condition for the rise of ideas of depth as we found before 
(p. 133), is obviously fulfilled only when impressions are pre- 
sented which can arouse the appropriate local signs. 
30. When the condition mentioned is not fulfilled, there 
arises either an imperfect and indefinite idea of the different 
relative distances of the two points from the subject, or else  
-P-A-G-E-154
    
136 II. Psychical Compounds. 
the two points seem to the equally distant — a phenomenon 
which can appear only when one of the points is rigidly 
fixated. Under the latter condition still another change al- 
ways arises in the idea; only the fixated point is seen as 
single, the other is double. The same thing happens in 
looking at extended objects when they are not connected 
with the binocular fixation-point by means of lines of fixa- 
tion. Double images that arise in this way are wuncrossed — 
z. e., the right belongs to the right eye, the left to the left 
eye — when the fixated point is nearer than the observed 
object, and crossed when the point is beyond the object. 
Binocular localization in depth and binocular double 
images are, accordingly, phenomena directly interrelated; 
where the former is indefinite and imperfect, we have double 
images, and where, on the other hand, the latter are absent, 
the localization in depth is definite and exact. The two 
phenomena stand in such a relation to the line of fixation 
that, when it is present, localization is aided and double 
images removed. Still, this rule is not without exception, 
for when a point is rigidly fixated with both eyes, double 
images arise easily in spite of any lines of fixation that may 
be present. This is explained by the general necessary con- 
ditions for ideas of depth as mentioned above (p. 133). Just 
as the absence of lines of fixation results in the lack of the 
required succession of the local signs, so in a similar man- 
ner the sensations of convergence connected with movement, 
are absent in rigid fixation. 
c. Relations between the Location of the Elements in Regard 
to one another and their Location in Regard to the Subject. 
31. When the field of vision is thought of as merely a 
location of visual impressions in relation to one another, we 
represent it to ourselves as a surface, and call the single ob- 
 
-P-A-G-E-155
  § 10. Spacial Ideas. 137 
jects lying in this surface édeas of to dimensions, in con- 
trast to the ideas of depth. But even an idea of two 
dimensions must always be related to the seeing subject in 
two ways. First, every point in the field of vision is seen 
in a particular direction on the subjective -line of orien- 
tation mentioned above (p. 131). Secondly, the whole field 
of vision is localized at some distance or other from the 
subject, though this distance may be very indefinite. 
The location in a particular direction results in an erect 
ideational object corresponding to an inverted retinal image. 
This relation between the objective localization in direction and 
the retinal image is as necessary a result of ocular movements 
as the inversion of the image itself is a result of the op- 
tical properties of the eye. Our line of orientation in space 
is the external line of regard or, for binocular vision, the 
middle line resulting from the combined effects of movements 
of fixation. A direction upward on this line of orientation 
in external space corresponds to a direction downward in 
the space where the retinal image lies, behind the centre of 
ocular rotation, and vice versa. It follows that the retinal 
image must be inverted if we are to see the object erect. 
32. The location at some distance or other, which is also 
never absent, brings about the result that all the points of 
the field of vision seem to be arranged on the surface of a 
concave hemisphere whose centre is the point of orientation, 
or, in monocular vision, the point of the eye's rotation. Now, 
small areas of a large curved surface appear plane, so that the 
two-dimensional ideas of single objects are as a rule plane; 
thus, for example, figures drawn upon a plane, as those of 
plane geometry. But as soon as some parts of the general 
field of vision separate from it in such a way that they are 
localized before or behind, that is in different planes, the idea 
of two dimensions gives place to one of three.
-P-A-G-E-156
  138 II. Psychical Compounds. 
32a. The fusions formed between qualitative local signs and 
sensations of convergence when we change from the fixation of 
a more distant point to a nearer, or the reverse, may be called 
complex local signs of depth. Such local signs form for every 
series of points lying before or behind the fixation-point, or for 
an extended body which is nothing but a series of such points, 
a regularly arranged system in which a stereometric form located 
at a particular distance is always unequivocally represented by 
a particular fusion. When one of two points lying at different 
distances is fixated, the other is characterized by the different 
position of its images in the two eyes, and by the correspondingly 
different direction of the complex local signs in the two cases. 
The same is true for connected series of points or extended 
bodies. When we look at a solid object, it throws images in the 
two eyes that are different from each other on account of the 
different relative position of the object with regard to the two 
eyes. We may designate the difference between the positions of 
a certain point in the image in the two eyes as the binocular 
parallax. This parallax is zero for the point fixated and for those 
points which are equally distant on the line of orientation; for 
all other points it has some real positive or negative value ac- 
cording as they are more or less distant than the fixation-point. 
If we fixate solid objects with both eyes, only the point fixated, 
together with those points which are equidistant and in its neigh- 
borhood in the field of vision, will give rise to images corresponding 
in position in the two eyes. All points of the object located 
at different distances, give images varying in position and size. 
These differences in the images are just what produce the idea 
of the solidity of the object when the proper lines of fixation 
are present. For in the way above described, the angle of binoc- 
ular parallax for the image of any point lying before or behind 
the point of fixation and connected with the same by a line of 
tixation, furnishes, according to its direction and magnitude, a 
measure for the relative distance of this point in depth through 
the complex local signs connected with the angle of parallax. 
This angle of parallax for a given objective depth, decreases 
proportionally to the distance of the solid object, so that the im- 
pression of solidity diminishes, the further off the objects are, 
and when the distance is so great that all angles of parallax 
 
-P-A-G-E-157
  
$10. Spacial Ideas. 139 
disappear, the body will appear flat, unless the associations to be 
discussed later (§ 16, 9) produce an idea of depth. 
33. The influence of binocular vision on the idea ot 
depth may be investigated experimentally by means of a stereos- 
cope. This instrument consists of two prisms with their angles 
of refraction turned toward each other in such a way that 
it renders possible a binocular combination of two plain 
drawings which correspond to the retinal images from a three- 
dimensional object. The influence of the various conditions 
that underlie the formation of ideas of depths, may, in this 
way, be studied much better than by looking at actual three- 
dimensional objects, for here we may vary the conditions at will. 
To give a concrete illustration, it is observed that complex 
stereoscopic pictures generally require several movements of 
convergence back and forth before a clear plastic idea arises. 
Furthermore, the effect of the parallax appears in looking 
at stereoscopic pictures whose parts are movable in respect 
to each other. Such movements are accompanied by changes 
in the relief which answer exactly to the corresponding 
changes in binocular parallax. This parallax is dependent 
on the distance of the two eyes from each other, so that 
ideas of depth can be produced even in the case of objects 
too distant in reality to give a plastic effect, by combinny 
in the stereoscope pictures taken from positions much fur- 
ther apart than the two eyes are. This is done, for example, 
in making stereoscopic photographs of landscapes. The result 
is that these photographs when combined do not look like 
real landscapes, but like plastic models regarded from + 
short distance. 
34. In monocular vision all the conditions are absenm 
which are connected with movements of convergence, and wit): 
binocular differences in the retinal images, and which may be

artificially reproduced with the stereoscope. Still, not all the 
influences are wanting even here to produce a localization in 
the third dimension, although this localization is more imperfect. 
The direct influence of movements of accommodation have 
in comparison with other conditions a relatively small, per- 
haps entirely insignificant influence. Still, like movements 
of convergence, they too are accompanied by sensations which 
can be clearly perceived in the case of greater changes of 
accommodation from distant to neighboring points. For 
smaller changes in depth these sensations are very uncertain. 
As a result the movement of a point in the direction of the 
line of regard, when it is looked at with only one eye, is 
generally not clearly observed until a change in the size of 
the retinal image appears. 
35. For the development of monocular ideas of depth 
the influences which the components of the so-called per- 
spective exercise, are of the greatest importance. These are 
the relative magnitude of the angle of vision, the trend of 
huuting lines, the direction of shadows, the change in colors 
due to atmospheric absorption, ete. All these influences, 
which act in exactly the same way in monocular and binoc- 
ular vision, depend on associations of ideas, and will, there- 
fore, be treated in a later chapter (§ 16). 
35a. We have in general the same opposing theories for 
the explanation of visual ideas as for tactual ideas (p. 114). The 
empirical theory has sometimes committed the fallacy of limiting 
itself to optics and turning the real problem of space perception 
over to touch. In such cases it has tried to explain only how 
a localization of visual ideas can take place with the aid of ex- 
perience, on the basis of already existing spacial ideas from touch. 
uch an interpretation is, however, not only self-contradictory, but 
it also conflicts with experience, which shows that in normal per- 
sons with vision, visual space-perception determines tactual, not 
the reverse (p. 104°. The fact of general development, that touch

§ 10. Spacial Ideas. 141 
is the more primitive sense, can not be applied to the develop- 
ment of the individual. The chief evidences in support of nativ- 
istic theories are, first, the metamorphopsia after dislocation of 
retinal elements (p. 119) and, secondly, the position of the line of 
orientation (p. 131), which indicates united functioning of the two 
eyes from the first. It has been noted already (p. 120) that the 
metamorphopsia and other related phenomena prove the exact 
opposite as soon as the changes to which they are due become 
stationary. Furthermore, the fact that in long continued use of 
only one eye the line of orientation comes to coincide with the 
line of regard (p. 131), proves that the position of this line is 
not given from the first, but that it has arisen under the influ- 
ence of the conditions of vision. Still another fact against the 
nativistic and in favor of the genetic theory is the development 
in the child of the synergy of ocular movements under the influ- 
ence of external stimuli and the organization of space-perceptions 
which apparently accompanies it. Here as in many other respects 
the development of most animals is different. In the latter vases 
the reflex connections of retinal impressions with movements of the 
eyes and head function perfectly immediately after birth. (v. inf. 
§ 19, 2). The genetic theory has gained the ascendency over older 
nativistic and empirical views primarily through the more thorough 
investigation of the phenomena of binocular vision. Nativism 
has difficulty with the question why we generally see objects 
single although they produce images in each of the two eyes 
The effort is made to avoid the difficulty by assuming that tw: 
identical retinal points are connected with the same optic fibr: 
which divides in the chiasma, and that in this way the) repre- 
sent in the sensorium only a single point. This doctrine of the 
“identity of the two retinas” was, however, untenable as svon ats 
the actual conditions of binocular vision in three dimensions be 
gan to be investigated. Especially the invention of the sfereo- 
scope thus brought with it a new era for the +senetic theory of 
vision.

§ 11. TEMPORAL IDEAS. 
1. All our ideas are at once spacial and temporal. Just 
as the conditions for the spacial arrangement of impressions 
belong originally only to the tactual and visual senses, and 
just as spacial relations are only secondarily carried over 
from these to all other sensations, so there are only two 
kinds of sensations, namely, the inner tactual sensations from 
movements and the auditory sensations, which are the primary 
sources of temporal ideas. Still, there is a characteristic 
difference between spacial and temporal ideas in the fact that 
in the first the two senses mentioned are the only ones which 
can develop an independent spacial order, while in the sec- 
ond the two most important kinds of sensation are merely 
those in which the conditions are most favorable for the 
rise of temporal ideas. These conditions are not entirely 
wanting, however, for any sensations. This indicates that 
the psychological bases of temporal ideas are more general, 
und that they are not determined by the special structures 
of particular sense-organs. It follows from this fact that 
even when we abstract from the ideas that enter into any 
series of psychical processes, and take account only of the 
subjective phenomena accompanying the ideas, such as feel- 
ings and emotions, we still ascribe to the affective processes 
thus isolated through abstraction exactly the same temporal 
attributes as to the ideas. In philosophy the conclusion has 
zeuerally been drawn from this fact that time is a “universal 
torm of perception”, that is, there is absolutely no psychical 
covtent that does not have a position in time, though such 
vontent may exist without spacial attributes. This conclusion 
that time-perception is more universal, arising, as it does, from 
the greater universality of the conditions of such perception, is 
erroneous and is not confirmed by psychological observation.
-P-A-G-E-161
  § 11. Temporal Ideas. 143 
In the same way that we carry over spacial attributes from 
the two senses that give us space-perception to other kinds 
of sensations, we also give them secondarily to feelings and 
affective processes through the sensations and ideas insepa- 
rably connected with them. It may with equal right be 
doubted whether atfective processes in themselves, without 
their related ideas, would have temporal attributes, for among 
the conditions of a temporal order are certain attributes of 
the sensational elements of ideas. The real facts in the case 
are that our ideas and, therefore, since ideas enter into 
every psychical experience, all psychical contents are at once 
spacial and temporal. The spacial order arises from certain 
particular sensational elements: in normal cases where vision 
is present from visual, in blindness, from tactual impressions 
while time-ideas can arise from all possible sensations. 
2. Temporal compounds like spacial and in contrast to 
intensive ideas, are characterized by the definite, unchange- 
able order of their component elements. If this order is 
changed, the given compound becomes another, even though 
the quality of its components remains the same. In spacial 
compounds, however, this unchangeableness of the order refe~ 
only to the relation of the elements to one another. not to 
the relation of the elements to the ideating subject. ln 
temporal compounds, on the other hand, when the reiation 
of one element is changed with regard to other elements. it 
is at the same time changed with regard to the ideating sub- 
ject. There is no change of position in time analogous to 
that possible in the case of space-compounds. 
2a, This property of the absolute, strictly speaking unchange- 
able, relation of every temporal compound and every time-«le- 
ment, however short, to the ideating subject, is what we cali 
the flow of time. Every moment in time filled by any con- 
tent whatever has, on acount of this flow, such a relation to 
 
-P-A-G-E-162
  144 II. Psychical Compounds. 
the ideating subject that no other moment can be substituted 
for it. With space the case is just reversed: the very possibil- 
ity of substituting any spacial element in its relation to the 
subject for any other element whatever, is what gives rise to 
the idea of constance, or absolute duration, as we express it, by 
applying a time-idea to a space-idea. The idea of absolute dura- 
tion, that is of time in which no change takes place, is strictly 
speaking impossible in time-perception itself. The relation to 
the subject must change continually. We speak of an impres- 
sion as lasting, when its single periods in time are exactly alike 
so far as their sensational contents are concerned, so that they 
differ only in their relation to the subject. The concept of dura- 
tion when applied to time is, therefore, a merely relative con- 
cept. One time-idea may be more lasting than another, but 
no time-idea can have absolute duration, for without the double 
relation of different sensations to one another and to the ideat- 
ing subject, no such ideas at all could arise. Even an unusually 
long unchanging sensation can not be retained. We interrupt it 
continually with other sensational contents. 
We may, however, separate the two temporal relations always 
united in actual experience, that of the elements to one another 
and to the ideating subject, since each is connected with certain 
particular attributes of time-ideas. In fact, this separation of the 
two relations found its expression in particular words for certain 
forms of occurrence in time even prior to an exact psycho- 
logical analysis of time-ideas. If the relation of the elements to 
one another is alone attended to, without regard to their rela- 
tion to the subject, temporal modes come to be discriminated, 
such, for example, as brief, long, regularly repeating, irregularly 
changing, ete. If, on the contrary, the relation of the subject 
is attended to and the objective forms of occurrence abstracted 
from, we have as the chief forms of this relation the temporal 
stages past, present, and future. 
A. TEMPORAL TOUCH-IDEAS. 
3. The orginal development of temporal ideas belongs to 
touch. Tactual sensations, accordingly, furnish the general 
substratum for the rise of both the spacial and temporal
-P-A-G-E-163
  
§ U1. Temporal Ideas. 145 
arrangements of ideational elements (p. 104, 3). The spacial 
functions of touch, however, come from, the owter tactual 
sensations, while the amer sensations which accompany move- 
ments are the primary contents of the earliest temporal 
ideas. 
The mechanical properties of the limbs are important 
physiological bases for the rise of these ideas. The arms and 
legs can be moved in the shoulder-joints and hip-joints by 
their muscles, and are at the same time subject to the action 
of gravitation drawing them downward. As a result there 
are two kinds of movements possible for them. First, we 
have those which are continually regulated by voluntary ac- 
tivity of the muscles and may, therefore, be indefinitely va- 
ried and accommodated at every moment to the existing needs 
— we will call these the arhythmical movements. Secondly, 
we have those in which the voluntary energy of the muscles 
is operative only so far as it is required to set the limbs 
oscillating in their joints and to maintain this movement — 
rhythmical movements. We may neglect for our present 
consideration the arhythmical movements exhibited in the 
various uses of the limbs. Their temporal attributes are in 
all probability derived from the rhythmical movements, and 
only a very indefinite comparison of the duration of irregular 
movements is possible. 
4, With rhythmical movements the case is different. Their 
significance for the psychological development of time-ideas is 
due to the same principle which gives them their importance 
as physiological organs, namely, the principle of the isochron- 
ism of oscillations of like amplitude. In walking, the regu- 
lar oscillations of our legs in the hip-joints not only make 
the muscular energy expended less, but r-duce to a minimum 
the continual voluntary control of the m-vements. Furtlier- 
more, in natural walking the arms are supplementary _ ids. 
Wonpz, Psychology. 10
-P-A-G-E-164
  
146 II. Psychical Compounds. 
Their oscillation is not interrupted at every step like that of 
the legs by the placing of the foot on the ground, so that 
th y furnish because of their continuity a means for the 
more uniform regulation of the movements. 
Every single period of oscillation in such a movement is 
made up of a continuous succession of sensations that are 
repeated in the following period in exactly the same order. 
The two limits of the period are marked by a complex of 
outer tactual sensations: the beginning by the impression 
accompanying the removal of the foot from the ground, the 
end by that accompanying its return to the ground. Be- 
tween these there is a continuous series of weak inner tactual 
sensations from the joints and muscles. The beginning and end 
of this series of inner sensations coincide with the outer 
sensations and are more intense than those between them. 
They arise from the impulse of movement coming to the 
muscles and joints and from the sudden inhibition of the 
same, and serve also to mark off the periods. 
Sonnected with this regular succession of sensations is 
a regular and exactly parallel series of feelings. If we con- 
sider a single period in a series of rhythmical movements, 
there is always at its beginning and end a feeling of fulfilled 
expectation. Between the two limits of the period, beginning 
with the first movement, is a gradually growing feeling of 
strained expectation, which suddenly sinks at the last moment 
from its maximum to zero, to make place for the rapidly 
rising and sinking feeling of fulfillment. From this point on 
the same series is again repeated. Thus, the whole process 
of a rhythmical touch-movement consists, on its affective side, 
of two qualitatively antagonistic feelings. In their general 
character these feelings belong to the direction of straining 
and relaxing feelings (p. 83). One is a momentary feeling, 
that is, one that rises very rapidly to its maximum and then 
 
-P-A-G-E-165
  § 11. Temporal Ideas. 147 
sinks with equal rapidity; the other is a feeling of long duration 
which gradually reaches a maximum and then suddenly dis- 
appears. As a result, the most intense affective processes 
are crowded together at the extremities of the periods, and 
are made all the more intense through the contrast between 
the feeling of satisfaction and the preceding feeling of ex- 
pectation. Just in the same way that this sharply marked 
limit between the single periods has its sensational substratum 
in the strong outer and inner tactual impressions that arise 
at this instant, as above mentioned, so we have a complete 
correspondence between the gradual rise of the feeling of 
expectation and the continuous series of weaker inner tactual 
sensations accompanying the oscillatory movements of the 
limbs. 
5. The simplest temporal ideas of touch are made up of 
the rhythmically arranged sensations that follow one another 
with perfect uniformity in the manner described, when like 
oscillatory movements are repeatedly carried out. But even 
in ordinary walking a slight tendency toward a somewhat 
greater complication arises; the beginning of the first of tro 
successive periods is emphasized, both in the sensation and in the 
accompanying feeling, more than the beginning of the second. 
In this case the rhythm of movement begins to be metrical. 
In fact, such a regular succession of accented and unaccert- 
ed ideas corresponds to the simplest measure, ?/,-time. It 
arises easily in ordinary walking because of the physiological 
superiority of the right side, and appears very regularly when 
several persons are walking together — in marching. In the 
latter case even more than two periods may be united into 
one rhythmical unit. The same is true of the complicated 
rhythmical movements of the dance. But in such composite 
tactual rhythms the auditory temporal ideas have a decided 
influence.

  148 II. Psychieal Compounds. 
B. TEMPORAL AUDITORY IDEAS. 
6. The attribute of the auditory sense which most of all 
adapts it to the more accurate apprehension of the temporal 
relations in external processes, is the exceedingly short per- 
sistence of its sensations after the external stimulation; so 
that any temporal succession of sounds is reproduced with 
almost perfect fidelity in the corresponding succession of 
sensations. In close connection with this we have certain 
psychological properties of temporal auditory ideas. In the 
first place, they differ from temporal ideas of touch in that 
often only the extremities of the single intervals that go to 
make up the total idea, are marked by sensations. In such 
a case the relations of such intervals to one another are 
estimated essentially by the apparently empty or heteroge- 
neously filled intervals that lie between the limiting sen- 
sations. 
This is especially noticeable in the case of rhythmical 
auditory ideas. There are in general two possible forms of 
such ideas: continuous or only rarely interrupted successions 
of relatively lasting sensations, and discontinuous successions 
of strokes, in which only the extremities of the rhythmical 
periods are marked by external sounds. For a discontinuous 
succession of entirely uniform sounds the temporal attributes 
of the ideas are in general more apparent than for lasting 
impressions, since in the former case the influences of the 
tonal qualities are entirely wanting. We may confine our 
consideration to discontinuous series, because the principles 
that apply here hold for continuous successions also. In 
fact, the rhythmical division in the latter case, as may be 
easily observed, is made by means of certain single accents 
which are either given in the external impression or abitra- 
rily applied to it. 
 
-P-A-G-E-167
  
$ 11. Temporal Ideas. 149 
7. A series of regular strokes made in this way as the sim- 
plest form of temporal auditory ideas, is distinguished from 
the simplest form of temporal touch-ideas, described above 
(p. 147), mainly by the absence of all objective sensational 
content in the intervals. The external impressions here do 
nothing but divide the separate intervals from one another. 
Still, the intervals of such a series are not entirely empty, 
but are filled by subjective affective and sensational contents 
which correspond fully to those observed in tactual ideas. 
Most emphatic of all are the affective contents of the inter- 
vals. These feelings in their successive periods of gradually 
rising and suddenly satisfied expectation, are the same as in 
the course of a rhythmical tactual movement. Even the 
sensational substratum for these feeling is not entirely ab- 
sent; it is merely more variable. Sometimes it is nothing but 
the sensations of tension of the tympanum in their various 
intensities. Then again it is the accompanying sensations of 
tension from other organs, or finally other sensations of move- 
ment in cases where an involuntary rhythmical movement is 
connected with the auditory series. But on account of the 
changeable character and generally small intensity of these 
motor sensations, the affective processes in auditory ideas are 
very much more clearly perceptible. 
It follows from the conditions described that the influence 
of the subjective elements on the character of time-ideas is 
the easiest to demonstrate. First of all, this shows itself in 
the effect which different rates of the sensations have on the 
formation of temporal ideas. It is found that there is a 
certain medium rate of about 0.2 sec. which is most favor- 
able for the union of a number of successive auditory im- 
pressions. Now, it is easy to observe that this is the rate 
at which the above mentioned subjective sensations and feel- 
ings are most emphatic in their alternation. If the rate is
-P-A-G-E-168
  
150 II. Psychical Compounds. 
made much slower, the strain of expectation is too great and 
passes into an unpleasurable feeling which becomes more and 
more unendurable. If, on the contrary, the rate is acceler- 
ated, the rapid alternation of feelings becomes fatiguing. 
Thus, in both directions limits are approached where the 
synthesis of the impressions into a rhythmical time-idea is no 
longer possible. The upper limit is about one second, the 
lower about 0.1 sec. 
8. Then again, this influence of the course of our sen- 
sations and feelings upon our apprehension of temporal inter- 
vals, shows itself just as clearly in the changes that our idea 
of such an interval undergoes when the conditions of its 
apprehension are varied without changing its objective length. 
Thus, it has been observed that in general a period divided 
into intervals is estimated as longer than one not so divided. 
We have here a phenomenon analogous to that observed in 
the illusion with interrupted lines (p. 125). The overestimation 
is generally much greater for temporal intervals. This is ob- 
viously due to the fact that the oft repeated alternation in 
sensations and feelings in an interval of time have a much 
greater influence than the interruption of the movement 
through points of division in the case of the similar space- 
illusion. Furthermore, if in a long series of regular beats 
single impressions are emphasized by their greater intensity 
or by some qualitative peculiarity, the uniform result is the 
overestimation of the intervals preceding and following the 
emphasized impression, in comparison with the other inter- 
vals of the same series. If, however, a certain rhythm is 
produced successively with weak and then with strong beats, 
the rate appears slower in the first case than in the second. 
These phenomena are also explicable from the influ- 
ence of the sensational and affective changes. An impres- 
sion distinguished from the rest, demands a change in the
-P-A-G-E-169
§ 11. Temporal Ideas. 151 
course of the sensations, and especially of the feelings, preceding 
its apprehension, for there must be a more intense strain of 
expectation and a correspondingly stronger feeling of relief 
or satisfaction. The feeling of expectation lengthens the 
interval preceding the impression, the feeling of relief that 
following. The case is different when the whole series is 
made up at one time of weak impressions, and at another of 
strong ones. In order to perceive a weak impression we 
must concentrate our attention upon it more. The sensations 
of tension and the accompanying feelings are, accordingly, 
more intense, as may be easily observed, for weaker beats than 
for stronger ones. Here too, then, the different intensities of 
the subjective elements that give rise to them are reflected 
in the differences between temporal ideas. The effect is, 
therefore, not only lost, but even reversed, when we compare 
not weak with strong but strong with still stronger beats. 
9. The tendency found in the case of rhythmical touch- 
ideas for at least to like periods to unite and form a re- 
gular metrical unit shows itself in auditory ideas also, only 
in a much more marked degree. In tactual movements, 
where the sensations that limit the single periods are under 
the influence of the will, this tendency to form a rhythmical 
series shows itself in the actwal alternation of weaker and 
stronger impressions. With auditory sensations, on the other 
hand, where the single impressions can be dependent only 
on external conditions, and are, therefore, objectively exactly 
alike, this tendency may lead to the following characteristic 
illusion. In a series of beats which are exactly alike in in- 
tensity and are separated by equal periods of time, certain 
single beats, occurring at regular intervals, are always heard 
as stronger than the others. The time that most frequently 
arises when there is nothing to determine it, is the 2,,-time, 
that is, the regular alternation of arses and theses. A slight  
-P-A-G-E-170
  152 IL. Psychical Compounds. 
modification of this, the %/,-time, where two unaccented fol- 
low one accented beat, is also very common. This tendency 
to mark time can be overcome only by an effort of the will, 
and then only for very fast or very slow rates, where, from 
the very nature of the series, the limits of rhythmical per- 
ception are nearly reached. For medium rates, which are 
especially favorable to the rise of rhythmical ideas, a sup- 
pression of this tendency for any length of time is hardly 
possible. If the effort is made to unite as many impressions 
as possible in a unitary time-idea, the phenomena become 
more complicated. We have accents of different degrees which 
alternate in regular succession with unaccented members of 
the series and thus, through the resulting divisions of the 
whole into groups, the number of impressions that may be 
comprehended in a single idea is considerably increased. 
The presence of two different grades of accent gives 3/,-time 
and 5 .-time, the presence of three grades gives 4/,-time and 
",y-time, and as forms with three feet we have °/,-time and 
"2 .-time. More than three grades of accentuation or, when 
the unaccented note is counted, more than four grades of 
intensity, are not to be found in either musical or poetical 
rhythms, nor can we produce more by voluntarily formation of 
rhythmical ideas. Obviously, these three grades of accentua- 
tion mark the limits of the possible complexity of temporal 
ideas, in a way analogous to that in which the maximal num- 
ber of included beats (§ 15, 6) marks the limits of their 
length. 
The phenomenon of subjective accentuation and its in- 
fluence on the sensation of rhythms, shows clearly that 
temporal ideas, like spacial ideas, are not derived from objective 
impressions alone, but that there are connected with these, 
subjective elements, whose character determines the appre- 
hension of the objective impressions. The primary cause
-P-A-G-E-171
$ 11. Temporal Ideas. 153 
of the accentuation of a particular beat is always to be found 
in the increased intensity of the preceding and concomitant 
feelings and sensations of movement. This increase in the in- 
tensity of the subjective elements is then carried over to the 
objective impression, and makes the latter also seem more 
intense. The strengthening of the subjective elements may 
be voluntary, through the increase of the muscular strain 
which produces sensations of movement, and in this way, 
finally results in a corresponding increase in the feelings of 
expectation; or this strengthening may take place ith- 
out volition, when the effort to perceive a number of im- 
pressions together brings about an immediate articulation of 
the temporal idea through the corresponding subjective sen- 
sational and affective variations. 
C. GENERAL CONDITIONS FOR TEMPORAL IDEAS. 
10. If we seek to account for the rise of temporal ideas 
on the basis of the phenomena just discussed, and of the 
regular combination of subjective sensational and affective ele- 
ments with objective impressions, as it is there apparent; we 
must start with the fact that a sensation thought of by itself, 
can no more have temporal than it could have spacial attri- 
butes. Position in time can be possible only when single 
psychical elements enter into certain characteristic relations 
with other such elements. This condition of the union of a 
number of psychical elements holds for temporal ideas just 
as much as for those of space, but the kind of union is 
characteristic, and essentially different from that in space- 
ideas. 
The members of a temporal series a b ¢ de f, can all 
be immediately presented as a single whole, when the series 
has reached f, just as well as if they were a series of points 
in space. In the latter case, however, they would, on ac-
-P-A-G-E-172
  
  154 II. Psychical Compounds. 
count of original ocular reflexes, be arranged in relation to 
the point of fixation, and this fixation-point could, at different 
times, be any one of the impressions a to f. In time-ideas, 
on the other hand, it is always the dmpression of the present 
moment in relation to which all the rest are arranged in time. 
When a new impression becomes, in a similar manner, the 
present impression, even though its sensational contents are 
exactly the same as that of the earlier, still, it will be ap- 
prehended as subjectively different, for though the affective 
state accompanying a sensation may, indeed, be related to 
the feelings of another moment, the two can never be iden- 
tical. Suppose, for example, that following the series a b ¢ 
de f, there is a second series of impressions, a’ b’ c d’ e’ 
f’, in which a’ =a, b' =), c' =c, etc., so far as their sen- 
sational elements are concerned. Let us represent the ac- 
companying feelings by @ B y 0 € g and a’ p’ 7’ 0’ é' g’. 
Then a and a’, 6 and ~’, y and 7’, etc., will be similar 
feelings, because the sensations are the same; but they will 
not be identical, because every affective element depends not 
only upon the sensation with which it is immediately con- 
nected but also upon the state of the subject as determined 
by the totality of its experiences. The state of the subject is 
different for each of the members of the series a’ b’ c' d’..., 
from what it was for the corresponding member of the.series a b 
cd..., because when the impression a’ arrives, a has already 
been present, and so a’ can be referred back to a, while no 
such thing was possible in the case of a. Analogous differ- 
ences in the affective states show themselves in composite 
series when repeated. These states are never identical, how- 
ever much the subjective conditions of the momentarily present 
feelings may agree, for every one of them has its character- 
istic relation to the totality of psychical processes. If we 
assume, for example, a succession of a number of similar
-P-A-G-E-173
§ 11. Temporal Ideas. 155 
series ab ed, aU ¢ d', a" b’ ce" a’, ete., in which @ equals 
d@ and a’, b equals b' and 0”, ete., so far as their sensation- 
al contents are concerned, still, a” differs from a’ in its 
affective conditions, for @ can be referred back only to a, 
while @ can be referred back to both a’ and a. Besides 
this, it is true that other differences between impressions 
like in themselves always arise from some chance accompany- 
ing sensations which influence the affective state. 
11. Since every element of a temporal idea is arranged 
in relation to the impression immediately present, as above 
remarked, it follows that this present impression will have 
one of the attributes of the fixation-point in spacial com- 
pounds. It will be more clearly and distinctly perceived 
than other elements of the same idea. But there is a great 
difference in the fact that this most distinct perception is 
not connected, as in the case of spacial ideas, with the phys- 
iological organization of the sense-organ, but is due entirely 
to the general attributes of the ideating subject, as expressed 
in the affective processes. The momentary feeling accom- 
panying the immediately present impression is what helps» 
to its clearest apprehension. We may, accordingly, call 
the part of a temporal idea which forms the immediate 
impression the fixation-point of the idea or in general, since 
it does not depend on external structure, as does the fixation- 
point of spacial ideas, we may call it figuratively the dner 
fixation-point. The inner fixation-point is, then, that part 
of a temporal idea which corresponds to the most clearly 
ideated and the immediately present impression. The impres- 
sions that lie outside this point of fixation, that is, impressions 
that have preceded the present, are indirectly perceived. 
They are arranged in a regular gradation of diminishing 
degrees of clearness, from the fixation-point. A unitary 
temporal idea is possible only so long as the degree of clear-   
   
-P-A-G-E-174
  156 IT. Psychical Compounds. 
ness for each of its elements has some positive value. When 
the clearness of any element sinks to zero, the idea divides 
into its components. 
12. The inner fixation-point of the temporal senses differs 
essentially from the outer fixation-point of the spacial. senses, 
in that its character is primarily determined, not by sensa- 
tional, but by affective elements. Since these affective ele- 
ments are continually changing, in consequence of the vary- 
ing conditions of psychical life,.the inner fixation-point is 
also always changing. This change of the inner fixation- 
point is called the continuous flow of time. By continuous 
flow we mean to express the fact that no moment of time 
is like any other, and that no such moment can return 
(ef. sup. p. 148, 2a). This fact is connected with the one- 
dimensional character of time, which is due to this very 
circumstance, that the inner fixation-point of temporal ideas 
is continually moving forward, so that a single point can 
never recur. The arrangement of time in one dimension, 
with reference always to a changing point of fixation, in 
which the subject represents itself, is what gives rise to the 
result that the elements of time-ideas have a fixed relation, 
not only with respect to one another, but also with respect 
to the ideating subject (p. 148, 2). 
13. If we try to give an account of the means for 
the formation of this reciprocally interdependent order of 
the parts of an idea, and of their determination in regard 
to the ideating subject, it is obvious that these means can 
be nothing but certain of the elements of the idea itself, 
which. considered in themselves, have no temporal attributes, 
but gain such attributes through their union. We may call 
these elements temporal signs, after the analogy of local signs. 
The characteristic conditions for the development of temporal 
ideas indicate from the first that these temporal signs are,
-P-A-G-E-175
  
§ 11. Temporal Ideas. 157 
in the main, affective elements. In the course of any rhyth- 
mical series every impression is immediately characterized 
by the concomitant feeling of expectation, while the sensa- 
tion is of influence only in so far as it arouses the feeling. 
This may be clearly perceived when a rhythmical series is 
suddenly interrupted. Furthermore, the only sensations that 
are never absent as components of all time-ideas are the 
sensations of movement. In the case of tactual ideas these 
sensations of movement belong to the immediate element~ 
of the ideas themselves, in auditory and other compounds 
that are brought into the time form, they are always present 
ns subjective accompanying phenomena. We may, accord- 
ingly, regard the feelings of expectation as the qualitative, 
the sensations of movement as the drtensire, temporal signs 
of a temporal idea. The idea itself must then be looked 
upon as a fusion of the two kinds of temporal signs with 
each other and with the objective sensations arranged in the 
temporal form. Thus, the sensations of movement, as a series 
of intensive sensations, give a uniform measure for the ar- 
rangement of the objective sensations as characterized in 
quality by the concomitant feelings. 
13a. The sensations of movement play a similar part in the 
formation of both time-ideas and space-ideas. ‘his like sen- 
sational substratum leads very naturally to a recognition of a 
relation between these two forms of perception, which finds its 
expression in the geometrical representation of time by a straight 
line. Still, there is an essential difference between the complex 
system of temporal signs and the systems of local signs in the 
fact that the former is based primarily, not on the qualitative 
attributes of sensations, connected with certain special external 
sense-organs, but on feelings which may come in exactly the 
same way from the most widely differing kinds of sensation, since 
they are not dependent on the objective content of these sen- 
sations, but on their subjective synthesis. These characteristics  
-P-A-G-E-176
  158 IL. Psychical Compounds. 
of time-ideas account for the universal significance that we attribute 
to them. This was what was improperly expressed in the Kantian 
principle, that time is a “form of the inner sense”. This ex- 
pression is to be criticised on the ground of its erroneous pre- 
supposition of an inner sense (p. 8 sq.) 
Here again we have the same opposed nativistic and genetic 
theories on the psychological origin of time-ideas, as we had in the 
case of spacial ideas (p. 114, 12a). In this case, however, nativism 
has never developed a theory in any proper sense. It usually 
limits itself to the general assumption that time is a “connate 
form of perception”, without attempting to give any account 
of the influence of the elements and conditions of temporal ideas 
which can be actually demonstrated. The genetic theories of 
older psychology, as, for example, that of Herbart, seek to de- 
duce time-perception from ideational elements only. This is, 
however, pure speculation and loses sight of the conditions given 
in actual experience. 
§ 12. COMPOSITE FEELINGS. 
1. In the development of temporal ideas it appears clear- 
ly that the discrimination of sensational and affective com- 
ponents in immediate experience is purely a product of 
abstraction. For time-ideas the abstraction proves impossible, 
because, in this case, certain feelings play an essential part 
in the rise of the ideas. Time-ideas may, therefore, be called 
ideas only when the final results of the process, the arrange- 
ment of certain sensations in relation to one another and to 
the subject, are considered; when their real composition is 
looked into, they are complex products of sensations and 
feelings. They are thus to a certain extent transitional forms 
between ideas and those psychical compounds that are made 
up of affective elements, and are designated by the general 
name affective processes. These affective processes resemble 
time-ideas especially in the impossibility of an abstract sepa-
-P-A-G-E-177
  
§ 12. Composite Feelings. 159 
ration of the affective from the sensational elements in the 
investigation of their rise. This is due to the fact that in 
the development of all kinds of affective processes, sensations 
and ideas are determining factors, just as feelings are among 
the essential factors of temporal ideas. 
2. Intensive affective combinations, or composite feelings, 
must be the first affective processes discussed, because in 
them the characteristic attributes of a single compound are 
the products of a momentary state. The description of the 
feeling, therefore, requires only the exact comprehension of 
the momentary condition, not a combination of several pro- 
cesses occurring in time and proceeding from one another. 
In this respect, the composite feelings stand in the same 
relation to emotions and volitions, which always consist of 
affective processes extending through periods of time, as 
intensive ideas do to extensive. Intensive psychical com- 
pounds, in the broadest sense of the term, include, accord- 
ingly, intensive ideas and composite feelings. Extensive com- 
pounds include as special forms of temporal arrangements. 
besides the temporal ideas, also emotions and volitions. 
3. Composite feelings, then, are intensive states of uni- 
tary character in which single simple affective components 
are to be preceived. We may distinguish in every such 
feeling component feelings and a resultant feeling. The last 
component feelings are always simple sense-feelings. Several 
of these may unite to form a partial resultant which enters 
into the whole as a compound component. 
Every composite feeling may, accordingly. be divided, 
1) into a total feeling made up of all its components, and 
2) into single partial feelings which go to make up the 
total feeling. These partial feelings are in turn of different 
grades according as they are simple sense-feclings (parti! 
feelings of the first order’ or feelings which are themselves  
-P-A-G-E-178
  160 II. Psychical Compounds. 
composite (partial feelings of the second or higher orders). 
Where we have partial feelings of higher orders, complicated 
combinations or interlacings of the component elements may 
take place. A partial feeling of lower order may, at the 
same time, enter into several partial feelings of higher order. 
Such interlacings may render the nature of the total feeling 
exceedingly complicated. The whole may sometimes change 
its character, even when its elements remain the same, ac- 
cording as one or the other of the possible combinations of 
partial feelings takes place. 
3a. Thus, the musical chord ¢ e g has a corresponding total 
feeling of harmony whose last elements, or partial feelings of 
the first order, are the feelings corresponding to the single clangs 
¢, e, and g. Between these two kinds of feeling stand, as par- 
tial feelings of the second order, the three feelings of harmony 
from the double clangs ¢ e, ¢ g and ¢ g. The character of the 
total feeling may have four different shades according as one of 
these partial feelings of the second order predominates, or all 
are equally strong. The cause of the predominance of one of 
these complex partial feelings may be either the greater inten- 
sity of its sensational components, or the influence of preceding 
feelings. If, for example, ¢ e g follows ¢’ e g the effect of ¢ € 
will be intensified, while if ¢ e g follows c ea the same will 
hold for ¢ g. Similarly, a number of colors may have a differ- 
ent effect according as one or the other partial combination 
predominates. In the last case, however, because of the exten- 
sive arrangement of the impressions, the spacial proximity has 
an influence antagonistic to the variation in the manner of com- 
bination and, furthermore, the influence of the spacial form with 
all its accompanying conditions is an essentially complicating 
factor, 
4. The structure of composite feelings is, thus, in general 
exceedingly complicated. Still, there are different degrees 
of development even here. The complex feelings arising from 
mpressions of touch, smell, and taste are essentially simpler

in character than those connected with auditory and visual 
ideas. : 
The total feeling connected with outer and inner tactual 
sensations is designated in particular as the common feeling, 
since it is regarded as the feeling in which our total state of 
sensible comfort or discomfort expresses itself. From this 
point of view, the two lowest chemical senses, those of smell 
and taste, must also be regarded as contributors to the sen- 
sational substratum of the common feeling, for the partial 
feelings that arise from these two senses unite with those 
from touch to form inseparable affective complexes. In single 
cases, to be sure, one or the other of these feelings may 
play such an important part that the others disappear entire- 
ly. Still, in the midst of all this change in its sensational 
substratum, the common feeling is always the immediate 
expression of our sensible comfort and discomfort, and is. 
therefore, of all our composite feelings most closely related 
to the simple sense-feelings. Auditory and visual sensations. 
on the other hand, contribute to the sensational substratum 
of the common feeling only in exceptional cases, especially 
when the intensity is unusually great. 
4a, The combination of partial feelings to a composite feeling 
was first noticed in the case of the common feeling. The psy- 
chological laws of this combination were indeed misunderstood. 
and, as is usually the case in physiology, the feeling was not 
distinguished from its underlying sensations. Common feeling 
was, thus, sometimes defined as the “consciousness of our sen- 
sational state”, or again as the “totality, or unanalyzed chaos 
of sensations” which come to us from all parts of our body. 
As a matter of fact, the common feeling consists of a number 
of partial feeling. But it is not the mere sum of these feelings: 
it is rather a resultant total feeling of unitary character. At 
the same time it is, however, a total feeling of the simplest 
possible composition, made up of partial feelings of the first

order, that is, of single sense-feelings which generally do not 
unite to form partial feelings of the second or of higher orders. 
In the resultant feeling a single partial feeling is -usually predomi- 
nant. This is regularly the case when a very strong local sen- 
sation is accompanied by a feeling of pain. On the other hand, 
weaker sensations may determine the predominant affective tone 
through their relatively greater importance. This is especially 
frequent in the case of sensations of smell and taste, and also 
in the case of certain sensations connected with the regular func- 
tioning of the organs, such as the inner tactual sensations accom- 
panying the movements of walking. Often the relatively greater 
importance of a single sensation is so slight that the predomi- 
nating feeling can not be discovered except by directing our 
attention to our own subjective state. In such a case the 
concentration of the attention upon it can generally make any 
partial feeling whatever predominant. 
5. The common feeling is the source of the distinction be- 
tween pleasurable and unpleasurable feelings. This distinction 
1s then carried over to the single simple feelings that com- 
pose it, and sometimes even to all feelings. Pleasurable and 
unpleasurable are expressions well adapted to the indication 
of the chief extremes between which the common feeling, as 
a total feeling corresponding to the sensible comfort or dis- 
comfort of the subject, may oscillate; though to be sure, this 
feeling may not infrequently lie for a longer or shorter period 
m an indifference-zone. In the same way, these expressions 
may be applied to the single constituents so far as they go 
to make up one of the total feelings. On the other hand, 
it is entirely unjustifiable to apply these names to all other 
teelings, or, as is sometimes done, to make their appli- 
cability a necessary factor in the general definition of feeling. 
Even for the common feeling, pleasurable and unpleasurable 
can only be used as general class-names which include a 
number of qualitatively different feelings. This variety among
-P-A-G-E-181
$ 12. Composite Feelings. 163 
feelings of the same class results from the very great varia- 
tions in the composition of the single total feelings that we 
have included under the general name common feeling cf. 
p. 82 sq.). 
6. The composite character mentioned is the reason why 
there are common feelings which can not, strictly speaking, 
be called pleasurable or unpleasurable, because they contain 
elements belonging to both classes, and under circumstances 
either the one kind or the other may predominate. Such 
feelings made up of partial feelings of opposite character and 
deriving their characteristics from this combination, may be 
called contrast-feclings. A simple form of such among the 
common feelings is that of tckling. It is made up of a weak 
pleasurable feeling accompanying a weak external tactual sen- 
sation, and of feelings connected with muscular sensations 
aroused by the strong reflex impulses from the tactual stimuli. 
These reflex impulses may spread more or less, and often 
cause inhibitions of respiration when they reach the dia- 
phragm, so that the resultant feeling may vary greatly in 
single cases in intensity, scope, and composition. 
7. The composite feelings from sight and hearing are 
commonly called elementary aesthetic feelings. This name 
includes all feelings that are connected with composite per- 
ceptions and are therefore themselves composite. As a spe- 
cial form of feelings belonging to this class defined by the 
broader meaning of the term atoPnoig, we have those which 
are the elements of aesthetic effects in the narrower sense. 
The term elementary does not apply in this case to the 
feelings themselves, for they are by no means simple, but it 
is merely intended to express the relative distinction be- 
tween these and still more composite higher aesthetic feelings. 
The perceptive, or elementary aesthetic, feelings of sight 
and hearing may serve as representatives of all the com- 
bbe  
-P-A-G-E-182
164 IL Psychical Compounds. 
posite feelings that arise in the course of intellectual pro- 
cesses, such as the logical, moral, and higher aesthetical 
feelings. For the general psychological structure of these 
complex affective forms is exactly that of the simpler per- 
ceptive feelings, except that the former are always connected 
with feelings and emotions that arise from the whole inter- 
connection of psychical processes. 
While the extremes between which the common feelings 
move are chiefly the affective qualities that we call pleasur- 
able and unpleasurable in the sense of personal comfort and 
discomfort, the elementary aesthetic feelings belong to the 
same affective direction, but in the more objective sense of 
agreeable and disagreeable feelings. These terms express the 
relation of the object to the ideating subject rather than any 
personal state. It is still more apparent here than in the case 
of pleasurable and unpleasurable feelings, that each of these 
terms is not the name of a single feeling, but indicates a 
general direction, to which belong an endless variety of feelings 
with individual peculiarities for each single idea. In single 
cases, too, but more variably, the other affective directions 
p- 83), those of the arousing and subduing, of the straining 
and relaxing feelings, may show themselves. 
8. If we neglect for the moment this general classification 
mentioned, according to which the single forms are brought 
under the chief affective directions, all perceptive feelings may 
be divided into the tevo classes of intensive and extensive 
feelings, according to the relations which exist between the 
sensational elements and determine the quality of the feelings. 
By intensive feelings we mean those that depend on the re- 
lation of the qualitative attributes of the sensational elements 
of the ideas, by extensive feelings those that arise from the 
spacial and temporal arrangement of the elements. The 
expressions “intensive” and “extensive” do not refer to the
-P-A-G-E-183
  § 12. Composite Feelings. 165 
character of the feelings themselves, for they. are in reality 
always intensive, but to the conditions for the rise of these 
feelings. 
Intensive and extensive feeling are, accordingly, not mere- 
ly the subjective concomitants of the corresponding ideas, 
but, since every idea consists usually of elements that are 
qualitatively different and of some extensive arrangement of 
these impressions, the same idea may be at once the substratum 
of both intensive and extensive feelings. Thus, a visual ob- 
ject made up of different colored parts arouses an intensive 
feeling through the mutual relation of the colors and an 
extensive feeling through its form. A succession of clangs 
is connected with an intensive feeling which corresponds to 
the qualitative relation of the clangs, and with an exten- 
sive feeling coming from the rhythmical or arhythmical 
temporal succession of the same. In this way, both inten- 
sive and extensive feelings are always connected with visual 
and auditory ideas, but, of course, under certain conditions 
one form may push the other into the background. Thus, 
when we hear a clang for just an instant, the only feeling 
perceived is the intensive feeling. Or when, on the other 
hand, a rhythmical series of indifferent sounds is heard. only 
the extensive feeling is noticeable. For the purpose of psy- 
chological analysis it is obviously of advantage to produce 
conditions under which one particular affective form is pres- 
ent and others so far as possible excluded. 
9. When intensive feelings are observed in this way, it 
appears that those accompanying the combination of colors 
follow the rule that a combination of two colors whose qual- 
itative difference is a maximum, also gives a maximal 
agreeable feeling. Still, every particular color-combination 
has its specific affective character made up of the partial 
feelings from the single colors, and of the total feeling arising
-P-A-G-E-184
166 II. Psychical Compounds. 
as a resultant ef the same. Then, too, as in the case of 
simple color-feelings, the effect is complicated by chance 
associations and the complex feelings coming from them (p. 76). 
Combinations of more than two colors have not been ade- 
quately investigated. 
The feelings connected with combinations of clangs are 
exceedingly numerous and various. They constitute the affect- 
ive sphere in which we see most clearly the formation of 
partial feelings of different orders discussed above (p. 160), 
together with their interlacings varying under special condi- 
tions. The investigation of the single feelings that thus arise 
is one of the problems of the psychological aesthetics of 
music. 
10, Eztensive feelings may be subdivided into spacial and 
temporal. Of these, the first, or the feelings of form, belong 
mainly to vision, and the second, or the feelings of rhythm, 
to hearing, while the beginning of the development of both 
are to be found in touch. 
The optical feeling of form shows itself first of all in the 
preference of regular to irregular forms and then in the 
preference among different regular forms of those which have 
certain simple proportions in their various parts. The most im- 
portant of these proportions are those of symmetry, or 1:1, and 
of the golden section, or z+ 1:2= 2:1 (the whole is to the 
greater part as the greater part is to the smaller). The fact that 
symmetry is generally preferred for the horizontal dimensions of 
tigures and the golden section for the vertical, is probably due 
to associations, especially with organic forms, such as that 
of the human body. This preference for regularity and cer- 
tain simple proportions can have no other interpretation than 
that the measurement of every single dimension is connect- 
ed with a sensation of movement and an accompanying 
sense-feeling which enters as a partial feeling into the total
-P-A-G-E-185
  
§ 12. Composite Feelings. 167 
optical feeling of form. The total feeling of regular arrange- 
ment that arises at the sight of the whole form, is thus 
modified by the relation of the different sensations as well as 
of the partial feelings to one another. As secondary compo- 
nents, which also fuse with the total feeling, we may have 
here too associations and their concomitant feelings. 
The feeling of rhythm is entirely dependent on the con- 
ditions discussed in considering temporal ideas. The partial 
feelings are here the feelings of strained and fulfilled expec- 
tation, which in their regular alternation constitute the rhyth- 
mical time-ideas themselves. The way in which these partial 
feelings are united, however, and especially the predominance 
of special ones in the total feeling, is, even more than the 
momentary character of an intensive feeling, dependent on 
the relation in which the feeling present at a given instant 
stands to the preceding feelings. This is especially apparent 
in the great influence that every alteration in rhythm exer- 
cizes on the accompanying feeling. For this reason as well 
as because of their general dependence on a particular tem- 
poral form of occurrence, the feelings of rhythm are the 
direct transitions to emotions. To be sure, an emotion 
may develop from any composite feeling, but in no other 
case is the condition for the rise of a feeling, as here, at the 
same time a necessary condition for the rise of a certain 
degree of emotion. The emotion is, however, usually moder- 
ated in this case, through the regular succession of feelings 
(cf. § 13, 1, 7). 
11. The immense variety of composite feelings and the 
equally great variety of their conditions, render any such 
comprehensive and at the same time unitary psychological 
theory as that which was possible for spacial and temporal 
ideas, entirely out of the question. Still, there are even here 
some common attributes, through which composite feelings  
-P-A-G-E-186
  168 IL. Psychical Compounds. 
may be brought under certain general psychological heads. 
There are two factors which go to make up every feeling: 
first, the relation of the combined partial feelings to one 
«nother, and second, their synthesis to a unitary total feel- 
ing. The first of these factors is more prominent in inten- 
xive, the second in extensive feelings. But in reality they 
are always united, and determine each other reciprocally. 
Thus, a figure which is all the time agreeable, may be more 
and more complex the more the relations of its parts accord 
with certain rules, and the same holds for a rhythm. On the 
other hand, the union to a single whole helps to emphasize 
the separate affective components. In all these respects 
combination of feelings show the closest resemblance to in- 
tensive ideas. The extensive arrangement of impressions, 
on the contrary, especially the spacial arrangement, tends, 
much more to favor a relatively independent coexistence of 
several. ideas. 
12. The close intensive union of all the components of 
a feeling, even in the case of those feelings whose corre- 
sponding ideas are spacial or temporal, is connected with a 
principle that holds for all affective processes, including those 
which we shall have to discuss later. This principle we will 
call that of the unity of the affective state. It may be for- 
mulated as follows: In a given moment only one total feel- 
ing is possible, or in other words, all the partial feelings 
present at a given moment unite, in every case, to form a 
single total feeling. This principle of the unity of affective 
states is obviously connected with the general relation 
between idea and feeling. For the “idea” deals with an 
immediate content of experience and the properties that 
belong to it, without regard to the subject; the “feeling” 
expresses the relation that invariably exists between this 
content and the subject.
-P-A-G-E-187
§ 13. Emotions. 169 
§ 13. EMOTIONS. 
1. Feelings, like all psychical phenomena, are never per- 
manent states. In the psychological analysis of a composite 
feeling, therefore, we must always think of a momentary af- 
fective state as held constant. This is easier the more slowly 
and continuously the psychical processes occur, so that the 
word feeling has come to be used mainly for relatively slow 
processes and for those which in their regular form of oc- 
curence never pass beyond a certain medium intensity, such 
as the feelings of rhythm. Where, on the other hand, a 
series of feelings succeeding one another in time unite to 
an interconnected process which is distinguished from preced- 
ing and following processes as an individual whole, and 
has in general a more intense effect on the subject than a 
single feeling, we call the unitary succession of feelings an 
emotion. 
This very name indicates that it is not any specific sub- 
jective contents of experience which distinguish emotion from 
feeling, but rather the effect which comes from a special 
combination of particular affective contents. In this way it 
comes that there is no sharp line of demarcation between 
feeling and emotion. Every feeling of greater intensity 
passes into an emotion, and the separation between the two 
depends on a more or less arbitrary abstraction. In the case 
of feelings that have a certain particular form of occurrence, 
that is feelings of rhythm, such an abstraction is strictly 
speaking impossible. The feeling of rhythm is distinguished 
at most by the small intensity of its moving effect on the 
subject, which is what gives “emotion” its name. Still, even 
this distinction is by no means fixed, and when the feelings 
produced by rhythmical impressions become somewhat more 
intense, as is usually the case, especially when the rhythm 
 
-P-A-G-E-188
170 IT. Psychical Compounds. 
1s connected with sensational contents that arouse the feelings 
greatly, they become in fact emotions. Feelings of rhythm 
are for this reason important aids both in music and 
poetry for portraying emotions and arousing them in the 
auditor. 
2. The names of different emotions, like those of feelings, 
do not indicate single processes, but classes in which a large 
uumber of single affective processes are grouped on the ground 
of certain common characteristics. Emotions such as those 
f joy. hope, anxiety, care, and anger, are accompanied in 
any concrete case by peculiar ideational contents, while their 
fective elements also and even the way in which they occur 
may vary greatly from time to time. The more composite 
a psychical processes is, the more variable will be its single 
concrete manifestations; a particular emotion, therefore, will 
he less apt to recur in exactly the same form than will a 
particular feeling. Every general name fore motions indicates, 
accordingly, certain typical forms in which related affective 
PIFOCESSOS OCOHT. 
3% Not every interconnected series of affective processes 
is am cmotion or can be classed as such under one of the 
typical forms discriminated by language. An emotion is a 
unitary whole which is distinguished from a composite feeling 
vnly through the two characteristics that it has a definite tem- 
poral course and that it exercises a more intense present and 
subsequent effect on the interconnection of psychical processes. 
The tirst characteristic arises from the fact that an emo- 
tion is a process of a higher order as compared with a single 
feeling, for it always includes a succession of several feelings. 
The second is closely connected with this first characteristic; 
it depends on the intensification of the effect produced by a 
summation of the feelings. 
As a result of these characteristics emotions have in the
-P-A-G-E-189
§ 13. Emotions. 171 
midst of all their variations in form a regularity in the man- 
ner of their occurrence. They always begin with a more or 
less intense inceptive feeling which is immediately character- 
istic in its quality and direction for the nature of the 
emotion, and is due either to an idea produced by an ex- 
ternal impression (outer emotional stimulation) or to a psy- 
chical process arising from associative or apperceptive con- 
ditions {inner stimulation). After this inceptive feeling comes 
an ideational process accompanied by the corresponding feel- 
ings. This process shows characteristic differences in the 
cases of particular emotions both in the quality of the feel- 
ings and in the rapidity of the process. Finally, the emotion 
closes with a terminal feeling which continues even after the 
emotion has given place to a quiet affective state, and in 
which the emotion gradually fades away, unless it passes 
directly into the inceptive feeling of a new emotion. This 
last case occurs especially in feelings of the intermittent 
type ‘cf. inf. 13). 
4. The intensification of the effect which may be observed 
in the course of an emotion, relates not merely to the psy- 
chical contents of the feelings that compose it, but to the 
physical concomitants as well. For single feelings these 
accompanying phenomena are limited to very slight changes 
in the innervation of the heart and respiratory organs, which 
can be demonstrated only by using exact graphic methods 
(p. 86 sq.). With emotions the case is essentially different. 
As a result of the summation and alternation of succesive 
affective stimuli there is here not only an intensification of 
the effect on heart, blood-vessels, and respiration, but the 
external muscles are always affected in an unmistakable 
manner. Movements of the oral muscles appear at first 
(mimetic movements), then movements of the arms and of 
the whole body (pantomimetic movements). In the case of 
   
-P-A-G-E-190
172 II. Psychical Compounds. 
stronger emotions there may be still more extensive disturb- 
ances of innervation, such as trembling, convulsive con- 
tractions of the diaphragm and of the facial muscles, and 
paralytic relaxation of the muscles. 
Because of their symptomatical significance for the emo- 
tions, all these movements are called expressive movements. 
As a rule they are entirely involuntary, either reflexes follow- 
ing emotional excitations, or impulsive acts prompted by the 
affective components of the emotion. They may be modified, 
however, in the most various ways through voluntary inten- 
sification or inhibition of the movements or even through 
intentional production of the same, so that the whole series 
of external reactions which we shall have to discuss under 
volitional acts, may take part in these expressive movements 
§ 14. These different forms of movement may be entirely 
alike in external character and may pass into each other 
without sharp limitations on their psychical side, so that for 
the outside observer they are as a rule indistinguishable. 
>. According to their symptomatical character, expressive 
movements may be divided into three classes. 1) Rurely 
intensive symptoms; these are always expressive movements for 
more intense emotions, and consist of stronger movements 
for emotions of middle intensity, and of sudden inhibition and 
paralysis of movement for violent emotions. 2) Qualitative 
expressions of feelings; these are mimetic movements, the 
most important .of which are the reactions of the oral mus- 
cles, resembling the reflexes following sweet, sour, and bitter 
impressions of taste; the reaction for sweet corresponds to 
pleasurable emotions, those for sour and bitter to unpleasur- 
able, while the other modifications of feeling, such as ex- 
citement and depression, strain and relief, are expressed by 
a tension of the muscles. 3) Expressions of ideas; these are 
generally pantomimetic movements that either point to the
-P-A-G-E-191
$ 13. Emotions. 173 
object of the emotion (indicative gestures) or else describe 
the objects as well as the processes connected with them by 
the form of the movement (depicting gestures). Obviously 
these three classes of expressive movements correspond ex- 
actly to the psychical elements of emotions and their fun- 
damental attributes: the first to their intensity, the second 
to the quality of the feelings, and the third to their idea- 
tional content. A concrete expressive movement may unite 
all three forms in itself. The third class, that of expressions 
of ideas, is of special psychological significance because of 
its genetic relations to speech (cf. § 21, 3). 
6. The changes in pulse and respiration that accompany 
emotions are of three kinds. 1) They may consist of the 
immediate effects of the feelings that make up the emotions, 
as, for example, a lengthening of the pulse-curve and 
respiration-curve when the feelings are pleasurable, and a 
shortening of the same for unpleasurable feelings (cf. sup. 
p. 87). This holds only for relatively quiet emotions, where 
the single feelings have sufficient time to develop. When 
this is not the case, other phenomena appear which depend 
not merely on the quality of the feelings, but also, and that 
mainly, on the intensity of the innervations due to their 
summation. 2) Such summations may consist of intensified 
innervation, which arises from an increase in the excitation 
resulting from a summation when the succession of feelings 
is not too rapid. This increase shows itself in retarded and 
strengthened pulse-beats, since the intenser excitation effects 
most the inhibitory nerves of the heart. Besides these there 
is usually an increased innervation of the mimetic and panto- 
mimetic muscles. These are called sthenic emotions. 3) If 
the feelings are very violent or last an unusually long time 
ina single direction, the emotion brings ehout a more or 
less extended paralysis of the innervation of the heart and
-P-A-G-E-192
  174 IT. Psychical Compounds. 
of the tension of the outer muscles. Under certain circum- 
stances disturbances in the innervation of special groups of 
muscles appear, especially those of the diaphragm and the 
sympathetic facial muscles. The first symptom of the pa- 
ralysis of the regulative cardiac nerves is a marked acceler- 
ation of the pulse and a corresponding acceleration of the 
respiration, accompanied by a weakening of the same, and a 
relaxation of the tension of the external muscles to a degree 
equal to that in paralysis. These are the asthenic emotions. 
There is still another distinction, which is not important 
enough, however, to lead to the formation of an independant 
class of physical effects of emotions, since we have to do 
here only with modifications of the phenomena characteristic 
of sthenic and asthenic emotions. It is the distinction between 
rapid and sluggish emotions, based upon the greater or less 
rapidity with which the increase or inhibition of the inner- 
vation appears. 
6a. Older psychology, following the method of Spinoza’s fa- 
mous doctrine of emotions, generally offered all kinds of logical 
reflections about emotions, for a-theory of emotions or even for 
a description of them. In recent times, on the other hand, the 
expressive movements and the other concomitants of emotion in 
the changes of innervation in pulse, respiratory organs, and 
blood-vessels, have attracted the most attention. Still, these 
phenomena, which are indeed valuable when rightly interpreted, 
sve often used in a very wrong way as a means for the investi- 
gation of the psychological nature of affective processes. This 
has in turn led to a classification of emotions based entirely 
«m their physical characteristics, and the strange theory has 
‘ sained adherence that emotions are nothing but the results of 
expressive movements. The emotion of sorrow, for example, is 
regarded as made up entirely of the sensations that come from 
the mimetic movements of weeping. In a somewhat more mod- 
erate way the attempt has been made to use the expressive 
movements as general characteristics whose presence may be
-P-A-G-E-193
§ 13. Emotions. 175 
regarded as a mark to distinguish emotions from feelings. This 
is, however, unjustifiable since similar physical expressive phenom- 
ena appear even for the feelings, and the minor circumstance 
that these symptoms are in one case externally more or less 
clearly. visible, evidently can not be decisive. ‘The essential dif- 
ference between emotion and feeling is psychological. The emotion 
is made up of a series of feelings united into a unitary whole. 
Expressive movements are the results, on the physical side, of 
the increase which the preceding parts of such a series have 
on those sucteeding. It follows directly that the deciding 
characteristics for the classification of emotions must be psycho- 
logical (cf. inf. 9). 
7. Though important constituents of emotions, the phy- 
sical concomitants stand in no constant relation to the 
psychical quality of the same. This holds especially for the 
effects on pulse and respiration, but also for the pantomimetic 
expressive movements of stronger emotions. It may some- 
times happen that emotions with very different, even oppo- 
site kinds of. affective contents, may belong to the same 
class so far as the accompanying physical phenomena are 
concerned. Thus, for example, joy and anger may be in 
like manner sthenic emotions. Joy accompanied by surprise 
may, on the contrary, present the appearance, on its physi- 
cal side, of an asthenic emotion. The general phenomena of 
innervation which give rise to the distinction between sthenic 
and asthenic, and rapid and sluggish emotions, do not show 
the character of affective contents of these emotions, but 
only the formal attributes of the intensity and rapidity of 
the feelings. This is clearly proved by the fact that differ- 
ences in involuntary innervation analogous to those which 
accompany the different emotions, may be produced by a 
mere succession of indifferent impressions, as, for example. 
by the strokes of a metronome. It is observed in such a 
case that especially the respiration tends to adapt itself to
-P-A-G-E-194
176 II. Psychical Compounds. 
the faster or slower rate of the strokes, becoming more rapid 
when the rapidity of the metronome increases. As a rule, too, 
certain phases of respiration coincide with particular strokes. 
To be sure, the hearing of such an indifferent rhythm is 
not unattended by emotion. When the rate changes, we ob- 
serve at first a quiet, then a sthenic, and finally when the 
rapidity is greatest an asthenic emotion. Still, the emotions 
in this case have to a certain extent a mere formal charac- 
ter; they exhibit a great indefiniteness in their contents. 
This indefiniteness disappears only. when we think into them 
concrete emotions of like formal attributes. This is very 
easy, and is the condition of the great utility of rhythmical 
impressions for describing and producing emotions. All that 
is necessary to arouse an emotion in all its fulness, is a 
mere hint of qualitative affective content, such as it is pos- 
sible to give in music through the clangs of a musical com- 
position. 
7a. It follows from this relation of the physical effects to 
the psychical content of emotions, that the former can never be 
put in the place of the psychological observation of the emo- 
tions. They are general symptoms, but of such equivocal char- 
acter that, though they are of great value when connected with 
introspection controlled by experimental methods, alone they have 
no value whatever. They are especially useful as checks for 
experimental introspection. ‘The principle that the observation 
of psychical processes which present themselves in the natural 
course of life is entirely inadequate, holds especially for the 
emotions. In the first place, emotions come to the psychologist 
by chance, at moments when he is not in a condition to subject 
them to scientific analysis; and secondly, in the case of strong 
emotions whose causes are real we are least of all able to ob- 
serve ourselves with exactness. This can be done much more 
successfully when we arouse in ourselves voluntarily a particular 
emotional state. In such a case, however, it is not possible to 
estimate how nearly the subjectively aroused emotion agrees in
-P-A-G-E-195
  
§ 13. Emotions. 177 
intensity and mode of occurrence with one of like character due 
to external circumstances. For this purpose the simultaneous 
investigation of the physical effects, especially of those most re- 
moved from the influence of the will, those on the pulse and 
respiration, furnishes a check for introspection. For when the 
psychological quality of emotions is alike, we may infer from their 
like physical effects that their formal attributes also agree. 
8. Both in natural and in voluntarily aroused emotions, 
the physical concomitants have, besides their symptomatical 
significance, the important psychological attribute of inten- 
sifying the emotion. This attribute is due to the fact that 
the excitation or inhibition of certain particular groups of 
muscles is accompanied by inner tactual sensations which 
produce certain sense-feelings. These feelings unite with the 
other affective contents of the emotion and increase its in- 
tensity. From the heart, respiratory organs, and blood-vessels 
we have such feelings only for strong emotions, where they 
may indeed be very intense. On the other hand, even 
in moderate emotions the state of greater or less tension of 
the muscles exercises an influence on the affective state and 
thereby on the emotion. 
9. The great number of factors that must be taken into 
consideration for the investigation of emotions renders a 
psychological analysis of the single forms impossible. This 
is all the more so because each of the numerous distin- 
guishing names marks off a whole class, within which there is 
a great variety of special forms, including in turn an end- 
less number of single cases of the most various modifications. 
All we can do is to take a general survey of the fundamen- 
tal forms of emotions. The general principles of division 
here employed must, of course, be psychological, that is, such 
as are derived from the immediate attributes of the emotions 
themselves, for the accompanying physical phenomena have 
Wowpz, Psychology. 12
-P-A-G-E-196
178 II. Psychieal Compounds. 
only a symptomatical value and are even then, as noted 
above, equivocal in character. 
Three such psychological principles of classification may 
be made the basis for the discrimination of emotions: 1) ac- 
cording to the quality of the feelings entering into the 
emotions, 2) according to the intensity of these feelings, 
3) according to the form of occurrence, which is conditioned 
by the character and rate of the affective changes. 
10. On the basis of quality we may distinguish certain 
fundamental emotional forms corresponding to the chief af- 
fective directions distinguished before (p. 83). This gives 
us pleasurable and unpleasurable, exciting and depressing, 
straining and relaxing emotions. It must be noted, however, 
that because of their more composite character the emotions 
are always, even more than the feelings, mixed forms. Generally 
only a single affective direction can be called the primary 
tendency for a particular emotion. There are affective ele- 
ments belonging to other directions, that enter in as secondary 
elements. Their secondary character usually appears in the 
fact that under different conditions various sub-forms of the 
primary emotion may arise. Thus, for example, joy is pri- 
marily a pleasurable emotion. Ordinarily it is also exciting, 
since it intensifies the feelings, but when the feelings are too 
strong, it becomes a depressing emotion. Sorrow is an un- 
pleasurable emotion, generally of a depressing character; when 
the intensity of the feelings becomes somewhat greater, how- 
ever, it may become exciting, and when the intensity be- 
comes maximal, it passes again into very marked depression. 
Anger is much more emphatically exciting and unpleasant 
in its predominant characteristics, but when the inten- 
sity of the feelings becomes greater, as when it develops 
into rage, it may become depressing. Thus, exciting and 
depressing tendencies are always mere secondary qualities
-P-A-G-E-197
  § 13. Emotions. 179 
connected with pleasurable and unpleasurable emotions. Feel- 
ings of strain and relaxation, on the contrary, may more fre- 
quently be the chief, or at least the primary components of 
emotions. Thus, in expectation, the feeling of strain peculiar 
to this state is the primary element of the emotion. When 
the feeling develops into an emotion, it may easily be asso- 
ciated with unpleasurable feelings which are according to 
circumstances either exciting or depressing. In the case of 
rhythmical impressions or movements there arise from the 
alternation of feelings of strain with those of relaxation 
pleasurable emotions which may be either exciting or depressing 
according to the character of the rhythm. When they are 
depressing we may even have unpleasurable feelings inter- 
mingled with them, or they may all be of this kind, espe- 
cially when other affective elements cooperate, for example 
feelings of clang or harmony. 
11. Language has paid the most attention in its devel- 
opment of names for emotions to the qualitative side of 
feelings, and among these qualities particularly to pleasurable 
and unpleasurable. These names may be divided into three 
classes. First we have those of emotions that are szbjec- 
tively distinguished, chiefly through the nature of the affec- 
tive state itself, such as joy and sorrow and, as subforms of 
sorrow in which either depressing, straining, or relaxing ten- 
dencies of the feeling are also exhibited, sadness, care, grief, 
and fright. Secondly, there are names of objective emotions 
referring to some external object, such as delight and dis- 
pleasure and, as subforms of the latter in which, as above, 
various tendencies unite, annoyance, resentment, anger, and 
rage. Thirdly, we have names of objective emotions that refer 
rather to outer events not expected until the future, such 
as hope and fear and, as modifications of the latter, worry 
and anxiety. They are combinations of feelings of strain 
12* 
 
-P-A-G-E-198
180 IT. Psychical Compounds. 
with pleasurable and unpleasurable feelings and, in different 
ways, with exciting and depressing tendencies as well. 
Obviously language has produced a much greater variety 
of names for unpleasurable emotions than for pleasurable. In 
fact, observation renders it probable that unpleasurable emo- 
tions exhibit a greater variety of typical forms of occurrence 
and that their different forms are really more numerous. 
12. On the basis of the intensity of the feelings we may 
distinguish weak and strong emotions. These concepts, de- 
rived from the psychical properties of the feelings, do not 
coincide with those of sthenic and asthenic emotions, based 
upon the physical concomitants, for the relation of the psy- 
chological categories to the psycho-physical is dependent not 
only on the intensity of the feelings, but on their quality 
as well. Thus, weak and moderately strong pleasurable 
emotions are always sthenic, while, on the contrary, unpleas- 
urable emotions become asthenic after a longer duration, 
even when they are of a low degree of intensity, as, for 
example, care and anxiety. Finally, the strongest emotions, 
such as fright, worry, rage, and even excessive joy, are always 
asthenic. The discrimination of the psychical intensity of 
emotions is accordingly of subordinate significance, especially 
since emotions that agree in all other respects, may not only 
have different degrees of intensity at different times, but may 
on the same occasion vary from moment to moment. Then 
too, since this variation from moment to moment is essen- 
tially determined by the sense-feelings that arise from the 
accompanying physical phenomena, in accordance with the 
principle of the intensification of emotions discussed above 
‘p. 177), it is obvious that the originally physiological antith- 
esis of sthenic and asthenic often has a more decisive in- 
fluence even on the psychological character of the emotion 
than the primary psychical intensity itself.
-P-A-G-E-199
  
§ 18. Emotions. 181 
13. The third distinguishing characteristic of emotions, 
the form of occurrence, is more important. Here we distin- 
guish three classes. First, there are sudden, irruptive emo- 
tions, such as surprise, astonishment, disappointment, fright, 
and rage. They all reach their maximum very rapidly and 
then gradually sink to a quiet affective state. Secondly, we 
have gradually arising emotions, such as anxiety, doubt, 
care, mournfulness, expectation, and in many cases joy, 
anger, worry. These rise to their maximum gradually and 
sink in the same way. As a third form and at the same 
time a modification of the class just mentioned we have 
intermittent emotions, in which several periods of rise and 
fall follow one another alternately. All emotions of long 
duration belong here. Thus, especially joy, anger, mournful- 
ness, and the most various forms of gradually arising emo- 
tions, come in waves and often permit a distinction between 
periods of increasing and those of decreasing emotional in- 
tensity. The sudden, irruptive emotions, on the contrary, 
are seldom intermittent. This happens only in cases in which 
the emotion may also belong to the second class. Such 
emotions of a very changeable form of occurrence are, for ex- 
ample, joy and anger. They may sometimes be sudden and 
irruptive. In this case, to be sure, anger generally becomes 
rage. Or they may gradually rise and fall; they are then 
generally of the intermittent type. In their psycho-physical 
concomitants, the sudden irruptive emotions are all asthenic, 
those gradually arising may be either sthenic or asthenic. 
13a. The form of occurrence, then, however characteristic 
it may be in single cases, is just as little a fixed criterion for the 
psychological classification of emotions as is the intensity of 
the feelings. Obviously such a classification can be based only 
on the quality of the affective contents, while intensity and form 
of occurrence may furnish the means of subdivision. The way
-P-A-G-E-200
  182 Il. Psychical Compounds. 
in which these conditions are connected with one another and 
with the accompanying physical phenomena and through these 
with secondary sense-feelings, shows the emotions to be most 
highly composite psychical processes which are therefore in single 
vases exceedingly variable. A classification that is in any degree 
exhaustive must, therefore, subdivide such varying emotions as 
joy, anger, fear, and anxiety into their subforms, according to 
their modes of occurrence, the intensity of their component feel- 
ings, and finally according to their physical concomitants which 
are dependent on both the psychical factors mentioned. Thus, 
for example, we may distinguish a strong, a weak, and a vari- 
able form of anger, a sudden, a gradually arising, and an inter- 
mittent form of its occurrence, and finally a sthenic, asthenic, 
and a mixed form of its expressive movements. For the psy- 
ehological explanation, an account of the causal interconnection 
of the single forms in each particular case is much more im- 
portant than this mere classification. In giving such an account, 
we have in the case of every emotion to do with two factors: 
tirst, the quality and intensity of the component feelings, and 
second, the rapidity of the succession of these feelings. The 
first factor determines the general character of the emotion, the 
second its intensity in part and more especially its form of oc- 
vurence, while both together determine its physical accompani- 
iments and the psycho-physical changes resulting from the sense- 
teelings connected with these accompanying phenomena (p. 177). 
It is for this very reason that the physical concomitants are as 
a rule to be called psycho-physical. The expressions “psycholog- 
ial” and “psycho-physical” should not, however, be regarded 
as absolute opposites in this case, where we have to do merely 
with symptoms of emotion. We speak of psychological emotional 
phenomena when we mean those that do not show any imme- 
diately perceptible physical symptoms, even when such symptoms 
van be demonstrated with exact apparatus (as, for example, chan- 
ges in the pulse and in respiration). On the other hand we 
speak of psycho-physical phenomena in the case of those which 
van be immediately recognized as two-sided.

  § 14. Volitional Processes. 183 
§ 14. VOLITIONAL PROCESSES. 
1. Every emotion, made up, as it is, of a series of in- 
terrelated affective processes having a unitary character, may 
terminate in one of two ways. It may give place to the 
ordinary variable and relatively unemotional course of feelings. 
Such affective processes that fade out without any special 
result, constitute the emotions in the strict sense as discussed 
in the last paragraph. The process may, in a second class 
of cases, pass into a sudden change in sensational and 
affective content, which brings the emotion to an instantan- 
eous close; such changes in the sensational and affective 
state which are prepared for by an emotion and bring about 
its sudden end, are called volitional acts. The emotion itself 
together with its result is a volitional process. 
A volitional process is thus related to an emotion as a 
process of a higher stage, in the same way that an emotion 
is related to a feeling. Volitional act is the name of only 
one part of the process, that part which distinguishes a 
volition from an emotion. The way to the development of 
volitions out of emotions is prepared by those emotions in 
connection with which external pantomimetic movements 
(p. 173) appear. These movements appear chiefly at the end 
of the process and generally hasten its completion; this is 
especially true of anger, but to some extent also of joy, 
care, etc. .Still, in these mere emotions, the changes in the 
train of ideas which are the immediate causes of the mo- 
mentary completion of the emotion in volitions, and ‘also the 
characteristic feelings attending these changes, are all wanting. 
This close interconnection of volitional acts with panto- 
mimetic movements necessarily leads us to look upon those 
volitions which end in certain bodily movements resulting 
from the preceding train of ideas and feelings, that is, those
-P-A-G-E-202
  184 IL. Psychical Compounds. 
ending in external volitional acts, as the earliest stages in 
the development of volitions. The so-called internal volitional 
acts. on the other hand, or those which close simply with 
effects on ideas and feelings, appear in every case to be 
products of a more highly developed intelligence. 
2. A volitional process that passes into an external act 
may be defined as an emotion which closes with a panto- 
mimetic movement that has, in addition to the characteristics 
belonging to all such movements and due to the quality and 
mtensity of the emotion, the special property of producing 
un external effect which removes the emotion itself. Such an 
etfect is not possible for all emotions, but only for those in 
which the very succession of component feelings produces 
feclings and ideas which are able to remove the preceding 
emotion. This is, of course, most commonly the case when 
the final result of the emotion is the direct opposite of the 
preceding feelings. The fundamental psychological condition 
for volitional acts is, therefore, the contrast between feelings, 
and the origin of the first volitions is most probably in all 
cases to be traced back to :unpleasurable feelings that arouse 
external movements whose results are contrasted pleasurable 
teelings. The seizing of food to remove hunger, the struggle 
against enemies to appease the feeling of revenge, and other 
sunilar processes are original volitional processes of this kind. 
The emotions coming from sense-feelings, and the most wide- 
spread social emotions, such as love, hate, anger, and re- 
venge, are thus both for men and animals the common origin 
of will. A volition is distinguished in such cases from an emo- 
tion only by the fact that the former has added to its emo- 
tional components an external act that gives rise to feelings 
which, through contrast with the feelings contained in the 
emotion, bring the emotion itself to an end. The execution 
of the volitional act may then lead directly, as was originally  
-P-A-G-E-203
  § 14, Volitional Processes. 185 
always the case, or indirectly through an emotion of con- 
trasted affective content, into the ordinary quiet flow of 
feelings. ‘ 
3. The richer the ideational and affective contents of ex- 
perience, the greater the variety of the emotions and the 
wider the sphere of volitions. There is no feeling or emotion 
that does not in some way prepare for a volitional act or 
at least have some part in such a preparation. All feelings. 
even those of a relatively indifferent character, contain in 
some degree an effort towards or away from some end. This 
effort may be very general and aimed merely at the main- 
tenance or removal of the present affective state. While 
volitions appear as the most complex form of affective pro- 
cesses, presupposing all others — that is, feelings and emotions 
— as their components, still, we must not overlook the fact 
that single feelings continually appear which do not unite to 
form emotions, and emotions’ appear which do not end in voli- 
tional acts. In the total interconnection of psychical processes 
however, these three stages condition one another and form 
the related parts of a single process which is complete only 
when it becomes a volition. In this sense a feeling may he 
thought of as the beginning of a volition, or a volition 
may be thought of as a composite affective process, and an 
emotion may be regarded as an intermediate stage between 
the two. 
4. The single feelings in an emotion that closes with a 
volitional act are usually far from being of equal importance. 
Certain ones among them, together with their related ideas, 
are prominent as those which are most important in pre- 
paring for the act. Those combinations of ideas and feeling~ 
which in our subjective apprehension of the volition are the 
immediate antecedents of the act, are called motives of vo- 
lition. Every motive may be divided into an ideational and
-P-A-G-E-204
  186 II. Psychical Compounds. 
an affective component. The first we may call the moving 
reason, the second the impelling force of action. When a 
beast of prey seizes his victim, the moving reason is the 
sight of the same, the impelling force may be either the 
unpleasurable feeling of hunger or the race-hate aroused by 
the sight. The reason for a criminal murder may be theft, 
removal of an enemy, or some such idea, the impelling force 
the feeling of want, hate, revenge, or envy. 
‘When the emotions are of composite character, the rea- 
sons and impelling forces are generally mixed, often to so 
vreat an extent that it would be difficult for the author of 
the act himself to decide which was the leading motive. 
This is due to the fact that the impelling forces of a voli- 
tional act combine, just as the elements of a composite feel- 
ing do, to form a unitary whole in which all other impulses 
are subordinated under a single predominating one; the 
feelings of like direction strengthening and accelerating the 
effect, those of opposite direction weakening it. In the com- 
hinations of ideas and feelings which we call motives, the 
deciding importance in preparing for the act of will belongs 
to the feelings, that is, to the impelling forces, rather than 
to the ideas. This follows from the very fact that feelings 
are integral components of the volitional process itself, while 
the ideas are of influence only indirectly, through their con- 
nections with the feelings. The assumption of a volition 
arising from pure intellectual considerations, of a decision 
opposed to the inclinations expressed in the feelings, is a 
psychological contradiction in itself. It rests upon the ab- 
stract concept of a transcendental will absolutely distinct 
from actual psychical volitions. 
5. The combination of a number of motives, that is, of 
ideas and feelings which are distinguished in the composite 
train of emotions to which they belong, as those determining
-P-A-G-E-205
  
§ 14. Volitional Processes. 187 
the discharge of the act, furnish the essential conditions for 
the development of will, and also for the discrimination of 
the single forms of volitional action. 
The simplest case of volition is that in which a single 
feeling in an emotion of suitable constitution, together with 
its accompanying idea, becomes a motive and brings the pro- 
cesses to a close with its corresponding external movement. 
Such volitional processes determined by a single motive, may 
be called simple volitions. The movements in which they 
terminate are often designated mpulsive acts. In popular 
parlance, however, this definition of impulse by the simplic- 
ity of the motive, is not sufficiently adhered to. Another 
element, namely, the character of the feeling that acts as 
impelling force, is here usually brought in. All:acts that are 
determined by sense-feelings, especially common feelings, are 
generally called impulsive acts without regard to whether only 
a single motive or a plurality of motives is operative. This 
basis of discrimination is psychologically inappropriate and 
the complete separation of impulsive from volitional acts as 
a specifically distinct kind of psychical processes, which fol- 
lows very naturally from it, is entirely unjustifiable. 
By impulsive act, then, we mean a simple volitional act, 
that is, one resulting from a single motive, without refer- 
ence to the position of this motive in the series of affective 
and ideational processes. Impulsive action, thus defined, must 
necessarily be the starting point for the development of all 
volitional acts, even though it may continue to appear along 
with the complex volitional acts. To be sure, the earliest 
impulsive acts are those which come from sense-feeling. In 
this sense most of the acts of animals are impulsive, but 
such impulsive acts appear continually in the case of man, 
partly as the results of simple sense-emotions, partly as the 
 
-P-A-G-E-206
  188 II. Psychical Compounds. 
products of the habitual execution of certain volitional acts 
which were originally determined by complex motives. 
6. When several feelings and ideas in the same emotion 
tend to produce external action, and when those components 
of an emotional train which have become motives tend at. 
the same time toward different external ends, whether related 
or antagonistic, then there arises out of the simple act a 
complex volitional process. In order to distinguish this from 
the impulsive acts that precede it in the line of development, 
we call it a voluntary act. 
Voluntary and impulsive acts have in common the char- 
acteristic of proceeding from single motives, or from com- 
plexes of motives that have fused together and operate as a 
single wnequivocal impelling force. They differ in the fact 
that in voluntary acts the decisive motive has risen to pre- 
dominance from among a number of simultaneous and antag- 
onistic motives. When a clearly perceptible strife between 
these antagonistic motives precedes the act, we call the vo- 
lition by the particular name selective act, and the process 
preceding it a choice. The predominance of one over other 
simultaneous motives can be understood only when we pre- 
suppose such a strife in every case. But we perceive this 
strife now clearly, now obscurely, and now not at all. Only 
in the first case can we speak of a selective act in the 
proper sense. The distinction between voluntary and select- 
ive acts is by no means hard and fast. Still, in ordinary 
voluntary acts the psychical state is more like that in im- 
pulsive acts, while the difference between the latter and select- 
ive acts is clearly recognizable. 
7. The psychical process immediately preceding the act, 
in which the final motive suddenly gains the ascendency, is 
called in the case of voluntary acts resolution, in the case 
of selective acts decision. The first word indicates merely
-P-A-G-E-207
  
§ 14, Volittonal Processes. 189 
that action is to be carried out in accordance with some 
consciously adopted motive; the second implies that several 
courses of action have been presented as possible and that 
a choice has finally been made. 
In contrast to the first stages of a volition, which can 
not be clearly distinguished from an ordinary emotional pro- 
cess, the last stages are absolutely characteristic. They are 
especially marked by accompanying feelings that never appear 
anywhere but in volitions, and must therefore be regarded 
as the specific elements peculiar to will. These feelings are 
first of all those of resolution and of decision. The latter 
differs from the former only in its greater intensity. They 
are both exciting and relaxing feelings, and may be united 
under various circumstances with pleasurable or unpleasur- 
able factors. The relatively greater intensity of the feeling 
of decision is probably due to its contrast with the preced- 
ing feeling of doubt which attends the wavering between 
different motives. Its opposition to this doubt gives the 
feeling of relaxation a greater intensity. At the moment 
when the volitional act begins, the feelings of resolution and 
decision give place to the specific feeling of activity, which 
has its sensational substratum, in the case of external voli- 
tional acts, in the inner tactual sensation accompanying the 
movement. This feeling of activity is clearly exciting in its 
character, and is, according to the special motives of the 
volition, accompanied now by pleasurable, now by unpleas- 
urable elements, which may in turn vary in the course of 
the act and alternate with one another. As a total feeling, 
this feeling of activity is a rising and falling temporal pro- 
cess extending through the whole act and finally passing 
into the most various feelings, such as those of fulfilment, 
satisfaction, or disappointment, or into the feelings and emo- 
tions -connected with the special result of the act. Taking  
-P-A-G-E-208
  190 II. Psychical Compounds. 
the process as seen in voluntary and selective acts as complete 
volitional acts, we must distinguish impulsive acts from them 
essentially by the absence of the antecedent feelings of re- 
solution and decision. The feeling connected with the motive 
passes in the latter case directly into that of activity, and 
then into those which correspond to the effect of the act. 
8. The transition from simple to complex volitional acts 
brings with it a number of other changes which are of great 
importance for the development of will. The first of these 
changes is to be found in the fact that the emotions which 
introduce the volitions lose their intensity more and more, 
as a result of the counteraction of different mutually inhibit- 
ing feelings, so that finally a volitional act may result from 
an apparently unemotional affective state. To be sure, emo- 
tion is never entirely wanting; in order that the motive 
which arises in an ordinary train of feelings may bring 
about a resolution or decision, it must always be connected 
with some degree of emotional excitement. This can, how- 
ever, be so weak and transient that we overlook it. We do 
this the more easily the more we are inclined to unite a 
short emotion of this kind, attending merely the rise and 
action of the motive, with the resolution and execution in 
the stngle concept of a volitional act. This weakening of the 
cmotions results mainly from the combinations of psychical 
processes which we call intellectual development and of which 
we shall treat more fully in the discussion of the interconnec- 
ton of psychical compounds (§ 17). Intellectual processes 
can, indeed, never do away with emotions; they are, on the 
contrary, in many cases the sources of new and character- 
istic emotions. A volition entirely without emotion, deter- 
mined by a purely intellectual motive, is, as already remarked 
p. 186), a psychological impossibility. Still, intellectual de- 
velopment exercises beyond a doubt a moderating influence
-P-A-G-E-209
  
§ 14. Volitional Processes. 191 
on emotions, particularly on those that prepare the way for 
volitional acts wherever intellectual motives enter into them. 
This may be due partly to the counteraction of the feelings 
which is generally present, partly to the slow development 
of intellectual motives, for in general emotions are the 
stronger the more rapidly their component feelings rise. 
9. Connected with this moderation of the emotional com- 
ponents of volitions under the influence of intellectual motives 
is still another change. It consists in the fact that the act 
which closes the volition is not an external movement. The 
effect which removes the exciting emotion is itself a psychical 
process that does not show itself directly through any ex- 
ternal symptom whatever. Such an effect which is imper- 
ceptible for objective observation is called an internal voli- 
tional act. The transition from external to internal volitional 
acts is so bound up with intellectual development that the 
very character of the intellectual processes themselves are 
to be explained to a great extent by the influence of voli- 
tions on the train of ideas (§ 15, 9). The act that closes 
the volition in such a case is some change in the train of 
ideas, which follows the preceding motives as the result of 
some resolution or decision. The feelings that accompany 
these acts of immediate preparation, and the feeling of ac- 
tivity connected with the change itself, agree entirely with 
those observed in the case of external volitional acts. Fur- 
thermore, action is followed by more or less marked feelings 
of satisfaction, of removal of preceding emotional and affect- 
ive strain, so that obviously the only difference between 
these special volitions connected with the intellectual devel- 
opment and the earlier forms, is to be found in the fact 
that here the final effect of the volition oes not show itself 
in an external bodily movement. 
Still, we may have a bodily movement as the secondary

result of an internal volitional act, when the resolution refers 
to an external act to be executed at some later time. In such 
a case the act itself always results from a special external 
volition whose decisive motives come from the preceding in- 
ternal volition, but which we must consider as a new process 
distinct from the earlier. Thus, for example, the formation 
of a resolution to execute an act in the future under certain 
expected conditions, is an internal volition, while the later 
performance of the act is an external action different from 
the first, but requiring it as a necessary antecedent. It is 
evident that where an external volitional act arises from a 
decision after a conflict among the motives, we have a tran- 
sition in which it is impossible to distinguish clearly be- 
tween the two kinds of volition, namely that consisting 
in a single unitary process and that made up of two such 
processes, an internal and an external. In such a transitional 
form, if the decision is at all separated in time from the 
act itself, it may be regarded as an internal volitional act 
preparatory to the execution. 
10. These two changes connected with the development 
of will, namely, the moderation of emotions and the render- 
ing independent of internal volitions, are changes of a pro- 
gressive order. In contrast with these there is a third process 
or one of retrogradation. When complex volitions with the 
same iotive are often repeated, the conflict between the 
motives grows less intense; the opposing motives that were 
overcome in earlier cases grow weaker and finally disappear 
entirely. The complex act has then passed into a simple, 
or impulsive act. This retrogradation of complex volitional 
processes into impulsive processes shows clearly the utter 
inappropriateness of the limitation of the concept “impul- 
sive” to acts of will arising from sense-feelings. As a result 
of the gradual elimination of opposing motives, there are

intellectual, moral, and aesthetic, as well as simple sensuous, 
impulsive acts. 
This retrogradation is but one step in a process that 
unites all the external acts of a living being, both the voli- 
tional acts and tlie automatic reflex movements. When the 
habituating practice of certain acts is carried further, the 
determining motives finally become, even in impulsive’ acts, 
weaker and more transient. The external stimulus origi- 
nally aroused a strongly affective idea which operated as a 
motive, but now it causes the discharge of the act before it 
can be apprehended as an idea. In this way the impulsive 
movement finally becomes an automatic movement. The midre 
often this automatic movement is repeated, the easier it, in 
turn, becomes, even when the stimulus is not sensed, as, for 
example, in deep sleep or during complete diversion of the 
attention. The movement now appears as a pure physiological 
reflex, and the volitional process has become a simple reflex 
process. 
This gradual reduction of volitional to mechanical pro- 
cesses, which depends essentially on the elimination of all 
the elements between the physical beginning and end of the 
act, may take place either in the case of movements that 
were originally impulsive or in that of movements which 
have secondarily become such through the retrogradation of 
voluntary acts. It is not improbable that all the reflex move- 
ments of both animals and men originate in this way. As 
evidence for this we have, besides the reduction of volitional 
acts to pure mechanical processes through practice, as de- 
scribed above, also the appropriate character of reflexes, which 
points to the presence at some time of a purposive idea as 
motive. Furthermore, the circumstance that the movements 
of the lowest animals are all evidently simple volitional 
acts, not reflexes, tells for the same view, so that here

too there is no justification for the assumption frequently 
made that acts of will have been developed from reflex 
movements. Finally, we can most easily explain from this 
point of view the facts mentioned in § 13 (p. 172), that 
expressive movements may belong to any one of the forms 
possible in the scale of external acts. Obviously the simplest 
movements are impulsive acts, while many complicated 
pantomimetic movements probably came originally from 
voluntary acts which passed first into impulsive and then 
into reflex movements. Observed phenomena make it necessary 
to assume that the retrogradations that begin in the in- 
dividual life are gradually carried further through the trans- 
mission of acquired dispositions, so that certain acts which 
were originally voluntary may appear in later descendants 
from the first as impulsive or reflex movements (§ 19 and 
§ 20). 
10a. For reasons similar to those given in the case of emo- 
tions, the observation of volitional processes that come into ex- 
perience by chance, is an inadequate and easily misleading method 
for establishing the actual facts in the case. Wherever internal 
or external volitional acts are performed in meeting either the 
theoretical or practical demands of life, our interest is too much 
taken up in the action itself to allow us at the same time to 
observe with exactness the psychical processes that are going on. 
In the theories of volition given by older psychologists — theories 
that very often cast their shadows in the science of to-day — we 
have a clear reflection of the undeveloped state of the methods 
of psychological observation. External acts of will are the only 
ones in the whole sphere of volitional processes that force them- 
selves emphatically on the attention of the observer. As a result 
the tendency was to limit the concept will to external volitional 
acts, and thus not only to neglect entirely the whole sphere so 
important for the higher development of will, namely, internal 
volitional acts, but also to pay very little attention to the com- 
ponents of the volition that are antecedent to the external acts, 
 
-P-A-G-E-213
§ 14, Volitional Processes. 195 
or at most only to the more striking ideational components of the 
motive. . It followed that the close genetic interconnection be- 
tween impulsive and voluntary acts was not observed, and that 
the former were regarded as not belonging to will, but as closely 
related to reflexes. Will was thus limited to the voluntary and 
selective actions. Furthermore, the one-sided consideration of the 
ideational components of the motives led to a.complete oversight 
of the development of volitional acts from emotions, and the 
singular idea found acceptance that volitional acts are not the 
products of antecedent motives and of psychical conditions which 
act upon these motives and bring one of them into the ascendency, 
but that volition is a process apart from the motives and in- 
dependent of them, a product of a metaphysical volitional faculty. 
This faculty was, on the ground of the limitation of the concept 
volition to voluntary acts, even defined as the choosing faculty 
of the mind, or as its faculty for preferring one from among the 
different motives that influence it. ‘Thus, instead of deriving 
volition from the antecedent psychical conditions, the final result 
alone, the volitional act, was used to build up a general concept 
which was called will and this class-concept was treated in 
accordance with the faculty-theory as a first cause from which 
all concrete volitional acts arise. 
It was only a modification of this abstract theory when 
Schopenhauer and, following him, many modern psychologists and 
philosophers declared that volition in itself is an “unconscious” 
occurrence which comes to consciousness only in its result, the 
volitional act. In this case, obviously, the inadequate observation 
of the volitional process preceding the act, has led to the assertion 
that no such process exists. Here, again, the whole variety of con- 
crete volitional processes is supplanted by the concept of a single 
unconscious will, and the result for psychology is the same as 
before: in place of a comprehension of concrete psychical processes 
and their combination, an abstract concept is set up and then 
erroneously looked upon as a general cause. 
Modern psychology and eyen experimental psychology is still 
to a great extent under the ban of this deep-rooted abstract doc- 
trine. of will. In denying from the first the possibility of ex- 
plaining an act from the concrete psychical causality of the 
antecedent volitional process, it leaves as the only characteristic

196 I. Psychical Compounds. 
of an act of will the sum of the sensations that accompany the 
external act, and may immediately precede it as pale memory- 
images in cases where the act has often been repeated. The 
physical excitations in the nervous system are regarded as the 
causes of the act. Here, then, the question of the causality is 
taken out of psychology and given over to physiology instead of 
to metaphysics, as in the theory discussed before. In reality, 
however, it is here too lost in metaphysics in attempting to 
cross to physiology. For physiology must, as an empirical science, 
abandon the attempt to give a complete causal explanation of a 
complex volitional act from its antecedents, not only for the 
present, but for all time, because this leads to the problem of 
an infinite succession. The only possible basis for such a theory 
is, therefore, the principle of materialistic metaphysics, that the so- 
called material processes are all that make up the reality of things 
and that psychical processes must accordingly be explained from 
material processes. But it is an indispensable principle of psy- 
chology as an empirical science, that it shall investigate the facts of 
psychical processes as they are presented in immediate experience, 
and that it shall not examine their interconnections from points 
of view that are entirely foreign to them (§ 1 and p. 17, sq,). 
It is impossible to find out how a volition proceeds in any other 
way than by following it exactly as it is presented to us in im- 
mediate experience. Here, however, it is not presented as an 
abstract concept, but as a concrete single volition. Of this par- 
ticular volition, too, we know nothing except what is immediately 
perceptible in the process. We can know nothing of an un- 
conscious or, what amounts to the same thing for psychology, a 
material process which is not immediately perceived but merely 
assumed hypothetically on the basis of metaphysical presuppositions. 
Such. metaphysical assumptions are obviously merely devices to 
cover up an incomplete or entirely wanting psychological obser- 
vation. The psychologist who pays attention to only the ter- 
mination of the whole volitional process, will very easily hit 
upon the thought that the immediate cause of volition is some 
unconscious immaterial or material agent. 
11. The exact observation of volitional processes is, for 
the reasons given above, impossible in the case of volitional
-P-A-G-E-215
§ 14. Volitional Processes. 197 
acts that come naturally in the course ‘of life; the only way 
in which a thorough psychological investigation can be made, 
is, therefore, that of experimental observation. To be sure, 
we can not produce volitional acts of every kind at will, 
but we must limit ourselves to the observation of certain 
processes which can be easily influenced through external 
means and which terminate in external acts. The experiments 
which serve this purpose are the so-called reaction-experi- 
ments. They may be described in their essentials as follows. 
A simple or complex volitional process is incited by an ex- 
ternal sense-stimulus and then after the occurrence of certain 
psychical processes which serve in part as motives, the voli- 
tion is brought to an end by a motor reaction. 
Reaction-experiments have a second and more general 
significance besides that mentioned. They furnish means ‘for 
the measurement of the rate of certain psychical and psycho- 
physical processes. In fact, such measurements are always 
made in these experiments. The primary significance of the 
experiments, however, consists in the fact that each one 
includes a volition and that it is therefore possible, in this 
way, by means of introspection to follow with exactness the 
succession of psychical processes in such a volition, and at 
the same time, by the deliberate variation of the conditions, 
to influence this succession in a systematic manner. 
The simplest reaction-experiment that can be made is 
as follows. A short interval (2—3 sec.) after a signal that 
serves to concentrate the attention, an external stimulus is 
allowed to act on some sense-organ. At the moment when 
the stimulus is perceived, a movement that has been 
determined upon and prepared before, as, for example, a 
movement of the hand, is executed. The psychological con- 
ditions in this experiment correspond essentially to those 
of a simple volition. The sensible impression serves as a  
-P-A-G-E-216
198 II. Psychical Compounds. 
simple motive, and this is to be followed invariably by a 
particular act. If now we measure objectively by means of 
either graphic or other chronometric apparatus, the interval 
that elapses between the action of the stimulus and the 
execution of the movement, it will be possible, by frequently 
repeated experiments of the same kind, to become thoroughly 
acquainted with the subjective processes that make up the 
whole reaction, while at the same time the results’ of the 
objective measurement will furnish a check for the constancy 
or possible variations in these subjective processes. This check 
is especially useful in those cases where some condition in 
the experiment and thereby the subjective course of the vo- 
lition itself is intentionally modified. 
Such a modification may, indeed, be introduced even in the 
simple form of the experiment just described, by varying the 
way in which the reactor prepares, before the appearance of the 
stimulus, for the execution of the act. When the expectation is 
directed toward the stimulus which is to serve as the motive, 
the form of reaction known as sensorial results. When, on the 
other hand, the preparatory expectation is directed toward 
the act to be executed in response to the motive, we have 
the so-called muscular reaction. In the first case the idea- 
tional factor of the expectation is a pale memory-image of 
the familiar sense-impression. When the period of prepara- 
tion is more extended, this image oscillates between alternating 
clearness and obscurity. The affective element is a feeling 
of expectation that oscillates in a similar manner and is 
connected with sensations of strain from the sense-organ to 
be affected, as, for example, with tension of the tympanum, 
or of the ocular muscles of accommodation and movement. 
In the second case, on the other hand, where the reaction 
is muscular, we may observe during the period of preparatory 
expectation a pale, wavering memory-image of the motor
-P-A-G-E-217
§ 14. Volitional Processes. 199 
organ that is to react (¢.g., the hand) together with strong 
sensations of strain in the same, and a fairly continuous 
feeling of expectation connected with these sensations. Sen- 
sorial reaction-time is on the average 0.210—0.290 sec. (the 
shortest time is for sound, the longest for light), with a 
mean variation of 0.020 sec. for the single observations. 
Muscular reaction-time is 0.120—0.190 sec., with a mean 
variation of 0.010 sec. The different values of the mean 
variation in the two cases are chiefly important as objective 
checks for the disctimination of these forms of reaction’). 
12. By introducing special conditions we may make sen- 
sorial and muscular reactions the starting points for the 
study of the development of volitions in two different direc- 
tions. Sensorial reactions furnish the means of passing from 
simple to complex volitions because we can in this case 
easily insert different psychical processes between the per- 
ception of the impression and the execution of the reaction. 
Thus we have a voluntary act of relatively simple character 
when we allow an act of cognition or discrimination to follow 
the perception of the impression and then let the move- 
ment depend on this second process. In this case not the 
immediate impression but the idea that results from the act 
of cognition or discrimination is the motive for the act to 
be performed. This motive is only one of a greater or 
smaller number of equally possible motives that could have 
come up in place of it; as a result the reaction-movement 
takes on the character of a voluntary act. In fact, we may 
1) The reaction-times for sensations of taste, smell, temperature, 
and pain are not reckoned in the figures given. They are all longer. 
The differences are, however, obviously to be attributed to pure phys- 
iological conditions (slow transmission of the stimulation to the 
nerve-endings, and in the case of pain slower central conduction), 
so that they are of no interest for psychology.
-P-A-G-E-218
200 II. Psychical Compounds. 
observe clearly the feeling of resolution antecedent to the 
act and also the feelings preceding that and connected with 
the perception of the impression. This is still more em- 
phatically the case, and the succession of ideational and 
affective processes is at the same time more complicated, 
when we bring in still another psychical process, as, for 
example, an association, to serve as the decisive motive for 
the execution of the movement. Finally, the voluntary pro- 
cess becomes one of choice when, in such experiments, the 
act is not merely influenced by a plurality of motives in 
such a way that several must follow one another before one 
determines the act, but when, in addition to that, one of a 
number of possible different acts is decided upon according 
to the motive presented. This takes place when preparations 
are made for different movements, for example, one with the 
right, another with the left hand, or one with each of the 
ten fingers, and the condition is prescribed for each move- 
ment that an impression of a particular quality shall serve 
as its motive, for example, the impression blue for the right 
hand, red for the left. 
13. Muscular reactions, on the contrary, may be used to 
follow out the retrogradation of volitional acts to reflex move- 
ment. In this form of reaction the preparatory expectation 
is directed entirely towards the external act, so that a 
voluntary inhibition or execution of the act in accordance 
with the special character of the impression, that is, a tran- 
sition from simple to complex acts of will, is in this case 
impossible. On the other hand, it is easy by practice so to 
habituate one’s self to the invariable connection of an im- 
pression and a particular movement, that the process of 
perception fades out more and more or takes place after 
the motor impulse, and finally the movement becomes just 
like a reflex movement. This reduction of volition to a
-P-A-G-E-219
  § 14. Volitional Processes. 201 
mechanical process, which in the case of sensorial reactions 
is never possible from the very nature of their conditions, 
shows itself in the shortening of the objective time to that 
observed for pure reflexes, and in the subjective coincidence 
in point of time of impression and reaction, while the char- 
acteristic feeling of resolution gradually disappears entirely. 
13a. The chronometric experiments familiar in experimental 
psychology under the name of “reaction-experiments”, are im- 
portant for two reasons: first, as aids in the analysis of volitional 
processes, and secondly, as means for the investigation of the 
temporal course of psychical processes in general. This twofold 
importance of reaction-experiments reflects the central importance 
of volitions. On the one hand, the simpler processes, feelings, 
emotions, and their related ideas, are components of a complete 
volition; on the other, all possible forms of the interconnection 
of psychical compounds may appear as components of a volition. 
Volitional processes are, consequently, an appropriate transition 
to the interconnection between psychical compounds to be dis- 
cussed in the next chapter. 
For a “reaction-experiment” which is to be the basis of an 
analysis of a volitional process or any of its component psychical 
processes, we must have first of all exact and sufficiently fine 
(reading with exactness to yyy sec.) chronometric apparatus 
(electric clock or graphic register). The apparatus must be so 
arranged that we can determine exactly the moment at which 
the stimulus acts and that at which the subject reacts. This 
can be accomplished by allowing the stimulus itself (sound, light, 
or tactual stimulus) to close an electric current that sets an 
electric clock, reading to zqyq sec., in motion, and then allow- 
ing the observer, by means of a simple movement of the hand 
which raises a telegraph-key, to break the current again at the 
moment in which he apprehends the stimulus. In this way we 
may measure simple reactions varied in different ways (sensorial 
and muscular reactions, reactions with or without preceding 
signals), or we may bring into the process various other psy- 
chical acts (discriminations, cognitions, associations, selective 
processes) which may be regarded either as motives for the volition  
-P-A-G-E-220
202 II. Psychical Compounds. 
or as components of the general interconnection of psychical 
compounds. A simple reaction always includes, along with the 
volitional process, purely physiological factors (conduction of the 
sensory excitation to the brain and of the motor excitation to the 
muscle). If, now, we insert further psychical processes (dis- 
criminations, cognitions, associations, acts of choice), a modification 
which can be made only when sensorial reactions are employed, 
the duration of clearly definable psychical processes may be gained 
by subtracting the interval found for simple reactions from those 
found for the compound reactions. In this way it has been 
determined that the time required for the cognition and for the 
discrimination of relatively simple impressions (colors, letters, 
short words) is 0.03 — 0.05"; the time for choice between two 
movements (right and left hand) is 0.06”, between ten movements 
the ten fingers) 0.4”, etc. As already remarked, the value of 
these figures is not their absolute magnitude, but rather their 
utility as checks for introspection, while at the same time we 
may apply this introspective observation to processes subject to 
conditions which are prescribed with exactness by means of ex- 
perimental methods and which may therefore be repeated at 
pleasure.

III. INTERCONNECTION OF PSYCHICAL 
COMPOUNDS. 
§ 15. CONSCIOUSNESS AND ATTENTION. 
1. Every psychical compound is composed of a number 
of psychical elements which do not usually all begin or end 
at exactly the same moment. As a result, the interconnection 
which unites the elements to a single whole always reaches 
beyond the individual compounds, so that different simulta- 
neous and successive compounds are united, though indeed 
somewhat more loosely. We call this interconnection of 
psychical compounds consciousness. 
Consciousness, accordingly, does not mean anything that 
exists apart from psychical processes, nor does it refer merely 
to the sum of these processes without reference to how they 
are related to one another. It expresses the general syn- 
thesis of psychical processes,’in which the single compounds 
are marked off as more intimate combinations. A state in 
which this interconnection is interrupted, as deep sleep or 
a faint, is called an unconscious state; and we speak of 
“disturbances of consciousness” when abnormal changes in 
the combination of psychical compounds arise, even though 
these compounds themselves show no changes whatever. 
Consciousness in this sense, as a comprehensive inter- 
connection of simultaneous and successive psychical processes, 
shows itself in experience first of all in the psychical life of
-P-A-G-E-222
  204 IIL. Interconnection of Psychical Compounds. 
the individual as individual consciousness. But we have an 
analogous interconnection in the combination of individuals, 
although it is limited to certain sides of mental life, so that 
we may further include under the more general concept con- 
sciousness the concepts of collective consciousness, of social 
consciousness, etc. For all these broader forms, however, the 
foundation is the individual consciousness, and it is to this 
that we will first turn our attention. (For collective conscious- 
ness see § 21, 14.) 
2. Individual consciousness stands under the same external 
conditions as psychical phenomena in general, for which it is, 
indeed, merely another expression, referring more particularly 
to the mutual relations of the components of these phenomena 
to one another. As the substratum for the manifestations 
of an individual consciousness we have in every case an in- 
dividual animal organism. In the case of men and similar 
higher animals the cerebral cortex, in the cells and fibres 
of which all the organs that stand in relation to psychical 
processes are represented, appears as the immediate organ 
of this consciousness. The complete interconnection of the 
cortical elements may be looked upon as the physiological 
correlate of the interconnection of psychical processes in 
consciousness, and the differentiation in the functions of 
different cortical regions as the physiological correlate of the 
great variety of single conscious processes. The differentia- 
tion of functions in the central organ is, indeed, always 
merely relative; every psychical compound requires the co- 
operation of numerous elements and many central regions. 
When the destruction of certain cortical regions produces 
definite disturbances in voluntary movements, or in sen- 
sations, or when it interferes which the formation of certain 
classes of ideas, it is perfectly justifiable to conclude that 
this region furnishes certain links in the chain of psychical 
 
-P-A-G-E-223
  
§ 15. Consciousness and Attention. 205 
elements that are indispensable for the processes in question. 
The assumptions often made on the basis of these phenom- 
ena, that there is in the brain a special organ for the 
faculties of speech and writing, or that visual, tonal, and 
verbal ideas are stored in special cortical cells, are not only 
the results of the grossest physiological misconceptions, but 
they are absolutely irreconcilable with the psychological anal- 
ysis of these functions. Psychologically regarded, these as- 
sumptions are nothing but modern revivals of that most 
unfortunate form of faculty-psychology known as phrenology. 
2a. The facts that have been discovered in regard to the 
localization of certain psycho-physical functions in the cortex, 
are derived partly from pathological and anatomical observations 
on men and partly from experiments on animals. They may be 
summed up as follows: 1) Certain cortical regions correspond to 
certain peripheral sensory and muscular regions. Thus, the cortex 
of the occipital lobe is connected with the retina, a part of the 
parietal lobe with the tactual surface, and a part of the temporal 
with the auditory organ. The central ganglia of special groups 
of muscles generally lie directly next to or between the sensory 
centres functionally related to them. 2) Certain complex disturb- 
ances have been demonstrated when certain cortical regions which 
are not directly connected with peripheral organs, but are inserted 
between other central regions, fail to carry out their functions. 
The only relation of this kind which has been proved with 
certainty, is that of a certain region of the temporal lobe to the 
functions of speech. The front part of this region is connected 
in particular with the articulation of words (its disturbance results 
in interference with motor coordination, so-called “ataxic aphasia”), 
the part further back is connected with the formation of word-ideas 
(its disturbance hinders sensorial coordination and produces in this 
way the so-called “amnesic aphasia”). It is also observed that these 
functions are as a rule confined entirely to the left temporal lobe 
and that generally apoplectic disturbances in the right lobe do not 
interfere with speech, while those in the left lobe do. Furthermore. 
in all these cases, in both simple and complex disturbances, there 
 
-P-A-G-E-224
  206 UI. Interconnection of Psychical Compounds. 
is usually a gradual restoration of the functions in the course of 
time. This is probably effected by the vicarious functioning of 
some, generally a neighboring cortical region in place of that 
which is disturbed (in disturbances of speech, perhaps it is the 
opposite, before untrained, side that comes into play). Localization 
of other complex psychical functions, such as processes of memory 
and association, has not yet been demonstrated with certainty. 
The name “psychical centres”, applied to certain cortical regions 
by many anatomists, is for the present at least based exclusively 
either on the very questionable interpretation of experiments on 
animals, or else on the mere anatomical fact that no motor or 
sensory fibres running directly to these regions can be found, and 
that their connective fibres in general are developed relatively 
late. The cortex of the frontal brain is such a region. In the 
human brain it is noticeable for its large development. It has 
been observed in many cases that disturbances of this part of 
the brain soon result in marked inability to concentrate the 
attention or in other intellectual defects which are possibly 
reduceable to this; and from these observations the hypothesis 
has been made that this region is to be regarded as the seat of 
the function of apperception which will be discussed later (4), 
and of all those components of psychical experience in which, as 
in the feelings, the unitary interconnection of mental life finds its 
expression (comp. p. 89). This hypothesis requires, however, 
a firmer empirical foundation than it has at present. It is to 
be noted that those cases where, in contrast with the first ones 
mentioned, a partial injury of the frontal lobe is sustained without 
any noticeable disturbance of intelligence, are by no means proofs 
against this hypothesis. There is much evidence to show that 
just here, in the higher centres, local injuries may occur without 
any apparent results. This is probably due to the great com- 
plexity of the connections and to the various ways in which the 
different elements can, therefore, take the place of one another. 
The expression “centre” in all these cases is, of course, employed 
in the sense that is justified by the general relation of psychical 
to physical functions, that is, in the sense of a parallelism be- 
tween the two classes of elementary processes, the one regarded 
from the point of view of the natural sciences, the other from 
that of psychology (comp. § 1,2 and § 22, 9).

§ 15. Consciousness and Attention. 207 
3. The interconnection of psychical processes, which con- 
stitutes what we understand under the concept consciousness. 
is in part a simultaneous, in part a successive interconnection. 
The sum of all the processes present at a given moment is 
always a unitary whole whose parts are more or less closely 
united. This is the simultaneous interconnection. A present 
state is derived directly from that immediately preceding either 
through the disappearance of certain processes while others 
change their course and still others begin, or, when a state 
of unconsciousness intervenes, the new processes are brought 
into relation with those that were presént before. These 
are successive interconnections. In all these cases the scope 
of the single combinations between preceding and following 
processes determines the state of consciousness. Consciousness 
gives place to unconsciousness when this interconnection is com- 
pletely interrupted, and it is more incomplete the looser the 
connection of the processes of the moment with those preceding. 
Thus, after a period of unconsciousness the normal state of 
consciousness is generally only slowly recovered through a 
gradual reestablishment of relations with earlier experiences 
So we come to distinguish grades of consciousness. The 
lower limit, or zero grade, is unconsciousness. This condition. 
which consists in an absolute absence of all psychical inter- 
connections, is essentially different from the disappearance 
of single psychical contents from consciousness. The latter 
is continually taking place in the flow of mental processes. 
Complex ideas and feelings and even single elements of these 
compounds may disappear, and new ones take their places 
This continuous appearance and disappearance of element 
and composite processes in consciousness is what makes up 
its successive interconnection. Without this change, such an 
interconnection would, of course, be impossible. Any psychical 
element that has disappeared from consciousness, is to be
-P-A-G-E-226
208 III. Interconnection of Psychical Compounds. 
called unconscious in the sense that we assume the possibility 
of its renewal, that is, its reappearance in the actual inter- 
connection of psychical processes. Our knowledge of an 
element that has become unconscious does not extend beyond 
this possibility of its renewal. For psychology, therefore, 
it has no meaning except as a disposition for the rise 
of future components of psychical processes which are 
connected with others before present. Assumptions as 
to the state of the “unconscious” or as to “unconscious 
processes” of any kind which are thought of as existing along 
with the conscious processes of experience, are entirely un- 
productive for psychology. There are, of course, physical 
concomitants of the psychical dispositions mentioned, of which 
some can be directly demonstrated, some inferred from various 
experiences. These physical concomitants are the effects which 
practice produces on all organs, especially those of the nervous 
system. As a universal result of practice we observe a facil- 
itation of action which renders a repetition of the process 
easier. To be sure, we do not know any details in regard to 
the changes that are effected in the structure of the nervous 
elements through practice, but we can represent them to 
ourselves through very natural analogies with mechanical 
processes, such, for example, as the reduction of friction 
resulting from the rubbing of two surfaces against each other. 
4. It was noted in the case of temporal ideas, that the 
member of a series of successive ideas which is immediately 
present in our perception, has the most favorable position. 
Similarly in the simultaneous interconnection of consciousness, 
for example in a compound clang or in a series of spacial 
objects, certain single components are favored above the 
others. In both cases we designate the differences in the 
perception as differences in clearness and distinctness. Clearness 
is the relatively favorable comprehension of the object in itself,
-P-A-G-E-227
  § 15. Consciousness and Attention. 209 
distinctness the sharp discrimination from other objects, 
which is generally connected with clearness. The state 
which accompanies the clear grasp of any psychical. content 
and is characterized by a special feeling, we call attention. 
The process through which any such content is brought to 
clear comprehension we call apperception. In contrast with 
this, perception which is not accompanied by a state of 
attention, we designate apprehension. Those contents of 
consciousness upon which the attention is concentrated are 
spoken of, after the analogy of the external optical fixation- 
point, as the fixation-point of consciousness, or the inner 
fixation-point. On the other hand, the whole content of 
consciousness at any given moment is called the field of con- 
sciousness. When a psychical process passes into an uncon- 
scious state we speak of its sinking below the threshold of 
consciousness and when such a process arises we say it.appears 
above the threshold of consciousness. These are all figurative 
expressions and must not be understood literally. They are 
useful, however, because of the brevity and clearness they 
permit in the description of conscious processes. 
5. If we try to describe the train of psychical compounds 
in their interconnection with the aid of these figurative ex- 
pressions, we may say that it is made up of a continual 
coming and going. At first some compound comes into the field 
of consciousness and then advances into the inner fixation- 
point, from which it returns to the field of consciousness 
before disappearing entirely. Besides this train of psychical 
compounds which are apperceived, there is also a coming and 
going of others which are merely apprehended, that is, 
enter the field of consciousness and pass out again without 
reaching the inner fixation-point. Both the apperceived and 
the apprehended compounds may have different grades of 
clearness. In the case of the first class this appears in 
Wonort, Psychology, 14
-P-A-G-E-228
  210 III. Interconnection of Psychical Compounds. 
the fact that the clearness and distinctness of apperception 
in general is variable according to the state of consciousness. 
To illustrate: it can easily be shown that when one and the 
same impression is appe~ceived several times in succession, 
if the other conditions remain the same, the successive 
apperceptions are usually clearer and more distinct. The 
different degrees of clearness in the case of compounds that 
merely apprehended, may be observed most easily when 
the impressions are composite. It is then found, especially 
when the impressions last but an instant, that even here, 
where all the components are obscure from the first, that 
there are still different gradations. Some seem to rise more 
above the threshold of consciousness, some less. 
6. These relations can not be determined through chance 
introspections, but only by systematic experimental observations. 
The best kinds of conscious contents to use for such obser- 
vations are ideas because they can be easily produced at any 
time through external impressions. Now, in .any temporal 
idea. as already remarked (§ 11, p. 155), those components 
which belong to the present moment are in the fixation-point 
of consciousness. Those of the preceding impressions which 
were present shortly before, are still in the field of conscious- 
ness, while those which were present longer before, have dis- 
appeared from consciousness entirely. A spacial idea, on the 
other hand, when it has only a limited extent, may be 
apperceived at once in its totality. If it is more composite, 
then its parts too must pass successively through the inner 
tixation-point if they are to be clearly apprehended. It follows, 
therefore, that composite spacial ideas (especially momentary 
visual impressions’ are peculiarly well suited to furnish a 
measure of the amount of content that can be apperceived 
in a single act, or of the scope of attention: while composite 
temporal ideas for example, rhythmical auditory impressions,
-P-A-G-E-229
  
§ 15. Consciousness and Attention. 2411 
hammer-strokes) may be used for measuring the amount of 
all the contents that can enter into consciousness at a given 
moment, or the scope of consciousness. Experiments made in 
this way give, under different conditions, a scope of from 
6 to 12 simple impressions for attention and of 16 to 40 
such impressions for consciousness. The smaller figures are 
for those impressions which do not unite at all to ideational 
combinations, or at most very incompletely, the larger for 
those in which the elements combine as far as possible to 
composite ideas. 
6a. The most accurate way of determining the scope of attention 
is to use spacial impressions of sight, for in such cases it is 
very easy, by means of an electric spark, or the fall of a screen 
made with an opening in the centre, to expose the objects for 
an instant and in such a way that they all lie in the region 
of clearest vision. This gives us physiological conditions that 
do not prevent the apperception of a greater number of im- 
pressions than it is possible to apperceive because of the limited 
scope of attention. In these experiments there must be a point 
for fixation in the middle of the surface on which the impressions 
lie, before the momentary illumination. Immediately after the 
experiment, if it is properly arranged, the observer knows that 
the number of objects which were clearly seen in a physiological 
sense, is greater than the number included within the scope 
of attention. When, for example, a momentary impression is 
made up of letters, it is possible, by calling up a memory-image 
of the impression, to read afterwards some of the letters that 
were only indistinctly apprehended at the moment of illumination. 
This memory-image, however, is clearly distinguished in time 
from the impression itself, so that the determination of the scope 
of attention is not disturbed by it. Careful introspection easily 
succeeds in fixating the state of consciousness at the moment the 
impression arrives, and in distinguishing this from the subsequent 
acts of memory, which are always separated from it by a notice- 
able interval. Experiments made in this way show that the scope 
of attention is by no means a constant magnitude, but that, even 
14* 
 
-P-A-G-E-230
21 III. Interconnection of Psychical Compounds. 
when the concentration of the attention is approximately at its 
maximum, its scope depends in part on the simplicity or com- 
plexity of the impressions, in part on their familiarity. The 
simplest spacial impressions are arbitrarily distributed points. Of 
these a maximum of six can be apperceived at one time. When 
the impressions are somewhat more complex but of a familiar 
character, such as simple lines, figures, and letters, three or four 
of them are generally apperceived simultaneously, or, under 
favorable conditions, even five. The figures just given hold for 
vision; for touch the same limits seem to hold only in the case 
of points. Six such simple impressions can, under favorable 
conditions, be apperceived in the same instant. When the im- 
pressions are familiar but complex, even for vision, the number 
of ideas decreases, while that of the single elements increases 
very markedly. Thus, we can apperceive two or even three 
familiar monosyllabic words, which contain in all ten or twelve 
single letters. Under any circumstances, then, the assertion often 
made, that the attention can be concentrated on only one idea at 
a time, is false. 
Then, too, these observations overthrow the assumption some- 
times accepted, that the attention can sweep continuously and 
with great rapidity over a great number of single ideas. In the 
experiment described, if the attempt is made to fill up from 
memory the image which is clearly perceived an instant after the 
impression, a very noticeable interval is required to bring into 
clear consciousness an impression that was not apperceived at 
first; and in the process the first image always disappears from 
attention. The successive movement of attention over a number 
of objects is, accordingly, a discontinuous process, made up of 
a number of separate acts of apperception following one another. 
This discontinuity is due to the fact that every single apperception 
is made up of a period of increasing followed of by a period 
decreasing strain. The period of maximal tension between the two, 
may vary considerably in its duration. In the case of momentary 
and rapidly changing impressions, it is very brief; when, on the 
other hand, we concentrate on particular objects, it is longer. But, 
even when the attention is thus concentrated on objects of a con- 
stant character, a periodic interruption, due to the alternating 
relaxation and renewed concentration, always appears. This may be
-P-A-G-E-231
$ 15. Consciousness and Attention. 213 
easily observed, even in the ordinary action of attention. But here, 
too, we gain more detailed information through experiments. If 
we allow a weak, continuous impression to act on a sense-organ 
and remove so far as possible all other stimuli, it will be observed 
when the attention is concentrated upon it that at certain, generally 
irregular, intervals the impression becomes for a short time in- 
distinct, or even appears to fade out entirely, only to appear 
again the next moment. This wavering begins, when the im- 
pressions are very weak, after 3—6"; when they are somewhat 
stronger, after 1824”. These variations are readily distinguished 
from changes in the intensity of the impression itself, as may be 
easily demonstrated when, in the course of the experiment, the 
stimulus is purposely weakened or interrupted. There are essen- 
tially two characteristics that distinguish the subjective variations 
from those due to the changes in the stimulus. First, so long 
as the impression merely passes back and forth from the obscure 
field of consciousness to the inner fixation-point, there is always 
an idea of its continuance, just as there was in the experiments 
with momentary impressions an indefinite and obscure idea of 
the components which were not apperceived. Secondly, the 
oscillations of attention are attended by characteristic feelings and 
sensations which are entirely absent when the changes are ob- 
jective. The characteristic feelings are those of expectation and 
activity, which regularly increase with the concentration of atten- 
tion and decrease with its relaxation. These will be discussed 
more fully later. The sensations come from the sense-organ 
affected, or at least emanate indirectly from it. They consist in 
sensations of tension in the tympanum, or in those of accom- 
modation and convergence, etc. These two series of characteristics 
distinguish the concepts of the clearness and distinctness of psy- 
chical contents from that of the intensity of their sensational 
elements. A strong impression may be obscure and a weak one 
clear. The only causal relation between these two different con- 
cepts is to be found in the fact that in general the stronger 
impressions force themselves more upon the apperception. Whether 
or not they are really more clearly apperceived, depends on the 
other conditions present at the moment. The same is true of the 
advantages which those parts of a visual impression have that 
fall within the region of clearest vision. As a rule, the fixated
-P-A-G-E-232
  
214 III. Interconnection of Psychical Compounds. 
objects are also the ones apperceived. But, in the experiments 
with momentary impressions described above, it can be shown 
that this interconnection may be broken up. This happens when 
we voluntarily concentrate our attention on a point in the 
eccentric regions of the field of vision. The object which is 
obscurely seen then becomes the one which is clearly ideated. 
6b. In the same way that momentary spacial impressions are 
used to determine the scope of attention, we may use those which 
succeed one another in time, as'a measure for the scope of con- 
sciousness. In this case we start with the assumption that a 
series of impressions can be united in a single unitary idea only 
when they are all together in consciousness, at least for one 
moment. If we listen to a series of hammer-strokes, it is obvious 
that while the present sound is apperceived, those immediately 
preceding it are still in the field of consciousness. Their clearness 
diminishes, however, just in proportion to their distance in time 
from the apperceived impression, and those lying beyond a certain 
limit disappear from consciousness entirely. If we can determine 
this limit, we shall have a direct measure for the scope of con- 
sciousness under the special conditions given in the experiment. 
As a means for the determination of this limit we may use the 
ability to compare temporal ideas that follow one another im- 
mediately. So long as such an idea is present in consciousness 
as a single unitary whole, we can compare a succeeding idea 
with it and decide whether the two are alike or not. On the 
other hand, such a comparison is absolutely impossible when the 
preceding temporal series is not a unitary whole for conscious- 
ness, that is, when a part of its constituents have passed into 
unconsciousness before the end is reached. If, then, we present 
two series of strokes, such as can be produced, for example, by 
a metronome, one immediately after the other, marking off each 
series by a signal at its beginning, as, for example, with a bell- 
stroke, we can judge directly from the impression, so long as 
they can be grasped as single units in consciousness, whether the 
two series are alike or not. Of course, in such experiments 
counting of the strokes must be strictly avoided. In making the 
judgments it may be noticed that the impression of likeness is 
produced by the affective elements of the temporal ideas mentioned 
before p. 156. Every stroke in the second series is preceded  
-P-A-G-E-233
  § 15. Consciousness and Attention. ‘ 215 
by a feeling of expectation corresponding to the analogous stroke 
of the first series, so that every stroke too many or too few 
produces a feeling of disappointment attending the disturbance 
of the expectation. It follows that it is not necessary for the 
two successive series to be present in consciousness at the same 
time in order that they may be compared; but what is re- 
quired is the union of all the impressions of one series together 
in a single unitary idea. The relatively fixed boundary of the 
scope of consciousness is clearly shown in the fact that the 
likeness of two temporal ideas is always recognized with certainty 
so long as they do not pass the bound that holds for the conditions 
under which they are given, while the judgment becomes absolutely 
uncertain when this limit is once crossed. The extent of the scope 
of consciousness as found in measurements made whén the con- 
ditions of attention remain the same, depends partly on the rate 
of the successive impressions and partly on their more or less 
complete rhythmical combination. When the rate of succession 
is slower than about 4”, it becomes impossible to combine sucessive 
impressions to a temporal idea; by the time a new impression 
arrives, the preceding one has already disappeared from conscious- 
ness. When the rate passes the upper limit of about 0.18", the 
formation of distinctly defined temporal ideas is impossible because 
the attention can not follow the impressions any longer. The 
most favorable rate is a succession of strokes every 0.2—0.3”. 
With this rate, and with the simplest rhythm, which generally 
arises of itself when the perception is uninfluenced by any 
special objective conditions, the 2/,-time 8 double or 16 single 
impressions can be just grasped together. The best measure 
for the apprehension of the greatest possible number of single 
impressions is the 4/,-measure with the strong accent on the first 
stroke and the medium accent on the fifth. In this case a 
maximum of five feet or forty single impressions, can be grasped 
at once. If these figures are compared with those obtained when 
the scope of attention was measured, putting simple and compound 
temporal impressions equal to the corresponding spacial im- 
pressions, we find that the scope of consciousness is about four 
times as great as that of attention.
-P-A-G-E-234
  216 III. Interconnection of Psychical Compounds. 
7. Besides the properties of clearness and distinctness 
which belong to conscious contents in themselves or in their 
mutual relations to one another, there are regularly others 
which are immediately recognized as accompanying processes. 
These are partly affective processes that are characteristic 
for particular forms of apprehension and apperception, partly 
sensations of a somewhat variable character. Especially 
the ways in which psychical contents enter the field and 
fixation-point of consciousness vary according to the different 
conditions under which this entrance may take place. When 
any psychical process rises above the threshold of conscious- 
ness, the affective elements, as soon as they are strong enough, 
are what first become noticeable. They begin to force them- 
selves energetically into the fixation-point of consciousness 
before anything is perceived of the ideational elements. This 
is the case whether the impressions are new or revivals of 
earlier processes. This is what causes the peculiar states of 
mind which we are not exactly able to account for, some- 
times of a pleasurable or unpleasurable character, sometimes 
predominantly states of strained expectation. In this last 
case the sudden entrance of the ideational elements belonging 
to the feelings, into the scope of the attention, is accompanied 
by feelings of relief or satisfaction. When we are trying to 
recall something that has been forgotten, the same affective 
state may arise. Often there is vividly present in such a 
case, besides the regular feeling of strain, the special affective 
tone of the forgotten idea, although the idea itself still 
remains in the background of consciousness. In a similar 
manner, as we shall see later (§ 16), the clear apperception 
of ideas in acts of cognition and recognition is always 
preceded by special feelings. Similar affective states may be 
produced experimentally by the momentary illumination of a 
field of vision in which there are impressions of the strongest
-P-A-G-E-235
  § 15. Consciousness and Attention. 217 
possible affective tone in the region’ of indirect vision. All 
these experiences seem to show that every content of con- 
sciousness has some influence on attention. It shows this 
partly in its own affective coloring, partly in the feelings 
regularly connected with acts of attention. The whole effect of 
these obscure contents of consciousness on the attention 
fuses, according to the general law of the synthesis of affec- 
tive components (p. 159), with the feelings attending the 
apperceived contents to form a single total feeling. 
8. When psychical content enters the fixation-point of 
consciousness, new and peculiar affective processes are added 
to those that have been described. These new feelings may 
be of a variety of kinds, according to the different conditions 
attending this entrance into the fixation-point. The conditions 
are of two classes, and are interconnected for the most part 
with the above described preparatory affective influences of 
the content not yet apperceived. 
First, the new content forces itself on the attention 
suddenly and without preparatory affective influences; this 
we call passive apperception. While the content of conscious- 
ness is becoming clearer both in its ideational and affective 
elements, there is first of all a concomitant feeling of passive 
receptivity, which is a depressing feeling, and generally 
stronger the more intense the psychical processes, and the 
more rapid its rise. This .feeling soon sinks and then 
gives place to an antagonistic, exciting feeling of activity. 
There are connected with both these feelings characteristic 
sensations in the muscles of the sense-organ from which the 
ideational components of the process proceed. The feeling 
of receptivity is generally accompanied by a transient sensation 
of relaxation, that of activity by a succeeding sensation of 
strain. 
Secondly, the new content is preceded by the preparatory
-P-A-G-E-236
  218 IIT. Interconnection of Psychical Compounds. 
affective influences mentioned above (7), and as a result the 
attention is concentrated upon it even before it arrives; this 
we call active apperception. In such a case the apperception of 
the content is preceded by a feeling of expectation, sometimes of 
longer, sometimes of shorter duration. This feeling is generally 
one of strain and may at the same time be one of excitement; it 
may also have pleasurable or unpleasurable factors, according 
to its ideational elements. This feeling of expectation is 
usually accompanied by fairly intense sensations of tension 
in the muscles of the sense-organ affected. At the moment 
in which the content arises in clear consciousness, this feeling 
gives place to a feeling of fulfillment which is generally very 
short and always has the character of a feeling of relief. 
Under circumstances it may also be depressing or exciting, 
pleasurable or unpleasurable. After this feeling of fulfillment 
we have at once that of activity — the same that appeared 
at the close of passive apperception, and is here, too, united 
with an increase in the feelings of strain. 
Sa, The experimental observation of the different forms of 
apperception can be carried out best with the aid of the reaction- 
experiments described in § 14, 11sq. Passive apperception may 
be studied by the use of unexpected, and active by the use of 
expected impressions. At the same time it will be observed that 
between these typical differences there are intermediate stages. 
Either the passive form will approach the active because of the 
weakness of the first stage, or the active will approach the passive 
form because in the sudden relaxation of the expectation the 
contrast between the expectation and the relief and depression which 
come in the succeeding feeling of fulfillment, is more marked than 
usual. In reality we have everywhere continuously interconnected 
processes which are opposite character only in extreme cases. 
9. If the affective side of these processes of attention are 
more closely examined, it is obvious that they are exactly 
the same as the affective content of all volitional processes.
-P-A-G-E-237
  
§ 15. Consciousness and Altention. 219 
At the same time it is clear that in its essential character 
passive apperception corresponds to a simple impulsive act, while 
the active form corresponds to a complex voluntary act. In the 
first case we may evidently regard the psychical content that 
forces itself upon attention without preparation, as the single 
motive which, without any conflict with other motives, gives 
rise to the act of apperception. The act is here too con- 
nected with the feeling of activity characteristic of all volitional 
acts. In the case of active apperception, on the other hand, 
other psychical contents with their affective elements tend to 
force themselves upon the attention during the preparatory 
affective stages, so that the act of apperception when it finally 
is performed is often recognized as a voluntary process or 
even as a selective process when the conflict between different 
contents comes clearly into consciousness. The existence of 
such selective acts under the circumstances mentioned was 
recognized even in older psychology where “voluntary attention” 
was spoken of. But here too, as in the case of external yo- 
litional acts, will stood alone; there was no explanation of 
it by its antecedents, for the central point in the development, 
namely, the fact that so-called involuntary attention is only 
a simpler form of internal volition, was entirely overlooked. 
Then, too, in full accord with the methods of the old faculty- 
theory “attention” and “will” were regarded as different, some- 
times as related, sometimes as mutually excluding psychical 
forces, while the truth evidently is that these two concepts 
refer to the same class of psychical processes. The only 
difference is that processes of apperception and attention are 
those which occur only as so-called internal acts, that is, 
have no external effects except indirectly when they lead to 
other processes. 
10. Connected with these internal volitional acts, which 
we call processes of attention, there takes place a formation
-P-A-G-E-238
  220 IIT. Interconnection of Psychical Compounds. 
of certain concepts of the highest importance for all psychical 
development. This is the formation of the concept subject 
and the correlate presupposition of objects as independent 
realities standing over against the subject. This can be carried 
out in its logical form only with the aid of scientific reflection, 
still it has its substratum in the processes of attention. 
Even in immediate experience there is a division between 
components of this experience. On the one hand are those which 
are arranged in space with relation to the point of orientation 
mentioned above (p. 131), and are called either oljects, that is, 
something outside the perceiving subject, or, when we attend to 
the mode of their rise in consciousness, ideas, that is something 
which the subject perceives. On the other hand, there are 
those contents of experience which do not belong to this 
spacial order, though they are continually brought into relation 
with it through their quality and intensity. These latter con- 
tents, as we saw in § 12—14, are intimately interconnected. 
Feelings are parts of emotions and emotions are to be con- 
sidered as components of volitional processes. The process 
may end before it is fully completed, as often when a feeling 
gives rise to no noticeable emotion, or when an emotion fades 
out without really causing the volitional act for which it 
prepared the way. All these affective processes may, accord- 
ingly, be subsumed under the general concept volitional 
process. This is the complete process of which the two others 
are merely components of simpler or more complex character. 
From this point of view we can easily understand how it is 
that even simple feelings contain, in the extremes between which 
they vary, a volitional direction; and express, in the same way, 
the amount of volitional energy present at a given moment; 
and finally, correspond to certain particular phases of the 
volitional process itself. The direction of volition is obviously 
indicated by the pleasurable or unpleasurable directions of
-P-A-G-E-239
  
§ 15. Consciousness and Attention. 221 
feelings, which correspond directly to some sort of effort to 
reach something or to avoid it. The energy of volition finds 
its expression in the arousing and subduing directions of 
feelings, while the opposite phases of a volitional process are 
related to the directions of strain and relaxation. 
11. Thus, volition proves to be the fundamental fact from 
which all those processes arise which are made up of feelings. 
Then, too, in the process of apperception, which is found 
through psychological analysis to have all the characteristics 
of a volitional act, we have a direct relation between this 
fundamental fact and the ideational contents of experience 
which arise from the spacial arrangement of sensations. Now, 
volitional processes are apprehended as unitary processes and 
as being uniform in character in the midst of all the variations 
in their components. As a result there arises an immediate 
feeling of this unitary interconnection, which is most intimately 
connected with the feeling of activity that accompanies all 
volition, and then is carried over to all conscious contents 
because of their relation to will, as mentioned above. This 
feeling of the interconnection of all single psychical experiences 
is called the “ego”. It is a feeling, not an idea as it is often 
called. Like all feelings, however, it is connected with certain 
sensations and ideas. The ideational components most closely 
related to the ego are the common sensations and the idea 
of one’s own body. 
That part of the affective and ideational contents which 
separates off from the totality of consciousness and fuses 
closely with the feeling of the ego, is called self-consciousness. 
It is no more a reality, apart from the processes of which 
it is made up, than is consciousness in general, but merely 
points out the interconnection of these processes, which further- 
more, especially in their ideational components, can never 
be sharply distinguished from the rest of consciousness. This 
 
-P-A-G-E-240
  229) III. Interconnection of Psychical Compounds. 
shows itself most of all in the fact that the idea of one’s 
own body sometimes fuses with the feeling of the ego, some- 
times is distinct from it as the idea of an object, and that 
in general self-consciousness in its development always tends 
to reduce itself to its affective basis. 
12. This separation of self-consciousness from the other 
contents of consciousness also gives rise to the discrimination 
of subject and objects. This discrimination was prepared for, 
to be sure, by the characteristic differences among the original 
contents of consciousness, but is fully carried out only as a 
consequence of this separation. The concept subject has 
accordingly as a result of its psychological development three 
different meanings of different scope, each of which may at 
different times be the one employed. In its narrowest sense 
the subject is the interconnection of volitional processes which 
finds expression in the feeling of the ego. In the next wider 
sense it includes the real content of these volitional processes 
together with the feelings and emotions that prepare their 
way. Finally, in its widest significance it embraces the 
constant ideational substratum of these subjective processes, 
that is, the body of the individual as the seat of the common 
sensations. In the line of development the widest significance is 
the oldest, and in actual psychical experience the narrowest is 
continually giving way to a return of one of the others because 
it can be fully attained only through conceptual abstraction. 
This highest form is, then, in reality merely a kind of limit 
towards which the self-consciousness may approach more or 
less closely. : 
12a. This discrimination of subject and objects, or the ego 
aud the outer world as it is commonly expressed by reducing the 
first concept to its original affective substratum and gathering 
the second together in a general concept — this discrimination 
is the basis of all the considerations responsible for the dualism 
 
-P-A-G-E-241
  
§ 15. Consciousness and Attention. 223 
which first gained currency in the popular view of things and 
was then carried over into the philosophical systems. It is on 
this ground that psychology comes to be set over against the 
other sciences, in particular the natural sciences, as a science of 
the subject (§ 1, 3a.) This view could be right only under the 
conditions that the discrimination of the ego from the outer 
world were a fact preceding all experience and that the concepts 
subject and objects could be unequivocally distinguished once 
for all. But neither of these conditions is fulfilled. Self-con- 
sciousness depends on a whole series of psychical processes of 
which it is the product, not the producer. Subject and object 
are, therefore, neither originally nor in later development abso- 
lutely different contents of experience, but they are concepts 
which are due to the reflection resulting from the interrelations 
of the various components of the absolutely unitary content of 
our immediate experience. 
13. The interconnection of psychical processes which makes 
up consciousness, necessarily has its deepest spring in the 
processes of combination which are continually taking place 
between the elements of the single contents of experience. 
Such processes are operative in the formation of single psy- 
chical compounds and they are what give rise to the simul- 
taneous unity of the state of consciousness present at a given 
moment and also to the continuity of successive states. These 
processes of combination are of the most various kinds; each 
one has its individual coloring, which is never exactly re- 
produced in any second case. Still, the most general differ- 
ences are those exhibited by the attention in the passive 
reception of impressions and the active apperception of the 
same. As short names for these differences we use the term 
association to indicate a process of combination in a passive 
state of attention, and apperceptive combination to indicate 
a combination in which the attention is active.

§ 16. ASSOCIATIONS. 
1. The concept association has undergone, in the modern 
development of psychology, a necessary and very radical 
change in meaning. To be sure, this change has not been 
accepted everywhere, and the original meaning is still re- 
tained, especially by those psychologists who support, even 
to-day, the fundamental positions on which the association- 
psychology grew up (§ 2, p. 13 sq.). This psychology which 
is predominantly intellectualistic, pays attention to nothing 
but the ideational contents of consciousness and, accordingly, 
limits the concept of association to the combinations of ideas. 
Hartley and Hume, the two founders of association-psy- 
chology, spoke of “association of ideas” in this limited sense.!) 
Ideas were regarded as objects, or at least as processes 
that could be repeated in consciousness with exactly the 
same character as that in which they were present at first 
(p. 13, 8). This led to the view that association was a 
principle for the explanation of the so-called “reproduction” 
of ideas. Furthermore, it was not considered necessary to 
account for the rise of composite ideas with the aid of psy- 
chological analysis, since it was assumed that the physical 
union of impressions in sense-perception was sufficient to 
explain the psychological composition and so the concept of 
association was limited to those forms of so-called reproduc- 
tion in which the associated ideas succeed one another in 
time. For the discrimination of the chief forms of successive 
associations Aristotle’s logical scheme for the memory-processes 
was accepted, and in accordance with the principle of classi- 
fication by opposites the following forms were discriminated: 
(1) The author remarks that the English word idea as here used 
corresponds to the German Vorstellung. Tr.) 
 
-P-A-G-E-243
§ 16. Associations. 225 
association by similarity and contrast, and association by 
simultaneity and succession. These class-concepts gained by 
a logical dichotomic process were dignified with the name 
“laws of associations”. Modern psychology has generally 
sought to reduce the number of these laws. Contrast is 
regarded as a special form of similarity, for only those con- 
trasted concepts are associated which belong to the same 
general class; and associations by simultaneity and succession 
are both included under contiguity. Contiguity is then regarded 
as outer association and contrasted with immer association 
by similarity. Some psychologists believe it possible to reduce 
these two forms to a single, still more fundamental, “law of 
association” by making association by contiguity a special form 
of similarity, or, what is still more common, by explaining simi- 
larity as a result of association by contiguity. In both cases 
association is generally brought under the more general 
principle of practice or habituation. 
2. The whole foundation for this kind of theorizing is 
destroyed by two facts which force themselves irresistibly 
upon us as soon as we begin to study the matter experimen- 
tally. The first of these facts is the general result of 
the psychological analysis of sense-perceptions, that com- 
posite ideas, which association-psychology regards as irre- 
ducible psychical units, are in fact the results of synthetic 
processes which are obviously in close interconnection with the 
complex processes commonly called associatioris. The second 
fact comes from the experimental investigation of memory- 
processes. It is found that the reproduction of ideas in the 
strict sense of a renewal in its unchanged form of an earlier 
idea, never takes place at all, but that what really does happen 
in an act of memory is the rise of a new idea in consciousness, 
always differing from the earlier idea to which it is referred, and 
deriving its elements as a rule from various preceding ideas. 
Wonpr, Pycholegy, 15
-P-A-G-E-244
  
226 IIT. Interconnection of Psychical Compounds. 
It follows from the first fact that there are elementary 
processes of association between the components of ideas 
preceding the associations of composite ideas with one another, 
to which the name is generally limited. The second fact 
proves that ordinary associations can be nothing but complex 
products of such elementary associations. These conclusions 
show the utter unjustifiableness of excluding the elementary 
processes whose products are simultaneous ideas rather than 
successive, from the concept association. Then, too, there is 
no reason for limiting the concept to ideational processes. 
The existence of composite feelings, emotions, etc., shows, on 
the contrary, that affective elements also enter into regular 
combinations, which may in tum unite with associations of 
sensational elements to form complex products, as we saw 
in the rise of temporal ideas (§ 11, p. 156sq.). The intimate 
relation between the various orders of combining processes 
and the necessity of elementary associations as antecedents 
to all complex combinations, furnishes further support for 
the observation made on the general mode of the occurrence 
of conscious processes, that it is never possible to draw a 
sharp boundary line between the combinations of the elements 
that compose psychical compounds, and the interconnection 
of the various psychical compounds, in consciousness (p. 203). 
3. It follows that the concept of association can gain a fixed, 
and in any particular case unequivocal, significance, only when 
association is regarded as an elementary process which never 
shows itself in the actual psychical processes except in a more 
or less complex form, so that the only way to find out the 
character of elementary association is to subject its complex 
products to a psychological analysis. The ordinarily so-called 
associations ‘the successive associations) are only one, and the 
loosest at that, of all the forms of combination. In contrast 
with these we have the closer combinations from which the
-P-A-G-E-245
  $16. Associations. 227 
different kinds of psychical compounds arise and to which we 
apply the general name fusions, because of the closeness of the 
union (p. 94, sq.). The elementary processes from which the 
various compounds, the intensive, spacial, and temporal ideas, 
the composite feelings, the emotions, and the volitional processes 
arise, are, accordingly, to be considered as associative processes. 
For the purpose of practical discrimination, however, it will 
be well to limit the word “association” to those combining 
processes which take place between elements of different com- 
pounds. This narrower meaning which we give the term 
association in contrast with fusion, is in one respect an 
approach to the meaning that it had in older psychology 
(p. 224), for it refers exclusively to the interconnection of 
psychical compounds in consciousness. It differs from the 
older concept, however, in two important characteristics. First 
it is here regarded as an elementary process, or, when we are 
dealing with complex phenomena, as a product of such ele- 
mentary processes. Secondly, we recognize, just as in the 
case of fusions, simultaneous associations as well as successive. 
In fact, the former are to be looked upon as the earlier. 
A. SIMULTANEOUS ASSOCIATIONS. 
4. Simultaneous associations made up of elements from 
different psychical compounds may be divided into two 
classes: into assimilations, or associations between the ele- 
ments of like compounds, and complications, or associations 
between elements of unlike compounds. Both may take place, 
in accordance with our limitation of the concept association, 
between those compounds only which are themselves simul- 
taneous combinations, that is, between intensive and spacial 
ideas and between composite feelings.

228 III. Interconnection of Psychical Compounds. 
a. Assimilations. 
5. Assimilations are a form of association that is con- 
inually met with, especially in the case of intensive and 
spacial ideas. It is an essential supplement to the process 
of formation of ideas by fusion. In the case of composite 
feelings this form of combination never seems to appear ex- 
cept where we have at the same time an assimilation of the 
ideational elements. It is most clearly demonstrable when 
certain single components of the product of an assimilation are 
given through external sense-impressions, while others belong 
to earlier ideas. In such a case the assimilation may be 
demonstrated by the fact that certain components of the 
idea which are wanting in the objective impression or are 
there represented by components other than those actually 
present in the idea itself, can be shown to arise from earlier 
ideas. Experience shows that of these reproduced components 
those are most favored which are very frequently present. 
Still, certain single elements of the impression are usually of 
more importance in determining the association than others 
are, so that when these dominanting elements are altered, as 
may be the case especially with assimilations of the visual 
sense, the product of the assimilation undergoes a corresponding 
change. 
6. Among intensive compounds it is especially the auditory 
ideas which are very often the results of assimilation. They 
also furnish the most striking examples for the principle of 
frequency mentioned above. Of all the auditory ideas the 
most familiar are the readily available ideas of words, for 
these are attended to more than other sound-impressions. As 
a result the hearing of words is continually accompanied by 
assimilations; the sound-impression is incomplete, but it is 
entirely filled out by earlier impressions, so that we do not
-P-A-G-E-247
§ 16. Associations. 229 
notice the incompleteness. So it comes that not the correct 
hearing of words, but the misunderstanding of them, that is, 
the erroneous filling out of incomplete impressions through 
incorrect assimilations, is what generally leads us to notice the 
process. We may find an expression of the same fact in the 
ease with which any sound whatever, as, for example, the cry 
of an animal, the noise of water, wind, machinery, etc., can 
be made to sound like words almost at will. 
7. In the case of intensive feelings we note the presence 
of assimilations in the fact that impressions which are accom- 
panied by sense-feelings and elementary aesthetic feeling, very 
often exercise a second direct affective influence for which 
we can account only when we recall certain ideas of which 
we are reminded by the impressions. In such cases the 
association is usually at first only a form of affective associa- 
tion, and only so long as this is true is the assimilation 
simultaneous. The ideational association which explains the 
effect is, on the contrary, a later process belonging to the 
forms of successive association. For this reason it is hardly 
possible, when we have clang-impressions or color-impressions 
accompanied by particular feelings, or when we have simple 
spacial ideas, to decide what the immediate affective influence 
of the impression itself is and what is that of the association. 
As a rule, in such cases the affective process is to be looked 
upon as the resultant of an immediate and an associative 
factor which nnite to form a single, unitary total feeling in 
accordance with the general laws of affective fusion (p. 159). 
8. Association in the case of spacial ideas is of the most 
comprehensive character. It is not very noticeable in the 
sphere of towch when vision is present, on account of the 
small importance of tactual ideas in general and especially 
for memory. For the blind, on. the other hand, it is the 
essential means for the rapid orientation in space which is 
 
-P-A-G-E-248
230 III. Interconnection of Psychical Compounds. 
necessary, for example, in the rapid reading of the blind- 
alphabet. The effects of assimilation are most strikingly evident 
when several tactual surfaces are concerned, because in such 
cases its presence is easily betrayed by the illusions which may 
arise in consequence of some disturbance in the usual inter- 
relation of the sensations. Thus, for example, when we touch 
a small ball with the index and middle fingers crossed, we 
have the idea of two balls. The explanation is obvious. In 
the ordinary position of the fingers the external impression 
here given actually corresponds to two balls, and the many 
perceptions of this kind that have been received before, exer- 
cise an assimilative action on the new impression. 
9. In visual sense-perceptions assimilative processes play a 
very large part. Here they aid in the formation of ideas of the 
magnitude, distance, and three-dimensional character of visual 
objects. In this last respect they are essential supplements of 
immediate binocular motives for projection into depth. Thus, 
the correlation that exists between the ideas of the distance and 
magnitude of objects, as, for example, the apparent difference 
in the size of the sun or moon on the horizon and at the 
zenith, is to be explained as an effect of assimilation. The 
perspective of drawing and painting also depends on these 
influences. A picture drawn or painted on a plane surface can 
appear three-dimensional only on condition that the impression 
arouses earlier three-dimensional ideas which are assimilated 
with the new impression. The influence of these assimilations is 
most evident in the case of unshaded drawings that can be seen 
either in relief or in intaglio. Observation shows that these differ- 
ences in appearance are by no means accidental or dependent 
en the so-called “power of imagination”, but that there are 
always elements in the immediate impression which determine 
completely the assimilative process. The elements that are 
thus operative are, above all, the sensations arising from the
-P-A-G-E-249
  
§ 16. Associations. 231 
position and movements of the eye. Thus, for example, a 
linear design which can be interpreted as either a solid or 
a hollow prism, is seen alternately in relief and in intaglio 
according as we fixate in the two cases. the parts of the 
drawing which correspond ordinarily to a solid or to a hollow 
object. A solid angle represented by three lines in the same 
plane appears in relief when the fixation-point is moved along 
one of the lines, starting from the apex, it appears in intaglio 
when the movement is in the opposite direction, from the 
end of the line towards the apex. In these and all like cases 
the assimilation is determined by the rule that in its movement 
over the fixation-lines of objects the eye always passes from 
nearer to more distant points. 
In other cases the geometric optical illusions (§ 10, 19 and 
20) which are due to the laws of ocular movements, produce 
secondarily certain ideas of distance, and these not in- 
frequently eliminate the contradictions brought about in the 
picture by the illusions. Thus, to illustrate, an interrupted 
straight line appears longer than an equal uninterrupted line 
(p. 125); as a result we tend to project the first to a greater 
depth than the latter. Here both lines cover just the same 
distances on the retina in spite of the fact that their length 
is perceived as different, because of the different motor 
energy connected with their estimation. An elimination of this 
contradiction is effected by means of the different ideas of 
distance, for when one of two lines whose retinal images are 
like, appears longer than the other, it must, under the ordinary 
conditions of vision, belong to a more distant object. Again, 
when one straight line is intersected at an acute angle by 
another, the result is an overestimation of the acute angle, 
which sometimes gives rise, when the line is long, to an 
apparent bending near the point of intersection (p. 125). Here 
too the contradiction between the course of the line and the
-P-A-G-E-250
  232 IIT. Interconnection of Psychical Compounds. 
increase in the size of the angle of intersection, is often elim- 
inated by the apparent extension of the line in the third 
dimension. In all these cases the perspective can be explained 
only as the assimilative effect of earlier ideas of corre- 
sponding character. 
10. In none of the assimilations discussed is it possible 
to show that any former idea has acted as a whole on 
the new impression. Generally this is impossible because we 
must attribute the assimilative influence to a large number 
of ideas, differing in many respects from one another. Thus, 
for example, a straight line which intersects a vertical at an 
acute angle, corresponds to innumerable cases in which an in- 
clination of the line with its accompanying increase of the 
angle appeared as a component of a three-dimensional idea. 
But all these cases may have been very different in regard 
to the size of the angle, the length of the lines, and other 
attending circumstances. We must, accordingly, think of the 
assimilative process as a process in which not a single definite 
idea or even a definite combination of elements from earlier 
ideas, but as a rule a great number of such combinations 
are operative. These need agree only approximately with the 
new impression in order to affect consciousness. 
We may gain some notion of the way in which this 
effect is produced from the important part that certain ele- 
ments connected with the impression play in the process, as, 
for example, the sensations of ocular position and move- 
ments in visual ideas. Obviously it is these immediate 
sensational elements that serve to pick out from the great 
mass of ideational elements which react upon the impression, 
certain particular ones that correspond to themselves, and 
then bring these selected factors into a form agreeing with 
that of the rest of the components of the immediate im- 
pression, At the same time it appears that not merely the
-P-A-G-E-251
§ 16. Associations. 233 
elements of our memory-images are relatively indefinite 
and therefore variable, but that even the perception of an 
immediate impression may vary under special conditions 
within fairly wide limits. In this way the assimilative process 
starts primarily from elements of the immediate impression, 
chiefly from particular ones which are of preeminent impor- 
tance for the formation of the idea, as, for example, the sensa- 
tions of-ocular position and movement in visual ideas. These 
elements call up certain particular memory-elements corre- 
sponding to themselves. These memories then exercise an 
assimilative effect on the immediate impression, and the im- 
pression in turn reacts in the same way on the reproduced 
elements. These separate acts are, like the whole process, 
not successive, but, at least for our consciousness, simultaneous. 
For this reason the product of the assimilation is apperceived 
as an immediate, unitary idea. The two distinguishing 
characteristics of assimilation are, accordingly, 1) that it is 
made up of a series of elementary processes of combination, 
that is, processes that have to do with the components of ideas, 
not with the whole ideas themselves, and 2) that the united 
components modify one another through reciprocal assim- 
dlations. 
11. On this basis we can explain without difficulty the 
main differences between complex assimilative processes, by 
the very different parts that the various factors necessary 
to such a process play in the various concrete cases. In 
ordinary sense-perceptions the direct elements are so pre- 
dominant that the reproduced elements are as a rule entirely 
overlooked, although in reality they are never absent and 
are often very important for the perception of the objects. 
These reproduced elements are much more noticeable when 
the assimilative effect of the direct elements is hindered 
through external or internal influences, such as indistinctness 
 
-P-A-G-E-252
  234 III. Interconnection of Psychical Compounds. 
of the impression or affective and emotional excitement. In 
all cases where the difference between the impression and 
the idea becomes, in this way, so great that it is apparent. 
at once on closer examination, we call the product of the 
assimilation an dlusion. 
The universality of assimilation makes it certain that such 
processes occur also between reproduced elements, in such a 
way that any memory-idea which arises in our mind is im- 
mediately modified by its interaction with other memory- 
elements. Still, in such a case we have, of course, no means 
of demonstration. All that can be established as probable 
is that even in the case of so-called “pure memory-processes” 
direct elements in the form of sensations and sense-feelings 
aroused by peripheral stimuli, are never entirely absent. In 
reproduced visual images, for example, such elements are 
present in the form of sensations of ocular position and 
movement. 
b. Complications. 
12. Complications, or the combinations between unlike 
psychical compounds, are no less regular components of con- 
sciousness than are assimilations. Just as there is hardly an 
intensive or extensive idea or composite feeling which is not 
modified in some way through the processes of reciprocal: 
assimilation with memory-elements, so almost every one of 
these compounds is at the same time connected with other, 
dissimilar compounds, with which it has some constant rela- 
tions. In all cases, however, complications are different from 
assimilations in the fact that the unlikeness of the compounds 
makes the connection looser, however regular it may be, so 
that when one component is direct and the other reproduced, 
the latter can be readily distinguished at once. Still, there 
is another reason which makes the product of a complication
-P-A-G-E-253
   § 16. Associations. 235 
appear unitary in spite of the easily recognized difference 
between its components. This cause is the predominance of 
one of the compounds, which pushes the other components in- 
to the obscurer field of consciousness. 
If the complication unites a direct impression with mem- 
ory-elements of disparate character, the direct impression 
with its assimilations is regularly the predominant com- 
ponent, while the reproduced elements sometimes have 
a noticeable influence only through their affective tone. 
Thus, when we speak, the auditory word-ideas are the 
predominant components, and in addition we have as ob- 
scure factors direct motor sensations and reproductions of 
the visual images of the words. In reading, on the other 
hand, the visual images come to the front while the rest 
become weaker. In general it may be said that the existence 
of a complication is frequently noticeable only through the 
peculiar coloring of the total feeling that accompanies the 
predominant idea. This is due to the ability of obscure ideas 
to have a relatively intense effect on the attention through 
their affective tones (p. 216). Thus, for example, the 
characteristic impression of a rough surface, a dagger-point, 
or a gun, arises from a complication of visual and tactual 
impressions, and in the last: case of auditory impressions as 
well; but as a rule such complications are noticeable only 
through the feelings they excite. 
B. SUCCESSIVE ASSOCIATIONS. 
13. Successive association is by no means a process that 
differs essentially from the two forms of simultaneous asso- 
ciation, assimilation and complication. It is, on the contrary, 
due to the same general causes as these, and differs only in 
the secondary characteristic that the process of combination,
-P-A-G-E-254
  236 IIT. Interconnection of Psychical Compounds. 
which in the former cases consisted, so far as immediate 
introspection was concerned, of a single instantaneous act, 
is here protracted and may therefore be readily divided into 
two acts. The first of these acts corresponds to the appearance 
of the reproducing elements, the second to the appearance of 
the reproduced elements. Here too, the first act is often 
introduced by an external sense-impression, which is as 
a rule immediately united with an assimilation. Other re- 
productive elements which might enter into an assimilation 
or complication are held back through some inhibitory in- 
fluence or other — as, for example, through other assimilations 
that force themselves earlier on apperception — and do not 
begin to exercise an influence until later. In this way we 
have a second act of apperception clearly distinct from the 
first, and differing from it in sensational content the more 
essentially the more numerous the new elements are which 
are added through the retarded assimilation and complication 
and the more these new elements tend to displace the earlier 
because of their different character. 
14. In the great majority of cases the association thus 
formed is limited to two successive ideational or affective 
processes connected, in the manner described, through assim- 
ilations or complications. New sense-impressions or some 
apperceptive combinations (§ 17) may then connect themselves 
with the second member of the association. Less frequently 
it happens that the same processes which led to the first 
division of an assimilation or complication into a successive 
process, may be repeated with the second or even with the 
third member, so that in this way we have a whole associa- 
tional series. Still, this takes place generally only under ex- 
ceptional conditions, especially when the normal course of 
apperception has been disturbed, as, for example, in the so- 
called “flight of ideas” of the insane. In normal cases -such  
-P-A-G-E-255
$16. Associations. 237 
serial associations, that is, associations with more than two 
members, hardly ever appear. 
14a. Such serial associations may be produced most easily 
under the artificial conditions of experimentation, when the effort 
is purposely made to suppress new sensible impressions and 
apperceptive combinations. But the process resulting in such 
cases differs from that described above in that the successive 
members of the series do not connect, each with its immediate 
predecessor, but all go back to the first, until a new sense-im- 
pression or an idea with an especially strong affective tone furnishes 
a new starting point for the succeeding associations. The associa- 
tions in the “flight of ideas” of the insane generally show the 
same type of returning to certain predominant centres. 
a. Sensible Recognition and+ Cognition. 
15. The way in which the ordinary form of association, 
made up of two partial processes, may be most clearly ob- 
served, is in the simultaneous assimilations and complications of 
sensible recognition and cognition. The qualification “sensible” 
is added when referring to these associative processes, to 
indicate, on the one hand, that the first member of the pro- 
cess is always a sense-impression, and, on the other, to 
distinguish these from the logical processes of cognition. 
The psychologically simplest case of recognition is that 
in which an object has been perceived — for example, seen 
— only once and is recognized as the same when met a second 
time. If this second perception follows very soon after the 
first, or if the first was especially emphatic and exciting, 
the association usually takes place immediately as a simul- 
taneous assimilation. This process differs from other assimi- 
lations, which take place in connection with every sense- 
perception, only in the characteristic accompanying feeling, 
the feeling of familiarity. Such a feeling is never present 
except when there is some degree of “consciousness” that the  
-P-A-G-E-256
238 III. Interconnection of Psychical Compounds. 
impression has already been received before. It is, therefore, 
evidently one of those feelings which comes from the ideas 
obscurely present in consciousness. The psychological difference 
between this and an ordinary simultaneous assimilation must 
be looked for in the fact that at the moment when, in the 
apperception of the impression, the assimilation takes place, 
there arise in the obscure regions of consciousness some 
components of the original idea which do not enter into the 
assimilation. Their relation to the elements of the idea that 
is apperceived finds expression in the feeling’ of familiarity. 
The unassimilated components may be elements of the earlier 
impression that were so different from certain elements of 
the new that they could not be assimilated, or, and this is 
especially often the case, they may be complications that 
were clear before, but now remain unobserved. This influence 
of complication explains how it is that the name of a visual 
object, for example the proper names of persons, and often 
other auditory qualities, such as the tone of voice, are very 
great helps in the recognition. To serve as such helps, 
however, they need not necessarily be clear ideas in con- 
sciousness. When we have heard a man’s name, the recog- 
nition of the man the next time we meet him may be aided 
by the name without our calling it clearly to mind. 
15a. This influence of complications may be demonstrated 
experimentally. If we take a number of disks that are alike in 
all other respects, but differ in color from white through various 
shades of grey to black, and present them to view once, so long 
as only five shades are used (white, black, and three shades of 
grey) each disk can be easily recognized again. But when more 
shades are used, this is no longer possible. It is very natural 
to surmise that this fact is related to the existence of five familiar 
names, white, light grey, grey, dark grey and black. This view 
is confirmed by the fact that by purposely using a larger number 
of names more shades (even as many as nine) are recognized. In 
 
-P-A-G-E-257
§ 16, Associations. 239 
such experiments the complication may be clearly observed, but 
it is not necessarily so, expecially for the five ordinary shades. 
As a rule the name is here thought of after the act of recognition 
proper is passed. 
16. The observations discussed also show what the con- 
ditions are under which a recognition may pass from a simul- 
taneous to a succcessive association. If a certain interval 
elapses before the elements of the earlier idea which gradually 
rise in consciousness, can produce a distinct feeling of 
familiarity, the whole process divides into two acts: into 
the perception and the recognition. The first is connected 
with the ordinary simultaneous assimilations only, while in 
the second the obscure, unassimilated elements of the earlier 
idea show their influence. The division between the parts is, 
accordingly, more distinct the greater the difference between the 
earlier impression and the new one. In such # case, not only 
is there usually a long period of noticeable inhibition between 
perception and recognition, but certain additional apper- 
ceptive processes, namely the processes of voluntary attention 
that take place in the state of recollection, also come to the aid 
of the association. As a special form of this kind of process 
we have the phenomenon called “mediate recognition”. This 
consists in the recognition of an object, not through its own 
attributes, but through some accompanying mark or other, 
which stands in a chance connection with it, as, for example, 
when a person is recognized because of his companion. Be- 
tween such a case and a case of immediate recognition there 
is no essential psychological difference. For even those charac- 
teristics that do not belong to the recognized object in itself, 
still belong to the whole complex of ideational elements that 
help in the preparation and final carrying out of the association. 
And yet, as we should naturally expect, the retardation which 
divides the whole recognition into two ideational processes,
-P-A-G-E-258
240 III. Interconnection of Psychical Compounds. 
and often leads to the cooperation of voluntary recollection, 
generally appears in its most evident form in mediate 
recognitions. 
17. This simple process of recognition which takes place 
when we meet again an object that has been perceived once 
before, is a starting point for the development of various 
other associative processes, both those which like itself stand 
on the boundary between simultaneous and successive asso- 
ciations, and those in which the retardation in the formation 
of assimilations and complications that leads to the successive 
processes, is still more clearly marked. Thus, the recognition 
of an object that has often been perceived is easier and, 
therefore, as a rule an instantaneous process, which is also 
more like the ordinary assimilation because the feeling of 
familiarity is much less intense. Sensible cognition differs 
generally but little from the recognition of single familiar ob- 
jects. The logical distinction between the two concepts consists 
in the fact that recognition means the establishment of the 
individual identity of the newly perceived with a formerly 
perceived object, while cognition is the subsumption of an 
object under a familiar concept. Still, there is no real logical 
subsumption in a process of sensible cognition any more than 
there is a fully developed class-concept under which the sub- 
sumption could be made. The psychological equivalent of 
such a subsumption is to be found in this case in the mere 
process of relating the impression in question to an in- 
definitely large number of objects. This presupposes an earlier 
perception of various objects which agree only in certain 
particular properties, so that the process of cognition ap- 
proaches the ordinary assimilation more and more in its psy- 
chological character the more familiar the class to which the 
perceived object belongs, and the more it agrees with the 
general characteristics of the class. In equal measure the
-P-A-G-E-259
§ 16. Associations. 241 
feelings peculiar to the processes of cognition and recognition 
decrease and finally disappear entirely, so that when we 
meet very familiar objects we do not speak of a cognition 
at all. The process of cognition becomes evident only when 
the assimilation is hindered in some way, either because the 
perception of the class of objects in question has become 
unusual, or because the single object shows some unique 
characteristics. In such a case the simultaneous association 
may become successive by the separation of perception and 
cognition into two successive processes. Just in proportion 
as this happens, we have a specific feeling of cognition which 
is indeed related to the feeling of familiarity, but, as a result 
of the different conditions for the rise of the two, differs from 
it, especially in its temporal course. 
b. Memory-processes. 
18. Essentially different is the direction along which the 
simple process of recognition develops, when the hindrances 
to immediate assimilation which give rise to the transition from 
simultaneous to successive association are great enough, so 
that the ideational elements which do not agree with the new 
perception unite — either after the recognition has taken place 
or even when there is no such recognition whatever — to form 
a special idea referred directly to an earlier impression. The 
process that arises under such circumstances is a memory- 
process and the idea that is perceived is a memory-idea, or 
memory-image. 
18a. Memory-processes were the ones to which association- 
psychology generally limited the application of the concept: asso- 
ciation. But, as has been shown, these are associations that take 
place under especially complicated conditions. An understanding 
of the genesis of association was thus rendered impossible from 
Wonpt, Psychology. 16
-P-A-G-E-260
  242 IIT. Interconnection of Psychical Compounds. 
the first, and it is easy to see that the doctrine accepted by the 
associationists is limited essentially to a logical rather than a psy- 
chological classification of the different kinds of association that are 
to be observed in memory-processes. A knowledge of these more 
complex processes is possible, however, only through a study start- 
ing with the simpler associative processes, for the ordinary simul- 
taneous assimilations and simultaneous and successive recognitions 
present themselves very naturally as the antecedents of memory- 
associations. But even simultaneous recognition itself is nothing but 
an assimilation accompanied by a feeling which comes from the un- 
assimilated ideational elements obscurely present in consciousness. 
In the second process these unassimilated elements serve to retard 
the process, so that the recognition develops into the primitive 
form of successive association. The impression is at first assimi- 
lated in the ordinary way, and then again in a second act with 
an accompanying feeling of recognition which serves to indicate 
the greater influence of certain reproduced elements. In this 
simple form of successive association the two successive ideas are 
referred to one and the same object, the only difference being that 
each time some different ideational and affective elements are 
apperceived. With memory-associations the case is essentially 
different. Here the heterogeneous elements of the earlier im- 
pressions predominate, and the first assimilation of the impression 
is followed by the formation of an idea made up of elements of 
the impression and also of those belonging to earlier impressions, 
that are suitable for the assimilation because of certain of their 
components. The more the heterogeneous elements predominate, 
the more is the second idea different from the first, or, on the 
other hand, the more the like elements predominate, the more 
the two ideas will be alike. In any case the second idea is 
always a reproduced idea and distinct from the new impression as 
an independent compound. 
19. The general conditions for the rise of memory-images 
may exhibit shades and differences which run parallel to the 
forms of recognition and cognition discussed above. Various 
modifications of the memory-processes may arise from the 
different kinds of ordinary assimilation that we become
-P-A-G-E-261
  $ 16. Associations. 243 
acquainted with above (15, 17), as the recognition of an object 
perceived once and that of an object familiar through frequent 
perceptions, and also from the cognition of a subject that 
is familiar in its general class-characteristics. 
Simple recognition becomes a memory-process when the 
immediate assimilation of the impression is hindered by ele- 
ments that belong not to the object itself, but to circumstances 
that attended its earlier perception. Just because the former 
perception occurred only once, or at least only once so far 
as the reproduction is concerned, these accompanying elements 
may be relatively clear and distinct and sharply distinguished 
from the surroundings of the new impression. In this way 
we have first of all transitional forms between recognition and 
remembering: the object is recognized, and at the same time 
referred to a particular earlier sense-perception whose accom- 
panying circumstances add a definite spacial and temporal 
relation to the memory-image. The memory-process is especially 
predominant in those cases where the element of the new im- 
pression that gave rise to the assimilation is entirely suppressed 
by the other components of the image, so that the associative 
relation between the memory-idea and the impression may 
remain completely unnoticed. 
19a. Such cases have been spoken of as “mediate memories”, 
or “mediate associations”. Still, just as with “mediate recognitions” 
we are, here too, dealing with processes that are fundamentally 
the same as ordinary associations. Take, for example, the case 
of a person who, sitting in his room at evening, suddenly re- 
members without any apparent reason a landscape that he passed 
through many years before; examination shows that there happened 
to be in the room a fragrant flower which he saw for the first 
time in that landscape. The difference between this and an 
ordinary memory-process in which the connection of the new im- 
pression with an earlier experience is clearly recognized, obviously 
consists in the fact that here the elements which recall the idea 
16*
-P-A-G-E-262
  244 III. Interconnection of Psychical Compounds. 
are pushed into the obscure background of consciousness by 
other ideational elements. The not infrequent experience, com- 
monly known as the “spontaneous rise” of ideas, in which a 
memory-image suddenly appears in our mind without any assignable 
cause, is in all probability reducible in every case to such latent 
associations. 
20. Memory-processes that develop from recognitions 
which have been often repeated and from cognitions, are in 
consequence of the greater complexity of their conditions, 
different from those connected with the recognition of objects 
perceived but once. When we perceive an object that is familiar 
either in its own individual characteristics or in those of its 
class, the range of possible associations is incomparably 
greater, and the way in which the memory-processes shall 
arise from a particular impression depends less on the single 
experiences that give rise to the association, than it does on 
the general disposition and momentary mood of consciousness 
and especially on the interference of certain active apperceptive 
processes and the intellectual feelings and emotions that are 
connected with them. When the conditions are so various, 
it is easy to see that as a general thing it is impossible to 
calculate beforehand what the association will be. As soon 
as the act of memory is ended, however, the traces of its 
associative origin seldom escape careful examination, so that 
we are justified in regarding association as the universal and 
only cause of memory-processes under all circumstances. 
21. In thus deriving memory from association, it is never 
to be forgotten that every concrete memory-process is by 
no means a simple process, but is made up of a large number 
of elementary processes, as is apparent from the fact that it is 
produced by a psychological development of its simple ante- 
cedents, namely, the simultaneous assimilations. The most im- 
portant of these elementary processes is the assimilative 
 
-P-A-G-E-263
§ 16. Associations. 245 
interaction between some external impression and the elements 
of an earlier psychical compound, or between a memory-image 
already present and such elements. Connected with this there 
are two other processes that are characteristic for memory- 
processes: one is the hindrance of the assimilation by unlike 
elements, the other the assimilations and complications con- 
nected with these elements and giving rise to a psychical 
compound which differs from the first impression and is referred 
more or less definitely to some previous experience, especially 
through its complications. This reference to the earlier ex- 
perience shows itself through a characteristic feeling, the 
feeling of remembering, which is related to the feeling of 
familiarity, but is in its temporal genesis characteristically 
different, probably in consequence of the greater number of 
obscure complications that accompany the appearance of the 
memory-image. 
If we try to find the elementary processes to which both 
memory-processes and all complex associations are reducible, 
we shall find two kinds, combinations from édentity and from 
contiguity. In general the first class is predominant when 
the process is more like an ordinary assimilation and recog- 
nition, while the second appears more prominently the more 
the processes approach mediate memory in character, that is, 
the more they take on the semblance of spontaneous ideas. 
21a. It is obvious that the usual classification, which makes 
all memory-processes associations by either similarity or contiguity, 
is entirely unsuitable if we attempt to apply it to the modes of 
psychological genesis that these processes manifest. On the other 
hand, it is too general and indefinite if we try to classify the 
processes logically according to their products, without reference 
to their genesis. In the latter case the various relations of sub- 
ordination, superordination, and coordination, of cause and end, 
of temporal succession and existence, and the various kinds 
of spacial connection, find only inadequate expression in the very 
   
-P-A-G-E-264
  246 II. Interconnection of Psychical Compounds. 
general concepts “similarity” and “contiguity”. When, on the 
other hand, the manner of origin is studied, every memory-process 
is found to be made up of elementary processes that may be called 
partly associations by similarity, partly associations by contiguity. 
The assimilations which serve to introduce the process and also those 
which serve to bring about the reference to a particular earlier ex- 
perience at its close, may be called associations by similarity. But 
the term “similarity” is not exactly suitable even here, because it is 
identical elementary processes that give rise to the assimilation, and 
when such an identity does not exist, it is always produced by the 
reciprocal assimilation. In fact, the concept of “association by 
similarity” is based on the presupposition that composite ideas 
are permanent psychical objects and that associations take place 
between these finished ideas. The concept itself must be rejected 
when once this presupposition is given up as entirely contradictory 
to psychical experience and fatal to a proper understanding of 
the same. When certain products of association, as, for example, 
two successive memory-images, are similar, this likeness is always 
reducible to processes of assimilation made up of elementary 
combinations through identity or contiguity. The association 
through identity may take place either between components that 
were originally the same, or between those that have gained this 
character through assimilation. Association by contiguity is the 
form of combination between those elements that hinder the 
assimilation, thus dividing the whole process into a succession of 
two processes, and also contributing to the memory-image those 
components which give it the character of an independent com- 
pound different from that of the impression which gave rise to it. 
22. The character of memory-ddeas is intimately connected 
with the complex nature of the memory-processes. The de- 
scription of these ideas as weaker, but otherwise faithful, 
copies of the direct sensible idea, is as far out of the way 
as it could possibly be. Memory-images and direct sensible 
ideas differ not only in quality and intensity, but most 
emphatically in their elementary composition. We may 
diminish the intensity of a sensible impression as much as
-P-A-G-E-265
$16. Associations. 247 
we like, but so long as it is perceptible at all.it is an essen- 
tially different compound from a memory-idea. The tcom- 
pleteness of the memory-idea is much more characteristic 
than the small intensity of its sensational elements. For 
example, when I remember an acquaintance, the image I have 
of his face and figure are not mere obscure reproductions of 
what I have in consciousness when I look directly at him, 
but most of the features do not exist at all in the repro- 
duced ideas. Connected with the few ideational elements 
that are really present and that can be but little increased 
in number even when the attention is intentionally concen- 
trated upon the task, are a series of combinations through 
contiguity and of complications, such as the environments in 
which I saw my acquaintance, his name, finally and more 
especially, certain affective elements that were present at the 
meeting. These accompanying components are what make 
the image a memory-image. 
23. There are great dividual differences in the effec- 
tiveness of. these accompanying elements and in the distinct- 
ness of the sensational elements of the memory-image. Some 
persons locate their memory-images in space and time much 
more precisely than others do; the ability to remember colors 
and tones is also exceedingly different. Very few persons 
seem to have distinct memories for odors and tastes; in place 
of these we have, as substitute complications, accompanying 
motor sensations of the nose and taste-organs. 
These various different functions connected with the pro- 
cesses of recognition and remembering are all included under 
the name “memory”. This concept does not, of course, refer 
to any unitary psychical force, as faculty-psychology assumed 
(p. 11), still, it is a useful supplementary concept in empha- 
sizing the differences between different individuals. We speak 
of a faithful, comprehensive, and easy memory, or of a good
-P-A-G-E-266
  248 IIL. Interconnection of Psychical Compounds. 
spacial, temporal, and verbal memory, etc. These expressions 
serve to point out the different directions in which, according 
to the original disposition or habit of the person, the elemen- 
tary assimilations and complications occur. 
One important phenomenon among the various differences 
referred to, is the gradual weakening of memory with old age. 
The disturbances resulting from diseases of the brain agree 
in general with this phenomenon. Both are of special im- 
portance to psychology because they exhibit very clearly the 
influence of complications on memory-processes. One of the 
most striking symptoms of failing memory, in both normal 
and pathological cases, is the weakening of verbal memory. 
It generally appears as a lack of ability to remember, first 
proper names, then names of concrete objects in the ordi- 
nary environments, still later abstract words, and finally 
particles that are entirely abstract in character. This suc- 
cession corresponds exactly to the possibility of substituting 
in consciousness for single classes of words other ideas that 
are regularly connected with them through complication. This 
possibility it obviously greatest for proper names, and least 
for abstract particles, which can be retained only through their 
verbal signs. 
§ 17. APPERCEPTIVE COMBINATIONS. 
1. Associations in all their forms and also the closely 
related processes of fusion that give rise to psychical com- 
pounds, are regarded by us as passive experiences, because 
the feeling of activity, which is characteristic for all pro- 
cesses of volition and attention, never appears except in 
connection with the apperception of the completed product, 
presented as a result of the combination (cf. p. 217). Asso- 
ciations are, accordingly, processes that can arouse volitions,
-P-A-G-E-267
  § 17. Apperceptive Combinations. 249 
but are not themselves directly influenced by volitions. This 
is, however, the criterion of a passive process. 
The case is essentially different with the second kind of 
combinations that are formed between different psychical 
compounds and their elements, the apperceptive combinations. 
Here the feeling of activity with its accompanying variable 
sensations of tension does not merely follow the combinations 
as an after-effect produced by them, but it precedes them 
so that the combinations themselves are immediately recognixed 
as formed with the aid of the attention. In this sense they are 
called active experiences. 
2. Apperceptive combinations include a large number of 
psychical processes that are distinguished in popular parlance 
under the general terms thinking, reflection, imagination, 
understanding, etc. These are all regarded as higher psy- 
chical processes than sense-perceptions or pure memory-pro- 
cesses, still, they are all looked upon as different from one 
another. Especially is this true of the so-called functions 
of imagination and understanding. In contrast with this loose 
view of popular psychology and of the faculty-theory, which 
followed in its tracks, association-psychology sought to find 
a unitary principle by subsuming the apperceptive combina- 
tions of ideas also under the general concept of association, 
at the same time limiting the concept, as noted above (p. 224), 
to successive association. This reduction to association was 
effected either by neglecting the essential subjective afd ob- 
jective distinguishing marks of apperceptive combinations, or by 
attempting to avoid the difficulties of an explanation, through 
the introduction .of certain supplementary concepts taken from 
popular psychology. Thus, “interest” or “intelligence” was 
credited with an influence on associations. Very often this 
view was based on the erroneous notion that the recognition 
of certain distinguishing features in apperceptive combinations
-P-A-G-E-268
  250 III. Interconnection of Psychical Compounds. 
and associations meant the assertion of an absolute indepen- 
dence of the former from the latter. Of course, this is not 
true. All psychical processes are connected with associations 
as much as with the original sense-perceptions. Yet, just as 
associations always form a part of every sense-perception and 
in spite of that appear in memory-processes as relatively 
independent processes, so apperceptive combinations are based 
entirely on associations, but their essential attributes are not 
traceable to these associations. 
3. If we try to account for the essential attributes of 
apperceptive combinations, we may first of all divide the 
psychical processes that. belong to this class into simple and 
complex apperceptive functions. The simple functions are those 
of relating and comparing, the complex those of synthesis 
and analysis. 
A. SIMPLE APPERCEPTIVE FUNCTIONS. 
(Relating and Comparing.) 
4. The most elementary apperceptive function is the 
relating of two psychical contents to each other. The grounds 
for such relating is always given in the single psychical com- 
pounds and their associations, but the actual carrying out 
of the process itself is a special apperceptive activity through 
which the relation itself becomes a special conscious content 
distinct from the contents which are related, though indeed 
inseparably connected with them. For example, when we 
recognize the identity of an object with one perceived before, 
or when we are conscious of a definite relation between a 
remembered event and a present impression, there is in both 
cases a relating apperceptive activity connected with the 
associations. 
_ Bo long as the recognition remains a pure association, the 
process of relating is limited to the feeling of familiarity that
-P-A-G-E-269
$17. Apperceptive Combinations. 251 
follows the assimilation of the new impression either immediately 
or after a short interval. When, on the contrary, apper- 
ception is added to association, this feeling is supplied with 
a clearly recognized ideational substratum. The earlier per- 
ception and the new impression are separated in time and 
then brought into a relation of identity on the basis of their 
essential attributes. The case is similar when we are con- 
scious of the motives of a memory-act. This also presupposes 
that a comparison of the memory-image with the impression 
that occasioned it, be added to the merely associative process 
which gave rise to the image. This, again, is a process that 
can be brought about only through active attention. 
5. Thus, the relating function is brought into activity 
through associations, wherever they themselves or their products 
are made the objects of voluntary observation. This function 
is always connected, as the examples mentioned show, with 
the function of comparing, so that the two must be regarded 
as.interdependent partial functions. Every act of relating 
includes a comparison of the related psychical contents, and 
a comparison is, in turn, possible only through the relating 
of the contents compared with one another. The only difference 
is that in many cases the comparison is completely subordinated 
to the end of reciprocally relating the contents, while in others 
it is in itself the end. We speak of a process of relating in 
the strict sense in the first case, and of a process of com- 
paring in the second. I call it relating when I think of a 
present impression as the reason for remembering an earlier 
experience; I call it comparing, on the other hand, when 
I establish certain definite points of agreement or difference 
between the earlier and the present event. 
6. The process of comparing is, in turn, made up of two 
elementary functions which are as a rule intimately inter- 
connected: of the perception of agreements on the one hand,  
-P-A-G-E-270
  252 IIL. Interconnection of Psychical Compounds. 
and of differences on the other. The erroneous view still finds 
frequent acceptance that the existence of psychical elements 
and compounds is the same as their apperceptive comparison. 
The two are to be held completely apart. Of course, there must 
be agreements and differences in our psychical processes them- 
selves, or we could not perceive them; still the comparing 
activity by which we perceive, is different from the agree- 
ments and differences themselves and additional to them. 
7. Psychical elements, the sensations and simple feelings, 
are compared in regard to their agreements and differences 
and thus brought into definite systems, each of which contains 
such elements as are closely related. Within such a system, 
especially a sensational system, two kinds of comparison are 
possible: that in respect to quality, and that in respect to 
éntensity. Then, too, a comparison between grades of clear- 
ness is possible when attention is paid to the way in which 
the elements appear in consciousness. In the same way com- 
parison is applied to intensive and extensive psychical com- 
pounds. Every psychical element and every psychical compound, 
in so far as it isa member of a regular graded system, con- 
stitutes a psychical quantity. A determination of the value 
of such a quantity is possible only through its comparison 
with some other quantity of the same system. Quantity is, 
accordingly, an original attribute of every psychical element 
and compound. It is of various kinds, as intensity, quality, 
extensive (spacial and temporal) value, and, when the different 
states of consciousness are considered, clearness. But the 
determination of quantity can be effected only through the 
apperceptive funetion of comparison. 
8. Psychical measurement differs from physical measure- 
ment in the fact that the latter may be carried out in 
acts of comparison separated almost indefinitely in time, 
because its objects are relatively constant. For example,
-P-A-G-E-271
  
$17. Apperceptive Combinations. 253 
we can determine the height of a certain mountain to-day 
with a barometer and then after a long time the height 
of another mountain, and if no sensible changes in the con- 
figuration of the land have taken place in the interval, we 
can compare the results of our two measurements. Psychical 
compounds, on the other hand, are not relatively permanent 
objects, but continually changing processes, so that we can 
compare two such psychical quantities only under the con- 
dition that they are presented in immediate succession. This 
condition has as its immediate corollaries: first, that there is 
no absolute standard for the comparison of psychical quan- 
tities, but every such comparison stands by itself and is 
of merely relative value; secondly, that finer comparisons are 
possible only between quantities of the same dimension, so 
that a transfer analogous to that by which the most widely 
separate physical quantities, such as periods of time and 
physical forces, are reduced to spacial quantities of one 
dimension, are out of the question in psychical comparisons. 
9. It follows that not every relation between psychical 
quantities can be established by direct comparison, but this 
is possible only for certain particularly favorable relations. 
These favorable cases are 1) the equality between two psy- 
chical quantities, and 2) the just noticeable difference between 
two such quantities, as, for example, two sensational inten- 
sities of like quality, or two qualities of like intensity belonging 
to the same dimension. As a somewhat more complex case 
which still lies within the limits of immediate comparison we 
have 3) the equality of two differences between quantities, 
especially when these quantities belong to contiguous parts 
of the same system. It is obvious that in each of these 
three kinds of psychical measurements the two fundamental 
functions in apperceptive comparison, the perception of agree- 
ments and of differences, are both applied together. In the
-P-A-G-E-272
  254 IIl. Interconnection of Psychical Compounds. 
first case the second of two psychical quantities A and B 
is gradually varied until it agrees for immediate comparison 
with A. In the second case A and B are taken equal at 
first and then B is changed until it appears either just 
noticeably greater or just noticeably smaller than A. Finally, 
the third case is used to the greatest advantage when a 
whole line of psychical quantities, as, for example, of sen- 
sational intensities, extending from A as a lower to C as an 
upper limit, is so divided by a middle quantity B, which 
has been found by gradual variations, that the partial distance 
AB is apperceived as equal to BC. 
10. The most direct and most easily utilizable results 
derived from these methods of comparison are given by the 
second method, or the method of minimal differences as it is 
called. The difference between the physical stimuli which 
corresponds to the just noticeable difference between psychical 
quantities is called the difference-threshold of the stimulus. 
The stimulus from which the resulting psychical process, for 
example, a sensation, can be just apperceived, is called the 
stimulus-threshold. Observation shows that the difference- 
threshold of the stimulus increases in proportion to the distance 
from the stimulus-threshold, in such a way that the relation 
between the difference-threshold and the absolute quantity 
of the stimulus, or the relative difference-threshold, remains 
constant. If, for example, a certain sound whose intensity 
is 1 must be increased 4 in order that the sensation may 
be just noticeably greater, one whose intensity is 2 must be 
increased 2, one 3, 3, etc., to reach the difference-threshold. 
This law is called Weber's law, after its discoverer E. H. Weber. 
It is easily understood when we look upon it as a law of 
apperceptive comparison. From this point of view it must 
obviously be interpreted to mean that psychical quantities are 
.compared according to their relative values.
-P-A-G-E-273
  $17. Apperceptive Combinations. 255 
This view that Weber's law is an expression of the general 
law of the relativity of psychical quantities, assumes that 
the psychical quantities that are compared, themselves in- 
crease in proportion to their stimuli within the limits of the 
validity of the law. It has not yet been possible to demon- 
strate the truth of this assumption on its physiological side, 
on account of the difficulties of measuring exactly the stimu- 
lation of nerves and sense-organs. Still, we have evidence 
in favor of it in the psychological experience that in certain 
special cases, where the conditions of observation lead very 
naturally to a comparison of absolute differences in quan- 
tity, the absolute difference-threshold, instead of the relative 
threshold, is found to be constant. We have such a case, 
for example, in the comparison, within wide limits, of minimal 
differences in pitch. Then, too, in many cases where large 
differences in sensations are compared according to the 
third method described above (p. 254), equal absolute stimuli- 
differences, not relative differences, are perceived as equal. 
This shows that apperceptive comparison follows éwo different 
principles under different conditions: a principle of relative 
comparison that finds its expression in Weber’s law and must 
be regarded as the more general, and a principle of absolute 
comparison of differences which takes the place of the first under 
special conditions which favor such a form of apperception. 
10a. Weber’s law has been shown to hold, first of all, for the 
intensity of sensations and then, within certain limits, for the com- 
parison of extensive compounds, especially temporal ideas, also, to 
some extent, for spacial ideas of sight and for motor ideas. On 
the other hand, it does not hold for the spacial ideas of external 
touch, obviously on account of the complexity of the local signs 
(p. 105); and it can not be verified for sensational qualities. In 
fact, for the comparison of pitches the absolute, not the relative 
difference-threshold is constant within wide limits. Still, the scale 
of tonal intervals is relative, for every interval corresponds to a 
 
-P-A-G-E-274
  256 II. Interconnection of Psychical Compounds. 
certain ratio between the number of vibrations (for example, an 
octave 1:2, a fifth 2:3, etc.). This is probably due to the 
relationship between clangs which is due to the relation of the 
fundamental tone to its overtones (comp. p. 95 sq.). Even 
where an absolute comparison takes place instead of a comparison 
according to Weber’s law of relativity, we must not, of course, 
confuse this with the establishment of an absolute measure. That 
would presuppose an absolute unit, that is, the possibility of 
finding a constant standard, which, as noted above (p. 253), is in 
the psychical world impossible. Absolute comparison must take 
the form of a recognition of the equality of equal absolute 
differences. This is possible in the various single cases without 
a constant unit. Thus, for example, we compare two sensational 
lines AB and BC according to their relative values, when we 
think in both cases of the relation of the upper to the lower 
extreme sensation. In such a case we judge AB and BC to be 
equal when = = e (Weber’s law). On the other hand, we com- 
pare AB and BC according to their absolute values when the 
difference between C and B in the single sensational dimension 
in question appears equal to that between B and A, that is, when 
C— B= B— A (law of proportionality). Weber’s law has some- 
times been regarded as the expression of the functional relation 
between sensation and stimulus, and it has been assumed that the 
law holds for infinitely small changes on both sides. On this 
basis there has been given to it the mathematical form of the 
logarithmic function: sensation increases in proportion to the 
logarithm of the stimulus (Fechner’s psycho-physical law). 
The ‘methods for the demonstration of Weber’s law, or of other 
relations between psychical quantities, whether elementary or 
compound, are usually called psycho-physical methods. The name 
is unsuitable, however, because the fact that physical means are 
here employed is not unique, but holds for all the methods of 
experimental psychology. ‘They could better be called “methods 
for the measurement of psychical quantites”. With these methods 
it is possible to follow one of two courses in finding the 
relations mentioned as favorable for judgment. A first or 
direct mode of procedure is as follows: one of two psychical’ 
quantities A and B, as, for example, A, is kept constant, and B is
-P-A-G-E-275
$17. Apperceptive Combinations. 257 
gradually varied until it stands in one of the relations mentioned, 
that is, either equals A or is just noticeably greater or smaller, 
etc. These are the adjustment-methods. Among these we have 
as the method most frequently applied and that which leads 
most directly to conclusions, the “method of minimal changes”, 
and then as a kind of modification of this for the case of ad- 
justment until equality is reached, the “method of average error”. 
The second mode of procedure is to compare in a large number 
of cases any two stimuli, A and B, which are very little different, 
and to reckon from the number of cases in which the judgments 
are A= B, A>B, A<B, the position of the relations men- 
tioned, especially the difference-threshold. These are the reckoning- 
methods. The chief of these is the method known as that of 
“right and wrong cases”. It would be more proper to call it the 
“method of three cases” (equality, positive difference, and negative 
difference). Details as to this and the other methods belong in a 
special treatise on experimental psychology. 
There are two other interpretations of Weber’s law still met 
with besides the psychological interpretation given above; they may 
be called the physiological and the psycho-physical theories. The 
first derives the law trom hypothetically assumed relations in the 
conduction of excitations in the central nervous system. The second 
regards the law as a specific law of the “interaction between 
body and mind”. The physiological interpretation is entirely 
hypothetical and in certain cases, as, for example, for temporal 
and spacial ideas, entirely inapplicable. ‘The psycho-physical 
interpretation is based upon a view of the relation of mind which 
must be rejected by the psychology of to-day (cf. § 22, Ss). 
11. As special cases in the class of apperceptive com- 
parisons generally falling under Weber’s law we have the 
comparison of quantities that are the relatively greatest sen- 
sational differences or, when dealing with feelings, opposites. 
The phenomena that appear in such cases are usually gathered 
up in the class-name contrasts. In the department where 
contrasts have been most thoroughly investigated, in visual 
sensations, there is generally an utter lack of discrimination 
Wexpr, Psychology. 17
-P-A-G-E-276
258 III. Interconnection of Psychical Compounds. 
between two phenomena which are obviously entirely different 
in origin, though the results are to a certain extent related. 
We may distinguish these as physiological and psychological 
contrasts. Physiological contrasts are closely connected with 
the phenomena of after-images, perhaps they are the same 
(p. 68 sq.). Psychological contrasts are essentially different; 
they are usually pushed into the background by the stronger 
physiological contrasts when the impressions are more intense. 
They are distinguished from the physiological by two important 
characteristics. First, they do not reach their greatest intensity 
when the brightness and saturation are greatest, but when 
they are at the medium stages, where the eye is most sen- 
sitive to changes in brightness and saturation. Secondly, they 
can be removed by comparison with an independent object. 
Especially the latter characteristic shows these contrasts to 
be unqualifiedly the products of comparisons. Thus, for 
example, when a grey square is laid on a black ground and 
close by a similar grey square is laid on a white ground and 
all is covered with transparent paper, the two squares appear 
entirely different; the one on the black ground looks bright, 
nearly white, that on the white ground looks dark, nearly 
black. Now after-images and irradiations are very weak when 
the brightness of the objects is small, so that it may be 
assumed that the phenomenon described is a psychological 
contrast. If, again, a strip of black cardboard which is also 
covered with the transparent paper, and therefore appears 
exactly the same grey as the two squares, is held in such a 
way that it connects the two squares the contrast will be 
removed entirely, or, at least, very much diminished. If in this 
experiment a colored ground is used instead of the achromatic, 
the grey square will appear very clearly in the appropriate com- 
plementary color. But here, too, the contrast can be made to 
disappear through comparison with an independent grey object. 
 
-P-A-G-E-277
  $17. Apperceptive Combinations. 259 
12. Psychical contrasts appear also in other spheres of 
sensation so far as the conditions for their demonstration are 
favorable. They are also especially marked in the case of 
feelings and may arise under proper conditions in the case 
of spacial and temporal ideas. Sensations of pitch are 
relatively most free, for most persons have a well developed 
ability to recognize absolute pitch and this tends to overcome 
contrast. In the case of feelings the effect of contrast is 
intimately connected with their general attribute of develop- 
ing toward certain opposites. Pleasurable feelings especially 
are intensified by unpleasant feelings immediately preceding, 
and the same holds for many feelings of relaxation following 
feelings of strain, as, for example, a feeling of fulfilment 
after expectation. The effect of contrast in the case of spacial 
and temporal ideas is most obvious when the same spacial 
or temporal interval is compared alternately with a longer 
and with a shorter interval. In the two cases the interval 
appears different, in comparison with the shorter it appears 
greater, in comparison with the longer, smaller. Here too the 
contrast between spacial ideas can be removed by bringing 
an object between the contrasted figures in such a way that 
it is possible easily to relate them both to it. 
13. We may regard the phenomena that result from the 
apperception of impressions whose real character differs from 
that expected, as special modifications of psychical contrast. 
For example, we are prepared to lift a heavy weight. but in 
the actual lifting of the weight it proves to be livhter, or 
the reverse takes place and we lift a heavy weight instead 
of a light one as we expected: the result is that in the first 
case we underestimate, in the second overestimate the real 
weight. If a series of exactly equal weights of different sizes 
are made so that they look like a set of weights varying regularly 
from a lighter to a heavier, they will appear to be different in 
17* 
 
-P-A-G-E-278
  260 III. Interconnection of Psychical Compounds. 
weight when raised. The smallest will seem to be the heaviest 
and the largest to be the lightest. The familiar association that 
the greater volume is connected with the greater mass aids the 
contrast. The varying estimations of the weight, however, is the 
result of the contrast between the real and the expected sen- 
sation. 
B. COMPLEX APPERCEPTIVE FUNCTIONS. 
(Synthesis and Analysis.) 
14. When the simple processes of relating and comparing 
are repeated and combined several times, the complex psy- 
chical functions-of synthesis and analysis arise. Synthesis 
is primarily the product of the relating activity of apper- 
ception, analysis of the comparing activity. 
As a combining function apperceptive synthesis is based 
upon fusions and associations. It differs from the latter in 
the fact that some of the ideational and affective elements 
that are brought forward by the association are voluntarily 
emphasized and others are pushed into the background. The 
motives of the choice can be explained only from the whole 
previous development of the individual consciousness. As a 
result of this voluntary activity the product of this synthesis 
is a complex whole whose components all come from former 
sense-perceptions and associations, but in which the combination 
of these components usually varies more or less from the actual 
impressions and the combinations of these impressions that 
are immediately presented in experience. 
The ideational elements of a compound thus resulting 
from apperceptive synthesis may be regarded as the substratum 
for the rest of its contents, and so we call such a compound 
in general an aggregate idea. When the combination of the 
elements is peculiar, that is, markedly different from the 
products of the fusion and associations, the aggregate idea 
and each of its relatively independent ideational components
-P-A-G-E-279
  
$17. Apperceptive Combinations. 261 
is called an idea of imagination or image of imagination. 
Since the voluntary synthesis of elements may vary more 
or less, according to the character of the motives that gave 
rise to it, from the combinations presented in sense-perception 
and association, it is obvious that practically no sharp line 
of demarcation can be drawn between images of imagination 
-and those of memory. But we have a more essential mark 
of the apperceptive process in the positive characteristic of 
a voluntary synthesis than in the negative fact that the com- 
bination does not correspond in character to any particular 
sense-perception. This positive characteristic gives also the 
most striking external difference between images of imagination 
and those of memory. It consists in the fact that the sen- 
sational elements of an apperceptive compound are much 
more like those of an immediate sense-perception in clearness 
and distinctness, and generally in completeness and intensity. 
This is easily explained by the fact that the reciprocally 
inhibitory influences which the uncontrolled associations exer- 
cise on one another, and which prevent the formation of fixed 
memory-images, are diminished or removed by the voluntary 
emphasizing of certain particular ideational compounds. It is 
possible to mistake images of imagination for real experiences. 
With memory-images this is possible only when they become 
images of imagination, that is, when the memories are no 
longer allowed to arise passively, but are to some extent pro- 
duced by the will. Generally, too, there are voluntary modi- 
fications in them or a mixing of real with imagined elements. 
All our memories are therefore made up of “fancy and truth”'). 
Memory-images change under the influence of our feelings 
and volition to images of imagination, and we generally deceive 
ourselves with their resemblance to real experiences. 
1) (‘Dichtung und Wahrheit.”!
-P-A-G-E-280
262 III. Interconnection of Psychical Compounds. 
15. From the aggregate ideas thus resulting from apper~ 
ceptive synthesis there arise two forms of apperceptive activity 
in the opposite direction of analysis. The one is known in 
popular parlance as activity of the imagination, the second 
as activity of the wnderstanding. The two are by no means 
different, as might be surmised from these names, but closely 
related and almost always connected with each other. Their 
fundamental determining motives are what distinguish them 
first of all and condition all their secondary differences as well 
as the reaction that they exercise on the synthetic function. 
In the case of the activity of “émagination” the motive is the 
reproduction. of real experiences or of those analogous to reality. 
This is the earlier form of apperceptive analysis and rises direct- 
ly from associations. It begins with a more or less comprehensive 
aggregate idea made up of a variety of ideational and affective 
elements and embracing the general content of a complex 
experience in which the single components are only indefinitely 
distinguished. The aggregate idea is then divided in a series 
of successive acts into a number of more definite, connected 
compounds partly spacial, partly temporal in character. The 
primary voluntary synthesis is thus followed by analytic acts 
which may in turn give rise to the motives for a new syn- 
thesis and thus to a repetition of the whole process with a 
partially modified or more limited aggregate idea. 
The activity of imagination shows two stages of development. 
The first is more passive and arises directly from the ordinary 
memory-function. It appears continually in the train of thought, 
especially in the form of an anticipation of the future, and plays 
an important part in psychical development as an antecedent 
of volitions. It may, however, in an analogous way, appear as 
a representation in thought of imaginary situations or of 
successions of external phenomena. The second, or active, 
stage of development is under the influence of a fixed idea 
 
-P-A-G-E-281
$17. Apperceptive Combinations. 263 
of some end, and therefore presupposes a high degree of volun- 
tary control over the images of imagination, and « strong 
interference, partly inhibitory, partly selective, with the 
memory-images that tend to push themselves into conscious- 
ness without voluntary action. Even the first synthesis of 
the aggregate idea is more systematic. An aggregate idea, when 
once formed, is held more firmly and subjected to a more 
complete analysis into its parts. Very often these parts them- 
selves are subordinate aggregate ideas to which the same 
process of analysis is again applied. In this way the principle 
of organic division according to the end in view governs all 
the products and processes of active imagination. The pro- 
ductions of art show this most clearly. Still, there are, in 
the ordinary play of imagination, the most various intermediate 
stages between passive imagination, or that which arises 
directly from memory, and active imagination, or that which 
is directed by fixed ends. 
16. In contrast with this reproduction of real experiences 
or of such as may be thought of as real, which constitutes 
the content of the apperceptive functions that we include 
under the concept “imagination”, the fundamental motive of 
the “understanding” is the perception of agreements and 
differences and other derived logical relations between contents 
of experience. Understanding also starts with aggregate ideas 
in which a number of experiences that are real or may be 
ideated as real, are voluntarily set in relation to onc another 
and combined to a unitary whole. The analysis that takes 
place in this case, however, is turned by its fundamental 
motive in a different direction. It consists not merely in a 
clearer grasp of the single components of the aggregate idea, 
but in the establishment of the manifold relations in which these 
components stand to each other and which we may discover 
through comparison. As soon as such analyses have been made  
-P-A-G-E-282
  264 III. Interconnection of Psychical Compounds. 
several times, results of the relating and comparing processes 
gained clsewhere can be employed in any particular case. 
As a result of its more strict application of the elementary 
relating and comparing functions, the activity of understanding 
follows definite rules even in its external form, especially 
when it is highly developed. The principle that holds in 
general for imagination and even for mere remembering, that 
the relations of different psychical contents which are apper- 
ceived are presented, not simultaneously, but successively, so 
that in every case we pass on from one relation to a succeed- 
ing — this principle becomes for the activity of understanding, 
arule of discursive division of aggregate ideas. It is expressed 
in the law of the duality of the logical forms of thought, 
according to which analysis resulting from relating com- 
parison divides the content of the aggregate idea into two 
parts, subject and predicate, and may then separate each 
of these parts again once or several times. These secondary 
divisions give rise to grammatical forms that stand in a logical 
relation analogous to that of subject and predicate, such as 
noun and attributive, verb and object, verb and adverb. In 
this way the process of apperceptive analysis results in a 
judgment. 
For the psychological explanation of judgment it is of 
fundamental importance that it be regarded, not as a syn- 
thetic, but as an analytic function. The original aggregate 
ideas that are divided by judgment into their reciprocally 
related components, are exactly like ideas of imagination. The 
products of analysis that result are, on the other hand, not as 
in the case of imagination, images of more limited extent and 
greater clearness, but conceptual ideas, that is ideas which 
stand, with regard to other partial ideas of the same whole, 
in some one of those relations which are discovered through 
the general relating and comparing functions. If we call the
-P-A-G-E-283
  
$17. Apperceptive Combinations. 265 
aggregate idea which is subjected to such a relating analysis 
a thought, then a judgment is a division of this thought into 
its components, and a concept is the product of such « division. 
17. Concepts found in this way are arranged in certain 
general classes according to the character of the analyses 
that took place. These classes are the concepts of objects, 
attributes, and states. Judgment, as a division of the ag- 
gregate idea, sets an object in relation to its attributes or states, 
or various objects in relation to one another. Since a single 
concept can never, strictly speaking, be thought of by itself, 
but is always connected in the whole idea with one or more 
other concepts, the conceptual ideas are strikingly different 
from the ideas of imagination because of the indefiniteness 
and variableness of the former. This indefiniteness is essen- 
tially increased by the fact that a single concept may 
exist in an unlimited variety of modifications, since concepts 
which result from differents cases of like judgment, may form 
components of many ideas that differ in their concrete 
characters. Such general concepts constitute, on account of 
the wide application of relating analysis to different contents 
of judgment, the great majority of all concepts; and they 
have a great number of corresponding single ideational con- 
tents. It becomes necessary, accordingly, to choose a single 
idea as a representative of the concept. This gives the con- 
ceptual idea a greater definiteness. At the same time there 
is always connected with this idea the consciousness that it 
is merely a representative. This consciousness generally takes 
the form of a characteristic feeling. This conceptual feeling 
may be traced to the fact that obscure ideas, which have 
the attributes that make them suitable to serve as represen- 
tations of the concept, tend to force themselves into con- 
sciousness in the form of variable memory images. As evidence 
of this we have the fact that the feeling is very intense so
-P-A-G-E-284
266 IIT. Interconnection of Psychical Compounds. 
long as any concrete image of the concept is chosen as its 
representative, as, for example, when a particular individual 
stands for the concept man, while it disappears almost entirely 
so soon as the representative idea differs entirely in content 
from the objects included under the concept. Word-ideas 
fulfil this condition and that is what gives them their im- 
portance as universal aids to thought. These aids are 
furnished to the individual consciousness in a finished state, 
so that we must leave to social psychology the question of 
the psychological development of the processes of thought 
active in the formation of language (comp. § 21, A). 
18. From all that has been said it appears that the 
activities of imagination and understanding are not specifically 
different, but interrelated, inseparable in their rise and mani- 
festations, and based at bottom on the same fundamental 
functions of apperceptive synthesis and analysis. What was 
true of the concept “memory” holds also of the concepts 
“understanding” and “imagination”: they are names, not of 
unitary forces or faculties, but of complex phenomena made 
up of elementary psychical processes of the usual, not of a 
specific, distinct kind. Just as memory is a general concept for 
certain associative processes, imagination and understanding are 
general concepts for particular forms of apperceptive activity. 
They have a certain practical value as ready means for the 
classificiition of an endless variety of differences in the capac- 
ity of various persons for intellectual activity. Each class 
thus found may in turn contain an endless variety of grada- 
tions and shades. Thus, neglecting the general differences 
in grade, we have as the chief forms of individual imagination 
the perceptive and the combining forms; as the chief forms 
of understanding, the inductive and deductive forms, the 
first being mainly concerned with the single logical relations 
and their combinations, the second more with general con-

cepts and their analysis. A person’s ¢alent is his total capacity 
resulting from the special tendencies of both his imagination 
and understanding. 
§ 18. PSYCHICAL STATES. 
1. The normal state of consciousness upon which the 
discussion of the foregoing paragraphs has been based may 
undergo such a variety of changes that general psychology 
must give up the attempt to discuss them in detail. Then, 
too, the more important of these changes, namely, those which 
are observed in the various forms of nervous diseases, brain- 
diseases, and insanity, belong to special branches of pathology 
which border upon psychology and are more or less dependent 
upon it. All that psychology can do is to indicate the main 
psychical conditions for such abnormal states of consciousness. 
‘We may distinguish in general, in accordance with what has 
been said about the attributes of psychical processes and their 
interconnection in consciousness tree kinds of such con- 
ditions. They may consist 1) in the abnormal character of the 
psychical elements, 2) in the way psychical compounds are con- 
stituted, and 3) in the way psychical compounds are combined 
in consciousness. As a result of the intimate interconnection 
of these different factors it scarcely ever happens that one of 
these three conditions, each of which may appear in the most 
various concrete forms, is operative alone; but they usually 
unite. The abnormal character of the elements results in the 
abnormity of the compounds, and this in turn brings about 
changes in the general interconnection of conscious processes. 
2. The psychical elements, sensations, and simple feelings, 
show only such changes as result from some disturbance in 
the normal relation between them. and their psycho-physical 
conditions. For sensations such changes may be reduced to
-P-A-G-E-286
  268 III. Interconnection of Psychical Compounds. 
an increase or decrease of the sensitivity for stimuli (hyper- 
aesthesia and anaesthesia) resulting especially from the action 
of certain physiological influences in the sensory centres. The 
most important psychological symptom in this case is the 
increased excitability which is one of the most common com- 
ponents of complex psychical disturbances. In similar fashion, 
changes in the simple feelings betray themselves in states of 
depression or exaltation as a decrease or increase in the 
affective excitability. These different states may be recognized 
from the way in which the emotions and volitional processes 
occur. Thus, changes in the psychical elements can be demon- 
strated only by the influence that they exercise on the 
character of the various psychical compounds. ° 
3. The defects in tdeational compounds arising from periph- 
eral or central anaesthesia are generally of limited im- 
portance. They have no far-reaching effect on the inter- 
‘connection of. psychical processes. It: is essentially different 
with the relative inerease in the intensity of sensations resulting 
from central hyperaesthesia. Its effect is especially important, 
because under such circumstances reproduced sensational ele- 
ments may become as intense as external sense-impressions. 
The result may be that a pure memory-image is objectified as 
a sense-perception. This is an hallucination. Or, when ele- 
ments are united which are partly from direct external 
stimulation, partly from reproduction, the sense-impression 
may be essentially modified through the intensity of the re- 
produced elements. The result is then an dlusion of fancy'). 
1) The expression “illusions of fancy” is used when this class of 
illusions is to be distinguished from the sense-illusions that appear in 
the normal state of consciousness, as, for example, the radiating form 
of the stars, which is due to the refraction of light in the crystalline 
Jens, or the varying apparent size of the sun or moon at the horizon 
and at the zenith.
-P-A-G-E-287
  
$18. Psychical States. 269 
The two. are not always distinguishable. In many cases, to 
be sure, particular ideas can be shown to be illusions of 
fancy, but the presence of pure hallucinations is almost 
always doubtful because it is so easy to overlook some direct 
sensational elements. In fact, it is by no means improbable 
that the great majority of so-called hallucinations are illusions. 
These illusions are in their psychological character nothing 
but assimilations (p. 228 sq.). They may be defined as 
assimilations in which the reproduced elements predominate. 
Just as normal assimilations are closely connected with suc- 
cessive associations, so for the same reason the illusions of 
fancy are closely related to the changes in the associative 
ideational processes to be discussed later (5). 
4. In the case of complex affective and volitional processes 
the abnormal states of depression and exaltation are clearly 
distinguishable from the normal condition. The state of 
depression is due to the predominance of inhibitory, asthenic 
emotions, that of exaltation to a predominance of exciting, 
sthenic emotions, while at the same time we observe, in the 
first case a retardation or complete checking of resolution, 
in the second an exceedingly rapid, impulsive activity of the 
motive. In this sphere it is generally more difficult to draw 
the line between normal and abnormal conditions than in 
that of ideational compounds, because even in normal mental 
life the affective states are continually changing. In patho- 
logical cases the change between states of depression and 
exaltation, which are often very striking, appear merely as 
an intensified oscillation of the feelings and emotions about 
an indifference-condition (pp. 34, 80). States of depression 
and exaltation are especially characteristic symptoms of general 
psychical disturbances; their detailed discussion must there- 
fore be left to psychical pathology. General psychical dis- 
turbances are always symptoms of diseases of the brain, so
-P-A-G-E-288
  270 IIL. Interconnection of Psychical Compounds. 
that these abnormities in affective and volitional processes are 
doubtless accompanied, like those of the sensations and ideas, 
by physiological changes. The nature of these changes is, 
however, still unknown. We can only surmise, in accordance 
with the more complex character of affective processes, either 
that they are more extensive than the changes in central 
excitability accompanying hallucinations and illusions, or that 
they effect the central cortical regions directly concerned in 
apperceptive processes. 
5. Connected with these changes in the sensory excitability 
and with states of depression and exaltation, there are regularly 
simultaneous changes in the interconnection and course of 
psychical processes. Using the concept consciousness that we 
employ to express this interconnection (p. 203), we may call 
these changes abnormal changes of consciousness. So long as 
the abnormity is limited to the single psychical compounds, 
ideas, emotions, and volitions, consciousness is of course 
changed because of the changes in its components, but we 
do no speak of an abnormity of consciousness itself until not 
merely the single compounds, but their combinations also 
exhibit some noticeable abnormities. These always arise, to 
be sure, when the elementary disturbances become greater, 
since the combination of elements to compounds and of com- 
pounds with one another are processes that pass continuously 
into each other. 
Corresponding to the different kinds of combination that 
make up the interconnection of consciousness (p. 223), there 
may be distinguished in general three kinds of abnormities 
of consciousness: 1) changes in the associations, 2) changes 
in the apperceptive combinations, and 3) changes in the re- 
lation of the two forms of combination to each other. 
6. Changes in associations are the first to result directly 
from the elementary disturbances. The increase of sensory
-P-A-G-E-289
§ 18. Psychical States. 271 
excitability changes normal assimilations into illusions of fancy, 
and this results in an essential disturbance in the associative 
processes of recognition (p. 237): sometimes that which is 
known appears to be unknown, and then again what is unknown 
appears familiar, according as the reproduced elements are 
connected with definite earlier ideas, or are derived from 
perceptions that have only a remote relation to one another. 
Then, too, the increased sensory excitability tends to ac- 
celerate the association, so that the most superficial con- 
nections, occasioned by accidental impressions or by habit, 
are the ones that predominate. The states of depression 
and exaltation, on the other hand, determine mainly the 
quality and direction of the association. 
In a similar manner the elementary ideational and affective 
changes influence apperceptive combinations, either retarding 
or accelerating them, or else determining their direction. 
Still, in these cases all marked abnormities in ideational or 
affective processes result in an increase, to a greater or less 
degree, of the difficulty of carrying out the processes con- 
nected with active attention, so that often only the simpler 
apperceptive combinations are possible, sometimes even only 
those which through practice have become simple associations. 
Connected with the last fact mentioned are the changes that 
take place in the relation between apperceptive and associative 
combinations. The influences discussed so far are in the 
main favorable to associations, but unfavorable to apperceptive 
combinations, and one of the most frequent symptoms of a 
far-reaching psychical abnormity is a great preponderance 
of associations. This is most obvious when the disturbance 
of consciousness is a continually increasing process, as it is 
in many cases of insanity. It is then observed that the 
functions of apperception upon which so-called imagination 
and understanding are based, are more and more supplanted
-P-A-G-E-290
  
272 III. Interconnection of Psychical Compounds. 
by associations, until finally the latter are all that remain. 
If the disturbance progresses still further, the associations 
gradually become more limited and confined to certain 
habitual combinations (fixed ideas). Finally this state gives 
place to one of complete mental paralysis. 
7. Apart from mental diseases in the strict sense of the 
term the irregularities of consciousness just discussed are to 
be found in two conditions that appear in the course of 
normal life: in dreams and hypnosis. 
The ideas of dreams come, at. least to a great extent, 
from sensations, especially from those of the general sense, 
and are therefore mostly illusions of fancy, probably only 
seldom pure memory-ideas that have become hallucinations. 
The decrease of apperceptive combinations in comparison with 
associations is also striking, and goes to explain the frequent 
modifications and exchanges of self-consciousness, the con- 
fusion of the judgment, etc. The characteristic of dreams 
that distinguishes them from other similar psychical states, 
is to be found, not so much in these. positive, as in their 
negative attributes. The increase of excitability which is 
attested by the hallucinations, is limited entirely to the sensory 
functions, while in ordinary sleep and dreams the external 
volitional activity is completely inhibited. 
‘When the fanciful ideas of dreams are connected with 
corresponding volitional acts, we have the very infrequent 
phenomena of sleep-walking, which are related to certain 
forms of hypnosis. Motor concomitants are generally limited 
to articulations, and appear as talking in dreams. 
8. Jlypnosis is the name applied to certain states related 
to sleep and dreams and produced by means of certain defi- 
nite psychical agencies. Consciousness is here generally in 
a condition halfway between waking and sleeping. The 
main cause of hypnosis is saggestion, that is, the conmuni-
-P-A-G-E-291
  
§ 18. Psychical States, 273 
cation of an idea strong in affective tone. This generally 
comes in the form of a command from some other person 
(outward suggestion), but may sometimes be produced by the 
subject himself, when it is called autosuggestion. The com- 
mand or resolution to sleep, to make certain movements, to 
see objects not present or not to see objects that are present, 
etc., — these are the most frequent suggestions. Monotonous 
stimuli, especially tactual stimuli are helpful auxiliaries. Then, 
too, there is a certain disposition of the nervous system of 
still unknown character, which is necessary for the rise of 
the hypnotic state and is increased when the state is repeat- 
edly produced. 
The first symptom of hypnosis is the more or less com- 
plete inhibition of volition, connected with a concentration 
of the attention on one thing, generally the commands of 
the hypnotizer (automatism). The subject not only sleeps at 
command, but retains in this state any position that is 
given him, however unnatural (hypnotic catalepsy). If the 
sleep becomes still deeper the subject carries out movements 
as directed, to all appearances automatically, and shows that 
ideas suggested to him appear like real objects (somnambulism). 
In this last state it is possible to give either motor or sen- 
sory suggestions to go into effect when the subject awakes, 
or even at some later time (terminal suggestions). The 
phenomena that accompany such “posthypnotic effects” render 
it probable that the latter are due either to a partial per- 
sistence of the hypnosis or (in the case of terminal sug- 
gestions) to a renewal of the hypnotic state. 
9. It appears from all these phenomena that sleep and 
hypnosis are related states, differing only in that their mode 
of origin is different. They have as common characteristics 
the inhibition of volition, which permits only passive apper- 
ception, and a disposition toward aroused excitability in 
Woxpr, Psychology. 18  
-P-A-G-E-292
  274 II. Interconnection of Psychical Compounds. 
the sensory centres that brings about an assimilation of 
the sense-impressions which results in hallucinations. The 
characteristics that distinguish them are the complete in- 
hibition of volition in sleep, especially of the motor functions, 
and the concentration in hypnosis of the passive attention 
on one thing. This concentration is conditioned by suggestion 
and is at the same time favorable to the reception of further 
suggestions. Still, these differences are not absolute, for in 
sleep-walking the will is not completely inhibited, while on 
the other hand it is inhibited in the first lethargic stages of 
hypnosis just as in ordinary sleep. 
Sleep, dreams, and hypnosis are, accordingly, in all prob- 
ability, essentially the same in their psychophysical conditions. 
These conditions are specially modified dispositions to sen- 
sational and volitional reactions, and can therefore, like all 
such dispositions, be explained on their physiological side 
only by assuming changes in the activity of certain central 
regions. These changes have not yet been investigated 
directly. Still, we may assume from the psychological symp- 
toms that they consist in the inhibition of the activity in 
the regions connected with processes of volition and attention, 
and in the increase in the excitability of sensory centres. 
9a. It is then, strictly speaking, a physiological problem 
to formulate a theory of sleep, dreams, and hypnosis. Apart 
from the general assumption based on p8ychological symptoms, 
of an inhibition of activity in certain parts of the cerebral cortex, 
and increase in the activity of other parts, we can apply only 
one general neurological principle with any degree of probability. 
That is the principle of compensation of functions, according to 
which the inhibition of the activity of one region is always 
connected with an increase in the activity of the others 
interrelated with it. This interrelation may be either direct, 
neurodynamic, or indirect, vasomotoric. The first is probably due 
to the fact that energy which accumulates in one region as the
-P-A-G-E-293
§ 18. Psychical States. 275 
result of inhibition, is discharged through the connecting fibres 
into other central regions. The second is due to contraction of 
the capillaries as a result of inhibition and a compensating dilation 
of the blood-vessels in other regions. The increased blood supply 
due to this dilation is in turn attended by an increase in the 
activity of the region in question. 
Dreams and hypnosis are often made the subjects of mys- 
tical and fanciful hypotheses, in some cases even by psy- 
chologists. We hear of increased mental activity in dreams and 
of influence of mind on minds at a distance in dreams and 
hypnosis. Especially hypnotism has been used in modern times, 
in this way, to support superstitious spiritualistic ideas. In con- 
nection with “animal magnetism”, which may be completely ex- 
plained by the theory of hypnosis and suggestion, and in connection 
with “somnambulism”, there are a great many cases of self- 
deception and intentional humbug. In reality all that can stand 
the light of thorough examination in these phenomena is in general 
readily explicable on psychological and physiological grounds; 
what is not explicable in this way has always proved on closer 
examination to be superstitious self-deception or intentional fraud.

  IV. PSYCHICAL DEVELOPMENTS. 
§ 19. PSYCHICAL ATTRIBUTES OF ANIMALS. 
1. The animal kingdom exhibits a series of mental develop- 
ments which may be regarded as antecedents to the mental 
development of man. The mental life of animals shows 
itself to be in its elements and in the general laws of their 
combination everywhere the same as that of man. 
Even the lowest animals (protozoa and coelenterata) mani- 
fest vital phenomena that allow us to infer ideational and 
volitional processes. They seize their food to all appearances 
spontaneously; they flee from pursuing enemies, etc. There 
are also to be found in the lowest stages of animal life 
traces of associations and reproductions and especially pro- 
cesses of sensible cognition and recognition (p. 237). They 
reach a more advanced stage of development in higher ani- 
mals only through the increase in the variety of ideas and in 
the length of time through which the memory-processes ex- 
tend. From the like structure and development of the sense- 
organs we must draw the conclusion that the character of 
the sense-ideas are in general the same, the only difference 
being that in the lowest forms of life the sensory functions 
are limited to the general sense of touch, just as in the 
case of the higher organisms in the first stages of their in- 
dividual development {p. 39). 
In contrast whith this uniformity of psychical elements 
and their simpler combinations there are great differences in
-P-A-G-E-295
$19. Psychical Attributes of Animals. 277 
all the processes connected with the development of apper- 
ception. Passive apperception is never absent as the basis 
for the simple impulsive acts that are found everywhere, 
but active apperception in the form of voluntary attention 
to certain impressions and a choice between different motives 
probably never exists except in the higher animals. Even 
here it is limited to the ideas and associations aroused by 
immediate sensible impressions, so that we can at most, if at 
all, only find the first beginnings of intellectual processes in 
the proper sense of the word, that is activities of imagination 
and understanding, even in the animals with the highest mental 
development. Connected with this fact is the other that 
higher animals have no developed language, though they are 
able to give expression to their emotions and even their ideas, 
when these are connected with emotions, through various 
expressive movements often related to those of man. 
2. Though the development of animals is in general far 
behind that of man in spite of the qualitative likeness of the 
fundamental psychical processes, still, in two ways it is often 
superior. First, animals reach psychical maturity much more 
rapidly, and secondly, certain single functions particularly 
favored by the special conditions under which the species 
lives, are more highly developed. The fact of more rapid 
maturity is shown by the early age at which many animals, 
some immediately after birth, are able to receive relatively 
clear sense-impressions and to execute purposive movements. 
To be sure, there are very great differences among higher 
animals in this respect. For example, the chick just out of 
the shell begins to pick up grain, while the pup is blind at 
birth, and for a long time after clumsy in his movements. 
Yet, the development of the child seems to be the slowest 
and the most dependent on help and care from others. 
3. The special one-sided development of single functions 
 
-P-A-G-E-296
    278 IV. Psychical Developments. 
in some animals is still more striking. These functions show 
themselves in certain impulsive acts regularly connected 
with the satisfaction of certain needs, either of alimen- 
tation, reproduction, or protection, and in the development 
of the sense-perceptions and associations that form the 
motives for such acts. Such specially developed impulses 
are called instincts, The assumption that instincts belong 
only to animal and not to human consciousness is, of course, 
entirely unpsychological, and contradictory to experience. The 
disposition to manifest the general animal impulses, namely, 
the alimentive and sexual impulses, is just as much a connate 
attribute of man as. of the animals. The only thing that is 
characteristic is the special highly developed form of the 
purposive acts by which many animals reach the ends aimed 
at. Different animals, however, are very different in this 
respect. There are numerous lower and higher animals whose 
acts resulting from connate instincts show as few striking 
characteristics as those of men. It is also remarkable that 
domestication generally tends to do away with the instincts 
that animals had in their wild state, and to develop new 
ones that may generally be regarded as modifications of the 
wild instincts, as, for example, those of certain hunting dogs, 
especially those of bird-dogs and pointers. The relatively 
high development of certain special instincts in animals as 
compared with men, is simply a manifestation of the general 
unsymmetrical development of the former. The whole psychical 
life of animals consists almost entirely of the processes that 
are connected with the predominating instinct. 
4. In general, instincts may be regarded as impulsive acts 
that arise from particular sensations and sense-feelings. The 
physiological sources of the sensations chiefly concerned in 
instincts are the alimentary and genital organs. All animal 
instincts may, accordingly, be reduced to alimentive and
-P-A-G-E-297
  
$19. Psychical Attritndes of Animals. 279 
sexual instincts, though in connection with the latter, espe- 
cially in their more complex forms, there are always auxiliary 
protective and social impulses which may be regarded, from 
the character of their origin, as special modifications of 
the sexual impulse. Among these auxiliary forms must be 
reckoned the impulses of many animals to build houses and 
nests, as in the case of beavers, birds, and numerous insects 
(for example, spiders, wasps, bees, ants), then, too, the instinct 
of animal marriage found chiefly among birds and appearing 
both in the monogamic and polygamic forms. Finally, the 
so-called “animal states”, as those of the bees, of ants, and 
of termites, belong under this head. They are in reality not 
states, but sexual communities, in which the social impulse 
that unites the individuals, as well as the common protective 
impulse, are modifications of the reproduction-impulse. 
In the case of all instincts the particular impulsive acts 
arise from certain sense-stimuli partly external, partly internal. 
The acts themselves are to be classed as impulsive acts, or 
simple yolitions, since they are preceded and accompanied by 
particular sensations and feelings that serve as simple mo- 
tives (p. 85 sq.). The complex, connate character of these acts 
can be explained only from general inherited attributes of 
the nervous system, as a result of which certain connate 
reflex mechanisms are immediately set in action by particular 
stimuli, without practice on the part of the individual. The 
purposive character of these mechanisms must also be re- 
garded as a product of general psycho-physical deyclopment. 
As further evidence for this we have the fact that instincts 
show not only various individual modifications, but even a 
certain degree of higher development through individual 
practice. In this way, the bird gradually learns to build its 
nest better; bees accommodate their hive to changing needs; 
instead of sending out new colonies they enlarge the hive
-P-A-G-E-298
    280 IV. Psychical Developments. 
if they have the necessary room. Even abnormal habits may 
be acquired by a single community of bees or ants; the first, 
for example, may learn to rob a neighboring hive instead of 
gathering the honey from the flowers, or the latter may 
acquire the remarkable habit of making the members of 
another ‘species slaves, or of domesticating plant-lice for the 
sake of their honey. The rise, growth, and transmission of 
these habits as we can trace them, show clearly the way 
in which all complicated instincts may arise. Such an 
instinct never appears alone, but there are always sémpler 
forms of the same instinct in related classes and species. 
Thus the hole that the wall-wasp bores in the wall to lay 
her eggs in, is a primitive pattern of the ingenious hive of the 
honey-bee. Between these two extremes as the natural trans- 
ition stage we have the hive of the ordinary wasp made of 
a few hexagonal cells constructed of cemented sticks and 
leaves. 
We may, accordingly, explain the complex instincts as 
developed forms of originally simple impulses that have 
gradually differentiated more and more in the course of 
numberless generations, through the gradual accumulation of 
habits that have been acquired by individuals and then trans- 
mitted. Every single habit is to be regarded as a stage in this 
psychical development. Its gradual passage into a connate 
disposition is to be explained as a psycho-physical process of 
practice through which complex volitional acts gradually pass 
into purposive movements that follow immediately and reflexly 
the appropriate impression. 
5. If we try to answer the general question of the 
genetic relation of man to the animals on the ground of a 
comparison of their’ psychical attributes, it must be admitted, 
in view of the likeness of psychical elements and of their 
simplest and most general forms of combination, that it is
-P-A-G-E-299
  
$19. Psychical Attributes of Animals. 281 
possible that human consciousness has developed from a lower 
form of animal consciousness. This assumption also finds strong 
support in the fact that the animal kingdom presents a whole 
series of different stages of psychical development and that 
every human individual passes through an analogous develop- 
ment. The doctrine of psychical development thus confirms in 
general the results of the theory of physical evolution, still 
we must not overlook the fact that the differences between 
the psychical attributes of man and those of the animals, 
as expressed in the intellectual and affective processes re- 
sulting from apperceptive combinations, are much broader 
than the differences in their physical characteristics. Then, too, 
the great stability of the psychical condition of animals, 
which undergoes little change even in domestication, renders 
it exceedingly improbable that any of the present animal 
forms will develop much beyond the limits that they have 
already reached in their psychical attributes. 
5a. The attempts to define the relation of man and animals from 
a psychological point of view vary between two extremes. One of 
these is the predominating view of the old psychology that the higher 
“faculties of mind”, especially “reason”, were entirely wanting in 
animals. The other is the wide-spread opinion of representatives of 
special animal psychology, that animals are fully equal to man in 
all respects, in ability to consider, to judge, to draw conclusions, in 
moral feelings, etc. With the rejection of faculty-psychology the 
first of these views becomes untenable. The second rests on the 
tendency prevalent in popular psychology to interpret all objective 
phenomena in terms of human thought, especially in terms of logical 
reflection. The closer psychological investigation of so-called mani- 
festation of intelligence among animals shows, however, that they 
are in all cases fully explicable as simple sensible recognitions and 
associations, and that they lack the characteristics belonging to con- 
cepts proper and to logical operations. But associative processes 
pass without a break into apperceptive, and the beginnings of the 
latter, that is simple acts of active attention and choice, appear
-P-A-G-E-300
  
282 IV. Psychical Developments. 
without any doubt in the case of higher animals, so that the 
difference is after all more one of the degree and complexity of 
the psychical processes than one of kind. 
Animal instincts presented a very great difficulty to the older 
forms of psychology, such as the faculty-theory and the intellec- 
tualistic theories (§ 2). Since the attempt to deduce these instincts 
from the conditions given in each individual case led to an im- 
probably high estimation of the psychical ability of the animal, 
especially when the instinct was more complex, the conclusion 
was often accepted that instincts are incomprehensible, or, what 
amounts to the same thing, due to connate ideas. This “enigma 
of the instincts” ceases to be an enigma when we come to look 
upon instincts, as we have: done above, as special forms of im- 
pulsive action, and to consider them as analogous to the simple 
impulsive acts of men and animals, for which we have a psy- 
chological explanation. This is especially true when we follow 
the reduction of what were originally complicated acts, to im- 
pulsive or reflex movements in the phenomena of habit, so easily 
observed in the case of man, as, for example, the habituation to 
complex movements in learning to play the piano (comp. p. 192 sq.). 
It is often argued against this theory of instinct that it is im- 
possible to prove empirically the transmission of acquired individual 
variations which we have assumed, that, for example, there are 
no certain observations in proof of the transmission of mutilations, 
as used to be asserted so frequently. Many biologists accept the 
view that all the properties of the organism arise through the 
selection resulting from the survival of the individual best adapted 
to natural conditions, that all such properties are accordingly 
deducible from “natural selection”, and that in this way alone 
changes can be produced in the germ and transmitted to descend- 
ants. Though it must be admitted that an attribute acquired by a 
single individual, generally has no effect on the descendents, still, 
there is no apparent reason why habitual acts, which are indeed 
indirectly due to outer natural conditions, but depend primarily on 
the inner psycho-physical attributes of the organism, may not 
cause changes in the nature of the germ when these acts are repeated 
through many generations, just as well as the direct influences 
of natural selection. As further evidence for this view we have 
the fact that in some cases whole families inherit peculiar 
 
-P-A-G-E-301
ye eee ee 
§ 20. Psychical Development of the Child. 283 | 
expressive movements or technical ability in some line (p. 285). | 
This does not exclude in any case the cooperation of natural 
influences, but is in full agreement with the facts of observation 
which show that these influences act in two ways: first, directly 
in the changes that natural selection brings about in the organism 
while the organism remains passive, and secondly, indirectly in the 
psycho-physical reactions that are caused by the outer influences, 
and then in turn give rise to changes in the organism. If we neglect 
the latter fact, we not only lose an important means of accounting 
for the eminently purposive character of animal organisms, but 
further, and more especially, we render impossible a psychological 
explanation of the gradual development of volition and its retro- 
gradation into purposive reflexes as we see it in a large number 
of connate expressive movements (§ 20, 1). 
§ 20. PSYCHICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE 
CHILD. 
1. The fact that the psychical development of man is 
regularly slower than that of most animals is to be seen in 
the much more gradual maturing of his sense-functions. The 
child, to be sure, reacts immediately after birth to all kinds 
of sense-stimuli, most clearly to impressions of touch and 
taste, with the least certainty to those of sound. Still, it is 
impossible to doubt that the special forms of the reaction- 
movements in all these cases are due to inherited reflexes. 
This is especially true for the child’s crying when affected 
by cold and tactual impressions, and for the mimetic reflexes 
when he tastes sweet, sour, or bitter substances. It is prob- 
able that all these impressions are accompanied by obscure 
sensations and feelings, yet the character of the movements 
can not be explained from the feelings whose symptoms they 
may be considered to be, but must be referred to connate 
central reflex tracts. 
Probably nothing is clear in consciousness until the end of the
-P-A-G-E-302
    284 IV. Psychical Developments. 
first month, and even then, as the rapid change of moods shows, 
sensations and feelings must be relatively very changeable. It 
is at about this time that we begin to observe symptoms of 
pleasurable and unpleasurable feelings in the child’s laughter 
and in lively rhythmical movements of his arms and legs after 
certain impressions. Even the reflexes are not completely 
developed at first — a fact which we can easily understand 
when we learn from anatomy that many of the connecting 
fibres between the cerebral centres do not develop until after 
birth. Thus the associative reflex-movements of the two eyes 
are wanting. From the first each of the eyes by itself 
generally turns towards a light, but the movements of the 
two eyes are entirely irregular, and it is only in the course 
of the first three months that the normal coordination 
of the movements of the two eyes with a common fixation- 
point, begins to appear. Even then the developing regularity 
is not to be regarded as a: result of complete visual per- 
ceptions, but, quite the reverse, as a symptom of the gradual 
functioning of a reflex-centre, which then renders clear visual 
perceptions possible. 
2. It is, generally speaking, impossible to gain any ade- 
quate information about the qualitative relations of psychical 
elements in the child’s consciousness, for the reason that we 
have no certain objective symptoms. It is probable that the 
number of different tonal sensations, perhaps also the number 
of color-sensations, is very limited. The fact that children two 
years old not infrequently use the wrong names for colors 
ought not however, to be looked upon as unqualified evidence, 
that they do not have the sensation in question. It is much 
more probable that lack of attention and a confusion of the 
names is the real explanation in such cases. 
Towards the end of the first year the differentiation of 
feelings and the related development of the various emotions 
 
-P-A-G-E-303
§ 20. Psychical Development of the Child. 285 
take place, and show themselves strikingly in the characteristic 
expressive movements that gradually arise. We have un- 
pleasurable feelings and joy, then in order, astonishment, 
expectation, anger, shame, envy, etc. Even in these cases 
the dispositions for the combined movements which express 
the single emotions, depend upon inherited physiological attri- 
butes of the nervous system, which generally do not begin 
to function until after the first few months, in a way anal- 
ogous to the combined innervation of the ocular muscles. 
As further evidence of this we have the fact that not in- 
frequently special peculiarities in the expressive movements 
are inherited by whole families. 
3. The physical conditions for the rise of spacial ideas 
are connate in the form of inherited reflex-connections which 
make a relatively rapid development of these ideas possible. 
But for the child the spacial perceptions seem at first to be 
much more incomplete than they are in the case of many 
animals. There are manifestations of pain when the skin is 
stimulated, but no clear symptoms of localization. Distinct 
grasping movements develop gradually from the aimless move- 
ments that are observed even in the first days, but they do 
not, as arule, become certain and consciously purposive until 
aided by visual perceptions, after the twelfth week. The 
turning of the eye toward a source of light as generally 
observed very early, is to be regarded as reflex. The same 
is true of the gradual coordination of ocular movements. 
Still it is probable that along with these reflexes there are 
developed spacial ideas, so that all we can observe is the 
gradual completion of these ideas from very crude beginnings, 
for the process is continuous and is always interconnected 
with its original physiological substratum. Even in the child 
the sense of sight shows itself to be decidedly more rapid in 
its development than the sense of touch, for the symptoms
-P-A-G-E-304
  286 IV. Psychical Developments. 
of visual localization are certainly observable earlier than 
those of tactual localization, and the grasping movements, 
as mentioned above, do not reach their full development 
until aided by the sense of sight. The field of binocular 
vision is much later in its development than that of monocular 
vision. The latter shows itself in the discrimination of 
directions in space. The beginnings of the development of 
a field for binocular vision coincide with the first coordination 
of ocular movements and belong; accordingly, to the second 
half of the first year. The perception of size, of distance, 
and of various three-dimensional figures remains for a long 
time very imperfect. Especially, distant objects are all thought 
to be near at hand, so that they appear relatively small to 
the child. : 
4. Temporal ideas develop along with the spacial ideas. 
The ability to form regular temporal ideas and the agree- 
ableness of these to the child shows itself in the first months 
in the movements of his limbs and especially in the tendency 
to accompany rhythms that are heard, with similar rhythmical 
movements. Some children can imitate correctly, even before 
they can speak, the rhythmical melodies that they hear, in 
sounds and intonations. Still, the ideas of longer intervals 
are very imperfect even at the end of the first year and later, 
so that a child gives very irregular judgments as to the 
duration of different periods and also as to their sequence. 
5. The development of associations and of simple apper- 
ceptive combinations goes hand in hand with that of spacial 
and temporal ideas. Symptoms of sensible recognition (p. 237) 
are observable from the very first days, in the rapidly ac- 
quired ability to find the mother’s breast and in the obvious 
habituation to the objects and persons of the environment. 
Still, for a long time these associations cover only very short 
intervals of time, at first only hours, then days. Even in
-P-A-G-E-305
  
$ 20. Psychical Development of the Child. 287 
the third and fourth years children either forget entirely or 
remember only imperfectly persons who have been absent 
for a few weeks. 
The case with attention is similar. At first it is possible 
to concentrate it upon a single object only for a very short 
time, and it is obvious that passive apperception which always 
follows the predominating stimulus, that is the one whose 
affective tone is strongest (p. 217), is the only form present. 
In the first weeks, however, a lasting attention begins to 
show itself in the way the child fixates and follows objects 
for a longer time, especially if they are moving; and at the 
same time we have the first trace of active apperception in 
the ability to turn voluntarily from one impression to another. 
From this point on, the ability becomes more and more fully 
developed; still, the attention, even in later childhood, 
fatigues more rapidly than in the case of adults, and requires 
a greater variety of objects or a more frequent pause for 
rest. 
6. The development of self-consciousness keeps pace with 
that of the associations and apperceptions. In judging of 
this development we must guard against accepting as signs 
of self-consciousness any single symptoms, such as the child’s 
discrimination of the parts of his body from objects of his 
environment, his use of the word “I”, or even the recognition 
of his own image in the mirror. The adult savage who has 
never seen his own reflected image before, takes it for some 
other person. The use of the personal pronoun is due to 
the child’s imitation of the examples of those about him. 
This imitation comes at very different times in the cases of 
different children, even when their intellectual development 
in other respects is the same. It is, to be sure, a symptom 
of the presence of self-consciousness, but the first beginnings 
of self-consciousness may have preceded this discrimination
-P-A-G-E-306
  288 IV. Psychical Developments. 
in speech by a longer or shorter period of time as the case 
may be. Again, the discrimination of the body from other 
objects is a symptom of exactly the same kind. The re- 
cognition of the body is a process that regularly precedes 
that of the recognition of the image in the mirror, but one 
is as little a criterion of the beginning of self-consciousness 
as the other. They both presuppose the existence of some 
degree of self-consciousness beforehand. Just as the developed 
self-consciousness is based upon a number of different con- 
ditions (p. 221), so in the same way the self-consciousness of 
the child is from the first a product of several components, 
partly ideational in character, partly affective and volitional. 
Under the first head we have the discrimination of a constant 
group of ideas, under the second the development of certain 
interconnected processes of attention and volitional acts. The 
constant group of ideas does mot necessarily include all parts 
of the body, as, for example, the legs, which are usually 
covered, and it may, as is more often the case, include 
external objects, as, for example, the clothes generally worn. * 
The subjective affective and volitional components, and the 
relations that exist between these and the ideational com- 
ponents in external volitional acts, are the factors that exercise 
the decisive influence. Their greater influence is shown 
especially by the fact that strong feelings, especially those 
of pain, very often mark in an individual’s memory the first. 
moment to which the continuity of his self-consciousness 
reaches back. But there can be no doubt that a form of 
self-consciousness, even though less interconnected, exists even 
before this first clearly remembered moment, which generally 
comes in the fifth or sixth year. Still, since the objective 
observation of the child is not supplied at first with any 
certain criteria, it is impossible to determine the exact moment 
when self-consciousness begins. Probably the traces of it
-P-A-G-E-307
  § 20. Psychical Development of the Child. 289 
begin to appear in the first weeks; after this it continually 
becomes clearer under the constant influence of the conditions 
mentioned, and increases in temporal extent just as conscious- 
ness in general does. 
7. The development of will is intimately connected with 
that of self-consciousness. It may be inferred partly from 
the development of attention described above, partly from 
the rise and gradual perfection of external volitional acts, 
whose influence on self-consciousness has just been mentioned. 
The immediate relation of attention to will appears in the 
fact that symptoms of active attention and voluntary action 
come at exactly the same time. Very many animals execute 
immediately after birth fairly perfect impulsive movements, 
that is, simple volitional acts. These are rendered possible 
by inherited reflex-mechanisms of a complex character. The 
new-born child, on the contrary, does not show any traces 
of such impulsive acts. Still, we observe in the first days 
the earliest beginnings of simple volitional acts of an im- 
pulsive character, as a result of the reflexes caused by sen- 
sations of hunger and by the sense-perceptions connected 
with appeasing it. These are to be seen in the evident quest 
after the sources of nourishment. With the obvious growth 
of attention come the volitional acts connected with im- 
pressions of sight and hearing: the child purposely, no longer 
merely in a reflex way, follows visual objects, and turns 
his head towards the noises that he hears. Much later come 
the movements of the outer muscles of the limbs and trunk. 
These, especially the muscles of the limbs, show from the 
first lively movements, generally repeated time and time 
again. These movements are accompanied by all possible feel- 
ings and emotions, and when the latter become differentiated, 
the movements begin gradually to exhibit certain differences 
characteristic for the quality of the emotions. The chief 
Wexvr, Psychology. 1y
-P-A-G-E-308
290 IV. Psychical Developments. 
difference consists in the fact that rhythmical movements 
accompany pleasurable emotions, while arrhythmical and, as a 
rule, violent movements result when the emotions are un- 
pleasurable. These expressive movements, which must be 
looked upon as reflexes attended by feelings, then, as soon 
as the attention begins to turn upon the surroundings, pass 
as occasion offers into ordinary voluntary expressive move- 
ments. Thus, the child shows through the different accom- 
panying symptoms that he not only feels pain, annoyance, 
anger, etc., but that the wishes to give expression to these 
emotions. The first movements, however, in which an ante- 
cedent motive is to be recognized beyond a doubt, are the 
grasping movements which begin in the twelfth to the four- 
teenth week. Especially at first, the foot takes part in these 
movements as well as the hand. We have here also the first 
clear symptoms of sense-perception, as well as the first in- 
dications of the existence of a simple volitional process made 
up of motive, decision, and act. Somewhat later intentional 
imitative movements are to be observed. Simple mimetic 
imitations, such as puckering the lips and frowning, come 
first, and then pantomimetic, such as doubling up the fist, 
beating time, etc. Very gradually, as a rule not until after 
the beginning of the second half of the first year, complex 
volitional acts develop from these simple ones. The oscillation 
of decision, the voluntary suppression of an intended act or 
one already begun, commence to be clearly observable at 
this period. 
Learning to walk, which usually begins in the last third 
of the first year, is an important factor in the development 
of voluntary acts in the proper sense of the term. Its im- 
portance is due to the fact that the going to certain particular 
places furnishes the occasion for the rise of a number of 
conflicting motives. The learning itself is to be regarded as
-P-A-G-E-309
$ 20. Psychical Development of the Child. 291 
a process in which the development of the will and the effect 
of inherited dispositions to certain particular combinations of 
movements are continually interacting upon each other. The 
first impulse for the movement comes from volitional motives; 
the purposive way in which it is carried out, however, is 
primarily an effect of the central mechanism of coordination, 
which in turn is rendered continually more and more purposive 
as a result of the individual’s practice directed by his will. 
8. The development of the child’s ability to speak follows 
that of his other volitional acts. This, too, depends on the 
cooperation of inherited modifications in the central organ 
of the nervous system on one hand, and outside influences 
on the other. The most important outside influences in this 
case are those that come from the speech of those about the 
child. In this respect the development of speech corresponds 
entirely to that of the other expressive movements, among 
which it is, from its general psycho-physical character, to be 
classed. The earliest articulations of the vocal organs appear 
as reflex phenomena, especially accompanying. pleasurable 
feelings and emotions, as early as the second month. After 
that they increase in variety and exhibit more and more the 
tendency to repetition (for example, ba-ba-ba, da-da-da-da, 
etc.). These expressive sounds differ from those of many 
animals only in their greater and continually changing variety 
They are produced on all possible occasions and without any 
intention of communicating anything, so that they are by nu 
means to be classed as elements of speech. Through the in- 
fluence of those about the child these sounds generally become 
elements of speech after the beginning of the second year. Thi~ 
result is brought about chiefly by certain imitative movements. 
It comes, in the form of sound-sensations, from two sides. On 
the one hand, the child imitates adults, on the other, adults 
imitate the child. In fact, as a rule, it is the adults who 
19*
-P-A-G-E-310
  292 IV. Psychical Derelopments. 
begin the imitating; they repeat the involuntary articulations 
of the child and attach a particular meaning to them, as, 
for example, “pa-pa” for father, “ma-ma” for mother, ete. 
It is not until later, after the child has learned to use these 
sounds in a particular sense through intentional imitation, 
that he repeats other words of the adults’ language also, and 
even then he modifies them to fit the stock of sounds that 
he is able to articulate. 
Gestures are important as means by which adults, more 
instinctively than voluntarily, help the child to understand 
the words they use. These are generally indicative gestures 
towards the objects; less frequently, ordinarily only in the 
case of words meaning some activity such as strike, cut, 
walk, sleep, etc., they take the form of depicting gestures. 
The child has a natural understanding for these gestures, 
but not for words. Even the onomatopoetic words of child- 
speech (such as bow-bow for dog, etc.) never become intelligible 
to him until the objects have been frequently pointed out. 
The child is not the creator of these words, but it is rather 
the adult who seeks instinctively to accommodate himself in 
this respect also to the stage of the child’s consciousness. 
All this goes to show that the child’s learning to speak 
is the result of a series of associations and apperceptions in 
whose formation both the child and those about him take 
part. Adults voluntarily designate particular ideas with certain 
words taken from the expressive sounds made by the child, 
or with onomatopoetic words made arbitrarily after the pattern 
of the first class. The child apperceives this combination of 
word and idea after it has been made intelligible to him 
with gestures, and associates it with his own imitative articu- 
lative movements. Following the pattern of these first apper- 
ceptions and associations the child then forms others, by 
imitating of his own accord more and more the words and
-P-A-G-E-311
  
| $ 20. Psychical Development of the Child. 293 
verbal combinations that he accidentally hears adults using, 
and by making the appropriate associations with their meanings. 
The whole process is thus the result of a psychical interaction 
between the child and those about him. The sounds are at 
first produced by the child alone, those about him take up 
these sounds and make use of them for purposes of speech. 
9. The final development that comes from all the simpler 
processes thus far discussed, is that of the complex functions 
of apperception, that is the relating and comparing activities, 
and the activities of imagination and understanding made up 
of these (§ 17). 
Apperceptive combination in its first form is exclusively 
the activity of imagination, that is the combination, analysis, 
and relating of concrete sensible ideas. Thus, individual 
development corroborates what has been said in general about 
the genetic relation of these functions (p. 266). On the basis 
of the continually increasing association of immediate im- 
pressions with earlier ideas, there arises in the child, as soon 
as his active attention is aroused, a tendency to form such 
combinations voluntarily. The number of memory-elements 
freely combining with the impression and added to it, furnish 
us with a measure for the fertility of the individual child’s 
imagination. As soon as this combining activity of imagination 
has once begun to operate, it shows itself with an impulsive 
force that the child is unable to resist, for there is not as 
yet, as in the case of adults, any activity of the understanding 
to prescribe definite intellectual ends regulating and inhibiting 
the free sweep of the ideas of imagination. 
This unchecked relating and coupling of ideas in imagination 
is connected with volitional impulses aiming to find for the 
ideas some starting-points in immediate sense-perception, how- 
ever vague these starting-points may be. This is what gives 
rise to the child’s play-impulse. The earliest games of the
-P-A-G-E-312
    294 IV. Psychical Developments. 
child are those of pure imagination; while, on the contrary, 
those of adults (cards, chess, lotto, ete.) are almost as exclusively 
intellectual games. Only where aesthetical demands exert an in- 
fluence are the games of adults the productions of the imagina- 
tion (drama, piano-playing, etc.), but even here they are not 
wholly untrammeled like those of the child, but are regulated 
by the understanding. When the play of a child takes its natural 
course, it shows at different periods of its development all 
the intermediate stages betweea the game of pure imagination 
and that in which imagination and understanding are united. In 
the first years this play consists in the production of rhyth- 
mical movements of the arms and legs, then the movements 
are carried over to external objects as well, with preference 
to such objects as give rise to auditory sensations, or such 
as are of bright colors. In their origin these movements are 
obviously impulsive acts aroused by certain sensational stimuli 
and dependent for their purposive coordination on inherited 
traits of the central nervous organs. The rhythmical order 
of the movements and of the feelings and sound-impressions 
produced by them, obviously arouse pleasurable feelings, and 
this very soon results in the voluntary repetition of the move- 
ments. After this, during the first years, play becomes gradu- 
ally a voluntary imitation of the occupations and scenes that 
the child sees about him. The range of imitation then widens 
and is no longer limited to what is seen, but includes a free 
reproduction of what is heard in narratives. At the same 
time the interconnection between ideas and acts begins to 
follow « more fixed plan. This is the regulative influence of 
the activity of understanding, which shows itself in the games 
of later childhood in perscribed rules. This development is 
often accelerated through the influence of those about the 
child and through artificial forms of play generally invented 
by adults and not always suited to the child’s imagination;
-P-A-G-E-313
  
§ 20. Psychical Development of the Child. 295 
still, the development is to be recognized as natural and 
necessarily conditioned by the reciprocal interconnection of 
associative and apperceptive processes, since it agrees with 
the general development of the intellectual functions. The 
way in which the processes of imagination are gradually 
curtailed and the functions of understanding more and more 
employed, renders it probable that the curtailing is due not 
so much to a quantitative decrease of imagination as to an 
obstruction of its action through abstract thinking. When 
this has once set in, because of the predominating exercise 
of abstract thinking, the activity of imagination may itself 
through lack of use be interfered with. This view seems to 
be supported by the fact that savages usually have all through 
their lives an imaginative play-impulse related to that of the child. 
10. From imaginative forms of thought as a starting- 
point the functions of understanding develop very gradually 
in the way already described (p. 264). Aggregate ideas that are 
presented in sense-perception or formed by the combining 
activity of imagination are divided into their conceptual 
components, into objects and their attributes, into objects 
and their activities, or into the relations of different objects 
to one another. The decisive symptom for the rise of the 
functions of understanding is therefore the formation of 
concepts. On the other hand, actions that can be vxplained 
from the point of view of the observer by logical reflection, are 
by no means proofs of the existence of such reflection on 
the part of the actor, for they are very often obviously 
derived from associations, just as in the case of animals. 
In the same way there may be the first beginnings of speech 
without abstract thinking in any proper sense, since words 
refer originally only to concrete sensible impressions. Still, 
the more perfect use of language is not possible until ideas 
are conceptually analyzed, related, and transferred, even
-P-A-G-E-314
  296 IV. Psychical Developments. 
though the processes are in each case entirely concrete and 
sensible. The development of the functions of understanding 
and that of speech accordingly go hand in hand, and the 
latter is an indispensable aid in retaining concepts and fixing 
the operations of thought. 
10a. Child-psychology often suffers from the same mistake 
that is made in animal psychology: namely, that the observations 
are not interpreted objectively, but are filled out with subjective 
reflections. Thus, the earliest ideational combinations, which are 
in reality purely associative, are regarded as acts of logical 
reflection, and the earliest mimetic expressive movements, as, for 
example, those of a new-born child due to taste-stimuli, are looked 
upon as reactions to feelings, while they are obviously at first 
nothing but connate reflexes which may, indeed, be accompanied 
by obscure concomitant feelings, but even these can not be 
demonstrated with certainty. The ordinary view as to the devel- 
opment of volition and of speech, labors under a like miscon- 
ception. Generally there is a tendency to consider the child’s 
language, because of its peculiarities, as a creation of his own. 
Closer observation, however, shows that it is created by those 
about him, though in doing this they use the sounds that the 
child himself produces, and conform as far as possible to his 
stage of consciousness. Thus it comes that some of the very 
detailed and praise-worthy accounts of the mental development of 
the child in modern literature can serve only as sources for 
finding objective facts. Because they stand on the basis of a 
reflective popular psychology, their psychological deductions require 
correction along the lines marked out above. 
§ 21. DEVELOPMENT OF MENTAL COMMUNITIES. 
1. Just as the psychical development of the child is the 
resultant of his interaction with his environment, so matured 
consciosness stands continually in relation to the mental 
community in which it has a receptive and an active part. 
Among most animals such a community is entirely wanting.
-P-A-G-E-315
  
$21. Development of Mental Communities. 297 
In animal marriage, animal states, and flocks, we have only 
incomplete forerunners of mental communities, and they are 
generally limited to the accomplishment of certain single 
ends. The more lasting forms, animal marriage and the 
falsely named animal states (p. 279), are really sexual com- 
munities; the more transient forms or flocks, as, for example, 
flocks of migratory birds, are communities for protection. In 
all these cases it is certain instincts that have grown more 
and more fixed through transmission, which hold the individ- 
uals together. The community, therefore, shows the same 
constancy as instinct in general, and is very little modified 
by the influences of individuals. 
While animal communities are, thus, mere enlargements 
of the individual existence, aiming at certain physical vital 
ends, human development seeks from the first so to unite 
the individual with his mental environment that the whole 
is capable of development, serving at once the satisfaction of 
the physical needs of life and the pursuit of the most various 
mental ends, while permitting also great variations in these 
ends. As a result the forms of human society are exceed- 
ingly variable. The more fully developed forms, however, 
enter into a continuous train of historical development which 
extends the mental ties that connect individuals almost un- 
limitedly beyond the bounds of immediate spacial and temporal 
proximity. The final result of this development is the forma- 
tion of the notion of hewmanity as a great general inental 
community which is divided up according to the special 
conditions of life into single concrete communities, peoples, 
states, civilized societies of various kinds. races, and families. 
The mental community to which the individual belongs is, 
therefore, not one, but a changing plurality of mental unions 
which are interlaced in the most manifold ways and become 
more and more numerous as development progresses.
-P-A-G-E-316
  298 IV. Psychical Developments. 
2. The problem of tracing these developments in their 
concrete forms or even in their general interconnection, be- 
longs to the history of civilization and to general history, 
not to psychology. Still, we must give some account here 
of the general psychical conditions and the psychical pro- 
cesses arising from these conditions that distinguish social 
from individual life. 
The condition which is a prime necessity of every mental 
community at its beginning, and a continually operative factor 
in its further development, is the function of speech. This 
is what makes the development of mental communities from 
individual existences psychologically possible. In its origin it 
comes from the expressive movements of the individual, but 
as a result of its development it becomes the indispensable 
form for all the common mental contents. These common 
contents, or the mental processes which belong to the whole 
community, may be divided into #rvo classes, which are merely 
interrelated components of social life, not distinct processes 
any more than are the processes of ideation and volition 
in individual experience. The first of these classes is that 
of the common ideas, where we find especially the accepted 
conclusions on the questions of the content and significance 
of the world — these are the mythological ideas. The second 
class consists of the common motives of volition, which 
correspond to the common ideas and their attending feelings 
and emotions — these are the laws of custom. 
A. SPEECH. 
3. We obtain no information in regard to the general 
development of speech from the individual development of 
the child, because here the larger part of the process depends 
on those about him rather than on himself (p. 292 sq.) Still, 
the fact that the child learns to speak at all, shows that he
-P-A-G-E-317
  
$ 21. Development of Mental Communities. 299 
has psychical and physical traits favorable to the reception 
of language when it is communicated. In fact, it may be 
assumed that these traits would, even if there were no com- 
munications from without, lead to the development of some 
kind of expressive movements accompanied by sounds, which 
would form an incomplete language. This supposition is 
justified by observations on the deaf and dumb, especially 
deaf and dumb children who have grown up without any 
systematic education. In spite of this lack of education, an 
energetic mental intercourse may take place between them. 
In such a case, however, since the deaf and dumb can per- 
ceive only viswal signs, the intercourse must depend on the 
development of a natural gestwre-language made up of a 
combination of significant expressive movements. Feelings 
are in general expresséd by mimetic movements, ideas by 
pantomimetic, either by pointing at the object with the 
finger or by drawing some kind of picture of the idea in 
the air, that is, by means of tndicative or depicting gestures 
(p. 173). There may even be a combination of such signs 
corresponding to a series of successive ideas, and thus a kind 
of sentence may be formed, by means of which things are 
described and occurrences narrated. This natural gesture- 
language can never go any further, however, than the com- 
munication of concrete sensible ideas and their interconnection. 
Signs for abstract concepts are entirely wanting. 
4. The primitive development of articulate language can 
hardly be thought of except after the analogy of the rise 
of this natural gesture-language. The only difference is that 
in this case the ability to hear results in the addition of a third 
form of movements to the mimetic and pantomimetic move- 
ments. These are the articulatory movements, and since they 
are much more easily perceived, and capable of incomparably 
more various modification, it must of necessity follow that
-P-A-G-E-318
300 IV. Psychical Developments. 
they soon exceed the others in importance. But just as 
mimetic and pantomimetic gestures owe their intelligibility to 
the immediate relation that exists between the character of 
the movement and its meaning,-so here also we must pre- 
suppose a like relation between the original articulatory 
movement and its meaning. Then, too, it is not improbable 
that articulation was at first aided by accompanying mimetic 
and pantomimetic gestures. As evidence for this view we 
have the unrestrained use of such gestures by savages, and 
the important part they play in the child’s learning to speak. 
The development of articulate language is, accordingly, in 
all probability to be thought of as a process of differentiation, 
in which the articulatory movements have gradually gained 
the permanent ascendency over a number of different variable 
expressive movements that originally attended them, and have 
dispensed with these auxiliary movements as they themselves 
gained a sufficient degree of fixity. Psychologically the pro- 
cess may be divided into two acts. The first consists in the 
expressive movements of the individual member of the com- 
munity. These are impulsive volitional acts, among which 
the movements of the vocal organs gain the ascendency over 
the others in the effort of the individual to communicate 
with his fellows. The second consists in the subsequent 
associations between sound and idea, which gradually become 
more fixed, and spread from the centres where they originated 
through wider circles of society. 
5. From the first there are other physical and psychical 
conditions that take part in the formation of language and 
produce continual and unceasing modifications in its com- 
ponents. Such modifications may be divided into two classes: 
those of sound and those of meaning. 
The first class have their physiological cause in the 
gradual changes that take place in the physical structure of
-P-A-G-E-319
$ 21. Development of Mental Communities. 301 
the vocal organs. These changes are, to a great extent at 
least, either physically or psycho-physically conditioned. They 
come partly from the general changes which the transition 
from a savage to a civilized condition produces in the phys- 
ical organism, partly from the special conditions that result 
from increased practice in the execution of articulatory 
movements. Many phenomena go to show that the gradually 
increasing rapidity of articulation is of especially great in- 
fluence. Then, too, the words that are in any way analogous 
effect one another in a way that indicates the interference 
of the psychical factor of association. 
As the change in sound modifies the outer form of words, 
so the change in meaning modifies their inner content. The 
original association between a word and the idea it expresses 
is modified hy the substitution of another different idea. 
This process of substitution may be several times repeated 
with the same word. The change in the meaning of words 
depends, therefore, on a gradual modification of the asso- 
ciative conditions determining the ideational complication that 
shall arise in the fixation-point of consciousness when a word 
is heard or spoken. It may, accordingly, be briefly defined 
as a shifting of the ideational component of the complications 
connected with articulate sounds (p. 234). 
These changes in the sound and meaning of words operate 
together in bringing about the gradual disappearance of the 
originally necessary relation between sound and meaning, so 
that a word finally. comes to be looked upon as a mere ex- 
ternal sign of the idea. This process is so complete that 
even those verbal forms in which this relation seems to be 
still retained, onomatopoetic words, appear to be, for the 
most part, products of a relatively late and secondary assim- 
ilative process which seek~ to reestablish the lost affinity 
between sound and meaning.
-P-A-G-E-320
  302 IV. Psychical Developments. 
Another important consequence of this combined action 
of changes in sound and meaning, is to be found in the fact 
that many words gradually lose entirely their original con- 
crete sensible significance, and become signs of general con- 
cepts and means for the expression of the apperceptive 
relating and comparing functions and their products. In 
this way abstract thinking is developed. It would be im- 
possible without the change in meaning of words upon which 
it is based and it is, therefore, a product of the psychical and 
psycho-physical interactions from which the progressive devel- 
opment of language results. ; 
6. Just as the components of language, or words, are under- 
going a continual development in sound and meaning, so in 
the same way, though generally more slowly, changes are 
going on in the combinations of these components into com- 
plete wholes, that is, in sentences. No language can be 
thought of without some such syntactic order of its words. 
Sentences and words are, therefore, equally primitive as 
psychological forms of thought. In a certain sense the sen- 
tence may even be called the earlier, for, especially in the 
more incomplete stages of language, the words of a sentence 
are so uncertainly distinguished that they seem to be nothing 
but the products of a breaking up of an originally unitary 
thought expressed by the whole sentence. There is no uni- 
yersal rule for the order of words, any more than there is 
for the relation of sound to meaning. The order that logic 
favors with a view to the relations of reciprocal logical de- 
pendence between concepts, has no psychological universality ; 
it appears, in fact, to be a fairly late product of development, 
due in part to arbitrary convention, and approached only 
by the prose forms of some modern languages which are 
syntactically nearly fixed. The original principle followed 
in apperceptive combination of words is obviously this, the
-P-A-G-E-321
  
§ 21. Development of Mental Communities. 303 
order of the words corresponds to the succession of ideas. 
Especially those parts of speech that represent the ideas 
which arouse the most intense feelings and attract the atten- 
tion, are placed first. Following this principle, certain re- 
gularities in the order of words are developed in any given 
community. In fact, such a regularity is to be observed 
even in the natural gesture-language of the deaf and dumb. 
Still, it is easy to understand that the most various modi- 
fications in this respect may appear under special circumstances, 
and that the possible range of these modifications is very 
great. In general, however, the habits of association lead 
more and more to the fixation of particular syntactic forms, 
so that a certain rigidity usually results. 
Apart from the general laws presented in the discussion 
of apperceptive combinations, and there shown to arise from 
the general psychical functions of relating and comparing 
(p. 264), the detailed discussion of the characteristics of syn- 
tactic combinations and their gradual changes, must be left, 
in spite of their psychological importance, to social psy- 
chology, because they depend so much on the specific dis- 
positions and conditions of civilization in a given community. 
B. MYTHS. 
7. The development of myths is closely related to that 
of language. Mythological thought is based, to be sure, 
just as language itself, upon certain attributes that are never 
lost in human consciousness; still, these attributes are modi- 
fied and limited by a great variety of influences. As the 
fundamental function which in its various forms of activity 
gives rise to all mythological ideas, we have a characteristic 
kind of apperception belonging to all naive consciousness and 
suitably designated by the name personifying apperception. 
It consists in the complete determination of the app:rceived  
-P-A-G-E-322
  304 IV. Psychical Developments. 
objects through the nature of the perceiving subject. The 
subject not only sees his own sensations, emotions, and 
voluntary movements reproduced in the objects, but even his 
momentary affective state is in each case especially influential 
in determining his view of the phenomena perceived, and in 
arousing ideas of their relations to his own existence. As 
a necessary result of such a view the same personal attri- 
butes that the subject finds in himself are assigned to the 
object. The inner attributes, of feeling, emotion, etc., are 
never omitted, while the owter attributes of voluntary action 
and other manifestations like those of men, are generally 
dependent on movements actually perceived. The savage may 
thus attribute to stones, plants, and works of art, an inner 
capacity for sensations and feelings and their resulting effects, 
but he usually assumes immediate action only in the case of 
moving objects, such as clouds, heavenly bodies, winds, etc. 
Im all these cases the personification is favored by associative 
assimilations which may readily reach the intensity of illusions | 
of fancy (p. 268). 
8. Myth-making, or personifying, apperception is not to 
be regarded as a special form or even as a distinct sub-form 
of apperception. It is nothing but the natural inceptive stage 
of apperception in general. The child shows continually 
obvious traces of it, partly in the activities of his imagination 
in play (p. 293), partly in the fact that strong emotions, 
especially fear and fright, easily arouse illusions of fancy 
with an affective character analogous to that of the emotion. 
In this case, however, the manifestations of a tendency to 
form myths are early checked and soon entirely suppressed 
throug]: the influences of the child’s environment and education. 
With savage and partly civilized peoples it is different. There 
the surrounding influences present a whole mass of mythological 
ideas t» the individual consciousness. These, too, originated
-P-A-G-E-323
  
§ 21. Development of Mental Communities. 305 
in the minds of individuals, and have gradually become fixed 
in some particular community, and in continual interrelation 
with language have, like the latter, been transmitted from 
generation to generation and become gradually modified in 
the transition from savage to civilized conditions. 
9. The direction.in which these modifications take place, 
is determined in general by the fact that the affective state 
of the subject at the time is, as above remarked, the chief. 
influence in settling the character of the myth-making apper- 
ception. In order to gain some notion of the way in 
which the affective state of the subject has changed from 
the first beginnings of mental development to the present, 
we must appeal to the history of the development of mytholog- 
ical ideas, for other evidences are entirely wanting. It ap- 
pears that in all cases the earliest mythological ideas referred, 
on the one hand, to the personal fate in the immediate future, 
and were determined, on the other, by the emotions aroused 
by the death of comrades and by the memory of them, and 
also’ in a high degree by the memories of dreams. This 
is the source of so-called “animism”, that is, all those ideas 
in which the spirits of the dead take the parts of controllers 
of fortune and bring about either weal or woe in human 
life. “Fetishism” is a branch of animism, in which the 
attribute of ability to control fate is carried over tu various 
objects in the environment, such as animals, plants, stones, 
works of art, especially those that attract the attention on 
account of their striking character or of some accidental outer 
circumstance. The phenomena of animism and fetishism 
are. not only the earliest, but also the most lasting, productions 
of myth-making apperception. They continue, even after all 
others are suppressed, in the various forms of sup:rstitions 
among civilized peoples, such as belief in ghosts, enchant- 
ments, charms, ete.

  306 IV. Psychical Developments. 
10. After consciousness reaches a more advanced stage, 
personifying apperception begins to deal with the greater 
natural phenomena which act upon human life both through 
their changes and through their direct influence, such as the 
clouds, rivers, winds, and greater heavenly bodies. The 
regularity of certain natural phenomena, such as the alterna- 
tion of night and day, of winter and summer, the processes 
in a thunderstorm, etc., gives occasion for the formation of 
poetical myths, in which a series of interconnected ideas are 
woven into one united whole. In this way the natwre-myth 
arises, which from its very character challenges the poetic power 
of each individual to develop it further. It thus becomes 
gradually a component of popular and then of literary poetry, 
and undergoes a change in meaning through the fading out 
of some of the features of the single mythical figures and 
the appearance of other new features. This change, in turn, 
makes possible a progressive inner change of the myth, 
analogous to the change in words, by which it is always 
accompanied. As the process goes on, single poets and 
thinkers gain an increasing influence. 
In this way, there gradually results a division of the 
whole content of mythological thought into science (philosophy) 
and religion, while, at the same time, the nature-gods in 
religion give place more and more to ethical ideas of deity. 
After this division has taken place, the two departments in- 
fluence each other mutually in many important ways. Still, 
these facts must be left to social psychology and the history of 
civilization, for they must be discussed in the light of special 
social conditions as well as of general psychological laws. 
C. CUSTOMS. 
11. The development of customs is related to that of 
myths in the same way that outer volitional acts are related
-P-A-G-E-325
§ 21. Development of Mental Communities. 307 
to inner motives. -Wherever we can trace out the origin of 
ancient and wide-spread customs with any degree of proba- 
bility, we find that they are remnants or modifications of 
certain cult-forms. Thus, the funeral feasts and burial cere- 
monies of civilized peoples point to a primitive ancestor- 
worship. Numerous feasts and ceremonies connected with 
particular days, with the change of the seasons, the tillage 
of the fields, and the gathering of the harvest, all point back 
to nature-myths. The custom of greeting, in its various forms, 
betrays its direct derivation from the ceremonies of prayer. 
This does not exclude the possibility that other motives 
also, especially those of practical utility, have given rise to 
what were at first individual habits, but gradually. spread 
throughout a community and thus became laws of custom. 
The predéminant feature of this development, however, is 
the fact that primitive customs, even when they incidentally 
serve practical needs, as, for example, the custom of wearing 
a uniform pattern of clothes, of having meals at a regular time, 
etc., still depend more or less on particular mythological ideas. 
In fact, it would be hard to think of it as otherwise at a 
time when consciousness was under the complete control of 
a myth-making apperception. 
12. With customs, as with language, the change in meaning 
has exercised a modifying influence on their development. As 
a result of this change, two chief kinds of transformation 
have taken place. In the first, the original mythical motive 
has been lost and no new one has taken its place. The 
custom continues as a consequence of associative habit, but 
loses its imperative character and becomes much weaker in 
its outward manifestations. In the second class of trans- 
formations, a moral-social purpose takes the place of the 
original mytho-religious motive. The two kinds of change 
may in any single case be most intimately united; and even 
20*
-P-A-G-E-326
  308 IV. Psychical Developments. 
when a custom does not serve any particular social end 
directly, as is the case, for example, with certain rules of 
deportment, of etiquette, on the manner of dressing, eating, 
etc., still it may do so indirectly in that the existence of some 
common rules for the members of a community is favorable 
to their united life and therefore to their common mental 
development. 
13. The psychological changes in customs as pointed out, 
constitute the preparation for their differentiation into three 
spheres, namely those of custom, of law, and of morality. 
The last two are to be regarded as special forms of custom 
aiming at moral-social ends. The detailed investigation of 
the psychological development and differentiation of customs 
in general is, however, a problem of social psychology, and 
the discussion of the rise of law and morality beléng also to 
general history and ethics. 
14. We have here, in mental communities, and especially 
in their development of language, myths, and customs, mental 
interconnections and interactions that differ in essential respects 
from the interconnection of the psychical compounds in an 
individual consciousness, but still have just as much reality 
as the individual consciousness itself. In this sense we may 
speak of the interconnection of the ideas and feelings of a 
social community as a collective consciousness, and of the 
common volitional tendencies as a collective will. In doing 
this we are not to forget that these concepts do not mean 
something that exists apart from the conscious and volitional 
processes of the individual, any more than the community 
itself is something besides the union of individuals. Since 
this union, however, brings forth certain mental products, 
such as language, myths, and customs, for which only the 
germs are present in the individual, and since it deter- 
mines the development of the individual from a very early
-P-A-G-E-327
  
§ 21. Development of Mental Communities. 309 
period, it is just as much an object of psychology as the 
individual consciousness. For psychology must give an account 
of the interactions which give rise to the products and attributes 
of collective consciousness and of the collective will. 
14a. The facts arising from the existence of mental com- 
munities have only recently come within the pale of psychological 
investigation. These problems were formerly referred either to the 
special mental sciences (philology, history, jurisprudence, etc.) or, if 
of a more general character, to philosophy, that is to metaphysics. 
If psychology did touch upon them at all, it was dominated, as 
were the special sciences, history, jurisprudence, etc., by the 
reflective method of popular psychology, which tends to treat all 
mental products of communities, to as great an extent as possible, 
as voluntary inventions aimed from the first at certain utilitarian 
ends. This view found its chief philosophical expression in the 
doctrine of a social contract, according to which a mental com- 
munity is not something original and natural, but is derived from 
the voluntary union of a number of individuals. This position 
is psychologically untenable, and completely helpless in the presence 
of the problems of social psychology. As one of its after-effects 
we have even to-day the grossest misunderstandings of the concepts 
collective consciousness and collective will. Instead of regarding 
them simply as expressions for the actual agreement and inter- 
action of individuals in a community, some still suspect that there 
is behind them a mythological being of some kind, or at least a 
metaphysical substance.

  VY. PSYCHICAL CAUSALITY 
AND ITS LAWS. 
§ 22. CONCEPT OF MIND. 
1. Every empirical science has, as its primary and charac- 
teristic subject of treatment, certain particular facts of ex- 
perience whose nature and reciprocal relations it seeks to 
investigate. In solving these problems it is found to be 
necessary, if we are not ‘to give up entirely the grouping 
of the facts under leading heads, to have general supplemen- 
tary concepts that are not contained in experience itself, but 
are gained by a process of logical treatment of this experience. 
The most general supplementary concept of this kind that 
has found its place in all the empirical sciences, is the concept 
of causality. It comes from the necessity of thought that 
all our experiences shall be arranged according to reason 
and consequent, and that we shall remove, by means of 
secondary supplementary concepts and if need be by means 
of concepts of a hypothetical character, all contradictions 
that stand in the way of the establishment of a consistent 
interconnection of this kind. In this sense we may regard 
all the supplementary concepts that serve for the interpretation 
of any sphere of experience, as applications of the general 
principle of causation. They are justified in so far as they 
are required, or at least rendered probable, by this principle; 
they are unjustifiable so soon as they prove to be arbitrary
-P-A-G-E-329
  § 22. Concept of Mind. 311 
fictions resulting from foreign motives, and contributing 
nothing to the interpretation of experience. 
2. In this sense the concept matter is a fundamental 
supplementary concept of natural science. In its most general 
significance it designates the permanent substratum assumed 
as existing in universal space, to whose activities we must 
attribute all natural phenomena. In this most general sense 
the concept matter is indispensable to every explanation of 
natural science. The attempt in recent times to raise energy 
to the position of a governing principle, does not succeed in 
doing away with the concept matter, but merely gives it a 
different content. This content, however, is given to the 
concept by means of a second supplementary concept, which 
relates to the causal activity of matter. The concept of 
matter that has been accepted in natural science up to the 
present time, is based upon the mechanical physics of Galileo, 
and uses as its secondary supplementary concept the concept 
of force, which is defined as the product of the mass and the 
momentary acceleration. A physics of energy would have to 
use everywhere instead of this the concept energy, which in 
the special form of mechanical energy is defined as half the 
product of the mass multiplied by the square of the velocity. 
Energy, however, must, just as well as force, have a position 
in objective space, and under certain particular conditions the 
points from which energy proceeds may, just as well as the 
points from which force proceeds, change their place in space, 
so that the concept of matter as a substratum contained in 
space, is retained in both cases. The only difference, and 
it is indeed an important one, is that when we use the con- 
cept force, we presuppose the reducibility of all natural 
phenomena to forms of mechanical motion, while when we 
use the concept of energy, we attribute to matter not only 
the property of motion without a change in the form of
-P-A-G-E-330
  312 V. Psychical Causality and its Laws. 
energy, but also the property of the transformability of quali- 
tatively different forms of energy into one another without 
a change in the quantity of the. energy. 
3. The concept of mind is a supplementary concept of 
psychology, in the same way that the concept matter is a 
supplementary concept of natural science. It too is indis- 
pensable in so far as we need a concept which shall express 
in a comprehensive way the totality of psychical experiences 
in an individual consciousness. The particular content of the 
concept, however, is in this case also entirely dependent on 
the secondary concepts that give a more detailed definition of 
psychical causality. In the definition of this content psy- 
chology shared at first the fortune of the natural sciences. 
Both the concept of mind and that of matter arose primarily 
not so much from the need of explaining experience as from 
the effort to reach a systematic doctrine of the general inter- 
connection of all things. But while the natural sciences have 
long since outgrown this mythological stage of speculative 
definition, and make use of some of the single ideas that 
originated at that time, only for the purpose of gaining definite 
starting-points for a strict methodical definition of their con- 
cepts, psychology has continued under the control of the 
mythological, metaphysical concept of mind down to most 
modern times, and still remains, in part at least, under its 
control. This concept is not used as a general supplemen- 
tary concept that serves primarily to gather together the 
psychical facts and only secondarily to give a causal inter- 
pretation of them, but it is employed as a means to satisfy 
so far as possible the need of a general universal system, 
including both nature and the individual existence. 
4. The concept of a mind-substance in its various forms 
is rooted in this mythological and metaphysical need. In its 
development there have not been wanting efforts to meet
-P-A-G-E-331
  
§ 22. Concept of Mind. 313 
from this position, so far as possible, the demand for a 
psychological causal explanation, still, such efforts have in 
all cases been afterthoughts; and it is perfectly obvious that 
psychological experience alone, independent of all foreign 
metaphysical motives, would never have led to a concept of 
mind-substance. This concept has beyond a doubt exercised 
a harmful influence on the treatment of experience. The view, 
for example, that all the contents of psychical experience are 
ideas, and that these ideas are more or less permanent ob- 
jects, would hardly be comprehensible without such presup- 
positions. That this concept is really foreign to psychology, 
is further attested by the close interconnection in which it 
stands to the concept of material substance. It is regarded 
either as identical with the latter, or else as distinct in nature, 
but still reducible in its most general formal characteristics 
to one of the particular forms of the concept matter, namely 
to the atom. 
5. Two forms of the concept mind-substance may he 
distinguished, corresponding to the two types of metaphysical 
psychology pointed out above (§ 2, p. 6). The one is 
materialistic and regards psychical processes as the activities 
of matter or of certain material complexes, such as the 
brain-elements. The other is spiritualistic and looks upon 
these processes as states and changes in an unextended and 
therefore indivisible and permanent being of a specifically 
spiritual nature. In this case matter is thought of as made up 
of similar atoms of a lower order (monistic, or monado-logic al 
spiritualism), or the mind-atom is regarded as specifically 
different from matter proper (dualistic spiritualism) (comp. p. 7). 
In both its materialistic and spiritualistic forms, the con- 
cept mind-substance does nothing for the interpretation of 
psychological experience. Materialism does away with psy- 
chology entirely and puts in its place an imaginary brain-
-P-A-G-E-332
  314 V. Psychical Causality and its Laws. 
physiology of the future, or when it tries to give positive 
theories, falls into doubtful and unreliable hypotheses of cere- 
bral physiology. In thus giving up psychology in any proper 
sense, this doctrine gives up entirely the attempt to furnish 
any practical basis for the mental sciences. Spiritualism 
allows psychology as such to continue, but:subordinates actual 
experience to entirely arbitrary metaphysical hypotheses, 
through which the unprejudiced observation of psychical 
processes is obstructed. This appears first of all in the in- 
correct statement of the problem of psychology, with which 
the metaphysical theories start. They regard inner and outer 
experience as totally heterogeneous, though in some external 
way interacting, spheres. 
6. It has been shown (§ 1, p. 3) that the experience 
dealt with in the natural sciences and in psychology are 
nothing but components of one experience regarded from 
different points of view: in the natural sciences 4s an inter- 
connection of objective phenomena and, in consequence of 
the abstraction from the knowing subject, as mediate ex- 
perience; in psychology as tmmediate and underived ex- 
perience. 
When this relation is once understood, the concept of a 
mind-substance immediately gives place to the concept of the 
actuality of mind as a basis for the comprehension of psy- 
chical processes. Since the psychological treatment of ex- 
perience is supplementary to that of the natural sciences, in 
that it deals with the immediate reality of experience, it 
follows naturally that there is no place in psychology for 
hypothetical supplementary concepts such as are necessary 
in the natural sciences because of their concept of an object 
independent of the subject. In this sense, the concept of 
the actuality of mind does not require any hypothetical 
determinants to define its particular contents, as the concept
-P-A-G-E-333
  
$ 22. Concept of Mind. 315 
of matter does, but quite to the contrary, it excludes such 
hypothetical elements from the first by defining the nature 
of mind as the immediate reality of the processes themselves. 
Still, since one important component of these processes, 
namely the totality of ideational objects, is at the same time 
the subject of consideration in the natural sciences, it ne- 
cessarily follows that substance and actuality are concepts 
that refer to one and the same general experience, with the 
difference that in each case this experience is looked at from 
a different point of view. If we abstract from the knowing 
subject in our treatment of the world of experience, it appears 
as a manifold of interacting substances; if, on the contrary, 
we regard it as the total content of the experience of the 
subject including the subject itself, it appears as a manifold 
of interrelated occurrences. In the first case, phenomena 
are looked upon as outer phenomena, in the sense that they 
would take place just the same, even if the knowing subject 
were not there at all, so that we may call the form of ex- 
perience dealt with in the natural sciences owter experience. 
In the second case, on the contrary, all the contents of 
experience are regarded as belonging directly to the 
Imowing subject, so that we may call the psychological 
attitude towards experience that of immer experience. In 
this sense outer and inner experience are identical with 
mediate and immediate, or with. objective and subjective 
forms of experience. They all serve to designate, not different 
spheres of experience, but different supplementary points of 
view in the consideration of an experience which is presented 
to us as an absolute unity. 
7. That the method of treating experience employed in 
natural science should have reached its maturity before that 
employed in psychology, is easily comprehensible in view of 
the practical interest connected with the discovery of regular 
 
-P-A-G-E-334
  316 V. Psychical Causality and its Laws. 
natural phenomena thought of as independent of the subject; 
and it was almost unavoidable that this priority of the natural 
sciences should, for a long time, lead to a confusion of the 
two points of view. This did really occur as we see by the 
different psychological substance-concepts. It is for this reason 
that the reform in the fundamental position of psychology, 
which looks for the characteristics of this science and for its 
problems, not in the specifically distinct nature of its sphere, 
but in its method of considering all the contents presented 
to us in experience in their immediate reality, unmodified by 
any hypothetical supplementary concepts — this reform did 
not originate with psychology itself, but with the single 
mental sciences. The view of mental processes based upon the 
concept of actuality, was familiar in these sciences long be- 
fore it was accepted in psychology. This inadmissible dif- 
ference between the fundamental position of psychology and 
the mental sciences is what has kept psychology until the 
present time from fulfilling its mission of serving as a foun- 
dation for all the mental sciences. 
8. When the concept of actuality is adopted, a question 
upon which metaphysical systems of psychology have been 
long divided is immediately disposed of. This is the question 
of the relation of body and mind. So long as body and 
mind are both regarded as substances, this relation must 
remain an enigma, however the two concepts of substance 
may be defined. If they are like substances, then the different 
contents of experience as dealt with in the natural sciences 
and in psychology can no longer be understood, and there 
is no alternative but to deny the independence of one of 
these forms of knowledge. If they are unlike substances, their 
connection is a continual miracle. If we start with the theory 
of the actuality of mind, we recognize the immediate reality of 
the phenomena in psychological experience. Our physiological
-P-A-G-E-335
  § 22. Concept of Mind. 317 
concept of the bodily organism, on the other hand, is nothing 
but a part of this experience, which we gain, just as we do 
all the other empirical contents of the natural sciences, by 
assuming the existence of an object independent of the 
knowing subject. Certain components of mediate experience 
may correspond to certain components of immediate experience, 
without its being necessary, for this reason, to reduce the 
one to the other or to derive one from the other. In fact, 
such a derivation is absolutely impossible because of the 
totally different points of view adopted in the two cases. 
Still, the fact that we have here not different objects of 
experience, but different points of view in looking at a uni- 
tary experience, renders necessary the existence at every point 
of rélations between the two. At the same time it must 
be remembered that there is an infinite number of objects 
that can be approached only mediately, through the method 
of the natural sciences: here belong all those phenomena 
that we are not obliged to regard as physiological substrata 
of psychical processes. On the other hand, there is just as 
large a number of important facts that are presented only 
immediately, or in psychological experience: these are all 
those contents of our subjective consciousness which do not 
have the character of ideational objects, that is, the character 
of contents which are directly referred to external objects. 
9. As a result of this relation, it follows that there must 
be a necessary relation between all the facts that belong at 
the same time to both kinds of experience, to the mediate 
experience of the natural sciences and to the immediate ex- 
perience of psychology, for they are nothing but components 
of a single experience which is merely regarded in the two cases 
from different points of view. Since these facts belong to both 
spheres, there must be an elementary process on the physical 
side, corresponding to every such process on the psychical
-P-A-G-E-336
  318 V. Psychical Causality and its Laws. 
side. This general principle is known as the principle of 
psycho-physical parallelism. It has an empirico-psychological 
significance and is thus totally different from certain meta- 
physical principles that have sometimes been designated by 
the same name, but in reality have an entirely different 
meaning. These metaphysical principles are all based on 
the hypothesis of a psychical substance. They all seek to 
solve the problem of the interrelation of body and mind, either 
by assuming two real substances with attributes which are 
different, but parallel in their changes, or by assuming one 
substance with two distinct attributes that correspond in their 
modifications. In both these cases the metaphysical principle 
of parallelism is based on the assumption that every physical 
process has a corresponding psychical process and_ vice 
versa; or on the assumption that the mental world is a 
mirroring of the bodily world, or that the bodily world is an 
objective realization of the mental. This assumption is, 
however, entirely indemonstrable and arbitrary, and leads in 
its psychological application to an intellectualism contradictory 
to all experience. The psychological principle, on the other 
hand, as above formulated, starts with the assumption that 
there is only one experience, which, however, as soon as it 
becomes the subject of scientific analysis, is, in some of its 
components, open to éo different kinds of scientific treatment: 
to a mediate form of treatment, which investigates ideated 
objects in their objective relations to one another, and to an 
immediate form, which investigates the same objects in their 
directly known character, and in their relations to all the other 
contents of the experience of the knowing subject. So far as 
there are objects to which both these forms of treatment are 
applicable, the psychological principle of parallelism requires, 
between the processes on the two sides, a relation at every 
point. This requirement is justified by the fact that both 
 
-P-A-G-E-337
$ 22. Concept of Mind. 319 
forms of analysis are in these two cases really analyses of 
one and the same content of experience. On the other hand, 
from the very nature of the case, the psychological principle 
of parallelism can not apply to those contents of experience 
which are objects of natural-scientific analysis alone, or to 
those which go to make up the specific character of psy- 
chological experience. Among the latter we must reckon the 
characteristic combinations and relations of psychical elements 
and compounds. To be sure, there are.combinations of phys- 
ical processes running parallel to these, in so far at least 
as a direct or indirect causal relation must exist between the 
physical processes whose regular coexistence or succession is 
indicated by a psychical interconnection, but the character- 
istic content of the psychical combination can, of course, in 
“no way be a part of the causal relation between the physical 
processes. Thus, for example, the elements that enter into 
a spacial or temporal idea, stand in a regular relation of 
coexistence and succession in their physiological substrata 
also; or the ideational elements that make up a process of 
relating or comparing psychical contents, have corresponding 
combinations of physiological excitation of some kind or other, 
which are repeated whenever these psychical processes take 
place. But the physiological processes can not contain any- 
thing of that which goes most of all to form the specific 
nature of spacial and temporal ideas, or of relating and com- 
paring processes, because natural science purposely cbstracts 
from all that is here concerned. Then, too, there are two con- 
cepts that result from the psychical combinations, which, 
together with their related affective elements, lie entirely 
outside the sphere of experience to which the principle of 
parallelism applies. There are the concepts of value and 
end. The forms of combination that we see in processes 
of fusion or in associative and apperceptive processes, as well

as the values that they possess in the whole interconnection 
of psychical development, can only be understood through 
psychological analysis, in the same way that objective phe- 
nomena, such as those of weight, sound, light, heat, etc., or 
the processes of the nervous system, can be approached only 
by physical and physiological analysis, that is, analysis that 
makes use of the supplementary substance-concepts of natural 
science. 
10. Thus, the principle of psycho-physical parallelism in 
the incontrovertible empirico-psychological significance above 
attributed to it, leads necessarily to the recognition of an 
independent psychical causality, which is related at all points 
with physical causality and can never come into contradiction 
with it, but is just as different from this physical causality 
as the point of view adopted in psychology, or that of im- 
mediate, subjective experience, is different from the point of 
view taken in the natural sciences, or that of mediate, ob- 
jective experience due to abstraction. And just as the nature 
of physical causality can be revealed to us only in the fun- 
damental laws of nature, so the only way that we have of 
accounting for the characteristics of psychical causality is to 
abstract certain fundamental laws of psychical phenomena 
from the totality of psychical processes. We may distinguish 
two classes of such laws. The laws of one class show them- 
selves primarily in the processes which condition the rise and 
immediate interaction of the psychical compounds; we call 
these the psychological laws of relation. Those of the second 
class are derived laws. They consist in the complex effects 
that are produced by combinations of the laws of relation 
within more extensive series of psychical facts; these we call 
the psy hological laws of development.

§ 23. PSYCHOLOGICAL LAWS OF RELATION. 
1. There are three general psychological laws of relation. 
We designate them as the laws of psychical resultants, of 
psychical relations, and of psychical contrasts. 
2. The law of psychical resultants tinds its expression in 
the fact that every psychical compound shows attributes which 
may indeed be understood from the attributes of its elements 
after these elements have once been presented, but which are 
by no means to be looked upon as the mere sum of the 
attributes of these elements. A compound clang is more in 
its ideational and affective attributes than merely a sum of 
single tones. In spacial and temporal ideas the spacial and 
temporal arrangement is conditioned, to be sure, in a per- 
fectly regular way by the cooperation of the elements that 
make up the idea, but still the arrangement itself can by no 
means be regarded as a property belonging to the sensational 
elements themselves. The nativistic theories that assume this, 
implicate themselves in contradictions that cannot be solved; 
and besides, in so far as they admit subsequent changes in 
the original space-perceptions and time-perceptions, they are 
ultimately driven to the assumption of the rise, to some 
extent at least, of new attributes. Finally, in the apperceptive 
functions and in the activities of imagination and under- 
standing, this law finds expression in a clearly recognized form. 
Not only do the elements united by apperceptive synthesis 
gain, in the aggregate idea that results from their combination, 
a new significance which they did not have in their isolated 
state, but what is of still greater importance, the aggregate 
idea itself is a new psychical content that was made possible, 
to be sure, by these elements, but was by no means contained 
in them. This appears most strikingly in the more complex 
Wonpr, Psychology. 2"

322 V. Psychical Causality and its Laws. 
productions of apperceptive synthesis, as, for example, in a 
work of art or a train of logical thought. 
3. The law of psychical resultants thus expresses a prin- 
ciple which we may designate, in view of its results, as a 
principle of creative synthesis. This has long been recognized 
in the case of higher mental creations, but generally not 
applied to the other psychical processes. In fact, through 
an unjustifiable confusion with the laws of physical causality, 
it has even been completely reversed. A similar confusion is 
responsible for the notion that there is a contradiction be- 
tween the principle of creative synthesis in the mental world 
and the general laws of the natural world, especially that of 
the conservation of energy. Such a contradiction is impossible 
from the outset because the points of view for judgment, 
and therefore for measurements wherever such are made, are 
different in the two cases, and must be different, since natural 
science and psychology deal, not with different contents of 
experience, but with one and the same content viewed from 
different sides (§ 1, p. 3). Physical measurements have to 
do with objective masses, forces, and energies. These are 
supplementary concepts which we are obliged to use in 
judging objective experience; and their general laws, derived 
as they are from experience, must not be contradicted 
by any single case of experience. Psychical measurements, 
which are concerned with the comparison of psychical com- 
ponents and their resultants, have to do with subjective values 
and ends. The subjective value of a whole may increase 
in comparison with that of its components; its purpose may 
be different and higher than theirs without any change in 
the masses, forces, and energies concerned. The muscular 
movements of an external volitional act, the physical processes 
that accompany sense-perception, association. and apperception, 
all follow invariably the principle of the conservation of energy.
-P-A-G-E-341
  $ 23. Psychological Laws of Relation. 323 
But the mental values and ends that these energies re- 
present may be very different in quantity even while the 
quantity of these energies remains the same. 
4. The differences pointed out show that physical measure- 
ment deals with quantitative values, that is, with quantities 
that admit of a variation in value only in the one re- 
lation of the quantity of the phenomena measured. Psychical 
measurement, on the other hand, deals in the last instance 
in every case with qualitative values, that is, values that vary 
in degree only in respect to their qualitative character. The 
ability to produce purely quantitative effects, which we designate 
as physical energy is, accordingly, to be clearly distinguished 
from the ability to produce qualitative effects, or the ability to 
produce values, which we designate as psychical energy. 
On this basis we can not only reconcile the increase of 
psychical energy with the constancy of physical energy as 
accepted in the natural sciences, but we find in the two 
reciprocally supplementary standards for the judgment of our 
total experience. The increase of psychical energy is not seen 
in its right light until it is recognized as the reverse, sub- 
jective side of physical constancy. The former, being as it 
is indefinite, since the measure may be very different under 
different conditions, holds only wnder the condition that the 
psychical processes are continuous. As the psychological cor- 
relate of this increase we have the fact which forces itself 
upon us in experience, that psychical values disappeur. 
5. The law of psychical relations supplements that of 
resultants; it refers not to the relation of the components of 
a psychical interconnection to the value of the whole, but 
yvather to their reciprocal relation. The law of resultants thus 
holds for the synthetic processes of consciousness, the law 
of relations for the analytic. Every resolution of a conscious 
content into its single members is an act of relating analysis. 
21%
-P-A-G-E-342
324 V. Psychical Causality and its Laws. 
Such a resolution takes place in the successive apperception 
of the parts of a whole which is ideated at first only in a 
general way, a process which is to be seen in sense- perceptions 
and associations, and then in clearly recognized form in the 
division of aggregate ideas. In the same way, every apper- 
ception is an analytic process whose two factors are the 
emphasizing of one single content and the marking off of this 
one content from all others. The first of these two partial 
processes is what produces clearness, the second is what 
produces distinctness of apperception (p. 208, 4). The most 
complete expression of this law is to be found in the processes 
of apperceptive analysis and the simple relating and comparing 
functions upon which it is based (p. 250 and 260). In the 
latter more especially, we see that the essential content of 
the law of relations is the principle that every single psychical 
content receives its significance from the relations in which it 
stands to other psychical contents. When these relations are 
quantitative, this principle takes the form of a principle of 
relative quantitative comparison such as is expressed in Weber's 
law (p. 254). 
6. The lave of psychical contrasts is, in turn, supplementary 
to the law of relations. It refers, like the latter, to the relations 
of psychical contents to one another.. It is itself based on the 
fundamental division of the immediate contents of experience 
into objective and subjective components, a division which 
is due to the very conditions of psychical development. Under 
subjective components are included all the elements and com- 
binations of elements which, like the feelings and emotions, 
are essential constituents of volitional processes. These are all 
arranged in groups made up of opposite qualities corresponding 
to the chief affective directions of pleasurable and un- 
pleasurable, exciting and depressing, straining and relaxing 
feelings (p. 83). These opposites obey in their succession the 
 
-P-A-G-E-343
  
§ 24. Psychological Laws of Development. 325 
general law of intensificativn through contrast. In its con- 
crete application, this law is always determined in part by 
special temporal conditions, for every subjective state requires 
a certain period for its development; and if, when it has once 
reached its maximum, it continues for a long time, it loses 
its ability to arouse the contrast-effect. This fact is connected 
with the other, that there is a certain medium, though greatly 
varying, rate of psychical processes most favorable for the 
intensity of all feelings and emotions. 
This law of contrast has its origin in the attributes of 
the subjective contents of experience, but is secondarily applied 
to the ideas and their elements also, for these ideas are always 
accompanied by more or less emphatic feelings due either 
to their own content or to the character of their spacial and 
temporal combination. Thus the principle of intensification 
through contrast finds its broader application especially in the 
case of certain sensations, such as those of sight, and in the 
case of spacial and temporal ideas. 
7. The law of contrast stands in close relation to the two 
preceding laws. On the one hand, it may be regarded as 
the application of the general law of relations to the special 
case where the related psychical contents range between 
opposites. On the other hand, the fact that under suitable 
circumstances antithetical psychical processes may intensify 
each other, while falling under the law. of contrast, is at the 
same time a special application of the principle of creative 
synthesis. 
§ 24. PSYCHOLOGICAL LAWS OF DEVELOPMENT. 
1. We have as many psychological laws of development 
as we had laws of relation, and the former may be regarded 
as the application of the latter to more comprehensive psychical
-P-A-G-E-344
326 V. Psychical Causality and its Laws. 
interconnections. We designate the laws in question as those 
of mental growth, of heterogony of ends, and of development 
towards opposites. 
2. The law of mental growth is as little applicable to all 
contents of psychical experience. as any other psychological 
Jaw of development. It holds only under the limiting con- 
dition under which the law of resultants, whose application 
it is, holds, namely under the condition of the continuity of 
the processes (p. 323). But since the circumstances that tend 
to prevent the realization of this condition, are, of course, 
much more frequent when the mental developments concerned 
include a greater number of psychical syntheses, than they 
are in the single syntheses themselves, it follows that the law 
of mental growth can be demonstrated only for certain develop- 
ments taking place under normal conditions, and even here 
only within certain limits. Within these limits, however, the 
more comprehensive developments, as, for example, the mental 
development of the normal individual and the development of 
mental communities, are obviously the best exemplifications 
of the fundamental law of resultants which lies at the basis 
of this development. 
3. The law of heterogony of ends is most closely con- 
nected with the law of relations, but it is also based on the 
law of resultants, which is always to be taken into consideration 
when dealing with the larger interconnections of psychical 
development. In fact, we may regard this law as a principle 
of development which controls the changes arising, as results 
of successive creative syntheses, in the relations between the 
single partial contents of psychical compounds. The result- 
ants arising from united psychical processes include contents 
that were not present in the components, and these new con- 
tents may in turn enter into relation with the old components, 
thus changing again the relations between these.old components 
 
-P-A-G-E-345
  
§ 24, Psychological Laws of Development. 327 
and consequently the new resultants that arise from them. 
This principle of continually changing relations is most striking 
when an idea of ends is formed on the basis of the given 
relations. Here the relation of the single factors to one 
another is regarded as an interconnection of means which 
has for the end aimed at, the product arising from the 
interconnection. The relation between the actual effects in 
such a case and the ideated ends is such that secondary 
effects always arise that were not thought of in the first ideas 
of end. These new effects enter into new series of motives, 
and thus modify the old ends or add new ones to them. 
The principle of heterogony of ends in its broadest sense 
dominates all psychical processes. In the special teleolog- 
ical coloring which has given it its name, however, it is to be 
found primarily in the sphere of volitional processes, for here 
the ideas of end attended by their affective motives are of 
the chief importance. In the various spheres of applied psy- 
chology it is therefore especially ethics for which this law is 
of great importance. 
4. The law of development towards opposites is an applica- 
tion of the law of intensification through contrast, to more 
comprehensive interconnections which form in themselves series 
of developments. These series, in accordance with the fun- 
damental law of contrasts, are of such a character that feel- 
ings and impulses which were of small intensity at first, in- 
crease gradually in intensity through contrast with feelings of 
opposite quality that were for a time predominant, until, finally, 
they gain the ascendency over the formerly predominant fecl- 
ings and are themselves for a longer or shorter time in control. 
From this point the same alternation may be once or even 
several times repeated. But generally the principles of men- 
tal growth and heterogony of ends operate in the case 
of such an oscillation, so that succeeding phases are like  
-P-A-G-E-346
  328 TV. Psychical Causality and its Laws. 
corresponding antecedent phases in their general affective 
direction, but still essentially different in their special com- 
ponents. 
The law of development towards opposites shows itself in 
the mental development of the individual, partly in a purely 
individual way within shorter periods of time, and partly in 
certain universal regularities in the relation of various periods 
of life. It has long been recognized that the predominating 
temperaments of different periods of life present certain con- 
trasts. Thus, the light, sanguine excitability of childhood, which 
is seldom more than superficial, is followed by the slower 
but more retentive temperament of youth with its frequent 
touch of melancholy. Then comes manhood with its mature 
character, generally quick and active in decision and execution, 
and last of all, old age with its leaning toward contemplative 
quiet. Even more than in the individual does this principle 
of antithesis find expression in the alternation of mental 
tendencies that appear in the social and historical life of 
communities, and in the reactions of these tendencies on 
civilization and customs and on social and political develop- 
ment. In the same way that the principle of heterogony 
of ends applied chiefly to the domain of moral life, this 
principle of development towards opposites finds its chief 
significance in the more general sphere of historical life.

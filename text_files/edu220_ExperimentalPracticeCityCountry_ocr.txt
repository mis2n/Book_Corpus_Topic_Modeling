PREFACE 
In a quiet street of old New York stands The 
City and Country School, founded ten years ago 
by Caroline Pratt and known during the early 
years of its history as ‘‘The Play School.’’ It 
has been one of the first among educational 
pioneers frankly to avow itself experimental, and 
to attempt a revision of school practice ‘‘from the 
ground up”’ by discarding, at the beginning of its 
work, all the traditional preconceptions that gov- 
ern the standard practice of our schools today. 
In the course of its development provisions in 
regard to program, curriculum, and method have 
been adopted only as they have appeared to be 
justified by the school’s own experience, and the 
situations arising ' within its classrooms. 
To_ stud: ities of the 
growing child as they are manifested, to suppl 
an environment that, step by step, p, shall meet the 
needs of his development, stimulate his acti 
‘and orient him in his e us enlarging world, and that 
‘shall at the same time afford him effective experi-

have built up the experimental practice that she 
discusses in the following pages, and that is 
pictured in detail by the various school records, 
one of which, Miss Lula Wright’s record of her 
seven-year-old class, presents the objective mate- 
rial of this initial study. 
These school records, written by the classroom 
teachers from copious daily notes, are organized 
according to a plan that has been adopted after 
much painstaking study and co-operative effort on 
the part of the school staff. They are in them- 
selves experimental. Their publication invites 
criticism and suggestions in matters of form as 
well as of content. Indeed, as Miss Pratt has 
stated, the purpose of the school in publishing its 
records is to secure discussion of them, and of the 
school procedure pictured by them. 
To those readers to whom the story of The City 
and Country School is as yet unknown, the follow- 
ing details will be of interest. Miss Pratt began 
her experiment in 1913 with a small group of 
children of pre-school age gathered from various 
homes in the neighborhood. During the early 
years of its development the experiment was 
maintained through the generosity of a few 
private donors. In the beginning tuition was 
entirely free, but parents who were interested and 
able to do so, from time to time contributed to the 
school funds. Recently, at the request of the 
vi
-P-A-G-E-9
PREFACE 
parents, tuition fees were adopted, but at the same 
time it was agreed that a large percentage of 
scholarship pupils should at all times be enrolled. 
In this way the school’s original purpose, to serve 
children who would normally be found in the city’s 
public schools, has been preserved, at the same 
time that its growing reputation has attracted 
many parents whose children would otherwise 
have been sent to private schools. 
The name first given it, ‘‘The Play School,’’ 
reflects a special interest of the founder, her 
original inquiry into the educational possibilities 
of children’s play and its place in school pro- 
cedure. As the experiment progressed, however, 
and older classes began to be included, the children 
protested vigorously against this name, and it 
was changed to ‘‘The City and Country School’’ 
at a period when a school vacation farm was 
maintained as part of the experiment. Though 
somewhat incongruous today when its application 
is limited to the city plant, this second name has 
become so identified with the experiment as to 
make the wisdom of any further change seem 
questionable. 
In addition to its primary purpose, the develop- 
ment of an experimental practice, The City and 
Country School has for some years co-operated 
with the Bureau of Educational Experiments, 
affording the research staff of that organization 
vii

opportunities for observations and measurements 
of normal children who are developing in an 
environment particularly favorable to health and 
to spontaneity. Results of these studies are pub- 
lished from time to time by the Bureau of Educa- 
tional Experiments, and there has been no attempt 
to include them in the following pages. The 
school and its staff have at all times remained 
responsible for their own experiment, and the 
scope of the present volume is limited to their 
specific problems of experimental practice.

Experimental Practice in the 
City and Country School 
THE ARGUMENT 
Our school is now ten years old. It started 
with one small group of neighborhood children of 
four and five years of age. Hach year we added 
a new group of ‘‘fours,’’ together with a teacher. 
None paid tuition. ~In fact, there was so little 
confidence in us that it was difficult to get the 
children’on any terms. When the parents found 
that we did not teach the children to read and 
write at six, we constantly lost individuals. For 
two years we dropped the children at seven, in 
order to study our situation and provide a better 
program. By this time we had succeeded in 
establishing the fact that we were doing some- 
thing with the younger children which was recog- 
nizable and valuable, and gradually parents began 
to have confidence that we could do the same thing 
further along the road towards High School. 
There has been little giving way on what we 
consider important principles of our experiment. 
We have established ourselves finally through 
parents who were already interested in a new 
type of education for their children. Such parents 
are moving into our neighborhood each year in 
order to send their children to our school.

2 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
We now have a class of twelve-year-olds 
(seventh grade) some of whom will be ready for 
High School by the end of another year. They are 
an interesting group, but those who have been with 
us longest have suffered from having been always 
the oldest class in school. Their confidence has 
been more or less impaired because they have had 
nothing to look forward to. However, we are quite 
sure this is a peculiar condition and will not hold 
in future groups. We now have a nine-year-old 
group (fourth grade) made up of children all of 
whom have had pre-seven-year-old experience in 
the school. With this class comes our first real op- 
portunity to show the results of our price 9 
treatment. 
The very fact of publishing our procedure 
would seem to tend to crystallize it. But to those 
of us within the school, the procedure is not erys- 
tallized. It is a loose framework made primarily 
to conserve individual freedom. Imitative teach- 
ers may try to do what we have done. They, per- 
haps, will use the experience afforded by our 
special neighborhood, which may or may not be 
appropriate to theirs. But it is hoped that our 
procedure will also fall into the hands of imagina- 
tive teachers to whom it will give courage to re- 
gard the fundamental principles of education, and 
to work out a new and perhaps better technique,
-P-A-G-E-17
  
THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 3 
and certainly one related to their own environ- 
ment. 
The experiences basic to our procedure in the 
earlier years and out of which our programs for 
the older children have been developed, are those 
provided by adaptable materials and the play op- 
portunities that such materials afford. That is 
to say, whatever little children have half experi- 
enced in their small wanderings and happenings, 
they can more fully experience through work with 
blocks and kindred materials. Play, or as the 
children call it “‘work,”’ with these materials is an organizing experience. At three or four, chil- 
dren come to block building, for example, after a 
good deal of experiencing with their bodies. They 
themselves have been everything—cows, animals 
of all kinds, engines—everything that moves. 
They have been the whole thing without much 
particularizing. Now they become interested in 
the details. What part of the engine makes the 
whistle? what makes the movement? who pulls 
the throttle? Children are not interested in these 
as facts, but as facts to be used in play; or it 
would be more correct to say that what the in- 
formation does to the play is to keep it going and 
help it to organize as a whole, to raise new in- 
quiries, and above all to offer opportunities for 
 
-P-A-G-E-18
  4 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
new relationships. After all, many things whistle; 
many things move on wheels. Here are new appli- 
cations, new discoveries, new combinations, a con- 
stant reorganization. This is what block building 
means to us. It makes no difference that the 
things the children play with have no representa- 
tive value to begin with. We have watched the 
building going on for so long that we know this 
will come in good time. We are satisfied to have 
the things explained to us. We are deeply moved 
when a small boy calls our attention to a piece of 
wood that might be anything and says, ‘‘This is 
my boat,’’ and then whispers, ‘‘Come and put 
your ear down close beside it and hear the waves.’’ 
But representation is on its way as well. There 
are times when we wish the world in general might 
be admitted to the lay-outs of the children at six. 
They have made engines and cars by this time 
which are pretty correct in detail; they lay out 
their tracks and streets in accordance with the 
points of the compass; they build representative 
city buildings with enough of the outstanding 
characteristics so that they are recognizable; they 
distinguish between and imitate the sounds of dif- 
ferent types of street noises, whistles, escaping 
steam, crunching wheels; they make different 
types of people to take part in the activities. 
These constitute the overt behavior signs. The 
whole performance is not unlike that of many of
-P-A-G-E-19
  THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 5 
our adult men and women who are recognized as 
people of note. Heads of railroad systems, theat- 
rical managers, orchestral conductors manipulate 
the particular material they deal with to help 
them clear up their thinking and show new re- 
lationships. What this overt behavior shows to 
the teacher is what is going on in the organism: 
the changes that are taking place, the growing 
power, or perhaps a stepping back. It shows a 
new direction or no direction at all. 
The teacher is wedded to a job which is not 
teaching at all when she uses such adaptable ma- 
terials as blocks; or, shall I say, that all her teach- 
ing, or whatever she does with the children, fol- 
lows the discoveries she makes? Children who do 
not make use of adaptable materials, who do 
not convert materials to their own uses, obviously 
have no u no uses to put them to. “Not to have a play 
use for materials at three, | four, five, six years of 
age indicates a need for careful analysis and 
concentrated effort on the part of the teacher. 
Sometimes we find a child has been habituated to 
follow the lead of an older child, or has been too 
dominated by the adults about him to feel free to 
attack materials. 
The unfortunate child is the one who has his 
interest riveted in people, because he cannot man- 
age them, cannot convert them to his purposes. 
They dominate him and he is converted to their  
-P-A-G-E-20
  6 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
purposes. The youngster has to work his life out 
on something. He is full of motor activity and 
without materials he becomes a struggling little 
being working with what he cannot understand, 
much less manage. It is this sort of confused life 
which becomes turned in on itself. I am not ex- 
aggerating when I say that we have had such 
children come to us at three years old; more at 
four; still more at five and so on up through the 
group ages. Our own children have less of this 
sort of struggle because we recognize the neces- 
sity for them to have materials which they can 
work with, which they can dominate, and feel their 
power over. The human element is in companions 
of their own age with whom they are on a footing 
and with whom they can cope. The teacher re- 
mains in the background and sees that each of the 
children has an opportunity and that the situa- 
tions are fairly simple and capable of adjustment 
to their understanding. Children sometimes have 
“‘fanciful’’ ideas such as imaginary companions. 
I have never observed these children closely, but 
I am inclined to think that the play would not go 
on for any length of time if the children had not 
experienced reality in its related form and been 
able to build their play upon it. Such children 
seem to be keen observers of those realities which 
they can turn to account in their play. They make 
incomplete or half-understood situations complete 
when they play with them.  
-P-A-G-E-21
  THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 7 
Often a child lacks all experience with the re- 
lated activities of the adult world upon which his 
play is bound to be built. Some types of children 
experience the activities going on, but only as 
isolated experiences. The treatment of each of 
these cases, which are typical and which every 
teacher is bound to meet, is different. A child 
habituated to follow another child is shifted about 
so that the conditions will throw him on his own 
and he is stimulated constantly to take hold of 
materials. We take the problem into the home 
and try to get co-operation to break up the de- 
pendence which we trace there. The child lack- 
ing experience with adult-related experiences has 
the adult material world thrown open to him on 
the street, on the ferries, in the street cars, the 
elevated, and subways, and he is made conscious 
of the interdependence of these. Sometimes chil- 
dren attack nothing at all, and when this occurs 
we have the means of finding out whether it is due 
to physical causes. Extreme fatigue is sometimes 
traced to constant lack of sufficient sleep. If this 
cannot be met at home, we give the child a chance 
to sleep at school. 
We make every effort to get all the children to 
play with these adaptable materials. If the chil- 
dren come to us young enough, they work on floor 
schemes without much urging. The best work is 
done by the boys although there are good girl 
block builders as well. We should like to find out
-P-A-G-E-22
  8 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
why girls are not so ready to organize on a broad 
basis as boys. Sometime we may be informed 
that it is because of the biological difference in 
the sexes, but in the meantime we are working 
upon the supposition that it is social. Whatever 
her future is to be, we can see no reason why it 
is not as valuable for a girl as for a boy to use 
materials which lead out into ever wider experi- 
ences instead of remaining centered in less active 
interests. In our own experience we find that we 
treat girls differently from boys. We cannot help 
ourselves. If we do it, we who are trying above 
all else not to make a distinction while the chil- 
dren are so young, how much more is the distinc- 
tion made in casual contacts? Society cannot get 
used to ‘‘boyish’’ reactions in our girls, even very 
little ones. Excusable roughness in boys still re- 
mains questionable in girls. They are pigeon- 
holed by the most tolerant of us, and by others 
they are victimized by deep-rooted habits of 
thought. Nevertheless, while we encourage both 
boys and girls with suitable materials to carry 
out domestic experiences, we also encourage girls 
as well as boys to follow any lead out into the big- 
ger world. There are many references to this 
difference between boys and girls in our school 
records. 
We pin a large amount of faith to block build- 
ing for the younger children. The reason for this
-P-A-G-E-23
  THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 9 
is that blocks are the most adaptable materials for 
their use that we can find. I am again and again 
surprised, as are many of our experienced teach- 
ers, by the questioning of the value of block build- 
ing, and I am just as often reminded that it is only 
the initiate who see and appreciate children as 
growing individuals. The ordinary visitor takes 
the products of the children on their face value— 
looking for an approach to the adult’s conception 
of the thing produced. We, on the contrary, 
should be alarmed if we saw such an approach. 
We should conclude that the children had been 
trained along one line to an abnormal degree and 
we should expect to find that this had been done 
at the expense of their general growth. We go 
back of the block building to get at the value of it 
to the individual children. 
I am at the same time aware that the school 
floor often looks like an unholy mess. However, I 
remind myself that any adult performance has 
such periods if we were permitted to see it in the 
process of becoming something. Rehearsals are 
never open to the public as our schoolrooms are 
and I venture to say the public would hardly be 
on hand to see the finished play if they were. 
Often this happens to us. Visitors catch us in a 
mess and never return. On the other hand, we 
have an object other than securing a general pub- 
lic appreciation of our work. We wish our par-
-P-A-G-E-24
  10 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
ticular public to see and understand education in 
its movement. 
Another aspect of block building is its quicken- 
ing effect on other activities and particularly on 
shop work. A suggestive bench and tools and 
lumber are in every room, even that of the three- 
year-olds. Some purposeful bench work begins at 
four and all the children make something for their 
play schemes at five. These products are very 
crude, but have features, always, which at least 
suggest the object. At six the bench work takes 
on more detail and is better formed, and at seven 
the children have quite definite ideas and can pro- 
duce what they want. At eight we begin to teach 
them a method of work if they have not evolved 
one themselves. Wrong ways of handling tools 
are supposed to have been corrected by this time. 
The rooms are all furnished with clay up to 
seven, when the children go to the modeling room 
for help in their work. Up to this time they have 
been making objects incidental to their other class 
room activities such as block building. Now they 
learn the technique of modeling so that the best 
of their products may be fired. We are inclined 
to challenge any system of graduated models to 
produce better products at eight, nine, and ten 
than does our system in our shop and modeling. 
In addition to blocks, our yard materials are 
adaptable to children’s play purposes. The school
-P-A-G-E-25
  THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 11 
records show what sort of play the children carry 
out with these big materials. Because they use 
themselves to impersonate, we are inclined to look 
upon this play as the beginning of dramatics, as 
such, if there is any distinction to be made be- 
tween types of play. The eight-year-old children 
and those older have only occasional access to 
these materials. Other opportunities for spon- 
taneous play with materials are supposed to oc- 
eur in connection with their program. We have 
been led through our experience to assume that 
the children at eight and thereafter will play with 
the new information they are acquiring. When 
occasionally the yard materials are thrown open 
to them, or a room with blocks, they play out 
their new information quite spontaneously. But 
the materials they care most for in group work 
are clothes and stage settings. They launch them- 
selves in dramatics proper. In order to play to- 
gether and produce an organized something, they 
find it necessary to know what they are going to 
do before they begin, and, after a trial and error 
method, they are apt to decide to get something 
down on paper. In getting used to a new tech- 
nique such as this, the children are often self- 
conscious. It is surprising that they should be so 
when they have been quite the contrary in their 
former play with big materials, no matter who 
was observing. Soon, however, they become ab- 
 
-P-A-G-E-26
12 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
sorbed in it and forget themselves. It is at this 
point that we get some interesting productions. 
‘What we speak of as adaptable materials can 
best be understood by throwing them into con- 
trast with materials which are not adaptable. Or 
to express it in a different way, materials which 
may be used to promote the purposes of the teach- 
ers as set over against those which are intended 
to promote the purposes of the children. 
Children are easily led to think they are car- 
rying out their own purposes through organized 
sets of materials, when in fact they are carrying 
out the set purposes of the teacher and in her 
mind serving the future instead of carrying out 
their own purposes and serving ihe present. 
Sloyd is one example of this, and Montessori in 
her didactic material, another. Sloyd originated 
in Sweden. When I went to the fountainhead at 
Naas to take the summer course twenty years ago, 
my training had been, frankly, through sets of 
graded models of joints with no application what- 
ever. I had been supposed to get all the opera- 
tions which a cabinet maker would use, but never 
had made anything that could be used. At Naas 
I was supposed to get the latest thing through a 
series of ‘‘useful’’ models with similar graduated 
steps. The emphasis was upon the graduated
-P-A-G-E-27
  
THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 13 
steps, not upon the use of the model. The fact 
was that none of the models were useful to me. 
It had never occurred to these educators that the 
need of the individual had anything to do with 
usefulness. ‘‘Manual Training’’ had come into 
existence as an educational factor under a cloud. 
To meet the requirements of ‘‘education’’ it had 
to be graded: for education meant training to 
these people; they had not caught up with the 
modern idea. How far they had come through, 
however, was well illustrated when we placed 
Sloyd in contrast to what was going on in the 
Denmark public schools which we visited on our 
way home. There we found whole classes sawing 
in unison while the teacher counted. Shop work 
here was just one more instrument with which to 
bore children to death. For the children in all 
this work, only the narrowest thought process was 
operative. Every bit of work was planned by the 
teacher. There was no chance for the potential 
ingenuity, initiative, imagination with which the 
use of these materials is fraught. The essence 
of industry has always been left out of manual 
training courses, for who shall deny that the es- 
sence of industry is to produce? 
Madam Montessori’s didactic material is pur- 
poseful only from the adult point of view. Her 
exercises are based on the analysis of ‘‘mind’’ into 
‘‘the senses’’—which are best trained while the 
 
-P-A-G-E-28
  14 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
children are little—into ‘‘perception’’ and finally 
into ‘‘reason,’’ the training of which comes after 
the senses and perception are trained. Modern 
psychology has long since thrown down any such 
analysis of ‘‘mind.’? Whatever mind is, it acts 
as a whole and the singling out of any part of it 
for training irrespective of what is happening to 
the other parts, endangers the whole. The fact is, 
it cannot be done. Abstract reasoning, it is true, 
develops later than the full use of the senses, 
but reasoning has its beginning with very young 
children. To bring the contrast still closer, the 
Montessori didactic material contains a series of 
blocks which make a stair. When the stair is 
finished, the teacher’s purpose is fulfilled. But I 
have seen children try to make use of the stair by 
placing the construction against a wall and trying 
to step up. They could not use it adequately and 
their purpose was cut off. If they could have 
made such use of the stair, the teacher would have 
stopped them because Madam Montessori consid- 
ers this a desecration of the material. The use of 
it must stop with the sense-training part. It is 
not intended that the children should reason at 
this time, or should carry things to a conclusion. 
The use of adaptable materials such as blocks, 
drawing materials, bench work, et cetera, is con- 
sistent with modern psychology which recognizes 
that the child mechanism works as a whole.
-P-A-G-E-29
THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 15 
It is farthest from our plan to see either our 
programs crystallized or to have the conduct of 
the children become a matter of form. Our atti- 
tude towards conduct is quite the same as that 
towards other parts of the procedure. The chil- 
dren secure their own freedom by securing that 
of their confreres. To get the children to recog- 
nize this principle and to develop the discipline 
and judgment necessary to put it into practice is 
the goal towards which we work. The freedom of 
each individual is so bound up with that of the 
group, that it is impossible to secure freedom for 
one except by securing it for all. 
But young children are not equal to arranging 
their own situations to secure individual freedom. 
While teachers and children discuss the situations 
together as they arise, not much responsibility for 
general conduct is thrown on children below nine, 
and we are careful not to have the minds of the 
Nines and Tens too concerned with conduct. The 
solution of all conduct problems lies,in well-estab- 
lished work and play habits. A child without 
these is like a physical infection. He spreads aim- 
less activity to all those except the immune. It 
is at least half as hard again to catch the interest 
of such a child at the age of six as it is at three, 
and until his interest is caught his conduct is a 
constant concern. He takes up more of the teach- 
er’s time than all the rest of the children put to-
-P-A-G-E-30
16 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
gether. The other children should not have the 
responsibility of deciding what should be done 
with such a child, nor yet the privilege of draw- 
ing comparisons. Their quick reactions to his in- 
terruptions are sufficient. Beyond this the re- 
sponsibility for him lies with the teacher. 
I speak of this here, because we have been ques- 
tioned as to why our groups are not more self- 
governing. Many will understand me perhaps, if 
I say that we want the quick, red-blood reactions 
to encroachments upon the things that are vital 
to the children, rather than the cool, calculating, 
deliberative type of pooled judgment of undevel- 
oped minds. We are trying the experiment of 
seeing how far responses of children who have 
come through the searing process of relationships 
can be depended upon. Should not judgment, or 
response to an inner ordering of responses, be 
trained upon something less changeable than hu- 
man material, and upon human material slowly 
and carefully? Too much interest in conduct is 
apt to breed the kind of reform which looks upon 
present behavior with little concern for what has 
gone before; for what has produced it. Our ex- 
perience is that youth is particularly not to be 
trusted to pass judgment upon others. 
It is important that experiences should relate 
to each other, as well as that subject matter should 
be related. Not only should the program of each
-P-A-G-E-31
     THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 17 
class admit of a unified experience, but the pro- 
grams should follow in related order. How to 
secure related and organized experiences for the 
children, as well as the opportunity for a wide and 
useful experience at each age level is a difficult 
problem, because at best the set-up of a school is 
artificial. While the children are still satisfied 
with play, we can supply such opportunities for 
experiences. We find that at eight, or thereabouts, 
they want quite a different type of experience. 
This seems to be supplied in the eight-year pro- 
gram by their ‘‘work’’ of conducting a school 
store. At the same time spontaneous play inter- 
ests shift to something more nearly resembling 
dramatics than anything they have expressed 
earlier. 
The check upon our planning is the children’s 
reaction. Too ardent planning often results in 
chaos, when a fresh start must be made. The 
breakdown of a program is a very vital experience 
to the adults. <A close analysis of our programs 
shows that, while there is something in common 
going on, there are also as many things in par- 
ticular as there are children. To conserve the in- 
dividual opportunity requires as careful planning 
as does the general outline of the program. 
In working out a program, the teacher has the 
following to refer to: records of former teachers 
of these children; records of former teachers of     
  
-P-A-G-E-32

children in successive age groups, whether of 
these particular children or others. Besides this, 
there is much unrecorded information which she 
ean call upon. Depending upon the type of per- 
son making the program, these available records 
are used much or little. It is my opinion that none 
of us have become habituated to the use of this 
material to the extent we may in the future, and 
that we still stumble along learning by our own 
experience. 
The teacher submits her tentative program for 
my approval in the spring previous to the school 
year in which it is to operate. It is then, together 
with all the others, submitted to the body of teach- 
ers in a series of meetings which take place after 
school closes, when our whole attention is given 
to the coming year. 
For several reasons the seven-year-old program 
assumes a different form from the earlier ones. 
First, seven is the year which we have fixed to 
begin work with the very difficult techniques of 
reading, writing, and arithmetic. As we are do- 
ing this, frankly, in response to group and in- 
dividual needs arising both within and without 
school, we try to teach them by the most effective 
methods of class, supplemented by individual, in- 
struction. We feel pretty certain that the ques-
-P-A-G-E-33
  
THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 19 
tion of whether the children are ready for such 
difficult techniques or not, is answered by 
whether they can take them as a group. It is too 
expensive as to time and effort, both of the chil- 
dren and of the teachers, to teach these techniques 
by any individual methods. Besides, we are look- 
ing forward to and preparing for mass instruc- 
tion, assuming the mass to be composed of 
individuals able to discriminate between what is 
suited to their needs and what is not. 
Without discussing here why we begin these 
techniques at this time, the fact that we do makes 
necessary a more organized program than the 
children have heretofore experienced. They are 
still clinging to the strong spontaneous play ele- 
ment in their six-year-old program, and getting a 
taste at the same time of the more consciously or- 
ganized programs which they will experience in 
future. 
Also, the children are changing in their inter- 
ests. They begin to be more interested in realities, 
in whether they are doing things ‘‘right.’? They 
narrow and define their interests and begin to be 
objective in their pursuits. Their drive is be- 
coming a more conscious one. With this more 
conscious pursuit of what they desire comes a 
realization that they cannot accomplish what they 
want to without help. Their standards grow 
faster than their capacity to realize them, and
-P-A-G-E-34
  20 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
they begin to appreciate the necessity for teach- 
ing. In a sense, the seven-year-old program pre- 
sented in the following pages has come out of the 
experiences of a particular group of children; in 
another sense it has come out of the organization 
of the whole school. These particular children 
had previously had certain experiences in com- 
mon. Our three-year-old, four-year-old, and 
five-year-old records show in a general way what 
these experiences had been. In some of them the 
histories of individual children can be traced. (I 
might say in passing that our goal for records of 
the future is one in which all the individual his- 
tories can be traced, though the record will still 
remain a group record.) A great many problems, 
therefore, particularly those of adjustment to each 
other, had been settled before the children had en- 
tered the seventh year. At seven they had formed 
habits of helping themselves to materials without 
wasting them; of settling many of their disagree- 
ments without fighting; they could play many 
games and observe the rules; they could work to- 
gether as a group with little friction and a great 
degree of individual freedom. They had certain 
standards of behavior to which a newer child in 
the group had to conform. They were able to do 
this year’s work because of what had gone before. 
The program suggested was not different so far 
as information was concerned, but the experience
-P-A-G-E-35
  THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 21 
of building a city was carried out in permanent 
materials rather than in blocks, as had been done 
when the children were younger. They reorgan- 
ized their experiences and information, and ex- 
tended both on a city built of board, metals, et 
cetera, rather than of such impermanent materials 
as blocks. The children as a group had the in- 
formation and experience for building a city; the 
teacher helped them to organize and extend it. I 
doubt if such a program could have been carried 
out so successfully without a similar background 
of experience. 
In the earlier programs, our teachers keep in 
mind future programs, and there is always a con- 
scious preparation for what is to come. Our use 
of adaptable materials leads to the play and work 
activities of older groups; and the general in- 
formation gained at this time becomes a part of 
a later and fuller body. The reason these chil- 
dren were well prepared for the seven-year-old 
program was, that it was based on their earlier 
experiences and on subject matter already famil- 
iar to them. We recognize in all our programs a 
basis for new ones. Some of this subject-matter 
we name specifically geography, history, number 
and reading, language. The teachers keep these 
specific things constantly in mind and see that, 
before they are picked out as ‘‘subjects,’? the 
children have a basis for the particular kind of
-P-A-G-E-36
  22 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
subject. We expect every child to qualify in 
them. For example, we do not expect any child to 
come through seven without a number sense. 
Each individual has had experience in using num- 
ber practically. We deliberately keep them from 
written number until we are sure they will not 
become confused; and that they may know that 
number has a use, a relationship. Every class in 
school above six has its own class treasury, from 
which they pay for trips and buy all their school 
supplies. The children below six are reminded by 
their teacher of the number of blocks they carry 
in each hand and learn the combinations up to 
ten. No effort is made to teach them to count, 
because it is a simpler, more direct process to 
recognize a small group of objects than to both 
count and combine. To a little child four is as 
much a unit as one, and two is as much a part of 
four as one is. This is a typical example of a 
logical teaching method as set against a logical 
subject matter method. In setting the table for 
mid-morning luncheon, the children estimate the 
number of children and the number of crackers 
and cups of milk needed. Such problems are con- 
sciously made use of by all the teachers. Although 
the children differ in ability to handle number 
problems, it is safe to say that no child who has 
been in the school below the period under discus- 
sion is confused by number problems, and many
-P-A-G-E-37
THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 23 
of the children are far above the average in what 
we used to call ‘‘mental arithmetic.’’ 
No one can doubt our success in geography. We 
divide our work into technique and information. 
On the technique side we try to orient the chil- 
dren in their environment. We begin this at three 
and four. The little children learn to go about the 
school building and to know where they are in 
relation to their base of operations—their room. 
The fives extend out into the street and know the 
streets in relation to the school. They learn the 
names of the streets and the location of their 
homes in relation to the school. They extend their 
building with blocks to reality so far as direction 
is concerned. The sixes begin map-making and 
trace their trips on maps. Often we, as teachers, 
say to each other, ‘‘Do you remember how you 
hated to draw maps?’’ and point to a group of 
children tracing routes on paper and decorating 
and vivifying their productions with color and line 
drawings. We do not wonder they like it, and we 
know that the secret lies in the fact that they 
have been introduced to these experiences gradu- 
ally, and always on a level with their ability. 
We have such acknowledgment from parents as: 
“*Mary and I went to Brooklyn the other day and 
I failed utterly in finding my way. I couldn’t be- 
lieve that Mary knew the direction for she had 
had less experience with Brooklyn streets than I, 
 
-P-A-G-E-38
  24. EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
but finally I gave up after much disputing and 
Mary, aged seven, took us to our destination.’’ 
Or, ‘‘Marsden, this summer, was able always to 
bring me back to our hotel while we were explor- 
ing foreign cities.’’ 
This early orientation we consider basic in any 
future study of geography and history as such. 
Indeed, we wonder if it is not pretty essential in 
any clear thinking. It can be done gradually along 
with growth in other directions until, to know 
where one is in space, in relation to other matter 
becomes an inner habit of mind and body. It is 
acquired with increasing difficulty later. 
The basis for the informational side of geogra- 
phy as well as history begins wherever the chil- 
dren begin to experience the relationships of men 
to earth, and men to men. In making their small 
inquiries about what they see and come in con- 
tact with in their environment, they are studying 
geography and history. They experience history 
and geography in their own relationships, in such 
inquiries as: Where do bricks, plaster, wood, 
metals come from? Particularly in this informa- 
tional side of geography are they getting re- 
lationships, cause and effect. Having this re- 
lated information in their background, ‘‘book’’ 
geography, when they reach it, becomes a different 
matter. To children who have had such experi- 
ences, learning the capitals of the States has a
-P-A-G-E-39
  THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 25 
significance which it could never have to other 
children. They could not rest upon the fact that 
Albany is the capital of New York State. The 
reason why would mean to them an interesting 
piece of research. 
We consider all inquiries into ‘‘How’’—into 
mechanical processes—pre-science, and we defi- 
nitely encourage them and make place for them. 
In fact, science remains inquiry into processes, 
however it may develop later. 
The significance of such work as I have de- 
scribed as basic-history and basic-geography, et 
cetera, is very great: 
First—The children have acquired a great store 
of useful information as well as a definite tech- 
nique long before such work is usually expected 
of children. With such a beginning we expect our 
children to be launched in real historical and 
geographical research before they enter High 
School. We expect no child to enter High School 
with a mathematical complex. We expect that 
while some children may not have strong science 
interests, and others may not have strong art in- 
terests, all will know, at least, that a relation 
exists between science and art. 
Seconp—We have a right to expect our 
children, having had geography for instance, in 
relation to other material, to retain a sense of re- 
lationships when they begin its study as an infor-

mational subject, to know that the dividing line 
between ‘‘subjects’’ is fine and always arbitrary. 
I think we may even expect them to ‘‘specialize’’ 
without becoming specialized themselves. 
Turrp—Children will not have a chance to dis- 
card a thing before they have had anything to do 
  with it. They have oor ‘“seography’’ un- 
consciously before they hav:

This serves the child who has formed the habit of

an outstanding boy of nine who entered the school 
 
-P-A-G-E-41
THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 27 
at six with a full equipment for reading informa- 
tional material as well as a large body of informa- 
tion. He saw no attraction in activity of any sort. 
Life to him was an opportunity to read. After 
two months of aloofness to the active part of our 
program, he began to build with blocks and there- 
by to organize his information through play. He 
is now nine years of age, an outstanding child in 
activities so far as originality is concerned, but 
still without the vigor he should have at this age. 
Nothing, however, should be interpreted to mean 
that we do not expect the children to carry their 
search for new informational material beyond the 
confines of what they can put to use. The round- 
ing up of information always will be a pursuit in 
itself once it gets started in an individual. This 
is as it should be, for two purposes are being 
served. The children are preparing for new ex- 
periences, acquiring a body of general information 
while at the same time they are forming the habit 
of getting information for a purpose. 
Learning to read has been put off deliberately 
until the children are seven. We are not sure that 
this is the place for it. It is a complicated and 
difficult technique which may be found to belong 
later on in our school work. That we can success- 
fully teach it at seven proves nothing. It is often 
taught at four. What helps to guide us in our 
decisions regarding any new technique to be added
-P-A-G-E-42
  28 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
to programs is the use which can be made of it. 
In considering the teaching of reading, for ex- 
ample, we have to face the question of its use. 
Suppose children of seven to be able to read flu- 
ently, as many are. What have we in literature 
to expose them to? They can and do in short order 
exhaust the supply of what we consider good for 
them. We have started something which we can- 
not control, and unwarrantable adult problems 
are opened up to children, with nothing in their 
experience to help them to understand them. If 
the problems escape their notice, the evil is 
equally great, for they form habits of reading 
without understanding. Teaching children to read 
solves only adult present problems, but it multi- 
plies problems for the future for very many chil- 
dren. It is unsafe to launch them in a technique 
which tends to take them from first-hand experi- 
ences and center their interest in vicarious experi- 
ences. The habit of reading fairy-tales to get 
excitement is vicious. This is in no way to be 
interpreted as discounting the value of fairy-tales 
where the use of them is controlled. We are glad 
that our children are still struggling with the 
technical difficulties of reading at seven; that we 
ean still select what literature they shall be ex- 
posed to. This is the negative side of the question 
of program. The positive side is, that spending 
little time in reading and writing leaves the time
-P-A-G-E-43
  THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 29 
of the children of six and seven free for first-hand 
experiences. 
What most of us want for children is a strong 
healthy basis in motor life and first-hand experi- 
ences to build upon. 
Under our present organization of school pro- 
grams, the whole set-up of which is as temporary 
and experimental as may be, it is true that the 
future programs demand a certain amount of 
reading and writing in order to carry forward the 
experiences. The children know what these ex- 
periences are to be and recognize that preparation 
for them is necessary. They also put to use cur- 
rently what they are securing. 
‘We have not worked out the foundations of 
reading and writing so definitely as we have num- 
ber and geography; but our emphasis on the chil- 
dren’s ability to express themselves orally is 
partly because we believe oral expression is a good 
general preparation for a more technical interest 
in language. Expressing motor and sense impres- 
sions in language, as well as being able to rehearse 
personal experiences, is as good preparation for 
what books contain as one could wish. What we 
need on the technical side to lead up to reading, as 
drawing leads to writing, is more concentration on 
enunciation. This we shall work upon very defi- 
nitely in the next few years and shall try to record 
our results,
-P-A-G-E-44
  30 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
So far as a common and general body of infor- 
mation has developed in our curriculum or school 
procedure, it has had its beginning in our par- 
ticular neighborhood. One persistent interest 
which holds throughout the first six or seven 
years is in boats. Why are boats so prominent 
in our play schemes? we are often asked. We 
live near the river and not far from the harbor, 
so boats are in the experience of our children. 
Ferry-boats seem to be in the experience of all the 
children and steamships in that of many. From 
these experiences the children push inquiries to 
other types of boats and, by constantly using this 
information in their play schemes, it becomes a 
vital part of another type of experience. If chil- 
dren start with boats, they not only spread their 
inquiries further about boats, but also they make 
inquiries about kindred things, such as trucks, 
which they find unloading at steamship docks, and 
railroads from which the trucks bring the freight 
or to which they take it. What follows from these 
environmental beginnings is quite logical. This 
serves as an example of our treatment of infor- 
mation. Other illustrations are given in our rec- 
ords. 
Boats are a good basic interest for a study of 
history and geography. The inquiry is often 
made, why we do not follow the children’s leads 
into the past or into the distant present, in these
-P-A-G-E-45
  
THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 31 
early years. We do this at times depending upon 
the circumstances. I recall Miss Stott’s six-year- 
old record: in which she des¢ribes several visits 
made by the children to a Cuban steamer. It hap- 
pened that the children made unusual connections 
with this steamship company. To an extent, they 
*‘experienced’’ Cuba. They came in contact with 
Cuban people and with materials being taken to 
Cuba and those being brought from there. The 
men who manned the steamship became their very 
good friends in the course of several visits, and 
they helped the children to get a Cuban, as well 
as a steamship, experience. So far as these chil- 
dren related what they learned about Cuba to 
what they had learned through experience in their 
own surroundings, it changed and extended their 
reactions and became experience. Had these chil- 
dren had only a body of isolated facts to work 
from, even though they had experienced them, 
they would have had nothing with which to under- 
stand the part of Cuban life they came in contact 
with. 
Facts, isolated, have no meaning in life. They 
begin to mean something only when they begin 
relating themselves to each other. To a child who 
has experienced living with others in domestic re- 
lations, a Cuban person might mean a person with 
1 Stott, Leila V., Record of Group VI, Bulletin of the City and Coun! School, New York, 1921. . ey id 
 
-P-A-G-E-46
    32 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
domestic relations. Or if his experiences have 
been vivid in industrial relations, a new individual 
might mean a person who worked in some form 
of industry. His queries will take the line of his 
own related experiences, and will become tied to 
them and a part of his experience. 
I might cite other instances in which the chil- 
dren have followed leads into the past and into the 
distant present. There might be a difference of 
opinion between the class teacher and the rest of 
us, as to the value of the leads which the children 
follow, but the general policy of the school is to 
keep the children in the present, until we know 
them to have a solid base of related facts to work 
out from, and to which to bring what they get. 
We are not willing to be dominated or have the 
children dominated by subject-matter. We want 
them to form strong habits of first-hand research 
and to use what they find; we want them to dis- 
cover relationships in concrete matter, so that 
they will know they exist when they deal with 
abstract forms, and will have habits of putting 
them to use; we want them to have a full motor 
experience because they themselves are motor; 
and to get and retain what they get, through their 
bodily perceptions. Subject-matter of the past 
and the distant present contains fewer opportuni- 
ties for these than does the environment of the 
children.
-P-A-G-E-47
   THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 33 
So, the body of information our children have 
up through seven years of age is largely relative 
to their own lives in New York City. They have 
had some experiences which make them cognizant 
of a past and a distant present as will be seen in 
our teachers’ notes; but our effort is to have them 
get as much as possible of the here and now. 
No one will deny that the information noted in 
the records of these younger years is history and 
geography information. With this they go to an 
eight-year-old program where their experiences 
lead them back as well as beyond. I do not know 
whether they will know the capitals of the States, 
and perhaps they will not know the States com- 
posing the Union, but I am willing to say that I 
should many times over rather leave that to 
chance than such things as our dependence on the 
iron industry, or the coal industry, or the inter- 
relations and dependence of any part of trade and 
industry to all other parts. These are facts which 
young children can deal with if related to their 
experiences, and that need not be put off until 
High School age. Indeed, they are strengthened 
by such facts constantly built upon and added to, 
and thereby better prepared for High School 
work. On the other hand, the emphasis placed 
upon the tool side of geography and history in the 
formal school defeats its own purpose. When we 
are possessed of names and locations, we still have
-P-A-G-E-48
    34 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
not begun the study of either of these subjects. 
Many children never get beyond and most of them 
drop what they obtain of these tools as soon as 
the school need is passed. And then what of the 
essence of these subjects? 
The subject-matter of a curriculum is what is 
presented to the children, but knowledge is quite 
a different matter. The latter is what the children 
get of this subject-matter—what becomes a part 
of them. There is no such thing as knowledge 
unrelated to experience. One can be informed 
about other people’s experiences, but unless one 
has something of one’s own to relate this to, and 
test it by, it is not knowledge and has little value 
to the individual. In building a body of what the 
schools call ‘‘general information’’ unrelated to 
the children’s experiences, they build of straw. 
The facts may be related, but of what value are 
they if the child does not know their relation, if 
he has not tested them through the fire of his ex- 
perience? 
I do not wish to leave the discussion of general 
information without claiming for our children a 
very large body of it. They are full of inquiry 
and interest in everything about them. They are 
at an early age aware that behind every fact lies 
another one equally interesting. A child is bored 
by the movies, for example, until the performa 
is over, when she disappears and is found in f    
  
-P-A-G-E-49
  
THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 35 
dark of the stage behind the curtain trying to find 
out where the performers are. Another at four 
wants to know why, when you look through a small 
hole, you can see a big building? And yet another 
observes that he knows by the light in a com- 
panion’s eye that the latter will ‘‘do something to 
him when he gets him away from the teachers.’’ 
With such habits of observation and inquiry es- 
tablished, books become of just as great signifi- 
cance to them as their need requires. This 
method lies dormant in all individuals. Why do 
we so persistently stifle it and divert it? Surely 
we prize it! 
If our records do not show how thoroughly we 
try to make art opportunities for the children, it 
is not because the opportunities are not there. 
The rooms are a better record of them perhaps. 
By those who are not interested in art, our em- 
bryonic art in songs, pictures, language, and 
plastic forms is often tolerated because ‘‘it 
makes little difference what one does with young 
children’’; or it is irritating to them because 
“children should be doing things of more impor- 
tance.’’ But there are many who are glad to see 
art treated as an important part of a general edu- 
eation and placed side by side with science, who 
join with us in revolt against the domination of  
-P-A-G-E-50
  36 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
the formal schools by the Puritanism which has 
excluded the cultivating of esthetics. 
We are at variance in our method with some of 
those who are sympathetic in revolt, for we do 
not ‘‘let the children alone’? so completely as 
others believe in doing. We see the spirit of art 
as the spirit of play, as well as a thing in itself, 
and we give play great opportunity as a prepara- 
tion for art; we see the factual element of art in 
the first-hand experiences and observation of the 
children, and make unlimited opportunities for 
them to experience and observe; we see art and 
imagination as irreducible, and we see technique 
as the result of hard work with materials. Atten- 
tion to these fundamentals while the children are 
still very young may or may not breed artists. 
But it will at least keep the minds open and per- 
haps contribute to the greatest art of all—the art 
of living. 
Play by most educational people is thought of 
as something to go through with and get out of 
one’s system. They are apt to tolerate it in the 
very young and pray for deliverance from its ef- 
fect at an early period; or they use it as a period 
for getting over good habits of what later will be 
called work. The latter turns out fairly well for 
the children as long as they are children. The 
query is raised, however, Is there nothing intrinsic 
in play worthy to be preserved to the race? If 
   
-P-A-G-E-51
  THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 37 
there is, what should be our attitude towards it? 
Should it be one of converting play habits into 
work ones and making little provision for it fur- 
ther? Surely, there is something in the spirit of 
play worth carrying into our every-day life; the 
ability to get over our ideas in playful form, the 
use of language, paints or pencils, building mate- 
rials, the voice or musical instruments, in the 
same spirit in which we use tennis racquets, balls 
and bats—play, or the spirit which makes art 
possible. 
I remember how one of our parents who had 
listened to a public school music lesson charac- 
terized it as contrasted to the spirit of music. She 
said the spirit of it was expressed in the words, 
‘Sing, damn you, sing!’’ I doubt if this is an 
exaggeration though there are exceptions. Music 
must move along through the play spirit. A six- 
year-old child just becoming conscious of himself 
ean hardly be introduced to music without increas- 
ing his self-consciousness. If he cannot recognize 
music time as play time—a play time with a new 
kind of plaything—he should be let alone until he 
ean. 
Our school cannot quite face having music left 
out of children’s lives; so, in order to get children 
to understand it as a play opportunity, we both 
encourage music elements in their other play, and 
show them how to play with the elements irre-

spective of other types of play. Just so far as we 
have succeeded in getting the little children to 
play with rhythm, with tone and pitch through 
such toys as voice and body and simple musical 
instruments, just so far have we succeeded with 
music; the technique is then quite a simple matter. 
Our experimentation with drawing has led us to 
believe that children manage their own technique 
in this much better if they are let alone. The 
test is whether they continue their interest and 
whether they progress by our let-alone method. 
We believe they do, but we have had no systematic 
study made of our drawings from the standpoint 
of artistic merit. We try to get the children to 
play with language and plastic art elements in 
much this same way. 
The first-hand experiences of the children such 
as are provided for in the school procedure, con- 
tain the factual elements necessary to art. Vivid 
auditory and perceptive images come from vivid 
experiences. The children who reconstruct their 
environment in blocks, who observe most keenly 
on trips, who know their facts, possess an element 
essential to art production. The kind of fact may 
determine the kind of art, or the kind of instru- 
ment which has first caught a child’s attention 
may determine the kind of fact which he will see 
or hear. Facts of form and color and a set of 
crayons work together as play material; songs,
-P-A-G-E-53
  THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 39 
and street, ocean and country sound facts, to- 
gether with the voice and musical instruments 
combine for play with music; facts of architecture 
as well as those of steamships and railroads make 
a good combination with blocks. 
Imagination seems to me to be no more or less 
in its commoner form than experiencing and an- 
ticipating relationships; and in its rarer form 
bringing together new or fundamental unities. 
The person who is making a cabinet goes ahead 
from one step to the next. He sees the operations 
in their relation. So, too, children in block build- 
ing and other forms of play are imaging when 
they see what comes next in construction; when 
they see the next step in its relation to the pre- 
ceding ones. 
The three- and four-year-olds place their blocks 
in meaningful relations. Sometimes they are in- 
formation relations and sometimes they come out 
as pure design. We have frequent expressions of 
rhythm where children sit on the floor and place 
one block on one side and balance it by one on 
the other and produce structures which contain 
many blocks with never a deviation from the 
rhythm. At five the children begin to plan their 
immediate futures and to carry them out as 
groups and as individuals. 
Many can scarcely believe these opportunities 
to be important in the development of imagina- 
 
-P-A-G-E-54
40 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
tion, because they are so common and in most 
eases seem to lead nowhere. Every ditch digger 
is cultivating his imagination seemingly. But 
what constitutes opportunity for children does not 
mean opportunity for an adult. The ditch dig- 
ger’s opportunity passed him by somewhere in his 
childhood, when this kind of imagination (the 
imagination referred to as the type common to all 
of us) was interrupted and died out for lack of 
opportunity, or was wet blanketed by a course of 
dictation. This is where imagination went wrong. 
Imagination gets its greatest opportunity in 
play, including play with ideas; thought runs 
ahead and back again and establishes relations. 
Provided it deals with reality, this kind of im- 
agination is basic in the development of the rarer 
kind. The little boy, referred to elsewhere, who 
asked his teacher to listen to the waves against the 
side of his boat, gave the characteristic of boat in 
relationship and showed evidences of the rare 
type of imagination. Boat and water; there is 
nothing more fundamental in boat. The model 
ship which stood during the War in Union Square 
was not so much of a boat as John’s flat piece of 
wood; unless perchance, someone leaned up 
against it and heard the lapping of the waves! 
This would be relating one reality to another. 
I was once in the position of wanting some toys 
drawn. I asked all my artist friends for a person
-P-A-G-E-55
     THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 41 
who could draw animals. I said to one of them 
in my ignorance, ‘‘ You know I’m not so particular 
about form because they are to be cut from wood 
and should be erude, but what I want is the char- 
acteristic of the animal. Each has something 
about it which makes it more a cat than anything 
else, or more a cow. It’s that characteristic which 
I want brought out!’’ My friend looked at me 
with a mixture of amusement and surprise in her 
face and finally asked me if I really did not know 
that I was asking for the rarest ability in the 
world; that seeing fundamental qualities in form 
and color and bringing them out in their relation- 
ships was art in its highest form. 
Imagination is potential in all of us. It is not 
a quality of mind which is peculiar to some. Like 
everything else it feeds upon opportunity. Im* 
agination cannot be taught; it cannot live in a dic- 
tated atmosphere. What quality of mind does 
dictation serve that makes it so important that it 
dominates our educational institutions? To be 
sure, it shortcuts the subject matter processes 
which are the aim of the institutions. And I hear 
some one say, ‘You don’t think children should 
discount what the race has learned and go through 
all the experiences our ancestors did, do you?’’ 
No, I don’t. Furthermore, I do not think this 
question has anything to do with whether or not 
children should have opportunity to establish 
 
-P-A-G-E-56
  42 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
themselves in their environmental conditions, and 
make the most of them for the benefit of their own 
development. There are other ways than by dic- 
tation, to give children the benefit of race develop- 
ment. 
Imagining is a mode of discovery. A person 
stands upon related facts and plays with the 
fringe of possible further related facts and rejects 
or brings these new ones into relation. Whether 
this be applied to materials, or whether it operate 
in abstract reasoning, it is imagination which 
plays the fundamental part in adding the new 
facts to the old. This ability we recognize as 
superseding the mere knowledge of the past in 
importance. (Indeed, of what value is a knowledge 
of the past without imagination to see its meaning 
in relation to the present?) To get imagination 
operating to its fullest extent in individuals is one 
of the great problems of education. I think our 
records show new and greater possibilities along 
this line than most other school procedure does. 
As I study the records, they present themselves 
to me as a flow of activities from which spring 
more or less important imaginative happenings. 
Sometimes the rare type comes out at five as in 
the case instanced. Sometimes it comes out later 
and occasionally earlier. But these occurrences 
are not so important, both because they may be 
accidents, and because an extremely pronounced
-P-A-G-E-57
  THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 43 
quality, if it is not accidental, is likely to find its 
own expression even under adverse circumstances. 
But the point of importance is whether such op- 
portunity as we are offering is an imagining 
opportunity; whether the children stand a chance 
of coming through with the rarer type of imagina- 
tion. 
The developing process is a step by step, or if 
one like it better in discussing imagination, a leap 
by leap, from where the child is found to be. The 
beginnings of imagining are when the child 
through experiencing becomes conscious of a train 
of relationship from one thing to others;she next 
becomes conscious of a train of relationships lead- 
ing out from himself. There is the possibility that 
these conscious relationships may lead up a blind 
alley. /If the child has been fortunate enough to 
get started on something which he can convert to 
his purposes, his future is assured. Children 
while they are still young can convert only mate- 
rials to their purposes. There is nothing more 
prominent in our records than the way the chil- 
dren seize upon imagination opportunities. 
I am tempted to answer here the accusation 
whieh has frequently been made against us—that 
we center the children in the present and thereby 
cut off their chances to develop imagination—by 
challenging the definition which excludes the pos- 
sibilities for imagining in the here and now. The
-P-A-G-E-58
  44 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
existence of an Hinstein controverts this suffi- 
ciently for most of us. It leaves us still with the 
poetic type of imagination unaccounted for. But 
here as well, the quality of poetry is dependent 
upon the vividness of impressions which have 
been made upon the instrument. Is not a poet a 
highly sensitized individual upon whom the facts 
of life make deep impressions? These impres- 
sions are analyzed and their parts brought to- 
gether to make new forms. He differs from a 
great scientist in the kind of fact he has by chance 
become interested in, as well as in the material 
he expresses himself through. 
It is not my purpose, however, to discuss art 
except as it may be indicated in embryonic art of 
children. The other element in embryonic art as 
I, arbitrarily, have analyzed it, is technique. 
School people disagree radically in their treat- 
ment of technique. I have shown in another place 
how often it is isolated from its legitimate subject- 
matter and analyzed according to the degree of 
difficulty and built into a system. The assump- 
tion, in the application of a system of training in 
technique to young children, is that all but one 
part of the moving organism can be shut off and a 
drive forced along that one path. There is plenty 
of proof in the overt movements of the children 
of our formal schools, that this can be done. They 
move almost in the lock-step of the army to one 
 
-P-A-G-E-59
  THER CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 45 
motive. What happens to the whole while the one 
part is being forced is, however, a recent and 
insistent question. The modern school offers 
opportunity in technique along with other oppor- 
tunities, and doubts the validity of the isolated, 
sequential, easy-to-difficult method. It has set up 
the hypothesis that the gaining of technique is 
compatible with the acquisition of subject matter; 
that the desire to gain both of these is compatible 
with the acquisition of each; and that all of these 
are parts of one whole and may be treated as such. 
There is little doubt that certain periods of de- 
velopment suffer more intrinsically from what we 
term a training method than others. Very young 
children, let us say up to six, seven, and eight, dur- 
ing which years a change in interests takes place, 
cannot stand up under it. They lose the play 
spirit and become more or less automatons. Dur- 
ing the transition period of six, seven, and eight, 
less harm is done by the training method to those 
children who are secure in their play spirit. After 
the transition they are apt, not only to submit to 
training, but to put themselves through their own 
courses of training when they have technical dif- 
ficulties. The key to the problem of when specific 
training may be suggested, lies in whether or not 
the individual child or student can see its purpose, 
and can hold to what he sees. But waiting for this 
time does not mean that the gaining of techniques
-P-A-G-E-60
    46 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
is being put off. Children with strong motor 
drives, with keen desires, with information, 
brought together with suitable materials, are get- 
ting degrees of technique in many directions; 
besides this, they are gaining a force and purpose 
which will send them far along in gaining specific 
techniques, when they see the necessity for them. 
The most outstanding proof of this is the way in 
which children learn to walk. 
It is easy to see the children doing pretty much 
as they please and at the same time being pur- 
poseful, when they are using the materials of our 
classrooms. It is not difficult to understand that 
the children are not dominated by us in their use 
of the plastic materials (including drawing mate- 
rials) and that they are at the same time gain- 
ing mm technique. Our method in music, however, 
seems to most people to be a teaching system. I 
am not sure whether it is or not, but I am inter- 
ested in explaining it so far as I see it as con- 
sistent with our other procedure. 
The voice in singing as well as in speaking is a 
human instrument capable of a high degree of 
cultivation. The speaking voice operates early 
because of its use quality. But the singing voice 
is left largely to chance. There is little motivation 
behind the singing voice except in rare instances. 
To singing, also, there is attached a self-conscious- 
ness which checks its use, especially, I think, in 
America. The voice, as used to sing simple songs, 
 
-P-A-G-E-61
  
THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 47 
is comparable, as a tool in music, to the voice in 
the use of sentences and words in language. But 
songs have to be taught the children. They must 
sense or experience rhythm and pitch and what- 
ever goes to make up music, before they can com- 
pose in the way they compose with language and 
materials of plastic art and wood tools. Because 
of the belatedness of the children in securing their 
musical elements, the composing also is belated. 
If it is allowable to call composition in the ele- 
ments of music such as rhythm and pitch, ‘‘com- 
position,’’ individual children are producing such 
eomposition all of the time. They move to 
rhythm of their own making and imitate sounds. 
However I see little composition in music which is 
comparable to composition in pictures, which are 
produced without instruction of any sort what- 
ever. 
There are other music tools besides the voice— 
many musical instruments. We use these for the 
children’s experimentation. That much of this 
has to be done in groups seems to be forcing the 
children into group performance. However, there 
is so little of this in any other direction in the 
school, and the play spirit is so dominant in our 
music lessons, that we have little apprehension for 
the results. Furthermore, we are seeing ways of 
extending opportunities for individual experimen- 
tation with the instruments. 
For the musician, the plastic artist, interested  
-P-A-G-E-62
  48 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
in making professional artists, I admit we have 
not touched the subject of art. Neither do we 
make cabinet makers nor engineers of any de- 
scription. What we want to do is to pave the way 
for the development of different types‘ of art; to 
help, not to hinder the embryonic artist. We wish 
to provide opportunity for the children to keep up 
to their age level in techniques of different types, 
and to preserve the warmth of desire towards ac- 
complishment, so that when the time comes to 
develop special techniques the strength to put 
them through will be there. 
Our treatment of these so-called ‘‘subjects’’ is 
our answer to the argument that schools which 
have been termed ‘‘free’’ have no organization, 
and that children are exposed to haphazard 
methods. The difference between our organiza- 
tion and others is, that we have not made a paper 
curriculum first and then held ourselves to it. 
What organization we have has followed experi- 
ence. We have found that orientation can be 
begun at three, that at four the children can begin 
to understand direction and can orient themselves 
in certain spaces, at five they can extend that ori- 
entation, and at six they can begin to extend that 
orientation beyond their motor experiences. Our 
organization of these specific findings has been to
-P-A-G-E-63
  THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 49 
see that the new teachers are aware of what may 
be expected of their special age group, and to bend 
their efforts towards having each child come 
through with the degree of orientation he is equal 
to. It is in this way that we are building our or- 
ganization. We have made but a beginning and 
our efforts are largely confined to curriculum, but 
we begin to see the possibility of just such organ- 
ized effort for the study of individual children as 
well. 
With a forward look towards future programs 
and a backward look as well, we are likely some- 
time to come through with a curriculum as a whole 
for children from three to twelve or thirteen. The 
word curriculum should not be interpreted to 
mean a rigid program. Far from this, we are 
merely adding a degree of formulation to what, in 
our experience, we find to be true of children at 
different ages or degrees of development, in or- 
der, primarily that we may make further discov- 
eries. We have made but a beginning and any 
formulation we make is open to discussion and 
future repudiation. We are publishing our pro- 
grams for one distinct reason—to get discussion 
of our procedure, based upon what is actually 
happening. 
How to secure the possibility for creative op- 
portunity for teachers and children is the funda- 
mental question with such a school as ours, and
-P-A-G-E-64
  50 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
the above description of our procedure together 
with our records, reflects I hope, the existence of 
such possibilities for both teachers and children. 
I recognize that the first question that arises is, 
‘What is a creative opportunity?’’ And there 
are aS many answers as there are people who 
would undertake to answer it at all. Records alone 
eannot answer the question. However, I do be- 
lieve that our records, taken together with the 
observation of the children and teachers of our 
school, explain what we, at least, mean by it. 
Leaving the question of creative opportunity for 
teachers, for the present, no one can observe the 
children working their way through the experi- 
ences described, without realizing that they are 
departing from the dictative, the imitative, and 
striking out into new and interesting trails of 
their own. Besides this, they are beginning to 
become adult in their ability to concentrate, to 
initiate, to beautify their surroundings, to adjust 
their relationships. The results can be seen by a 
keen observer of realities. The records should 
serve as a key to those who are observing, not as a 
proof of results. ' 
And as I say this, I remember Miss Wright has 
included some achievement tests in her record to 
prove the results of her teaching of reading. To 
me these tests prove Miss Wright’s ability to 
train these youngsters in the specific things they
-P-A-G-E-65
  THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 51 
will have to know in carrying out a future pro- 
gram. But they have little to do with the educa- 
tion of the children. Again we have Dr. Dewey 
to thank when he answered the ever recurrent 
question, ‘‘But, do not the children have to be 
trained?’’ ‘‘Yes,’’ he admitted, ‘‘but training has 
nothing to do with education.’? A person is 
trained by another, but he educates himself. If 
we could once get that idea into the consciousness 
of our parenthood and our teacherhood, the revo- 
lution in our school procedure would be immediate. 
We throw the monkey-wrench into the mechanics 
of our own conception of ourselves—of the human 
race—when we continue to treat our own progeny 
in the way we treat the animal life which we con- 
sider inferior to us. Our hope for the future of 
our race lies in the children’s ability not merely to 
equal us, but to surpass us. It is our individual 
egotism that keeps us from seeing the logical out- 
come of training children to follow in our own 
footsteps. A long-range view of this sees the 
human race up a blind alley. We are unconsci- 
ously relying on accident to escape from the re- 
sults of our training methods. 
In the experience of most of us there is no class 
that has achieved creative satisfaction to the 
degree that artists have. They, more than any 
of us, have demonstrated that they conceive the 
means of living as not worth working for unless 
 
-P-A-G-E-66
  52 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
they get satisfaction from their work. They have 
lived like rats in garrets in order that they might 
obtain satisfaction in working. They are no more 
articulate in explaining what it is they are after 
than are the rest of us, but they have succeeded in 
turning attention to themselves as operating, as a 
class, on a different principle from the rest of the 
world and have at least aroused the curiosity of 
the world about themselves. Many of them seem 
to achieve satisfaction in their work. 
We are told that but for the need of food, shel- 
ter, and clothing, the human race would die out 
for lack of motivating. I wonder if it would. I 
wonder if the need for shelter, clothing and food 
motivates us as much as we think it does. It 
seems as if life, having come into being, will not 
face death. That life is sufficient unto itself. It 
needs no other motivation than living until death 
overtakes it. Biologically, the desire to obtain the 
means to live has developed along with life itself 
in its different forms. It is an accident that we 
have developed commercially so far as we have— 
that the mass of human beings have only food, 
clothing, and shelter opportunities; that anything 
else which goes to constitute life in the fuller 
sense is enjoyed vicariously. We have not con- 
sciously taken hold of our affairs and organized 
our efforts towards securing the satisfaction we 
are all trying to get; we have not begun to place 
 
-P-A-G-E-67
THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 53 
how to live on a footing with securing the means 
to live. Those who are working most strenuously 
for the means to live will admit that they want to 
get to a place where they can feel secure so that 
they may ‘‘enjoy life.’’ Enjoying life means to 
them enjoying other people’s productions in all 
forms of art, games, out-of-door life, travel. It 
means vicarious living. They have produced ona 
low level. It has given them no satisfaction. 
They have little conception of living through pro- 
ducing stages which lead to an enjoyment in their 
own productions in poetry, the plastic arts, in 
material creations, games. They have little con- 
ception of creative experience. 
In our school programs, having displaced the 
training idea along with the “‘big stick,’’ we still 
have not found it necessary to promise rewards in 
order to motivate the children. In fact, we are 
pretty sure that if the children are sent to us early 
enough, we can establish the habit of being moti- 
vated from within; of having purposes and being 
able to stick to them, to work through them. 
Sometime, if we remain long enough in existence, 
our whole school with its records will furnish the 
data for proof that such habits can be established 
for every individual child. It is already proved to 
those of us who have had experience with the 
youngest children, though we have no convincing 
records of it. To work upon tests of individual 
   
-P-A-G-E-68
    54 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE 
capacity seems to us beside the point until we have 
established a principle of motivation. Many 
teachers are sure this can be done. This principle 
of motivation is, to me, what the new education 
stands or falls by. It stands us in good stead that 
the children seem to have entered the world with 
a certain physical set-up which demands oppor- 
tunity for play and work—and that they accept 
the opportunity. Our opponents characterize the 
opportunity as one ‘‘to do as one pleases,’’ but 
we think it is opportunity to produce; to produce 
not because one merely remembers, not because 
one is told to, but because all one’s faculties are 
primed for work. What one produces under such 
circumstances is to a degree creative; to what 
degree is a matter of opinion, but I am sure that 
its essential characteristic is a motivation from 
within.

ORGANIZATION OF THE RECORD 
Tue group records of the City and Country 
School are an attempt to reproduce an experi- 
mental curriculum as it develops from month to 
month in a given year, under the conditions of the 
school environment. Children and teacher to- 
gether create the material for the record; the 
writing of it is the work of the teacher. Rough 
notes, taken in the classroom, are written up after 
school hours, then summarized and typed at the 
end of weekly or monthly periods. 
The summarizing is done under general head- 
ings that reflect the school’s plan for curriculum 
organization. The first of these, Play Experi- 
ences, and the second, Practical Experiences, are 
basic in the program. Under them are recorded 
the functioning of the children, whether as a 
group or as individuals. The play experiences are 
expansive, allowing opportunities for children’s 
reorganization of their own environment, while 
the practical experiences are organized for the 
production of things. Under the third heading, 
Special Training, are included the experiences 
directed toward certain ends and the acquisition 
of special techniques. The fourth heading, Or- 
57 
 
-P-A-G-E-72
  58 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE 
gamzation of Information, includes also the 
reaching out for new informational material. 
By means of these headings the teacher is as- 
sisted in checking up the class experiences, and 
the reader is enabled more easily to follow the 
intentional program. The subheads make it pos- 
sible to select from the general record those para- 
graphs yielding information as to development 
and experiences along more narrowly specific 
lines. Thus the month-to-month sections headed 
Language, Cooking, Reading, if considered sep- 
arately and consecutively, will be found to present 
each a connected story fairly complete in itself.

The Play City 
Tue children were told the first day of school 
that the River Yard was theirs and that they 
could build a city in it if they wished. This pro- 
posal was greeted with enthusiasm. A lively dis- 
cussion followed of the different kinds of 
buildings a city needs. Various buildings of New 
York City were mentioned. I said, ‘‘Shall we 
build New York City?’’ All of the children an- 
swered, ‘‘Yes.’’ ‘‘Then what shall we call the 
river in the yard?’’ ‘‘That can be the Hudson 
River.’’ ‘‘And what shall we call the land on the 
other side of the river?’’ ‘‘That is New Jersey.’’ 
Then Roger said, ‘‘I’ll make a schoolhouse.’’ 
Sarah chose a butcher shop, Dorothy a hotel, 
Grace a theater, Helen a little house out in the 
country, Jenny a post-office, and Mary a library. 
Gordon said, ‘‘ Well, I’ll make a farm outside the 
city.’ They began to talk about the things they 
hoped the children who were not there would de- 
cide to make because the City would need them 
too—stations, docks, apartment houses, stores, 
office buildings. Ruth said, ‘‘Why, the lawyers 
59 
   
-P-A-G-E-74
  60 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
would have to go out and sit in the streets if there 
were no office buildings.’’ 
Later the other group of Sevens’ was invited to 
help in building the City. They chose to make the 
terminal stations, the Woolworth Building, Cush- 
man’s Bakery, the Piggly Wiggly Grocery Store, 
a theater, and some apartment houses. Some of 
our own group, on entering late, chose mills, fac- 
tories, and garages to build. 
Play With Big Materials 
OUTDOORS 
Every one in the group climbs the six-foot lad- 
der and goes down the slide in all sorts of posi- 
tions with the greatest freedom and ease. Sitting, 
careless of which way they face, or lying down, 
head first or feet first, two or three coupled to- 
gether making a train, they slide down. Roger 
and Jenny jump down easily on to the pebbles 
below from the platform at the top of the slide. 
Most of the group swing by their knees from the 
horizontal ladder and the horizontal bars, and sev- 
eral can ‘‘skin the cat.’’? They do this also up in 
the gymnasium holding on to the rings. Some of 
them work very hard at the knotted swinging rope 
which is attached to a horizontal bar, about six 
feet high. To get hold of the rope they climb up 
a pole, then out on to the horizontal bar. Dorothy

was fearful at first, but practiced time after time 
and day after day of her own accord, asking me 
to stand close by at first. She worked until she 
did it very easily. Sarah worked in much the 
same way. 
A great deal of dramatic play goes on all of the 
time necessitating building with the packing boxes, 
yard blocks,’ and pieces of wood. Ernest Thomp- 
son Seton’s Biography of a Grizzly, which I have 
been reading aloud, has been the inspiration of 
much of the play. As Ruth and Julia would not 
enter into this, I suggested to Ruth, who was mak- 
ing a hardware store in the shop for the Play City, 
that she and Julia might play store with the yard 
blocks. They immediately set to work with them 
to make the hardware store. Then a family, with 
Helen as its mother, who had built a house near 
the hardware store, began buying supplies from 
the store, using pebbles for money. I was the only 
one interested in getting my exact change from 
Ruth, who gave it to me correctly. 
The bear dramatizations were becoming noisy 
and rather rough, so one day toward the end of 
the month, just before we went out to play, I said 
we would not play bears any more, but would play 
some of the things we were planning for the City 
Yard. This idea was approved and dramatiza-

tions continued day after day, of activities that 
were being discussed and planned for the Play 
City. 
Organized Games 
Occasionally we went into the large yard for 
running games. We played such simple ones as 
‘Red Rover,’’ ‘‘Three Deep,’’ ‘‘Birdies.’? The 
boys were more eager for these games than the 
girls, with the exception of Jenny and Grace, who 
are very good runners. 
Drawing and Painting 
As soon as the Biography of a Grizzly was 
started, Douglas, Walter, and Gordon began draw- 
ing pictures of grizzlies and hunters up in the 
mountains. Douglas and Walter display unusual 
skill in drawing animals. They, with Gordon and 
Roger, devote most of their free periods to draw- 
ing and painting. Boats, docks, and elevated 
roads are drawn continually by all of the boys 
and occasionally attempted by the girls. Jenny, 
Sarah and Ruth have a great fondness for the 
drawing of houses, trees, and gardens with flowers 
and birds and butterflies. They do not have very 
high standards of work. Helen, who is starting 
her first year in this school, works carefully on 
little set paintings of grape-vines and trees which 
she has been taught to make. When I asked for
-P-A-G-E-77
  THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 63 
some pictures of our trip to the Gansevoort 
Market, most of the children drew something they 
had seen there—the open markets, the chickens or 
beef hanging up, the freight cars or trucks, our 
class walking there. Julia and Ruth dictated 
little stories of the trip at home and illustrated 
them, and brought them to school. 
II. Practican ExpeRIENCES 
Shop 
As soon as a child had made a drawing of the 
building he had chosen to make for the City and 
had estimated with a yardstick the measurements 
for it, he was allowed to go over to the shop and 
start work. Several trips to near-by groceries 
were made before we had enough boxes for every 
one to begin building. 
Notes by Mr. Reber 
HABITS OF WORK IN SHOP 
Julia—works independently, but uses poor 
judgment. Pounds on sides of box without proper 
support, cracks wood, then has to start over again, 
so her work is going slowly. She always works 
cheerfully and alone, seldom asking for any help 
or counsel. 
Ruth—persevering and independent, rather low 
standards of work, content with uneven trimmings 
for windows, for instance, straightens them
-P-A-G-E-78
    64 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
only upon my insistence. She has very positive 
and clear ideas on what she wants to make for her 
hardware store, just where the shelves must be, 
and where the door and windows. 
Helen—her country house is admired by every- 
one for its wide front porch and pillars, its attrac- 
tive windows and swinging door. She works 
steadily and well, although she has a difficult time 
driving nails in straight. 
Grace—her theater with its stage, auditorium, 
and stairway shows skill and good workmanship. 
She has had help in planning and in making the 
stairway. She would have been content to stop 
with the stage, being anxious to get to the paint- 
ing of it, and she needed encouragement and sug- 
gestions before she was ready to continue. She 
rejected my suggestions of very simple ways of 
making chairs and tables, and followed her more 
complicated ones with no assistance. 
Francis—split the wood in his box and is start- 
ing again with another box. He has made a very 
nice arched doorway with the jig-saw. He is a 
capable worker, but easily distracted. 
Walter, Roger, and Douglas—after starting 
respectively a mill, a schoolhouse, and a factory, 
and working awhile at them had such good rea- 
sons for stopping temporarily—lack of material 
or need of finding out more about how such build- 
ings looked—that they were allowed to begin their
-P-A-G-E-79
  THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 65 
boats for the river, which they were anxious to do. 
Douglas finished a very good boat and came back 
to work on his factory with a will. He is doing a 
good piece of work; has made some round win- 
dows with a little help from me. Roger is 
working very intelligently on his ferry-boat, con- 
structing a derrick and paddle-wheel. He said he 
made paddle-wheels from one piece of wood in the 
country, after watching the boats, but he likes this 
one better which he has been shown how to make 
of two fitted pieces of wood. It operates with a 
rubber. Walter’s boat is going slowly. He is too 
much interested in the other schemes around him. 
Dorothy—works easily, has good ability and 
confidence, decides on window-boxes, or balconies 
with railings, and has little difficulty in executing 
her ideas. However, she is careless and could do 
better work. 
Sarah—works at her butcher shop independ- 
ently and carefully. 
Gordon—has a poor technique, partly due to 
lack of care and thought. 
Mary—is a conscientious, careful, independent 
worker. 
Jenny—works rapidly, but with no great care 
or thought. 
The following are some rules that grew out of 
 
-P-A-G-E-80
  66 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN, 
work in shop and which the Sevens agreed they 
were able to work by: 
1. Any.nail pounded in crooked must be pulled 
out immediately. 
2. In nailing one piece of wood on to another, 
nails must be started first in piece of wood 
to be nailed on, then the two pieces nailed 
together. 
3. Lines must be drawn with the use of tri- 
square. 
4, Any sawing must be preceded by drawing 
of line, indicating the place to be sawed. 
5. Object to be pounded must be well supported 
underneath in order to prevent the wood 
from splitting. 
Sewing 
The class had made cooking aprons the year 
before, so I had not planned on making aprons 
this year, but Helen had no cooking apron and 
wished to make one. Dorothy had hers left over 
from last year, but wanted a different kind. Mary 
had one at home, but chose to make a new one. 
Finally nearly every child was sewing away 
at an apron. After each had cut a pattern 
from a newspaper (one or two with help from 
me), I helped them lay it on a double fold of mus- 
lin and showed how to pin and cut it. Different 
colored yarns were chosen for the sewing of the 
hems and the straps. Gordon and Walter had so 
much difficulty getting theirs sewed, on account of  
-P-A-G-E-81
  
THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 67 
their yarn getting tangled and their stitches con- 
tinually running off the hem, that they grew 
weary of it and were very grateful to me for help- 
ing them out. Neither of them thought of giving 
up, however, for Miss Hannum had said no one 
could come to another cooking class without an 
apron. 
Cooking 
The preserving of food for winter in connection 
with our study of the City’s food supply has been 
the basis for this month’s work in cooking. It is 
a continuation of work started last year by the 
group. 
Cooking Notes by Miss Hannum 
I. CANNING PEACHES 
The group worked as a unit in preparing quart 
jars of peaches for the children’s lunch room. 
These will be used during the winter. 
In the discussion which preceded the canning, 
different children contributed the following 
points: 
1. 1 cup of sugar is needed for a quart of 
peaches. 
2. Boiling water poured on peaches loosens the 
skins so that they pare more easily. 
3. Jars must be sterilized (the reason why was 
also explained). Many of the class did not 
 
-P-A-G-E-82
  68 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
know that rubber rings were necessary, but 
after a child had poured water into one jar 
with a ring and into another without a ring, 
and had sealed and inverted both, the class 
readily concluded that rubber rings made 
jars airtight. 
4. It takes about fourteen or fifteen peaches to 
fill a quart jar. 
After paring the peaches the children cut them 
in halves, covered them with the sugar and added 
one-half cup of water. When the peaches had 
cooked until they began to soften, the halves were 
packed in the sterilized hot jars, boiling syrup was 
poured over, and the jars sealed. 
2. CANNING PEACHES—continued 
This was a review of the above lesson with this 
difference—that each child cooked some peaches 
by himself, furnished his own one-quarter-pint 
fruit jar, and took his finished product home. 
During the discussion in this lesson the children 
had in front of them a quart jar, pint jars, and 
one-half-pint jars. They were able to deduce from 
the fact demonstrated in the previous lesson, that 
one quart of peaches requires one cup of sugar, 
that a pint would take one-half as much, which 
would be one-half cup of sugar, and that one-half 
pint would take only one-half of one-half cup, 
which would be one-quarter cup.

II. Specit Traine 
Reading ' 
SIGNS AND LABELS 
The first day of school, the children found their 
tables, chairs, drinking cups, cupboards, and 
places for hats and coats, labeled with their 
printed names. Many of them recognized and 
could read their own and the names of other chil- 
dren, as these things had all been labeled in 
previous years at school. And, in addition, last 
year they had marked the attendance each morn- 
ing on a large card which contained the class 
names, the days of the week and the month. 
Some incidental reading came about from the 
interest in the names of streets and signs we saw 
on our trips. Every one grew to recognize 
‘“Ave.’’? and ‘‘St.’? and to use them in making 
drawings of trips. During ‘‘Safety Week’? when 
signs of ‘‘Don’t Get Hurt’’ were posted every- 
where about, I printed the sign and put it up in 
the schoolroom. These words were added also to 
the drills with words and phrases. 
A Superior Price and Sign Marker in the room 
came to be used almost constantly in free periods. 
Names, signs, and short stories were printed and 
taken home afterwards. Sometimes labels were 
put on drawings this way. 
The typewriter which we share with the other 
group of Sevens was also used, but by a smaller 
group of children.
-P-A-G-E-84
  70 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
THE CLASS NEWSPAPER 
The reading for the first month has been almost 
entirely from the class newspaper which was 
printed by the Tens and sold to us at 25 cents a 
paper. 
A Price and Sign Marker was used in printing 
it. We received one paper with a few short extras 
every week. This paper was thumb-tacked on a 
large bulletin board. The day and date were 
changed each morning, at first by me, but very 
soon by some child who came in early enough to 
do it. 
The first newspaper, as it had in it the names of 
the children who were in school the first week, and 
as it introduced day by day the names of the days 
of the week, contained some matter already partly 
familiar to the group. It was first read to the 
class by Helen and Sarah, who had learned to 
read in other schools. It was soon easily read 
by all the group, and most of the new words and 
phrases were recognized after we had had games, 
races, and drills with word ecards. Half an hour 
each day has been given to reading. There has 
been great interest in learning to read from the 
first, and as the reading has all been connected 
with the activities of the group, there has been 
eager discussion along with it. When the question, 
‘‘Where will the City people get food?’’ came to be 
read, Gordon burst out with, ‘‘Oh, that’s all right, 
my farm will send the food to the people.’? Sarah
-P-A-G-E-85
THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 71 
said, ‘‘I’ll buy his meat for my butcher shop and 
then sell it.’? Sometimes from the discussion that 
accompanied and followed one newspaper, I made 
up the news for the next. The news was, for the 
most part, about the building of the City in the 
yard. 
Some of the extras were: ‘‘We have cooking 
today,’’ ‘‘Mr. Meister comes today,’’ ‘‘Today we 
are going on a trip.’’

PICTURE BOOKS 
The books on the tables and shelves, such as 
Lear’s Nonsense Rhymes, Caldecott’s Mother 
Goose, Peter Rabbit, Little Black Sambo, Fairy 
Tale of a Fox, A Dog and a Magpie, Johnny 
Crow’s Garden, E. Boyd Smith’s The Railroad 
Book and The Farmer, were eagerly opened and 
enjoyed by all the children during a ‘‘quiet hour,’’ 
or in intervals of other work. Frequent requests 
of ‘‘Teach me to read,’’ were made by different 
children coming to me with books open. Small 
groups gathered as I read the requested story. 
When anything familiar, such as Mother Goose or 
a rhyme from Lear’s Nonsense Book was read, 
every one would join in with the reading. 
Language 
After the Gansevoort Market trip, I showed the 
children a loose-leaf album I had brought to 
school and said they could have it to file away,
-P-A-G-E-87
        THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 73 
stories of their trips or any other stories they 
wished to write. They were ready immediately to 
compose the story of our first trip to Gansevoort 
Market. One child after another contributed. 
The only attempt I made to help was to ask what 
the boat took back to Texas when it left the New 
York docks. Some of the children were much 
more ready than others, and Julia would have 
made no contribution at all if I had not given her 
an opportunity several times. After the Ganse- 
voort Market story had been typewritten in the 
office and added to our stories and verse, Helen 
and Sarah read it to the group of Seven B’s, who 
received it with great approval. Their account of 
the same trip was then read to us with equal 
appreciation from us. 
THE TRIP TO THE GANSEVOORT MARKET 
(Group Dictation) 
Once upon a time the Sevens went to the Ganse- 
voort Market. We saw chickens, and white rab- 
bits, and some little baby pigs. And we saw a 
turkey. Then we nearly all of us got weighed on 
the scales that they had to weigh the animals on. 
And we saw some squabs and some ducks in 
erates. They had some long tin dishes outside of 
the crates and they were eating out of them. 
**Quack, quack, cock-a-doodle-doo, ugh, ugh, ouk, 
ouk, wee wee, wee wee, peep, peep, peep, gobble, 
gobble.’” 
Then we went out on the docks. We saw a fire-  
-P-A-G-E-88
  74. EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
boat and some tugs. And then we saw trucks un- 
loading nails, tar paper, bags of concrete, barrels 
of sweet potatoes, boxes of tuna fish, boxes of 
pork. These were going up the river to Peekskill 
on a boat that came in at twelve o’clock. 
Then we went out on a big Southern Pacific dock 
and saw bales of cotton piled up. We saw bales of 
copper wire. We saw a big steamer coming in. 
The name of it was Le Valle. It had come up 
from Texas. It took five days to come. It had 
brought bags of chick peas and bales of estel grass 
to make rope and cheap brushes, and bundles of 
cowhides to make shoes, and bags of rice. The 
man said we would send back things that were 
already made, such as slate and cloth. 
One day Dorothy heard a small group who had 
come in early discussing swimming with me. She 
said, ‘‘Oh, I’m swimming on my back.’’ I said, 
“Do you want to write a story about it??? She 
wanted to, and reeled off the following account of 
it with only a question or two from me. Walter 
helped her with the last line when she hesitated. 
AT THE SWIMMING POND 
(Dictated by Dorothy) 
I’m swimming on my back in the water. I feel 
like I’m lying flat on my bed. Now I’m swimming 
onmy side. [loveit so! It’s so nice and cool and 
deep! I duck my head into the water and swim 
under the water. I paddle up to the rock like a
-P-A-G-E-89
THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 15 
little swimming fish. I walk up on the rock. I 
go up so high! Afterwards I get ready to dive. 
I go right head first down into the water and I 
swim back again. And I get up on the rock again 
and I dive down flat on my stomach. Oh! how it 
felt, like I was going to sink down to the bottom. 
Then £ swam out to the other side to the woods. 
I went through the fields across the state road, 
across the bridge up the path into our new little 
cottage. I felt like I had to have my lunch that 
minute. 
Writing 
The children needed to have their names on 
their shop specifications and boxes, and also on 
their drawings. All of them could print, and one 
or two could write his own name. Two or three 
days after school had started Dorothy asked me 
to write her name for her. I did so on a sheet of 
paper. She thumb-tacked it on the board without 
any suggestion from me and copied it carefully 
over and over again. Then I told the children who 
wished to know how to write their names to find 
places at the board and I would show each one 
how. Every one went to the board and I set a copy 
for each except Helen, Sarah and Walter, who 
were very insistent that they needed no help. 
Walter wrote his in perfect form but in a cramped 
way, and Helen and Sarah succeeded only after a 
fashion. As we continued writing at the board 
day after day these three came gradually to ac-
-P-A-G-E-90
  76 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
cept my criticisms and help. During the lesson 
there was swinging and writing to a marked 
rhythm, a verse or a song, or counting. Some- 
times, we called it making lace, sometimes winding 
the clock, sometimes skipping rope. Then from 
this care-free swinging of the arm for fun came 
the swinging into such easy patterns as it, me, 
ten, at. 
As the group had to order all of its own sup- 
plies from the store conducted by the Hights, the 
need soon developed for the writing of such words 
as pencils, paints, paper, crayons, chalk, scissors. 
These words were practiced on the board by 
everybody. Account must also be kept, in a spe- 
cial book, of all of the money spent. A bookkeeper 
was elected every week for this task. He was of 
necessity chosen from among the children who 
were writing with the greatest ease and regular- 
ity. All of the writing was done at the board, 
except when orders for supplies were written or 
when accounts were posted in the bookkeeper’s 
book. Any writing on paper was on a large scale. 
‘Number 
Every day there is counting of attendance, dif- 
ferent children choosing to count it by ones, twos, 
threes, fours, fives, and sixes. There are two 
periods during the week for number games such 
as ten pins, lotto, parcheesi, dominoes. Cards
-P-A-G-E-91
  
THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 17 
containing the more difficult combinations with 
their answers, as: 
3 4 6 
4 5 7 
7 9 13 
are thumb-tacked on the wall so that a child in 
getting his score need not stop to count if he does 
not know the combination, but may get the answer 
with a glance at the cards. These were not used 
much at first, but more and more the group is 
impatient if a child stops to count, and someone is 
quite apt to touch the card containing the com- 
bination and say, ‘‘Don’t you see, here it is.’’ 
Often when a child knocked over a certain number 
of ‘‘pins’’ which happened to be a very familiar 
part of one of the combinations of 10, as 5, for in- 
stance, and called out ‘‘5’’ to be added to his score, 
the rest of the group would call out, ‘‘and five 
left standing.’’? So I led them to allow each child 
knocking over blocks to call out not only how 
many were knocked over, but how many were left 
standing. I kept score the first two times we 
played and then Dorothy asked to do it. She 
turned 2’s and 3’s around and needed help. After 
she had kept score once, each child did it for him- 
self with my help. There are still many numbers 
that are made backwards. During one or two 
periods we worked on combinations to get more 
 
-P-A-G-E-92
    78 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
speed in our games. Small colored blocks were 
used. Sometimes the children worked together 
in couples. The one having the first turn, placed 
on the table two different piles of blocks, as 
2 reds and 3 blues, or 4 greens and 4 yel- 
lows. The blocks were won by the second child 
if he was able to say how many blocks were on the 
table without stopping to count them. It was then 
his turn to place blocks on the table for the first 
child to try to win. Short periods of this were 
enjoyed by the group. Hach child also worked by 
himself with blocks. He started with 5 blocks, 
putting them-together in all the combinations pos- 
sible, writing each combination on the board as 
soon as he had put it together with blocks, as: 
2 4 5 2 
3 1 0 1 
— — — 2 
5 
Combinations up through 10 were worked with in 
this way. 
The class is furnished money by the school office 
to pay for supplies and trips, so a treasurer is 
appointed for each week to count out the money 
for bills received and for the trips taken. This is 
done in the presence of the group, and often the 
treasurer receives help from the group. Most of 
the children are acquainted with the nickel, dime, 
 
-P-A-G-E-93

quarter, half dollar, and dollar, but are not quick 
in combining them. 
In cooking there is measuring by cupful, % 
cupful, 34 cupful, pint, % pint, tablespoon and 
teaspoon. 
IV. Oncanization oF INFoRMATION 
Discussions 
When we went out to nearby groceries to get 
boxes to start the buildings for the Play City, we 
talked of the materials used in building most of 
the houses we saw, and of their flat roofs, and 
their heights. Later we discussed the difference 
between city and country houses, and each person 
told of the kind of house he had lived in in the 
summer in the country. There were many varie- 
ties—log, wood, stone, brick, and even. canvas. 
Jenny told of the log house she had slept in and 
how she woke up one morning with the rain com- 
ing in on her face and saw a squirrel sitting up on 
a log in the ceiling. I showed some of the National 
Geographic pictures of houses that other people 
live in—grass houses in Africa like huge bird’s 
nests, houses in tree tops, bamboo houses, houses 
set up on posts as protection against snakes and 
animals, the pueblos of Arizona, Indian wigwams, 
the palm leaf houses of the Seminole Indians in 
Florida. Then we took a trip to the Museum of 
Natural History to see models of different kinds
-P-A-G-E-94
| 
80 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
of primitive shelter, the summer and winter homes 
of the Eskimos, Indian pueblos, bark wigwams, 
skin tepees, houses of the lake dwellers of Switzer- 
| land. There was immense interest in these dif- 
ferent houses and many conjectures as to why 
certain materials were used and why such and 
such a style of building. The methods of entrance 
to the various kinds of shelter brought out some 
interesting discussions. The ladder by which the 
small Indian lad was climbing up to the roof of 
his home, and the drawbridge to one of the lake 
dweller’s homes were remembered and talked 
over. 
There followed discussions of the first people 
| living here on Manhattan, their bark huts and 
lodges, their supply of sea food, wild animals, and 
simple garden vegetables, their rude tools and 
eanoes. I told the children how the part of New 
York known as Greenwich Village used to be 
called by the Indians, ‘‘Sappokanican,’’ meaning 
tobacco fields. We compared Manhattan as it 
must have looked then and later when the Dutch 
people came and established their farms, with the 
way it looks now. I told how some of our crooked 
streets were probably old cow-paths and that 
Broadway was once part of the old post road 
going to Albany. We compared the food supply 
of Manhattan of long ago with the present supply 
which comes from all over the world. We walked 
 
-P-A-G-E-95
  
THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 81 
over to the open-air market on Gansevoort 
Square, where we saw enormous quantities of 
fruits and vegetables, thousands of crates of live 
chickens, geese, ducks, squabs, tiny pigs, turkeys, 
whole beeves, hogs, et cetera. We saw freight 
ears and trucks bringing things from the docks. 
Then we went out on one of the Southern Pacific 
docks at the foot of Twelfth Street where there 
was much cargo which had been brought from 
Texas and New Orleans, sacks of rice, chick peas, 
raisins, hops, bales of cotton, bales of estel grass 
for making ropes and cheap brushes. We were 
provided with a guide who was able to answer all 
of the children’s questions. They asked him what 
the boats carried back to Texas and he said all 
kinds of manufactured goods, such as cloth and 
slating for roofs. We saw one of the large boats 
being unloaded and men going back and forth to 
the enormous holds with trucks. 
Grace brought Carpenter’s How the World is 
Fed from home and said she wanted me to read 
the interesting parts about poultry and about 
dairying. I read with many interruptions from 
different members of the group, who were anxious 
to share their summer experiences on farms with 
each other. Later, we joined with the other group 
of Sevens in a discussion of what we had seen on 
our trip to Gansevoort Market and showed them 
our pictures of the Market and the docks, and the
-P-A-G-E-96
  82 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
maps. Helen read them the group story of the 
trip and Sarah the rhymes. George, from the 
other group, told how he had seen cotton growing 
in Texas during the summer and showed some 
cotton bolls. The children as a group had intel- 
ligent interest and information in regard to where 
the fruit and vegetables which we saw at the 
Market came from—from the near-by farms on 
Long Island and in New Jersey, from California 
and from Florida, and in regard to the beef from 
ranches in the West. 
Along with the discussion of the food supply of 
primitive peoples and their methods of cooking 
and preserving, the group has been doing some 
preserving and canning of fruits for winter with 
Miss Hannum. (See Cooking.) We had planned 
also to spend a day at the Palisades, building a 
bonfire and cooking our dinner in primitive 
fashion. The children proposed toasting the 
bacon on sticks over the fire, and promised to 
bring small hatchets and knives to chop the wood. 
But on the day planned for the Palisades it 
rained, and although the small hatchets and knives 
were brought, and much disappointment ensued, 
the picnic could not take place. At my proposal, 
however, we pretended we were having the picnic. 
At the pretend picnic the children separated to get 
wood for the fire. Some brought back green wood 
and some dry. Ruth suggested saving the green
-P-A-G-E-97
  
THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 83 
wood to make toasting forks for the bacon, as that 
would not burn so readily. When it grew time to 
return home, a storm came up and we decided to 
spend the night there. Different kinds of shelter 
were decided upon. Francis dug a cave and put 
up a rock in front of it. Grass houses, clay houses, 
huts of bark, skin houses, shelter under bushes, a 
house of woven grass, a house up in a tree, were 
all proposed. A log house was at first decided 
upon by Sarah, but later she said it would have 
to be a grass house as the log one took too long 
to make.

Orientation 
After the children had drawn pictares of what 
they had seen on our trip to Gansevoort Market, I 
said, ‘‘Why doesn’t some one make a picture of 
our whole trip showing how we went to the Mar- 
ket?’’ Grace was the first to respond and drew a 
picture of the schoolhouse on Twelfth Street, then 
the Market on Fourteenth Street, and the docks 
and boats along the water-front. She showed 
Seventh and Highth Avenues crossing Twelfth  
-P-A-G-E-98

Street. She asked me if I would not take her 
again as she did not remember all of the streets. 
So we looked some of them up ona map. Several 
children became interested later and began draw- 
ing maps. Jenny drew not only the docks on the 
‘West Side and the Hudson River, but some mills 
over on the East Side, Brooklyn Bridge, and the 
East River. Dorothy and Julia made maps on 
which they pasted certain buildings standing up— 
the schoolhouse and later the Woolworth Tower. 
Several children drew pictures of the schoolhouse 
and the streets near by and located their own 
houses. I had to help Helen as she comes on the 
subway and did not know which direction her 
house was from the schoolhouse. She knew the 
station where she gets off the subway, so we 
located that on a large city map and then she 
drew her route home. Francis, after he had made 
a picture of the schoolhouse, Gansevoort Market, 
the wide street along the docks, and the Hudson, 
pasted another paper on and drew the New Jersey 
coast and then some trees, houses, and vines out 
in the country. 
Stories 
The Biography of a Grizely, by Thompson 
Seton, was listened to eagerly and asked for day 
after day. I had many pictures of bears and of 
Yellowstone Park, which I had just visited in the
-P-A-G-E-99
  THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 85 
summer, and these served to heighten the interest. 
Mrs. Mitchell’s story, Meadowland Farm, was 
welcomed by the group as an old friend. Some 
verses, riddles, and nonsense rhymes, from Skin- 
ner’s A Child’s Own Book of Verse, Bk. I, were 
read, and Stevenson’s From a Railway Carriage 
was read one day after the children had been play- 
ing train in the yard. 
Science 
The first time the children met Mr. Meister in 
the science laboratory they were ready with all 
sorts of questions and requests for help in build- 
ing the City. Dorothy and Sarah wanted to know 
how to make their boats so they would float and 
not sink (several children had had difficulties with 
this last year), Mary asked for electric lights for 
her library, and Jenny for her post-office, Walter 
for an electric engine for his boat, and Francis 
asked if he could have electric power with a pro- 
peller and rudder. Mr. Meister said they could 
have electric power for the City from the switch- 
board in the laboratory and that he would help 
them to understand how to balance their boats. 
Then he explained the laboratory and the neces- 
sity for care in using the gas, electricity, and any 
acids in the laboratory. He performed some ex- 
periments with acids to show their actions with 
different substances and what dangers might arise
-P-A-G-E-100
  86 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
in using them. He added sulphuric acid to water 
until the water boiled. He warned against pour- 
ing water into acid, because it might sputter up 
high and burn any one who happened to be close. 
He explained that a drop of water meeting acid 
is changed into many hundreds of particles of 
steam which try to escape, carrying the acid with 
them, and that in this effort to escape, the mix- 
ture might easily boil up into a face bending over 
it. He put a piece of wood, a copper wire, and 
some thread in acid and we took it over to the 
classroom. The copper wire changed to green, 
making a poisonous brown smoke. We found the 
next day that part of the wood had been eaten off, 
the thread was in bits, and the wire had dissolved, 
while the acid had turned blue. 
On another day, Mr. Meister placed an empty 
bottle in some water. The bottle tipped over. 
The children said, ‘‘Put some water in. Then it 
will float.’? He put some water in. Then the bot- 
tle floated, but still tipped. Then each child tried 
floating bottles in the water trough. Some of the 
bottles floated, but tipped; others turned upside 
down. Grace said, ‘‘My bottle floats with just 
this amount. It turns over if it doesn’t have 
enough.’’ Then all tried putting in just enough 
water to make their bottles float without tipping. 
Mr. Meister said, ‘‘Must boats have water in them 
to make them float?’’
-P-A-G-E-101
THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 87 
Children—‘‘No, they have keels.’’ 
Mr. Meister—‘‘Why does the neck of the bottle 
always tip over unless you get enough water in 
the bottle?’’ 
Roger—‘‘Not enough weight on bottom, too 
much on top.’’ i 
Mr. Meister—‘‘If a small boat like this has 
great heavy sails, what will happen?’ 
Children—‘It will tip.’’ 
Mr. Meister—‘‘A chair like this that stands well 
has the most weight on the bottom. But if the 
back were much higher what would happen?’’ 
Children—‘‘Tt would tip over.’’ 
Mr. Meister—‘‘Yes, too much weight at the top. 
Everything in the world must be built heavier at 
the bottom. Did you ever notice the Woolworth 
Building ?’’ 
Children—‘‘Bigger at the bottom.’’ 
Mr. Meister—‘‘ And the Metropolitan Tower is 
much heavier at the bottom. Look at pictures of 
the Hiffel Tower, too. Remember then to make 
your ships heavier at the bottom. How?’’ 
Grace—‘‘Heavier wood.’’ 
Dorothy—‘A keel.’’ 
Mr. Meister placed a bottle with a round bottom 
on the table. It stood, but when he poured water 
in up to the neck it tipped over. He said, ‘‘You 
see, it had too much weight on top.’? He also put 
nails in to make it heavy enough at the bottom so. 
 
-P-A-G-E-102
88 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE 
that it would stand. He said, ‘‘If we were heavier 
at the top than at the base we would fall right 
over.’? Then he picked up Julia and held her up 
to show how it pulled him over and made it more 
difficult for him to stand upright. He said, ‘‘If the 
bottom is broad it’s easier for things to stand 
straight.’? Grace stood with feet close together. 
Mr. Meister touched her and she almost tipped 
over. She spread her feet apart. He touched her 
again and she stood firm. He stuck two files inta 
the bottom of a cork and balanced the cork on 
the point of a needle stuck into another cork. He 
said, ‘‘Why doesn’t it fall over?’’ The children 
replied, ‘‘It’s heavy on the bottom.’? Then he 
tried to make it balance with the weight of the 
files on the top. The class said, ‘‘It won’t, it’s too 
heavy at the top.’’

The Play City 
One day both groups of Sevens took the build- 
ings they are making for the City into the River 
Yard in order to decide upon the best sites for 
mills and factories, for stores, libraries, stations, 
and for apartment houses. Later, at my sugges- 
tion, some of the children eagerly brought out 
their unfinished stores or houses and began play- 
ing. Other children cleaned out the cement river 
bed. After a discussion period in which we talked 
about the Long Island farmers bringing their 
trucks over to Manhattan to sell their vegetables, 
and about which I have told more under ‘‘Discus- 
sion’? and under ‘‘Orientation,’’ Jenny, imper- 
sonating a farmer, stood her truck on 102nd 
Street, she said, and the other children came to 
buy. This continued two or three days. Several 
of the houses are already inhabited by tiny dolls 
brought from home. These are put to bed, sent 
to market, or become ill and the doctor is called in.

Play With Big Materials 
OUTDOORS 
Play with the yard apparatus has gone on in- 
termittently. With the development of greater 
interest in dramatic play and in organized games, 
less time has been given to rope, horizontal bars, 
and ladder. Dramatic play with the packing boxes 
and blocks has continued. There have been drama- 
tizations of farm life, of cowboys in the West, of 
family life and of store. 
Organized Games 
The simplest form of ‘‘Steal Sticks’’ has be- 
come a great favorite. At first Douglas, Walter, 
and Roger were the most eager for it, but grad- 
ually all of the group have come to play it with 
enthusiasm and with a strict regard for the rules. 
Ruth was the most confused at first. Now, how- 
ever, she is by no means the last one to be chosen. 
Mary and Jenny stand out with the boys men- 
tioned as being the most daring, fastest players. 
Helen and Sarah have developed a careful game, 
watching closely. The game of ‘‘Birdies’’ is 
chosen sometime, too. 
Drawing and Painting 
With the advent of some new show-card colors, 
there has come a great interest in painting large 
pictures. Following the trip to Brooklyn Bridge, 
several large paintings of the Bridge appeared.
-P-A-G-E-105
THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 91 
Ruth painted the Bridge and the two high towers 
which we saw from it. Douglas and Francis drew 
the Bridge with boats underneath. Walter spends 
all of the time he ean get on careful drawings of 
boats. In shop, also, he has been interested only 
in making a boat. 
Ruth, Jenny, Helen, and Mary have been paint- 
ing pictures of the houses they are making for the 
City. Sometimes at home they draw pictures of 
these or make a street of houses. The pictures 
are labeled and often stories about them are 
printed underneath. The idea may have been sug- 
gested by one of the illustrated newspapers on 
which the Tens had made a picture of Ruth’s 
hardware store. 
For one of the assemblies with the other Sevens 
we had promised to report on the fruit and vege- 
table supply of New York City. I asked the chil- 
dren if they wanted pictures to illustrate their 
talks. Nearly every one of them, whether he was 
going to make a report or not, painted or drew 
some kind of a picture illustrating the subject. 
Dorothy painted red bananas growing on a tree. 
Grace painted orange trees with pickers at work 
and some boxes half full of oranges. Walter 
painted many different kinds of vegetables grow- 
ing on a farm, corn growing very tall with the 
white silk hanging down, cabbages, carrots, beets. 
Francis made a picture of a farmhouse with a 
near-by train going through a tunnel.
-P-A-G-E-106
  92 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
Grace practiced on a design for the sign at the 
top of her theater, and then took it over to the 
shop and transferred it carefully with oil paints 
to the theater. 
Mr. Zorach met with the group one time in the 
shop when some of the children were ready to 
begin painting their houses. They lined them up, 
making a street of houses, and he asked what 
colors he should order for them. Grace was 
for having red and green for her theater, but after 
Mr. Zorach had said that often a theatre was 
painted in rather dull colors so that the stage 
would show up more noticeably, she decided on 
gray. 
II. Practican Experiences 
Shop 
Interest in building in the shop has been in- 
creasing with the steady growth of the houses for 
the City. Douglas (with the help of Mr. Reber) 
has put several chimneys, and a tank with a step- 
ladder, on the top of his factory, and has finished 
cutting out the large windows and doors. He has 
painted the factory red and is now putting in 
white stripes, so that it will have the appearance 
of being built of bricks. He is one of the steadiest 
workers in the shop. Helen’s country house has 
two balconies and a roof and she is now getting 
ready to shingle the roof. After she had had to
-P-A-G-E-107
  
THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 93 
stay out several days on account of a cold, she 
came back very eager to get to her house again. 
During the entire first month she had great diffi- 
culty in pounding nails in straight, but she has 
told me that ‘‘they don’t seem to go crooked any 
more now.’’ 
Grace’s theater is painted gray and she has 
asked to dye some curtains for it. She has started 
a house for the theater people to live in, in the 
City. Roger has worked steadily at his boat. 
Jenny is painting her apartment house white, with 
green trimmings. She wanted a stairway and be- 
gan making one like Grace’s, sawing indentations 
on a side strip on which to place the steps. But 
she decided it was too hard, so I proposed steps 
made much like a step-ladder. She had no diffi- 
culty with these, and was satisfied when they were 
finished and put in the house. Nearly everyone 
has cut a hole in his second and third floor to leave 
room for an elevator or stairway. The boys will 
stay at work for longer periods without much en- 
couragement or help, than will the girls, with the 
“ exception of Ruth, who plods steadily along 
whether she comes to a very difficult piece of hard 
thick wood to saw, or whether things go easily. 
Dorothy left her apartment house for a while and 
made a mail box for our room as we are con- 
tinually receiving mail from the other groups. 
Walter was making so little progress on his
-P-A-G-E-108
    94. EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
boat that it was evident he was wasting time. So 
he was told he would be allowed only two days 
more on the boat, and then he must begin on his 
City building if he wished to be allowed to play 
in the City. He agreed that this was just. 
At the end of two days, however, he had not 
finished his boat. But he put it away without a 
word and started work on his factory. 
Cooking—Notes by Miss Hannum 
The study of the preservation of foods con- 
tinued throughout November. The children dug a 
pit in the City Yard and buried some fruit and 
vegetables to keep them until the spring. 
The following is a list of the fruit products, 
canned, preserved, or dried by the class: 
Plum jelly 
Plum butter 
Ginger pears 
Candied pears 
Grape jelly 
Peach and apple jam 
Cranberry jelly 
Dried apples. 
A discussion in which methods and proportions 
were talked over preceded each lesson. The close 
relationship of the processes of canning and pre- 
serving was readily understood. The children 
found the jelly tests rather difficult, but with the
-P-A-G-E-109
THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 95 
third lesson the testing was done independently 
and very satisfactorily. The lesson in which 
apples were pared and strung for drying aroused 
no general interest. The class wanted to cook 
something. 
Technique is improving. Skill in the use of par- 
ing knives has increased greatly. Most of the 
cooking last year was done individually, but now 
it is done by groups of two and three. Each group 
apportions the work to its members. The co-op- 
eration demanded in this way has been rather 
difficult for some of the children. But they are 
learning to work together better all the time. 
They are beginning to lose play interest in the 
dish-washing and general cleaning at the close of 
the lesson. This work has lost its fascination 
which lasted during their year as Sixes. They 
have, however, formed the routine habits and as 
a rule their work is thorough. 
Clay 
Several of the children had asked for clay. Miss 
Levin said she could take three or four in the 
pottery room during some of our free periods. 
Grace, Helen, and Sarah were the first to go. 
Then Dorothy and Francis and Ruth asked for 
permission and they were admitted. They are 
working carefully, Miss Levin reports, most of 
them on dishes they want for their City houses 
and stores.

II. Speci Tramine 
Reading 
The Tens are now sending us illustrated news- 
papers. This has added to the interest and 
enthusiasm in reading. One newspaper was deco- 
rated with the painting of Ruth’s hardware store. 
The window of the store displayed the shovels and 
seeds which the newspaper advertised she had for 
sale. Then at the bottom of the paper was a pic- 
ture of Gordon sowing seeds out on his farm, for 
Gordon had said he would buy his tools and seeds 
from Ruth’s hardware store. Another paper was 
brilliantly illustrative of the way Dorothy’s win- 
dow boxes would look after she had planted the 
flower seeds she would buy from Ruth’s store. 
Often a group of children as they come in in the 
morning, gather around the newspaper and read. 
It is seldom that I am the one who has to remem- 
ber to change the day and date. The newspaper 
is read with steadily increasing facility as there 
is much repetition of the words and phrases about 
City things, such as ‘‘apartment house,’’ ‘‘hotel,’’ 
“‘hardware store,’’ ‘‘is making,’’ and so forth. 
With each fresh newspaper there is occasion for 
drill on the new words and phrases and also on 
some of the old ones. The game of ‘‘Mushpot’’ 
has been asked for nearly every day. In this game 
the children sit in a semicircle in front of the 
blackboard or bulletin board on which the news-
-P-A-G-E-111
' THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 97 
paper is thumb-tacked. There is a circle called 
‘the mushpot’’ marked on the floor. Any child 
not able to read the word or phrase or sentence 
touched by the teacher has to go into the ‘‘mush- 
pot.’? He can get out only by being able to read 
more quickly than the child whose turn it happens 
to be, or to read when some other child is unable 
to do so. Then that child goes into the ‘‘mush- 
pot,’’ and the first one comes out. This game is 
always played rapidly and for a short period. 
Keen attention is necessary to guard against be- 
ing caught in the ‘‘mushpot.’’ Roger is the child 
least interested in learning to read. He is the one 
whose attention is most apt to wander. ‘‘Mush- 
pot’’ has served to point this fact out to him and 
to the group, and he is making some slow improve- 
ment. Races and games with the words and 
phrases printed on cards and on the board are 
part of the drill also. 
The Winston Primers were given out at the first 
of this month, much to the joy of the children. 
After the first pleasure gained through the mere 
handling of the books, and through looking at and 
talking about the pictures, and after I had read 
one or two stories by request, I said, ‘‘Now you 
may read the Little Red Hen story with me.’’ As 
the story was quite familiar, every one said it with 
me, turning over the leaves as I did. At the next 
lesson I told the story of ‘‘The Little Red Hen,”’ 
 
-P-A-G-E-112
  98 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
any one joining in who wished, and as I told it, 
I held up cards containing certain words or 
phrases, as I came to them in the story. Grad- 
ually, through constant repetition, some of them 
came to be familiar to the group. Then at the end 
of the story I used the cards for a drill. We had 
several lessons with ‘‘The Little Red Hen,’’ new 
flash cards being added each time. During some 
of the lessons the children formed in groups of 
two and drilled each other with the cards. Finally, 
the class read the story to its satisfaction, every- 
body being able to read a page when called on. 
Not all the words and phrases were used for drill, 
but the important ones were, or the ones which 
occurred over and over. 
Then in different free periods one child after 
another came to me voluntarily and asked to read 
““The Little Red Hen.’’ One child started the 
fashion and the rest followed. The next two 
stories were taken up in the same way. The 
children were continually asking to take their 
books home. I asked them if they were willing to 
wait until they could really read the first two 
stories. They agreed. The test of the reading was 
in being able to read all of the word and phrase 
cards belonging to each story, and then to read 
the story either to a child or to me, in a satisfac- 
tory fashion. Several periods were taken up in 
this way, little groups working together and com- 
 
-P-A-G-E-113

ing to me for assistance. Dorothy has used the 
same method in attacking reading that she did 
with the swinging rope in the yard. She has been 
the slowest of the group in learning to read, and 
has also missed four or five days of school. But 
she has determination. Here is an instance of it. 
After I had helped her in working with the word 
cards one day, two other children came to me and 
asked if I would let them have a race with the 
cards. I answered yes, and told Dorothy to go 
away. But she insisted on remaining, saying she 
would learn the cards that way. She remained, 
watching attentively two different groups at work. 
The Price and Sign Maker has been used al- 
most constantly. Ruth prints stories with it about 
her baby brother at home, and Grace and Mary 
print items about themselves from the newspaper. 
Sometimes Sarah and Helen have printed words 
so that the class might have additional word cards 
for their games. The boys print at different 
times, too, but are more absorbed in drawing and 
painting than the girls, so most of their free 
periods are given to work with crayons or paints.

entation,’’ I asked the children to think of the part 
of the trip they enjoyed most, and to tell it to 
me, so that I would feel as if I were really there 
again, seeing the things I had seen, hearing once 
more the same sounds. They were very ready to 
do this, but wanted to start from our schoolroom, 
put on hats and coats, go down steps, et cetera. 
I wanted them to record the vivid experience we 
had shared and not make the telling too long and 
tedious, so I persuaded them to start the story 
with the first glimpse we had of the Woolworth 
Tower. From the beginning the account went 
smoothly, except that the class needed persuasion 
to leave out tiny details.

Walter—We stood quietly in line while the man 
and Miss Wright got the tickets. Then the eleva- 
tor came down and we all crowded over each other 
to get in. Then the elevator lady said, ‘‘Now, 
children, we’re going to go.’’

into the shore. 
Walter—There were little white caps on the

Julia—The boats looked like toy boats. 
Dorothy—We looked down on the parks. The 
‘elevated stations looked like little summer houses 
on wheels. We saw the cars going across the 
Brooklyn Bridge. 
Douglas—Then we saw the sun shining on the 
ocean, way back of Long Island.

Jenny—We saw toy trains over in New Jersey. 
Ruth—New York looked like a little toy city, no 
bigger than our school room and the automobiles 
looked very tiny, and trucks just looked a little bit 
bigger. 
Grace—The Metropolitan looked as if it were 
ashamed of itself because the Woolworth was so 
high. : 
Helen—We saw an airplane. 
Jenny—Br-r-r-r. It looked much bigger than 
when we saw it from the ground. 
Mary—We saw a steamer going under the 
Brooklyn Bridge with a tug pulling it. 
Ruth—The houses looked no bigger than boxes. 
Sarah—We saw a boat in dock over in New 
Jersey, and horses and wagons and automobiles 
were getting off and crowds of people. 
Later, different groups of two and three con- 
tributed to a verse about the Woolworth Tower. 
As suggestions came I wrote them down and then 
read what had been given from the first line to 
the last. Certain parts were eliminated by com- 
mon consent of the group working together. We 
tried swinging to the different lines, and clapping. 
If one was too evidently out of rhythm it was 
voted against. One little group gave the first two 
lines. I caught another group who came in early 
from the yard and who, after listening to the first 
 
-P-A-G-E-118

two, contributed the next two. Another group 
gave the rest. The whole was then read to the 
class and received its approval.

“The Trip Across Brooklyn Bridge’’ was a

the same way as the Woolworth Tower story. 
There was the same desire manifested by the class 
to put in each detail of the trip. I used my influ- 
ence against this, however, as the group soon loses 
its interest if one contributor after another elab- 
orates, adding one meager step at a time.

Jenny—I heard ‘‘Woo woo,”’ in the wind. I 
heard the water splash, sh, sh, sh. 
Grace—The bridge seemed so old because it was 
So swayey and dirty. 
Sarah—We heard the trolley cars. 
Roger—I am the trolley car. Ding, dong, ding, 
dong, on the rusty old tracks. 
Mary—We saw the Statue of Liberty way off in 
the fog. 
Jenny—We saw boats floating along in the 
water. 
Roger—Chug, chug, chug. 
Sarah—We heard the horses’ feet. 
Jenny—Cloppety clop, cloppety clop on the 
under part of the bridge. 
Jenny—We saw a big steamer a little way from 
the bridge. Toot, toot. 
'  Grace—We saw a tug boat pulling a barge. 
Walter—With freight cars on it. 
Roger—Way down under the water the subway 
goes. Clang, lang, clickety clang sh ——. We saw 
Governor’s Island quite close. 
Grace—And from the middle of the bridge we 
saw the whole big city of Manhattan. We saw 
the Woolworth higher than all the housetops. 
Mary—We saw the Metropolitan. 
Francis—We saw millions of houses.

Walter—We looked up in the sky and we saw 
lots and lots of sea-gulls. They had yellow beaks, 
and one of them had a fish in its beak. 
Roger—When we looked toward the east we 
saw Brooklyn with lots of houses. They weren’t 
so high as the ones in New York though. 
Grace—We looked north up the East River and 
saw the Queensboro Bridge and the cars on it that 
looked like toys. 
Jenny—We looked further north and saw the 
Manhattan Bridge. It looked very dim in the fog 
because it was so far away. 
This account must have been totally unsatisfac- 
tory to Roger, however, for the minute the dicta- 
tion was finished, he told me he had a story he 
wanted me to write. In the first free period Roger 
dictated his version of our visit to the Brooklyn 
Bridge. He needed a little help occasionally on 
giving directions. I entered every little step of 
the way which he suggested, thinking he must be 
feeling the need for this detail or he would not 
have proposed it immediately upon the completion 
of the group account of the same trip. During his 
two years in the school, he has always made most 
picturesque additions to any group account. Some 
of his own stories also have been full of sense and 
motor recalls.

THE TRIP TO THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE 
(Dictated by Roger) 
Once upon a time the Sevens went to the Brook- 
lyn Bridge. We went to Sixth Avenue and took 
the Elevated to Park Place. And then we walked 
north and then west until we got to the entrance 
of Brooklyn Bridge. Then we went through the 
entrance after passing many many trolley tracks 
that go over the Bridge. Then Miss Wright said 
after we got out of the entrance, that we could 
run to the first steps and wait until she got there 
and then we all ran to the first steps and waited 
for Miss Wright. And then when we got there 
Miss Wright came and she said we could go to 
the next and the next, and then we got over to 
Brooklyn and we went in the Brooklyn entrance, 
down to where the trolley tracks were, and waited 
for Miss Wright to get the tickets. And by the 
time she came back, Miss Hughes and the rest of 
her children were there. And we got on the trol- 
ley and went all the way across the Bridge with- 
out stopping once until we came to Manhattan. 
After that we took the Elevated at Park Place 
again. And then we came to Fourteenth Street. 
And then we walked up to the schoolhouse and 
went in. And Miss Wright called us into the little 
room to have reading. And that’s the end. 
Writing 
Writing has been graduated from the large 
beginnings on the board, to creased sheets of big 
drawing paper, then to creased sheets of 
 
-P-A-G-E-122
108 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
smaller paper, down to the wide-spaced paper, 
using two spaces for capitals and one for small 
letters. Each child, except Roger, who has had 
difficulty in forming letters, has written an order 
for his crayons—blue, black, yellow, orange, red, 
purple, brown. Grace was the first to send in her 
order so she no longer had need to practice for 
that. She asked for ‘‘real paper’’ to write a story 
on. She was allowed to order the first hundred 
sheets of wide-spaced paper for the group. I 
helped her later with the story she wished to write 
by setting words for her on the board. Hach child 
has written a letter to his mother and to some of 
the absent members of the class. Stress is put on 
a comfortable writing position, with the paper far 
enough up on the table so that the arm can rest, 
with the feet flat on the floor, and the fingers 
holding the pencil as lightly as the chalk was held. 
Walter is the slowest writer and holds his pencil 
tightly. His form is perfect, however. 
Letters written at home by the children are 
brought to me almost daily. Ruth is the most 
prolific letter writer, and sometimes brings in 
large sheets of wrapping paper filled with news 
about her baby brother. She writes the same 
things day after day—‘‘ Williamson is very sweet. 
He is my baby brother. I hope you can come to 
see him soon. Love from Ruth.’’? Most of the 
letters are illustrated.

Number 
Careful account has been kept of all the money 
spent by our class for supplies and for trips. 
Expenses of each trip are counted up by the 
group. Supplies are received from the Hights’ 
store with the bills. As each person has ordered 
his crayons separately and as each crayon costs 
2 cents, every one has had some counting by 2’s. 
We received $5 in dimes one day from the office 
to replenish our purse, and each person present 
had the satisfaction of counting the dimes to be 
sure the $5 was there. All can count by 10’s. 
Several of the children cannot count by 5’s yet. 
Number games are chosen sometimes by Sarah 
and Helen during the reading period, which is a 
free one for them as they know how to read. The 
number games are seldom chosen by any of the 
rest of the group, who are generally eager to draw 
or use the Sign Marker in a free period. Facility 
in playing ten pins is increasing and rapidity in 
recognizing the combinations of 10. Measuring 
of the hole dug in the yard for storing vegetables 
for winter, brought in the use of the yardstick and 
the study of how many inches it takes to make one 
foot, and then two feet, which was the required 
depth of the hole. Measuring continues all the 
time in shop and cooking.

IV. Orcanization or INFoRMATION 
Discussions 
The children were very eager to talk about the 
large cattle ranches in the West where much of 
our beef comes from. Douglas, Walter and Jenny 
each had contributions to make to the subject of 
the feeding of the cattle and the round-ups by 
cowboys. Several of the group had been in the 
refrigerator rooms for meat at the Gansevoort 
Market. They were ready to discuss the refriger- 
ator cars that carry the fresh meat from Chicago 
to New York. A few of the children had noticed 
the little purple mark on meat that is the stamp of 
the U. S. government, signifying that the animal 
is healthy and good to eat. At our bi-monthly 
assembly with the group of Seven B’s, children 
from that group described the lassoing and brand- 
ing of cattle, and one child told of the dipping of 
cattle in acid baths on his uncle’s ranch, to free 
them from ticks. 
The truck farms which send over many of the 
vegetables at the Gansevoort Market were dis- 
cussed, with results mentioned under ‘‘The Play 
City.’’? I told of my visit this fall to a large truck 
farm on Long Island, of the mounds of beets 
buried, the celery planted in trenches, of the little 
plants of lettuce growing under glass, which some 
Polish women were separating, and of how only 
a few cabbages, carrots, leeks, and kale had been
-P-A-G-E-125
THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 111 
left growing unprotected as the farmer feared 
early frosts. The driver of the truck had told us 
that at six o’clock every night, except Saturday, 
he started with his load of vegetables across 
Queensboro Bridge, drove up to 162d Street and 
waited there with his wagon by the side of many 
other vegetable trucks until four or five in the 
morning, when the Greek, Italian, and Jewish 
peddlers arrive to buy their vegetables to sell 
later in the day. This visit also brought an inter- 
esting opportunity for map making which is told 
under ‘‘Orientation.’’ 
Trips 
Woolworth Tower. Brooklyn Bridge. These 
trips are related in detail under ‘‘Discussions’’ 
and under ‘‘Orientation.’’ 
Orientation 
Often during our discussions, as different 
places were mentioned or dwelt on, I sketched in 
roughly on the linoleum floor, or the blackboard, 
maps showing their location and direction from 
New York. As we talked of the cattle ranches in 
the West, I drew pictures of the way I had trav- 
eled from New York to California, and showed the 
two great mountain ranges I had had to cross. 
Sometimes I creased drawing paper for the moun- 
tains and stood that up, making high ridges for 
 
-P-A-G-E-126
  112 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
the Rockies and lower ones for the Appalachians. 
I pointed out Chicago at the end of Lake Michi- 
gan, and we talked of the packing houses there. 
I located Omaha and told of the smells there from 
the packing houses. The reason why there are so 
many cattle ranches just east of the Rocky Moun- 
tains was discussed. The fact was brought out 
that the winds from the Pacific Ocean have lost 
most of their moisture by the time they come to 
the eastern slope and that consequently much of 
this country is not good for farming but produces 
only a thin grass sufficient for feeding cattle. 
Then I showed them where I had seen waving 
fields of corn further east, where the cattle were 
sometimes sent to be fattened before being 
shipped to the packing houses in Omaha, Kansas 
City, and Chicago. The children came gradually 
to recognize the Appalachians, the Mississippi 
River, Gulf of Mexico, Chicago, the Great Lakes, 
Omaha, the Rockies, California, and the Pacific 
Ocean as we talked. I always began by drawing 
in New York and the Atlantic Ocean. 
Trips were taken to the Woolworth Tower and 
the Brooklyn Bridge to help the children in gain- 
ing clearer ideas of the island they are living on, 
and to see it in connection with New York Harbor, 
the Hudson, Harlem, and East Rivers, Long 
Island, New Jersey, and Staten Island. Many 
pictures were painted or drawn of the things seen
-P-A-G-E-127
  
THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 118 
on the return from these trips. The Woolworth 
Tower was added to some of the maps the children 
are working on, which show the schoolhouse and 
places in the vicinity, like the Gansevoort Market 
and the Hudson River docks. Ruth drew a map 
showing the school house on Twelfth Street near 
Seventh Avenue, the Woolworth (I helped her 
here), and Jenny’s, Grace’s, and Walter’s houses 
on Eleventh Street. She put in blue water 
directly south of the Woolworth Building. When 
she explained her map to the class she admitted 
that the water was too close. Douglas’s map was 
the most painstakingly done. He showed the 
Woolworth Tower, Broadway crossing Fifth Ave- 
nue at Twenty-third Street, many intersecting 
streets, and the schoolhouse. He had help from 
me in placing Broadway. 
While reading Mrs. Mitchell’s story of Boris we 
followed Boris’s journey in New York by pointing 
in the direction he was going—to the Hudson 
River, the Harlem River, the Hast River, the 
Harbor and traced his travels on a large map of 
Manhattan. Then I suggested drawing on the 
floor or board a picture of the way he had gone, 
starting on Fourteenth Street over on the East 
Side, making him walk across to the Hudson, then 
the long, long journey north, etc. I drew on the 
floor as the children drew, all of us watching the 
outline of the map of Manhattan which hung up on 
 
-P-A-G-E-128
  114 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
the wall, in order to get the land and water shaped 
properly. We spent only a few minutes on this, 
but each one had drawn in that time a crude out- 
line of Manhattan Island. Then we played some 
games of location, one child stepping on different 
parts of his map—Central Park, the Hudson, Kast 
River, letting other members of the group guess. 
In telling the group of my visit to the Long 
Island truck farm I was interrupted by several of 
the children who had been to Long Island and who 
were anxious to tell how they had reached there. 
I drew a picture of the way I had gone, showing 
where I took the train at the Pennsylvania 
Station, how we went across the city, underneath 
the streets and buildings, and then under the East 
River, coming up to the surface on Long Island 
to see factories and stores, and finally, after 
passing many houses, how we came to some farms. 
I indicated also where the farmer drove his truck 
each night across the bridge and where he waited 
until morning. 
Stories 
After we had visited the Woolworth Tower, I 
read ‘‘The Sky-Scraper,’’? from Here and Now 
Stories. 
The story of Boris was read as well and his 
trips about New York were traced. ‘‘Hben’s 
Cows,’’ from the same book, was read and asked
-P-A-G-E-129
THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL = 115 
for over and over. Helen brought the Just So 
Stories to school and asked me to read ‘‘How the 
Leopard Got His Spots.’’ But it went over the 
heads of most of the group and, as they were 
allowed to leave quietly if they wished, only four 
children remained to the end of the story. Kip- 
ling’s ‘‘Big Stdamers’’ was read and two of 
Louise Ayres Garnett’s poems, ‘‘Friends’’ and 
“<The Procession.’’ 
Science 
EXPERIMENTS ON AIR PRESSURE 
Mr. Meister tied a piece of cheese-cloth over a 
bottle and poured water in. He held the bottle 
upside down and the water did not come out. Then 
each child performed the same experiment. Mr. 
Meister said, ‘‘Why does the water stay in and 
not come through the holes?’’ Grace answered, 
“There isn’t any room for the air to get in and 
push it out.’’ ‘‘How can you get air in?’’ Mr. 
Meister asked. The children suggested, ‘‘Tip it 
over sideways.’’ Mr. Meister said, ‘‘Why does it 
come out then?’? Class: ‘‘There’s room for the 
air to get in then and push it out.’’ Mr. Meister 
held the bottle sideways and let the children listen 
to the water as it gurgled out. He said, ‘‘If I have 
a bottle without cheesecloth over it and turn it 
upside down, will the water come out?’’ The 
children answered, ‘‘Yes, because there’s a big
-P-A-G-E-130
  
  116 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE 
hole for the air to get in.’’ Mr. Meister said, 
“But if it’s a little hole?’?’? Then the children 
responded, ‘‘Then it won’t; there’s too little 
room for the air to get in.’’ 
Mr. Meister then proposed trying it with a 
bottle with a very little hole. He said he would 
make a bottle out of a long narrow tube by closing 
it at one end. Grace volunteered, ‘‘You can melt 
it.’? He melted the end of the tube which closed 
it up. Then each child took a piece of glass tubing, 
melted one end, closed it up, filled it with water, 
and found that the water would not come out when 
the bottle was turned upside down. 
In another period, the children made fountain 
pens and fillers. Hach child took a piece of glass 
tubing, and held it so that the middle of it was in 
his gas flame. When the heated middle part of the 
tube began to melt, the child pulled the tube out 
until the melted part was lengthened to a point. 
Then he broke it in two and closed one end. He 
used his closed piece for the fountain pen, and the 
other open piece for a filler. He put his filler in 
the water, using this in place of ink, and let the 
water into the tube by holding his finger tightly 
over the top opening. ‘‘So the air can’t get in and 
push it down,’’ Francis said. With his finger still 
pressed tightly over the top, each child then lifted 
up his filler and filled his fountain pen by remov- 
ing his finger, thus allowing the water to pour out.

DECEMBER 
I, Pray Experiences 
The Play City 
Tus weather was too cold or wet or snowy to 
admit of any play with the City buildings in the 
yard. As this caused much disappointment, I 
suggested that each building as it was finished 
be brought over to the classroom and left there to 
be played with until the weather was more pro- 
pitious. This proposal met with great approval, 
and caused some of the group to spend more time 
and greater effort on the shop work. One or two 
of the houses were painted the last day of the 
month and are ready now to be brought over. 
Housing arrangements for the City are quietly 
being made among the children as they work in 
the shop. Grace has engaged rooms for the winter 
in Jenny’s hotel for the actors and actresses of 
her theater. She is making a summer home for 
them herself with a large open space for sleeping 
quarters on the second floor. The butcher shop, 
branch library, and post-office are also provided 
with second story apartments. 
Play with Big Materials 
This appears under ‘‘Discussion,’’? ‘‘Drama- 
tization’’ and ‘‘Language.”’

-P-A-G-E-132
  118 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
Organized Games 
Most of the out-of-door playtime, this frosty 
weather, has been spent in playing organized run- 
ning games. The two groups of Sevens enter 
enthusiastically together into such games as 
“Steal Sticks,’? ‘‘Red Rover,’’ ‘‘Blue Bird,’’ 
“Here We Come,’’ ‘‘Cat and Mouse,’’ ‘‘Three 
Deep.’’ 
Drawing and Painting 
A great deal of serious planning of costumes 
and scenery for the Christmas play, which is dis- 
cussed at length under ‘‘Organization of Informa- 
tion,’’ has taken place, followed by the hunting up 
of materials, cutting, painting, and work in the 
shop. Mr. Zorach met with the group, each mem- 
ber telling him what he was going to impersonate 
in the play. After some discussion we decided to 
use tag board, drawing paper, and cardboard 
rather than cloth. 
The child impersonating an orange cut and 
painted an orange large enough to cover all of 
himself except his face, which, as Helen suggested, 
was ‘‘the spirit showing above the leaves.’’ The 
cranberry, banana, apple, orange and Christmas 
tree were represented similarly. The children 
tacked pieces of wood on the backs so that they 
were easy to hold. The lump of sugar brought a 
large corrugated box from home which she painted 
 
-P-A-G-E-133
THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 119 
white and on which she printed ‘‘Lump of Sugar.’’ 
She cut a hole in it large enough to get her head 
through, and slipped it down over her body so that 
only her head and legs showed. 
Each of the children cut out leaves suitable for 
his fruit or vegetable, and wore them in a wreath 
around his neck or draped in some way. The head 
of lettuce was represented by many leaves cut out 
and painted and pinned on the dress of the child. 
The plum pudding and turkey were cut out, 
painted and mounted on platters which were worn 
as collars around the necks. 
The scenery of the play took more time than the 
costumes. Old sheets were brought from home 
and different groups of two and three worked 
together, carrying out ideas that had been sug- 
gested during discussions. One scene was of a 
large fireplace with a most realistic fire and and- 
irons. Grace superintended the painting of this. 
She chose her helpers from certain children who 
had demonstrated to her that they knew how to 
paint fireplaces. Ruth decided to paint the 
dining-room table with the turkey and bowl of 
fruit on the sheet she had brought. With the aid 
of her assistants she put on a very elaborate table 
cover with an orange-colored design. Then she 
wanted a waiter bringing in the plum pudding to 
complete the table scene. Walter and Gordon 
both offered to paint the waiter. At my sugges- 
   
-P-A-G-E-134
  
  120 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
tion they each submitted a drawing of a waiter for 
Ruth to choose from. Ruth chose Walter’s with 
the full approval of the class. A third piece was 
a bookcase filled with books of different colored 
bindings. This painting took a great deal of time 
and patience as several of the books had designs 
on the backs. Children working on other scenes 
came to the rescue here. Still another bit of stage 
setting represented a china cupboard full of 
dishes and ornaments. This was initiated and 
superintended by Sarah who before this has shown 
little originality in any kind of art expression. 
The last painting was a small table with a large 
bouquet of different colored flowers. 
Mr. Zorach came in once or twice during the 
painting of the scenery and gave suggestions 
about the mixing of colors. He also gave some 
criticisms that were immediately accepted and 
acted upon, such as, ‘‘The waiter looks as if he 
had only one leg,’’ and, ‘‘The table does not look 
strong enough to hold all of the dishes and food.’’ 
‘When the scenes were painted the children took 
them over to the shop and nailed them on stand- 
ards so that they could be placed easily in the 
gymnasium where the play was to be given. 
Before the scenery was all finished several of 
the group were anxious to get back to their draw- 
ing and to the boats, trains, bridges, and houses 
for the Play City which they are so fond of
-P-A-G-E-135
THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 121 
painting, but for the most part there was thorough 
co-operation. Any one in need of help with a 
costume or design had little difficulty in securing 
assistance. 
II. Practica Experiences 
Shop 
As the making of the City buildings had had a 
very good start and was progressing to every 
one’s satisfaction, the shop period was changed 
definitely to a free period. Walter has been the 
one to show the least interest, perhaps because of 
his great love of drawing. As soon as the shop 
time was changed to a free period, he chose never 
to goto shop. When asked why, he said he didn’t 
know how to go on; didn’t know how a factory 
looked. We had a class discussion on factories 
and showed several pictures of them. Some of the 
points brought out about factories were that they 
should have large windows for light and air, big 
elevators, derricks, chutes. But still Walter was 
the only one who never took advantage of the free 
shop period. So the case was put before the 
group that Walter had started a boat and a fac- 
tory for the City and that he was working on 
neither. When one child after another then ex- 
pressed his opinion that there was a lot of work to 
be done in making the City, and that no one who 
did not work for it should be allowed in there when 
 
-P-A-G-E-136
  
  122 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
it was finished with all the buildings up, the elec- 
tric lights in, the electric trains running, and the 
boats going up and down the river, Walter went 
regularly to shop day after day, and worked hard 
at the large windows of his factory. Francis 
already has a derrick in his factory to pull things 
up to the second story. Roger left his City build- 
ing for a while to work on a Christmas box for his 
mother. He finished it with a lid put on with 
hinges, and painted it blue. Ruth has finished the 
stairway for her house, has the roof on, and, as 
soon as the paint is dry on it. is going to bring 
it over to the classroom. 
Work was also done in the shop in making the 
standards for the scenery. I have told of this 
under ‘‘Painting’’ and ‘‘Drawing.’’ 
Cooking 
The group has made Christmas candy with Miss 
Hannum. This came in nicely with our study of 
sugar which was occasioned by Ruth choosing to 
represent a lump of sugar in the play. 
Cooking Notes by Miss Hannum. 
1. CANDY MAKING, PENOUCHI 
The class, with the exception of Grace, had very 
little to offer in the way of suggestions. She had 
made chocolate fudge at home. Everyone said 
candy was sweet and so sugar must be used. Some
-P-A-G-E-137
THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL = 123 
suggested baking powder and flour, but the ma- 
jority scorned these suggestions. The test forma- 
tion of a soft ball in cold water was also suggested 
by Grace. Each group did that very well. 
2, PLAIN CAKE 
The year before the group had formulated this 
recipe and used the proportions as a basis in flour 
mixtures. 
No one individual remembered the whole recipe, 
but with the help of a group discussion all the 
ingredients were thought of in their correct pro- 
portions. The method of mixing was partially 
remembered. After the discussion the class began 
their work in groups of two. 
They carried the process through with surpris- 
ing rapidity, and their technique was so improved 
that their cakes were delicious. The results were 
of much better texture than they had ever pro- 
duced last year. Only one group, James and 
George, forgot baking powder. As the cakes were 
baking, the class noticed that those cakes were not 
rising to the same degree, and immediately asked 
James and George if they had used baking 
powder. 
Clay 
Some animals have been made for the parks of 
the City. Dishes and utensils for the City build- 
ings are being worked on faithfully.

IIL. Secu. Trawine 
Reading 
With the exception of Roger, Jenny, Gordon 
and Dorothy, all the group have finished reading 
the Winston Primer. Each child has been checked 
off on each story, either by reading it to me or to 
some responsible child. Many of the half hour 
reading periods have been given over to small 
groups of two or three studying together. One 
child would read while the other listened, then 
vice versa. Jenny read all of the stories, but 
found no one who would check off the last story in 
the primer for her, although she tried several 
people, including me. She was very cheerful 
about it, however, and took her book home over 
vacation, saying she would study it some more. 
Of the group, she is the least conscientious about 
studying. She is also the most inclined to exag- 
gerate the amount she knows. Dorothy works 
conscientiously and slowly, and for long periods 
of time, and is worried by the fact that some of 
the group are going faster than she. Occasionally, 
in free periods, she chooses to work with the word 
cards, coming to me for help. Grace and Ruth 
have made the greatest progress. They are so 
far ahead of the rest of the group that most of 
the reading periods are now free periods for them, 
and they may go with Helen and Sarah to the shop 
or to pottery or may choose other work. Mary is 
 
-P-A-G-E-139
   THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 125 
following fast in their footsteps also and often 
remains with the group for only part of the read- 
ing period. Ruth seems to be fascinated by the 
printed word. Her mother reports that she wants 
to do nothing at home but read and write. She 
sometimes brings simple little stories from home 
to read. Grace picked up Little Black Sambo one 
day in a free period and read some of it easily. 
She worked at it with help from me until she could 
read most of it well enough to attracf and hold 
Francis, Walter and Roger while she read. Helen 
and Sarah sometimes bring stories from home 
which they ask to read to the group. 
It was interesting to watch the attitude of the 
group toward reading the week before Christmas, 
when for several days it had been impossible to 
keep the reading period. Several of the children 
began to complain that they never had a chance to 
read any more and they would snatch up their 
books at odd moments to read. This group 
anxiety to read caused several of the class to 
finish their primers, and pushed Gordon and 
Jenny to work hard trying to do so. Roger and 
Dorothy were absent part of the week and so 
missed this wave of enthusiasm. 
The typewriter which we share with the Seven 
B’s is in constant demand when in the room. 
Letters are typed, personal items from the news- 
‘paper and parts of stories from the primers

copied. I had jotted down on the board the list 
of characters for the Christmas play as each child 
chose his part, and the copy of this program was 
typed or printed or written so many times to take 
home or to save for the play that, when it 
appeared in our last week’s newspaper, most of 
the group knew all of the words—banana, orange, 
cranberry, turkey, et cetera. Ruth gets her father 
to take her to his office to use his typewriter and 
brings stories to school about the different chil- 
dren and the City, or about her brother. 
Sometimes there have been printed directions 
on the board for the following day, and these have 
been eagerly read.

Language 
Language appears under Discussion, Drama- 
tization and Language. 
Writing 
Letters to individual children and to groups 
have been written by all the children. Some of 
these were notes of invitation, of thanks, or busi- 
ness letters. The mail-box which Dorothy made 
and put up in the room is eagerly watched for 
return of mail. Letters of invitation to the 
Christmas play were written to mothers and to 
various people the children wished to invite. The 
form of invitation was decided upon by the group 
and carefully written by me on the board.
-P-A-G-E-142
  128 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
This was copied, but sometimes with variations. 
Christmas letters were written, each child 
writing to whom he pleased, and what he pleased, 
while I wrote words asked for on the board. Very 
often the notes and letters were illustrated with 
colored crayons. The following letter is typical of 
the present style of composition. 
““Dear SISTER, 
Merry Christmas. I hope you will like Christ- 
mas. Love from, 
Dovetas.’? 
Bookkeepers are chosen every two weeks for 
their careful, plain handwriting. Occasionally, a 
test is given just before the election of the book- 
keeper. The list of supplies purchased which must 
be recorded by the bookkeeper is written on the 
board and copied by the children. The papers are 
looked over by the group with me, the ones easily 
read selected, and the election follows. Francis 
was chosen when the following items were to be 
copied:

The bookkeeper, in addition to recording sup-

plies purchased, must write the order when new 
supplies are needed, as the Hights who keep the 
store must be notified the day before materials are 
to be delivered. 
Letters are brought daily to school by different 
children. They write about their buildings for the 
City and draw pictures of them, or write about 
their baby brothers and sisters. Helen wrote a 
song for the Christmas play at home, and Ruth 
wrote out her part in the play and brought it. 
Some of these are given under ‘‘Organization of 
Information.’’ The typewriter, if it is in the room 
during the writing period, is always chosen by 
some as a preferred means of communication. 
Number 
On an election day for a new treasurer, the 
purse, aside from the dollar bills, half dollars, 
and quarters it contained, was full of nickels and 
dimes. Crayons had been purchased at 2 cents 
each. Therefore, certain tests for the treasurer 
were decided upon. He must be able to count 
readily by 5’s and 10’s and 2’s. In this way 
Francis, Helen, and Dorothy were eliminated from 
the election. He must also be able to count accu- 
rately and quickly the amount of money in the 
purse. Walter lost out here. Each person had 
a chance to count the money. Some of them care- 
fully sorted out the different pieces before begin-
-P-A-G-E-144

ning to count. Others sorted as they counted. It 
grew to bea game to see how many different ways 
of counting the money there might be. Two nick- 
els were put together and counted as dimes, two 
dimes put together and counted as twenties, two 
dimes and a nickel put together and counted as 
quarters. There is an election every two weeks. 
Different children have taken over the task of 
setting the clock each morning. Most of the group 
consult it at different times of the day, fearing to 
lose special periods of pottery, or music or play. 
The bell for lunch cannot be heard in our room, so 
the clock is watched for 12:35. There is an old 
clock face in the cupboard and sometimes small 
groups play games with it, one child setting the 
hands, and the others stating the time. 
Tenpins is being played all the time with better 
form and speed and more accurate keeping of 
scores.

Douglas came back to school from his Thanks- 
giving vacation, eager to tell about the cranberry 
bogs he had seen in New Jersey. He described 
them and told how the farmer turned the water on 
them to keep the cranberries from freezing. 
Gordon had seen cranberry bogs in Massachusetts. 
in October, and added some information supple- 
 
-P-A-G-E-145
  THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 131 
menting Douglas’s. I read about cranberries from 
Chamberlain’s How We Are Fed. We talked 
about what the country people are doing for the 
city people, and discussed the many different 
fruits and vegetables that are being sent in daily 
to New York City from all over the world. As 
interest grew in talking about the foods we had 
had at Thanksgiving time, and were going to have 
at Christmas, the idea developed of having a play 
in which these different fruits and vegetables 
come alive at Christmas and begin to talk and 
sing and dance. This came partly through a sug- 
gestion of mine that it would be interesting if the 
various foods we have on our tables could sud- 
denly talk to us and tell us all about themselves 
and their travels. The group was keen for a play. 
Helen had tried to get one started before and had 
interested Mary and Sarah to the extent of help- 
ing her for one free period in preparing scenery. 
But her play had not developed further. Nearly 
everyone was ready to decide immediately upon 
the part he wished to take in the play. Douglas 
chose to be a cranberry because he knew so much 
about how they grew, Walter a turkey, Gordon a 
plum pudding, Ruth a lump of sugar, Mary a head 
of lettuce, Jenny an orange, Sarah an apple, Doro- 
thy a banana, Francis a walnut. Helen decided 
she would be a Christmas tree, and Grace a little 
girl.
-P-A-G-E-146
  132 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
After each child had chosen what he wished to 
be, the discussion periods were given over to help- 
ing the different ones decide what they would tell 
about themselves in the play. In the end each 
fruit and vegetable, the turkey and the tree had 
discussed with the group something of his life his- 
tory, how and where he grew, how he was cared 
for and by what kind of people, and how he was 
finally transported to New York City and taken to 
a warehouse or market, and finally to the house 
of the little girl of the play. 
Occasionally, I read from Chamberlain’s How 
We Are Fed, or Carpenter’s How the World Is 
Fed, or from Smith’s or MceMurry’s Geography. 
But the attention of the group was held much bet- 
ter if such things were told, rather than read. 
Two days after we had first discussed the play 
Ruth surprised us by writing at home what she 
intended to say in the play. Later, Helen did the 
same thing. Some of the others came to me and 
dictated what they were going to say. No person, 
however, kept exactly to what was written down 
for his part. The parts were changed continually 
as the play progressed; Ruth added a great deal 
to hers, as did Grace. The life histories of the 
banana, the orange, and apple were not written 
down at all, but were told very well. 
We told Miss Hubbell about the play and asked 
if she would help with the music. She gave us
-P-A-G-E-147
  THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL = 133 
some free music periods for the children who 
wished to make up songs for their parts. Doro- 
thy, Helen, Jenny, and Gordon asked for some of 
this time. After they had made up the words for 
their songs, they went over to the music room and 
worked with Miss Hubbell in composing music for 
their verses. Afterwards, the whole class learned 
the four little songs to sing in the play. 
The following are the parts that were written 
for the play: 
THE LUMP OF SUGAR 
(Written by Ruth at home) 
I am the sugar from Cuba. I came on a sugar 
boat. I was boiled and ground. Then I got in the 
docks. Then I came to Christmas dinner. I am 
going to be eaten. 
THE CHRISTMAS TREE 
(Written by Helen at home) 
I am the Christmas tree. The woodeutters cut 
me down and brought me here with many a frown, 
and a lady dressed me up. She dressed me up 
with little balls and went behind the walls and 
went to bed. 
THE WALNUT 
(Dictated by Francis) 
I am the nut that came from the woods. And I 
loved it a lot because of the darkness. And the 
birds sang around me, while I hung on the tree. 
‘When people came to get me, a little boy shook the 
branch that I was on. When I tumbled down I fell 
 
-P-A-G-E-148
  
  134 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
on his head and he said ‘‘Ouch.’’ Then I was put 
in a bag and I was sent to a train, and then I was 
taken off and sent to a house. I was put in a 
cylinder, with a horse going round and round out- 
side. I rolled out on the big side and the little 
nuts rolled out on the little. Then I was put ona 
tray to dry with thousands of other nuts. Then I 
was put on a train again and I landed in New 
York. And here I am at your house on Christmas 
day. 
THE CRANBERRY 
(Dictated by Douglas) 
I was growing in a cranberry bog in New Jer- 
sey, where there are lots of other cranberries. And 
they put water two feet deep around us to keep 
us from freezing, because the water doesn’t freeze 
as quickly as the air. Then people came and 
picked me. I was sent on a train to New York. 
Then a grocery wagon came and took me to the 
grocery store. Then your mother came and 
bought me. 
THE PLUM PUDDING 
(Dictated by Gordon) 
I came from the kitchen. I was made out of 
dough and spice, and raisins and sugar and 
everything nice. The raisins came from Spain. 
First they were growing on a grape arbor. Many 
other grapes grow in California. But I grew in 
Spain. Then they came and picked me. And then 
they loaded me in a basket and put me on the back 
of a donkey with many other brothers and sisters.
-P-A-G-E-149
THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 135 
The donkey took me to the drying house. They 
dried me by steam. Then I was a raisin. They 
took me down to the docks and put me in the hold 
of a big ship, and then the ship came to America 
and then a grocery man came down and bought 
me. 
THE TURKEY 
(Dictated by Walter) 
Gobble, gobble, gobble. I am the turkey that 
eame from the barnyard and I thought myself so 
proud. But the farmer came and caught me and 
I didn’t like it very much. I guess that farmer 
was glad because I was so nice and big and fat. 
They are going to have a jolly feast [know. How 
do you like my looks? I am so nice and brown. 
THE LETTUCE 
(Dictated by Grace) 
Iam the lettuce, so stiff and so crisp. My leaves 
are so crinkly and yellow and green. 
THE BANANA 
(Dictated by Dorothy) 
Tam the banana 
That came from 
Central America. 
I’m going to be eaten 
By one little child 
At Christmas time.

THE ORANGE 
(Dictated by Jenny) 
I came from Florida 
Far, far, away, 
I am the orange 
That stands in your way. 
As the different characters decided on their 
parts, the plot of the play developed. The play 
was called ‘‘Christmas Morning.’’ The time was 
just before the Christmas dinner. The place was 
the dining-room. The scenery, described under 
““Drawing and Painting,’’ was the interior of a 
dining-room, the table set for dinner, and a 
Christmas tree in the corner. <A little girl comes 
dancing into the room, looks at the table set for 
dinner and says she wishes all the things on the 
table could talk to her. She runs out and the 
Christmas tree begins walking around and singing 
a song. Then in comes the turkey on a platter, 
the plum pudding, and all the rest, all calling out 
**Merry Christmas’’ to each other. They dance 
part of a minuet together and the little girl runs 
in, just in time to see them making bows. She is 
very much surprised and gets them to talk to her 
and sing and dance. She asks them questions 
about where they came from. The dinner bell 
rings then and they all dance out together. 
The play was given just before the Christmas 
vacation. Mothers and fathers were invited, and
-P-A-G-E-151
   THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL = 187 
also the Sixes, the Seven B’s, who furnished some 
band music before the play began, and the Hights. 
The bright costumes and wreaths of holly and the 
gay scenery made an effective setting. The play 
itself occupied only about twenty minutes and was 
not at all a finished performance. It was merely 
one act, simply and spontaneously played. Dur- 
ing the three or four rehearsals some of the actors 
had changed parts, and there had been some bore- 
dom on the part of the group during the re- 
hearsals in listening to the Lump of Sugar, the 
Nut, or the Orange tell so many times their life 
histories, in answer to the little girl’s questions. 
But there was good control from everyone except 
Ruth, who found it hard to be still waiting for her 
turn and listening to things she already knew. 
Jenny criticized the play before the last perform- 
ance by saying, ‘‘It isn’t so much an acting play 
as it is a looking play, is it??? They were all very 
happy over it, however, and had put in a strenu- 
ous three weeks in painting, music, dancing, com- 
position, and geography. Much of the reading 
and writing had been connected with it also. 
Orientation 
We took a trip to the Pennsylvania Station and 
saw trains leaving for Long Island, for Washing- 
ton, and Chicago. The Station Master sent a 
guard to go with us to the lower level to see the
-P-A-G-E-152
138 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
dining-cars, freight cars, elevators, and electric 
trucks. The children talked with an engineer sit- 
ting in his electric engine. He told them he was 
going to take the train only a short distance out 
of the city and then a steam engine would take it 
on to Washington. We saw the ticket offices, bag- 
gage rooms, electric running board for sending 
checked parcels down below, and finally came up 
the walking stairway. At the entrance the atten- 
tion of the group was held by the pictures which 
show some of the country through which the 
Pennsylvania Railroad goes, with its mountains, 
streams, valleys and forests. The large map 
there, too, showing the route from New York to 
Chicago, caught their interest and they wanted to 
have Chicago and Lake Michigan pointed out. 
Roger a few days later brought a large map of 
the world to school. This was thumb-tacked on 
the wall and different children were eager to find 
or point out the Atlantic, Pacific, California, New 
York, the Panama Canal, and Cuba (where the 
lump of sugar in the play came from). The voy- 
ages of all the fruits in the play were traced on 
the map from their original homes to New York 
City. Gordon left for California the last day of 
school before Christmas. He said he would write 
to us, and tell us what he saw on the way out. 
A new picture map of Manhattan hung up on 
the north wall of the room inspired Francis and

Gordon to draw a rough outline map of Manhat- 
tan together. 
Trips 
Pennsylvania Station. 
Stories 
Several: stories were read from the Jungle 
Books. ‘‘Rikki-tikki-tavi’? gave the greatest 
pleasure. ‘‘The Voyage of Wee Red Cap 
Brownie’’ in Dickenson and Skinner’s Christmas 
Stories held a breathless audience when it was 
told, the day before the Christmas vacation. The 
class greatly enjoyed also ‘‘The Little Engine 
That Could,’ retold from the ‘‘Pony Engine’’ by 
Mabel Bragg in My Bookhouse, Vol. J. Verse 
about winter storms and winds from the collec- 
tions of poetry in our room is meeting with an 
appreciative response from the group. Helen 
brought ‘‘The Night Before Christmas’’ and read 
it, holding the attention of all of the children. 
Science 
Mr. Meister had a conversation with the group, 
in which he showed them the new electric engine 
purchased for the Play City, and they told him the 
different things for which they would need elec- 
tricity in the City. He then explained the switch- 
board through which they might make their 
 
-P-A-G-E-154
  140 | EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE 
connections for electricity. He told them of the 
pipe that goes down to the cellar from the switch- 
board, and how this pipe connects with a great 
big pipe which goes to a power plant. This power 
plant sends a branch to each house so there are 
millions of wires in the pipe. Each pipe connect- 
ing with a house has two wires in it. 
The children traced the pipes going from the 
switchboard to the one that brings electricity to 
their plugs, and the one furnishing electricity for 
the lighting of the room. Then each of them made 
connections with their plugs. They experimented, 
touching the copper ends of their wires together 
and getting sparks. They found that if one child 
held his two ends together no one could get any 
sparks. They said it was because he was using 
it all up. Francis said, ‘‘Don’t you see, all the 
power is going to Helen.’’ They also experi- 
mented by having several children hold hands, the 
one on each end touching the copper ends from 
his plug. Each child reported a tiny shock. Then 
they wet their hands and reported more of a 
shock.

  JANUARY 
I. Pray Experiences 
The Play City 
Dunrine every free period business is transacted 
and social duties are performed in the Play City, 
which is located temporarily in our smaller class 
room. At the slightest opportunity, odd moments 
are snatched to continue the dramatic play carried 
on there. There is a great deal of dusting and 
cleaning of the houses and rearranging of furni- 
ture by the girls. Locations of houses, drug 
stores, the post-office, hotel, and theater change 
often. Sometimes there is a river drawn with 
blue crayons on the linoleum of the floor. Yards, 
with flowers blooming in them, are managed by 
thumb-tacking pictures of flowers and grass on the 
floor in front of the houses. The owner of the 
theater was very generous at first, loaning her 
theater to anyone who wished to give a marionette 
show. The theater was in such continual use both 
for rehearsals and for shows, however, that Grace 
finally said, ‘‘It was a good deal of work for me 
to make my theater and I think you should pay 
me five cents when you want to give a show.’’ 
This caused consternation and some indignation 
141
-P-A-G-E-156
142 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
at first, but after talking it over, toy money was 
proposed for use in the City, as the storekeepers, 
hotel owner, ete., would all be needing some kind 
of money. Grace was satisfied with this, but 
raised her price to five dollars. 
The hotel has been full to overflowing, as sev- 
eral of the inhabitants of the city have not yet 
finished their houses. Dorothy has had some dif- 
ficulties with her tenants. She came to me one 
day with, ‘‘Can’t a hotel owner put people out if 
they don’t agree? Helen keeps her room so 
awful. She lets things hang out over the roof.’’ 
We discussed rules for hotels. Then Helen was 
served with a notice that unless she became a 
desirable tenant, she would have to give up her 
room. Later, Dorothy had trouble with Walter 
because of the hard bed she had put in his room. 
He was very indignant because his bed was only a 
piece of wood with a rug thrown over it. I sug- 
gested renting that room at a cheaper rate, but 
Walter decided not to take it, even with a reduc- 
tion. Later, Dorothy complained that Grace had 
moved in without asking her. Investigation 
proved that Grace, while her own house was get- 
ting painted, had engaged a room in the hotel 
which she afterward found she did not like. So 
she had moved into another one, which Dorothy 
was herself using, without asking permission. 
Grace was evicted, and kind-hearted Jenny took 
 
-P-A-G-E-157
  THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 143 
her into her apartment over the post-office until 
her own house was ready. Dorothy decided it 
might save trouble to have some printed hotel 
regulations. She asked me to write the following 
ones on the board and then she typed them, and 
put them up. 
Apartment, 4th floor......... $20.00 
Roof garden ................ 10.00 
DUIBOT Sg ois ees oss v5.6 fo 1.00 
Breakfast ..... Sikes ae 50 
Dorothy had to do some calculating before she 
reached these prices. She said she would charge 
$10 for 1%4 week, so that would be $20 a week. 
Then in discussing prices for meals she decided 
breakfast should be % as much as dinner. She 
had no difficulty in making the deductions. The 
hotel is provided with a counter with a little 
hinged door by which the hotel clerk can enter. A 
small registry book has been made and is kept on 
the counter and a doll stationed there to welcome 
guests. 
Different children have helped the postmaster 
out by making tiny envelopes and sheets of paper 
at home for the mail. Helen received a letter one 
day and when I asked her what it said, she replied, 
“Oh, it’s telling me there is a drug store to rent 
in the City, and asking me if I want to take it.’’ 
I said, ‘‘Then you would have to live in the City,
-P-A-G-E-158
    144 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
and you like the country.’’ But she answered, 
“No, I can go back and forth on the ferry.’’ 
There have been several afternoons of dramatic 
play together for the two groups of Sevens. Dolls 
were taken up and down the elevator of the Wool- 
worth Tower at twenty-five cents apiece. One of 
the buildings which has a large roof garden 
proved a popular place for parties. Often all of 
the dolls of the City were invited. They were all 
seated at tables and served with tiny cups which 
were supposed to be filled with chocolate. These 
cups were then removed and saucers of ice cream 
served. 
Many of the group are so absorbed in the City 
play, the making of rugs, bed clothes, curtains, 
and furnishings, and the painting and drawing 
connected with it, that if they were allowed free- 
dom of choice, they would often choose to stay in 
the house and play rather than to go outside. 
Grace’s theater was so fascinating, by the time 
the curtain was put up with draw strings, and the 
footlights were in and attached to batteries, that 
an audience could be collected for any kind of a 
play. The turning on of the footlights and draw- 
ing of the curtain furnished sufficient joy. The 
first plays given were mostly domestic dramas in 
which going to the dentist or the feeding of chil- 
dren and putting them to bed played a prominent 
part. Any dolls or furniture that could be bor-
-P-A-G-E-159
  THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 145 
rowed were used. These plays entailed no work 
or thought on the part of the producers, except 
the hunting up of such settings as the play de- 
manded—tables, chairs, lamps, beds, rugs, and 
dolls. After a few days of this, I announced that 
thereafter no time could be taken for a show until 
the manager had shown evidence of having a real 
play and scenery to fit it. I suggested working 
together in groups. This demanded knowledge of 
the same story. So the children went to their 
primers and readers for the stories. While this 
worked very well with several of the groups who 
chose very simple little stories, some of the chil- 
dren found the producing of their chosen play 
brought along with it so many complications, that 
they lost the joy of the undertaking. Jenny, for 
instance, working on the ‘‘Little Red Hen’’ with 
Ruth, who proved avery poor support, was willing 
to drop the project entirely. When I asked her if 
she did not think she should finish it after having 
started it, she said, ‘‘Yes, but I know one thing— 
I won’t start another.’’ Francis’ story which he 
had made up himself was most satisfactory, as 
it contained only three characters, and he had no 
difficulty at all in producing it. 
Tickets were made for most of the shows. These 
were presented at the door, the printed numbers 
on them detached, and handed back to the pur- 
chasers. Sometimes there was a musical number  
-P-A-G-E-160
  146 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
preceding the play, a child or a group of children 
singing a song. The paper or pasteboard figures 
were attached to strings and let down on to the 
stage from the aperture in the top of the theater. 
Sometimes it took three or four children to oper- 
ate all the different marionettes in a play, and as 
the stage of the theater measured only fifteen 
inches in length, complications ensued. Details of 
the scenery and costumes for these plays are given 
under ‘‘Drawing and Painting.’’ 
Play with Big Materials 
OUTDOORS 
The ground has been covered with snow and ice 
most of the time, so that the children have had 
a wonderful time coasting on their sleds, sliding, 
or digging with shovels. Sometimes two or three 
sleds are hitched together with several children to 
pull them. This often turns into a dramatic play 
of Eskimos driving their dogs. One day it was 
Santa Claus and his reindeer. Forts of snow have 
been built and battles fought between opposing 
armies. Part of the time there has been a long 
stretch of ice under the slide, so that when a child 
reached the bottom he went on for a delicious 
three or four feet more, sliding on the ice. 
INDOORS 
“The Wee Robin’s Christmas Song’’ was

almost entirely by themselves in free periods, 
Grace and Jenny were the leading spirits of the 
group, and brought veils and robes from home, 
They made crowns at school for the king and 
queen. Francis was the Cat, and made a cat’s 
face and tail. It was the opportunity for playing 
the parts of king and queen that attracted and 
held the group in getting up the play. They were 
so well satisfied with the rehearsals that an invi- 
tation was sent (without my knowledge) to the 
Seven B’s to come to the final performance. The 
play seemed to afford a great deal of pleasure to 
the audience. The king and queen sitting on their 
thrones received the greatest share of attention. 
Drawing and Painting 
Everybody worked industriously on scenes and 
cardboard marionettes for plays to be given in 
Grace’s theater. My suggestion that they work 
together in groups on stories known to all the 
group, met with an immediate response from 
everyone except Walter, who always has his own 
absorbing schemes for the drawing of electric 
trains or boats or animals. He was persuaded, 
to join a group willingly enough however, when. 
he found they needed animals drawn for their 
play. Most of the plays decided upon were stories 
taken from the primers and first readers in the 
room, and therefore were mainly about animals.

We had ‘‘Chicken Little,’’ ‘‘The Three Billy 
Goats Gruff,’’ ‘‘The Boy and the Goat,’’ ‘‘Little 
Red Hen,’’ and ‘‘The Bremen Band.’’? Dorothy 
and Helen worked together on ‘‘The Three Billy 
Goats Gruff.’? One of the children said to Doro- 
thy: ‘‘You can’t make goats. Get Walter to 
make them for you.’’ Dorothy replied indig- 
nantly, ‘‘Yes, I can too, I know how because I had 
a gray goat this summer.’’ But after she had 
practised awhile, she became dissatisfied and 
asked Walter to draw one for her. She had no 
thought of using his in the play, however. She 
placed it in front of her as she worked, and made 
it serve merely as a copy. She and Helen to- 
gether produced a very successful play. Their 
goats and troll turned out very well. They also 
had some effective scenery—a river going under 
a bridge, and a distant green meadow. 
Francis staged his own story of ‘‘The Turtle 
that was Puzzled.’’ After working by himself he 
became dissatisfied with his animals, and went to 
Douglas, with whose help he carried on his work 
to successful completion. 
Ruth and Jenny both had trouble with the ani- 
mals in ‘‘The Little Red Hen.’’ Before they could 
get any satisfactory results at all, they needed 
much help from drawings made on the board by 
different members of the group. Sarah, when she 
found her play of ‘‘Little Half Chick’’ entailed a
-P-A-G-E-163

fair amount of practice to produce anything she 
would use, needed encouragement before she was 
ready to go on with it. But it stimulated her more 
than has anything else, so far, to try the draw- 
ing and painting of something other than houses, 
trees, and flowers. 
Douglas painted two paper marionettes of the 
boy in the ‘‘Boy and the Goat,’’ as he said it was 
necessary to have one scene where the boy was 
standing up driving the goat, and one where the 
boy was sitting down crying. The marionettes 
were attached to strings and let down from the 
top of the theater as the time for their entrances 
into the play arrived. 
Besides the drawing of the characters for the 
plays, scenes were painted of distant mountains, 
of far-off and near-by trees, and of rivers and 
meadows. After a play was given, all of the 
scenery and marionettes belonging to it were put 
away in a large envelope and labeled so that, if 
the managers wished, it could be produced again. 
Douglas and Walter work continually on large 
pictures of animals—whales, tigers, steers. They 
are very critical of their own efforts, but are held 
in much admiration by the rest of the group. 
Walter works at home also, on careful, intricate 
drawings of electric engines, and brings them to 
school to explain to the class. He inspires Roger, 
who has not such a great amount of skill, to work

é away too on trains and engines. Many of the chil- 
dren continue to make drawings at home of the 
Play City buildings and bring them to school. 
IL. Practican Expermences 
Shop 
Now that some of the houses are over in the 
classroom, with windows of celluloid put in, with 
curtains up, and families of dolls moved in, en- 
thusiasm for working in the shop has taken a 
great leap. Ruth and Sarah have each written 
me a letter saying they liked shop best of all in 
school, and to my astonishment I received a note 
from Walter saying shop was one of the things he 
liked best. Walter is now making the engines and 
trains for his train factory, and finds this task 
much more to his mind than the sawing of wood 
for windows. He has taken a great deal of in- 
terest in making and putting in the derrick for his 
factory, and has done a skilful job of painting. 
Douglas made a very successful derrick for his 
mill, and is constructing a dock for the boats 
bringing wheat to the mill. 
‘When Francis reached the stage on his factory 
where he could begin painting the walls to look 
like bricks, he said, ‘‘Now at last I am really 
happy.’’ But he has found painting in the small 
bricks a long tedious job, and has needed encour- 
agement to keep on. He traded off with Jenny 
 
-P-A-G-E-165
  THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 151 
several times, when she had a hard piece of saw- 
ing to be done, although he was not satisfied at 
first with the way she painted in his bricks. 
Furniture is being made for all of the houses 
out of thin smooth wood. Roger has completed the 
tables and chairs for his schoolhouse and made a 
desk for the teacher. He secured the assistance 
of Sarah in painting the furniture. He stands out 
among the group as being the first one to tire of a 
long job, but if he can leave it for a while and 
work at something else, he takes it up with in- 
terest later. He likes to go back to the boat he 
made at the beginning of the year and put in im- 
provements. He has just added a cabin to it. He 
has also made a bow and arrow for which he asked 
for extra shop time. 
Grace was the first one to start curving the 
backs of her chairs, and now several of the chil- 
dren are following her example. Every house so 
far has an elevator in it, worked with a small 
metal pulley, or a pulley made out of an old spool, 
or else it has a stairway. 
Jenny, who has found the room over her post- 
office too small to satisfy her needs, is adding a 
small box to the side of the building, to provide 
another room. She would not consider having 
more rooms when she first started her building, 
thinking it too much work, but now that she is 
driven by a real need, she does not mind the labor.
-P-A-G-E-166
152 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
Ruth and Helen, immediately upon completing 
and furnishing their first building, launched out 
upon other schemes—Ruth upon a warehouse to 
store her extra furniture, and Helen upon a drug 
store. 
Dorothy said that she needed to make a bed for 
her large doll at home as her father did not have 
time, so she brought the doll to school, measured 
wood for a bed, painted it, and put designs on it. 
She has painted a trailing vine on the side of her 
hotel. She wrote a letter one day saying, ‘‘I made 
my hotel, but I have not made a counter but lovely 
designs and an elevator and an electric light.’’ 
Repairing is occasionally necessary on the 
houses. But generally it is at my insistence that 
porch railings which show a tendency to come off 
are fastened on more firmly; or that wobbly step- 
ladders which slip from their fastenings are made 
safe. 
Sewing, Weaving, and Dyeing 
After measuring the open space of her theater, 
Grace cut some curtains from a piece of an old 
sheet and hemmed them. Then she went over to 
the science laboratory and got Mr. Paley to help 
her dye them a bright red. She sewed on small 
brass rings, and hung the curtains on a towel rod 
across the front of the theater. Then with some
-P-A-G-E-167
THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 153 
help she ran cords in, so that the curtain could be 
pulled easily back and forth. 
Seraps of velvet and scrim have been used for 
making curtains. Helen chose blue velvet to use 
as draperies with her white scrim curtains, be- 
cause the blue matched her furniture. Measuring 
has not always been done carefully, or enough 
allowance made for hemming, so that some of the 
curtains have had to be made over, in order to fit 
the space they were intended for. Very different 
standards prevail as to sewing. Sarah and Doro- 
thy, who have sewed at home, are not satisfied at 
all with results which suit Jenny and Helen. Bed 
clothes, such as sheets, comforters, mattresses, 
and pillows, are being made as beds are finished. 
Rugs have been woven. I started one card- 
board loom for weaving a small rug, and left it, 
with carpet roving of all colors and a ball of gray 
warp thread, on a table in the room. Soon nearly 
all of the girls were making their own looms and 
weaving rugs. None of the boys so far have ex- 
pressed any desire for rugs, as they are all making 
mills, factories, and schoolhouses. 
Cooking 
The work in cooking this month has followed 
definitely the study of wheat and flour which we 
have made in connection with our discussions of 
the source of food supplies for New York City. 
Muffins, cakes, and cookies have been made.

Cooking Notes by Miss Hannum. 
1. COCOA CAKE 
This was a review of plain cake with the addi- 
tion of cocoa. The amounts suggested by the class 
ranged from 1 th. to 3 tb., and each cooking group 
used the amount it thought proper. The cakes 
were carefully scrutinized and the majority of the 
class decided they liked the cakes with 3 th. of 
cocoa, both for appearance and taste. 
2. HOT WATER SPONGE CAKE 
The class orally reviewed their plain cake 
recipe, and the method. They have all eaten 
sponge cake, so it was compared with plain cake. 
I asked, ‘‘Why is it called sponge cake???’ 
The class answered, ‘‘It’s softer.’’ 
So I said, ‘‘What would make it more spongy?’* 
Grace said that sponge cake takes more eggs. 
They decided to use two eggs where before they 
had used one. I asked for suggestions for the 
variations. Mary said, ‘‘If it’s hot-water sponge 
cake, we must use hot water.’? Everyone readily 
recognized that hot water would replace the milk. 
Variations not suggested by the class were sup- 
plemented by me. The products were excellent. 
3. BOSTON BROWN BREAD 
The class had just been to a flour mill and had
-P-A-G-E-169
THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL = 155 
seen the wheat in the various stages of grinding. 
They gathered about the supply table on which 
they found three different kinds of flour for 
Boston Brown Bread, and readily recognized the 
corn-meal and white flour, but not all recognized 
the whole wheat. 
Next followed the naming of other ingredients. 
Molasses was named because the bread is brown. 
Baking powder, salt, milk, and crisco were 
mentioned. I told them that brown bread differed 
from muffins in having neither crisco nor eggs. 
They all agreed that the texture of Boston Brown 
Bread was much firmer and not as spongy as that 
of muffins or cake. This was again commented 
upon when their products were inspected. 
I said, ‘‘We have decided to use baking powder. Why?’’ 
Class: ‘‘To make the bread rise.’’ 
*“But we also use soda. Can anyone tell why 
that is necessary?’’ 
Grace and Roger said, ‘‘We used soda with 
molasses in gingerbread.”’ 
Proportions were decided upon and the work 
proceeded well. They were delighted to steam the 
bread instead of the usual baking. 
Everyone was surprised that steaming required 
more time than baking but the reason was drawn 
from the class. 
   
-P-A-G-E-170
  156 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
4, EXPERIMENT WITH SODA, FOLLOWING THE USE OF 
SODA IN BOSTON BROWN BREAD 
I asked, ‘‘When we made Boston Brown Bread, 
what did we find out about the taste of molasses?’’ 
Several: ‘‘It was sweet.’’ 
‘Did it have any other taste?”’ 
Douglas, Grace and Walter said it was ‘‘bitey.’’ 
‘“What is that ‘bitey’ taste?’’ 
No one could tell. 
I explained acids—weak, non-poisonous, and 
poisonous. 
‘“What did we use to take out the ‘bitey’ acid 
from the molasses?’’ 
Children: ‘‘Soda.’’ 
Then the children named several acid foods and 
they decided which ones they would try with soda, 
as some named were not in the kitchen. Molasses, 
lemon juice, tomato juice, and vinegar were used. 
They first used lemon juice and after tasting, each 
child pronounced it sour and ‘‘bitey.’’? Then they 
added a little soda and stirred it. They exclaimed, 
“Oh, see it foam!’’ 
After the effervescing ceased, they noticed the 
color was greener. They tasted and some got no 
““bitey’’ taste, but a decidedly salty one. Others 
said it was both salty and ‘‘bitey.’? Jenny sug- 
gested adding more soda to see if anything would 
happen. They did so. Some of them got more
-P-A-G-E-171
THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 157 
reaction, while others got none. Those who got 
the reaction discovered that the ‘‘bitey’’ taste 
was gone. 
These conclusions were then drawn: 
1. When enough soda is used, the acid taste is 
gone. 
2. As long as the juice is ‘‘bitey’’ it will foam. 
Next they tried sour milk. They noticed that 
the reaction or foaming was not so violent. 
I asked, ‘‘Why did the lemon juice foam 
more?’’ 
Francis: ‘‘It’s more ‘bitey’.’’ 
They kept adding more soda, a little at a time, 
until the sour milk taste disappeared. 
Next they tried molasses. The first change 
noticed was the color, then the foaming. They 
liked the flavor when only a little soda was added, 
saying it was sweeter. 
I wanted to know, ‘‘ Why is it sweeter?’’ 
Class: ‘‘The soda took the ‘bitey’ taste away.’’ 
As with the lemon juice, the class kept adding 
soda until there was no more reaction and the 
molasses had a very saline taste. Then someone 
suggested adding lemon juice to see what would 
happen. They did so and found it foamed again. 
*““How can we explain this?’’? I asked them. 
“‘The molasses stopped foaming, but when you 
added lemon juice there was more foam.”’ 
Some could not explain, but Douglas said,
-P-A-G-E-172
    158 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
‘“‘There was more soda used than the molasses 
needed, so it made the lemon juice foam.’’ 
Vinegar and tomato juice were then tried in the 
same way. 
These conclusions were summed up at the close 
of the period: 
1. If we use acid foods in cooking and want 
them to lose their ‘‘bitey’’ taste, we add 
soda. 
. Too much soda produces a salty flavor. 
. The more acid the food is, the greater is the 
reaction with soda, and the more soda is 
needed. 
4, The foaming will make the cakes, etc., rise 
when baked. oo bo

Reading 
The illustrated newspaper, when it is first 
thumb-tacked on the bulletin board, never fails to 
catch a group of children as they arrive in the 
morning. They are eager to puzzle out the news,
-P-A-G-E-173
  
THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 159 
and they gather in front of it asking each other, 
and me, words they do not know. The Tens are 
now finding time to print us two newspapers a 
week, which fit our needs much better than the one 
a week. This reading of the newspapers had fur- 
nished the only group reading for about a month. 
The children in the stronger group were gaining 
steadily all the time in their habits of study, and 
facility in reading, but I concluded that some of 
them might go faster, and their habits of work be 
checked up more easily by me, if they were held 
together in a group again in reading the same 
book. So all started the Winston First Reader 
together and were allowed to read or study it only 
in the group reading period. This added enjoy- 
ment to the reading for a while, but very soon 
Ruth, Francis, and Grace were excused from the 
group and allowed to go on with their individual 
reading, as they found the rate at which the other 
children read a drag on their own powers. Wal- 
ter, Douglas, and Mary have profited most in 
being held together in the reading, as they have 
not yet gained the same independence in reading 
as the other members of this group. 
The other group, Jenny, Roger, and Dorothy, 
have been reading the new Baker and Thorndike 
Primer together with enjoyment. They are now 
able to study earnestly by themselves for ten or 
fifteen minutes, asking each other words they do  
-P-A-G-E-174
  160 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
not know, or coming to me, or to one of the chil- 
dren of the other group. This group did not profit 
so much as the other children in the pre-primer 
work. One of their difficulties has been in keeping 
the place, and they began pointing with their 
fingers. To obviate this, each one was given a 
strip of tag board to hold under the line he was 
reading, slipping it along to the next line as he 
was ready to read that. Dorothy did not care for 
this method of keeping the place, and very soon 
said that she did not need that ‘‘baby thing’’ any 
longer. So I allowed its discontinuance, introduc- 
ing it again only when one of them evinced a need 
of it by pointing with his finger. Roger was the 
last of the class to finish the Winston Primer, but 
he is doing some reading at home with his mother, 
so that he is now holding his own with the slower 
group. 
Each group has a study period before reading 
to me, and is now held responsible for knowing all 
of the words in the story assigned. Occasionally, 
a printed list of the words he misses in the group 
reading is given to each child. He must then tell 
me these words before his shop or free period can 
begin. This tends toward checking up any care- 
less habits of study. If during a study period the 
group meets with many unfamiliar words in a 
story, as they did in ‘‘The Straw Ox’? in the Free 
and Treadwell First Reader, the reading period  
-P-A-G-E-175
THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 161 
is changed into a study period with me. The 
words that the children have asked for are then 
printed on the board, and a word drill follows with 
races and games. 
When the original stories of the class come back 
from the office in typewritten form, the children 
are anxious to read them, and work earnestly over 
them. Francis was able, with a little help, to read 
his story of ‘‘The Turtle that was Puzzled’? which 
he had dictated two days before. 
Different children have brought simple little 
picture books or primers from home, and have 
read from them well enough to hold the attention 
of the group for a page or two. 
In preparing the plays for the marionette 
shows, some of the children went back again and 
again to the stories in the readers, in order not to 
leave any of the conversations or action out of 
the play. Under ‘‘Writing’’ I have given the 
beginning of phonetic writing on the board.

Language 
Francis came to school one day, saying he had 
a play about a turtle he wanted me to write. As 
he told me the story of the play, I asked a question 
or two which he immediately followed up in the 
story. Francis has heard some of Kipling’s 
stories both at home and in school this month and 
they evidently influence him. When he finished, 
I read it aloud to him, asking if he thought there 
were too many ‘‘ands.’’ He asked me to read it 
again and he would decide whether to take some 
out. In this way he removed three or four 
‘tands.’? The Elevens, who print our stories for 
us, had criticized the plentiful use of ‘‘ands’’ in
-P-A-G-E-177
  
THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL = 163 
all of our compositions. This criticism was re- 
ceived with respect, and attention has been paid 
to it occasionally without any reminder from me. 
THE TURTLE THAT WAS PUZZLED 
(Dictated by Francis) 
Once there was a snapping turtle and he was 
hunting a place to sleep for the winter. But 
everywhere he went there were a lot of trees and 
branches and sticks and leaves, and it was a kind 
of a puzzle to him because he had never been in 
that land before. Then he went on and he met an 
elephant and the elephant said: ‘‘Oh, you ought 
to be ashamed of yourself. This is the land where 
the elephants grow. But I will help you out.’’ 
So the elephant and the turtle went on. But it 
was a puzzle to the elephant, too, for he had been 
in the zoo quite a long time. But he had escaped 
from his master and ran away into the jungle. 
And then they met a black man. And this was 
not a puzzle to the black man. Off they started 
down lanes which the black man had made. Then 
the black man said: ‘‘Mr. Turtle, here you are. 
Here is a place to sleep for your winter’s nap.’’ 
And he showed the turtle a hole in the ground, 
quite muddy and cosy and nice. 
“Thank you, black man, for showing me a place 
to sleep,’’ said the turtle. ‘‘Good-by, Mr. Ele- 
phant. You have helped me out quite a lot,’’ and 
in popped the turtle into the brown mushy mud. 
One shop period Grace asked if she might stay 
in the classroom and write a story on her new 
 
-P-A-G-E-178
  164 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
pad. Sarah and Dorothy then also wished 
to do the same thing. They settled down 
very earnestly to write, and looked up words they 
did not know how to spell in readers and primers. 
When I was free, they asked me for words. Doro- 
thy said she made up her story as she wrote. It 
shows memories of some verse read aloud from 
“‘The Posy Ring.’? None of the writers paid any 
attention to periods and capitals, but wrote freely 
and easily, entirely unhampered by such consid- 
erations. As each one showed me her finished 
story, I indicated where periods and capitals 
might have helped in my reading of the story, but 
did not stress this point at all. Later, Sarah 
wrote another story just for the joy of doing it. 
Jenny wrote one at home and brought it to school, 
saying her grandmother spelled words for her. 
The following are the first three stories which 
were written in school. The corrected punctua- 
tion is given, as this was the form in which each 
author received a typewritten copy for her loose- 
leaf note-book. 
It was the night before Christmas. Santa Claus 
will come tonight to Jill’s house only because she

and of illustrations in her book.

“«Thank You’’ Christmas letters were written 
by everyone on coming back to school after the 
Christmas vacation. Letters were written to 
Gordon in California in answer to one from him. 
All of the children, except Roger and Francis, 
now write short letters with ease, requiring my 
help only in spelling the words they do not know. 
Letters of invitation to the play were written to

mothers and different classes in the school. Here 
is Mary’s letter. She said, ‘‘I love to write. 
That’s why I wrote such a long letter.’’

Francis said: ‘‘I am too lazy about writing. 
But I like to make up pictures to represent the

as briefly as he could— 
Dear Mr. Reser, 
I want you to come to the play 9.20 a.m. Thurs- 
day in the gymnasium Fre neis. 
Occasionally, I have asked each of the class to 
write a memorandum of exactly what he had made 
in shop or of the stories he had read. There are 
practice lessons also of words all of the class need 
to use often in writing—New York City, father, 
mother, City and Country School, the names of 
the different children in the two groups of Sevens 
and the names of supplies to be ordered from the 
store. Roger and Ruth are the only careless 
writers of the group, Ruth because she writes a 
great deal and wants to write fast, and Roger, ap-

parently, because he has not been sufficiently 
interested to exert much effort. 
Regular practice in writing at the board has 
continued in order to check up on writing habits 
and help with such hard combinations of letters as 
be, br, ba, bi, wa, we, ve, ol, og, as they come up in 
new words. 
While the other children are writing letters or 
stories or orders for supplies at their seats, Fran- 
cis and Roger, who write painfully and slowly, are 
often given practice at the board in developing a 
swinging motion with words they wish to write. 
Lists of similar words have been made also. 
For instance, I wrote tell on the board and asked 
the children to write tell and all of the words they 
could think of that looked and sounded like it. At 
first lists grew slowly. All of the children were 
able to think of words like tell—as sell, fell, shell, 
but were not all able to write or spell them. Grad- 
ually, interest and ability grew and an eagerness 
to think of hard words to write, which contained 
the same combinations of letters. For instance, 
Ruth wrote Dunnington and Lexington as contain- 
ing part of sing. Mary thought of melon and 
Francis of skeleton when given tell. Dorothy 
grew interested in the game of thinking of words 
that were alike and one day wrote at her seat, 
‘“My little Bebby had a little baby doll and a hat 
and a cat and a rat and a bat and some fat and 
   
-P-A-G-E-182

some tat.’? This was considered very funny by 
most of the group when it was read aloud. Writ- 
ten composition appears under ‘‘Language.’’ 
Number 
Interest never lags in counting the attendance in 
various groups of twos, threes, fours, fives, sixes. 
The children answer readily also as to how many 
groups of two, or three, or four, or five children it 
takes to make our total. I have shown them how 
it could be written on the board if they wished to 
record it; for instance, 
2) 31. 
y 5% 
As I did so, I touched the five 4 ererent groups of 
children and then Francis who was the half of a 
group left over. 
There has been definite checking up of children 
who can count by 2’s, 3’s, and 10’s, up to 100 and 
beyond. Some of the checking up has been done 
through the counting of the money in the purse 
and some through writing the numbers on the 
board. Several of the group went on to counting 
by 3’s in columns on the board after finishing 2’s. 
Practice in the writing of numbers is still needed. 
Roger, Ruth, and Francis continue to turn 6, 7, 
3, and 4, backwards occasionally. 
Often when supplies are delivered to us from

Most of the class in their bookkeeping now dis- 
tinguish the correct places in the columns at the 
right of the page, for the recording of dollars, of 
dimes, and of cents. 
Help is still needed in recording scores on the 
board for tenpins, in keeping straight lines of 
numbers, units under units, and tens under tens. 
In adding scores, some mistakes have come about 
which the class considered funny. One instance 
was when Roger’s — written 
6 
0 
and he called the answer 70. Such very evident 
mistakes have served to show the group the neces- 
sity for the right placement of numbers. Tenpins 
is played with a much greater degree of speed than 
at first, although it is never played more than 
once a week. But there is much keener observa- 
tion, and very little counting. If a large number 
of the pins are knocked over, a child now says the 
number instantly, ‘‘8’? or ‘‘7.”? I asked Jenny 
 
-P-A-G-E-184
  
  170 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
how she could know immediately, without even 
stopping to look at the pins knocked over on the 
floor. She answered, ‘‘I just saw there were two 
left standing so I knew there must be eight 
knocked over.’? Mary said one day, ‘‘Do you 
want to know how I knew how many I had knocked 
over??? We all answered, ‘‘Yes.’? She said, 
‘Well, Walter had just knocked over seven and 
had three standing, and I had one more left stand- 
ing than he did, so I took one off of the pins he 
had knocked over, and said six knocked over.’’ 
Each time, at the appointment of a new treas- 
urer, different children are tried as to their skill 
in counting money. Everyone tries to count up to 
a dollar by different groupings of the money. 
Often quarters are built up first and added to- 
gether. 
Some papers of Thompson’s Minimum Essen- 
tials of combinations under 20 were left on a table 
in the room, and excited the interest first of Grace 
and then, through her, of various others, who 
asked for them to work on in free periods and to 
take home. The six-minute time limit was of in- 
terest to those children who care especially about 
numbers, but none of them have yet been able to 
accomplish the work within the time limit. 
There is continual measurement in cooking, of 
cup, one-half, one-third, one-quarter cup, and of 
pint and quart. Measurement in shop is not so

often in definite numbers, as it is in comparative 
or relative ones. The trimmings for the windows, 
or legs for the tables and chairs, demand accurate 
comparative measuring without calling for knowl- 
edge of the exact number of inches. The ruler was 
used by the girls in determining the length of the 
roving in weaving their rugs. Preparation of 
scenery for the marionette shows necessitated tak- 
ing some measurements of the stage. Roger meas- 
ured the floor of the stage to see if the paper on 
which he had painted grass would go in without 
touching the wires. The fixing of prices in the 
City has caused some work in number. (See ‘‘ Play 
City.’’) 
IV. Orcanization or INFORMATION 
Discussions 
After we had given our Christmas play in 
which the different foods on the table told their 
life histories, I remarked to the children one day 
that there was one kind of food on the Christmas 
table which had not talked, and asked them to 
think what it was. Immediately, bread was 
thought of. Then I asked who wished to be the 
Bread and allow us to ask him questions. There 
were several volunteers. We gave them each a 
turn and many questions were asked about what 
bread was made from, who helped in the making, 
and so forth. When Grace was asked how wheat 
 
-P-A-G-E-186
  172 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
was planted, she said that the stalks of wheat 
were cut in pieces and planted like sugar-cane. 
This led to discussions which continued through- 
out the month of the plowing and planting of 
wheat, its harvesting, reaping, and transporting. 
I told of the large wheat-fields I had seen in Cali- 
fornia, and different members of the group talked 
about wheat-fields they had seen in New York and 
New Jersey. The big modern machines were com- 
pared with the old ways of harvesting. We 
learned some songs about old-fashioned millers 
and farmers. National Geographic pictures were 
used, and pictures from geographies. Chamber- 
lain, Tappan, Carpenter, Parkins and McMurry, 
and Russell Smith served as references for the 
teacher. 
We visited Hecker’s Flour Mill on the East 
River. A guide conducted us from the docks at 
the mill where the boats bring their loads of 
wheat, to the different floors where the wheat is 
separated, scoured, crushed, and sifted, and finally 
sewed up in bags. We also saw the great engine 
room which furnishes power to all of the machin- 
ery of the mill. The miller gave us some wheat 
seeds and later, in our coffee mill, we ground these 
into flour.

Orientation 
Before we visited Hecker’s Flour Mill, we 
traced the way there on the large picture map of 
New York City, starting from the schoolhouse, 
following our journey on the Seventh Avenue sub- 
way, then on the cross-town bus, and then the 
short walk to the mill by the side of the river. 
The map of New York is hung in a convenient, 
low place on a door, so that often a child goes to 
it for the pleasure of tracing a trip he has taken, 
or his journey home from school each day. On 
Roger’s return from Chicago, he told us of his 
trip; how he had started from the Grand Central 
Station with an electric engine, and how the train 
had had to wait at Harmon, which is up the Hud- 
son River a little way, while the electric engine 
was changed for a steam engine. He told us of 
Chicago, and of Lake Michigan, and said he did 
not notice any of the smells there that I had told 
him about. But he thought he knew the reason 
why, he said, because he was far away from the 
meat packing houses.' We traced his route from 
New York to Chicago on the large wall map of 
the United States. Then different children 
wanted to tell of their trips during the Christmas 
vacation and trace them on the map. Jenny had 
gone to Long Island. She told us just how she 
had gone, from what station she had left New  
-P-A-G-E-188
    
174 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
York and showed us, with a little help from me, 
her destination in Long Island. Mary had gone 
to Newark. After she had described her mode of 
traveling there, we found Newark on the map and 
traced her journey. Grace had gone to Rockaway 
Beach. She offered to show us exactly how she 
had traveled there. She first located, approxi- 
mately, her home on Eleventh Street, then found 
Grand Central Station, then the East River and 
finally Rockaway Beach. I told of my trip up into 
the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, and 
showed where I had crossed the Hudson River, 
where I had taken the Lackawanna train, and then 
where I had crossed the Appalachian Mountains 
through the Delaware Water Gap. 
There were several discussions of direction in 
connection with the play houses in the room— 
which side of the room should represent New Jer- 
sey and which New York City, where the apart- 
ment houses should be located, and where the 
stores. 
Stories 
From Kenneth Graham’s Cambridge Book of 
Poetry rhymes and jingles about the snow, the 
windows and Robin Redbreast, were read to the 
evident enjoyment of the children. Certain 
verses from the Posy Ring have become favorites 
with the group. Stevenson’s ‘‘Windy Nights,’’
-P-A-G-E-189
  
THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 175 
Butt’s ‘‘Winter Night,’? Stedman’s ‘‘What the 
Winds Bring,’’ are asked for over and over. 
“The Burning of the Rice Fields,’? from 
Bryant’s Stories to Tell to Children, was read and 
asked for again. Dorothy brought Kipling’s Just 
So Stories from home and asked for ‘‘How the 
Whale Got His Throat’’ and ‘‘The Butterfly That 
Stamped.’’ Later ‘‘Mowgli,’’ from the Jungle 
Book, was greatly enjoyed by the group. 
Science 
The class was given some time in the laboratory 
to enable them to practice the wiring of houses 
for electricity. They scraped the cotton off the 
wire and attached lamps to two wires strung 
across the room. They were asked by Mr. Paley, 
““Why do we need two wires for electricity?’ 
Francis answered, ‘‘One wire for the electricity 
to come into and one to go out.’’ Then Mr. 
Paley said, ‘‘Show us.’’? Francis pointed to one 
of the wires and said, ‘‘Electricity comes into this 
wire of the lamp and up through the other wire 
attached to the lamp.’? Jenny added, ‘‘It goes 
through one wire, through the lamp, through the 
other wire and back again.’’? Later, Grace and 
Jenny went over to the laboratory and wired the 
theater and post-office for the Play City. They 
brought these two buildings over to our room and 
then connected them with batteries. Francis.  
-P-A-G-E-190
  176 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
helped Mr. Paley make the connections for elec- 
tricity in a dark closet opening out of our room, 
Francis doing nearly all of the work. 
Grace dyed the curtains for her theater a bright 
red, and put them on draw strings. Dorothy had 
the help of Mr. Paley in putting in the elevator 
for her hotel with an ordinary awning pulley and 
string.

The Play City 
Immediately, whenever any of the boys joined 
the group in the Play City in the smaller class- 
room, the play of automobile and ‘‘cops’’ was 
added to what was already going on. One very 
cold day the whole group chose to study inside 
and play with the City buildings rather than play 
out in the yard. Toy automobiles began going up 
and down the streets, passengers were taken, and 
“‘cops’’ became very busy. Several shows were 
given and there was a party. As a rule, during a 
free period, only part of the group chose to play 
in the City at the same time. Sometimes some 
of the Seven B’s brought their buildings in and 
there was even keener interest in the play, with 
the addition of the Woolworth Tower, Cushman’s 
Bakery, the Piggly Wiggly Grocery Store, and the 
Pennsylvania Station. Ross from the Seven B’s 
came in one day saying: ‘‘Have any of you 
houses to rent? I can’t live in the Woolworth 
Building. I’d rather live in the country.’’ The 
only house in the country offered him was Helen’s, 
which he did not accept, so he went back to his 
own group and rented one.

Play with Big Materials 
OUTDOORS 
Coasting on sleds out in the icy, snowy yard has 
been a popular, exciting sport. Dramatic play of 
hunters, Eskimos, and Indians often goes along 
with it. The boys are much more daring than the 
girls and show greater skill in guiding their sleds. 
Some of them are thoughtful of the more timid 
of the girls and enjoy hauling them around in the 
yard.

On wet, stormy days we have played in the gym- 
nasium where the children work with enthusiasm 
on the rings.

Drawing and Painting 
ILLUSTRATING COVERS FOR LOOSE-LEAF BOOKS 
As soon as a child had finished working on the 
marionettes and scenery for his marionette show, 
he was allowed to begin designs for the loose-leaf 
book covers, which were to hold the printed copies 
of his original stories and the class newspapers. 
The covers had been cut from whipple board in 
beautiful shades of blue, green, orange, and 
brown, and each child chose the color he liked.
-P-A-G-E-193
THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 179 
Most of the children were eager for the book 
covers and enjoyed to the utmost deciding on the 
titles and designs for their books. Any medium 
that the owner desired was used—colored paper, 
paints, or crayons. In working out the titles with 
colored papers, the letters were cut from small 
squares and pasted on carefully. Some instruc- 
tion was given by Mr. Zorach on the cutting and 
printing of letters. Some of the titles chosen 
were: ‘‘Dorothy’s Make Believe Stories,’’ 
‘“‘Helen’s School Book,’’? ‘Douglas’ Jungle 
Book.’? When pages for the loose-leaf books 
were given out, illustrative work began immedi- 
ately. Pictures of the children mentioned ap- 
peared, and of the different City buildings, and 
there were drawings of the various activities 
recorded. Everybody laughed at Walter, who 
could not resist putting some of his wonderful 
lions and tigers on the pages of news about the 
Play City. 
DESIGNING AND MAKING COSTUMES FOR THE PLAY 
Costumes and scenery were started for the play, 
“‘The Story of the Wheat,’’ an account of which 
appears under ‘‘Language and Dramatizations.’’ 
Sarah was the miller in the play and, after making 
the framework for the front of the mill in the 
shop, she tacked on cheese-cloth and painted in 
bricks for the walls and a window. Douglas
-P-A-G-E-194
  180 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
helped her in printing the sign ‘‘Hecker’s Flour 
Mill,’’ which she placed over the door. She made 
a little white muslin coat and miller’s cap and 
brought some pajamas from home for trousers, so 
that she was dressed all in white. Ross from the 
Seven B’s made the bake shop in a similar 
fashion, except that he painted it brown instead of 
brick color. He made a baker’s cap and wore his 
white cooking apron. Nearly all of the costumes 
were cut out by the children in kimona fashion. 
They were sewed with colored worsted. 
The wheat seeds cut their costumes from yellow 
cheese-cloth and sewed them up, cutting points at 
the bottom. They made high pointed caps of card- 
board and painted them brown and yellow to re- 
semble heads of wheat. Tassels of yellow paper 
were stuck in slits in the caps, which were tied 
under the chins with strings of yellow cheese-cloth. 
The children representing the rain and the wind 
made their costumes from white cheese-cloth and 
painted them various colors as their fancies dic- 
tated. Silver and gray paint was used mostly 
on the rain costumes. The wind costumes were 
painted in many different colors, green and brown 
predominating. The costumes of the children who 
took the part of the bolter, which sifts the wheat 
in the mill, were long, straight muslin robes. Stiff 
collars of cardboard held them out at the neck so 
that the desired cylindrical shape was given.
-P-A-G-E-195
THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL = 181 
The reapers made their costumes from burlap. 
Roger sewed his up with such large stitches that 
in places there were gaps which showed the rough 
edges. He became dissatisfied with it after trying 
it on several times, and ripped it out, sewing it up 
again with much smaller stitches. Designs sug- 
gestive of machinery were painted on the reaper 
costumes. Spokes of wheels, tanks, nuts, bolts, 
and blades were painted. Black paint was chosen 
for the most part for these. Orange and yellow 
were used as a relief to this severe color after I 
had made the suggestion. Douglas, Walter, and 
Roger represented the reaping machine and in 
making their costumes consulted all the pictures 
of harvesters, reaping and threshing machines, 
that they could find in the geographies and books 
about the room. They drew several pictures of 
machines, and some designs on paper, and on the 
board, before they tried them on the costumes. 
In painting the designs, the costumes were 
slipped over the board of the easel, which made 
the painting very easy. 
The Sun made her costume from orange-colored 
cheese-cloth and a head-dress of cardboard with 
points cut in front to look like the rays of the sun. 
She covered the cardboard with gold paper. The 
children, who represented the barge which carried 
the wheat to the mill, made two separate frames 
in shop which they then covered with cheese-cloth.  
-P-A-G-E-196
    182 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
These were painted to look like the two sides of a 
barge, showing the door through which the wheat 
was emptied, and the cabin. In the play the two 
children stood in between the two sides of the 
barge holding them, and furnishing the motor 
power. The barge was large enough to hold also 
the three children who were the seeds of wheat. 
The horse in the play gave the greatest amount of 
pleasure to the children in the audience and also 
to the actors. Two of the boys from the Seven B’s 
made the costume. One of them acted as the 
head and front legs of the horse, and the other as 
the back and hind legs. The boys, working to- 
gether, first drew the head of the horse, on card- 
board and cut it out, and then with some help from 
Miss Hughes covered it with brown lining. They 
made a slip of the brown lining and sewed it on to 
the horse’s head. When this was put over the 
children’s heads and backs, it formed the back 
and sides of the horse, leaving their legs showing. 
They made the mane and tail from rope which 
they unraveled. The horse was sufficiently life- 
like to frighten a little four-year-old in the au- 
dience. — 
There were many conferences and consultations 
over the costumes. Sometimes, when difficulties 
arose, children from both groups held these by 
themselves, but more often Mr. Zorach and the two
-P-A-G-E-197
THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 183 
teachers were asked for advice. The making of 
the costumes proceeded in a leisurely fashion. 
Many free periods were devoted by some of the 
children to the sewing and designing of their cos- 
tumes. Others not so interested in this phase of 
the work, or those having costumes the making of 
which did not require a great deal of time, spent 
only their drawing periods in this way. 
Mary said, ‘‘I like to give plays, because I like 
to make costumes.’’ She was very kind to Fran- 
cis in sewing up his hem for him after he had 
struggled with the side seams. Ruth displayed a 
great deal of patience and perseverance in making 
her rain costume. She sewed the wrong edges to- 
gether at first and when she found out her mistake 
ripped it out, and immediately began sewing the 
proper sides together. I said to her: ‘*You must 
like to sew very much, Ruth. You have worked 
such a long time now. Why don’t you put it away 
for another day?’’ Ruth replied: ‘‘I don’t like 
to sew. I just do it to get it done.’? And she 
stayed with it until the end of the period. Jenny 
found that her haphazard way of working brought 
with it a great deal of unnecessary trouble when 
it came to making caps. She did some very care- 
less measuring for her wheat cap and had to cut 
out many patterns before she finally succeeded in 
getting a cap that fitted her head. 
With all of this work in painting and drawing 
 
-P-A-G-E-198
  et

which was stimulated by the making of books and 
costumes, some of the class still found time to 
carry on their own individual schemes. Large 
paintings of boats, trains, houses, and animals 
were worked on during free hours or in the draw- 
ing period. Under ‘‘Orientation’’ I have told of 
the drawing of maps. 
II. Practica, Experiences 
Shop 
The children made the framework of the mill 
and of the bakery and barge for the play, in the 
shop. They worked out the measurements before 
going to shop. The bakery was made with three 
sides and proved too complicated for the children 
working by themselves. So the mill was made in 
a simpler fashion. Only the front side was at- 
tempted. It was supported then by two braces, 
and proved very satisfactory. 
Regular work on the City buildings has gone 
on. Ruth, without my knowledge, pulled off the 
shingled sloping roof of her hardware store which 
she had worked on so hard and then put a railing 
around the top. She explained that she did it 
because she needed the extra room it gave her on 
the top floor. She also added another room to her 
house by nailing a small box to the side. Furni- 
ture is being made for all of the houses, and 
shelves and counters for the stores.

Cooking Notes by Miss Hannum 
I. OATMEAL COOKIES 
Again plain cake recipe was used as the founda- 
tion. Some suggestions from the class were as 
follows: 
1. Cookie batter is stiffer than cake and there- 
fore we must use either more flour or less milk. 
2. Oatmeal must be used, half flour and half 
oatmeal. 
3. Cookies can be rolled out and cut or dropped 
by spoonfuls. 
_ 4, Oatmeal cookies are brown so molasses or 
brown sugar is used. 
Neither spice nor the addition of more fat was 
suggested. 
I spoke of cinnamon for flavor and the class sug- 
gested the amount. I also said that a stiff cookie 
batter needed more fat and the class suggested 
doubling the amount.  
-P-A-G-E-200
  186 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
2, VALENTINE CAKE 
The children have improved so much in their 
technique that in the same period they were able 
to make the icing and to ice the cakes. They used 
pink coloring and heart-shaped cutters. Scarcely 
a child was hesitant about proportions or method 
of mixing except those who had been absent many 
times. The enthusiasm was very high and every- 
one worked diligently. Suggestions for the icing 
ingredients came from Grace, Jenny, and Douglas. 
Only once before had they had the experience of 
testing syrup density by dropping some in cold 
water. They remembered it and tested very well. 
3. WHITE BREAD 
Once, the year before, the class had made bread. 
They remembered that flour, salt, milk and yeast 
were used. Sugar and shortening were forgotten. 
The necessity for lukewarm temperature had to 
be recalled, also the method of testing. There 
was considerable discussion of yeast and the need 
for exactness in its use. In kneading the dough, 
some of the children manipulated it fairly well. 
Everyone succeeded in shaping a loaf without 
assistance. 
4. CORN MUFFINS 
This recipe again was based on the plain cake 
recipe. The necessary variations were readily
-P-A-G-E-201
THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 187 
suggested,—for example, that muffins are not as 
sweet as cake so less sugar must be used, also corn 
muffins must contain corn-meal. More suggestions 
were made as to the proportions; half corn-meal 
and half white flour, and only: 2-4 th. of sugar. 
Melting the fat instead of blending it with the 
sugar, was also decided upon by class discussion. 
Otherwise, they followed the plain cake recipe. 
The muffins were, without exception, very good 
indeed.

Reading 
The younger group has been gaining steadily 
in their power of application. Their span of at- 
tention is noticeably shorter, however, than that 
of the children of the stronger group. Roger’s 
mother has reported that he asks her regularly 
each night at home if she will listen to him read. 
He reads with enjoyment for a short while, but 
does not care to stay with it long. Often, after a 
group study period, I have printed the words that 
the children have asked me for on the board and 
a word drill has followed. With the stronger 
group sometimes the reading period has been de- 
voted to individuals coming to me with stories 
they wished to read. As a rule the three less 
independent children of this group have read to- 
gether. The pages which are copies of the news- 
   
-P-A-G-E-202

papers and original stories for the loose-leaf books 
(see ‘‘Drawing and Puinting’’) are always wel- 
comed when they are sent over from the printing 
press by the Tens. No one is allowed to adda 
page to his book until he has shown his ability 
to read it. Occasionally, this means a period of 
study for the younger group. 
A set of Milton Bradley phonetic drill cards 
left on the table at the end of the month attracted 
a group of children who began practising with 
them. Later, I tried out individuals with the 
eards. The better readers, such as Grace, Fran- 
cis, and Walter needed almost no help with any 
of them. 
Mary and Douglas were slower about recogniz- 
ing the combinations. The three children who are 
the slowest readers were able to get only the 
simplest words without help. 
The work in phonics also appears under 
‘“‘Writing.’’

Language and Dramatizations 
THE PLAY CALLED ‘*THE STORY OF THE WHEAT’’ 
Its conception was really in the last week of 
January, but on account of many illnesses and ab- 
sences it was not given until March 15, although it 
could easily have been ready the last week of Feb- 
ruary. For convenience sake it has been written 
up as developing only in the month of February. 
Following our trip to Hecker’s Flour Mill, our 
discussions of the sowing, planting, and harvest- 
ing of wheat, and later our visit to Cushman’s 
Bakery, I reviewed for the children one day the 
life history of a grain of wheat. I made the story 
of the wheat as vivid and dramatic in the telling 
as I could. On finishing I said, ‘‘Who wants to be

the grain of wheat?’’ Instantly, Jenny was down 
on her knees, all curled up, representing the wheat 
seed down in the ground. Soon Helen was shining 
on her as the sun, the farmer came out wishing for 
rain, the rain fell, the wheat grew, a great machine 
came and cut it down, and it was sent to the mill. 
There was such spontaneity and pleasure in the 
dramatization that I suggested asking the Seven 
B’s to join with us and play it. The Seven B’s 
needed no urging. We showed them how far we 
had gone in the dramatization, and they went on 
and developed the story, from the time the miller 
receives the wheat until the little girl comes run- 
ning in to the bakery to buy a loaf of bread. They 
contributed also the idea of having the wheat 
brought to the miller in a barge, instead of in a 
train as we had played it. The two groups en- 
joyed working together. Conversations and parts 
were changed continually. Sarah, who had been 
very shy in the Christmas play, took the part of 
one of the wheat seeds one day and entirely for- 
got herself. As she uncurled down in the ground 
and tried to push her way out she said, ‘‘Oh, gosh, 
I wish this stone were out of the way.’’ Helen, as 
the sun shining down on the wheat, had little to 
say, so I said to her, ‘‘Perhaps you might sing a 
song of the sun.’’? She hummed a little then, and 
later she came to me with the words of her song, 
and asked me to write them. Then she made an
-P-A-G-E-208
  192 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
appointment with Miss Hubbell for a free period 
and fitted the words to music. Great interest grew 
then in writing songs for the play, until all of 
Miss Hubbell’s time was taken up. The words for 
the songs came very easily and spontaneously. 
Occasionally, the children working on them 
changed the wording as the completed verse was 
read to them. Often the first wording was suffi- 
ciently satisfactory, until the attempt was made 
to set it to music. Then the rhythm of a few of 
the lines was changed, because the child himself 
felt the difficulty involved in fitting the words as 
they were to music. Several times a child who 
wrote a verse for the play did not want to set it 
to music. But there were always other children 
who did. 
The group had been learning songs of millers, 
bakers, farmers, and wheat with Miss Hubbell and 
discussed singing these in the play.. But gradually 
so many songs were written by the children them- 
selves that only one song, not written by them, 
was used in the play. This was Christina Ros- 
setti’s ‘“Who Has Seen the Wind?’’ All of the 
original songs were learned by the whole class, 
who sang them as a chorus during the action of 
the play. 
Miss Doing, the rhythms teacher, was told of 
the play that was springing up and she allowed 
the children to play it and work at it in rhythms

periods. All of the dancing was done with bare 
feet. Sometimes each child in the class chose a 
part, playing he was the wheat unfolding down in 
the earth, the rain going pitter, patter, the wind 
blowing, the barge going with a surging motion 
across the river, the horse pulling a heavy load of 
wheat, or the bolters shaking and sifting the 
wheat. Few suggestions were given by Miss 
Doing. Most of them came from the children. 
She helped them, however, to get the feeling of the 
movement and to see the value of serious and 
steady effort. The melodies of the songs com- 
posed by the children were used as a basis for all 
the accompaniments throughout the play. 
The costuming and scenery have been described 
under ‘‘Shop’”’ and under ‘‘Drawing and Paint- 
ing.”? 
The following is an account of the play as it 
was. finally worked out, and given for the rest of 
the children in the school and for the fathers and 
mothers of the Sevens.

As the music to Rossetti’s ‘“Who Has Seen the

come blowing into the wheat-field. Trailing silken 
scarves billow behind them. They bend the wheat 
over as they swoop in and out among the growing 
wheat-stalks while the children sing:

Neither I nor you.

As the wind subsides, the farmer (Edwin) 
comes out in overalls, rubber boots, and flopping

and paws as the farmer gathers up the wheat and 
puts it in the ‘‘pretend wagon.’’ Then he drives 
the horse which now has to pull to carry the heavy 
load of wheat to the barge. Meanwhile, the chil- 
dren have been singing ‘‘The Horse’s Song.’’

A little girl (Jane) then comes skipping up to

One day of the last week in February during 
which there were only four of the group present 
(the others being excluded on account of exposure 
to mumps), I asked the children to pretend being 
the different people who help in the making of a 
loaf of bread. I wrote as each child chose his part 
and told his story. Walter was so full of the 
spirit of it that he had to be checked several times 
to give Douglas a chance. The following is the 
account which came quickly and spontaneously. 
A few ‘‘and thens’’ were eliminated from it by the 
children after hearing it read aloud. ‘‘Soon’’ was 
substituted in one place for ‘‘then.”’

them go down a chute and fall into a truck. Then

take it up into the bakery. Soon a lady comes 
along and buys three loaves for thirty-five cents.

get this good bread?’’ 
Writing 
Many letters were written to children who were 
out of school on account of the mumps or the 
*‘flu.’? Here is a letter of Sarah’s, showing what 
use she makes of punctuation. 
Dear HELEN, 
I am very sorry that you are sick. We need 
you for the sun in the play and Thursday we 
cooked Valentine cookies and you better hurry up 
otherwise you will miss your part in the play. 
Love from Saraz. 
Several of the absent children answered the let- 
ters. These answers were received with a great 
deal of pleasure. 
Letters to mothers were written, and business 
notes to the Hights, ordering supplies. There 
have been several lessons a week at the blackboard 
in order to keep up the swinging motion in writ- 
ing and to secure better form. Much of this has 
been a continuation of the phonetic writing. 
Sometimes such a word as ‘‘out’’ was written on 
the board and the children told to try different 
combinations of the letters with it and see how 
many words they could make. Sometimes each 
child chose a word to write and made as many as 
he could that were similar. Then he was asked to
-P-A-G-E-220
  204 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
read off his list or perhaps just two of the most 
interesting ones he had been able to think of. 
Occasionally, I dictated lists that contained like 
combinations and the children wrote. I kept in 
mind continually the words that were being asked 
of me in the reading and writing periods, and 
gave these and words containing the same com- 
binations. This period is always a short one of 
ten or fifteen minutes with everybody writing at 
the board and everybody concentrating on his own 
work. It has been very helpful and interesting, 
both to the children and to me, in showing up indi- 
vidual weaknesses and abilities in the formation 
of letters and combinations of letters, in speed in 
writing, and in the power of recognition of sounds 
and combinations of sounds. 
Number 
There has been an increased interest in count- 
ing. The attendance is counted by any grouping 
the child counting desires to make. There is con- 
tinual practice in counting by 3’s and 4’s. It is 
always my patience, not the children’s, that is 
taxed by the length of time taken for counting 
the attendance in the morning. There is often an 
unsatisfied child or two who has a different group- 
ing he would like to make. Because there has been 
this interest in counting, time has been taken for 
it, and children working at the board have been
-P-A-G-E-221
   THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 205 
checked as they counted up to 100 and beyond in 
various ways. Nearly all have been checked off, 
counting by 2’s, 5’s, 10’s, and many by 3’s and 
4’s. Francis and Roger have improved in their 
ability in writing numbers, and Francis, whose in- 
terest in number heretofore has been at the zero 
point, has begun writing numbers at home and 
bringing them to school. In fact, several of the 
children have been working with number at 
home. Mary brought in a paper on which she had 
counted by 9’s, 11’s, 12’s. She said 9’s were so 
easy, she had found, because the number grew 
one smaller each time as you counted up. A few 
of the children, Jenny and Sarah and Grace, have 
kept up an interest in trying to reduce the 
amount of time it takes them to work out the com- 
binations in the Thompson Minimum Essentials 
papers. They have accomplished the first paper 
in the required amount of time. Several of the 
children, including Roger, asked for one of these 
papers to work on when they were excluded from 
school a week on account of exposure to mumps. 
In keeping track of the money in our treasury 
and in paying bills there has been continual prac- 
tice in the counting of money. The children have 
enjoyed finding all sorts of different ways of 
counting to $1—by half dollars, and by quarters, 
putting nickels and dimes together in piles to 
make quarters, and by 5’s and 10’s, sometimes
-P-A-G-E-222
  206 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
putting two nickels together to make the 10, or a 
nickel and five pennies. Douglas and Walter be- 
come confused in counting, if they have been 
counting by quarters and dimes, for instance, and 
suddenly must add on nickels or pennies, so they 
are being given extra opportunity for practice. 
‘“‘Ring Toss’? has been played several times, 
each throw so far counting 5. Care has been taken 
in writing the scores on the board, to keep units 
under units and tens under tens. 
IV. Oncanization or InFoRMATION 
Discussions 
Our discussions throughout the month centered 
around the making of a loaf of bread. After we 
had visited a mill and a bakery, we discussed the 
many different people who helped in the making 
of a loaf of bread. The transporting of wheat on 
boats and trains from the farms, its storage in big 
grain elevators, the changes it went through in the 
mills until it was made into flour, its passing into 
the hands of the wholesalers, then of the retail 
groceries and its purchase by bakers, and by 
housekeepers, were the topics of interest. One 
period we made a list of the things we had dis- 
cussed that had to do with wheat: planting, har- 
vesting, weather, enemies, transportation, eleva- 
tors, mills, bakeries. Then I asked the children if
-P-A-G-E-223
THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 207 
they would like to try to find something more 
about these topics for themselves in books. They 
said, yes, they would like to go over to the library 
and find things in books there the way they had 
seen the Hights doing in their study of rubber. 
I replied that there were many books in our room 
in which information about wheat might be found 
and that before going to the library each child 
should know first exactly how to go to work in 
hunting for what he wanted in books. Copies of 
Tappan’s The Farmer and His Friends, Chamber- 
lain’s How We Are Fed, Carpenter’s How the 
World is Fed, and several geographies of Smith 
and of McMurry were given to the different chil- 
dren. Some of them immediately turned to the 
indexes. Everyone was able to find something on 
wheat, if only a picture. Each child who read 
anything needed individual help, in getting the in- 
formation except Helen. Many discussion periods 
were taken up in the preparation of the play, ‘‘The 
Story of the Wheat,’’ which is given in detail 
under ‘‘Language and Dramatizations.’’ 
Orientation 
Grace took a short trip to Florida and when she 
came back showed us on the map how she had 
gone and explained why she went by rail rather 
than by boat. She described to an eager audience 
her trip and her visit. She told us she was so 
   
-P-A-G-E-224
  208 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
fond of Florida that she cried when she had to 
come back. 
Several children had seen the moving picture of 
‘‘Hunting Big Game in Africa,’’ and they talked 
about the map of Africa which had been shown in 
the picture. We then hunted up Africa on the 
world map and on the globe, and discussed its 
direction from New York and the route we would 
take to reach there. 
Walter and Douglas, at my suggestion, together 
drew a diagram of our two school buildings show- 
ing visitors how to find their way from our class- 
room through the tunnel to the gymnasium in the 
other building. They indicated stairways and 
passages leading to the different rooms. They 
went beyond what I had suggested and showed the 
Sixth Avenue elevated road in the distance. Some 
checking up was done with the group on the loca- 
tion of the places that have been talked about over 
and over in connection with our study of food 
supplies, and with the trips various children have 
taken, or class trips. Games were played with 
maps up on the board in front of us, or down on 
the floor, until the children who had shown that 
they were not yet familiar with the location of 
certain places were able to point them out. About 
half of the class needed no help at all in finding 
all of the places about which we had talked most. 
New York, Florida, the Atlantic Ocean, Chicago,
-P-A-G-E-225
THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL = 209 
the Great Lakes, the Rocky Mountains, California, 
and the Pacific Ocean were located on the United 
States map. Then on the large map of New York 
City, Manhattan, the Hudson River, the East 
River, the New Jersey Coast, Long Island, and 
Staten Island were all pointed out. Their various 
directions also from our schoolhouse were dis- 
cussed. 
Stories 
“The Queer Little Baker Man,’’ from Bryant’s 
Stories Children Need, was read to the children 
and asked for again. ‘‘Shingebiss,’’ a Chippewa 
Indian Tale in My Bookhouse, Bk. I, also was en- 
joyed. I told several stories: ‘‘Master of All 
Masters,’’ from the Tales of Laughter, by Wig- 
gins and Smith, was asked for several times, and 
some of the phrases in it repeated with relish out 
on the playground. A South African tale, ‘‘How 
Brother Rabbit Fooled the Lion,’’ retold by Ellen 
Babbit, brought bursts of laughter and a request 
later for its retelling. ‘‘The Ogre and Jack- 
straws’’ from David Starr Jordan’s Book of 
Knight and Barbara was a favorite also. 
Science 
Mr. Meister asked the children if they would 
like to make some thermometers for their City 
houses. They answered that they would. One of 
 
-P-A-G-E-226
  ey 
210 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
them took the thermometer down from the wall 
and a discussion followed of the use of a ther- 
mometer, how to read it, and what is in it. Mr. 
Meister poured some mercury out into a glass and 
allowed each child to feel of it. Roger said, 
“‘That’s not very heavy, but only heavy for the 
little bit.” Mr. Meister told them that as mer- 
cury was very expensive they could make their 
thermometers with kerosene which had been col- 
ored with red ink. He melted the end of a glass 
tube and blew it until there was a ball at the end. 
‘When he tried to pour the red kerosene in the tube 
it would go down only a little way. The children 
said there was air in the tube that wouldn’t let 
the kerosene down. When Mr. Meister held the 
tube in his hot hand the kerosene was pushed up 
still further. Douglas said, ‘‘The hot air pushed 
itup.’? Grace added, ‘‘ Warm air spreads, pushes 
it up.’’ Mr. Meister said, ‘‘Yes, warm air 
spreads out and takes more room.’’ He then 
heated it over the flame. The children watched 
the air bubbles escape as they were pushed out. 
Then the red liquid fell to the bottom of the tube. 
The tube was closed at the top by heating it. Later 
Walter finished it up in shop by fastening it to a 
board and marking the board in the same way as 
the board of the thermometer in the laboratory 
was marked. Several of the children attempted 
thermometers later in free periods in the labora-

tory with Mr. Paley, but it was a task requiring 
rather too exact and careful work for most of the 
group. 
Later, Mr. Meister illustrated the expansion of 
heat with another experiment. He used an iron 
ball and ring. He showed the class that the ball 
exactly fitted in the ring. Then he warmed the 
ball, and the children saw that it would not go 
through the ring. When he heated the ring, how- 
ever, the ball passed through,

I. Pray Expermmnces 
The Play City 
Tue population of the Play City has been in- 
creasing almost daily. One tiny doll after another 
has been added to the families living in the houses. 
Roger is the only boy so far who has brought one, 
and his is a monkey-faced toy dressed in a fur suit. 
The children borrow it sometimes for a father. 
There are no longer enough seats in the theater to 
hold all of the inhabitants. This influx of popula- 
tion has created a new industry, that of the manu- 
facture of clothing. Formerly, this was attended 
to by individuals as they added to their families. 
But Sarah began to show such ability and apti- 
tude for dressmaking that she was appealed to 
continually. Finally, she said, ‘‘I like to make 
dresses, but I will have to charge for them. It will 
be $5 for a mother doll’s dress and $4 for a 
smaller doll’s.’? Then she began making hats and 
bonnets at $1 apiece. In almost no time she had 
presented Helen with a bill for $16, for the making 
of one mother’s dress, two children’s dresses, and 
three hats. Then Helen decided to go into busi- 
ness with her. They changed one of the rooms in 
Sarah’s butcher shop into a dressmaking shop. 
212
-P-A-G-E-229
THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 213 
They each brought quantities of scraps of silks, 
velvets, and cotton to school and allowed their 
customers choice of materials. Grace, upon see- 
ing this interesting trade spring up said: ‘‘Sarah 
is making too much money. I am going to be a 
dressmaker, too.’? Soon the shop periods saw 
most of the girls sewing away at dresses, instead 
of working on buildings. Ruth, by careful plan- 
ning, still found time to go to shop and also to 
do most of her own sewing. The dolls’ dresses 
for the most part are neat in appearance, but have 
no hems, and either no sleeves at all or kimono 
sleeves. Bills are promptly paid with toy money, 
which the children are making. Jenny began com- 
plaining that it took all of her spare time to make 
enough money to pay her bills. She has a large 
family of dolls which have to be clothed. 
The City library is adding to its collection of 
books all the time. It has received several con- 
tributions. Books have been made at home and 
donated to Mary. All of the books contained il- 
lustrations and stories, or rhymes. Mary brought 
several, in each of which was printed one of the 
songs from the Wheat play. 
As soon as my restriction on giving marionette 
shows without some previous preparation in mak- 
ing scenery and marionettes was removed, shows 
were given every period of play in the City. These 
impromptu plays were representations always of

little daily évents in the lives of the children— 
getting up in the morning, being put to bed at 
night, eating dinner, being sick, going to a party, 
and so on. A delighted audience of four or five 
ehildren never failed to attend. They were always 
accompanied by their dolls who filled the tiny 
seats of the theater. The dialogue carried on for 
the marionettes by the child giving the show, 
brought gales of laughter. The audience of dolls 
carried on its part also. Often one, impelled by 
his mother, reached across another doll to whis- 
per, or left its seat to sit by a friend. The inter- 
play between the stage and audience has been 
perhaps the most interesting part of the per- 
formance. 
The boys have brought tracks to add to the 
tracks owned by the school and have run them 
through the Pennsylvania Station. Often, some 
of the boys from the Seven B’s have joined in the 
City play and much work has been done in switch- 
ing engines and trains and in backing them up to 
the factory. So far no connection is made in the 
play between the houses and theater and the 
trains. 
Play with Big Materials 
OUTDOORS 
Many unorganized running games have devel- 
oped with the departure of the snow. Bucking

bronchos, steers, cowboys, and hunters have made 
their appearance again and again. The exciting 
play of fire engine crops up. Although the girls 
have not failed to join in these running games, 
they do not neglect the yard blocks and are faith- 
ful to their domestic dramatizations. 
Drawing and Painting 
Pictures of farmers, of wheat-fields and silos, 
and of farm machinery were painted and drawn. 
Sarah painted a picture of a mill that won for her 
the approval of all the class. Following our trip 
to the Metropolitan Tower, I suggested pictures 
with the result that many were drawn of the 
Tower or of things seen from it. Ruth distin- 
guished herself by her careful drawing of the 
Tower and of a Fifth Avenue bus. Douglas made 
an elaborate drawing of Brooklyn Bridge as it 
looked from such a height. After working at it 
awhile he asked some question about its shape, 
where it touched the shore, that no one could an- 
swer. So a picture of it was found which helped 
him out. Walter made a diagram of the Tower 
as it would look from an airplane. Grace pro- 
duced a very good drawing of an automobile going 
along Fifth Avenue. Besides these, there were 
some careful drawings of the Metropolitan itself. 
Roger continued work on a map of his farm out in 
the country which he had begun in February. He 
 
-P-A-G-E-232

took great pleasure in putting in the house and 
barn and chicken coop, grove of trees, neighbors’ 
houses, the country roads, two lakes, a brook and 
a dam, and finally added a rabbit running along 
the road. When his map was finished, it was tat- 
tered and torn. He had worked on it intermit- 
tently from February 3 to March 22, and always 
of his own accord. 
Designs and illustrations have been worked on 
for the covers of the loose-leaf dictionaries given 
each child. Illustrations of pages in the indi- 
vidual reading books also have been drawn con- 
tinually. 
II. Practica, ExPERrENcES 
Shop 
The factory and mill have been finished. They 
are equipped with elevators, derricks, and boilers. 
Walter and Francis were reported several times 
by Mr. Reber as wasting time in shop. On such oc- 
casions they were deprived of their free periods. 
Most of the girls have been so busy sewing for 
their dolls that they have done little shop work. 
Every little while, however, some one has felt the 
need of more furniture in her house or store, and 
has left her sewing. Grace made a tree for hang- 
ing up the dolls’ coats and hats, and after that hat 
trees appeared in many of the houses.

The making of doll clothes has been mentioned 
under ‘‘Play City.’’ 
Cooking 
The fruit and vegetables buried in November 
were dug up by the children, but most of them 
had been frozen and had rotted, although the hole 
had been dug two feet deep. They decided a 
greater depth would be necessary if preservation 
of fruit or vegetables were attempted again in 
that particular soil. 
1, BAKING POWDER BISCUIT 
Cooking Notes by Miss Hannum 
Some of the children suggested putting sugar 
and vanilla in the biscuit batter as they had done 
in cake, but Grace and Douglas said, ‘‘No, bis- 
cuits aren’t sweet and don’t have flavoring.’’ 
Several of them remembered that the fat was in- 
troduced by cutting it into the flour. The class 
suggested using 2 th. of fat as they had done in 
cakes and muffins. They were told that 3 or 4 tb. 
might be used so each cooking group of two used 
2, 3 or 4 th. as they wished. They decided that 
biscuit dough was thicker than cake batter so they 
would use less milk. They were cautioned to 
handle the dough as lightly as possible to insure 
good biscuits. The year before they had been 
 
-P-A-G-E-234
| an 
218 ce RieRN PRACTICE IN 
given the same instructions, but their products 
now were much superior. 
2. LEMON JELLY 
The class had asked to make lemon jelly, so it 
was suggested that they make it for the lunch 
room. The idea of cooking for all the children 
appealed to them. They were familiar with jello 
and gelatine. I explained the difference. The 
class suggested using all the ingredients, but I 
gave the proportions, as I wished to emphasize 
that accurate directions must be followed. They 
wished to add fruit and did so, using bananas 
scraped, and oranges. The next day they took 
great pride in telling the children who came in to 
lunch that they had made the dessert. 
3. GINGERBREAD MEN FROM HOT WATER GINGERBREAD 
First, the children were asked why gingerbread 
was brown in color, and when molasses was given 
as the reason, they were asked what they used 
with molasses to make the cakes rise. They all 
said, ‘‘Soda.’? The class said that molasses 
would take the place of sugar, and decided to use 
the same amount of this as they had used of sugar 
in plain cake. Then the amounts of egg, crisco, 
flour, and soda were based on former recipes. The 
children spoke of using the same amount of liquid 
 
-P-A-G-E-235
THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL = 219 
as they had used previously. I said, ‘‘Is there 
anything else in the gingerbread that is liquid?’’ 
Class: ‘‘Molasses.’’? Then I asked, ‘‘What do 
you think about the amount of hot water we had 
better use?’? The Class decided to measure % c. 
of water and use only as much as they thought 
they needed. To make the gingerbread men they 
made the batter thicker, and shaped the figures as 
they would in clay modeling. 
Clay 
Miss Levin has made a report on the work which 
the Seven A’s have done with her. They have 
had discussions about the different kinds of clay 
and where it came from. Miss Levin told the class 
the clay they were using was earthenware clay, 
that it was made by the crumbling of rocks, which 
were carried down mountain streams and mixed 
with sand and shells, and that it settled to the 
bottom of lakes. She told them our porcelain 
dishes are made from a clay, called Kaolin, which 
has never been carried by mountain streams or 
mixed with sand and shells. They talked of the 
different colored clays: that which turned red or 
orange after firing showed it contained iron, and 
that which came out of the kiln white had carbon 
in it, as it contained a quantity of decayed plants. 
When someone asked what the glazes were made 
of, Miss Levin explained that glaze was ground

Notes by Miss Levin 
HABITS OF WORK OF DIFFERENT CHILDREN 
Sarah—Has developed a good technique, work- 
ing with great interest, independence, and con- 
centration, displaying nice little ideas of her own, 
although she is not so imaginative as others of the 
group. She has made a statue of a man for one of 
the parks of the Play City, a bowl, an ash tray, 
and a pin tray. 
Dorothy—Imaginative but flighty—has not con- 
centrated on her work. She has made a little 
jewel box with a fitted lid. 
Francis—Has seldom chosen to work with clay, 
so his technique has not developed, but his habits 
of work have been excellent. He has made a boat 
and a shark with a tail lifted high and bent over. 
Mary—Very good craftsman—true instinct for 
beauty, sense of shape, good in designing; has 
made square box with fitted lid. 
Walter—Has skill, finds it hard to settle down 
to work. Made a cobra. 
Douglas—A dreamer, but with good technique, 
very independent; seldom chose clay, but worked 
constantly when he did. Modeled a lion. 
Ruth—Artistic, knows exactly what she wants 
to make. Made a humorous model of a dog and 
insisted on having it white with brown spots. 
 
-P-A-G-E-237

Jenny—No concentration; made a candlestick. 
Grace—Independent, with a high opinion of her 
own ability; capricious, makes ordinary little 
things—bowls, candlesticks. 
Helen—Imaginative, persevering; has made 
little rabbits and squirrels for the Play City 
parks. 
Roger—Has not chosen clay at all. 
TI. Sprout Trawine 
Reading 
Roger has surged ahead of the weaker group in 
reading. He has gained enough independence to 
be able to read the Baker and Thorndike First 
Reader with little help. The phonetic writing at 
the board and some drill with phonetic flash cards 
have helped him in his recognition of new words. 
Jenny and Dorothy were not able to study the 
Baker and Thorndike First Reader independently, 
so they were given primers to read in place of it. 
An old copy of the Aldine Primer made Dorothy 
very happy when she found she could read it with 
ease and rapidity and without asking for assis- 
tance. She said over and over that she loved it. 
She has had some unhappy moments, when she 
has been required to study independently any- 
thing which she considered difficult, even though 
it seemed well within her grasp. Jenny does not 
have this aversion to digging out things by her- 
self, but her span of attention is short.
-P-A-G-E-238
222 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
The stronger group have been gaining steadily 
every day in their habits of intelligent concen- 
trated study. Most of the half-hour reading time 
has been a silent study period, in which I have 
paid especial attention to the less independent 
workers. The silent period is always broken into 
by two or three children asking to read some in- 
teresting part they have come to in a book, or to 
tell a story which has especially pleased them. All 
of them read in their natural speaking voices. 
Francis, who was reading the Hiawatha Primer, 
wanted to read the part beginning with ‘‘Saw the 
rainbow’’ to the class, but as he read in a very 
low voice and with little expression, he was not 
able to hold the attention of several of the chil- 
dren. He made a second, better attempt, but 
Ruth’s attention wandered. Then I read it, to 
help him see how he might gain even uninterested 
Ruth’s attention. The class clamored for more 
of the poem. I went on with it, as three or four 
children were reading it by themselves, and I felt 
that they needed help in getting the beauty and 
meaning of the story. Ruth attempted to read 
Mewanee and was fascinated by the long dif- 
ficult words in it and her ability to puzzle them 
out, but she was not able to get much of the con- 
tent. So that was taken away from her and 
Arabella and Araminia substituted. The sim- 
ple details of the lives of these two small girls
-P-A-G-E-239
  
THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 223 
have furnished entire satisfaction to her, and the 
class has given her their undivided attention when 
she has read to them or told them parts of the 
story. Most of the other members of Ruth’s 
group are more ready for reading matter contain- 
ing content than she is at present, although she 
has gained greater facility than nearly all of them 
in reading. The Francis Parker Second Grade 
Leaflets on old mills, threshing, corn-husking, and 
so forth, have been read by the group. Study 
periods were given first, and then each child al- 
lowed to read or tell to the class the most interest- 
ing part of his leaflet. Roger, in spite of reading 
with greater difficulty, was able to tell more about 
the few lines he read than Ruth who had read 
several pages. We have discontinued our sub- 
scription to the newspaper printed in large type 
by the Elevens, as we no longer feel the need of 
one. The printed copies of original stories and 
verse, and accounts of group activities for the 
ioose-leaf note-books have furnished all the mate- 
rial necessary aside from the reading of books. 
There has been a small amount of time taken 
with the whole class for rapid drill with combina- 
tions of sounds. More individual work has been 
done with the children who apparently needed it. 
These children have worked with phonetic drill 
cards in groups, by themselves, or with me. A 
short drill in phonetic writing at the board hag 
 
-P-A-G-E-240
  224. EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
been continued day after day. This has greatly 
increased ability in spelling, and has helped in 
recognition of new words containing familiar com- 
binations of sounds. 
Language, Writing, Spelling 
Some of the children had started writing stories 
for themselves in January, but during February 
there was no especial interest in it, partly on ac- 
count of so much else to be accomplished. But 
now the interest in story writing took a sudden 
leap. Some of the children brought composition 
books from home like Helen’s, which she had 
started in January. Others wrote on sheets of 
paper and bound these together by sewing them 
or putting colored covers on, punching holes, and 
then tying them with colored thread. Many of the 
covers and stories were illustrated. The girls led 
in the enthusiasm for story writing. Walter and 
Roger evinced small interest. Roger’s form has 
much improved, due to practice at the board, but 
he still finds writing a task rather than a pleasure. 
Many of the stories have been of personal experi- 
ences, trips, accounts of birthday parties, of play- 
ing at home, of the Play City at school; there were 
imaginative stories, too, of blind people, or poor 
people who were made happy through some kind 
action. Several were imaginative stories where 
everybody died. Helen wrote again about our
-P-A-G-E-241
  THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL = 225 
trip to the Woolworth Tower. During the ‘‘free 
writing’’ period, as it was called, when it was not 
necessary to write orders for supplies or letters, 
I spent my time spelling words asked for, over- 
looking stories as they were being written, and 
giving some simple suggestions as to punctuation 
and capitalization. 
Following are some of these uncorrected 
stories:

Dear Gordon, My school is almost finished. We 
are going to give a play. Love from 
Roger. 
Each child was given a small indexed loose-leaf 
note-book, 7 x 8% inches, containing pages of our 
regular wide-spaced writing paper. Any word 
which a child asked how to spell was to be written 
in this ‘‘dictionary’’ by the child. In this way he 
was given the opportunity of keeping account of 
the words he wished to be able to use in writing. 
These dictionaries were received with pleasure 
and there has been careful writing in them. Ruth 
began to worry, however, for fear she would not 
be able to find many words to put inhers. She has 
had such intense interest in written symbols, that 
she has learned to spell nearly all of the words 
she ever wishes to use in writing. She grew to 
watch for ‘‘hard’’ words written on the board by 
me for the other children, and to write them in 
her dictionary. 
Writing at the board has helped Roger and 
Ruth to improve their form very much. Interest 
has continued in their phonetic writing and there 
has been great gain in ability. Sometimes the
-P-A-G-E-244
  
  228 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
whole class has written columns of words contain- 
ing the same combinations of sounds, and some- 
times each child makes up a list of words 
containing different combinations. The combina- 
tions, such as at, ed, ell, am, an, ou, ow, ing, ate, er, 
ur, ir, which are met with constantly, have been 
worked with most. 
Number 
The cost of the play was computed, the price of 
the cheesecloth, burlap, muslin, silver and gold 
paint, and gold paper being summed up. Some of 
the children are beginning to be able to add 
columns of figures in which carrying is involved. 
They have watched me during the year as I wrote 
on the board the items from the bills presented us 
by the Eights for school supplies, and have per- 
formed the operations in addition with me, except 
that until now I have done the carrying of num- 
bers from one column to another. They have seen 
that the answers secured agreed with the amount 
of money we have counted out and paid the Kights 
upon their demand. 
Through Grace’s dissatisfaction with the way 
in which she was to be paid for the rental of her 
theater, a discussion of money came about. Mary 
turned to me and said, ‘‘Well, how did they ever 
get the first money?’’ Then we talked of trading 
and exchange, of Indian wampum belts, of the use 
 
-P-A-G-E-245
     THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL = 229 
of precious metals, of banks, and of the checking 
system. 
Checking up in the telling of time, and in the 
counting of money, and the reading and writing 
of number has continued. There is also an ac- 
count of the children’s use of money under ‘‘The 
Play City.’’ 
IV. Orcanization or Inrormation 
Discussion 
From talking about all of the things we could 
think of that were made out of wheat seeds, the 
discussion went on to what foods were made from 
other seeds. Pantry shelves were searched at 
home for food made from seeds, and samples were 
brought to school. There were whole-wheat flour, 
white flour, a slice of bread, shredded wheat, Rals- 
ton Breakfast Food, Germea, Rolled Oats, rice, 
Puffed Rice, corn-meal, Karo Corn Syrup, corn 
flakes, molasses, mustard, salad oil. Finally, one 
day Ruth brought a stalk of celery. When the 
children said celery was not made out of a seed, 
Ruth replied, ‘‘ Well, it comes from a seed.’’ Then 
there was great interest in tracing other kinds of 
food to their sources—milk, meat, vegetables, and 
fruits. Douglas said, ‘‘Meat does not come from 
a seed; it comes from a cow.”’ But after thinking 
it over, he knew as all of the other children seemed 
to, that the cow had first been a calf, and before it
-P-A-G-E-246
  230 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
was a calf it had been a sort of seed inside of its 
mother. The conclusion was reached that every 
kind of food comes from a seed. 
Grace (remembering the life history of sugar 
from the Christmas play) said: ‘‘Sugar does not 
come from a seed. The stalks of sugar cane are 
cut in pieces and planted.’ I told her that was 
the quickest and best way of planting on sugar 
plantations, but that the first stalks had sprouted 
from seeds. 
Later, the children told of the corn-fields they 
knew about, and the silos they had seen. The 
planting, harvesting, and storing of corn was dis- 
eussed. National Geographic pictures were 
looked over. Corn was ground in our coffee mill 
into corn meal. A list of things which are made 
from corn was written on the board—corn-meal, 
cereals, starch, oil to burn, oil to cook with, oil to 
make soap, mattresses made from husks, paper 
made from the outside of the stalk. Under ‘‘Read- 
ing,’’ I have told of the interest in the Francis 
Parker Leaflets on wheat and corn. 
Some of the children had also seen rice growing, 
and told about it, and pictures were shown of rice 
growing in different countries. We received some 
slides from the Museum of Natural History on 
“Some Sources of Our Food Supply’’ and, after 
looking them over and listening to the accompany- 
ing written descriptions, different children volun- 
 
-P-A-G-E-247
  
THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL ~ 231 
teered to tell about the corn and wheat in the 
assembly with the Seven B’s. The slides on 
wheat showed: 
1. What the wheat plant is like and its distri- 
bution as a cultivated crop. 
2. Preparing the soil and sowing the wheat. 
3. Harvesting and marketing the crop. 
Those on corn were very similar. The pictures 
thrown on the screen excited so much interest 
from the audience that the appointed lecturers 
were by no means the only speakers. Much infor- 
mation was added by the audience and many 
questions asked. Everyone seemed to feel this 
was a subject on which he was well fitted to speak. 
We had a Polyphemus moth come out of its 
cocoon on March 7. Its crumpled wings and lovely 
colors and, later, the laying of eggs occasioned 
much interest. This led to conversation about the 
life history of butterflies and moths. (See also 
discussion of Money under ‘‘Number.’’) 
Trips 
Metropolitan Tower. 
Orientation 
Africa continued to be a place of interest to the 
group. The picture of ‘‘Hunting Big Game in  
-P-A-G-E-248
  232 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
Africa’’ had made a deep impression on the chil- 
dren who had seen it. Roger especially, continued 
to talk of it and to wonder where in Africa the 
Ford car replenished its gasoline. Everyone was 
interested in the discussion and pictures of the 
African ways of planting and harvesting wheat 
with rude wooden sticks and plows hitched to 
camels, and in their method of crushing wheat in 
hand mills. Ruth brought coffee from home which 
she said came from Brazil, and she showed the 
class where Brazil was on the world-map. 
A map showing the countries where wheat and 
corn are produced, was thrown on the screen dur- 
ing our Assembly on the sources of food supply, 
and different children were eager to point out and 
name the various countries growing wheat. 
Stories 
“The Story of the Caterpillar’? by Katharine 
Pyle was read from My Bookhouse, Vol. I, after 
the Polyphemus had come out of its cocoon. The 
story of Ulysses and Polyphemus told from 
Palmer’s Odyssey held an audience which de- 
manded more stories of Ulysses. I told part of 
Oscar Wilde’s story of ‘‘The Selfish Giant’’ and 
“The Little Rabbit Who Wanted Red Wings,’’ by 
Bailey. Mary said, ‘‘I like the stories you tell 
better than the ones you read.’? Some of W. T. 
Hopkin’s stories were told and ‘‘The Whole
-P-A-G-E-249
  THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 233 
Wheat Story,’’ from his Farm Stories, was read. 
Both Helen and Sarah liked it so much they asked 
for the book to take home and read. Later, Sarah 
told ‘‘The Baking Story’’ from the same book. 
“‘The Corn Story’? by Hopkins, adapted in the 
Riverside Third Reader, was also read. The 
“Feast of Mondamin,’’ from Hiawatha, was 
partly told and partly read, causing much ques- 
tioning and interest from the group. 
Some spring verse was read from the collec- 
tions of poetry in the room. After I had read 
Wordsworth’s ‘‘March,’’ I asked the children 
what pictures they saw during the reading. Doro- 
thy said, ‘‘I saw myself on my pogo stick out in 
the country getting hotter and hotter.’’ Roger: 
**T liked the picture of the lake best because I like 
to swim.’’ Ruth: ‘‘I saw us playing out in our 
City with the boats going up and down.’’ (They 
had wanted to take their houses out and play that 
day, but it had been too cold.) Other children 
spoke of the pleasant pictures of cattle grazing 
and of the plowing. 
Science 
Illustrating the use of the siphon and showing 
how a city gets its water supply, Mr. Meister told 
the group of the tremendous pipe which brings 
our water to us from the Catskills, and how it 
must come over a mountain and under a river. 
   
-P-A-G-E-250
  234 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE 
He said: ‘‘I will show you how it comes. Pre- 
tend this trough is the pipe bringing water to the 
city. This high bench is the’ mountain, and the 
bottle on the floor is the reservoir in the city 
where we want to take the water.’’ He connected 
a tube from the trough down to the bottle on the 
floor. The water did not begin to flow. Mr. Meis- 
ter: ‘‘Would you expect it to?’’? Children: ‘‘No, 
it won’t go up over the mountain.’’ Dorothy: 
*‘You’ll have to have a pump or a squirter.’’? Mr. 
Meister then sucked the end of the rubber tubing, 
and the water started to flow and finally filled the 
bottle. Each child then performed the experiment 
for himself with his own apparatus. They all had 
difficulty at first because they set their bottles up 
on the bench higher than the water in the trough. 
Douglas finally put his down lower than the 
trough, and the water began to flow. 
Another day each child worked with two bottles 
and rubber tubing, finding that he could not make 
water run from a low level to a high one, but that 
he could from a high to a low one, and discovering 
that the water would not rise higher than its own 
level.

The Play City 
Tnx laying out of the City in the yard has been 
going steadily forward. Durable tracks of wood 
have been laid for the electric train on the New 
Jersey side. Brass strips, to allow for the pass- 
age of the electric current, have been nailed on to 
the wooden tracks. The boys brought all their 
electric trains and engines from home and began 
to feel that the railroads belonged to them. A 
great deal of dirt and gravel had to be removed 
from the side of tracks and was hauled in the coal 
ears of the trains. Not one of the girls had any 
electric trains at home and they were quite ready 
to accept the boys’ attitude of excluding them 
from the laying of the tracks and cross ties, and 
the play with engines. Mr. Paley, who superin- 
tended the track building, was able to counteract 
this feeling, to some extent, by declining the con- 
tinual offers of services from the boys, and invit- 
ing the girls to help. 
After some discussions and work with the map 
of Manhattan, which appear in detail under 
*‘Orientation,’? we went out into the City yard 
235
-P-A-G-E-252
  236 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
and decided on the locations of the most impor- 
tant streets and buildings in our City. Washing- 
ton Square Arch and Fifth Avenue were decided 
upon first. Stakes were driven and cord stretched 
tight along Fifth Avenue. Then came Grand Cen- 
tral Station and the Public Library on Forty- 
second Street. As the surveying continued, each 
child who had a building for the street staked out 
brought his building and located it properly. 
Sarah said to Ruth, ‘‘Ruth, are you going to 
live on the New Jersey side or the New York side 
of the river?’’ Ruth replied, ‘‘On the New York 
side because I’Il earn more money there.”’ 
Everyone understood it was possible only to 
approximate distances and locations. 
There was much greater leeway allowed in the 
placing of the buildings on the New Jersey side. 
We all agreed that the boys should place their 
factories and mills along the edge of the river, 
wherever they could make the best connection 
with the trains. Helen placed her country house 
at a safe distance away from the river, ‘‘on ac- 
count of the children,’’ she said, and the farm was 
placed still farther inland. 
The work in surveying and the placing of the 
City buildings continued day after day. There 
was also a great deal of work to be done in clean- 
ing the yard and the cement river bed. But hardly 
had Grace’s theater been located when it was
-P-A-G-E-253
  THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 237 
opened up for a show and most of the citizens 
dropped their work to attend. Douglas and Roger 
kept on steadily with their sweeping of the 
cement river bed. They said, ‘‘We should be paid 
for this by the City.’’ Jenny, overhearing them, 
answered, ‘‘We must have taxes.’’ How the chil- 
dren attacked the question of keeping the City 
clean appears under ‘‘Discussion.’’ 
Play With Big Materials 
OUTDOORS 
There has been a renewed interest in play with 
the apparatus in the yard. The slide, swinging 
rope and ladder have been used constantly. Ruth, 
who has been gaining in control during the year, 
has been attempting much harder feats all the 
time. She has been climbing the ten-foot ladder 
in the big yard, and sliding down on the swinging 
rope. Most of the girls have spent part of their 
play periods jumping rope. 
There has been a great deal of horse racing and 
playing cowboys and Indians, when the two 
groups of Sevens have played together. Ruth 
seldom has cared to join in this play, which is 
always organized by the boys and is apt at times 
to become rough. Helen, Jenny, and Grace have 
joined in it enthusiastically, however. Sarah and 
Dorothy have found their greatest delight in 
domestic play, building different rooms with the

outdoor blocks and planning to continue the play 
after school. 
Drawing and Painting 
Most of the painting and drawing this month 
has been illustrative. With the enthusiasm for 
making small books of written stories, crayons 
have been used almost constantly. Illustrations 
have beautified the covers, the beginnings of 
stories, the middles and the ends. Trains of cars, 
boats, barges, scows, derricks, giant shovels, City 
buildings and houses, rivers, mountains and trees 
have been drawn, and some pictures of children. 
Roger, who was drawing trains, asked if I did not 
have a picture of a train for him to look at. So 
I hunted up The Railroad Book by E. Boyd Smith 
for him. Some of the furniture for the houses has 
been made interesting by the decorations on 
chairs, tables, and beds. Dorothy made a 
paper screen, with a nice design on it for her 
house. Ruth repainted her house and decorated 
the outside walls with wavering lines of a darker 
color.

Shop 
Ruth and Helen have had much joy all the year 
in working in the shop and have shown the great- 
est industry. Consequently, they have become the
-P-A-G-E-255

largest property owners in the City, possessing 
together a country house, an apartment building 
containing a hardware store, dressmaker’s shop, 
and living quarters, a drug store, and a station at 
the docks. This station was a one-story building 
at first, but later they enlarged it to two stories, so 
that it might have a lunch room. They have made 
furniture for all of their buildings. Sarah 
changed the top floor of the building in which her 
butcher shop is located into a dressmaker’s shop. 
She put up a bar on which to hang her gowns and 
made several little coat hangers. Douglas has 
started making a dock for the New York side of 
the harbor, and Grace made the Washington 
Square Arch. Several of the children have cut 
trees out of wood with the jig-saw, and have put 
them on standards and painted them green. 
These are for the parks. 
Cooking

Reading 
The half-hour reading period has become one of 
concentrated study for nearly every one. Jenny 
and Dorothy have attained only to the power of 
reading primers independently, but they are read- 
ing more rapidly and with greater enjoyment all
-P-A-G-E-256
  240 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
the time. Jenny, if she is unable to get anyone 
else to appreciate a story with her, laughs over it 
and enjoys it by herself. When Jenny and Doro- 
thy have read anything of first-reader difficulty, 
they have needed help with many of the new 
words. I have taken odd moments for work with 
them in phonetics. Phonetic writing at the board 
has continued two or three times a week for the 
whole class. Roger has put forth steadily increas- 
ing intelligent effort, and has insisted on 
“tharder’’ books! He has read some of the stories 
in the Here and Now Story Book and has started 
on Red Feather. 
The reading period has become a very popular 
one. Such expressions as ‘‘I love to read,’’ from 
Walter, or ‘‘Oh boy!’ from Douglas, are elicited 
sometimes when reading time has come. Walter, 
reading the Baker and Thorndike First Reader, 
said, ‘‘I like the ‘Brave Blackbird’ in this so much 
I’m going to read it again.’? Mary also read it 
twice saying, ‘‘It is so good!’’ Walter told the 
story of it to the children with some uninvited 
help from Mary, and held his audience through- 
out. Then Grace said she had reached such a good 
part in Five Little Friends—could she tell it? 
Helen and Sarah, who have also enjoyed this little 
book very much, amplified parts of the story as 
Grace told it. Grace, after enjoying Bow-wow 
and Mew-mew, refused Arabella and Araminta
-P-A-G-E-257
  THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 241 
saying, ‘‘It’s too much alike. Arabella picks one 
flower, then Araminta picks one.’’ 
Sarah upon finishing the Letiers from a Cat 
said: ‘‘This is awfully good! It’s sad.’? Helen 
and Sarah often took books home to read, but have 
chosen sewing or working in shop many times dur- 
ing the reading period at school. 
Francis was so thrilled with the Tree Dwellers, 
that he often interrupted the reading period with, 
“This is very exciting here!’’, or ‘‘Listen to 
this.’? His enjoyment of the book influenced 
Douglas to such a degree, that he waited with 
great impatience for Francis to finish it. Francis’ 
joy was great when he found there was another 
book, The Earlier Cave Men, following this, and 
he began reading it with eagerness. 
Writing, Language 
Half an hour continued to be given three or 
four times a week to the ‘‘free writing’’ period, 
which most of the children greeted with enthus- 
jiasm. Francis, Walter, and Roger had some of 
the most interesting things to write, but, on ac- 
count of the greater difficulty with which they 
wrote, were not so eager for the period. Nearly 
all the stories were illustrated. Many of them 
were made into booklets. After the assembly on 
‘How Our City is Kept Clean,’’ Douglas wrote 
on what is done with our ashes, and Ruth wrote a
-P-A-G-E-258
  242 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
little lecture on what to do with orange peelings. 
Greater use has been made of punctuation marks 
and capitals, although much improvement is still 
needed. The reading aloud of stories as soon as 
they were finished brought much gratification to 
the authors, and sometimes proved stimulating to 
the audience. 
Some of the stories written in April are given 
below. 
Don’t throw orange peelings in the street, or 
any old rubbish or garbage. All rubbish and gar- 
bage go way over to Brooklyn in big high build- 
ings. The belt is eighty feet long. There is a 
great enormous furnace. What stuff that escapes 
from the mens hands goes in a furnace a great big 
one indeed. 
the end. 
Rots. 
Ruth has been the most prolific writer all the 
year. In her stories she has often used informa- 
tion she has gained; for instance, she made up a 
story about the Majestic and said, ‘‘It was the 
biggest boat in the world.’’ Her written language 
has shown the same quaint strain as her speech. 
She wrote: ‘‘Once there was a little Girl. She 
had no parents. She soon got tired of no 
parents.’’ The little girl finally found a very 
satisfactory parent who answered her with an, 
‘*All right oh,’’ when she asked to go out of doors. 
In another one, she wrote of a little girl that she 
 
-P-A-G-E-259

was ‘‘full of tears.’? She wrote quite a complete 
account of our City. 
We have a city. We are making a dock. Doug- 
las and Francis are doing it. Sarah has changed 
her butcher shop into a dress making shop. Helen 
has a country house a drug store, and a dress- 
maker’s shop. Mary has a library. Walter has 
a train factory. Douglas has Heckers Flour Mill 
and the Pennsylvania Hotel. Grace has a theater 
a private house a dressmaker’s shop. We have 
great fun there. The end.

Ayres’ Measuring Scale for Handwriting was 
thumb-tacked on the wall and caused some inter- 
est and discussion of skill and care in writing. A 
few of the children consulted it by themselves dur- 
ing successive days to see if their writing had 
improved. 
Spelling 
Each child gave me a list of the words he had in 
his dictionary under a, b, c, ete. I put these to-
-P-A-G-E-261
  THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL = 248 
gether in my dictionary, so that I had a list of the 
words the different members of the class had 
shown a need of knowing how to spell, since the 
end of February. Then I proposed that it would 
be interesting and might prove very useful if each 
child could have this list also, eliminating words 
that were too difficult or unusual. We began defi- 
nitely to learn the words from our dictionaries. 
These were supplemented by ones from a list 
made by the Second Grade at The Lincoln School. 
One day all the words under a were taken, then 
under 0, et cetera. I wrote one at a time very 
carefully on the board and the class copied care- 
fully—the tall letters filling the space on the wide- 
spaced paper, and the small letters half of that 
space. As we wrote, we discussed the words— 
sometimes the places where the words had been 
used, as with write, right, and their, there. We 
also talked about certain parts of the words it 
would be well to remember, as ar, on, al, ch, ing. 
‘As a word was written, each child closed his eyes 
to get the picture of it. Sometimes they were 
checked up orally, to see if the picture was cor- 
rect. Sometimes we went on immediately to the 
next word. Certain words were left to the choice 
of individuals to include in their lists, Ruth and 
Helen insisting always on having every one. A 
short period for silent study followed for those 
who seemed to need it. Ruth and Francis did not
-P-A-G-E-262
246 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
display any need of this period. The children 
then worked together in couples, checking each 
other orally in the spelling. Ifa child misspelled 
a word, he wrote it three times on the board cor- 
rectly, and then spelled it to me. Jenny and 
Dorothy needed the most help. 
Number 
Some of the children reported counting the 
money in their mothers’ purses at home. It was 
necessary, occasionally, to count the money in our 
treasury at school, and often bills must be paid. 
Sometimes the children asked to play store. One 
child would be storekeeper and different children 
would come to him and ask for a loaf of bread, a 
can of peas, or bacon. They would pay him with 
a dollar bill or fifty cents. He would then hand 
over the package and count the change on from 
the price of the purchase, in regular storekeeper 
fashion. 
Everybody has made toy money for use in the 
Play City. Jenny was worrying about the kind 
of money she had made. She said, ‘‘I’ll not have 
enough five cent pieces to get in the subway.’’ 
Helen comforted her with, ‘‘Well you could 
change five pennies for it or get change for a 
dime.’? 
Two new games of combinations were intro- 
duced which the children took to eagerly. ‘‘Slap
-P-A-G-E-263
     THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 247 
Jack’? caused much fun and excitement for a 
while, and helped to add interest in knowing the 
combinations. Out of a pack of cards on which 
were printed all the possible combinations under 
12, certain cards were decided upon each time to 
be used as ‘‘Slap Jacks.’’ For instance any card 
containing a combination of 11 might be chosen 
to be slapped in the game as 
Br 6 Aa ak 7 
Be sbee PR Iee 7p Qk 
a 
The person slapping the given card then won all 
of the cards out on the table. The child gaining 
the most cards became the winner. ‘‘Meow,’’ a 
game of matching combinations and answers, be- 
came very popular also and was asked for day 
after day for a time. 
We have had a drill on the board and on paper 
on combinations and on combinations with the 
same ending—as 
2 22 32

TBS ADS 35° 
Mary, Sarah, Jenny, Ruth, and Helen have kept 
up their interest in reducing the amount of time 
in which they can write the answers on a page of 
combinations. They took papers of combinations 
home and worked on them. Sometimes they made
-P-A-G-E-264
  248 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
up their own pages of combinations. Mary said, 
‘“The way I know 9 plus 7 = 16, I take 1 off of the 
7 and make it 6, and put it on the 9 and make it 
10. So that makes 10 plus 6.’? She has overcome 
this cumbersome method, however; by the drills 
she has given herself. 
IV. Orcanization oF Inrormation 
Discussion 
As the City grew, different questions as to city 
management sprang up. We took up the question 
of how New York City keeps clean. We discussed 
street cleaning and the disposal of garbage, rub- 
bish, ashes, and sewage. All of these topics 
proved of great interest and the children went 
home and discussed the same things there. The 
building up of Riker’s Island with ashes, and 
the way in which soap fat is secured from the 
cooking of garbage by steam, were two points of 
greatest interest. Pictures and stories appeared 
concerning these things. We gave an assembly 
to the Seven B’s in which we led the discussions, 
but they joined in with as much enthusiasm. 
Roger illustrated his talk with a picture showing 
the unloading of ashes from a scow at Riker’s 
Island. Douglas drew a tug pulling a scow which 
was loaded with ashes. Dorothy’s drawing 
showed a great vat in which garbage was being 
stewed, and a man standing near to attend to it.
-P-A-G-E-265
THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL = 249 
Sarah had a picture of a woman with a baby try- 
ing to cross the street, while a policeman held up 
his hand to stop the traffic. Mary drew a row of 
houses facing a city street. 
We also discussed our two great terminal sta- 
tions. The National Geographic Magazine, April, 
1923, had an article by William Joseph Showalter 
on ‘‘ America’s Amazing Railway Traffic,’’ which 
gave much illuminating material. Some pictures 
of wonderful bridges, of the first engines, and of 
the largest engine in the world were of great in- 
terest. The comparison of the power of electric 
and steam engines provoked questions and ani- 
mated discussion. 
Trips 
Lackawanna Station in Jersey City. 
Orientation 
In order to lay out our City properly, we located 
on the large map of Manhattan the places we were 
to have in the City—Central Park, Washington 
Square Arch, our schoolhouse, ete. Every one 
then practiced drawing the outline of Manhattan 
and placed these various structures where they 
belonged. Some of these maps were finished up 
in a picturesque fashion with green grass and blue 
lakes in the parks, and smoke coming out of the 
chimneys of the houses. Instead of drawing Man-
-P-A-G-E-266
  250 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
hattan, Sarah insisted on drawing our Play City 
as it would look with the houses in it. After she 
had done that, however, she consented to draw 
Manhattan and put in the same houses. Sarah 
and Dorothy have shown the least interest and 
ability in map drawing, and have not a well-devel- 
oped sense of direction. 
After we had made these outlines or diagrams, 
we then proceeded to lay out our Play City. This 
account appears under ‘‘The Play City.’’ 
A trip was taken across the Hudson to Jersey 
City. There the children saw the trains coming 
into the Lackawanna Station from further inland. 
They also saw many wagons waiting with their 
produce for a chance to ferry across to New York. 
In the river they saw the usual number of barges 
carrying freight cars to the city. 
Stories 
Dorothy brought the Rootabaga Stories, by 
Carl Sandburg, to school and I read one or two to 
the children, who apparently had great fun out of 
them. Then we began the story of Kart the Ele- 
phant, by Mukerji, and it proved very popular. 
I read some spring verse—Thomas Nash’s 
‘‘Birds in Spring,’’ and Shakespeare’s ‘‘Under a 
‘‘Greenwood Tree.’? Later, when Mrs. Mitchell 
came in, Dorothy asked her to read ‘‘Birds in 
Spring’’ because I had said she could make the

bird calls sound more like real birds. They all 
enjoyed the ‘‘Cuckoo, jug-jug, pu-we, tu-witta- 
woo!’’ of the verse.

City with Mr. Paley’s assistance has been men- 
tioned under ‘‘Play Experiences.’’

I, Pray Experiences 
The Play City 
Francis, who had charge of the farm, superin- 
tended the loosening of the soil and the planting 
of grass seed all over that part of the yard desig- 
nated as the country, in order to give it a real 
look of the country. The children painted signs, 
‘Keep Off,’’ and enclosed that section by putting 
up stakes and strings. When the grass began to 
show green, several of the girls moved their 
houses out there and could not be persuaded to 
move back into the City, although by staying in 
the country they would have to forego electric 
lights. Some wooden toy animals were brought 
from home by different children and a few were 
found that had been made at school the year be- 
fore. These were placed in the stalls in the barn, 
and out in the meadows. 
Douglas and Francis ran trucks out to the farm. 
Roger ran a truck up Fifth Avenue. Boats sailed 
up and down the river going, ‘‘Toot, toot, ch ch ch, 
too too—get a gang plank. Anyone want a ride? 
Here’s a steamer.’? Sometimes toy automobiles 
were carried on boats and lifted up to the factory 
by derrick. The electric trains ran, taking pas- 
25224 
 
-P-A-G-E-269
THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 253 
sengers. The electric road needed repair work 
done on it up to the last, as the first brass strips 
employed had not been of sufficient weight, and 
each rain that came caused them to curl up and 
split. The boys, especially Douglas, continued to 
show much more interest in working on the track 
than the girls. This was undoubtedly due to in- 
terests which had their inception at home with the 
boys and had not been developed with the girls. 
Many parties and shows were given for the dolls 
and long dialogues were carried on for them by 
their mothers. 
Each child wired his house or store and then 
made connections with the wires which had 
been placed underground. Some of the lights re- 
fused to work, as certain nails in the circuit had 
become rusty. When new nails were put in, the 
lights came on. 
The children whitewashed paths to represent 
the sidewalks along Fifth Avenue, Forty-second 
and Thirty-fourth Streets, but these did not prove 
satisfactory as each rain washed them away. 
During a joint meeting of the two groups of 
Sevens in which the necessary work of a city was 
discussed, the different children told what their 
duties already were, or chose what responsibilities 
they would assume. We had Street Cleaners, 
‘Waterways Superintendents, Electric Supervis- 
ors, Postmaster, Bakers, Elevator Inspector,
-P-A-G-E-270
  
  254 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
Boatmen, Farmer, Grocer, Butcher, Banker, 
Dressmakers, Druggist, Librarian, Hotel Man- 
ager, Manager of Offices. Everyone set out to 
make a badge signifying his position. Wooden 
badges fastened on with clamps and safety pins 
were made in the shop. There were also ribbon 
badges, paper badges, and cloth badges. The chil- 
dren took up their chosen duties with diligence, 
which in the case of some of them relaxed after a 
time. The Waterways Superintendents—Ross 
and James from the Seven B’s—were the most 
faithful. They brought in some rules which they 
had thought out together and typed, and which 
were accepted by vote by our group. 
CITY RULES, MAY 10, 1923 
Don’t throw anything into the reservoir, 
$10 fine 
No bathing in the reservoir......... $20 fine 
No boating in the reservoir......... $5 fine 
No garbage is to be dumped in river.$100 fine menD 
After Ross and James had collected several 
fines in toy money, their rules were very respect- 
fully observed. Helen and Sarah asked permis- 
sion of Douglas—the representative in our group 
of the Waterways Superintendents—before they 
even allowed their dolls to go bathing in the river. 
Maude, from the other group, faithfully inspected 
and mended faulty elevators. Douglas was called

upon continually for help in making connections 
with electricity. Sarah held her own as dress- 
maker in spite of her competitors and began 
receiving written orders from the group of Seven 
B’s. 
In the play in the City, the various buildings 
were often used for different purposes. Dorothy 
changed the Holly Hotel into the Duke of York’s 
Palace for awhile and went into the shop to make 
a throne for the Duke. Roger showed a sense of 
shame in possessing a schoolhouse and soon 
changed it into an office building. 
But the minute some of the girls saw there was 
to be no schoolhouse in the City they began shift- 
ing one of the rooms in an apartment house into a 
schoolroom. 
Play With Big Materials 
OUTDOORS 
Some fascinating steamer play out in the yard 
continued for a week or two. The large blocks 
were built in the shape of a steamer. Staterooms 
were constructed inside with upper and lower 
berths. The roof, which jutted out from the yard 
wall to protect the blocks from rain, served as an 
upper deck which was reached by means of the 
slide borrowed from the see-saw. A steering wheel 
which Mr. Reber had made for the Sixes was set 
up in front, and the boat was carefully steered. 
 
-P-A-G-E-272
  256 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
Storms came up and sometimes danger appeared 
in the shape of an enemy’s boat, or a whale, or a 
fire down in the engine room. There was a nurse 
on board and a ship’s doctor. The passengers 
went to meals and put their ehildren to bed, and 
sometimes called in the doctor and the nurse. Re- 
gardless of their passengers, the officers occasion- 
ally changed the boat into a whaling vessel, but 
the play in the staterooms went on without 
change. 
Fire engine play, engaging the whole of the 
group, sprang up several times and was carried 
on with excitement and energy. 
INDOORS 
One rainy day when the children could not go 
out in the yard to play, Jenny said, ‘‘Can’t we 
bring our furniture and things in from the tool 
shed and play on the tables?’’ Very soon a com- 
munity play was going on that took in most of the 
group. The tops of the tables served as rooms— 
dining-rooms, nurseries, bedrooms, and play- 
rooms. Francis, Douglas, and Walter came into 
the fun by starting a fire. Later, Walter ran a 
taxi cab. The play had started up again in the 
afternoon before I came into the room. It was 
being entered into with such enjoyment that I 
decided not to interrupt and therefore set aside 
the drawing period I had planned.

Organized Games 
Only a few times did some of the children come 
to me and ask for games, such as ‘‘Red Rover,”’ 
*“‘Fox and Squirrel,’? and ‘‘Goosey, Goosey 
Gander.’’? These were seldom entered into with 
the same enthusiasm that their own imaginative 
group play brought forth. 
Drawing and Painting 
The children made table covers of all sizes and 
shapes for the party to which they had invited 
their mothers and fathers. They used drawing 
paper and all of them chose water-colors which 
they mixed themselves, rather than the show-card 
colors in the jars, or the crayons. They all 
worked earnestly and produced some of the most 
effective paintings that they had done. Some of 
the paintings were of flowers growing, trees bud- 
ding, and blue skies. One or two showed tables set 
out under grape-vine arbors or trees. There were 
a few with brightly colored designs. Francis 
painted an exquisite little picture of a yacht sail- 
ing out to sea and a house in the distance. 
The class continued to work on illustrations for 
their reading books and many interesting stories 
were connected with these pictures. There were 
engines, trains, boats, docks, derricks, horses, chil- 
dren, farmers, rivers, oceans, whales—pictures of 
nearly everything that the children were coming

  258 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
in contact with either through actual experience 
or through reading. Ruth was the only one who 
refused to make illustrations. Although her tech- 
nique had improved noticeably, her critical ability 
of her own powers had gone ahead of it and she 
was afraid she would spoil her book. The search 
for suitable matter to illustrate often caused the 
children to re-read pages of their books. 
I. Practicat ExPERIENCES 
Shop 
Most of the buildings for the City were com- 
pleted at the beginning of the month but 
they required a small amount of repairing and 
painting and were constantly supplemented as 
new needs arose. As the children finished weaving 
hammocks, they went over to the shop and made 
standards. Sometimes they wanted more furni- 
ture and made that, or redecorated what they 
already had. Francis needed encouragement and 
help in finishing up the farm buildings, but he 
finally completed them. Douglas finished the dock 
for the New York side, but it did not prove very 
satisfactory as it was under water when the river 
was at high tide. Some boats were completed and 
wooden trees and flowers were made. The station 
for the dock was the only unfinished building. Its 
builders had had plans that were too ambitious. 
The shop during the last month proved a very
-P-A-G-E-275

convenient place for the finishing up of old plans, 
or for the carrying out of small details of new 
ones. 
Cooking—Notes by Miss Hannum 
The months of April and May were given to 
reviewing the fundamental principles which had 
been evolved throughout the year. The only new 
phase of cookery was ‘‘Frozen Mixtures.’’ 
The review was begun by a lesson on Jelly Roll. 
This was a review of Hot Water Sponge Cake, 
made in January. 
In the discussion, the majority of the class could 
tell the fundamental differences between plain and 
sponge cake. The exact proportions used in 
making sponge cake were not well remembered, 
yet very good suggestions were made and the pro- 
portions decided by group discussion. 
In this lesson the children as a whole showed 
greater ease and dexterity in the final process of 
rolling the cake, than they were capable of earlier 
in the year. 
Spice Cake lesson was a review of plain cake, 
with the children suggesting the spices to add. 
Some suggestions were made which were not 
accepted by the class. Only the proportions were 
reviewed; nothing was said about the method of 
combining. Francis and Ruth only were hesitant 
in some of the steps. 
 
-P-A-G-E-276
  ‘260 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
The improvement in technique was clearly 
reflected in the superior quality of the food pro- 
duced, and the lessening of the time required. 
With the exception of Francis and Ruth, they all 
seem to work about on a par, Ruth working better 
than Francis, yet not quite equal to the rest. 
When the work in ‘‘Frozen Mixtures’? was 
begun, the principle of the ice-cream freezer was 
first discussed; why salt was used; why the ice 
melted and where the mixture received the heat 
required. Next the ingredients were discussed. 
Many of the children had helped make it in their 
homes; Roger, Grace and Douglas contributed 
most of the suggestions. Hach cooking group of 
two had some part to do, combining it all in one 
two-quart freezer. 
Bearing in mind that the freezer held two quarts 
they decided quite accurately how many cups of 
milk, how much cream, sugar, and eggs to use. 
The fact was brought out that some ice-cream was 
made without eggs. 
After one lesson on ice-cream, the group had a 
party to which the mothers were invited. The 
children prepared little sponge cakes and ice- 
cream. With the idea in mind that they were pre- 
paring for a party, there seemed to be an added 
earnestness and intense enthusiasm. After hav- 
ing named very quickly the ingredients which they 
were going to use in making their cakes, the cake
-P-A-G-E-277
  THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL ~ 261 
makers were left entirely to themselves. They 
took charge of the actual baking and not a cake 
was burned or otherwise spoiled. In doubling the 
quantity of the ice-cream, there was much hesi- 
taney, but the method was well remembered. The 
entire work of preparing the food, setting tables, 
et cetera, was accomplished in fifty minutes by the 
group. 
After the ice-cream, the next lesson was Orange 
Ice. Ices were compared to ice-cream and both 
the similarity and the difference brought out. 
After making orange ice, the class drew up a 
very good recipe for strawberry ice, and made it 
in the next lesson. This was the last lesson in 
frozen mixtures. 
In summing up the year’s work, the following 
results are apparent: 
1. Some understanding of the principles of 
canning and preserving, flour mixtures and 
frozen mixtures. 
2. Better reasoning in applying the old to the 
new. 
3. Great improvement in technique and dex- 
terity. 
4, Ability to co-operate with one another in pre- 
paring a dish. 
5. Routine habits of dishwashing, care of sup- 
plies, ete.

Clay 
The whole class continued its work in clay with 
one period a week. They made bowls and dishes 
and bathtubs for their houses and modeled some 
very good animals. Walter did some careful 
modeling of a hen and an elephant. Francis 
worked earnestly and well on a boat. Dorothy 
and Grace both made teapots for their mothers, 
and Roger a covered ink-well for his. 
TIL. Specian Tramine 
Reading 
Francis, upon finishing The Earlier Cave Men, 
began The Later Cave Men, but after he had 
struggled with it awhile, found it beyond him. He 
was so disappointed, however, that I read a little 
of it to him and to a group which gathered. Doug- 
las had to put forth his bravest effort to get the 
story of The Earlier Cave Men, but he would not 
listen to my suggestion of an easier book to read. 
His power of concentrated perseverance is un- 
usual. Walter began the reading of The Tree 
Dwellers with relish but did not have time to 
finish it. Roger found Red Feather just to his 
taste, and could never read to me when I came to 
him in the reading period without telling me the 
part of the story just previous to the part he was 
reading. He has gained surprising independence 
in reading, considering his early struggles. Jenny

THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL ~ 263 
and Dorothy have not gained this independence, 
although they have profited by the extra periods 
of phonetic drill they have been given. They have 
had to be shown each separate step over and over. 
They were the only ones in the class, for instance, 
who, knowing what i¢ said, and after making up 
many words containing it, still did not go on to 
the next step and recognize for themselves the 
sound of the z in tt. One day after some one had 
asked me to write the word better on the board, 
Walter said, ‘‘ Always, if I’m not sure whether to 
put an e or anzina word, I think of the e in Jenny 
and then I know.’’ This proved of some help to 
Jenny. 
Our books of original stories and verse and 
accounts of the class doings were completed. 
Before any page was added to a child’s book, his 
reading of it was sanctioned by some child or by 
me, except in the case of the few to whom the 
reading was very simple. I overheard Mary say 
to Ruth when she had finished the leaf containing 
The Plum Pudding by Gordon, ‘‘Do you think I 
read it well enough?’’ Ruth replied, ‘‘Well, I 
think you could read it better if you read it 
again.’? Thereupon Mary cheerfully read it over 
again. 
We had a Verse Assembly one day with the 
Seven B’s in which every one had an opportunity 
to tell or to read some of his favorite verse. We 
 
-P-A-G-E-280
264 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
worked for a week before, hunting through collec- 
tions of poetry and through readers for the verses, 
and practicing reading them aloud. Some of the 
children knew exactly what they wanted and 
others needed help in finding out. Jenny, who 
most often repeated verse to the class, brought her 
Robert Louis Stevenson from home. Helen 
brought Emilie Kipp Baker’s First Book of 
Poetry and Roger brought some typewritten verse 
his father had chosen for him. Christina Rossetti, 
Vachel Lindsay, Lewis Carroll, Mother Goose, 
were all represented. 
I carefully checked the books each child, with 
the exception of Helen and Sarah, had read. 
Often books were taken home and parts of them 
read there. The number of books read by each 
child is given below, alt 1ough it does not repre- 
sent very well the reading ability. In the case of 
Francis, for instance, several of the books he 
read were difficult, and he dipped into many with- 
out finishing them. Roger, Jenny, and Dorothy 
each read four primers. —

Some tests in reading were given. The results 
are shown in the table on page 266. The children 
enjoyed working with Haggerty’s. Some of them 
later made up very simple ones themselves on the 
same order and brought them to school. The 
whole class (with the exception of Dorothy and 
Jenny) worked perseveringly with the Stanford 
Achievement Test and two forms of the Thorn- 
dike McCall. The first form of the Thorndike 
McCall Reading Test taxed the powers of Jenny 
and Dorothy to such an extent that they were able 
to stay with it but a short time. I told them they 
need not do the second form and they were very 
glad to be excused. They were then given Gray’s 
Oral Reading Test by Miss Schriefer. Roger was 
not present on the day the second form of Thorn- 
dike McCall was given. Helen and Sarah both 
read well at the beginning of the year: As they 
were not tested then, these tests do not show their 
gain in reading during the year. Much of their 
reading period at school was devoted to clay, shop, 
and other activities. Francis had shown no ad- 
vantage over the rest of the group at first, but 
about the fourth month he was reading very

easily. He brought a fat little book to school 
entitled Learning to Read Without Tears which 
his English nurse had given him. His mother said 
the year previous he had followed her and his 
nurse about getting them to read from this book 
and asking them words from it, so he had evi- 
dently laid a good foundation for himself in read- 
ing.

Spelling 
The written spelling took up all of the writing 
periods. Interest grew in making the list as we 
went on day after day. But it should have been 
started earlier as our regular program was broken

into the last two weeks of school. We were able 
to go over only about half of the words on our 
list. The Stanford Achievement Spelling Test 
was given. The results are given in the last 
column of the table on page 266. 
Language 
One period, a few days after our picnic on 
Staten Island, when I had only Sarah, Walter, 
Jenny and Mary, I asked them to picture them- 
selves back at the picnic and remember what they 
liked best. ‘‘Rolling down hill’? came from one 
of them. So I said, ‘‘Tell me why you liked it.’’ 
After I had jotted down their different contribu- 
tions, I asked them to help me put things in their 
right places and tell.me what they wanted left out. 
I offered a suggestion once or twice, as: that they 
did not make me see the colors we had seen that 
day clearly enough, that they might picture the 
hens better than by saying they were walking 
(Walter here substituted ‘‘flapping’’), and I sug- 
gested ‘‘grass’’ in the last line instead of ‘‘yard.’’ 
One of the children objected to Jenny’s ‘Little 
buttercups going up the hill,’’ but Jenny would . 
not listen to changing it, saying that that was the 
way they looked as she rolled down—as if they 
really were going up the hill.

Although there was little time the last month 
for any written stories, I found a few in individual 
composition books. Most of the children had been 
going out to the country on Saturdays and Sun- 
days and several wrote about the spring. Here 
is the most interesting one:

Number 
Everyone, except Walter, was finally drawn 
into a keen interest in the drill side of Number. 
Even Walter began to weaken. He had greater 
skill than Francis, but Francis came to show more 
pleasure in such work. Jenny, Helen, Sarah— 
and Ruth less frequently—asked for papers of 
addition combinations to take home at night to 
work on. They spent many free periods at school 
with these as well, working with the clock in front 
of them, and recording the amount of time spent. 
They also began choosing ‘‘Ring Toss’’ in free 
periods and sometimes drew other children into 
the game. 
At least three times a week we had drills at 
the board on the addition and subtraction com- 
binations under 12. One race the children spe- 
_Cially liked. Certain combinations, without the 
answers, were written on the board by each child. 
Then at the word ‘‘go’’ each one wrote the 
answers to his combinations, taking a certain 
position in the middle of the room as soon as he 
finished, the next child standing next, and so on. 
They also enjoyed races in which only three or 
four children participated, the rest of the class 
watching while these three or four ‘‘climbed lad- 
ders’’ of combinations. 
The teacher of the Elevens introduced a new 
eard game that the children liked. It involved  
-P-A-G-E-286
  270 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
practice in adding numbers to endings and so in- 
creased their skill. ‘‘Slap Jack’’ began the num- 
ber lesson on several occasions and never failed 
to be greeted with enthusiasm. 
Toy money was used in the Play City although 
it was difficult for me to tell to what extent. Many 
transactions took place between individuals that 
came to my knowledge only accidentally. Doug- 
las, however, told me he was earning a lot of 
money in the electrical business and Sarah’s pile 
grew higher all the time. Ross and James, from 
the Seven B’s, were faithful about collecting fines. 
Occasionally, a child showed that his expenses 
must have been heavy recently, by choosing free 
periods for making more money. 
The Sevens were invited the last week of school 
to a meeting with the Eights who have conducted 
the School Supply Store this year. They were 
shown over the store and told of the net earnings, 
approximating $50, from the year’s business. The 
Eights proposed that the Sevens buy the remain- 
ing stock and fixtures amounting to about $27, and 
suggested that they borrow the necessary capital 
from the School Secretary, Miss Brown, as the 
Eights themselves had done the year before. The 
Sevens discussed the plan and decided unani- 
mously to take over the store. They had been 
looking forward to it all the year as they made 
their purchases there, or as the Hights delivered
-P-A-G-E-287
THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 271 
materials to our room. They elected Walter as 
the secretary and Jenny, who has stood out as the 
member of the class most rapid and accurate in 
number, as the Treasurer. Walter then wrote a 
note to Miss Brown asking for the loan of the 
money. The money was received and paid to the 
Eights and the Sevens became the owners of the 
store. 
IV. Orcanization of InForMaTION 
Discussions 
The two groups of Sevens met together for the 
purpose of discussing the carrying on of the work 
of the Play City. Each child became responsible 
for some part of the work. (See Play City.) 
We had already studied the work of street 
cleaning and the disposal of rubbish, garbage, and 
sewage in Manhattan. Now, we entered into a 
study of the water supply of New York and of 
its postal service. 
The postman came up to our room one day with 
his mail bag and told the children something about 
the mail service of New York. He was deluged 
with questions about what forced the mail through 
the underground tubes—how fast it went—what 
trains carried mail—how it was sorted—how he 
knew which district to go to, et cetera. Then 
Jenny took him out to the Play Gite and showed 
him the Post-Office there.
-P-A-G-E-288
  272 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
The Seven B’s gave an Assembly on how we 
get our water in New York. They showed some 
slides, and also some pictures they had drawn, 
which were even more interesting, illustrating 
how the water comes down from the Catskills. 
They told us how the water is kept clean. They 
gave us a little history of the water supply of 
Manhattan—how the Dutch put down wells, and 
then how a company was formed and piped water 
into the houses in wooden pipes. 
The two groups of Sevens prepared for an 
‘Assembly together with slides from the American 
Museum of Natural History on the ‘‘History of 
Our Country’s Transportation.’? The children 
were fascinated by the pictures and interrupted 
continually to add bits to the descriptions of the 
pictures given by the different members of the 
groups. The pictures showed: 
1. Ways of travel in the early days of our 
country, 
Indian trails and caves. 
Trains of pack horses. 
Stage coach. 
First Steamboat. 
Comparison of New York harbor in 1820 
and 1920.

2. Modern transportation facilities, 
Enormous engines,

THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 273 
Steamers. 
Submarines. 
Airplanes. 
Mrs. Mitchell brought us her picture map of 
Manhattan and its harbor, and a pilot’s chart. 
She read part of a story she is writing about some 
children flying in an airplane over Manhattan. 
She held the absorbed attention of the two groups 
of Sevens. They followed the map and chart as 
she read and many interesting discussions arose. 
The signals of the bell buoys and sirens to warn 
pilots of the proper channels in the harbor; the 
lighthouses further inland that the boats must 
sight continually ; the different sandy points, such 
as Rockaway Beach and Sandy Hook; the hills 
and valleys under the water and their constant 
wearing away and changing; the depths of the 
water compared with the depth of the largest 
boats—these were all points of great interest. 
Trips 
Staten Island. 
Orientation 
Before we went on our picnic to Staten Island, 
we traced our way there on the map. Several 
days after our return I told the children to help 
themselves to some plasticene, if they would like
-P-A-G-E-290
  274 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
to make maps of our trip. They started working 
in groups, drawing outlines of Manhattan and of 
the coast-lines of New Jersey and Long Island 
on pieces of cardboard, and then filling in the 
land with plasticene. But they became so inter- 
ested that soon each was working on a map of his 
own. The large picture map of New York City 
was put up on the drawing-board of the easel in 
front of them, and Walter and I assisted different 
children with the outlines, helping them to see 
where the coast was very irregular and where 
Long Island and Staten Island almost touched at 
the Narrows. The maps, as they progressed, took 
on extreme individuality. Francis put in a raised 
Sixth Avenue Elevated. Some of the class indi- 
cated the Elevated with red paint and the subway 
with blue. The Statue of Liberty was raised on 
Bedloe’s Island. The Metropolitan and the Wool- 
worth stood out; Central Park and the Battery 
and much of Staten Island and New Jersey be- 
came green. All the water was painted blue and 
steam boats of plasticene appeared. Each child 
was eager to take his map home. 
Stories 
Parts of Banneriail by Ernest Seton Thomp- 
son, were read to the enjoyment of the class. We 
had a verse assembly (See Reading) in the 
preparation of which I read aloud some of my,
-P-A-G-E-291
THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL = 275 
favorite verse and several of the children read 
theirs. On one of the last days of school, I partly 
read and partly told Browning’s ‘‘Pied Piper of 
Hamelin’’ and the children listened eagerly. 
Science 
As told under ‘‘The Play City,’’ wires were 
laid underground and the houses in the Play City 
were connected with electricity.
-P-A-G-E-292
  REPORT ON MUSIC 
Group Seven’ has come to the music room for a 
half-hour lesson twice each week, with an added 
free period once a week. 
In this free period, those who came did the thing 
especially interesting to them at the time—com- 
posed a song or experimented with the different 
instruments, many of which were made by the 
children (groups Seven to Twelve). They also 
sang favorite songs or continued any game or 
device especially appealing to them, through 
which they extended their musical background. 
The children have studied songs related to their 
work or interest, or chosen for broad musical 
values. The list included:

276 
 
-P-A-G-E-293
THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 277 
Several of these folk songs were taken as a 
setting for verses relating to the special work and 
interest of the group. The children also enjoyed 
singing songs of their own composition. 
Group Seven frequently listened to selections 
played on the piano, to determine which one they 
would like to accompany with their ‘‘orchestra’’ 
of tom-toms, tambourines, and triangles. A direc- 
tor was then chosen, who used the different in- 
struments, as the music proceeded, to express his 
understanding of the character of the composi- 
tion. This same ‘‘orchestra’’ had been previously 
used in their work as six-year-olds to express 
direct rhythm only. 
A partial list of favorites included:

Simple songs have been used for hearing, recog- 
nizing, and expressing rhythm. 
For the same purposes rhythmic games have 
been used, and again the orchestra. Simple nota- 
tion leading to staff reading has been a part of the
-P-A-G-E-294
  278 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
rhythmic games, and familiar songs have been 
recognized from their notation on the blackboard. 
The orchestra was used to play simple rhythmic 
notation phrases from the blackboard, or the nota- 
tion of some selection accompanied by the piano. 
Pitch has also been studied through simple 
songs, especially chosen for accurate hearing and 
expression. In this connection, each child made 
three-note ‘‘Pipes of Pan’’ from hollow reeds, 
tuning them with great care and interest to the 
first three tones of the diatonic scale. Pitch direc- 
tion has been read and written through the use of 
lines. - 
Group Seven has learned to distinguish phrases 
in a simple musical composition, to give the tonic 
or rest tone to an unfinished phrase, and to deter- 
mine the number of notes in a chord. 
The children were often eager to make up songs, 
coming to the music room in groups of three or 
four. 
The songs made as they prepared for their 
Wheat play serve as an example of this work. As 
the idea of a Wheat play grew, the children were 
anxious for every spare moment in order to think 
out their songs with me or to have me write them 
down. They brought original verses that were 
sometimes too cumbersome for music, but by 
swinging the rhythm as they recited the verses 
they always discovered this for themselves, and 
made their own changes. The children first deter-
-P-A-G-E-295
THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 279 
mined the meter of the song by swinging it as they 
recited the verses. Then one would start spon- 
taneously to sing a phrase, to be joined by another 
child with his contribution, and so on until the 
song was completed. Sometimes several attempts 
were made before the children were satisfied. I 
was asked to play over several times what had 
already been given, while additions were made or 
choices taken between one of two phrases. It was 
interesting to see how some of the children, who 
had made before no attempt to put their words 
into song, could hardly wait for the music to be 
taken down. Billy, in his interest in the farm 
horse, said, ‘‘Listen, this is the way he sounds!’’ 
Edwin, who sang the boat song, after the intro- 
duction by George and Jane of the waves and wind 
said: ‘‘Now this is going to be a fast boat. Be 
sure to write it this way.’’ In the rain song, 
which three children did together, one child could 
hardly wait for the other to take breath before 
carrying on the melody, although there was a little 
difficulty in getting started. 
The music of all the songs was taken down as 
given by the children, with no addition or correc- 
tion of mine. The children’s music will be found 
in the notes of ‘‘The Story of the Wheat.’ 
It may be of interest to record one or two les- 
sons to illustrate the use of some of the material 
noted.

  280 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
November 24, 1922 | 
Group Seven entered as ‘‘Sellenger’s Round’’ 
was played for the first time, and started swinging 
the rhythm at once. They continued after they 
had seated themselves, a few joining with the 
melody. Then the group was divided, one half 
swinging the broad rhythm, the other half clap- 
ping the pattern, all singing the melody and hear- 
ing the pattern very well. 
On the blackboard were the ‘‘pitch pictures,’’ in 
numbered ‘‘frames,’’ of four songs which we had 
been studying within a month: ‘‘A Farmer Went 
Riding,’’ ‘‘A Winter Night,’’ ‘‘The Jackdaw and 
the Falcon,’’ ‘‘Hardy Sailor Lads.’’? This is a 
game the children all play, and everyone, with the 
exception of Ruth, was soon announcing a song 
he or she had discovered in some one of the 
‘‘frames.’’? Before singing the songs, the children 
*‘tuned’’ their voices with the directed use of the 
syllables, lee, loo, loh, lah, read from the shapes of 
the mouth drawn on the board, and sung to the 
music of an Indian lullaby, familiar to them and 
well adapted for placing their tones. 
This little exercise held the interest of the en- 
tire group. Two or three children then took turns 
in clapping the rhythm of one of the pictured 
songs, the group finding it, and announcing it by 
the number on its ‘‘frame.’’ 
‘Hardy Sailor Lads’’ started out with a stri-
-P-A-G-E-297

dent voice quality, so we stopped to find the 
trouble. The children said some were talking the 
tune instead of singing it. Off we started again 
and, with the exception of two hard tones from 
Edwin in a very exciting place, all sang well and 
with as joyous spirit as before. 
As ‘The Jackdaw and the Falcon’’ was not yet 
entirely familiar, we studied it in various ways. 
The children started the song and continued until 
I clapped my hands, when they stopped singing, 
but continued ‘‘hearing the music’’ and, at a clap 
of the hands, sang aloud again at the point 
reached. All enjoyed this, and there was good 
concentration on the part of everyone. Then the 
children wanted to ‘‘play the organ’’ with the 
tune, so they clasped their hands to make the 
“‘stops’’ like an organ. I pulled a ‘‘stop,’’ the 
organ ‘‘spoke’’ and gave the tune until it was shut 
off and another ‘‘stop’’ pulled out. This ‘‘stop’’ 
then took up the tune at once. There was unflag- 
ging attention during the time we played this 
game, and every child had an opportunity to sing 
a part of the song alone. Three failed to pick the 
melody up in rhythm (Francis, Ruth, and Wal- 
ter). The two remaining songs were sung freely 
and without interruption. 
Numbers 1, 3, 5, 8 of the tone bars? were used 
at the children’s request for a ‘‘Follow the 
1Tone bars. (See Appendix D.) 
 
-P-A-G-E-298
  282 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE IN 
Leader’? game. From the pattern given on the 
piano, Jenny quickly arranged the tone bars in 
their proper sequence. Helen stood with her back 
to the tone bars until a phrase was played, when 
she turned and repeated it correctly. The chil- 
dren were all very eager for a turn, and all suc- 
ceeded after one or two trials, excepting Walter, 
who took a little longer time. 
With just time for one ‘‘orchestra’’ selection, 
Tschaikowsky’s German Melody was chosen in 
preference to his March. Mary directed the first 
time, Roger the second. Each had a different in- 
terpretation and was criticized by the children, 
who had decided opinions. The lesson time was 
extended a few minutes for a selection they had 
played the lesson before—Nessler’s Pied Piper, 
which Grace conducted with splendid spirit and 
precision, and with great discrimination. 
March 16, 1923 
The children entered the music room as a 
spirited Flemish folk song was played on the 
piano, one which the children were soon to learn. 
Marching about the room, they swung the rhythm 
when the piano used the low register, and clapped 
the rhythm when the music changed to a higher 
register. The changes were made more or less 
quickly as the game progressed. Any child not 
expressing the change at once, dropped out of the
-P-A-G-E-299
THE CITY AND COUNTRY SCHOOL 283 
line. The game was played twice before the group 
seated themselves. Four dropped out the first 
time; the second time, one. 
When the children were seated, an old English 
song, The Sun is Rising out of Bed, was played. 
The children recognized it, and sang it through 
three times before all were satisfied. Sarah had a 
choice of songs, and clapped the rhythm of A 
Windy Night so clearly it was soon recognized. 
Several examples of the sound of the wind were 
given by the children and incorporated into the 
song, the crescendo and diminuendo marks being 
used in their several ways to illustrate. 
Two songs were hummed to the children and 
heard to be a ‘‘new’’ and an ‘‘old’’ Blacksmith 
song. One was in the pitch pictures of three num- 
bered ‘‘frames’’ on the blackboard. Irma found 
it first and said it was the ‘‘new one.’’ The ‘‘old 
one’? was written in an empty frame by Jenny. 
A rhythmic game of ‘‘Question and Answer’’ was 
played. One child, while keeping the definite 
swing of down and up for two meters, and using 
the syllable ta, asked of the child next him a 
simple rhythmic combination question; the child 
responded in similar but not exact pattern, in 
equally balanced phrase. Original questions and 
answers in rhythmic form went all around the 
class, quickly and spontaneously. When at three 
different times the phrases did not balance, the 
 
-P-A-G-E-300
284 EXPERIMENTAL PRACTICE 
children, listening, noticed and corrected it them- 
selves, ‘‘Walter had too long a tail on his an- 
swer,’’ was one of the corrections made. Con- 
necting this at once with the written symbol, the 
children followed the pointer up and down a column 
of two-four rhythmic combinations written on the 
blackboard, using the syllable ta in giving the note 
values. The children were accompanied by chords 
on the piano. They determined by the chords when 
the end of a phrase was reached, and announced 
whether they were to ‘‘stop’’ or to ‘‘go on.’’ Only 
a short time was left for this work which all were 
eager to do.

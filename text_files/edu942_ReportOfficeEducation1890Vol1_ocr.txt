REPORT OF COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
  . DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, 
BUREAU OF EDUCATION, 
Washington, D. 0., January 1, 1893. 
Sim: I have the honor to submit herewith my third annual report, 
the same being for the year ending June 30, 1891. 
GENERAL STATISTICS.* 
The total number of pupils in schools of all grades, public and pri- 
vate, at any time in the year is given (p. 40) at 14,669,069, the same 
being 23.09 per cent of the population, not yuite one in four of all per- 
sons. In this number, however, the statistician has not included even- 
ing schools, nor art, industrial, business schools, nor schools for defect- 
ive classes or for Indians, in all some 300,000 pupils, swelling the total 
to nearly 15,000,000 pupils. 
Upon examination of the comparative statistics of enrollment in the 
common schools the increase over the previous year is shown to be 
268,865. The increase over the previous year was for— 
  1890 over 1889 -- 304, 936 
1889 over 1888 -. 209, 660 
1888 over 1887.... - 225, 180 
1887 over 1886... 220, 484 
1886 over 1885 - 266, 436 
  A study of statistics shows progressing waves and returning eddies 
from year to year. When a long wave of industrial prosperity passes 
over the country the enrollment in the private schools shows a gain as 
compared with the public schools. Parents desire not so much a caste 
education as to gratify their peculiar notions as to course of study, 
hygienic. conditions, quality of discipline, or hours of school attend- 
ance, and length of school term. The private school attracts by its 
special features in these respects. But when the wave of industrial 
prosperity subsides and a returning eddy sets in the private schools 
suffer most and the public schools gain relatively. 1t may be expected, 
therefore, that the increase of enrollment in the public schools will not 
be uniform.

  REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION, 
GRADE OF PUPILS. 
Of these 15,000,000 pupils it appears that 96-4 per cent were receiving 
elementary instruction such asis given in primary and grammar schools 
in the first eight years of the school life of the child. Under secondary 
instruction there were 2-6 per cent and under higher instruction only 1 
per cent. Secondary instruction technically includes the work from 
the ninth to the twelfth year of the course of study, and higher edu- 
cation all beyond that. According to this exhibit an average town in 
the United States with 1,000 pupils in school should have 964 in the 
elementary schools, 26 in the high school, 10 in the college or profes- 
sional school. ? 
LENGTH OF SCHOOL YEAR. 
For the present year the number of days schools were kept averaged 
135-7, the same being an increase of nearly a day and a half over the 
year previous. The comparative table shows the length of school year 
to have been for— 
  Days.

- 1323 
133-7 
134°3 
135 °7 
  This increase in length of session keeps pace with the growth of cities. 
Nearly all cities and large villages hold a session of from 18) to 200 
days, while schools in rural districts continue in session from 70 to 150 
days. 
At the same time there has been a reaction in the thickly-settled com- 
munities of the Middle and Northeastern sections against the too long 
annual sessions which at first prevailed and in favor of longer vaca- 
tions and shorter daily sessions. The necessity of preserving the 
child’s elasticity is more clearly perceived. Too much strain on the 
growing child has the effect of arresting his development at a lower 
stadium of development. The city gamin, perhaps an orphan left to 
shift for himself at a tender age, has developed a precociously world- 
wise and cunning castof intellect. But he has well-nigh stopped grow- 
ing in the direction of science and art, literature, and humane culture. 
He is not so likely to help society as to burden it later on with his subsist- 
ence in a pauper asylum or a jail. It is beginning to be seen that 
society loses by shortening the period of childhood and youth, even for 
the sake of the school. The tasks of the school must not be so severe 
as to overcome the child’s power of reaction, for this will prevent his 
continual development. Great perfection on a lower plane does not 
count against loss of capacity to reach a higher degree of development.
-P-A-G-E-13
REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
DAILY ATTENDANCE IN SCHOOL. 
  The item enrollment in school ineludes all pupils entered on the school 
registers during the year, no matter how short their period of attend- 
ance. The public schools keep a careful record from day to day of the 
number present and the number absent of those belonging to school. 
The total number of days’ attendance of pupils the past year as reported 
to the Bureau of Education was 1,129,955,876 days, which being 
divided by 135-7, the average number of days the schools were kept, 
gives 8,329,234 as the number of pupils in school the entire average 
annual session. This also shows that the average number of days 
attended by the 13,000,000 enrolled in the public schools was only 87. 
In my last report (1889-90, p. x1v) I showed the average amount of 
schooling received by the entire population, based on the statistics of 
that year, to be 4:3 years of 200 days each. This is enough to take the 
pupil over a little more than one-half the course of study in the elemen- 
tary school. Four States, Massachusetts, New York, Connecticut, and 
Ohio, give more than six years (of 200 days each) of schooling to each 
inhabitant, but the sections having fewest cities and most rural popu- 
lation are giving on an average only two and one-half years of actual 
schooling to the entire population. This shows that we are far from 
the danger of overeducating our people. It also gives additional 
interest to the statistics above quoted, showing the slowly increasing 
length of the annual session the schools are kept. 
SCHOOL TEACHERS. 
The total number of teachers in the public (or common) schools is 
reported at 368,791, one-third of these (33-1 per cent) being males. To 
this should be added the number in private schools—some 60,000 in all 
—to find the aggregate of teachers, which is nearly 425,000. 
SCHOOL EXPENSES. 
The total expenditure for public schools during the year is reported 
at $146,800,163. This was $17.67 for each pupil attending 135-7 days, 
and $2.31 per capita of the whole population. Of the income for 
schools, nearly 70 per cent comes from local taxes, and 19 per cent from 
State taxes. If the expenditure for private schools is added, estimat- 
ing it at $28,000,000, the total expenditure for education aggregates 
$175,000,000. 
The amount expended on the common schools has risen from $1.56 
per capita of the whole population in 1879-80 to $2.24 in 1889-90 and 
to $2.31 in 1891.. This indicates an attempt to secure a longer school 
term, increased attendance, better schoolhouses, and better-paid teach- 
ers. The amount expended per capita’ has risen in these eleven years 
49 per cent; the attendance has increased from 19-7 to 20:3 per cent of 
 
-P-A-G-E-14
XII REPORT OF 'THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
the population; the average monthly wages of male teachers has 
reached $44.89, of female teachers, $36.65. It is noticeable that the 
increase in expenditures per inhabitant for schools is greatest in the ~ 
Southern States. 
PRIVATE SCHOOLS. 
The percentage of the whole enrollment attending private schools is 
9-8 for elementary grades (first eight years of schooling); 39-8 for sec- 
ondary pupils; and 69-7 for pupils under higher instruction 3 11-2 per 
cent for all grades. In a former report I have taken the ground that 
the private school serves a very useful function, both in providing a 
field for experiment along new lines of educational methods and in 
providing a safeguard against a too niggardly policy in the manage- 
ment of the public schools. If good wages are not paid for good 
teachers they may withdraw and establish private schools. In this 
they serve a very useful function, and the proportion of children in 
such schools is not quite so large as it will become when the wealth 
of the average citizen becomes greater. But the number of secondary 
pupils in private schools is rapidly decreasing by reason of the estab- 
lishment of high schools in cities and villages. 
LAWS RELATING TO SCHOOL ATTENDANCE, 
The specialist on State systems of schools has presented (pp. 35-37) 
an exhibit showing the laws relating to school attendance in the 28 
States having compulsory laws. The prevailing feature in these laws 
is to require pupils from 8 to 14 years to attend school from 12 to 16° 
weeks each year, imposing a fine of not more than $25 on parents or 
guardians for first offense, and a higher fine, and in rare cases impris- 
onment, for each subsequent offense; some States provide special 
truant officers; many provide reform schools for truants; employment 
is forbidden for young children during the hourssof school sessions— 
2 States prescribing for children under 10 years; 4 under 12 years; 4 
under 13 years: these and some other States prohibiting employment 
except when the prescribed schooling has been given. 
EDUCATION IN NEW ZEALAND. 
  In Chapter 1 (pp. 45-94) I have presented a paper of Sir Robert 
Stout, K. 0. M. G., formerly minister of education and premier of the 
colony, giving an admirable sketch of education in New Zealand, both 
of its free, compulsory, secular education and its private and parochial 
education. There is no more interesting chapter in the history of 
education than that which treats of education in the British colonies 
scattered round the world. The English feature of local self-govern- 
ment, in which is combined centralization for the control of what relates 
to the welfare of all, a local administration that sees to what con- 
cerns only the special province, appears under a variety of forms, 
differing in different colonies, and in all these colonies differing from
-P-A-G-E-15
        
    REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. XII 
  the system in the United States. There appear certain decided 
advantages in the manner in which centralization is combined with 
local control in the management of education in the British colonies.            
     EDUCATION IN FRANCE. 
    An attempt has been made by the specialist to give in half a dozen 
pages a brief statement of the system of education in France (Chapter 
ur). The longer expositions printed in the previous reports gave fuller 
details but were less symmetrical. It is intended to report each year 
a brief statement, giving the outlines of the French system, in order 
that the items of current history may have their proper setting and be 
seen in their significance as regards the whole. An interesting sketch 
of the progress of elementary education since Guizot’s law of 1833 is 
translated and summarized from the monograph on the population of 
France by the distinguished statistican, E. Levasseur. The contin- 
uation of the elementary schools in the direction taken by us in 
what is called the “English high school” is in France effected by 
“higher primary schools” (écoles primaires supérieures). A discussion 
follows of the general features of these schools, their increase 
(more than fifty, with an. enrollment of 41,018 pupils, in 1891), 
their programme of studies, their finances. The regular clas- 
sical schools (Lycées), corresponding to our preparatory schools, 
and such high schools as are modeled on the Boston Latin School, 
cover in their course of study half of the work of our elementary 
schools, all of the work of our public high schools, and as much of the 
work of our colleges as is included in the freshman and sophomore 
years. Foreign visitors (especially Atherican visitors) who look in 
upon the work of the French Lycées are very much surprised at the 
amount of work successfully accomplished by the pupils. High author- 
ity estimates the average French boy of 16 at the Lycée to be two years 
in advance of the American boy of the same age in our preparatory 
school. This is one of the topics that challenges careful investigation, 
and it deserves to have a commission appointed to investigate it. In 
comparing the work of the different systems it needs not to be said 
that what is wanted is a rounded estimate of progress, including all 
aspects of growth. The effect of too much strain in any one direction 
will appear as arrested development, hindering advance in higher 
branches of study later on in the course. It is in this matter of arrest 
of development, produced by too much emphasis on memory studies or 
mechanical drill work in the elementary and secondary courses of study, 
that we have most to learn; in fact, the directors of education in all 
nations have most to learn in this field. International comparative 
statistics, commissions sent out to investigate the systems of other 
nations, are, therefore, of especial value just now. The present year of 
the Columbian Exposition* is noteworthy for the number of com- 
missions appointed by European governments to report on the education 
* 1893.

       XIV REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
  of the United States. A new epoch in school statistics is herewith 
inaugurated. ; 
It will be noticed with interest (pp. 116-120) that the French are 
having the same difficulties that we encounter in readjusting the require- 
ments of the degree of bachelor of arts in the presence of what are 
ealled modern, studies, namely, science, history, modern literature, ete. 
EDUCATION IN GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND. 
After a brief view of the educational systems of England and Scot- 
Jand, intended, like that given of France in Chapter m1, to furnish an _ 
explanation of the current history for the year, there follows (Chapter 
v) a special study of the provision made for secondary and technica] 
instruction in Great Britian, and in Chapter vi a sketch of education 
jn Ireland. It is too early, as yet, to study the effect of the law of 
1891 remitting fees of pupils in all schools aided by the Government 
grants and thus establishing, for the first time in the history of Great 
Britain, a free-school system. In my annual report for 1889~90 (in the 
letter of transmittal) I have discussed, at some length, the peculiari- 
ties of English procedure in .the matter of distributing financial aid. 
All existing institutions are assumed to have the first right for help, 
and accordingly they receive it, coupled, of course, with conditions 
such as Government inspection and standards of scholarship and 
attendance. With the passage of the law of 1891 all schools receiving 
the fee grant from the Government were required to remit tuition fees. 
At this point the private and endowed schools commenced to draw 
away from the common standard toward which Government inspection 
has been leading. Hereafter we may expect to see a rapid increase of 
free public schools (“board schools”) and a corresponding decrease of 
private schools. These stood in the ratio of 62 per cent of pupils in 
private schools and 38 per cent in “board schools.” It is likely that 
this ratio will be reversed. But even then Great Britain will have 
three times as large a percentage of enrollment in private schools as 
the United States (38 against 12), while it has, up to 1891, had five 
times the American quota in private schools. 
In last year’s report was presented a detailed account of education in 
Scotland, as the previous year of thatin England. Asketchofthesystem 
of education in Ireland is given in the present report (pp. 151-164). 
It is a record of remarkable progress—from an enrollment of 18 in 1,000 
of the population in 1835 to 176in 1,000 in 1890. The annual expenditure 
for education in Ireland, as late as 1883, was ‘estimated (in our money) 
at $229,509, but in 1890 had risen to $4,729,082, or almost exactly $1 
per capita for the population. The annual enrollment of pupils was 
over 1,000,000 for 1890, as the “‘average” enrollment is put at 828,520, 
In fact, it was 1,037,102, or 22 per cent of the population. An excellent 
system of supervision is in operation, and good salaries are paid to 
teachers. This, with a proportion of the population in school as large   
       
   
-P-A-G-E-17
REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. xv 
as that in the United States or in Germany, ought to work great 
changes in the productive industry and social welfare of the people. 
INDUSTRIAL AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION IN CENTRAL BUROPE. 
In Chapter vii is given a sketch of the provisions for industrial edu- 
cation in Austria, Switzerland, and Germany. The “continuation 
school” of Germany is notlike the “higher primaryschool” of France, an 
equivalent for our “ English high school,” butsomething thatcorresponds 
to the evening high school in Boston and some other cities of America. 
It is- reported that Prussia has 1,131 of these continuation schools 
with 93,029 pupils; Bavaria 242, with 29,472 pupils; Saxony 28, with 
7,912 pupils; Wiirtemberg, 13,649 pupils, 71 out of every 100 appren- 
tices attending such schools; Austria 323, with 65,041 pupils. These 
schools are held either in the evenings or on Sundays. 
EDUCATION IN RUSSIA, 
In Chapter vii (pp. 195-262) is offered the first sketch of the system 
of education in Russia, The table of expenditure shows the sum of 
$12,798,165 appropriated by the General Government. Besides this 
there were contributions from the Church and from local governments. 
The total enrollment of pupils is set at 2,472,627. Of these, 1,944,057 
were boys and 527,520 girls. 
With the growth of urban population in Russia schools increase 
and the enrollment of pupils gains on the population. Hitherto an 
enormous rural population, widely scattered in small village communi- 
ties and using primitive methods of agriculture, has stood in the way 
of the extension of education to all the people. With city life comes 
division of labor, enhanced skill in the various industries, the employ- 
ment of machinery, the increase of productive power on the part of the 
citizen, and the demand for schools for all the children of the people. 
After the Crimean war the Government, upon the initiative of the Czar, 
took the effective step towards encouraging urban civilization by import- 
ing skilled labor from western Europe. This has more than doubled, 
per capita, the wealth-producing power of the Russian people in the 
course of twenty-five years. While the farming populations, as a whole, 
do not produce annually on an average over 6 cents a day for each man, 
woman, and child, the city populations have increased the national pro- 
duction to 14 cents per day (for each inhabitant). : 
EDUCATION IN JAPAN. 
The efforts of Japan to take up into itself the industrial and scien- 
tific achievements of European nations furnish one of the most remark- 
able phenomena of modern history. The results are even more aston- 
ishing. In 1890 a population of 41,000,000 people supported 7,730 Goy- 
ernment schools with an attendance of 3,059,052 pupils. This move- 
ment dates from 1869, but it has, during the last twenty years, taken 
such root that it can no longer be regarded as a mere experiment.

   REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
EDUCATION IN ITALY. 
   A valuable contribution to the report on education in Italy is fur- 
‘nished by Professor Oldriniin Chapter x. It gives numerous details not 
accessible at the time the former statement was prepared for the annual 
report of 188889 (see pp. 182-195 of that report). At the request of 
Professor Oldrini, Signor Luigi Bodio, the eminent Italian statistician, on 
a visit to this country, promised to furnish more recent data than 
those given in this chapter, when such data had been obtained. The 
promise was faithfully kept. Owing, however, to the fact that Prof. 
Oldrini’s article was already in type and the plates cast before Signor 
Bodio returned to Italy, I have not been able to make such use of his 
article in this report as Isvished. I have given in a note at the end of 
this letter (pp. XVII), an abstract of the data furnished, which may be 
read in connection with Chapter x. The entire article of Prof. Bodio 
will be given in the next annual report. 
EDUCATION IN KOREA; THE SANDWICH ISLANDS.    Corea, like Japan, is a nation which originally borrowed its letters 
from China. The reaction against its traditional culture is not so great 
as that of Japan. It has, however, adopted a phonetic alphabet after 
the analogy of the Pheenician used by Europeans. 
The former Commissioner of Education of this Bureau, Gen. John 
Eaton, has written a sketch of education in Hawaii. The number of 
pupils enrolled in the schools is 10,712 out of a population of 89,990. 
This good showing is due to the English-speaking part of the people, 
which is and has been largely a missionary influence. It is interesting 
to note that more than one-half of the pupils are of Hawaiian descent 
and that nearly one-third of the teachers are of the same race. 
COMPARATIVE STATISTICS OF EDUCATION IN THE WORLD. 
A table given on pp. 369-372 brings together in a convenient form 
for comparison the following items of education: (a) number of pupils 
below the grade of the university; (b) ratio of these to the entire popu- 
lation; (c) number in elementary schools; (d) number in secondary 
schools; (e) number in higher institutions; number in special schools; 
number of teachers; expenditures. For convenience of comparison the 
percentages are given in each case. These statistics are given for 
twenty-seven countries of Europe; ten countries of South America; 
four countries of Central America; four countries of North America; 
seven. British colonies in Australasia; two in Africa; two in Asia.        
    
    
       
    
   
   LEGAL EDUCATION. 
At the request of a committee of the American Bar Association an 
inquiry was undertaken by this Bureau into the condition of legal edu- 
cation in America, Europe, and other parts of the world. The results 
of this inquiry are contained in Chapters x11 to Xvi (pp. 376 to 578).

of a special inquiry sent out at the close of the year to all kinder- 
gartens that could be heard of. The report gives 2,000 kindergartens 
and upwards of 65,000 pupils in the United States. But there were 
1,100 more known to exist, which did not reply to the circular of in- 
‘quiry. It is safe to estimate the entire number of pupils in kinder- 
gartens at 100,000. 
The usual statistical information is given in this report, and papers 
of interest on the higher education (xx), professional instruction 
(xxur), education in Alaska (xxv), class intervals in the public schools

XVII REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION, 
EDUCATION IN ITALY. 
[Supplementary to Chapter X.] 
Signor Luigi Bodio, the distinguished director of the statistical bureau in Italy, 
has courteously furnished, at the request of Prof, Alex. Oldrini, information on 
Italian education additional to that by Prof. Oldrini given in Part I of this Report. 
In regard to the illiteracy in the Kingdom, he states the percentage per 100 inhab- 
itants to be as follows:

a@ Rome and Venice not included. 
The decrease in illiteracy in Italy is also demonstrated by the increasing number 
of married men and women who sign the marriage contract, and by the reduced 
number of illiterate’ among the young recruitstwenty years of age. The increased 
number of married men and women who sign the marriage contract is shown by the 
following figures, illiteracy being more noticeable in the southern provinces than in 
the central and northern provinces; more conspicuous in the rural districts and the 
smaller communes than in the ee towns.

A result of the organization of army schools, which are a feature of the Italian 
system of education, is that illiteracy among soldiers is greatly decreased. While 
the percentage of illiterates among those recruits who were born in 1870 was, as 
just stated, 41.10, that of soldiers sent home after their term of military service was 
only 21.95.

  OF EDUCATION. 
INFANT SCHOOLS (ASILI INFANTILI) AND KINDERGARTENS.    
   The greater portion of the infant schools of Italy are established according to 
regulations of the Italian educator Ferrante Aporti (1791-1858), or according to 
the methods of Aporti and Froebel combined. In these schools children acquire the 
first rudiments of an elementary education. The Government gives annual subsidies 
towards establishing infant schools, or aids those already existing. Many are self- 
Se governing and have their own funds. There were 1,178 such in 1892. Still others 
are supported by charitable institutions, charitable associations, and private indi- 
viduals. .

There are in Italy at the present time few kindergartens conducted exclusively 
according to Froebel’s methods. In 1892 they numbered 400. 
POPULAR PRIMARY EDUCATION. 
Primary instruction was first made compulsory in 1859 by a law which required 
the attendance at school of children between-6 and 12 years of age, and enjoined 
upon the communes the support of a number of boys and girls’ schools pro- 
portionate to the number of pupils of age to attend such schools. This law could 
not be enforced on account of the difficulties attendant upon forming a constitution 
in a kingdom composed of provinces that had been separated for many centuries, 
and had different developments in civilization and education. A new law, enacted 
in 1877, made school attendance obligatory between 6 and 9 years of age, and 
required the communes to establish a sufficient number of schools for the school 
population, and to obtain a sufficient number of teachers to carry on the schools. 
On this basis the law has by degrees been enforced in all communes of Italy, viz, 
8,254 on December 31, 1892. The number of pupils (vide p. 322) in public and pri- 
vate elementary day schools has increased from year to year since 1861. In that 
year the pupils numbered 1,008,674; in 1871 there were 1,722,947; in 1881 there were 
1,976,135; in 1892 there were 2,453,939. If we include night schools and Sunday 
schools, a total of 2,678,240 in school is obtained. The statisties presented by Signor 
Bodio are as follows:

NORMAL SCHOOLS, 
These are established for the preparation of teachers of the elementary grades. 
The normals are divided into inferior and superior, the former giving a certificate to 
teach in the lower division of the elementary grades, the latter, a certificate which 
permits its holder to teach in any of the elementary schools. —

Superior normal training for men is given in the scientific and literary faculties of 
the universities. For women there are also higher grade institutions in Rome and 
Florence, where graduates of normat schools can obtain a still more complete course 
- of instruction, such as may be required by those women who desire to become 
instructresses in normal schools, or in schools above the elementary grade. Such 
schools for women were established in 1882, and in 1883~84 there were 105 pupils 
registered; in 1890~91 these numbered 181, The course of study covers Italian lan- 
guages and literature, history, geography, French, English, and German languages 
and literature; mathematics, physics and chemistry, logic, and psychology; also 
hygiene and drawing. # 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
As regards secondary schools Signor Bodio states that the pupils in 1872 numbered 
23,798; there was anincrease to 87,000 in 1882, and to 113,974 in 1891. In the “‘licei” 
there were 71,751 in 1891; in technical schools and institutes, 42,223. Of 56,737 grad- 
uates from the ‘ ginnasi” only 15,014 attended the “ licei, ” the balance (41,723) com- 
menced their career with a preparation of classical studies only. This gives about 
_73 per cent who do not continue a higher grade of education in the “licei” or other 
special schools. Tabulated statistics are as follows:

EDUCATION OF WOM 
  As to the education of women (vide p. 328), it is stated that girls receive a higher 
grade of instruction than that of the five elementary classes in so-called ‘educa- 
_tories,” conservatories, and colleges. A sniall proportion of these institutions may 
be classed as superior or complementary schools, and are annexed to the colleges for 
girls which are supervised by the government. Some are supported by provinces and 
communes, but the larger number are maintained by private corporations or associa- 
tions. The oldest and most thoroughly established are those maintained by the 
municipalities of Milan, Turin, Asti, Genoa, Venice, Padua, and among those estab- 
lished at a later date are those of Bologna, Florence, and Rome. 
The programme and course of study vary in these different institutions. Women are 
admitted to both classicaland technical schools, the technical schools being the most 
frequented by them. In 1891 there were sections for women in 141 of the technical 
schools, and 1,498 women attended. There are also technical schools for women exclu- 
sively. Women are admitted to university privileges, and are most frequently to 
be found in attendance upon the faculties of natural sciences, and medicine and sur- 
gery. Among the women who frequent the institutes of a higher grade than second- 
ary schools it is stated that the majority attend special courses of study, but do not 
endeavor to obtain academic degrees. 
AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION. 
The Italian Government justly recognizes the fact that agricultural, industrial, 
and commercial pursuits tend toward the prosperity of the people. Signor Bodio 
» presents this phase of education as follows: 
Elementary instruction in agriculture is given in the practical schools of agri- 
culiure which were opened in those sections of Italy where the agrarian economy 
required such special study. These schools are supported by the Government, 
provinces, and communes, by corporations or by private individuals, To be admit- 
ted to such schools requires the student to have finished the lower elementary course, 
or to have passed a similar examination. The instruction is both theoretical and 
practical; the latter includes work by the students in all forms of husbandry and 
agricultural operations, the endeavor being to suit the instruction to the locality. 
Special agricultural schools aim to give instruction in regard to the production of 
wines, oil, and cheese, the cultivation of vines, and fruits. The practical and special 
schools are governmental schools, and there are agricultural sections in other gov- 
ernmental schools. The elements of agricultural science are taught in certain nor- 
mal schools for both men and women. In 1890~'91 such instruction was given in 20 
normals for men, and 11 for women. The number of pupils to date who have passed 
an examination in this branch is 694, (

  XXII REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
In 555 elementary schools of the higher grade in 1890-91 the elements of agricul- 
ture were taught, Lectures under governmental auspices are given throughout the 
rural districts of Italy by eminent authorities on the diseases of plants and vege- 
tables. The highest grade of instruction in agriculture is given in the superior schools 
of agriculture in Milan and Portici, and in the agricultural school annexed to the 
University of Pisa. To be admitted to this class of schools the student must pos- 
sess the ‘“‘licenza liceale,” or have graduated from the course of agriculture and sur- 
veying in the technical institutes. Graduation from the superior schools of agricul- 
ture entitles one to the certificate of doctor in agrarian science and prepares the 
graduate to be a teacher of agricultural science. Agricultural experiment stations 
(Stazioni agrarie), for the promotion of more scientific methods, with laboratories 
for study and experiments, have been established by the Government in some dis- 
tricts. There are also special academies or societies of agriculture for the promotion 
of scientific and practical agricultural studies. These are found in Rome, Florence, 
Turin, Pesaro, Palermo, and Milan. Education in this line is also aided by national 
and local agricultural conventions and exhibitions. 
INDUSTRIAL, PROFE! 
  SIONAL, AND COMMERCIAL EDUCATION. 
Industrial training is given in the Schools of Arts and Trades (Scuole di arte e 
mestieri) and in the schools of art as applied to industry (Scuole di arte applicata 
all’ industria), the aim of these schools being to train skilled workmen for factories 
and workshops. The students obtain scientific training as applied to industries 
and trades, The superior or higher grade schools of art, as applied to industry 
(Scuole supeviori di arte applicata all’ industria ) endeayor to cultivate the artistic 
or wsthetic side of the workingmen. The government, provinces, municipalities, 
chambers of commerce, and local corporations unite in the maintenance of these 
schools. Admission is granted to students who have finished the elementary course 
or have passed a similar examination to that given at the close of this course. 
The schools of mines, under similar maintenance, give practical education in 
mining; the students are taken to the mines and sulphur mines to see the actual 
workings.- Admission is granted to graduates of the higher elementary course, or to 
those who pass an equivalent examination. 
Industrial schools for women train for special trades, or in sewing, embroidery, 
flower-making, ete. z 
The highest grade of industrial, professional, or commercial training is found in 
the following institutes maintained by the government, provinces, and communes. 
The Industrial Museum in Turin, which has large laboratories and collections of 
patterns and instruments, and a commercial museum, aims to train students for the 
chemical and mechanical industries, for experiments in physics, and applied elec- 
tricity, and to train teachers for the technical institutes and higher industrial 
schools. 
The Superior Naval School in Genoa aims to perfect the instruction given in the 
mercantile marine institutes and to train naval engineers and machinists and cap- 
tains of the naval service. Teachers for the institutes of the merchant marine are 
also trained here. 
The Superior School of Commerce in Venice is notably a business high school, 
aiming to prepare graduates from the technical institutes for commercial pursuits 
and banking. As a means of promoting trade with the Eastern countries there is a 
course in the Arabian, Turkish, and Japanese languages. This school also prepares 
teachers for the commercial courses in the technical institutes and trains young men 
for the consular service. The higher commercial schools of Bari and Genoa have a 
similar aim and a similar curriculum of study. ‘

SUPERIOR AND SPECIAL STUDIES. 
Higher education is given in the universities and in some superior institutes. The 
universities prepare young men, who are graduates from secondary schools, for 
those professions for which special studies are required, as by such study the 
intellectual life of the nation is enhanced. In the superior institutes special 
branches are taught and application is made of mathematical sciences. 
The universities of Italy are 21 in number, 17 supported by the Government, the 
4 others free universities—that is, supported by their own funds or by provincial 
and communal authorities. The 17 universities also receive provincial or communal 
aid in the establishing of laboratories and annexed schools, and in collecting scien-_ 
tific apparatus. Some of the superior—or higher—institutes also receive aid from 
similar sources and for similar purposes. Eleven of the superior institutes are main- 
tained by the Government and are under governmental supervision. 
Of the governmental universities Bologna, Catania, Genoa, Messina, Naples, 
Padua, Palermo, Pavia, Pisa, Rome, and Turin have all four faculties, namely, 
law, medicine and surgery, physical and mathematical sciences, literature and 
philosophy. Cagliari, Modena, and Parma lack the faculty of philosophy. Sassari 
and Siena have the faculties of law and medicine; Macerata that of law. Among 
the free (libere) universities Ferrara has three faculties, but like Parma and Modena 
lacks the faculty of philosophy and literature. Camerino' and Perugia have the 
legal, medical, and surgical faculties. Urbino has faculties of law and science. 
Schools of pharmacy and obstetrics are annexed to all universities. 
The University of Pisa has a superior school of agriculture annexed to it; the uni- 
versities of Padua, Palermo, Pavia, and Pisa have each a school of applied engineer- 
ing annexed to the faculty of science. The schools annexed to the universities of 
Pisa and Pavia have only the first year of the course of study. 
‘There are scientific museums, laboratories and clinics for medical training attached 
to the universities and to the annexed schools where requisite. Observatories * belong 
either to the universities, or are entirely independent of them, as in Milan, Naples, 
Rome, Florence, Venice, and Forli. 
There are schools of applied engineering in Bologna, Rome, Naples, and Turin. The — 
superior technical institute of Milan is a school for applied mathematics and serves 
as a higher school for the preparation of teachers of physics, chemistry and natural 
sciences in institutes for secondary education. 
The Institute for the Perfecting of Higher Studies in Florence possesses clinical 
schools, botanic specimens, laboratories and scientific museums. It has courses in 
literature, physics, and natural sciences, medicine and surgery, pharmacy and obstet- 
rics. The students in literature, physics, and natural sciences are usually preparing 
to be teachers in secondary schools.

        XxIV REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
. The Scientific and Literary Academy of Milan, which has an annexed course in 
foreign languages, has courses in philosophy and literature. The Superior Normal 
in Pisa prepares teachers for secondary institutes in its courses in philosophy, liter- 
ature, mathematics and natural sciences. The Superior Institute for the Study of 
Social Sciences, founded and endowed in Florence by Senator Carlo Alfieri di 
Sostegno, aims to promote economic and political studies, to prepare young men 
for political life, and for the diplomatic and consular service. 
' The course of study in the various faculties differs somewhat in length. The 
faculty of law has a four years’ course, and the degree of doctor of law is conferred. 
A two years’ course leads to a diploma of solicitor or notary. Attendance at the 
bar for two years and a special practical examination are required of those who 
desire to exercise the legal profession as attorney-at-law or solicitor. The curricu- 
lum of the faculty of literature and philosophy is of four years, and graduation 
therefrom entitles to the degree of doctor in literature and philosophy. After com- 
pletion of a two years’ course the student may obtafn a certificate enabling him to 
teach literature in the three lower classes of the ‘“ginnasi,” and in the technical 
schools. The faculty of mathematics, physics and natural sciences has a four years’ 
course, the studies of the first two years admitting to the schools of applied 
engineering. A completion of the entire course entitles the graduate to one of the 
four degrees, viz: Doctor of mathematics, of physics, of chemistry, of natural 
sciences. Students of these three faculties, if they have attended the annexed 
school, are qualified to receive a certificate as teacher in the secondary schools. A 
six years’ course is found in the faculty of medicine, and its completion leads to the 
degree of doctor in medicine and surgery, which permits the free practice of the 
medical profession. On completion of the fourth year of study the students are 
expected to regularly attend the clinics. 
The schools of pharmacy after four years of study give an apothecary’s diploma, 
which is required before becoming a pharmacist; one of these years must be 
passed in a drug store. Another year of study entitles one to the degree of doctor 
in chemistry and pharmacy. The course of study in the veterinary schools annexed’ | 
to the universities! is of four years, and graduation therefrom entitles to the degree 
of veterinary surgeon and the practice of the profession. 
In the schools for obstetrics annexed to the universities the two years’ course of 
instruction is both theoretical and practical. The practical course requires one 
year; the theoretical two years of study. On completion of the course a certificate, 
enabling one to practice as a midwife,? is accorded. g 
The length of the courses in the superior institutes varies according to the studies 
to be pursued. Admission to the school of applied engineering requires a two years’ 
course in the faculty of mathematics in a university and the passing-of a required 
examination, Completion of the three years’ course in the engineering school, if 
the examination is passed, entitles to the degree of civil or industrial engineer or 
architect, with permission to practice the chosen profession. During the course 
practical experiments and excursions to the most important industrial or mechanical 
establishments or to some public works are of great advantage to the students. The 
superior institute for the perfecting of higher studies, in Florence, has courses of 
study similar to the faculties of literature and philosophy, mathematical and 
natural sciences, medicine, and surgery, and confers corresponding academical 
degrees. The academy of science and literature in Milan has a curriculum similar 
to that of a university faculty in literature and philosophy. Completion of the four 
years’ course entitles to the doctor’s degree. 
The instruction in the universities and the superior institutes is given by pro- 
fessors appointed after a competition among persons who have obtained the degree 
of university doctor in the corresponding science or department or after due   
1A similar course is found in the veterinary schools of Milan, Naples, and Turin.

  examination. But if a man is celebrated through his publications, discoveries 
or scholarship in the special branches which he desires to teach, such a person 
may be appointed by the Government without the competition. There are three 
kinds of professors: The ordinary, the extraordinary, and the “‘professori incari- 
eati.” These last mentioned professors sometimes gravitate into the extraordi- 
nary professorships and then again become ordinary professors, The ordinary 
professors are sometimes required to give other instruction than that which comes 
into their especial line. There are also private teachers (liberi docenti) who deliver 
lectures on special subjects appertaining to higher culture. They are also allowed 
to instruct in the regular university course, and they may have the same legal rights 
as other professors, if the course of instruction is equally extensive. Governmental 
recognition of them is obtained after an examination indicating their scientific 
experience. University students pay a registration fee, annual tuition fees, fees for 
graduation, and for the diploma required by each faculty or each special course of 
study. * z 
~ There are fees in the superior institutes in accordance with special laws. The 
fees in the free universities are determined by the authorities, which have a con- \ 
trolling action in the administration of their affairs. 
ACADEMIES OF SCIENCE AND LITERATURE, 
The following information, courteously furnished by Signor Bodio, serves to com- 
plete the presentation made by Professor Oldrini: 
Among the principal academies which aim to promote original studies and research 
in history and science, and among which are some receiving annual subsidies from 
the Government, may be named—the Royal Academy of the Lincei, in Rome; the 
Royal Lombard Institute of Science and Literature, in Milan; the Royal Institute of 
Science, Literature, and Art, in Venice; the Royal Academy of Sciences, in Turin; the 
Royal Society of Sciences, in Rome; the Pontomiana Academy and Royal Society, in 
Naples; the Royal Academy of the ‘Studio di Bologna.” 
The ‘‘Lincei” in Rome dates from 1603 and was founded by Frederic Cesi, a friend 
of Galileo Galilei. Some ofthe noteworthy scientific discoveries of the seventeenth 
century, originating in experimental methods in physics and natural sciences, ema- 
\ nated from this academy. The Academy of the Crusca, created in 1587, has as spe- 
cial aim the study of the Italian language and the formation of a dictionary of that 
language. Committees and local societies (“Deputazioni di Storia Patria” and 
“Societa di Storia Patria”) aim to promote historical research, to collect and pub- 
lish ancient documents bearing upon the political life, customs, and traditions of 
each part of the country, An Italian Historical Institute, founded in 1883 in Rome, 
is composed of men named by these committees and societies, or by the Government. > 
The Italian Historical Institute, the committees! and societies for the study of the 
history of the fatherland, receive annually subsidies from the State. Among the 
various scientific associations for the promotion of special branches of knowledge, 
are the medical? academies, the societies of natural? science, the anthropological +

the opening of new fields for Italian industry and trade, 
FINE ARTS AND MUSIC. 
The Government supports 15 institutions for instruction in fine arts (architecture, 
painting, and sculpture). These “ accademie e scuole di belle arti”—some of them 
very ancient, others more modern—are maintained and administered by the State. 
Being recognized as corporate bodies they may receive legacies, and have their own 
incomes. Additional to these governmental institutions are other autonomous insti- 
tutions. as 
Instruction in the fine arts is given also in some academies of science and litera- 
ture! and in academies of art.? 
The Bologna Institute of Fine Arts was established September 1, 1803; the Carrara 
Academy, September 26, 1769; the Florence Institute in 1350; Lucca Institute, March 
5, 1850; the Schools of Fine Arts, in Massa, in 1835, established as an Institute in 1851; 
the Milan Academy, on January 22, 1776; the Modena Institute of Fine Arts was opened 
as a school of fine arts on January 3, 1786; on September 18, 1790, it had developed into 
the ‘Atestina Academy of Fine Arts; the Naples Institute, established in 1822; that 
of Palermo, on November 20, 1879; that of Parma, on December 2, 1757; the School 
of Drawing for Workingmen in Reggio-Emilia, in 1803; the ane of ing Arts in 
Rome, on January, 1874; the Abertina Academy, in Turin, in 1652, remodeled in 1833; 
the Institute of Fine Arts of Venice, in 1808, and called at that date the Academy 
of Fine Arts; the Institute of Fine Arts of the Marches, in Urbino, remodeled under 
its present title on January 6,1861. The statistics of these institutions of fine arts in 
1890-91 were: Teachers, 177; students, 3,729. 
There are five institutes for instruction in music which receive governmental 
subsidies. There are also a few institutes and schools established by private citi- 
zens, such as the Musical Institute of Pesaro (founded by Rossini), and that of- 
Rome. The total statistics for 1890-91 were: Teachers, 160; women students, 305; 
men, 575; grand total, 870 (vide p. 336), 
? MUSEUMS, ANTIQUITIES, AND NATIONAL MONUMENTS, 
The regulations which govern the conservation of antiquities and national monu- 
ments are referred to by Signor Bodio as follows: In order to preserve the many 
treasures that Italy possesses there are many museums and galleries of sculpture and 
painting under governmental charge; the communes, corporations, and some private 
individuals possess similar collections. The Government maintains, and has general 
supervision of the ancient ruins, edifices, monuments, etc., which appertain to the 
history of art, or of the nation; the provinces and communes care for other monu- 
ments which are not of a national character. Each subdivision and district.of Italy 
has its committees (commissariati per Y antichitd e belle arti) appointed by the 
Government, its governmental inspectors, and local boards (commissioni conserva- 
trici per l’ antichita e betle arti) appointed in part by the Government and in part 
by provincial and communal authority. The duties of these boards and inspectors 
are to supervise and maintain antiquities, monuments, and galleries. 
LIBRARIES. 
There are numerous libraries in Italy, many of which. are important factors in 
advancing culture on account of the valuable collections of books and manuscripts 
which they possess. ‘2 
    
1 The Academy Petrarea, of Arezzo; the Virgilian Academy, of Mantua; the Peloritana Academy, of 
Messina; the Academy of Science and Literature, of Padua. 
2The Academy of St. Luke, in Rome, is one of the most ancient.
-P-A-G-E-29
  
REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. XXVIL 
The libraries belong either to the Government, the provinces, the communes, or 
they may be adjuncts of charitable institutions, institutes of science and literature, 
associations, or schools. Among the governmental libraries are the ‘“ Biblioteche 
autonome,” those annexed to universities, to special schools, or to institutions of 
science andart. The “ Biblioteche autonome” are self-governing, so-called national 
libraries, which receive copies of all books published in Italy. The Victor Eman- 
uel Library, in Rome, and the National Library in Florence, are the most important. 
Then there are other governmental libraries which bear the title governmental 
only; some of these are annexed to the universities. The Government annually 
endows such libraries and gives extra subsidies if required. 
The provincial and communal libraries are maintained from provincial and com- 
munal funds, although many of them have special funds and donations, as have 
some governmental libraries, the income of which is added to their annual endow- 
ment. 
In order to increase the means of educating the people, libraries have been estab- 
lished, of late years, by societies for the promotion of education. Circulating libraries, 
also, aid in instructing the people. The latest statistics of libraries in Italy are as —

1,067,462; the readers, 943,903. . ' 
PUBLICATIONS AND THE PRESS. 
The publications appertaining to science and literature printed in Italy in 1892 
were more than 10,000. Divided according to subject-matter, they may be enumer- 
ated as follows: Instruction and education, 365; school books, 745; philology, his- 
tory, and literature, 325; philosophy and theology, 79; modern literature, 1,167;

GENERAL, PROVINCIAL, AND MUNICIPAL SCHOOL ADMINISTRATION. 
Although the communes and provinces participate in the expenditure for educa- 
tion, yet the supervision and direction of educational institutions is vested in the 
State. The State, or Government, endeavors to extend education by means of schools 
and by encouraging the establishment of all such institutions as are useful to the 
intellectual life of the people, such as academies of science and literature, libraries, 
museums, institutes of fine arts,and musical conservatories. The preservation of 
national monuments serves towards this end also. The ministry of public instruc- 
tion is in general charge of education; its attributes are determined by law of 1859, 
with modifications and laws of later date. The minister of ptblic instruction is 
assisted by a superior council of education (consiglio superiore della pubblica istru- 
zione), to which, in accordance with fixed laws, all matters of educational legislation 
or administration must be submitted by the minister. He in turn may question the 
council in regard to all subjects appertaining to his department of public affairs. 
The minister of public instruction exercises his authority throughout the provinces 
by means of a body of school superintendents. (provveditore agli studi), one for 
each province. They have general supervision of elementary and moral instruction, 
of secondary and classical instruction, and the technical schools. 
The direct inspection of elementary schools is intrusted to the school inspectors 
(one for each district), who are under the direetion of the superintendent, or prov- 
yeditore. For the elementary schools there is also another local official, a ‘‘delegato 
scolastico,” who is appointed by the Government, and who has in each commune, or 
groups of communes, the supervision of elementary schools, especially as regards 
the extending of educational facilities, the moral and physical education of the 
children, and the application of the law of compulsory education. This scholastic 
deputy is an aid of the school inspectors, and his duties are gratuitously performed. 
The technical institutes and the institutés of the merchant marine are under the 
direct charge of the minister of public instruction. Each of these institutes has a 
director (preside), who is in charge of the scholastic affairs and discipline. To aid 
in the administration of these institutes there is a council of supervision (giunta di 
vigilanza), composed of members named by the state, province, and commune 
where the institute is situated. The universities are governed by rectors and aca- 
demical councils, yet are under the supreme control of the ministry of public 
instruction. The other institutes, which are dependent upon the Government, such 
as academics, libraries, museums, etc., have their own administrative officers, who 
are assisted by committees of members appointed by local corporations and by the 
Government. 
Many of the higher special or professional schools are not in affiliation with the 
ministry of public instruction, but with that of agriculture, industry, and com- 
merce. Asan adjunct to this ministry, to aid in extending agricultural and indus- 
trial education, there are two councils—the one for agricultural development, the 
other for industrial or professional training. The various professional schools are 
directly governed by councils or committees, appointed partly by the Government, 
partly by provinces and communes, as-all assist in defraying the expenses. 
° 
MAINTENANCE OF AND EXPENDITURES FOR EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS. 
  The expenditures for education are borne partly by the Government, in part by 
the provinces and communes.. Charitable organizations contribute towards educa- 
tional expenses either by direct maintenance of elementary or secondary schools or 
by assistance to students; other lceal organizations participate in the expenses for 
special school punposes. The maintenance of elementary schools is entirely assumed

       by the communes, but if the necessary funds are lacking, aid is given in the shape 
of governmental subsidies, so that the compulsory-education act may be enforced. 
Elementary teachers receive pensions from funds annually set aside for that purpose 
by the Government. In accordance with special laws the Government maintains 
colleges for women for both elementary and complementary instruction. 
The Government supports the normal schools as far as the director's salary, free 
tuition, and cost of scientific material is concerned. The provinces and eommunes 
defray the building expenses and the purchase of the apparatus. The ‘‘licei” are 
majntained by the Government as regards professors’ salaries and expenditures for 
scientific material; the remaining expenses are met by the communes. The “gin 
nasi” are maintained by the communes; in some provinces, in accordance with 
special laws, they are supported by the Government. 
The cost of maintaining the technical schools is defrayed by the communes, the 
Government, however, paying half of the professors’ salaries. The technical institutes 
and those of the merchant marine are maintained by the joint contributions of 
Government, provinces, and communes, the Government bearing about half the costs. 
The schools of agriculture and the industrial trade and professional schools are sup- 
ported by united contributions from the communes and boards of trade of the towns 
where they are situated; the Government adds its quota by establishing and in part 
maintaining them. The maintenance of the universities and superior institutes 
depends almost entirely upon the Government, but, in accordance with special reg- 
ulations, the provinces, communes, and boards of trade unite with the Government 
in means of improvement of such institutions. The Government, provinces, and com- 
munes bear the expenses of maintaining and adding to the collection of antiqui- 
ties, of maintaining galleries, museums, monuments, and of increasing the academies 
and institutes of fine arts, libraries, ete. Assistance is also given in the form of 
prizes, bursaries, and other aid to students desiring to pursue a course of study and 
otherwise unable to do so.

   XXX ° REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
Total annual expenditures by the Government and local authorities may be reck- 
oned as amounting to 122,948,809 lire, or $23,729,200. 
The expenditures for school purposes by charitable organizations as presented in 
the statistics of such organizations for 1880, the latest given, amounted to 5,429,476 
lire, or $1,047,888,- In addition to the aid given by corporations and boards of 
trade, there are workingmen’s associations, which participate more especially in 
the industrial side of elementary instruction. From these sources, as is stated 
by Signor Bodio, about 615,000 lire, or $118,695, was expended in 1890-91.

Remarks upon the tables. 
a The following tables present in detail the common school statistics of 
the different States, mainly for the school year 1890-91. Several States 
- failed to supply this office with figures in season for publication in the 
present report. The totals given for the United States and its several 
geographical divisions are therefore subject to future correction. 
It is frequently the case in the tables of the printed reports of State 
superintendents that one or more counties have been excluded through 
their not having made any report to the State superintendent. This 
complete omission is equivalent to giving such counties zero in footing
-P-A-G-E-35
STATE. COMMON SCHOOL SYSTEMS. ’ ‘ é 2 
up the totals, and explains in many cases the great falling off in school 
attendance, expenditure, etc., that appears to have suddenly taken place 
in this or that State. 
Whenever practicable the figures for these missing counties have been 
supplied by the bureau, using the latest returns available or some reli- 
able estimate. This gives totals for the State, which, though not exact, 
are considerably nearer the truth than if the missing counties were 
given 0. ' 
Care has been taken to make the tables as correct and useful as possi- 
ble, though ‘some imperfections have resulted from delayed returns. 
Attention has been paid to tabulating only percentages and percapitas 
which are of value in estimating the relative educational condition of 
different localities, omitting those which are misleading, as well as 
those which possess no special significance. The observations made 
upon this subject and upon: statistical methods generally are com- 
mended to the attention of those interested in such matters; the design 
has been to make some contribution toward the accurate and uniform 
compilation of school statistics. :

a POPULATION AND SCHOOL POPULATION. 
__ Although the census of 1890 has gathered the material for determin- 
ing the number of children of each year of age in the several States, 
the results have not been published at the date of preparation of this 
report. 
A preliminary census bulletin has been issued, however, giving for 
each State the number of persons 5 to 18 years of age in 1890; this age 
has been considered by the Census Office for several decades past as 
the “school age,” and has been, therefore, adopted in this report as 
furnishing the only enumeration of children that is uniform in all the 
States as regards the ages included, and extending from 1870 to the 
__. _ present time. 
The number of persons of each individual year of age was not pub- 
lished in the census reports until 1880. 
The figures in column 3 of the preceding table are based on those of 
‘the census bulletin referred to, but have been reduced in most cases to 
the date 1891, as have also been those of the total population in column 2 
The total population of the United States for the year under con- 
sideration-{1890~91 for most of the States) is found to have been 
63,521,196, 
 
-P-A-G-E-37
   STATE COMMON SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 
Of this number, 18,799,864 were between 5 and 18 years of age.- 
Since allthese were of asuitable age for attending the common schools 
(elementary or secondary), and since in point of fact nearly all the 
common-school attendance was drawn from them, they may be called 
the “ school jopulation.” 
The proportion of the school population to the total population has 
undergone a marked change during the past twenty years, as may be 
seen from an examination of columns 4, 5, and 6 of the table. In 1870 
the school population of the United States formed 31.27 per cent of the 
total; in 1880, 30.04 per cent, and in 1890, 29.61 per cent. g 
There has been going on, then, a constant decrease in the number of — 
children as compared with the total population. 
This decrease has mainly occurred in the north and west; in the 
North Atlantic and North Central States the decrease in the proportion 
of children has been about 3 per cent since 1870 (from 28,30 to 25.39 in 
the former and from 32.40 to 29.33 in the latter). 
In the Southern States, as a whole, on the contrary, the proportion 
of children, always large when compared with the North (now about 
one-third larger), has undergone some increase since 1880, so that now _ 
it is larger than in 1870. 
The proportion of children in individual States exhibits marked con- 
trasts, even when the States are contiguous. New York is the most 
populous State in the Union, but Pennsylvania has the largest number. 
of children between 5 and 18 (1,498,300). In the former State the pro- 
portion of school population is 24.57 per cent, in the latter, 27,92 per — 
cent. This circumstance may throw somé light on the fact that the 
reported average attendance of -pupils in Pennsylvania has for many 
years considerably exceeded that of New York.” 
In South Carolina 37 persons out of every 100 are children of school 
age; at the other extreme stands Montana, with only 18 out of 100, or 
less than one-half the number in South Carolina, 
The relation between the school population and the number of naa 
(column 7) in the different States is yet more marked. Taking the same — 
two States, South Carolina and Montana, for instance, there are found — 
in the former 433,800 school children to 239,100 male adults; in the lat- 
ter, 26,960 school children to 73,870 male adults. . 
These facts are of importance in comparing the status of the schools 
of different localities, though they have not received from educational 
writers the attention they merit. Some of the considerations they give 
rise to are pointed out in the following pages, especially i in treating of 
school revenue (or support) on page 24, 5 : 
The school population classified by age. 
As has been already remarked, the age tables of the Eleventh Cen- 
sus have not yet been published. Using the percentages of 1880, the 
number of children of each year of age in the school population of 1891 ~ 
may be approximately stated as follows:

    idobiation to census enumerators i is, thion it ignorance or ceuGueeas 
to give children’s ages roughly or by guesswork, i in even numbers rather 
than odd, and especially in round numbers. Hence we find more chil- 
dren of 6 years of age than either 5 or 7, and so with 8,10, 12, ete.y the

   STATE, COMMON SCHOOL SYSTEMS. — 
s ENROLLMENT, : ie 
Whole number of pupils (enrollment).—AS will be seen by the foregoing” 
table (column 5), therewere in 1890-91 (or according.to the latest infor- _ 
, mation obtainable) 12,966,061 different pupils enrolled in the common 
schools of the United States; a gain in one year of 342,994, or 2.72 per* 
cent.! 
This enrollment was 20.41 per cent of the population, as against 17.82 
per cent in 1870, 19.67 per cent in 1880, and 20.27 per cent in 1890. 
The public school enrollment, therefore, has continued without inter- 
mission since 1870 to gain upon the population. ae 
The proper test of school attendance.—It has been shown in previous 
reports, however, that the public school enrollment in certain of the 
Northern States has not increased as rapidly as the population, but 
attention was called to the circumstance that the enrollment might 
nevertheless have increased as fast as the school population, which is 
obviously the proper quantity to make comparison with, since the ratio. 
of the school population to the total population is continually shifting, 
and it is from the school population alone that the public school pupils 
are drawn. What proportion of the children of school age attend 
school is manifestly the proper test of the extent of school attendance, 
not what proportion of children, infants, and adults; the two latter 
classes not supplying any school attendants at all. This becomes more 
apparent when it is borne in mind that the proportion of adults to chil- a 
dren-of school age is five times as great in some States as in others a 
(see Table 9, column 8), thus vitiating all inter-State comparisons of 
enrollment based upon total population by introducing an irrelevant 
factor of uncertain effect. ie 
This may be illustrated by a somewhat analogous example from an- 2 
other field of statistical inquiry: If itis desired to ascertain the number _ 
of bushels of wheat raised per acre in a given State, the total product 
of wheat in bushels is divided by the number of acres planted to wheat, 
not by the total acreage of the State. The proportion of land not 
planted to wheat is very different in different States. 
_ Proportion of school population enrolled—tThe proportion of the 
school population, then, enrolled in the public schools at various epochs — 
is given in columns 8, 9, 10, and 11 of the preceding table. The age 
basis (5-18) is uniform for all the States. 
From this it will be seen that in most of the Northern States east of 
the Mississippi River the proportion of the children of school age en- 
-rolled in the schools has decreased since 1870. This decrease is espe- 
cially notable in New Hampshire, and is large in Connecticut,New York, » 
Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Mlinois. There has also been a considerable 
decrease in Michigan and Mlinois, and a slight decrease in Maine, New 
Jersey, and Minnesota. 
    
1The smallness of the gain in the North Central division (0.79 por cent) is due prin- 
cipally to imperfect reports from Ohio and Indiana.
-P-A-G-E-42
02 ? _ EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
_ The only States in the group in question that show an increase since 
1870 are Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Indiana, and in these the 
~ increase is slight. 
In the Southern States the proportion of the school population who 
are enrolled in School is considerably less than in the Northern (col- 
-umus 8-11).! The division which shows best in this respect is the 
North Central, which has more than 76 per cent of its population 5 
to 18 years of age enrolled in school. E 
Kansas has the largest percentage of its school population enrolled 
in school (87.66), then comes Maine (87.12), Iowa (86.33), and South 
Dakota (81.04). = 
The two States, viz, Massachusetts and Connecticut, which have 
perhaps made the most persistent and systematic efforts to enforce 
compulsory attendance, and in which the conditions regarding density 
of population seem especially to favor such efforts, report only about 72 
per cent of their population 5 to 18 enrolled. This rises only slightly 
above the average for the United States (about 69), and is less than 
that of Tennessee (78.29), or West Virginia (75.71). 
At the other end of the line come Louisiana, with only about one- 
_ third (33.73 per cent), and South Carolina, with less than one-half (48.31 
per cent), of their population 5 to 18 years enrolled in school. 
Why the enroliment has fallen off in New York.—State Superintendent 
Draper, of New York, in attempting to account for the falling off in the 
proportion of the school population enrolled in school in that State 
‘said in his last report: ; 
The most ready suggestion which will be offered in explanation is the organiza- 
tion of church or parochial schools. This explanation seems inadequate. It will 
undoubtedly explain somewhat, but not fully. I am, of course, familiar with the 
extent to which the great. Roman Catholic Church and some other denominations of 
Christians have felt impelled to organize schools under their own auspices. But it 
_ ean hardly be said that the growth of these church schools has been sufficiently reg- 
ular and uniform for forty years to account for the uniform falling off in the attend- 
ance upon the public schools during that time. Moreover, it must be said that non- 
denominational private schools were much more common and much more generally 
attended in former years than now. While, therefore, it is undoubtedly true that 
the organization of church schools will account in some degree for the comparative 
falling off in the attendance upon the public schools, still it is but a partial explana~ - 
tion of the fact. ~ 
Another partial explanation may be found in the fact that records are more com- 
pletely and correctly kept and statistics are more accurate than formerly. It is 
within the knowledge of all connected with the schools that very special attention 
has been given thi§ subject in recent years, with a view to more extended and reli- 
able information upon which to base educational action. Figures are the result of 
investigation rather than of estimates much more generally than in former years, 
and the fact may place the later years in an apparent disadvantage when compared 
with the earlier ones. This, however, is no adequate explanation of the unfortunate 
fact to which the attention of the State is called. 
  
1The proportion of the total population enrolled in the schools is generally greater 
_in the Southern States than in the Northern; but this proportion has been shown to 
be, and is, misleading. 
 
-P-A-G-E-43
attendance upon the public schools does 
‘population is true. It may be said with equal truth that the attendance BOE 
and private schools combined is not as great relatively 
‘The reasons why this is ‘so will appear to all who will inquire, | 
As cities increase in population, the indifferent, unfortunate, anaaiAS v: 
_ and criminal classes increase, not normally and eine but out of propor 
the inerease in population. One thousand persons living in the country w: J 
haye in their number as many persons who must be cared for, directed, and regulatec 
in the interest of the common safety as 1,000 persons living in a crowded city. This 
“facet has vital relations to attendance upon the schools. Yet we have pane little or 
nothing in the way of providing against it. 
Again, there has been much legislation in recent years for the purpose of preve1 
~ ing the employment of children in factories and elsewhere, What is of more con 
quence, the State has provided the machinery for vigorously enforcing this legisla- 
tion. Public officers, in the pay of the State, have traversed its territory through 
allits length and breadth, driving children out of employment. The employers of

14 EDUCATION: REPORT, 1890-91. 
Number oF Days ATTENDED. 
(Table 4.) e 
The total number of days attended by all pupils was 1,129,955,876, 
which gives an average of 60.1 days for‘each person 5 to 18 years of 
age. 
If this were a constant quantity, so that éach child received.on an ayer- 
age60.1 days’ common school instruction annually while passing from his 
fifth to his eighteenth year, he would get all together 781.3 days of 
schooling. This is equivalent to about four years (3.9) of 200 days each, 
and is a time measure of the amount of instruction the public schools 
farnish each person of the population at the present rate. 
The average amount of schooling given for each person 5 to 18 years - 
of age varied the past year (column 3) from 21 days in North Carolina 
and 22.9 in New Mexico to 90.5 in Massachusetts. In the North gen 
- generally, it is about double what it is in the South, owing in part to 
a longer school term and in part to the larger percentage of the school 
population attending school. 
Of the pupils actually enrolled, each one attended on an average 
87.1 days (column 4), 
The average length of time the schools were insession (column 8) was 
_ 185.7 days, an increase of one day over the preceding year, and of 5.4 
day: s over 1879-80. 
Some notable cases of change in the length of the school term are 
recorded in the table. The loss of seven days in Maine is due to the 
diversion of funds to the improvement of schoolhouses and higher sal- 
aries for male teachers. Massachusetts shows a reduction of: eight 
days; this “does not arise,” says State Superintendent Dickinson, 
“from any want of appreciation of the work of the schools, or from any 
“unwillingness to give them liberal support, but rather from the feeling 
that from thirty to thirty-six weeks per year is all the time that can 
be profitably spent in school. And what contributes to this feeling is 
the desire of many families to spend a longer time at the summer 
resorts. To provide for such families, and to avoid the demoralizing 
effects of having a part of the school withdrawn, the summer vacation 
is in many instances prolonged at both ends. The long vacations, 
together with the frequent holidays during the year, seem already to 
have encroached upoh the school time to an undesirable extent.” 
The school term of Pennsylvania shows an increase of 7.6 days, the 
result in part-of increasing the State appropriation from $1,500,000 
to $2,000,000. The effect of the “great appropriation” of $5,000,000 
in 1891 does not yet appear in the statistics. 
, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Texas all largely increased their school 
term in 1890- 91, the latter by sixteen days. On the other hand, Ohio, 
Kansas, and Ganon show a considerable decrease. 
- Observations on ascertaining the average length of school term.—The aggregate num- 
ber of days’ attendance given in the aboye table, when not reported direct by State  
-P-A-G-E-47
     + STATE COMMON SCHOOL SYSTEMS. : Les 
superintendents, has been obtained by multiplying the average daily attendance of — 
pupils by the avcrage length of school termin days. Either of these three quantities 
is thus made a most simple function of the other two, and can be readily obtained 
when the other two are given. ‘Though this relation between these three quantities 
doesnot rigidly subsist in the statistical systems of many of the States, owing to 
diverse methods of computing average attendance and average length of school term, 
yet the assumption thatit does is correct in principle and gives more accurate results 
in practice than any other. Ft 
A practical application is made of this principle in finding the average length ot 
school term of a number of States, as recorded in the summaries of column 8, where 
the aggregate attendance in days in each division and in the United States, is divided 
by the corresponding average daily attendance to get the average length of school 
term in days of each group of States. 
By this method the school term of each State in taking the average isin fact given 
a weight proportioned to theschool attendance of the State, as should be done under 
a correct interpretation of the expression ‘‘average length of school term.” The 
result might more properly be called ‘average length of Sent which is 
essentially what it is desired to know. 
A method in use in some States for finding the average school term of a county, 
for instance, is to weight the different school terms of the towns or districts the 
county is composed of by the number of schools in each; in other words, the total 
number of days (or months) all the schools of a county were kept is divided by the 
total number of schools, to get the average time each one was kept. So in finding ~ 
the average term for the State, the school is taken as the unit instead of the pupil, 
as in the Bureau’s method. When the schools differ much in size (number of pupils), 
as they do in all mixed urban and rural systems, varying from some half dozen to 
five hundred or more pupils each, the average term obtained by this method varies 
considerably from that obtained by the foregoing. The long terms of the large city 
schools not being given their proper weight, the resulting average is toosmall. The 
same objection applies still more forcibly to weighting the school terms of the differ- 
ent counties or towns by the number of school districts in each. 
Still another method is to add together the school terms of the different counties 
or towns, and divide by the number of such counties or towns; i.e., the simple 
arithmetical mean is taken. Smithville, for instance, with its 100 pupils, counts for 
as much in forming the average as the metropolis, with its 100,000. Smithville, 60 
days; metropolis, 180 days; average term of the two, 120 days. This method, if it 
can be so called, gives altogether too short an average term, and nothing can be 
said in defense of it. It is as if, wishing to get the population per square mile of 
Minnesota and Dakota combined, we said, Minnesota, 9.86; Dakota, 0.92; average 
number of persons per square mile in the combined territory (0.92-++-9.86)—2—5.39, _ 
instead of dividing the total population of the two States together by the combined 
area in square miles. - 
The “aggregate number of days attendance ” is a statistical item of the utmost 
simplicity and of great value, about the meaning of which there can be little or no 
difference of opinion, Every teacher’s register that records the number of pupils — 
present each day in any school,as they all presumably do, contains the data for 
ascertaining it for that school for the school year by the simple process of addition, 
or summing up.

STATE COMMON SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 
RECEIPTS OF SCHOOL MONEYS. 
  (Tables 8, 9, and 10.) 
The total receipts of school moneys, as tabulated, foot up to ~ 
$147,915,282. : ve 
Of this sum $8,296,347, or 5.6 per cent of the whole, was the income 
of permanent school funds; $27,631,657, or 18.7 per cent, was derived 
from State taxes; $100,358,635, or 67.8 per cent, from local taxes; and 
$11,628,643, or 7.9 per cent, from sources other than the foregoing. 
More than two-thirds of all the money expended for common schools 
in the United States is raised by local taxation. Only about one- 
eighteenth is derived from the income of permanent school funds, 
and less than one-fifth from State taxes. These proportions vary 
greatly, however, in different parts of the Union, as will be seen by 
examination of Table 10. i 
Theamount received from State taxes shows an increase of $2,393,088. 
Pennsylvania and Georgia contribute largely to this increase. The 
_ State appropriation of Pennsylvania was increased in 1889 from — 
$1,500,000, at which figure it had stood for some years, to $2,000,000.! 
The large increase in the case of Georgia is due to the assessing of a 
half-mill tax (increased to 1 mill in 1890) and to the allotting to the 
common. schools of all taxes arising out of taxable property in the. 
State in excess of $360,000,000. Georgia schools received from the 
former source in 1889, $165,000; from the latter, $50,576. 
Local taxes.—The aggregate increase of local taxation amounted to 
$4,227,519. The large increase in the local tax of Maine ($137,149) was 
for the purpose of first supply of free text-books. Illinois gained 
nearly $2,000,000, an increase in one year in local taxes more than equal 
to the total amount raised from all sources in any Southern State except 
Maryland, Kentucky, and Texas. New York lost over a million dollars 
in local taxes, yet still raised nearly twice as much as all the Southern 
States put together. 
These facts emphasize the difference in the sources of support of the 
schools North and South. In the latter section the conditions created 
by legislation are too often unfavorable, sometimes even antagonistic, 
to the development of the principle of local taxation for schools. 
Relative amount raised by the several States.—In Table 9 the school 
revenue of each State has been compared with the number of male per- 
sons over 21 years of age (i. ¢., with the number of taxpayers, or per- 
sons from whom in the main the school revenue is drawn), and also 
with the school population (é. ¢., with the number of persons for whose — 
benefit it is raised). These are significant ratios, whereas the revenue 
per capita of population has no bearing on the matter. See remarks 
on p. 9.

1The legislature of 1891 made a further increase of the State appropriation, rais- 
ing it to the munificent sum of $5,000,000. 
 
-P-A-G-E-56
“24 ; EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
Few persons have any idea of the extent to which the relative num- 
ber of taxpayers! and school population varies in different localities. 
- In some parts of the Union there are three, four, and even five times as 
many taxpayers to the hundred children as in others. The bearing 
of this upon the ease or difficulty of raising funds for schools is obvi- 
ous, and it may be said that this hitherto almost unnoticed cireum- 
stance serves in no small measure to account for the backward condi- 
tion of public education in certain sections, especially in some States 
_ of the South. An inspection of column 8, Table 9, will make this 
apparent. 
In the United States at large, on the average, there are 91.4 taxpay- 
ers to provide the means of education for each 100 children 5 to 18 
years of age. In the South Central States, however, there are only 
65.9 adult males to 100 children, while in the States of the western 
division there are 156.7. 
Taking individual States, it will be seen that in South Carolina 100 
children have only 55 adult males (three-fifths, or 33, of whom more- 
over are colored) to provide the means of education, for them, while in 
Montana there are 274 adult males to educate an equal number of chil- 
dren. That is to say (assuming that wages, prices of material, etc., are 
identical in the two States), in order to duplicate the educational condi- 
tions of Montana, each individual taxpayer of South Carolina would 
be subject to pay, on the average, five times the amount the taxpayer 
of Montana is obliged to pay. 
_ These are the extremes, but analogous conditions prevail, in a some- 
what less degree, in the Southern States generally, as compared with 
the Northern. ‘ 
Examining the actual amounts raised per taxpayer and per child of 
school age (columns 6 and 7), it will be seen that Montana raises $5.85 
per taxpayer, which furnishes $16.02 for each child of school age; 
Texas, on the other hand, raises a larger sum per taxpayer ($6.55), 
but has as a result only $4.48 for each child of school age. In other 
_ words, each dollar paid in Montana goes as far in effective work in 
supporting the public schools as $4 in Texas. 
Mississippi, after raising per taxpayer about half what Nevada does, 
has only about one-eighth as much as the latter State for each child of 
school age. 
_ In the light of these facts, and considering in addition that a large 
proportion of the already comparatively few adults in the South are 
- colored people with a minimum of property, it can not but be a matter 
_ of satisfaction that public education has made such progress in the 
South since the war as has actually been the case. Raising per tax- 
payer (counting in white and black alike) about one-half, and realizing 
from the proceeds from one-third to one-fifth of what the Nortlt has 
per child of school age, that section enrolls nearly as large a propor-

STATE COMMON SCHOOL SYSTEMS. Hes abe 
tion of its school population (Table 2, column 11), and has a’ school 
term about two-thirds as long as is held in the North (Table 4, column 
8). 
Beneficial results of a State tax. —Publie schools are their own best — 
recommendation. It has been the almost universal experience that 
where once established they have continually grown in the public 
esteem. When the children who have been educated mainly in State- 
supported or State-prescribed schools become the fathers of a succeed- 
ing generation, they have a liyely sense of the benefits that were con- 
ferred upon them by the public. schools, and demand and voluntarily 
provide increased privileges for their own children. Thus State com- 
pulsion and support pave the way for local endeavor. In Massachu- 
setts, a State whose people have so long felt the influences of public 
schools, 98 per cent of the ample school revenues are raised by what 
is essentially voluntary taxation. The remaining 2 per cent comes 
chiefly from a State fund so distributed as to assist the poorer towns 
and aid in equalizing the burden of taxation, this being the office of a 
State tax or fund in a well-established system 
State Superintendent Edwards, of Illinois, records a very instructive 
experience bearing upon this subject. ‘In 1855,” he says, “to ‘induce ~ L 9 1 
the districts to tax themselves at all the State offered a bounty of 
nearly $2 for every dollar thus voluntarily raised. In that year one 
county raised by taxation $1,737.04 and received by distribution $4,- 
917.25. In this same county at the present time the total withdrawal 
of the State distribution would probably affect the school interest very 
little. In 1887 for every dollar distributed by the State the districts 
themselves, by voluntary election, raised a little more than $5.03. 
Measured by this standard may we not say that the popular interest 
in education, the real love of the free schools in the hearts of the peo- 
ple, increased tenfold in thirty-two years?” | 
_ Progress in local taxation in the South—It can scarcely be doubted 
that the few Southern States which yet do not make any general pro-— 
vision for local taxation, or at most some provision which is practically 
inoper: ative, will change their policy in this respect in the near' futur oS 
and will cease requiring communities to procure a special act of legis- 
lature to enable them to tax themselves for schools, as is now the Cees   
with several of them. The Alabama Educational Association in 1890 
petitioned “for such amendment of our State constitution as will au- 
thorize any desired local taxation that will increase the efficiency of 
our common schools; provided that such taxes be voted upon only by 
taxpayers.” Also State Superintendent Harris says in his 1891 report ie 
that “there is a growing indorsement of local taxation for public 
schools.” 
The North Carolina law contains certain provisions for voluntary 
local taxation, but they are “so restricted that they have not proved 
of any advantage. They should be amended so that it will be less - 
  € 
     
-P-A-G-E-58
        EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
‘ difficult to get to a vote,” says State Superintendent Finger, “and so 
that a larger amount can be voted upon.” In accordance with this 
recommendation, the amount that could be voted was slightly increased 
by the legislature in 1891, but it is still small and the law clumsy in 
execution. 
The South Carolina legislature enacted a general local tax Jaw in 
1888, which, though so cumbersome as to be of practically little value, 
yet indicates progress in public opinion upon the subject. The diffi- 
culties are of the same nature as with the North Carolina law; the 
trustees of school districts can act in the matter of levying a local tax 
only upon the petition of a majority of resident freeholders, and then _ 
must put the question to the vote of the property-owners. Only a few 
districts have taken advantage of thislaw. State Superintendent Rice 
in his 1894 report calls for a more practical law: 
The act of 1888 should be amended and made more easily operative. There should 
be a general act authorizing and requiring the county commissioners of each county 
to submit the question, at each general election, to the qualified voters of the county, 
as to whether or not more than 2 mills shall he levied, etc. 
As regards Texas, State Supt. Cooper reports (1890): 
The law framed in pursuance of the constitutional amendment of 1883 authorizing 
local taxation, throws many obstacles in the way of the levy of local taxes, while 
the true spirit of the law should be to facilitate as far as possible such levy, even if 
it should not absolutely require it. The law, as it stands now on our statute books, 
is distinctly behind public sentiment in this State, and ought to be amended so as 
to allow the people to vote each year, in every school district which has not voted 
a tax, on the question of levying a tax until such tax shall be voted. * * * 
Realizing the necessity of general local taxation to the development of an efficient 
system of public schools,I haye deemed it my duty during the past two years to 
use every means in my power to bring the question of levying a local school tax 
to the attention of local officers and others interested in the progress of public 
schools; * * * 
In spite of all the limitations of the constitution and the law and the obstruction 
thrown in the way of the levy of local taxes by the law as it stands, progress has 
- been made in the levy of local school taxes. * * * It is probable that the num- 
ber of districts which have voted local taxes during the past twelve months is about 
double the number which had voted the tax prior to that time and subsequent to 
the adoption of the constitutional amendment of 1883. This is a remarkable record 
when the fact is considered that the obstructions to the levy of a local tax, resulting 
from errors in the laws on this subject, are in themselves sufficient to prevent most, 
districts from making any effort; and it demonstrates the fact that a simple, sensible 
law providing for local taxation would be welcomed by the great body of the people 
of Texas. 
A weak point in exclusively local taxation—The extent to which local 
taxation is carried in Massachusetts (98 per cent of the school revenue 
being derived from local taxes) brings into special prominence the princi- 
pal defect of this system of school support; i. ¢., the great inequality in 
the tax rate of the different towns. Thus in 1890-91 Boston, with a tax 
rate of less than 2 mills, was able to appropriate $21.92 for each child 
5 to 15 years of age, while Colerain, with a tax rate of 5.4 mills, was 
able to appropriate only $7.71 per child. These inequalities (which are 
 
-P-A-G-E-59
  STATE COMMON. SCHOOL SYSTEMS, =~ ag 
nearly paralleled in other States) are glaring and have led those inter- ~ 
ested in thematter to introduce a bill into the legislature “to change the 
present system of support of the public schools so that the rate of school 
taxation shall be uniform throughout this State. This is to be done by 
including the amount necessary for schools in the State tax, and dis- 
tributing it among the different towns in proportion to the number of 
public school children in such towns.” [Journal of Mducation, March 
10, 1892, ~ 
While the Southern States, therefore, are moving in the direction of 
voluntary local taxation, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania (see above), and 
other Northern States, saving experienced the ills of too exclusively 
local taxation, are going in the opposite direction with the main purpose 
in view of equalizing the tax rate and helping the poorer communities 
out of a general State fund. An. equilibrium between State and local 
taxation will finally be struck, and the most advantageous proportions 
of each determined by experience according to the necessities of each 
individual case. The object in view will be to utilize the benefits and 
reduce to a minimum the defects of each, 
The tax rates of different States can not be compared with each other.— 
On account of the great diversity in the bases of assessment of prop- 
erty in the different States, a comparison of tax rates does not furnish 
any indication as to how light or heavy a tax may be. In some States 
property is assessed at only about une-third of its real value, in others — 
at two-thirds or more; and a tax rate of 2 mills on the dollar in one 
locality may be quite as severe as 4 mills in another. It has on a like 
ground not been deemed best to continue in these tables the compari- 
- son of the school expenditure with assessed valuation.

loss—The total amount       
147,000,000. expended for common 
‘ - schools in 1890-91 was $146,800,163, an increase in one year of over 
This i is more than double the annual rate 
of increase of the population, and indicates how fast the school expend- 
iture has been gaining upon the population the past year. 
This is also shown in the expenditure per capita of population (‘Table 
é In 1889-90 the expenditure for-common schools per capita of 
population was $2.24; in 1890-91 it had advanced to $2.31, reaching a 
much higher point than ever before. In 1879-80 it was only $1.56. It 
has thus increased 50 per cent in eleven years, while the actual gross 
expenditure has nearly doubled in the same period, having increased 
The States of the North Central Division expended for common 
_ Schools in 1890-91 more than all the States of the Union did as late as 
* 1869- 70, so rapid has progress been in this particular. 
The greatest rate of gain during the past year has been made in the 
States of the Western Division (Table 12). 
expenditure for schools increased over one-fifth (21.94 per cent), while 
the expenditure for schoolhouse; grounds, etc., increased over one: In these States the total

‘STATE COMMON SCHOOL SYSTEMS. | 
  The State of Washington shows a phenomenal increase. In that 
State the expenditure for houses and grounds was more than trebled 
the past year, and the total expenditure more than doubled. _ 
The Southern States, in general, show a very gratifying increase of 
‘total expenditure, nearly10 per centon an average. The expenditure for 
schoolhouses and grounds shows a net gain of 21 per cent in the South 
Atlantic States and 23 per cent in the South Central States. The actual 
amount expended for these purposes in that section is still small, how- 
ever. Hither New York or Pennsylvania expends more for school- 
houses and grounds than all the States of the two Southern divisioxs 
taken together, and Illinois nearly as much; 
The gain in the permanent expenditure of the South Atlantic States, 
it must be noted, is due to the increased’ activity in building in three 
States, viz, Maryland, West Virginia, and Georgia. In all the other 
States of that division except Delaware there has been a decrease. , 
The Northern Atlantic and Central States also show a net decrease 
in the amount expended for buildings and grounds of about $2,000,000, 
or about 9 per cent. Of the 21 States of which these two divisions are 
composed, 15 show a falling off in this class of expenditure. 
The total increase in the amount paid teachers and superintendents 
was $4,932,920, a gain of 5.43 per cent. There were only three States 
showing a decrease in the amount paid for teaching, viz., North Carolina, 
South Carolina, and South Dakota, besides the Territory of New Mexico, 
Expenditure per pupil.—The average amount expended for each pupil 
in attendance (Table 13) was $17.62. This amounthas been gradually 
rising since 1879-80, at which time it was $12.71. 
The expenditure per pupil reaches its maximum in the States and ~ 
Territories of the western division, where it is $34.03, or twice the aver- 
age. How this excessive expenditure is made without a correspond- 
ingly heavy s train on the individual taxpayer will be understood from 
the remarks under the head of “receipts” (p, 24). 
The expenditure per pupil for tuition alone is in the North from two 
to three times what it isin the South. This arises in great part from 
the longer school term in the North. To get the relative cost of the 
schools while they are in session, equal periods of time must be taken. 
Table 14 accordingly has been computed, giving the expenditure 
"per pupil per month, first, for tuition alone, and second, for all pur- 
poses. For tuition alone the two southern divisions pay out on an 
average for each pupil, white and black, each month, $1.24 and $1.30 
respectively; éhe North Atlantic Division, $1.74, and the North Central 
Division $1.76. The difference is small when all the circumstances that 
have been noticed are taken into consideration. 
The total expenditure per pupil per month is greatest in the State of 
Washington, viz, $9.40. This is eleven times what it is in South Caro- 
lina and nearly three times what it is in Massachusetts. If tuition 
alone is considered, Arizona leads with $4.30 per pupil per month, and 
Nevada comes second with $3.84.

      40 _ EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
- North Atlantic Division 
    GENERAL SUMMARY OF PUPILS ENROLLED IN SCHOOLS 
OF ALL GRADES DURING THE SCHOOL YEAR 189091. 
The following table (pp. 43-44) shows the whole number of pupils of 
each grade enrolled in the public and privaté schools of the United 
- States during the school year 1890-91.* 
_ According to the table there were enrolled a grand total of 14,669,069 
pupils, being 23.09 per cent of the population, or nearly one-fourth. 
Grade of pupils.—Of the total number of pupils, 14,146,663, or 96.4 
~ per cent, were receiving elementary instruction (primary and grammar 
grades); 370,435, or 2.6 per cent, were receiving secondary instruction 
(high school grade); and 151,971, or 1.0 per cent, were receiving higher 
instruction. 
The following table shows more in detail aie proportion of pupils 
in each grade.

Only 1 pupil in every 40 is under secondary instruction and 1in 97 
under higher instruction; 964 out of every 1,000 pupils are below the 
high school. This emphasizes the fact that the great multitude of 
children receive in the elementary schools all the school education 
they ever get. ? 
The greatest proportion of secondary and higher students is found 
in the North. In the North Atlantic States 3.2 per cent of the whole 
enrollment, or 1 in 31, are under secondary instruction; in the South 
Central States only 1. 6 per cent, or 1 in 63, about one-half the propor- 
tion of the former group. 
The North Atlantic States also lead in the higher instruction, having 
1.4 per cent of the total enrollment, or 1 in 73, under higher instrue- 
tion; the South Central and Pacific States have 0.8 per cent under 
higher instruction, or about 1 in 130 of the whole number of pupils. 
The-figures of secondary and higher instruction have been made up 
from the reports of individual institutions (high schools, private: see- 
ondary schools, colleges, etc.) to the Bureau; the students in these 
schools have been carefully classified, all the strictly elementary pu- 
  
*Excluding evening schools; art, industrial training, trades, and private business 
schools; schools for the defective, dependent, and delinquent classes, and Indian 
schools. These collectively enroll a considerable number of pupils.

pils being so classed, and those in the preparatory departments of 
colleges being classed as secondary. It is probable that the number 
of secondary pupils is considerably understated, especially in publie 
schools; there are many pupils pursuing secondary studies in un- 
graded or partially graded public schools who were not reached by 
the Bureau. 
Per cent of public and private pupils.—Public schools and institutions — 
enrolled 13,023,406 pupils in 189091, or 88.8 per cent of the total 
enrollment; private schools and institutions enrolled 1,645,663, or 11.2” 
per cent of the total. 
Hight-ninths of all the education in the United States is therefore 
public. The following table gives the proportion of public and private, 
classified by grade and locality:

It will be seen that about nine-tenths of all elementary education is 
public, six-tenths of secondary education, and only three-tenths of 
higher education. The higher the grade, therefore, the more com- 
pletely is education confined to private enterprise. 
In the elementary grade, the largest proportion of private pupils is 
found in the North Atlantic States; more than one-seventh (15.1 per 
cent) of all the elementary pupils in that section arein private schools, 
about double the proportion that is found elsewhere. It is proper to 
state, however, that the statistics of private elementary education are 
very incomplete and fragmentary, even in those States that have made 
the greatest effort to gather information on this subject. 
Of secondary pupils, the South has the largest proportion of private, 
i. ¢., about two-thirds. This is an outgrowth or survival of ante-bel- 
lum conditions, when nearly all secondary education in the South was 
conducted in private schools. In the North Central States, on the 
other hand, where the establishment of public high schools was a part 
of the settled educational policy from the beginning, less than three- 
tenths (29.4 per cent) of the secondary education is given in private 
schools. * ss 
In the South, also, the largest proportion of private higher education 
is found, only about one-fifth there of the higher education being given 
in public schools and institutions. In the States and Territories of the

‘It must be stated that there is no well- defined line Sociaits public 
from private higher institutions. In some of the institutions consid- 
ered as public the State merely gives some pecuniary aid, perhaps with 
a representation on the governing board. 
_A large part of the public higher education is given in eer schools, 
s will be seen from the detailed table. Deducting these there remain.

- Without counting in normal education, then, which is peculiarly a 
State interest, only 13 per cent, or about one-eighth, of the higher edu- 
cation is given in public institutions. In the North Atlantic States the 
proportion is particularly small, being only 6 per cent, and even this 
might be reduced by a more rigid classification. 
_ Actual relation of school enrollment to population—The percentage 
columns of the following table give the proportion of the population 
enrolled in schools of different kinds. 
Elementary schools enrolled ‘22.27 per cent of the population, or 
about 1 person in 4$; secondary schools, 0.53 per cent, or 1 in 171; 
igher institutious, 0.24 per cent, or 1 in 418,

     CHAPTER II. 
SECONDARY EDUCATION IN NEW ZEALAND, 
By Sir Ropert Srout, K. C. M. G.,              
  Formerly minister of education and premier of the colony. 
    Col. Higginson, im his Atlantic Essays, has said: “But as the value 
of a-nation to the human race does not depend upon its wealth or num- 
bers, so it does not depend even upon the disttibution of elementary _ 
knowledge, but upon the high-water mark of its educated mind.” 
If, therefore, New Zealand had only provided a free elementary edu- 
cation, it would have failed in its duty. Though it is a young nation, 
having just celebrated its jubilee, and has only a population of 686, 651 
persons, it has done something for culture. To understand, hower ery 
its position in reference to secondary schools, it will be necessary to 
state briefly what the Government provision has been for elementary 
education and how far that education extends, 
The colony has a system of free, compulsory, and secular education. 
The whole cost of the schools, buildings, staff, maintenance, everything, 
is paid out of the general revenue of the colony. There are no local 
rates nor local contributions. It is true that the committees that have 
the control of the schools may raise, by voluntary subscription, small 
sums to give little adjuncts to the ordinary school buildings or play- 
grounds, but further than this nothing is done by local districts to bear 
the cost:of education. The colony is divided into thirteen education 
districts, and these districts are again divided into school districts. 
There is generally only one school in a district but there may be more. 
The committees are selected by the householders and parents in the 
various school districts, and the committees elect the boards. The com- 
mittees consist of 5, 7, or 9 persons, according to the number of children 
in the district, whilst the boards consist of 9 members holding office _ 
for three years, three retiring annually. The school committees are 
annually elected. There is also a minister of education, with a small 
staff. He, however, only controls and directs; he does not administer 
the act. The main part of administration falls upon the boards. They - 
appoint inspectors and teachers, and they dismiss teachers. The 
appointments or dismissals, however, are only made after consult- 
ing the committee. They erect buildings and look after education

generally. The committees attend to what may be termed the local 
wants of the school and advise the board as to teachers, and they con- 
duct affairs generally in the school district. 
The sum spent last year on primary education by grants to boards 
was £407,494 18s. 11d. There was other.expenditure in the department, 
including the cost of administration, the total education vote being, 
including £34,617 11s. 2d. from reserves, £446,642 8s. 7d. There are 1,272 
state primary schools in the colony, and 3,065 teachers. There are 
various church and private schools, but as these are not aided nor 
‘inspected by the State I omit the statistics referring to them. The 
teachers are graded and hold their certificate from the minister of 
education. There are nine ranks as follows: 
1st rank. 
2d rank. 
3d rank. 
4th rank. 
Sth rank. 
6th rank. 
7th rank. 
8th rank. 
9th rank. 
pebbe ese 
  The letters denote scholarship, while the figures denote success in 
practical teaching. No one can get the highest grade unless he is an 
M. A., with first or second class honors of some university recognized 
by the department. No one can get a B rank unless he is a B. A., and 
no one can get a C rank unless he has passed a certain examination 
equivalent at least to half of a graduate’s degree. The children are 
admitted at 5 and may be kept at school till 15. The compulsory age, 
however, is 7 to 13. In order to show what is taught in elementary 
schools it will only be necessary to copy the sixth and highest stand- 
ard. Itis:

1. Pass subjects. 
Reading.—A book containing extracts from general literature; spelling and dicta- 
tion suited to this stage. 5 
Writing.—The copying of tabulated matter showing bold head lines and marking 
distinctions, such as in letter-press require varieties of type (e. g., the copying of 
these printed standards or of a catalogue showing division into groups). _ 
Arithmetic.—Vulgar and decimal fractions; interest and other commercial rules, 
such as disqount, stocks, partnership, and exchange; the metric system of weights 
and measures, and calculations with pound, florin, cent, and mill; square root and 
simple cases of mensuration of surfaces; mental arithmetic generally. 
Composition.—Essay or letter. 
Geography.—The maps of Asia and North America, Work analogous to the work 
prescribed under the head of ‘‘Map of Europe” for Standard V. The map of the 
world; British possessions, their principal towns and leading products, with some 
knowledge of their relative importance and of the forms of government of the most 
important. Physical geography: The principal causes of difference of climate, with 
illustrations.

   SECONDARY EDUCATION IN NEW ZEALAND. 
_ Drawing.—Blementatry solid geometry and’ free hand drawing from simple models. 
Free hand to be kept up. , All copies made from the flat must be enlarged or reduced, 
and the free-hand drawing must include drawing from simple models, the models 
being the same simple solids as are prescribed for the geometrical drawing of this 
standard, and combinations of the same as found in simple common objects, such as ie 
tables, boxes, books, bottles, buckets, ete., The model drawing and the method of 
teaching it are fully illustrated, in the first grade model drawing in the Colonial 
drawing book issued by authority of the minister of education. The work in prac- 
tical solid geometry is as follows: Plans and elevations of the sphere and cube, the 
cone and pyramid, the cylinder and prism, and slabs. Pupils must be able to give 
correct definitions of these solids and to draw plans and elevations of them, and of 
simple objects based on them, on three planes of projection, and also to draw sec- 
tions of them in any plane perpendicular to the horizontal or to the vertical plane. 4     
                                          
        
    
             
   
     
    
    
    2. Class subjects. 
Grammar.—Complete parsing (including syntax) of simple and compound sen- 
tences (easy), prefixes and affixes, and a few of the more important Latin and Greek 
roots, illustrated by part of the reading book; analysis of easy complex sentences. 
English History.—The period from the death of Elizabeth to the reign of Victoria; 
also the elements of social economy; that is to say, very elementary knowledge of 
such subjects as government, law, citizenship, labor, capital; money, and banking. 
‘The pupils will not be required to learn more than about a dozen dates or to answer 
questions on more than about 25 persons and events for any one standard; nor will 
they be expected to trace the remote causes or even to remember the proximate 
eauses of great events. “What is wanted is a clear view of a few prominent persons 
and salient facts so exhibited as to afford glimpses of the conditions in which our 
ancestors lived at successive periods of our national history and to establish in the 
mind an outline that may be filled in by later reading. A child may have a vivid 
idea of royal authority prone to excess and of the status of a baron and of the 
political insignificance of the common people at the beginning of the thirteenth 
century without knowing the contents of Magna Charta or all the incidents of 
feudal tenure. ° 
Elementary seience.—The instruction in elementary science shall be based on a 
programme prepared by the head teacher, to show the distribution of the subject 
over a three-years’ course of lessons, The programme must include such elementary 
knowledge of physics and such a conception of chemical action as may be imparted 
by the proper use of Prof. Bickerton’s Materials for Lessons in Elementary Science, 
and must also include instruction in elementary mechanics, or in such elementary 
physiology as may be learned from Mrs, Buckton’s Health in the House, or in botany, 
or in some other subject recognized by the inspector as equivalent to one of these; 
provided, however, that if the elements of agricultural knowledge be efticiently * 
taught no other elementary science shall be required for this standard. 
The programme of the elements of agricultural knowledge which may be sub- 
stituted for the programme of elementary science is as follows: 
(a) Object of manuring. General and special manures. Farmyard manure, its : 
composition and value; its liability to ferment; management to prevent loss of = 
value. Vegetable and animal refuse as manures. Green manuring. Plant food 
most frequently wanting in soils. Manures supplying particular kinds of plant 
food. Guanos. Special manures supplying nitrogen. Bone manures. Superphos- 
phate and other mineral manures. Action of lime on the soil. 
(b) The characteristics of the commoner crops, cereals, fodder crops, root crop. 
Habit of growth of a plant. Distribution of roots. Principle of adaptation of 
manures to crops. 
(c) Importance of.good seed. Propagation of plants by cuttings, tubers, bulbs, 
ete. Objects of grafting and praning. Insect pests. Insect changes, as illustrated 
by the life history of common insects. Nature of parasitic fungi,

girls more leniently than that done by the boys in such a degree as would be implied

the year 1853 down to the end of 1876 there existed in New Zealand a 
- modified federal form of government called the Provincial system. 
There were originally six provinces, but these were ultimately enlarged 
- to nine, and it may be well to give the kind of education in existence 
under the Provincial system. It was as follows:

SECONDARY EDUCATION IN NEW ZEALAND. 749. 
The provinces, however, were abolished, and education was made 
colonial, and the system above mentioned was adopted. ‘There was, 
however, no provision in the new colonial act for higher education 
except what was called district high schools, which provided for the 
following: 
The education board of any district on receiving an application in writing from 
the committee may, with the express sanction of the minister previously obtaingd, 
convert any public school in the district into and establish the saine as a district 
high school. 
Every such district high school shall be under the charge of a head master and 
such number of duly qualified masters and assistants as the board shall from time to 
time consider necessary. ~ 
All the branches of a liberal education, comprising Latin and Greek classics, French, 
and other modern languages, mathematics, and such other branches of science as 
the adyancement of the colony and the increase of the population may from time to 
time require, may be taught in such school. For such higher education, fees shall 
be paid by the pupils at such rates as shall be fixed by regulations. 
In every district high school instruction shall also be given in the ordinary 
branches.of education prescribed by this act to be given in public schools. 
It was thought necessary to incorporate some of the secondary schools 
that had been managed by provincial boards. 
As each school is dealt with its mode of management will be men> 
tioned. It will be seen that several of them are similar in their consti- 
tution; that is, they have a board appointed by different bodies, and 
they are quasi public schools. Two or three of the schools that will be 
mentioned are managed by church organizations, but give the higher 
secular instruction. A general system of education was, so to speak, laid 
down in 1877, amalgamating the various provincial systems that had 
been previously in existence, and prescribing auniform mode of providing 
for elementary instruction. There has, however, not been as yet any 
general law for secondary schools. Some of those that now exist were 
founded far back in the early days of the colony, others are of more 
recent creation, but no general plan has been adopted for their man- 
agement or for their endowment. Some have had land grants, some 
have had money endowments, some for a time had annual grants from 
parliament, and some mainly depend upon their fees. : 
There are 24 secondary schools under government inspection. There 
are also what are termed 6 district high schools; that is, elementary 
schools, with higher classes added to them and controlled by a rector. 
It will be well to deal with each school separately, stating its consti- 
tution, its endowment, the subjects taught, the mode of paying the 
teachers, the staff, the buildings, ete. In doing this it will be wise to 
begin at the northern part of the colony, and at the same time it may 
be noted that the islands of New Zealand have a long seaboard stretch- 
ing from 34° latitude south to 48° latitude south, and in such a range 
of latitude there is necessarily a great range of temperature. The cli- 
matic conditions vary considerably, the northern part being almost 
subtropical whilst the southern part is temperate. There is, however, 
ED 91——4 ; .

this to be remarked, that there is no severe winter. Snow is almost 
unknown except on the ranges or in the high lands in the interior. All 
_ along the seaboard, even the most southern, snow never lies. New 
Zealand has been termed by Mr. Fiske, the American writer, “the land 
of the spring time,” and it is not an inaptname. In the far north, 
however, there is quite a warm enough summer. : 
To appreciate properly the standards and education of the secondary 
_ Schools, reference must be made to the New Zealand University, for its. 
- entrance and scholarship examinations furnish the tests for secondary 
sehool work. A short description of the university teaching and ex- 
aminations will appear further on. 
AUCKLAND COLLEGE AND GRAMMAR SCHOOL, 
Beginning in the northern district, there is the Auckland College and 
Grammar School. This institution was first established in 1850 by a 
grant of land made to trustees for a college and grammar school. The 
following principles were to be observed in conducting it: (1) The 
_ branches tanght were to be the English language,mathematics,and Greek 
    and Latin. (2) Evening classes were to be maintained in connection with 
the schools. (3) Persons of all races were to be admitted on equal 
terms. (4) I'ree scholars were to be maintained so far as the fund per- 
mitted. The foundation deed gave certain lands as endowments, and 
in the year 1891 the total rents obtained from landed property amounted. 
to £2,676 17s. 6d. Three hundred pounds was received from reserves 
for the girls’ school in addition. The school was created a corporation 
by an act of the general assembly in 1877. 
The following is a short history of the school: 
Foundation.—In the year 1852 his excellency Sir George Grey, as governor of the 
colony, set apart certain endowments for the foundation and maintenance of a gram- 
mar school or schools in Auckland. In 1854 these endowments passed into the hands 
of the provincial government. In 1868 a board of governors.was constituted and 
empowered to employ a portion of the endowments in starting the school. The sum 
made available having been found insufficient, a subsequent aet authorized the 
~ board to deal with the whole endowment and accumulations, and provided a site 
with an.old building uponit. In this building the school was opened on May 17, 
1869, by his royal highness the Duke of Edinburgh, and his excellency Sir George 
Bowen, the governor of the colony. More than ten yearsyhowever, elapsed before 
it found a permanent home in a building erected for the purpose. In the meantime 
it had changed its quarters more than once and had for a time been dispersed among 
_ two or three small buildings. 
Governing body.—The first board of governors mentioned above consisted of the 
superintendent and executive of the Auckland province, the speaker of the provin- 
cial council, and three members elected by that body. In 1876, on the passing of the 
education boards act, the school was handed over to the Auckland board of educa 
tion, but in the following year an act provided-a special board consisting of three 
members elected by the members of the legislative assembly resident in the Auckland 
province, three elected by the Auckland board of education, and one ex-officio mem- 
_ ber, namely, the mayor of Auckland. Subsequently three members representing the 
senate of the University of New Zealand were added. 
Title.—The dual title of the school is a record of the fact that from 1871 to 1882 it 
was affiliated to the University of New Zealand. But the establishment of the Auck- 
     
-P-A-G-E-83
   SECONDARY EDUCATION IN NEW ZEALAND. 
jJand University College haying removed the necessity for such a connection, disaf- 
filiation was sought and obtained. The title, however, was not changed. i 
Head masters.—The first head master was the Rev. Robert Kidd, 1. D., of Trinity 
College, Dublin. He was succeeded after two years by Farquhar Macrae, esq., who 
held office until 1881, when it was resolved to obtain from England a graduate in 
honors of Oxford or Cambridge. J. A. Sloman, esq., B. A. (Sydney) was appointed 
to act as head master during the interregnum. In January, 1882, the present head 
master, ©. A. Bourne, esq., M. A., sometime exhibitioner and scholar. of St. John’s 
College, Oxford, was elected by a board of four commissioners, of whom the Rey. 
Dr. Jowett, master of Balliol College, Oxford, was chairman. 
Provision for the reception of boarders.—It was understood when the school was 
founded that the wants of the country districts should be, as far as possible, met by 
the provision of a schoolhouse for the reception of boarders, but though the goy- 
ernors have from time to time had this subject under consideration, and on one occa- 
sion actually resolved on the erection of a school house, and had designs prepared, 
this important addition is still wanting. 
Girls’ side.—Until September, 1888, the benefits of the school were confined to boys: 
Claims had indeed been put forward on behalf of the secondary education of girls, 
but it was clear that such an application of the endowment had not been originally 
contemplated, and it was at least doubtful whether it would be legal. Moreover, the ~ 
board of governors were carrying ona girls’ high school, receiving an annual subsidy 
from tho legislature for the purpose. But in the year mentioned this grant was 
withdrawn, and the school was closed in consequence. To meet this emergency, the 
girls’ side was opened. The arrangement, which was intended to be temporary, has 
now continued for four years. The two sides are carried on in the same building, 
but are kept separate in work and in play. The hoad master is in charge of both, 
and he and: other masters. take part in the instruction of the higher classes on the 
girls’ side. 
Curriculum.—The principal subjects of instruction are Latin, French, mathematics, 
yarious branches of natural and physical science, English history, geography, draw- 
ing (freehand, mechanical, and geometrical) ; reading and writing, bookkeeping, and 
mensuration are also taught, chiefly as alternative for Latin, which is optional. 
For Greek there is no appreciable demand, otherwise it would be taught. German 
and, for girls’ class, singing are taught out of school, but without extra fee. Drill 
and gymmasties are taught to the younger scholars in school hours, to the older in 
the midday interval. The workshop, for attendance at which a small fee is charged, 
is very popular. Boys often construct in it models of engineering works from draw- 
ings made in the drawing school. For girls, the course is somewhat modified, but it 
is on the whole very similar. 
Recreations.—Cricket and football are carriéd on by the boys with considerable 
energy, though under difficulties arising from the facts that there are ‘no boarders, 
that many of the scholars come from remote suburbs, and that the playground is — 
unsuitable. Practice and match wickets are hired in the Auckland Domain, and, by 
kind permission of his excellency the governor and the government, a field attached to 
the Government house isused. There is afives court for the boys; for the girls, two 
tennis lawns are being formed. Annual meetings are held by the boys, in the first 
term for swimming races, in the second for hare and hounds, in the third for athletic 
sports. A small orchestra meets for practice weekly, and every year a musical and 
dramatic entertainment is given. Ay 
Entrance.—Applicants for admission are required to pass an examination, and to 
produce certificates of good character from the school last attended. 
Terms, cie.—There are three terms in the year, namely: One of fourteen, and two 
of thirteen weeks, with vacations of seven weeks in the summer, two weeks, and 
three weeks, An examination is held at the end of the year, prizes are awarded and 
promotions made on the result of the three examinations combined. Occasionally 
the examinations are conducted by examiners not connected with the school, but 
     
-P-A-G-E-84

appointed and paid by the governors. Saturday is a whole holiday; on other week 
days school is held, for boys from 9:15 to 12:15 and from 1:45 t03:45; for girls morn- 
ing school begins and ends five minutes later, afternoon school five minutes earlier. 
Classification.—Oneé classification ‘serves for all subjects except mathematics, for 
which the pupils are redistributed. The classes on the girls’ side are approximately — 
parallel to those onthe boys’ side. 
Age of pupils.—The ages of the pupils range from 8 to 19 years. Sometimes the 
- latter limit is reached, but by far the larger number of pupils neither enter at or 
near the lower age nor stay until they approach the higher. 
Numbers.—Like almost all colonial schools this school has been subject to great fluc- 
tuationsinnumber. Shortly before Mr. Macrae ceased to be head master there were 
240 boys, butthe present head master found only 166. Atthe end of 1882 the number 
was the same; then it rose in a year and a half to 303, with 28 at a suburban pre- 
paratory school. A period.of commercial depression ensued, and the number fell. 
In 1889 it was 137. Before that time, however, the girls’ side had been opened. 
Starting with 76 pupils, it had steadily grown. The numbers at present (September, 
1892) are boys, 145; girls, 131. 
Staf.—There are at present on the regular staff 7 assistant masters and 8 mis- 
tresses working whole time, 1 master and 1 mistress working part time. All the 
assistant masters, except those for drawing and French, are graduates—1 of Oxford, 
1 of Cambridge, 2 of New Zealand; 1 of Sydney, 1 of Melbourne; 1 of the mis- 
tresses is a graduate of New Zealand. For gymnastics and for the drawing classes 
on the girls’ side visiting instructors attend. 
Scholarships, ete.—The board of governors offers annually out of endowment three 
junior and threo senior foundation scholarships, The former conferring free educa- 
tion, and, when necessary, cost of transit by rail in the first instance for one year, 
but with the prospect of renewal from year tv year, so long as the board is satisfied 
that the scholar is deserving, are open to boys and girls under the age of 13 years. 
The latter conferring free education for one yearand £20 are so arranged as to carry 
_ on boys and girls, who, having obtained distinction in the examination for the junior 
scholarships of the New Zealand University, and being young enough to compete 
again, desire to do so. The board also offers free education to the four candidates 
in each year who come next to the successful competitors for the board of educa- 
tion’s junior district scholarships, and also to the four who take a like position in the 
examination for the senior district scholarships. These district scholarships, of 
which the junior, worth £20 or £30 perannum for three years, are open to boys and 
girls from primary schools under the age of 14 years; and the senior, worth £30per 
annum also for three years, to boys and girls under the age of 16 years at the time 
of election, may be, and in most cases are, held in this school. Those already 
attending it can not, of course, compete for the junior scholarships, but are eligible” 
for the senior, and, indeed, carry off most of them. Thus a boy or girl may obtain 
assistance all through his or her career at this school until the time comes for com- 
peting for a university scholarship. A local benefaction (the Rawling’s trust) pro- 
vides fees, books, and £5 per annum for four years for, at present, nine years. 
There are at present Ge boys and 23 girls enjoying scholarships or free education 
in the school. 
In the examination for junior university scholarships, the civil service, and other 
open examjnations, this school has for many years past been very successful. 
The work may be gathered from the highest class work, and the 
~ lowest class work, which is as follows:

Rawlings scholarships (free education and books).—Nine boys. 
The success of the school in the university examinations for 1890-91 
was-as follows: 
In the examination for university junior scholarships held in December, 1890, 3 
pupils of this school obtained scholarships, viz, 2 male and 1 female; 6 passed with 
credit, viz, 4male and2 female. For matriculation, 9 passed, viz, 5 male and 4 
female. Inthe examination for senior district scholarships, held by the Auckland 
board of education in December, 1890, scholarships were awarded to 7 pupils of this 
school, viz, 3 male and 4 female; and certificates of proficiency to 8 pupils, viz, 6 
male and 2 female. At the civil service examinations held in January, 1891, in the 
senior examination 3 pupils of the school passed, viz, 2 male and 1 female; and 3 
boys obtained partial passes. In the junior examination 10 pupils of the school 
passed, viz, 7 male and 3 female. 
The school meets in rather a commodious building. 
OTHER SCHOOLS IN THE AUCKLAND DISTRICT. 
i e 
There is at the Thames, distant from Auckland 45 miles, a boys’,and 
girls’ high school. It is managed as follows: 
A board of governors is appointed and is constituted a body, corpo- | 
rate by the name of the Thames high school board. 
The board consisted first of 7 persons nominated by the governor, \ 
but no member could hold office longer than a year, a retiring member 
being eligible for reélection or renomination? 
After the expiration of the first year the governor appointed three 
members; the Thames borough council appointed three other members, 
and the mayor for the time being of the borough of Thames was the 
other member. 
The revenue received from reserves and gold fields last year amounted 
to £719 15s. 10d. The work of the highest class was that of the junior

university scholarship examination. Free education was granted to 27 
scholars. There is no boarding establishment connected with either 
; school. The pupils on the roll were: boys 29, girls 27. 
There was also established in the city of Auckland a Church of Eng- 
Jand grammar school. It was founded by Bishop Selwyn in 1855. 
Little work, however, has been recently done by it. The grants given 
to the Roman Catholic Chureh have also not been utilized for higher 
education. The Wesleyan College at the Three Kings was oncea high 
School, but it has become practically an English and Maori theological 
college for the Wesleyan ministry. 
There is a high school situated at Whangarei, which lies in a fine har- 
_ bor, 80 miles north of Auckland, and is becoming the seat of fruit cul- 
ture. Oranges, lemons, and other subtropieal fruits grow magnificently. 
It is managed by a board appointed as follows: 3 
The board consists of 7 persons, 1 of whom is the chairman of the 
county council for the time being; 2 are appointed from time to time by 
the governors of the Auckland College and Grammar School; 2 are 
nominated and appointed from time to time by the governor, and 2 are 
elected annually by the board of education for the Auckland provincial 
district. 
The only other high school in the Auckland provincial district is at 
Gisborne, but it is not in operation except so far as higher classes are 
taught in connection with the elementary school, which is subsidized 
by the high sehool governors. 
NEW PLYMOUTH HIGH SCHOOL. - 
In the Taranaki provincial district, which lies on the west coast of 
thenorthisland south of Auckland district, there is ahigh school at New 
Plymouth, the buildings overlooking the town and standing in a very 
healthy and commanding position. This school is under the manage- 
ment of a board and there were 43 pupils attending it last year. The. 
work done by the highest and lowest classes was as follows: 
Highest.—Cxsar, Books 1 and 1, Principia, part 1, the whole, grammar included. 
French: Hachette’s Third Reader, and De Fivas’s Grammaire des Grammaires.

The school gave free education to 7 scholars. The mode of appoint- 
ing the governors is as follows: The governor appoints 7 persons to 
constitute the board. Two of the members of the board retired from 
office atthe end of the first year after appointment, two other mem- 
bers retired at the end of the second year, and the three remaining 
members at the end of the third year. The names of the members to 
retire were determined by the board by lot. The vacancies thus cre- 
ated were filled by the governor, and the members so appointed hold 
office for three years, and in like manner thereafter appointments to be 
madeas vacancies occur. 
The sum of £418, 15s, 1d. was received from rents of endowments, 
and £165, 18s. 1d. from other sources. : 
THE NAPIER HIGH SCHOOL. 
In Napier, the chief town of Hawkes Bay provincial district, lying 
on the east coast of the north island and south of Auckland, there are 
two high schools, a boys’ high school and:a girl’s high school. These 
schools are managed by one board, incorporated in 1882. The board is 
composed of 2.members elected by the education board, 2 by the 
municipal council of the city of Napier, 2 by the Hawkes Bay County 
council, 2 by the Waipawa County council, 1 by the Wairoa County 
council, and one appointed by the governor. These counties are all 
situated in the Hawkes Bay provincial district. The following is a 
short sketch of the schools, which the secretary of the board has kindly 
furnished: 
The origin and history of the Napier high schools have an intimate connection 
with the early days of the province of Hawkes Bay. When the government sold 
the lands on which the town of Napier now stands, in the year 1856, a number of 
settlers combined and purchased sections 136 and 137 at the upset price of £5 for 
each section and built a school upon them ata cost of over £200. The purchasers 
vested the lands and school in three trustees, who were to hold them for the pur- 
poses of education for all future time. In 1863 a fire broke out in the town of Na- 
pier and destroyed the school. It was now evident to the trustees that the sections 
were too valuable and, in some ways, unsuitable for the purpose of a school, being © 
in the very center of the business portion of the town. Hence they resolved on 
leasing the sections and providing for the school elsewhere. Various conflicting — 
causes prevented the trustees from building"a new school, and, with the consent of 
those who purchased the lands, an application was made to the supreme court in the 
year 1872 to sanction an arrangement for the administration of the rents arising out 
of the sections. The supreme court gave its sanction to a scheme by which two- 
thirds of the accumulated funds and the rents should be applied to the support of a 
girls’ and a boys’ public school, under the Hawkes Bay education act, and one-third 
to be invested for the purpose of a grammar school, and vested the land in a body 
of trustees for these purposes. Under this decree a public school for boys was erected 
on suburban section 90, sold to the trustees by the provincial council of Hawkes 
Bay for a nominal sum for this purpose, and the existing school for gtrls in Tenny- 
son street was taken over by the trustees and greatly enlarged and equipped for the 
     
-P-A-G-E-88
     EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
  purpose. This arrangement continued till the education act of New Zealand came 
into force in the year 1877, which completely upset all its provisions, A bill was 
prepared and laid before parliament in the year 1882, providing for a high school . 
under a popular basis of elected governors by various public bodies. It provided 
that the public school occupied by the boys should be made a boys’ high school, that 
~ a site on another portion of suburban section 90 should beset apart for a girls’ high 
school, and that certain landsalong with sections 136 and 137 in the town of Napier 
should beset apart for an endowment. The bill obtained the sanction of parliament 
and was at once put into force. A considerable portion of the endowment had to be 
sold to provide the buildings. Very shortly after the governors came into posses- 
sion of the property, the leases of the sections 136 and 137 expired and were again relet 
by public auction at an annual rental of £745. This constitutes for the future the 
chief portion of the endowment. The schools are row in vigorous operation under 
- qualified teachers. 
_ The subjects taught are as follows: ,

SECONDARY EDUCATION IN NEW ZEALAND. 
        SCHOOLS IN THE WELLINGTON DISTRICT. : 
‘Wanganui, situated in the north of the Wellington provincial district, 
is the seat of several educational institutions of high value. The town 
itself is beautifully situated’on the northern branch of the Wanganui 
River, which is perhaps one of the most beautiful rivers in the colony. 
It is not far from the mouth of the river. The main school is what is — 
termed the Wanganui Collegiate School. It is managed by trustees, 
but it is connected with the Anglican church of New Zealand. It is, ae 
perhaps, the largest boarding school in the colony and has been well 
managed for a large number of years. The Bishop of Wellington and 
Primate of New Zealand, the Rev. Dr. Hadfield, gives oo following 
short résumé of the school: 
It had its origin in a grant to the church of 250 acres of land, partly swamp and ae 
partly sand hills, in the vicinity of the then small town of Wanganui, about the 
year 1855, for the purpose of establishing a school for children of both races. For 
many years this land yielded very small returns, the land for the most part having 
been let on long leases at nominal rents, as much labor was required to render it in 
any degree productive. Forsome years a school was carried on by averycompetent ~ 
master, chiefly for the benefit of children of the Maori race; but, from the unsettled _ 
and disturbed state of the country at that time and from other causes, the school was 
not successful. = 
In the year 1882, higher rents having been obtained, the trustees of the property 
thought some attempt might be made to establish a school of a more satisfactory 
kind. They were able to avail themselves of an offer madé by the late W. B. Har-- ~ 
vey, D. D., of Cambridge, to establish a grammar school on a sound basis. . This he 
did. And at the time of his rather sudden death four years ago he had a consider- 
able number of boys both as boarders and day scholars, ~The school was acknowl- os 
edged to be asuccess. Mr. W. Empson, B. a (Oxford), who had for some time been 
second master, succeeded Dr. Harvey. The school has continued to improve. It has 
now attained a recognized position as one of the best grammar schools in New Zeal- 
and. The trustees hope that, so soon as the debt incurred for the purpose of erect- 
ing the excellent buildings in which the school is carried on’ has been discharged, 
they may be able on the same property to establish a branch school for Maori boys, 
for which in a few years it is probable there may be a demand. \ 
Inow annex a short statement just received from Mr. Empson: 
“Programme of work, etc.: The day begins at 7a. m. with half an hour’s prepara- 
tion of work. From 7:30 to 8, gymnasium or running. The morning school hours 
extend from 9 to 12:45. The afternoon from 2 to 3:30 in summer, 3:30 to 5 in winter. 
Evening preparation is carried on from 7 to 8:30. The course of instruction com- 
prises Greek, Latin, French, English, composition and history, geography, mechan- 
ies, trigonometry, geometry, algebra, arithmetic, physiology, divinity, drawing, 
and shorthand. There is also a carpenters’ shop, where practical carpentry is taught, 
a debating society, a cadet corps, and the usual cricket, football, rowing, and tennis 
clubs also exist in connection with the school. The present numbers attending are 
155, of whom 115 are boarders and 40 day scholars. The year is divided into three 
equal terms of thirteen weeks each, with six weeks holidays at Christmas, four in 
May, and three in September.” 
To this I would add that there are 8 masters, one of whom is a clergyman, a grad-_ 
uate of Cambridge, who is chaplain and who officiates in the excellent chapel built — 
chiefly by the efforts of the late Dr. Harvey. 
A. few further details may be valuable. To understand the attitude 
towards this and other schools, it may be necessary to point out that

  EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
the first education act ever passed in the colony was passed in 1847,and ; 
it was entirely denominational in its character, for it provided that | 
education should be under the management of the Anglican Church, 
the head of the Roman Catholic Church, the superintendents of the 
_ Wesleyan ministry, or. the head of any other religious body engaged in 
- education in the colony. To help these bodies in their work of educa- 
tion, grants of land were given to. them by the Government. This was 
the origin of the Wanganui Collegiate School. A grant was given to 
help the Anglican Church in the teaching of the Maori aboriginal and 
other children. It was to be industrial in its character. As, however, 
_ aspecial act was passed—the native schools act—for providing educa- 
tion*for the Maoris, the endowments set apart in Wanganui were uti- 
lized by the church for a secondary school. The course of study is 
- that of an ordinary high school, the work of the highest and lowest 
- classes being as follows: 
Highest.—Latin, Greek, French, science, English, mathematics, drawing. 
Lowest.—Latin, English, arithmetic, reading, writing, history, geography. 
The total income from reserves in 1891 was £777 9s. 8d. 
There is a highschool for girls established in Wanganui, which has 
received endowments from the Government. It is under the manage- 
ment of a board duly incorporated, the members being the members of 
the education board of the Wanganui education district for the time 
being. This school has only been lately opened. It has 54 girls attend- 
_ ing it and the course of study is as follows: ‘ 
Highest.—Latin: Grammar exercises to end of Smith’s Principia, part 1. English: 
Marie’s grammar, Shakespeare (two plays). French: Larousse’s grammar and

In the city of Wellington there are three excellent secondary schools, 
viz, the Wellington College, St. Patrick’s College, and the girls’ high 
school. The two first-named institutions are for boys. 
The Wellington College arose out of a grant of land given for the 
purposes of higher education in 1853. The college, however, was not 
opened under this endowment until early in the year 1 1868. The follow- 
__ ing is a short history of the school: 
This college was founded by Sir George Grey, K. c. B., who, in 1853, as governor 
of New Zealand, set apart by crown grant certain parcels of land as an endowment 
for or towards the maintenance and support of a college or grammar school to which 
persons of all classes or races who may inhabit the colony were to be equally 
admitted, and at which, in addition to the usual course of education in the English  
-P-A-G-E-91

language and mathematics and in such other branches of learning as the trustees 
may direct, all students shall, if they desire it, receive instruction in the Greek and 
Latin languages. 
It was not until 1867, however, that a school was opened under the trustees of the 
land so set apart. Itwas begun in a small way in rented premises, but soon increased 
in numbers, and in 1868 a building was erected in which for the next six years the 
school was carried on. In 1872 an act was passed by the general assembly by which 
the trustees were replaced by a body corporate styled ‘The Governors of Welling- 
ton College,” and in 1874 the school having farther increased the present buildings 
were begun. These have from time to time been added to as circumstances required, 
the cost as they now stand having been upwards of £12,000. 
The college buildings stand in a reserve of 69 acres, mostly consisting of hills, but 
with a flat piece of land in front of the buildings available as a play ground and now — 
being enlarged and improyed. The site is a commanding one and embraces theele- 
nents of considerable quiet beauty. & a z 
There is accommodation for upwards of 50 boarders, the dormitories being lofty 
and well ventilated. There are large class rooms and hall and gymnasium, and a 
dwelling house for the head master, all comprised in the one building. In the 
grounds are a laundry, and a cottage available as a hospital in case of illness among 
the boarders. 
The school year is divided into three terms of thirteen weeks each. 
The course of study’ is arranged with the view of preparing candidates for the ma- _ 
triculation and junior scholarship examinations of the University of New Zealand, 
and at the same time special attention is given to the requirements of pupils who 
desire to follow a commercial course. 
The subjects taught are classics, mathematics, English, history, geography, 
French, German, natural science, drawing, and shorthand. 
The fees are, upper school, £13 4s.; lower school, £10 12s. a year, including sta- 
tionery. . 
Boarders’ fees, full, 40 guineas; weekly, 30 guineas; daily, £10 guineas a year. 
The number of pupils now in attendance is 119, of whom 21 are boarders. 
The college and the girls’ high school are managed by a board ap- 
pointed as follows: The governing body of the Wellington College and. 
Girls’ High School consists of 8 members, one of whom shall be the 
mayor for the time being of the city of Wellington; another shall be 
the chairman for the time being of the education board of the dis- 
triet of Wellington, and of the remaining 6 members, divided into two 
equal groups, 3 shall be elected by the parents or guardians of pu- 
pils attending the school who have attended the school for not less than 
one quarter, and 3 others shall be appointed by the governor in 
‘council. And every person so appointed, excepting the mayor of the city 
of Wellington for the time being and the chairman for the time being 
of the education board, continues in. office for the term of five years . 
from his appointment. 
Total revenue from reserves for last year amounted to £1,485 5s. 4d. 
The school fees of the college and girls’ school together amounted to 
£2,246 0s. 5d. There are several scholarship funds, viz: The Turnbull, 
the Moore, the Rhodes, and the Barincoat scholarship and prize funds. 
The work done by the boys will be ascertained from the following:

  St. Patrick’s College is a fine, substantial brick building. It is con- 
ducted by Marist Brothers, and is entirely under the control of the Mar- 
ist order. Its scholars prepare for the matriculation examination of 
the New Zealand University. There is accommodation for boarders. 
_It is open for inspection by the government, as holders of education 
board scholarships can attend it. The principal is the Rev. Dr. Wat- 
ters. This is the only Roman Catholic secondary school in the colony. 
It was opened in 1885, and has an attendance of about 70 or 80. 
The girls’ high school has 113 in attendance, and is accommodated in’ 
a fine wooden building at the northern end of the city. It was started 
- in 1882, but not formally opened till February, 1883, when 60 pupils 
were enrolled. The school steadily increased till1886, when 121 pupils 
were on the roll, and then the present site was obtained and the build- 
ingsbegun. The buildings are of wood, and cost £5,000. They are com- 
modious, and the grounds surrounding them contain about2 acres ofland. 
The course of instruction includes English language, grammar, compo- 
_ sitions and literature, modern languages and literature, history,physical 
and political geography, physical and natural science, Latin, arith- 
metic, Euclid, algebra, trigonometry, writin g, vocal music, needlework, 
‘dressmaking, and.calisthenics. Papils are prepared by the regular 
course for the matriculation and junior scholarship examinations of the 
University of New Zealand. Matriculated students are also prepared 
for the examination for keeping the first year’s term of their university 
course in such subjects as fall within the scope of the regular work of 
the school. There is also a shorthand class, and those of the pupils 
: who wish it attend the school of design for instruction in drawing.

THE NELSON COLLEGES. 
The city of Nelson is situated in the north of the middle island of 
New Zealand on Blind Bay, and is the chief town of the Nelson provin- 
cial district. Its climate is very equable and it is a health resort. At 
the north of the city lies a natural breakwater called the “ Bowlder 
bank.” It has a northern or sunny exposure and in the summer there 
is sea breeze, which keeps the city cool. It has two high schools. 
The settlement of Nelson was founded under the auspices of the New 
~ Zealand Company, and special provision was made in Nelson, as in 
many of the other settlements, that a sum should be devoted by the 
company for religious and educational purposes. The establishment 
of a college in Nelson was specially mentioned as one of the educational 
objects that was to receive aid from the company, and trustees were 
appointed under an act of the imperial Parliament to receive these 
funds for this purpose. The first trustees were, David Munro (after- 
wards Sir David Munro), Francis Dillon Bell (afterwards Sir Francis 
Dillon Bell), Alfred Fell, and John Waring Saxton. In 1854 the Nelson 
trust funds act was passed, which provided for the appointment of 
new trustees and for the management of the trust funds that were to 
be obtained from the company. The company, however, did not pay 
these moneys at that time to the trustees, and it was not until after 
some negotiation, and after the government of the colony had under- 
taken the liabilities of the New Zealand Company, that funds were 
obtained for the founding of the college. By a deed dated 14th Novem- 
ber, 1857, £20,000 was set a part for a college, that was to be managed 
by a visitor and nine governors. In 1858 application was made to Par- 
liament to incorporate the trustees that had been appointed by deed, 
and the Nelson College act, 1858, was passed, which is the act under 
which the college is still managed. The trust deed declared that the 
college was to be an educational institution for the advancement of 
religion and morality and the promotion of useful knowledge, and that 
creed could not be admitted as a disqualification either as regards 
teachers or pupils. The course of instruction was to include the English 
language and literature, one or more modern languages, geography, 
mathematics, classics, history, drawing, music, and such other branches 
of art and science as the co uncil shall at any time determine. No pupil 
was to be admitted under the age of 9 years, nor unless he was able to 
read fluently, to write with tolerable accuracy from dictation, and be

familiar with the first four rules of arithmetic. The college had been 
opened in temporary premises in 1856, and it was not until December 
7, 1859, that the present college buildings were commenced. The build- 
ings, including the land, cost £13,000. The following have been the 
head masters: J. C. Bagshaw, M. A.; Mr. George Heppel, M.A.; Mr. A. 
R. Broughton, M. A.; Mr. J.D. Greenwood; Rey. 0. Ll. Maclean, M. A.; 
_Rey. F. OC. Simmons, mM. A.; Rev. J. ©. Andrews, Mm. A.; Mr. W. J. Ford, 
M. A., and the present principal, Mr. J. W. Joynt, Mm. A. 
The board of governors. consists of 9 members, appointed by the 
governor in council. The following are the present members of the 
board: 
Hon. J. W. Barnicoat, M. L. c.; C. Y. Fell, esq.; Alfred Greenfield, 
“e8q:5 W. ©. Hodgson, esq.; Albert Pitt, esq.; Hon. J. ©. Richmond, 
M. L. C.; James Sclanders, esq.; John Sharp, esq.; Hon Joseph Shep- 
hard, M. L. ¢. 
The staff is as follows: Principal, John W. Joynt, M. A. (Dublin); 
second master, W. S. Littlejohn, m. A. (Aberdeen); third master, F. G. 
Gibbs, M. A. (New Zealand); fourth master, E. F. W. Cooke; music and 
drawing, a visiting staff; drill instructor, Sergeant-Major Nixon; sei- 
ence master, W. S. Littlejohn, mM. A.; resident masters, the principal, 
Mr. Gibbs, and Mr. Cooke; lady matron, Miss E. B. Bell. ‘ 
The following statement from the programme of the college will be 
of interest: 
The regular course of instruction embraces ancient and modern languages, his- 
tory and literature, pure and applied mathematics, political and physical geog- 
raphy, English composition, grammar and analysis, and physical science and chem- 
istry. Special attention is given to the subjects required for the various university 
and civil-service examinations. Special arrangements have been made for the more 
systematic teaching of science, and a new and suitable laboratory has been built 
and equipped with the apparatus requisite for the study of chemistry and assaying. 
The college is situated in a commanding position about a quarter of an hour’s 
walk from the town. The sanitary arrangements are of the best description. 
The beautiful situation and salubrious climate of Nelson render it especially 
attractive as a center of higher class education. In these respects it offers induce- 
ments which are perhaps not equalled in any town in the colony. The moral and 
physical welfare of the boys is carefully looked after by the masters, and a lady 
matron of skill and experience has charge of their diet and domestic arrangements. 
Though the college is strictly undenominational, the boys are expected to attend a 
place of worship according to their religious profession, unless their parents other- 
_ wise direct. A Bible class is also Held bya visiting clergyman on Sunday mornings, 
which boys whose parents desire it are required to attend. 
There are in connection with the college a library containing a large number of 
books, and regularly supplied with periodicals, an extensive football and cricket 
ground, with a carefully prepared pitch, and a gymnasium with the usual appliances. 
There are also a cadet corps and a fire brigade, and all boys are drilled twice a _ 
week. 
Pupils, on entrance, must be at least 9 years of age, and able to read and write 
and work the first four rules of arithnietie with reasonable facility. 
The following scholarships were held during the last quarter of the year: 
Endowed: Tinline, £52 12s.; Newcome, £24; Richmond, £24; Stafford, £20; 
Fell, £16.

Eleven scholarships of the Nelson education board and two of the Marlboro educa- 
tion board were held. : : 
The highest class work is preparation for the university scholarship 
examination. : 
In 1882 the governors were empowered. by act to expend a portion of 
their funds in the erection of a college for girls, and a building was put 
up of wood, at acost of £5,000. The first lady principal was Miss Kate 
Edger, M. A.; she afterwards resigned, on her marriage, and was sue- 
ceeded by Miss B. E. Gibson, M. A., who is the present principal. 
The number on the roll in 1891 was 76, the boarders numbering 33. 
It is managed by the same governors. The staff is as follows: Lady 
principal, Miss B. E. Gibson, M. A.; assistant mistresses, Miss Harri- 
son, M. A., Miss Watson; science master, Mr. W. S. Littlejohn, M. A.; 
music mistresses, a visiting staff (at present of 5 teachers); drawing 
mistress, Miss Morgan. 
The course of study may be gathered from the following programme: 
The regular course of instruction includes the English language and literature, 
French, German, Latin, mathematics, the elements of science, class singing, needle- 
work, drilling and Indian elub exercises, with the other usual features of a liberal 
education. Special attention is given\to the subjects required for the various uni- 
versity examinations. 
The college is situated on about 3 aeres of rising ground in one of the healthiest 
and most commanding positions in Nelson, within ten minutes’ walk of the center of 
the town, yet as retired as if in the country. The building is provided with fire 
escapes and other means of egress; the rooms throughout are lofty and airy, and the 
class rooms well lighted and well ventilated. The bed rooms are most of them single, 
and where two or more pupils occupy the same room separate beds are provided. 
All are comfortably fitted up and pupils require nothing but their own personal 
clothing, as house and table linen is supplied by the college. 
The assistant mistresses reside in the college, and aid the lady principal in the 
supervision of the boarders out of school hours. = 
The grounds include two asphalt tennis courts. Two tennis clubs (senior and 
junior) have been formed and hold annual tournaments. Other means of exercise 
and amusement are also provided. A school library has been established and a read- 
ing room has been set apart, where several of the best monthly periodicals are to be 
seen. 
Attached to the college is a good studio, well furnished with casts and models. 
Classes for drawing and painting aré held both in the day and in the evening. 
The school is strictly undenominational, but a Bible class is held on Sunday after- 
noons, attended by both boarders and day pupils, at the option of the parents; and 
once a week a clergyman visits the college to give religious instruction to all whose 
parents may wish them to attend. 
Parents are allowed to a great extent to choose the subjects of instruction taken 
up, and in cases where’some subjects are omitted, arrangements can be made, if 
desired, for pupils to prepare their home lessons during school hours, but only a 
moderate amount of home preparation is expected, except in cases where pupils 
wish to work up for-special examinations.

The higher branches are taught in these schools and fairly satisfactory 
work has been done. The number of pupils attending the advanced 
classes is, in Hokitika 21 and in Greymouth 25. 
CHRIST’S COLLEGE AND GRAMMAR SCHOOL, CANTERBURY. 
_Canterbury was originally founded as a Church of England settle- 
tment by the Canterbury Association. The church received consider- 
able grants of land for church purposes from the association. Part of 
this church endowment was applied in establishing the Christ’s Col- 
lege and Grammar School. 
The attendance last year was 179 boys. The following isa statement 
regarding scholarships: - 
Gould scholarships.—About £450 annually is available for scholarships. They con- 
sist of 4 senior scholarships and 8 junior scholarships; an amount is given to assist 
the boarding expenses of boarders. 
Somes entrance scholarships.—The subjects for examination for these scholarships 
are offered for competition each year. The value is the amount paid for school fees 
and each scholarship is tenable for two years. There are now 17 scholars on this 
foundation, all of whom are from government primary schools. 
Buller aud Reay scholarships.—Exhibitions are given from this endowment to sons 
of clergy and other boys who'may require assistance. The value of the exhibitions 
is determined annually according to the amount available for the endowment and 
the number of claimants. About £450 annually is available for the school. 
' Tancard history prize fund.—Prizes are given annually from this endowment for 
proficiency in history and English literature. 
The remainder of the funds available (from the Somes endowment, £60; also from 
the Buller and Reay endowments, £140; the whole of the Rowley endowment, 
£210; and of the Dudley endowment, £25; in all, £435) is devoted to scholarships 
and exhibitions in the upper or collegiate department of Christ’s College, students 
in which are required to study for their degree at Canterbury College. 
The total income from endowments was £3,080 19s. 9d. in 1891,

The following is a short sketch of the origin and history of the school: 
The school was opened in May, 1881. The numbers have gradually been increas- 
ing until the present date, when they stand at 151. ‘The staff consists of the head 
master and seven assistant masters, exclusive of visiting instructors in drawing, 
singing, drill, ete. Two of the mites are from the home avert neg of Oxford and 
Cambridge; the others are from the New Zealand University. < 
The school is a genuinely secondary school; that is, it carries on the education of 
the primary school, from which it draws a great part of its pupils, up to the univer- 
sity standard. 
There are at present 11 old high-school boys at Canterbury College. Four old 
pupils have taken their M. a. degree with honors. - 
The fees arevery low, being £9 9s. per annum for boys over 12 years, and £66s. for 
boys below that age, if punctually paid. Last year 29 boys were receiving free edu- 
cation at the school, and there were 18 boys in attendance holding scholarships 
- given by the board of (primary) education of North Canterbury. 
Boys in the highest classes do Horace, Livy, Cicero, unseen translation, Bradley’s 
Arnold, and continuous Latin prose composition; historical English grammar, 
Chaucer, Shakespeare, ete., and English essays; algebra (to permutations); Euclid 
I, Vi, trigonometry; also French,»science (inorganic chemistry and heat), and two 
boys learn Greek. 
~The lowest class reads Star Reader, Standard tv, and works the four rules, simple 
- and compound, of arithmetic. The greater part of the school time is given to 
English, Latin, and mathematics. 
- There is also technical instruction for selected classes in geometrical drawing, 
bookkeeping, carpentering, etc. 
One noticeable feature of the school is the reclassification of the boys in each sub- 
ject; so that a boy, for example, may be in the III English, the upper I Latin, the 
TY mathematics, and so on, so that no boy is discouraged because of his backward- 
ness in one subject. 
Though the school sends on many to the university, of course the majority of the 
boys leave early for business; and for them the reclassification of the school in each 
- subject, the copious English instruction, and the miscellaneous classes (geography, 
drawing, science, bookkeeping) are calculated to give a thorough sound education 
preparatory to their different callings.

may with the approval of the head master, take science, shorthand, and drawing in 
place of Latin. Greek and German will be taught to those boys whose parents — 
desire it, if there be a sufficient number. The bookkeeping class is intended for 
boys about to leave for business. Singing is taught only to junior boys. Drill is 
compulsory for all boys not specially exempted. The work of some of the higher 
classes is arranged with a view to matriculation and junior scholarships. For boys 
who leave early for business, the school curriculum admits (subject to the sanction 
‘of the head master) of considerable choice of subjects. 
There isasuitable workshop, fitted with excelent lathes, joiners’ ’ benches, and tools, 
in which instruction is given in carpentering, the use of tools, ete., out of school 
hours. The fee is 5s. per term, and covers instruction for two hours a week. Boys

_ board of governors of Canterbury College award eight exhibitions amounting to the 
school fees, aud tenable for three years, to the boys who stand next in order to the 
scholarship winners in classes A and B in the scholarship examination held each year 
by the education board of the North Canterbury district, provided these boys qualify — 
in accordance with the regulations of the board. No school exhibition will be 
awarded to a boy holding any other exhibition or scholarship, if it would raise the 
_ amount held by him above the value of a scholarship of the board of education. 
"School exhibitioners must produce to the registrar, at the close of each term, a cer- 
tificate from the head master of satisfactory attendance, conduct, and progress. The 
exhibitions will be terminable at any time on an unsatisfactory report from the head 
master. (3) Leaving exhibitions: An exhibition of £15, tenable for at least two 
years at Canterbury College, is given to the’ boy who, in the university junior 
_ scholarship examination, while failing to win a scholarship, is placed highest among 
the candidates from this school, in the list of those ‘deemed to have passed with 
credit.”

The following is a brief sketch of the origin and history of the school, 
kindly furnished by the secretary of the Canterbury College: 
  The school was opened on September 13, 1877. During its early years the numbers _ 
varied from about 70 to 90; for some years the numbers have been, as a rule, between 
140 and 150, ¢ 
On the teaching staff at present, besides the lady principal, there are seven assist- 
ants, for the most part graduates of the New Zealand University, and six visiting 
teachers. 
The whole work of the school during each year is examined at the end of the year 
by outside examiners, such as the profesSors of the college; the practical subjects, 
also, are examined by experts: 
The upper classes of the school prepare for matriculation and the junior university 
scholarship examination. Several girls matriculate every year, and since 1879 21 
junior university scholarships have been gained by pupils of the school. 
There are at present 23 ex-pupils at Canterbury College; 9 others, ex-pupils of the 
school, have taken their M. A. degree with honors; 6 have taken their B. a. degree.

__-The school gave free education to 2 boys. 
The following is a short history of the school, supplied by the chair- 
man of the board of governors: © 
This school was established by an act of the general assembly of New Zealand in 
parliament assembled in the year 1881, and endowed with a grant of land comprising 
233 aeres absolutely invested in the Rangiora High School, and the management 
delegated to a board of governors, consisting of 7 persons, of whom one is the mayor 
_ for the time being of the borough of Rangiora by virtue of his office, two are elected 3
-P-A-G-E-103
    “byt the county conned of Ashloy. He by the board of governors of Guitetiuey Col- 
lege, and two by the board of education for North Canterbury, such being a body 
corporate with perpetual succession and a common seal. 
The first meeting of the board of governors was held in the council chamber of the 
borough on December 28, 1881, in compliance with an order of his excelléncy the ~ 
governor in the New Zealand Gazette, dated December 22, 1881, when the election’ 
of chairman, the rules for corducting the business of the board, and the ways oa 
means were fally discussed and agreed upon. 
The board’s application to the governmentgfor further assistance in November, : 
1883, having failed, and the offer of a most aeciable site for the school premises at _ 
a cost of £600 having been submitted, the board’s anxiety to see the school started — 
increased, whereupon an appeal for aid was made to the residents in the district, 
which met with a hearty and liberal response, £280 being readily subscribed. With 
this sum and $391, accumulated rents from the estate, the board was enabled to pur, ate 
chase the property offered and proceed to having a schoolroom built. 
On January 28, 1884, the school was opened with an attendance of 15 pupils, under 
the charge of Mr. H. E. Tuckey, B.'a., St. John’s College, Cambridge, as head mas- 
ter. The ceremony of opening the school was attended by a largenumber of people 
from various parts of Canterbury, the proceedings being presided over by Mr. 
Andrew Hunter Cunningham, the chairman of the board of governors, who had been ~ 
indefatigable in canvassing the district to get the school started. The Hon. C. C, — 
Bowen, then the member for the district in the house of representatives, afd by = 
whose exertions the endowment for the school had been obtained, gave a very able 
address, pointing out the advantage to be derived from the teaching in secondary 
schools, adverting to the smallness of the endowment, but wishing success to the | 
high school of Rangiora. Several other influential gentlemen gave excellent ad- _ 
dresses. : 
The school now passed through two years of varying fortune, and it had been con- 
templated to temporarily close it, when in March, 1886, the head master resigned 
and was succeeded by the appointment of Mr. T. W. Rowe, M. A., senior scholar of — 
the University of New Zealand and exhibitioner of Canterbury College, 1883 and 
1884, under whose able superintendence the school has materially improved. 
There is a small high school af Ashburton. Its income from reserves _ 
amounts to £536 11s. 9d. The highest work is that of preparing schol- 
ars for the university matriculation examination, and the lowest work 
is elementary. It has an attendance of 29 pupils. * 
There is also a high school at Akaroa. It has £215 9s. 6d. reserves. 
This school is doing little work beyond that of an elementary school of 
a higher grade. It has 14 pupils in attendance. g 
TIMARU HIGH SCHOOL. 
The Timaru High School is situated close to the beautiful coastal 
township of Timaru, where there has been constructed a large break- — 
water, which enables vessels to lie in safety in the bay. It is the cen- — 
ter of a very important agricultural district, and is the seat of the 
South Canterbury education board. The rents received from reserves 
for the past year amounted to £1,525, The work of the highest ee € 
lowest classes is as follows: i

During the year a school library was founded by efforts made within 
the school itself. It now contains 200 volumes. A  carpenter’s shop 
has also been established in connection with the school. It is intended 
by combining carpentry with the work of the classes in practical 
mechanics, mensuration, and geometrical and mechanical drawing, to 
afford a certain degree of technical education, more especially for those 
boys who do not take Latin. 
All the candidates for public examinations during the year were suc- 
cessful. Five girls'and 3 boys passed the matriculation examination of 
the university. One girl passed the civil service examination. 
The standard of the work of the highest class has been raised from 
that of the matriculation examination to that of the junior scholarship 
in the case of every subject.. The middle of the school on the boys’ side 
has now classes in all the chief commercial subjects, and there are now 
seven classes doing regular work in seven various branches of science 
as against the former weekly lecture. . 
The head master has kindly forwarded the following note on the 
school and its work: 
This high school, established and constituted under “the Timaru high school act, 
1878,” and the amendment act of 1882, was opened for pupils in February, 1880. 
From February, 1880, to April, 1889, the rector was Mr. A. L. Halkett Dawson, mM. 
A. (bursar, prizeman, and graduate in honors of the University of Aberdeen; some- 
time assistant to the professor of English and logic, Aberdeen; and English master, 
ladies college, Melbourne.). 
' The present board and staff are as follows: 
Board of governors.—The Venerable Archdeacon Harper, M. A. (chairman); William 
» Balfour, esq.; E. Elworthy, esq.; Sandham Gillingham, esq.; 8S. W. Goldsmith,

The boys’ and girls’ schools are quite separate; though for the sake of convenience 
pupils of the highest class are taught in the same room. 
The school curriculum admits of considerable choice of subjects, and parents are 
invited to consult with the head master as to the subjects pupils should take up. 
The school has, besides the usual playgrounds, a Bee a fives court, tennis 
courts, carpenter’s workshop, and a museum. 
The fees are: Senior, £4 6s. 8d. per term; juniors, £3 13s. 4d. per term. These are 
payable at the secretary’s office, in advance. If paid within fourteen days from com- 
mencement of the term a reduction of £1 per term is made. “ 
_ In the case of more than two from the same family, a further reduction of £1 per 
pupil is made for each pupil after the first two. 
Boys are received as boarders by the head master; fees for board, £13 per term, — 
payable in advance. Arrangements can be made for weekly or day boarders. e 
Parents who wish to send girls as boarders are requested to communicate with the 
head master, who will assist them in making suitable arrangements. 
Exhibitions.—The Cain exhibition (£10 for one year) is awarded to that boy or girl 
who stands highest in the annual school examination and declares his or her inten-   
tion of competing for a junior scholarship of the University of New Zealand. The —— 
governors give free education to holders of education board scholarships. | 
The special features of the teaching in the school are as follows: 
(1) In the teaching of languages, grammar and composition are subordinated at 
first to the translation and comprehension of the language; the grammar is gradu-— 
ally built up from examples occurring in the translation, and composition is taught, 
not by isolated sentences, but by variation and imitation of the translation. 
(2) In mathematics, and especially in geometry, as much use as possible is made 
of the concrete, by means of models, ete.; in trigonometry the school grounds and 
neighborhood are actually surveyed. 
(3) All science is taught by means of experiment, the experiments and observa- 
tions being made by each pupil individually or by pairs. In mechanics and physics 
generally as much quantative work as possible is done. The school possesses good 
sets of apparatus for this purpose, as well as good physiological models, specimens 
of natural history and mineralogy, and a good microscope, 
(4) The pupils are all expected to go through a complete course of drawing. 
(5) The technical work (carpentry for the seniors, Sloyd carpentry and Sloyd 
cardboard models for the juniors) is made to fit in with the rest of work, e. g., draw-_ 
ing, mensuration, and applied mechanics.

dates from the school. Last year 8 candidates passed the New Zealand University 
matriculation examination , 2 of them taking the junior scholarship examination. 
_ Five pupils are entering the engineering department of Canterbury College at the 
beginning of the next session. - . 
- Inregard to physical training, both girls and boys receive formal gynmastic train- 
_ ing from an instructor. The girls also have daily calisthenic exercises (Swedish 
_ and French drill). There is a cadet corps numbering 42. The boys also have senior 
and junior cricket and football clubs. Annual athletic sports and fives tournaments 
~ are held. ‘The girls have a games club for tennis and other games, And hold one or 
two tournaments in each-year. 
WAITAKT HIGH SCHOOLS. 
The Waitaki High School was incorporated in 1878. Its income 
from reserves amounts to £15211, 4s. 9d. There are under its manage- 
ment a high school for boys and a high school for girls. The boys 
high school is situated 2 miles north from Oamaru—the White City of 
New Zealand—so called because its buildings are of a white limestone, 
and the girls’ high school is in the center of the town. This town is 
the center of a very rich agricultural district, and has a harbor con- 
structed at considerable expense. The town is situated on the coast 
in the northern part of Otago, and it is beautifully laid out and is ex- 
ceedingly healthy. There is a boarding establishment connected with~ 
each school. The work of the highest and lowest classes in both 
- schools is as follows:

The following is a short history of the schools: 
The first meeting of the governors of the Waitaki High School was held February 
20, 1879. After much consideration, in July, 1879, it was decided to select as a site ‘ 
for the boys’ high school a portion of land set aside as one of the reserves, distant — 
about a mile from the town boundary. Thirty acres were allotted for school 2a 
poses, the remainder to be sold for revenue, 
A bonus of £20 was offered for the best design for eehog! buildings to be erected — 
in stone, the total cost when completed not to exceed £5,000, the present portion to — 
_ be erected not to cost more than £2,500. Messrs. Forrester and Lemon, of Oamaru, 
5 architects, were the successful competitors. The contractors for stonework were 
Messrs. Wilson and Rokburgh and for woodwork Mr. H. Sidon. a 
The foundation stone was laid October 12,1881, by the Hon. Mr. Shrimski, v. 1. ¢., 
by whom the bill vesting the endowments in a board for the purposes of secondary _ 
education was introduced into parliament. 
In January, 1882, it was arranged through the courtesy of the Government that — 
the agent general associate himself with the 2 other commissioners for the purpose 
of selecting a head master, 1 of them to be a professor of Oxford and Cambridge, the 
other a professor of Edinburgh and Glasgow. 
Mr. John Harkness, M. A., was chosen out of a great number of applicants. * 
In order to obtain funds one the erection of the building, a temporary loan of £3. 500 
was effected. 
The schoolhouse is a large and handsome building of Oamaru stone with an orna- 
mental frontage of 130 feet, providing accommodation for 50 boarders. It contains — 
three large dormitories, four class rooms, a master’s common room, a boy’s dining 
room and reading room, besides the accommodation of the rector’s house. A portion 
of the 30.acres has been made into cricket and tennis grounds. A fives court and 
gymnasium have also been erected. ra 
The climate of the district is exceedingly goed, being dry and bracing. 
The tuition fees are 10 guineas per annum; for brothers, 8 guineas; but scholars 
from the primary schools in the county of Waitaki are at £4 10s. per annum; Aon 
brothers £3 3s. per annum. The year is divided into three terms. 
The position of second master at the commencement of the school was secured by 
Mr. A. C. Gifford, B. a., of St. John’s College, Cambridge. There were 15 applicants. 
Financial ee was rendered the board (in order to enable it to provide. 
scholarships) by the Hons. H. J. Millar and Robert Campbell, Mr. Shrimski,M. H.R, 
and by Messrs. John Reid and George Jones, jr. Si 
The boys’ high school was opened May 15, 1883, 19 pupils being in attendance, © 
In about four years the number had reached 62; the average attendance has been 
about 40. Many boys from outside the district neat as boarders. . 
The Waitaki Girls’ High School was established in October, 1887, in response to a 
_ strongly expressed wish of the community that there should be a secondary school _ :

a osnace for girls as well as for boyes The Waitaki County council kindly granted 
the use of the county council building in exchange for the custom-house, which the _ 
government had granted to the Waitaki high school board, the former building 
being in a much better locality for the school. The government also granted a por- 
tion of a reserve for a playground. 
Mrs. Burn, who had for fourteen years been lady principal of the Otago Girls’ High 
School, Dunedin: but who had retired from that position in 1884, was offered and 
accepted the position of lady principal. The school was opened October 19, 1887, 
with 9 pupils, Mrs. Burn conducting it alone till the end of the year. In February, 
1888, 27 pupils were entered on the school roll, and Miss Forbes, m.a., of New Zea- 
Jand University, was elected first assistant. 
The full high school course of study. was then inaugurated. In 1889 the pupils 
reached 47 in attendance and a second assistant was appointed. At the end of the 
second year, 1889, one pupil was sent up for the matriculation examination of the 
New Zealand University and passed. One was sent up for the Otago education 
board senior scholarship examination and was successful in securing one of the 
scholarships. In the third year, 1890, the number of pupils was 37. In that year 
_ the standard of New Zealand University junior scholarship was reached.’ One girl 
_was sent up for the examination and passed with credit, thus giving proof of the 
high character of the work done in the school. In 1891 the school in common with 
all the secondary schools in the colony suffered in its attendance, but still main- 
tained its character for high-class work. 
The course of study includes English, French, Latin, mathematics, science, draw- 
ing, drill, and class singing. Tuition fees are £8, sisters, £6 per annum, divided 
_ into three terms. ss 
Both of these schools were established by act of parliament, the intention being 
that they should form a connecting link between the primary schools and the uni- 
versities. 
Although changes ‘have taken place in the teaching staff, both schools have been 
under the superintendence of the same head teachers since their inauguration and 
are still under the management of a board of governors. 
An endowment of about 2,000 acres was set apart by parliament in the county of 
Waitaki for the purpose of the board. A considerable portion of the money borrowed 
for the erection of the school buildings has been paid off out of the proceeds of 
sales of portion of the reserves referred to. 
OTAGO. BOYS’ AND GIRLS’ HIGH SCHOOLS. 
The Otago Boys’ High School has all along been doing very good 
work, and has sent out a very large number of youths who in their vari- 
ous walks of life have done and are doing infinite credit to themselves 
and to the school. That is owing in no small degree to the zeal and | 
loyalty of Mr. Brent and the other able masters employed in the school. 
The present buildings were opened by his Excellency Sir William 
Jervois, governor of New Zealand, on February 11, 1885 and occupy a 
most suitable and commanding position adjoining the town belt. The 
plan of the building is that of a main central hall, around which are 
grouped the several class rooms. The central hall is 74 feet long by 
43 feet in width and is 30 feet in height, with a gallery carried around 
both sides and ends. The several class rooms both on the ground and 
upper floors are very spacious, lofty, carefully ventilated, and fitted 
with all requisites and appliances to suit their purposes. The drawing 
school has been constructed on the most approved system, and is fully

\ farnished with models, plaster casts, and other materials of the .art. — 
_ The science room is supplied with requisites for the teaching of practi- 
eal and theoretical chemistry and metallurgy. It also contains acces- : 
sories to the teaching of physiology. The mathematical school has been 
excellently constructed for its purpose both as regards light and con- 
trivances for demonstration. The gymnasium has been furnished on the 
exact model of that at Aldershot, and ranks among the best equipped 
in the colony. The grounds on which the school buildings are erected 
cover an area of about 64 acres; a large space around the school has 
been asphalted, and is occupied by five courts, tennis courts, ete. There 
-is also a large cricket field adjoining the school grounds. 
The rector’s residence and the janitor’s lodge are near the school. 
The public of Otago are indebted to the influence and untiring efforts 
of Sir Robert Stout for having secured to them so suitable and so-valua- 
ble a site for the boys’ high school. The boarders’ house, under the 
superintendence of Mr. Morrison, English master, is situated about five 
minutes’ walk from the school, and occupies one of the finest sites in 
Dunedin. It is surrounded with recreation grounds covering an area 
of about 7 acres with commodious play sheds and asphalt tennis court, 
etc. The building was designed expressly for the purpose of a board- 
ing institution for the high school boys, and the equipments are very 
complete and in every way suitable. 
The board of governors is incorporated under an act-passed in 1877, 
_and consists of the mayor of Dunedin ex officio, two gentlemen appointed 
by the governor in council, two appointed by the education board, 
and two appointed by the NA University. The following: are the 
present. members of the board: 
Rey. D. M. Stuagt, D. D., chairman; Geo. Grey Russell, esq., honora- 
ble treasurer; the Hon. W. H. Reynolds, m. L. ¢.; Rey. A. R. Fitchett, 
Mm. A.; Henry Clark, esq.; John Hislop, LL. D.; his worship the mayor 
of Dunedin; Colin Macandrew, esq., secretary. 
The staff of the school is as follows: 
Rector.—The Rey. Henry Belcher, M. 4., LL. D. (fellow of Kings College, London). 
Masters.—Mechanics: Daniel Brent, m. a., Cambridge, formerly senior scholar of ~ 
Queen’s. English: W. Buller Williams, B. a. (London and Bonh), honors in German 
and English. Classics: M. Watson, mM. a., Edinburgh, first-class honors in Lit.Hum.; 
Gray Universityscholar. Modern languages: The rector. Science: G.M. Thomson, 
F.c.s. Writing and drawing: Robert Anderton, first-class certificate in drawing 
of the science and art department, South Kensington. Arithmetic and lower master: 
John Macpherson, F.E.1.8. Assistant in the upper school: Jolin R. Montgomery, 
M. A., junior university scholar, New Zealand. Assistants in the lower school: Va- 
cant. Art master: David C. Hutton, principal of the school of arts. Assistant art 
master: David E. Hutton, assistant in the school of art. Gymnastics: John Hanna, 
late instructor Scots Guards. Manager of the boarding house: G. M. Thomson, 
F.0.8. Assistant: J. R. Montgomery, M.A. Janitor: John Wallace. 
The school consists of two departments: (a) The upper school; (b) the 
lower school. 
The classification of subjects is such that on entering the school a boy J

or mathematics. His place is determined by his standard attained at a 
primary school, or by an equivalent test if he has not attended a pri- 
mary school. : 
The upper school prepares boys for the university, for the learned 
professions, and all-public examinations. 
Boys who are studying for the science degrees of the university, or 
for the profession of engineer, or for any other calling in which a 
knowledge of Latin is not compulsory, may omit the subject of Latin. 
The rector will always do his best to meet the special requirements of 
boys whose school time is drawing to a close, but in ordinary cases the 
school curriculum is strictly followed. The rector can always make_ 
- arrangements for a boy who wishes to learn Greek. : 
- Drawing is taught in all classes below the lower'v class. The draw- 
ing school is constructed on the most improved system, and fully fur- 
nished with models, plaster casts, and other materials of the art. 
The science school is supplied with requisites for the teaching of 
practical and theoretical chemistry and metallurgy. It also contains 
accessories to the teaching of physiology. 
_ The mechanical school is constructed for its purpose, both as regards 
light and contrivances for administration. 
The gymnasium is furnished on the exact model of that at Aldershot, 
and ranks among the best equipped gymnasiums in the colony. Gym- 
nastics, according to. an approved course, form a part of regular school 
studies. : aie 
The lower school is under the immediate charge of the arithmetic 
master, who is responsible for this department, and in conference with 
the rector, pays close attention to all the details of management. 
_ <A lecture is given weekly to the lower boys on physiography, heat, or 
some scientific subject. Z : 
The boarders’ house is specially fitted up for the accommodation of 
boarders. Itis situated about five minutes’ walk from the high school, — 
occupies a fine position adjoining the town belt, and is surrounded by 
extensive recreation grounds. The rooms are Jofty, well ventilated, 
and arranged with a view to the health and comfort of the pupils, who 
are at all times under strict control and superintendence.

_ with the school under the management of Mrs. B. R. Mackay. The e 
following is a short sketch of the history of the school: ° 
j The Otago Boys’ High School was opened in August, 1863. About a week after- 
, __-wards (August 11) an ably-written leading article on the subject appeared in the 
Otago Daily Times. After dealing with the subject of the boys’ school in a very 
_ Appreciative manner the writer proceeds as follows; ‘‘The high school, however, 
— wants a companion institution. There is one direction in which we have attempted 
* little and done less to promote the best interests of education and of families; we 
- mean inthe provision made for the education of girls, especially after they have 
_ arrived at an age when it is untasteful to their friends and obviously unwise that 
_ they should remain in the mixed common school.” _ Then follow some well put argu- 
ments in support of the proposal to establish a girls’ high school and the article con- 
- eludes as follows::‘‘It is to be hoped that a high school for girls will be promptly 
organized in Dunedin.” A day or two afterwards, a letter appeared in the Daily 
Times over the signature ‘‘ Paterfamilias,” thanking the editor for his sensible and 
_ well-timed article and suggesting that pressure should be brought to bear upon the 
_ government to take steps for the establishment of the proposed school with the least 
possible delay. This was the first occasion on which the proposal to establish a 
girls’ high school in Dunedin was publicly discussed, and it is only due to the Otago 
Daily Times that this fact should not be lost sight of, but before and after the pub- 
lication of the article referred to the subject received careful consideration from the 
_ education authorities, and it was fully resolved that a girls’ high school should be 
established as soon as the difficulties that interposed should be removed; the chief 
of these being inability to procure a suitable site and building for the purpose. 
In the provincial council on November 4, 1864, Maj. Richardson moved the follow- 
ing resolution, of which notice had previously been given by Mr. Reynolds: 
, (1) That it is expedient to give encouragement to the education of girls beyond 
_ that afforded by the ordinary district schools; and 
(2) That the government be requested to submit to the house during the next ses- 
sion some scheme by which this result could be obtained.” , 
3 The subject continued to receive Consideration from time to time, but nothing 
_. definite was done until June, 1869, when on the motion of Mr. J. L. Gillies it was re- 
solved by the provincial council “‘that the government be requested to appoint an 
honorary commission to determine the best site and scheme for a high school, and 
to consider whether it is expedient that provision should be made in the same build- 
ing for the teaching of girls as well as boys.” The commission consisted of the fol- 
lowing members: The Rey. Dr. Stuart (chairman), Mr. Justice Ward, the Hon F. D. 
_ Bell, and the following members of the provincial council: Messrs. Reynolds, Turn- 
bull, McIndoe, McLean, Reid, Haggitt, Duncan, Gilles, and Mouat. 
In addition to other documents, the commission had before it aletter and papers 
* received from a committee of ladies in Otago, who greatly interested themselves in 
the proposed establishment of a girls’ high school. The late Mrs. E. B. Cargill was 
president of the committee, and Miss Dalrymple was its most indefatigable secre- 
tary. The committee expressed its deep obligation to the ladies’ committee-and to 
_ Miss Dalrymple, and embodied in its report a number of the recommendations made 
tothem. The commission recommended that the rector’s residence and boarding 
establishment should be removed to another locality, and that the rooms to be 
vacated, together with such additional accommodation as might be found necessary, 
should be occupied as a girls’ high school, a residence for the lady principal, and a 
boarding house for girls from a.distance, and that the other portions of the building 
should be enlarged and adapted to the purposes of a boys’ high school. 
On the opéning of the school under Mrs, Burn at the end of 1870, the several addi- 
. tions and improvements recommended by the commission were completed, and the 
education board was placed in aposition to open the girls’ school and to organize it

in accordance with the commission’s recommendations. Mrs. M-Gordon Burn, for- 
merly lady superintendent of Geelong Girls’ College, was appointed lady principal, 
and the following teachers were also engaged: Miss Macdougall (now Mrs. Neish), 
first assistant; Mrs. Rhind, resident governess; Miss Huie (now Mrs. Borrows), resi- 
dent music governess, and Miss Bell (now Mrs. McGlashan) and Mr. Lees, visiting 
music teachers. The services of Mr. D. C. Hutton as drawing master were secured, 
and these have been continued ever since. Mr. G. M. Thomson rendered valuable 
seryice for some years as conductor of the class singing lessons. It was also arranged 
with the rector that.the masters of the boys’ school should give lessons in some of the 
higher subjects to classes in the girls’ school, 
The prospectus issued by the board set forth that the object of the institution was 
to impart to girls a thoroughly useful and liberal education, combined with careful 
moral and religious instruction; that the ordinary course would embrace a thorough 
English education, viz, reading, grammar, composition, eloeution, history, natural 
science, geography, writing, and arithmetic, and also class singing, drawing, French, 
and industrial work, prdnas competent t teachers would be ee for music, singing 
(private lessons), Seartiie and calisthenics, German, and other branches that iotty 
afterwards be found desirable. The school was opened on February 6, 1871, with a 
roll of 78 pupils. By the end of the quarter there were 102 in attendance, and at the 
close of the year there were 130 names on the roll, including 16 boarders. It was 
now found necessary to enlarge the school buildings both for day-school and for 
boarding-house purposes. In 1872 the number enrolled was 125. In the beginning 
of 1873 it was found advisable to discontinue the arrangements under which some of 
the masters of the boys’ school gave lessons to the senior classes in the girls’ school 
and to transfer the services of Mr. Pope wholly to the latter. The number on the 
school roll at the end of 1873 was 137 and the average for the year 126. In 1874 the 
attendance had increased to 155, and the accommodation again became insufficient. 
The number of pupil boarders had increased to 24 and want of room compelled Mrs. 
Burn almost every week to decline receiving.more girls. The board was therefore 
under the necessity of again making considerable additions to the building. Mrs. 
Burn had thrown so much energy and zeal into the performance of her onerous and. 
responsible duties that she somewhat overtaxed her strength and towards the end of 
1874 the board asked her to accept leave of absence for a few months. A temporary 
substitute was engaged and the work of the school was satisfactorily carried on. 
In 1875 the average quarterly enrollment of pupils rose to 168. The number of girls 
receiving music lessons in connection with the school was 77. _As the upper division 
of the school became more and more composed of pupils who had been trained inthe 
lower classes, a higher standard of attainment began to be reached than was at first 
possible. In course of time the work devolving upon the lady principal consequent 
upon the increasing number of day scholars and pupil buarders became so onerous” 
that, in response to her own proposal, the board resolved to relieve her of the care 
‘of the boarding establishment, so that her time and energies might be confined 
solely to the superintendence of the day school. Mrs. Martin’ was accordingly 
placed in charge of the boarding house in July, 1876, Mrs. Burn giving up the occu- 
pation of the official residence. Mrs. Martin continued to preside over the boarding 
department until the beginning of 1878, when the board of governors that had been 
appointed under the high-school act of 1877 reverted to the original arrangement 
and placed Mrs. Burn in charge of the boarding institution as well asthe day school. 
Under the board of governors the school continued to prosper as in former years, 
the only difference being the occasional inability of Mrs. Burn’s strength to bear 
the strain imposed uponit by the energy and zeal in the performance of her weighty 
and responsible duties. With a view to reduce the strain, the board of governors 
“in 1883 resolved to secure the services of a highly-qualified vice-principal, who should 
also act as mathematical teacher, and Sir F. D. Bell and Prof. Sidgwick, of Trinity 
College, Cambridge, were requested to make a suitable selection in the home coun-

November, 1883, and has ever since performed them in a highly satisfactory manner, 
- In 1884 Mrs. Burn was compelled by the state of her health to resign the lady prin- 
cipalship. It is very generally admitted that from first to last Mrs. Burn per- 
_ formed the duties of her office with rare ability and with a devotion and zeal that 
could not be surpassed and that under ber superintendence the Otago Girls’ High 
School proved an uninterrupted success. The following is an extract from the 
inspector-gereral’s report on the school about the time of Mrs. Burn’s retirement: 
“ December 1, 1884: The Otago Girls’ High School, which I visited on 17th of Sep- 
‘tember, maintains its high character for efficiency. Mrs. Burn, who has conducted 
it for so many years with distinguished ability, is about to retire.” ° 
ee z MR. ALEX, WILSON, M. A. 
On Mrs. Burn’s retirement the board of governors invited Mr. Alexander Wilson, 
_M. A., to accept the rectorship of the girls’ high school. Mr. Wilson had for many 
years greatly distinguished himself as English master of the boys’ high school and 
on the occasion of Dr. Macdonald’s absence in 1884 had fulfilled the duties of acting 
- rector of the boys’ high school with much ability and success. Miss Bathgate was 
at the same time placed in charge of the boarding institution. Under Mr. Wilson 
and his very efficient staff the girls’ high school has well maintained its high char- 
acter in allrespects. The average attendance has been 190, 
e BUILDINGS. ; 
_ Qn the removal of the boys’ high school in February, 1885, to the new buildings 
in Arthur street, the whole of the premises in Dowling street were given up to the 
girls’ high school. The buildings are extensive and commodious and are situated in 
a healthy and central locality, easily accessible from all parts of the city and sub- 
urbs. The main building contains a spacious central hall, in connection with which 
_are a2 number of class-rooms well furnished and adapted to the purposes of the 
school. Ample and suitable accommodation is provided for the lady manager of the 
boarding establishment, the resident governess, and a number of pupil boarders. 
The girls’ bedrooms are large, well lighted, and well ventilated, and are exceedingly 
comfortable. Each boarder occupies a separate bedroom. ‘There are six bathrooms 
_ with shower baths and hot and cold water laid on. Every possible requirement for 
an institution of the kind seems to have been provided, and everything has been 
arranged with a view to the health and comfort of the boarders, who are at all times 
under strict control and superintendence. The boarding department is under the 
‘direction of Miss Bathgate, a lady of high character and much experience. The 
_récreation grounds cover an area of fully 2 acres, very completely fenced, within 
which there are tennis courts, a fives court, play sheds, a large and exceedingly 
well-equipped gymnasium, etc.

: Pupils entering this school from the State schools are classified according to their 
attainments in English and arithmetic. Arrangements exist by which pupils who 
up to the time of entering the school have confined their attention entirely to the 
_ work of the standards may begin such secondary subjects as higher English, Latin, 
French, mathematics, and-science. At the commencement of each session a begin- 
ners’ class is formed-for Latin and French, and to any pupils who make exceptional 
| progress an opportunity is given later in the session of joining a more advanced 
division. 
Those who join the first form are expected to be able to read and spell fairly well 
and to know the four simple rules of arithmetic. 
In connection with the science Glass there is a fully furnished laboratory supplied 
_ with apparatus for praaiton chemistry, as well as with microscopes for higher bot- 
anical work. 
An art studio has been fitted up with the necessary appliances (easels, models, 
pottery) and has been placed under the charge of Miss Fanny Whimperis. The art 
~ course includes frechand, outline, and perspective drawing, and for more advanced 
pupils studies in chalk, monochrome, water colors, and oils. Such pupils, besides 
their special hours of instruction, are allowed to work in the studio during certain 
hours of every school day under the supervision of Miss Wimperis. 
There is a large and well-equipped gymnasium attached to the school and the 
pupils have two lessons weekly in gymnastics. Too much emphasis can not be laid

     on the opportunity to ay attending the school of receiving a systematic. and com- 
plete physical training. In order to take full advantage of the gymnastic training 
it is necessary that each pupil should be provided with a special gymnastic dress. 
The school is provided with a library containing upwards of 600 volumes of useful 
and entertaining works, which is open to pupils on payment of an annual subscrip- 
tion of 2s. 6d. 
Reports are sent quarterly to the parents set are idender to assist them in judg- — 
ing of the progress that has been made by their children during the quarter. is 
At the end of the session, class prizes and certificates of merit are awarded to the — 
most distinguished pupils. 
When any pupil has been absent, she must, on her return, produce a note pehed 
by a parent or guardian explaining the cause of absence, and no pupil is allowed to 
leave during school hours without a note. e 
The quarter days are February 1, April 19, and September 27.

THE SOUTHLAND HIGH SCHOOL. 
Jig 
The Southland Boys’ and Girls’ High School is situated at Thverear- 
gill and was incorporated by an act of the general assembly in 1877. 
The board of governors consists of the mayor of Invercargill ex officio, 
two persons appointed by the educational board of Southland, and two. 
appointed by the governor in council. The following letter from the 
secretary of the board contains a short sketch of the school: > ~ 
The girls’ school was established in the beginning of thé year 1879, with 57 pupils 
on the roll. At this time the work of the school was carried on in a public hall, 
» pending the erection of school buildings. In 1880 a substantial brick building was. 
erected and a boys’ school was opened in 1881, both schools being carried on in the 
same building. These schools opened with 45 boys and 55 girls. During the last — 
few years the district has been passing through a severe commercial depression and 
the numbers on the rolls at the end of 1891 were 22 girls and 46 boys. The number 
has increased this term and it is expected it will steadily increase as the cloud is 
being removed and a more prosperous period is evidently dawning upon us, 
The staff of teachers comprises a head master, having control over both schools, 
with two assistant teachers on each boys’ and girls’ side. ” /

      Tn the te school the usual branches of a first mie secondary education are ~ 
taught. In the boys’ school parents and guardians may choose between a classical 
pad. a commercial course. A well arranged chemical laboratory has lately been 
_ erected, with comptete apparatus and chemicals, and instruction in this branch is 
imparted to both schools.

UNIVERSITIES. 
The first university founded in New Zealand was the Otago Univer- 
“sity, founded and incorporated by ordinance of the superintendent and 
provincial council of Otago in 1869. It was given power of grant- 
: ie degrees in arts, medicine, and law, and received a large grant of 
land. In 1872 itreceived a further endowment to aid its medical school. 
It opened in 1871 with 3 professors. It now has 9 professors and 19 
‘lecturers. The following is a list of the professors:

In’ 1874 it ceased to grant degrees and became affiliated to the New 
Zealand University. It has the only medical school in New Zealand. 
In 1870 a New Zealand university act was passed. It provided for a 
university managed by a council and a senate; a council of 20, of 
whom 12 shall be laymen. The senate was to be constituted when 
the graduates numbered 20, and should then consist of the graduates. 
Colleges could be affiliated and degrees in art, medicine, laws, and 
music conferred. No religious test was to be administered. It was to 
be a teaching body employing professors. If the Otago University 
agreed to diss@lve and give its reserves to the New Zealand University 
the New Zealand University was to be established in Dunedin. Agree-— 
ment had to be made within six months, but the New Zealand Univer- 
sity did not meet in time to allow the agreement to be made. Ulti- 
mately it was agreed that the New Zealand University should be an 
examining and scholarship and degree-granting body, and this agree- 
ment was embodied in the 1874 act. Two royal charters have been 
granted to the university—one in the year 1876 and the other in 1883, 
These charters give power to confer the following degrees: Bachelor 
and master of arts, bachelor and doctor of law, medicine, music, and 
science. The university is managed by a senate of 24 fellows, elected 
for life. There is a convocation consisting of graduates above the 
degree of bachelor, and all bachelors of two years’ standing. It has no 
legislative power. The senate and convocation alternately fill up vacan- 
cies in the senate. 
The Otago University has very substantial stone buildings. They 
are situated in Dunedin, on a considerable area of Jand. There are

to the *public which contains a very fine collection of New Zealand 
fauna and flora, metals, etc. It is managed by the professor of biology, 
-and he has his lecture rooms adjoining. The Otago Institute has also 
a very fine scientific library.

  SECONDARY EDUCATION IN NEW ZEALAND. 
The Auckland University College was, founded in 1882, and has a _ 
statutory grant of £4,000 per year from the colonial parliament. It is” 
affiliated to the New Zealand University, and has 4 professors and 1 _ 
lecturer, as follows: 
Classics and English.—Charles Alexander Maclean Pond, B. a., London. ‘ 
Mathematics.—William Steadman Aldis, m. a., Cambridge. 
Chemistry and experimental physics. —Frederick Douglas Brown, honorable M. A., 
Oxford; B.sc., London, F.¢.s. 
Eatoay and geology. epee Phillips Withiel Thomas, M. A., Oxford; F.L.s. 
Music.—Carl Schmitt. 
It is the only university college that has a professor of music. 
The Auckland College has been rather at a disadvantage for build- 
ings. It has two separate buildings, but these are, it is hoped, only 
temporary structures. As soon as the university is in funds no donby / 
new and more suitable buildings will be erected. 
MATRICULATION AND JUNIOR SCHOLARSHIP EXAMINATIONS. 
In order to ascertain the standard of education of secondary schools, 
it will be necessary to set out the matriculation and junior scholarship 
examinations. Secondary schools generally compete with each other for 
these scholarships, or, if they fail in scholarships, to obtain a position 
for their pupils in the list of merit. 
The subjects for the matriculation examination are as follows: 
1. English: Grammar and composition, with précis-writing. 
2. Arithmetic: Fundamental rules, vulgar and decimal fractions, DEeporHen) and

BRIEF CONSPECTUS OF THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM AND OPERATIONS 
IN 1890 AND 1891. 
[France: Republic; area, 204,092 square miles; population (census, 1891), 38,218,903.] 
The public system of education in France comprises all grades of 
scholastic institutions, primary, secondary, and superior, which derive 
their support from State and local appropriations. Authority over : 
these is vested in a cabinet officer, the Minister of Public Instruction — 
and Fine Arts,? who exercises his control through a large body of 
officials appointed by himself or by the President of the Republic in 
advice with the minister. These officials belong either to the central 
ministry or to the local subdivisions, i. ¢., académies (17 in number). 
Each of the three grades of instruction constitutes a distinct depart- 
ment of the system under the charge of.a director? who ranks next in 
authority to the minister. While the operations of each department

time the Ministry of Worship, formerly combined wae that of justice, was trans-. 
ferred to his province.

    are regulated by laws and decrees special to itself, nevertheless each 
académie forms an administrative unit, the academic chief, i. e. rector, 
being the virtual head of all the public institutions of his académie. 
He is the sole intermediary between the minister and the superior 
_ institutions (facultés), but for the service of secondary and primary 
instruction there are also general inspectors who report immediately 
to the minister. 
The minister is assisted by the superior council of public instruction, 
a representative body of 60 members, three-fourths of whom are elected 
by their peers fram the-various orders of public instruction, the re- 
mainder being appointed by the President. The council is not only an 
advisory, but also a judicial body, being the final court of appeal in 
certain cases of contention; as, for example, cases of the removal of 
teachers by local authorities. ; 
Professors of superior and secondary public institutions, and teachers 
of public primary schools constitute a State teaching force whose re- 
quirements are determined by law or ministerial decree;. salaries are 
regulated and paid by the State. 
The public technical schools of France (Heole polytechnique, Bcole 
supérieure des mines, etc.) are not comprised in the system, the minister 
of public instruction sharing the control over these with other minis- 
ters. Private schools are also outside of the system, although the con- 
ditions under which they may be established are determined by the 
minister of public instruction, and they are measurably subject to State 
supervision. e 
_ In respect to the control and conduct of primary instruction, two 
orders of the political divisions of France, 1. ¢., departments (90 in num- 
ber) and communes (80,000),! are treated as divisions and subdivisions 
of the académies. 
The chiefs of departments (préfets) have a measure of control over 
primary schools; these must be established by the communes. Neither 
rectors nor préfets have unlimited control in their respective provinces, 
but must act upon the advice of local councils (academic and depart- 
mental), which, like the superior council, are elective bodies, composed 
of members of the teaching profession, inspectors, etc. In each acadé- 
mie there is an inspector (inspectewr @académie), who directs the gen- 
eral work of the primary schools. A constant inspection of individual 
_ schools is maintained by the primary inspectors, of whom there are 450 
or one to about 150 schools, distributed among the departments as the 
number of schools may demand. These inspectors, both academic and 
departmental, are appointed by the minister. No person is eligible to 
- the inspectorate who has not successfully passed the examination for x 
  
'The departments are the chief division for local administration. They are di- 
vided into arrondissements, each of which contains generally a number of communes. 
It happens, however, that large towns often fill up one or even more arrondisse- 
ments in which case the arrondissement becomes a part of the commune. Thus Paris, 
- which is one commune, comprises 20 arrondissements,

“the inspector’s diviomé (certificat @aptitude & Vinspection des wale: 
primaires). 
It would seem from this survey that locally constituted guthorities 
have little control in educational matters. This is true with respect to 
the higher orders of education, but not so in respect to primary schools. 
Communal authorities have here a decisive voice, since they furnish 
buildings and equipments and a proportion of the fund for current © 
expenditure. The views and wishes of taxpayers are made known 
through the communal councils, and the power of the purse causes — 
them to be respected. In Paris, for example, where the school expenses 
are entirely provided from local funds, the communal council! is the 
controlling power. 
The following statistics from the latest official report show the opera- 
tions of the system whose general features have been outlined. 
Scholastic institutions and statistics for 1890-91.—To the department 
of primary instruction belong infant schools (Zcoles maternelles, age8 2 
to 6 years), enrolling in 1890-91 a total of 709,579 children (public, 
465,333; private, 244,246); primary schools (elementary ages, 6 to 13; 
higher ages, 12 to 14 or 16) enrollment, 5,593,883 (public, 4,384,905; 
private, 1,208,978). Of the total number 41,018 were in- higher prima- 
Ties. Boys and girls were about equally represented, viz, 2,823,428 
and 2,770,455, respectively. The teaching force numbered 152,436 per- 
sons (women, 86,965, including teachers of infant schools; men, 65,471), 
‘distributed as follows: Infant schools 8,686 (public, 5, 133; private, 
8,553); primary schools, 143,750 (public 101 2723 private, 42,478). 
[Public primary schools numbering 67,318 comprised 100,064 classes; private pri- 
maries, 14,672 in number, 38,166 classes. Of the public schools 72 per cent, and of 
the private 32 per cent, had but one class. A completely graded primary school 
comprises three divisions: Elementary, ages 7 to 9; intermediate (moyen), 9 to ‘1; 
superior, 11 to 13. Each division has two classes. Promotions are made annually. 
The certificate of primary studies which exempts from farther compulsion as regards 
school attendance is required for promotion to the superior division and also admits 
eandidates to the higher primaries. Although the test is not obligatory the number 
of candidates annually increases. Thenumber successfully passing this examination 
rose from 165,211 in 1889 to 173,368 in 1890 and to 184,506 in 1891. 
The following statistics reported January 1, 1891, in comparison with the previous 
year are interesting: Number of school libraries, 38,240; number of volumes, 
5,111,204; increase, 771 and 213,991 respectively. Teachers’ reference libraries (bib- 
Tiothéques pédagogiques), 2,634, with 963,538 volumes; increase, 25,251. Number of 
school gardens, 51,989; gymnasiums, 6,318; workshops, 742; increase, 109, 369, and 3, 
respectively. School savings banks (caisses d’épargne scolaires), 20,689; number of 
. depositors, 453,319; amount deposited, 12,830,355 francs ($2,566,071); these figures 
show a slight decline since January 1, 1890. The funds for aiding poor children, 
purchase of prizes, etc. (caisses des écoles), numbered 16, 212, an increase of 37 over — 
1889. The total receipts for 1890 amounted to $1,062,149 and the disbursements to 
$828,008. Teachers’ mutual benefit associations (sociétés de secours mutuels) to the 
number of 41,931 were in operation with a capital of $1,065,142.]

into committees for various public services.

    EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91, 
The department of secondary instruction (enseignement secondaire) 
~ includes the classical schools, which are of two orders: lycées or state 
schools whose courses lead to the bachelor’s degree, and colléges com- — 
— munaux, a class of local colleges whose curricula are modeled, so far as __ 
_ practicable, upon those of the lycées. 
Private classical schools (called lycées or seminaires) are maintained 
- with the consent of the minister. In 1891 the enrollment in the pub- 
lic classical schools for boys was $3,764 students, and in the private 
90,063, or a total of 173,827. There were also 11,645 students in public 
lycées and colléges for ae 
The department of superior instruction comprises the state facultés, 
4. ¢€., groups of professors (at present 59 in number!) who maintain 
courses of instruction and lectures in letters, sciences, law, medicine, 
pharmacy, and Protestant theology, and are also the only authorities 
empowered to examine for and confer degrees; that is, they perform 
the same functions as the universities of other countries. They gener- 
ally have their seat in the principal town of their respective académies 
the academic rector being their official chief and the intermediary be- 
- tween them and the minister. Private facultés also maintain courses of 
- instfuction but can not confer degrees. 
The number of students on the registers of state facultés the 15th 
of January, 1891, was 20,785, which with 931 in private facultés gave 
a total of 21,716 students in university courses. 
To the foregoing statistics of attendance should be added 7,491 in the 
primary normals, about 75 in the superior normal schools for women, and 
130 in the Ecole Normale Supérieure, making a sum total of 6,518,346 
pupils and students, private schools for girls not included. Of this 
- total 70 per cent were in publicinstitutions. For purposes of eompari- 
- son with other countries it is best to eliminate the 709,576 children in 
~~ infant schools. This done, there remain 5,808,770 youth under formal 
instruction. This number is equivalent to 15.19 per cent of the 
_ population.? The primary school enrollment alone, infant schools not 
included, was equivalent to 14.63 per cent of the population. 
  
1There are also three superior schools of pharmacy and three of medicine and 
pharmacy of equal rank with the facultés,and fourteen schools of medicine and 
pharmacy, and three of science and letters, classed as preparatory. These are borne 
on the same budget as the facultés. To the department of superior instruction 
belong also the great special schools under the exclusive control of the minister of 
public instruction, i.¢., Collége de France, Ecole Normale Supérieure, Muséum His- 
toire Naturelle, Ecole aeeainpaiss de Rome, Ecole Frangaise d’Athénes, ficole Nationale 
des Chartes, Ecole Spéciale des Langues Orientales Vivantes, Ecole Nationale et 
_ Spéciale des Beaux Aris i Paris, Conservatoire Nationale de Musique et de Decla- 
mation, The Ecole Libre des Sciences Politiques, at Paris, is a private institution of 
high rank, 
2Census of 1886, legal population 38,218,903. The school attendance: of Algiers, 
82,457, is included, but not the population (3,910,399). For obvious reasons the use 
of the latter would produce a greater error in the calculation than that of the for- 
mer alone,

leges) constitute a state professional corps. The former are appointed EDUCATION IN FRANCE, __ ee) 
“4 
by the President of the Republic upon the recommendation of the 
superior council and the minister, the latter by the minister. The 
service is guarded by examinations and by the requirement of a uni- 
versity degree which for professors-of secondary schools must,be at 
least the bachelor’s degree, and for the facultés the degree of doctor. 
The conditions of the service, duties, penalties, etc., are carefully reg- 
ulated by ministerial decree. Salaries range from $900 to $2,200 per 
annum in the facultés and from $420 to $1,500 in the lycées. The Heole 
Normale Supérieure, maintained by the state, is the alma mater of the 
' most distinguished professors. The teaching service of lycées for girls 
is under special regulations, and a state normal school (cole Normale 
Supérieure, Sevres) is maintained in the interest thereof. 
The teachers of primary schools must obtain a state diploma (brevet 
élémentaire, supérieur) awarded upon examination. This requirement 
had been met in 1890 by 98.6 per cent of the teachers in publit prima- 
ries and by 82 per cent of those in private. Only lay persons can be 
employed in the public schools, a requirement now enforced in all pub-. 
lic schools for boys. Salaries, which are paid by the state, are graded 
in five classes, ranging, in the elementary primaries, for men from $200 
to $400, and for women from $200 to $320 per annum, in the higher 
primaries from $360 to $560, and in the primary normals, for men from 
$700 to $1,000, and for women from $600 to $1,000. Communes must 
provide residences and may supplement the salaries. Through the 
‘academic inspectors the state maintains a supervision over the teachers 
engaged in the schools, but their appointment, tenure, and discipline 
are in the power of the prefects, subject, however, to the advice of the 
departmental councils and the approval of the inspectors. Every 
department is legally bound to maintain two primary normal schools, 
one for men, another for women, or a consolidated normal school. This 
obligation has been fully met as regards schools for men, and in 86 out 
of 90 departments as regards schools for women. The state also main- 
tains two superior normal schools to prepare professors for the depart- 
mental or primary normals. 
Course of study in primary schools.—It may be added that the course 
of study which primary teachers must be prepared to conduct is exten- 
sive, including, besides the three elements, moral and civic instruction, 
the metric system, history and geography, object lessons, first notions 
of science, elements of drawing, singing, manual work (needlework for 
girls), gymnastic exercises, and, for boys, military drill. In the higher 
primaries the course is much like that of our nonclassical high schools, 
with large development on the scientific and technical sides. 
Finances.—The funds for the support of this comprehensive system — 
of public instruction are derived from state and departmental appro-

             -priations and from a communal tax for primary schools. ‘Tuition fees 
are required in facultés! and secondary schools, but the amount so 
received is turned over to the public treasury, the state appropriating 
each year a sufficient sum for current expenditures. In all primary 
schools tuition is free. 
The proposed state appropriation for mabuE education (1892) is 
172,924,627 franes ($34,584,925), of which 73 per cent is for primary 
eiiestion: 11 per cent for secondary, 8.8 for superior, 2.2 for adminis- 
tration, and 5 per cent miscellaneous? The total expenditure for pub- 
lic primary schools (infant included) in 1890 was 162,681,805 franes 
($32,536,361). Of this, 64.7 per cent was contributed by the state and 
_ the balance by the communes. The marked increase in the relative 
proportion derived from the state (it was 50.6 per cent in 1889, as against 
64.7 in 1890) is due to the fact that the state has assumed the responsi- 
bility of paying the salaries of teachers. The expenditure was equiva- 
lent to $6.68 per capita of enrollment for the year specified (4. e., 1890). 
Although every part of the educational system of France has been 
developed by the Republic, the primary schools have been its especial 
care. The progress of these schools is therefore properly regarded as 
an index of the strength and spirit of the Government. The universal 
interest which the history of this department excites gives importance 
to the following exposition of its development from a recent work by 
M. E. Levasseur: 
Parr II. 
THE PROGRESS OF PRIMARY SCHOOLS SINCE GUIZOT’S LAW, 1833. 
The government of Louis. Philippe, outcome of a revolution, ought 
from the outset to have shown itself favorable to popular education. 
It was not, however, until after the failure of several projects that M. 
Guizot secured the passage of a law, June 28, 1833, which was,in a 
certain sense, the fundamental charter of primary instruction in France. 
This law imposed upon every commune the obligation to maintain an 
- elementary primary school and provided for the support ofthe school 
by an extra tax of 3 centimes in addition to the three direct taxes. It 
fixed a minimum of 300 franes ($60) for the salary of the teacher, who 
had, moreover, the right to school fees paid by the parents who were 
not indigent. The law provided for the free instruction of the indigent 
  
1By a decree of July 25, 1885, the facultés were empowered to receive, hold, and 
administer property, a right conferred upon them at the time of their constitution 
(1801), but suspended in 1875. The work of organizing’ the facultés of each acadé- 
mie into organic bodies is in progress. The bill for converting them into distinct. 
- universities is before the chambers,

classes, the expenses of the same being equitably distributed among. 
a series of authorities extending from the family to the state. Wher- 
_ ever communal resources were inadequate for this purpose, they were 
to be supplemented by subventions from the departments not exceeding ~ 
a levy of two additional centimes, and if need be, by subventions from 
the public treasury. The law also created higher primary instruction 
(enseignement primaire supérieur) and primary normal schools. Under — 
the influence of this law 2,275 schools were opened in a year, 450,000 
new pupils were there enrolled, and 15 normal schools were founded. - 
The law of 1833 provided only for schools for boys. An ordinance of 
1836 extended the same advantages to girls, without, however, impos- . 
ing upon the communes, as the law had done, the necessary expenses. — 
In 1848 the number of pupils enrolled had reached a total of 3,500,000, 
This was an increase of 31 per cent over the enrollment in 1837, , date 
of the first general statistics of primary schools. It was equivalent 
very nearly to 10 pupils for every 100 inhabitants. The revolution of 
February, 1848, gave rise to new projects. The Republicans demanded — 
gratuitous and obligatory instruction. The legislative assembly, how- 
ever, prompted by the conservative and religious party, passed the law 
of March 15, 1850, which proclaimed “liberty of instruction,” made the 
maintenance of schools for girls obligatory, suppressed several useful 
creations of the law of 1833, and opened wider the gates to clerical 
instruction (enseignement congréganiste). 
The second Empire, which at first showed some suspicion of the teach- 
ers, finally improved their salaries somewhat, and afterward, under the 
ministry of M. Duruy, passed the law of April 10, 1867; which provided 
for an extension of free instruction and imposed upon every commune 
having at least 500 inhabitants the obligation to maintain a separate 
school for girls. 
In 1872, after the tempest which overwhelmed the Empire, the pri-~ 
mary schools of France, reduced in number by the loss of Alsace-Lor- 
raine, enrolled 4,722,000 pupils. The increase since 1837 had been 75 per 
cent. The third republic has not displayed less zeal than the first in 
behalf of primary instruction, but, more concerned with practical appli- 
cations than the first republic, has manifested her zeal by acts. Recog- 
nizing that public instruction, useful under all governments, is indis- 
pensable under a democracy, and that it is not only a benefit to the 
people who receive it, but-a powerful instrument of political discipline 
for the government which gives it, the Republic has desired that the 
state should become the master of schools in order to develop in this 
double interest a system of education more widely distributed and con- 
ceived in the spirit of republicanism. 
Diverse projects have been successively discussed in the parliaments 
since 1871. They have resulted in a series of laws, nearly all passed 
during the presidency of M. Grévy, and the most important under the 
ministry of M.-Ferry.

By means of subventions or advances to the communes, which in ten 
_ years.(1878-1888) reached a total of 527,000,000 frances ($105,400,000), 
_ these laws have’ caused the construction or the repair of more than 
20,000 schoolhouses (laws of June 1, 1878, August 2, 1881, and of June .- 
20, 1885). They have provided in every department for normal schools 
for women (law of August 9, 1874), regulated the schools of manual 
_ apprenticeship (law of December 11, 1880, and decree of March 17, 
_ 1888), decreed the absolute gratuity of primary instruction (law of 
_ dune 16, 1881), rendered primary instruction obligatory (law of March 
28, 1882), regulated (law of October 30,1886) in a general manner the 
organization of primary instruction, andl decided that the public schools 
in the future should be exclusively under lay teachers;! determined 
(law of July 15, 1889) the salaries of teachers should be paid henceforth by 
_ the state, with additions in certain cases specified of communal subsidies 
(for indemnity for residence); increased tenfold the subventions of the 
public treasury, and thus transferred from the families and the com- 
munes to the state the greater part of the responsibilities and expenses, 
which in 1887 reached a total of 173,000,000 francs ($34,000,000) expendi- 
ture by the state, the departments, and the communes, not including 
the cost of the construction and repair of schoolhouses. 
The republic has ameliorated the condition of teachers, a policy in 
accord with the interests of a democracy. While recognizing that it is 
in general more advantageous for the teachers that they should depend 
upon the state rather than upon the communes, and that the greater 
part of the changes accomplished during the past fifteen years have 
been to the advantage of instruction, I have not seen without regret 
the abolition of school fees, which did not prevent the free admission 
of indigent pupils and which brought into the school funds from 
16,000,000 to 18,000,000 franes ($3,200,000 to $3,600,000), and the sys- 
et elimination of the religious orders fom public instruction, 
whose codperation regulated and ‘Superintended by the administrative 
authority was useful, and whose relegation to the private schools has 
divided interests and excited religious passions. The republic shows 
itself also to be inspired with the sentiment of democracy in construct- 
ing schoolhouses everywhere, as, after the year 1000, the middle age, 
inspired by religious faith, created new churches or rebuilt after a new 
type the ancient edifices. = 
While approving the ~policy of constructing suitable schoolhouses 
(and despite the critics it appears certain that the great majority of the 
buildings have not exceeded the requirements),? it seems to us that it |

would haye been more economical to have proceeded more slowly and _ 
with sole regard to pedagogic interests. But Iam departing frommy _ 
subject in treating of these matters. 5 £ 
What seems to be certain and what it is important to consider here, 
is the fact that a vigorous impulse has been given to primary instruc- 
tion by these measures taken together, i. e., the creation of schools, the 
division of large classes, the increase in the number of teachers, the atten- 
tion given to their preparation, the improvement of material appliances, 
by the emulation even which has been excited between the laity andre- 
ligious orders, in fine by the increase of the school attendance of both 
sexes. From 1872 to 1889 the number of schools increased by 11,000 and — 
that of their teachers by more than 22,000; the number of church private | 
schools increased by more than 3,000, while the private lay schools — 
diminished, being ruined and paralyzed between the two great powers, 
- church and state. The number of pupils entered upon the registers of 
schools of all classes during the same period rose from 4,722,000 to 
5,623,000 (Algiers not included), - 
Since 1837, in fifty years that is, the number of pupils has more than 
doubled, although the population of France, including the European 
populotion of Algiers, has gained during the same time only 13 per 
cent. (La population frangaise, par M. EB. Levasseur, Tome 2, pp. 
481-485.) 
Although the primary school attendance of France increased by 19 
per cent from 1872 to 1889, the last five years of this period shows a 
decrease amounting to 10,009 pupils or a little less than two-tenths per 
cent. Small as this diminution is, the fact has excited attention and — 
given rise to many explanations. M. Levasseur has made an exhaus- 
tive analysis of the statistics bearing upon this point with the follow- 
Ang results: 
The decrease noted is attributable wholly to the public primaries, 
which lost from 1884-85 to 1889-90 a total of 127,487 pupils as against 
a gain of 117,478 in private primaries. The absolute loss (10,009) is ex- 
plained by the decrease of the school population (of age 6 to 13). From 
estimates based upon the census of 1886 and the ratio of births 1874 to— 
1880, M. Levasseur concludes that the school population fell from 
4,729,000 in 1885 to 4,663,000 in 1890, a decline of 66,000, or a little more 
than 1 per cent. This itis seen is ample to cover the decline of less 
than two-tenths per cent in school attendance, The analysis of the 
statistics by departments confirms this view. For twelve departments 
which have lost each more than 2,500 pupils, M. Levasseux’s estimates 
give a decline of 42,325 in school population. The census of 1891 fur- 
  
maximum has been 45,529 francs ($9,105) for the Rhone, and the minimum 7,982 franes 
($1,592) for the Lozére. These buildings are not all of the same dimensions; the 
place for a pupil, which furnishes the most precise term of comparison, has cost on 
an average 306 francs ($61), theSeine not included, with a maximum of 480 francs 
($96) Eure-et-Loir, and a minimum of 135 francs ($27) Vendée. 
 
-P-A-G-E-136
    104 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
_- nishes proof of the correctness of this estimate, as these same depart- 
ments are in the list of thirty-five whose total population was less in 
1891 than in 1886. On the other hand, the twelve departments which 
_ showed an increase of school attendance from 1885 to 1890 are with a 
‘single exception in. the category of thirty-two which had more inhabit- 
ants in 1891 than in 1886. As to the gain in attendance made by the 
private primaries at the expense of the public, M. Levasseur observes 
that this is a natural consequence of the enforcement of the law exclud- 
ing church teachers from the public schools. The term allowed for 
_ giving full effect to this law in schools for boys expired November 1, 
1891. Ifthe change noted had not taken place it would have proved 
that no public school in which church teachers were formerly employed 
was reorganized as a private school after the removal of those teachers. 
This is neither true nor under the circumstances conceivable. 
Part III. 
HIGHER PRIMARY AND CLASSICAL SCHOOLS,OF FRANCE. 
The department of secondary instruction in France (enseignement se- 
condaire) includes only classical schools, i. e., lycées and colléges com- 
munaux, but secondary instruction as we understand the expression is 
also the province of the higher primary schools (écoles primaires su- 
périeures), which are classified in the elementary department (enseigne- 
ment primaire). 
General characteristics of higher primary scho ols.—These higher pri- 
mariesmay be described as nonclassical schools, which carry the instrue- 
tion of pupils for two, three, or four years beyond the elementary prim- _ 
aries. The establishment for this higher instruction takes the name of 
complementary course (cours complémentaire), if it is annexed to an 
elementary primary school and placed under the same director; if 
installed in a separate building and under separate direction, it is rec- 
ognized as a high school (école primaire supérieure). The complement- 
ary courses are limited to two years. If the school has a three years’ 
course, it is called full or complete (école de plein exercice). A fourth 
year may be added. 
Two classes of higher primary schools are recognized, viz, profes- 
sional (technical) and nonprofessional. The former, by a decree of July 
28, 1888, have been classed with the schools of ‘manual apprenticeship 
under the joint control of the minister of public instruction and the 
minister of commerce and industry; they have as yetlittle more than 
legal existence and do not enter into the present consideration. 
The term nonprofessional, applied to the ordinary higher primaries,

is not intended to imply the neglect of manual or even of technical 
training, but simply that this training is not directed to the Pequires. 
ments of special trades or industries. 
These higher primary schools are established at the instance 6f the 
departmental councils with approval of the minister of public instruc-_ 
tion. The communes furnish the buildings and the funds for current 
expenses, assisted by a subsidy from the State. The directors, who 
are appointed by the minister, must have a special diploma (certificat 
aptitude au professorat des écoles novmales et des écoles primuires su- 
périeures) or its equivalent. The professors are also appointed by the 
minister; assistant professors, by the prefect, upon the nomination of the 
academic inspector. The only requirement for admission to the schools 
is the certificate of primary studies. The State encourages attendance 
by-bursaries, which are awarded upon the results of competitive exam- 
inations. The course of instruction is determined by general pro- 
grammes elaborated in the superior council of public instruction and — 
approved by the minister. 
Numerical progress.—Although authorized by Guizot’s law of 1833, 
public higher primary schools made little progress until 1878, when a — 
credit of $22,000 was allowed asa fund in aid of the communes for © 
their establishment. Since that date appropriations for them have — 
annually increased and there has been a corresponding increase in the — 
number of the schools themselves, which rose from about 40 in 1878 to 
226 in 1887, at which latter date there were also 431 complementary 
courses, the enrollment in both schools and courses being 30,7251 
There were also at the same date 47 private higher primaries, which 
raises the total enrollment to 38,441.27 In 1890-91 the enrollment in 
public higher primaries reached a total of 41,018,’ which is nine-tenths 
of one per cent of the total enrollment in public primaries. With this 
brief survey of the general status of the higher primary schools in mind ~ 
we may form a better idea of the scholastic provision which they offer 
by considering more particularly the schools of this class in Paris. 
Scholastic work.—The programme maintained in the schools of the 
capital may be taken as an index of their highest scholastic develop- 
ment. As given in the following table it is uniform for all the higher — 
printaries for boys, but undergoes some modifications in its application _ 
to the schools for girls:

“Phe following particulars relative to the schools of Paris, from a spe- 
cial report on the subject, will help to give some idea of the conditions 
under which the above programme is developed.! 
Number of schools and pupils.—In 1891 the city maintained for boys 
four day higher primary schools (Turgot, Colbert, Lavoisier, Arago), one 
igh school with a boarding department (Jean-Baptiste Say), and for 
girls one day high school (Sophie Germain). A second high school for 
girls was authorized in 1884 and the buildings for the same commenced 
in 1890. The five schools in operation afforded accommodation for 
about 3,400 boys and 340 girls. The new school will make provision 
for about 450 additional girls. The actual enroliment in these schools 
in 1890 was 2,712 boys and 340 girls. All the schools have the fall 
_ course, including the additional fourth year; 17.62 per cent of the boys 
and 29 per cent of the girls were in the last two years of the course. 
‘There were at the same time 2,178 pupils (981 boys, 1,197 girls) in com- 
plementary courses. Each an of the course corresponds to a class; 
each class is comprised in one or more divisions, as the number of pupils 
the same year. 
_ Leaching stafi—The staff of a higher primary school at Paris com- 
‘ises always a director, professors, and tutors (mattres répétiteurs). —

    EDUCATION IN FRANCE, 
The professors are assigned to special subjects and are present only 
during the hours of their respective classes. Im 1890 the number at- 
tached to the schools for boys was 165, of whom 14 gave lessons in two 
or more schools. The-tutors are comprised in two classes, one employed. 
wholly in the oversight of the pupils out of class hours and the cther 
combining instruction with this oversight. The total of this class of 
teachers in 1890 was-58. The staff of the high school for girls consists 
of a directress, 16 professors, a teacher of sewing, and 11 tutoresses — 
(mattresses répétitrices). te 
Prior to the passage of the law of July 19, 1887, by which the State 
assumed the responsibility of paying all the teachers of primary schools 
at fixed rates, the professors and tutors in the high schools of Paris 
were paid by the hour. By special provisions, authorized by a decree 
of August 3, 1890, the city of Paris virtually retains control of the 
salaries of its teachers. Directors of the higher primaries receive a 
minimum salary of 7,000 franes ($1,400); maximum, 9,000 francs — 
($1,800), and full professors (titulaires), from 3,800 franes ($760) to 
5,000 franes ($1,000). The decree referred to authorizes the employ- 
ment of auxiliary professors, who are paid by the hour at the minimum — 
rate of 300 francs ($60); maximum, 500 francs ($100) annually, for one 
hour a week. It should be noted also that the decree provides for the 
employment in each school of a general superintendent of studies (sur- 
veillant général des études.) : 
Buildings and material.—The housing and equipment of these schools — 
are on a liberal scale. They differ necessarily in details, the later — 
schools having the advantage of the experience of the earlier schools. 
The following features are common to all the schools: Class rooms 
(amphithédtres) adapted to the various subjects of instruction; study 
halls (salles d’études); rooms for library and for illustrative apparatus 
(salles de collections et bibliothéques); workshops for wood and iron work 
(ateliers de travail manuel); open and covered courts-for recreation — 
(cours de récréation avec abris et préaux couverts); kitchen and dining 
rooms (cuisine et réfectoire). "There are also living rooms for the director _ 
and other officials who reside on the premises, and for the attendants, — 
janitors, ete. : 
In the schools for girls, the workshops are replaced by rooms fitted _ 
up with all the appliances for eutting, fitting, sewing, laundry work, — 
cooking, ete. All books and school material are provided gratuitously. 
Daily routine.—The -daily exercises of the schools are from 8 o’clock 
to 5:30 each day in the week, excepting Thursday, when the session 
closes at 12:30, and Sunday, when there is no session. For holidays, 
there are ten or twelve days at Easter, three at New Year’s, all other — 
legal holidays, and a summer vacation lasting from the beginning of —

The succession of recitations, study hours, and recreation is care- 
fully arranged to secure sufficient diversity in, and relief from, brain 
work. The duration of study or of class must not exceed an hour. 
~ One may follow the other, but at the end of the second period a quar- 
ter of an hour must be spent in exercise. Dinner and play occupy the 
hour from 12 to1. Pupils who live near may dine at home, others pur- 
chase their dinners for a small sum at the school. 
The discipline of the schools is wholly moral, even the punishment 
which may be inflicted in the elementary primaries, i. e., detention after 
school and extra task to be done at home, being forbidden in the higher 
primaries. The most effective restraint upon willfulness is found to be 
the notes of complaint or warning inscribed upon the weekly report 
which is sent to the parents. These notes diminish the chance of the 
culprit for obtaining the annual prizes which are the rewards of good 
“conduct and successful effort, and also deprive him of the right to share~ 
in the funds for the aid of children whose parents are too poor to sup- 
port them through the years of advanced study. It should be said 
that. love for their teachers, interest in their work, and a sense of 
honor seem to be, for nearly all pupils, sufficient incentives to obedience 
and diligence. : 
Finances.—For the support of the higher primary schools whose work 
has here been briefly outlined, Paris made appropriations in 1890 as 
follows: 1,458,780 francs ($291,756) for the five schools for boys, and 
169,100 franes ($33,820) for the schools for girls, or a total of 1,627,880 
francs ($325,576). Of this amount 27 per cent was appropriated for 
material and 73 per cent for salaries and other emoluments of the teach- 
ing corps. The receipts in the school Jean-Baptiste Say, which, as 
already stated, has a boarding department, were 400,700 francs 
($80,140), which leaves as a net expenditure for the city $245,436. 
This, it should be noticed, does not include the expenditure for the 
~ complementary courses, nor for the Collége Chaptal. The latter insti- 
tution is a municipal school for boys, of a different order from the higher 
primaries. Its programme covers the ground both of the elementary 
and higher primaries, with a much larger extension of the scientific 
branches and the addition of Latin. Pupils enter at about 8 years of 
age and remain for ten or twelve years, as in the lycées or classical col- 
 leges. The enrollment in this school in 1891 was 1,235. It was main- 
tained at an expense of $88,503 franes ($177,700). The receipts amounted

to 652,258 franes ($130,451), leaving an expense to the city of $47,249. 
The Collége Chaptal belongs in reality to the secondary department of 
the French educational system. In this department Paris is repre- 
sented further by 9 lycées, 2 colléges, and 3 private schools. 
THE CLASSICAL SCHOOLS (lycées) WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO RECENT MODIFI- ~ 
CATIONS. 
The recent decrees modifying secondary courses of study in France — 
(viz, decrees of August 8, 1890, and of June 4, 1891) pertain to the 
classical schools for boys. Of these, the representative or typical 
schools are the lycées. These are institutions founded by the state 
with the codperation generally of the cities in which they are located, 
and controlled from the central authority. They number at present 
107, and comprise about one-third of the students (#, ¢., 173,827) pursu- 
ing secondary courses. The communal colleges (numbering 235) are 
an inferior order of classical schools, established by individual com- 
  munes with the aid of the state, and offering so far as practicable the 
same courses of study as the lycées. This uniformity extends also to 
private lycées and seminaries, a natural consequence of the policy which 
makes the lycée course the preparation for the bachelor’s degree. The 
lycée is often compared to the American preparatory school; the com-_ 
parison might hold if we should add to the latter two years of college _ 
work, and place the bachelor’s degree at the close. Even then the 
lycée course would seem to be the fuller as regards Latin, and 
modern languages. We shall gain a better idea of these institutions by 
examining their organization and programmes. They comprise boarding 
and day departments, and both household and scholastic routine are 
minutely regulated by ministerial decrees. The scheme of study is” 
arranged for three divisions, elementary, grammar, and superior. The 
first two are subdivided each into three classes, the third into four. 
Each class is designed for a year’s work. 
A lad enters at about 8 years of age, having already mastered 
the elements of reading and writing, and if able to work at high 
pressure all the time will take his bachelor’s degree at eighteen. This 
is seldom done without duplicating at least a year, or enduring a severe — 
strain, as will be readily inferred from an examination of the programme — 
appended to this article. 
This programme is one oyfcome of the new decrees, which are 
intended as reform measures; to understand them in this intent it is 
necessary to know something of the antecedent conditions. 
Origin and organization.—The name lycée was adopted by Napoleon 
(1802) for the schools which he had purposed to take the place of the old _ 
colleges suppressed by the convention (1793). The plan of studies 
authorized by the Emperor, é. ¢., of two parallel courses, the one based — 
upon Latin, the other upon mathematics, marks in France the beginning 
 
-P-A-G-E-142
    of the effort to give equal recognition to all departments of knowledge.! 
From the moment of the adoption of this plan of study, the scope and. 
adjustment of secondary studies became, in the superior council, the 
absorbing educational problem. One scheme after another was tated 
nd abandoned, and the schools were kept in a perpetual state of change? 
until 1865, when a scheme, ‘elaborated by M. V. Duray, then minister 
of education, was adopted. The organization of the full course under 
is scheme was as follows: ~

The decree authorizing this plan was dated March 2, 1865; in June 
Mowing, an innovation proposed by M. Duruy was also determined 
  
1The central schools which the convention created to replace the suppressed col- 
-leges were essentially scientific schools. On a total of 14 professors assigned to each 
‘school, one only was allowed for the ancient languages. See decree of February 
25, 1794 (7 Ventose, An. 111), Art. 2. 
2In 1809 the parallel courses were abandoned fer a single course, and Greek, which 
had been dropped, was restored to the programme. In 1821, under Louis XVIII, the 
course was again changed, the sciences being assigned to a specialsection not leading 
to a degree. In 1826 there was a return to@ uniform course. In 1840 M. Cousin 
again attempted to provide for the sciences by special courses of inferior rank to the 
classical. In 1851, under Louis Napoleon, parallel courses were once more established, 
Sora detailed account of these successive experiments, see Statistique de Penseigne- 
ment secondaire, 1865, pp. XVI-XXVI. 
There was also a special class of mathematics intended to prepare candidates 
for admission to the Polytechnic, the Superior Normal school, and the Central 
‘School of Arts and Manufactures. : 
_ 4There were two forms of this diploma, baccalauréat és sciences complet and restreint. 
The latter, sciences limited, sufficed for candidates entering the medical faculties, 
since they must also be provided with the degree in letters.

who expected to enter upon industrial or commercial careers It was 
codrdinated to the courses of the primary schools and thus made a way 
for the admission of the bourgeois class as distinguished from the no- 
bility, the military, and the professional classes, who had enjoyed her e- 
tofore the monopoly of the lycées.? 
The most radical departure in the regular course accomplished by M. — 
Duruy was the new baccalaureate (bachelierds-sciences). This gave to 
the sciences a sanction heretofore sacred to letters and offered it on 
easier terms, 4. ¢., a single examination in place of the two required in 
letters. The measure was in violent opposition to scholastic ideals _ 
which were the heritage of ages® and whith had been intensified by — 
  
1A similar course was a feature of a reform measure submitted by a special com- 
mission and embodied in a statute of Mareh5, 1847. The revolution of 1848 prevented — 
its execution. = 
2It is in the lycée that the élite of our youth, magistrates, administrators, officers, » y 
diplomats, authors, receive all the general instruction that they will carry into life. 
In them is accomplished the apprenticeship of mind, and it may be said in advance 
that whatever gaps and deficiencies exist in secondary instruction will show them- — : 
selves in the intellectual life of the nation. (Quelques mots sur Vinstruction pub- 
-lique en France, par M. M. Bréal, p. 157.) z : : 
*Says M. Bréal: ‘‘ When, afterconsidering primary instruction, we pass to thestudy _ 
of the lycées, we feel ourselyes upon ground very solid and unyielding. Here we 
encounter foundations six or seven centuries old, for it is not the facultés which con- ‘ 
tinue the ancient University of Paris ; it is oursecondary instruction which has received. 
this heritage and which by sranstect ties connects itself with the ancient College of > 
Sorbonne and further back with the cloister school of Notre Dame.” 
Having briefly summarized the work of the Jesuits and the catastrophe of the — 
Revolution, M. Bréal continues: : 
“A single establishment survived. The College Louis-le-Grand, more anciently — 
the College of Clermont, lived through the Revolution under the successive names — 
of the Institute of Foundation Scholars (Institut des Boursiers), College of Equality — 
(Collége deV Egalité), French Prytanis (Prytanée Frangais). Despite these new appel- 
lations, the studies and the professors remained thesame. In 1804it was called Lycée 
Impérial, and by a remarkable example of multiplication became the model and the ~ 
father of all the lycées and colléges created or established throughout the extent of — 
the Empire.” (Quelques mots sur Vinstruction publique en France, pp. 152, 153.) _ 
Of this same institution, Jules Simon says: ‘‘ This College of Clermont, which took 
then the name of Louis-le-Grand, with its 500 resident students (internes) and its 
innumerable day scholars (exlernes), resembled very closely the Louis-le Grand of 
to-day, and this resemblance appears not less marked if we compare the general sys- 
tems of control (réglements). I speak not of the moral direction, but simply of the. 
plan of studies.” (La réforme de Venseignement secondaire, par Jules Simon, Pp. 
197, 198.) 
Says M. Berthelot: “As early asthe end of the sixteenth century, we read in the pr 
grammes of study for 1583, of the College of Guyenne (schola aquitanica) a complete 
organized. system comprising ten years, from the tenth (dixidme) to the second and 
first (our rhetoric), a system absolutely parallel to our existing secondary instruc- 
tion save that the programmes were purely literary.” (La Crise de Penseignement — 
secondaire, Revue des Deux Mondes, March 15, 1891, p. 352.)

their incorporation with the pedagogical system. of the Jesuits.! In 
this system the organization of the schools played as important a part 
features of the organization were revived in the lycées and are retained 
tothe present day. The difficulties in the way of any attempt to modify 
Secondary instruction in France can not be understood without taking 
these features into account. 
Briefly stated they are: 
(1) A system of general education complete in each institution and 
uniform for all, absorbing the time and the energies of the élite of the 
nation for the ten or twelve plastic years of youth. 
(2) A domestic régime (internat, the lycées, like the Jesuit colleges, 
being boarding schools) in which the personal surveillance of students, 
while it is perhaps less constant and subtle than under the Jesuits, is 
supplemented by a mechanical routine even more repressive. 
(3) Separation of household from scholastic régimes, professors non- 
resident, students in charge of household officials, and tutors (maitres 
_répétitewrs), of whom there is generally one to every thirty students. 
(4) Control, complete and absolute, emanating from a central and 
external authority, 7. ¢., the state replacing the ecclesiastical order. 
__ (5) An official sanction, the baccalauréat, at the end of the course, 
which is the necessary passport to civil office, to professional studies, 
and to social prestige. 
A system so ordered naturally tends to develop a class or caste in a 
community, and to its spirit literary studies lend themselves more 
readily than scientific. 
_ The new baccalaureate (that awarded for science) and the special 
- course, really struck at the roots of the system. M. Duruy, however, 
laid chief stress on the necessity of bringing new studies into organic 
union with the old. ‘Our studies,” he said in advocating his plan, “ are 
not combined in such a manner as to promote the salutary equilibrium 
of all the intellectual faculties. Our scholars are too widely separated. 
_ Those in the scientific course have not enough of letters and those in 
the course of letters not enough of the sciences.” ? 
* The effort to crowd all branches of knowledge into the curriculum 
soon resulted in serious overpressure or superficial attainments; mean- 
while the lycées were disturbed by the clash of conflicting interests, and 
_ further reforms became imperative. These were discussed within the 
superior council and urged from the outside by those who realized the 
importance of science in the industrial competition of the age and the 
peril to France in the physical degeneracy of her educated youth. 
Trend of recent efforts at reform.—In 1872 Jules Simon, at that time 
_ minister of public instruction, gave a new direction to reform measures 
pes.

   by a ‘circular addressed to the 1 pMnpaS ( proviseurs) of the lycées. His 
instructions were directed both to the spirit and to the methods of 
_ work. He urged the necessity of freer life within the schools, insisted 
upon gymnastics, military exercises, and out- door sports and- excur- 
sions, and called for radical changes in the methods of instruction as 
the only means of affording relief from the unnatural strain of brain 
work. Tivo exercises in particular he sought to eliminate, the making — 
of Latin verses and translations oral and written from French into 
Latin (themes). Time was thus to be gained both in class and in study 
hours for other subjects, particularly for foreign languages. “Every 4 
student,” he observes, “ must make choice either of English or of Ger- 
man.” These and other new subjects were to be pursued without the 
sacrifice of anything essential in the old, the latter being simply meaner 
to fair proportions.' : 
The influence of this circular is to be seen in every subsequent effort f 
atreform. It was final as regards Latin verse; the théme remains, butis 
greatly restricted. By the liberty which it gave to the principals, this _ 
circular also made a break in the uniformity and the rigid organiza-— 
tion of the schools in favor of individuality and the spirit of emulation. - 
The movement in this direction has been accelerated by the influence 
of the Ligue nationale de Véducation publique, and by the example of 
private schools, especially the Ecole Monge, at Paris,which have entered 
the lists unhampered by traditional practices. 
While new impulses were thus set in motion ‘within the lycées, the de-— 
mand for a reorganization of studies continued, and in 1888 a commis- 
sion was appointed by the minister to deal with the problem.? Their 
recommendations formed the basis of the decrees .already mentioned — 
(decrees of August 8, 1890° and June 4, 1891‘); the former pertaining to 
the general organization of the regular course of study, the latter to 
the special course. As the commission was under the presidency of 
Jules Simon, and composed largely of men in accord with his views, 
its work naturally follows the lines laid down in his circular as already — 
specified. Indeed in his instruction to the principals accompanying 
the new decrees and programmes, M. Léon Bourgeois, minister of publie 
instruction at the time of their issue, covers substantially the same 
ground as his predecessor. ‘He emphasizes the order relative to physical » 
training and exercise, advocates better methods of instruction, insists_ 
upon the elimination of useless exercises, leaves much freedom to the © 
principals in respect to the daily routine, and urges the need of a more 
natural and spontaneous activity among the students.®

    1 the regular course of study under the new scheme — be seen by os 
_ comparison of class work required under programmes authorized at 
ms successive periods of reform—viz, 1865,1880, 1885, ak , respectively. 
The time assigned to class work may properly be made the unit of com- 
parison if we keep in mind (1) the nature of class work. This consists 
chiefly of the examination of exercises (devoirs) accomplished i in study 
hours and a survey of the subject-matter of the suce eding exereises. 
There i is little interchange of ideas and knowledge between student 
id professors, such as takes place in our recitations; this is indeed 
feature which the reformers are endeavoring to change, and the new 
regulations call for more oral repetitions than heretofore. Instruction, 
as we understand the word, has been and still is in large measure the 
work of the tutors (mattres répétiteurs) in extra class hours rather than 
f the professors. (2) That the time assigned to study and exercises 
out of class is nearly double that given to class work—i. e., 7$ hours 
peer t 4 hours a day. 
With these facts in mind the following tables pertaining to the classi- 
eal course of the lyeées are suggestive. It should be observed that the 
elementary division and the class of philosophy are excluded from the 
view:

reality greater than appears from the above table. For the sixth anc 
fifth classes (sixiéme and cinquiéme) the total was 28 hours, 2 hours’ 
being assigned in each to music and 2 to gymnastics. For the fourth 
and third classes (quatriéme and troisiéme) the total was 27 hours, 
hours being assigned in each of these classes to gymnastics. Thepro- — 
portional amount of time given to the branches of study is hot affected 
by these exercises, while the table is simplified by their omission. The 
- removal of gymnastics from class time is not because physical exer- 
cises are less esteeméd than formerly; they are provided for in extr: 
class hours, which arrangement accords with the better conceptions 
that now prevail as to the place and bearing of this part of training. 
Religion was omitted from the class time in the programmes of 1880. 
Drawing assigned to hours out of class in 1885 was restored to its old 
pesition in 1890, The efforts at reducing the number of class hour: 
are all prompted by the stand made against overpressure, which it i 
generally admitted has become a great-evil. The table shows plainly — 
the tenacity of the old conception of liberal education. Latin, Greek, 
and French declined slightly in 1880 in favor of history, geography, 
and sciences. The tendency since that year has been to increase the 
time devoted to the former subjects, at the expense, however, of snes es 
languages and of science rather than of history. : : 
In the upper classes—third through rhetorie—French has gained 
relatively. Greek has larger recognition in the programme of 1890 
than that of 1880. : 
As regards the treatment of studies, the most importantmodificati mn. 
in the work of the lycées accomplished by the new regulations pertains 
to methods rather than to subjects. Some indication of the changes 4 
in this respect is made in the published scheme of study which is ‘given a 
in full, pages 120-124, exercises added or substituted since 1885 being | 
marked by stars. Language is still the chief subject in the course, but 
    
  
1 By a decree of December 24, 1881, issued at the instance of M. Paul Bert, then 
minister of public instruction and worship, it was ordered that this matter should be 
regulated in accordance with the wishes of parents. Clergy of all denominations — 
are consequently admitted to the lycées, with the privilege of giving religious in- 
struction outside of class hours.

ian formerly, The oral and written_exercises are more definite and

ading increased. 
_ Geography is somewhat extended, more attention being given to the 
geography of America, and that of France pursued more in detail. The 
ground covered in history remains about the same, although the time : 
devoted to the subjectis reduced. The same is true for the sciences, in 
rhich category mathematics is included. In both cases it is supposed 
that the course can be completed in the shorter time by the use of better 
pedagogical methods. 
_ As to the elementary division of the lycée, which, as stated, is not 
eomprised in the table, two changes since 1865 aicceeye attention, viz, 
-areduction.in the number of hours and the removal of Latin, which 
‘then appeared in the eighth or first preparatory class. The time 
us gained has been given to French. 
The class of philosophy occupies a peculiar position in the lycée; under 
the old programmes it followed the first examination (held before the 
Sacultés) for the degree of bachelor of letters. The endeavor is made 
to give its studies the university character, and many prominent men 
hhaye advocated. its removal to the faculiés, but as the change would 
involve also complete separation of the bachelor’s diploma from the 
lycée course, it can not be accomplished at present. It would be diffi- 
cult to convey an idea of the modifications in the course of the class of 
philosophy without going more into detail than is possible here. The 
distribution of time in this class at the datas selected for comparison

_ Change in the baccalawreate.—As the bachelor’s degree is the goal of | 
the lycée, the changes in this respect are of greater significance than 
the remodeled programmes. It will be remembered that the plan of 
Minister Duruy showed a bifurcated course after troisiéme. It was

  : possible for students’ to enter the seiontifie aeiuon “ 
- French mind. The studies of the scientific classes were determined 
should have pronounced the doom of this bifureation, which had not 
- of August 8 a single bachelor’s degree. This requires two examina- — 
‘tions; the first following the class of rhetoric; the second, a year later,     _ passed through any portion of the classical course; they might enter 
the class of preparatory mathematics from the special secondary cours 
or from other institutions upon examination. In a year they passed 
into elementary mathematics, there mingling with students from both 
troisiéme and seconde. This in itself is an irregularity hateful to the      
       
                   
   
    
                            
   entirely by the admission requirements of higher technical schools; 
hence in the judgment of those who advocated science on its merits 
“the programmes of bifurcation systematically stripped the scientific © 
course of an elevated and philosophical character.” Nor did the ex-— 
-pedient answer well the purposes for which it was adopted—the pro- — 
fessors of the higher schools complained that the students from the 
mathematical course could not hold their own with those who had — 
finished the course in letters. To complete the anomaly, the science 
course had also its baccalaureate; this excited all the classicists. The 
situation was aggravated by the ‘fact that the degree of bachelor of — 
science required one year less of work and but one examination. = 
Since the diploma carried prestige, the course of science drew stu- — 
dents away from that of letters. Between 1865 and 1867 the enrollment of — 
the former more than doubled both in the lyeées and in the communal 
colleges, which include the superior classes. Moreover, the ratio of | 
students in the scientific course to the total in the superior division — 
increased. For example, in the lycées it was 29.6 per cent in 1865, 37.3 
per cent in 1876, and 39 in 1887. Here was undoubtedly a prime cause — 
of opposition to the course. It is not surprising that the commission 
the value of a parallel course nor the completeness of a single course. 
For the three bachelors’ degrees! there was substituted by the decree — 
following the class of philosophy. All students must pursue the same — 
course to the end of rhetoric. In the following year, ¢. ¢., philosophy, : 
a trifurcation takes place, and the candidate may choose one of the three 
branches. According to that choice, he who successfully passes the 
final examination will have his diploma inscribed: “Lettres, philosophie;” 
“lettres, mathématiques;” or “lettres, sciences Dives et naturelles,” as 
the case may be. i : 
This change viewed in one way appears to be the victory of the. lit- 
erary over the scientific side, while viewed in another it indicates the _ 
- determination to make the intrinsic value of the scientific course eee 
to that of the classical. 
‘The examinations are passed as heretofore, not before the professors 
of the lycées but before the State facultés, 4. e., professional bodies who 
have had nothing at all to do with the instruction of the candidates. 
This policy is opposed in many quarters for reasons which can not

and barely escape being “plucked.” On the other hand, students who 
id not possibly pass at the Sorbonne or before other strict facultés 
ave been known to take themselves off to some of the less exacting 
rovincial facultés and there secure the coveted prize. To guard 
against these irregularities a new device has been adopted. This is 
the livret scolaire, or college certificate, as we might render it. This 
certificate presents a full report of the candidate’s standing in his lyeée 
through all the classes of the superior division, duly signed by the 
chief of the institution. This certificate, if presented at all, must be 
presented before the faculté of the district (académie) to which the par- 
ticular lycée belongs. It is noticeable, however, that the language of 
the decree leaves it optional with the candidate to produce his livret 
scolaire.’ ; 
The nonclassical course of the lycées—Much more radical than the 
changes in the classical course of the lycées are those in the nonclassical. 
This course, as we have seen, was created in 1865 under the name of 
‘Special secondary (enseignement secondaire spécial). It had its own pro- 
gramme (covering at first four years, increased subsequently to six), its 
own professors, and its own normal school (Beole normale spéciale de 
Cluny). Its attractions were increased by a diploma (baccalauréat de 
the bachelor’s degree through the mere force of numbers. The special 
aracter of the course consisted in the preparation which it was sup- 
posed to offer for business life, a purpose opposed to the ideal of culture 
fostered in the lycée. The impossibility of maintaining this character 
soon became apparent, and it was practically abandoned by the closing 
f the normal school of Cluny in 1891. The need of a course wholly 
modern in its spirit had, however, been abundantly demonstrated by 
he enrollment in the special course which, in 1887, comprised nearly 
one-third of all the students in the lycées. The special course became 
enseignement secondaire moderne by decrees of June 4, 1891. The new 
programme? and the instructions accompanying it are evidently in- 
itional spirit of liberal education, while at the same time answering 
the demands of students whose interests lie wholly in the practical 
ffairs of modern life. 
_ The programme offers an interesting study of adaptations. As may be 
seen by an examination of the table below, it gives largest scope to 
modern languages and the studies that relate to the conduct of life or to 
man’s social state, viz, literature, history, ethics, law. It has been aptly

haracterized as “literary, moral, esthetic, and scientific.”* Moreover —

        anid Hioatare, especially French. On the grammatical side, the nisin 
cal development of the language is to be considered, while the stud. 
of the several literatures is to be made wholly from authors of the 
highest order. The works selected present an interesting epitome of 
modern classical literature as judged from the French standpoint. 
_ The modern course is declared to be for “average minds;” it 
does not contemplate the training which makes scholars, leaders ¢ 
thought, investigators. Its most original feature is the expedient 
placing minds on the historic plane, or as expressed by the writer 
quoted above, “fer putting average minds as quickly as possible in” 
possession of those general notions which form the real basis of the 
moral and intellectual treasure of humanity and rendering them capa- 
ble of adapting those traditional ideas and knowledges fo the uses of 
modern life”. Whether or not this is a worthy end, the means pro- 
posed for its accomplishment deserve notice. It is to be done by the 
interpretation of the master works of antiquity based upon transl 
tions. These interpretations are to be presented by professors tho’ 
oughly acquainted with the original, and able, if need be, to translate 
as they interpret. Thus, while modern languages and literature are 
the center of the programme, they will not be wholly detached from : 
historic relations. om

To sum up the results of the new measures, they relax therigidity and 
relieve the routine of life within the lyeée; continue the reduction in 
written exercises and place more stress upon acquaintance with classic 
for a degree upon the same footing, and substitute for the special course 
a modern course which aims to be as separate from utilitarian purposes 
as the classical.

A sense of aaiane responsibility ath respect to ihe education of th 
_masses and a deep-seated regard for local independence and local initia- 
tive mark the educational policy within the British Empire. It is the 
excess of one or the other of these principles which gives special — 
character to this policy as it operates in Great Britain, in treland, in 
the colonies, and in British India and other dependencies. 
The feeble beginning in 1833 (¢.¢., the appropriation of $100,000 for 
school buildings) scarcely fontahiaeied: the part which the General 
Government was to take in the development of this interest in Great 
Britain. Without encroaching at all upon local rights or assumin 
local obligations, it has become the organizing power in elementar’ 
education and the chief source of its support, contributing in 1890-9 
about 45 per cent of the income of elementary schools, a proportion 
since increased to 70 per cent or moreas regards England, by the gran 
in lieu of fees. 
In England, as yet, only elementary instruction has been brought | 
into the form of a system, which is determined in its main features by 
the law of 1870. The law, passed two years later (1872), for Scotland 
has a more extensive range. In this, secondary schools are distinctly 
recognized; moreover, Scotch universities have a very close relation — 
to the Government, since parliamentary grants provide the larger part 
of their income. Hence, scholastic institutions of all grades in Scot 
land have a basis for organic union, which is wanting in England. 
Nevertheless, taken in its full sense, the word system must be consid- 
ered as relating only to the elementary schools of Scotland, which a: 
organized on substantially the same lines as those of England, 
SUPERVISION AND CONTROL. 
In both divisions of Great Britain the action of the General Govern- 
ment is limited to securing, through local agencies, sufficient school

Sstecdation. and to maintail ne an inspection of individual schools 
th respect to the conditions which entitle local managers to claim a 
share in the appropriations from the public treasury. This action is 
xercised through committees of the privy council (education depart- 
for England and the same for Scotland). The vice-president of — 
committee! is the virtual head of the respective system and rep-— 
sents its interests in the House of Commons when the appropriations 
or general regulations (codes) are under discussion. The local man- 
ers with whom the departments deal are (1) elected boards serving 
‘or three years; (2) private bodies or individuals whose schools are 
subject to Government inspection. 
The manner in which the government inspection is carried out has 
-among other advantageous results that of securing an unusual degree 
f precision in the official statistics. Once a year every school must be 
examined by a government inspector, who tests each class in the work 
a prescribed programme, examines the buildings and premises with 
reference to specified requirements, and passes judgment upon the 
general organization and conduct of the school. The results of the 
‘examination are recorded upon an official form, which is uniform for all 
inspectors. Upon this same form are entered, also, the number of chil- 
dren present at the examination and particulars taken from the teach- 
’s register, 7. ¢., enrollment, average attendance, number of sessions, 
ete. These registers are also uniform for all schools; they must be 
‘iginal copies and contain no erasures. From the inspectors’ reports 
the official statistics are compiled, and upon the basis of the same reports 
the government grant is distributed to the managers of the schools. 
For the maintenance of this inspection England is divided into ten 
tricts, each under a chief inspector. Under these is a foree of 107 
spectors, 45 subinspectors, and 152 inspectors’ assistants.. There are 
so two chief inspectors for training colleges, a special inspector of 
usic, a directress of needlework, and an inspectress of cookery and 
laundry work. , 
Scotland is divided into three districts, each having a chief inspector. 
der these are 25 inspectors, 4 subinspectors, and 21 assistants. 
SCHOOL ACCOMMODATION, ENROLLMENT, AND AVERAGE ATTENDANCE. 
By the codperation of public and private agencies school accommoda- 
ion has beeh provided in England for 5,641,360 children and in Scot- 
and for 735,889. In 1890-91 the schools on the Government list in 
Ingland had an enrollment of 4,833,329 pupils and the same in Scot- 
nd an enrollment of 680,580.

Scotland to 16.87 per cent of the total population (census 1891). The

The total expenditure in England was $38,052,123, slightly exceeding 
the income for the year. In Scotland it was $5,943,425. This repre-° 
sents for England an expenditure of $10.14 and in Scotland $10.73 
' per capita of average attendance in the inspected day schools. 
Fees remitted in Scotland by laws of 1889 and 1890 and in England 
by law of 1891 may still be charged if managers forego the fee grant 
and parents make no objection. That a free school system is generally 
desired is. indicated by the fact that in England 74 per cent of ele- 
mentary schools and in Scotland the entire number are now free for 
children of legal school age—i. ¢., 3 to 14 inclusive in the former, 5 to 
14 inclusive in the latter. 
Besides the proportional part of the current income furnished from 
local sources, as shown above, local managers must provide buildings 
and equipments. The general government has aided in this work by 
loans amounting in England to £23,846,174 1s. 4d. ($115,892,409) and. 
in Scotland to £4,859,357 16s. 73d. ($23,616,471). 
MEASURES AFFECTING ATTENDANCE, 
Since 1890 the policy of alloting the greater part of the grant! upon 
the results of the examination of individual pupils in the three obliga- 
tory subjects (reading, writing, and arithmetic) has been discontinued 
and the average attendance has been made the basis. The mode of 
determining this average is uniform for all schools, ¢.¢., by dividing 
the actual number of half-day attendances by the minimum number of 
half days (400) on which the school must have been in session. Man- 
agers, and indirectly teachers, have thus a stimulus to securing as 
large an attendance as possible. In Scotland their efforts are aided by 
1 The grant is comprised in the following divisions: 
(1) A fixed grant of 124s. to 14s. (10s. to 14s. Scotland) per pupil in average attend- 
ance. 
(2) A grant of 1s. to 14s. for discipline and organization, reckoned on average 
attendance. 
(3) Various grants in class and specified subjects. In Scotland a grant of 1s. to 
84s. is also allowed, according to the report on the general character of the instruc- 
tion in the three elementary subjects. Special grants (£10 to £15) are also allowed 
under specified conditions for schools in thinly populated districts. Grants of £1 to 
£5 are also allowed in respect to each pupil teacher required to make up the mini- 
mum staff who passes a specified examination and of £10 to £15 for each assistant 
teacher passing the examination for a government certificate. The total annual 
grant to a school, exclusive of the special grants to schools in sparsely settled regions, 
must not exceed 17s. 6d. for each unit of average attendance or the total income from 
all other sources. In other words, the government secks to stimulate, but not to 
replace, local effort. 
In England infant schools are treated separately, grants for them reckoned on the 
basis of average attendance being: 
(1) Fixed grant, 7s. to 9s. per capita of average attendance. 
(2) Variable grant, 2s., 4s., or 63. 
(3) Grant for singing, 6d, or 1s. 
(4) Grant for needlework, 1s. per capita of average attendance of girls.

the compulsory law which applies to all children 5 to 14 years of age, 
unless.they have secured a certificate of exemption. This may be ob- 
tained by passing the examination required at the end of the fifth 
school year, which is generally reached at 11 yearsof age. In England 
the ages of compulsory attendance, as well as the standard of exemp- 
tion, are left to local managers, but every school board must make by- 
Jaws upon the subject. 
The education laws also make provision for the school attendance of 
children of legal school age who may be employed part of the time 
under the laws regulating such matters, the departments determining 
the limits of attendance for such children. The English enrollment 
includes 173,040 half-timers, as they are called, of whom more than half 
are in Lancashire and one-fourth in Yorkshire. The Scotch schools 
enroll 30,602 half-timers. 
TEACHERS. 
As to teachers, the central departments require that the principal 
teacher of every school should have a Government certificate (awarded - 
upon examination after a probationary term of teaching) and the em- 
ployment, of an assistant teacher for every 50! additional pupils in 
attendance after the first 60, or a pupil teacher for every additional 30. 
The persons qualified to be recognized as assistant teachers are pupil 
teachers who have completed their engagement with credit and passed. 
the examination for admission totraining colleges, women above 18 years 
of age who have passed certain specified examinations? and university 
graduates. 
Pupil teachers are young persons between 14 and 18 years of age, 
whose time is divided between studying and teaching. Their service 
must not exceed twenty-five hours a week. Managers must make pro- 
vision for the instruction of*their pupil teachers, for which, as already 
noted, they may claim additional grants. The composition of the teach- 
ing staff for the year under review was as follows:

The proportion of women teachers in English schools is continually 
increasing, having risen from 55 per cent in 1870 to 714 per cent in 1891. 
In both countries the proportion of pupil teachers is declining; it is 
noticeable, however, that the most successful candidates for admission 
to the training colleges come from their ranks. 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
{ 
The training colleges have been founded and are controlled by pri- 
vate authorities (chiefly denominational), but theyreceive annual grants 
not exceeding 75 per cent of their total incomes from the Government 
upon specified conditions. With respect to these conditions, the col- 
leges are under Government supervision. The inspectors appointed for 
this service hold the examinations for teachers’ certificates at the several 
institutions. These examinations are obligatory for students of the 
colleges having free (7. e., Queen’s) scholarships, other candidates being 
also admitted. . 
The training colleges in England, 7. e., 44 residential colleges of long 
standing and 6 day colleges (established under regulations first issued 
in 1890), were attended in 1890-91 by 3,806.students. As the regular 
course of training is two years, these colleges are prepared to furnish 
annually 1,900 teachers, which would be sufficient to supply the an- 
nual loss (caleulated at 6 per cent) in a staff equal to two-thirds of the 
present number of certificated teachers. The training colleges of Scot- 
Jand, 7 in number, had an attendance of 860 students, which is nearly 
sufficient to supply the loss in the whole body of certificated teachers. 
About 18 per cent of the students in the Scotch colleges combine with 
their training attendance upon university classes, a tendency which is 
fostered by the liberality of the Government in including the fees for 
such attendance in the legitimate expenses of the colleges. 
In ranking candidates who pass the certificate examinations, special 
weight is given, both in England and in Scotland, to success in the 
examinations in science held by the Science and Art Department. 
Although the course of the training colleges includes service in the 
practice schools, graduates of these colleges, like other candidates, 
must pass a probationary term of teaching before receiving their certifi- 
cates. 
The expenditure for the training colleges for the year under review 
was as follows: England, residential colleges, £180,564 9s, 5d.; day, 
 
-P-A-G-E-164
132 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
£8,446 12s. 11d., or a total of £189,011 2s. 4d. ($945,055.50), of which the 
Government provided 66 per cent; Scotland, £40,916 11s, 2d. ($204,582), 
from Government 73 per cent. 
PENSIONS. 
The bill for pensions to teachers has made little progress during 
the year, although its ultimate passage seems certain. The National 
Union of Elementary Teachers maintains a committee to push the 
measure and to create a public-sentiment in its favor. 
ORGANIZATION AND CONDUCT OF SCHOOLS. 
The elementary schools recognized by the Government are infant _ 
schools, schools for older papils, and night schools. In board schools _ 
sectarian instruction is strictly prohibited; in private schools it must be 
given, if atall, before or after the hours of secularinstruction and must not 
be forced upon any child. Grants are made solely for secular branches. 
These are arranged in a progressive series of seven grades (standards), 
each intended to occupy a year. Since 1890 teachers have been free to 
classify pupils according to their attainments, so that a pupil may be 
in different grades in different subjects, provided, always, that he passes 
the lower-grade examination in a subject before being advanced to the 
higher. 
Outside of the conditions imposed by the government as before indi- 
cated, which are intended merely to secure an economical administra- 
tion of the public money and to protect the religious scruples of parents, 
jocal managers have the utmost freedom. The boards have very exten- 
sive powers, as they may levy rates for school buildings and current 
expenditures and develop their schools on as liberal a scale as local 
sentiment approves. Teachers are wholly under the control of local 
managers with respect to salary, tenure, etc. 
The grading of schools is necessarily determined in the main by the 
mode of examination, the subjects additional to the obli gatory branches 
forming an important factor in this respect. 
There are either class subjects or specific subjects which may be 
taken by pupils above the fourth grade and for which special grants 
are allowed. The nature and degree of classification on the basis of 
these various provisions depend upon the size of the school, the 
arrangement of the school building, and the number and grade of the 
teachers, The English department places stress upon the separation 
of infants from older pupils, allowing a grant of 9s. per capita if the 
“infants” are taught as a separate department under a competent 
teacher, and ina room specially furnished for the work, as against 7s. 
where these conditions are not fulfilled. As a result of this policy, out 
of an ayerage attendance of 1,121,990 in the infant grade (1890-91), 
917,068 were taught in 6,924 schools, each under a certificated teacher.   
 
-P-A-G-E-165
     EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS OF ENGLAND AND SCOTLAND. 133 
All but 13 of these schools received the higher rate, ¢. ¢., 9s. grant. Out 
of 5,309 classes, 4,224, with an average attendance of 169,996, received 
the 9s. rate, while 1,083, with an average attendance of 34,859, received 
only the 7s. rate. In two cases the grant was refused. 
Infant classes have much less development in Scotland, where the 
recognized school age is 5 and 14, inclusive, as against 3 to 14, inclu- 
sive,in England. The children below 7 years of age, which is regarded 
as the upper limit of age for infants, form only 21 per cent of the enroll- 
ment in Scotland, as against 31 per cent in England. 
It appears from the reports thatin England 91 per cent of the schools 
for older scholars and in Scotland 99 per cent go beyond the bare 
requirements of the obligatory subjects and provide instruction in one 
or more, class subjects, viz., English, geography, history, elementary 
science, special needlework for girls. The grant allowed in England 
for these subjects was estimated on 96 per cent of the total attendance 
of older scholars and in Scotland on 89 per cent of such attendance. 
English is the class subject most generally taken. It is worthy of note 
that after August, 1893, no “school for older scholars” in England will 
be able to claim a grant unless one class subject is taught. The re- 
maining optional subjects,! classed as specific, would be considered 
high-school studies in this country. As they can not be taken by pupils 
below the fifth grade, which on the average it is supposed will be 
reached at 11 years of age, they form in reality an initial stage to 
secondary schools, and in some cities have led to the organization of 
what are called higher board schools. In England 90,087 pupils were 
presented in 1890-91 in one or more of these subjects, of whom nearly 
one-third were from the London schools. The number presented in 
Scotland was 45,386. The grant for these studies is the only portion of 
the government fund still allowed on the results of individual examina- 
tion, all other grants as before stated being estimated at a certain rate 
per capita of average attendance. This policy gives a special motive 
to managers for securing as high an average as possible. 
That it is not sufficient to overcome the various conditions which 
interfere with regular attendance is evident from the fact that in Eng- 
Jand the attendance is only 77.72 per cent of the enrollment (68 per 
cent in infant schools, 82 per cent in schools for older scholars), showing 
but slight increase over former years. In Scotland, where there is a 
uniform compulsory law, but where the severity of the climate and the 
large proportion of sparsely settled regions eS school attendance, 
the average is 79.3 per cent. 
To the day schools, whose operations are here reviewed, must be

domestic economy for girls are included in both England andScotland. In England 
physiology, botany, chemistry, physics, and shorthand are also specified, and addi- 
tional subjects may be taken in either country, provided a graduated scheme of 
instruction is arranged and approved by the department.

added the night schools, which are assuming more and more the char- 
acter of continuation schools. To receive Government aid these schools 
must hold at least forty-five sessions. No pupil who has made less than 
twenty-four attendances can be presented for examination, nor in a 
lower standard than the third.

Among the most important measures pertaining to elementary schools 
now pending are proposed new regulations for evening schools. These 
regulations tend to increase the provision for technical and scientific 
training and to systematize the instruction by means of a graduated 
course arranged for seven years and adapted to young people from 14 
to 21 years of age, within which limits the age of night-school pupils 
will ordinarily fall. Freedom of classification will be secured here, as 
in the day schools, by allowing a pupil to be in different grades in dif- 
ferent subjects.

MOVEMENTS IN SCOTLAND, 
Measures looking to the organization of the agencies for secondary 
instruction and to adequate provision for technical instruction have 
recently assumed great importance throughout the British isles. Scot- 
land has taken the lead in this respect, the inspection of secondary 
schools having been undertaken by the Scotch education department 
in 1886, The number of such schools now under inspection is 55, of 
which 23 are known as higher class public schools (receive appropriations 
from local taxes), 22 are endowed schools, and 10 are private schools 
whose managers have requested the inspection of the department. 
Steady improvement-is noted in the schools whose work has been in- 
spected in successive years. The “leaving certificate examination,” 
which was established in 1888, is found to have a stimulating influence. 
The number of schools participating in this rose from 29 in 1888 to 50 
in 1890, and the number of candidates from 972 to 3,120. Still further 
increase was noted in 1891, when the higher departments of the state- 
aided (elementary) schools were allowed to avail themselves of the 
examination. The number of higher class schools represented in the 
examination rose that year to 52, while the number of departments of _ 
state-aided schools was 63. The number of candidates was 5,500.

        A large number of university and professional authorities have 
announced their readiness to accept the “leaving certificate” in lieu of 
preliminary examinations held under their own direction. 
The series of measures looking to public supervision and support for 
secondary schools is completed by the bill providing for the transfer to 
the Scotch education department of the sum of £60,000 (about $300,000) 
from the local taxation (Scotland) account in aid of the cost of secondary 
education. 
Scotland was also the first division of Great Britain to secure a spe- 
cial law for technical instruction (1887). This law has, however, proved 
to be defective in many respects and additional legislation is confidently 
anticipated.2, Meanwhile the funds which the county councils have 
allowed for technical instruction® have given an impetus to practical 
operations. 
  
1The bill became law June 27, 1892. It provides also for the appropriation of 
£30,000 (in round numbers $150,000) to the universities of Scotland. 
2The new Scotch technical act has been introduced at the present session of Par- 
liament (1892). 
3 Under the local taxation (customs and excise) act, 1890. By this act a surplus 
derived from the duties on liquors was placed at the disposal of the county councils 
with the privilege of applying the same to technical education.

In all an aggregate sum of £39,364 9s. 4d. ($191,311.27) is above 
accounted for, which, deducted from the whole grant paid to Scotland, 
£48,051 ($233,527.86), leaves a balance of £8,686 10s. 8d. ($42,216.59) at 
the disposal of 6 counties and 96 burghs, from which no information has 
been returned.’ : 
The funds appropriated have been applied to the maintenance of 
special teachers of agriculture, dairy work, cookery, etc., in public 
schools, to the instruction of teachers in technical branches, and to the 
fostering of technical and art classes in secondary schools. 
MOVEMENTS IN WALES. 
The Welsh intermediate education act of 1889 is the outcome of 
recommendations made by a committee appointed in 1880 to inquire 
into intermediate and higher education and to make recommendations. 
The act is intended to increase the facilities for both secondary and 
technical instruction, and taken in connection with the elementary 
schools completes for the principality an educational system extending 
from the infant school to the university. 
The new law provides. for an official inspection of secondary schools 
and a government grant in aid of such schools not to exceed in any 
county the amount contributed out of the county rate (or tax) for the 
same purpose. These appropriations with fees and. endowments make 
up the income of the schools. The law also authorizes the governing 
body of a secondary school to borrow money from the public works 
loan commissioners for the erection or enlargement of school buildings. 
Intermediate education as defined by the act “includes instruc- 
tion in reading, writing, and arithmetic, Latin, Greek, the Welsh and 
English languages and literature, modern languages, mathematics, 
natural and applied science, or in sonte such studies, and generally in 
the higher branches of knowledge. ‘Technical education’ includes 
instruction in (1) any of the branches of science and art with respect

to which grants are, for the time being, made by the department of 
science and art; (2) the use of tools and modeling in clay, wood, or 
other material; (3) commercial arithmetic, commercial geography, book- 
keeping, and shorthand; and (4) any other subject applicable to the 
purposes of agriculture, industries, trade, or commerce which may be 
specified in a scheme, or proposals for ‘a scheme, of a joint edueation 
committee, as a form of instruction suited to the needs of the district; 
but it shall not include teaching the practice of any trade or industry 
or employment. In schools established under the provisions of this 
act, no religious catechism or religious formulary which is distinctive 
of any particular denomination may be taught to ascholar attending as 
a day scholar at the school established or regulated by. the scheme, and 
the time for prayer or religious worship or for any lesson or series of 
lessons on a religious subject shall be conveniently arranged for the 
purpose of allowing the withdrawal conveniently of a day scholar there- 
from.” : 
The county councils, created by the local government act of 1888, 
constitute the machinery for the administration of the act for the space 
of three years, after which the duties will devolve upon the charity 
commissioners; but the several educational associations of Wales, 
notably the North Wales Scholarship Association, the Joint Educa- 
tion Committees of Wales and Monmouthshire, and the Association 
for Promoting the Education of Girls in Wales, are actively at work 
to give effect to the law of 1889. Their efforts are directed to raising 
money for scholarship funds for the benefit of pupils in elementary 
schools and to securing the proper distribution and organization of the 
resources for secondary education. The distinct recognition given by 
the act to technical instruction is part of the general impulse which 
this subject has received throughout Great Britain. With respect to 
the present provision for intermediate education in Wales the com- 
mittee of 1880 say in their report: ; 
The number of éndowed schools at present conducted as grammar schools in Wales 
and Monmouthshire is 27, of which 13 are in North Wales, 11 in South Wales, and 
3.in Monmouthshire. There are also a few schools which, though by foundation 
grammar schools, have from deficiency of funds or other causes either fallen into 
abeyance or into the condition of merely elementary schools. 
* * * * * * * 
As nearly as we have been able to estimate, the aggregate endowments of existing 
grammar schools amount to about £12,788 ($62,150), of which North Wales has £4,352 
($21,151), South Wales £4,665 ($22,672), and Monmouthshire £3,771 ($18,327). The 
provision made by the above endowments is at present available for the education 
of boys only. For the education of girls there are but three endowed schools in 
the whole principality, viz: Those at Denbigh and Llandaff, supported out of the 
funds of Howell’s charity, the gross income of which amounts to £6,500 ($31,590), 
and the school at Dolgelly, created by a scheme under the endowed schools acts, and 
maintained with funds provided out of the charity of Dr. Daniel Williams, and 
amounting to about £300 ($1,458) a year.!

  SECONDARY INSTRUCTION IN GREAT BRITAIN. 139 
“MOVEMENTS IN ENGLAND. 
For an understanding of recent movements in England, it is necessary 
‘to have in mind the various conditions under,which secondary and: 
technical instruction are there maintained. In general it may be said 
that secondary instruction is the work of private corporations and 
individuals, although three classes of public bodies haye some respon- 
sibility in the matter. These are (1) the Charity Commissioners for 
England and Wales; (2) local school boards; (3) the Science and Art 
Department. 
No general statistics of secondary schools have been published since 
1868, when the report of the British Schools Inquiry Commission was 
ieee This commission was appointed to investigate the operations 
of the endowed schools of the country, not including the nine great 
public schools. 
The report divides the secondary schools into three classes, endowed, 
proprietary (belonging to a number of stockholders called proprietors), 
and private. To these classes may now be added the higher board 
schools! The commissioners reported in 1868 that 3,000 schools, of 
which a large proportion were elementary, were benefiting by endow- 
ments. Lhe grammar schools coming within the scope of their in- 
quiry numbered 782 and were educating about 37,000 boys. The 9 
public schools had at the same time 2,956 on their registers, or alto- 
gether 40,000 boys in endowed schools, out of an estimated total of 
255,000 requiring secondary education. Theneed of fuller provisions 
for secondary education was emphasized by the commissioners. The 
immediate outcome of their recommendations was the endowed schools 
act of 1869, amended in 1873 and 1874. This law was intended to pro- 
vide “more efficacious means for reforming the statutes of endowed 
schools and the application of their endowments;” for its execution an 
“ endowed schools commission” was created with authority to draft new 
statutes governing the endowments. At the end of three and ahalf years, 
the original limit of its duration, the powers of the commission. were pro- 
longed for a year and then (1874) were transferred to the charity com- 
mission, which becomes thus an organizing authority in the work of 
secondary instruction. The original law applied to many foundations 
for elementary education, but in 1873 these were passed to the jurisdic- 
tion of the Education Department unless .their endowments yielded a 
revenue exceeding £100 per annum. 
From a return relating to schemes? passed before 1880, that is, dur-

? The benefits resulting from the revision of individual endowments may be illus- 
trated by the changes effected in two cases: 
In 1552 a free grammar school was founded at Birmingham by King Edward VI, 
who granted for the purpose certain lands held by the Guild of the Holy Cross. The 
commission of 1868 found the school at a low ebb, numberingonly 115 boys, and with 
buildings in a ruined condition. The foundation has been twice reorganized under 
     
-P-A-G-E-172
  140 : EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
ing the first ten years of the working of the act, it appears that 246 
schools for boys and 40 schools for girls had been dealt with. Between 
1868 and 1883 the number of pupils in schools from which information 
had been received had increased from 13,851 to 27,912. Of this increase 
10,075 pupils were in new schools opened during the period. These 
facts point to advantages arising from a supervisory authority extrane- 
ous to the school. 
The charity commission, in their reports, urge particularly the appli- 
cation of a part of the income from endowments to the creation of schol- 
arships for pupils of the elementary schools. In the absence ef public 
high schools, such as exist in this country, that is indeed the only 
means by which the poor can obtain secondary instruction.! 
  
the new law and now comprises two high schools, one for boys and one for girls, 
and séven affiliated grammar schools, linked on the one hand to elementary schools 
and on the other to the two high schools and to Mason’s College, by a large number 
of scholarships. These schools afford accommodation for 2,315 pupils (1,350 boys, 
965 girls). One-third of the whole number are admitted on foundation scholar- 
ships, one-half of which are given to pupils who have attended public elementary 
schools in Birmingham two years. (See Studies in Secondary Education, Part m1, 
~ Chap. Iv.) 
The famous Christ’s Hospital (Blue Coat Schoola), London, was also founded by 
Edward VI (1553) and has been enriched by numerous gifts and bequests down to the 
present time. The objects of the trust were the relief of the needy and the education 
of poor children. At the date of the report of the schools’ inquiry commission, two 
schools were maintained, i. e. a large boarding school in the heart of London, anda 
preparation school at Hertford. The two schools had at that time about 1,200 boyg 
annually under their charge. The gross income was about £56,000, of which £48,000 
($249,000) were applied to education. As reorganized by the charity commission, the 
revenues will hereafter support five schools, i. e. (1) a boarding school for 700 boys, 
or for 850 when sufficient funds are available; (2) a boarding school for 350 girls in 
separate boarding houses of suitable size; (3) a preparatory school for 120 boys; (4) 
a day school for 600 boys, to be named the science school, which is to include a 
chemical laboratory, and be fitted with workshops and appliances for working in 
wood and metal, situate in the county of Middlesex, at a distance of not more than 3 
miles from the Royal Exchange; and (5) a girls’ day school for 400 scholars. (See 
Rep. of Brit. Schools Inquiry Commission, Vol. 1, Chap. v, also Vol. x, and Par- 
liamentary Paper (79), session 1890.) 
1The following particulars relative to scholarships are cited from “‘ Studies in See- 
ondary Education,” and from city reports: 
“Tn 1882, there were 2,989 scholarships held in secondary schools under schemes 
developed by the commission. Of these, 1,145 were restricted to bona fide pupils of 
elementary schools. There were, at the same time, 250 exhibitions; that is, sums of 
money to carry a boy from a secondary school to one of higher grade, or to a college 
or university. The number of funds of both classes has been increased since the year 
specified. In the cities, especially, these scholarships or endowments are supple- 
mented by donations and by annual subscriptions for the same purpose.” 
“Tn London, there are between 600 and 700 scholarships in secondary schools avail- 
able for boys from elementary schools, and varying in value from the mere remis- 
sion of fees to $100 a year, or more.”   
aCamden, Stillingfleet, Richardson, Coleridge, Charles Lamb, and Leigh Hunt 
were all pupils here. See article in School Guardian, August 2, 1890, p. 575. 
 
-P-A-G-E-173
  SECONDARY INSTRUCTION IN GREAT BRITAIN. 141 
The two classes of secondary schools supported entirely by private 
funds, 7. e., proprietary and private, are conducted in much the same 
manner as are stock-company and private schools in our own country, 
and like these are of varying degrees of excellence. The most notable 
company for the maintenance of schools is the Girls’ Public Day School 
Company, established in London in 1872, and now maintaining about 
thirty-five schools located in the chief cities. A recent estimate gives 
600,000 as the number of pupils under instruction in the private 
schools.? 
The only general agencies affecting these schools are the systems of 
examinations for schools maintained by universities and by the college 
of preceptors, and the science and art department examinations. 
As arule, the endowed schools and private schools are classical, 
although many of them maintain also a science or modern side. The 
higher board-schools, although nominally elementary schools, are really 
doing the work of secondary instruction. They incline chiefly to scien- 
tific studies, a tendency stimulated by the action of the science and art 
departineht, which offers grants for pupils beyond the sixth grade in 
elementary schools who pass specified examinations in science. The 
policy of this department is one of the causes of the close relation be- 
tween secondary and technical instruction that has been madein recent 
discussions and measures. The work of the department will be best 
appreciated after reference to the most important of these measures. 
In 1889 England secured a technical education law® (applicable also 
to Ireland), which is puny, permissive, allowing local authorities to - 
  
“The London school board eee in addition, between 50 and 60 scholarships 
annually, of which a portion are open to girls, also.” 
“The Liverpool council of education offer 12 scholarships annually, aan at 
£20 each, and running for three years, to enable boys in the elementary schools to 
go to the Liverpool College, or to the Liverpool Institute.” 
“The Birmingham school board, as the trustees of certain scholarship endow- 
ments, offer a few minor scholarships of £5 ($25) each towards the maintenance of 
boys who have already obtained foundation scholarships at one of the King Edward’s 
schools, and also scholarships of £15 to £25, running each for four or five years, 
enabling a boy to pass through.” 
1Inaugural address of Rey. Dr: Walker, president-elect for 1893 of the Association 
of Private Schoolmasters. (Educational Times, February, 1893, p. 6.) Amore recent 
estimate by Mr. J. J. Findlay gives 800,000 as the number of pupils in secondary 
schools or pursuing secondary studies, including 25,000 instructed at home or on the 
continent, and excluding the 90,000 pupils of higher board schools. It should be 
observed that the elementary departments of secondary schools are included in the 
above total. (See Educational Times, June 1, 1893, pp. 254-256.)

applied alike to England and Wales and to Scotland, gave a substantial 
basis for the new departure. by authorizing the county councils to em-

In seyenty-eight cases wholly to technical education (including 
science and art); in twenty-seven cases, partly to those purposes; 
in four cases wholly in aid of rates (local taxes). 
Fifteen Welsh counties and county boroughs, and Monmouth, decided 
to apply their shares of the duties in the following manner: 
In twelve cases wholly to intermediate education, or intermediate

and technical education; in one case partly to intermediate eftucation; 
in one ease partly to technical education.

  WORK OF THE SCIENCE AND ART DEPARTMENT. 
Reference has already been made to the grants allowed by the science 
and art department. They comprise: 
(a) Grants for children of the industrial classes, who take science or - 
drawing at school and pass the science and art examination. 
(6) Grants to students who have passed the stage of elementary 
instruction, and who study in special science and art schools under 
inspection by the department. 
(ce) Grants of scholarships and prizes to enable promising students to 
proceed with their studies. 
(d) Grants for apparatus, laboratories, and museums, cte. : 
(e) Maintenance at London of training schools for teachers, i. e., the 
Normal School of Science and the National Art Training School. 
With the exception of grants for drawing and manual training, the 
work thus fostered lies beyond the elementary school grade, and is 
properly classified either as secondary or technical. Drawing hasbeen 
made obligatory for boys in public elementary schools, a recognition of

its universal importance for the industrial classes. Manual training © 
was added to the subjects encouraged by the science and art department, ~ 
in 1890, a few school boards having already made experiments in that 
braneh.! 
The extentand growth of the operations of the science and art depart- 
ment outside of the art work in elementary schools are indicated by the

The decrease in the number of schools since 1839 is due to the elos- 
ing of merely ephemeral institutions. 5, 
Of the schools examined in 1891, 1,614 were in England and Wales, 32£ in Scot- 
land, and 226in Ireland. The number of students who came up for examination 
from them was 90,812, an increase of 7,742 0n the previous year. Besides these, 
2,847 self-taught students and pupils fon classes not entitled to claim payments on - 
results presented themselves for examination. The number of examination papers 
worked by the 93,659 students who were examined was 179,549, or an average of

and has attended with reasonable regularity. The grant may be reduced or wholly 
withheld at the discretion of the department-if it appears that the plant is insuffi- 
cient or that the instruction is not good. (Official circular, 1890.) 
From the official report it appears that “during the year ending August 31, 1391, 
6,212 clementary schools with 1,170,340 scholars were taught drawing and examined 
under the regulations of the department. Seven hundred and thirty-nine of these 
schools were in Scotland and 51in Ireland. This was an increase of 1,886 schools 
and 241,983 scholars, or 44 per cent and 26 per cent, respectively, as compared with 
the numbers in 1889-90, when 4,324 schools, with 928,357 scholars, were exam ined.” 
Classes of manual instruction have been established in 245 schools, 63 of which 
were examined in the year ended August 31, 1891, and earned grants amounting to * 
£600 13s, 4d. on account of 2,568 schools,

very nearly two papers per student. Seventy-two thousand four hundred and sixty- 
three students were successful in passing in one or more subjects, and of these 37,333 
were successful for the first time. In the previous year 71,417 were successful, and 
87,614 for the first time. 
The Royal College of Science, London, with which is incorporated the Royal 
School of Mines, numbered 285 students; of these 121 were Government students, 
royal exhibitioners, national scholars, local exhibitioners,free students, and teachers 
in training, and 164 were private students paying fees. 
At the Royal College of Science, Dublin, there were 116 students, as 
against 103 in the previous year. 
Art instruction in local schools of art and art classes.—The number of art schools 
and classes examined in 1891 was 1,313, as against 1,182 in 1890, showing an increase 
of 131. The number of students under instruction was 88,833 in 1890, as compared 
with 100,031 in 1891. 
The National Art Training School registered 191 students, Alto- 
gether there were 249,031 students pursuing art and science studies 
under the auspices of the department. 
Expenditure.—The expenditure of the department during the financial year 1891-92 
amounted to £530,607 ($2,578,751), which was apportioned as follows: Expenses of 
administration, including central staff, office expenses, etc., £33,034; direct pay- 
ments, prizes, etc., to encourage instruction in science, £113,434; direct payments, 
prizes, etc., to encourage instruction in art, £52,120; services common to both 
science and art instruction, £61,034; institutions supported or aided by the state 
through the Depa:tment of Science and Art, £58,000; the South Kensington and 
Bethnal Green Museums, including the expenses of circulation of science and art 
objects to country institutions, £85,940; payments for instruction in public elemen- 
tary schools and training colleges in drawing, £123,167, and grants in aid of technical 
instruction and local museums, £3,878. 
It will be seen that the entire expenditure of the department is less 
than the annual amount at the disposal of the county councils ($3,590,000), 
and in view of these new resources the department announces the with- 
drawal after May, 1892, of grants for the second (i. e., lowest) class in 
the elementary stage of each science subject, of grants in aid of tech- 
nical subjects, and also of grants for apparatus and fittings during the 
continuance of the customs and excise act, excepting in Ireland, 
which has no share in this fund. At the same time the department 
will increase its appropriations for advanced science instruction. 
The sum at the disposal of the county councils may be regarded as 
a fund for the development of secondary education, as by the law of 
1889 the councils are debarred from making direct appropriation for 
instruction given to boys and girls in the elementary grades. 
Taking advantage of this fact, the National Association for the Pro- 
motion of Technical and Secondary Education urges— 
That in the opinion of this association the powers conferred on local authorities by 
the technical instruction acts, 1889 and 1891, and the local taxation (customs and 
-excise duties) act, 1890, ought to be so extended by legislation as to enable them to 
deal effectively with the organization of secondary education,
-P-A-G-E-177
  SECONDARY INSTRUCTION IN GREAT BRITAIN. 145 
In pursuance of that opinion, a secondary education bill will un- 
doubtedly be introduced at the next session of Parliament.! 
It was not the purpose of this chapter to consider curricula and the 
internal conduct of secondary schools. As, however, this grade of 
instruction is just now a subject of much discussion among us, the work 
of individual schools in England would presumably furnish interesting 
suggestions. For this reason extracts from the prospectuses of three 
typical schools, showing admission requirements and courses of study are 
appended to this article. : 
CITATIONS FROM PROSPECTUSES OF ENGLISH SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
HARROW, ONE OF THE NINE GREAT PUBLIC SCHOOLS—ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS 
AND CURRICULUM. 
No boy can be admitted into the school before completing his twelfth, nor (except 
under certain conditions) after completing his fourteenth year, nor (in any case) with- 
out a certificate of good conduct from the master or tutor under whom he has been 
previously educated. 
Every boy, before his admission to the school, is required to pass an entrance 
examination. 
For the classical side the obligatory subjects are easy translation from Xenophon, 
Czesar, Ovid, or for more advanced boys from Homer, Euripides, Virgil, Cicero, and 
Greek and Latin grammar. 
A simple paper is also given to test a boy’s general knowledge of English subjects, 
e., Scripture, English grammar, and the elements of geography and English his- 
tory (but a boy is not required to do all the parts of the paper), arithmetic through 
fractions and interest. 
French, algebra, geometry, natural science may be taken, and knowledge of these 
is reckoned in the candidate’s favor. 
For admission to the modern side the principal subjects are mathematics, Latin, 
and French; a boy is required to pass in all three. Any knowledge of German or 
history is taken into consideration in determining a boy’s place. The mathematical 
part of the examination comprises arithmetic, algebra, so far as to include quadratie 
equations, and the earlier parts of Euclid or some other elementary geometry. 
No boy can remain in the school (without special permission) after he is 16, unless 
he has reached the shell; after 17, unless he has reached the sixth form, or in any 
(ordinary) case after 19. 
The following scheme shows the distribution of subjects and hours each week for 
two forms in each division. In the classical side the forms selected are the high- 
est (i. ¢., upper sixth) and the third (i. e.,1v,1); between the two there are nine forms. 
On the modern side the forms selected are the highest (i. e., modern sixth) and the 
second (modern Ivy, I). Between these there are seven forms. 
  
1 The bill has just been introduced by Mr. Arthur Acland, June 1, 1892.

    14g 3 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
The City of London School was established by the corporation of London, under 
the authority of an act of Parliament procured by them for the purpose in the year 
1834, and was erected at their expense on the site of ground formeriy occupied by 
Honey-lane Market, Cheapside, and removed thence to the Victoria Embankment in 
1883. It is endowed with an annual sum toward its maintenance, derived from 
certain estates left in 1442 by John Carpenter, town clerk of the city, and is under 
the government of the corporation and a committee chosen by them. 
.The object of the school is to furnish a liberal and useful education for the sons 
of respectable persons who are engaged in professional, commercial, or trading pur- 
suits, without the necessity of removing them from the care and control of their 
parents. Boys are admissible at any age between 7 and 15 years, and may remain 
until 19. The minimum qualification for admission is a knowledge of the first four 
rules of arithmetic, and ability to read and write. The mode of admission is by an 
application according to a form obtained of the secretary, which is required to be 
signed by the parent or guardian, and also by some member of the corporation, 
either alderman or common councilman. . The charge for each pupil is £12 128. a 
year, payable £4 4s. each term in advance up to the age of 12, and after that age 
£15 15s. a year, payable £5 5s. each term in advance. Printed books and drawing 
materials are furnished as required, and are charged for at reduced prices in each 
term account. A charge of 2s. 6d. a term, payable not to the secretary but to the 
class master, entitles the subscriber to the use of the bats, balls, etc., in the play 
ground, as well as to a copy of each number of the School Magazine, besides con- 
stituting him a member of the various school clubs. This subscription, though not 
compulsory, has the sanction and approval of the governing body of the school, and 
is strongly recommended by the head master. 
The course of instruction includes the English, Latin, Greek, French, German, 
Spanish, and Italian languages; mathematics, arithmetic, writing, book-keeping, 
geography, history, shorthand, chemistry and natural philosophy, elocution, 
vocal music, drilling, and gymnastics. The school is divided into two sections, 
the senior and the junior. The senior section is divided into classical and modern 
language sides. Before boys leave the junior section their parents are consulted as 
to the side in the senior section on which they are to be placed. On the classical 
side boys are prepared for the universities, the London University matriculation 
examination, and the learned professions. Boys on the modern side are taught sub- 
jects specially suitable as a preparation for mercantile pursuits. Facilities are 
given to boys who wish to pass the examinations of the civil-service commission, 
and of the Pharmaceutical Society, the preliminary law and medical examinations, 
and the examinations for commercial certificates. 
In addition to the ordinary classical and modern sides there is a natural science 
division, into which boys may be admitted who have attained a certain standard in 
literary and mathematical education. 
The curriculum of the natural science division includes the following subjects: 
(1) Divinity, 1 hour per week. 
(2) English and French, 4 hours per week.- 
(3) Arithmetic and mathematics, 6 hours per week. 
(4) Chemistry, 6 hours per week. 
(5) Physics, 6 hours per week. 
Provision is made for boys whose parents wish them to continue, as far as may be 
consistent with their main studies, German, Latin, or Greek. The object of this 
division is to meet the needs— 
(1) Of boys for whom their parents desire a training in natural science in prefer- 
ence to a training in languages, either classical or modern. .   
-P-A-G-E-181
  SECONDARY INSTRUCTION IN GREAT BRITAIN. 149 
(2) Of boys who are intended for engineering pursuits. 
(3) Of boys who have passed the London University matriculation examination, 
and desire to pass the preliminary scientific examination, or the first B.Sc. 
(4) Of boys who aim at science scholarships at Oxford or Cambridge. 
The school is provided with a carpenter’s shop, for admission to which there is 
no extra charge; but boys pay for their tools, full sets of which may be obtained 
through the school. 
Drawing is the only extra. The fee for drawing is 7s. a term, if a boy attends 
the drawing classes on Wednesdays only or on Saturdays only; 14s. a term if he 
attends on both days. The Scriptures are read and tanght in the school, and the 
business of cach day commences and terminates with prayer. 
The hours of attendance are from 9 to a quarter past 3, allowing an interval of 
three-quarters of an hour, from 12 to 12:45, for refreshment. Pupils can be accom- 
modated either with dinner at 1s. a head, or with a cold luncheon at 6d. a head, at 
a table provided by the caterer. Parents are advised to purchase dinner or lunch- 
eon tickets, which are supplied by the caterer in books. There are optional classes 
on Wednesday afternoons and on Saturday mornings, and on whole school days 
from 3:15 to 4:15, when additional insfruction (without extra fee) is given in some 
of the ordinary subjects of school work and in a few subjects not taught during 
the regular school hours. 
A vacation of six weeks is allowed in the summer, three weeks at Christmas, and 
three weeks at Easter; the other holidays, besides Saturdays and the afternoons of 
Wednesdays, are Easter Monday, Whit Monday, and Lord Mayor’s Day. 
The school year is divided into three terms, the first extending from about the * 
middle of January to the middle of April, the second from the beginning of May to 
the latter end of July, the third from the second Tuesday in September to Christ- 
mas, 
THE EDUCATIONAL COURSE OF CLIFTON COLLEGE (A PROPRIETARY SCHOOL). 
The school consists of the following parts: 
(1) The upper school, for boys between 13 and 19, which is divided iuto three de- 
partments—the classical side, the modern side, and the military side. 
(2) The junior school, for boys between 10 and 14, which prepares for the three 
departments of the college. , 
(8) The preparatory school, for boys between 7 and 11, which prepares for the 
junior school. 
The numbers of each part of the school are limited—the upper school to 460, the 
junior school to 140, the preparatory school to’ 45. 
Preparatory school.—In the preparatory school boys receive a thorough grounding 
in English subjects, French, Latin, and arithmetic. Their play is systematic, and is 
superintended by the masters. Their schoolrooms are in a separate building, at some 
distance from the college. 
Junior school.—The junior school have separate buildings within the college pre- 
cincts, and a separate part of the playground. Their hours are so arranged that 
they can not have communication with the older boys. They all learn English sub- 
jects, French, Latin, and mathematics. In the third forms Greek is taught to those 
who are being prepared for the classical side of the college, while boys intended for 
the modern and military sides learn extra French and mathematics. The games are 
carefully organized, as well for town boys as for boarders, and are superintended by 
masters, 
Upper school.—On entering the upper school a boy has to choose between the clas- 
sical and the modern side. (Boys intended for the military side remain on the mod- 
ern side until they reach the upper fourth form.) A boy who is intended for the 
university or the Indian civil service should join the classical side, unless he is to 
 
-P-A-G-E-182
  150 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-1, 
specialize in mathematics or science. Those who are intended for business generally 
join the modern side. Where the profession is not yet decided it is generally better 
to join the classical side. . 
Every boy is placed in a “form.” On the classical side the form work comprises 
Scripture, Latin, Greek, history, geography, and English literature, and occupieg 
about twenty hours in school each week, besides preparation. Onthe modern side the 
form work comprises the same subjects, with the exception of Greek, and occupies 
about ten hours in school. The rest of the work, on both sides alike, is done in 
“sets,” i. e., groups of boys chosen from different “forms” according to their capac- 
ity in each special subject. The mathematical sets throughont the school, and the 
German and science sets in the upper half, are common to the two sides of the school. 
The separate work of the two sides is as follows: 
Classical side.—In the third and fourth forms, all boys learn French and science in 
sets. In the fifth forms, French is a voluntary subject, and each boy has to choose 
between German and science. The form work becomes somewhat elastic, so that 
boys are able, to some extent, to cultivate special tastes, especially a taste for his- 
tory. 
Modern side.—In the third forms all boys learn’French, drawing, and natural 
science in sets. In the fourth forms drawing ceases to be compulsory, and German 
is begun, while French and science are carried further. From the upper fourth a 
large number of boys pass into the military side. Those who are not intended for 
the army pass up into the modern fifth forms, where considerable facilities are given 
for special work. In those forms all boys do English, Scripture, history, French, and 
« drawing, and they may choose any two of the three subjects, Latin, German, and 
science. Those who are strong in mathematics, science, or modern languages are 
able to devote a large amount of time to any one of the three. Those who are.going 
to the universities now join a special Greek class, in which they learn the small 
amount of that language which is required in order to pass at Cambridge. 
Sixth form.—Boys are promoted from both classical and modern upper fifths into 
the sixth form. The whole form attend the head master’s lessons in Scripture and 
English; but for other subjects they are divided into two main branches. In one 
of these are placed all boys whose special subject is classics; but they continue to 
give four hours a week to mathematics and four to either German or science until 
their Jast year. The other division comprises all those, whether promoted from the 
classical or the modern fifth, who are to devote themselves mainly to history, science, 
mathematics, or modern languages. These do a moderate amount of Greek and 
Latin as a form, doing their special work in sets. 
The military side is open only to boys who reach the upper fourth form before 
they are 16, and are able to reach a certain standard in mathematics. The work of 
this side is carefully regulated to enable boys to pass direct from the school into 
Woolwich, Sandhurst, or Cooper’s Hill (Indian Woods and Forests), As a rule, only 
boys preparing for those three examinations are admitted to the military side; but 
occasionally boys are allowed to ee it who are intended for the profession of civil 
engineering.

EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM OF IRELAND.! 
MATERIAL CON! p.—Reports of the Commissioners of National Education in Ireland,

    Ireland: area, 32,583 square miles; population (census of 1891), 4,704,750. 
The principles controlling the policy of the British Government with 
respect to popular education, already referred to, i. ¢., the sense of 
public responsibility in this matter and immemorial regard for local 
prerogative and private rights, have been displayed ina striking man- 
ner in the system of national education maintained in Ireland since 
_ 1831. The growth of the system has been phenomenal; the schools 
which in 1834-35 numbered 1,106, with an enroliment of 145,521, or1.8 
per cent of the population, having increased to 8,298 in 1890, with an 
average enrollment of 828,520 pupils, 17.6 per cent of the population. 
The ratio of average daily attendance to the population at the later 
date was 10 per cent, or more than five times the ratio of enrollment to 
population in 1835. The annual expenditure which in 1883 was esti- 
mated at £47,224 ($229,509), and which it was supposed would ulti- 
- mately reach a fixed sum of £200,000 (about $1,000,000), was actually 
in 1890 £973,062 ($4,729,082). 
CONTROL AND SUPERVISION. 
The Board of Commissioners.—The administration of the system is 
confided to a National Board of Commissioners appointed by the lord

lieutenant of Ireland. The managers of schools, who are generally 
clergymen, come into immediate relation with this board. There are 
no elected school boards, as in England and Scotland, nor do local civil 
authorities appear in the matter at all. 
Several details pertaining to the internal conduct of schools, which, 
in Great Britain, are left to local managers, are in Ireland entrusted to 
the board of commissioners (é. ¢., the representatives of the Government). 
This policy grew out of the religious question which presented the 
greatest obstacle to the development of a national system of education 
in Ireland. At the time of the organization of the system it was nec- 
essary to allay the jealousies which had been excited by previous 
attempts to force Protestant schools upon a population ovewhelmingly 
Catholic. To this end a formal declaration was made on the part of 
the Government that its purpose was ‘to superintend a system of edu- 
cation from which should be banished even the suspicion of proselytism, 
and which, admitting children of all religious persuasions, should not 
interfere with the peculiar tenets of any.! 
The sincerity of the Government with respect to this purpose was 
evidenced in the constitution of the board, which comprised eminent 
representatives of both Catholic and Protestant churches, and in plac- 
ing wider their control all matters affecting the subject of religious 
instruction. They were directed to separate literary and moral from 
religious instruction and to remit the latter subject to the clergy. All 
efforts to compel or to persuade the attendance of any child upon these 
exercises against the wishes of parents and guardians were strictly 
forbidden. The time allotted to secular instruction and the text books 
to be used either in secular or religious instruction were to be deter- 
mined by the commissioners. They were also authorized to suspend 
or remove teachers and to fix the amount of their minimum salaries.’ _ 
These provisions were not intended to interfere with the control of 
teachers by local managers, but simply as a means of guarding against 
the retention of teachers who should violate the rules of the board or 
who should be found incompetent, and to free them in some measure 
from dependence upon local managers. The number of commissioners, 
which began at seven, has increased to keep pace with the development 
of the system.. By the charter of 1861 the board is incorporated with 
20 members (10 Protestant and 10 Catholic); 17 were serving in 1890. 
The only paid member of the board is the resident commissioner, who 
is the virtual head of the system. Dublin is the official center. 
The service of inspection.—For purposes of Government supervision

the country is divided into sixty districts, which are grouped in six 
divisions, each in charge of a head inspector. Under these are 29 dis- 
trict inspectors, 7 unassigned inspectors, and 10 inspectors’ assistants. 
Inspectors and their assistants are appointed upon examination test- 
ing their scholastic and professional qualifications. Their salaries are 
graded in an ascending scale, which acts as a stimulus and reward for 
efficiency. The district inspectors are divided into two classes, of which 
the second begins at a salary of £275, which is increased to £305 by 
the addition of £10 biennially until the maximum is attained. The first 
class begins at £320 and increases to £370 by annual additions of £10. 
An allowance for traveling expenses is made to all inspectors. The 
duties of each class of inspectors are carefully defined. Head inspect- 
ors preside over and assist at the examination of teachers, determine 
their classification in conference with the district inspectors, conduct the 
examinations at the district model schools,! examine each year a sufii- 
cient number of the ordinary schools in their respective districts, con- 
duct special inquiries ordered by the board, exercise a constant super- 
vision over the district inspectors, and transmit an annual report to 
the board of commissioners. The district inspectors come into the 
most intimate relations with the schools. They are required to spend 
from four to five hours at least each day, exclusive of the time occupied 
in going toand returning from the schools, in the actual work of inspec- 
tion. Every school must be visited at least once in each week of the 
three terms into which the school year is divided. These visits are 
made without announcement. The inspection must include details 
of organization and instruction, condition of buildings, school regis- 
ters, ete. 
Once each year a public examination must be held in each school, 
notice of which may be given beforehand. The district inspectors sub- 
mit annual and term reports to the head inspectors, employing for this 
purpose official forms which secure uniformity.” 
Local control.—The authority of the local managers is extensive and 
in most districts is reposed in one nan, the priest, Presbyterian minis- 
ter, or other clergyman, as the case may be. He appoints and dis- 
misses the teachers, arranges the daily time-table of the school, and 
determines the character of the religious instruction. A report of Jan- 
uary 31, 1891, shows that 48 per cent of school managers at that date 
were Roman Catholic clergymen; 30.5 per cent clergymen of the Epis- 
eopal church; 18.1 per cent Presbyterian ministers; 2.2 per cent Metho- 
dist ministers. 
THE SCHOOLS. 
How established.—Local managers must take the initiative in estab- 
lishing ordinary national schools, providing the buildings and a por- 
1See p. 154. 2 Official instructions, %See Lord Stanley’s letter.

tion of the fund for current expenditures.'| The schools placed under 
the supervision of the commissioners were from the first called national 
schools, and it was ordered that this inscription should be put up°con- 
spicuously on the schoolhouses. 2 
Classes of schools.—In 1840 the Presbyterian Synod of Ulster, which 
had previously opposed the national system, came into harmonious 
relations with the board, and vested and nonvested school’ were 
thenceforth recognized. The former, to the building of which the 
state contributes, are yestedin trustees for the purposes of national 
education.” The clergy of all denominations represented in vested 
schools have the right of going to the same and giving religious in- 
struction under certain conditions and provisions.’ 
The nonyested schools receive aid only by way of salary and books, 
and the managers are not required to permit access to the clergy. The 
report of the board for 1890 showed 3,139 vested schools and 5,545 
nonyested. 
The commissioners have also direct control of a special class of 
schools called “model schools,” for which they provide the buildings. 
These schools, which were contemplated in the earliest plans of the 
board, are intended, as their name indicates, to afford models of the 
best methods of instruction and organization and to serve as practice 
schools for students in training colleges, i. ¢., normal schools. 
It was proposed to establish one such school in each of the districts 
into which Ireland is divided for purposes of school inspection. In 
1890 model schools were in operation in 26 out of 56 provincial dis- 
tricts, making, with 3 in Dublin, a total of 29. These schools resem- 
ble the graded schools of our own country, having in their complete 
stage a kindergarten department and separate departments for each 
of the six grades included in the scheme of study for national schools. 
In the number reported in 1890 there were comprised 84 separate 
departments. The enrollment was 9,567 pupils. 
Convent and monastery schools are included also among those in 
1The commissioners were directed to refuse all applications for aid in which the 
following objects were not locally provided for: (1) A fund sufficient for the annual 
repairs of the schoolhouse and furniture; (2) a permanent salary for the master not 
less than — pounds; (3) a sum sufficient to purchase books and school requisites at 
half price, and books of separate religious instruction at prime cost; (4) where aid 
is required from the commissioners for building a schoolhouse it is required that at 
least one-third of the estimated expense be subscribed, a site for building, to be 
approved of by the commissioners, be granted tu them, and the schoolhouse when 
finished to be vested in them. (Lord Stanley’s letter, p. 4.) 
2The commissioners of national education award aid (a) towards the payment of 
the teachers and supply of books and other schoo] requisites, (b) towards building 
schoolhouses and providing suitable fittings and furniture (this aid is given to 
vested schools only)., (c) towards providing residences for teachers of national 
schools. See rules 247 to 249 (Rules and Regulations, 1887, p. 1).

relation with the board, the number of these in 1890 being 301, with 
an average attendance of 65,548 pupils. Naturally, the convent schools 
formed the great majority, 7. ¢, 267, with an average attendance of 
60,885 pupils. 
The year after the Irish poor-law came into operation (1840) the com- 
missioners first note in their report the opening of workhouse schools 
and their coming under the supervision of the board. The number of 
this class of schools under the commissioners has steadily increased, 
being 158 in 1890, with 9,430 pupils. These, with 52 evening schools 
having an average nightly attendance of 1,747 pupils, complete thelist 
of elementary schools under the commissioners. 
Statisties, 1890.—To summarize, it appears that the number of schools 
borne on the commissioners’ list December 31, 1890, was 8,298, an in- 
erease of 20 per cent since 1871. Returns from 8,262 of these schools 
show a total enrollment of 1,037,102, with an average enrollment of 
828,520. Upon this number an average daily attendance of 489,144, 
or 59 per cent, was maintained. The classification of pupils by religious 
denomination is important as showing the progress of the system in 
overcoming sectarian opposition. Every teacher is accordingly expected 
to enter upon his register the church relation of each child. Of the 
schools whose returns were summarized, 3,866 were mixed schools, i. e., 
attended by both Protestant and Roman Catholic pupils, and 4,394 
were separate schools, 7. e., attended by Roman Catholic or by Pro- 
testant pupils exclusively. 
Further analysis yields the following particulars:

Of the pupils in separate or unmixed schools, 468,222 were Roman 
Catholic and under teachers of that sect, and 100,733 Protestant under 
Protestant teachers. Two schools could not be classified under these 
heads. ‘The percentage of schools exhibiting a mixed attendance de- 
clines steadily from year to year, having fallen from 55.1 in 1881 to 46.7 
in 1890. 
Sources of income for national schools—The Government grant has 
heretofore furnished about 744 per cent of the annual income of the 
national schools. The balance has been derived from subscriptions 
and endowments, and, in poor-law unions,’ contributions from the rates, 
1 Parishes and combinations of parishes, é.¢., unions, are districts for the adminis- 
tration of the poor law. In these, contributions from the rates for school purposes 
are made in behalf of the children of paupers. 
   
-P-A-G-E-188
  156 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
Tn addition to these sources since 1890, a sum has been annually re- 
ceived from the surplus derived from the tax on beer and spirituous 
liquors (customs and excise act). The Irish educational bill now be- 
fore Parliament provides for an annual appropriation in lieu of school 
fees for schools whose managers accept the conditions: This bill fol- 
lows the precedent already established in Scotland and England, and 
will in all probability become a law.! 
The total income of the national schools for 1890-91 from all sources 
was £993,022 15s. ($4,826,090), derived as follows: 
Government.—Annual grant, £738,467 5s, ($3,588,951); tax on spirits, 
£57,705 8s. ($28,049). 
Local sources.—Tuition fees (school pence paid by pupils), £102,478 
7s. ($498,045); rates in contributory unions, £24,559 16s. ($119,361); 
subscriptions, endowments, ete., £69,811 16s. ($339,286). The rate per 
pupil in average attendance upon the whole amount was $9.86, 
Of the above sum, £35,907 84s. were for buildings and repairs, leaving 
for the income of the teaching staff £957,115 64s. ($4,651,582), or $9.50 
per pupil in average attendance. From the above statistics it will be 
seen that the managers of the schools, who have a power over them 
more absolute than that intrusted to private persons in any other sys- 
tem of public education in the world, are responsible for only about 
one-fifth of the entire income.   
TEACHERS. 
On the 31st of December 1890, the commissioners had in their serv- 
ice 7,999 principal teachers and 3,120 assistants, or a total of 11,119 
(5,498 men and 5,621 women) classified teachers. Of these, 4,159 had 
received professional training. There were also at the same date 663 
work mistresses and industrial teachers, 150 assistants, and 5,668 paid 
monitors or pupil teachers, and 152 receiving support and tuition in 
model schools. TheSe numbers do not include the conductors of 242 
convent and 3 monastery schools. 
Classification, appointment, and salaries.—Teachers are divided into 
three classes, viz, third, second, and first. Each class is again sub- 
divided into two grades or divisions, viz, second division and first 
division. Persons eligible for appointment either as principals or assist- 
ants in national schools are (1) those who have been trained in 
approved training colleges; (2) persons already recognized as classi- 
1 The bill was passed June, 1892, and will go into operation in the fall. The meas- 
ure, which was at first weleomed by the Irish members of all sections, was event- 
ually opposed on account of the compulsory clause, and also because the schools of 
the Christian Brothers were excluded from its benefits. Finally, upon the repre- 
sentation of a member that the Brothers’ schools would submit to a ‘conscience 
clause” protecting children from sectarian teaching, provision was made for extend- 
ing the bill to these schools. The opposition then ceased and the measure was 
passed. The fund for giving effect to this act is estimated at about £200,000 
($972,000).
-P-A-G-E-189

fied national teachers; (3) persons who after a five years’ course as 
monitors have obtained satisfactory certificates. No person can secure 
a position under the board without.a medical certificate showing sound 
health. The minimum age for appointment is 18 years and the maxi- 
mum 35 years. Clergymen are not recognized as teachers by the 
board. All teachers are obliged to present themselves at the annual 
examinations which are held in their respective districts each year in 
the month of July. Teachers failing in this obligation can not con- 
tinue to draw their salaries. Salaries are graded by class. The classi- 
fication and average salaries of principal teachers in 1890 were as 
follows: 
  
Salaries. 
Classes.     
Men. | ‘Women.   
-| $750.75 | $579.00 
528. 00 448.75 
436.25 | 368.75 
346.00 299, 25 
      
General average: Men, $442.25; women, $373.75. 
The average salary for assistant teachers the same year was, for men, 
$267.25; for women, $216. 
The salaries are composed in part of a fixed amount allowed by the 
commissioners to each class of teachers, and generally equal to one-half 
the whole salary. An additional sum is allowed by the board, deter- 
mined in each case by the results of examinations and the amount of 
local contributions. Teachers of model schools are provided with full 
residence, as are also about one-tenth of the teachers of the ordinary - 
national schools. The teachers of convent schools are allowed their 
choice between the fixed salaries and a grant (rated at 12s. or 10s.) per 
capita of average attendance. As they receive no money from local 
sources, their incomes are much less than those of the teachers in the 
national schools—a discrimination which has long been a cause of dis- 
turbance. At thebest, the Irish teacher is not so well paid as the English 
teacher, owing, however, entirely to the meager contributions from local 
sources. The matter is constantly urged upon the attention of Parlia- 
ment by Irish members. - 
Of the total income of the teaching staff for the year ending March 
31, 1891, 76.3 per cent was derived from the Government. Since 1879 
the Irish teachers have had the benefit of a pension fund, which is 
distributed upon a varying scale, the maximum number of teachers 
who may be borne upon the pension roll being 10,700. 
Duties—The duties of teachers in national schools are minutely 
detailed in official instructions, copies of which must be kept in the 
school room. Special stress is placed upon the keeping of registers, 
report books, and class rolls. 
It would appear that Irish teachers are subject to all the evils arising
-P-A-G-E-190
  158 EDUCATION REPORT, 1990-91. 
from dual control. They depend directly upon local managers for their 
appointment, tenure, and extra compensation. At the same time, the 
mnajor portion of their salaries and all claims thereto depend upon their 
fulfilling the requirements of the board. The situation explains their 
general discontent. Itmust be stated, however, that the high efficiency 
of the great body of the teachers is beyond question. 
TRAINING COLLEGES. 
Control and support.—The necessity of special training for teachers 
was recognized at the very beginning of the commissioners’ adminis- 
tration, and a normal school or training eollege was established by them 
for this purpose at Dublin (Marlborough Street Training College) and 
opened for students in 1838. Only young women were admitted at first, 
but a department for men was added in 1842, The model schools which 
had been previously established at Dublin became practice schools for 
the college. In addition to the Marlborough Street Training College, 
which is under the direct control of the commissioners, three denomi- 
national colleges have been established, viz, the Church of Ireland 
Training College for both sexes and two Roman Catholic training col- 
leges, St. Patrick’s (Drumcondra) for men, and Our Lady of Mercy 
Training College (Dublin) for Women. These are under inspection and 
share in the government grant. 
All of the colleges have boarding departments; students who obtain 
Queen’s scholarships are provided with free board and tuition. 
Prior to 1890 the government grant furnished the entire support of 
the official college, while the denominational colleges received only a 
portion of their support from this source. Dissatisfaction with this 
inequality led to a change of basis in the year specified. Under pres- 
ent arrangements the government allows fixed grants, as follows: (a) 
In all the colleges (Marlborough Street included) £50 a year for men 
students and £35 a year for women; (b) in addition, a diploma bonus 
of £10 for men and £7 for women for each year of training, on the 
award of the diploma for training, after a probationary service of two 
years in the actual work of teaching. If the new grants yield a sur- 
plus upon the certified expenditure, such surplus may be applied to 
scholarships, prizes, the purchase of apparatus and educational appli- 
ances, or any other suitable purposes approved by the commissioners 
of national education. (Report 1890, pp. 24, 25). 
The pupils in respect to whom these grants are made must pass suc- 
cessfully the inspectors’ examinations, which are held annually at the 
respective schools. The examinations for women differ somewhat from 
those for men, the requirements in mathematics and science being less, 
and needlework, cutting garments, and kindergarten exercises being 
added. 
Statistics—The number of pupils in training m 1890 was 514, of 
whom 363 completed their course during the year. Of these, 172 had 
 
-P-A-G-E-191
  EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM OF IRELAND. *159 
entered for a one-year’s course and 191 for. the complete course of two 
years. The total grant to the colleges for the year was £159,146 7s, 
($676,251), , 
Training of pupil teachers—The regulations as to the training of 
pupil teachers by their respective head teachers are very explicit. 
Pupil teachers employed in the model schools really receive a superior 
order of professional training. 
Training by organizing teachers.—The commissioners appoint certain 
teachers, whose office it is to undertake the organization of large and 
important schools and to prepare the teaching staff of such schools for 
the better discharge of their duties. From the detailed instructions 
issued for the staff of organizers, it appears that their work is similar 
to that carried on in our own teachers’ institutes. They give lectures 
upon school organization, methods of instruction, discipline, school 
sanitation, etc. As they are located at schools actually in progress, 
they are able to supplement their lectures by practical applications and 
by criticisms of the work of the ordinary teachers. Thus they may be 
said to combine institute instruction with the exercises of practice 
schools. No recent report upon this feature of the system is at hand. 
WORK OF SCHOOLS. 
Course of study.—The course of study in the lrish schools, as in those 
of England and Scotland, comprises obligatory and optional branches. 
The former, which are arranged in a graded course covering six years 
or classes, include reading, spelling, writing, and arithmetic in all 
classes; grammar, geography in classes II-VI; bookkeeping, classes 
V-VI; needlework for girls, classes H-VI; and agriculture for boys, 
classes IV-VI. Vocal music and drawing are optional class subjects. 
Other optional branches which may be taken by pupils in different 
classes are kindergarden exercises in the infant, or first, class; geom- 
etry, algebra, mensuration, trigonometry, handicraft (for boys); sewing 
machine, domestic economy, cookery, dairying, management of poultry 
(for girls), and hygiene; also the physical sciences, navigation, classics, 
French, German, Irish, and even instrumental music. 
Examinations.—A portion of the Government grant is allowed upon 
a scale of payments graded for each class and subject, at a certain rate 
per capita of passes at the annual examination. No child can be pre- 
  
1 Great care is exercised to prevent the interruption of the secular programme by 
religious exercises. It is especially ordered that religious instruction must be so 
arranged, (@) that each school shall be open to children of all communions for-com- 
bined literary and moral instruction; (b) that, in respect of religious instruction, 
due regard be had to parental right and authority, and accordingly that no child 
shall receive or be present at any religious instruction of which his parents or guard- 
ians disapprove; and (c) that the time for giving religious instruction be so fixed 
that no child shall be thereby in effect excluded, directly or indirectly, from the 
other advantages which the school affords. (Official Rules and Regulations, 1887, 
p. 8)

sented for examination who does not make at least one attendance! in 
the last fortnight of the month preceding the inspector’s examination. 
The system of payment upon results seems to have met with less oppo- 
sition in Ireland than in England or Scotland, probably because only a 
small portion of the grant has been thus allotted. 
The following statistics show the status of 8,175 schools examined in 
1890 with respect to attendance, classification of pupils, and passes:

Of the total number of pupils examined in infants’ grade (114,591) 
27,449, about 24 per cent, were taught by kindergarten methods. 
The report shows that at least one-fifth of the pupils presented for 
examination had pursued extra optional subjects. Music led the list 
with 70,315; drawing followed with 45,911; algebra, 12,337. Altogether 
pupils were presented in 27 extra subjects. Greek and Latin both 
appear in the list, the former with 10 pupils, the latter with 142. 
Course of study in training colleges—The course of study for the 
training colleges includes all the subjects enumerated for the elemen- 
tary schools together with the theory and practice of teaching. Vari- 
ous branches of industrial training are included in the programmes, 
among which, as also in the actual application of the programmes, 
agriculture holds the chief place. 
MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS. 
Supply of text-books.—The sanction of the commissioners, as has been 
noted, was necessary for all text-books used in the schools. At first, 
owing to the lack of suitable books, they were obliged to publish their 
own; this necessity having passed away, it became evident that supplies 
could not be obtained so readily and cheaply from any other source, 
and consequently the books in use, whether their own publications or 
those of private authors, are sold by the commissioners and delivered 
to the pupils at cost price. The annual expenditure for books and other 
requisites furnished is about $25,000 more than the receipts from sales. 
Average attendance required and length of school year.—As a rule, in 
  
  \The roll is made up each day. A child who is excused before the liter; 
cises of the day are completed is not counted in making up the attendance.  
-P-A-G-E-193
  EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM OF IRELAND. 161 
order that a school should be recognized by the commissioners it must 
maintain an average daily attendance! of 30 pupils. Special provisions 
are made, however, for the effects of epidemics, exceptionally severe 
weather, etc. A school year must be at least 200 days, and must offer 
at least four hours’ secular instruction daily (including, if necessary, a 
playtime of half an a hour) for five days in the week. 
Arrangements are made for half-time attendance of factory children, 
who may be presented for examination and secure payments upon a 
varying record of attendance, of which the maximum is either 135 
days of three hours each or 66 days of six hours each. 
Provisions for industrial training.—In their fourth report (1837) the 
commissioners discussed plans for industrial education and for foster- 
ing schools of industry. They proposed the immediate establishment of 
such a school in the vicinity of Dublin, to be equipped with shops and 
farm. In their report for the next year they announced as an indis- 
pensable condition for aid toward a school of industry, that a work 
room “shall be annexed to it if it be situated in a city or town, and if 
it be a country or rural school that a certain quantity of land shall be 
provided for garden culture. They will consider schools for girls as of 
the class of elementary schools, but they will require that instruction 
be there given in sewing, knitting, and other works suited to females.” 
In the following report (1839) they notice the establishment of their 
first model farm. This feature of their work has been steadily devel- 
oped and they have now two agricultural schools, ¢. e., the Albert 
Model Agricultural School, Glasnevin, near Dublin, and the Munster 
Model Agricultural and Dairy National School. The commissioners 
report in 1890 also47 school farms in connection with ordinary national 
schools, and 29 school gardens; from the former 701 students and from 
the latter 437 were presented for examination. The Glasnevin school 
serves as an experimental farm for the Marlborough Street Training 
College; a dairy school is maintained in connection therewith, another 
at Cork, and departments for dairy instruction at most of the farms. 
An experiment in itinerant dairy instruction made in the neighbor- 
hood of Dungannon in 1888 has proved sufficiently successful to war- 
rant an extension of the work. Instruction in the theory of agriculture 
is compulsory in all rural schools for boys in the fourth, fifth, and 
sixth classes and optional for girls. The commissioners also report 
that instruction in handicraft has been recently added to the extra 
branches upon which the boys of the higher classes of the national 
schools may be examined. Arrangements for classes in spinning, 
weaving, and other cottage industries are in progress, the Government 
having sanctioned result fees for proficiency in these arts. 
Needlework and knitting have become a part of the course in all

national schools for girls, and in many higher classes. lace-making is 
successfully taught. 
Domestic economy was taught in 1890 to 3,933 girls.in 300 schools. 
Itis generally conceded that the industrial education of girls is most 
carefully looked after in the convent schools. 
Notwithstanding the efforts of the commissioners to promote indus- 
trial training the languishing state of many native industries and of 
the arts in general was urged in Parliament as evidence that technical 
instruction is not sufficiently regarded. If this be true, however, it is 
undeubtedly due to causes beyond the control of the commissioners. 
In the theoretical elaboration of the system whose principal features 
have here been outlined, apparently no detail has been overlooked. 
Judged from the American standpoint, the system would seem to be 
entirely wanting in the force and spirit of spontaneous action. Noth- 
ing else gives a system so strong a hold upon the sympathies of a people 
nor such powerful effect upon their development. Systems wanting in 
this element have the character rather of expedients than of deep-rooted 
institutions, and to this general rule the Irish system is no exception, 
Its results as a practical expedient may be judged from several particu- 
lars. 
The average daily attendance maintained in the schools is low, being, 
as already noted, but 10 per cent of the total population, 47 per cent of 
the total enrollment, and 59 per cent of the average annual enrollment. 
This is explained in part by the sparse population of many districts, 
the poverty of the people, and the absolute demand for the help of the 
children in agricultural regions. The failure of the system to modify 
class distinctions is due in some measure to the fact that it has little 
attraction for the rural gentry of Ireland.! In the chief cities the sys- 
tem, it is said, can not compete with the eundis of the “ Christian 
Brothers.” 
SECONDARY AND SUPERIOR SCHOOLS OF IRELAND. 
In dealing with education in Ireland the General Government does 
not confine itself to elementary schools. To complete our view of the 
subject reference must be made to secondary and superior instruction, 
although details can not here be considered. 
In Ireland, as in Great Britain and in Europe generally, ceeandeay

for Ineland, is reported as. saying, “The Christian Brothers had practically the edu- 
cation of the whole Irish urban population in their hands, for their schools were 
situated in all the chief centers of population. The most influential men in every 
city and large town in Ireland had been their pupils. Their system wasregarded in 
Ireland as the really national system. It was adapted to the genius of the people, 
it was deeply grounded in their respect and affection.” (London Times, March 23, 
1892.)

  EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM OF IRELAND. 163: 
instruction, as understood in this. country, is imparted in schools whose. 
classification is determined rather by social than by scholastic consid- 
erations. The schools of the secondary or middle class in Ireland are 
either private or endowed. Most of the latter are of ancient date, and- 
although in many cases. founded for the benefit of the poor and 
lowly, have come to be almost exclusively the privilege of the gentry; 
they are classical schools of the traditional order. 
In 1878 an intermediate education board was established by Govern- 
ment to maintain examinations for schools of this class and to dispense 
Government aid to them in the form of payments for success at exami- 
nations or,.as it is called, “upon results.” Judging by the increase in 
the number of pupils seeking the examinations, this has proved a popu- 
Jar scheme. The number rose from 3,954 (3,218 boys, 736 girls) in 1879 
to 5,236 (3,943 boys, 1,293 girls), The amount of results fees paid to 
managers of schools.on account of these examinations was £13,687 6s. 
($66,520); the number of schools sharing in: the same, 244.1 
The oldest institution for superior instruction in Ireland is. the Uni- 
versity of Dublin (‘Trinity College), chartered by Queen Elizabeth. 
Besides the arts faculty, schools of law,. divinity, medicine, and 
engineering are comprised in this foundation. Roman Catholics were 
not permitted to take degrees in the university until 1793, when the dis- 
ability was removed by-an act of Parliament. Eighty years passed 
before they were allowed recognition in the election for fellowships or 
for scholarships on the foundation of the college. Meanwhile, in 1854, 
aclass of nonfoundation scholarships was established which were not 
restricted to any religious denomination. The final abolition of “tests,” 
excepting in the case of professors and lecturers in the faculty of theol- 
ogy, was accomplished by act of Parliament in 1873, through the 
direct efforts of Mr. Fawcett, at that time postmaster-general. 
Until 1850 the University. of Dublin was the: only body in Ireland 
authorized by law to confer degrees. 
In 1849 three institutions, called Queen’s Colleges, were established 
by the Government at Cork, Belfast, and Galway, respectively, for the 
avowed purpose of maintaining purely secular instruction. In pursu- 
ance of this purpose the colleges were organized with faculties of arts, 
engineering, law, and medicine, theology being excluded. Parliament 
voted the money for buildings and equipment, and an‘annual appropria- 
tion of £7,000 ($34,000) for each foundation. In the following year the 
work was completed. by the creation of the Queen’s University in Ire- 
land, empowered to conduct degree examinations for the students of 
the Queen’s Colleges.. In 1879 this foundation was abolished and the 
Royal University created in its place. The examinations and degrees 
of this university are open to all candidates, women included. Alex- 
1 As to the tendency of this policy to foe einen attainments, see the article 
by Prof. Mahaffy alluded to on p. 162,

  164 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
andra College, founded in 1866 for the higher education, of women, 
prepares women for the degree examinations. 
The movements of which the Queen’s Colleges and the Royal Uni- 
versity were the outcome are inextricably involved with the political 
and religious history of the country. The outcome on the side of the 
Catholic party, which has maintained a struggle for the official recog- 
nition of a university of its own, is the college of the Catholic University, 
Dublin, founded in 1854, 
The rivalry of the universities and denominational zeal appear to 
stimulate the interest in higher education. Dublin University enjoys 
a prestige which even those who have suffered from its intolerance in 
the past recognize with pride. The preparations for the tercentenary 
of this university, appointed for July, 1892, call forth from every center 
of learning high praise for its scholastic distinction and for the number 
and valuable achievements of its illustrious graduates. 
To complete the enumeration of superior institutions, mention should 
be made of the Royal College of Science, Dublin, which is maintained 
by the science and art department. This is a high-grade scientific 
school, whose courses of instruction prepare students for the degree 
examinations of the Royal University. 
The same department maintains at Dublin a museum of science and 
art, which includes also a national library. The numbers annually 
visiting the various departments of this museum (344,071 in 1890) tes- 
tify to the popular appreciation of their advantages. 
The recent census (1891) reveals a favorable view of the results of 
education in the country. The census commissioners observe that 
“the progress achieved in both primary and superior instruction may 
be considered the most gratifying fact elicited by the census. In 1881 
the percentage of wholly illiterate persons was 25.2, whereas in 1891 it 
reached no more than 18.4 per cent. Of the whole population above 
5 years of age, 70.6 per cent could read and write at the latter date as 
compared with 59.3 per cent in 1881. The addition to the number of 
schools and of pupils has been relatively small.”? 
The improvement in material conditions which is also brought out 
by the census must be regarded as another favorable indication of the 
effects of the educational system. 
  
1Tn this connection it should be observed that the returns show “ a decrease of no 
less than 15.7 per cent in the number of children under 15 years of age as compared 
with the returns of the previous decade (1881). This decrease reaches 18 per cent 
among children 5 to 10 years old, and 19 per cent among children 1 to 5 years. 
Analysis of the returns makes it evident that this decrease is not due to emigration 
alone, but is the proof of a check in the normal increase of the population.” (Lon- 
don Times, August 19, 1892.)

I, GENERAL STATEMENT. 
(4) Origin.—The inventions of modern times have perfected many 
old industries, such as spinning and weaving, and led to the establish- 
ment of new ones, such as the building of engines, labor-saving ma- 
chines, locomotives, and steamships, and the chemical and electric 
industries. The former mode of perspective drawing has been supple- 
mented by parallel projection, according to the principles of which 
working drawings are made, which furnish the means of easy and 
accurate measurement. This has greatly promoted progress in tech- 
nical pursuits. The liberty of trade, which is barely 50 years old in 
central Europe, has added another incentive to technical education; 
it has increased the demands on the talents of industrial men. To 
develop these talents and special aptitudes is the aim of industrial 
schools, the youngest branch of the modern school system. 
' France took the lead in this. German experts, like Hitelberger and 
von Dumreicher, emphasized the fact. that the strength of French tex- 
tiles, for instance, and the greater value of the products of French art 
165 
 
-P-A-G-E-198
  166 EDUCATION REFORT, 1890-91. 
industry, were not owing to the greater innate talents of French laborers, 
but to their better and more appropriate schooling in labor. This spe- 
cial education had been going on in France from the time of Colbert 
(minister of finance of Louis XIV). Indisputable proofs of this have 
been furnished by the various world’s expositions, especially that of 
Philadelphia in 1876, from which city the German commissioner, Prof. 
Reuleaux, reported to the Imperial Government, “ Our goods are cheap, 
but poor.” These expositions opened the eyes of intelligent men to 
the great inadequacy. of the existing institutions for industrial educa- 
tion, and it may be said that German industry thereupon took an up- 
ward start most gratifying in its results, since it was consistently 
planned and aided by the establishment of higher institutions for 
technical and industrial pursuits. 
The entire system of technical and industrial schools of central 
Europe (Germany, Austria, and Switzerland) is still in its youth, hence 
many questions. concerning it are yet under discussion; course and 
method of instruction are still mcoted problems, and much less. defin- 
itely settled than: those of elementary and secondary schools for gen- 
eral culture. Another cause that retards an early settlement is the 
fact that laymen who represent various interests assume to dictate in 
the management and plans of these schools; hence it is that some- 
times the results attained by such schools ave not commensurate with 
the outlay, and their usefulness is questioned. 
These schools are established and maintained chiefly by commit- 
tees and trade unions; by the latter in Saxony, Hessia, Nassau, and 
Switzerland. When the funds of these are insufficient, or the needs of 
the country demand it, for instance, for the promotion of the building 
trades, industrial art, or technical universities, schools maintained by 
the state are justified. Only in exceptional cases does the state main- 
. tain lower industrial schools, in Austria more frequently than.in other 
countries. In some cases the state encourages and subsidizes.lower 
schools, and in others the revivifying and stirring influence and active 
participation of individual leaders furnish the necessary impetus for 
the establishment of such schools, and at times also for their mainte- 
nance. 
(2) Classification.—According to the requirements of admission and 
. the objects of the schools they are classed as (a) lower, (b) secondary 
industrial schools, and (c) art schools and polytechnica.. According to the 
~ time when instruction is given they are classed as (a) day, (b) evening, 
and (¢) Sunday schools. According to their aim they are classed in 
industrial continuation schools and trade schools. Beside these classes: 
we may divide the schools into those for boys and those for girls, also 
into public and private schools. When comparing the statistics of these - 
schools, care must be taken to consider the time devoted to studies; 
thus, for instance, a three-years’ course in an industrial continuation 
school with four weekly hours of instruction (equal to four hundred and
-P-A-G-E-199
INDUSTRIAL AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION IN EUROPE. 167 
eighty hours), is about equal to fourteen weeks of instruction in an 
industrial day school with thirty-five hours per week. 
(3) Organic connection of industrial and technical schools— Among 
industrial schools the practical relation of one class of schools to other 
classes is not well defined. This may be the cause why some, like agri- 
cultural and various trade schools, are given over to the supervision of 
one governmental department while art schools and polytechnica are 
given to another. An organic connection is as yet not practicable, 
although the necessity makes itself felt quite keenly. In the system of 
schools for general culture and the learned professions the division and 
limitation ofeach grade of schools have developed in the course of time 
owing to the scientific unity, the so-called wniversitas literarum. The 
distinctions between general and industrial continuation schools, 
between technical and trade schools, between lower and secondary 
technical schools, and between secondary and higher schools, or poly- 
technica—have nowhere been sharply drawn. This makes extremely 
difficult a definite grouping of these institutions according to plan and 
course of study, as well as a mutual understanding among themselves 
regarding their respective functions. 
(4) Connection of industrial schools with industrial life; chief super- 
visory authorities—This connection is very important, since the schools 
are to serve practical life. A fulfillment of the following conditions 
promotes the connection: — 
(a4) Selection of location: Professional schools that depend upon con- 
stant contact with workshops and factories must be located in centers 
of industrial activity, and must be near to the branches of industry 
they are to serve. 
(b) Students: Preliminary practical work or experience gained in 
workshops is frequently a condition of admission to trade schools. 
Practical work side by side with academic instruction and separation 
of the students according to trades in industrial continuation schools, 
aid in connecting industrial education and practical life. 
(ec) Course of study and methods of instruction: The connection of 
industrial education with industrial pursuits must not only exist but 
be thoroughly understood by the students. The more the industrial 
schools place in the foreground studies which can be immediately util- 
ized in the workshop, and the more they promote technical ability 
(especially drawing), the more will they rise in the estimation of mas- 
ters and workmen. In arithmetic, for instance, aceuracy and skill are 
the most essential aims, hence restriction to the simplest modes of 
solving problems is necessary. In geometry it is much less the logical 
proof than itis practical application that must be considered; in draw- 
ing itis not so much ornamental as it is technical drawing, parallel 
projection, or the making of working drawings. Side by side with the 
technical the economic side of an industrial pursuit is to be considered, 
thus particular attention is paid to bookkeeping and the consideration 
 
-P-A-G-E-200
    168 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
of profit and loss. It is altogether wrong, although customary, to ex- 
pect and demand of industrial schools. that they should furnish men 
who are perfect in certain trades or arts, instead of mem able to become 
masters of their particular branch in the future. 
(d) Teachers: The teachers must be trade masters, or at least be in 
contact with master workmen; in the first case there is danger that the 
method of instruction will be anything but pedagogical, since men of 
that kind are apt to take for granted what must first be learned. 
Teachers should be and are often sent to other centers of industry for 
information. 
(e) The material appliances of instruction should be objects of prac- 
tical use; at any rate should be suitable for such use. Thus, for in- 
stance, actual models should be taken from workshops and museums 
of industry. In the selection of these appliances practical experts 
should be consulted. 
(f) Supervision. Local supervision should be exercised by successful 
tradesmen who can aim at close connection between school and trade, 
raise the standing of technical instruction in the eyes of all concerned, 
and lend their influence toward regular attendance. These local super- 
visors should make frequent visits to the schools. It has been found 
that the chief supervision is best exercised by the state department of 
trade and commerce, and not by the department of public education. 
The ultimate aim of all industrial schools, the promotion of wealth, out- 
weighs the means, promotion of education,in the community. As an 
exception to this are considered the technical universities or polytech- 
nica, which are everywhere in central Europe placed under the super- 
vision of the minister of education. 
In Prussia industrial and technical schools have been transferred 
from one department of state to another. Many of them were placed 
under the supervision of the minister of education in 1877, but in 1885 
they were, after rather unpleasant experiences, transferred again to the 
minister of industry and commerce. In Saxony the industrial, com- 
mercial, and agricultural schools have always been under the jurisdic- 
tion of the minister of the interior. In Wiirtemburg there has been in 
the department of education since 1858 a subordinate commission for in- 
dustrial continuation schools formed of practical tradesmen and com- 
mercial men, also of members of the commission for secondary schools 
and higher institutions, as well as directors of the school of design. 
In Baden we find an anomaly in the fact that one industrial art school 
(Pforzheim) is supervised by the minister of education and another 
(Carlsruhe) by the minister of the interior. In Switzerland the con- 
stitution expressly enjoins upon the federal government to establish 
technical universities and schools that lead up to them. In Austria, 
since 1882, a combination of all industrial schools has been effected 
under the supervision of the minister of education, but the appropria- 
tions for these schools are managed by the minister of commerce. The
-P-A-G-E-201
  INDUSTRIAL AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION IN EUROPE. 169 
supervision is exercised by a central commission of industrial instrue- 
tion, one-half of the members of which are appointed by each of the 
two ministers. An especial representative of the minister of com- 
merce in this central commission has the privilege of objecting to any 
measure, and thus to retard and submit it to the decision of higher 
authority. The inspectors of industrial schools are appointed by both 
ministers. 
(g) Workshops are often connected with trade or industrial schools. 
(See also No.17.) It is often left out of consideration that public indus- 
trial education is not to be the root, but a blossom, if not a fruit of 
industry. Schools that are to create new industries are rarely success- 
ful. 4 
(5) Frequent faults of industrial schools.—(a) Organization: Some 
schools have aims which are too high: Objects of art industry are 
made in them instead of more common articles. Entire locomotives 
or engines are drafted by students insufficiently prepared. Draw- 
ings of details of machines would seem more appropriate; students 
of average talent can thus reach a moderate degree of proficiency 
where otherwise they would be discouraged in the face of unattain- 
able results. Knowledge of the demands of practical life, constant 
consideration for the capacity of the student, a proper estimation of 
purposes, means, and persons, and of the fact that every human being 
may find a field of usefulness, however modest it may be, will safely 
guard against the most common fault of industrial schools. One 
fault frequently encountered is that the teachers do not limit them- 
selves to that which is attainable by, and desirable for the average. 
However, this is an error often found in young educational institu- 
tions. 
(b) School hours: Industrial education was at first, and still is, 
obliged to make use of the time not otherwise occupied by either day 
school or work in factories and at home, 7. ¢., the time for recreation, 
evenings and Sundays. The oldest industrial schools were mostly Sun- 
day schools. But any encroachment upon the time of recreation causes 
overwork, lassitude, repugnance for school, and neglect of religion by - 
the pupils. The increasing estimation of industrial education caused 
an increase of the time devoted to it. In this regard the commercial 
schools are in the lead. Of thirty-two commercial schools in Saxony 
only one is a Sunday school. In the industrial continuation schools in 
Saxony 36 per cent of the time per week given to instruction falls upon 
Sundays, 39 per cent upon evenings and week days, and the remainder 
represents the proportion of time in day schools. In Switzerland 17 
per cent of the time falls upon Sunday and 49 per cent upon evening 
schools. Overwork of pupils who come from factories and workshops 
is not so common as it is among students of secondary schools who 
take industrial instruction supplementary to their academic work, 
It is now considered unquestionable that day schools are far more suc-
-P-A-G-E-202
  170 a EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
cessful than evening and Sunday schools. In most places the teachers 
of common schools teach in industrial continuation schools, and a spe- 
cial remuneration is given them. Opposition to industrial instruction in 
the daytime is frequently found among the masters of the workshops in 
which the apprentices are gaining their practical experience. But this 
opposition is not Very formidable. The absence of suitable rooms 
and the lack of well-prepared teachers is everywhere deplored. Since 
Sunday afternoon has for ages been considered by law a proper time 
for this instruction, it is found difficult to convert the masses to the 
conviction that day schools should be established. 
(c) Schoolrooms: The lower industrial schools, both continuation 
and trade schools, are nearly all suffering from want of suitable rooms, 
since, jn the nature of the case, both tuition fees and public appropria- 
tions are frequently insufficient to meet even reasonable requirements. 
(d) Method of instruction: In this seems to be found the most promi- 
nent weakness of special schools. Insufficient consideration for the 
unequal and deficient preparation of the pupils; the fact that the teach- 
ers are notin living contact with practical life,and that they emphasize 
mere theories, hence false science, are the most glaring faults found. 
The following quotations are interesting: 
In France they teach what is immediately necessary, with us, the ultimate cause 
of everything; we teach from the head into the hand; Frenchmen and Englishmen 
from the hand into the head; hence we pay for our thorough theoretical knowledge 
with decreased practical capacity. (Felisch.) 
The tendency to theorizing is already so preponderant among the Germans over 
the practically productive activity that one is apt to perceive in our workshops the 
ancient proverbial school atmosphere which promotes neither pleasure in practical 
labor nor skill in execution. This atmosphere is not noticed in workshops of coun- 
tries that have reached a higher industrial level than Germany. (Von Steinbeis.) 
Other errors seem to be found in gaps in the courses of study; for 
instance, the absence of projective drawing before. constructive draw- 
ing is taken up, and instrumental drawing before projective drawing 
is commenced. At times proper consideration of artistic taste beside 
technique is lacking, and at times undue consideration of taste over 
technique is found. In some schools simple time-saving methods of 
procedure are neglected; for instance, very carefully executed paint- 
ings in water colors absorb valuable time, when simple sketches with 
lead or color pencil would suffice. 
(e) Supervision: This is one of the weakest points of cits edu- 
cation, as is also irregular attendance of the pupils. 
(f) Absence of proper appliances of instruction: For instance, no 
specimens of projective drawing, no models in plaster, ete. All these 
faults are obstructing the progress which industrial schools might 
make. (See Roscher, in article referred to.) 
(6) Compulsory attendance.—For general continuation schools com- 
pulsory-attendance laws have proved beneficial (in Wiirtemberg since 
1836, in Gotha since 1872, in Saxony since 1873, in Baden, Hessia, Wei-
-P-A-G-E-203
  INDUSTRIAL AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION IN EUROPE. 171 
mar, Coburg since 1874, in other Thuringian principalities since 1876). 
But for industrial continuation schools compulsion is recommended 
only where the system of schools is not sufficiently dev eloped or where 
the schools possess little attraction. 
Voluntary attendancein industrial schools separates the chaft from: the wheat, 
prevents thrashing of empty straw, and.a sheer waste of valuable time on the part 
of the teacher and pupil. (Von Steinbeis.) 
Discipline and progress commonly. improve when compulsion ceases. 
In Wiirtemberg those continuation schools in which the Government 
decreed compulsory attendance exhibited very mediocre results. It is 
a general experience all over the Empire that information through the 
press, encouragement, excellent results exhibited by some schools, and 
especially the desire for higher and better paying education in techni- 
cal and art pursuits, have made compulsory-attendance laws unneces- 
sary. When there was no such law for commercial continuation 
schools in Germany seventy-nine such schools were established, but 
during the time in which municipal authorities decreed compulsory 
attendance only thirty-five were established. The new imperial law 
for the regulation of industry gives municipal authorities the right to 
decree compulsory attendance at. continuation schools for all juvenile 
laborers between 14 and 18 years of age. This, however, has only 
significance for Prussia, where a general law to that effect. does not 
exist. 
While compulsion is not found direetly advantageous for industrial 
schools, it proves to be so indirectly, if applied to general continuation 
schools, that is, post-graduate courses of elementary schools. Young 
laborers, knowing that they are obliged to attend that kind of school 
until 17 years of age, or go to an industrial school, prefer the latter, 
the practical utility of which is very apparent.. More than one-half of 
the 200 schools of Saxony have been established since 1873, the date 
of the introduction of compulsory attendance for general continuation, 
schools. In communities where this compulsion is exercised the indus- 
trial schools: attract the more skillful and aspiring boys. 
(7) Sources of revenue of industrial schools.—(a) Tuition fees: Charg- 
ing a tuition fee works advantageously, because it makes the student 
and his family esteem the value of the instruction; it promotes also 
regularity of attendance and the diligence of the student; it induces 
poor families to save their pennies, and elevates their self-confidence 
and self-esteem. Industrial instruction for which fees are charged is 
attended more regularly and willingly than if itis gratuitous, as the 
experience in Wiirtemberg plainly showed when a fee was charged in 
1853. Previous to that date pupils thought to confer a favor upon a 
teacher by being present. Indigent pupils: can be, and are, released 
from paying. Sometimes the fees are graded for residents and non- 
residents, citizens and foreigners,

most desirable that the various trades should subsidize and aid indus- 
trial schools, but the entire support seems too heavy a tax upon them, 
hence city, province, and state governments are called upon for aid. 
It has been found that the maintenance of an industrial school is an 
inspiring object for trade unions. There is a causal nexus between the 
school and the standing of the particular trade it represents or chiefly 
promotes. 
The principle formerly adhered to in Prussia, that the community 
should furnish the building and furniture as well as material, and should 
pay one-half of the cost not covered by tuition or private bequests, if 
the state should pay the other half and furnish industrial drawing 
schools with the necessary models, was not applicable in every case. 
It did not consider the means of the locality, the extent of the school 
and its significance for larger or smaller industries. Hence the Prus- 
sian government has of late considerably increased its appropriations 
for such schools. In Saxony no such scheme has been adopted. But 
when a community or those most directly interested furnish a specified 
sum for the establishment and maintenance of an industrial school, the 
minister aids it to an extent decided by himself. No state in Germany 
has so many industrial schools supported chiefly by representatives of 
industry. In 1889 there was expended in Saxony $24,000 for 28 indus- 
trial continuation schools, $28,320 for 29 weaving schools, $36,720 for 
36 other trade schools, and $87,360 for commercial schools. 
The following figures will show the proportions of tuition fees and 
and other revenues:

It seems comparatively easy to support commercial schools by means 
of tuition fees. In Wiirtemberg the fee is required by law to cover the 
cost of heating and lighting. The community is obliged to furnish the 
buildings, but the state usually aids in the erection of buildings by a> 
special subsidy. The remainder of the costs are borne in equal share 
by comniunity and state. In 1868-69 the state’s share amounted to 
$13,812, in 1888-89 to $39,360. In Austria the generosity of philan- 
thropists and those interested in industry has not been called upon, 
hence the essential expenditures of lower industrial schools have been 
defrayed by the state exclusively. The 29 schools for the textile 
industry in Saxony are all established and chiefly maintained by com- 
munities, societies, and trade unions, while of the 29 Austrian schools

of that kind only one is not a state school. A similar condition is 
shown by the other special schools of Austria. During the year 1891 
the money from local sources for their maintenance amounted to 
$19,753, while the state paid $699,006. The central government of 
Switzerland, since 1885, grants subsidies to industrial schools and 
museums, to the extent of one-half the sum spent by the cantons 
(states), communities, societies, and private persons. These subsidies 
amounted to $30,400 in 1885, and $64,200 in 1889. They are not allowed. 
to take the place of any part of the sums derived from other sources, 
and, as arule, are not to be applied to the erection of buildings, or for 
heating and lighting, or for furniture and appliances; but for salaries, 
and extending time of instruction or the course of study by adding 
new classes. Appliances of instruction, such as models and drawings 
and additions to libraries, may also be purchased from the money 
granted by the federal government. General continuation schools are 
sometimes, by means of these federal subsidies, changed to industrial 
schools. 
(8) Teachers.—The best organization and the most lavish appliances 
of instruction in industrial schools are worthless if teachers are want- 
ing to make proper use of them. Close and constant contact of the 
teachers with industrial life is the main point. Skillful and practically 
experienced persons become excellent teachers in industrial schools. 
much more easily than theorizers who have gained a little practice and 
use it merely for illustration. (Roscher.) 
In Wiirtemberg every candidate for a position as teacher in a tech- 
nical art school is required to have worked for wages in a shop for a 
number of years. This is particularly important for teachers of tech- 
nical drawing, who should insist upon the drawing of plans which are 
practically applicable. Elementary school teachers commonly lack 
industrial knowledge as well as skill in mechanical drawing and in 
constructive geometry. Mechanics usually lack knowledge of con- 
struction in other industries. Architects have been found most suita- 
ble. In Wiirtemberg architects, foremen, and engineers are selected 
as teachers of industrial drawing and allied branches of industrial art, 
especially if they have spent some time in foreign countries and received 
pecuniary aid from the state for that purpose. Scanty aid of this kind 
requires those who receive it to spend part of their time outside of their 
studies in earning money in practical pursuits. The result is, thatsuch 
persons aim at what is practically possible. In cases where the state’s 
aid was sufficient to support the recipients without engaging in prac- 
tical work, the results were anything but satisfactory. 
On the other hand, it has been proved that itis always advantageous 
to pay good, successful teachers high salaries, and to place their future, 
as well as that of their families, beyond need, otherwise they will seek 
and find more lucrative occupation in factories and trades. This dan- 
ger is much greater in industrial schools than in schools for general

culture.. In Saxony industrial education, and the schools that repre-- 
sented it, were greatly promoted in 1886 by the establishment of a fund 
from which pensions are paid toteachers of special schools. This fund 
offers the same advantages to teachers that other officers. of the state 
enjoy, and thus raises the profession of teaching. In 1891, 124 indus- 
trial teachers had become contributors to the fund to the amount of 
$7,920, and the state’s contribution amounted to $2,400. This fund has 
now reached the sum of $70,560. 
In only a few states has professional examination for teachers of in- 
dustrial schools been introduced. In technical universities or poly- 
technica the desire has been expressed that for certain branches of 
secondary industrial schools a professional examination passed before 
the faculty of the technical university be required. This plan doesnot 
consider the fact that men possessing a moderate degree of theoretical 
and. scientific knowledge may well act as teachers in industrial or 
tradeschools.. In Baden the theoretical requirements for the industrial 
teachers were lowered somewhat in 1882, in order to obtain teachers of 
more practical experience. Before 1882 the requirement was, that such 
teachers should have passed through the normal schools and a polytech- 
nicum,.and have spent some years in practical work. Since that year 
they may go through a normal school or any other secondary school, a 
school of architecture, or institution of similar purport, and spend a 
few years. in-practical work. The state aids candidates by affording 
them the means for foreign travel; sometimes the candidates go in 
groups, sometimes singly. There are supplementary courses arranged 
for industrial teachers, and in this, Austria has: taken the lead. In 
1889-90, 32 Austrian teachers were sent to the World’s Exposition in 
Paris, and received each an average of $94 traveling expenses; 15 
teachers were sent to other places with an average of $51. In 1890 
eight supplementary courses in drawing were given to industrial teach- 
ers; 94 availed themselves of this opportunity. Two courses in. com- 
mercial branches were given to. industrial teachers; 59 participated. 
In Switzerland groups of teachers, averaging between 7 and 24, have 
been sent to famous schools, notably to Winterthur. Two-thirds of the 
expenses were met by the federal government. In Hessia from 3 to 5 
industrial teachers are sent to Darmstadt to go through technical 
courses lasting from twoto three months. They receive aid amounting 
to about $20 per month from the association of industries. Common- 
sehool teachers apply for these courses during vacation, as do-also 
builders during winter when the weather prevents them from working, 
Besides regularly appointed teachers in: schools there are:also-ambu- 
latory industrial teachers especially in Wiirtemberg since 1849, and.in 
Austria since 1881. In Wiirtemberg these teachers attempt to teach 
hand weavers to produce new patterns and to overcome difficulties aris- 
ing from new machines. These men usually stay two months at a 
place. Since the Government is very circumspect in the selection of
-P-A-G-E-207
  INDUSTRIAL AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION IN EUROPE. 175 
such men, ithas been found that they do more than teaching; they 
aid in establishing connection between manufacturers and merchants. 
During the years from 1849 to 1882 experienced weavers were chiefly 
chosen who had worked in foreign countries. Such ambulatory courses 
for hand weaving, industrial bookkeeping, cutting of garments, em- 
broidery, straw weaving, and machine sewing have been held in 28 
cities of Wiirtemberg. 
(9) Appliances of instruetion.—As many industrial schools had. to pre- 
pare their own teachers, so also they were necessarily obliged to make 
their own apparatus. Up to the year 1860 the drawing models were 
selected with more consideration for the needs of art academies than 
for common industrial and art industrial schools. Itis, or should be, 
the object of the central government, so it. is claimed, to supervise the 
seleetion and application of suitable apparatus in industrial schools. 
A list of such things (drawings and models) for industrial continua- 
tion schools, trade schools, and industrial drawing schools was published 
in 1888, by the department of industry of the Swiss Confederation, a 
department which supports also the Swiss permanent school exhibit in 
Ziivich. Other states go further than that. They have certain appli- 
ances of instruction made by order of the Government; Wiirtemberg 
since 1864; Austria since 1881. In Hessia the industrial society pub- 
lishes model drawings which are officially prescribed for use in indus- 
trial schools. The Austrian minister of instruction publishes annually 
a list of appliances of instruction, embracing drawings, text-books, 
manuals, and models with practical instructions for wood carving, work 
in metal, embroidery and lace work. It is.stated in each case whether 
they have been made upon the suggestion or with the support of the 
minister, or submitted by private manufacturers. The latter are clas- 
sified as recommended. or rejected. 
(10) Organization of supervision.—(See also4 (f) and 5(e). “The im- 
portance of expert supervision over the industrial school systems of — 
large cities or provinces. and states by school inspectors, has been, as is 
claimed, undervalued by the governments of many states. The claim 
has been set up that there ought to be inspectors or superintendents 
for industrial schools as there are for common schools. The support 
such men can give to teachers. and directors of industrial schools in 
suggesting, advising, warning, and admonishing, is often more impor-_. 
tant and effective than pecuniary subsidies. Such inspectors might 
see to it that every industrial school makes use of the experience of 
similar schools, and that some schools do not:enter upon the forsaken 
paths of others after they have been found misleading. These inspect- 
ors should not have directive, but only advisory power. They should 
not make uniform the industrial schools, but try to promote an adapta- 
tion to local aud technical conditions as they may exist. It is not to 
be recommended that these inspectors shall report in writing cencern- 
ing the condition. of each school they visit, lest written. vr printed
-P-A-G-E-208
  176 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
commendation and Jaudation may check the development of the school. 
Only in special cases where certain defects have to be corrected is 
the written report to the local authorities desirable.” (Roscher.) 
“The central government, however, should insist upon a brief report 
of the visits the inspector makes, which report should contain the es- 
sential advice he rendered. In case the admonition on the part of the 
inspector is not heeded without reason assigned, the annual subsidy 
might be withheld.” This is a suggestion frequently found in the ped- 
agogical literature of Germany. Saxony is the only state that has an 
expert inspector for industrial schools, the first having been appointed 
in 1884. In 1891 he had to supervise 187 industrial schools in 95 com- 
munities. He annually visits about 150 of such schools. For the 28 
schools for lace makers in Saxony a special school inspector has been 
employed since 1858. In Wiirtemberg the supervision of industrial con- 
tinuation schools is exercised by distinguished teachers of such schools. 
Of late the question has been considered whether it would not be bet- 
ter to employ afew expertinspectors. Instruction in drawing and in the 
sciences is separately supervised by experts. The commercial schools 
appear to be entirely without supervision on the part of the state. 
In Hessia the trade schools are supervised by a special committee of 
the Industrial Society. This committee consists of 8 members. In 
Austria there are 30 inspectors of industrial schools, appointed for two 
years, who are not assigned to particular localities, but with regard to 
their special aptitudes. One inspects the work in drawing, another 
that in language, or natural science, or mathematics, ete. In Switzer- 
land a college of experts, consisting of 9 members, among whom 4 are 
architects, appointed for one year by the federal government, super- 
vises all industrial schools. They meet annually in different localities 
and exchange views, experiences, listen to reports, and thus learn to 
know all the important industrial schools of the Republic. 
(11) School exhibitions have been particularly important and bene- 
ficial for industrial schools, much more so than for schools for general 
culture, especially when drawing is a prominent branch of study. If 
these exhibitions afford a general view of the whole work done by 
these schools, they will be essentially aided thereby. Such exhibi- 
tions act as an impetus to better work and popularize industrial 
education among the masses. The chief faults of former exhibitions 
of industrial schools were as follows: First. They were arranged like 
»regular annual exhibitions prepared for pupils and parents, though 
they were intended to illustrate the essential aims, methods, and courses 
of schools on a larger scale. Exhibitions arranged by states or proy- 
inces should not offer prizes for pupils’ work or that of individuals, 
Such things should be left for local exhibitions. Second. Things were 
exhibited which proved exceptional work, instead of showing what the 
average can do. Third. Instead of an arrangement of the drawings 
according to the prescribed course, they were arranged according to
-P-A-G-E-209
  INDUSTRIAL AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION IN EUROPE. 177 
decorative and esthetic motives. Itis, however, most essential to show 
the ways by which results have been obtained. Fourth. Exhibitions 
of industrial schools were mixed with those for general culture or with 
exhibitions of industries, hence attracted little or no attention, could 
not be arranged according to their peculiar needs, and lasted altogether 
toolong. An exhibition of industrial schools, lasting from eight to ten 
days during vacation, will unite teachers and authorities and the gen- 
eral public in fruitful studies and deliberations. Fifth. The written 
work of a school should not be excluded, so that the connection between. 
intellectual and manual work might be seen. Sixth. The exhibitions 
were repeated too frequently at first. The result was a diminished par- 
ticipation and waning interest. Between 1850 and 1856 these schools 
arranged for exhibitions every two years in Wiirtemberg; from 1867 
to 1889 once in seven years. Seventh. Exhibitions arranged by socie- 
ties did not find general favor. Smaller industrial schools could not 
compete with larger, better situated, and, therefore, more successful 
schools. This is the reason why exhibitions are best arranged by state 
authorities, so that all who derive subsidies from the state may be 
required to exhibit. Highth. Exhibitions without a carefully laid plan 
and expert juries are worthless and remain mere shows. Ninth. For- 
merly objects were placed side by side which could not be compared. 
As the number of industrial schools increases it has been found best 
to exhibit the work of one class of schools independent of that of an- 
other. 
Wiirtemberg held, between 1850 and 1889, nineteen exhibitions of 
industrial schools. The last one contained, for the first time, appren- 
tices’ work, appliances of instruction, as well as artistic productions 
by teachers of industrial schools. This stimulated the diligence and 
technical education of the teachers. Saxony exhibited in 1883 the 
work of 82 industrial schools of the district of Zwickau, and in 1888 that 
of 150 industrial schools of the whole Kingdom. Here was the work 
of 800 teachers and 16,000 students brought into view, and the cost 
amounted to only $1,500. Upon this occasion the principle was car- 
ried out, for the first time, that the course of instruction in any branch 
should be completely shown by its results in excellent, mediocre, and 
poor work. This principle was carried out also in the Swiss exhibition 
of continuation, trade, and drawing schools in Ziirich in 1890. The 
Industrial Society of Hessia has arranged annual exhibitions ever since 
1840, but no premiums are allowed. The authorities in Nassau collect 
the drawings of its 50 industrial schools and have them adjudged by 
an expert committee. : 
(12) Periodicals for industrial schools, statistics, and history.—Period- 
icals which give information concerning the organization, methods of 
instruction, and work of industrial schools are very important for 
teachers and directors of such schools, since they facilitate an exchange 
of views, experiences, and plans. When sucha periodicalis published

by the authorities themselves, it forms the nucleus of influence which 
extends from the center to the most remote technical schools, and aids 
the work of the Government by submitting its activity to the judgment 
of public opinion. Austria has had such a publication since 1883, entitled 
the “Central Journal for Industrial Education in Austria.” It is edited 
by the highest authority, publishes the laws, regulations, and orders 
pertaining to industrial education, the statistics of attendance, etc., 
and gives a good share of its attention and space to foreign schools. 
In Switzerland the federal government subsidizes several periodicals 
for industrial education. In return therefor the publishers distribute 
their papers to students and teachers of all the industrial schools sup- 
ported wholly or in part by the state. In Prussia the Periodical for 
Industrial Education has been published since 1886, but it is the result 
of private enterprise, and only accomplishes what can be expected from 
private enterprise. The Saxon industrial schools have an organ, en- 
titled the Industrial Review. In Wiirtemberg the Industrial Journal, 
and in Baden the Industrial Gazette are the organs. 
The statistics of industrial schools, especially those of numerous pri- 
yate institutions, are very fragmentary. The best statistical information 
is found in the Saxon report of the entire system of public education, 
which not only gives statisties of attendance of pupils and teachers, but 
also information concerning those who established and maintain the 
schools, the time of instruction, hours per week, tuition fees, expendi- 
tures, etc., for every public and private school. This report is supple- 
mented at intervals of four years by an official list of industrial, agri- 
cultural, and’ commercial schools of Saxony, which list states the 
name of the school, its location, its founder, the address of its principal, 
its object, requirements of admission, length of terms, course of study, 
teachers, number of pupils, tuition fees, etc. This list is furnished to 
allindustrial schoolsin Germany. The facility for comparison of courses 
of study and other matters offered by this official list has induced many 
schools tomake essential improvements. Prussia has recently published 
anextensive report on industrial education, which contains very valuable 
items for comparison. In Wiirtemberg very meager statistics are pub- 
lished. Baden and Bavaria issue annually brief tables of attend- 
ance. A more extended survey of the industrial schools in Baden has 
been published by Mr. Gasell, president of the chamber of commerce. 
‘The commissioners for industrial continuation schools in Wiirtemberg 
are receiving regularly written reports from all the industrial schools 
of the Kingdom, but donot publish them. The publication of a history 
of industrial schools, even though it be nothing but an account of such 
schools in a small kingdom, would be exceedingly valuable if it showed 
the first incentive to the establishment of industrial schools, how and 
when new classes were opened, how certain obstacles were overcome, 
what means aided in securing success, what faults were discovered, 
what failures were avoided or made, how the first organization changed

under’ the demands of modern times, and other points. Such a work 
would suggest improvement, give information, encourage all concerned, 
and preserve in a measure the experience of fortner years, which other- 
wise would be lost forever. : 
II, CLASSES OF SCHOOLS. 
(A.) INDUSTRIAL CONTINUATION SCHOOLS. 
(13) Although participation in the common continuation courses is 
arranged for boys of 15 to 18 years of age in most of the states of Ger- 
many, exeepting Prussia (in fact, evening schools are open from two tosix 
hours a week), and although they chiefly offer “that knowledge which is 
essential for civil life” (law of 1836 in Wiirtemberg), it can not be said 
that this instruction is sufficient for the needs of the industrial classes, 
especially as regards drawing. It must be considered, for instance, 
that in Saxony, where in 1889 there were 1,912 common. continua- 
tion schools with 76,000 pupils, a great many of these schools had 
special drawing classes for shoemakers, tailors, builders, ete. 
Industrial continuation schools have a twofold aim: first, to improve 
, and extend general knowledge in language, arithmetic, and geometry; 
second, to impart industrial knowledge and skill necessary to various 
industrial branches—as, for instance, technical drawing, industrial book- 
keeping, and knowledge of business affairs. In Hessia many industrial 
or trade schools abandoned instruction in arithmetic, language, and 
geometry in.1874, but very soon after introduced it again, because the 
common continuation schools could not sufficiently consider these 
branches. Attempts at combining industrial with agricultural con- 
tinuation schools miscarried, since one teacher could not, do justice to 
both industry and agriculture. Theindustrial schoolshavebeen blamed 
for attempting to provide instruction in the most varied industries, 
hence could never do justice to any one of them; this is depreciating 
the good that may be attained in favor of something better which is 
absolutely unattainable. 
The Austrian trade schools (fer boys of 12 to 15), which are to pre- 
pare for distinct trades, are a new kind of schools which are fashioned 
after Parisian models. In them not only is common-school instruction 
given, but industrial skillis developed in wood and metal work, model- 
ing, staining, varnishing, distilling, etc. During the third year of 
these schools the time is devoted to special branches for those who 
desire them. School workshops are arranged for apprentices who have 
no workshops of their own. The trade schools in Paris, after which 
the Austrian are fashioned, have existed since 1873. 
Prussia had, in 1890, 1,131 industrial continuation schools with 93,029 
students. They were poorly supervised, according to the official 
statement of the Government. Four hundred and fourteen of these 
schools had obligatory attendance of 49,325 students. This shows   
 
-P-A-G-E-212
  180 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
that the population is not in sympathy with the movement. In central 
and western Prussia these schools are better supported than in the 
eastern provinces. 
Bavaria has 242 industrial continuation schools, of which 194 are in- 
dependent and 48 are connected with high schools. They are attended 
by 29,472 students, of whom only 2 per cent receive instruction in day, 
and 98 per cent in evening and Sunday schools. In 165 communities 
local laws prescribe obligatory attendance. Only 7,463, or 24 per cent, 
of the students attended technical classes, while the others pursue only 
common-school studies. 
Saxony in 1889 had 28 industrial continuation schools (5 of which 
are 60 or 70 years old), but none have obligatory attendance; their 
. total enrollment was 7,912. In Wiirtemberg the industrial contin- 
uation schools are most numerous in comparison with other states. 
Of communities with more than 2,000 inhabitants, 85 per cent had 
industrial continuation schools (in Baden, only 32 per cent); the enroll- 
ment in 167 communities in Wiirtemberg was 13,649 students. Of 
every 100 apprentices, 71 attended such schools, It is most interesting 
tosee what studies these students chiefly pursued: Freehand drawing, 
7,397; arithmetic, 6,772; technical drawing, 6,346; business composition, 
6,089; geometrical construction, 4,531; penmanship 2,921. 
Baden in 1889 had 43 industrial schools, with 549 students in pre- 
paratory classes, 5,366 regular and 1,907 special students. 
Hessia had, in 1886, 73 trade schools in 64 communities, with 4,400 
students, to which must be added 7 extended trade schools, of which 2 
are connected with industrial art schools; these 2 are day schools. 
Austria in 1890 had 14 industrial continuation schools, with 3,474 
students connected with state industrial schools. Besides, Austria had 
393 independent continuation schools, with 61,567 students (132 schools 
in lower Austria, 154 in Bohemia, and 107 in the other eleven Crown 
lands). To these may be added 1,077 students in continuation courses 
offered by 8 trade schools. 
Switzerland in 1890 had 90 industrial continuation schools, trades 
schools, and drawing schools, 15 of the latter in the canton of Tessin. 
The most important of these schools are in Geneva, Zurich, St. Gall, 
Bern, Solothurn, and Aargau. 
(14) Drawing halls—For industrial schools drawing is the most im- 
portant branch of instruction. Diderot remarked: “ wne nation, o& Von 
apprendrait & dessiner, comme on apprend & écrire, Vemporterait bientét 
sur les autres dans tous les arts du godt.” Instruction in drawing which 
develops the sense of form, artistic taste, and skill of the hand isa 
supplement to general education acquired by means of the printed 
page. It promotes acute observation and strengthens the sense which 
has been dulled by literary work, and is therefore justly an obligatory 
study in common schools. It has been suggested to establish open 
drawing halls with teachers who, by living in adjoining rooms, would
-P-A-G-E-213
  
  INDUSTRIAL AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION IN EUROPE. 181 
be at the disposal of the student all day. Such halls, it is urged, would 
- even assist adults very materially, and aid in bringing school and trade 
into closer connection. In southern Germany and Austria such open 
drawing schools have been established, but they were soon afterward 
brought into connection with established schools. 
(B) INDUSTRIAL INSTITUTIONS FOR WOMEN. 
(15) These -institutions are distinguished from other industrial 
schools by offering instruction not only in modeling and drawing, indus- . 
trial arithmetic, bookkeeping, letter-writing, but also in woman’s handi- 
work, embroidery, and articles of industrial art. 
Bavaria has 26 such schools, with 2,252 students; Saxony 11, with 
1,081 students; Wiirtemberg 14, with 720 students, besides 19 woman’s 
work schools, with 4,511 students. The oldest of these institutions, 
established in 1868 in Reutlingen, had up to 1889 prepared 269 teachers 
for industrial and woman’s work schools. 
Baden has 16 trade and work schools for women, with 1,110 students. 
Besides these the Woman’s Society in Baden maintains 9 such schools, 
with 1,231 students, Hessia has also several woman’s schools for 
industrial pursuits in five cities. 
(C) LOWER INDUSTRIAL OR TRADE SCHOOLS. 
(16) Trade schools are to be distinguished from industrial continua- 
tion schools. The latter serve all or many trades or industries; the 
former only one, such as the builder’s, weaver’s, shoemaker’s, tinner’s 
turner’s, joiner’s trade, etc., and though they combine academic studies 
with manual work, they need constant and close contact with the work- 
shop and factory. The most suitable location for trade schools is at 
the center of activity of the particular industrial branch they are 
to serve. Among the requirements for admission into a trade school 
the essentials are, as a rule, familiarity with the tools of the partic- 
ular trade, skill in performing simple work, and knowledge of the 
requisite materials used. According to the regulations of the cen- 
tral commission, which supervises the trade schools of Austria, the 
establishment of such schools is advisable only ‘‘ where the existence 
of industrial life is clearly shown, and where its extent is so large, its 
capacity for development so undoubted, and its technical character so 
pronounced, that the particular branch which a school may represent 
is plainly evident.” 
The oldest and most numerous trade schools are the weaving schools 
(in Saxony since 1830, in Bavaria since 1854, in Wiirtemberg since 
1855), They have served the weaving trade admirably, especially at 
times when the ever-changing fashion preferred certain textures to 
others, or when under the presence of competition the handlooms gave 
way to power looms, when again, ‘certain finer textures could not be 
done on power looms, and handlooms had to be used; when new or

- intricate designs required not only skillful hands, but also a finely devel- 
oped sense of form and color. It is well known that the Swiss watch- 
making industry has been essentially promoted by the 9 watchmaker’s 
schools that served to introduce new devices and improvements. 3 
One objection has been raised against trade schools; it has been said 
that they limit the horizon of their pupils instead of widening it;. their 
attention is directed toward the production on a large scale which pre- 
supposes division of labor, while workshops require knowledge of all 
the bearings of a trade. This has led, in Hessia, to requiring the grad- 
uates of trade schools to pass through a supplementary course which 
teaches all the bearings of one trade. This unfavorable judgment of 
trade schools in Hessia is met by a different one, almost diametrically 
opposed to it, in Saxony, Wiirtemberg, Baden, Austria, and Switzer- 
land, and may find its cause in the fact that the students are obliged 
to earn wages during the time they attend trade schools. 
Since 1884 the secretary of the interior in Baden arranges from time 
to time in Carlsruhe for courses of instruction to trade masters for the 
sole purpose of making them acquainted with new industrial devices. 
These courses are intended for soap-boilers, tanners, shoemakers, watch- 
makers, metal-workers (etching and galvanoplastic), dyers, fresco- 
painters, paper-hangers, and plumbers; the courses last one or two 
weeks each. 
In Prussia the industrial-school system is comparatively little devel- 
oped. In 1879 the 11 mining schools, with 437 pupils, were the only 
organized and successfully directed industrial schools of the Kingdom. 
The weaving and dyeing school at Crefeld was reorganized in 1883. It 
is a large institution, well attended, and influences the great silk trade 
of that town. In Hanover 13 weaving schools and 8 weaver’s appren- 
tice shops are found. In Westphalia there are technical schools for the 
metal industry. In other parts of Prussia are found schools of ceram- 
ics, and basket-braiding schools in Silesia and the provinces of East- 
ern Prussia. Magdeburg and Flensburg have special schools for joiners 
and wood-carvers. On the shores of the North Sea and the Baltic are 
- situated 14 navigation schools, and, since 1887, 5 schools for river navi- 
gation have been opened. The trades unions maintain 294 trade schools 
(67 for barbers and hairdressers, 29 for painters and decorators, 24 for 
cobblers, lock and black smiths, 21 for bakers and confevtioners, 20 for 
tailors, 10 for joiners, ete.). S 
Bavaria has 36 trade schools, of which 23 are in upper Bavaria, 3 
weaving, 3 carving, 18 music, and 1 potter’s school, and, since 1885, 5 - 
schools for arboriculture. 
Saxony has 29 trade schools for weaving, knitting, and passemente- 
rie, with 224 hand and 67 power looms, 132 knitting machines, and 30 
passementerie handlooms. Five of these schools are day, the others 
are evening schools. The State also"maintains 6 navigation schools on 
the Elbe River, while trade unions and associations. maintain 28 lace-

making, 1 embroidery, 4 straw-weaving, 11 house industry, 2 mining, 
and 39 other trade schools. That the trade schools of Saxony enjoy 
great confidence beyond the limits of the Kingdom is seen from the fact 
that the great German labor associations (notably the watchmakers, 
turners and woodworkers, tinners, millers, and tanners) support them. 
Wiirtemberg has 4 weaving schools, but no other trade schools. 
Baden has 3 musie schools (not conservatories, for they belong to a 
higher group of schools), 1 wood and ivory carving, 15 straw-weaving, 
1 basket-braiding, and 5 blacksmith’s schools. 
Hessia has 11 carving schools and schools for decoration, lacquers, 
and hairdressing. 
Austria can boast of a very extensive and splendidly directed plan 
for industrial education on the part of the state. The representatives 
of the trades do not much participate in their management or mainte- 
nance. Twenty-nine weaving schools, of which 2 are small institutions, 
having no power looms; 30 schools for wood and stone industry, for 
variety ironwork, ceramics, and glass industry; 16 for point-lace work- 
ers and artistic embroidery; 2 for the manufacture of musical instru- 
ments; 1 for leather industry; 1 for polishing ef precious stones; 1 for 
toy manufacture, as well as 18 for basket-braiding. The state in 1889 
published a provisional course fer instruction in weaving schools to 
make a beginning in systematizing trade schools. 
Switzerland has 9 schools for watchmaking, 2 for weaving, 2 for 
carving, 1 for toy-making, and 1 for basket-braiding. 
(47) Workshops are connected with many industrial schools, espe: 
cially with weaving schools, but sometimes we find them independent 
of any school. In that case practical and not academic studies are 
pursued. They resemble the former apprentice shops, but offer instrue- 
tion on a large scale. Some writers recommend them, others see in 
- them nothing but places for training of amateurs, and therefore object 
to them. . It is said that stipends for traveling would. be vastly better. 
This objection does not refer to the shops connected with weaving 
schools. Experience has found that poorly paid masters in school 
shops teach only the less instructive branches of a trade, hence the 
many complaints of apprentices that their training is one-sided, and 
the further complaint of the trades people themselves, who claim that 
these school shops compete with them in the labor market (buildings 
furnished gratuitously and unpaid labor enable these ‘shops to sell 
their products at reduced prices). It appears prudent not to use the 
-produets of the apprentice shops as a means of meeting their expenses. 
Another danger is to be considered and to be carefully guarded against, 
namely, the often-found waste of time and material. The students are 
not trained in ecoriomy, but only in industrial skill. The technical 
leader of the shop must therefore be economically well trained. All 
the state railroad shops in Germany have apprentice shops. In Austria 
workshops are very frequently found connected with trade schools.

(18) Schools Sor the building trades.—The large number of builders 
(Germany in 1882 had 373,000 masons and 184,000 carpenters) justi- 
fies the-existence of special schools for them. These schools do not 
attempt to prepare architects or engineers of the lower order, but simply 
skilled laborers for the building trades. The first of these schools was 
established in Paris, 1740; the first in Germany, in Munich, 1823; the 
second, in Brunswick, 1831; the third, a state institution, in Saxony, 
1837, The requirement for admission is, or ought to be, one year of 
practical work in the trade. In Saxony these schools give instruction 
only in winter and have a course of four years. When such: schools 
are kept open in summer they have one-seventh or one-tenth the at- 
tendance they have in winter. While in Saxony the course is restricted 
to masonry and carpentry, in other states machine-building is fre- 
quently connected with it. The tuition fee in Saxony is 30 marks, or 
about $8; in other states it is from $25 to $30, owing to insufficient 
state subsidy. 
Prussia in 1891 had 9 schools for the building trades, with 1,825 stu- 
dents in overcrowded classes. In 1890, 870 apprentices were rejected 
for want of room. : 
The school in Brunswick alone had 1,000 students, mostly from Prus- 
sia. The state authorities in Prussia are contemplating the establish- 
ment of a tenth school of this kind. 
Bavaria has 4 schools for builders, with 1,220 students. Saxony in 
1891 had 5, with 702 students. Of the 154 hours devoted to instruction 
in the four years, 97 were devoted to drawing. The annual expendi- 
ture for 4 of these schools was $22,560. 
Wiirtemberg has a royal school for the building trade in Stuttgart. 
It was founded in 1845, and has 503 students, many of whom study 
surveying and machine-building. : 
Baden has one school at Carlsruhe, with 253 students, and gives prac- 
tical exercises in. workshops for masons and carpenters. Hessia 1 
school, Darmstadt, 81 students; Anhalt, 1 school, maintained by state 
and city. Austria has special departments for the building trades in 
its 11 schools for foremen, which were attended by 1,336 students in 
1890. : 
(19) Schools for foremen.—Most industrial continuation schools, giv- 
ing instruction on Sunday or in the evenings, and at best only from 10 
to 16 hours a week, can not prepare foremen or superintendents of shops 
for machine-building, spinning and weaving factories, etc., because it 
would require an additional number of years of study, and because the 
technical preparation of such men necessitates special training. The 
government in Saxony established in 1855 a school for foremen, the 
first of its kind. Requirements for admission: Age 16 years anda 
practical experience of two years in workshops. Length of course one 
year and a half. Hours per week, 35 to 45. These schools restrict 
themselves to what foremen really need, so that the students shall not

overvalue their capacity and forsake shop and factory to enter the 
drafting room. They are in fact intended for industrial under offi- 
cers. R ; ‘ 
Prussia has 4, Saxony 2, Austria 14 of such schools. The school in 
Chemnitz chiefly prepares soapboilers, dyers, and millers. Since its 
establishment in 1855 it has had 3,100 students.’ The Austrian schools 
together have at present 2,100 students who are preparing themselves 
for the building trades, technical mechanics, industrial arts, and chem- 
ical industries. 
(D) INDUSTRIAL SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
(20) Secondary schools.—Pursuing the course of a polytechnicum pre- 
supposes graduation from a classical or a modern high school, and 
hence can not be completed before the close of the twenty-fourth year” 
of age. 
The education offered in a polytechnicum is much too high for com- 
mon industrial purposes, because it is largely theoretical, and prevents 
the student from acquiring practical preparation and skill during the 
time when alone such skill can be acquired. Hence industrial sec- 
ondary schools, which stand between the lower industrial schools and 
technical universities and offer the strict discipline of a high school, 
seem to meet the needs of the people. The gradation.in trades and 
industries, both in kind and: extent, necessitates a gradation in the 
schools preparing for them. The famous statistician Engel calculated. 
the cost of education and maintenance of a laborer at 15 years of age 
to have been $888; that of a man with secondary education at 20 years 
of age to have been $2,904; and that of a student of a university at 
25 years of age to have been $6,600. The absence of opportunities for 
obtaining a secondary industrial education must therefore work disad- 
vantageously upon many strata of society, because it restricts them to 
a lower industrial education or lifts them up to an elevation where 
they can not support themselves, the absolutely necessary connecting 
link between elementary and higher schools being wanting. Lower 
schools are apt to push their talented students forward unduly, while 
polytechnica are forced to lower the requirements for admission, hence ~ 
industrial secondary schools will aid the lower schools by relieving 
them of elements which are apt to disturb them, and relieve the poly- 
technica by drawing from them students insufficiently prepared. 
These schools will also relieve the nation of elements which are neither 
fish nor flesh—of that half-learned industrial element which claims to 
understand everything but knows nothing thoroughly. Civil engi- 
neers, poorly prepared and loose in every joint of true education, are 
found in great abundance, while the great centers of industry need 
men such as industrial secondary schools alone can furnish, viz, ma- 
chine builders, common architects, bridge builders, surveyors, engi-
-P-A-G-E-218
  
  186 ; EDUCATION REPORT, 189¢-91. 
neers, chemists, superintendents of small factories, planners and design- 
ers, etc. The great army of labor, consisting, as it does, of privates 
and a more than sufficient number of generals and colonels, needs more 
underofficers. ‘ - 
A remarkable short-sightedness is exhibited from time to time in dis- 
-eussing secondary industrial schools. Some claim that there is no 
urgent necessity for them, “because the technical universities furnish 
a sufficient number of students who fail in examination for the higher 
honors; hence offer men of the second rank, or small caliber, for tech- 
nical pursuits.” To this the answer is given that unfit industrial “ offi- 
cers of the staff” are not necessarily fit subaltern officers; that teachers 
of higher schools insufficiently prepared are not necessarily well enough 
prepared to be elementary school teachers. The Austrian minister of 
education in 1880 had to meet the objection to secondary industrial 
' schools, “that they came into competition with polytechnica,” by show- 
ing, statistically, that these secondary schools attracted elements which 
were neither wanted in the polytechnica, nor in faet could lay claim for 
admission there. 
The Society of German Engineers, consisting of more than 6,000 mem- 
bers, declared, in 1889, that secondary industrial schools were a neces- 
sity to be provided for by the state. The industries for which they pre- 
pare are spread over the whole country. Such schools can flourish 
- only when they are independent institutions, but not if appendages of 
other schools. If the State fails to establish them the larger cities are 
not likely to doso, and “private institutions with glittering pro- 
- grammes, unfulfilled promises, low requirements for admission, attrac- 
tive uniforms for the boys, overcrowded classes, poorly paid and insuf- 
ficiently prepared teachers, and pompous, emblazoned diplomas,” will 
arise—institutions which are “worked” for a money consideration. 
The oldest secondary industrial school in Germany is the one estab- 
lished in 1836 in Chemnitz by the governmentof Saxony. It has since 
its establishment admitted 4,100 students and has served as a model 
for similar schools in other states, notably in Austria. The students 
when admitted have a high-school education and have acquired the 
privilege of serving as a volunteer in the army for only one year. The 
course of study for the technical mechanies’ branch and technical 
' chemistry is three and a half years, that for architecture three years. 
Prussia has no such secondary schools. How acutely this want is 
felt is seen from the fact that the polytechnica of Prussia have 29 per 
cent, while the same institutions in Saxony and Austria have only 10 
or 11 per cent of special students, that is, students who are not grad- 
uates of classical or other secondary schools. In the polytechnicum 
of Hanover this percentage rose to 47 per cent in the year 1890-91.

These so-called special students, special because they did not fit into 
the regular course, oblige the polytechnicum to perform the duties of 
secondary schools, which involves a weakening of its character as a 
technical university. Numerous students from Prussia in secondary 
industrial schools of other states prove the want spoken of; thus, 
of the students in such schools in Chemnitz 193 are Prussians and 670 
are Saxons; of those in Mittweida 591 are Prussians and 106 Saxons. 
The school in Hildburghausen has 247 Prusians, that in Buxtehude 445 
‘Prussians, and only 116 students from other states. The minister of 
commerce and industry in Prussia acknowledges that the reorganized 
Prussian industrial schools ‘‘can not be of much service to the trades, 
nor be preparatory schools for the polytechnica, nor are they properly 
organized to perform the functions of secondary schools.” It is officially 
recognized that Prussia will have to establish secondary industrial 
schools independent of other secondary institutions in order to com- 
plete its otherwise so well organized system of industrial education. 
In Prussia the so-called technical classes, appendages to common 
high schools, were attended by 166 students in 1888. Similar classes 
in Aachen, Barmen, and Gleiwitz have been discontinued for want of | 
attendance. A few other attempts (in Cologne and elsewhere) are still 
inembryo. Bavaria has three industrial schools, at Munich, Nurem- 
burg, and Augsburg, with 364 students. When these schools were - 
established it was hoped that their graduates would at once enter upon 
practical pursuits, but most of them entered technical universities. 
In Mecklenburg, Neustadt has 150 secondary industrial students cain 
Saxony, Chemnitz has 313; Mittweida, 479; in Meiningen, Hildburg- 
hausen has 451; in Bremen, Buxtehude has 560. 
In Austria the modern high schools (Realschulen) served from 1851 , 
till 1867 as industrial schools, preparing students for higher technical 
study, as well as for practical pursuits. This was found to be an error, 
and since 1876 the state has established 15 industrial secondary schools 
(2 in Vienna, 2 in Briinn, 2 in Pilsen, 1 in Salzburg, Graz, Innsbruck, 
Triest, Prague, Bielitz, Cracow, Czernowitz, and Reichenberg). These  
-P-A-G-E-220
  188 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
schools are organized into 8 industrial schools, with 1,725 students; 14 
schools for workmen, with 2,100 students; and 14 industrial continuation 
schools, with 3,474 students; and numerous special technical courses. 
These state schools form the centers for the organization of smaller 
and lower institutions, and have proved of inestimable value to the 
industrial life of the Austrian Empire. 
Switzerland has one secondary industrial school at Winterthur, which 
had, in 1885, 350 students. 
(21) Commercial schools.—The commercial schools, established chiefly 
by commercial societies and corporations, sometimes by private persons, 
but’ rarely by communities, give splendid testimony to the desire for 
education among commercial people. They are an effective means ~ 
against the increase of a commercial pauperism that is detrimental 
to the social and economic conditions of the state. Technical educa- 
tion flourishes more in the commercial than in any other pursuit. In 
Wiirtemberg it was ascertained that 12 per cent of all apprentices 
were commercial apprentices. Commercial schools are classified as 
continuation and apprentice schools with supplementary instruction 
that accompanies the practical work. Beside these, which are all 
evening or Sunday schools, there are commercial day schools with a 
course of two and three years. A formidable obstacle of many com- 
mercial schools is found in the insufficient preparation of their students, 
who, despite a full course of elementary education, are weak in orthog- 
raphy and grammar, so that instead of instruction in commercial busi- 
ness style, as the course of study announces, instruction in orthogra- 
phy, etymology, and punctuation is required, or, in other words, the 
elements have to betaught. Good commercial schools impart knowledge 
in a much more complete and systematic manner and in better scien- 
tific connection than practical work in any commercial business could 
give it, since the latter is always, and needs must be, restricted to a 
certain line of transactions. 
The Society of Commercial School Principals in Saxony, in 1881, pub- 
lished a sketch of the course of study for commercial schools. Accord- 
ing to that the most essential branches are commercial arithmetic, 
- bookkeeping, correspondence (with accounts), and commercial science; 
that is, the systematic presentation of the principles of commerce and 
its rules and regulations as derived from the laws of the state and 
political economy. ‘ : ; 
The tuition fees in most commercial schools are much higher than in 
industrial schools, the maximum being $90 a year (see also section 7). 
The cause of this is chiefly that the knowledge obtained in commer- 
cial schools (science of commerce, bookkeeping, accounts, arithmetic, 
correspondence, languages, knowledge of merchandise, banking, and 
penmanship) can be immediately applied in commercial life, and that the 
merchant does not suffer like the industrial man from a conflict of in- 
terests. This circumstance facilitates the establishment of commercial

schools. The oldest is the one at Gotha, founded in 1817 by Arnoldi, 
the founder of institutions for insurance in Gotha. The second was es- 
tablished in 1831 in Leipzig by the Merchants’ Guild. The imperial law 
regulating commerce and industry says, in section 154, that commercial 
apprentices under 18 years of age may be required to attend continua- 
tion schools. (See, also, section 6). 
Harry Schmitt established 165 commercial continuation schools in 
Germany, of which 48 were established before 1871, 117 since that time. 
According to his statement Saxony has 1 commercial school for every 
100,000 inhabitants; Baden 1 for every 150,000; Hessia 1 for every 
166,000; Wiirtemberg 1 for every 286,000; Prussia 1 ‘for every 368,000; 
Bavaria 1 for every 500,000. Bavaria has 8 commercial schools (3 of 
which are public), with 1,267 regular and 46 special students. Saxony, 4 
advanced commercial schools, with 993 students, two commercial courses 
of one year each, with 114 students, and 32 commercial apprentice 
schools, with 2,257 students; total, 3,364 students. Wiirtemberg has in 
nine cities commercial continuation schools, mostly special classes of in- 
dustrial schools. The polytechnica in Carlsruhe, in Brunswick, and in 
Vienna had originally commercial sections, but they were abandoned. 
The polytechnicum in Riga (in the German provinces of Russia) has a 
commercial section to this day. 
The number of hours a week is greatest in Dresden; then follow 
Leipzig, Chemnitz, Berlin, Munich, Stuttgart, Nuremberg, Plauen, 
Bautzen, in the order named. Austria maintains 12 secondary commer- 
cial schools, 28 lower schools of that kind, 59 independent commercial 
schools, and 18 connected with other day schools; together, 117 institu- 
tions for commercial education. 
(E.) INDUSTRIAL ART SCHOOLS, SOCIETIES, AND MUSEUMS. 
(22.) Industrial art schools and societies.—As a result of the World’s 
Expositions of 1851, 1855, and 1862 it was noticed, in England, 
Austria, and Germany, that industrial art in these countries, de- 
spite its technical perfection, was far inferior to that of France. It 
was recognized that the great advantage which Trance had over other 
countries was not owing to innate skill and taste, but to the gradually 
trained workmanship, which training had been going on ever since 
the latter part of the seventeenth century. The leading men came 
to the conclusion that this difference could only be overcome by 
instruction and good models. The South Kensington Museum (a mu- 
seum, school, and teachers’ training school combined), founded by the 
prince consort in 1857, with which numerous art schools and industrial 
museums in.smaller towns are closely connected, proved its wholesome 
influence as early as the London Exposition in 1862. It received be- 
tween 1861 and 1863 an annual appropriation of $170,000. France, in 
order not to be outdone, appropriated for its Conservatory of Arts and 
Trades the sum of $1,000,000 and an extra appropriation of $30,000 for 
   
-P-A-G-E-222
    190 : EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
purchases at the London Exposition. Upon the motion of von Hitel- 
berger Austria established in 1863 a museum for art and industry and 
in 1868 a school for industrial art. Later the various German states 
followed the example; in 1865 the Industrial Hall at Carlsruhe was 
opened; in 1867, the Museum of Industrial Art at Berlin and also the 
National Museum at Munich. 
The object of industrial art schools is to revive among industrial 
people the taste for art which was so great at the close of the Middle 
Ages, and also a comprehension of the demands of industrial art among 
artists. : 
The training of industrial men toward artistic perfection in their respective 
branches is the essential point, not the inoculation of art upon trades. (Stockbauer.) 
It should be insisted upon that only such students can be admitted 
as have practical shop experience. Since industrial art consists in 
the application of the laws of architecture, plastic art, and painting, to 
industrial products, the industrial art schools must foster these three 
branches particularly. These schools must have close contact with 
high art (a large artery can furnish blood for small vessels), but 
they must also, in order to act beneficially, have contact with technical 
institutions of which they formerly were a part. Yet their success 
demands that they be independent institutions, and not mere append- 
ages. (Roscher.) 
It has recently been urged that industrial art schools should, less 
than heretofore, foster the historic ornament, since that stimulates 
the student’s prejudice and deprives him of the liberty of creative 
power. Hence it is recommended, especially by M. Meurer, that indus- 
trial art should abandon the ancient traditions of artistic style and 
return to the original fountain of nature. The frequent change of style 
in modern industrial art, the constant experimentation with the artistic 
means of expression of all ages and nations, is mostly owing to neglect 
of the study of nature. Says M. von Schwind: 
Museums, with their bewildering multitude of objects, dig up the soil around the 
germinating power of creative genius, and influence it like fifty climates upon a plant 
that can stand only one. 
The numerous modern collections of models of style are poor text- 
books; they act like cribs in a classical school. Instead of “stable-feed- 
ing” with printed models, Meurer recommends the “ pasture-fodder” 
of nature. Too much originality in schools must not be encouraged 
either, forthe much admired industrial art of less gifted oriental peoples 
shows that an uninterrupted artistic tradition is an essential condition 
of perfection in industrial art. 
Prussia has industrial art schools in Berlin, Frankfort-on-the-Main, 
Diisseldorf, Cologne, Cassel, Hanau, Breslau, and the establishment of 
several others has been contemplated. Bavaria, Munich (1885, since 
1868 a state institution, has a woman’s department) and Nuremberg, both 
schools have 567 students. Saxony, Leipzig (1871), formerly an insig-

nificant art academy, now a flourishing art school devoted to the 
publishing trade, 207 students; Dresden (1875), 289 students; Plauen 
(1877), reorganized in 1890. Wiirtemberg, Stuttgart, 104 students; the 
industrial continuation schools of Wiirtemberg have, in places where 
a special industrial art predominates, shops for modeling, chasing, en- 
graving, and wood carving. Baden, Carlsruhe (1878), 224 students; 
Pforzheim (1877), 219 students. Hessia, Mayence (1865), Offenbach 
(1868), Austria, Vienna, 207 students; Prague, 243 students; Lem- 
berg, 182 students, besides a special school for photographic art in 
Vienna, 164 students. Switzerland has industrial art schools in Basel, 
Bern, Geneva (2), Lucerne, Zurich, and la Chaux-de-Fonds. 
German industrial art secieties combined to form a large union in 
1883. The most numerous of these societies are those in Munich, 
Pforzheim, Frankfort-on-the-Main, Carlsruhe, Stuttgart, Berlin, Old- 
enburg, and Dresden. 
(23). Industrial art museums, with libraries and collections of models 
for ornamentation, are necessary supplements to industrial art schools, 
whieh otherwise would remain mere drawing or modeling schools. 
Again, without industrial art schools the museums lose a great deal of 
their usefulness. . “In many cases the interest of the collectors who aim 
at completeness and rarities, and also the interest of the scientists and 
the historians who aim at a faithful representation of the past and its 
development, gained the upper hand over the practical purpose of such 
an institution, namely, the fostering of modern industrial art. _ By no. 
means should classical productions of the present time be excluded, 
lest the show windows on business streets would give more useful sug- 
gestions to workmen than the museums of industrial art. Printed 
labels and explanations attached to the objects in a museum are pre- 
ferable to catalogues, which soon get out of date. Printed guides 
should treat historic, archeologic, and ethnographic points of view 
less fully; the development of art in industry must at all times 
be considered the vital object. Therefore suggestions regarding the 
technique, and the dependence of ornament upon material, or the rela- 
tion between utility and ornament in industrial objects, is of much 
more importance than uncertain statements regarding time and placeof 
origin. Reference to models and to periodicals and books which may 
be found in the library connected with the museum, should be found 
-in close proximity to the objects displayed. The superintendents of 
many industrial art museums in Germany and Switzerland are em- 
powered to copy, for industrial art workers and other people, sketches, 
plans, and detailed drawings of objects contained in the museum.” 
(B.) TECHNICAL UNIVERSITIES OR POLYTECHNICA. 
(24) The German Empire has 9 polytechnica; Austria, 4; Switzer- 
land, 1; and German Russia, also 1. All of these institutions were 
founded during the nineteenth century. The Keole Polytechnique, in

Paris, was established in 1794. It was a preparatory institution for a 
small number of engineers of the military and civil service who received 
their higher training in special schools for artillery service, general staff 
of the army, and bridge and railroad building. Still inregard to time it 
is justly entitled to the distinction of being the oldest polytechnicum in 
theworld. Prague followed in 1806; Graz,in 1811; Vienna, in 1815; Ber- 
lin, in 1821; Carlsruhe, in 1825; Darmstadt, in 1826; Munich, in 1827; 
Dresden, in 1828; Stuttgart, in 1829; Hanover, in 1831; Briinn, in 
1850; Ziirich, in 1855; Brunswick, in 1862; Riga, in 1862; and Aachen 
(or Aix-la-Chapelle), in 1870. 
With the exception of Aachen, the German polytechnica have devel- 
oped from lower or secondary industrial schools. In ‘several of them 
(notably Berlin, Dresden, and Hanover) it was the intention originally 
to prepare skilled workmen and foremen for great building enterprises 
and factories. 
It was greatly to be regretted that the schools that were intended to 
prepare the students for the polytechnica, that is, the so-called Real- 
schulen, came into existence later. Saxony had, up to the year 1834, 
no secondary school like the Realschulen, and up to 1843 only one. The 
first Prussian Realschule was established in 1832 in Berlin. Not having 
proper preparatory schools, the polytechnica were obliged to admit 
their students with a very low standard of preparation. But the sudden 
expansion of the railroad system made it necessary to elevate the ob- 
jects of the polytechnica. The application of steam as a motive power 
made greater demands upon technical skill in the building of roads, 
bridges, locomotives, and machines. During antiquity bridges were 
rarely built with a span of more than 25 meters; during the middle 
ages spans of 50 meters were attempted, but the application of iron 
enabled bridge builders to go far beyond that. Lately bridges have 
been built that span 500 meters. To this must be added that’ in 
large cities the introduction of gas, water, and electricity gave a 
powerful impetus to technical education. As a pioneer in this tran- 
sitional period the Ecole Polytechnique at Paris laid stress upon the 
strict scientific study of mathematics and the natural sciences—the true 
bases of all the technical sciences. Vienna emphasized a combination of 
the technical sciences into an organically well-articulated unity. Carls- 
ruhe and Ziirich paid special attention to general culture and scientific 
investigation, raised their requirements for admission, and adopted the 
constitution of a university. The technical institutions in existence 
changed their constitutions and courses of study, and became poly- 
technica; thus Graz in 1864, Ziirich in 1866, Munich in 1868, Dresden 
in 1891, Darmstadt in 1877, Hanover in 1879. 
Their official name in Central Europe is technical universities. Dur- 
ing the years from 1877 to 1880 representatives of these various tech- 
nical universities (in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland) assembled 
and determined upon a uniform organization of these institutions.
-P-A-G-E-225
- INDUSTRIAL AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION IN EUROPE.   
This assembly agreed that the technical universities were to offer for 
technical pursuits the highest possible education required for state or 193 
         
communal service and industry, and to foster and promote the technical _ 
arts and sciences, Their curriculum was made to embrace four courses, 
architecture, civil engineering, mechanical engineering, and chemistry. 
The comprehensive term civil engineering embraces road-building (in- 
eluding railroads), surveying, hydraulics, and bridge-building. 
With the development of industrial schools into polytechnical uni- 
versities a decrease in the number of attendants was unavoidable. 
There is less demand for the highest talent than there is for men oft 2 
medium caliber. Instead of recognizing the decrease in attendance as 
a consequence of increased requirements for admission, a small number 
of teachers in these institutions try to raise the number of students by 
lowering these requirements, while the greater number of teachers con- 
sider this procedure a menace to the scientific results. If the proposi- 
tion of the former were adopted, the institutions would again become 
what they once were, universities and secondary schools ‘combined; 
that is, through the main portal would enter students well prepared, 
and through the back door, so-called special students with an inferior 
preparation. The number of such special students is comparatively 
small in-Austria and Saxony, while in Prussia it is very large. The 
university study of young men who are only prepared for secondary 
schools has great disadvantages, scientifical, economical, and so- 
cial. These students retard the progress of those better prepared 
than they, and are confronted with demands upon their own strength 
which they are unable to meet. Hence many of these special students 
enter industrial life with half-digested knowledge, but they are more 
pretentious even than thorough students. Indeed, these weaklings 
require a greater expenditure of time and money than good students. 
do, and that which they accomplish in after life is often faulty and 
inferior, all of which causes a crippling of German industry in the com- 
petition in the market of the world. Steinbeis says, “It must be 
regarded as a very lamentable fact that many students of technical 
universities have little or no practical skill or knowledge of industrial 
economy; therefore they may be made useful at the drawing board, 
but not for practical management and government.” Genauck points 
out the notable fact that few machine engineers who have gone through 
a technical university are managing factories or workshops on their 
own account, while many experienced engineers of much inferior theo- 
retical preparation fill responsible and remunerative positions, He also 
mentions the fact that theoretically educated architects are frequently 
found in the service of building masters of much inferior education. 
The Journal of the German Society of Engineers during the years 
from 1888 to 1891 points out the danger of students of insufficient prep- 
aration attending a technical university.

A fasion or combination of these technical universities with the old 
niversities for the learned professions has been frequently and emphat- 
ically urged, It has been said that such a fusion would make unneces- 
sary separate buildings, and do away with the necessity of duplicating 
certain appliances of instruction, such as libraries, botanical gardens, 
ical and physical laboratories, mmeralogical, geological, and arche- 
gical collections. W. Roscher urges this especially in the interest 
a unified national education, so that between the learned profes- 
‘ional men, theologians, lawyers, physicians, and teachers on the one 
hand, and the so-called practical men, agriculturists, en gineers, machin-— 
- ists, etc., on the other, no feeling of antagonism or disdain may arise.

During May, 1888, a special imperial cabinet was created; it has ad

eral governments, governments, and districts; in European Russi: 
there are 68 governments and 635 districts; in Asiatic Russia, 14 goy- _ 
ernments and 173 districts. Each general government has its governo:

affairs. A civil governor and a council of control in each government,

of local administrative affairs. In most of European Russia and

  as ‘the primary unit of organization being the “mir? or village commu- 
nity. There are 107,493 of these communities in European Russia. 
_ The affairs of the mir are discussed and regulated in general assembly 
_ of all the heads of families. Each mir elects its own elder, who is its 
“executive, but who has no authority except to carry out its decisions. 
The communes are united into cantons (voloste) which have an average 
of about 2,000 men each (in European Russia 9,533). Each canton is 
presided over by an elder elected at the cantonal assembly, which 
assembly is composed of the delegates of the village community in the 
proportion of one member to ten households. In Poland these as- 
semblies are composed of alllandholders, nobility included, police and 
clergy excluded. 4 
The economical affairs of government and district are administered to 
‘a certain extent by governmental and district assemblies—the so-called 
Zemstvos—which are composed of representatives elected by the peas- 
- ants, the householders in towns, and the landed proprietors. The 
Zemstvo supplements the acts of the rural community. It dates from 
1867, and was in force in 361 districts of 34 governments in 1886. In 
1890 there were important modifications introduced in these assemblies: 
the number of representatives was reduced, their powers were limited, 
“while the nobility received greater authority. In cities and towns 
there are municipal organizations with powers similar to those of the 
Zemstvo. 
Social distinctions are most marked in Russia; the nobility, the 
clergy, the merchants, and the peasants do not mingle together, 
but each class isolates itself in a measure from eyery other class, and 
each has its own educational institutions. Of the total population only 
- 79.89 per cent are Russians; 8.11 per cent belong to the Aryan races; 
_ 2.67 per cent to the Semitic races; 9.17 per cent to the Finnish and 
Tartar groups; 0.16 per cent to other races. The established religion 
is Greco-Russian, but all these races with different degrees of civiliza- 
tion have not adopted the same cult. The majority of the inhabitants 
in 1886 were orthodox-Catholics—the official title for the Greeco- 
Russian faith. The different religions were represented by the fol- 
lowing numbers: Orthodox-Catholics, 65,549,096; United Church 
and Armenians, 55,000; the Roman Catholics, 8,300,000; Protestants, 
2,950,000; Jews, 3,000,000; Mohammedans, 2,600,000; Pagans, 26,000; 
_ these estimates not including members of the army and navy. 
The vast extent of the Czar’s dominions, the diversity of nationalities 
and religions, plainly indicate the difficulties attendant upon the estab- 
lishment of an acceptable school system; and yet, notwithstanding the 
many different elements which combine to make up this great Empire, 
there is national as well as local effort to educate the people according 
to the needs of the different classes and according to the different con- 
ditions of life among the peasantry, the commercial and sacerdotal 
classes, and the landed proprietors and nobility.

  EDUCATION 3N RUSS 
THE SCHOOL SYSTEM, 
ESTABLISHMENT, 
The empire is divided for educational purposes into twelve circuits, - 
which are, through their curators,! under the direct charge of the min- — 
istry of education, although there are many special schools which 
depend upon the other administrative departments. é 
The school system throughout all its ramifications is an establish- 
ment of the State, for although the authorities at St. Petersburg do not 
establish all schools, they are cognizant of the plans adopted by the local 
authorities in regard to school organization. The educational system” 
is based upon a general plan which-received imperial sanction in 1862, 
and which received still greater force by an edict of May 25, 1874. 
According to these imperial edicts each parish is to have a school, and 
in cities there is to be a school for every 1,000 inhabitants, as about 50 
children between 8 and 10 years of age are found in that number of 
people. Education is compulsory in many provinces, except when the 
distance is too great or the weather too bad, but latitude is left to 
the zemstvos in determining the age at which children are required 
to attend school. . Under elementary instruction are included (1) the 
people’s schools (narodnoe-uchilis-ché) divided into parish and district 
schools, the first under the care of the State and intended for the — 
young children of the people; (2) the district schools (uyezdnoé-uchilis- 
      
ché) which are of higher elementary grade, one for each administrative _ 
district. These higher elementary grades are now fast being replaced 
by urban schools. All children are admitted to the elementary schools 
without distinction of creed or social conditions. If funds are lacking 
for separate schools for girls they may attend the boys’ schools. The 
authorities having the controlling influence over the schools may make 
them gratuitous or may require tuition fees. 
Below the elementary grades are infant and maternal schools, in which 
children between 3 and 10 years of age are received by the day. There 
are also asylums for orphans from 7 to 12 years of age in the large cities, 
especially in St. Petersburg and Moscow. Froebellian methods are em- 
ployed in some of the maternal schools and asylums. 
Generally speaking, education in the elementary grades is gratui- 
tous, not only in point of instruction but also as far as the purchase of 
text-books and school material is concerned. If the authorities decide 
to establish a school the zemstvo usually obtains certain State subsidies 
to aid in carrying iton. Schools differ greatly in different localities; 
but, in general, rural schools have only one class, with one or possibly 
two teachers, while city schools may have six classes, giving the pupil — 
a higher grade of elementary instruction than is given in the rural

   Pupils of the urban anon are ‘fitted to enter the service of: 1e 
Government without further examination. Those who have followed _ 
four years of the course are prepared to enter the gymnasia, The most 
frequented schools are those in charge of the zemstvos; next, those in — 
charge of the commune, then those under direct control of the ministry 
of public instruction. 
Private schools may be established, if authorized by the sehoal 
authorities, but they reserve the right ia close them if there is anything 
objectionable in their management. The individuals or communities 
which establish private schools indicate to the local school authorities 
what funds they intend to use for such purpose and the authorities des- 
ignate a person to administer such funds. 
In elementary grades the instruction of young girls is somewhat 
neglected, especially in rural districts. Protestants and Jews are most 
anxious to give their daughters an education in the different grades of 
society. The clergy take the first rank in point of educating their 
daughters; the merchants and citizens generally come next, and lastly — 
the peasants. Elementary education for girls of higher classes is gen- 
erally given at home; secondary grade instruction in institutes which 
are maintained by the Government, admission being granted according 
_ to the rank and official position of the father of the family. 
Grouped under elementary grades are the Sunday schools for adults, 
and, in localities where it is impossible to reach the permanent schools, 
“ambulatory schools are found which, as in Scandinavia, are moved to 
other places after a few weeks’ instruction. Ifthe pupils are not numer- 
ous, the children of both sexes are instructed together; when the num. 
- ber of pupils is large two school divisions are formed, the boys coming 
from 9 to 12 o’clock, the girls from 1 to 3 or 4 o’clock. In the territo- 
rial divisions which have a zemstvo, the schools are well looked after, 
but in other parts of Russia complaintis made of unsuitable buildings, 
lack of proper facilities for teaching, etc. 
The schools of the clergy, a class of schools entirely apart from the 
_ State elementary and secondary grades, rank well in point of attend- 
ance. These schools are free to the orthodox Catholies, but tuition fees 
-are charged to those of other faiths. The State elementary schools are 
open to all classes, but the people of birth and means prefer to have 
tutors and governesses at home, this being quite a popular phase of 
education in Russia. 
The State and the highest authorities are much interested in the 
establishment of technical and industrial schools,! the instruction to 
run in lines parallel to the secondary and primary grades. A special 
division-to take charge of these schools was created in 1883 in the min- 
istry of public instruction. The intermediate technical schools have

of instruction which, in literary matters, does not go beyond that o: 
elementary schools, and in addition aims to form artisans for domesti 
and village industries. To these regularly organized schools are joined 
special schools for adults—overseers, foremen, contractors, mechan 
cians, and printers—the classes for evenings and Sundays of the Tech. 
nical Society of St. Petersburg, and the industrial school of RB: 
Finally, the majority of schools of the districts and the urban schools, 
have subsidies for technical sections, $241,250 having been added to 
the budget of 1891 for the inauguration of that branch of instruction; 
a cousiderable portion of that sum being reserved, however, for th 
establishment of a technical division in district schools in villages” 
where there are village industries. A scheme for technical schools was 
Ranking numerically next: among the governmental schools are 
secondary schools (gymnasia, progymnasia, and Real schools), whic! 
are supported by State, city, zemstvo, private individuals, or by tw 
tion fees. The gymnasia date from the reign of Catherine I (1762-96 
A decree of 1804 converted most of the communal schools founded i 
Catherine’s reign into gymnasia; yet in reality secondary educati 
was not regularly organized. until the decree of December 8, 1828, 
promulgated. This decree was an outcome of a report made by a 
commission appointed on December 14, 1825, by Nicholas I, the aim of 
the commission being the formation: of a classical course, without 
Greek as an obligatory study. In order to enforce this idea it wi 
decided (1) that those who studied Greek should obtain admittance into 
the fourteenth grade of the hierarchic! scale established by Peter the 
Great in 1712; (2) that the entrance to the university at governmental 
expense should only be accorded to pupils who distinguished themselves 
in the study of Greek; (3) that knowledge of the language should be 
required of those seeking the degree of doctor. The -statutes of 
1828 contained the two last requirements, and added that those w!

classes have the title Highest Excellence, the fourth Excellence, from that to th

   distinguished themselves in the study of Greek should receive medals 
_ of gold or silver. This commission brought about a complete organi- 
zation of the gymnasia and aimed to give a very complete secondary 
education to those who did not wish to, or could not, finish their studies 
~ at the university. 
_ In 1849, instead of creating special schools, it was deemed advisable 
to make the studies of the gymnasia more practical, and in 1852 to add 
a course of natural sciences and mathematics, but the outcome of these 
innovations served to bring about a decadence in education in general, 
asin the universities, ecclesiastical academies, and gymnasia it was 
difficult. to find professors who could take charge of the various divi- 
: sions of study. In 1864 a new plan was inaugurated in the secondary 
schools, This made the ancient languages the basis of admittance to 
the university, elevated the standard of appointment of teachers, in- 
 spectors, and directors, abolished the division of higher and lower grade 
, masters (who ranked according to subjects taught), arranged salaries 
according to hours of instruction, limited the number of pupils in each 
class to 40, and prohibited the promotion of those who, after spending 
two years in a class, were not prepared for it. The statute also ex- 
_ tended the duties of educational councils, associated directors and in- 
_ spectors together, and brought the teachers and pupils more en rapport 
with each other. Authority was also given to form the four lower 
classes into progymnasia. While these reforms were important they 
were not the means of definitely organizing classical instruction, for 
_ new regulations, which are still in force, were drawn up in 1869 and 
modified in 1871. According to these regulations each government is 
to have one or more gymnasia in each important town or city where 
there seems to be need of such schools, these institutions to be exempted 
_ from taxation, to give general instruction above the elementary grade, 
and to act as preparatory schools for the universities and other special 
schools. The present regulation gives less time to the study of history, 
geography, and the Russian language, but more time to the classics. 
_ The gymnasia and progymnasia, founded according to the explicit 
_ directions of the minister of public instruction, are under the immediate 
_ jurisdiction of the curator of the school district. The expenditures are 
_ tobe paid by the State, certain societies, corporations, and private indi- 
viduals. In the Baltic provinces, by law of April 24, 1890, many second- 
_- ary schools were transformed to suit the plan of the Russian gymnasia. 
‘This is in accordance with a plan to more thoroughly Russianize these 
provinces, for hitherto the German influence has been particularly 
strong. This change and certain regulations as to the free exercise 
of the Protestant religion have caused much discontent, as have also 
the measures to limit the Ee methods and ieee in Dorpat

The Realschools, organized by imperial decree of May 12, 1872, aim 
to afford young men an education capable of immediate applica- 
tion, and to prepare them for the higher professional schools, This»

  EDUCATION IN RUSSIA. 
  preparation is brought about by devoting more time and attention to. ee 
the study of the mother tongue, mathematics, and natural sciences 
than in the classical schools. But on account of the general theoret- 
ical tone given to these branches a supplementary class has been formed — 
for the giving of more practical instruction. These schools have been 
found to be of such practical! use that there is hardly an important 
town-of Russia, Siberia, or Caucasus which is without its Realschool. 
The need of both technical and Realschools is felt throughout Russia, 
as the natural resources of the country are in a measure awaiting 
development, and to the graduate of the Realschool and of the tech- 
nical school, belongs this field of labor. In 1881 the zemstvos re; 
quested the admission of the Real students to the scientific faculties 
of the universities, and a commission was appointed to further this 
matter; but this plan was nevercarried out. Throughout the Empire 
the desire for secondary instruction is so great that excessive crowding 
is observable everywhere. . 
The Russian authorities show marked interest in the education of 
young women. The institutions for the secondary education of girls 
were up to the middle of this century quite exclusively reserved for — 
daughters of noble families. The Empress Catharine founded, in 1764, _ 
in the Convent of the Resurrection in St. Petersburg, a school for the 
education of young girls between 16 and 18 years of age, from the 
nobility and middle classes. The courses were gratuitous and extended — 
through a five-years-period. The widow of Paul I, Maria Feodoroyna, ~ 
also carried out this same idea, but the majority of the schools were 
only instituted for the daughters of noblemen. During the reignof 
Alexander II the Empress Maria Alexandrovna specially organized 
educational institutions for the middle classes, and the first gymnasia for 
girls were opened in Russia in 1858. These institutions were all for 
day pupils, so that pupils could have the advantage of being with their 
families and yet receive a complete education. The Empress was pa- 
troness of these schools and the curator of the school district had imme- 
diate jurisdiction over them. Each gymnasium had two councils, one 
an administrative, the other a pedagogical council. The directress of the 
gymnasium was appointed by the curators, and that appointment was 
confirmed by the minister of public instruction. The council of admin- ~ 
istration, composed of persons of both sexes chosen by the corporations 
and societies which support the schools, had for its duties—(1) to choose - 
a curatrice and directress, (2) to examine as to the requisite resources, 
(3) to watch over the budget of expenditures, (4) to regulate the 
employ of amounts allowed to the school, (5) to limit the tuition fees, 
which should be less in the progymnasia than in the gymnasia, (6) to 
indicate when there should be exemption from school fees, (7) to decide 
as to the aid to be given to meritorious but needy students, and (8) to   
1It is stated, however, that the number of studies required produces a-certain 
superficiality among the students, so that they do not find stzady employment after 
graduation.

     ave the general charge of the institution. The pedagogical council 
(composed of the director of the boys’ gymnasia or Real school, the — 
directress and all other officials of the girls’ school) chooses the teach: 
rs, both the men and women, and it is left to the curators of the school 
istriets to confirm them in their functions. In,the three classes of the 
progymnasia and the three lower classes of the gymnasia the instruc- 
tion is given by women teachers. : 
_A large number of girls are trained in the state institutions, of which 
here are 8 at St. Petersburg and 6 at Moscow, and 20 in different ~pro- 
vincial towns. Admission to these is dependent upon the rank and 
Official position of the father: In one the highest aristocracy are ad- 
“mitted, and_so on down.to the daughters of the clergy and of citizens. 
The iatiolt= of the studies is six years. Other establishments for 
young women, also under the supervision of the minister of public 
Sy struction, are open to all young girls, irrespective of rank. They 
are, with the exception of certain modifications in the instruction, 
completely parallel to the establishment for boys. 
For the training of teachers permission was given by the authorities 
in 1871 to establish a class of training schools, so that persons desiring 
to adopt that profession might be properly instructed in their duties. 
These schools are divided into institutes and pedagogical seminaries. 
‘The former train teachers for the higher, the latter for the lower ele- 
mentary grades. There are also pedagogical training schools for 
eachers of infant and maternal schools, which will be described under 
appropriate headings. 
The universities are of comparatively recent origin, dating from the - 
18th and 19th centuries. Their first real vitality was due to Alexander 
I (1801-1825), who greatly favored the establishment of institutions for 
higher study, and, indeed, himself founded the universities of Kharkof, 
_ Kazan, and St. Petersburg, and restored those of Dorpat and Helsing- 
- fors, all of which have a high standard of instruction. The complete 
university is composed of four faculties: History and philosophy, physi- 
eal sciences and mathematics, law, and medicine. All the universities 
_ do not possess the full faculties. The universities of St. Petersburg, 
_ Moscow, Kief, Kharkof, Odessa, and Kazan rank about equally in this 
matter. Dorpat has been under German influence, but is now being 
Russianized. _Helsingfors has a special constitution ofits own. Varso- 
_ via is a Catholic center, and at Tomsk, in northwestern Siberia, an in-   
1Students of the Jewish religion are admitted to the Imperial University at Tomsk 
(circular of rector of the university of June 3, 1892) in such a proportion that their 
numbers do not exceed 5 per cent of the students. Preference is given to those who 
have completed a gymnasial course in Siberia. In the University of St. Petersburg 
only 3 per cent of the students are to be Jews, by regulation made in the year 
1890-91. Inthe schools throughout the Empire 10 per cent of the pupils may be 
Jews, or 5 per cent where they are not considered as permanent settlers. In large 
cities like Moscow and St. Petersburg about 8 per cent are admitted to the publio 
‘schools. The Jewish people have, however, their own schools, wherein their chil- 
dren show themselves to be studious and intelligent. ~

grade above the gymnasia but of a lesser degree than the university. 
Information in regard to these schools is presented under the heading 
“Courses of study.” Special schools, most of which are establishments 
of the State, such as polytechnic schools, forestry schools, schools fe 
veterinary surgery, for the study of mining, bridge and road making, 
serve to complete a school system which leaves no grade of educatio: 
untouched. Military schools also have an important part-in the school 
system. The pupils enter at 10 years of age into one of the one hundred. 
or more military schools in the Empire, follow a seyen years’ course, 
- which is free of charge to most of them, and are then ready to enter for 
a two or three years’ course in one of the six special military schools of 
higher grade. The naval cadet school, dating from Peter the Great’s 
reign, and the naval academy educate for the naval service in a six 
years’ course in the former and a two years’ course in-the latter schoo: 
STATE CONTROL, ee 
The Czar, as stated above, has the supreme. control of all legistagine 
executive, and judicial matters throughout the Empire, consequently he 
is the highest school authority. But acting as his aids are many offi- 
cials who have more direct charge of educational affairs, among them 
the ministers, all of whom communicate directly with their sovereign, 
so that the control of the various grades is vested in the different min- 
isters of the Government. 
The minister of public instruction with a deputy, who takes his place 
in case of absence, and his scientific council, composed of well known 
specialists, form the highest legislative and administrative body for 
educational purposes. The scientific council has as one of its duties 
the selection of text-books, the list of which is submitted to the minister 
annually, and, if approved by him, is. published. 
The greater opera of educational institutions are under the dire 
tion of the ministry of public instruction, but the Holy Synod has a num- 
ber of people’s schools of both elementary and secondary grades, which 
have a separate organization from the Government schools. Then there 
is a complete system of schools attached to the ministry of war. This 
class of schools includes military academies; schools of civil engineer 
ing and artillery; cadet schools and military gymnasia for the sons of 
officers; schools for engineers and subofficers who voluntarily enter the 
service and aspire to attain the rank of officer; and topographical and 
pyrotechnic schools, These schools are only accessible to the sons of 
‘officers and to young officers. Controlled by the same ministry are 
schools to form the corps of pages to which are admitted the sons at

      grandsons of generals only; the school of law, with a seven years’ course 
exclusive of the preparatory classes; and the imperial lyceums of St. 
Petersburg and Moscow. In the first of these establishments persons 
are trained to be higher officers; in the second for the magistracy; in 
_ the others as administrative officers. These schools are reserved for the 
sons of high civil and military authorities or of noble families. Con- 
_ nected with the ministry of the navy and the ministry of public works 
~and railways are many technical schools of both elementary and second- 
ary grade. Such schools are divided into those for the nobility and for 
~ persons who are not of noble extraction. The ministry of the imperial 
house has charge of schools which serve to train young persons for the 
dramatic profession. Both special and general instruction is given to 
this elass of students, the study of three languages, dancing, dramatic 
a art, and singing being included in the course. Still other ministers have 
charge of higher and secondary schools for the children of persons em- 
_ ployed in such ministries. The minister of public instruction is repre- 
sented in each of the educational districts by a curator, who is appointed 
€ by the minister. Subordinated to the curator are the inspectors of pro- 
 vinees and districts designated by himself. The jurisdiction of these 
fanctionaries extends over all branches of instruction, even to the uni- 
versities, and through these officials the Czar is adviséd as to the 
- educational movements trauspiring throughout his domains. 
LOCAL CONTROL. 
In each of the provinces where there is a provincial assembly or 
~ zemstyo the schools are under the control of a school council, presided 
over by the archbishop, of which the governor of the province is mem- 
det ex officio. These councils are independent of the ministry and 
have no regular communication with the department except when com- 
plaints are made or illegal acts done. In the provinces or governments 
where there is no zemstvo there are neither school councils nor inspect- 
ors, but the directors of the gymnasia have, at least nominally, the 
surveillance of elementary grades. The Holy Synod has direct control 
of the parochial schools organized by law of July 13, 1884, all of which 
depend upon the clergy. The administrative officers of the different 
classes of schools will be found under the heading, “Supervision and 
administration.” The Grand Duchy of Finland has its own special 
school administration (see Report of the Commissioner of Education 
for 188889, vol. 1, pp. 222-235). 
: £ MAINTENANCE, 
Russia’s rule is that of absolutism, and yet the peasant class, even 
_when its members were serfs, had a sort of republican organization. 
“Individual rights are a new thing, however, and have only existed since 
the abolition of serfdom. Each commune has its own form of organiza- 
tion; and when a school is to be created the members of the commune 
_ assemble together as a whole and vote the funds for such purpose; that 
_ is, such a vote is taken in case there is no territorial assembly or zemstyo.

EDUCATION| IN RUSSIA. 
  The davelopmahd of élementary education is sae and the govern- 
mental authorities at St. Petersburg only participate in a most lim- 
ited degree in the formation and maintenance of schools, as they lean ~ 
voluntarily upon the zemstvos and upon the municipalities and private _ 
associations scattered throughout the Empire, yet the school system 
has marked uniformity throughout the length and breadth of Russia, 
and the organization is as complete as though all educational institu- 
tions were founded and supported by the Government. As to any 
modifications of this general rule it may be observed that, according to— 
an imperial decree of May 25, 1874, which sums up all previous decrees, 
elementary schools are to be maintained by the State (in a limited de- 
gree) by the zemstvos, by the communes, and by private associations. 
When the zemstvo decides to create a school, however, it expects a 
subsidy from the State and also pecuniary aid from the commune, both ~ 
of which it usually obtains (in 1890 the zemstvos maintained no. less 
than 22,000 schools), but the main cost of. village schools.is paid by the 
zemstvos; still, in the school district of Odessa the communes expended. 
two and one-half times as much as the zemstvo. The Holy Synod sup- 
ports a number of schools of both elementary and secondary grades, 
which are open to children of all religions, the Orthodox-Catholies + 
receiving free instruction, those of other faiths paying school fees. 
Secondary schools are maintained by the State, which contributes 52. 
per cent of the aggregate expenditure of the gymnasia, progymnasia, 
and technical schools; the remainder of the amount needed to main- 
tain such schools Bene made up by fees (about 30 per cent) and by | 
donations from the zemstvos and municipalities. Cossack schools, of | 
all grades, for boys and girls are maintained by the separate voiskos, 
which, however, maintain a number of their pupils in the govern- 
mental schools. The State maintains institutes of a secondary char- 
acter for girls. These are the so-called Empress Marie institutions, the 
expenditures of which are paid by the ministry of finance. The uni- 
versities are maintained in part by the State and in part through the 
funds accruing from tuition fees, donations, ete. 
Summarizing in a few words, it may be stated that the Government 
at St. Petersburg is thoroughly in accord with the local authorities in 
the matter of establishment, control, and maintenance of schools 
throughout the various divisions of Russia. While much is left to 
local authorities, yet is it noticeable that all grades of schools are in a 
measure subordinated to regulations emanating from the seat of Gov- 
ernment, the Ozar and his ministers being fully cognizant of all branches 
of the public service, and the divers school officials being either in 
direct or indirect communication with the central authorities. 
STATISTICS, 
The total number of pupils in the schools of the Empire, exclusive of 
Finland, was estimated, in 1887-88, to be 2,472,627—boys, 1,944,057; 
girls, 527,570. These figures are not complete, but it seems that only

The longed of Aenool year is abe specified for the Actos of elementary. ze 
grade, but a general statement is made that the common schools are ~ 
never closed, except for the summer holidays, 4. @., from May 25 to - 
August 20, on Sundays and other public holidays. It was also resolved 
_ at the congress for technical and industrial instruction, held in St. 
Petersburg in 1891, ‘that tuition shall go on during at least ten 
months in the year.” This would naturally mean a continuance of all 
schools in which there is to be technical training during all but two 
months of the year. In the secondary schools, or gymnasia, the school 
term is from August 16, or thereabouts, to about the middle of June. 
The holidays include a Sortaleht at Christmastide, the same at Easter, 
sixteen church holidays, and Sundays. 
The ages of pupils throughout the different grades of schools are aoe 
definitely stated, but the city schools are, generally speaking, for pupils 
_ between 7 and 12 years of age. The same limit of age is oreo tia in 
_ the asylums; in the maternal schools children enter as early as 3 years 
_ ofage. At 10 years boys are presumed to be prepared for the gym- 
nasia, and from 10 to 11 years of age girls enter the institutes. In the 
military schools instruction commences with the tenth year. The gym-_ 
-_-nasial student is supposed to be prepared for entrance into the uni- 
_versity at 18 years of age.      
     
   
      
    
   
   
   
   
    
       
    
    FINANCE. 
INCOME, 
The income for educational purposes is derived from governmental 
subsidies, provincial and communal funds, which are made up in part 
from proportionate taxes upon personal property, and from an income 
tax. In the communes the taxes are levied by the communal authori-. 
ties according to estimates presented to the higher authorities. To this 
may be added a supplementary tax of 10 per cent to form a provincial 
- school fund. ‘The village schools only figure for a comparatively small 
-amount in the governmental budget, as the different local authorities 
are presumed to raise a sufficient income for the proper maintenance of 
such schools. The communal societies of towns or villages establish 
schools without government subsidy. City or village societies which 
desire to establish peoples’ schools engage themselves, either by muni- 
cipal or communal decision, to guarantee the existence of such schools. 
_ Private individuals can also open schools if they will observe the con- 
ditions! upon which such schools are usually established, a simple dee- 
~ Jaration to the authorities being all that is at first requisite. 
The funds for the secondary schools are contributed by the state to 
the amount of 52 per cent of the aggregate expenditure for the gym- 
_ nasia, progymnasia, and technical schools, the remainder being made | 
up by fees (about 30 per cent) and by grants from the zemstvos, the 
~ municipalities, ete. The Cossack schools, both for boys and girls, are

in 1888 were 2,720,123 rubles ($1,582,231). The church contributed the — 
sum of 725,252 rubles ($419,195) in 1887 and 1,645,681 rubles ($951, sa 
in 1888, 
The governmental authorities being desirous of attracting students 
to the university give at least $138,500 annually as scholarships, dona- 
tions to needy students, and general aid where most needed. This” 
amount is often increased to about $279,000 from other sources. The 
budget of the ministry of public instruction contributes about 3,500,000 
rubles, or $1,953,000 annually for the universities. In order to develop 
the technical schools, especially that division of district and urban 
schools which tends to instruct in village industries, the Government 
added a fund of $64,818 to the budget for 1891, but a considerable portion __ 
of that sum was set aside for the industrial cae of district schools. 
EXPENDITURE. 
The expenditures of the Government for education are not explicitly 
given for a late date; the actual ordinary expenditure included in the 
budget of the ministry of public instruction in 1891 was 22,935,781 
rubles, or $12,798,165. The aggregate expenses of the zemstvos in 1887 
was 44,131,775 rubles ($24,669,530), of which 17 per cent was spent for — 
education, 4. ¢., $4,193,810. The latest expenditures which can be given 
in detail, and which serve to show how the funds of the different minis-

   It svi be observed that the aaniery of public instruction Sate ex- 
pends about 4,500,000 rubles more for education than do all the other 
departments together for such purpose. Of the amount paid out for 
_ education the Government only accords to the village schools a sub- 
‘sidy of about 14 per cent of the whole amount. * The state maintains 
only one school for 9.078 inhabitants in the provinces where there is no 
zemstvo, one for 44,555 inhabitants in those provinces which have a 
zemstvo, and one for 163.116 inhabitants in the Baltic provinces, so 
that it will easily be understood that the zemstvos, or provincial assem- 
plies, have the principal maintenance of the public schools. The aver- 
age expenditures of the zemstvos is 65.5 per.cent. of the whole amount 
expended on the schools, but these expenditures increase from year to 
year. The governments where there is no zemstvo furnish about 69 
per cent of the total funds for education. 
SUPERVISION AND ADMINISTRATION, . 
STATE SUPERVISION. 
The educational institutions of Russia are under both state and local 
control. The supreme control is vested in the Czar, who, by means of 
the information imparted to him by his cabinet! and other officials hay- 
. ing schools under their charge, and by means of the functionaries who 
report to the minister of public instruction, is able to extend his knowl 
edge to all branches of the school system throughout the Empire. The 
ministry of public instruction, which is the central authority for the 
greater proportion of schools is divided into three sections—administra- 
tion, education, and learned societies. The second section, with which 
this account alone deals, is presided over by the minister or in case of. 
his absence by an official who acts as his deputy. A scientific council 
acts as aid to the minister; its duties include the final adjustment of 
_ questions pertaining to elementary instruction, the giving of advice in 
regard to text-books, and the publishing of an annual list of books 
authorized by the minister. These books are of two kinds—manuals, 
employed ordinarily, and auxiliary works, which teachers may need 
from time to time. Connected with the ministry is a commission 
charged with the examination of candidates of both sexes who may be 
_ desirous of obtaining a diploma giving them the right to teach without 
haying passed through the training schools, graduation from which 
gives such right. Since 1883 a special division for technical and in- 
dustrial schools has been created in this ministry. 
The twelve educational circuits into which the Empire is divided, i. e. =) 
St. Petersburg, Moscow, Dorpat, Kief, Varsovia, Kazan, Kharkof, 
Vilna, Odessa, Caucasus, Orenburg and western Siberia, have each 
a curator in charge, whois appointed by the minister of public instrue- 
tion. The curator is assisted by one or more provincial or district 
inspectors, whom he appoints as his aids. In St. Petersburg there are

    four inspectors, each in charge of a separate class of schools. 
educational cireuit may include several provinces. The curator h 
general supervision of city schools and of normal schools, even appoint- 
ing the directors of the latter. The jurisdiction of the curator and © 
governmental inspector extends over all educational institutions of the 
circuit, even to the universities. Since 1885 the inspector is vested — 
with a part of the rights which were formerly held by the rector of the 
university. The inspectors are required to visit public and private 
educational institutions quite frequently and to furnish reports of their 
observations, Such functions are not to be conferred upon the clergy. 
LOCAL SUPERVISION, 
In each of the provinces where there is a provincial assembly, or 
zemstvo, the schools are under the eharge of school councils presided — 
over by the archbishop, and of which council the governor of the district _ 
isamember. These councils donot report directly to the minister except 
in sueli extreme case as an illegal act. In the provinces where thereis 
no zemstvo there are neither school councils nor inspectors. In such 
ease the directors of the gymnasia have general control of the schools, 
The school council of the district—there are from five to twelve 
districts in aprovince—is composed of twomembers of the district admin- 
istrative council and of representatives of societies which have founded — 
schools or are patrons of schools. The members are appointed by the 
minister of public instruction, by the erthodox ecclesiastical authorities, 
and by the provincial school council. The district council! looks after 
primary education, its members visiting the schools; encourages the 
establishing of new schools and the amelioration of the condition of 
those which exist; attends to the furnishing of school material; proposes 
to the provincial council that certain schools be suspended if they are — 
prejudicial to the public welfare; delivers certificates to teachers, both 
men and women, and ‘indicates which members of the teaching force — 
should be ened or promoted; furnishes annual reports of the 
schools of the district to the provincial school eouncils, and through a 
them to still higher educational authorities. he 
The provincial school council is composed of the head of the diocese, 
the president, the governor, the school director, and two members of the 
ince rate provincial council. The curator of the educational cir- 
cuit takes part at the session of the council.? The provincial school 
council exercises a higher grade of supervision than the district council.   
1J¢ is stated (see Russia under the Czars) that on June 12, 1884, a law was passed 
which abolished school councils and transferred all their powers to the bishops and   
for years, and as references are sometimes made to such councils in different parts of — 
the Empire, it is surmised that the council may still exist in certain localities, and : 
hence its duties are here inserted. 
2Other statements give the fullest control of school matters to the curator and 
place the council in the position of an advisory council only,
-P-A-G-E-244
    It examines the reports of the district council and gives its decisions 
upon mooted questions, indicates what teachers merit subsidies from 
_ the Government, appoints such school patrons as it deems fit to hold a 
_ position on the district school council, and holds its reunions whenever 
affairs require it. 
The parochial schools established by the cataned clergy by decree , 
of June 14, 1864, are under the jurisdiction of school councils, even as 
were the Bienen ary grades. Butas the reports concerning such schools 
were presented to the Holy Synod -by the diocesan aetioriiess it was 
decided by decree of April 3, 1870, that all reports concerning both 
parochial and general elementary ecole should be addressed exclu- 
sively to the minister of public instruction. A reorganization, however, 
of the parochial schools (by law of July 13, 1884) placed these schools 
under direct control of the Holy Synod, which forms its own programme, 
with religion as a basis of instruction. 
Each city school is placed under the direct control of a surveillant or 
inspector appointed for three years by the general inspectors, or by the 
zemstyo, or by the municipality if either of the last-mentioned authori- 
ties maintains the school. The school director takes the title of in- 
spector if there are three or more classes connected with the school. 
po the personnel of the school forms, with the director as presiding officer, 
a pedagogical council, which holds meetings at least once aSmonth. 
Hach institution for secondary education has a director or directress 
in charge, and several inspectors or inspectresses.. The directresses 
of institutes are sometimes persons who are not educators, but, if direct- 
ors and directresses of gymnasia, they must belong to the teaching 
profession. In the institutes and gymnasia for girls there are the so- 
called dames de classe, each one of whom for a 24-hours period looks after 
the discipline and good order of the pupils. These ladies are chesen from 
persons of different nationalities, so that each may converse with the 
pupils in her native tongue. They attend the lessons given by the 
teachers, see that the tasks of each pupil are correctly performed, and 
the teachers’ exposition understood. In the secondary schools for boys 
‘similar positions are held by so-called governors. The governor and 
— dames de classe take charge of the lowest class on its entrance into the 
school and continue with it to the close of the school course. The direct- 
ors, inspectors, teachers, governors, etc., unite together whenever there 
is any question appertaining to their special institutions to be decided. 
At the end of the year the higher school authorities are requested to 
be present at the closing ceremonies of the school when awards are 
made to those worthy of such recompense. <A special division of the 
ministry of public instruction has charge of professional and technical 
schools, which schools have courses parallel to secondary aud elemen- 
tary grades. 
A law of August 23, 1884, changed the supervision and administra- 
tion of the universities. Prior to that date the rectors were elected by 
 
-P-A-G-E-245
  _ EDUCATION IN RUSSIA. _ 
the professors, and the dean of each faculty by its colleagues. The _ 
rector is now appointed by the Ozar, the deans by the minister. When — 
achair becomes vacant the minister fills it either by choosing an incum- 
bent himself or by authorizing the university to designate a candidate 
and to propose his confirmation. The university council has jurisdie- 
tion over any infringement of the rules by the students; it confers de- 
grees, distributes prizes, regulates programmes, etc. The curator del- 
egates a person to act as inspector of the university of his educational 
district, and designates certain assistants to act as his aids. Such 
is the system of supervision throughout the Russian dominions’ The 
complaint is often made that there is too much authority, for, in addition 
to the numerous officials mentioned above, there are also many petty 
officials who report the slightest infringement to the nearest educa- 
tional officer, and he in turn draws up a statement to be sent to the cen- 
tral authorities. 
TEACHERS, 
PREPARATION. 
In order to prepare persons to-undertake the proper instruction of 
children, Catherine IT created, in 1783, a people’s higher school, which 
was soon after converted into a teachers’ seminary, and which from 
1786 to 1801 trained about 425 teachers for such purpose. Reor- 
ganized in 1803 under the name of gymnasia for teachers, it was 
attached to the central pedagogical institute in St. Petersburg. This 
plan was, however, not successful, and in 1828 a training school for 
teachers of the Baltic provinces was established under governmental 
auspices, and in 1864 a second school for the northwest provinces was 
established at Molodetchno in the government of Vilna. In other parts 
of the Empire pedagogical courses were considered sufficient prepara- 
tion for teachers until in 1869, when a third training school was opened at 
Kief, and a fourth at Riga in 1870. Since 1871 persons who are to _ 
become teachers in elementary grades are generally instructed in peda- 
gogical institutes or pedagogical seminaries, which last are nonreligious 
in character, and, in fact, so neglect religion that the minister of public 
instruction proposes to bring about a reform in this matter. In the 
pedagogical institutes teachers are trained for the higher elementary 
grades. The students consist of persons who are at least 16 years of 
age, and who have been successful in their studies in the elementary 
grades, and have spent one year acting as assistant teacher. The 
course of study in the institutes is of three years, and graduates there- 
from hold a tenth rank in the civil hierarchy. Such institutes are 
found in St. Petersburg, Moscow, Glonkhovy, Vilna, Theodosia, Jitomir, 
Tiflis, Kazan, Bielgorod, and Orenburg. A diploma from a training 
school is obligatory for persons who desire to teach in city schools, 
The pedagogical seminaries are for the preparation of teachers for the 
lower elementary grades. They admit persons from 18 to 22 years of

      age who are exempt from mit service. Those Ae receive state 
~ subsidies to aid them through the course are pledged to serve at lease 
four years as teachers in elementary grades. There are eighty-nine of 
these seminaries in towns of second and third rank, and even in villages 
in different parts of Russia. 
In Moscow there is also a pedagogical seminary for girls, of at least 15 
“years of age, who are familiar with the elementary branches. The 
courseis of four years, at the end of which they are prepared to teach 
in the higher elementary schools. Many of the women teachers in ele- 
mentary grades are graduated from secondary schools. In St. Peters- 
_ burg and Moscow there are also training schools for teachers of 
infant and maternal schools. ‘There are no special institutions prepar- 
ing persons to hold professorships in the higher educational institu- 
tions. The professors in these institutes must all have degrees accorded 
to them in the universities where they must have passed through the 
different phases of student, candidate, magister, and doctor, according 
as they have fulfilled required conditions and duly discussed written 
theses. There are numerous institutions for persons desiring to become 
teachers in secondary grade schools. They are generally private board- 
ing schools, the students of which receive a small subsidy for the pay- 
ment of expenses. 
These conditions require that they agree to-serve the state by teach- 
ing for four, five, or six years, according to the amount which they have 
received. rein the government funds. Connected with the ministry of 
war are similar institutions for training, with three-year courses; con- 
nected with the ministry of the interior are such schools for the study 
of Oriental languages. The Historico-Philological Institute of St. 
‘Petersburg, opened in 1867, makes a specialty of thorough study in the 
classics, and in a four-years’ course trains teachers in the Slavonic and 
ancient languages and literature. To enter this institute the comple- 
tion of gymuasial studies is requisite; its students are preparing them- 
selves to teach in the secondary schools, i. e., gymnasia, progymnasia, and 
real schools. Pedagogical courses at St. Petersburg, of three years in 
duration (which include the history of the literature of three languages) 
_ train young women as teachers, in reality reviewing the studies which 
they have had in secondary schools (institutes or gymnasia). These 
courses are for day pupils and the students have opportunities for prac- 
tice-teaching. French classes are also formed in the provinces for those 
who wish to make a specialty of French instruction. Young women 
are admitted who have obtained the highest awards in the provin- 
cial institutes. Instruction is given in French in a two-years’ course, 
and the students agree to give six years’ service as teachers provided 
to teachers connected with the universities, with the academies of fine 
arts, ete. In the universities there are also privat docenten, who receive 
_ pay from the State, and tutors who teach modern languages and liter- they do not marry in the meantime. The title of professor is given only. 
 
-P-A-G-E-247
           ature. In the elementary and secondary oe of schools the title of 
teacher, outchiteli, is the only ene given. 2 
Teachers? institutes, or pedagogical conferences, occur “periodically, 
and'the teachers gather together for the exchange of thought respect 
ing methods of instruction, questions of pedagogy and discipline, and — 
the discussions also pertain to instruction in language, arithmetic, nat- 
ural history, singing, drawing, choice of best books, and the most effi 
cacious methods of instruction to be employed throughout the school — 
course. Papersare read by those present, and especially by the women 
teachers from elementary schools. The Russian Government endeavors 
in every way to facilitate the holding of these conferences. As far back 
as 1872 such conferences were held, with the consent of the minister of 
public instruction, in forty-seven divisions of the different governments, 
under the direction of thoronghly trained pedagogues; who in turn were | 
supervised by the inspectors of elementary schools; the expenses of such 
institutes were borne by the provinces.     
   
    
    
             
                                    
    
   
   EXAMINATIONS. ” 
A commission connected with the ministry of public instruction has 
the charge of examining candidates of both sexes who desire to obtain 
permission to teach without being graduates of training schools. In_ 
order to be admitted to teach in the governmental schools a diplomais 
requisite. Of the two kinds of diplomas the one entitles to give lessons 
in private schools, the other in public schools. The first is generally 
a certificate given at close of the courses for young women who have 
been successful in passing the final examination. The other is only 
given by the commission appointed for examination of persons desiring 
to teach. Strangers who come to Russia, with the express purpose of 
teaching, are obliged to be examined by the commission, no matter 
what diplomas they may have received in other countries. This rigor- 
ous measure was necessitated by the fact that bogus diplomas were given | 
in certain countries. Foreign candidates are required to be sufficiently 
familiar with Latin to write a short composition and also to translate a 
simple Latin text into Russian. Strangers are also admitted to examina- 
tions, the passing of which authorizes them to instruct in history and 
geography in institutes and boarding schools. Young women who 
desire to give home education receive a diploma for such teaching, after 
passing an examination in the Governmental institutions where they 
have been under instruction. In St. Petersburg, Moscow, and twent 
six other capitals there are special secondary schools for young women 
belonging to the families of the clergy; which schools, in a six years’ 
course, prepare graduates to receive diplomas giving them the right to 
teach in families. It is stated that of the present teaching staff, one. 
third have received a superior education in the middle class schools 
and seminaries, about one-third hold certificates from the training 
schools, and the remainder are persons of less educational training.

        EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
APPOINTMENT. 
The curator in each government attends to the appointment of 
teachers in the gymnasia and scientific schools in that section. The 
inspector authorizes the appointment of teachers in the elementary 
grades, dismisses the teacher if not satisfactory to him, closes the 
school, modifies the curriculum, etc. In the schools carried on by the 
clergy, teachers are permitted to hold position through lettres Wobédi- 
ence given by the bishop. Rectors of universities were formerly elected 
by the professors; but since 1884 the Ozar appoints the rector, who is 
generally selected by the minister of public instruction from one of 
three candidates chosen from among the professors. The dean of each 
faculty is no longer elected by his colleagues, but is appointed by the 
minister. The professors are selected by vote, but the minister ap- 
points them. 
SALARIES, 
In the elementary grades the position of a teacher is not as precarious 
as one might surmise. In.the primary schools of rural districts the 
' salaries vary from $92 to $277, but for more than half of the teachers 
the salary ranges below $231. Ordinarily the teachers are provided 
with lodging and garden, but sometimes they are most poorly housed 
in one room or even a corner of aroom. In urban and district schools 
teachers have lodgings, and their emoluments reach from $386 to $482. 
-Women teachers have equal privileges with the men, and in many 
localities they greatly preponderate in numbers. In the progymnasia 
for girls the salaries rank from $669 for the school inspector and $502 
for the mistress in charge—free lodging being included in both cases— 
to $223 for the dames-de-classe, or class ladies. In the institutes for 
girls, the lady directress receives $1,953 with lodging; the assistant 
teachers, $1,004. In training schools a few years ago the directors 
_ received $1,116 and certain privileges or fees; the teachers, from $223 
to $669. The emoluments in the gymnasia were from $1,116, with free 
lodgings, for the director, to $413 for each master. The master gives 
twelve lessons each.week, and at the end of fifteen years his salary 
is increased by regular gradation to $837. 
PENSIONS, 
All persons holding the position of teacher under state authority are 
considered as entitled to an annual pension after a certain number of 
years’ service. Many of the school functionaries in the country dis- 
tricts are not considered as employés of the state, and consequently 
_ are not entitled to pensions, and, up to a late date, not even the most 
modest pension was accorded to women teachers. In district and 
urban schools teachers receive a pension of from $231 to $277. A 
director of a gymnasia would receive about $446 as his share after 
giving the requisite service to the Government. 
~ By very early laws teachers who are recognized by the minister of 
public instruction as being in the service are presumed to be able 
4
-P-A-G-E-249
    to fulfill the functions for twenty-five years and are then entitled to. 
a pension, but if they are still equal to the requirements of their posi- 
tion, they can occupy the place for five years longer, receiving during 
the latter period both salary and pension. Another five years’ period 
of teaching is also allowable with an addition of one-fifth to the pen- — 
sion. A professor, according to law of 1835, receives the title emeri- _ 
tus after twenty-five years of service, but, if able, he can still fill the 
position for a five years’ period. The law of 1863 continued this plan, 
only it-required a vote of two-thirds of the council to decide whether 
the person was fitted for an extension of the time of service. As cases _ 
of unfitness for further duty were reported to the minister a law of 
March 31, 1869, modified the decision by requiring a majority vote in fe 
the council. This was further modified by the commission of 1875 ge 
deciding that the reappointment after twenty-five years of service 
depended upon the professor’s wishes, as sanctioned by the curator — 
with the consent of the minister, but after thirty years’ service he was 
to obtain the full pension of 3,000 rubles and not fill a professorship, 
although if desirable he might still remain a member of the faculty, — 
and if allowed by the curator, take charge of a preparatory institute. 
The pensioning and remuneration in the case of an extra five years’ 
period were not determined by this commission, but were left for fur- 
ther discussion. = 
       
  COURSES OF STUDY. 
In the infant and maternal schools the child of from 3 to 10 takes its 
first steps in education, its powers of observation are trained and it learns 
the first elements; inmany of the schools kindergarten methodsarefound. ~ 
Asylums, which rank below or with the elementary grades, are for children 
between 7 and 12 years of age. The instruction aims to give the neces- — 
sary elements of knowledge and to thoroughly inculcate religious and» ~~ 
moral ideas. . Here, too, Frébell’s methods are used. The elementary _ 
grades take cognizance of the immediate surroundings of the pupils, the~ & ; 
earliest lessons being by the intuitive method, the regulations including 
the mother tongue (7. ¢., elements of Russian grammar), reading from 
manuscript and printed matter, writing, arithmetic through the first — 
four rules, and singing. In the villages and hamlets there are two or ; 
three classes, if the attendance permits. In cities the higher grade ~ 
elementary schools have in their six-year courses geography, Russian 
history, fractions, geometry, object drawing and drawing from copy, 
singing (especially church chants). If feasible, a trade is added for the 
boys and needlework for the girls. At the close of the course pupils are 
entitled to enter the governmental service without extra examination, 
and after a four years’ course they are presumed to be fitted for the 
gymnasia. The district schools, maintained by the ministry of public 
instruction, and gradually being transformed into city schools, have a 
course of study in which religious instruction occupies an important 
place; arithmetic is limited to addition, subtraction, multiplication,

       ivision and simple fractions. The elements of history, geography, oa 
natural history are taught from books sanctioned by the Government, 
At the close of-the third year pupils present themselves before the 
inspector or his delegate for examination in order to obtain the certifi- 
cate for elementary studies. 
The schools under control of the Holy Synod, which arranges its own 
programmes, give great prominence to religious instruction, reading, 
writing, and arithmetic coming next. These schools are generally pre- 
sided over by some brotherhood, as that of St. Cyril and St. Methodius 
at Moscow, and the Brotherhood of Our Lady at St. Petersburg. A 
_ few cities have higher elementary schools of a parochial character, but, 
as a general thing, this is simply a complementary course of Tosstuty: ; 
_ two years. = 
Parallel with secondary and elementary courses are the technical 
and industrial schools. The intermediate technical schools correspond © 
to Realschools, and in six to eight year courses give pupils sufficient 
knowledge of technical and commercial studies to fit them for industrial 
_ pursuits. The industrial schools take graduates from the elementary 
~ grades-and form them into good workmen, mechanics, and designers. 
Among these schools are the railroad schools depending upon the min- 
istry of posts and telegraphs. The lower grade technical schools have 
a course of study which does not go beyond that of the elementary 
schools. . Their aim is to form skillful artisans and workmen in village 
industries. Pupils to be admitted must show that they have attended 
public school and enter for the purpose of learning a trade. 
Secondary schools for girls date from an early period, but by a regu- 
lation of May 24, 1870, such schools were rendered uniform with the 
gymnasia and progymnasia for boys. The courses for the gymnasia. 
were of seven years, those of the progymnasia three years, and in each 
there was a preparatory class. Aneighth class in the gymnasia, called 
the pedagogic class, had as its aim the preparation of teachers for an 
inferior grade of schools. The course of study in the progymnasia 
covers religious education, Russian language, history and geography 
of Russia, elements of universal geography, arithmetic, caligraphy, and 
needlework; in the gymnasia, religious instruction, Russian language, 
literature, arithmetic, keeping accounts, geometry, universal geogra- 
phy and that of Russia, universal history and that of Russia, the prin- 
cipal elements of natural history and physics, the principles of domes- 
tic economy and hygiene, caligraphy, needlework, and gymnastics. 
Studies which are nonobligatory are the French and German lan- 
guages, music, singing, and drawing. Pupils desiring to follow these 
branches pay such fees as are determined by the administrative coun- 
cils. The course in pedagogy is principally destined for preparation of 
teachers, and consequently it comprises principles of education, sys- 
_ tems of instruction, and methods applicable to gymnasia for girls. 
There are also practice courses under the direction of teachers of the 
institution. The graduation examination consists in a French or Ger- 
   
-P-A-G-E-251
  man composition upon a shied five Grane the Scamskhntl mn, and 
some knowledge of the history of literature of the two countries. The 
pupils must also speak the two languages thoroughly, and, in the last 
years of the course, are only allowed to use foreign tone In addi- 
tion to the gymnasia and progymnasia, for day pupils, there are insti- 
tutes or boarding schools dating from the eighteenth century, these 
institutions being, generally speaking, for the territorial nobility, and 
usually presided over by the widows of higher State officials who are 
left without fortune. They are aided by inspectresses, who direct the 
studies. /The directresses and inspectresses occupy themselves partic- 
ularly with the discipline and general care of the establisment. ~ : 
The buildings occupied are of a superior class of architecture, with 
vast corridors, a large room for ceremonials, ete. The class rooms and 
directress room are on the first floor; the recreation halls, sleeping and 
dining rooms on the fleor above. Large gardens adjoin these institutes, 
which serve as play grounds in pleasant weather. Special costumes 
are worn in the different institutes. There are also regular boarding 
establishments of a secondary class for girls. All these schools haye a_ a 
woman in charge of each class, who resides in the institution, and 
looks after the discipline of the classes. These ladies in many cases 
have been pupils in the schools, and, having aptitude for the work 
intrusted to them, remain connected with the institutions as class super-_ 
visors. The conditions of admission to these institutes for girls are not 
severe. The girls must know how to read, write, count, read French 
and German. The course of study covers Russian, French, and Ger- — 
man languages, history and literature, Greek and Latin (optional), his- 
tory, geography, cosmography, natural science (physics, natural his- 
tory, elements of chemistry), arithmetic, geometry, algebra, pedagogy, 
religion, and history of the church. The religiousinstruction devolves 
upon priest and pastors, of different creeds, in the neighborhood, but 
proselyting is not thought of. 
The education of women in Russia is a question of great interest to 
all, and has been carried to a higher point than in other countries, the 
United States excepted. Courses for women have been opened by uni- 
versity professors similar to those of the Sorbonne in France. Special 
courses in medicine are open to woman, but they are only authorized to 
follow such courses if they have passed examinations in gymnasia and 
institutes, All throughout the Empire the higher culture of women is 
@ noticeable feature. The empiesses in turn have manifested great 
interest in the development of their sex, and the influence of women _ 
has been marked in elevating society and in contributing elements Gf 
distinction to the Russian character. 
Secondary instruction for boys is given in progymnasia and ‘gym: 
nasia, the first mentioned being preparatory to the latter. The gym- 
nasia are divided into philological and industrial gymnasia; in the | 
former the study of ancient languages predominates and the Govern- 
ment favors study of the classics. In the latter, natural sciences and 
 
-P-A-G-E-252
  mathematics take the lead. The Realschools, or industrial gymnasia, * 
‘are destined to prepare persons for an entrance into commerce and 
industry. The courses in the progymnasia are similar to the first four 
classes of the Realschools, so that students frequenting these schools 
are preparing themselves for any career, and, when they are ready to + 
choose, they either enter the gymnasia and continue studies leading to 
a scientific and literary course, or carry on such studies in the Realschool 
as apply to commerce and industry. The progymnasia programmes do 
not differ greatly from those of the gymnasia, being preparatory to 
them, but the ancient languages are not included. At the close of the - 
~ course in these preparatory schools a certificate of maturity is given. 
Statutes of 1828 were the basis of gymnasial study. These statutes 
- were modified in 1849 and again in 1864,' when the conditions of admis- 
sion to the gymnasia were lowered. In 1872, Count Dimitri Tolstoi. 
urged the need of a general plan of instruction for gymnasia and pro- 
gymnasia; the plan to emanate from the universities, but to be modified 
by teachers, pedagogical councils, and curators. 
A commission appointed at that period endeavored to bring about 
more unity in methods of instruction, so that pupils could pass from 
one gymnasia to another. 
Prior to the ministry of Tolstoi natural sciences and physics found a 
prominent place in the course, but changes were wrought from year to 
year as the exigencies of the times or political requirements seemed to 
make it necessary, so that at the present time the classics preponderate. 
The following is the programme of studies in 1889 in Russian gym-

and geography, chemistry and physics, which greatly interested the students; and 
arithmetic, algebra, and geometry, in which abstract branches they seemed to feel 
less interest, as it is stated by M. Hippeau.

The classical gymnasia are preparatory to the universities, but for 
those who desire to enter real life and do not care for the university — 
course, the completion of the course of study is of no great value. 
Such students gravitate to the Real schools, which according to the 
regulations “afford young men an education capable of immediate prac- 
tical application” or “(prepare them for the higher professional schools.” 
But it is stated on good authority that the Real schools, even with the 
supplementary seventh class, with its mechanico-technical and chem- 
ico-technical divisions, give so little firm foundation for efficient knowl- 
edge that few manufacturers are willing to employ the Realschool stu- 
dents, and cither.seek for those who have had instruction in technical 
schools, viz, the higher industrial schools, or prefer to take workmen who 
have learned their trade by personal observation and experience. The 
Real schools are few in number, less than 100 in 1887, while the gym- 
nasia number more than 230. Technical and industrial schools num- — 
bered at that date less than 50, but so great has been the call for such 
training, and so manifest is the growth during the past quarter of a 
century of the so-called Russian system of mechanical art! education, 
that these schools now present a most interesting development. The 
progress attained during this period is so marked that an extended 
report of technical and industrial education by M. Anopoff, of the 
Nicholas Industrial School in St. Petersburg, has aroused great inter- 
est in England and other countries. A digest of the same is given as 
an addendum to this statement of education in Russia. 
Students desiring an academic education pass from the gymnasia to 
the universities. These latter institutions differ somewhat in methods 
in the different localities, but the present status of the faculties may 
be gathered from the following statement: 
The prerequisites required by the state commission for examination” 
or examining board, are quite voluminous, but a general digest. of the   
1]t may be stated here that the workshop is the foundation of the Russian system 
of industrial art. The village industry is the form which such mechanical art 
takes. The Russian makes the art* the fundamental and builds his trade on that. 
He realizes that there are certain general practices underlying instruction, and that 
one can not teach art without teaching the constructions depending upon them. 
He believes that the true place for mechanical arts is in the school while the student 
pursues his studies, and that manual instruction should be a part of the school 
course. Hence he has established the workshop and has formulated a system which 
is viewed with interest everywhere and has been generally adopted in different parts 
of the United States, commencing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, at the 
Institute of Technology, and extending westward and southward to other schools. 
2The gradual changes in university organization with the reform movements tak- 
ing place from time to time, are clearly brought out in ‘‘ Die Reform der russischen — 
Universitiiten nach dem Gesetz vom 23. August 1884.” The main points are here 
interpolated. University laws were passed in 1835 and 1862-63, those for Dorpat in 
1865, but not satisfying the higher functionaries, other efforts at reform were made 
in 1871-72 under Minister Tolstoi, the university officials being asked to specify

_ same will clearly show the importance of university study as viewed 
from the Russian standpoint. The classics form the basis of all study 
in the historico-philological section, and the students are required 
to show that they have a firm basis for work in classical philology. 
The studies are divided into obligatory and supplementary branches. 
The student must be able to interpret Greek and Roman authors, 
antiquities, literature, mythology, grammar, history, history of art, and 
philosophy. At least four of the classic poets and prose writers must 
have been thoroughly studied and the translations into Russian must 
be made in good style. The methods to be employed in scientific inter- 
pretation and philological criticism must also be studied. In philos- 
ophy a thorough knowledge of Plato and Aristotle is required as a 
basis for further philosophical development. In history, chronological 
and geographic data of the principal events of Greek and Roman plas- 
tic art when at its highest development, and also the special epochs of 
_art development in the Christian world, are requisite, The examina- - 
_ tion. covers either one of the following two supplementary groups of 
_ studies, viz, the linguistic and the historic.’ In the former is required 
a knowledge of Russian language aid literature, from the oldest 
periods of history, with the general growth to the present time, the 
Slavonic tongues, with knowledge of the grammar, church literature, 
and the changes wrought in the different periods with the dialect forms, 
and the history of western European literature. This includes cogni-~ 
zance of sueh writers as Dante, Cervantes, Shakespeare, the French clas- 
sical writers, Goethe and Schiller. The historic group covers the world’s 
  ; what they considered most needed, each in his own institution. The general request 
-was for more salary, more instructors, and more fellowships. A committee for special 
inquiry was appointed in 1874, Its investigations led to the reforms of 1884, which 
urged the necessity of leaving disciplinary and administrative affairs to the Govern- 
ment, of adopting new methodsof appointing professors, of requiring higher entrance 
examinations and good behavior as a prerequisite for the holding of university 
scholarships, guaranteeing liberty of instruction under Government supervision, 
limiting the power of the professors, and establishing an outside commission for the 
examination of students for graduation. The law of 1863 accorded little power to 
the curators (curator, a prominent person having the confidence of the Czar. He 
Jooks' after the welfare of the university whenever an intermediary between the 
higher authorities and those of the university is required], but more to the university 
_ rectors, The law of 1884 empowered the curator to take charge of all practical 
instruction, to be held responsible for all disorders, and to take cognizance of all 
special matters; an inspector and several assistants to aid the curator; the rector to 
look after the organization of instruction and discipline; the dean, the curator, and 
rector to coéperate in bringing about better discipline in the university: The rector 
was to be appointed by the Czar and the deans by the minister. The minister could 
either appoint the professors or sanction the appointment of a candidate presented 
_ by the university authorities. By the earlier laws the universities were established 
according to the German plan, but later discussions tended towards a Russianizing 
of these institutions by appointing natives of the country, who, being cognizant of 
the country’s aims, would exert an influence over the students preferable to that of 
a foreign element. By law of 1863 the Government controlled university examina- 
tions, and although objections were made to this plan by the different commissions |

The examinations by the commission in charge of the physico-mathe- 
matical section deal either with the domain of natural science or that of — 
mathematics. Included under natural sciences as obligatory branches — 
are chemistry, zodlogy with comparative anatomy and physiology, - 
botany, mineralogy and geology with paleontology, physics, and phys- 
ieal geography. In chemistry the student obtains insight into drganie, 
inorganic, and analytical chemistry, with a knowledge of chemical pro- — 
cesses; in zodlogy a fundamental knowledge of zodtomy, anatomy, phys- 
iology, embryology, histology, and biology, so that he understands the 
connection between those different divisions and can explain charts and _ 
drawings of the same; in botany he must have a fundamental knowl. _ 
edge and be able to analyze the plant world, especially the local flora; _ 
in mineralogy the same system of thorough study is applied through- 
out the mineralogical, geological, and paleontological fields; the course 
in physics is equally comprehensive, covering electricity, atmospheric 
changes, theory of light undulations, hydrography and meteorology, 
optical instruments, weights, and movement of fluid and gaseous forma- 
tions, ete. In the section.of physics the student has to show that he — 
has made special studies in chemical analysis, in comparative anatomy 
and physiology, in the use of the microscope in the characterization of — 
the different types of plants, in the physical and chemical attributes of 
  
appointed, it was decided in 1884 to create governmental boards of examiners. Dis-_ 
_cussious pro and con led to provision being made for the appointment of five boards — 
of examiners, namely, the historico- -philological, the physico-mathematical, , the legal, 
the oriental, and medical, The chairmen of these boards were appointed by the 
minister. The doctor’s diploma in medicine in a ‘foreign university entitled to — 
position on the medical board. The passing of the examination before the com- 
mission entitled to a diploma of first or second grade. (There is, however, only one 
diploma in medicine, thatof physician.) The preparation for academic degrees and 
the preparatory examinations before passing to higher classes were left to the uni- 
versity authorities, as the State examination did not prevent the faculties’ examina- 
tion of the student to find outhis pedagogical status. A programme was provided for 
each faculty to which each student must adhere, but students were not obliged to 
attend lectures, and were allowed to pass from one faculty to another to hear lectures 
on any given subject. One feature of the university plan was the establishment, 
with the minister’s permission, of a ‘‘Seminar,” in which the student who has recog- 
nized ability in some specialty receives instruction with a view towards a higher — 
development in the desired study. In the faculty for natural science, philology, and 
history the ‘‘Seminar” aimed to prepare teachers; in the legal faculty, to prepare 
jurists. The plan and length of existence of the “Seminar” depends upon the min- 
ister’s decision. Each university sets aside $4,185 for remuneration of professors, 
room rental, purchase of books and school material for use of the ‘“‘Seminar.” The 
discussions pro and con as to methods of instruction in the different faculties brought 
about a more practical line of work, with fewer studies and less cramming for exami- 
nation.

the earth as they pertain to agronomy, etc. In mathematics the student - 
is required to show both practical and theoretical knowledge, by exami- 
nation and otherwise, of the theory of numbers, higher algebra and 
geometry, theory of elliptical functions, the elasticity of bodies, prac- 
tical mechanics and descriptive geometry, theory of gases, of light, dif- 
ferential and integral calculus, and in fact he scans the whole mathe- 
matical field, with its attendant branches of physics, mechanics, and 
astronomical calculations, hydrostatics and hydronomics,. 
The commission for the examination of the legal faculty indicates in 
its programme the diverse directions in which the lecturer may branch 
out, as it is considered that a detailed and systematic programme would 
narrow the field too much. The subjects treated are (1) Roman law with 
the history of the same (this‘includes knowledge of political history, 
and of religious, public, agricultural, and commercial life of Rome), and 
a knowledge of general legal concepts based on Roman Jaw; (2) history 
of the laws of Russia, with the gradual development of states’ rights; 
and civil, criminal, financial, religious, and trade laws; (3) the rights 
of government, with military and judicial laws, the rights of the gov- 
erning powers towards the people; (4) the rights of the church and of 
the Russian church in particular, with knowledge of the Roman Catho- 
lic, Armenian, Gregorian, and Lutheran tenets; (5) police regulations, 
with the conditions governing the moral and material welfare of the 
people; (6) political economy and statistics; (7) civil and commercial 
Jaw and procedure, with theoretical knowledge of the Russian civil 
code and of commerce by land and sea, and the rules governing inter- 
national law; (8) criminal laws and processes; (9) laws governing 
finance, with a scientific knowledge of Russian income, monopolies, cus- 
tom duties, ete.; (10) international law, with the political system.of 
Europe trom 1648 on, the rights of neutrality, ete.; (11) the philosophy 
of law,‘with the principal developments of the old classic world, and 
fundamental knowledge of the works of Plato, Aristotle, and Cicero; 
(12) encyclopedia of the science of law, with a clear understanding of 
_~ law in both objective and subjective sense. The students must also 
have special knowledge of at least two of the above branches. The 
-plan of studies includes eighteen hours a week in each semester, or 
one hundred and forty-four hours for the eight semestri; to Roman law, - 
thirty-six hours; history of Russian law, sixteen hours; civil and com- 
mercial laws of Russia and their processes, twenty-two hours; Russian 
criminal law and processes, twelve hours; Russian governmental, 
church, police, and financial laws with political economy, eight hours 
each; international law, six hours; statistics, encyclopedic knowledge 
and history of the philosophy of law, four hours. 
For the examinations by the medical commission the student must 
show a certificate of tentamen physicum which covers descriptive anat- 
omy, histology, and embryology, physiology, physics, chemistry, 
pharmacy, pharmacognosia, zodlogy, botany, and mineralogy. He
-P-A-G-E-257

must also show that he has been in attendance during ten semestri 
‘and has had practical experience, giving the number of cases he has 
treated and the reports which he has made on clinical cases, dis- 
sections, etc. The medical examinations extend over six weeks, and 
the course includes: (1) descriptive anatomy; (2) descriptive histology, 
with constructive knowledge of the organic development, use of the 
microscope; (3) pathology and the different changes perceptible in 
the body after death; (4) topographical anatomy with requisite oper- 
ations; (5) physiology, with the use of instruments; (6) qualitative and 
quantitative pathological chemistry; (7) pharmacology, with use of 
medicines, mineral waters; (8) pharmacy with diagnoses, and the use — 
of combinations in medicine; (9-13) special pathology and therapeutics, 
with practical demonstration of the same; (14-17) knowledge of surgery 
and ophthalmology, with demonstration of the instruments used, exam- 
ination of the sick, with diagnosis of disease; (18) hygienic and sanitary 
demonstrations; (20) science of veterinary surgery and a knowledge, of 
epizoétics. The course of study requires twenty-two hours of lecture 
or study, and practical exercises during each of the semestri, the sub- 
jects being arranged in a systematic course of from six to eight hours 
in each branch. The students are expected but are not obliged to fol- 
low the courses. The plan arranged by the above law of 1884 has 
been the means of progress in university study; the examinations be- — 
fore the commission appointed by the minister give a true value to the 
diploma. Whether the student receives a first or second grade diploma 
depends upon the aptitude manifested at the examination. In the med- 
ical faculty the first diploma, that of a physician, gives the right to 
practice and to present one’s self for the doctorate degree. 
Higher-grade education is disseminated in quite a number of special 
schools. The St. Petersburg technological institute gives not only 
theoretical knowledge, but also demands the technical and practical use 
of the same. In the two lower courses the students study the theory of 
the fundamental branches and instrumental drawing; in the two follow- — 
ing courses, mechanics and chemistry, from the scientific side, the mechan- 
ical part to include working drawings of machinery operated by water 
and steam power, the chemical, such drawings as are used in chemical 
laboratories, in glass and pottery manufactories, and also qualitative and 
quantitative analyses. The fifth course includes, in the mechanical 
division, more extended plans of machinery, foundry work, casting, turn- 
ing, locksmiths’ work, smiths’ work; in the chemical division plans to be 
worked out in different chemical industries and the working out of such 
plansas would naturally enter into these technological branches. In free 
hours students go out with their professors to inspect the architecture 
of new buildings in process of erection, and visit manufactories and rail- 
road workshops, thereby obtaining practical knowledge. The St. Peters- 
burg Historico-philological Institute follows, in the main, the course of 
study of the historico- peach faculties of the universities, but dif-

“fers therefrom in having the lectures tend more towards the require- 
_ ments of teachers in gymnasia, for which position some of the students 
are being fitted, and in having a course in pedagogies. Physical train- 
ing enters into the course, as the students have nine hours each in the 
- gymnasium. 
The Demidoff Lyceum of Jurisprudence at Jaroslaw, has a corps of 
professors giving instruction in practical exercises in Roman law, politi- 
cal economy, in civil processes according to the laws of Russia, of the 
present and of the olden times. : 
The Lasarew Institute for Oriental Languages, in Moscow, has as 
special object the teaching of Armenians, although it includes students 
_ of all ranks, all confessions, and all nationalities, In the gymnasial 
division the Armenian language is obligatory; in the three higher 
classes Armenian, Persian, and Arabic literature, the Turkish-tartar, 
and the Iberian tongues. The lower course is theoretical, the upper 
more practical in character. In 1883 juridical studies were also intro- 
_ duced. 
The polytechnic school in Riga has seven divisions—the agricultural, 
chemico-technical, geodetic, civil engineering, mechanical engineering, 
architectural, and commercial. : : 
The Institute for Forestry and A griculture,in Nowaja-Alexandria, has 
theoretical courses in agricultural economics, bee and silk culture, fish 
5 culture, veterinary science, geodesy, descriptive geometry, agricultural 
chemistry. Practical instruction is given in veterinary medicine, in 
farming, in garden work, in forestry, and in laboratory work. The stu- 
_ dents also make excursions with the view of studying of botany and 
zoology. These and divers other special schools aim to train the youth 
invarious directions leading to professiqns. 
The general trend of instruction in the different grades of schools 
which form the school system is, if the generality of writers may be 
relied upon, to serve more and more fully to keep the Russian youth 
within a certain limit, so that he may become thoroughly cognizant of all 
branches from the Russian standpoint and that any tendencies towards 
German socialism may be quelled. The student is to learn to compre- 
~hend the needs of his own country, to prepare himself so that he may 
develop its riches, to become imbued with a knowledge of its instita- 
tions, and, in the lower classes, to be taught its village industries, so as 
to make use of his talents near home, rather than to drift away towards 
other lands. 
SCHOOL MANAGEMENT AND METHODS OF DISCIPLINE.! 
The management of schools of all grades would seem to be rather 
a complicated affair in Russia, for, on account of the numerous school 
officials who have various duties in regard to schools, it appears that 
  
1 Information in regard to this point has been obtained in part from manuscript 
furnished by Miss F. Toulmin Smith, of England, in part from lectures given by Dr. 
Himowich at Johns Hopkins University, and in part from other sources. 
 
-P-A-G-E-259
      little is left to the teacher beyond the mere inculcation of instruction, 
and even in this he is subjected to regulations imposed by the highest — es 
authorities; all the business arrangements are subservient to rules laid 
down by the department of public instruction; the council, or learned : 
committee, is responsible for selection of and changes in school books, 
programmes of studies, etc., and it is this council which finally adjusts 
all questions appertaining to the elementary schools. In each educa 
tional circuit the curator and inspector and the council aiding them 
watch closely over the interests of the schools, furnishing such school — 
material as has been approved at St. Petersburg, suspending schools it _ 
they are prejudicial to the community, dismissing teachers, and in every 
way guarding the interests of the government. Each city school has 
an inspector attached to it, and he, or the principal, is a member of 
the school council, which discusses the needs of the school and reports 
to the next higher school functionaries. 
Private schools are all under the supervision of the circuit inspector, 
and the whole plan of the school must have been submitted to the 
authorities ere the teacher is permitted to open the school. 
The gymnasia have two committees to manage their affairs: the com. 
mittee of management and the pedagogical committee. The former — 
looks after the funds and the construction and repairs. The latter ex. 
amines and reports upon all school questions, behavior, examinations, 
rewards, ete. Changes in programme and selection of text-books must, 
however, be submitted to the curator of the educational cireuit.. The 
pedagogical council may choose the teachers, but the curator must 
sanction such choice. The governor of the province acts as an honorary — 
curator, visiting the schools whenever he is inclined. In the gymnasia — 
the teachers are supervised by the inspector, and all are under the eye © 
of the director, who rules absolutely, but has-no right to expel a pupil 
unless the council (composed of directors, inspectors, and teachers) 
sanction such expulsion. ‘ 
The directors and inspectors are governmental appointees, and are— 
expected to abide by all rules laid down by the ministry of public _ 
instruction; consequently there is little individuality allowed. The 
directors and inspectors are assisted by teachers and class tutors, the lat- 
ter being held responsible for the conduct of pupils in and out of the 
classes, even in boarding places. The tutors have assistants to aid ce 
them and take their place if absent. Each tutor is supposed to look — 
after about 15 pupils. The teachers are expected to be very conserva: 
tive in their methods; to be present in school at certain hours of the 
day dressed in the uniform required. The pupils arise when the teacher 
enters and stand until he reaches his desk. Opening prayers are read 
in a perfunctory manner by a pupil, and then the work of the day com: 
mences. Olass journals are kept, and every method is pursued to keep — 
strict account of the pupils’ daily life, although there isno special regu. 
lation which requires a certain amount of study from him. ¥ :

   The methods employed in the girls’ gymnasia and progymnasia are 
imilar to those of the boys’ gymnasia. The functions of the two com- 
mittees are about the same. The lady principal is expected to be present- 
at the meetings of the committees, even as is the director in the other 
ase. One of the lady patronesses (chosen by the town authorities, 
but sanctioned by the Empress), and other persons who may be sup- 
porters of the gymnasia, must also be present when the committee of 
management holds its meetings to discuss teachers’ salaries, school 
the pedagogical committee is generally a director of a boy’s gymnasium, 
nd his authority extends in some cases even to the dismissal of teach- 
ars. Yet if there is any dispute between him and the lady principal as 
to examinations, awards, transferring and marking pupils, appeal can 
be made to the curator of the circuit. 
In the institutes for girls the arrangements are very similar. The 
ladies (dames de classe) and attends to the carrying out of all regulations 
and to the observance of good manners in the school. The dames de classe 
are responsible to her for the general demeanor of each member of the 
Jass to which they are assigned. The instruction is given, however, 
by visiting teachers, who are under the supervision of an inspector. 
_ This inspector sometimes gives lessons, and-has duties imposed on him ° 
_in connection with the results of the examinations. The field of study is. 
a broader one than in the gymnasia, and the graduates receive a diploma 
_which enables them to teach in gymnasia. 
The methods employed in the universities and special schools have 
been stated substantially under the heading ‘Course of study,” so that 
further statements seem unnecessary. 
* S DISCIPLINE, 
The numerous persons in authority in the different grades of schools 
are naturally on the alert for any infringement of discipline, and various 
are the punishments meted out to the unfortunates. The pupil may be 
_ reprimanded, may be kept in; he may be even shut up in a small room 
under guard. In the class journal thereis a record kept of the general 
bearing of the pupils in the school. Corporal punishment is not allowed 
in any civilschool, but expulsion for dereliction of duty is permitted when 
the authorities—namely, the committees, inspector, or curator—together 
- Sanction such expelling of the pupil, and in the secondary schools the ex- 
pulsion is sometimes accompanied with the statement that the pupil can 
‘not enter another gymnasium in the Empire, or if he is permitted to attend 
another secondary school he may be required to pass another entrance 
examination. The discipline is not limited to the school, but may be fees, free tuition, morals, and manners, etc. The presiding officer of — 
lady principal has full charge; the inspectress superintends the class _ 
said to come under three heads, viz, when in school, at hone, and on |

the street.! If a pupil is found on the street, it is supposed that he 
ought to be either at school or at home; if he does not properly salute the 
school functionaries he is subject to reprimand; if he is a Realschool or 
gymnasium pupil he is prohibited from wearing civilian’s dress, and that 
prohibition extends to his not being allowed to visit secret societies, 
public balls, clubs, and similar places. The same code applies in a 
measure to the university student, and in military schools there are 
even morerigid rules for the training of Russian youth. 
STUDY AND RECITATIONS. 
In the rural schools the general aim of instruction is to train pupils, 
from their eighth year on, in the four rules of arithmetic, in singing 
1A translation of a Russian ticket in the hands of a Russian gentleman, giving the 
rules of the third kind of discipline prescribed for the students of the gymnasia and— 
Real schools of the city of Kief. The ticket reads as follows: 
“Rules for pupils of middle education at schools of the city of Kief, not in the walls of 
the schools and not at home. 
“1, It is prohibited to the pupils to visit institutions of pleasure, as Chateau de 
Fleur, Tivoli, Mineral Waters, or pleasures in Bokovaya Roscha (grove), on the 
other side of the Dnieper, or in any other pleasure gardens. It is allowed to visit 
the Botanical Garden. 
“2. It is allowed to visit the theater only when permission is granted by the 
authorities in each special case, and not otherwise than by tickets issued by the said 
authorities, and by no means in the gallery. 
“3, It is prohibited to visit public balls; masquerades, clubs, dancing evenings, 
tea-gardens, café houses, confectionaries, billiard halls, and other like public insti- 
tutions. It is strictly prohibited to visit secret socicties or circles. 
“4, It is prohibited to go boating on the Dnieper, and on pleasure walks out of 
the city, unless together with the parent or guardian. 
“5. It is prohibited to walk in the streets or be ont of doors later than 9 o’clock 
p. m., unless there be some extra event, or the pupil is accompanied by parent or 
guardian. 
«<6, Every pupil is compelled to have this ticket with him, and to present it at 
the first demand of the police, or persons employed by the Government, known for 
that duty by their appearance. In case the pupil refuses to fulfill this demand, or 
if there be plain disobedience, the person to whom this matter is intrusted has the 
right to apply for assistance to the police in order to bring the offender to the school 
where he belongs. 
“7, The pupils, when not at home, must fulfill punctually the ordered form of dress, 
not excluding the knapsack for books, with all the school supplies, and all his but-_ 
tons must be buttoned. To wear civil dress is strictly prohibited. 
“8, On meeting with officials, and also with the teachers or assistants, the pupils 
must greet them with a polite bow, taking off the cap or hat. 
“9, It is prohibited to take out books for reading from public libraries. There is 
a library in every school purposely for the scholars, from which the pupils only may 
draw books for reading. Should it happen that the pupil take out a prohibited 
book, he must present it to the officials. 
“10. No one of the pupils has the right to be engaged in tutoring without the® 
special permission of the officials.” : . 
_It is stated that in large cities it is difficult to enforce these rules, but in smaller 
places they are carried out.

   and writing, in reading in the Russian and Slavonic tongues (the latter 
being necessary in order to read the required prayers), and in the cate- 
chism and Bible. There are generally two classes in these schools, and 
the inspector of the district has general charge of instruction. The 
two sexes may be educated together from their eighth to their four- 
teenth year. If there are not enough pupils to have one school to 
each parish, then ambulatory schools, as in other northern and sparsely- 
settled countries, move from place to place as they are needed. In 
the-urban schools (one school to 1,000 inhabitants is the intention, 
but not the rule) the hours are from 9 to about 3 o’clock, with intermis- 
_ sions between the 45 to 55-minute recitations. , The sessions are opened 
and closed with prayers. In many of the schools, both village and 
town, instruction leading to trades has been introduced of late years. 
In secondary schools there is an entrance examination unless the pupil 
has passed through the course of study in the preparatory class, which 
he may enter at 10 years of age if he shows himself to be of average 
intelligence, if he can count up to 1,000, add and substract, and recite 
two prayers. Attention to the rules of the school and preparation 
from class to class through the eight classes to matriculation entitle 
him, if he be a gymnasial pupil, to the passing in his eighteenth year 
to the university without further examination. Should the pupil seem 
backward in certain studies, then he remains another year in the classes 
where those studies are taught. In the majority of schools of all 
grades the recitations are carried on in the Russian tongue, the plan of 
a few years ago of teaching in the German, Polish, or other common 
language of the province haying been relegated to the past by Imperial 
- decrees which require the use of the Russian language in all schools. 
PROMOTION OF PUPILS. 
This occurs in all schools after the annual examinations in April or 
May. The examinations, which take place in some public building, 
before the school officials and others interested, are both oral and writ-— 
ten and last many hours, so that the naturally timid pupil is oftentimes 
under great strain. If the school preparation has been thoroughly 
conducted there is, however, but little chance of failure, as many of the 
~questions are familiar to the pupil. In the private schools the annual 
examinations are also held in the presence of the inspectors and teachers. 
FORMATION OF PROGRAMMES. 
__ Ashas been mentioned heretofore, the programmes of study emanate 
from the committee in charge in the ministry of public instruction, 
even the text books being chosen by them. The programme of private 
schools must be regularly vouched for by the authorities of the educa- 
tional circuit, according to the rules promulgated by.the ministry. By 
law of July 13, 1884, the Holy Synod forms its own programmes of study, 
_ but it is generally conceded that the central authorities are thoroughly 
informed in regard to all such matters,

  SCHOOL ORGANIZATION. 
BUILDINGS AND GROUNDS. = 
In villages where the people are well-to-do the schoolhouses are suited 
to the requirements of the school population, but in many of the rural — 
districts there is great lack of accommodation, the pupils sit on the 
floor, and both light and heat are lacking.. But whenever the provin- — 
cial assemblies, or zemstvos, can so arrange it there are suitable school 
rooms and desks, the requisite books, diagrams, geographical and his- 
torical pictures, etc. In the city schools the buildings are more likely _ 
to be according to sanitary requirements.'! Many school buildings, how- 
ever, are not well arranged in a hygienic sense, though generally speak- 
ing, the buildings are roomy and well ventilated and the construction of 
school buildings is said to be improving from year to year. The gym- 
nasia are located in the larger centers, and as a rule have large, well- 
ventilated class rooms, and have. grounds suited to athletic sports, 
yet in many localities the gymnasia, progymnasia and Realschools are - 
not properly housed and much complaint is made. In military and 
naval schools the same effort is made to have well-aired rooms, with 
the proper, hygienic arrangements. In the gymnasia and institutes 
for girls the buildings are large, roomy, and lofty. The height of the 
class rooms in the institutes is 16 feet, length and width 32 by 24 feet. 
The halls are large and airy, but there is a lack of spaciousness in the 
dormitories. 
The schools are intended to be so organized as not to have over fifty 
pupils to a class, and thirty is the average. School fees are charged in 
all grades of schools, from the elementary through the higher grades. 
There are free pupils, however, and parents are aided if too poor to buy — 
text books and other material. The authorities also create scholar- 
ships and bursaries for poor students, and in all schools there is a fund 
for needy pupils, which fund is created and kept up by a small annual | 
subscription from teachers and friends, 
HOURS OF SCHOOL AND RECESSES. 
The hours of school range from 9 to half past 2 o’clock, although in 
some cases extending to 3 o’clock in the afternoon. If, in the lower 
elementary grades there are too many pupils, the boys sometimes re- 
ceive instruction from 9 to 12 o’clock, and the girls from 1 to 3 or 4 
o'clock. There are recesses and intermissions, the number of which is 
not designated. The school week is six days, the length of recitation 
varies, it may be forty-five, fifty, or fifty-five minutes, but between reci- 
tations there is an effort to air the room and give the children oppor- 
tunity for change of position; after about five minutes the pupils are 
again in their places for work,

  HOLIDAYS AND VACATIONS 
Are not distinctly specified, but include the summer months, church 
and legal holidays, Easter and Christmas. For the pupils of military 
schools there are also certain imperial holidays. 
COMPULSORY ATTENDANCE.! 
_ Attendance is obligatory upon children between 7 and 12 years of age 
(8 to 12 in rural districts), but it has not seemed possible to carry out this, 
provision in all provinces. In many of the provinces latitude is left to 
_ the zemstyos to act in this matter as they deem it best, and still it may 
be stated that province after province has endeavored to carry out 
such regulation, the Baltic provinces taking the lead. The communal i 
_ authorities can tiigponce with the regular attendance of children if they 
_ live too remote from a permanent school, and in case of bad weather 
or famine (as during 1890-91) they may be excused from school attend- 
ance, 
SCHOOL SUPPLY. 
The intention of the ministry of public instruction is to have the 
schools supplied with apparatus and school material, and through the 
_ Joeal authorities it furnishes not only text-books, but apparatus to the 
elementary grades. Each gymnasium is supposed to possess a cabinet 
of physical apparatus, natural history specimens, geographical atlases, 
globes, gymnastic apparatus, music books, ete. The progymnasia are 
also supposed to be similarly equipped, except in the matter of natural 
history collections and physical apparatus. In the secondary schools 
for girls, progymnasia, gymnasia, and institutes, every facility for study 
is to be given, and the same intention is manifested in special schools. 
_ Yet the many changes in authorities, local and educational, the change 
of policy at St. Petersburg under the various ministries, the undercur- 
rent of socialism permeating all classes, the necessity of keeping the 
country on a military footing, the famine arising from poor harvests, 
all these things combine to make even the best efforts to improve the 
schools comparatively futile, except possibly in some of the higher grade 
  
+The attempt to bring about compulsory attendance throughout Russia is fe 
? stated: Towards the close of October, 1871, the Zemstvo of the district of Skopine 
(government of Riazan) resolved, after mature deliberation, to demand that: the 
_ attendance at elementary schools ite made obligatofy. In the government of Penza 
_ the communal assembly of the village Lvovskaia-Varejka requested that education be 
_ made compulsory for all children from 7 years on, the parents being subject to a fine 
of from 25 copeks to a ruble in case of failure in attendance. Ossa (province of 
Perm) demanded obligatory instruction for children from 9 to 14 years of age.’ The 
- provincial assembly of the district of Constantinograd (government of Poltova) 
voted, in 1866, for the principle of gratuitous obligatory instruction in elementary 
schools for children between 8 and 14 years of age, with a fine of from 25 copeks to a 
- ruble in case of nonobservance. Thus it is seen that the local authorities were in 
_ sympathy with the state authorities as to the need of compulsory education.

institutions and in the most well to do centers. Rules and regulations 
concerning schools are made from year to. year,.as occasion warrants, 
but these decrees remain a dead letter on the statute books, and the 
lower schools, and sometimes those of higher grade, are often without 
even the necessities for carrying on instruction. 
SUPPLEMENTARY INSTITUTIONS. 
LIBRARIES AND MUSEUMS. 
In the Imperial library, at St. Petersburg, there is a valuable col- 
lection of manuscripts in Russian, Slavonic, Arabic, and other lan- 
guages, also valuable historical works, the readers of which numbered 
113,562 in 1884. They examined 1,200 MSS. and 174,542 books in 
206,645 volumes. Tickets with permission to work in the library were 
issued to the number of 12,323, and 3,721 visitors were shown the col- 
lections. f 
The public library and museum at Vilna and the central archives 
in several of the “ governments” are frequently visited for purposes of 
study. The Rumjiinzow Museum in Moscow is especially rich in 
antiquities and ethnographic collections. It has also a public library. 
The Caucasian Museum in Tiflis, containing a library of 30,000 volumes, 
has a special collection of topographical and agricultural maps. Its 
walls and ceilings are rich in deeoration, the scenes being emblematic 
of the Oriental, Armenian, Byzantine, and ancient Grecian styles, rep- 
resenting, as it were, the different epochs of history. 
The Imperial Historical Museum was placed under the charge of the 
minister of public instruction in 1882, and in 1883 was moved into a 
building of fine architectural proportions. In 1884 it received interest- 
ing collections in bronze and gold. The different rooms have typical 
representations of the stone age, the bronze age, the age of iron, and 
other world epochs. fi 
The Pedagogical Museum, a recent creation, includes an artistic and 
pedagogical museum, a library and an establishment for all grades of 
instruction. Normal courses of four years’ duration are arranged for 
forty students. The necessary tools, the ordinary necessities of life, a 
tea room, smoking room, ete., are also arranged for the accommodation 
of the student and reader. The care of the collections is assured by 
an annual subsidy of $558. -In winter the ablest men of science in 
Russia give courses of lectures at the museum, which are highly appre- 
ciated by the large audiences in attendance. 
SOCIETIES. 
Connected with the pedagogical museum are the Society for the 
Encouragement of Hducation in the Family, which is under the patron- 
age of the Princess Ekatherina Mikhailovna, and the Society for the 
Study of Hygiene. This museum, it may be added, is a link between

the intellectual element in society and the masses, aiding the different 
classes, especially soldiers, by courses and conferences. An institution 
which is not less original is the Permanent Commission for Popular 
Conferences instituted a few years ago by the Russian Government, and 
_ which has for its aim the instruction of the people even while amusing 
- them. For this purpose reunions take place in the most important 
cities of the Empire and in the barracks where soldiers are stationed. 
The lectures are usually illustrated by means of views found in the 
imperial museums and galleries, such views being reproduced on glass, 
then colored, and finally thrown on screens by a lantern, which presents 
the view in color ‘to the spectator. These popular conferences deal 
with subjects which are especially chosen to suit the audience; if sol- 
diers, then a military man talks about Peter the Great, Souvaroff, and 
indeed all the military glory of Russia. The conferences for the people 
treat of other subjects—of the liberation of the serfs, of Alexander LI— 
the pictures in both cases serving to impress upon the audience such 
scenes as bear upon the subjects given. Other lectures are upon popu- 
lar writers, with a description, perhaps, of the life of the writer. 
The Society for Popular Education at Kharkof is under the charge of 
Mile. Christine Altechevski, who is aided by 60 teachers. The society 
has charge of Sunday courses of study for women, These courses, found 
in different parts of Russia, have about 400 persons following them. A 
library with a class of books especially appropriate for the needs of 
adults and children is connected with this society. The age of pupils 
— (peasants, working women, and servants) varies from 7 to 45 years. 
The classes are subdivided in groups, according to the knowledge dis- 
_ played. School festivals tend to bring into communication the families, 
the teachers, and the pupils. The teachers, who give their time gratu- 
itously to this work, take part in the educational councils of the society. 
The school organized at Kharkof by this association has become the 
_ model of the Sunday school for the rest of the Empire. An interesting 
point in regard to this work among the people was the appointing of a 
special commission to determine what books were read, or were the 
best to be read, by the people, and the effect of such books upon the 
minds of the parents and children. The result of this investigation 
was to classify about 2,500 works under the title of “what the people 
should read.” . A systematic plan of reading books of merit aloud to 
the people was also undertaken. The influence of this society is felt 
- even in the world of letters, so that several authors have written books 
for the benefit of the people, or abridged well-known works on Russia 
and other countries. The schools are taught by ladies from the best 
classes of society, who volunteer for such purpose. 
cher aids to education are the popular publications of the com-— 
mittee of elementary education, of the Society for the Propagation of 
Good Books, of the Intermediary, a society founded by Tolstoi, which 
intends to bring the higher and lower classes together on a common 
 
-P-A-G-E-267

footing. A new publication is called Russian Thought, the editor of 
which deems it useless to treat the peasants like children, but feels 
that they should at least have homeopathic doses of the intellectual — 
culture which dominates the rest of Europe. There is also the school of 
Yosnaia Paliana, founded and maintained by Léon Tolstoi, and the 
journal of the same name, wherein the celebrated writer develops his 
theories. These essays serve to show the interest which the higher 
classes of Russian society have for popular education. 4 
Popular lectures were established under ministerial sanction as far _ 
back as 1873, a permanent commission being charged with looking out 
for this work and with elaborating regulations applicable to the organ- 
ization of lectures which were inaugurated in St. Petersburg the same 
year. : a 
A Russian society for the diffusion of useful books was early estab- 
lished, for during 1860-70 it had, edited 101 books, of which 34,900_ 
copies had been published and 16,000 distributed gratis. This society, 
which was recruited almost entirely among the nobility and burghers — 
of Moscow, also founded a publishing house which furnished educational — 
literature and popular reading as cheaply as possible. Translations — 
from Pestalozzi, Channing, Bain, Owen, Froebel, Combe, Boehme, 
Virchow, and others, were also placed before the reading public. Pro- 
vincial and local associations were also formed on a similar plan to the 
    Society for the Diffusion of Knowledge, but most schools of the prov. 
inces obtain their school material from the depository of the main so- 
ciety. People’s libraries were also instituted by this society, and an 
arrangement was made with the zemstyos to place educational litera- 
ture gratuitously within reach of the peasantry in the country around 
Kharkof, if not elsewhere. There are many other societies which serve 
as a means for carrying on a higher grade of education, even to the 
continuation of university studies. Learned works on biology, philos- 
ophy, and chemistry are often published by them. Classed among 
these societies is the Society of Physics, an’auxiliary of the University 
of St. Petersburg, and which, through gifts made for that purpose, - 
gives more thought to astronomical observations than to experiments 
in physics. The Society of Naturalists publishes important works and 
organizes expeditions to other countries. - 
The Society of Amateurs for the Study of Anthropology and Ethnog- 
raphy has created a museum of applied sciences. The Society of 
Naturalists of the University of Kazan, independent: of its scientific © 
work, has established twenty-eight or more meteorological stations, a 
health department, a magnetic observatory at Kazan, and has organ- 
ized excursions to continue studies in astronomy, botany, geology, and — 
zodlogy. Then there are the Academy of Sciences, the Mineralogical 
Society, the Geographical Society, with its Caucasian and Siberian — 
branches, the Moscow Society of Naturalists, the Archeological and — 
Scientific Societies of the Baltic provinces, and various medical and —
-P-A-G-E-268
REPORT, 1890-91. - 
educational societies. The work accomplished by the learned men of 
Russia is especially noteworthy in the lines of chemistry, biology, and 
physiology; women, too, have special courses of lectures in chemistry 
in the Alexander hospitals in St. Petersburg, and here, as elsewhere, 
they show themselves apt students, but as they were found to be with- 
_ out special preparation for such study the hospital commission has 
opened special courses for them in pharmaceutics, botany, and chemistry, 
anonymous members providing the funds for such study. The Russian 
Government has also undertaken to give them a solid preparation for 
_ the position of pharmacist. Women between 17 and 40 years of age 
are admitted if the examination requirements are met. During the 
three years’ course they are admitted to university laboratorics, so as 
to obtain practical experience. 
SCHOOL SAVINGS BANKS, 
It is questionable whether this method of establishing habits of thrift 
has ever obtained a footing in Russia, as the participants in the first 
congress for technical and professional instruction held in St. Peters- 
burg in January, 1890, resolved to petition the Imperial Technical 
Society and the minister of public instruction to establish such banks 
in connection with the technical schools. 
SCHOOLS VOR SPECIAL CLASSES. 
~ The present number of schools for thé deaf, blind, and idiots is not 
known. In 1882 there were 13 schools for the first-mentioned unfor- 
tunates, with about 50,000 pupils under instruction; 4 schools for the 
blind, and 1 for the imbecile population. Later information is not 
obtainable. 
HISTORICAL SKETCH. 
The earliest efforts towards culture in Russia may be traced as far 
back as 988, to the Byzantine Fathers, but it must be noted that the 
Russia of that period occupied only the center and southern portions 
of the present European Russia. Cyril and Methodius, two Byzantine 
Brothers, are accredited with forming the Slavonic charters, by which 
religious teachings were given to the people, and they and other broth- 
ers of the Order helped to disseminate a knowledge of reading and 
writing. The ravages of the Tartars from the Eastern Steppes soon 
checked the efforts of the Byzantines, but the invaders were tolerant of 
other religions, and through their efforts monasteries and convents 
were established, which were not, however, seats of great learning. The 
first school, connected with a monastery at Kief, dates from the fifteenth 
century; the second from 1629 in Moscow, which school had among its 
_teachers some of the monks from the Kief monastery. About this time 
the Polish influence began to be felt, and the Greek orthodox believers 
had to contend with the Roman Catholic influence as brought into the

country by the Poles, who laid the Rondo of the qi esuit schools of 
the early part of the seventeenth century. At the same date Russian 
schools were established on about the same plan as those of the Jesuits. 
The most famous of these were the Greek-Latin-Slavonic school at 
Kief, and the Latin-Greek school at Moscow, both of which aimed to 
instruct in two languages and in philosophy and theology. It is, how- 
ever, usually considered that the earliest efforts to educate the people 
date from Peter the Great (1689-1725), for he brought Russia into rela- 
tion with the nations of Europe by sending men to other countries to 
study, and by attracting men to Russia who were recognized as author- 
ities in different branches of learning. He also established special 
technical schools for engineers and for naval science, military and naval 
schools—the naval academy at St. Petersburg in 1715—and a few 
people’s schools. He also founded schools for the clergy, for nobles 
(whom he did not permit to marry unless they could read), and for civil 
servants or Tchinoyniks. 
It was Peter the Great who ordered obligatory instruction, and who 
intended by this method to place the Russian nation on a level with 
other European nations. He even ordered the alphabet to be changed 
from the Slavonic to the modern Russian characters, but the older lan- 
guage has still to be learned in all schools. The German influence | 
datés from Peter the Great’s reign,! and it was still quite apparent up 
to the reign of Elizabeth (1741-1761), but this Empress encouraged the 
study of the French language and literature, and in 1757 the founding 
of the Academy of Fine Arts in St. Petersburg was the means of 
bringing to Russia French painters, who did much towards strength- 
ening the French influence. 
During the reign of Catharine II (1762-1796) popular lay schools were 
established in many districts and towns, as also gymnasia for second- 
ary instruction, and plans were made for the founding of three—uni- 
versities, the University of Moscow having already been founded in 
1755. 
Tn 1782 a commission was appointed to study the necessary meas- 
ures for organizing elementary education in Russia. Its decision was 
to create two divisions, one having four-year courses for well-to-do peo- 
ple, the other having a two years’ course for the poorer classes. The 
need of good teachers was so noticeable, however, that in 1786 the 
right of opening and teaching school was only accorded to those who 
could give proof of capacity. During the reign of Catharine II the 
convent at Smolna was established. This was the first of the famous | 
  
1 The most famous German schools which haye for over a century exerted a great 
influence are those of St. Peter, St. Catharine, St. Anne, and of the Reformed Church 
in St. Petersburg. They are now subject to rules laid down by the ministry of pub- 
lic instruction and rank with the gymnasia. Their students have always been 
highly trained. Moscow, too, has had two similar schools, dating from 1601 and 1668. 
The courses in these are more like the Realschool of the present day.

  _ institutes for girls which are now found in different divisions of Rus- 
sia, and to Catharine may be assigned the first efforts to educate — 
_ daughters of nobles, the aim of Peter having been to educate the 
noblesand their sons. The advancement of education was most marked, 
_ however, under Alexander I, and in 1802 the first administrative organ- 
ization was attempted through the creating of the office of minister of — 
popular enlightenment. This ministry took the place of the committee 
or.council of education established by Catharine IT, and the duties were 
to organize a school system, to encourage the propagation of knowledge, 
and to inculcate philanthropic ideas. 
In 1803 many communal schools were transformed into gymnasia, 
established upon the plan of those in Germany. The following year a 
decree prescribed the opening of more schools on lands belonging to the 
government or to the nobles, and even the clergy offered to aid in the 
educational development of the masses. As an outcome of the estab- — 
lishment of a ministry of popular enlightenment or public instruction, — 
the Empire was divided (in 1802-1803) into school circuits, which con- 
sisted of the centering of the educational institutions of different prov- 
inces around the universities. This centralization was aided by the 
appointment in each circuit or district of an official who communicated 
directly with and represented the ministry in that section. The univer- 
sity centers were at first Moscow, Vilna, and Dorpat; later camé St. — 
Petersburg, Kazan, Kharkof, and Kief. In the cities four class gym- 
nasia were opened; in the districts two class schools to prepare for the 
gyimnasia. Then there were parish schools, with simple instruction 
preparing for the district schools. The Emperor was so intent upon 
the education of lis people that he decreed that no one should become 
a civil servant unless he pass through a gymnasium. 
In 1819 school fees were introduced as follows: $2.79 for parish — 
schools, $5.58 in district schools, $8.37 in gymnasia. These fees 
were used to pay teachers’ salaries, to furnish awards for study and 
good conduct, and for pensions. In 1819 the University of St. Peters- 
burg was developed from an earlier established pedagogical college 
which was suspended in that year. This college was reopened again 
- in 1829, and kept open until 1859-60, when a course of pedagogical 
Jectures was instituted in its place. This institution in all its phases 
aided greatly the cause of education and had many students, but it 
was eventtally changed into the Historico-Philological Institute of 
1867, described elsewhere. 
As far back as 1828 energetic measures were attempted by the Gov- 
ernment, which sought to bring all schools within the bounds of a 
central administration. A law of 1835 reorganized the universities so 
that they became teaching bodies rather than administrative bodies, | 
and placed all the schools under the control of curators of school cir- 
cuits, whose duties extended over several governments at a time. 
From 1834 to 1839 the subject of Real or modern schools was discussed,

as the classical schools, or gymnasia, did not suit the needs of all the — 
people. Nicholas I (1825-55) in his endeavor to quell the revolu- 
. tionary ideas which were widely disseminated between 1812 and 1848, — 
wished to abolish or reduce the state universities, but the decadence 
was so complete after the Crimean war that he found - necessary to 
reorganize classical education. 
During the reign of Alexander IL (1855-81) there was marked 
progress apparent, for with the emancipation of the serfs in 1860 came 
a call for more schools, as prior to 1864 elementary schools were only 
established in small centers. In 1864 a law for the establishment of 
elementary schools was promulgated. This law, or statute, created 
three grades of education: Elementary (parish and city schools), see-_ 
ondary (progymnasia, gymnasia, and Real schools), higher (technical 
and the universities). These schools were to be administered by the 
minister of public instruction, his deputy, the minister’s council, the — 
director of the different divisions, the presiding officer of the learned_ 
committee, and the curator of the different circuits. In 1867 the over- 
sight of elementary schools was given to the zemstvo and other local 
authorities, and in every district a school board was formed. 
Ags supervisor of the district board there was the provincial council 
consisting of five members, two of which represented the zemstyos, 
two the tchinovniks, and the fifth the religious authorities or bishops. 
The duties of the last were to oversee the religious instruction in the 
common schools, but the bishop depended upon the village priests for 
all information, and these priests had the authority to visit the schools 
and give advice to the teachers, and if matters were not satisfactory to 
so report to.either bishop or tchinovnik. As will be observed, the cen- 
tral authorities were trying to bring about better codperation between 
the authorities and the schools, but the members of the scheel councils 
seemed apathetic, meetings of councils became more rare and the min- 
ister found himself without the means of knowing the number or 
condition of the schools. The result of this state of things was that 
the minister decided, in 1869, to create inspectors of elementary grades, 
and in 1874 the school councils were placed under the general charge 
of the minister of public instruction, the central authorities, in a 
sense, assuming control of education throughout the Empire. The 
laicisation of education was not a question in Russia, the clergy as a 
whole attended to their own affairs, although there were in the country 
priests who taught the peasants to read. The teaching of religion in 
the public schools was, however, separate from that of other branches. 
In less important centers of population the schools received children 
belonging to different confessions, priests of the Orthodox, Catholic, 
Protestant, Jewish, and Mohamedan religions taking part in the reli- 
gious instruction and specially examining the pupils at different periods 
in presence of some person foreign to religious orders.

       A notable point in education is that the military laws are so arranged 
in Russia that they contribute to educational progress by shortening 
_ the time spent in the army and recognizing the principle of obligatory 
instruction. The length of service is reduced from year to year accord- 
_ ing to the degree of instruction of the recruit. Those who have a cer- 
tificate of studies in the elementary grades have the length of service 
reduced from six to four years. Students of the technical or industrial 
schools and gymnasia are also favored in the same way; the former have 
only three years to serve, the latter a year andahalf. For university 
students the army life is reduced to six months. 
The establishment, by the zemstvos, of lay schools in the country, 
and the placing of a certain amount of authority over the schools in the 
hands of local assemblies, géneral councils, and municipal councils, 
were the keynotes to an amelioration of the condition of school affairs. 
The villages in Russia had their own independent form of government, 
the heads of families meeting together to discuss village affairs, and 
the decision of the Mir (er village or communal assembly) being pabioied 
as final by the members of the commune. This institution—the Mir— - 
was presided over by the village elder, who represented the executive 
power. Through his efforts and those of the assembly general interest 
in educational matters was awakened. For the period 1866-71 there 
_ was noticeable an increase of schools, changes in the number of classes 
in the gymnasia, a larger expenditure for schools in the annual budget, 
and there were discussions as to the need of more practical develop- 
ment by the establishment of Real schools. 
These progressive movements naturally led to the passing of a stat- 
ute, in 1872, creating the Real school of the present day. This statute 
_ of May 15, 1872, created schools which fitted for special industrial pro- 
fessions and for higher technical schools. While the gymnasia were 
‘practically established for students who could prolong their studies 
until 22 or 23 years of age, the Real schools were for those who could 
not attend longer than their sixteenth or seventeenth year. This-same 
Statute permitted pupils of the lower classes of gymnasia and progym- 
nasia to pass without preliminary examination into corresponding 
classes of the Realschools. By this method the child’s natural aptitudes 
were soon determined, and parents or the authorities could decide which 
class of school was best suited to the pupil’s need. These schools were 
organized on a similar plan to that of gymnasia and progymnasia— 
that is, as boarding and day school. 
In 1872 another important reform was inaugurated which transformed 
_ district schools into regular city schools. The reason for this change 
was that the district schools were not progressing as was hoped, and it — 
was decided to replace them by regularly established schools with a 
six years’ course, the main elements of instruction being the same as 
in the tyo grades of district and city schools, when all alike, were three-
-P-A-G-E-273

class schools (law of 1828). The teachers for different branches of in- 
struction were also~replaced by class teachers, each class having a 
teacher for all branches, except religion, which is under the charge of 
the clergy. The instruction was to be conducted according to well-— ; 
established methods, and it was even intended to prepare the pupils 
for certain trades and professions. Still another important move of that 
period was the giving directors of normal schools (42 at that date) 
the right of voting in provincial school councils, their presence at such y 
- meetings being considered of value in the discussion of school ques- — 
tions. And still another reform consisted in the establishment of semin- 
aries for special masters to take charge of these schools. Pedagogical 
courses, the expenses to be borne by the provincial authorities, were 
also established near gymnasia in thirteen different subdivisions of 
Russia. The exercises in these courses lasted two months and the 
aspirants for teachers’ positions were expected to learn all about. 
methods of instruction and the organization of schools in general. 
From 1872 to 1884 there were a few changes chronicled, but in the 
main they were more in detail than in any general change of base, the 
statutes of 1872 seeming to be the formation of the school system. In 
1884, however, there were movements in regard to higher education 
which have been fully presented under “Courses of study,” as these 
movements dealt more especially with methods of examination, ete. 
Graduation from the university is not a requisite for holding official 
position. Young men from good families prefer professional or military 
institutions, the school of law, the Alexander Lyceum, the corps of 
pages, etc. Many careers are however, open to the university student, 
80 that boys belonging to impoverished families oftentimes desired a 
university education. For such students there are stipends from govern- 
mental corporations, or college funds; use of the first required the 
student after graduation to serve the State for a few years, generally 
six. The poverty of the many students has a certain effect upon the 
general academic success, and this point of relieving the student from the ~ 
long struggle for a livelihood during his academic years has been freely 
discussed by the different commissions. The result of such effort is 
that through the donations and liberal aid given by the Government 
an intelligent population is kept in the universities, and the law of 1884 
has been the means of much progress in mary points of view, and the — 
examinations passed before a commission give a truer value than here- 
tofore to the diploma received. 
The parochial schools were organized in this same year, by law of. 
July 13,1884, They depend upon the clergy, are especially favorized by 
the Government, and are under the direction of the Holy Synod which 
places first and foremost in its programme “the law of God.” These 
schools are kept up in rural districts by half-religious, half-patriotic 
brotherhoods.

   _ Certain political movements! were the means of the closing or sus- 
pension of a few secondary or higher grade institutions—as on March 
24, 1879, the closing of the Medico-Chirugical Academy, on January 3, 
1880, the closing of the Institute of Civil Engineers, on April, 1890, the 
temporary closing of the University of St. Petersburg. In the higher — 
grade institutions the tendencies towards socialistic ideas are most 
noticeable, but these changes have not materially affected the general 
_ tone of educational effort. Decrees have been promulgated from time 
_ to time, which deal especially with such upheavals, such as the decree of 
~ October 15, 1891, which directed university councils to act as special 
tribunals eh the irl of students who have committed political offense 
or committed any act detrimental to the law of public safety. Efforts 
are also being made by the authorities to eliminate, as far as possible, 
the anti-Russian feeling which has developed from the years of teach- 
ing by German and French professors, and by giving a firmer basis of 
instruction from the Russian standpoint, to bring about a more patri- 
_ endeavors of the Czar to unite his subjects of all nationalities and relig- 
-jons in one common band of brotherhood. Such may be said to be the 
_ main features of education in the vast Empire of Russia. 
TECHNICAL AND ARTISAN? EDUCATION IN RUSSIAS 
By M. Anoporr, Director of the Nicholas Industrial School in St. Petersburg. 
t 
A most interesting report on technical education in Russia has been 
-eompiled by M. Anopoff, director of the Nicholas Industrial School 
in St. Petersburg. It gives an exhaustive review of all that has been 
done during the last twenty years in Russia in this important branch 
of national education, and is of special interest as furnishing informa- 
tion in regard to the most recent legislation respecting schools which 
have been or are about to be founded. M. Anopoff limits his state- 
ments to full details of intermediate and elementary technical and indus- 
- trial institutions without entering into a description of the higher 
schools. The value of this report is so obvious that quite a complete 
digest is here presented. The report is followed by a fairly complete 
-résuiné of the first congress ef technical and industrial educators, 
which was held in January, 1890, in St. Petersburg. 
“Technical and industrial education in the narrow sense in which I use the term, 
says M. Anopoff in his book on the present condition of lower grade of tech- 
nical and artisan instruction in Russia, acquired its right to recognition in com- 
1As is stated by prapienets Wallaced in his admirable work on Russia, “the Rus- 
sian educated classes are extremely impulsive,” “are fettered by no venerable histor- 
ical prejudices, and are wonderfully sensitive to the seductive influence of gran- 
_ diosé projects, especially when they excite patriotic feelings.” 
«= The artisan class forms the connecting link between the town population and the ©

_ governments, were made to answer to the needs of each government, and in the fur-     paratively recent times. From the earliest period our Government has endeayore' 
to improve general education and spread it among the people, but middle and low 
grade technical and industrial education (not taking into consideration the Prac- 
tical Technological Institute at St. Petersburg and the Imperial Technological School _ 
at Moscow, later merged into higher educational establishments) did not begin earlier 
than a quarter of a century ago. Nor is this statement discredited in any way by 
the fact that prior to that time there existed some low, middle, and special high” 
grade educational establishments, since such establishments existed for purposes” 
which, with a general resemblance, differed much in detail from those that constitute 
the essence of technical and industrial education, The explanation of thismust — 
be sought in the fact that these establishments, belonging as they did to different — 
ther fact of the lack of a unified system of general education. The only exceptions 
to the narrow and special ‘character of the above-named establishments were afforded 
by the special extra classes and commercial divisions of the Realschools (changed 
from Real gymnasia by edict of May 15, 1872) and by the second-class and first-class 
village, district, and city schools (edict of May 31, 1872). 
Twenty-five years seems a very short period in which to establish the general work. 
of popular education on a firm footing ané to achieve the results anticipated by the 
promoters of the work, yet the statistics affurd abundant proof of the development 
of technical and industrial education, and of its spread to the remotest parts of the 
Empire. This success in educational work is due to several causes; to the zeal of 
the Government in carrying it on; to the industrial progress made ey the country; _ 
and, finally, to the manner in erie the efforts of the Government have been 
seconded by the city and district authorities, by various societies, and by private 
individuals. 
' This constant opening of new establishments and the consequent inerease in their 
number soon necessitated some general plan of organization for technical and in- 
dustrial education, and the task of drawing up such a plan was conferred, by an 
-edict of the Imperial Council of February 21, 1878, upon the ministry of finances. 
In 1881 an imperial order was issued for the transfer of most of the above-mentioned 
establishments from the ministry of finances to the ministry of public instruction, — 
in which a special division was formed in 1883 for technical and industrial educa- — 
tion. To this special division was given the work of drawing up the general 
educational programme, and of elaborating measures for insuring a better direction 
of educational forces generally. The principal regulations for the industrial schools, 
presented to the Imperial Council by the minister of public instruction, received 
imperial sanction in 1888, and the minister was instructed to form a special tempo- 
rary commission from the representatives of the ministries of public instruction, 
finance, internal affairs, and imperial domaims, to indicate the localities in which 
industrial schools ought to be opened at the expense of the Government, to deter- 
mine the special subjects which they should teach, and to outline the rules and reg- 
ulations by which these schools should be guided, This commission met under the — 
presidency of Mr. Ilyin, director of the St. Petersburg Technological Institute, and 
its work, after being examined by the Imperial Council, received imperial sanction 
on June 26, 1889. 
The new edict for the Realschools, of date 1888, does away Saat all the special 
extra departments in them, with the exception of those for commercial education, 
and in place of these divisions it requires the opening, at Government expense, of | 
_ technical and artisan schools of the middle and low ee: Though these schools 
are required to observe the strictly defined plan drawn up for them, they still have 
the benefit of the results of the long practical experience of existing schools, whose _ 
_ work began and has been carried on under less favorable eeu Aclose study 
  of these establishments affords an opportunity to borrow the most beneficial fea-— 
tures from them and to save the new schools from the errors which interfered with 
the development of the older schools, sy

   Any adequate review of existing middle and lower grado technical and indus- 
and partial descriptions; it must present the amplest and most exact details regard- 
ing the schools; it must fully describe each of them, showing the results reached 
and the causes that interfere to prevent normal and further development. With 
these ends in view special attention is given to the history and growth of the various 
schools as well as to the interest shown in them by local societies, since it is to   
to owe their-origin and often the contributions necessary to carry them on. The 
present sketch deals only with boys’ schools of higher, middle, and lower grade 
which have been founded to prepare artisans and factory workers. In other 
ords, it has as its object the study of those new schools whose beginning dates back 
ythe sixties, but which have up to the present failed to supply any positive and 
definite answers to the questions put to them regarding the degree of success they 
have attained in carrying out the objects for which they were founded. 
- The whole of the above-mentioned establishments for technical and industrial 
education are divided, according to the objects they have in view, into five groups: 
FIRST GROUP: 
The technical schools, whose course is that of the middle grade educational estab- 
lishments. They resemble the Realschools, and have special departments according 
to the edict of 1872, but differ from them in giving greater prominence to profes- 
sional studies. These technical schools make the same demands upon pupils as do 
the Realschools, and have a course whose period extends from six to eight years. 
: Their aim is to provide the lads entering them with a general education, and 
also with that amount of technical and commercial knowledge which is necessary 
to qualify them for positions as assistant engineers or for acting as foremen in any of 
the smaller industrial enterprises. ‘Those who pass through the full course in these 
schools have the right to enter the high special educational establishments on the 
same footing as the pupils of the gymnasia and the Realschools; while in the mat- 
ter of military service, they enjoy the privileges of the pupils of the educational 
establishments of the first two ranks.!_ The pupils, besides taking part in the class 
_ studies, occupy themselves in the mechanical workshops or the chemical lab ra- 
_ tories; considerable importance is also given to inspection of factories and practice 
only three schools: I, the high-grade artisan school at Lodzi; Il, the technical 
_ school at Irkutsk, and III, the Kommissaroff Technical School at Moscow. 
To the list of the middle-grade technical schools, however, may be added the estab- 
lishment at Omsk and Kungursk, though the imperial edict classifies them with 
_ schools here placed in the second group. Yet in reality the Omsk and the Kungursk 
establishments differ from the schools of Cherepovetz, Simbirsk, and a few others, 
_ inasmuch as they require from pupils seeking admission proficiency in the course 
_ either of the city schools (edict of May 31, 1872) or of the district schools, while the 
other middle-grade technical establishments demand from pupils a mere knowledge of 
the course of the primaryschools. There is also the difference that, while at Omsk 
and Kungursk the pupils are taught the full course in algebra and trigonometry, 
these subjects do not enter into the course of the ‘other schools, which in their 
general aims resemble the low-grade technical schools. The school at Lodzi, during 
_ its twenty years of existence, has educated 287 pupils, while the school at Irkutsk, 
during a period of seventy-six years, has graduated 91 pupils. If to these totals we 
add the 38 pupils graduating from the Komissaroff and Omsk schools, we shall find 
that in a period of seventeen years these four educational establishments prepared 
about 450 young men, who have since aided in the development of the national indus-

                                                          jal educational establishments in Russia can not be limited to incidental facts

      tries. About 35 per cent of the eaten are gostouine their, education, or have 
. already completed it, at the high-grade special educational establishments; 40 per 
cent are engaged in varioustrade and industrial enterprises, while 25 per cent have — 
turned aside from the special occupations for which the school fitted them to other 
callings. 
SECOND GROUP. 
To this group belong educational establishments in which such subjects of ge 
eral education are taught as are found in the programmes of city, district, and two- 
class village schools. For admission to these establishments the knowledge de- 
manded is such as is given in the lower elementary schools, the course oceupying 
from four to six years, according to the information possessed by the pupil at his — 
entrance. In the matter of military service, pupils are given the privilege of the 
third rank,! with the exception of the Nicholas Artisan School at St. Petersburg, — 
which enjoys still higher military privileges. The programme of subjects, so far as 
general education is concerned, is not fuller than the programme of the city schools, 
as settled by the edict of May 31, 1872; butin addition tosuch general educational sub- 
jects, thereare taught in the schools of this group physics, mechanics, the technology 
of metals and wood, bookkeeping, and other special subjects; the study of drawing 
and drafting also occupies a conspicuous place in the curriculum. Itis the aim of 
these establishments to prepare master workmen for the factories, specialists in the 
ruder kinds of mechanical work, machinists, and draftsmen. A graduate from one 
of these schools has no right to enter the high special establishments, although — 
tle wide scope of his study leads him to desire to extend his education. In the 
greater part of the establishments there are systematic courses for the study of 
cabinet-making and carving. The cost of maintaining such courses is very great, — 
and so, owing to want of means, the pupils learn their trade by doing work for 
customers. Many of the pupils after graduating enter the low-grade schools as 
teachers of trades, and so the establishments of this group, though not designed to — 
prepare teachers of trades, and not having special classes for this purpose, yet seem ad 
to discharge the function of seminaries for the preparation of instructors in trades. 
A large number of these establishments often have boarding pupils. To this group _ 
belong the Alexandrovsky Technical School in the city of Cherepovetz, the Artisan 
School of Count Orloff-Davidoff in Simbirsk, and the Czarevich Nicholas Artisan — 
School at St. Petersburg; also the various technical railroad schools of the country, 
but as these latter are under the control of the minister of ways of communication, 
and by being restricted in their aims, satisfy the needs of the railroad service, Tho — 
description of them does not enter into the object of the present work, 
THIRD GROUP. 
This group includes the artisan schools, with a curriculum of general educational 
subjects which resemble that of the elementary schools, and sometimes approaches . 
in character the course of the two-class village schools. The majority of theschools _ 
of this group receive pupils who have graduated from the elementary schools. The 
establishments in this division aie founded for the purpose of preparing master 
workmen in the ‘‘ bush” or domestic industry, in the various industrial occupations 
of the village, and in factories. They give instruction in cabinet-making, black- 
smithing, carpentry, carving, tailoring, shoemaking, bookbinding, harness-making, 
etc.; but only a very few of them can pretend to any systematic teaching of the 
trades, and the pupils learn their business by requesting orders from customers, 
They utilize the summer vacation by occupying themselves in the workshops during 
that period. In Group u delicacy of finish in the work done i is indispensable, but 
in the present group it is not insisted upon. Boarding establishments exist in con- 
  
' Described on-page 199,
-P-A-G-E-278
    nection with only a few of the schools; in the majority the pupils are day scholars. 
    
       
    
   
    
       
     
         
    
        
   
      
             
      
    
    
   in Vladimir, Nizhni-Novgorod, Tver, ete.; further, such model workshops as that at 
‘amboff, the Birsky Technical school, and so on. 
The schools of second and third groups, while resembling each other in their aims, 
“vary greatly in their organization, as well as in the character of the general and 
ecial education which they give. One meets among them, in fact, very different 
ypes of educational establishments, beginning with the low-grade technical schools 
and ending with the practical artisan workshops, without any provision for class 
struction, even in writing and drawing. During the educational year 1888~89 
the schools of these two groups expended no less a sum than 875,000 rubles 
($488,250) in educating over 5,000 pupils, about 2,000 of whom were boarding pupils. 
the pupils were prepared for the various trades in the following proportion: For 
ee __ locksmithing, 45 per cent; foundry’ work, 1.5 per cent; lathe turning, 1 per cent; 
Dlacksmithing, 3 per cent; cabinetmaking, 28 per cent; wood-carving, 2 per cent; 
shoe and harness making, 6 per cent oe iediee: ing, 1.5 per cent; Hagkbingine, less 45h 
1per cent. About 4,433 pupils naked through the course, distributed, by trade, as 
follows: Locksmiths, 45 per cent; cabinetmakers, 20 per cent; shoemakers, 4 per 
cent; tailors, 0.15 per cent; bookbinders, 0.8 per cent. 
FOURTH GROUP. 
- To this group belong the various special and general educational schodls for adults, 
suchas the building school,-the school of printing, the evening and Sunday special ~ 
classes of the Imperial Technical Society of St. Petersburg, and the artisan school 
at Riga. Instruction is given in the evenings and Sundays, when the working men 
are not occupied. Those who successfully pass through the course are entitled to 
the privilege of third or fourth rank! in military service, according to the degree of 
education received. 
FIFTH GROUP. 
This group includes the general educational low-grade establishments, comprising 
elementary, district, and city schools, with the extra “artisan” departments 
attached to them. 
- In order to increase facilities for technical and artisan education in Russia, the 
Minister of Public Instruction in 1872 transformed the Realgymnasia into Realschools 
with special complementary classes, and almost simultaneously introduced instruc- 
_ tion in trades into the teachers’ seminaries and into the low-grade schools. The 
regulations for the city schools (dated 31st ‘of May, 1872) provide that pupils in 
such schools, when their parents desire it, may oceupy themselves with trades like 
bookbinding and wood carving, with a oe to the development of technical skill. 
The regulations also contain the following provisions: ‘When societies or pri- 
vate individuals in cities intimate their willingness to defray half the cost of 
practical instruction in trades and arts at the city,schools, the Minister of Public In- 
struction will communicate with the Minister of Finances with a view to the grant- 
ing of a subsidy for such purpose to the amount of not more than: 300 rubles ($167) a 
ear for each school.” In the instructions issued by the Minister of Public Instrue- 
tion (June 4, 1875) for the two-class and one-class village schools the following pro- 
visions occur: ‘Into the one and two-class schools, according tothe means which 
_ they may have at their disposal, is introduced the teaching of trades and arts for 
boys and handiwork for the girls. Inschools where the necessary facilities exist the 
pupils may also be instructed in kitchen and market gardening. One-class and 
_ two-class schools are opened by the Minister of Public Instruction in those locali-

    Dhls group includes the artisan schools of Kazan, Orenburg, Kishineff, Irbit, ete; 
 
-P-A-G-E-279
      - amount to defray the cost of instruction and materials, such amount bee supple- 
mental to the grant made by the Government; but where local societies and private 
persons fail to make up the sum needed the Minister of Public Instruction ma; 
assign a further amount, equal to from 100 ($55) to 140 rubles ($78). Instruction in 
trades and arts is placed in the hands of the state inspectors of people’s schools or of | 
competent persons approved of by them. Instruction in the trades and arts is paid 
at the rate of 160 rubles ($89) annually in the two-class.and 140 rubles ($78) in. 
the one-class schools. The choice of the particular trades, arts, and handiwork © — 
to be taught at any school is left with the local society and the state inspector, 
while occupation in such branchesis obligatory only for those children whose parents — 
or representatives desire it. All tools and apparatus necessary for the teaching of 
“trades are to be purchased by the inspector, in consuléation with the instructor, at 
the cost of the local promoters of the school, who are also expected to meet the ex- 
pense of renewing such tools and apparatus. ‘Money received from the sale of work 
done by pupils is to be applied to the purchase of workshop materials, any residue 
being turned over to the reserve funds of the school. If a school has no workshop, 
the necessary facilities must be provided; but work must not be done in the class. 
rooms, even when the lesson is being given. The pupils are to receive their instruc- 
tion in trades or handiwork at times when they are free from lessons, and they must 
be taught either all together or in divisions on different days, according to the size 
of the rooms, the number of the tools, and the quantity of the materials available. 
Only children who attend school are allowed to participate in the occupations of | 
the workshops. The tools and materials used aro regarded as the property of the 
school. Instructors must be present in the workshop or at the trade and handiwork 
classes, relieving one another as may be necessary. In schools which have an hon- 
orary trustee, that official may watch over the industrial occupations of the pupils, 
if he so desires. The number of hours during which instruction shall be given is — 
_ left to the honorary trustee, the teachers of the school, and the instructors in thi 
trade desired. When possible, each school ought to have connected with it a garden 
or kitchen garden and a beehive, for instruction of the children, when out of 
school, in gardening and beekeeping, though this is at the option of their parents 
or guardians.” — 
_ In accordance with these provisions, artisan departments were opened in the city 
schools (edict of May 31, 1872) and in the primary schools, the number being as 
follows: In the district schools—7 in 1881, 11 in 1882, 10 in 1883, 48 in 1884; in the 
city schools—28 in 1882, 31 in 1883, 37 in 1884; in the primary schools—573 in 1881, — 
638 in 1882, 814 in 1883, and 747 in 1884. In the year 1885 there existed 217 district 
schools, with 16,969 male pupils, of whom 2,524 graduated and 3,683 left before — 
finishing the course. There were also 85 two-class city schools and other estab- 
lishments having the rights of district schools, with 5,068 male pupils. of whom 672 
graduated and 1,304 left school before finishing the course. There were in thesame — 
year 321 of the city schools established under the edict of May 31,1872, and these - 
were attended by 38,919 male pupils, of whom 2,234 graduated and.8,097 left school _ 
before finishing the course. The artisan classes in all these 623 schools numbered ~ 
85. Each district school had an average of 78 pupils, of whom 17 graduated. 
Each city school averaged 121 pupils, but owing to the fact that many of the city 
schools were but.recently opened, there has been practically no time for graduation. 
- Of the number of those who left school from the above-mentioned establishments 30 
per cent were graduates. 
On January 1, 1885, there were 24,209 primary schools in existence, including 
23,404 one-class and 805 two-class schools. The attendance included 1,466,913 pupils’ 
of both sexes—94,589 at the two-class establishments and 1,372,324 in those of one-_ 
elass., In other words, each two-class school ‘had 117 pupils and each one-class 
school 58. Of the total number of pupils the boys constituted 79 per cent, or 
1,152,516, and the girls 21 per cent, or 314,397. The boys in the village schools num-

118; 829, or 8.1 per cent of the whole number of pupils. This remarkably large per- — 
centage of pupils who leave school without graduating—and do so in increasing 
_ numbers, despite the fact that graduation confers privileges in connection with 
litary service that are highly valued among the village population—is to be ex- 
lained not by the indifference of the villagers to education, but by such domestic 
and. economic conditions as make it impossible for the peasant to keep his children 
at school during the three or more years necessary for the course.

edge, at Moscow. 
Fifth group.—Artisan departments established by the edict of May 31, 1872, in the — 
city schools and the two-class and one-class village schools, 
The cost of maintaining these people’s or elementary schools in 1885 was 12,764,496 
rubles ($7,122,588). To this amount there was contributed: From the state treas- 
ury, 9.2 per cent; from the cities, 17.9 per cent; from village societies, 24,6 per cent; 
from district assemblies (zemstvos), 35.8 per cent; by donations, 7.6 per cent; from 
school funds, 2.5 per cent; from other sources, 2.4 per cent. Up to January 1, 1885, 
there existed, in connection with the people’s schools, 747 artisan departments, dis- 
tributed among the various educational circuits as follows: St. Petersburg, 86; 
Moscow, 145; Kharkof, 56; Kazan, 58; Vilna, 40; Kief, 87; Odessa, 142; Orenburg, 
57; Dorpat, 19; Caucasus, 57. The inspectors of the educational circuits point out — 
that progress in artisan instruction in the people’s schools is slow owing to the fact 
that the pupils are for the most part between the ages of 8 and 11, and they are, in 
fact, too young for the heavy work of trade occupations. Moreover, in some locali- — 
ties, the peasants do not approve of instruction in trades in the schools on the ground 
that when their children acquire trades in this manner their knowledge draws them — 
away from the village—where they are needed to cultivate the land and take part in 
field work—to the workshops of the city, where they can earn money, a migration — 
which, in view of the smallness of peasant families is held to be ruinous to agriculture, 
- The number of low-grade schools with artisan departments, and the attendance in 
the various- educational circuits were enumerated in 1888 as follows: Moscow, 110 
schools and 2,621 pupils; Caucasus, 81 schools and 1,771 pupils; Odessa, 78 schools 
and 1,723 pupils; St. Petersburg, 101 schools and 1,384 pupils; Kharkof, 42 schools 
and 989 pupils; Kazan, 49 schools and 764 pupils; Orenburg, 35 schools and 660 
pupils; Vilensk, 32 schools and 551 pupils; Kief, 13 schools and 267 pupils; Turkes- _ 
tan, 8 schools and 210 pupils; West Siberia, 11 schools and 161 pupils; Warsaw, 4 
schools and 127 pupils; Eastern Siberia, 1 school and 10 pupils. The total number i ir 
of artisan departments and the number of pupils learning various trades in these 
schools were as follows: Cabinetmaking, 289 departments and 4,875 pupils; carpen- 
try, 1 department and 15 pupils; wood-turning, 6 departments and 64 pupils; wood-

‘worm culture, 38 departments and 365 pupils; different kinds of horticulture, 43 
departments and 556 pupils; grape-growing and wine culture, 1 department and 16 
_ pupils. 
The learning of trades in these schools i is not obligatory, and the number of work- 
ing hours varies from one to twenty-four a week, depending on the amount of ac- 
commodation and the means available, Tedeeecuee! in trades has to be often given 
in haif-lighted rooms, while in some cases the trade lessons havé to be taught in the 
kitchen of the schoolmaster’s house. On the other hand, there are schools which 
‘possess a fine equipment for the purpose. The summer vacation is, for trade instruc- 
tion, a period of activity or inactivity, according to circumstances. Some of the 
schools spend not more than 50 or 60 rubles ($27 to $33) annually in the teaching of : 
"trades, while others expend 200 rubles ($111) and upwards. Trade instructors re- f 
ceive from 50 to 480 rubles ($27 to $267) a year. Some of the schools teach trades 
_ gratis, and this is especially the case in bookbinding, which is often taught by the 
schoolmaster himself. The productive yield of the school workshop varies greatly; 
at times it amounts to as much as 1,000 or 2,000 rubles ($558 to $1,116). There isa 
great lack of method in the teaching, and it is very difficult to obtain competent in- 
structors, so difficult, in fact, that in some cases artisan departments have had to be 
closed. This was the case in Vologd4, Kursk, and a few other governments. In 
__ many of the schools pupils in the artisan departments receive a share of the profit 
yielded by the workshop, an arrangement which keeps the bigger boys at school ~~ 
much longer than they would otherwise remain, since without the inducement — 
named they would, after acquiring a mere elementary knowledge of their trade, 
seek occupation in private workshops. 
In Mr. Anopoff’s report the question is fully discussed as to whether the comple- 
mentary artisan departments opened in the low-grade educational establishments 
s _ accomplish their purpose, and the answer is given in the negative. The defects of 
_ the system, as pointed out in 1884 by one of the directors of the people’s schools, are 
as follows: (1) The pupils are too young to acquire trades; (2) the educational 
course is too short to give anything like thorough instruction in trade; (3) the 
hours given to trade instruction each day, being limited by the general educational 
work to the afternoon, are too few in number; (4) the nonobligatory character of 
_ the instruction leads to a constant decrease in the number of pupils, and causes the 
workshops to be regarded by the boys as a place for diversion rather than forinstruc- 
tion; (5) parents evidently take the same view of the trade work of the schools, 
since after boys have gone through the general educational course, they are gener- 
ally withdrawn without being allowed to enter the school workshops. 
In bringing this sketch of the artisan work in low-grade schools to a close Mr. 
opoff remarks: ‘‘ We can not help expressing our regret at the unfavorable con- 
itions in which they are placed. They are in the majority of cases under the con- 
trol and direction merely of the state inspectors and teachers of the people’s schools; 
that is to say, of persons who have no special knowledge of the teaching of trades, 
_ and thus have to leave everything to the trade instructors. Yet, in those exceptional 
cases where the state inspectors and school-teachers had the requisite knowledge of 
trade instruction, the artisan departments in the schools gave quite different re- 
sults.” As a remedy Mr. Anopoff finally suggests the placing of the artisan depart- 
ments under expert instruction and guidance. 
Typical schools.—The Lodzi (Warsaw) high-grade artisan school, belonging to the 
_ first group, is a transformed Realschool of six classes. It is to provide, for lads who

  _ . special training iy its higher classes as will fit them for such artisan and industrial *s     receive their preliminary general education in the lower classes of the school, such 
         
        
  work as is demanded by varying local conditions. The length of the course is six 
years. Children who can read and write Russian, repeat the principal prayers, and 
are familiar with arithmetic as far as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and 
division are concerned, are received in the first class if they are not younger than 10 
years of age. The first three classes are taught religion, Russian language and 
literature, history of Russia, German language, universal geography, geography of 
Russia, zodlogy, botany, mineralogy, arithmetic, algebra, geometry, caligraphy, _ 
drawing, and drafting. The three higher classes learn, in addition to the subjects 
named, trigonometry, lineal geometry, commercial correspondence, accounts, phys- : 
ics, chemistry, chemical technology, instruction in machines, mechanical technology, 
weaving, spinning, and dyeing. The pupils of the school may be divided according 
to their religious belief, as follows: Orthodox Greek, 5 per cent; Roman Catholics, 
45.5 per cent; Lutheran, 38.5 per cent; Hebrews, 11 per cent. The number of pupils 
in attendance at the opening of the school was 147; this gradually increased until 
at present, counting those who attend the “ parallel” departments in the four lower — 
classes, the number is 330. Of the 1,324 persons who entered the school during the | 
twenty years of its existence, 287, or 21.6 per cent, graduated; 710, or 53.6 per cent, 
left before finishing the course; the remaining 25 per cent are still at school. of 
the 28,000 rubles ($15,624) annually given to maintain the school, 21,000 rubles 
($11,638) are contributed by the Government, 1,380 rubles ($770) by a special fund, 
_ and 5,000 ($2,790) by the city society. Placing the annual average of pupils at 340, — 
the cost of maintenance amounts to about 77 rubles ($42) for each year; while if 
we divide the 500,000 rubles ($279,000) spent in maintaining the school since its — 
foundation among the 287 pupils which it has graduated, the result will show an 
annual expenditure for each pupil of 350 rubles ($195). 
The Alexander Technical School at Cherepovetz, belonging to the second group, 
was established in 1868 by the brothers Milutin, received a state subsidy of 7,000 
rubles ($3,906) annually to the year 1871, and two years later came under the com- 
plete control of the government. The aim of the school, as defined by regulations 
of March 27, 1884, is to train pupils to become master locksmiths, cabinetmakers, 
machine-makers, machinists, and factory draftsmen. The school is under the con- 
trol of the department of trade and manufactures; its director is appointed by the 
minister of finance from the successful graduates of the high-grade technical educa- 
tional establishments. The cost of maintaining the school is defrayed partly by a 
government subsidy of 40,000 rubles ($27,860) annually, and partly by an annual 
“appropriation of 3,850 rubles ($2,148) obtained from a fund established to provide 
scholarships. It is also maintained in part by pupils fees, by the sale of the indus- _ 
trial products of the school, and by donations. The pupils are divided into day and 
boarding pupils. They either pay for their education, or are instructed and main- 
tained free of cost, according to circumstances. “The full course is six years, four of 
them being devoted to theory and practice in the industyial branches taught, and 
the remaining two to acquiring proficiency in some special line of work. ‘Those who 
are to become master machinists enter the government factory connected with the 
school, while others may avail themselves of practice on board the steamboats dur-- 
ing the season of open navigation. The pupils’ enter the lowest class from 12 to 14 : 
years of age, the conditions of entrance being a knowledge of the catechism and 
Biblical history; the power to read the church texts and write in Russian without — 
many errors; a knowledge of, elementary arithmetic in its first four divisions. The 
branches taught are religion, Russian language, geography, arithmetic, history, ele- 
ments of physics, mechanics, the technology of metals and wood as applied to the 
construction of machines; instruction in building materials, drafting, drawing, — 
ealigraphy, gymnastics, and singing, the latter being an optional snignae also. On 
the practical side the pupils are instructed in lock and cabinet making, as well as 
   
-P-A-G-E-284
  y blacksmithing, and they are instructed how to produce various articles of industry. 
‘The number of pupils received from 1869, the date of the opening of the school, to 
1882.was 421. In the year 1888 there were ‘100 boarding pupils in the school, each pay-- 
ing 180 rubles ($100) a year, in addition to an entrance fee of 20 rubles ($11), and 
1 day pupils, paying 12 rubles ($6.69) a year. Each boarding pupil costs the school 
330 rubles ($184) and each day pupil 160 rubles ($87) annually. 
The Alexander artisan school at Kazan, belonging to the third group, was opened 
January 20, 1881, itsobject being the intellectual, moral, and industrial education of 
artisans. The length of ‘the course is six years; those who graduate receive the 
title of under-master and enjoy privileges of the fourth class as regards military 
service. In addition to trades, the pupils learn the following subjects: Religion, 
Russian language, arithmetic, ealigraphy, elements of Russian history, geography, 
and natural history. The trades taught are: Cabinetmaking, leatherwork, wood- 
carving, lock-making, blacksmithing, tinkering, shoemaking, and tailoring. The 
‘instruction in these branches is mainly patna aod those who acquire cabinetmak- 
‘ing, locksmithing, lathework, and blacksmithing also learn drawing and drafting. 
Thirty-six hours every week is given to the learning of trades. The pupils were 
divided according to age in 1888 as follows: There were 7 from 12 up to 14, 45 from 
13 to 16, 40 from 16 to 18, 11 who were 18 years old, and 3 over19. Sixty per cent of 
the total number of pupils belonged to the city population, 11 percent were the 
children of peasants, 26 per cent were from various classes of the people, while 10 
per cent represented the privileged classes. The school spends annually in its work 
about 6,000 rubles ($3,348), divided as follows: Inspector, 1,000 rubles. ($558); 
teacher of educational subjects, 550 rubles ($306)); lessons in drafting, 200 rubles 
($111); ten instructors of trades, 2,800 rubles ($1,562); establishment expenses, 150 
"rubles ($83); materials and instruments, 600 rubles ($334). The cost of instruc- 
tion does not exceed 58 rubles ($32) annually for each pupil, while the cost per pupil 
_ for the six-year course is about 350 rubles ($195). The cost of maintaining the 
- school is defrayed by the following annual contributions: From the local society, 
5,000 rubles ($2,790); fund for providing poor pupils with scholarships, 500 rubles 
- ($279); from the municipality, 500 rubles ($279). Instruction is gratis to pupils 
living in the city; to pupils coming from other towns a charge is made. The school 
is under the control of the city council, the actual direction of it being in the hands 
of a committee of five trustees, three being chosen by the municipality and two by 
the city residents. 
The artisan school at Riga, belonging to the fourth group, arose out of the initia- 
tive of the Industrial Society of Riga (Gewerbe Verein), an organization started in 
_ 1866 for the moral, intellectual, and industrial improvement of its members. Hay- 
ing become aware of a gradual lowering of the moral tone of the Riga artisans, and 
of the bad quality of much of their work, the above-named society petitioned for 
the foundation of a school in which artisans could be trained in the evenings and 
-on Sundays, and the result was the opening of the Riga artisan school. The edict 
_ establishing this school jwas promulgated on December 3, 1875. This school, in 
. which instruction is given on week-day evenings and every Sunday morning, has 
two departments, the preparatory and the special. The first consists of four classes 
swith a one-year course, the second of three classes, and there is also a high special 
elass with a two-years course. The subjects taught in the preparatory department 
correspond with the course of the primary schools, while in general educational 
subjects the course of the special department corresponds with that of the district 
schools. Pupils entering the preparatory department must not be younger than 11 
years; those entering the special department must indicate proficiency in the sub- 
jects taught in the preparatory department. The ‘pupils in the higher classes are 
divided according to their trades into three departments: (1) Workers in metal; (2)_ 
_ ¢abinetmakers; (3) carpenters and builders. The statistics for 1888 show the ages 
of the pupils to have been as follows: From 12 to 14 years, 15 per cent of the pupils; 
    
-P-A-G-E-285
" 32 per cent from 14 to 16; 42 per cent from 16 to 19; i per cent from 19 to 31. Ac : 
      cording to oceupation, the pupils were divided thus: Cabinetmakers, 10 per cent; . 
  carpenters, 10 per cent; painters, 10 per cent; locksmiths, mechanics, and plack- es ai 
_ smiths, 25 per cent; printers, 10 per cent; shoemakers and tailors, 10 percent; ma- ue 
sons, 25 per cent. = 
~ received as tuition fees. The pupils pay from 3 to 5 rubles ($1.67 to $2.79) a year 
  The school is in charge-of a commission chosen by the Artisan Society, ade is. 
supported from the funds of that society and by contributions from various outside 
sources. The amount contributed for its support from outside sources in the year 
1887-88 amounted to 11,932 rubles ($6,658) in which is reckoned 1,750 rubles ($976) 
for their training in the preparatory department and 8 roubles ($4.46) annually in 3 
the special department. The poorer pupils are instructed gratis. The pay of the 
instructors in general educational subjects for the year named was 30 rubles — 
($16.74) each and that of the trade instructors 374 rubles ($21) each. 
Such are the main details in regard to the intermediate and elementary, technical, 
and industrial institutions as presented by Mr. Anopoff; and in conclusion it may se 
be said that in the twenty-five years to which Mr. Anopoff refers these schools 
have spread to the very confines of the Russian Empire. ‘ 
REPORT OF FIRST TECHNICAL AND PROFESSIONAL CONGRESS.! 
The first congress of Russian educators engaged in«technical and — 
industrial instruction in Russia, held at St. Petersburg during the 
month of January, 1890, opened with an exhibition of school methods 
and material, presided over by Mr. Ivan A. Anopoff, director of the 
Nicholas Artisan School. The congress proper, under the presidency 
of Mr. N. V. Isakoff, was opened on January 7 by the minister of pub- 
. lie instruction, Count Jvan Davidovich Delianoff. Its work was trans- 
acted in a general session of the congress and in five divisions, to each 
of which some special subject had been assigned. In the general ses-   
  _sion Mr, A. K. Nebolsin read a paper on “ Periodical exhibitions and 
- congresses in the interest of technical and industrial education.” In —   
the divisions the following topics were discussed: (1) General peda- — 
gogical questions, such as school hygiene, factory, artisan, and com- 
mercial education; (2) middle and lower technical and artisan educa-_ 
tional establishments and instruction in navigation; (3) instruction, in ce 
farming and mining; (4) professional education of women; (5) manual 
training in the schools. x ee 
Mr. A. K. Nebolsin, in his paper before the general session, said: “The best way 
to prepare the peasant and artisan classes for industrial education is to secure that 
general dissemination of elementary instruction which is now so much needed in — 
Russia. To this end the most energetic action should be taken both by the Govern- Fae 
ment and by society at large. Until arecent period the Government took no part ‘ 
‘in the establishment of industrial schools, limiting itself to the function of pro- _ 
viding them with rules and constitutions or of giving subsidies to persons founding 4 a 
such schools. Only in very exceptional cases did it ever take these establishments 
under its own control. The industrial schools, arising from private initiative, 
without any general plan and often modeled on foreign institutions, have thus had — 
many difficulties to contend with, and the attempt to establish them on a firm foot- 
ing has been attended with much waste of time, money, and labor. The very Goy-

cation in Russia. This edict, which made the technical and industrial schools 
Government institutions to be supported not only by private means but also out of 
the public purse, provides that there shall be three types of technical schools, 
known, respectively, as the “artisan schools,” the “lower technical schools,” and 
— the “ iniddle technical schools,” fixes the order of their establishment, conditions of 
- scholarship, and programme of education, besides defining the rights and privileges 
of teachers and pupils. Much as we welcome this edict it is to be hoped that the 
- work of the schools may not suffer from bureaucratic influence. The aim of every 
technical school is to raise the economical condition of the people among whom itis 
founded; but the character and circumstances of people vary so greatly that it will 
be necessary to vary the rules and methods so as to make them suit different locali- 
ties. Attention to local differences should be the special study of persons in charge 
of such schools. It has been proposed to limit these establishments to the prepara- 
tion of workers in wood and metal for situations in factories and workshops; but 
this limitation is, in my opinion, unwise. The technical schools ought to fit men 
not only for the factory, but for all kinds of technical work, and thus to enable 
_ them to start workshops or trade establishments of their own. Especially in this 
_ sense are technical schools needed in those localities where the “bush” or domestic 
3 industry i is carried on, an industry which has grown to be of great importance ane 
the country people of Russia.” 
After discussing this paper the congress passed resolutions declaring that its 
periodical gatherings be held at intervals of not-more than five years; that its 
next sitting take place in Moscow three years from date, and that, in the inter- 
_ yals between the general, sessions of the congress, various local conferences be organ- 
ized. qi 
to discussions in regard to teaching in general, school hygiene, commercial educa- 
tion, and technical drawing. 
Prof. Lesgaft, in a report dealing with the relation of physical to intellectual 
education in the middle and lower schools, urged that both should go on simulta- 
neously, and should be carried on by like methods in the two grades referred to. In 
to physical training in modern Russian education. The section, in a formal resolu- 
, tion, admitted the importance of physical education, but confined itself to a declara- 
_ tion to the effect that all elements injurious to physical development of the pupils 
should be removed from the technical schools. 
After hearing reports on the subject of drawing the section resolved, ‘that the 
. congress petition the Government for the introduction of drawing into all the eduea- 
tional establishments of the Empire, without distinction of sex, as far as the middle- 
grade schools, and that instructors be provided for the purpose who may enjoy the 
privileges of Government service.” 
On the subject of foreign languages it was resolved, “that in sae teaching of non- 
classical foreign languages it is desirable to combine practical aims with a study of 
the best writers in those languages, and that, as ari indispensable condition of success 
5 ‘tongue, both theoretically and practically.” 
- The attention of the section was called to the loss of time, to the worry, and to the 
injurious effect upon the health and nerves of the pupils caused by the present 
system of annual examinations, and a resolution was passed favoring the new alter- 
z hygiene was also raised by the special reports of expert oculists, and a resolution 
was passed declaring that it is desirable to make a periodical examination of the eye-

pressing ‘the hope that before the eet congress measures be elaborated for the pres- 
ervation of the eyesight of students engaged in learning the graphical arts and 
some of the technical industries. : 
The question of child, woman, and apprentice labor was also discussed, and meas- 
  ures were suggested for the removal of existing abuses. Prof. Yarotsky urged the — 
improvement of the apprentice system: I, by giving to apprentices the opportunity — 
of attending some midday, evening, or Sunday school; I, by inaugurating an over- _ 
sight of apprentices in workshops., M. Rakéeff pirebod ue that the existing [uw per- 
mitted apprentices to be worked for ten hoursa day, and that under the present sys- 
tem Sunday work for apprentices had become habitual. He added that there are no 
regulations to protect the apprentice from work injurious to his health, or from night 
work generally. It was resolved to petition the Government to bestow upon the 
Imperial Humane Society, which now has charge of the fund for minor apprentices, — 
the right to carry out all necessary and nenctiowble changes in the relation of ae 
tices to their employers. 
Prof. Isaeft, in a report on ‘‘technical education as a means of aiding the ‘bush’ 
or domestic industry,” pointed to the present extreme exploitation of child labor in 
this industry, and recommended: I, the introduction into the schools of a course of 
manual labor adapted to the circumstances of local industries; II, the introduction. 
into pedagogical seminaries and institutes of certain kinds of manual work corre- 
sponding with the work involved in the chief domestic industries in Russia; III, the — 
establishment in the large centers of technical schools for training in domestic indus- 
try, and also the creation in those centers of muscums containing simples of the 
products of the industry and of the instruments and tools employed in it; IV, the 
offering of prizes for the best samples of work, and for improvements in the “bush” 
or domestic industry. The section indorsed all the above recommendations. 
  After listening to a report on the education of minors in factories, the section passed — 
aresolution asking for the obligatory establishment of schools for minors in con- — 
nection with all factory establishments, as well as in industrial centers generally, 
and the obligatory attendance of young workers at such schools. It was proposed 
to maintain all such educational establishments by means of a tax levied on manu- 
factures. me 2 
Then followed a discussion on “school savings banks,” and a resolution was passed 
  indicating the desirability of introducing the school savings-bank system into estab- 
lishments where pupils receive pay for their work. 
In connection with the teaching of arithmetic the section decided in favor of 
maintaining the Schoty, or counting, frame in counting rooms, and it was also 
resolved to utilize, in the teaching of the knowledge of merchandise, all the chem- 
_ ical and physical knowledge given in the courses of natural science in commercial 
schools. 
Attention was then called to the necessity of raising the standard of scientific 
knowledge in commercial schools, The establishment of a commercial institute was” 
proposed in which higher training could be given, not only to persons who were     
              men who were to conduct the financial, and industrial enterprises of the country. 
- In order to illustrate the eagerness of Russian merchants to encourage commercial 
education the excellent financial condition of all the special corimercial schools 
- were adverted to, and it was mentioned that the yearly income of the St. Peters 
burg commercial school exceeded the expenses of that establishment by 27,000 
rubles ($15,000). Several members of the section considered that the existing 
. schools already supplied all commercial education at present needed, but the sec- 
tion as a whole approved of the establishment of a higher commercial institute. 
On the subject of “uniformity of method ” the section reached conclusions which 
may. be summarized. as follows: ‘(In the matter of general education, it is desirable 
to have greater uniformity in the plan and programmes of the existing commercial     
           needed as instructors in the middle and lower commercial schools, but also to young” 
       
-P-A-G-E-288
   
   schools. The Fates of the ‘plans aid nROetanee of the “Realschoold can 
not be regarded as the Dest means of acquiring such uniformity. The commercial 
schools must, conformably to their aims, have their own special plans for general 
education. As regards modern languages and the majority of the special pranchés, 
ap each | commercial school must elaborate its own plan and programme, having in 
view the peculiar conditions and needs of the local trade.” 
— Acsuggestive report was then read on the ‘multiplicity of subjects in our educa- 
tionalestablishments.” The discussions of this subjectled to the following statements, 
viz: “This multiplicity of subjects is the ulcer on the life of Russian technical 
schools, causing these schools to load aman down with a mass of superficial acquire- 
ments but giving him far too little special knowledge.” 
The explanation of this excessive variety in the programmes of the higher technical 
schools is attributable to the present condition of Russian industry. In foreign 
countries there is a natural demand for specialists in this or that branch of industry, 
but with a less advanced industrial development Russia stands more in need of per- 
sons whose education is encyclopedic in character. 
A report was then presented which recommended the further development of tech- 
nical literature, and the section affirmed the necessity of the issue of manuals and 
text-books of the applied sciences for use in the higher technical schools. 
_ The members of section 2; presided over by Mr. M.E. Kazy, discussed reports in 
_ tegard to educationzl establishments in which the art of building is taught and in 
regard to middle and lower technical and artisan schools, They also discussed the 
formation of classes for the education of sailors. 
In order to place no unnecessary difficulties in the way of popular technical edu- 
3 cation, itswas resolved that the elementary training given by the primary schools 
should be the only condition of entrance for pupils of the technical establishments. 
‘The section also found it desirable to carry on the work of general education in the 
lower technical and artisan schools, and to instruct pupils in the various methods 
of working in wood and metal, in order to qualify them for special industries in 
_ their several localities. It was further decided to regard as competent teachers of 
j the /trades those who, after passing through a course in the technical or artisan 
' schools, have had practice in such trades, or those who, having the necessary prac- 
. tical knowledge, are also familiar with methods of teaching. In order to facilitate 
the obtaining of a suitable occupation by pupils after leaving the schools, it was 
suggested that every Russian subject wishing to do so be given the right to open a 
trade or workshop. : 
The members of the section discussed at length the present deplorable condition 
under which the labor of artisans and apprentices is carried on. The conclusions. 
reached may be summarized as follows: 
- “Jn order to raise the moral and intellectual status of our workingmen and_arti- 
sans, they should have an opportunity of attending evening and Sunday schools, 
in which lectures could be given on general and spécial subjects. The trade guild 
of the various industrial centers ought to issue books in which the facts regard- 
ing the employment of any minor in a workshop may be entered, as also the dates 
of’his entrance and departure, together with particulars about his conduct. No 
employer ought to receive any one into his service without being first acquainted 
with the facts regarding the new comer’s previous employment. Trade boards should 
be established for the purpose of exercising oversight over workshops and deciding — 
disputes submitted by employers and.workmen. Itis desirable, in view of the 
irregular and indiscriminate issue of diplomas to chief workmen and subordinates, 
- that such diplomas shall henceforth be granted by special commissions made up 
of trade experts, and only after public examination of the candidates. Permis- 
sion to have apprentices shall be granted only to those employers who are known 
for the excellence of their behavior and morals. The number of apprentices in 
- any workshop ought not to be more than twice the number of the under hands.           . 
   
-P-A-G-E-289
  epucaTio IN. RUSSIA.) y 
Instruction in a trade shall continua for not less than aie ae not more than 
five years; the master must treat his apprentices humanely, and set them an ex- 
ample in uprightness of conduct. On no account must apprentices be sent to 
drinking shops, and if sent, they are not to enter for the purpose of purchasing 
liquor. Apprentices ought to have special guardians to watch over their interests. 
Parents who put a boy out as apprentice shall guarantee to the employer the sum of 
100 rubles ($55.80) a year to pay the cost of instruction in case the boy leaves his master. 
In order that apprentices may be educated, Sunday schools ought to be provided for 
them, giving an elementary education where needed, and also instruction in trades.” 
Mr. Nebolsin submitted a report on the best means of educating the children of 
workingmen. The chief recommendations of the report are as follows: ‘Obligatory 
attendance of children up to the age of 15 in schools divided into lower elementary 
and higher elementary classes. The lower elementary schools are to correspond in 
their course with the one-class village schools. In the higher elementary schools 
special industrial subjects may be taught according to the needs of the locality. 
Each school is to be divided into three classés, with an indeterminate time for the 
pupil’s stay ineach. The pupils are to be divided into two groups, consisting of 
those occupied before dinner and those occupied after it, the time spent at school 
being for each pupil not less than three hours a day. Tuition is to begin not carlier 
than 8 o’clock in the morning, and is to continue until not later than 6 o’clock in the 
evening. The time of beginning and ending of each day’s occupation is to depend 
on the industrial conditions of the locality, but it is desirable that tuition continue 
during at least ten months in the year.” The section adopted all the recommenda- 
tions of the report, but it expressed no opinion as to the details of the scheme. It 
also passed a resolution declaring the desirability of opening schools for the educa-~ 
tion of workingmen throughout Russia and in all industrial centers, and by a fur- 
ther decision expressed itself as in favor of founding chemico-technical schools, 
electro-technical schools, millers, and weavers’ schools. In acknowledging the great 
utility of middle and lower grade chemico-technical schools, the section expressed 
its opinion that an elementary course‘in chemistry should form the basis of the pro- 
gramme in such establishments. 
Under the heading of ‘‘ Marine education” the section discussed “‘ Kinds of naviga- 
tion,” ‘‘The necessity of establishing schools of navigation of three types,” and “‘The 
need of special exhibitions for those schools.” After hearing a number of reports 
the section declared it necessary to have more schools for the teaching of navigation 
with a higher general course. 3 
The members of section 3, presided over by Mr. V. T. Sobichesky, occupied them- 
selves mainly with questions relating to the teaching of agriculture and mining. 
Four classes of reports were presented and discussed. 1.’ Reports showing the neces- 
sity of diffusing agricultural knowledge among the people, and suggesting how 
educational establishments may participate in the work. 2. Reports concerning 
schools of agriculture in general and dealing with various special branches of agri- 
culture. 3, Reports discussing ways and means.of extending a knowledge of agri- 
culture among the people outside the province on the school. 4. Reports on instruc- 
tion in mining. 
Reports were also made in regard to the manner in which primary schools may 
take part in diffusing agricultural knowledge. The conclusion was that the primary 
school, supplying, as it usually did, the needs of a population engaged in agricul- 
ture, ought to have a model farm as one of its features, and ought to be endowed 
with the land necessary for that purpose. At the close of a lively discussion on 
these reports, the Section resolved: ‘‘1. That it will be advantageous to the people 
to have the primary school take part in the work of diffusing a knowledge of agri- 
culture. 2. That to accomplish this end it is necessary to give an agricultural char- 
acter to the text-books and manuals used in the primary schools. 3. That popular 
text-books teaching various branches of agriculture be introduced into the country 
ED 91. 17  
-P-A-G-E-290
         EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
     
schools. 4, That teachers of such schools should be encouraged to visit model farms 
and like places for the improvement of their knowledge. 5. That it is necessary to 
lay out farms either in connection with some of the second-class schools or separately 
from them, in order that schoolmasters and the people of the locality may have an 
opportunity of studying, objectively, the practice of agriculture.” 
The section also decided in favor of imposing the duty upon the elementary schools 
of diffusing a knowledge of kitchen-gardening, and of establishing an institute 
composed of ambulatory teachers, with expert gardeners among them, whose work it 
should be to go from place to place teaching agriculture to pupils in the schools and 
to the country population. generally. Further resolutions on this subject were 
passed as follows: ‘‘1. To the end that agricultural knowledge may be diffused 
among the people, it is desirable to establish, for the information of schoolmasters, 
special local courses in agriculture adapted to the conditions and needs of the small 
peasant estates in each locality. 2. Such courses can be established on the basis of 
the courses in agriculture, gardening, and bee culture; ‘agriculture’ being under- 
_ stood to mean the tilling and care of the field and care of the cattle. 3. The most 
suitable places for the holding of such courses are agricultural and gardening es- 
tablishments, farms, and nurseries, where experts are to be found. 4, Like courses 
should also be established on private farms, in private gardens, and in any places 
which furnish accommodation for students and give opportunities for carrying on 
“practical work, whence it is desirable for the government and the zemstvos to ap- 
_ point specialists whose duty it would be to establish courses for teachers in different 
localities. 5. Teaching in such courses must be practical, theory being used merely 
to elucidate actual work. 6. In order to economize cost, the courses must not ex- 
ceed ten weeks, but the teachers may remain on the spot longer in order to gain ex- 
perience. 7. It is desirable that the agricultural societies take these courses under 
their control.” : 
The question of silkworm culture also engaged the attention of the congress, and 
the section expressed its full sympathy with the rational steps taken by. the Kief 
and Caucasus educational districts aiming at the development of silkworm culture. 
It was also considered desirable to introduce this culture into the village schools, 
wherever the local conditions permit, half the resulting revenue to go to the teachers 
and half to the pupils. The section also resolved, ‘That in view of the inexpedi- 
ency of limiting the teaching of silkworm culture to the primary schools, it is ur- 
gently necessary t6 establish special schools in which this branch may be taught. 
This is especially desirable in those localities where the silkworm culture has 
already been developed; in this caseit should be made obligatory on pupils to learn 
the feeding of the worms and the winding of the silk, to the end that the people 
may be educated into the practical side of this culture.” To these resolutions was 
added one expressing the desirability of courses of instruction in bee culture in 
those localities where the teachers keep bees. 
The following resolutions on the subject of agriculture were passed: “It is de- 
sirable that in the higher educational establishments agriculture should be taught, 
special attention being given to those branches of it that have a direct bearing on 
the sciences acquired in such schools.” ‘In the middle educational establishments 
the teaching of agriculture should be carried on simultaneously with tuition in all 
other natural history subjects, or in such a way as to give the pupil a general 
knowledge of agriculture before graduating.” ‘Text-books, or manuals of agri- 
culture, should be prepared by the teachers of the high, middle, and lower educa- 
tional establishments, working in collaboration.” ‘In order to provide that inex- 
pensive education in agriculture-which is now so much needed, a special agricultural 
department should be created in the first-class and second-class primary schools.” 
In view of the importance of viticulture for the sonth of Russia and the Caucasus 
it was resolved to petition the Government to aid private persons and societies in 
opening establishments for the teaching of viticulture. Such establishments to
-P-A-G-E-291
      EDUCATION IN RUSSIA, 259. 
y Z - i 4 
have the character of the lower grade schools, with three and four year courses. 
The section also considered that in the Cancasus viticulture should be taught not 
only in Russian, but also in the local languages. A further resolution indicated the 
desirability of establishing extra classes for viticulture in the existing city and vil- 
lage schools in the south of Russia and the Caucasus. The members expressed the 
opinion that the Government ought to aid establishments where vine culture was 
carried on, and to open schools in the vicinity of such establishments where pupils 
could learn to become teachers of viticulture, besides acquiring a general education. 
For the successful diffusion of a knowledge of agricultural productions generally, 
the section recommended the establishment of special technical schools for city Pop: 
ulations which are in more or Jess close contact with the peasantry. 
The whole question of agricultural exhibitions was discussed, and the section, 
bearing in mind the essentially educational character of such exhibitions, resolved: 
(1) That a national agricultural exhibition for the whole of Russia be held in Moscow 
every ten years; (2) that local exhibitions be held once every five years inimportant 
agricultural districts, 
The section considered the need of better education for mipers, and recommended 
the opening of schools in mining districts to serve as continuations of the primary 
schools and to be carried on at the expense of the mine owners. 
The work of section 4, over the sittings of which Mr. Y. T. Michailovsky presided: 
consisted largely of a discussion-of questions relating to the industrial training of 
women. The reports laid before the section had reference to only one kind of 
woman’s work, namely, the work of the seamstress. The information received ands 
the resolutions passed by the congress may be summarized as follows: | 
The character of the women’s schools, in which needlework is taught, varies accord- 
ing to local conditions and demands; in some cases even the age of entering is not 
fixed. Women seeking tuition in these schools are at present confined to needle and 
fancy work, and, as the pay of the seamstress is growing smaller and smaller, it be- 
_ comes neeessary to introduce other occupations into the programme of the indus- 
trial schools for women. Another fault in such schools is the insufficient élabora- 
tion of their programmes. It was shown that persons entering the industrial 
schools from the elementary schools do so without having received the slightest prep- 
aration for the training they seek, and this fact pointed to a serious defect in the 
efficiency of the elementary educational establishments. At present many persons 
enter schools, in which sewing and cutting are taught, for the ostensible purpose of 
teaching, but with the real object of making use of the labor of the children, and 
the section, therefore, was of opinion that educational workshops should take the 
place of such schools. On the other hand, it was found desirable to improve the posi- 
tion of the pupils in existing workshops by protective regulation and legislation, 
defending them from exploitation and insuring the proper hygienic conditions. 
Courses of short period for the teaching of cutting and sewing were found unsatis- 
factory, as such courses did not qualify either for practical work or for teaching. 
The industrial schools, in which handiwork is taught, carry on at the same time 
the general education of the pupil, and in this respect they have an advantage over 
the training of the educational workshops, where the pupils have to pick up what 
they learn by imitating others, and where only the most capable can acquire a knowl- 
edge of the business. It was, therefore, deemed advisable to continue general edu- 
cation in the industrial schools, and in the matter of handiwork to teach to the pupil, 
after her entrance, only the general features of that work, leaving the specialization 
of the course to a later period. The section decided that there was great need in 
the provinces for industrial schools of a lower grade than those which now exist, as 
well as for more educational workshops. In view of the utility in all the trades of 
drawing, two programmes for the teaching of drawing were drawn up for two grades 
of professional schools for women. In order to stimulate the development of taste, 
the section recommended the establishment of museums for the exhibition of prod- 
 
-P-A-G-E-292
        4 » 2% y 
_ ucts in women’s trades and industries, Finding the unsatisfactory state of the in- 
struction in women’s handiwork and trades to be due, in general educational estab- 
lishments and industrial schools, to the lack of properly trained teachers, the 
section declared it to be necessary to establish courses of instruction for persons 
desiring to qualify themselves as tutors in such schools, and appointed a committee 
to elaborate a programme for the purpose. It was also considered desirable to create 
new educational establisments, in which women may be trained so as to have a wider 
range of industrial capacity, and so be qualified by a greater command of industrial 
specialties for more remunerative employment. 
A report was then presented by Mrs. L.P. Tamamsheva concerning the women’s 
workshop in Tiflis, where industrial instruction is free. The entrance age is 14, 
jut there is a preparatory class to which girls of 12 and 13 are admitted. At present 
this workshop is conducted by the city; at an annual cost of 5,000 rubles, $2,790, 
but hopes are entertained that it will soon be placed upon a paying basis. It now 
contains two departments, one for dressmaking and the other for the making of linen 
underwear. The section resolved, ‘‘That in view of conditions making it impossible 
for the majority of thgchildren of poor parents to enter the industrial schools, and 
also in view of the extreme cheapness of education in the workshops, it is desirable 
that women’s. workshops, like that existing in Tiflis, should be established in vari- 
ous parts of the country.” Z 
The following resolutions were also passed: ‘‘That guardians should be appointed 
for the girls graduating from the private industrial schools on a basis correspond- 
ing with the social standing of the pupils, and with the conditions of modern indus- 
try.” ‘That in the women’s industrial schools, with a four years’ course, exacting | 
aknowledge of thg subjects taught in the primary school course, it is necessary to 
teach, in addition to trades, the following subjects: Religion, Russian language, 
arithmetic, history, geography, natural history, singing, and gymnastics; these to be 
taught in a form and manner conformably to the object of the school.” ‘The teach- 
ing of drawing in women’s industrial schools ought to be obligatory, and the 
pupils must present themselves for examination on this subject.” ‘Instruction in 
handiwork is not only useful but necessary in general educational establishments.” 
“Tn the women’s workshops cutting should be taught from the beginning of the 
course, and to girls from 12 years of age upwards, while the pupils should be familiar- 
- ized with different systems of cutting.” 2 
An interesting report was then read by Mr. Stranolynbsky concerning women’s pro- 
fessional schools for those who had acquired an education of the gymnasial type. 
He considered the pedagogical profession to be especially suited to women, and 
advocated the establishment of special pedagogical institutes with gymnasia 
attached. He also urged the creation of medical courses for women on the model of 
those which, in time past, had been the pride of the country. There was, he said, 
great need in Russia for the services of women doctors and trained assistants to 
medical men, suchas nurses and midwives. At present, fot women who wished to 
qualify themselves for the artistic and dramatic profession, ample opportunity was 
afforded by the Conservatory of Music, the Academy of Art, and by various musical 
and art schools and courses. The speaker stated that in view of the modern widen- 
ing of the sphere of women’s professional work, it had become necessary to organize 
commercial education for women: In his opinion women’s commercial schools ought 
to be established independently of the institutions for gencral education. In the 
commercial courses he would include tuition in postal and telegraph work, and his 
plan also embraced pharmaceutical courses for women. The section unanimously 
indorsed the proposals of Mr. Stranolynbsky. 
In the fifth section, the sittings of which were presided over by Mr. K.K. St. Hilaire, 
the questions discussed included the pedagogical and utilitarian significance of 
manual training in the general educational establishments; the obligatory introduc- 
tion of manual training into such establishments; manual training in the middle ‘ Z 2

grade ‘schools; the study of those trades in which the material for manual training 
in the schools may be found; the preparation of teachers of manual work. The see- 
tion resolved that manual training ought not to be mixed up with the teaching of 
trades, but should be regarded as a general educational subject of great importance 
for physical education, and as one salutary in its influence upon the intellectual 
and moral advance of the pupils. 
As is shown in these discussions, the subject of manual training is 
quite a recent one in Russia, but such training is liable to be success- 
fully carried out, for the minister of public instruction and the Russian 
people realize the benefits to accrue from its becoming a part of the 
school programme. It is observed that the majority of the speakers 
agree that it should be introduced in a general course of instruction, 
but that the development, both physical and intellectual, should be in - 
accordance with the needs of the locality, and in a measure preparatory 
to any trade which might afterwards be taken up. Stress was also laid 
upon the consideration of manual training as constituting the gymnastic 
of the will, experience having demonstrated that it develops both energy — 
and independence. In regard to its introduction in secondary schools . 
the congress indicated its manifest approval of manual training as a 
supplementary branch to the usual course, for by this means the higher 
classes of society, who are to be found in greater numbers in this grade 
of school, would learn to respect work, and thus a sentiment for the 
beautiful in the domain of form would be cultivated. 
It was decided by the congress to request the establishment of a com- — 
mission to investigate the points more especially brought out during 
the discussions. Later information indicates that the commission has 
already commenced its work, and that it will report to the second con- 
gress for the study of feclinisal and ancastral instruction which is to 
be held in Moscow in 1893. EDUCATION IN RUSSIA.

THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM OF JAPAN! 
Constitutional Kmpire (since February 11, 1889); area, 147,655 square 
miles; population? 40,072,020 (January 1, 1890); capital, Tokio; pop-

ADMINISTRATION AND HISTORY. 
The archipelago of Japan comprises 3,850 islands, four of which, 
Hondo, Kiushiu, Shikoku, and Yezo, rank as the most important. Its 
_ territorial organization is divided into 85 provinces, 42 urban and 804 
rural districts, 1,111 towns, and 13,374 villages (1890). 
The administration of the provinces is regulated from the three Fus, 
or imperial cities, Tokio, Kioto, and Osaka, and from the forty-three 
Kens, or prefectoral divisions of the Empire. For still further local 
administration there are Ku and Gun, or subdivisions into cities or 
wards, and counties, and, since April 1, 1889, an imperial decree has 
established minor offices which deal almost entirely with the adminis- 
tration of municipality, town and village. This further carries out the 
principle of decentralization and self-government and isto be applied 
gradually according to the circumstances and requirements of the lo- 
ealities. 
The Hokkaidd, or Northern Province, has a special organization of 
its own, a governor and an administrative board. According to the 
constitution of February 11, 1889, the Emperor controls all the adminis- 
trative affairs of the Empire, exercising executive power with the as- 
sistance of his ministers and privy council, and legislative power with 
the consent of the two legislative bodies, or Imperial Diet, which con- 
trols the finances and the administration of justice. Provincial affairs 
_are controlled by the governors, one for each Fu or Ken, but they in _ : 
turn receive directions from the cabinet. The minor officers in the

In 1889 the population was divided among the various classes as follows: Im-_ 
perial family, 46; Kwazoku or nobles, 3,825; Shizoku or knights (formerly retainers 
of the Daimios) 38,074,558; common people, 1,993,637. The number of foreigners in — : 
1890 was 9,063; of these 4,975 Chinese, 1,701 English, 899 Americans, 550 Germans, 
312 French, The number of Japanese residents abroad in 1889 was 18,688.

intendence of the governors, and in the wards and villages the reports

_Tefers affairs to the governor. 
The history of the Empire from the founding of the dynasty of Jim- 
mu (660 B. C.) through years of a feudal system may be divided into 
four periods—the first, a purely local one, ending with the landing of 
the Portuguese in 1543; the second, from 1543 to 1638 including the 
introduction of Catholicism into Japan and the final ordering away of 
all foreigners from the country, as their presence came to be considered 
detrimental to the political system and to the religions of Japan (i. e., 
Shintoism and Buddhism); the third, from 1638 to 1854, continuing the 
exclusion of foreigners and being distinguished by-the Dutch monopoly; 
the fourth, since 1854, includes the establishing of commercial treaties 
with foreign powers, the sending of enlightened statesmen to European 
and other countries to study advanced civilization in the most pro- 
gressive nations, and as a result of such study follows the consequent 
_ development of a more liberal form of government. Ethnologists differ 
as to the origin of the people of these islands, but it is stated that the 
modern Japanese race is a commingling of a people which came from 
Southern Asia and the Malay Archipelago with the Corean and Chinese 
peoples. 
The religions are that of Shintoism or worship of the sun goddess (the 
spiritual emperor being considered the direct descendant, and every 
district having its patron saint or kami), and the Buddhistic, which, in- 
troduced in the sixth century, is considered a more modern creed. The ~ 
literati believe in the system of morals and the philosophy of Confucius. 
- The literature of Japan includes original writings and translations and 
the whole circle ot Chinese Confucian literature. The Chinese classics, 
indeed, form the basis of the literature, system of ethics, and highest 
type of thought of the Japanese people. In tracing the history of the 
nation, one clearly sees a marked development along educational lines. 
As early as 285 A. D. a Corean came to Japan and taught the heir ap- 
parent Chinese letters and the ethics of Confucius. In 552 Corean mis- 
sionaries introduced books, the writings of the Chinese classics, and 
Buddhistie images and canon. This was a noticeable period from the 
educational standpoint. Officials and the nobility learned to read and 
write, and literary, governmental, and historical records were soon com- 
piled. The religious development, combined withits attendant school- 
masters, was the means of creating a limited class of readers, and from 
the sixth century on education and Buddhism seemed to move on 
together. Kobo, a priest and schoolmaster, who lived from 774 to 835, was 
learned in the Pali, Sanscrit, and Chinese languages, and was credited 
with being the inventor of the Japanese alphabet. To him is due the 
national success of Buddhism, as he developed a system of theology in 
which Buddhism absorbed Shintoism. Following him came Sugarawa

     THE BDUCATIONAL SYSTEM oF JAPAN. 
Michizané (died 903 2 A.D.), ao also aided in the advancement of lit- 
erature and education. From that date to the twelfth century the 
Emperor (or, as he is usually called, the Mikado! or Golden Gate,) ruled 
supreme from Mara to Kioto, which were well known political and edu- 
cational centers. With the year 1192 commenced the period of the — 
Shéguns (tycoons), which was that of a dual government with two rulers, 
two capitals, and two centers of authority. This duarchy lasted until 
1868, when the Shégunate was overthrown. The principle of duality | 
was also carried out in the Japanese language, for there were two dis- 
tinct alphabets, the Chinese ideographic symbols and the i : 
alphabet. 
The-former is especially i in use in the higher class of ook and in 
diplomatic documents; the latter has been subject to great variation, 
but from it has acraibped a simpler alphabet known as the Katagana 
characters. Evidence of intellectual activity was apparent as early as" 
1333, for, dating from that period, are chronicled the establishment of 
_ monastic schools and the general spread of Buddhistic doctrines; then 
followed a period favorable to the Jesuits but less so to the Buddhists. 
During the years 1532-1582 a reaction was apparent, and where formerly 
the nobles only were educated there developed a centralization of the 
feudal system at Yedo, and an extending of educational facilities to all 
classes throughout the Empire. The basis of the culture manifest from 
1604 to 1868 was found in the study of the Chinese classics of Confucius 
and Mencius. Native literature was largely studied, and the funda- — ‘ 
mentals of education, reading, writing, and the abacus were generally 
taught. At date of 1854 it was reported that seven-tenths of the people 
could read and write, and there were military, gymnastic, and normal 
schools, universities, and private schools in various sections of Japan. — 
Both sexes were accorded equal educational privileges, and the people 
were gradually realizing the necessity of more direct communication with 
the outside world, and the introduction of a national system of education 
developed from the highest types found amongst other nations. The 
local government of the past was slowly yielding to broader modern 
influences and the more enlightened statesmen looked forward to the 
establishing of a more direct central power. The commercial treaties 
of 1854 and 1858 opened Japan to the outside world and more reliance 
could be placed on the information obtained in regard to the Japanese 
people. The statement in regard to earlier periods of history were 
often not to be relied upon;as many details had been left to mere hear. 
  
1The Mikado’s right and authority are grounded on the belief in his divine de- 
scent. Honors conferred upon him were always considered the highest distinctions 
which could fall to the lot of any subject, not exceeding the all-powerful Shégun. 
The distinctions of class are especially noteworthy in Japan. These distinctions were 
a gradual outgrowth of feudalism. The groups are as follows: The Mikado house, 
with the court nobility (Kuge) in Kidto, the military class, or Samurai, and the labor- 
ing class or the people (Heimin.)

say evidence, or te the imagination of the writers, but from 1854 on 
Japan entered upon a new period of existence. In 1863 the Tycoon, 
Stotsbachi, begged the Emperor to convoke‘all the nobles of the Em- 
pire, so as to take into consideration the placing of the Government 
upon a firm basis. The efforts to carry eut this plan brought about.a 
revolution which was.unexpectedly favorable to the Japanese. In 1868 
the Emperor endeavored to thoroughly transform the Government by 
taking steps to abolish the feudal form of government, which he was 
successful in doing in 1871. The tycoons were overthrown and ‘the 
Emperor became the supreme ruler. 
In 1869 a decree regulated the administrative department, and the 
- foundation of the present system of internal affairs was laid. In 1871 
the Emperor established himself in Yedo, which he called Tokio, in- 
stead of remaining in Kioto, the old capital of the Mikados. He then 
sent embassadors to the United States, England, and France to study 
the civilization of those countries and to enter into commercial treaties 
with them. He also called distinguished men from America and Europe 
to reform all branches appertaining to the general administration of 
the Empire. He increased the number of schools and sent young per- 
sons to the colleges of America, England, and France to study at gov- 
ernmental expense. In 1871 a ministry of education was established; 
_ in 1872 the scheme of the present system of education was presented; 
in 1873 the Japanese adopted the Gregorian calendar, and all present 
publications bear both the date of the Gregorian calendar and that of 
Meiji or the present dynasty. From the administrative standpoint 
Japan was formerly divided into ten! territorial circuits formed of sixty- 
eight provinces, over each of which was a governor. These officials 
formed a feudal confederation, but the revolutionary movements in- 
dicated above brought about tendencies towards centralization and 
gradually new legislation was adopted, which, based upon French 
- models, reorganized the legislative branch of the Government and 
brought about the adoption of new lawsin 1876. The legislative reforms 
were completed by the creation of a school of law,with a French gen- 
tleman as director. Another school, where French only was taught, was 
created in connection with the ministry of justice, the pupils receiving 
instruction in all studies in that language. 
Before the Restoration,’ as the first year of the Meiji was called, in- 
stitutions for the elementary education of children were chiefly those of 
the Hangaku, Kyogaku (private schools of low standard), and Terakoya.- 
  
1Jn 1885 the whole country was divided into six (reduced to five afterwards) edu- 
cational circuits, for each of which a special school inspector was appointed. This 
in a measure simplified the general plan of supervision, but it brought about more 
efficient supervision from the central organization. 
?The change from the rule of the Shogunate to that of former times, when Japan 
was under one ruler, the Mikado or Emperor, is usually referred to as that of the 
Restoration. 
   
-P-A-G-E-299
  THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM OF JAPAN. 
The Hangaku were institutions established and supported by the vari- 
ous provinces, where children of-the military and higher classes were 
taught but which were sometimes opened to children of dependents; 
the Kydgaku were institutions, established within the territories. of 
“Taifu (chief ministers of feudal lords), or in other prosperous districts, 
where chiefly children of the military class were taught, but to somé of 
them pupils of all classes were admitted. These institutions were sup- 
ported at public expense. After the Restoration elementary schools 
were first established in the Fu of Kioto, but these schools were only | 
a slight improvement on the Terakoya, a real development being mani- 
fest, however, in 1871, when six elementary schools of Tokio were placed 
under the direct superintendence of the department of education, which 
was established at that date, and a regular course of instruction was 
arranged. ‘ 
In the first year of Meiji, 1868, the political power having been trans- 
ferred to the Emperor, the Gakushiu-in (a school for nobles) was estab- — 
lishedin Kioto. This was the first step toward the improvement of educa- _ 
tion after the political reform. In 1869 there was established in Tokio 
the university, which had control of educational matters over the whole 
country. In 1871 the controlling powers of the university were replaced 
by the department of education, or Mombushé, which has entire charge 
of the educational system of the country. In the year 1872 a new law 
of education was presented by which the school districts and the mode 
of instruction in the university, secondary schools, and elementary 
schools, were determined. The school age of children was also fixed 
- at from 6 to 13 years. At this period a great many schools were 
established in various parts of the country, and great improvements 
were made in the general methods of instruction. In January of 1875 
the school age of children was altered to 6 to 14 years. In Sep- 
tember, 1879, the old law of education was abolished, a new law of 
education was passed, and many improvements were made in the 
system. Thus itis seen that elementary education is based upon the 
law of 1872. It was placed on a firm basis by the revision of 1880 
which modified the system of school districts, lengthened the course of 
study to more than thirty-two weeks a year, and gave to the authorities 
of Fu and Ken greater power over education. 
Still further improvements came from imperial ordinances, in 1886, 
relating to elementary schools, and there were still later efforts at re- 
form. Thesecondary schools for pupils completing the elementary course 
date from 1872. Their course varied from two to six years , and the subjects 
differed in the various localities. “Modifications of this basis were made 
from time to time, and in 1886 the secondary schools, which were 
subdivided into lower secondary and higher secondary schools, and 
had had no connection up to that time with the university, were dis- 
tinetly designated as institutions to prepare pupils for practical occu-

_ pations, or for admission to higher educational institutions. In the 
year 1872 teachers institutes were established, and that year also gave 
birth to the normal school, which was first established on a firm basis 
in 1873, and was divided in 1879 into preparatory, higher preparatory. 
and professional courses. In the year 1883 there was an entire remodel- 
ing of these schools; in 1885 it was decided to train the two sexes 
together, and in 1886 the normals were divided into higher and lower nor- 
mals; the higher normal to be established at Tokio under direct control 
of the minister of education, and each Fu and Ken to have a lower 
grade normal school. The university, the many special schools, and - 
those of miscellaneous character, have all had their changes in the 
_ yéars under advisement. The various laws and imperial ordinances 
  have not left these institutions untouched, but the changes have possi- 
bly not had so marked an effect upon the people at large as in the ele- 
mentary and secondary schools, hence a study of these institutions 
can be deferred to the appropriate headings below, even so with 
the modifications in supervision, in attendance, and general conduct of 
schools. It suffices here to state that from this cursory glance over the 
administrative and educational history of the Japanese peoples a gen- 
eral deduction may be made. Thus from 1867 to 1889 the capacity of 
_ the people for self-government was tested, and it was manifest, as early 
as 1878, that this system of government had steadily advanced. In 
1881 there was the promise of a liberal constitution, and in 1889 came 
_the fulfillment of that promise. In 1881 power was granted to establish 
local educational boards, and in 1885 greater freedom in the shaping of 
- local educational methods was noticeable. The period commencing 
with 1889 gave new laws for city, town, and village government, changed 
the local subdivisions, brought about new electoral privileges, and in 
~ eyery direction indicated the effect of broader modern influences. Spe- 
cial phases were developed, however, in different sections, and widely 
different conditions were noticed, but with the firm establishment of a 
limited and liberal constitutional monarchy, based upon the new con- 
stitution of February 11, 1889, one of the most ancient peoples finds 
itself abreast with medern movements adopting a system of liberal ideas 
as advanced as those of any European nation, and based in part upon 
French and American models. ,

Establishment.—According to the Jaw of 1879, with its modifications 
of 1880, 1886, 1889, and 1890, the schools are divided into the kindergar- 
ten, elementary, secondary, normal, and professional schools, universi- 
ties, agricultural, commercial, and industrial schools, and other insti- 
tutions of learning. These schools are established by governmental 
authority, and under the general control of the minister of education,

aided by the governing powers of Fu and Ken,! or under the control of 
other ministries, an account of which will be presented as occasion offers, 
The kindergirten include governmental, public, and private .estab- 
lishments. They were first established in 1876, with the object of train- 
ing children from 3 to 6 years of age in such branches as “ foster moral 
virtues, promote physical development, train in good habits, and unfold 
the intellectual faculties.” 
The elementary schools are those in which general education is given — 
to children and at which attendance is compulsory, the school age being 
4ixed at from 6 to 14 years and the sexes being generally taught to-_ 
gether. By ordinance of 1890 the schools are divided into lower 
elementary, and higher elementary schools. Those established and 
maintained at the expense of cities, towns, or villages, or of town and 
village school unions, or of the districts within them, are called city, 
town, or village, elementary schools, and those established and main- 
tained at the expense of private individuals are called private ele- 
mentary schools. Apprentice schools and supplementary schools for 
technical instruction are also classed under the heading of elementary 
schools. Hach city, town, or village is expected to establish and main- 
tain elementary schools sufficient to accommodate all children of school 
age, 6 to 14, resident in such city, town, or village. The city, town, or 
village may also establish and maintain kindergiirten, libraries, schools 
for the blind and dumb, and miscellaneous schools similar in character 
to elementary schools. 
The secondary schools, which give higher instruction in the branches 
of study preparing for liberal pursuits or more advanced education, are 
organized according to the local conditions of each Fu and Ken and in 
conformity with the general regulations issued by the department of 
education. Normal schools intended to train teachers for elementary 
schools are to. be established in every Fu and Ken. The object of the 
university is to give instruction in special bratiches in its four depart- 
ments of law, science, medicine, and literature. The professional 
schools, which are organized according to the local condition of Fu and 
and Ken, include medical, pharmacal, legal, scientific, mathematical, 
architectural, naval, foreign language schools, gymnastic and drawing 
schools. The regulations of these schools are determined by the de- 
partment of education or by the departments to which they are 
assigned, such as that of military affairs, agriculture, marine, ete., or 
in part by local conditions. The agricultural schools have courses, 
which are determined according to local conditions, and are conse- | THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM OF JAPAN. 
  
1 The Japanese terms used throughout this article may be defined as follows: Fu, — 
Imperial city (each Fu consists of one main city with suburban districts); Ken, or 
prefectoral divisions of the Empire. The Fus are divided into Ku, cities or wards, — 
’ and Cho, precincts. Then there are the Gun, or counties, which since 1889 are di- 
vided into Shi, Cho, and Son (graded according to population). The Shi is a city, 
generally; Cho, atown; and Son, a village. The Fa Chiji and Ken Rei are governors, 
respectively, of city and county. The Kéch6 ig a director, and the word Cho is also 
used to indicate a magistrate,

quently not uniform; agricultural institutes teach practical business, 
and have a simple course of study. ‘Commercial schools, which, like the 
above-mentioned schools, are organized according to local conditions, 
but in accordance with general regulations issued by the minister of 
education, give their students the opportunity to learn the practical 
business of commerce. Industrial schools are to be established accord- 
“ing to similar conditions, so that students may learn practical business. 
Private schools are also established with the approval of the governor 
of Fu and Ken, and all public and private schools are to be opened to 
inspection of any officials designated by the minister of education. 
High schools for girls are for the-purpose of giving a higher class of 
education to girls who have completed the elementary school course. 
Then there are various miscellaneous schools, organized in different 
localities, such as Japanese, Chinese, French, German, and English 
schools, those for the deaf and dumb, bookkeeping schools, handiwork 
schools for women, schools where arithmetic alone is taught, and those 
in which reading is the main basis of instruction. 
State control.—The majority of the schools, unless some of the pri- 
vate ones be excepted, are under the general control of the minister of 
education, who presides over the department of education. He is aided 
in supervising education throughout the country by special inspectors, 
who exercise general supervision over the local authorities by visiting 
the schools when sent out by the department. There are also many 
schools under the control of the department of the imperial household, 
under the military department, under the control of the department of 
marine, of justice, of agriculture and commerce, the department of 
communications, and under the control of the Hokkaidé! administra- 
tion board. 
Local control is not regulated by any fixed rules, and there have been 
from year to year many modifications of the ordinances governing such 
general oversight. Sometimes there are committees of inspection; the 
school officials of Gun and Ku attend to the periodical examinations; 
supervising teachers aid in the matter of improving educational sys- 
tems; teachers of morals are also sent from point to point within their 
own jurisdiction. More than this, all the local authorities aid in the 
matter of control over the schools in their respective districts, so that 
through the reports made to the special inspectors, and by them to the 
department of education, there is positive knowledge among the offi- 
cials at Tokio of the condition of educational institutions throughout 
the Empire. 
_ Maintenance.—The law of 1879 classifies the schools in point of 
maintenance into public and private; the former being maintained by 
local taxation, or at the public expense of the cities, towns, or villages 
in which they are established; the latter being those which are estab-

_ lished and supported at the private expense of one or more individuals, 
In localities where school funds are deficient itinerary schools may be 
- established and school fees may be charged, or not, according to the 
needs of the locality. This local taxation does not do away, however, 
with appropriations from the Government, which are regularly made to 
the respective educational circuits. The grounds occupied by schools 
are generally exempted from taxation. In 1886 the maintenance of 
- elementary schools was changed somewhat. - Where formerly the expen- 
ses were defrayed out of the rates. of ward and village, they were to be 
supplied by school fees, and if money was obtained by contributions, it 
was to be available for the payment of expenses. When school fees 
and donations were not sufficient to defray the expenses, the deficiency 
was to be supplied out of town or villagerates. If local circumstances 
- made it necessary a simpler elementary course might be substituted for 
the ordinary elementary course and the town or village pay the expenses, 
even to the salaries of teachers, out of the village taxes. The national 
_ treasury was to support one higher normal school; each Fu or Ken to 
- support a lower grade normal from the local taxes and a lower grade 
secondary school. A higher secondary school was to be established in 
each of the five districts into which Japan was divided; its expenses to 
be paid partly by the national treasury and partly by local taxes of the 
Fu or Ken of the circuit. In the Hokkaido and Okinawa Ken the ex- 
penses of normal and secondary schools were to be defrayed out of local 
supplies paid from the national exchequer, and the elementary schools 
established by towns and villages were to be aided partly by local 
taxes. By imperial ordinance of 1886 it was prescribed that regulations 
for the management of school funds should be established by the Goy- 
ernors, namely, the Fu Chiji or Ken Rei. By this provision not only 
the school funds, but also the sites, school lands, buildings, books, and 
apparatus were not to be diverted to other uses. According to im- 
perial decree of 1890 cities, towns, or villages, or town and village school 
unions are to maintain elementary schools as follows: 
_ To provide and maintain school buildings, school sites, school appliances, gym- 
nastic halls, and lands for practical training in agriculture; to provide for the sala- 
ries, traveling expenses, etc., of elementary schoolteachers; and to provide for such 
miscellaneous expenses as are incurred in connection with elementary schools. 
The maintenance of higher schools does not seem to be changed from 
' the earlier conditions mentioned above. 
STATISTICS, 
Before proceeding to give statistics it may be well to state that dur- 
ing the years 1886~90 many decrees, which bore directly upon educa- 
tion, were promulgated by the highest authorities; the Fu and Ken 
authorities rearranged their school districts, the school arrangements 
being so different in the various cities and counties that no comprehen- 
sive statement can be given; great alterations in boundaries of towns 
and villages were made, and there was general readjustment of school

properties. New laws for the organization of towns and villages were 
carried out as far as practical, and a corresponding increase in school 
districts was apparent. Seventeen Fus and Kens, in 1889, were awaiting 
the issuance of a revised ordinance for elementary schools before rear- 
ranging their school districts, and two Fus and twenty-six Kens had 
already commenced such reorganization so as to receive the benefit of 
the greater educational advantages which would naturally accrue from 
such change. To date of 1889 the most material advantages were felt 
from the influence indirectly exercised on education in towns and vil- 
lages by the operations of new laws for the organization of cities, towns, 
and villages. The rearrangement of school districts involved the 
~ establishment of new schools, the suspension of others, and the rear- 
rangement of school property. The general outcome of such efforts 
tended more directly toward an increase in the number of. schools, 
teachers, and pupils, and in the amount of income and expenditure. 
The local authorities, aiding in the general tendency toward prog- 
ress, had in view measures leading to an improvement in the standard 
of teachers, to a greater accumulation of school funds, and to a wider 
diffusion of education for women. The principal events of these years, 
naturally leading to the statistical presentation which follows, may be 
summed up by stating that the educational laws in force were found to 
be contradictory in spirit to the laws which were passed in regard 
to the organization of cities, towns, and villages. In order to keep 
abreast with the reorganization mentioned above a general school revision 
must necessarily follow; then came the promulgation of general regu- 
lations relating to local education; imperial ordinances relating to ele- 
mentary schools, laws relating to salaries of directors of Fu and Ken 
normal schools; relating to pensions to retired officials, or to their 
families in case of decease; relating to retired teachers and the families 
of deceased teachers in city, town, or village elementary schools. As a 
climax to these movements the Emperor addressed his people, and in 
his speech, while considering the subject of education, he especially 
called attention to the necessity of a firm establishment of a standard 
of moral education, and of a course of conduct to be followed by chil- 
dren. The main points of these various ordinances and laws will be 
presented under the various heads into which this paper is divided. 
_ In 1890 the population of Japan was 20,932,367 males, 20,389,638 
females; total, 41,322,005. The school districts numbered 12,383. 
The school population numbered 7,195,412 (males, 3,765,984; females, 
3,429,428). The number of pupils receiving instruction, expressed in 
its percentage to school population, was 48.95. The number of pupils 
to total population, expressed in percentage, was 7.79. Of the whole 
number in school 3,520,718 were receiving the prescribed course of in- 
struction, and 3,674,694 were not receiving the regulation course. The 
institutions under the control of the department of education include 
1 university, 7 higher secondary schools, 2 higher normal schools, 4 spe 
cial schools, 1 school for the blind and dumb, and several schools and

kindergiirten attached to the higher normals. The pupils in the above- 
mentioned schools were 7,160; graduates, 926. This does not include 
pupils in the elementary courses attached to the higher normals. The 
expenditure by the department for school purposes was 1,100,689 
yen.) Special expenditure, 265,312 yen. Under the control of the local 
authorities were 26,012 elementary schools, 47 lower grade normal 
schools, 54 lower grads secondary schools, 30 higher schools for girls, 
55 special schools, and 1,650 miscellaneous schools, the total being 
27,846. Of this number 25,425 were public and 2,421 private estab- 
lishments. The number of instructors and teachers was 74,024, that 
of pupils, 3,211,931. In the publie schools 311,505 pupils had com- 
pleted their courses of study, and 17,823 in the private schools. The 
amount of expenditure for the public schools was 8,675,140 yen. It 
may here be stated that although the imperial ordinance relating to 
elementary schools had been promulgated in the year 188990 it had 
not yet been carried into effect on account of the various accessory 
ordinances which must necessarily be issued. The efforts of the author- 
ities during the year were directed toward completing such measures 
"as had been undertaken in the previous year. The following table 
more clearly presents the classification of schools than can be done by 
any other method. The majority of the elementary and higher schools 
are supported by Government and by local rates.

As will be observed, the number of elementary schools was 26,017. 
The number of school buildings for elementary schools newly constructed 
during the year was 731; the expenditures for the same being about 
413,965 yen. The average number of new buildings for each Fu or Ken 
was 16; the amount of expense for each school, 566 yen. The number 
of teachers (including pupil teachers) in elementary schools was 31 in 
the Government schools, 66,463 in the public schools, and 1,236 in pri- 
vate schools. That is a total of 67,730. The average number of pupils 
for each teacher was 46.7, both in public and private schools; the aver- 
age number of teachers for each school is 2.63 in public schools, 1.68 in 
private schools. These averages are apt to be misleading, however, as 
in the Ken of Loyama there were 74 pupils under the care of a teacher, 
and in the Ken of Nagano there were only 26. The average paid to 
teachers of these grades ranged between 144 and 75 yen in some of the 
Kens, and between 420 and 30 in other Kens, while the highest annual 
salary was 600 yen. The total number of pupils was 3,096,400, of whom 
570 attended the Government schools, 3,038,032 the public schools, and 
57,798 the private schools. The number of those who have completed 
the elementary course was 315,054, of whom 17,956 belonged to the 
higher elementary, 229,447 to the second division of the elementary 
-schools, and 67,651 to the simpler elementary course. The average 
number of pupils in daily attendance, expressed in per cent, was 72.37 
in the public schools and 84.54 in the private schools. 
In Japan importance is attached to infant training, and an annual 
increase in the number of kindergirten is reported. In 1890 there 
were 138 of these schools, 99 of them Governmental and 39 private 
ones. The number of conductors was 271, of children in attendance, 
7,486 (4,185 boys, 3,301 girls). As regards the prosperity of the 
kindergiirten, those in the Fu of Tokio, Kioto, and Osaka take a first 
rank. A dearth of conductors there and elsewhere was reported, and 
this necessitated the opening, in connection with the normal school in 
Tokyo, of an institute for the training of teachers for infant schools, 
from which institute cight conductors were graduated in 1890. A pri- 
vate educational society of Tokio also established an institute of kin- 
dergarten conductors and sent out twenty persons to fill the kinder- 
garten ranks. 
The normal schools were affected by a revision in their regulations in 
1886. Since that date great attention has been paid to the opening of 
new schools, to the furnishing of apparatus and appliances, and to the 
mode of teaching the subjects of study newly introduced. The num- 
ber of lower grade normal schools in 1890 was 47, with 579 male and 45 
female teachers; 4,410 male, and 885 female pupils; the graduates 
‘numbered 810 males, and 132 females. The annual expenditure during 
the year 1890 amounted to 800,307.186 yen; the greatest average amount 
for each pupil was 298 yen; the smallest average amount 82 yen, while 
the general average was 151.44 yen. The two higher normal schools
-P-A-G-E-307

under the control of the Department, ¢. ¢., the Tokio Higher Normal 
School and the Tokio Female Normal School had their pupils dis- 
tributed as follows: Nineteen Japanese instructors, 1 foreigner, 23 
pupils each in the physical, chemical, and literary course, and 30 in the 
biological course; 15 graduates in the biological course, and 4 in the 
elective course, these graduates being now engaged in lower grade nor- 
mal and secondary schools. In the elementary school attached to the 
higher normal were 423 pupils. The Tokio Educational Museum at- 
tached to the school contained 14,661 objects, and had been visited. by 
9,770 persons during the year. The amount of expenditure was 51,160,293 
yen for the Higher Normal. In the Higher Female Normal School 
there were 10 Japanese instructors and 86 pupils. Thirteen pupils 
graduated in the female normal course and eight in the elementary 
normal course, The teachers in the attached elementary school num- 
bered 71 Japanese, with 213 pupils. In the kindergarten there were 7 
-conductorsand183children. Theexpenditure amounted to 30,608.67 yen. 
The lower grade secondary schools, 55 in number, had 650 Japanese 
and 3 foreign instructors; pupils, 11,620; graduates for the year, 529, 
The expenditure of the secondary schools established by Fu and Ken 
was 297,458.597 yen, an average rate for each school of 6,917 yen;- for 
each pupil 29,998 yen. About 25 per cent of the pupils leave school be- 
fore graduation, especially from the classes of the fourth and fifth years. 
The private secondary schools numbered 11; instructors 98; pupils 
1,638; graduates 36; expenditure 28,170.701 yen; amount for each pupil 
17.198. The 7 higher secondary schools had 320 Japanese and 15 foreign 
instructors, with 3,037 pupils in the main schools and 1,319 in the med- 
ical departments. Graduates during the year numbered 200 pupils in 
the main schools and 173 in the medical departments. Classified ac- 
cording to social orders there were 7 Kwazoku (peers); 1,784 Shizoku 
(military class), and 1,246 Heimin (the common people) in the medical 
departments. The expenditure during the year was 433,757.834 yen. 
Lack of solid foundation is reported from some of the higher female 
schools, but this comes in part from the long years of neglect of female 
education, and in part from the fact that many of them are simply ad- 
juncts of the lower grade secondary schools, so that no separate reports 
from these can be made. The higher female schools under control of 
Fu and Ken numbered 7 public and 22 private establishments, 132 
maleand 148 female Japanese instructors, and 17 foreign female teachers 8 
pupils 2,983; graduates 317. The Imperial University is under the 
control of the Minister of State for Education, and depends for its 
revenue upon annual allowances from the treasury of the Imperial Goy- 
ernment. Its tuition fees and other sources of income are allowed to 
aecumulate year by year so as to have a large fund, a portion of which 
may, however, be paid out from time to time. The statistics of the 
university and its different departments may be best presented in the 
following table for 1890. The special changes in course of study and 
the general progress will be indicated on pages 298-299,

The College of Agriculture was first established in June, 1890, it being 
in reality a transfer of the Tokio Dendrological School to the univer- 
sity, and its course was made to extend over three years. Attached to 
the university are the library, botanic garden, astronomical observa- 
tory, and hospitals of the medical college. 
The number of Government special schools is clearly indicated in the

During the year 1890 the apprentices’ school for merchants and 
artisans was transferred from the higher commercial school to the 
Tokio Technical School. The latter, formerly designed to train tech- 
nologists, foremen and superintendents of factories, was changed to 
that of a school for preparing foremen and teachers of industries. The 
total number of public special schools was 53; instructors, 636; pupils, 
11,729; graduates, 2,470. Among the pupils 5,521 were studying law; 
next in point of numbers were the pupils studying medicine, 1,521; 
commerce, 1,338, and mathematics, 1,257. The school of engineering 
had 593 pupils; agriculture, 427; literature, 3903 philosophy, 288; sur- 
veying, 128; drawing, 94; veterinary surgery, 74; political economy, 
54; navigation, 3. The number of pupils studying agricultural and 
commercial branches is steadily increasing, but as compared with the 
law schools those institutions are not prosperous as yet. 
The miscellaneous schools maintained by public funds are not es- 
pecially numerous, but they include a variety of subjects, and the 
private establishments not only make out in point of numbers what the 
public schools lack, but also show the tendency of training towards 
various professions. Hence a table is here appended:

The school age is defined according to imperial ordinance as “ the 
period of eight years between the sixth and fourteenth years of the 
child’s age.” The guardians or parents are under obligations “to 
eause such children to attend school until they have completed the 
lower elementary school course,” this obligation “to take effect from 
the beginning of the school year subsequent to the child’s obtaining 
school age.” Guardians are to send “children of school age to the 
city, town, or village elementary schools, or to the private elementary 
schools to be substituted for them, but in case they desire to giye the 
lower elementary school course to their children of school age at their 
own homes or at any other places, the approval of the highest official 
of city, town, or village must first be obtained.” 
The length of the school year is not specifically stated, but itis decreed 
that the number of holidays shall not exceed ninety, exclusive of Sun- 
days. This rule does not apply, however, to apprentices’ schools, 
supplementary schools for technical instruction, and supplementary 
courses. 
In the university the academic year begins on the 11th of September 
and ends on the 10th of July, and the year is divided into three terms. 
The first is from September 11 to December 24 (105 days); the second 
from January 8 to March 31 (83 days); the third from April 8 to July 
10 (94 days). 
FINANCE. 
Income.—The funds of the schools established by the different de- 
partments are supplied from the national treasury, and consequently 
out of the appropriation intended for the use of the respective depart- 
ments. The funds of schools established by Fu and Ken are supplied 
from the local taxes paid by the people of the respective Fu and Ken. 
In some cases the money contributed and the tuition fees are added to 
the local tax to make up the fund, or sometimes a part of it is supplied 
by governmental subsidies. Tuition fees are considered part of the 
resources of cities, towns, and villages. The funds of schools, ete., 
established by wards or villages are supplied from the public funds of 
wards or villages. Sums of money contributed, tuition fees, and money 
realized from school lands are added also to the fund. Private schools 
are maintained by the fees demanded for instruction or by the contri- 
butions from private individuals. 
The grounds oceupied by schools, which are organized by the differ- 
ent departments, are in every case Government lands. The grounds 
occupied by schools established: by Fu or Ken are also in most cases 
Government lands, but in a few cases land jointly owned by the people 
is added to the Government land. The grounds occupied by schools 
organized by the wards or villages are jointly owned by the people or 
are sometimes the property of private individuals. 
When wards or villages establish at the public expense any schools,
-P-A-G-E-311
  THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM OF JAPAN. 279 
such as elementary, secondary, professional, agricultural, commercial, or 
industrial schools, Government land not in use, if there be any in the 
place, is granted for school purposes at the request of the people of 
the locality. 
The proportion is as follows: Five hundred tsubo (1 tsubo is about 
36 square feet) for each elementary school and 1,000 tsubo for any other 
school. The land actually oceupied by the schools is exempted from 
taxation. Again,-the land possessed by all public agricultural schools 
and provided for practical or experimental use is exempted from taxa- 
tion in the proportion of 5 ché (3,000 tsubo) for each school, and when 
Government land is required to provide farms for practical or experi- 
mental use, land not exceeding 5 ché is granted for such use without 
any payment or rent being required. a 
Prior to the Restoration (1868) the expenditures of scholastic institu- 
tions were defrayed out of the national treasury or by the provincial goy- 
ernments. After thedepartment of education was established, school 
fees were made the principal source of income, and additional aid was 
granted from the treasury to the schools under direct control of the 
department. The schools under Fu and Ken were aided by school 
district rates, voluntarily contributions, and interest accruing from ac- 
cumulated school funds. In 1878 great changes were effected in pro- 
vincial financial administration. The expenses of schools established ~ 
by Fu and Ken were defrayed out of local taxes, and if the towns or 
villages needed aid from local taxes, the local assemblies decided upon 
the amount to be given for such purpose. The taxes levied were (1) 
one-fifth or less (afterwards increased to one-third) of the land tax; (2) 
licenses and other miscellaneous taxes; (3) taxes on inhabited houses. 
The law of 1879 left it to the discretion of local authorities whether 
school fees should be charged or remitted. This greatly decreased the 
income from school fees and increased village rates. The regulations 
of 1884 restricted the powers of local assemblies; Ku, town and vil- 
lage rates were assessed on the value of lands, or licenses, and onevery 
Jandowner. A limitation wasplaced upon the rates in 1885, so that they 
were not to exceed one-seventeenth of the land tax. This caused a de- 
crease of more than 10,000 yen ina single Fu or Ken. In 1886 the 
general regulations prescribed that school fees should be appropriated 
for the support of higher and lower grade elementary schools of Fu and 
Ken. To these were to be added such sources of income as voluntary 
contributions, etc. If simple elementary courses took the place of the 
ordinary elementary school, then the same should be maintained out of 
Ku, town, or village rates, and the salaries of teachers out of local taxes. 
Investigations extending over a series of years, in regard to the main- 
tenance of lower and higher grade elementary schools, indicated that, 
in 1888, of the total number of schools nearly seven-tenths required 
no assistance from city, town, and village rates; in 1889 none was re- 
quired from five-tenths of the number; in 1890 the proportion went down
-P-A-G-E-312
  280 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. ‘ 
to four-tenths. This was attributed to the decrease in the amount of 
school fees and voluntary contributions. Formerly the amount of city, 
town, and village rates was not allowed to exceed half the amount of 
school expenditure, but alterations in local administration changed 
matters; the amount of tuition fees in ordinary grades decreased and 
contributions diminished. The amount of income of public schools in 
1890 from tuition fees was 2,221,534.528 yen; from voluntary contribu- 
tions, 428,295.328; interest on various funds, 441,856.050; city, town, 
and village rates, 4,518,458.401; local taxes, 1,145,372.052; miscellane- 
ous, 224,627.062; a total of 9,879,808.143 yen. The rate per cent of 
popelation! was 0.239. An increase in the items of city, town, and vil- 
lage rates, school fees, and miscellaneous income was manifest over the 
preceding year, but a decrease in the other items. Of the above in- 
come the portion chiefly appropriated to the support of elementary 
schools was 8,371,289.836 yen, showing an increase over the previous 
year of 275,574,809.

An investigation of the amount of school fees paid indicates that 
none of the pupils pay less than 5 sen (5 cents) in the Ken of Saitama, 
Chiba, Tochigi, Aomori, Yamagata, Akita, Gifu, and Okayama, while 
in the Ken of Ishikawa, Oita, Saga, and Kumamoto none pay more 
than 30 sen (30 cents). In the Fu of Tokio one-half of the total num- 
ber of pupils pay over 30 sen (30 cents). In the Ken of Miyazaki, 
Kagoshima, and Okinawa 25 sen is the highest fee paid by the pupils.

  THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM OF JAPAN. 281 
Expenditure.—The expenditure of the department of education dur- 
ing 1890 was as follows: General expenses, 184,198.093 yen; expendi- 
ture for building official residences for private secretaries to the min- 
ister, 3,375.616 yen; various other buildings, 2,052.253; for building 
elementary schoolhouses to be exhibited at the National Industrial Ex- 
hibition, 699.455; special expenses for foreign journeys, 6,261.600; total, 
196,587,017 yen. The amount of expenditure paid out by the Govern- 
ment to the various institutions included: Imperial University, 
249,302.000 yen; school of agriculture and forestry, 38,194.000; higher 
normal school, 29,250,000; higher normal for females, 21,166.500; first 
higher secondary school, 66,371.250; second higher secondary school, 
33,518.250; third higher secondary school, 47,325.855; fourth higher 
secondary school, 33,540.000; fifth higher secondary school, 37,914.000; 
higher commercial school, 25,519.500; Tokio technical school, 26,491.500; 
Tokio Academy of Fine Arts, 13,125.000; Tokio Academy of Music, 
7,291.000; Tokio Blind and Dumb School, 2,250.000; Tokio library, 
6,000.000; total, 637,259.355 yen. The total amount for 1890 of Fu and 
Ken educational expenses, and of educational aid to cities, towns, and 
villages defrayed out of the local taxes voted by the Fu and Ken as- 
semblies, was 1,188,002.562 yen. This was divided as follows: Lower 
grade normal schools, 804,516.128 yen; lower grade secondary schools, 
238,991.769; special schools, 69,200.905; various schools, 12,518.902 
expenses for educational societies and educational encouragement, 
9,953.487; expenditure for pupils sent away from the jurisdiction of 
their respective Fu and Ken, 1,948.000; educational aid to cities, towns, 
and villages, 50,867.371. The total expenditure for the public schools 
in 1890 was 8,675,140.109 yen, which is itemized as follows:

There was also expended for kindergiirten 20,455.645 yen, and 19,- 
658.867 yen for other items, which makes a total of 8,675,140.109 yen, and 
the rate per pupil is 2.422 yen. Compared with the previous year, there 
is a general increase in all items for elementary schools, a decrease in the 
amount for secondary and special schools, while in normal and miscel- 
laneous schools an inerease has taken place in the amounts disbursed 
and in the average amount for each school, and a decrease in the aver- 
age amount for each pupil. 
SUPERVISION AND ADMINISTRATION, 
State control—The governmental supervision of education is under 
the department of education, which is one of ten departments. The 
minister of education has control over all affairs connected with edu- 
cation throughout the country, and with respect to educational affairs 
he superintends the governors of Fus and Kens. There are senior and 
junior vice-ministers, who assist him in the discharge of his duties; 
secretaries, who manage special business intrusted to them, under the 
orders of the minister, and subordinate officials who transact whatever 
business is assigned to each of them respectively. 
The minister of education prepares drafts inregard to the establish- 
ment and abrogation of such laws and regulations as are connected 
with education, and submits them to the Emperor for approval. He 
also signs such laws and regulations and is responsible for them. The 
minister has the right of nullifying any educational regulations made 
by the governors of Fus and Kens if such regulations do not meet with 
his approval. In order to carry on the business of the department the 
following bureaus are organized within the department, as is stated in 
the “ General Outlines of Education in Japan in 1884,” viz: 
Bureau of special school affairs (to conduct business concerning higher and special 
education); bureau of general school affairs (to conduct business concerning gen- 
eral education); bureau of compilation! (to conduct the business of writing and 
compiling books necessary to education); bureau of finance (to conduct financial 
business, constructions, and repairs); bureau of general business (to conduct busi- 
ness connected with official regulations for the officers of the several bureaus of the 
department, the schools under its control, and miscellaneous business not under- 
taken by the other bureaus); bureau of report (to conduct business concerning 
reports, statistics, etc., of education) ; office of private secretaries (belonging to the 
private office of the minister and vice-ministers, having charge of business concern- 
    
1A reorganization of these bureaus seems to take place from year to year, but the 
business transacted does not seem to vary greatly from what is stated above. In 1890 
the bureau of compilation was abolished and a division was created in the bureau of 
general supervision for the transaction of business. Again, in 1891, another reor- 
ganization took place, all bureaus of the department of education being abolished. 
The department was then reorganized with the minister’s cabinet, bureau of general 
school affairs, bureau of compilation, and bureau of treasury. A board of inspec- 
tion was also established in the department. These various reorganizations do not 
seem to have materially affected the general business mentioned above, hence tho 
changes are simply indicated in form of note. :

ing appointment, dismissal, promotion, etc., of officers under the control of the 
minister); documentary examiner’s office (to examine the drafts of laws and regu- 
lations); office of prize affairs (to conduct business connected with the pensions of 
teachers and with educational awards); institute of musie (to conduct business 
concerning inquiries as to singing and general improvement in music); office of 
reports for the Government Gazette (to conduct the business of collecting and 
arranging, in proper order, the laws, regulations, writings, reports, etc., necessary 
to education which are to be published in Kuwanto (the Government Gazette). The 
chief of each of these bureaus has a secretary, and in some cases an assistant chief 
is also appointed. 
The minister and vice-minister visit from time to time the schools of Fu and Ken, 
or send subordinate officials to every place to inspect the actual condition of educa- 
tion. Those officers afterwards present reports to the minister concerning theresults 
of their inspection. The governors are bound to present every year detailed reports 
of education within their jurisdiction; and the heads of the school under the control 
of the Department are also obliged to present reports on the results of instruction. 
The minister then has all these reports arranged in proper order, and after making 
his own remarks, and adding statistics, presents them to the Emperor under the title 
of the Annual Report of the Department of Education. This report is afterwards 
made public to show the condition of local education. 
The minister of education has organized an academy in order to inquire into mat- 
ters concerning education and to discuss subjects connected with the science and 
art of education. The members were chosen by the minister himself, and the re- 
mainder haye been elected from time to time by the vote of the members, their tenure 
of office being one year. As arule, they meet once a month in the department of 
education. The directors, librarians, curators, teachers, ete., of the schools, libraries, 
museums, etc., under the control of the department of education are appointed and 
dismissed in different ways, according to their rank, those of the class of Sdnin by 
the vice-minister of education and those of the class of Hannin by the minister 
himself. 
Since the presentation of the above regulations for State supervision 
of educational affairs there have been minor changes, particularly ih 
1885 and 1886, but in the main the officers are the same. The minister of 
education? is now called the minister of state for education, and there is 
one vice-minister of state for education in place of the senior and junior 
men of previous years, but these modifications do not materially 
modify the above statement. 
Local control is, as heretofore stated, not uniform. Sometimes there 
are committees of inspection appointed from among the school officers, 
or the inspections are conducted by officials of Gun or Ku. In six- 
teen Kens supervising teachers are appointed for the purpose of im- 
proving educational systems. In other Kens teachers of normal schools 
exercise such supervision. In general, it may be stated that all the 
  
1Although educational affairs throughout the Empire are under the control of 
the minister of state for education there are schools for the teaching of special 
subjects under the control of and maintained by other governmental departments, é. 
e., the department of the imperial household; the military and naval departments; 
the department of justice; the department of agriculture and commerce; the 
department of communications, and the Hokkaidé administration board. The 
high standard which these institutjons have attained will be brought out on the 
following pages.  
-P-A-G-E-316
  284 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
local authorities attend to the educational administration in their 
respective districts. 
In 1884 the local regulations were as follows, and the changes since 
have not materially modified the provisions: 
There are school committees specially organized in wards or villages to conduct 
the various matters concerning the school attendance of children, the establishment 
and maintenance of shools, etc., under the supervision of the governor. They are 
nominated in each school district by the people of that district, and then the goy- 
ernor selects a certain number of those thus nominated. The tenure of office of 
the school committees is not less than fonr years, and is fixed according to circum- 
stances. Their number, salaries, etc., are determined by the ward or village 
assembly with the approval of the governor. In case any committceman is inca- 
pable of discharging his duty, after he has been appointed, the governor causes 
another nomination to be made. 
Persons qualified to serve as members of school committces, or to take part in the 
appointment of the same, must be males upwards of 20 years of age, possessing 
either Jands or buildings, and having both legal and actual residence within their 
respective school districts. The Koché takes part in the business of school com- 
mittecs in his own school district. 
When several wards or villages unite together and establish such schools as pro- 
fessional schools, middle schools, etc., independent of the limit of the school district 
in which elementary schools are organized, they nominate special school committees 
wiéghin the limit of the school district thus formed. ‘The regulations as to the mode 
of nomination, appointment, functions, ete., are the same as those adopted in the 
case of school committees of school districts. Regular educational inspection takes 
place annually, and there are special educational tours made by officials designated 
for that purpose. 
This is, as far as can be ascertained, the general method of procedure 
in the diverse districts on the many islands comprising the Empire of 
-Japan. From year to year there are variations of the same, but to 
date there seem to be no permanent changes materially affecting the 
, above statement. 
TEACHERS, 
Preparation.—The law appertaining to education is very explicit in 
regard to the preparation of teachers. According to the various articles 
therein contained normal schools for the training of teachers for elemen- 
tary schools are to be established in each Fu or Ken; they are to grant 
certificates to theirown and other students who, upon examination, are 
found to be duly qualified; teachers! of either sex are to be over 18 years 
of age; all teachers? of elementary schools must possess a certificate 
from a Government or normal school. The first normal school dates 
from 1872 and was founded with senior and junior classes in Tokio. A 
foreign teacher was employed who taught the seniors as if they were 
pupils of an elementary school, and they, while thus learning methods 
  
1No persons guilty of immoral conduct shall be employed as teachers. 
2 It shall be lawful for any person to be employed as a teacher within the jurisdic- 
tion of Fu or Ken without a certificate from a normal school, provided he possesses 
a teacher’s license granted by the governor of said Fu or Ken,

  THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM OF JAPAN. 285 
oi teaching, in turn gave instruction to the junior pupils. Soon after 
a practice school was established, so that the pupils might be better 
grounded in methods, and in 1873 normal school courses with higher 
and lower grades were instituted. So great was the call for women ” 
teachers that, in 1874, a normal school for women was established in 
Tokio, which school was merged into the Tokio Normal School in 1885, 
Admission to normal schools of persons above seventeen years of 
age was based upon good moral character, sound health and constitu- 
tion, and attainments equivalent to those of graduates of the second 
division of elementary schools. The course of study at this early date 
was modified from year to year, but general regulations governing the 
normal schools were first issued in 1883. The instruction was based 
upon “the fundamental principles of human relations, such as loyalty 
and filial conduct.” The number of pupils to be admitted was fixed 
at ‘one for every 1,500 of school population within each jurisdiction.” 
Pupil’s expenses “were as a rule to be paid out of the school allowance, 
with a provision that the same expenses might be granted as loans, 
or some of the pupils might be admitted at their own expense, accord- 
ing to the discretion of the highest officials of city or province. From 
1883 on, steady progress was observed in the work of normal-school] 
training. This was due in part to methods introduced by students 
who had been sent to foreign countries to investigate normal-school 
matters, and who had returned and engaged in the work of education, 
In 1886, according to a decree promulgated by the Emperor, normal 
schools were divided into higher and lower grade normal schools. The 
higher normal was to be established at Tokio under the direct control of 
the minister of state for education, and in each Fu and Ken there was 
to be a lower grade normal school. The object of the higher normal is 
to train directors and instructors of lower grade normal schools; that 
of the lower grade normal is to train the directors and instructors of 
public elementary schools, All expenses of pupils are to be paid out of 
the school allowance. Included in the course of study in normal schools 
is military drill, for it is conceded that “the proper aim of normal 
training is to develop in pupils the characteristics of obedience, sympa- 
thy, and dignity.” The four years’ course of study in the lower grade 
normal school includes ethics, science of education, Japanese lan- 
guage, Chinese literature, English language, mathematics, bookkeep- 
ing, geography, history, natural science, physics, chemistry, agricul- 
ture, handiwork, household management, writing, drawing, music, and 
gymnastics. The male pupils are taught’agriculture, handiwork, and 
military exercises; the women learn domestic economy. The regula- 
tions for admission to the lower grade normals require a completion of 
the higher elementary course, legal residence within Fu or Ken, and 
that the pupil be between 17 and 20 years of age, if men, and between 
15 and 20,if women. Graduates of lower grade normals are under 
obligation to serve as teachers during a ten years’ period.
-P-A-G-E-318
286 EDUCATION REPORT, 1390-91. 
The higher normal school is divided into three sections, 7. e. (1) 
physical and chemical science; (2), natural science; (3), literature. 
The first includes the science of education, ethics, English language, 
mathematics, physics, chemistry, handiwerk and drawing, music, and 
gymnastics; the second (in addition to the science of education, ethics, 
the English language, drawing, music, and gymnastics) has organic 
chemistry, mineralogy, geology, botany, zodlogy, physiology, and agri- 
culture; the third (in addition to the science of education, ethics, music 
and gymnastics, and English language) includes Japanese language 
and Chinese literature, geography, history, political economy, and phi- 
losophy. The course of study in the woman’s division varies somewhat 
from the above, but includes housekeeping and household management. 
Admission to the higher normal is from the normal schools of Fu or 
Ken, or from among persons of literary and other qualifications when 
nominated by the governing officials of Fu or Ken, and selected by 
the director of the higher normal school. The male graduates are to 
serve for ten years after graduation, three years of which must be in 
such schools, and at such salaries as the department of education may 
decide. The women are under obligation to service in schools for five 
= years after graduation, for the first two years in any schools to which 
the department of education may assign them. 
Licensing and appointment.—Candidates for the position of teacher in 
elementary schools must be upward of eighteen years of age, and must 
possess either the certificate of a normal school, a teacher’s license, or 
certificate of qualification in a certain subject given by the governor of 
Fu or Ken. .The length of time for which certificates are granted is 
mentioned above. The normal certificate is good for the whole coun- 
try; the license given by the governor is only available within the 
jurisdiction whence given. The teacher’s license is given by the goy- 
ernor after examination concerning the candidate’s knowledge, in 
accordance with the directions for granting teacher’s licenses! issued 
  
1 Regulations (1886) are as follows: There are general and local licenses; the 
former granted by the minister and valid throughout the country; the latter by the 
governor of Fu or Ken, and valid within the jurisdiction whence issued. General 
licenses are valid for life; local, for life or a stated period, i. e., five years, with 
privilege of renewal if the person be competent. General licenses are granted to 
graduates of the higher normal, or to those who, having possessed local licenses, and 
having served five years or upward, are eminent both in attainments and teaching. 
Local licenses are granted to graduates of the lower grade normal schools, or to those 
who have passed the examinations for elementary-school teachers. The examina- 
tions for elementary-schobl teachers are to be conducted in accordance with the “‘sub- 
jects of study and the standard to be attained in the lower grade normal schools.” 
Licenses are not to be granted to (1) those who have been subject to imprisonment or 
who have committed a crime against public morality; (2) who have been subject to 
punishment for gambling; (3) who have been adjudged bankrupt and not discharged 
their obligations; (4) guilty of minor debts, drunkenness, or violence; (5) subject 
to penal servitude, imprisonment, or solitary confinement, according to law. The 
regulations require that fees shall be paid by those who undergo examinations, and 
by those who receive licenses for elementary-school teachers.  
-P-A-G-E-319
  
  THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM OF JAPAN. as BBE 
by the minister of state for education. The license enables the person 
to teach in one of the three courses of elementary schools according to 
the capacity shown in the examination. In any locality where no 
teacher can be found qualified for any one of the elementary divisions, 
then those qualified for any one or for several subjects may be substi- 
tuted. Scholars eminent in learning, who are competent to instruct in 
moral teaching, or those who have a good knowledge of agriculture, 
industry, and commerce, may obtain teachers’ licenses for the particular 
subject without examination. Teachers of schools which belong to 
ward or village [an elementary-school district may consist of a single 
ward or village or of several wards or villages combined] shall be ap- 
pointed or dismissed by the governor of Fu or Ken at the request of 
the school committees. The regulations promulgated by the depart- 
ment of education as to the licensing of school-teachers are as follows: 
Licenses as instructors in lower grade normal schools are to be granted to graduates 
of the male normal course; licenses as instructors in the female lower grade normal- 
school course are to be granted to graduates of the female normal course, and 
licenses as instructors of gymnastics to be granted to graduates of the special course 
of gymnastics in the higher normal school. 
Licenses may be granted to nongraduates after an examination in 
one or more subjects of the lower grade normal-school course, and in 
regard to moral character and physical constitution. 
The teachers of secondary schools must be either normal graduates or 
university graduates. Still the governor of Fu or Ken may engage 
persons whom he considers qualified for such purpose, licenses being 
given after an examination as to moral conduct and intellectual attain- 
ments: Men of known learning, and who are skilled in imparting 
instruction, who hold diplomas of some kind or other and are known 
to have knowledge of agriculture, industry, and commerce, may be 
exempted from such examinations. 
The examinations and tenure of office are so clearly presented in the 
regulations governing licensing and appointment that no more detailed 
statement seems necessary. In 1891 it was determined that provisional 
licenses should be granted, if deemed necessary from local considera- 
tions, to candidates for the post of elementary school teachers after 
due inquiry as to the qualifications of such persons. 
Salaries.—The rank and salary of the directors and teachers of pub- 
lic schools are determined by the governor of Fu or Ken, subject to 
the approval of the minister of state for education. The rank and 
  
1 The subjects of study to show the intellectual attainments of the candidate include — 
Japanese and Chinese literature, English, French, and German; arithmetic, algebra, 
geometry, trigonometry, analytical geometry, mechanics, surveying, astronomy, 
physiology, zodlogy, botany, mineralogy, geology, physics, chemistry, geography, his- 
tory, political economy, Japanese law, mental science, logic, science of education, 
writing, drawing, bookkeeping, singing, gymnastics, agriculture, industry, and 
ecommerce. Candidates are to be examined in one or more of these subjects accord- 
ing to choice. The license indicates the subjects in which examined,

salary of directors and teachers of the schools prganized by other 
departments than that of education are determined by the ministers of 
the respective departments, and are therefore different one from the 
other. The salaries of teachers are in part paid out of the local taxes. 
The officials in charge of such matter in cities, towns, and villages are 
to make provision for paying “the salaries, traveling expenses, etec., of 
elementary teachers,” the amounts to be fixed by the Fu Chiji and Ken 
Dhiji after consultation with the city council or similar officials in 
towns or villages. 
The right to the use of a certain area of land or payment in kind may be substi- 
tuted for certain portions of the salaries of teachers in city, town, or village ele- 
mentary schools, the proportion to be fixed by the Fu Chiji or Ken Chiji, subject to 
the approval of the minister of state for education. 
The salaries of directors of Fu or Ken normal schools are to be paid 
out of the national treasury. The titles and quasi-official ranks of 
persons employed in Fu or Ken ward or village school consist, in

thirteenth rank, and of instructors and assistant instructors from the 
first through the third rank; in elementary schools of directors from 
the eleventh through the seventeenth rank, and of teachers from the 
first through the seventh rank. The rank and title of persons employed 
in professional schools, agricultural, commercial, and industrial schools, 
are established in conformity with the above. The amount of salary 
given in the university and in the governmental schools under the con- 
trol of the department of education is as follows:

Pensions.—The granting of pensions is decided by the minister of 
state for education on certificates presented by the Fu Chiji or Ken Chiji. 
The directors and regular teachers in normal, public secondary schools, 
and the teachers of elementary schools who have been in office more than 
fifteen years receive life pensions when they have been ordered to retire 
after having attained 60 years or have retired owing to physical disa- 
bility, or because of the closing or reorganization of schools. Those 
who come under any of the following conditions shall receive life pen-

THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM OF JAPAN. - 289 
sions and be granted additional pensions up to seven-tenths of the 
minimum sum of such pensions, though their years of service may not 
amount to the above, viz, if they have lost one or more limbs or met 
with similar accident, or had long sickness unfitting them for discharge 
of duty. As regards the officials of the Government or public schools, 
who are to be put on the same footing as the directors and regular 
teachers, and who have been transferred as such to any of the latter 
schools, the years of service in their former schools shall be included in 
computing the term of service for granting pensions. They are dis- 
qualified, however, from receiving pensions if they have committed 
acts warranting dismissal, have been subjected to imprisonment, have 
lost their status as Japanese subjects, have engaged in the public 
service without permission from Fu Chiji or Ken Chiji, have retired 
from office for their own convenience before, attaining 60 years. Pro- 
' visional teachers in normal, secondary, or elementary schools receive life 
pensions equal to one-fourth of salary at time of retirement. 
The directors and regular teachers in Fu or Ken normal schools, and 
in public secondary schools, shall be granted a sum equal to one month’s 
salary received at the time they retire, in case of retirement after 
service of more than one year or less than five years, or a sum equal 
to two months’ salary in case of retirement after service of more than 
five years or less than eleven years, or a sum equal to three months’ 
salary in case of retirement after service of more than eleven years or 
less than fifteen years. The amount is to be provided for by the city, 
town, or village where the persons belong at time of retirement. The 
regular teachers in city, town, or village elementary schools shall be 
granted a sum equal to two months’ salary in case of retirement after 
more than five years or less than eleven years’ service, or a sum equal 
- to three months’ salary in case of retirement after more than eleven 
years or less than fifteen years’ service. The families of deceased direc- 
tors and teachers are also entitled to pensions, if the minister of state 
for education approves, and the Fu Chiji and Ken Chiji request it. 
Directors and regular teachers of normal or secondary schools shall 
pay in annually 1 per cent of their salary into the national treasury, ~ 
and regular teachers of elementary schools the same amount into the 
funds of Fu and Ken where they are teaching. The city, town, and 
village, wherever any of the above schools are situated, are also to pay 
in a like amount to serve as a pension fund for teachers of different 
grades. Pensions to retired directors and teachers, pensions and aid 
to the families of deceased directors and teachers are to be paid out of 
the grant made by the national treasury, out of the interest of the pen- 
sion fund, or from other sources of income. 
Teachers’ Institutes and Educational Societies.—The institutes were 
formed as early as the year 1872, “for the purpose of discussing and 
investigating methods of teaching.” In 1876 educational officers, school 
district officials, school teachers, and other officials formed a society for 
the discussion of important points connected with educational organi-

zation. Its meetings were held in Tokio, and the discussions were lim- 
- ited to educational administration. From that date on various associ- 
ations were formed in different parts of the Empire and the discussions 
became’ more general in character. Societies of this character are 
noticed under Supplementary Institutions. 
COURSES OF STUDY. 
The Japanese consider the kindergarten to be the basis of education, 
inasmuch as it fosters in the infant mind good habits and moral in- 
struction, while giving the first impetus to the expanding of the intel- 
lectual faculties, and greatly promoting the physical development. In 
connection with the Tokio Female Normal School the first kindergar- 
_ ten of Japan came into existence in 1876. The children, if not less 
_ than 3 years and not more than 6 years of age, were divided into three 
groups, according to ages, and the organization of the school was ac- 
cording to Froebel methods. In 1878 a training course was estab- 
lished for persons between 20 and 40 years of age who desired to be 
kindergarten teachers, and who were of good moral character, of sound 
health and constitution, able to read ordinary writing, and were pos- 
sessed of a general knowledge of arithmetic. In 1880 kindergarten 
teaching was included in the curriculum of the female normal school 
for one year previous to graduation. The year 1884 brought about a 
revision of kindergarten regulations; instead of three groups- there 
was an expansion into six groups, and all infants under school age 
were to be trained according to the Froebel system. The school con- 
nected with the normal was made a model for other kindergiirten, a 
school fee of 1 yen (99.7 cents) a month was charged, and the following 
schedule of study was adopted. The figures show the number of exer- 
cises each week.. Twenty minutes each is given to moral instruction 
and to various object lessons; thirty minutes each to the other exer- 
cises and lessons.

  < rome EDUCATIONAL ‘SYSTEM OF JAPAN. : 291 & 
The Rambiky schools are designed to give children the rudiments 
of moral and intellectual education adapted to make them good mem- 
bers of the community, together with such general knowledge and skill 
as are necessary for practical life, due attention being paid to their 
bodily development. As heretofore stated the elementary schools are 
divided into lower elementary and higher elementary schools. The 
course in the former extends over three or four years; in the latter over 
two, three or four years. Supplementary courses of a more elementary 
or a higher course may be established in both of these groups of ele- 
mentary schools. Apprentices’ schools and supplementary schools for 
technical instruction are classed under the head of elementary schools. — 
The subjects of study and the length of the course of study for special 
courses, supplementary courses, apprentices’ schools, and supplemen- 
tary schools for technical instruction, are arranged according to the 
orders of the minister of state for education. Certain subjects of study 
may be made optional in the elementary schools. In Fu and Ken reg- 
ulations governing the elementary schools of the jurisdiction are to be 
drawn up by the highest administrative officers according to the stand- 
-ard outlines prescribed by the minister. The course of study has varied 
somewhat from year to year, local circumstances governing the changes. 
After the establishment of a constitution and the general educational — 
revision, which took place in the various grades of education, an im- 
perial ordinance more clearly defined the courses in elementary schools. 
Instruction is given in the ordinary elementary schools in. morals, read- 
ing, composition, writing, arithmetic, and gymnastics, but, if local cir- 
cumstances require, gymnastics may be omitted and the history-and 
geography of Japan, drawing, singing, and handiwork, may be added. 
In the higher elementary schools the geography of foreign countries 
and science are added, and sewing for women. But here, as in the 
ordinary course, if local circumstances require, geography of foreign 
‘countries and singing may be omitted, and the elements of geometry, 
a foreign language, agriculture, commerce, and handiwork be added. 
Any person desiring to give similar instruction in a private school 
can do so by obtaining permission of the governing authorities of city © 
or town. 
The course of study in secondary schools was, by the education act of 
1872, to serve as a supplementary course to that of the elementary 
schools, but the subjects varied so in the different localities that new 
regulations had to be adopted. Commencing with a course varying be- 
tween two and six years the secondary schools were gradually changed to 
lower grade secondary and higher secondary schools. In 1886 an impe- 
rial ordinance was issued which defined the secondary school as an insti- 
tution “to prepare pupils either for practical occupations or for admission 
to the higher educational institutions.” The higher secondary schools, 
one of which is to be established in each of the five sections into which 
the country is divided, are under the direct control of the department

age, and | prove themselves acmpeteut to pursue the course.”

Applicants for admission to the higher secondary schools must have 
completed the lower grade secondary school course, be of good conduct EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
and health and upward of 17 years of age. The course of study covers 
two years, and a preparatory course extending over three years may 
be added. Medical departments have also been added to the five 
higher secondary schools, thecourse covering four years. This develop- 
ment plainly shows that the organization of secondary schools has become 
more complete and practical, and that they are an intermediate step to 
the university. The length of school term is forty weeks each year; 
_the general subjects of study include Japanese language and Chinese 
literature, English, French, or German, Latin, geography, history, 
mathematics, zodlogy, botany, geology, mineralogy, physics, chemistry, 
astronomy, political economy, philosophy, drawing, dynamics, survey- 
ing, and gymnastics. The standard to be obtained is such that the 
historical studies extend over the histories of Greece, Rome, Germany, 
France, England, and America; mathematics, through the first notions 
of plane and analytical geometry, elements of theory of equations, dif- 
ferential and integral calculus, dynamics through kinematics, dynamics 
of solids and fluids; gymnastics include military exercises; drawing is 
subdivided into the heads of descriptive geometry and mechanical 
drawing. - The medical course extends over four years and comprises 
the English language, zodlogy, botany, physics, chemistry, anatomy, 
history, physiology, materia medica, pathology, surgical pathology, 
medicine, surgery, ophthalmology, obstetrics, and gynzcology, medical 
jurisprudence, hygiene, and gymnastics. 
The course of study in the normal schools has been. so fully brought 
out under “training of teachers” that it will only be necessary to add 
the fact here that in 1886 an extensive revision was made in the regu- 
lations relating to the qualifications of pupils to be admitted to normal 
schools as well as those relating to their services after graduation. 
Military training was then first introduced with a view to producing 
the best possible teachers, and good results have followed. Itis stated, 
in 1890, that the supply of teachers is inadequate to the demand, and 
that the “number of pupils adequate to the needs of the country can 
not be trained in the normal schools, owing to the officially fixed num- 
ber of pupils and the limited length of the courses of study.” The 
-duties of nearly six-tenths of the teachers are performed by pupil 
teachers, and unless a scheme to establish teachers’ institutes for special 
training is carried out the same complaint will be heard in future. 
The education of girls has been somewhat neglected in Japan, yet 
as early as 1872 the Tokio Female School was organized by the depart- 
ment of education. Pupils between 8 and 15 years of age were admit- 
ted to it at that date, but since then the candidates for admission must 
have completed the elementary course and be between 14 and 17 years 
e age. Similar schools haye been established elsewhere during the 20 
_ years since those first efforts were made, but it is still stated that 
  x
-P-A-G-E-327
    's education has made but little progress as compared | 
of the boys. Again, it is difficult to give particulars in regard to 
~ vancement, as in some cities female schools are established as a pa 
i lower sane Reegndety: schools. In 1872 the subjects of study in     
        ing curriculum was established, which seems to still be the one on 
which the instruction in such schools is based:

EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
Asa fitting climax to the school system comes the university, with 
its four departments of law, science, medicine, and literature. It dates 
i from an institution of antiquity founded by the Tokugawa government 
and was remodeled after the restoration in 1868. Since that date its 
courses have been modified; in 1873 there were added special courses 
_of study in law, chemistry, engineering, polytechnics, and mining; in 
1876 it was united with the medical college; in 1885 the law school, 
which was under the control of the Department of Justice, was merged 
into the university, and the department of technology was formed with 
courses in mechanical and civil engineering, applied chemistry, naval 
architecture, and kindred sciences; in 1886, by means of an imperial 
ordinance, the university was reorganized as the Imperial University, 
its curriculum extending over three years in each course, except the 
four years’ course in medicine, and at the same time the school of in- 
dustrial technology was placed under control of the university. In 1890 
the college of agriculture and dendrology was united to the university, 
and on August 15, 1891, the curriculum of the law school was extended 
to four years. 
The Imperial University has as its object, “the teaching of such arts 
~ and sciences as are required for purposes of state and the prosecu- 
‘tion of original investigation in those arts and sciences. It consists 
- of the university hall and the colleges. The university hall is estab- 
lished for the purpose of orginal instruction and the colleges for theo- 
retical and practical instruction.” Candidates for admission to the 
colleges must have received certificates of graduation from a higher 
“secondary school or some institution with similar grade of instruction, 
or they must prove themselves possessed of equal attainments in the 
examination held befere each college. Persons desiring admission 
to the university hall are required “to present to the president of the 
university a written application containing the subjects of investiga- 
tion to be pursued by them.” The president appoints a professor or 
professors “to superintend the pupil’s studies, and all scientific inves- 
_ tigations carried on by the students must be made under such super- 
vision.” These investigations are not to be prolonged over two years. 
The course of study in the different faculties is very comprehensive. 
The law course has two divisions, that of law and political economy. 
In the first year of the law course the students have instruction in 
general and Roman laws, civil and criminal codes, in English laws of 
contract and torts, in general French law, the history of German law, 
and the law of pandects. In the second year, in the civil code, code 
ot criminal procedure, the constitution, public international law, exer- 
cises in civil and criminal pleadings, English commercial and property 
laws, practical exercises in the law of pandects, German private law. In 
the third year, instruction in the civil code covers the means by which 
property is acquired, claims, laws of evidence and of persons, admin- 
- istrative laws, exercises in civil and criminal pleadings. The study of.

THe EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM. OF JAPAN. 
  English law includes commercial law, law of procedure and of vie 
dence; the study of French law ineludes history, civil and administrative 
laws. The study of German law includes exercises from the pandects 
and German commercial law. The fourth year extends the studies to— 
the commercial code, judicial organization and code of civil procedure, 
private international law, jurisprudence, criminal code, history of legal — 
institutions of Japan, exercises in civil and criminal pleadings, Eng- 
lish law of equity, French civil and commercial laws, history of French 
law, German public and administrative laws, and German bankruptey 
law: The section of “ politics ” includes politics, political economy-and 
its history, statistics, history of institutions and of politics, English, 
French, and German constitutions, administrative, private and public 
international laws, civil, commercial, and criminal codes, sociology, his- 
tory of legal institutions in Japan, and laws of administrative justice. 
The college of medicine includes a course of medicine extending over ~ 
four years and a course in pharmacy extending over three years. The 
courses include, among other branches, pathology and medical history, 
surgery, physiology, hygiene, psychiatry, anatomy and histology, phar- 
macology, chemistry, gynecology, forensic medicine, and dermatology. 
While in the law school the average number of hours each week devoted 
to the different branches is three, in the medical school four appears to 
be the average. In the college of engineering there are nine courses, 
each extending over’three years. They are civil engineering, me- 
chanieal engineering, naval architecture, technology of arms, elec- - 
trical engineering, architecture, applied chemistry, technology of ex- 
plosives, mining, and metallurgy. The college of literature also has 
nine courses, extending through three years, including philosophy, 
Japanese literature, Chinese literature, Japanese history, history in 
general, comparative philology, English, German, and Freneh litera- 
ture. . Here, as in the other colleges or iupalties; there are professors who 
are graduates of European or American colleges, and the courses show 
evidence from the Japanese standpoint of the foreign influences at work 
throughout these islands. The college of science has seven courses ex- — 
tending over three years, viz, mathematics, astronomy, physics, geology, ; 
chemistry, zodlogy, and botany. The college of agriculture is awaiting 
‘additional development, but now has a three years’ course in agricul- 
ture, vegetable pathology, entomology and sericulture, zodtechny, 
political economy, chemistry, meteorology, forestry, and veterinary 
medicine. 
The university has elective and post-graduate courses, as also regu- ~ 
lar and subsidiary courses. Changes take place when the needs of the 
university require, or when new elements are brought in by those per- 
sons who have been prosecuting their studies in other countries and- 
have learned of the new developments in different branches of science. 
There are also scholarships founded by private munificence; one being 
in memory of Hotakéyama Yoshinari, one of the Japanese best known 
 
-P-A-G-E-332
— 800 © | EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91.   
    to Americans. These scholarships, founded by the zealous scholar who 
was so powerful an agent in the development of the university from an 
ancient-language school, are in law and chemistry. 
The Japanese have a large class of special schools, which are so di- 
verse in character that, although many of them naturally group here as 
a part of the school system, they have been classed for convenience’s 
sakeunder Supplementary Institutions and under Schools of other Depart- 
ments. 
SCHOOL MANAGEMENT AND METHODS OF DISCIPLINE. 
Methods and management.—The educational system is disciplinary 
in character, inasmuch as habits of obedience are to be inculeated from 
the earliest school years. Great stress is laid upon this point in the 
laws and in the imperial ordinances promulgated from time to time, 
yet no corporal punishment (such as whipping or binding with ropes or 
cords) is permitted in the schools. The methods employed in order to 
bring about the best results in the different grades of schools are not 
especially designated, but may be gleaned from the following: For the 
management of school affairs all wards or villages must organize 
school committees, who are to establish elementary schools for chil- 
dren between 6 and 14 years of age. The committees have general 
charge of the attendance and of the maintenance and establishment of 
the schools, and yet the parents and guardians are really reponsible for 
the attendance of their children. At the end of every year the school 
committees are to find out whether all such children have been in at- 
tendance, and, if not, what valid excuse there is for absence. The 
attendance must be of at least sixteen weeks each year, and the length 
of the school session not less than thirty-two weeks. Pupils of both ~ 
sexes are not to be taught together in the same room, except in ele- 
mentary schools. In the lower grade elementary schools not more than 
eighty children and in the higher elementary schools not more than 
sixty children may be taught by one teacher. School fees are charged 
or not, as the case may be, the local officials deciding this matter after 
due inyestigation of the circumstances. The teachers, who must 
_ be of good moral character and over 18 years of age, are with their 
schools, frequently subject to local inspection, and even to inspection 
by persons sent direct from the Department of Education. The re- 
sults of such inspection are sent to the department annually. As 
far as possible the teachers endeavor to make the instruction practical 
in character, and their zealous efforts to train the children under their 
charge are aided many times through the interest manifested by influ- 
ential people of the neighborhood, and many teachers have devised 
methods of their own, both for teaching and managing. School reg- 
istersare kept in many, if not all, elementary and secondary schools, and
-P-A-G-E-333

in the most populated Kens the inspectors give favorable reports of the 
manner in which entries are made in these registers.’ 
Promotion of pupils—The general trend of education and the adop- 
  tion of methods of European and American schools would indicate that — 
pupils are promoted from class to class after due examination, but this 
is not distinctly specified. The laws indicate, however, that parents. 
and guardians of pupils are permitted to attend any and all examina- 
tions held in the schools. : 
Study, recitations, and programmes.—The course of study in elementary 
schools is outlined by the governors of Fu and Ken, but planned by 
them according to the standard laid down by the minister in charge oi 
education. If any special modifications are required by local circum- 
stances, then the approval of the minister must first be sought. The 
text-books are chosen by the local authorities with great care, and the 
Department of Education assumes responsibility for them by examining 
them from time to time and informing the governors as to the result otf 
such examination. The Department also compiles and publishes text- 
books to serve as models for authors, and it indicates the general prin- 
ciples which should be incorporated in the books to be used for moral 
teachings. Divers and many Have been the regulations outlined as to 
text-books during the gradual growth of the school system, but the 
innumerable changes were found to be injurious tothe cause of educa- 
tion. In 1886-regulations for the examination and approval of school 
books and charts were formulated by the Department of Education, and 
publishers of text-books for elementary, secondary and normal schools 
requested the Department to examine those which they desired to pre- 
sent to the public. If satisfactory, certificates, good for a term of years, 
were given upon payment of a fee varying from 10 to 20 yen. All 
such measures were taken with a view to the encouraging of learned 
men to compile text-books, and well-qualified men were selected as a 
  
1JIn “Japan,” by J. J. Rein, the methods of teaching are thus described: “The 
school training of the Japanese boy begins on the sixth day of the sixth month ot 
the sixth year, on which he receives his first lesson in caligraphy with all the ob- 
servances of etiquette and solemnity which have always characterized the nation 
in such matters. Provided with the necessary materials, consisting of an ink box 
(sumi-ire or suzuri-bako) with a piece of ink (sumi), a brush (fudi) of the thickness 
of a little finger, an ink dish (suzuri), and usually also a little vessel for holding 
water, as well as some paper (kami), the new pupil is introduced to his teacher, who 
makes before him, on a large scale, the simple and more complex signs one after the 
other, and with unwearied patience and unvarying kindness shows him how to 
copy them. It is not often that the pupil displays any want of attention or earnest- 
ness. When he has made repeatedly the same sign, completely covered the paper 
with hieroglyphics, and thoroughly mastered one form he goes on to the second, and 
soon. Thus he gradually acquires, in addition to the easy native syllabic writing, 
a stock of Chinese word-signs. On the lowest calculation, he must master in six or 
eight years about a thousand. Quicker pupils under competent teachers learn as 
many as three or four thousand, and scholars as many as ten thousand and even 
more.”

   committee on compilation. In 1887 these regulations were revised so 
that text-books in elementary schools may be selected or changed by a 
committee, whose powers are given them by the local governor; the 
books not to be published by themselves or their relatives, or by mem- 
bers of the school board. Text-books for lower grade normal schools are 
to be selected by the instructors, subject to approval of the Minister of 
State for Education. 
SCHOOL ORGANIZATION. 
Buildings and Grounds.—The same general principle holds good in 
regard to the school buildings as in regard to schools. Where Euro- 
pean customs prevail there isa tendency toward following European 
models in the style and arrangement of school buildings for the differ- 
ent grades. In country districts, for private schools, and for schools 
remote from centers of civilization, the Japanese style of architecture, 
with its one or two story buildings situated in large grounds, may he 
said to prevail. The higher class schools, being more or less affected 
by foreign influences on account of the foreign instructors engaged 
therein, follow in the main the customs of those peoples who bave from 
time to time been drawn to Japan by commercial or other reasons. 
“The ordinary school building is mansion-like in extent, and its pupils 
go to and fro dressed in Japanese costume, while in the university and 
higher grade schools European costumes are often seen. The size of 
rooms varies here as elsewhere, but the general furnishings show the 
desks and chairs found in other countries, and the methods of teaching 
are frequently the same as in the Western Continent. In this connec- 
tion one special feature is noticeable—that is, the Japanese usually pre- 
fer the natural color of the woods in their school furniture and in the 
general furnishings of buildings. Varnished and painted furniture are 
found in the schools where foreign instruction prevails, but not- so 
in the Japanese schools. According to imperial decrees, all elementary 
schools are to be provided with buildings, school sites, school ap- 
pliances, and buildings for gymnastics; and where agriculture is 
taught there are lands to be provided for practical training. The pro- 
visions for such buildings, sites, ete., are prescribed by the Fu Chiji or 
Ken Chiji, in accordance with regulations issued by the minister of 
education. As regards the grounds surrounding the buildings, the 
following statementtis clearly of interest: As early as 1874 the Jap- 
anese Government granted lands as school sites and exempted such 
Jands from taxation. At that date not more than 1,000 tsubo were 
granted for secondary schools and not more than 500 tsubo for elementary 
schools. In 1880 this amount had been increased to 500 tsubo for pub- 
lic elementary schools and 1,000 tsubo for public secondary and special 
schools, and in 1881 similar governmental provision was made for 
agricultural, commercial, and industrial schools. In the Hokkaidé (or 
northern provinces, which have a special administrative board govern-
-P-A-G-E-335
    THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM OF JAPAN, 808 
ing them) forests, plains, seacoasts, and other lands have been granted _ 
to the amount of 500,000 tsubo for each school, so as to provide ample 
resources for the maintenance of schools and for encouraging indus- 
trial pursuits. 
Hours of school.—In elementary schools the number of school hours 
is not to be less than three nor more than six hours each day; asa gen- — 
eral rule, five hours’ daily instruction is given, but the number is ar- — 
ranged by the minister of education. ‘The length of the school session ~ 
is not to be less than thirty-two weeks in each year. The length of 
recesses between studies is not designated in the various hee 
emanating from the central authorities. 
Holidays and vacations.—These are not especially designated, but 
according to an imperial ordinance of 1886, the year in which a general 
revision of school affairs took place, the elementary schools were to be 
closed each year for about eight weeks, also on Sundays, national holi- 
days, and festival days. Elementary schools may also be closed on 
Saturday afternoons: According to imperial ordinance of 1890 -holi- 
days in elementary schools must not exceed ninety days per annum, 
exclusive of Sundays, but this does not apply to apprentices’ schools, 
supplementary schools for technical instruction, and supplementary 
courses. The vacations in the university comprise two weeks at Christ- 
mas, the first week in April, and two months’summer vacation. Lectures 
are also suspended on Sundays and on the holidays of September 22, 
October 17, November 23, January 30, February 11, and March 20, 
Compulsory attendance.—The department of education has, by means _ 
of regulations for compulsory attendance, so directed the local authori- 
ties (Chiji of Fu or Ken) that they fully comprehend the class of rules 
necessary to render instruction obligatory. For elementary schools 
the course required is between three and eight years, with no less than 
thirty-two weeks’ school session annually. The parents are obliged to 
have their children (betaveen 6 and 14 years of age) attend school dur- 
ing such a period, unless they may have some contagious disease, may 
neither have been vaccinated nor had the smallpox. Under such 
_ conditions the parents and local committees, acting in concert, may 
make other arrangements for the education of such children. 
School supply.—Charts, blackboards, the abacus, apparatus required — 
for_special studies, the best text-books (translations or otherwise), all 
are considered prerequisites to education. The schoolbooks and charts 
are selected by a committee for the examination of schoolbooks and~ 
charts. They are subject to the approval of the Fu Chiji or Ken 
Chiji, and must be chosen from among those approved by the minister 
_of education. The regulations governing school organizations have 
been in years past subject to the revision which has followed all other 
sections of education, but the tendencies here, as well as elsewhere, are . 
toward gradual improvement and the adeption of the best plans found 
in other countries,

7 SUPPLEMENTARY INSTITUTIONS. 
Libraries and Museums, which greatly facilitate educational work, are 
found in various divisions of the the Empire. No public library, as such, 
had been established before 1868, but many books had been collected 
for the use of pupils in the schools established by the Tokugawa Gov- 
ernment and by the various Han (territories of feudallords). The rev- 
olution, which did away with the rule of the Shdgunate and brought 
Japan again under the Mikados, was also the means of bringing these 
books together in one common center in Tokio, where they were placed 
in the library of the university and in the Tokio library. 
The latter, established in 1872, is the only one to allow free access 
to the public. This library had, together with other educational 
institutions, to suffer material changes from year to year, but, in 1890, 
its shelves held 18,739 Japanese and Chinese books, and 17,455 Euro- 
pean books, to which the public had free access. The library has also 
about 156,902 books which are not placed before the public. The num- 
ber of visitors was 36,113; the number of books read 247,328. The 
library of the Imperial University contains 14,357 Japanese and Chi- 
nese works, and 54,387 European books, many of which were transferred 
from the Engineering College. An average of 70 people visited the 
university library each day. Under the controlof Fus and Kens are also 
8 public libraries and 10 private ones, with a total of 74,440 books. 
About 36,341 of these books are found in the local libraries of Tokio. 
In all these libraries there is a noticeable lack of catalogues, so that the 
public often fails to realize the value of the books on account of impos- 
sibility of access to them. 
The Tokio Hducational Museum, which was at first called the Office of 
Productions, takes the first rank among museums. A local museum 
at Shimane is considered the next best museum on a small scale. In 
1880 the Tokio Museum authorities set aside a special room for educa- 
tors who desired to make a study of the various articles exhibited, so 
that they might write upon the subject; in 1881 a catalogue was pub- 
- lished; in 1884 learned men gave lectures to teachers of Tokio and the 
neighboring Ken, using the articles in the museum to illustrate such 
lectures; in 1885 the museum contained 4,815 articles for educational 
purposes, 8,485 zodlogical specimens, together with 908 articles ar- 
ranged in a special room. The visitors in that year were 112,900, and 
the expenditure for that and the Tokio library was 35,131 yen. 
Societies.—Educational societies were organized in most of the Fus 
and Kens in 1876 and 1877, and, about 1880, many private educational 
societies were founded. Many of these societies are designed to pro- 
mote education in the jurisdictions of the Fu and Ken wherein estab- 
lished, and some of them contain over a thousand members. The 
Tokio Educational Society of 700 members is composed of directors 
and teachers of public and private elementary schools, or persons 
 
-P-A-G-E-337
: otherwise interested i in education. if miatape to its ordinary fans 
tions it has held competitive educational exhibitions, established inst 
tutes for training elementary school or kindergarten teachers, and in - 
other ways aided in educational progress. 
Among the most flourishing societies is the private Educational 
Society of Japan, which has 3,733 members and has established four — 
branch societies in different parts of the country. Since its establish- — 
ment its members have been sent to various districts to deliver ad- 
~ dresses and lectures and to awaken discussions on educational subjects. 
Tt publishes a monthly educational magazine and has published edue 
tional books, and conferred educational medals on those persons whom — 
the members desired to reward for meritorious work or to encourage 
continuance of some special work undertaken. Its library consisted of - 
36,000 Japanese and Chinese books in 1890. Before proceeding to _ 
enumerate a few of the 700 societies with their 100,000 members, it may 
be well to state that the Tokio Private Educational sonia held an inter- 
esting exhibition throughout an eighteen days’ ‘period which was in itself 
an education. The exhibition contained drawings of the sites and 
buildings of all elementary schools of Tokio, exhibits by pupils and 
teachers. In the collections were 314 articles which received honorable 
mengion. Other Kens followed Tokio’s example, the private educational 
societies taking the lead each time. The exhibit at Sogo had over 
5,000 articles, and received 391 awards. In addition to these societies 
aa. exhibits for the advancement of education there were published, 
between 1873 and 1884, department bulletins containing accounts of - 
educational progress in Japan and other countries. In the year 1884 
the Department of Education ceased to publish such bulletins, but 
_ since 1879 private individuals and local school officers have carried on 
a similar work. 
The following are the principal societies which serve as ingeenenneny 
ties of thought: Dai-Nippon-Kidiku-Kwai (Educational Society of 
Japan); Tdkié-Fu-Kidiku-Dan-Kwai (Tokio-Fu Educational Society); 
Chiba-Ken-Kidiku-Kwai (Chiba-Ken Educational Society); Saitama- 
Ken-Shiritsu-Kidiku-Kwai (Saitama- Ken. Private Educational Society); 
Niigata-Ken-Kidiku-Gikwai (Niigata- -Ken Educational Society), * 
The object of these societies is the improvement of education and of 
the methods of instruction’in the respective localities. 
Then follow the Djishin-Gaku-Kwai (Seismological Society) which 
investigates the phenomena of earthquakes and volcanoes; Senkd- 
Gakusha (Society of Specialities), to study and inquire into various 
special branches of science; Butsuri-Gakkwai (Society of Physics), 
which has in view the exclusive study of the higher course of physics; 
TOkid-Sangaku-Kwaisha (Tokio Mathematical Society), which discusses 
the theory of higher mathematics and translates and compiles works: 
on mathematics; Tdkid-Futsubun-Kwai (Tokio French Language 
' Society). This society is composed of scholars, both Japanese and

    ee foreign, who are familiar with the French language, and. who meet to 
promote study in the sciences and arts, and to encourage the study of the 
french language by the interchange of knowledge among the members. 5 
Then there are the Tdkié-Seibutsu-Gakkwai (T6kié Biological So- = 
ciety), for the study of biology in general; Rigaku-Kidkwai (Society of 
Physics), composed of professional students who meet for the purpose 
of inquiring into the principles of physics and of interchanging knowl- 
edge among the members; Nippon-Kédékwai (Japanese Society of 
Moral Science), which interprets the principles of moral science; But- 
surigaku-Yakujikwai (Society for establishing a regular terminology 
for physics); Doitsugaku-Kidkwai (German Language Society), whose 
object is to study in the German language laws, politics, and other 
sciences; Tetsugaku-Kwai, Philosophical Society, in which the philos- 
ophy of Europe and Asia is studied; Hé-gaku-Kiokwai (Society for

In 1879 the Department of Education organized the Tokio Academy, — 
_ which had as object the grouping together of learned men to discuss 
_ subjects relating to arts and sciences especially as they appertain to 
educational matters, or to the advancement of civilization generally. 
The membership was limited to fifty, afterwards to forty. The approval 
of the Minister of Education was required before any person could ~ 
become a member. At the close of 1890 125 meetings had been held 
and the twelfth volume of their magazine had been published. 
Special classes.—The earliest education of the blind and deaf and~ 
dumb consisted in merely teaching the former acupuncture, shampoo- 
- ing, and music, and the latter some manual occupations, the effort being 
to help the defective classes so that they could earn a livelihood. The 
Kioto Blind and Dumb Institute was first established by private indi- 
viduals in Kioto in 1828; in 1879 it was transferred to the authorities _ 
of the Fu. The course of study extended over five years, but an addi- _ 
tional year, called the preparatory course for special branches, was 
added for the purpose of helping the pupils to gain knowledge of some 
industrial pursuit. In 1884 the course of study was divided into gen- 
eral and special, the former extending over six years, the latter over 
five years. In the general course the blind studied “the three Rs,” 
_ geography, history, object teaching, morals, natural history, training 
_ of the senses of touch, smell, and hearing, physics, sewing, gymnastics, 
and singing; in the special course they had instruction in music and ~ 
acupuneture. The deaf and dumb had in their general course morals, 
articulation, “the three Rs,” geography, history, drawing; object teach- 
ing, natural history, physics, sewing, and gymnasties; special course, — 
drawing (Japanese and foreign), writing, cutting, forging, making gold — 
lacquered pictures, joinery with Chinese wood and with Japanese wood, 
sewing, embroidery, and thread work. Thete is not always strict 
adherence to the course, and supplementary subjects may be allowed in 
both of these courses if it is thought advisable. Candidates for admis- 
sion to-the institute must be between 6 and 30 years of age, although 
that limit is sometimes extended to 40 years. 
Pupils who are not natives of Kioto pay a tuition fee of 30 sen 
(about 30 cents) each month. Poor people have loans granted them 
and are also allowed privileges as regards the difficult courses. 
Another institute, the Osaka Model Blind and Dumb Institute, had a 
similar course, both in length and subjects. The Philanthropic Society 
of Tokio founded an institute for the blind in 1880, which also admitted 
the deaf and dumb. In 1886 this institute came under the control of 
the department of education, and its course was arranged according 
to the following plan: There were two sections—the ordinary and me- 
chanical. The blind were taught the Japanese language, arithmetic,

   : conversation, and Sune in the foun, ct and shampooing Wee 
the latter. The deaf and dumb had (in the ordinary section) articula- ~ 
tion, reading, writing, composition, arithmetic, written conver sation, 
and gymnastics; in the mechanical section drawing, fitting and cutting, ‘ 
‘and. sewing. The age of admission is between 8 and 18 years. Tuition 
fees were 50 yen (about 50 cents) a month, which were remitted in case 
_ of poverty. In 1890 there were 12 teachers in the Tokio Institute, 18 
‘male and 5 female blind pupils, 33 male and 15 female dumb pupils. 
There were 6,764.858 yen expended for new buildings and 3,068.047 yen 
_ for other purposes. 
_ An interesting description of the attitude of the Japanese towards 
the blind was read before the Asiatic Society of Japan by Prof. Dixon. 
A résumé of this paper is here presented, as it indicates the thorough- 
hess of the training given to that class: 
‘The blind, in the earlier period of Japanese history, were considered uncanny 
and unlucky, and they were miserably taken care of until a blind imperial prince 
‘was born. The Mikado gathered other blind people around the prince for his 
_ amusement, and later, when the prince became goyernor of three provinces, he 
selected blind men for his aids in governing those territorial possessions. For three 
centuries these provinces were ruled by the blind. The practice of shaving the 
heads of the blind is traced to the reign of this prince. In the twelfth and thir- 
teenth centuries the blind were again sent forth into their former miisery. But the 
wheel of fortune brought about a revulsion of feeling towards this class, and local 
authorities were ordered to provide for the blind of their districts and to give them 
~ suitable education. The blind followed two occupations—music and chantizig and 
shampooing or massage—those who were experts in musical matters ranking well 
amongst the people, the less expert becoming musical story-tellers. Most towns 
and villages have their shampooers, who promenade at nightfall uttering a call 
indicative of their profession. To become a good shampoocer requires nine years’ 
practice. The first three years the would-be shampooer practices on his master; 
then gives three years to acupuncture; then there were three years’ probation, the 
master receiving half the earnings. 
The higher grades of offices were at one timeopen to theblind. Persons 
holding such positions were provided with special insignia of their office. 
Among the blind who have made their mark in the Japanese Empire is 
to be found a famous author, who compiled a valuable work of informa- 
tion in 635 volumes. In other fields of usefulness the blind are some- 
times found; but as shampooers and musicians they seem best known. 
Miscellaneous and special schools—Additional to the regular schools 
‘embraced in the school system of Japan there is a large class of so- 
ealled miscellaneous and special schools, many of which have courses 
of study of a quite elementary character, while others have, as their 
names will indicate, special courses in different lines. Many of these 
schools are under the control of the various departments. In the law 
of education of 1872 all higher schools taught by foreign teachers were 
designated as special schools. In 1873, the Tokio foreign language 
school was established and French courses were introduced, and Ger- 
man, Russian, and Chinese languages were taken up in turn. Eight 
- schools were soon thereafter established as a development from this 
 
-P-A-G-E-341
     school, but these - were ‘eventually abolished, and. the @aritan, Baad 
(1885), and English (1879) sections of the Tokio school became a part 
of the preparatory department of Tokio university. In 1880 a Corea 
section was added to the Tokio foreign language school, as intercourse 
with that country became greater through the treaties of that date: _ 
The increased extent of commercial affairs plainly indicated to the 
Japanese nation the necessity of establishing commercial schools, 
and at the present time the Tokio commercial school has absorbed the 
remaining foreign language schools, Classed under special schools are — 
local, commercial, medical, pharmaceutical, and agricultural schools; 
4. @., 1 medical, 1 commercial, and 1 drawing school in the Fu of Kioto; 
1. medical; 1 agricultural, and 1 commercial school in the Fu of Osaka; 
1 medical and 1 commercial school in the Ken of Aichi; 1 agricultural 
  and 1 commercial school in the Ken of Yamaguchi; 1 veterinary and 1 ae 
commercial schoolin the Ken of Nagasaki; 1 commercial school each: 
in the Hokkaidé and in the Ken of Kanagawa, Hyogo, and Shiga; 1 
agricultural school each in the Ken of Niigata, Miyagi, Ishikawa, Tot- 
tori, and Kochi; and 1 veterinary school each in the Ken of Iwate and 
Ehime. In the Fuof Kioto there are 28 special schools giving instruc 
tion in law, medicine, engineering, political economy, philosophy, — 
mathematics, surveying, and drawing; and in the Ken of Aomori, 1 
school of literature, and in the Ken of Miye 1 nautical school. : 
The Tokio commercial school (commercial schools date from 1875) 
was formed by the union of the commercial and foreign language 
schools of Tokio, and was placed under the department of education 
in 1885. A year later an apprentices’ institute and a special institute a 
~ for banking were established in connection with the Tokio school, and 
the regulations indicated that the Tokio commercial school was “to — 
prepare persons for the management of either public or private com-— 
mercial affairs, or as managers of, or instructors in commercial schools.” 
The course of instruction is twofold, an ordinary course of three years — 
and a higher one of two years. Candidates for admission must be over = 
16 years of age and pass an examination in designated branches. 
Post graduate and elective courses are allowed. The apprentices’ 
institute is designed to teach “such literary and manual work as ii 
_ necessary for apprentices and artisans, or the children of the same.” e 
Thé courses are two, industrial and special, later called preparatory 
and principal. For admission to the first the children must be over 12 cod 
years of age; to the special course over 14 years; and must be able to — 
pass an entrance examination. The banking or accountants’ course — 
_aims to give such knowledge “as is deemed necessary for the transac. 
tion of financial business in Government departments, banks, compa- 
nies, etc.” The course of study extends over two years, and candidates 
for admission must be between 17 and 30 years of age, and be able to 
pass the requisite examination. =

   in 1886.. There are also a fow RS technical schools, but their 
standard is not high enough to class them among special schools. The 
Tokio Fine Art School, established as a branch ot the Engineering Art 
School in 1876, and reorganized in 1887, has not as yet developed to any 
great extent. The Tokio Music School dates trom 1884, and includes in 
_ its four-year course of study morals, singing, theory and history ot music, 
methods of instruction, use of various musical instruments. A specjal 
school i in the Keu of Ishikawa has a four years’ course, two of them be- 
ing preparatory years to the courses in either lav, science, or literature. 
Five private schools in Tokio are under the supervision of the president 
_ of the Imperial University, who exercises such prerogative through a 
“committee selected from among the officers of the college of law as in- 
spectors ot schools either during the ordinary course of work or at ex- 
- aminations.” 
The miscellaneous schools are those whose regulations and courses of 
_ study do not correspond to either elementary, secondary, or special 
schools. They include 814 schools for the study of Japanese and Chinese 
literature, 139 for the English language, 134 for handiwork, 120 writing 
- schools, and 89 for mathematical study. Included under this head is 
the gymnastic institution, established in 1878, and attached to the 
Tokio Normal School in 1885. Its special object is to train teachers in 
military and ordinary gymnastics. Then there is the German language 
school, established in 1883 by the German Language Association. Its 
. five years’ course includes German, English, and Latin languages, Jap- 
anese and Chinese literature, natural history, physics, history, geog- 
raphy, chemistry, and mathematics, ethics, drawing, and gymnastics. 
Politics and law are also taught in a three years’ course. The number 
of these schools is 1,440. The greatest increase ot late years is in the 
English language schools. German language schools and those for 
mathematics rank next. The schools for instruction in writing are de- 
creasing in number. j 
SCHOOLS UNDER CONTROL OF OTHER DEPARTMENTS, 
_ The greater proportion of the schools which have been referred to 
throughout this statement are those which were under the control of 
the Department of Education, but this essay would be incomplete 
without a description of such as have been established by, or are under 
_ the special supervision of, other government departments. The first 
- mentioned, the Gakushiu-in, established in 1875, was placed under the 
_ special control of the Department of the Imperial Household in 1884, 
The school was originally intended for the exclusive purpose of educa- 
ting the nobility, but other classes are now admitted according to cir- 
cumstances. The course of study is of six years preparatory, five years 
- lower grade secondary course. two years higher secondary course, and   
-P-A-G-E-343
     ' three years in a general course. A female school for the education of = 
daughters of the nobility, which until 1885 was a part of the Gakushiu-in, — ; 
_ is now under the patronage of the Empress. The elementary and — 
secondary courses extend over six years each, and instruction is given — 
in such sciences and arts as are appropriate. 
Under control of the Military Department is the Military College, Z 
established in 1882, for the training of infantry, cavalry, artillery, and 
engineer officers, i are selected on account of talents and distin- 
guished literary attainments. The course of study is of three years, 
and includes tactics, artillery practice, engineering, field fortification, 
horsemanship, military topography, topographical drawing, military 
geography, staff service, military administration and legislation, mathe- 
matics, drawing, foreign languages, literature, etc. The students ad- 
mitted are lieutenants and sublieutenants of infantry and cavalry of | 
not less than two years’ service, and the same rank of artillery and — 
engineer officers of not less than one year’s service. The military 
academy is designed “to give instruction in such sciences and arts 
as are necessary to prepare students as officers of thearmy.” The sub- 
jects of study are tactics, artillery, engineering, history, geography, 
drawing, mathematics, physical and chemical science, foreign languages, 
and Chinese literature. The military cadet course covers three years; 
inilitary students of infantry, and cavalry, three years; for artillery and 
engineering five years, with a provision that students of artillery and — 
engineering, “are to be appointed sublieutenants after two years? 
study, and allowed to continue their study in the academy with the~ 
rank of student sublieutenants.” Nearly five thousand students have 
been admitted since 1870 and 1,652 have graduated. The Toyama Mili- 
tary School, founded in 1873, aims to train instructors, from among the 
commissioned and noncommissioned infantry officers, to investigate — 
the condition of foreign military methods; to make practical .experi- 
ments in manual drill, maneuvers, and other military arts; and to 
investigate the physical and normal condition of officers and privates. 
The Military School of Gunnery, which in a four months’ term instructs 
in the handling and firing of artillery, was first established in 1886. 
The Military Department has had since 1871 a “corps of instruction” — 
under its control for the training of persons desiring to be commissioned 
and: noncommissioned officers of the army. The candidates must be © 
between 18 and 25 years of age, of sound constitution, of a specified 
height, and must pass an entrance examination, and, if trumpeters, must 
haye regular teeth. Over 15,000 students have been admitted to this 
corps and nearly 10,000 have graduated. ‘ 
The Department of the Marine controls the Naval Academy, with its 
four years’ course in naval tactics, navigation, torpedoes, ordnance 
exercises, and general subjects. Candidates for admission must be 
between 15 and 20 years of age, of sound constitution, and ‘able to 
pass an entrance examination in punctuation and in composition in 
    
Pee
-P-A-G-E-344
   e Chinese language, arithmetic and algebra, English and Japanese — 
translations, English dictation, grammar, and conversation. The 
- Naval Engineering College, separated from the Naval Academy in 1881, _ 
_ trains engineer officers [called cadet engineers in the United States], — 
and also trains in the higher branches of the science. ~The limit of age 
for candidates is 16 to 20; the course one of five years. Then there are 
_ the Naval Medical College and the Naval Paymaster’s school, the titles 
easily indicating the class of instruction given. The five years’ course 
of study for physicians and surgeons include zoélogy, botany, practical 
chemistry and histology, materia medica, pathology, obstetrics, surgery, 
opthalmology, diseases of women, hygiene, medical jurisprudence, sur- 
gical practice, physics, anatomy, physiology, health and sanitation in 
camp life. The paymasters’ course is of three years in Japanese and 
Chinese literature, mathematics, political economy, bookkeeping, and 
law. Candidates for admission must be between 18 and 20 eas of 
age. 
The Department of Justice has connected with it a law school dating 
from 1876. Those desiring admission must pass the examination in 
Chinese classics and history. The course of study, which extends from 
two to four years, includes French and Japanese laws and laws of the 
- moot court. i 
The Department of Agriculture and Commerce controls the Tokio Ag- 
ricultural and Forestry College, which, in a modified form, dates from 
1874. It was first a school of agriculture; then in 1882 a school for the 
_ Special science of forestry was established. In 1886 these were abol- 
ished and the present college was founded. A general preparatory 
course, three years, leads up to either of the three sections, 4. ¢., agri- 
culture, forestry, and veterinary science. The sectional courses are 
from two to three years, or even shorter duration, according to cireum- 
stances. In order to enter the preparatory.course, students must be 
between 16 and 24 years of age, and must pass an examination in arith- 
metic, algebra, geometry, Japanese geography and laws, English or 
German language, composition, and chemistry. The higher courses re- 
quire similar attainments and the age to be between 18 and 25 years. 
The Department of Communications has control of the school of teleg- 
_raphy and the Tokio Nautical School. Telegraphists have one year’s” 
course for adult pupils between15 and 25 years, and two years for juve- 
niles between 13 and 15 years of age. This school dates from 1873, but a 
branch school was established at Osaka in 1882. Entrance examina- 
tions are required in English, French, Japanese, and Chinese literature; 
the subjects taught are telegraphy, English, French, mathematics, and 
electricity. The nautical school is designed to train for the merchantma- 
- rine and naval reserves. It dates from 1875 and was organized as a Goy- 
ernment school in 1882 with a course of five years in navigation and 
engineering. Candidates for the course in navigation are required to _ 
_ be between 14 and 154 years of age; for the engineering course between

   Sapporo Agricultural College. The school dates from 1872, and in 
present form has courses in theoretical and practical agriculture, and in 
civil engineering. A preparatory course of four years requires the 
candidate for admission to be over 13 years of age and to pass | 
f examination in the elements of the English language, Chinese litera 
ture, and arithmetic. For permission to become students of the special 
course, the candidates must be above 17 years and have passed through — 
the preparatory course, or have passed an examination in the English 
language, English and Japanese translations, Chinese literature, geo; 
raphy, history, natural history, physical geography, physiology, el 
ments of chemistry, and mathematics. Post-graduate courses, fro} 
one to three years, are allowed to students at expense of the school, 
if they possess unusual attainments. There is also a two years’ course S 
in practical agriculture with a model farm attached.      
    
   
    
      
   
   
       
    
   
       
    
      
       
   
       
    
     
       
       PRESENT CONDITION AND FUTURE POSSIBILITIES. 
At the commencement of this essay reference was made to the proba- 
ble changes which would arise from the establishment of the new con- 
stitution. According to the views of several writers who seem cogni- 
zant of educational and other affairs, the future of education in Japan 
is not painted in the most glowing colors. The newly established Par- 
liament is endeavoring to institute economies, and among other thing: 
public instruction loses at least one-half of the $800,000 fund pro 
posed by the Government. Five years ago (about 1887) five higher 
schools for secondagy instruction were created in different places 
throughout the Empire by Viscount Mori. These schools were to bi 
the beginning of future universities. Of these training academies th 
one at Sendai, a city of 70,000 inhabitants north of Tokio, commenced 
its class work in 1889, Hit the buildings were not completed nor did 
the formal dedication take place until the latter part of 1891. Great 
- preparations for this event were made. Teachers of the surrounding 
country, the higher officials of the department of education (the Mom 
pushé, as it is called), and prominent citizens took park in the cerem 
nies, which were preceded by the conferring of diplomas on graduates 
of the medical department. The decrease in the budget tends to di 
away with these institutions; the reformers object to so much state 
control of education; students refuse to be taught by foreigners, and a 
general conservative movement in education is noticeable. Among the 
tendencies manifest of late years are these: “The rising generation is — 
growing up without those habits of instinctive obedience and reverence 
which characterized the previous civilization ;” “The question of how to 
preserve sound morality and discipline in the schools is causing grave 
_ concern at headquarters, 4. ¢., among the prominent officials who have 
 
-P-A-G-E-346
dea is to iikine the wittle pocge ‘of tae aoe ety amor- 
ality should be cultivated, as that is the basis of all education.” The 
demand for foreign teachers grows less and less from year to year, as 
students prefer the J: apanese, who more thoroughly understand their — 
customs and who are of more assistance to them in making translations 
and other literary work. 
_ The present status of affairs, with the tendencies toward still further 
evision of education, may be gleaned from the following statement of 
axresident of Japan: : 
The ranks of the foreign instructors in the Imperial University have been seriously 
thinned, and their places are being filled by young graduates of promise, and the 
= has included even the representatives of German science, which has of late 
been inthe highest favor. Parliament has-questioned the policy of educating stu- 
dents abroad at the expense of the State, and it is likely that the number of these 
students will be gradually reduced. The-students who are taught here in foreign 
dangnages are not found to be so ardent as in former days in the acquisition of the 
foreign tongue, and the task of conveying such instruction has become correspond- 
ingly difficult. In the matter of laws, too, the postponement by Parliament of the 
_ operation of the Commercial Code until 1893 is significant. Itis a close. adaptation of 
__ the German code, and its repugnance to the customs of the country is one of the strong 
points with its opponents. Parliament is very anxious, too, to know whether it is 
necessary to maintain so many foreign advisers and superintendents inthe Govern- 
ment departments, and the ministry is placed always in an attitude of defense and 
planation, nottosay apology. In religion,! too, the reactionary movement isstrong. 
- In contradistinction to these statements made by persons resident in 
fapan, it may be said that the Japanese have long followed the pro- 
gressive movements of European and American countries, and that 
they have endeavored in every way to develop instruction. The ex- 
bits made at the different international exhibitions have shown a 
high standard of excellence, and even the publications by the Japanese 
_of work done in the English, French, and German languages were re- 
_ markably correct. A cursory glanceat their educational journals shows 
that many modern movements are under discussion, and that the retro- 
grade movements are directly counterbalanced by other efforts toward 
en higher advancement. In all matters appertaining to the educa- 
nm of children the efforts have been most noticeable. The Japanese 
teacher, who must be of a high moral character himself, acts as asort of 
guardian for those under his guidance, and ifthe pi act badly out- 
ide of the school room the teacher is considered at fault. 
A foreigner writing for the Journal of the Japanese Educational 
Society (described under Supplementary Institutions) suggests to the 
Japanese people the establishing of vacation colonies for poor children, 
‘such as are so successfully carried out in Germany, Spain, Switzerland, 
and elsewhere. 
  
By the new constitution absolute freedom of religious belief and practice is se- 
cured, so long as it is not prejudicial to peace and order, There is no State religion 
and no State support. ~ 3 : 
 
-P-A-G-E-347
Still another number of the Journal discusses the movements of a 
woman’s educational society, which, numbering 120 members in 1887, 
has as its object the promoting of woman’s education. The society had 
already displayed its interest in the subjects of hygiene, équal rights — 
of men and women, and it, with other organizations, was manifestly 
developing all movements which tend toward the higher education of 
woman. < 
The training of women in J apan has now become a noticeable feature. 
In the Ken of Nagana a school has been established for the purpose of 
training women “to take charge of and amuse young children while 
- their mothers are at work.” In 1891 there were 74 pupils. Arrange- 
ments have also been made to “‘employ women in the Imperial Post. 
and Telegraph Offices” and “to place them on an equal footing with 
other employés.” The ‘women who are taking the lead in these moye- 
ments are the Samurai class—i. e., those who belong to military circles.” 
They are endeavoring “to establish upon a broader and surer founda- 
tion the position of women in their own country.” They are “eagerly — 
working into the positions of teachers, interpreters, trained nurses, and 
other places which naturally open to women.” 
The propriety of having preparatory commercial and technical in- ~ 
struction in elementary grades, so that the pupils might be better 
fitted to enter the regular technical schools, was discussed in 1890, — 
In 1892, in discussing the possible establishment of apprentice schools, — 
the needs of localities were to be taken into consideration. In some dis- — 
tricts spinners are needed, in others stonemasons, in other localities - 
still other industries were most needed. 
A new development in the scientific line, the Harris School of Sei- 
ence, which was regularly opened on April 7, 1891, is observed in con- 
nection with the Doshisha Preparatory, Collegiate, Theological, Scien- 
tific, and Politico-Law schools at Kioto. The gift of Mr. J. N. Harris, — 
of New London, who gave $100,000 for such purpose, its aim is to “offera 
post-graduate course to such students of the collegiate department as _ 
may desire to pursue advanced studies in science and its application 
to the arts.” 
The Doshisha school was founded in 1875; girls’ school added in — 
1877. The preparatory has a two years’ course; the collegiate, four 
years. The collegiate division has (1) a literary, historical, and political _ 
course; (2) ascientificand mathematical course. Thenthereisaregular — 
theological course and a school of political science and law. Theinten- _ 
tion is to develop this school into a university under Christian influ-- 
ences. : : 
While the growth of. education has been truly marvelous in this far- 
off eastern empire, especially during the last twenty-five years, yet 
may it be said that the characteristic effort “to combine in one system 
the board schools of England, the high schools of America, the normal 
schools of France, and the universities of Germany” has naturally 
 
-P-A-G-E-348
made the task a difficult one, and the i histery of the department of 
education shows constant countermarching by which the goal has been 
brought nearer and nearer.”! “Boards and departments and offices were 
created and’: abolished; codes were formulated and repealed; individuals 
were appointed and Gisinseed?? But with all “‘the Japanese educational 
system exhibits two out of the three great principles of national in- 
_ Struction: it is compulsory and secular, but not gratuitous,” Notwith- 
anding that education is compulsory, in the country districts the 
mpler elementary course is a comparatively short one, because the 
country people are poor and unable to pay for longer terms. “The 
weak point in the maintenance of such elementary and middle schools, 
besides the changes to which they have been subjected, is that they 
-are subject to the success of the crops, as the amount of local taxa- 
tion must be dependent, among a poor agricultural people, upon their 
_ yearly prosperity.” Great hopes are based upon the normal schools, 
as the Japanese realize thoroughly the need of well-trained teachers 
‘for the lower grade schools. They say truly that it is “a broadening 
of the base of education that Japan needs most; among a people so 
intelligent and so ambitious there will never be any lack of polishing 
at the apex;” hence the life in the university, with its students “engaged — 
_ in independent investigation of abstruse questions in medicine, chem- 
istry, and physics,” will make its impress felt by degrees in Japan and. 
elsewhere, as its students continue to spend years of study in other 
countries and bring back such elements of Western civilization as are. 
- most needed to carry out the ideas of the statesmen of Japan. 
The spirit of Japanese education was thus summed up by His Excel- 
lency Count Mori just prior to his assassination. It forms a fitting ~ 
_ _ termination to this essay on the educational system. He says: 
_ Itis our aim to inculcate and develop three qualities in our people: obedience, 
sympathy, and dignity 2—obedience, because only throngh obedience come regu- 
larity and serenity of life. Our people are irregular at present, and the influence of 
our rebellion ten years ago has been widespread in making them so; therefore obe- 
_ dience ranks first among the qualities they need. Sympathy we must inculcate, 
Decause it is the crowning virtue of civilization and the indispensable basis of the 
democracy which we, like other nations, hope to become.. Ourpeople have emerged ~ 
__ too recently from feudalism to pos8ess sympathy in any great degree, and without 
sympathy the best man is but asavage. Finally, dignity is thé handle of all the 
blades of character. The Japanese are an impulsive people, and now that they are 
about to meet the outside world on equal terms for the first time the value of dignity 
can not be overestimated. These three, again, are the characteristics of an ideal 
army, invariable obedience, perfect sympathy of high with low and low with high, 
equal dignity in victory and in defeat. To aid in their development, therefore, we 
have established military drill in our schools. 
- Such is the self-imposed task of the Japanese in their efforts to edu- 
cate the nation, and the results are especially noteworthy, for this 
people has adopted the best developments of the Western Hemisphere,

a Be Manis an eclectic system. Foreign influences are felt in refle 
action, but it is said that ‘in five years’ time there will hardly be'a 
position’ involving high chadie oy scientific knowledge filled by a for 
experts, the birysieincs and surgeons, the assayers and masters of the | 
mint—all will be graduates of the Tokei Daigakko, or Imperial Univer 
sity.” This is a clear picture of the Japan of the period. - The diseu: 
sions in regard to a narrowing of the educational budget, the changes 
involved in the establishment of a new constitution will all cause cei 
tain modifications of the present status, but the natural tendencies 
the Japanese people signify onward movements in every line where ‘the 
nation’s weal is taken into consideration, and the future will bring sti 
other developments as marked in their way as have been those of the 
past.

CHAPTER X. 
EDUCATION TN ITALY. 
  By Prof. ALEXANDER OLDRINI, 
Member of the Geographic Society of Italy; of the Society for. Elementary Instruction in Paris; of 
rs the Ethnographic Society of France, ete. : 
The object of this essay is to indicate the tendency of modern Italy 
toward high special studies. But before exhibiting, by analytical — 
tables, the standing of the Italian nation in those intellectualdepartinents 
in which she has already attained a prominent position, it seems advisable — : 
to give an introductory statement as to the condition of her primary, 
secondary, and industrial schools, according to the most recent statistics. 
This essay includes a statistical review of the following subjects: — 
I. Illiteracy: Causes, percentages. 
Il. Kindergirten and their development. 
III. Popular Primary Education: Schools, whether yall nigtits & 
Sunday, military, industrial, normal; their progress since the enact- _ 
ment of the law for compulsory eesti (1877). : 
IV. Secondary: Inferior and superior “ginnasi” and “licei;” tech- — 
nical scheols and technical institutes; naval, agricultural, industrial, — 
and normal schools; reform of secondary instruction. < 
Y. Superior and Special Instruction: Universities; their programmes 
and their pending reform; superior institutes, superior special —— “ 
academies, and special academic institutes. 
VI. Fine Arts: Academies, institutes, eS antiquities, ond 3 
national monuments. : 
VII. Libraries: Governmental, university, provincial, municipal, oe : 
VIII. Press: Newspapers; magazines; books. 
IX. Budget of public instruction. 
X. Scholastic, general, provincial, and municipal administration, 
L—ILLITERAOY. 
The following figures, representing the degree of illiteracy of the 
Italian people, notwithstanding the law for compulsory education 
(1877), show that, in order to wipe out illiteracy,from her soil, Italy has 
still to contend with serious problems.

' A generation ago 78 per cent of the Italian population could not read 
_, or write. Since then education has reduced illiteracy to 50 per cent of 
the whole population, 42 per cent of persons from 12 to 20 years ofage, and 
28.08 per cent of those contracting marriage. Yet this gain is not con- 
sidered sufficient by those who insist that intelligence and education 
are indispensable attributes of national pride, popular prosperity, and 
human civilization. 
As the ignorant man in the struggle for existence has no chance 
_ moral energy and condemns her to be the victim and the slave of those 
who possess greater intellectual force. This has been felt in Italy by 
_ all patriotic citizens, and education, therefore, has been a subject of 
legislation ever since the unification of the country was completed in 
_ Rome twenty years ago. The evil was, however, too deeply rogted to 
be cured within one generation. The main causes of this deplorable 
_ Bstate of public education in Italy, as it‘was revealed by the first cen- 
_ gus (1861), must be sought in the following historical facts: 
First, the foreign invasions, which for so many centuries not only 
subjugated, but kept the country divided against itself and denational- 
ized even its literature and instruction. 
_ Second, in the religious superstition which for a long time domi- — 
_ nated the masses—a consideration that finds its unmistakable proof in 
  against his learned competitor, so popular illiteracy robs a nation of
-P-A-G-E-353

the proportional average number of illiterates existing (in 1872) in 
Piedmont, where foreign domination never existed, viz, 15 per cent, 
and that of Basilicate, Abruzzi, the southern province of Calabria, and 
Sicily rescued in 1860 from Bourbon Jesuitic rule 90 per cent. It has 
also been reported, as characteristic of religious influence, that the 
only spot in Italy where illiteracy did not exist was in the Alpine dis- 
tricts inhabited by the Waldenses, the only Protestant Italian popula- 
tion. 
Ifthe flame of Italian genius has not been extinguished by such 
influences, while popular culture disappeared, it is because of the ex- 
traordinary resisting power of the Latin race, which even in the darkest 
days of its history, between the thirteenth and nineteenth centuries, 
gave to the world such representatives as Dante Alighieri, Christopher 
Columbus, Nicolo Machiavelli, Giordano Bruno, Michelangelo Buon- 
arotti, Raffaele Sanzio, Galileo Galilei, Leonardo da Vinci, Amerigo 
Vespucci, ete. And in more recent times, Galvani, Volta, Beccaria, 
Torricelli Spalanzani, Rossini, and others; poets, thinkers, navigators, 
scientists, and artists, whose immortal works and teachings brought 
Italy to a third life and illumined the paths‘of humanity. 
II.— KINDERGARTEN. 
The kindergiirten (asili infantili), which were few in number thirty 
years ago, were after the first census (1861) gradually brought to a 
successful development, as is shown by the doubling of their number 
between 1871 (1,099, with 130,806 infants) and 1888~91 (2,218, with 
256,423 infants). The department of education also manifested interest 
in their special pedagogic and scientific aims: 
First, by the introduction of Froebellian lectures on hygiene, pediatry, 
and the best methods of practical infant instruction, these lectures to 
be delivered in the principal centers of population by licensed female 
teachers and physicians. 
Second, by annexing the kindergarten to the royal normalschools as 
far as the regular inspection, uniform and systematic organization, and 
the pedagogic preparation of female teachers were concerned (1890). 
Third, by national exhibitions of hygiene and methods of infantile 
instruction (Milan, 1891).

III.--POPULAR, PRIMARY EDUCATION, 
Primary instruction is now imparted in all the communes of Italy 
(8,253 on the Ist of January, 1892). 
It was first made compulsory in 1859, but the law could. not be 
enforced at that time on account ofthe political agitation during the 
* period of the wars of independence. A new law was enacted in 1877, 
covering more ground than the former, the enforcement of which has 
been of marked effect in the general development of popular culture, 
as is shown in the length of the school term (9 months between 6 and 
10 years of age); in the number of pupils; in the attendance and efii- 
ciency of teachers, which has kept pace with the general improvement 
by means of pedagogic lectures an annual conventions. 
The spirit of national and popular education is greatly aroused by 
the parliamentary debates that have recently taken place on the sub- 
ject, and the subsequent augmentation of the budget of public instruc- 
tion by the central as well as by the provincial and municipal adminis- 
trations. The discussions included the creation of a pension fund for 
the benefit of elementary teachers, and they extended to the benefits 
which would accrue from the subsidies granted by the Government to 
communes for the erection of school buildings. 
. The number of pupils, which in 1871 amounted to 1,722,947, has now 
increased to 2,326,392 in public elementary day schools only; but 
including night, Sunday, normal, and military schools, a total of 
3,306,266 is obtained for the whole population of Italy. This includes 
army elementary schools, which are peculiar to the country, the useful- 
ness of which is demonstrated by special statistics. As a result of 
their organization the illiteracy, which on 100 recruits of both army 
and navy, averaged formerly 52.78 per cent, had decreased in 1871 to 
an average of 6.52 per cent, so that 93 per cent were sent home after 
their military.term of service able to read and write. When, owing 
to reasons of public economy, the regulation was repealed which pro- 
vided that no recruit could get his discharge unless he could read and 
write, the percentage of those who had been in school was reduced. 
Finally, of the annual contingent of 365,026 recruits, 80.48 per cent 
are fully able to read and write at the time of their discharge from 
military service. By law all sergeants leaving the army may receive, 
if desired, the diploma of an elementary teacher, thus greatly contrib- 
uting to the increase of the staff for primary popular education. 
In the elementary and industrial schools and institutes for deaf, 
dumb, and blind of Milan, Palermo, Rome, and Turin, as well as all 
the elementary and industrial schools of prisons, penitentiaries, and 
houses of correction of Italy, the increase of illiteracy is still larger, as 
shown by special statistics. (Of 388 illiterates in reformatories,371 were 
able to read and write at the end of the year.) In the roll of primary 
instruction there are also about 50 schools opened in foreign countries,
-P-A-G-E-355
  EDUCATION IN ITALY. 323 
namely, in the Levant and certain parts of South America, where Ital- 
ians remain as residents and not as citizens. The Italian Government 
reserves the right to inspect and to enforce a curriculum of study; con- 
tributing in its budget and annual subsidy of one-half million lire. 
The programme of studies for elementary schoolsis as follows: Rights 
and duties of citizenship, reading, handwriting, rudiments of the — 
Italian language, and history, arithmetic, metric system, gymnastics. 
Manual training will be added at an early date to the programme 
in order to prepare those pupils for common industrial life who do not 
pursue the higher courses of studies. 
The criticism is made, both in and out of Parliament, that the ele- 
mentary school of Italy is not sufficiently educational to form the char- 
acter of the pupil, so that he will be fitted to perform whatever duties 
are assigned him by his compatriots; that too much of his time is taken 
up by the arid processes of mental exercises to the detriment of the 
moral aims of education. To that criticism, Hon. E. Villari, ex-minis- 
ter of public instruction, and one of the most learned and progressive 
Italians in pedagogical science, answered that the educational char- 
acter of the’people’s schools could not be expected to be perfected by 
means of programmes only, so long as the general progress of the people 
is slow; that progress must come from every direction in order to 
give the people’s school a higher educational character. 
But it is an acknowledged fact to-day that in modern Italy elemen- 
tary instruction, which only could raise the standard of popular educa- 
tion among the masses, has been from the beginning unwisely sacrificed 
to secondary instruction. This has been clearly stated by Hon. 
Gallo in his exhaustive report to the Chamber of Deputies this year. 
He says: ‘We went too far when we admitted that secondary instruc- 
tion could have, as a means of educating the people, the same efficacy 
as primary education. Italy always needed, and needs yet, a school, 
complementary to the elementary one, where the minds of the pupils 
will be formed especially for the ainis of life and the defense of national 
rights. It is the Government’s duty to organize a democratic school 
answering to the needs of the majority of the people, who can not con- 
tinue their education in the schools for secondary instruction.” Thus 
it seems that the curriculum of primary instruction in Italy has been 
freely discussed and the suggestion of the complementary school is ad- 
mitted as a necessary basis of an early reform.

IV.—SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
Secondary instruction is given in the following classes of schools: 
(a) Classical: Ginnasi (inferior and superior); licei. 
(b) Technical schools and technical institutes. 
(ec) Nautical, industrial, agricultural, commercial, and normal schools. 
The inereased number of technical schools and institutes, and of 
“ginnasi” and “licei,” as well as the increase of pupils, viz, from 43,798 
in 1871, to 85,629 in 1890, is considered as a great advance in secondary 
instruction in Italy. But whether the people derive greater usefulness 
from classical or technical training is now a particular subject of dis- 
cussion, the result of which is expected to be in favor of technical in- 
struction. It may be stated as an opinion that while all the Italian min- 
isters of public instruction have understood their mission and demon- 
strated a desire to fulfill it to the best of their ability with the means 
put at their disposal, very few of them have emancipated themselves 
from the Italian preference for classical studies ‘for the majority of 
the people,” a tendency which is not in harmony with the modern idea 
of fitting the greatest number for the pursuit of agriculture, commerce, 
industry, and finance—a field where “arithmetic is the first theoretical 
study necessary for the mastery over the material world.” The evil 
of fostering classic instruction among the Italian people is proven, 
first, by the ratio of the number of pupils frequenting “ginnasi” and 
 
-P-A-G-E-357
  EDUCATION IN ITALY. 325 
‘“Jicei” (63,860) to those of technical schools and institutes (21,036), the 
only secondary instruction preparing pupils for early practical life; 
second, by the fuct that out of the 50,132 pupils of the “ ginnasi” 
13,728 only enter the “ licei,” the balance, viz, 36,404, entering the field 
of life with a preparation of classical studies, when a technical and a 
professional one would be more to the purpose. The consequence of 
this is that when the students are brought in contact with the people 
of other nations, and especially with the Anglo-Saxon, they are fre- 
quently found to be deficient in the practical methods that lead to suc- 
cess. So that while the “ginnasi” though crowded with pupils, do not 
contribute much to the hgiher and special studies, since the greater 
number of them (68 per cent) stop at the door of the “licei,” agriculture, 
commerce, industry, and steam power are not attended to as they 
should be for the increase of national prosperity. 
Hon. E. Villari, ex-minister of public instruction, in his analysis of 
the Italian system of public instruction before the Chamber of Deputies, 
May, 1891, and in response to the general attack against classical edu- 
cation, closed the debate with the following sentences, characteristic of 
an Italian mind: 
Industrial schools are necessary for the toiler in order that he may be trained to 
the study of the material world, of which he is a part. But ifthe people prefer to 
crowd the “ ginnasi,” it is because they naturally follow the instincts and traditions 
of their country. Therefore, it is our duty to raise a generation educated to live in 
the world of thought. The sciences, and mathematics particularly, however useful 
they may be in subjugating natural forces to the use of man educate only unilater- 
ally. They do not prepare human intelligence for those problems, the objectiveness 
of which is thought, while literature and words, holding all that a nation has felt 
and suffered, direct the pupil toward a world of thought, thus forming that intelli- 
gent class which has a high mission in modern times when the working class is on 
the increase and tending to become one of the most potent forces of human society. 
Then, refusing to consider a plan for the general reform of the Italian 
educational system, which he declared could only be done by slow and 
continuous movement, the minister proposed what he thought necessary 
and advisable to adopt in the transformation of technical instruction, 
namely, the division of existing technical schools into thres branches: 
First, a school of superior elementary instruction; second, a school 
for commerce and industry; third, a theoretical scientific school for 
those who wish to enter technical institutes. The first of such new 
schools to be accessible both to men and women in order to give them 
an equal chance to complete their elementary instruction for the educa- 
tion of the family and the wants of ordinary life. The second, the 
industrial, he declared urgent, because the “ wealthiest and most pow- 
erful nation is the one that creates the most skilled laborer.” The third, 
the theoretical, to fully prepare for the applications of science.

= MALE AND FEMALE NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
There is one special superior normal school at Pisa, and there are 134 
normal schools in Italy for males and females, distributed in as many 
cities. Their object is to prepare teachers for primary elementary in- 
struction. : 
The position of professor in secondary instruction (technical schools 
and institutes) is subject to competition among those who can exhibit 
a diploma of one of the Italian universities, or of a school, institute, 
or academy for special superior study. This subject will be properly 
treated under special and superior instruction; but it may be stated 
that of the total number of the 134 normal schools for both sexes, 26 
rank as “inferior” and 108 as “superior;” 36 are for men and 98 for 
women. According to that proportion, the total number of pupils 1s 
divided as follows: Men, 1,414; women, 9,646; making a total for 1890 
of 11,060 to 6,130 in 1871, with 1,392 teachers. The progress of normal 
instruction in Italy may be noted from the above statement. 
The fact that women normal pupils amount to about 80 per cent of the 
total finds its explanation in the unequal treatment of the women 
     
-P-A-G-E-360
    328 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91, 
under the old system of public education in Italy. Women have equal 
access to elementary, day, and Sunday schools. When they wish to 
perfect their elementary education, the normal school is the only insti- 
tution to which they can apply for that purpose. The result is that 
while the normal schools offer to many girl pupils the desired occasion 
to complete their elementary education, the importance and normal 
character of the school itself becomes lowered. 
In the special parliamentary debates, it was assumed that the only 
official schools for female normal education were the two special normal 
institutes or ‘“‘magisteria” for women in Florence and Rome, and the 
nine special superior female educational institutes (educatorii) of Flor- 
ence, Milan, Naples, Palermo, Montagnana, and Verona. Of the 98 
regular normal schools in the most populous towns throughout Ttaly 
many fill to-day the place of the much-needed complementary school 
of elementary education. They answer more the purpose of general 
female culture than that of normal training, for which they were 
created. 
Under such favorable circumstances the culture of Italian women, 
as noted in the attendance at the normal schools, has progressed 
everywhere. The pedagogic direction of the kintergiirten, of the Sun- 
day schools, as well as of the inferior classes of the elementary schools 
is now entrusted to female teachers with satisfactory results. Quite 
lately a group of the most distinguished and well educated women, well 
known in literature, have undertaken, by means of lectures and the 
press, to secure such a law as will afford women the same treatment 
as is accorded to male pupils. Public opinion in Italy is favorably dis- 
posed to the idea. ‘That a sister in a household,” according to a recent 
plea for coeducation, ‘should be educated as their brother is educated; 
that the mother should have the power, by reason of her own serious 
thought on literature, history, art, and the varied ennobling instrumen- 
talities of life, to guide and train the thought power of herchildren; that 
the wife should be on an intellectual plane with her husband, ever 
stimulating and inspiring him by thinking and never giving him oppor- 
tunity to depreciate, or to seem to depreciate, her mental capacity in com- 
parison with his own.”

V.—SUPERIOR AND SPECIAL STUDIES. 
Persistence in the adoption of that class of studies called superior 
and special indicates intellectual power in a nation and its inclination 
toward solving those problems which are of benefit to mankind. It 
also shows what are the characteristic qualities. of nations and the 
degree of influence they exercise in the progress of human thought. 
The tendency of a nation toward the highest education, whether in 
literature, philosophy, or science, can only be measured by Icoking into 
her historical tradition, that sacred treasure handed down from one 
generation of thinkers to another, for every generation adds the products 
of its own studies and experience to the national intellectual treasure. 
Owing to traditional Roman culture Italy could, in the medieval 
period of the glorious republics of Genoa, Venice, Amalfi, and Florence, 
open a new civilization, while many nations had scarcely emerged from 
barbarism. During the “Rinascimento” she gave to the world philoso- 
phers, astronomers, navigators, artists, historians, etc., of immortal fame. 
The spirit that animated the celebrated school of Salerno, the classic 
“Studio of Bologna,” and all her traditional schools of art and science, 
which seemed to be lost during three centuries of national disorganiza- 
tion, are now revived; and the revival is evinced by the elevated pro- 
gramme of studies adopted for the Italian universities and academies, 
also by the large number of athenzeums and superior special schools which 
have been inaugurated in the principal cities during this generation. 
They represent the tradition of the Latin race for high and special 
culture, and explain at the same time the tendency of modern Italy in 
that direction. The programme of study of the Italian universities and 
superior institutes is to-day as high as that of any other European uni- 
versity, and in several branches, such as legal jurisprudence and moral 
and economic social sciences, Italy holds a prominent place. It is her 
glory to have adopted, within the generation following her national res- 
urrection, a code in which capital punishment finds no place and 
where criminality is treated on the scientific basis of pathological sociol- 
ogy. This new conquest of the human mind, connected with biology, 
anthropology, physiology, and psychology, has in Italy specialists of 
international reputation, such as Prof. Lombroso and others well 
known. Sociology is already taught in ten universities and several 
autonomous Italian academies,  
-P-A-G-E-362

AGRICULTURE. 
Agricultural instruction is now being imparted in Italy as follows: 
In higher elementary schools; in normal schools for males; in ambula- 
tory schools for elementary teachers; and more particularly in 135 in- 
stitutions founded since 1870, showing the progress made by the coun- 
try in one generation, viz: 
One superior normal school (Pisa); 2 special scientific superior schools 
(Milan, Portici); 6 academies of agriculture (Turin, Milan, Florence 
(Georgofili), Fermo, Lecce, and Pesaro); 1 forestry institute (Vallom- 
brosa); 14 agrarian stations; 1 institute for the advancement of agricul- 
ture (Naples); 10 special normal schools; 25 farming schools (alaw of 1887 
ordering the foundation of such schoolsin each of the sixty-nine provinces 
of Italy); 75 technical institutes (sections of agriculture and surveying). 
At the present day skilled agriculture is recognized in various coun- 
tries as an element tending to national prosperity. 
This has been felt by the Italian nation, and undoubted signs of a 
revival are already noticeable throughout the country. 
The Italian Guvernment, having opened thirteen deposits of agri- 
cultural implements for free public use in 1870 (increased to forty-eight 
in 1890), the importation from England, Germany, the United States, 
and France of a great amount of machinery was a natural consequence; 
and furthermore, international exhibitions having served as a prece- 
dent, national and local agricultural conventions and exhibitions were 
annually organized in the most productive districts. Scientific agri- 
culture as taught in the special industrial schools and superiorinstitutes 
is already productive of national results, in machinery and implements, 
with a constant tendency to increase, and is expected in time to replace 
importations. 
There are in Italy (1890) about 2,000,000 hectares of uncultivated 
land good for agricultural purposes, besides the special immense moun- 
tain tracts reserved for the pasture of cattle and.sheep, and 353,709 
hectares (ex-Neapolitan feudal and ademprivi Sardinian lands) destined 
for agriculture and colonization.

  The scholastic year is nine months and a half. 
For admission to the first year and to any faculty the “diploma of the licei” is 
required. The diploma of technical institutes (section physico- mathematical) admits 
only to the physico-mathematical faculty. 
Foreigners wishing admission to Italian universities must produce a document 
stating that the applicants have accomplished such studies as would entitle them 
to admission in a Bee: of their own country. Or they must submit to special 
examinations. 
Examinations of Italian universities for graduation are both written and oral. 
A special commission of university professors constitutes the board of examiners. 
They are appointed by the rector as follows: For diploma of special sciences, com- 
mission of 3 members, 20 minutes. For “laurea” of a faculty, commission of 11 
members, 40 minutes. The examinations are public. 
Chairs.—The chairs of ordinary professorships in the universities and superior 
special institutes of Italy are granted only by titles or examinations. Examinations 
are in Latin forthe two chairs of Greek and Latin literature only. The special com- 
mission of examiners (5) is appointed by the minister, directly, on the advice of the 
superior council of public instruction. 
The examinations are public as well as the votes of the examiners, The commis- 
sion draws up areport, which, whether favorable or not to the candidate, is pub- 
lished in extenso in the Gazzetta Ufficiale of Italy. 
For places of free public professorship in universities and superior and special in- 
stitutes and schools the examinations are made by a commission composed of a num- 
ber of ordinary professors of the university, or superior special institute, and an 
equal number of outside professors.   
   
   
   
UNIVERSITY REFORMS, 
During the last few years disturbing influences have been manifest 
in several universities, among them Turin and Naples. 
The condition has been extensively discussed by the educational and 
political press and in parliament. The conclusion has been reached 
that aradical reform of the Italian universities is necessary, to bring 
them into accord with the most recent requirements of philosophy and 
science. : 
The claims of the would-be reformers are substantially as follows: 
First, the university is to be made independent of either Government

or province, as were the ancient studios of Bologna and Pavia and the 
celebrated school of Salerno. Second, free matriculation, viz, the fac- 
ulty to grant permission to everyone to be admitted on examination 
even without having followed the official Gourse of studies. Third, par- 
ticipation of students in the election of the rector, which would put an 
end to allmisunderstanding between students and professors. Fourth, 
liberty of study, viz, the faculty to allow the students to follow as many 
courses as they may desire and the regulation to be abolished which 
obliged them to follow a given number in order to obtain the laurea, 
Fifth, liberty of teaching by the suppression of all distinction between 
ordinary, extraordinary, substitute and free professors. Sixth, abolition 
of the thesis for obtaining the laurea. Seventh, the participation of 
the superior special institutes in the regulations which correspond to 
those of the university faculties. Eighth, the right granted to women 
(who are admitted in Italy to all universities and superior special in- 
stitutes) to practice in all liberal professions, which right is now reserved 
for men only. Ninth, the participation of Italians in the seeking of 
foreign diplomas and nee and vice versa. 
Hon. E. Villari, ex-minister of public instruction since 1890,! submitted 
the above- penned claims to the supreme council of public instruc- 
tion of Italy for consideration. It is expected that the long-sought 
reform in the organization of Italian faculties will soon become a fact. 
At the meeting of the university congress held in Palermo on the 
22d of April, 1891, the following resolution, embodying the main princi- 
ple of the reform, was voted upon: 
  Resolved, That the juridical person ality be granted to the university as the most 
potent means towards obtaining didactic and disciplinary autonomy, state interfer- 
ence to be forbidden except as regards financial control within the limits of the legal 
donation. 
ACADEMIES, ATHEN ALUMS, SUPERIOR INSTITUTES. 
For the study of science, philosophy, literature, fine arts, social 
sciences, agriculture, and mathematical sciences there are 59 academies 
and higher institutes. These include, among others, the Royal Acad- 
emy. of Sciences in Bologna, the Sicilian Society for the Study of Na- 
tional History in Palermo, the Dante Alighieri Society for the Diffusion 
of the Italian Language in Rome, the literary academies of Bossano, 
Bergamo, Brescia, and Venice, the school for electrical study in Milan, 
the Italian scientific and geographic societies of Rome, the school for 
stone carving at Parma, the national and royal associations in Naples, 
the medical and scientific societies of Turin, the royal academy, “ dei 
Lincei,” in Rome, and others too numerous to mention.

  IX.—THE BUDGET OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION. 
The budget for the education of the Italian nation (about $18,500,000) 
is an object of criticism when compared to that of army and navy 
(about $86,000,000). The abnormal disproportion finds its explanation. 
in the situation of Europe; also in the constant efforts of the Italian 
cabinets and chambers, since the war of independence, to solve the 
problem of national defense before any other. 
However, the total budget of instruction, which was in 1872 about 
$9,000,000, reached in 1890 the sum of about $18,500,000, and there is a 
manifest tendency towards further increase. This is shown by the ap- 
propriations granted for school buildings, in addition to the annual 
amount for maintenance; or to teachers, pupils, and families in the form 
of subsidies and for sclolarships in the normal and superior institutes 
and for the pursuit of special studies abroad, ete. Also in the form of 
premiums to all kinds of scientific, literary, and philosophic publica- 
tions; to competitors among the graduates from secondary institutions 
and to philanthropic individuals who foster with their own means the 
development of elementary and normal culture among the people. 
Elementary teachers whose salary has received a small increase have 
been benefited by the establishment of a pension fund, amounting in 
1890 to 34,615,403 lire or $6,681,372.

  CHAPTER XI. 
EDUCATION IN KOREA, 
By Mr. Pom K. Sonu, 
Formerly member of the special embassy of Korea to the United Stata. 
In the northeastern part of Asia, located east of China and west of 
Japan, in latitude 30° to 40° north, longitude 125° to 130° east, lies the 
peninsula of Korea, This country, known in history under many names, 
is most familiar to the Western world as Korea. It really dropped this 
name when the dynasty of Koriu ceased to exist, about 500 years ago. 
Since that time it has been known to tlfe Oriental world as “ Ta-Jo-Son” 
(Great Morning Calm), which is the name of the reigning dynasty. 
This little country, about the size of the State of Minnesota, is similar 
to Florida in shape, and resembles California in physical features. It 
is bounded on the east by the Japan Sea and on the west by the Yellow 
Sea. Its northern boundary is the Ap-Nok River, which separates it 
from China, and the Tuman River, which separates it from Russia, to- 
gether with a small portion of rocky country, its only conneetion with 
the main land. Well protected on all sidés by water, it has sturdily 
resisted all foreign invasion and has justly earned for itself the soubri- 
quet of the “ Hermit Nation.” 
Ranges of mountains, well covered with pine and a great variety of 
hard wood, traverse the country from north to south. Itis watered by 
many navigable rivers, which furnish communication between nearly 
all parts of the country. The most important of these are the Han 
and the Ta-dong. 
Kang-won-do, a province of the eastern coast, possesses many re- 
markable physical features. The most wonderful of these is the Gum- 
kang-san, or Diamond Mountain, famous not only in Korea, but through- 
out the entire Chinese Empire. Entirely bare of vegetation, its sharp; 
angular surfaces, reflecting the light, present the most brilliant and 
changing colors. Under favorable conditions a remarkable mirage is 
’ often seen from the top of this mountain. Hundreds of human figures, 
sometimes on horseback, sometimes with waving flags and banners, are 
reflected against the clear sky, and even whole cities have been sharply 
outlined. So far no explanation has been given of this phonomenon, 
A giant’s causeway, far exceeding in beauty the one on the coast of

Treland, is found here. It is composed of numerous groups of pillars, 
rising 40 feet and upward into the air, each group consisting of hun- 
dreds of pillars of glistening whiteness. 
The country is rich in gold, iron, coal, and other minerals. More 
than one-half of the vast mines which are known to exist are gold 
mines. Only two or three, however, are opened, and the gold dust, 
which is an important article of commerce, is washed out of the 
streams. Iron is also found in large quantities, and since the country 
has been opened to foreigners coal has been mined.and is gradually 
being used as fuel. 
The climate corresponds to that of the Middle Atlantic States. The 
soil is fertile, and abundantly supplies grain and pasturage with little 
trouble to the people. Most of the fruits and vegetables grown in the 
United States are common to Korea, besides many not known to 
America. The fruits are abundant and of excellent flavor, though 
small, The tuberous vegetables grow to an enormous size. 
_ The cattle are of excellent breed, being large, strong, and quite equal 
to those raised on the prairies of America. They are peculiar in having 
a very quick gait. It is estimated that if the cattle were equally 
divided among the people there would be one for each adult. The na- 
tive horses are strong, but small, and are used only for riding. The 
waters abound in fish of great variety. Whales, which have been 
driven from other seas, make their home in the seas around Korea, 
_where they live undisturbed, the people of that country not knowing 
their value. 
The principal occupation of these people is agriculture, but many 
skilled mechanics find employment, and the arts and sciences, although 
not so flourishing as in former centuries, are still cultivated. The women 
are employed in embroidery, weaving, dressmaking, and the silk in- 
dustry. 3 
Many years ago the Government employed large numbers of female 
assistants in hospital and other charitable institutions, but this practice 
has now fallen into disuse. 
The southern part of Korea has always been its most flourishing sec- 
tion, and to-day the industries of the country are most, prosperous in 
the provinces of the old Sin-la dynasty. 
Although Korea has held herself aloof from the rest of the world, she 
has instituted manufactures and maintained them from her own re- 
sources. Most of the Japanese works of art so prized at present 
are the result of Korean skill; During many centuries the Japanese 
have been taking from Korea vast quantities of fine manufactured. 
goods and works of art, which they have imitated and claimed as their 
own. Silk, cotton, linen, and grass fabrics, embroidery, paper, mat- 
tings, brass, iron, lacquered and bamboo wares, as well as shoes, hats, 
cotton wadding, and furniture, are among the manufactures which have 
been carried on for thousands of years by this “Hermit Nation.”
-P-A-G-E-375
  EDUCATION IN KOREA. 343 
In 1883 three seaports were opened to foreign commerce. -At that 
“time these ports, which to-day are bustling with commerce, were a mere _ 
wilderness. Since intercourse was established with other countries 
the imports and exports are about $5,000,000 annually. Grain valued 
at $2,500,000, together with great quantities of hides and gold dust, are 
among the exports. The commerce is yearly increasing. ; 
The Koreans are among the oldest people of the world. They have 
a written history dating back 3,000 years, but their origin is shrouded 
in doubt. In the year 1122 B, ©. the viscount Ki-ja emigrated from 
China to Korea with 5,000 men, both skilled artisans and men versed 
in literature and science. Several hundred years later a small portion of 
the northern part of the country was invaded by the Chinese, possibly 
leaying in Korea a few hundred soldiers. Again, during the reign ot 
the Emperor who built the great wall of China, about 200 years B. C., 
another emigration of learned Chinese occurred. The Chinese some 
centuries afterward conquered two of the kingdoms in the central part 
of the country, and three hundred years ago, during a war with Japan, 
Korea asked assistance from China, when, doubtless, more Chinese 
soldiers were left in Korea. 
It may.readily be seen that in about 3,000 years there have been sey- 
eral times when the Chinese and Korean races may have mixed. Con- 
sidering the small number of Chinese and the long periods which elapsed 
between these immigrations there is little reason for supposing that the 
original Korean type has been materially changed by this commingling 
with the Chinese. 
No record exists of an early immigration from Japan, but during the 
many wars waged between these two nationsit is probable that many Jap- 
anese soldiers remained in Korea. In fact, the Japanese records men- 
tion that during the last war, which continued eight years, many sol- 
diers deserted from the army. These men, for their protection both 
from their own army as well as from the natives, assumed the Korean 
dress and manners, and lost their identity as Japanese. 
Both from the history of the western nations and from Korean his- 
tory, it is learned that Arabians settled in this country and exported 
from it to Bagdad and Damascus ginseng, aloes, camphor, cinnamon, 
ginger, deer horn, nails, saddles, porcelain, and satin. 
There are circumstances tending to establish the belief that the 
inhabitants of certain portions of Korea may haye had a Caucasian 
origin. 
Both men and women were tall and well-formed, and in personal appearance and 
manners more likely to command the respect of foreigners than either the Japanese 
or Chinese in their original conditions. Their faces were broad and features large, 
with finely shaped heads. The stolid, impassive expression of the Chinese, or the 
sly, crafty appearance so commonly observed in Japan and China, was rarely notice- 
able among the Koreans.. We thought them frank and honest in expression, pleasing 
though timid. Their complexion was of a redder tint than that of the Japanese or - 
Chinese. The hair varied in color from black to light reddish-brown.—(Extract

from a small volume issued by the Navy Department written by Mr. Foulk, naval 
attaché of the United States legation, afterwards chargé d'affaires.) : 
The Kingdom of Korea, having an area of 92,000 square miles and a 
population of 28,000,000, is divided into eighty do or states, with gov- 
ernors appointed by the King. These do are subdivided into 360 parts 
under second-class governors, and again divided into smaller parts under 
petty officers. Besides these divisions there are four military districts 
under governors-general and about forty military posts, situated on the 
sea coast, governed by military generals. 
There are about two hundred fortified towns belonging to the differ- 
ent do, and hundreds of postal districts under the jurisdiction of the 
postmasters attending only to the Government mail. 
The capital city is Séoul, with a population of about 250,000. It is 
governed by a mayor appointed by the King. : 
GOVERNMENT. 
The Government is an absolute monarchy. It has written laws, but 
no constitution, and each executive department (state, war, ete.) has 
rules approved by the King and Parliament. This form of government 
Las existed since 1394 A. D. and in a modified degree singe the fourth 
century B.C. It has three branches, legislative, executive, and judicial. 
The legislative power is in the hands of the King. Three prime min- 
isters and an indefinite number of senators are always in session. They 
make laws with the consent of the King, and can demand a hearing, 
whenever they consider it necessary to amend any law. These three 
ministers form the highest court, and among other matters have the 
oversight of the private conduct of the King. 
A body of 1,000 noblemen, both civil and military, of nine ranks, 
forming an upper and lower house, meet in session when any matter of 
importance, in their opinion, requires attention. The upper house is 
formed of the three higher ranks and the lower of the remaining six. 
The king often calls either one or both of these houses to confer with 
him. 
Another party holding power which was granted to it by law is com- 
posed of literary men from all parts of the country, and is really the 
voice of the people. In all matters of importance their advice is asked 
by the king and petitions presented by them receive respectful con- 
sideration. Originally the power of this party was limited to moral 
and educational matters, but they have so far stretched the significance 
of these terms that their voice is heard in all political matters. 
When it is considered necessary for them to petition the king they 
meet at the capital, and proceeding to the gate of the palace in a body, 
about 1,000 men, leave their petition resting against the gate. The 
king’s private secretary, who acts as a medium, takes the petition to 
him. While the king is considering their request, they remain outside 
 
-P-A-G-E-377
  
EDUCATION IN KOREA. 845 
seated on mats. Sometimes this conference lasts for days, the people 
of the city paying for the mats, tobacco, and lights. 
There is an old law to which recourse may be had to obtain rights 
from the king. This law allows to the people, high and low, civil and 
military, the right to petition the king. Should this fail, still another 
law allows them to remove “the evils around the king.” This means 
revolution. Although these laws have never been enforced, their exist- 
ence gives to the petitions of the people a power respected by the king. 
In the executive there are seven departments: First. The civil, who_ 
certify to the highest officers and second-grade governors. Second 
The treasury department. Third. Department of official etiquette. 
Fourth. The war department. Fifth. Department of public works. 
Sixth. Department of the interior. Seventh. Department of foreign 
affairs. Each departmentis administered by three ministers and chiefs 
of divisions. 
The judicial branch is divided into six distinct courts: First. Si-hitm- 
bdd (highest court, having no parallel in this country). Second. Gim- 
bbO (star-chamber). Third. Parliament or supreme court. Fourth. 
State court. Fifth. County court. Sixth. Department of justice. 
The judges of the first, or Si-hiim-b06, are the highest authority in the 
country, almost equal to the king. They can correct the administration 
and private conduct of the king. They have power to impeach all high 
officers, supervising all other courts. The second, or Giim-bdd, tries 
high officers and high criminals of any rank. This is the only court 
where the king presides during the trial of criminals. The third, fourth, — 
and fifth, supreme, state, and county courts, correspond to the 
courts of the same names in America. When the supreme court fails 
to give satisfaction to a subject he has a right to appeal directly to the - 
king. This is confined to the common people who have no influence at 
court. There are two ways: either to ring a large bell placed at the 
palace gate for this especial purpose, which can be heard for miles, or 
by attracting the attention of the king when heis out of doors by 
striking a gong before his palankeen? The man is at once taken in 
charge by the police and his case is listened to, and if he has been un- 
justly treated his wrongs arerighted. The sixth or last, the department 
of justice, keeps a record all the courts and executes the sentences of 
all the other courts in the capital city and has restricted power over all 
the courts of the country. 
The ancient Koreans worshipped God in the mountains, and, although 
this old religion is nearly lost in the present religions of Confucius and 
Buddha, they still hold in great respect the mountains where the ancient 
Koreans used to worship. Buddhism was introduced into Korea from 
India and Confucianism from China. The first is the religion of the 
people and the second that of the court. 
Although Confucianism is counted a religion, it is really a system of 
sociology, and has none of the elements of a religion. It refers in no 
 
-P-A-G-E-378
  346 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
way to a future life or to the immortality of the soul. Confucius was 
a moralist and a statesman, but not a savior; and his disciples are 
moralists and economists. The followers of Confucius have a form of 
worship which existed long before his time and was continued by him, 
and the temples built to him are only monuments of respect to his 
memory, and show the esteem in which his teachings are held. They 
are built by the Government, and never opened to the common people 
except for educational purposes. 
The so-called ancestor worship is one of the teachings of Confucius, 
and is common to all Asiatic people. In reality it is no worship at all, 
but simply a memorial service. 
The Chinese accept Confucius in every detail, both as taught by Con- . 
fucius himself and by his disciples, some of whom were contemporary 
with him. 
The Japanese recognize both religions equally, but Confucianism in 
Japan has a direct bearing upon everything relating to human affairs, 
especially the extreme loyalty of the people to the emperor, while the 
Koreans consider it more useful in social matters than in any other 
department of life, and hardly consider its precepts in their business 
and mercantile relations. 
- Buddhism is the real religion of the Korean people. It was supported 
by the Government in ancient times until Confucianism was made the 
eourtreligion. Atpresentit has many temples supported by the women 
of Korea, who are all worshipers of Buddha. This religion in some 
respects resembles Christianity both morally and spiritually. It ineul- 
cates all the moral principles found in the ten commandments of Moses, 
and it teaches that the spirit after death goes either to heaven or to 
hell, or becomes re-embodied in some animal or plant, and that salvation 
issecured through faith, morality, and knowledge or meditation. There 
are two forms of Buddhism, higher and lower. The high Buddhists 
are found only among the philosophers. They are cither priests or celi- 
bates and they devote themselv res to the pads of the soul rather than 
to prayers and ceremonies. ‘ 
These two religions have had great influence in forming the Korean 
character, Confucius teaching them to care for the things of the pres- 
ent, and Buddha turning their thoughts toa life to come, in which they 
will receive in accordance to the things done here. Confucius teaches 
revenge. Buddha forbids it,and says “Thou shaltnot kill.” This com- 
mand refers not only to man, but to animals; and Buddhist priests eat 
no meat. 
There are four moral principles which govern Koreans: Honesty in 
their dealings, respect for women, faithfulness to parents, and humility. 
Polygamy is not practiced in this country, and no wife would pardon 
unfaithfulness in her husband. The genealogy of Koreans is kept with 
great care, and no man whose lineage is not pure can ever become a 
high official.
-P-A-G-E-379
  EDUCATION IN KOREA. “x B47 
Two schools of philosophy are recognized in this country: the ancient 
Korean philosophy, which teaches that there are five elements—metals, 
plants, water, fire, and earth; and the Buddhist philosophy, which 
makes only four—earth, water, fire, and air or wind. Philosophy is a 
subject which interests Koreans, and much study is devoted to it. 
In the twenty-third century B. C. the Koreans were I think a lettered 
people, and in the twelfth century B. C. they had schools to teach read- 
ing, writing, music, and etiquette. . From the third century B. C. up to 
the present time education has gradually increased, and during the last 
five hundred years it has attained a much higher degree of excellence. 
During the present dynasty free schools and many other kinds of edu- 
cational institutions have been established, and, with the exception of a 
few serving girls, all men and women can read and write. Education 
in Korea is held in the highest esteem, and a literary man is received 
with less formality by the prime minister, who is almost equal to. the 
king in rank, than the nobleman or high officials. Not only are the 
respectable classes educated, but even the dancing girls must study 
under teachers dancing, walking, horseback riding, music, poetry, read- 
ing, writing, and painting before they can profitably fulfill their profes- 
sional duties. : : 
Books were first printed about ten centuries ago, when the reigning 
king ordered 150,000 printing blocks to be made for the purpose of print- 
ing several hundred volumes of special Buddhist books. These blocks, 
18 by 20 inches square by 1 inch thick, are carved in wood, in both 
Korean and Chinese. At present they are seldom used, but are stored 
in buildings devoted to this purpose. They have become the property 
of some Buddhist temple. 
Every nobleman, however poor, has a large private library of thou- 
sands of volumes. These are loaned to all who ask, and are kept in 
almost constant circulation. 
The scholars frequently spend their entire time in writing books, both 
of prose and poetry. They are written on both sides of the thinnest 
possible sheets of paper and piled upon the floor till they reach to the 
chin. Many of them accomplish two or three “chins” during their life- 
time, and so great is their respect for literature that on no account 
would they step upon them or destroy a single written word. 
The Korean language and literature have become so mingled with 
the Chinese that it is difficult to convey to a foreigner a correct idea of 
pure Korean pronunciation and idioms. 
The Chinese language is to the Korean what the Latin is to the 
English. It is never spoken by the Koreans, and is read only by the 
educated men. Their scholars study its old records and quote largely 
from it as a classic. Many important, books and all official documents 
are published in Chinese. This language has two styles, the colloquial 
and formal; but they are so far removed, each from the other, that a 
person familiar with the former could hardly understand the latter.

  348 “EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
‘This language, which is merely a collection of hieroglyphics, is very 
difficult to learn, since every child must know not less than 1,000 of 
them in order to study the language. These must not enly be com- 
mitted to memory, but must be learned so they will be recognized at 
sight. Its mtroduction into Korea has had a very marked tendency to 
retard civilization. Its poetry and songs have also suffered by this 
admixture, many of the musical tones of the Korean language being 
lost. 
The Korean language, like the English, has 25 letters and the words 
are of one or more syllables, while the Chinese words have generally 
but one. Many Chinese words have been incorporated into the Korean 
language; for example, all words or syllables ending in ng have a Chi- 
nese origin. The Korean language for centuries has preserved its 
grammatical construction, which, like its alphabet, is based on scien- 
tifie principles. Like the Chinese, it is written in perpendicular lines, 
and the principal words of the sentence have the modifying words 
grouped directly around them. Metaphors and personifications are 
more used in the Korean than in either the Chinese or Japanese lan- 
guages. 
COMPARISON WITH CHINA AND JAPAN. 
Superficially considered, the Koreans resemble the Chinese and 
Japanese in many respects; but, closely observed, they are found to be 
a nation of marked characteristics, with views broader than the Japanese 
and theories more rational than the Chinese. On account of their 
unfavorable geographical position, they seem to be behind Japan in 
adopting modern ideas, but to the student they are really in many 
respects an advanced people, and, although not considering themselves 
superior in everything to their neighbors, they are very proud of their 
culture. They speak of themselves as the ‘nation of culture,” and of 
China and Japan as the “ barbarous nations.” 
The slight body, the color of the hair and skin, the use of rice as the 
principal article of food, the style of dwelling, the wearing of loose gar- 
ments, and the existence of Buddhist temples and followers of Confucius 
are the chief points of resemblance between Koreans and the people of 
China and Japan. 
Examining the particulars mentioned, it will be seen that they point 
as surely to differences as to resemblances. In stature the Koreans 
approach much more nearly to the Caucasians than do either the Chi- 
nese or Japanese, The complexion of the Chinese is decidedly yellowish, 
that of the Japanese is brownish, while the Koreans are lighter than 
either and of a reddish tint. Rice is to the Asiatic races what bread is 
to the European; and the differences in the way of cooking and serving 
it areas marked among the different Asiatic nations as are the varieties 
of bread among the Europeans, while in other foods used by the 
Asiatics the difference is greater; for example, a Korean must have
-P-A-G-E-381
  
EDUCATION IN KOREA. 849 
beef twice a day, a Chinese has pork, and a Japanese either raw or cooked 
fish. Except in Korea, beef can not be found among the natives. 
The men’s dress in Korea is of a style peculiar to that nation, while 
the dlack dress of the Japanese, except in color, is borrowed from 
the Chinese. The dress of the Korean women is similar to the dress of 
American women, except the small waist, while the Chinese and Japa- 
nese women wear the loose dress like the men. 
Buddhism and Confucianism are found in each of these three nations, 
and the mental tone of the people is shown in the manner of treating 
these religions. It is hardly possible in a brief space to explain a 
matter so complicated, but it is fair to say that China and Japan pay 
attention to the ceremonial service at the expense of the religious 
teaching, while Korea devotes her attention to the sacred teachings 
and the study of the religious doctrines and theories of philosophy. 
Korea may allow to China the glory of a more ancient history, and 
to Japan the late reformation in her government and the more skillful 
manufacture of silk and lacquered wares; but Korea’s politica) institu- 
tions, which mark her independent characteristics, were organized on 
scientific principles many centuries ago. The feudal system was 
abolished in Korea about the time it was adopted in Japan. Free 
schools, public hospitals, almshouses, and civil-service examinations 
are old institutions to Korea, unknown, except civil service in China, 
in both the other countries. 
The morality and general culture of Korea is on a much higher plane 
than that of China and Japan. Loyalty to the court is considered a 
strong element of morality in Japan, but in Korea patriotism ranks 
before it. < 
Carefully studied, the differences between these three Asiatic peoples 
will be found to be more pronounced than the differences between the 
Americans, Germans, and French, not only as regards physical, but 
mental qualities. 
PRIVATE SCHOOLS (HAK-BANG). 
The private schools of Korea are to the Koreans in some degree 
what the public schools are to the United States, since through them 
the great mass of the people receive their education. Educated men, 
who are at the same time engaged in some other employment yielding 
an insufficient support, conduct these schools and receive from each 
pupil a small tuition fee. The number of pupils, always boys, never * 
exceeds forty. They begin going to school from 6 to 10 years of age 
and usually finish their education at these schools in 6 years. 
The first book used is the chunja or 1,000 words. It is written in 
Chinese characters and no word is repeated. With each Chinese word 
is learned the corresponding Korean word. 
The lines are of four words each and generally refer to natural facts; 
for example, first line: “The heaven is dark and the earth-is yellow;” 
 
-P-A-G-E-382
. 
  350 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
second, “The sky is broad and the land uneven;” third, “When the 
cold comes the heat goes.” The lesson of four words is assigned by 
the teacher in the morning. Questions are asked by the pupils and. 
explanations made by the teacher; then the children, seated-on cushions 
before desks with their faces to the wall, repeat the lesson aloud twen- 
ty-five times, four times each day. Each child has a counter on which 
he records his progress. These are made of a kind of very stiff, oiled 
paper, beautifully decorated, about 7 inches long and 2 inches wide. At 
the top is a little opening, like a door, which marks 100; a short distance 
below is a group of five similar openings, which denote 10; still lower 
another group of five for units. When the child has repeated the task 
once he opens one of the doors of the units group. He continues open- 
ing the doors till after the sixth repetition, when he closes the last one 
opened. When he has closed all the five doors of the units group he 
opens one in the group of tens and begins once more with the units 
group. When he has opened and closed all the doors of the tens 
group he opens the top door and the lesson is completed for the day. 
Should any little Korean steal a count or misbehave he is made to stand 
on a block or is whipped on the leg. The principal work of the teacher 
after the lesson is given out consists in watching that the pupils keep 
an honest count, in listening to the repetition of the lesson which the 
child has memorized, and in correcting the pronunciation. 
Classes are not formed, but each child finishes one or more books, 
according to his ability. 
Before beginning a new book, each child must be able to repeat the 
chunja from the beginning to the end. 
Penmanship is considered one of the most important branches of 
learning, and the child begins the practice of this art when he begins 
his education at school and can continue it through life, for he learns 
only Chinese characters, and as there are fifty thousand, of these, he 
can always find new matter for practice. The child begins this study 
by following, with a brush dipped in India ink, an outline of the char- 
acter about 4 inches square, which has been faintly drawn by the 
teacher. Twenty or thirty of these characters constitute a lesson, and 
are usually learned in one day. 
About the second year he begins the primary lessons for boys. This 
book is a collection of moral laws and sentiments; for example:    
Between the heavens and the earth the human being, on account of his moral 
* qualities, is superior among all things, therefore we are governed by these five rules, 
viz: (1) Respect between king and subject. (2) Affection between parent and 
child. (3) Decorous bearing between husband and wife. (4) Loyalty between 
friends. (5) Preference to elders. 
The same method is pursued in studying this book. It is committed 
to memory by constant repetition. When it has been thoroughly mem- 
orized the third book is taken up. This is also moral law and contains 
ten volumes. At this time the study of poetry, geography, local and
-P-A-G-E-383
  “EDUCATION IN KOREA. Bor 
Asiatic, the four fundamental rules of arithmetic, and the rudiments of 
government and law begins. The names of the twenty-eight kings of the © 
present dynasty, and the names of the years, which form a‘cycle of 60 
years, are also learned. These studies, however, except the books on 
moral law, are not compulsory, but are pursued by means of pleasant 
games peculiar to the Koreans. During the summer famous poems are 
studied and then committed to memory. In the winter poetic compo- 
sition receives attention; and great facility is acquired by games. 
The study of geography has been somewhat limited, as the Koreans 
until within a few years have not recognized any world outside of their 
own and Asiatic counties. They learn from a book the names of: the 
counties and provinces and the most famous mountains and rivers in 
each province of Korea. This is supplemented by reading the papers 
issued daily by the government. A person not perfectly familiar with 
the 400 names of the counties is considered very ignorant of this 
branch of learning. Asiatic geography is also learned by means ot 
games. 
Arithmetic is taught by the abacus, couinting-sticks, and many pecu- 
liar ways, and the tables through the nines are thoroughly memorized. 
The abacus is used in business calculations, and counting-sticks are em- 
ployed by the Koreans in all their higher mathematical calculations, 
A book of many volumes of Ancient History of Korea and China is 
also studied. The rudiments of government and law are taught by 
means of a chart. This completes the education of the ordinary 
Korean boy. 
HOME SCHOOLS (GUL-BANG), 
Nearly every rich Korean supports a school in his own house. He 
invites to this school the sons of such of his friends as he deems worthy 
of his liberality and desirable associates for his sons. Only highly 
educated men are accepted as teachers, who take entire charge of the 
education of these boys, and also have a general supervision of their 
characters. They receive a liberal salary, board, and clothes. They 
are on the same social plane with the family, and the relations between 
them are of the most friendly character. Often a house is given them 
for their family, who also share in their generous treatment. The in- 
vited pupils, usually the sons of poorer men, receive the same attention 
as the sons of the family. The early studies are generally the same as 
those taken at the huk-bang, though much more thoroughly taught. 
The branches considered necessary fora liberal education are studied 
under these men. They are Chinese and Korean classics, with the 
biography and writings of the most famous authors. Their lives are 
carefully read, and their best works committed to memory. Then fol-. 
lows a book of Confucian doctrines about thé size of the Bible, divided 
into seven books of about fifty volumes. 
Afterthis a Book of Ceremonies, which consists of many volumes, eon-

taining the rules of etiquette, the parliamentary rules, and. the princi- 
ples upon which these rules depend, as well as a record of the conduct 
of famous men reduced to a science, and a history of the feudal states 
which was written by Confucius, and a book of the mental philosophy 
accepted by the followers of Confucius, based on the principle that 
man at birth is without sin; and that this purity, retained and 
enlarged by education, results in the perfect man. 
The education of the ordinary gentleman usually ends with this 
mental philosophy, and any study pursued after this is considered in 
the line of specialties, and is usually either some one of the sciences or 
mental philosophy. 
CONFUCIAN SEMINARIES. 
Another class of schools peculiar to Korea is the Confucian semi- 
naries. These are conducted by the so-called Confucian priests, who 
claim to regulate their lives solely by the rules of Confucius, as well in 
dress and manners as in habits of living. Occasionally these priests 
have left their seclusion and have accepted offices of trust under the 
Government; but these cases are very rare, although they have been 
considered “ the power behind the throne” during many reigns. At 
present, although the court claims to be of the followers of Confucius 
and to respect these priests, they have little political influence. 
HIGHER EDUCATION. 
Instruction in the sciences and arts forming the higher education of © 
Korea is conducted on a plan similar to other private instruction. There 
areno buildings especially devoted to these studies, but those interested 
in some subject form a small class and study under a professor free of 
tuition. These classes are found in many of the large towns, es. 
pecially in the capital, Séoul, where it is estimated that several thou- 
sand scholars, including the Government officials, are employed. 
A large proportion of these students are preparing for the Government 
examinations, and rank higher as scientists than those who study for 
private purposes. Usually a man devotes himself to one of the following 
branches, which are the principal subjects of these specialists: Astron- 
omy, geology, mathematics, law (civil and criminal), medicine and 
surgery, ceremonies (private and official), music, painting, penmanship, 
or foreign languages (Chinese, Japanese, Manchoorian, and Mongolian), 
Sanskrit is studied in the Buddhist temples only. The study of these 
subjects may almost be considered hereditary, families having devoted 
themselves to one study for generations. They are spoken of as the 
House of Astronomy, the House of Languages, ete. The children of 
. these families begin the study of the family specialty not later than 15 
years of age and usually finish the regular course in three or four years, 
but often devote the whole life to the study of this one branch of 
learning. , 
 
-P-A-G-E-385
  EDUCATION IN KOREA. 353 
Astronomy and mathematies are nearly the same in theory as astron- 
omy and mathematics in the western world, but the other branches, 
which may be considered asa sort of post-graduate study, are very 
different from the studies bearing the same name. The law practised 
in Korea was written by an old lawyer four hundred years ago. Much 
of it was his own theory and the remainder was adopted from a treatise | 
on law written by a lawyer of China. This Chinese law book is well 
known in China, but is not accepted by the Chinese Government. These 
law books are called Ta-jun-tong-pitin and Ta-miung-youl and consist 
of about thirty volumes. : 
MEDICAL SCHOOLS, 
The course for medical students includes Tong-ui-bokam, a book of 
anatomy and physiology; Boncho-kang-mok, a book of materia med- 
ica profusely illustrated; and Jé-jung-sin-pien and Kiting-ak-jtin-sii, 
medical commentaries. The action of the pulse, the color of the tongue, 
and the examination of the stomach by pressure are considered of the 
utmost importance in the diagnosis of diseases. 
Medicines are divided into four classes: Tang-yak, obtained by boil- 
ing the ingredients a long time in water; Chui-ro, distilled medicines; 
Gow, a kind of thick syrup obtained by boiling, and pills. 
Surgeons, besides many books of surgery, carefully study a manikin 
of copper to assist them in treating certain diseases by means of a sil- 
ver or copper pin. So proficient do they become in the use of this pin 
that they can cause instant loss of speech by inserting the pin ina cer- 
tain place in the hand. They are also familiar with various adhesive 
plasters and healing washes. 
PRIVATE MILITARY SCHOOLS. 
There are four kinds of private military schools in Korea: Clubs for 
bowmen, schools for the cavalry, schools for the foot soldiers, and 
schools where the students study for the position of line officers and 
the common soldiers and officers study for promotion. 
An old law of Korea calls every man between the ages of 18 or 20 to 
about 50 to do military service, and, although this law can hardly be said 
to have been observed for the last two or three centuries, still it has the 
effect of giving the young men an interest in military affairs. Small 
tnilitary clubs are formed throughout Korea, where rifle practice and 
the flag service for the common soldiers are studied. Besides the prac- 
tice with the flags and the drill every soldier must be acquainted with 
the Chinese words used as passwords. These countersigns are always 
composed of two Chinese words. One of these words is used in the chal- 
lenge, the other in the answer. These clubs are supported by private 
means and are usually taught by officers. 
At all the garrisons and at many private places instruction is given 
by army officers to those desirous of becoming captains. This position 
ED 91——23  
-P-A-G-E-386
  354 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. ' 
is generally filled by promotion from the ranks, but private citizens may 
obtain these places. 
The Government makes no appropriation for this study, but allows 
the soldiers to employ their leisure in this pursuit. The course of study 
includes military science and tactics, the use of forty-eight flags, which 
indicate the different points of the compass and show to the troops the 
direction they are to take, besides the use of numerous other flags, which 
play avery important partin military warfare. Cultivation of the voice 
is always required, that the orders may be given clearly and distinctly. 
Korean cavalry attain a high degree of art, both as riders and in their 
ability to jump and leap from one horse to another while running. 
They are able to swing themselves round the body of the horse in order 
to protect themselves from the bullets or other weapons of the enemy, - 
and they also practice many most complicated feats of horsemanship. 
BUDDHIST SEMINARIES, 
A traveler in the mountains of Korea will often come upon places 
which are really villages of Buddhist priests. Temples, schools, and 
residences of the priests are built near together. The inhabitants, 
always priests, number several hundred, sometimes a thousand. They 
include literary men, artists, mechanics, and artisans of all kinds. 
All the werk of the village is done by these priests, from building 
the temples and decorating them with carvings and paintings to mak- 
ing the clothes and cooking the food. There are two kinds of schools, 
one for students preparing for the ministry, the other for the ordinary 
priests. The former requires about three years of education and the 
latter course depends upon the ability of the student. The course 
for the ministry includes about 30 volumes of sacred writings by 
different authors, oratory, cultivation of the -voice, memorizing many 
prayers, and also numerous hymns written in Sanskrit and Korean, to- 
gether with rules for regulation of the moral conduct of the monks. 
The ordinary priest must be able to read and write, and know a certain 
number of prayers and hymns and the rules of morality fer the monks. 
Some of the priests study the sacred dances and music played on the 
bugle and drum. The artisans and mechanies have no schools, but 
priests who wish to pursue any of the manual labor necessary for the 
proper maintenance of the temple receive private instruction from other 
priests. Only priests or those who have a special religious training 
are qualified for painting the sacred pictures for the temples. 
PUBLIC HIGHER SCHOOLS, 
In the thirteenth century, during the Koriti dynasty, some attempts 
were made to establish a kind of public education, but they were of little 
value. 
In 1394, when the present dynasty came to the throne, interest in 
education received a new impulse and gradually developed a system 
 
-P-A-G-E-387
: EDUCATION IN KOREA. 35D * 
which to-day includes three kinds of schools, the hiang-kio, the hak, 
and the seng-giun-gwan. 
These schools are under the supervision of two commissioners; one, 
_ who is at the head of the university or “seng-giun-gwan,” a high offi- 
cial appointed by the King, and another, who is in reality a superin- 
tendent of a branch of the treasury department, which has in charge the 
expenses of all the officers and students belonging to the educational in- 
stitutions of the country. This commission bears the name of Yang- 
hiun-go, which means “the treasury to support the wise men.” It was 
established by the King in the sixteenth century for the purpose of 
assisting men of high intellectual attainments and equally high moral - 
character who who were not able to earn a living. Although some- 
what modified from its original plan, it still has in charge the educa- 
‘ tional masters of the country. All the students of these public institu- 
tions have finished the regular course under private instruction and 
take up these advanced studies with the intention ‘of devoting their 
lives to intellectual pursuits. 
There are about 400 hiang-kio, or one for each county. The students 
of these colleges are appointed by the superintendent of the college, 
who is himself appointed by the magistrate of the county. These schools 
are supported by the county. 
There are 5 hak in the city of Séoul, one in each ward. The super- 
intendents of these colleges are appointed by the King and the 
students are appointed by the superintendents. 
The school buildings are of the same general style as the public build- 
ings or houses of noblemen. Each school is surrounded by large 
grounds, with an entrance through a large gate. The walls are’ of 
stone, or brick and wood combined, a style peculiar to Korea, and sur- 
mounted by a high sloping roof of tiles. The building stands on ahigh 
terrace of white stone. ' 
Seng-giun-gwan, the highest college or university in the country, 
is at Séoul. The students are taken from those who have received 
the degree of Dr., or Jin Sa, and the number is limited to 100, and they 
have power over all other public schools. This university is in charge 
of a commissioner appointed by the King. 
Seen from an eminence, this university building is little inferior in 
general appearance to the royal palace. The interior decorations of 
carving and bright colored ornamentations are similar to those of the 
palace. These buildings contain many apartments for the students and 
professors and a temple to Confucius. If the students wish they can 
live at these colleges all their lives. The Government makes no allow- 
ance for the education of the young, but these students are allowed to 
receive children as pupils at these institutions. The Government also 
encourages scientific studies by giving rewards at its frequent exami- 
nations; but it makes no appropriation for these branches of study.

356 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
MUSIC, 
The Government has charge of the musical education of the country 
through a commission, Jang-ak-won, or Academy of Music. The Gov- 
ernment musicians number not less than 500 men, including about 200 
students. Any vacancy occurring among the professors is filled by se- 
- lectionfrom the Government employés. The students enter the acadeiny 
at the age of 10 or 15 years. The course of study takes at least three 
years, oftenmore. Graduates haveno trouble in securing appointments 
in the Government service. The instruments used are about thirty-five 
different kinds, consisting of many kinds of drums and string and wind 
instruments. The employés wear scarlet robes with blue silk belt anda 
high black hat ornamented with a bouquet. The dress of the students 
is the same except the hat, which is shaped like a bird and is decorated 
in bright colors. 
Another institution of music is supported by the governor at the 
palace, where the musicians to the royal family practice daily. This 
band of 100 men is gorgeous in yellow dress, belted with blue, and a 
yellow hat trimmed with gold. 
The royal military guard at Séoul, composed of seven brigades, has 
attached to each brigade a musical band of 100 members, and at each 
military station throughout the country the same number of musicians 
is employed for each brigade. The municipal governments of the pro- 
vincial towns and county seats employ from twenty to fifty musicians, 
paid by local government. 
Besides these bands there are numerous private professors and pupils, 
The Koreans are fond of music and consider it an important feature of 
every entertainment, public or private. 
According to an old law all the blind men inthe country must study 
music in the Academy of Music at Séoul as Government students. At 
the present time this law is not strictly observed, but although most of 
the blind prefer to become astrologers, or fortune tellers, the Govern- 
ment stillregulates certain rules in the association of the blind. 
ROYAL SCHOOLS. 
Royal schools are of two kinds. One for the regular education of 
the princes from childhood to manhood; and one for the King where he 
must pursue some study regardless of his age. The school for the 
princes is called “Chun-Bang.” It is under the charge of an officer 
whose rank is equal to that of a cabinet officer. Under him are twelve 
officers whose positions are considered the most honorable in Korea. 
The head officer is the real teacher who assigns the lessons for the day 
and attends to the instruction, while the others are the companions of 
the princes during study hours. ~ 
There is still another great teacher for princes. His position is equal, 
if not superior, to that of prime minister. He is called “Tai-je-hak,”
-P-A-G-E-389
EDUCATION IN KOREA.” 357 
which means the great controller of learning. Heisconcerned not only 
in the national education, but his duties call upon him to promote the 
education of the royal family from the King down. Only a man of rare 
ability can hope to attain this position, and he is held as a kind of 
Korean Shakspeare. This office was created by a highly educated 
king of the present dynasty and ever since has received the respect of 
the King and nation. The first officer holding this position was pre- 
sented by the King with a valuable ink-stone and other desk utensils 
of rare workmanship. Hach succeeding officer has been honored with 
their possession. This officer, although not the regular teacher of the ~ 
prince, examines him from time to time. The opening day of the 
prince’s education is celebrated with much pomp. Tai-je-hak presides 
on this occasion and plans the whole course of the prince’s studies, 
which is similar to that of other children. The prince selects his own 
companions in study. As it is not lawful to punish the prince his 
best loved companion is punished in his stead by standing on a block 
of wood just big enough to be covered with the feet. 
There are two kinds of schools for the king, “Kiting ytin,” or classical 
school, and ‘“So-ta,” or historical school. There is no prescribed course 
or length of term. The studies are pursued only during the winter 
evenings and at the pleasure of the King. The manner of conducting 
these evening studies is somewhat like a Chautauqua circle. Thesacred 
classics are discussed by the King, prime minister, and other high offi- 
cers who are invited by the King to meet in the royal chamber for that 
purpose. The questions are asked and answered in regular order, the 
King always beginning. 
The So-ta or Historical School is composed of members of the Nagak 
or royal club, the King’s private secretary, Sing-chi, and many other 
civil officers. The study is pursued in a similar manner to the Kiting 
yin. Besides the historical studies these meetings are of a social char- 
acter. 
On these occasions the King’s chapel is illuminated with many _ 
scores of wax candles and finely decorated. After the reading, music 
and a banquet follow. The various discussions at these meetings are 
published in the papers issued every morning by the Government. 
There are two other schools held in the palace which can hardly be 
called royal schools, as no members of the royal family attend except 
the King, who acts as teacher. The pupils are several hundred civil 
officers and the sons of high officers. The course of study consists of 
conversation, and reading and writing in Chinese and Japanese. This 
school was established about three hundred years ago. 
The other school is for the sons of nobles who study the ancient 
classics and histories. By means of this school the King makes many 
favorites. ' 
The so-called royal military school is hardly a school or even a club. 
The King, at the head of from 5,000 to 15,000 men, including civil offi- 
 
-P-A-G-E-390
  358 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
cers and soldiers, goes into the field. His position as King entitles him 
to shoot the first arrow, and the others follow in turn according to the 
rules. During the spring, on fine days, the King takes a smaller num- 
ber of men for this exercise in the palace. 
The bow, lance, and spear have been until within the last three cen- 
turies the only weapons of warfare among the. Koreans. Since that 
time rifles have been used by the military, but the King still practices 
with the weapon of his ancestors and never makes use of the rifle offi- 
cially. The old national troops numbered 1,000,000, besides 20,000 
more stationed about the capital. One thousand of the palace guard 
and a certain number of the troops garrisoned about Séoul study mili- 
tary science under the supervision of the King. They practice eighteen 
different movements with the sword in both hands, and acquire great 
skill in fencing and athletic exercises. 
CIVIL SERVICE EXAMINATIONS, 
During the Koriti period, or the dynasty last preceding the present 
one, from the tenth to the fourteenth century, the high officers were 
selected through the civil service examination. Under the present 
dynasty not only competent officers are chosen by the examination, but 
it also influences indirectly all national education. To pass success- 
fully these examinations is the aim of every literary man and is the 
highest hope of parents for their sons. All the noblemen of Korea have 
obtained their positions not by inheritance, but by their rank at these 
examinations. This rank of nobleman is open to everyone, and even 
servants who by education can pass this ordeal are at once raised, with 
their wives, to the nobility. Of course the chances are in favor of the 
sons of the nobility, their surroundings and tastes naturally Jeading 
them to strive for the highest places in the gift of the king, There is 
a story that the most important province of the country, containing 71 
counties, was once under the control of a man raised from the lowest 
ranks through the civil service examination, and that he, as governor 
of this province, received the highest salary paid by the Government, 
240,000 suk of rice per annum (a suk being equal to three bushels), 
Although this story can hardly be considered authentic, still it is told 
as showing the disposition of the Government to encourage education, 
~ The Korean civil service examination is not for any particular class 
of schools, but is a sort of examining board for all kinds of schools. 
The clerical force of the Government is not affected by these exami- 
nations. The clerks are appointed when very young, and are really 
trained in their position. After five or ten years of service they become 
very valuable, and are promoted with increase of salary, retaining their 
places in the service during good behavior. 
There are five classes of examinations, namely: (1) for the selection 
of high officers; (2) for the degree of doctor; (3) for candidate for the 
degree of doctor; (4) for scientific officers; (5) for rewards or prizes for

excellence in scholarship. Competitors may not be under 15 years of 
age, and the descendants of unpardoned-high criminals or a father 
and son of the same family cannot present themselves for examination. 
The examinations are written and oral, together with recitations. No 
examination paper without an official seal will be received by the min- 
ister of that examination. A strip on which is written the name, 
age, residence, and name of the father of the applicant is cut nearly 
across the paper. This is rolled and. sealed, that the examiner may not 
know whose paper he holds. 
In Séoul the examinations for the selection “ Kwa-ga ” are held nearly 
every month. According tolaw only those who have taken the degree 
of doctor are entitled to this examination, buteccasionally this privilege 
is granted to some literary man of especial merit. Once in three years 
this examination is open to all persons; notice is given one year in ad- - 
vance of the day appointed to accommodate candidates at a distance. 
The king and the prime ministersare the chief examiners, with, many 
assistants. 
At these examinations, called Jiing-si, and on accession days many curi- 
ous customs are observed. There are about 50,000 competitors at the 
Jiing-si, which takes place in the examination grounds of the palace. 
This inclosure is covered with grass and has many beautiful trees and 
ornamental pavilions. For this occasion a large tent is raised near the 
examination halls, which are occupied by the examiners, including the 
king, queen, prime ministers, and assistants, during the examination. 
At 2 o’clock p. m. three or four gates are opened to admit this mass of 
men, who contend for the first entrance in order to secure desirable 
places in the tent near to the examination halls. All sorts of tricks are 
resorted to, and those who have the advantage of money pay large 
strong men to act for them and hold their places until the struggle 
subsides, when they take possession. This confusion often lasts into 
the night, but when settled the grounds become brilliant with thousands 
of white tents, each lighted by a square lantern suspended from a pole 
20 or 30 feet high and bearing the symbol of the family represented, 
in order to attract the attention of the king and queen. 
The next day the presence of royalty attended by the palace guards, 
with their magnificent silk flags of bright colors, and the host of civil 
and military officers in full dress add to the already imposing spectacle 
a degree of splendor seldom seen. At 12 o’clock the musicians play 
“Yu-min-lak,” “Share happiness with the people.” After the music 
the examinations begin. 
At the close of the examination the papers are collected by several 
hundred messengers of the king’s private secretary, who deliver them 
to theking’s messengers, who are dressed in scarlet uniform. These 
men take them to some lower officers; who lay them before the king as 
he sits with the many examiners. Three hundred police watch the col- 
lection of these papers, which are 3 feet in width by 5 feet in length. 
    
     
-P-A-G-E-392
    360 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
They are numbered as they are collected with words of the 1,000 Chi- 
nese word book of the children. As before mentioned, the first word in. 
this book is heaven. The first paper is numbered first heaven, the 
second one is numbered second heaven, and so on to the hundredth 
heaven. There are nine examination marks—the first of the first, the 
second of the first, the third oft he first, the first of the second, the . 
second of the second, ete., down to the third of the third, in large letters, 
in red ink. 
At the end of the day the crowd scatters and the competitors wait 
the result of the examination of the papers, which is announced in a 
few days. From the 50,000 papers not more than 20 have passed as 
Kwa-ga and about 100 of the other grades. Those whose papers entitle 
them to the office of Kwa-ga receive their appointment on accession 
day. During the time which intervenes between the announcement of 
the successful candidates and their appointment, if they are of high 
descent, their houses are thronged with guests who call to congratulate 
them. Among these are the princes, prime minister, and all the high 
officials. On accession day the recipient of all these honors goes to the 
palace, where he is welcomed with music, and he receives from the king 
a garland and his appointment wrapped in red silk. This day is the 
proudest of his life, and is equaled in importance only by his wedding 
-day. . If the successful aspirant has wealth, he uses it most lavishly in 
making his house, as well as the procession attending him to the palace, 
as imposing as possible. He is dressed in a pink silk gown fastened 
with a golden belt, and he wears a black silk hat decorated with red 
silk. He is mounted on a horse and surrounded by a host of attend- 
ants giving the yell “Ok tang tui sori” of the Royal college. The 
origin of this yell is lost. For three days after accession day the new 
officer is engaged in returning the calls of his friends. 
The examination for the degree of doctor is held once in three years 
at Séoul. The king appoints several officers to examine the papers, 
from which are chosen 100 for prose and 100 for poetry. This degree is 
sometimes conferred upon competitors 60 or 70 years old without examin- 
ing their papers. The competitors for this degree must bring certificates 
from the governor of the province. Accession day for the doctor has 
its proportionate amount of glory, but he receives no garland from the 
king.. During the three days after the accession they wear green silk 
gowns bordered with black stripes, and high black hats trimmed with 
bunches of red silk threads. This dress is used only on these occasions. 
They are no longer. plain “ Su-bang,” “ Mr.,” but “Jin sa,” “Dr.,” and 
are now entitled to attend any civil service examination. 
Examinations for the primary selection for the doctor examination is 
held once in three years at two placesin each province. One thousand 
papers are selected from six different kinds, as follows: Three kinds of 
poems. The first containing thirty-six lines, every other line rhyming; 
the second, sixty short lines, every other line rhyming; the third, the
-P-A-G-E-393
  EDUCATION IN KOREA. 861 
most difficult, rhymes with lines of irregular length. Three kinds of 
prose: First, criticisms of some famous men; second, commentary on 
some famous literary work; third, discussion or advice on some moral, 
religious, or political question. 
Examinations for scientific officers are held only at Séoul once in three. 
years. The Government has a commission for each of these branches: 
Astronomy, geography, literature, mathematics, painting, penmanship, 
ceremonies, foreign languages, etc. * 
Examinations for prizes are held only at Séoul for students of sci- 
ence four times in a year, and for students of general literature nearly 
every month, and anywhere in the 400 counties as the magistrate may 
appoint. The successful applicants in the scientific course receive as 
rewards a temporary appointment of from three to six months, or 
~money, rolls of cloth, books, stationery, etc. The prizes for literature 
are similar. The successful men are given a reception of a social char- 
acter by the magistrates, 
MILITARY SERVICE EXAMINATION. 
The examinations for the military service are of many kinds, but the 
two principal ones are for the selection of officers, and the chief examin- 
ers are the king, minister of war, all the generals in active service, 
and the governors of eight provinces. The competitors are examined 
in gunnery, archery, horsemanship, tactics and military science, and 
athletics. The prizes are money, rice, and cloth. Those who have 
received high marks become officers. The times of these examina- 
tions are, like the civil examinations, for officers once in three years, for 
prizes very often. The accession ceremony for the military is not of 
equal importance with the civil. The examinations are less crowded as 
they are held in many places at the same time. 
EDUCATION OF WOMEN. 
All the women of Korea are educated at home, by their parents or 
other relatives. Lady teachers are often hired for their instruction, 
but they are very restricted in their intercourse with their pupils, and 
they are not allowed to punish them. When 6 or7 years old little 
girls begin “ Ban-jul,” or making syllables with pure Korean alphabet. 
At theage of 10 they study “‘Un-gan-nok” (letter-writing), penmanship, 
multiplication tables, names of years and days, and the history of 
Korea, “ Yul-yu-jun” (biographies of famous women), history of Korea, 
and ceremonies relating to ancestor worship, They also learn sewing 
and cooking.. The Koreans as a nation excel in cooking, and it is con- 
sidered an important part of every girl’s education. Kuemi is an art 
to which young ladies pay much attention and great skill is often 
acquired in it by ladies of rank. This is the art of arranging food on 
dishes for festal occasions. At all feasts immense dishes of meat, fish, 
cakes, fruits, ete., are placed on the table. These dishes are often piled  
-P-A-G-E-394
    362 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
two and three feet high, and the greatesttasteis displayed in the arrange- 
“ment of the different articles of food, producing beautiful effects of 
color. Jun-kal is also an accomplishment pursued by those ladies 
hoping for a high social position. It is equivalent to polite letter- 
writing in America, with the difference that the message is delivered 
by a servant, who learns it from her mistress, To use the choicest 
language is the aim of the lady. 
The education of girls is ushally finished at about 20 years of age. 
The queen has a special training from the queen dowager. She has 
a more extended general education and a better knowledge of Chinese 
than ladies of a lower rank. She also has a thorough knowledge of 
cookery and sewing. The education of the ladies of the court is sim- 
ilar to that of the queen, and’as the aim of each lady is to be private 
- secretary to the queen, special attention is paid to penmanship with 
almost marvelous results. 
Medicine and surgery are sometimes studied by women. There were 
formerly no schools for women except for the study of medicine, which 
_ they were allowed to study under the direction of the physicians to the 
royal family. Immediately after their graduation they were employed 
by the Government. At the present time, however, but few women 
avail themselves of this still existing privilege. 
RECENT PROGRESS IN EDUCATION, 
A few free schools for the study of English literature and military 
science have been established by the Korean Government since open- 
ing communication. with outside countries. ‘The first one was estab- 
lished in 1881 for instruction in military science and the French method 
of tactics, and hundreds of officers and soldiers were instructed in 
this school. Since that time the soldiers have used modern rifles in- 
stead of the old matchlocks, and they ure drilled like modern soldiers. 
Though this institution was not successful, on account of the revolu- 
tion which occurred the same year, yet 10,000 of the new Korean 
troops continue to drill in this method and to use the modern weapons. 
Another new school was opened in 1882 for the study of the English 
language and literature. About fifty students are studying under a 
few English professors. This school is very successful. 
Two years later another school was established for young noble- 
men of high rank, whose professors are Europeans. The course of 
study consists of English grammar, reading, mathematics, geography, 
history, sciences, and writing in English. There are about forty pupils. 
About a year later or in 1885 two new schools were opened; one for 
medicine, the other for military science. The medical school is not 
quite successful, but the military academy is improving. The superin- 
tendent, Gen. Dye, was recommended by President Cleveland to the 
King of Korea. There are many assistant instructors, most of whom
-P-A-G-E-395
  EDUCATION IN KOREA, — 363 
are Americans, who receive a liberal compensation. The students are 
young noblemen of high rank in military families. 
There was a strong desire among the progressive party to establish 
the modern system of public schools but their defeat makes this im- 
possible for the present. There are, however, hundreds of reading 
clubs among the progressive people and by this means much informa- 
tion can be obtained concerning the modern world. 
The American and English missionaries do valuable work for the 
education of the Korean people. Among the half dozen schools of the 
missionaries there is one for young ladies, fifteen. of whom have entered 
the school every year sincé 1885,

  CHAPTER XII. 
EDUCATION IN HAWAII} 
The census of 1890 gives 12,099 as the population of school age, or 6 
to 15, and the per cent attending school as 81.59, The results of edu- 
cational efforts are seen in the statement that the population over 6 
years of age numbers 78,571, of whom 48.85 per cent are able to read 
and write Hawaiian, English, or some European language. The total 
population was 89,990, of whom 58,714 were males and 31,276 were 
females. Attendance is obligatory. The schools are classed as Goy- 
ernment common schools, in which only Hawaiian is taught; Govern- 
ment English, in which only English is taught; independent, in which 
English is the language of instruction. Though these schools are in 
the main under the auspices of Protestants or Catholics, they are to a 
considerable extent aided by the Government. 
The report of 1892 gives the teachers and pupils as follows:

There is a marked tendency among the natives to give up the 
Hawaiian language. Only 552 pupils are in attendance upon those 
schools in which Hawaiian only is taught. Great reliance therefore 
is placed on the Government English schools, in which about seven- 
tenths of the pupils are enrolled. Pupils in attendance upon Govern- 
ment English schools are given by islands as follows:

   Naturally it is expected that as soon as the pupils come to use the 
English language readily they will be able to accomplish more in other 
subjects of study. Considerable effort is made to advance the quali- 
fications of teachers. Normal classes have been established in one ot 
the schools in Honolulu, in which more than fifty candidates have been 
taught. 
For the country schools an agent has been employed for two years, 
who personally visits the schools and instructs the teachers in improved 
methods. The Government has aided educational conventions by pay- 
ing in part the expenses of the teachers in attendance. Teachers are 
certificated onexamination. First, second, and third class certificates 
are given. Honorary life diplomas may be given after ten years’ sue- 
cessful and satisfactory service. Great efforts are made to improve the 
schools along the same lines of progress as in America. Music is suc- 
cessfully taught; some attention is given to manual training; the kin- 
_ dergarten is attracting attention. By reference to the statistics it will
-P-A-G-E-399
  EDUCATION IN HAWAII. 367 
be noticed that nearly half of the pupils enrolled are engaged in the 
. first year’s work. Special difficulty has been experienced in securing 
the attendance of Chinese girls. Little has been done in promoting 
reading among adults by the establishment of libraries. An appro, 
priation of $1,200 was made for a library in Honolulu. Newspapers 
have attained a measure,of excellence and have considerable cireula- 
tion. Text-books for the schools are prepared on the American plan, 
and America furnishes the main supply of literature for English readers. 
SCHOOL FINANCES. 
The schools are sustained by an appropriation made biennially by 
the Government, supplemented by moneys raised, collected, and ex- 
pended in the respective districts. The Government appropriated in | 
1890 $190,000. An industrial and reformatory school received an ap- 
propriation of $12,000. 
ADMINISTRATION. 
The administration of the schools is by law committed to a board of 
education, composed of five members, whose president makes abiennial 
report to the legislature. The board employs a secretary to attend 
to details of office business and keep its records, and an inspector, emi- 
nent in pedagogical attainments, to visit the schools and promote their 
improvement. : 
Local committees elected by the people in each district have imme- 
diate charge of the district schools. : 
About the schools outside of the administration of the board of edu- 
cation many facts of interest might be noted. The first theological 
school for the education of Hawaiian pastors was opened in 1863, under 
the auspices of the Hawaiian Evangelical Association. It reports ten 
in the regular course and two special students and has accommodation 
for sixteen. It is supported in part by funds from America. 
OAHU COLLEGE. 
Oahu College, founded in 1841, by American missionaries for the 
education of their own sons and daughters, celebrated its jubilee in 
1891, Itis a chartered institution and managed by a board resident in 
Hawaii.’ It is aided by a small endowment fund invested in America 
under the care of a board located there. It has an annual attendance 
of over 50 at the college, and over 150 at the preparatory school. The 
totalnumber of students since its foundation is 966; male, 535; female, 
871; living, 779; resident in the Hawaiian Islands, 488. Its course of 
study may fit. for advanced entrances in New England colleges. No . 
other institution has so efficiently promoted the progress of affairs in 
the Hawaiian Islands. Its largest benefaction, $65,000, was given by 
Hion. C.R. Bishop. Gen. 8. C. Armstrong, founder of Hampton, fitted 
here for his advanced entrance at Williams College,

HISTORICAL. 
The influence of American missionaries upon education in the Ha- 
waiian Islands is seen not alone in Oahu College. The artisans and 
traders who preceded them refused to impart a knowledge of their voca- 
tions to the natives in fear of losing the profits of their ventures. The 
missionaries went to give Christianity and all the blessings that follow 
in its train. Of the first company that sailed from Boston, October 23, 
1819, accompanying the two preachers, were two schoolmasters and 
their wives, and a physician, a farmer, and a printer. They had little 
to guide them. Kamehameha II was on the throne. They obtained 
from him permission to reside on the islands and “to teach the people 
Christianity, literature, and the arts.” The King, having a residence 
near the location of Rev. Asa. Thurston, one of the two pioneer mis- 
sionaries, was reading the English Testament in three months. Five 
others were reading in Webster’s spelling book. The Hawaiian lan- 
guage had not been reduced to writing; this was yet to be accom- - 
plished by the missionaries. The King put two of the scholars under 
instruction that he might judge by personal observation whether 
education was worth while er not. The head men were among the 
most eager pupils. It was Charlemagne and the schools of Alcuin 
repeated. The first schoolhouses were thatched huts like those in 
which the people lived, with no seats or desks. Teaching was of no 
very high order, boys of 14 being set to instruct a school where not only 
children but parents came to be taught. The hours of instruction were 
‘from 7 to 9 in the morning and from 3 to 5 in the afternoon. The 
Hawaiian language began to be reduced to writing, and January 7, 
1822, printing commenced. 
In 1834 the first newspaper, The Light of Hawaii, wasissued. Books 
stimulated the attendance upon instruction. The primitive schools at 
the time of the highest prosperity reached the number of 900, attended 
by 52,000 pupils, mostly adults. The chiefs enforced attendance, and 
declared that no one could hold office or be married who could not read 
and write. In addition to these rude efforts, special schools were or- 
ganized by the missionaries in which more thorough work was under- 
taken. In 1841 the first school law was enacted by the King and chiefs 
in council. Parents in each village were to elect a school committee 
that were to act in conjunction with the school agents appointed for 
each island, over all of whom a superintendent was appointed by the 
King and council. In 1843 a department of public instruction was or- 
ganized and placed in. charge of a minister of the crown who was a 
cabinet officer. This position was first occupied by Mr. W. Richards, 
who at his death in 1847 was succeeded by Mr. R. Armstrong. In 1855 
the department was remodeled and its work intrusted to a board of 
education, whose president was to discharge the duties of the minister 
of public instruction but who was not to be a member of the cabinet. 
Mr. R. Armstrong filled this office from 1855 to 1860. 
In the early establishment of the system of public instruction, man-
-P-A-G-E-401

ual labor was made an important part thereof. Pupils were expected 
to labor two hours a day with their hands. From the first, girls and 
boys were taken into the mission families and were more or less thor- 
oughly instructed in the ordinary duties and arrangements of domestic 
life. The missionaries furnished models in all departments of activity. 
When the first girls’ boarding school was opened on July 6, 1837, Miss 
Brown was the teacher in spinning and weaving. The six or eight 
young women under her charge made in the first five months about 
90 yards of cloth from cotton of Hawaiian growth. The joining of 
hand work with mind work in Hawaii succeeded very differently from 
the experiments tried about the same date in the United States.

  ELEMENTARY EDUCATION IN THE CIVILIZED WORLD. 
1. IN EUROPE. 
The population of European countries (i. e., Great Britain and Ireland, 
France, Belgium, Netherlands, Switzerland, Prussia, Bavaria, Saxony, 
Wiirtemberg, Baden, Austria, Hungary, Denmark, Norway and Sweden, 
Russia, Roumania, Seryia, Bulgaria, Greece, Italy, Spain, and Portu- 
gal)' is found to bz 366,044,532, according to census and reliable esti- 
mates, 
The number o/ pupils in elementary schools in the same countries is 
found to be 37,0).4,708, or 10.11 per cent of the population. 
But since the difference between the educational activity of western, 
northern, and central Europe on the one hand, and southern and 
eastern Europe on the other, is very marked, it would seem proper te 
group the countries in the foregoing lists as follows: 
Western, Northern, and Central Europe. Southern and Eastern Europe. 
Great Britain and Ireland, France, Belgium, Neth- | Portugal, Spain, Italy, Greece, Bulgaria, Servia, 
erlands, Switzerland, Prussia, Bavaria, Saxony, | Roumania, and Russia.

Population, 202,928,690. percent. 
Pupils in elementary schools, 29,354,575, or 14.5 
per cent. 
If we take the percentage (14.5) of the first group as a standard for 
entire Europe, there ought to be in elementary schools 16,061,749 more 
children than at present, to-wit: 53,076,457 instead of 37,014,708. 
If we apply the percentage found in countries farthest advanced, 
Germany and Switzerland (to-wit: 18 per cent), to entire Europe, the 
number of children not in school, who ought to be, is found to be 
28,873,295; namely, 65,388,003 in school instead of 37,014,708. 
2. IN PAN-AMERICA. 
The population of the American continents together is 117,790,641, 
Tt is found that there are 16,792,275 pupils in the elementary schools, 
or 14.3 per cent. But separating, for the sake of comparison, the 
countries of the two continents into two groups, United States and 
Canada on the one hand, and all of Spanish America on the other, we 
get the following results: 
      United States and Canada: Spanish America: 
Population -- 67,454, 929 Population - 50,334, 712 
Pupils in schools - . 14, 966, 150 Pupils in schools . - 1,826, 125

-P-A-G-E-406
  3T4 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
Applying the percentage found in the United States, Pan-America 
ought to have 9,121,666 pupils in schools more than it has, namely, 
25,913,941 instead of 16,792,275. However, the enrollment in the 
United States and Canada contains many duplicate names of children 
attending winter and summer schools, hence it would seem proper to 
regard the percentage found in Gerniany, where rigid compulsory 
attendance has been enforced for nearly a century, i. ¢.,18 per cent to 
be the true percentage. Applying that to Pan-America (instead of 22 
per cent), we find the number of children in school is short only 4,410,042 
of what it ought to be. 
3. IN AUSTRALIA. 
Australia (i. e, New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, South 
Australia, West Australia, Tasmania, New Zealand) has a population 
of 3,809,897 and 715,889 pupils in elementary schools, or 18.8 per cent. 
Applying the German and Swiss standard of 18 per cent, Australia 
would have only 685,781 pupils. Applying the United States standard 
of 22 per cent, Australia ought to have 838,176 pupils in elementary - 
schools, 
4, IN AFRICA. 
Egypt and the British Possessions in Africa, in the Mediterranean, 
and the Indian Ocean have 11,894,522 inhabitants and 519,321 pupils 
in elementary schools, or 4.4 percent. Applying the German standard 
of 18 per cent, we find these countries should have 2,141,013, or 1,621,792 
more pupils than there are enrolled in school. ‘If we apply the United 
States standard of 22 per cent, which we know to be exorbitant, there 
should be 2,097,473 more pupils than there are attending schodél. 
5. IN ASIA, 
India and Japan, the only couxtries from which we have reliable 
data, have a population of 327,626,892, and only 3,499,882, or about 1 
per cent, attending élementary schools. If we apply the German stand- 
ard of 18 per cent, we find the discrepancy in the number of pupils to 
be 54,981,958. Applying the United States standard of 22 per cent, 
the diserepancy would be 58,589,034. 
SUMMARY. 
All the countries named have a population of 827,216,484, and re- 
port 58,542,073 pupils attending elementary schools, or about 7 per 
cent. If we apply the German per centage of 18 per cent, the discrep- 
ancy in the number of pupils is found to be 90,356,866 (that is, 
148,898,959 instead of 58,542,075). If we apply the United States 
percentage of 22 per cent, the number of pupils withheld from school 
is found to be 3 per cent greater; namely, 123,445,553,

  ELEMENTARY EDUCATION IN THE CIVILIZED WORLD. 375 
It may be considered idle speculation to go one step further and com- 
pare the number of children in elementary schools found with the entire 
population of the earth, which Hiibner states to be 1,484,253,000. 
However, having gone so far, we may go to the end of the chapter. 
Considering, first, that the number enrolled in elementary schools 
stated to be 58,542,075 is not quite correct, owing to the omission of 
some principalities of Germany, from which no statistics are available, 
also of the “ Free Cities,” with their well organized school systems, and 
considering further that the countries not mentioned (such as European 
and Asiatic Turkey, Persia, Siberia, Further India, the Dutch Colo- 
nies, Hawaii, and other islands in the Pacific) are not entirely without 
elementary schools, it is justifiable to assume the number of elementary 
school children to be about 60,000,000, which is a close estimate. If 
we in conclusion consider the fact that, though China has not a regu- 
larly established and supervised public school system, it has a system 
of elementary education which for all practical purposes fulfills the 
functions of a system of schools such as we know, this education, 
such as it is, brings about 60 per cent of all the inhabitants of China 
to a knowledge of the rudiments of book learning (which presupposes 
about 10 per cent of the population in schools); hence it becomes ap- 
parent that the aforestated number of children under school influence 
(60,000,000) must be raised to 100,000,000. (Population of China esti- 
mated at 402,680,000.) 
One hundred millions then is the estimate of the number of children 
in elementary schools all over the world. To this should be added 1 
or 2 per cent to represent the number in secondary and higher institu- 
tions of learning. Now, if 60,000,000 are about 4 per cent of the popu- 
lation, 100,000,000 are 6.7 per cent. If we apply the German standard 
of 18 per cent, the number of children in school ought to be 267,170,940, 
which discloses a discrepancy of 207,000,000; if the United States 
standard of 22 per cent be applied, the discrepancy is still greater, 
namely, 266,500,000. Of course, if the other number, which includes 
China, is taken as a basis, the discrepancies would be correspondingly 
smaller. :

    CHAPTER XIII 
LEGAL EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES} 
I.—REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON LEGAL EDUCATION. 
[Submitted at Saratoga, N. Y., August 24, 1892.] 
To the American Bar Association: 
At the last meeting of the association (1891) the following resolution 
was passed: 
That the further consideration of a proper course of study for American law schools 
be recommitted to the standing committee on legal education for the ensuing year, 
. when they shall be appointed, with the request that (after a careful examination of 
the valuable material with reference'to such systems in other countries, now or here-

The committee have been in constant communication with the Bureau 
of Education since their last report, but they regret to say that it has 
been found impracticable to put the foreign material referred to in the 
resolution in a form to be presented to the association at this meeting. 
  
1Chapters XIU, XIV, XV, and XVI constitute a Report on Legal Education in the 
United States and Foreign Countries, of which an edition of 5,500 has been printed 
as advance sheets; also a special edition of 5,500 ordered by the Senate for its own 
use. The following letter explaining the circumstances of its preparation accom- 
‘panied the report in its separate form: 
  DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, 
BUREAU OF EDUCATION, 
Washington, November 2, 1892. 
Sir: I have the honor to forward for publication a report upon legal education in 
the United States, in Europe, and in other parts of the world. It consists mainly 
of statements showing what is taught and what methods of instruction are pursued 
in the leading law schools of the various countries, and offers the latest statistics 
available. This information has been collected by the Bureau of Education within 
the last two years, at the request of the committe on legal education of the Amer- 
ican Bar Association, which has undertaken an investigation of the courses and 
methods of instruction in the law prevailing im this and other countries. The report 
presented by this committee to the association in 1892 is embodied in the present 
document as a suitable introduction to the facts collected and set forth. “The mem- 
bership of this committee during the three years of its existence has been as follows: 
In 1890.—William G: Hammond, St. Louis; George M. Sharp, Baltimore, and 
Henry Wade Rogers, Evanston, Ill. 
In 1891.—William G. Hammond, Henry Wade Rogers, George M. Sharp, George 
O. Shattuck, Boston, and J. Hubley Ashton, Washington.

LEGAL EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES. 377 
Large accessions have been made since the meeting of 1891 at Boston, 
but there are a considerable number of places yet to be heard from and 
other important gaps are to be filled before an intelligent view of the 
whole subject can be presented. Arrangements haye been made with 
Dr. Harris, the Commissioner of Education, whereby a report in.some 
detail on the subject will be prepared by the Bureau and the committee 
acting in céoperation, with such explanations as may be necessary to 
those not familar with the terminology of legal education in foreign 
countries. This will appear in the Commissioner’s next report, to be 
published in December. The committee regret that they are obliged 
to refer to this report for a detailed account of foreign systems. They 
are confident that such an account of the experience of many countries 
in legal education will give much instructive information to those in- 
terested in the subject in the United States. The general conclusions 
of the committee from the matter referred to will be hereinafter 
stated. 
Before entering upon the consideration of a proper course of study 
for American law schools, the committee thought it desirable to learn 
the present condition of legal education in the United States and the 
views of leading educators on the subject. To this end they addressed. 
In 1892.—Same as in 1891. For 1893 Mr. Shattuck has been succeeded by Samuel 
Williston, Cambridge, Mass. 
The compilation of the present document has been made with great care and indus- 
try by Dr. L. R. Klemm, specialist of this Bureau in foreign educational systems, 
who has thoroughly edited and arranged the material received and made several 
important original contributions thereto. The matter relating to law schools, col- 
leges, and the common schools in the United States has been extracted from cata- 
Jogues and reports in a painstaking and judicious manner by Mr. Wellford Addis, 
Mr. Lewis A. Kalbach, and Mr. James C. Boykin; that relating to Spanish America 
by Miss Frances G. French, and that relating to Canada and Australia by Mr. Eu- 
gene B. Lacy, all of this Bureau. Mr. Sharp, of the committee, has furnished con- 
stant assistance and wise suggestions. The chief clerk of the Bureau, Mr. John W. 
Holeombe, conducted most of the correspondence connected with this work, has su- 
pervised its preparation, and taken charge of the revision of the proofs. 
Additional information, criticism, and the correction of errors are solicited from 
any readers, and will be gratefully received. 
The desire of the American Bar Association, in inaugurating the investigations 
which have been carried on as above described, was to further the improvement in 
quality and methods of instruction furnished to students of the law in this country. 
It has given me great satisfaction to coéperate with the committee in their work, 
and I am now gratified to offer, through you, to the public and particularly to the 
legal profession, the result of the joint labors of the committee and the Bureau of 
Education. 
Lam, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant, 
W. T. Harris, 
Commissioner. 
Hon. Joun W. Nosy, 
Secretary of the Interior.

378 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91, 
a letter to a number of gentlemen of reputation as educators, request- 
ing their views. The committee desire to acknowledge their indebted- 
ness to many of the gentlemen referred to for the attention given to 
their letter and the careful and valuable replies received from them. 
The committee also procured catalogues of nearly all the law schools- 
including the most important ones in the United States. In the report 
of last year on pages 17, 18, 19, and 20 will be found late statistics re- 
garding the number of students and professors, and other information. 
The committee have not thought it important to prepare tables giving 
the same information to a later date, inasmuch as this will appear in | 
the next report of the Bureau of Education. But they would say that 
there were in the academic year 1891-92 about 6,000 students.’ It 
_ will be noticed that there has been a phenomenal increase in the num- 
ber of students attending the schools in the last three years. The 
total attendance of all the schools in the country in the academic year 
1888-89 was 3,906, showing an increase of nearly 50 per cent in that 
time. An examination of Table No. 1 of Appendix B, annexed to the 
report of last year, will show that there has been a greater increase in 
the past three years than there had been in the previous ten. 
The information of-the committee regarding legal education is con- 
fined to the law schools; they have no means of ascertaining the num- 
ber of students who are pursuing their studies in offices, or the course 
of study pursued by them. The law schools certainly present the best 
side of legal education in the country. 
The information of the committee relating to the schools is derived 
from catalogues of the schools, the replies to the committee’s letter, aad 
the personal observation of the members of the committee. 
The information contained in the catalogues is in general somewhat 
indefinite, but certain results are clear. No standard course of study 
or method of instruction exists. In fact, it can not be said that ex- 
actly the same course of study or methed of instruction prevails in any 
two schools. 
It is evident that the course of study in the schools is, with a very 
few exceptions, confined to the branches of practical private law which 
a student finds of use in the first years of his practice. Itis the techni- 
cal rather than the scientific or philosophic view of law which is taught. 
Thus we find that the subjects of contracts, with its branches of 
agency, suretyship, insurance, bills and notes, partnership, ete., torts, 
real and personal property, conveyancing, corporations, bailments, 
wills and the administration of estates, mercantile law, domestic rela- 
tions, common-law pleading and practice, evidence, equity jurispru- 
dence and procedure, are taught in all the schools. Itis superfluous to 
remark that a course of study omitting any of them would be imper- 
fect. Some attention appears to be given certain special subjects, as 
  
“ 1§0ce statisties on p. 432,
-P-A-G-E-411
    LEGAL EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES. 3879 
patents and admiralty; railroads and telegraphs are mentioned, instrue- 
tion being chiefly by special lectures. 
Instruction in the jurisdiction and practice in the United States 
courts is given in less than half the schools, and medical jurisprudence 
in about one-fourth. 
Instruction in public law is generally confined to constitutional law 
and criminal law. Instruction in constitutional law appears for the 
most part to be limited to the Constitution of the United States and the 
eases and legislation connected with it. Instruction is rare in com- 
parative constitutional law and the history and development of the 
principles of constitutional government, and unysual in English con- 
stitutional law. 
Adnninistrative law, including the organization of departments of 
-our Government, State and national, is generally neglected. 
Public international law is a part of the course in less than half the 
schools, and private international law in even a less number. 
The various subjects of history and theory of law and government 
appear to be neglected, except in three or four schools. 
The history of American and English law is taught by lectures in 
perhaps six schools. 
Post-graduate courses have been established in several schools. The 
course of study is for the most part a continuance of the subjects of 
private law already referred to, though in one or two cases provision is 
made for instruction in historical and comparative jurisprudence and 
history and theory of law and the science of government. Studentsin 
some cases are encouraged to pursue such courses by free tuition, re- 
duced fees. for tuition, free rooms. 
Instruetion in classification of law and elementary law appears to be 
confined to use of the treatises of Blackstone, Robinson’s Elementary 
Law, Walker’s American Law, or books of corresponding character. 
In the schools connected with the large universities provision is made,, 
generally without charge, for attendance by students on exercises in 
the literary departments, particularly in history, political science, and 
politicaleconomy. But this is optional, and not a part of the law course, 
and in the opinion of the committee is rarely availed of by students, 
for want of time if for no other reason. 
The course of study in the schools of the country will be shown in 
tables annexed to the next report of the Bureau of Education. This 
table, together with the table relating to the courses of study in foreign 
countries, can be printed and distributed by this association if it is 
desired, 
The methods of instruction do not admit of exact classification, but 
the committee, for convenience, adopt that frequently used, viz, reci- 
tations from text-books, lectures, and the “case system.” 
1. Recitations from text-books.—In this system a certain number of 
pages of a text-book are assigned the student, upon which he is exam-
-P-A-G-E-412
  
  380 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
ined the following day. This appears to-be the foundation of instruc- 
tion in a large majority of the schools, though it is used in very few, 
not more, than four or five, as the sole method of instruction, being gen- 
erally combined with lectures and the reading of cases. In some schools 
‘the recitation is supplemented by a lecture on the subject of the lesson, 
by the instructor, who comments on, explains, and amplifies the text. 
In many of the schools a colloquy or discussion by the students, di- 
rected by the professor, is practiced as a part of the exercise, in which 
the students analyze the subject, compare the authorities, and criticise 
the author, ete., and in some this is the principal method of instruction. 
In a large number of schools, cases illustrating the text selected from 
the notes or from recent decisions are referred to the students, and a 
recitation in some form upon them is required. In general, cases are 
said to be used to illustrate a principle or show its historical develop- 
ment. ; 
2. Lectures.—Instruction by means of lectures only is adopted in 
very few schools, though this appears to be the only method of instrue- 
tion in a few schools (four or five), but is used to a considerable extent 
in connection with recitations from text-books in nearly all. Students 
are usually examined on the lecture the following day. In some schools 
the lectures are accompanied by a collateral course of reading from text- 
books and reports, and in some a colloquy follows the lecture. <A large 
majority of schools use the system of recitations from text-books com- 
bined with the lectures, students being examined on the text of the 
book and the lectures. In a few schools special lectures are given, in- 
tended to amplify the course of instruction on particular topics, and 
apply in a more detailed way than is practicable in the recitations of 
the class room those general principles the students have learned from ~ 
the text-books. Such lectures are generally on practice in the United 
States courts, admiralty, patents, insurance, corporations, and rail- 
roads. 
In a number of the schools. students are required to take notes of 
the lectures, which must be exhibited to the faculty; in some cases 
they are required to read their notes to the class. In a few schools 
full notes of the lectures given is a condition of graduation. 
The committee would say that, so far as any mode of instruction can 
be said to prevail, it is founded primarily on the lesson in the text- 
books, with a lecture or explanatory remarks by the professor, the 
reading of a certain number of cases by the student, and a recitation 
or colloquy. 
In some schools the lecture system is used entirely for some subjects 
and recitations from text-books for others. 
3. The case system.—This is defined by Prof. Keener in his article in 
the Yale Law Journal, Vol. 1, p. 144, as follows: 
The case system consists of putting into the hands of the student a number of 
cases on any given subject, taken not at haphazard, but selected by the professor 
with a view to developing the law on that subject.
-P-A-G-E-413
  _ LEGAL EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES, 381: 
~ It must be borne in mind that this method of teaching does not consist in lectures 
by the instructor, with reference to cases in support of the proposition stated by 
him. The exercises in the lecture room consist in a statement and discussion by the 
students of the cases studied by them in advance. This discussion is under the di- 
rection of the instructor, who makes such suggestions and expresses such opinions as 
seem necessary. The student is required to analyze each case, discriminating be- 
tween the relevant and the irrelevant, between the actual and possible grounds of 
decision. And having thus discussed the case, he is prepared and required to deal 
with it in its relation to other cases. 
» It is apparent from what has been said that the essential idea in this 
system is the exclusive use of cases in teaching law. The colloquy or 
discussion of cases described by Professor Keener is common to all 
systems of instruction, and is practiced to a great extent in connection 
with text-books and lectures. 
The study of cases is also general, being the practice in nearly all 
the schools, but it is generally said in connection with the study ot 
eases that the purpose is to illustrate principles, to familiarize the stu- 
dent with the leading cases, and train the mind in analysis. But cases 
are not in other systems the sole method of instruction. 
It is argued in favor of this system that “the theory on which this 
proceeds is that it is only by regarding law as a science that one can 
justify its being taught in a university, and, regarding it as a science, 
the student should not only be encouraged to investigate the law in 
its original sources, but should be distinctly discouraged from regard. 
ing as law what is in fact simply the conclusions of writers, whose 
opinions are based upon the materialto which the student can be given, 
access.” (Page 144.) 
“The case system, then, proceeds on the theory that law isa science, 
and asa science should be studied in the original sources, and that the 
original sources are the adjvdged cases, and not the opinions of text 
writers, based upon the adjudged cases. But the law is an applied 
science, and therefore, to appreciate thoroughly the principle involved 
in a given topic, the student should deal with it in its application, and 
as he learns these principles in their application they are not a mere 
abstraction, but have assumed to him a concrete form, and he is pre- 
pared to apply them in mastering new problems. Instead of reading 
about principles, he is studying and investigating the principles them. 
selves. Under this system the student is taught to look upon law as a 
science consisting of a body of principles to be found in the adjudged, 
cases, the cases being to him what the specimen is to the mineralogist, 
Tt should be remembered that the student is not simply given the speci- 
men and asked to find out as best he can what it is, but each specimen. 
is accompanied by an elaborate explanation and classification. In com- 
paring the system of teaching by cases with the ordinary text-book 
system it should not be forgotten that the decision of the court is not 
simply a judgment for the plaintiff or for the defendant upon a given, 
statement of facts, but that the reasons therefor are given at length,  
-P-A-G-E-414
  382 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
and the opinion of the court giving the reasons for the conclusion 
reached is really the only authoritive treatise which we have in our 
law.” (Lbid., 145.) 
While, on the contrary, it is argued against the system that it is 
erroneous in theory, that the cases are not the original sources of law, 
that the decisions of the courts are but evidence of the law and are 
but the application of principles to the particular facts, and, therefore, 
the student starts his course of study with a totally erroneous founda- 
tion in theory, which as he proceeds will have important results in 
practice. 
The objection seems to us torest chiefly on a confusion of the two senses 
in which “ the sources of law” and similar terms are commonly used. 
That the decided cases are the sources from which we must learn what 
the law is no intelligent common lawyer will dispute. Our very 
treatises and text-books derive from the cases they quote all the au- 
thority they have. But it does not follow (although Austin Pomeroy 
and others have so assumed) that the cases make the law in the same 
sense in which the statute or the legislator does. Each case is the 
decision of an individual or singular point. The law is the general rule 
on which that point is decided, or, to use the quaint phrase of Thom- 
asius, “the decisions are the principia cognoscendi, but not the prinei- 
pia essendi of the law.” Of their use as the exclusive means of instrue- 
tion in law schools something more will be said hereafter. 
The advocates of the three systems rely alike on the approval of 
eminent lawyers, and point with confidence to results as proving the 
superiority of their respective views. All are animated with a sincere 
love of their profession and a desire for its best interests. = 
- In addition to lectures on and instructions in practice, various practi- 
eal exercises are used in the different schools; in addition to the collo- 
quy described where students discuss the law and reason, analyze, and 
distinguish, there are moot courts, quiz clubs, and debating societies. 
Moot courts are general, though there is not by any means an uni- 
form standard of excellence. In some schools the exercises of the 
moot court are limited to the argument of a hypothetical case before a 
single professor; while in others a complete judiciary system is at- 
tempted of courts of original and appellate jurisdiction, with clerk, 
sheriff, and other customary officers. In this system students fill the 
offices except the judgeships, where they sometimes sit as associates. 
In these courts students prepare papers and conduct suits in all forms 
atlaw or equity, including the preparation service, filing, ete., of plead- 
ings, decrees, and orders, etc. They perform the duties of clerks and 
sheriffs, making the proper indorsements on papers, keep a docket, and 
prepare records for appeals, appeal bonds, ete. 
Between these extremes there are courts of every degree of profi- 
ciency. The committee think the moot court in any form one of the 
most common as well as the most useful exercises a student can prac- 
 
-P-A-G-E-415
  LEGAL EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES, 383 
tice. Exercises in drafting pleadings, conveyances, etc., are also gen- 
eral. 
Colloquies are also common, where there is a general discussion of 
some subject of law by the students and professor, the latter directing 
and controlling. The seminary exists in a number of schools. De- 
bating societies are recommended and appear to exist in most of the 
schools. 
In a number of the schools students are required to write essays on 
specified subjects; also to write opinions on cases stated. In many 
schools a thesis isa condition of graduation. Law journals are pub- 
lished in several of the schools. The editorial work is done by stu-_ 
dents. New and interesting cases are reported, and articles on law are 
published, written either by students or, what is more common, by writ- 
ers of more advanced age and experience. 
Examinations —There is no uniform custom regarding examinations, 
In most of the schools written or oral examinations are held. The 
number of schools having annual examinations and examinations at the 
end of the terms appears to be nearly equal. In some, examinations 
are held “at the end of each course,” “at the end of the book.” 
Prizes are given in about half the schools. They consist of money, 
varying in amounts from $100 to $20, gold medals, and books. The 
prizes are usually awarded for the best thesis, for the best examina- 
tions, in senior or junior year, best orations, excellence in debate, ete. 
A few free scholarships in law exist to be awarded to deserving stu- 
dents, but this is very unusual in the schools. 
The committee think that so far as the subjects of private law re- 
ferred to are concerned, the course of study in most of the schools is 
adequate and the instruction sufficient. They avoid any reference to 
particular schools because much must be left, in any case, to the judg- 
ment of the authorities of the school. They are influenced by many 
considerations unknown to the committee. The laws of their State, the 
sentiment of the locality, the class of students who attend the scliools, 
and other things may render impracticable in one community what 
would be easy in another. But it may be said of them all that the in- 
struction is too technical. It is not elementary enough. As has al- 
ready been said, the view of law presented to the student is technical 
rather than scientific or philosophical. 
In considering the subject of a course of study in American law 
schools, the committee are embarrassed by the fact that a longer course 
than two years is impracticable for the greater number of schools, 
The competition of life is growing stronger all the time, and is urging 
young men into active, breadwinning occupations early in life. The 
youth of America, as a rule, wish to be independent. The sentiment 
of the profession and the. publie will not sustain, at least in some parts 
| of the country, a longer course than two years, and even this is im- 
practicable in some places.  
-P-A-G-E-416
    384 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
And yet it will take a student at least two years under present 
methods to acquire a competent knowledge of the subjects of private law 
referred to to fit him for practice. There is little time he can devote to 
public law, the history and theory of the law, and the science of gov- 
ernment, unless our methods of instruction are so improved as to save 
the time now given to the mere memorizing of practical rules and 
points of law, of no real service to the beginner, and to employ it on 
these topics, indispensable in a true system of legal education. 
The importance of well-trained lawyers is greater now than at any 
time in history. The law has become so complex and extensive with 
the multitude of decisions and statutes that a higher training is indis- 
pensable. A publishing company in a late advertisement offers to the 
bar full reports of 75,000 cases decided in the courts of the United 
States (State and national) since January 1, 1887, The difference be- 
tween the law of to-day and that of fifty years ago may be illustrated 
by an observation of Prof. E. J. Phelps in a recent article on education: ° 
“Tt is easy to find single opinions in which more authorities are cited 
than were mentioned by Marshall in the whole thirty years of his un- 
exampled judicial life, and briefs that contain more cases than Webster 
referred to in all the arguments he ever delivered.” 
A system of law which accepts all the cases on a given subject as 
authority is possible only with a thorough knowledge of the elemen- 
tary principles of the law on the part of the lawyers and judges. 
These, with a proper classification and scientific method, have become 
indispensable. : 
Again, it must be remembered that the lawyers fill a large propor- 
tion of our offices, State and national, and their influence is most potent 
in political affairs. 
The mind of the lawyer is the essential part of the machinery of 
justice; no progress or reforms can be made until.the lawyers are 
ready. Their influence at the bar, gn the bench, and in legislation is 
practically omnipotent. The progress of the law means the progress 
of the lawyer, not of a few talented men who are on the outposts of 
legal thought, but the great army of the commonplace who constitute 
the majority in every occupation. What the lawyers do not under- 
stand, or what they pronounce visionary and impracticable, will not be 
accepted by the legislatures or courts of the country It is conceded 
that the development of the higher jurisprudence has become essential 
to the continuance of the system, inasmuch as the railroads, telegraph, 
and ocean racers have brought countries into close communication 
which a century ago were distant and hardly known, when commerce 
is extended all over the globe and our citizens are called for business 
and pleasure to the most distant countries, where they purchase prop- 
erty, incur obligations, or acquire rights. It is not enough that an 
American lawyer shall now know the decisions and statutes of his own 
State, or even of his own country, to which the course of study is now 
for the most part confined.
-P-A-G-E-417
  
LEGAL EDUCATION IN: THE UNITED STATES, 385 
Yet, recognizing the fact that a course of more than two years is im- 
practicable for most, the committee recommend— 
1. That for those to whom a longer course of study is possible, provi- 
sion be made in the schools for post-graduate courses, where the subjects 
of general jurisprudence and public law shall be taught. 
2. A system of electives, now found necessary in almost every branch 
of education by reason of the extent of human learning, and already 
existing in several of the schools, in which students shall be required, 
in addition to the usual course in private law already described, to pur- 
sue at least a certain number of subjects in public law, international 
law, the history and theory of the law, comparative jurisprudence, and 
the science of government. 
8. Better preliminary training, if practicable. A large proportion of 
the schools require no entrance examination, and in none of them is the 
entrance examination equivalent to that of the A. B. degree in any repu- 
table college in the country. It may not be foreign to the subjects of 
this report that a knowledge of law is important to every citizen of the 
country, whether he is engaged in private business or public life. The 
committee think the knowledge of the institutes and general principles 
of the law would be an advantage to every citizen; in fact, that it is 
now a part of general education, and that a course of law should be a 
part of the senior-year studies in colleges. In a Government like ours, 
where the people rule, and where so many aspire to, and some attain, 
public office, a knowledge of our form of Government, State and na- 
tional, and of the institutes and general principles of the law is neces- 
sary, and the committee think in the public schools of the country some 
instruction should be given in the form and principles of our Govern- 
ment and in the elementary principles of the law. 
The law schools of the country are in good hands. As a rule, the 
instructors are lawyers engaged in active practice. Most of them are 
“men of the best position at the bar of their respective communities 5 
many of them are men of national*and international distinction. There 
are a great many judges, State and national, including three judges of 
the Supreme Court of the United States, engaged in teaching. The 
committee believe the law teachers of the country are sincerely and 
earnestly devoted to their work and will welcome and aid all efforts to 
improve legal education and elevate their profession. 
In this connection it will be instructive to study the efforts of the 
present and last generations of English lawyers, in both branches of 
the profession, to improve legal education in the mother country alike 
of our blood and our Jaw. Those efforts have shown a general profes- 
sional interest on the subject during the last fifty years which has not 
been felt in the United States, but is worthy of imitation here. They 
show also an intelligent comprehension of the true methods of such 
improvement and a constantly growing perception of the right means 
to attain it, which can not be too carefully studied by American teachers 
ED 91 25

  386 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
of law. A fll and clear account of these efforts and the results thus 
far obtained in England has been prepared for the committee by one of 
its members (J. Hubley Ashton, esq., of Washington, D. C.), and will — 
be found in the Appendix, to which the attention of the members of the 
association is respectfully directed. 
The most. instructive lesson to be derived from the continental 
European schools will not be found in their present methods alone or in 
any of those formerly employed during the eight hundred years which 
haye elapsed since the revival of scientific law. It lies rather in the 
history of the gradual development of a method really adapted to school 
instruction, for such instruction necessarily implies a scientific method. 
Individuals may pick up the methods of any art or practice by mere 
observation of what is done before them, or by constant repetition, 
until the process has become familiar, as the apprentice learns his trade. 
Bnt when a class of students are brought together, even to learn the 
‘cheory of a mere mechanical operation, still more that of a system like 
Jaw, under the direction of a teacher, the entire course of teaching 
must depend upon the order in which the truths are presented. This 
method differs somewhat in every science; but there is none deserving 
the name which can be taught by simply writing down its results in a 
book and giving them to the learner to be committed to memory, still 
less by repeating them to him. ‘The use of such books is indeed often 
defended by lawyers on the ground that it is an advantage for students 
to become familiar with the same books they will use as practitioners. 
If true, this is only true in the sense in which the apprentice should 
learn as early as possible the mere tools of his trade. . But it overlooks 
entirely the difference between the education of the brain and that of 
the eye or the hand. Even in the study of arithmetic.or grammar the 
ehild must familiarize himself with general notions and principles 
before he can make much use of examples, or understand their processes 
and results. The entire time spent in the study of the law is too brief 
and precious to be wasted in merely-committing to memory what the 
learner can find in the books as he wants it. The beginner must first 
master that knowledge which is to be carried always in his mind to 
enable him to understand the legal force of the decided points as he 
reads them, and to draw from a case all the inferences that will be nec- 
essary to make it applicable to other cases not yet decided. These 
things can not be taken from the books as wanted; but the more of 
them he has in his mind the more help he will find in the books when 
he comes to them. 
At the same time, it must be remembered that the more purely ab- 
stract a science is, the easier it may be put in a formof words. But the 
practical sciences, those that are arts as well, like the law, require ex- 
ercise of the mind in practical processes before their truths can be ap- 
preciated. To prepare a youth for the work of the lawyer by exercise 
of the memory alone is as much as if one should attempt to train a
-P-A-G-E-419

pianist in the same way. It follows that the law can not be taught by 
merely giving to the student the form of words in which its rules are 
expressed for the direction of the courts, where such a form exits; still 
less in giving him the mere form of words in which the courts have 
enunciated their decisions of particular questions. In neither form is 
tne science of law so expressed as to be readily assimilated by the mind 
of beginners. They require a knowledge of the topics with which the 
law deals, not merely in concrete form, but as reduced to a scientific 
classification affording terms of definite and consistent meaning, with- 
out which no general truth can be expressed. Indeed, there is no law 
for concrete cases, as there is no reasoning concerning singulars. All 
the certainty of the law consists in the general terms in which its truths 
are expressed, 
No better illistration of this truth can be given than is afforded by 
the experience of the earliest modern law schools. Irnerius and his 
followers found themselves in possession of the grandest body of writ- 
ten laws ever yet in the possession of mankind, the body of civil law 
bequeathed by Rome to posterity. Naturally they assumed that the 
student needed only to know and remember the language of the civil 
law, with only such casual explanation as the novelty of some words 
might require. It soon became apparent, however, that these glosses 
were too numerous and too various to be carried in any mind by mere 
dint of memory and made of practical use when occasion called. The 
separate explanations soon grew into a science of interpretation, ac- 
cording to their effect upon the words of the text, by which the student 
or the practitioner could frame new interpretations as the case might 
require. All law being in their eyes the command of the emperor, this 
interpretation was the only mode in which its language could be adapted 
to the immense variety of actual questions arising in courts of justice, 
and therefore the science of interpretation was the science of law itself 
so far as the student or practitioner was concerned. 
Wemay digress here fora moment to point out the important infla- 
ence on English law of its lack of any written code like that of the 
Romans. With all the influence exerted by that code in England for a 
century and a half or two centuries after Vacarius, no part of it was 
ever accepted as an authoritative text in theisland. Its authority was 
purely scientific and not legislative; and hence there could properly be 
no interpretation where there was no text to be interpreted. 
Glanvil asserted the entire absence of written law when Vacarius 
was but lately dead if not still living; and Fleta followed him in the 
same assertion when the Roman law was in a rapid decline, more than 
a century later. To see how great a difference this makes and how 
largely it may account for that decline of Roman law which is a 
singular feature of our English experience, we need only to note the 
entire absence of the doctrine of interpretation from the early law of 
England, as we may easily do by comparing the text of Bracton with 
   
-P-A-G-E-420
  388 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
that of the civilians from whom he borrows so much, and especially 
with Azo. 
On the continent the acceptance of the entire text of the corpus juris 
civilis (with very: trifling exceptions) as authoritive law, and the im- 
position thereon of a vast science of interpretation in the shape of 
glosses, comments, and finally of entire treatises, in time made the body 
of law so immense -that the student could master it only imperfectly, 
and even the judge or practitioner was confused rather than enlight- 
ened by the amount of his reading. The practical consequence was 
that which must always result when a system of laws becomes too large 
or too verbosely expressed to be mastered as a harmonious whole, or 
applied as a consistent system in the decision of every case. Doubts 
and contradictions multiplied until there was hardly a practical ques- 
tion upon which the authorities did not conflict. The most honest 
judge was reduced to the poor expedient of counting the authorities 
for and against a proposed ruling, and following the majority instead 
of deducing a result from the fundamental principles of the law. At- 
tempts to abridge or systematize the authorities only added to their 
bulk, so long as the false theory of accepting every word of the written 
text and every opinion of a commentator or interpreter as a part of the 
Jaw continued. It was not until the great jurists of the sixteenth cen- 
tury saw the necessity of looking beneath this immense and shapeless 
mass of words for the few and comparatively simple principles in which 
the reason of the laws consisted that the way was open to improve- 
ment. The great historian of the Roman law in the middle ages has 
given us a most appreciative yet critical and just account of the con- 
dition of legal science from its revival to its lowest subsequent stage, 
three centuries later. (Savigny, History of the Roman Law in the 
Middle Ages; see especially Vol. 11, chap. 28; Vol. v, chap. 41; and * 
Vol. vi, chaps. 47 and 60.) 
He has, indeed, fully appreciated the value ofthe glossators’ services 
to the science while they were at work upon the text of the law and 
attempting to construct a systematic body of principles from it. He 
says justly that in this labor of construction a theory of law was evolved 
for the first time, at least since the classic age of Roman jurisprudence, 
and the beginning was made of that distinction between theory and 
practice which has beenrecognized ever since, a distinction, as he justly 
says, of benefit or of injury to the science as it is rightly or wrongly 
treated. (Vol. Iv, p. 224.) 
He then shows the change that came over their methods about the 
time when their labors were closed and their results were digested in 
the Accursion gloss; the elevation of that gloss to the rank of an author- 
ity even superior to the text, and the mere copying of former opinions in 
place of active thought in the elimination of principles. Writers were 
content to repeat the language of their predecessors and to follow the 
common opinion of the greater number without attempting to find the

reason of the law and the decision of the doubt in conformity with the 
principle. He also points out the instructive fact that this decline first 
appeared in the books written for practicing lawyers, which became mere 
compilations of points and dicta while a truer method. of discussion still 
lingered in the schools. These books, by their verbosity, and by efforts 
to give an opinion upon every practical point, show that they were in- 
tended to content mere readers who sought to make a mechanical use 
of them without any expenditure of thought; a trait which has come 
down in lineal succession directly to the treatises and practical works 
of the present day. ' 
Even the schools soon fell into a traditional method which no one 
dared to break over, and would have sunk into the merest formalism, 
destitute of all real life and activity, but for the presence in them of a few 
men who were not mere lecturers, but took an active part in contem- 
porary life and business. These wrote Consilia, or opinions in actual 
eases, public and private, which are the characteristic books of the 
period, and by their constant reference to the actual relations and inter- 
ests of men saved the schools from the deadening influence that then 
controlled them. This breath of real life could not by itself reform the 
absurd methods, then in use, butit imparted life enough to make them 
susceptible to the quickening efforts of the following century. Among 
the best of these writers are Cinus and Bartolus, who spent most of 
their early manhood in actual practice, and Bella Pertica and Lucas 
De Penna, who never sat in a teacher’s chair. The latter’s book is pro- 
nounced by Savigny freer from the defects of the school method than 
any other of his time. (Savigny, Vol. v1, pp. 1-21.) 
But perhaps the most striking illustration of this aid to the schools 
from without (though not mentioned by Savigny because not coming 
within the limits of his subject) is the remarkable book of Conrad Lagus, 
a German writer, who in the sixteenth century wrote the first book for 
students that attempted to cut loose from the accepted methods, and to 
deliver the science of law to the student in the form in which it would 
find most ready entrance to his mind. Lagus himself was never areg- 
ular graduate or an accepted teacher of law. He filled in early life the 
place of private tutor to such students of the University of Louvain as 
chose to employ him, and was later syndic of the city of Dantzic on the 
Baltic. His book was first written for his own students, and was so 
free in its expression of criticisms upon prevailing methods thatit gave 
great offense to the authorities, and was even putinto the Index. But 
its merits enabled it to triumph over all opposition, and it went through 
several editions and no doubt had a most important influence in form- 
ing a new school of legal instruction. Even after three centuries and a 
half the student of scientific law may read it with interest and instruc- 
tion. For the best account of Lagus see Dr. Theodore Muther’s His- 
tory of Legal Science and of the Universities in Germany, Jena, 1876, 
pp. 394-424,

In this sketch and in the picture given by Savigny of the lowest deg. 
radation of legal science, after its revival in the universities, the thought- 
ful reader must recognize too many traits of our owntime. Thus, when 
he points out the neglect of the original authorities and the substitu- 
tion of merecompilations at second or third hand, instead of a constant 
effort to trace back the law to its original principles; or when he speaks 
of the entire abandonment of efforts to treat the law as a system, as a 
consistent and harmonious whole; a task which by the natural law of 
its development should have given to that scientific unity a constantly 
increasing influence upon the separate rules and doctrines applicable to 
particular cases, instead of being neglected altogether in favor of ex- 
clusive attention to the authority quoted for each particular rule. There 
are even analogies in the external form of the law between the two 
periods. Asin the fifteenth century, the earlier variety of juridical 
works had all given way to mere consilia or collections of opinions upon 
detached points, so in the nineteenth century we have a boundless 
waste of such opinions in our reports, increasing at the rate of a hun- 
dred volumes a year; with almost as many volumes of treatises, most 
of which are mere compilations of the same opinions, without the slight- 
est attempt to evolve true principles or to present the law asa system. 
With reference to the entire lack of historical study at that time and 
the resemblance of our own country at present in that respect, the 
- lesson furnished us by the comparison is still more instructive. There 
was indeed for the fifteenth century the excuse that a historical science 
of law had never yet been dreamed of, while in the nineteenth we are 
willfully or ignorantly neglecting a method that has within the past 
century been thoroughly tested in Europe, and the benefits of which 
are evident to all who have paid it the slightest attention. Savigny’s 
own words are here worth quoting: 
All of a science that is the product of continuous development forms an organic 
whole; and no portion of it can be thoroughly understood unless it is studied in con- 
nection with the rest. Thus the entire system of legal science which governs our 
actions can only be thoroughly mastered by historical study, going back to its first 
beginning and following it into all later ramifications. Then we can use it freely 
for every new purpose as a means by which the freedom and effect of our own think- 
ing will be increased and its object accomplished. Used in any other way, every 
mass of knowledge will only cramp and oppress our encrgies without our knowing 
it, and make us its servants where we should be its masters. (Savigny, Vol. v, p. 
474.) 
The chief improvement of the sixteenth century was undoubtedly the 
abandonment of the legal method or study of the texts of law in their 
original order, and the substitution of systematic works in which the 
natural order of the subject was followed with more or less success. 
The work of Lagus, already mentioned, was perhaps the earliest ex- 
ample of this kind which now retains any value; for in the three 
centuries since there has been a constant improvement in the arrange- 
ment of these works, due to a more thorough comprehension of the law 
 
-P-A-G-E-423
  LEGAL EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES. 391% 
itself and a greater mastery of the mode of teaching it. The most re- 
markable evidence of this mastery is in the great reduction of the size 
of the books placed in the student’s hands.’ Instead of compelling him 
to read through and memorize ten or a dozen octavo volumes in the 
course of a year, the European professor places in his hands a modest 
duodecimo called institutes or pandects, containing all that is essen- 
tial for him to read in a semester or even a year, while the subject con- 
densed in that book will furnish the topic of daily exercises or lectures” 
during that period. By this process the student’s memory is charged 
only with those fundamental principles which he must always earry 
there in order to make any use of them; but his comprehension of them 
and power to apply to them is obtained by the fuller explanation given 
him and by his daily reflection upon them. This work, moreover, is not 
upon a single branch of law, however important, as all the work of an 
American law school is, but it is upon the law itself as a complete and 
harmonious system. Even in the fuller treatment of the Pandecten the 
space given to such topics as represent our “ property,” or “ contract,” 
or “ wills,” is hardly greater than it would be in the most elementary 
book known to American law; butthe object of these few pages is to give 
the student a complete and thorough comprehension of the nature of the 
subject under which all his subsequent acquisitions will arrange them- 
selves according to the very law of thought; net merely to give him a 
selection of the most practical rules by which he may know how to de- 
cide this or that particular question. Perhaps the greatest advantage 
in this mode of study is that the student acquires the law as a whole 
and not as a congeries of separate and independent doctrines; or, as it 
has been expressed by an eminent writer, quoted on page 37 of our re- 
port of 1891, “ The continental lawyer in a comparatively brief univer- 
sity course of jurisprudence obtains a firm mastery of the entire law; 
the English lawyers are specialists. / Not one is able to grasp the whole 
system.” : 
We have dwelt on this point the more fully because it is needed to 
qualify what must be said of our present text-books as means of instruc- 
tion. With few exceptions all these are written for the use of the prac- 
ticing lawyer, whose object it is to find a case in point for the brief he 
is making, with the least possible expenditure of time, and without 
troubling himself with questions of classification or principle. The stu- 
dent, on the other hand, needs books rigidly systematized and dealing 
chietly with general principles. It is only from these that he can assim- _ 
ilate matter which will become a true part of his mind and the basis of 
his legal thinking. For the decision of particular points or for the illus- 
tration of general truths text-books are worse than useless. For these 
things he should be led directly to the cases themselves, but only under 
the most careful guidance. 
The experienced lawyer can deal intelligently with a great body of 
varying if not conflicting cases, and deduce from them a harmonious
-P-A-G-E-424
  392 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
doctrine, provided such a doctrine be contained in them.. Even he will 
find it impossible to do this except by the heroic method of rejecting a 
considerable minority of the decisions which, according to the popular 
theory of judge-made law, have the same right to remain authoritative 
with the majority. The task would be impossible to him if he had not 
a firm grasp of the principles to which every such decision must conform 
to be an integral part of a consistent and logical system. Most lawyers 
have learned their principles unconsciously and without fixed rule, as 
a mechanic learns the expert use of his tools or the physician the ele- 
ments of an accurate diagnosis. They perform the task of applying 
them to-new cases by what is called “sound judgment” or “ grasp of 
principle,” but they are quite unable to explain to a student their modus 
operandi. 
To expect the beginner to deal in this way with the cases is little less 
than absurd. The brightest and swiftest could not go into a barber 
shop and handle a razor on its customers without making his ignor- 
_ ance and awkwardness evident to the youngest apprentice, yet he is 
expected to handle the keener weapons of analytic casuistry with 
utterly unpracticed faculties and obtain by the operation the very 
principles on which the value of all his subsequent reasoning must de- 
pend. 
We do not mean to underrate the value to him of judiciously selected 
cases as objects of study, either in the deduction of principles from 
their comparison as contemporaneous authorities, or (what we regard 
as of still greater use) as teaching the historical growth and develop- 
ment of such principles in time. But both those processes imply that 
the cases have been chosen and arranged for him by a teacher who 
knows what he desires to accomplish, and how he is to effect it. 
Neither of these objects can be gained by setting the student to read 
all the cases, well or ill decided, accurately or blunderingly reported, 
ora digest of them, or a so-called treatise made up of them, but stated 
in any order that will best enable the reader to find in the same chap- 
ter or page all the cases resembling each other in the facts, without a 
thought of the principles which each or any of them may illustrate. In 
truth, the most popular of our text-books—many of them excellently 
adapted for the use of the practitioners—are so utterly devoid of scien- 
tific arrangement, or of any arrangement except such as will enable the 
attorney to find a case in point with the least possible thought of gen- 
eral principles, that the only advantage they offer over the perusal of 
cases at large is their condensation of results and the increased facility 
they give for a mere verbal memorizing of these results as a cram for 
examination. 
A limitation of the case method, and probably an unavoidable one, is 
its confinement to the doubtful part of the law and disregard of the 
great but settled principles upon which so much of the lawyer’s reason- 
ing depends. These principles have been evolved by cases as truly as
-P-A-G-E-425
  
  f 
LEGAL EDUCATION IN. THE UNITED STATES, 893 
the latest rule of contract or of tort. The difference between heredita- 
ments and chattels, the distinction between chattels real and personal, 
have been worked out by decisions of the sages that sat in the ‘“ com- 
mon place” centuries ago; but no teacher would think of tracing their 
origin back to the primary authorities. All our canons of inheritance 
only formulate the results of early cases; but who would make his stu- 
dents read assizes of mord and writs of aiel and bisaiel or of cosinage 
in-order to know them more thoroughly? It is not merely from dislike 
to the ancient phraseology; most of the collections of cases for students? 
usecontain extracts from the year books on questions that have remained. 
unsettled from that time. They pass by only those which have deter- 
mined the point so well that it has never been mooted since. This 
would be of less consequence if the student could find these well-settled 
doctrines properly described in a history of the early law, showing the 
manner of their development. This historical method, indeed, is the 
proper complement of the case study given to the modern law, and 
is to be hoped that we may yet haveit. But at present the casemethod 
offers nothing for a most important portion of the entire field of law. 
For example, the beginner is trained to careful discrimination of the 
nicest shades of the agent’s liability, or to draw the exact line between 
the fellow servant and the alter ego or vice-principal; but who tells 
him how servant and agent come to be different relations, or defines 
either one distinctly enough to help him appreciate the result of their 
difference? 
The result of this elaborate study of actual disputes and ignoring of 
the settled doctrines that have grown out of past ones is a class of 
graduates admirably calculated to argue any side of any controversy 
or to make briefs for those who do so, but quite unable to advise a client 
when he is safe from litigation. 
Weare not setting up an ideal standard of morals when we insist 
that even in the law school, the work of which is mainly technical, the 
student should not be so trained as to think he is to be a mere hired 
gladiator, fighting indifferently for one side or the other that pays his 
fee. There are, indeed, many cases in, which, once begun, he may justly 
maintain the legal right of either party. But every lawyer has much 
to do with the question whether litigation shall begin or not, and he 
who incites it from selfish motives must be ranked with the physician 
who knowingly spreads the germs of disease. Even he who begins or 
needlessly maintains an unwise action for lack of sound judgment or 
learning to perceive its defects is unfit for his high calling. Assuming 
to be the guide and adviser of other men, he is bound fully to qualify 
himself to guide them aright, and this he can not do unless he knows 
the whole law, at leastin its general principles; not merely those parts 
of it on which litigation is now possible. This distinction is perhaps 
oftener overlooked in discussing methods of study than any other. 
There is much law upon which no litigation ever arises—unless it be
-P-A-G-E-426
  394 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
from sheer ignorance or knavery—but which is just as important and 
significant in determining the rights and duties of men in their recip- 
rocal relations as if it were subject to be reversed in the next term of 
the Supreme Court. All the common terms designating legal institu- 
tions and relations, kinds of property, forms of estate, wrongs and rem- 
Gdies, have a wide extent of settled meaning upon which no question 
ever arises. This may have been gradually formed in past times by 
former cases and decisions, but no one thinks of disputing it now. It 
is only on the border lines between two or more of these broad’ prov- 
inees that doubts spring up and cases grow. 
No conception held in common by a large number of men such as the 
members of a State or great community can be very complex in its na- 
ture or difficult of comprehension. This may be taken for granted as 
one of the laws of thought. Consequently the fundamental notions 
out of which the rules of law are derived must be of this simple char- 
acter, since it is in the general acceptance and uniformity of these no- 
tions that the common law exists as such. 
Liberty, property, reputation, land, chattel, would be useless terms 
to reason from or with, if they were not uniform in all intelligent minds, 
and to such they must be capable of correct apprehension without a 
process of verbose definition and without much mental effort of any ~ 
kind. No deduction can be drawn from them that is not warranted by 
this simple character. : 
Perhaps the most useful single lesson we can learn from the continent 
at the present time is the value of the historieal method in teaching the 
elements of law. Much as has been done recently in England by Sir 
Henry Maine and his followers in this direction, it must be owned that 
we in the United States, and even our English cousins, are a century 
behind the continent in appreciating the value of the historical method 
of study as applied to the moral and jural sciences. In our law schools 
it seems to be quite unknown, as much so to the teachers as to the stu- 
dents. Yet foreign experience has left us no doubt of its adaptation to 
those elementary notions of law for which our cther tried methods have 
proven almost complete failures. Only the minority of beginners enter 
these schools with minds so trained to abstract thought as to readily 
take in and appropriate a full systematic treatment of the rationale of 
law sufficient to enable them to use the most rudimentary conceptions. 
To the majority of practitioners its use is simply incomprehensible. 
“ What difference does it make to the law to-day whether the rule was 
this way or that one hundred years ago? I do not want to know or use 
any law that is not clear law now. It would only confuse me if it dif- 
fered from the present rule, and be a waste of time ifit did not.” Such 
are the common objections made to this proposal; and the proposer is 
fortunate if he gets no worse reputation than that of a harmless enthu- 
siast who would waste his own time and would lead students to do the 
same.
-P-A-G-E-427
  LEGAL EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES. 895 
It must be owned that he sometimes deserves it, when his zeal out- 
runs his judgment and allows any curious scrap of legal antiquities to 
figure as a part of legal history. The two should be carefully distin- 
guished; but it is so much easier to pick up scattered bits of curious 
fact than to slowly reproduce the past life of a people ora science! 
Much that is valuable material for history is not history, and to cumber 
the student’s mind with these scattered facts is even worse than to load 
his memory with disconnected rules or cases of the present day, with 
which they have to work out the practical problems of law, such as 
those of right and duty, of wrongs private and public, direct and indi- 
rect, of injuria and damnum, of legal force, fraud, negligence, imputa- 
bility, ete. 
Even the great reputation of Austin for the last thirty years has 
never drawn attention to his very able attempt at such a scientific analy-- 
sis of these terms as he deems essential to their proper study. 
The average student tries hard to commit what is said in his books 
to memory, but gets no clear notions from it, because it has as yet no 
connection in his mind with the forms it takes in actual life, and with 
mostit ends in the memorizing of a definition for each word that he 
thinks the examiner may ask about. Hence some of our text writers 
have given up entirely the effort to explain these before enteri ing upon 
the practical uses made of them. 
To such teachers and such students it may seem almost paradoxical 
to Say that mere abstractions, so difficult to apprehend when they are 
presented as parts of a: complicated system actually existing, may be 
plain and obvious when traced through the centuries of their rise and 
development, so that a mere beginner can follow easily and with inter- 
est the growth of the same system from the few rude notions of our 
ancestors to the complex relations of the modern law. Yet we do not 
appeal solely to European experience for the value of the method. We 
have only to look into the most rigidly systematic of our treatises to 
see how certainly the author in every case of doubt or difficulty falls 
back upon the historical development of the subject to explain it, or 
appeal to the experienced practitioner for the grounds of the confidence 
with which he depends on the principles that have unconsciously formed | 
themselves in his mind, or ask our president, experienced practitioner, 
eminent judge, and admired author in one. 
But chiefly the historical method commends ‘itself for elementary 
teaching, because it does not show the laws either in the form of mere 
abstractions or in that of individual cases, but illustrates at every step 
the process by which it rises from the mere evidential fact to the highest 
generalization, though in theinverse order. It begins with a few simple 
wrongs to the person and possessions, and shows how these become 
differentiated into the wrongs of the man, the husband, the master, the 
householder; how it then learns to discriminate in each case between 
the direct attack and the carefully laid deceit and the negligent harm;
-P-A-G-E-428
  
  396 EDUCATION’ REPORT, 1890-91. 
how it adds to breach of common right that of an obligation imposed 
by the party’s own will, and how it passes from the enforcement of com- 
mon law to the direction of the use made of legal rights as determined 
by the conscience of a good man according to equity. So, too, of its 
gradual development in all other branches. 
Most of all, the historic method suits the tyro, because it does not deal 
with abstractions alone as the elementary part of systematic law 
needs must. It presents rights and wrongs, and duties, and remedies, 
not under their names and their definitions, but as found in the actual 
forms of primitive law, the blows and maimings, the stealing of cattle 
and of wives, the feuds and beseigings and outlawries which occupied 
the primitive moots. It goes on to show new forms of right in tenure 
and estate of lands, property in chattels, contracts in their double office 
of transferring property and creating obligations, and all these again 
duplicated in the distinctions of legal and equitable rights, ete. It thus 
presents the most practical and obvious forms of these acts in their 
growth toward the institutions of the present day, but always as linked 
together by the scientific notion of rights and duties, wrongs and reme- 
dies, on which they are based to-day, and thus illustrating them to the 
beginner. 
The genetic order of abstract ideas and of the relations animated by 
them can be traced as accurately as those of the various forms of mat- 
ter. The task is even easier to a cultivated mind, since the variety is 
less confusing and the chronologic order simpler in the history of éach 
race or nation. The simple or homogeneous is easily discerned from 
the complex, heterogeneous notion, and precedes it even more certainly 
in the mental world than in the material. This has only been obscured 
by the ancient but fallacious axiom that morals and the other reflective 
sciences have been the same in all ages; to be consistent with which 
we must deny all possibility of growth and development, such as his- 
tory shows in morality and law. 
Equally inconsistent with the true conception of development in 
legal ideas is the mistake, now more frequently committed, of carrying 
back each separate notion or institution from one system to another, as 
if none could be accounted for by any othermethod. This is sometimes 
done by the most zealous historical students, who in their love of trac- 
ing laws and customs through the past and from one people to another 
seem occasionally to forget the possibility of a new birth in the long 
ages from the beginning. If we had succeeded, as the physicists have, 
in eliminating certain pure elements of law that can not be accounted 
for by the combination or changes of other bodies, it might be safe to 
assume that these can not be fully studied till we have thus traced them 
to the beginning of all things. But the phenomena of law are of a com- 
plex character, and there are very few that do not undergo great changes 
of form in the course of a few centuries, even in one and the same na- 
tion. These changes are occasionally so complete that the historic ex-
-P-A-G-E-429

istence of one form may be said to disappear entircly and one or more 
new ones to be formed from it. We may find a well-marked new in- 
stitution made by the combination of different elements, no one of which 
accounts for it without the rest, or can be said to have historic con- 
  tinuity with it. The same thing may have occurred in early ages as well 
as later; yet how often when the trace is so lost we find students assum- 
ing at oncea foreign origin as necessary and wasting much labor in look- 
ing for the nearest clow (e. g., the origin of the jury or that of the Ro- — 
man obligatio). 
This tendency to misunderstand the past by carrying back concep- 
tions and terms of later date to explain facts that occurred before these 
were formed appears in its most fallacious form in the ease of those 
general abstract terms that are so broad and simple, and find room for 
such a wide variety of concrete phenomena, that we can not think of — 
the mind itself as existing without them. 
These are the “innate ideas” against which Locke’s war was waged 
and which he conquered so completely in theory that no one would 
maintain their existence as a scientific fact to-day. But when any one 
of them makes its appearance as a result of induction it has so simple — 
and natural a form that we can not think of it as nonexistent at any — 
period when men like ourselves were on the stage of action. Such are 
our notions of promise as an element of contract, of command as an 
element of law, of property as a relation to the external world. 
But why go back in our historical study to periods so far from us that-_ 
a tyro can see no resemblance whatever between the law then in force — 
and that of to-day? 
Partly because even then one who has traced the whole system can 
point out truths that bear directly on questions still agitated, as when 
in the earliest volume of the year books we find discussed questions 
still unsettled in the law of bailments or husband and wife. (Y. B., 
20-21, Edw. 1.) The very absence of modern doctrines is often the fact 
of greatest importance to be pointed out in these early periods. To es- 
tablish the truth that our Anglo-Saxon forefathers knew nothing of 
legislative power, of motive as a legal test, of contract as a distinct 
element, clears the field of many mistaken theories, and simplifies the 
student’s task more than any other course hecanadopt. Every reason 
for studying the law historically applies with as much force to one 
period as another. The same considerations that lead us to study the 
law of the eighteenth century for the sake of understanding that of 
the ninetcenth work with increased force at every step and require 
us to know the law of the eighth century before we proceed to the 
ninth. 
Experience confirms what we learn from theory in this. There is no 
point in the long history of the common law where we can begin with 
the law then in force, apart from historical information as to what pre- 
ceded. The worst mistakes that have complicated the problem have ©
-P-A-G-E-430
    398 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
grown out of ill-advised confidence in our power to understand the law- 
of a particular period by our modern standards of what was natural 
law. The aid of the strictly historical method is even more necessary 
the farther back we go. ‘The error of interpreting facts of the past by 
ideas of the present increases with every stage of our retrospective 
study. Past and present are always merely relative terms. 
The value now set upon the historical method in urope is shown by 
the maxims which a distinguished jurist has set upon the title page of 
his book: “It is history which teaches us what the law is; it is science 
which teaches us to useit.” It is shown, also, not merely by the mass 
of literature devoted to that purpose, but still more by the position of 
the historical study in the universities. Thus in the great body of reg- 
ulations for the Austrian universities, including not only Austria proper, 
but all those in the Empire, we find that the first year of study out of 
the four occupied by the university course in law is occupied almost 
entirely with the study of the history of the law. In these universities 
the student must attend lectures or similar exercises for at least twenty 
hours a week. Of these there are given to the history of the German 
law, public and private, four or five hours a week during the entire year. 
To that of the Roman law (which there, as in most European countries, 
is regarded as a part of their own and is carried on simultaneously) 
eight hours a week are given in the first or winter half of the year, 
while the pandects or course in the doctrine of that law begin with the 
second or summer semester and occupy twelve hours a week. No stu- 
dent is allowed to go on in the third year of the course without passing 
satisfactorily a careful examination on these subjects. Private stu- 
dents not of the regular university course, who are admitted under some 
circumstances, must in all cases pass an examination upon the history 
of law before they are admitted to take the other courses. Substan- 
tially the same regulations prevail in the other universities of Germany, 
‘and in most European countries. - ‘ 
It should be observed here that the history of law as there taught is 
in the strictest sense a scientific account of the development of legal 
doctrines. It is totally a different thing from the study of mere anti- 
guarian law. Nothing shows more clearly the lack of correct notions 
on the subject in this country than the assumption, often made, that to 
read Blackstone or Coke or any other writer who describes the law of 
a past period is to study the law historically. Such writers may fur- 
nish valuable material for that study; but a statement of what the law 
was at any period, however far in the past, is not history. 
Perhaps many American tawyers and teachers will doubt the feasi- 
bility of applying these European examples of method to the common 
law, and even ‘consider the proposal to do so the dream of an idealist or 
of one to whom the law is merely a theory and not practical. It may 
be well, therefore, to ask here in what shape this application is to be 
made.

LEGAL EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES. 399 
The distinction between English and continental law in respect to 
authority recognized has been that these generalizations have been 
taken on the continent from the writings of eminent jurists whose opin- 
ions as to what the law was on a given subject have been the only au- 
thority recognized in the schools, and the leading one in courts of jus- 
tice, while in England the only statement of the same to which the 
courts would listen have been those contained in the opinions of judges 
uttered while deciding cases. Originally the difference was very great, 
for these opinions were oral and the reports of them (asin the year 
books) mere notes to aid the remembrance of the sages who sat in the 
exchequer chamber or who took part with them in the discussion as. 
sergeants, and seem often to have had as much influence on the formu- 
lation of the law as the judges themselves. The concentration of all 
these in a single body, as well as their mode of discussion, aided mate- 
rially in the formation of ‘a consistent and logical body of law such as" 
every experienced lawyer could carry in his mind. The habit of pub- 
lishing reports, and still more’ the later practice of delivering written 
opinions, gradually made these assume the form of essays upon the law 
beyond the very point decided, and thus diminished the difference of 
the two methods; though this tendency was restrained on the other 
hand by the distinction made between what was said in explanation of 
that point and the mere dicta, which were as pure expressions of opin-— 
ion as those of the continental writer. In this country the separation 
of forty or fifty law-stating courts, each of which knows the others’ de- 
cisions only as legal literature, has done still more in the same diree- | 
tion, until the law common to'the American States has become almost 
as completely the product of abstract thought as that of the European 
continent. Hence the indulgence with which treatises are now quoted 
to them, while conversely the foreign tribunals are gradually adopting. 
the use of their own and similar decisions as authority, after the En- 
glish method. Both movements show the mental sameness of object 
in the two, and the necessity of both elements; that of the speculative 
generalizations to direct the reasoners from case to case, and make the 
law a harmonious system, and that of frequent reference to the separate 
points decided in the individual cases, to prevent the law from loosing 
its grasp on actual life and becoming a mere theory. There is little 
danger indeed with us of the latter mistake while our text-books are 
made up so entirely of a congeries of such points, without theory enough 
to bind them together. But it is vain to complain of this error of stu-_ 
dents if nothing is done to show them a better way. They will go on 
committing to memory each point, each rule of law as a distinct thing, 
if they are not able to comprehend their true nature. So long as the 
books used in our schools are mere collections of such points, and of 
the cases in which each pointis sustained, without a word to show how — 
one rule is connected with another, how the points owe their genesis to_ 
principles, the evil will remain. It is absurd to expect that a class of   
 
-P-A-G-E-432
    400 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91, 
beginners will strike out a scientific method for themselves in a mass 
of such “practical” rubbish, merely because we deafen them with 
praises of the logical consistency and scientific character of- the law. 
All this talk of scientific law, of principles, might be mere glittering 
generalities, if in truth the words of one judge or court in deciding a 
ease had any magic power to compel future judges and courts to decide 
in the same way—if a precedent were as sure to produce the same rul- 
ing for which it is quoted as a chemical formula to give a certain 
result. 
There is no point upon which experienced lawyers are better agreed 
than the existence of principles in the common law. Their own expe- 
rience shows them that, as soon as they have become familiar with 
practice, the distinct rules and decisions of the books change their form 
and become general conceptions, more or less definite in their minds, 
_ but from which as a basis all their reasoning proceeds. Ask any num- 
ber of good lawyers the proper method of teaching the law; there will 
be as many answers and different methods as there are individuals, 
but every one will conclude by telling you that his method is the true 
way of reaching the principles of the law. Nor is his faith in these 
principles weakened by his inability to give a definite account of them. 
One man believes that they are based on ethics or natural law, which 
has in some mysterious manner compelled the positive law to shape 
itself in a certain way, Of late years this theory has to a considerable 
extent given way to another by which the principles of the positive 
law have been formed upon social science or upon political and eco- 
nomical considerations, which have led men to consider certain courses 
of conduct as duties, certain others as wrongs; while the law has 
merely added to the conceptions thus formed their legal relation to 
each other. It is needless to enumerate the many other explanations 
given of these principles, all of which have probably some element of 
truth in them, but have never yet been so stated as to account for their 
controlling influence over legal rules. The fact is clear that in all our 
reasoning upon a new case presented to us by a client we do not start 
with the law of that case, as according to the older theories we should. 
The first step is to reduce the evidential facts which the client states 
into some of these conceptions furnished by the law, and to which the 
law gives not only a definite meaning but a definite effect; and thus to 
determine whether the client has a right which has been infringed, or 
owes a duty which he has broken, or in any way has made himself lia- 
ble to the jurisdiction of the courts, or may call upon them to vindicate 
his rights against another. It is of these general conceptions and 
terms that the common law consists and by its very nature must con- 
sist. Every rule or proposition of law must depend for its entire mean- 
_ ing upon these terms contained in it. No such proposition or rule can 
well be formulated by customs or common consent; it is only upon sin- 
gle terms and conceptions that these forces must operate. The whole
-P-A-G-E-433
LEGAL EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES. 401 
t 
community may hold a pretty clear and definite conception of contract. 
or property or crime or injury or damage or the countless other con- 
ceptions of the kind upon which our law is constructed. From these 
conceptions it may deduce a great variety of special rules; as that a 
contract must be mutual, or that it must be founded on a consideration, 
ete.; but no one of these rules can have any authority beyond what it 
derives from the fundamental conception, unless given it by a legis-. 
lator, or at all events by the action of an individual mind. Hence if 
we study our own thoughts upon legal questions carefully we shall see 
that what we take for principle is a deduction from these accepted 
terms or from their relation to each other and place in the system. 
And, further, that elementary law properly consists in a knowledge of 
these important terms and of the system which they compose. Not 
merely a definition of the term, to be repeated to the examiner asa 
form of words, but a full and living conception of it as a Jegal entity 
from which we may deduce law as we deduce the rules of any other 
science from its fundamental conception. 
How is this full and satisfactory knowledge to be obtained? It is | 
evident that there are two modes of doing it. Wemay study the origin 
and growth of these legal terms historically, as we do that of other 
words and of languages in general, or we may study them as they now 
exist in our law, comparatively in their relation to each other, assum- 
ing that as all belong to a single harmonious system the exact meaning 
of each can be deduced from its relation to all the rest. These two 
methods differ widely in their processes, but if correctly conducted 
should coincide in their results. Nothing canbe morecertainthanthat  , 
the conceptions of a contract and of a wrong independent of contract 
which have resulted from all the past thought of the race, must by the 
very laws of thinking harmonize with each other if correctly stated, 
and lead to consistent results unless there be some error in the process. 
Thus the two methods serve as a check upon each other. We can prove 
the conclusions of each by the results of the other, as we do a sum in 
arithmetic; and these results so obtained and proved will have an 
authority for us and for others far greater than that of any individual 
thinking. 
A distinction is sometimes made between elementary law and gen- 
eral jurisprudence or other similar terms. Undoubtedly no two of these 
have precisely the same meaning. By elementary law we usually un- 
derstand the terms and relations of our own system as distinet from 
those of other peoples, while general jurisprudence usually implies some 
knowledge of foreign law and a comparison of its phenomena with our — 
-own. But as a part of legal education the two differ not so much in 
kind as in extent, and, therefore, the question whether general juris- 
prudence should be placed at the beginning of the course or atter it 
relates only to that small part of it which lies outside of our own law. 
The answer, probably, will depend in each case upon the average pre-— 
ED 91——26 |   
   
-P-A-G-E-434
  402 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91 
vious education of the class. But there is another consideration of 
much more weight for placing this elementary law at the very begin- 
ning of the course. A little reflection will show that the general terms 
of which it consists are as a rule identical with the ultimate facts of 
pleading.. These facts must correspond to the evidence which will sus- 
tain them on the one hand and to the law which the judge will apply to 
them on the other. The syllogistic nature of pleading has often been 
pointed out; it is only the statement in other form of the fact that every 
allegation must be a term of fixed meaning, and thus capable of form- 
- ing part of a proposition of law. Hence the value of exercises in plead- 
ing and especially in code pleading where there are no authoritative 
~ forms, throughout the course. Hence also these will continue and illus- 
trate the instruction in elementary law. 
The law by its very nature deals with general terms and conceptions. 
There can be no rule for a single case or person or thing until it has 
been reduced to the class of which it may be considered a member. 
Hach individual case differs in some respects from every other. As 
Carlyle expresses it, “nothing ever happens but once in this world.” 
The law can not deal with these individuals, persons, or things, unless 
it has reduced them to classes by abstraction and generalization. 
- This is not peculiar to law, i. e., jural science, but common to it with 
all other sciences. Physics or chemistry, geology, etc., must classify 
the objects of which they treat before any scientific truth ean be stated, 
any natural law formulated, any assertion made beyond the mere fact 
of existence under certain conditions. (And these conditions can only 
be made instructive or even intelligible when stated in general terms.) ° 
Astronomy, perhaps, deals with the least number and most marked of 
individual cases; but it is no science until we can generalize its phe- 
nomena. 
The great advantage of the student of physical science is that he can 
form his generalizations by the aid of the senses, seeing, feeling, tast- 
ing the individual objects, measuring and weighing them accurately, 
to say nothing of the immense help in this process derived from the 
telescope, the microscope, and other apparatus. Those operations are 
in themselves a process of abstraction and generalization and prepare 
him for the higher generalizations that are formed by reasoning. More- 
over, he can, by repeated observations and experiments, test his knowl- 
edge at every step; he can even devise experiments to test the accuracy 
of the higher truths which he can not observe directly. 
In law and the moral sciences, man can not observe directly by the 
senses or experiment at will. His general truths must be formed by 
reflection alone and can only be tested or examined by the same 
process. All his reasoning in these sciences depends on major prem-— 
ises of his own formation, which are themselves constantly under- 
going reformation or insensible modification. Almost the only test of 
the accuracy or his generalizations that does not depend on other im-
-P-A-G-E-435
  LEGAL EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES. 403 
perfect processes of the same kind is that of consistency between them. 
If two or more rules are conflicting, two or more general terms for the 
same class of things (or for classes of which one is a subdivision of the 
other) do not harmonize, there must be an error in the formation of 
one if not both. As no human error can introduce an authoritative in- 
consistency into the unwritten or common law (as legislation may), all 
its rules and terms should be consistent and harmonious; a conflict be- 
tween them in their application to the same state of facts is proof that 
one or the other of the conflicting rules is wrongly stated and does not 
embody the true law. So, too, Blackstone’s dictum that the overruling 
of a former decision on a common-law point is not a change of law, but 
shows that such decision was never law, is a logical necessity that can 
not be rejected without abandoning the very notion of an unwritten 
law. 
The chief object of jural law being the administration of justice (and 
-incidentally at least to enable every citizen to foresee the legal conse- 
quence of his acts), the terms in which it is expressed must be so defi- 
nite that they can be applied with uniformity to individual cases, and so 
consistent that a single case can not be arbitrarily brought under two 
or more terms leading to different legal results. We can not group per- 
sons, or things, or facts arbitrarily, or as a mere matter of convenient 
expression, nor can we abstract and generalize by marks or qualities 
that will not be uniformly found in the class designated. In other 
words, the legal term must express the inherent nature of the facts des- 
ignated by it. This inherent nature is not open to observation, as in 
physics, but requires a careful study of the ordinary relation between 
facts, and especially of the relation of cause and effect. Hence, no man 
can form the terms intuitively or in advance of the facts to be denoted. 
They are not imposed by authority, but are developed from facts by 
science. 
Whatever be our theory of the nature of law, the unquestionable fact 
is that the recognized sources from which, directly or indirectly, the stu- 
dent mustlearn the law do not present itin the form of commands to do 
or not do the specified things. They do present it in the form of rights, 
duties, wrongs, and other general conceptions subordinate or auxiliary 
to these. Persons and things are divided into classes for the purpose - 
of determining what rights or duties belong to the former or have the 
latter for its objects. Actions, the third great class of such conceptions 
according to the classic jurists, are the means by which rights are vin- 
dicated, duties enforced, wrongs remedied or punished. Few statutes 
or decisions, indeed, deal with these broadest categories, but all of them 
do with their subdivisions and kinds, They show that certain things 
are property and therefore objects of ownership; certain others are not 
and therefore may be confiscated; or they lack some other quality of 
the right called property; that a married woman or an infant is or is 
not a person in the full normal sense and, therefore, may or may not 
 
-P-A-G-E-436
  404 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
form a binding contract, ete: The variety of such subordinate lessons 
is immense, and it would be tedious to show the relation in which each 
term stands .to these general conceptions. But there is no other diffi- 
culty in proving that their whole force and meaning in law depends on 
their respective relations to one or the other of them—that of persons, 
things, or actions, or the relations between persons that we call rights, 
wrongs, duties. Decisions on such points as that a river is navigable 
in law when it is so in fact, or that its navigability depends on the ebb 
and flow of the tide; that ice is property, though water is not, ete., 
have no legal force and meaning whatever, unless we connect them 
mentally or explicitly with the rights and duties that flow from naviga- 
pility or nonnayigability; with the rule that ice as property may be a 
valuable consideration for a contract, or the object of wrongful conver- 
sion or trespass—and so on. 
While the law was considered to be essentially a system of rules of 
action prescribed by a superior, the student’s first introduction to it - 
was naturally to learn by whom and how those rules were prescribed, 
in how many forms they appeared, how they were to be interpreted so 
as to fit the actions of men—in short, all that nebulous form of thought 
known as the philosophy of law. “Added to this, the thorough student 
must then properly master ethics, of which law was only an applied 
form, and so much of social science as was recognized a century or more 
ago, with political ethics or the science of government, civil liberty as 
its counterfoil—in short, all the sciences that would prepare the most 
mature mind to enter upon the task of legislation or to govern a state 
after the most approved theories. (For illustration see the well-known 
work of Prof. Hoffman, “A Course of Legal Study,” a work of real 
erudition and great merit after its kind.) 
The obedient pupil went through as much of this as he was able to 
comprehend, with some advantage to his general mental development, 
but with the least possible help toward the special work in which his 
life was to be spent. The kinds of law were soon defined as divine, 
natural, positive, written or unwritten, constitutional or statutory, etc., 
and a great mass of platitudes swallowed with an indefinite notion that 
he was learning the principles of the law he was to practice. But when 
he entered the office, or even when he passed from this introductory 
reading to the books that his teacher used in actual practice, he soon 
found that he had to deal with things and relations of which he had 
yet formed not the slightest notion. Instead of having a system of 
formulated rules which had only to be interpreted to fit the facts of his 
client’s ease, he was compelled to work painfully and almost blindly 
over these facts before he could get them in shape to suggest any rule 
whatever; and then to search through a wilderness of other cases re- 
ported in the books before he could formulate such a rule for his client 
as he could propound to the court with any prospect of its being ac- 
cepted. For this, in fact, is just what the practicing lawyer has to do 
°
-P-A-G-E-437
  LEGAL EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES. oF 
in all cases involving a question of law at all. Instead of app ing: a 
known rule, prescribed beforehand to govern it, he has to reduce its 
facts to the form of some recognized right among the endless variety 
presented by the books, and to show its violation and the damage thus 
done his client, and to state all this in technical terms that shall make 
these elements of an action visible to the court, and not to be explained 
away or defeated by his opponent. Then and only then he may begin 
to consider the exact rule by which the issues between them may be 
solved in his favor, and show its consistency with principle and other 
rules already formed in the same way and reported. Unless his case 
or his defence be a very plain one, he will be lucky, indeed, if the rule 
thus offered to the judge’s consideration, and sustained by a huge col- 
lection of authorities and arguments, is the one on which it is finally 
decided. Even if he be successful, he will find when he hears the 
judge’s opinion that he has only made a rough guess at the “law” of 
his case, and that the court having gone through not merely the two 
briefs, but a similar process of evolving law from the facts, has reached 
quite a different statement of the rule prescribed by the supreme power, 
and that it is the court’s rule and not his which has really been the law 
of the land all the time. He will learn after a while not to be disap- 
pointed at his failures to know the law exactly as the judge does, pro- 
vided he obtains a remedy for his client’s wrong; but he will be indif- 
ferent throughout to the question whether the rule that gives it be- 
longs to the natural or the positive, the written or the unwritten law, — 
or whether it fulfills the requirements of that philosophy of the law on 
which he has spent so much time. 
The other or modern view of the nature of law (jus) leads as directly 
to a natural and practical plan of elementary study as the former did 
to a wrong one. Its truth as a theory is shown by its correspondence 
with the actual facts, and this again suggests the true method of teach._ 
ing. The law regulates the relations of persons to the state (public 
law) or to each other (private law). Confining ourselves here to the 
latter for illustration, we find that its subject-matter is those relations 
between persons which are the necessary result of their dwelling 
together in a state and maintaining social and business intercourse _ 
with each other. It therefore exists before the law and is regulated, 
not created, by its rules. Its classification does not depend on rules 
prescribed, but on the nature of human actions and interests. It form- 
ulates these relations as reciprocal rights and duties. Most of its rules | 
express the natural results, of those conceptions. Rights are the form | 
of the relation where the person is entitled to enforce his own will, 
positively or negatively, upon others; duties where he must conform 
his own actions to the will of one or more other persons. It makes no — 
difference whether these result from the very nature of the act or from 
the positive law, i. ¢., from the will of the community. In other words, 
it makes no difference in practical effect whether the right or duty is
-P-A-G-E-438
  406 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
so plain that all accept it as based in the divine will or the law of 
nature, or so novel that it requires positive enactment for a court to 
enforce it. In case of doubt, the enforcement by the court is proof of 
its existence as a legal right or duty, whatever its origin. The court, 
however, do not decide this point at their own caprice, but in accord- 
ance with fixed standards of judgment. They find, not make it a legal 
right or duty. Compare the lawyer’s actual work with the theory of 
his science, and see if it is explained better on the present theory than 
on the former. Whether in litigation or mere advice his first duty is 
to examine the facts out of which the relation between the parties 
arises. Do these show aright on the one part, a duty on the other? 
The proof of either of course implies the other, if a legal relation actu- 
ally exists. If so, it is capable of expression in some of the accepted 
terms by which such relation is expressed; there is a contract between 
them, or a wrong siffered, a duty broken or neglected, resulting in 
harm to the innocent party. The pleadings express this and call for 
the remedy supposed to be due, and also state the defense. When the 
facts are. determined by trial, the court compares them with like eases 
already decided, and determines their exact legal effect as coming or 
not coming within the same principle as deduced from these. 
It may be expected that, to comply with the instructions of the as- 
sociation at its last meeting, the committee should give here a course 
of study in which the different topics of the law are arranged very 
much as we find them in most of the law school catalogues now pub- 
lished, but with such improvements as the foregoing considerations 
and our study of the subject might enable us to suggest. 
Even if this were possible, it would be a delicate task from which the 
committee might well shrink. It would involve a criticism of the text- 
books now in use, or at least a selection among them that would cer- 
tainly lead to controversy. But even if confined to the names of topics 
and leaving each teacher to select for himself a proper text-book on 
each of these it would, in our opinion, be of very little service, first, 
because on many of the topics as we should arrange them there are no 
separate text-books covering the law on that subject; and, second, be- 
cause the most important recommendation we can make is the aban- 
donment of the present method of teaching the law mainly by distinct 
topics, at least during the first year of the course, and the substitution 
for it of a careful and systematic study of the system as a whole after 
the European method. We do not disguise from ourselvesthe difficulty 
of carrying out this recommendation with the books now at command, 
and before the law has “ gone through the schools ” in Ihering’s phrase, 
that is, has been reduced by jurists and teachers to the form best adapted. 
for the instruction of a class. So far as the present books can be made 
useful in this method, we would by no means object to their use, 
Every teacher must judge for himself on this point, and the conveni- 
ence to him of a text-book as well as its popularity with students who

desire to find the law in the shape that they know will be familiar to 
the examiners, will doubtless be enough to prevent a too sudden change 
or a detriment to the interests of publishers. 
But every teacher of law who is really in earnest in his work will find 
that he can construct for himself a far better text-book than any he 
will find at the bookseller’s. Nor will it be necessary to expend for 
this purpose any large part of that wearisome labor which now goes to. 
the construction of a treatise for practicing lawyers. There will be in 
place of this a call for active thought and study on his own part; but 
it will be in the very line suggested by his daily work as instructor, 
and of immediate benefit to himself even more than his class. Let him 
begin by constructing the briefest possible outline of the topic he is 
about to teach, embracing its relations to the law as a system, a careful 
definition of all its leading terms, and a statement of its principal rules, 
so arranged as to show the connection of each with the principle from 
which it is derived. As for the matter which fills the bulk of our pres- 
ent treatises, the application of these principles and rules to varymg 
states of fact, and the mass of references to the cases decided, they will 
be mere surplusage, and surplusage vitiates in teaching law if it does 
not anywhere else. Not that cases should be excluded froni his teach- 
ing; onthe contrary, they should form the main authorities from which 
it is all derived, and the class should be constantly referred to them 
and constantly trained in their use. If an instructor finds that he can 
dispense with the manual or outline and give his students that clear 
and systematic knowledge of a topic which they need to comprehend. 
it by the use of cases alone, we have no criticism to make upon his 
method; we only think that he will find it slower and more laborious 
to himself than the construction of a proper manual, to which will, of 
course, be added in daily work a large mass of explanation and com- 
plementary teaching, such as if given alone would constitute a lecture. 
It will not be difficult for him to distinguish the matter that should 
fill these lectures from that which belongs in the manual. The latter 
should be that which every student or lawyer must know, without hay- 
ing to go to the books for it after itis once learned; the lecture should 
be intended simply to enlarge the student’s comprehension of the prin- 
ciples thus learned and to make him familiar with their application in 
actual life. But no effort should be made to impress this matter upon 
his memory as distinct from his understanding. 
The mode of studying particular topics or branches of law presup- 
poses, in our view, an accurate general knowledge of the system, both 
jn its history and in its present theory, to which objects at least half 
the course should be devoted. We believe that if this plan is carried 
out nearly all that our present courses contain of what is called 
“practical law” will be easily mastered in half the time now given it, 
and in a more scientific form; that is, one better adapted to the actual

needs of the practitioner. Thus, without adding a day to the length of 
the present course (be it two years or three), that instruction in ele- 
mentary law and in the history of our own law, which it is the first 
object of this report to recommend, will constitute a clear addition to 
the student’s acquisitions, and he will leave the law school doubly pre- 
pared for the actual work of the profession. 
The reform of legal education in England, 
[Appendia to preceding Report.] 
In England recent history discloses determined and well-directed 
efforts on the part of both branches of the legal profession to elevate 
the standard of general and technical acquirement for admission to 
practice, and to maintain the character and rank of the profession as a 
learned profession in fact, and not merely in name or conventional 
theory. 
The general subject of legal education in England appears to have 
been first systematically dealt with by the great “Society of attorneys, 
solicitors, proctors, and others, not being barristers practicing in the 
courts of law and equity of the United Kingdom,” otherwise known as 
“The Incorporated Law Society,” whose existing charters were granted 
in 1845 and 1872. 
Up to the year 1833 it would seem there were no means by which 
an articled clerk could acquire a knowledge of the law, except what he 
was able to learn in his master’s office. In that year the Incorporated 
Law Society instituted lectures in the different branches of the common 
law, equity, and conveyancing, which have been continued to the pres- 
ent time. 
Until 1836 no formal examination was required to be passed by per- 
sons seeking admission to practice as attorneys or solicitors at the ter- 
mination of their articles. In that year rules of court were made by 
the judges, under which persons applying for admission as attorneys 
were required to pass an examination before a certain number of mem- 
bers of the Council of the Law Society; and in 1837 the Master of the 
Rolls made a similar order for the examination in equity of solicitors. 
In 1843 the act of 6 and 7 Vict., Cap 73, formally empowered the 
judges to make regulations for the conduct of these examinations, and 
provided for the punishment of unqualified persons encroaching on the 
profession. 
In August, 1846, a select committee of the House of Commons, ap- 
pointed in the previous April, to inquire into the state of legal educa- 
tion, made its report, which extended over 400 folio pages. _
-P-A-G-E-441
  LEGAL EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES. 409 
This report recommended that a stringent preliminary examination 
should be required in general knowledge previous to apprenticeship, 
and that such examination should embrace, in addition to the so-called 
commercial education, a competent knowledge of, at least, Latin, geog- 
raphy, history, the elements of arithmetic and ethics, and one or more 
of the modern languages. 
In 1854, the Incorporated Law Society, with the view of carrying the 
recommendations of the parliamentary committee into effect, took steps 
toward the establishment of a preliminary examination in general knowl. 
edge. 
The Society succeeded in securing the passage of the act of 23 and 24 
Vict., Cap 127, under which an examination in general knowledge, prior 
to Seri into articles of clerkship, was expressly authorized to be 
held. 
As observed in the interesting introduction to the “Supplement to 
the Calendar and Law Directory of the Incorporated Law Society ” for 
1891, “ The Society felt that, as solicitors have to advise clients in all 
ranks of society, from the highest to the lowest, on all sorts of ques- 
tions, some of them of the most difficult and delicate nature, it was ob- 
vious that. their efficiency and usefulness would be much increased if 
their general, as well as legal, attainments were such as to command 
respect and attention. It would also be for the benefit of the public at 
large that solicitors should not only possess professional skill but also 
those advantages which science, literature, and languages are calculated 
to confer. The Society, therefore, strongly urged the establishment of 
an examination in science, literature, and the classics.” 
Up to 1860 only the final examination was required to be passed, but 
under an act of Parlianient of that year an intermediate examination 
was held, as well as the preliminary examination. ' 
In 1879 the honors examination was instituted for solicitors. 
The Solicitors’ Act of 1877 (40 and 41 Vict., Cap 25) placed the entire 
practical control of the preliminary, intermediate, and final examina- 
tions in the hands of the Incorporated Law Society, which thus acquired 
by right that which it had before enjoyed only by the favor of the 
judges. 
A few facts may be stated with regard to these several compulsory 
examinations prescribed by law for persons seeking to become solicitors. 
1, It is necessary for a candidate to pass the preliminary examination 
before he has the right to enter into articles of clerkship, unless he isa 
graduate of a university, a barrister at law, or has. successfully passed 
one of the designated examinations at certain specified universities 
which exempt from the examination, or has obtained from the Lord Chief 
Justice or the Master of the Roll a dispensing order, ( 
The subjects for preliminary examination are: | 
(1) Writing from dictation,  
-P-A-G-E-442
    410 " - EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
(2) Writing a short English composition. 
(3) a The first four rules of arithmetic, simple and compound; the 
rule of three, and decimal and vulgar fractions. 6 Algebra, up to and 
including simple equations, and the first four books of Buclid. 
(4) Geography of Europe and the history of England. 
(5) Latin, elementary. 
(6) Any two languages, to be selected by the candidate out of the 
following six: (1) Latin, (2) Greek, (3) French, (4) German, (5) Spanish, 
(6) Italian. : 
The candidate is not obliged to take up algebra or Euclid, but if he 
elects to do so, he may take up these with one of the six languages. 
The examinations are conducted by an examination committee of the 
Incorporated Law Society assisted by paid examiners, and it is neces- 
sary only to glance over the specimens of questions set for the prelimi- 
nary examinations during 189091, as published in the supplement to 
the Law Society’s calendar, above referred to, to perceive that the can- 
- didate who successfully passes such an examination must be a person 
of good education and very considerable acquirements. 
If the committee are satisfied as to the proficiency and fitness of a 
candidate at a preliminary examination, they certify the fact to the Coun- 
cil of the Law Society in the form of a report of the result of such 
examination, and the Council may thereupon resolve that a certificate, 
“signed by the president of the Society, shall be delivered to the can- 
didate. After this certificate has been obtained, articles can be en- 
tered into at any time. A solicitor can not have more than two articled 
clerks at the same time. This is for the purpose, apparently, of limit- 
ing the number of solicitors. 
2. After an articled clerk has served half the time of service required 
under his articles, he must undergo the intermediate examination in 
such elementary works as may be selected by the Council of the Law 
Society. One of the standard works for many years has been Stephen’s 
Commentaries on the Law of England. 
Four intermediate examinations are held in each year, one in each of 
the months of January, April, June, and November, in the hall of the | 
Law Society. If a candidate fails to pass an intermediate examination” 
within twelve months after his half term of service, his final examina- 
tion is postponed for a fixed period. 
8. The next step is to pass the final examination to which articled 
- clerks are subject, in the following topics: 
(1) The principles of the law of real and personal property, and con- 
veyancing. 
(2) The principles of law and procedure in matters usually determined. 
or administered in the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice. 
(3) The principles of law and procedure in the Queen’s Bench Divi- 
sion of the High Court of Justice; the law and practice of bankruptcy.
-P-A-G-E-443
  LEGAL EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES. 411 
(4) The law and practice of probate and divorce; the law and prac- 
tive of admiralty; criminal law and practice; proceedings before jus- 
tices of the peace. 
4. The subjects for the honors examination are the same, only the 
questions are more difficult. 
Three courses of lectures on common law, equity, and conveyancing 
are delivered annually at the Society’s hall, in London; and, in connec- 
tion with these lectures, classes are conducted and examinations held 
under the superintendence of the instructors. 
It is stated that the example set by the body of wolicingy of estab- 
lishing an efficient system of examination and lectures led to the adop- 
tion of like measures by the four great Inns of Courts, “the noblest 
nurseries of humanity and liberty in the kingdom.” 
The committee has received from England copies of the consolidated 
regulations of the several Societies of Lincoln’s Inn, the Middle Tem- 
ple, the Inner Temple and Gray’s Inn, as to the admission, education, 
and examination of students, the calling of students to the bar, and 
the taking out of certificates to practice under the bar, for 1892, and 
other documents showing the courses of study and examinations pre- 
scribed by the Council of Legal Education of the Inns of Courts, which 
may be printed with this report for the information of the association. 
The council of legal education consists of twenty benchers, five from 
each inn of court, and to this body is intrusted the power and duty of 
superintending the education and examination of students for the pur- 
pose of being called to the bar, or of practicing under the bar. 
The general rule is that persons seeking to be admitted as students 
in an inn of court must, before such admission, satisfactorily pass an 
examination in the following subjects: (a) The English language; (b) 
the Latin language; (¢) English history. 
No student can be called to the bar unless he shall, to the satisfac- 
tion of the council of legal education, have passed a public examina- 
tion for the purpose of ascertaining his fitness to be called to the bar. 
An examination in Roman law, and in prescribed heads of the English 
law, is obligatory for call to the bar; but the council may accept as an 
equivalent for examination in Roman law: (a) A degree granted by a 
university for which the qualifying examination included Roman law; 
(b) a certificate that any student has passed any such examination, 
though he may not have taken the degree for which such examination 
qualifies him; and (¢) the testamur of the public examiners for the de- 
gree of civil law at Oxford that the student has passed the necessary 
examination for the degree of bachelor of civil law: Provided, That the - 
Council is satisfied that the student, before he obtained his degree, or 
obtained such certificate or testamur, passed a sufficient examination in 
Roman law. 
The general subjects for instruction and examination, under the di- 
rection of the council of legal education, are:  
-P-A-G-E-444
    412 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
1. Roman law and jurisprudence, and international law, public and 
private. 
2. Constitutional law and legal history. 
3. English law and equity: 
(a) Law of persons: Marriage and divorce; infancy; lunacy; corpora- 
tions. 
(b) The law of real and personal property and conveyancing: Trusts, 
mortgages, administration of assets on death, on dissolution of part- 
nerships, on winding up of companies, and in bankruptcy; practical in- 
struction in the preparation of deeds, wills, and contracts. 
(c) Law of obligations: Contracts; torts; allied subjects (implied or 
quasi-contracts, estoppel, ete.); Commercial law, with especial refer- 
ence to mercantile documents in daily use, which should be shown and 
explained. 
(d) Civil procedure, including evidence. 
(e) Criminallaw and procedure. Examinations for calltothe bar are by 
written papers, and by such viva voce questions as the examiners may 
think desirable. 
‘The council may grant certificates of honor to such persons as may be 
reported worthy of the same by the examiners. 
A student who, previously to his admission at an Inn of Courts, was 
a solicitor in practice for not less than five years (and has ceased to be 
a solicitor before his admission as a student), may be examined for call 
to the bar, without keeping any term, and may be called to the bar upon 
passing the public examination, without keeping any term. 2 
The educational advancement of the lower branch of the legal pro- 
fession in England, among other causes, will no doubt sooner or later 
lead to the abolition of the distinction of rank between solicitors and 
barristers-at-law; but whether such a change will be a gain to the pro- 
fession and the public, time alone will show. 
One great safeguard of the profession in England is the fact that it 
has not ceased to be, or to be regarded as, a learned profession, and 
has not become a mere business occupation, which may be taken up by 
almost everybody as a livelihood upon the most imperfect preparation 
for its duties and responsibilities. 
The profession stands apart from ordinary business, with a spirit 
sensitively alive to whatever concerns the honor and best interests of 
its members, and it is thus measurably protected against the encroach- 
ment of unworthy and incompetent persons, while it is accorded by the 
public a degree of respect and consideration which renders membership 
in it a sensible and gratifying distinction. 
The discipline of the more numerous branch of the legal profession 
_in England is regulated and maintained under provisions of statutes 
carefully framed with a view to the interest not only of the profession 
itself, but also of the public at large as deeply concerned in the con- 
duct of legal practitioners, 
   
-P-A-G-E-445
  LEGAL EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES. - 413 
Stipulations for the sale by the client, either wholly or partially, of his. 
interest in any action, or for the payment only in the event of success, 
are wholly void. 
The solicitor’s remuneration act of 1881 provides for the eompensa- 
tion of solicitors in conveyancing and other non-contentious business 
according to the general principle of fixed ad valorem percentages, so 
as to get rid of detailed bills of costs for this class of work. 
The rates are established by a general order of the Lord Chancellor, 
the Lord Chief Justice of England, the Master of the Rolls, the President 
of the Incorporated Law Society, and the president of one or more of 
the provincial law socicties, or associations, and the regulations and 
provisions proposed to be embodied in any general order on the subject 
of remuneration are communicated to the council of the incorporated 
law society, who are at liberty to submit observations and suggestions 
in respect thereto. 
Overcharging, as well as undercharging, in such business is fe 
rendered impossible. 
The Solicitor’s Act of 1888 provides for the custody of the roll of solici- 
tors of the supreme court in England by the Incorporated Law Society, 
and carefully regulates the subject of striking solicitors off the roll. 
An application to strike a solicitor off the rolls, or an application to 
require him to answer allegations in an affidavit, is referred by the 
master of the rolls to a committee of not less than three nor more than 
seven members of the society, who, after hearing the case, are required 
to embody their finding in the form of a report to the high court of 
justice. 
If the committee are of opinion that there is no prima facie case of 
misconduct against the solicitor, the society need not take any further 
proceedings; but if the peteniitan are of opinion that there is a prima 
facie case, it is the duty of the society to bring before the court the report 
of the committee, which has the same effect, and is treated in the same 
manner, as a report of a master of court, and the court may make ua 
order thereon as it sees fit. 
The Incorporated Law Society is thus constituted by law not only a 
faithful leader, but the watchful guardian of the honor and the best in- 
terests of the legal profession.

  The number of students who had, previous to their engaging in the study of law, 
obtained a degree in letters or science, either from a college or some other institution 
conferring literary or scientific degree, is unknown. Many colleges take no record 
of such facts; others again may be apprehensive that invidious distinctions may be 
drawn against themselves, if the facts in their case be known. Under these con- 
ditions there is but one method: to follow, that is, to take the total number of stu- 
dents in the schools that report the fact in question and to compare that total with 
the total number of students reported as having previously obtained a bachelor de- 
gree in arts or science. This has been the method followed by the specialist who 
“has prepared the chapter on professional schools in the Annual Report of the Bureau 
* of Education, when preparing the diagrams illustrating the increase of attendanco 
at the various professional institutions in Germany, France, and particularly in the 
United States. Adopting this method of procedure then, it appears that the—

To put the matter briefly, 15 in every 100 students in 26 schools had obtained a 
degree in some institution not giving professional instruction, or, more technically 
expressed, had obtained a degree in letters or science. 
The length of the course is two years. Of 54 schools reporting 40 have a two 
years’ course, 7 have a course of 1 year which in several instances may be spread

over two, 27 schools have a three years’ course. Of the 40 schools with two years’ 
courses, several permit the student to take it in one year, and 7 scliools, on the con- 
trary, offer a post-graduate course. In Washington, D. C., this is called a “post- LEGAL EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES. 433 
graduate course in practice.” Yale Law School has an undergraduate course of two 
years and a post-graduate course also of two, but one (the last) of which need not 
be taken.

LEGAL EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES. © 489 
Iv. THE LAW MATRICULATE EXAMINATION IN NEW YORK! 
[Generally known as the ‘Law Students’ Examination.”] 
In New York the legislature early? conferred upon the trustees of the 
colleges or universities having departments of law the power of grant- 
ing degrees in law and otherwise regulating the admission to and the 
course of study of their law departments. Nor was the degree when 
obtained a mere empty honor; for, when it was a testimonial that the 
holder had, in addition to passing an examination successfully, spent 
eighteen months in the study of law, it admitted him to the bar. This 
right, however, was withdrawn in 1882. After that date the State re- 
sumed the exercise of the power to inquire into the professional quali- 
fications of applicants for admission to its bar, and it is the purpose 
here briefly to relate the manner in which the State has also taken 
upon itself the duty of systematically testing the literary qualifications 
of persons who are applicants for admission to its schools of law, or 
who are elsewhere pursuing the study of jurisprudence. 
Before entering upon this topic, however, it is but justice to call 
attention to the action of Columbia College in 1876, touching the liter- 
ary attainments of its matriculates in law. The annual announcement 
of thatinstitution for 1874~'75 contained the usual information that any 
person of good moral character, whether a college graduate or not, 
might be admitted to either class of the law department, for “no ex- 
amination and no particular course of previous study were required for 
admission.” But this was not all the catalogue told its readers on this 
point. On and after the first Wednesday in October, 1876, the requi- 
sites for admission were to be considerably advanced. All college grad- 
uates, it is true, were then to be admitted without examination, but 
other candidates for matriculation were to be at least eighteen years 
of age and “must have received a good academic education, including 
such a knowledge of Latin as is required for admission to the fresh- 
man class of the college, viz, 4 books of De Bello Gallico, 6 books of 
the Aineid, and 6 orations of Cicero.” To insure that the candidate 
had had this amount of instruction, three examiners, alumni of the 
college appointed by the law faculty, were to examine him in the 
history of Greece, Rome, England, and America, English grammar, 
rhetoric, and composition and in Latin. This action of Columbia is 
noteworthy; for it required fifteen years for the State to become con- 
vinced of the necessity of the reform thus inaugurated in New York in 
1876 by a private corporation at its own pecuniary risk. The college 
accomplished it at a bound, as it were; the State worked up to it. 
In 1871 it became the duty of the judges of the court of appeals of 
New York‘ to establish such rules and regulations as they might deem

proper in relation to the admission of persons applying to be admitted as 
attorneys, solicitors, and counselors in the courts of the State. Among 
the rules established by the court in pursuance of this act! was one re- 
quiring that all persons not holding the diploma of a law college of the 
State? should be examined by the court or by a board composed of three 
or more practicing lawyers of the State, of seven years’ standing at the 
bar, appointed by it. But in 1882, “in response to a general demand,” 
the court adopted a rule which brought the regents of the University 
of New York (a method of State control rather than a university) into 
direct connection with the law departments of the higher institutions 
of learning of the State. By this rule it was ordered that before any 
person, not a graduate of a college, could enter upon “a clerkship” 
(reading in an office of a practicing attorney) or upon a substituted 
course of study (as at a law school), or within three months after entry 
upon such a course, he must pass a regents’ examination in arithmetic, 
grammar, geography, orthography, English and American history, and 
‘English composition, and file a certificate of the fact signed by the see- 
retary of the board of regents and countersigned by the examiner. 
In the circular issued by the regents in regard to ‘Examinations on 
subjects preparatory to the study of the law as required by the rules of 
the court of appeals,” it is stated that special examinations for law 
students only would be held in each judicial department. As the sub- 
jects required by the rules of the court were also a part of the system 
of academic examination held at stated times during the year, the in- 
tending law student was allowed to enterthem. ‘To insure success the 
candidate was advised to master a “ standard school text-book” on each 
subject required. To pass he must answer correctly 75 per cent of the 
questions “in all subjects” and spell correctly 85 out of 100 words con- 
tained in the papers placed before him, and finally “must make and 
subscribe” to a declaration printed on each sheet of questions to the 
effect that he had no previous knowledge of the questions on the paper, 
that he had answered them without aid from any source, and had spent 
no more time than that marked by himself in answering them. To 
those successfully passing in all the subjects the Regents gave a spe- 
cial certificate, known as the law student’s certificate, made in dupli- 
cate one copy of which was retained by the clerk of the court of appeals 
and the other sent by that functionary to the candidate. 
It is impossible to say at this date what purpose the court of appeals 
had when permitting a grace of three months to the law student in 
filing his regent’s certificate. Yet it might seem probable (barring the 
case of men of middle age) that it was introduced not for the purpose 
of allowing him the necessary time to prepare himself in the studies 
required by the rule—his time being fully occupied by the study of law— 
but rather to allow him to enter upon his “clerkship” at any time, irre- 
spective of the time of the regent’s examination. At one school at least 
1Appended Laws, 1871, p. 2194 (vol. 2.) 
*Albany University and Columbia College law departments,  
-P-A-G-E-473
LEGAL EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES. 441 
no previous course of study was required nor was an examination held 
as to the qualification of a matriculate, he being informed that he had 
three months in which he could comply with the rule of the court. In- 
deed, the probability that the months of grace were intended as months 
of marble work—an unfortunate combination of the studies of the gram- 
mar school and Biackstone’s lectures to university men—is almost made 
a certainty when we find that the new rule of the court of appeals 
adopted March 19, 1891, lengthens the time of grace from three months 
to twelve, the additional nine months being allowed to enable the 
student to get up the “first-year Latin” required. To this rule, how- 
ever, we must now turn. 
In the rule of 1882 the court had demanded a good grammar-school, 
education; in the rule of 1891, it asks, in addition, for a “first-year 
Latin,” geometry, and civics. The Latin required is meager, by no 
means to be called academic, and is such as is taught in preparing the 
student to read Cesar. In geometry, ‘plane geometry” is completed, 
and in civies “daily work for half a school year is allowed.” Ifa stu- 
dent has completed a full year’s course at a college under the super- 
vision or the regents of the University of New York, or in an extra 
State college recognized by it as having a satisfactory standard, or if 
he has completed a three years’ course in any institution subject to the 
visitation of the regents or recognized by it, or if he has a regents 
diploma, or a regent’s pass card for any 22 counts, of which 4 are for a 
foreign language, 7 for mathematics, and 7 for the historic groups, or 
has a pass card for any 30 academic counts—that student may offer 
them as “substantial substitutes” for the matters required by the new 
rule of the court of appeals. 
Other changes appear. The regents send the certificate to the suc- 
cessful candidate, who forwards it to the clerk of the court of appeals 
at Albany, who files it and returns a duplicate. If the student, after 
finishing a subject, fails to make and subscribe to the somewhat modi- 
fied form of declaration of honesty, the set of answers for that subject 
is thrown out. 
Vv. LEGAL EDUCATION IN THE COMMON SCHOOLS. 
Specific legal instruction is not offered in the public schools, yet the 
course of study in “civics” or civil government has such a relation to 
the subject as to justify the insertion here of the following matter from 
the Report of the Commissioner of Education for 1888-89, pp. 384- 
387:* 
“ Civil gov: cerca is a separate branch of instruction in twenty-two 
of the eighty-two cities that reported; its principles are taught in many 
more—nearly all, perhaps—incidentally, in connection with history, 
geography, or, like science and general history, as a part of the supple- 
mentary reading. The object of such instruction is declared to be 
better preparation for the duties of citizenship. In its usual applica- 
*Prepared by Mr. J. C. Boykin.  
-P-A-G-E-474
    442 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
tion the subject embraces only the nature and forms of government, and 
the provisions of the Constitution of the United States, and that of the 
pupil’s own State; but the study may be, and sometimes is, so broad- 
ened that it not only covers the elements of political science, but also 
trenches upon the domain of ethics. Several excellent text-books have 
been prepared, but they are not extensively used except as books of 
reference, the instruction being chiefly oral, frequently in accordance 
with a general plan or a syllabus prepared by the superintendent. 
One of the best of these syllabuses is that which appears in the man- 
ual of the course of instruction in the grammar department of the Phila- 
delphia public schools.! The instruction in that city is given in one year 
only, the eighth, and follows the topical method throughout. No text- 
book is used, but each pupil has constant access to the Declaration of 
Independence, the Constitution of the United States, and the articles 
of the State constitution. = 
“Appended to the syllabus, in addition to the usual instructions re- 
lating to the teaching of the subject, are (1) a list of special terms of 
frequent occurrence, (2) a list of eminent men connected with the 
history of the Constitution, (3) a chronological table relating to the 
adoption of the amendments, (4) a table of parallelism between the 
Constitution and the Articles of Confederation, and (5) a list of books 
of reference recommended. for the use of the teachers of the subject. 
In the last list appear: Andrew’s Manual of the Constitution of the 
United States, Stern’s Constitutional History and Political Development 
of the United States, Miss Dawes’s How We Are Governed, Alton’s 
Among the Law-makers, Fiske’s American Political Ideas, Scott’s De- 
velopment of Constitutional Liberty in the English Colonies of America, 
Frothingham’s Rise of the Republic of the United States, Greene’s His- 
torical View of the American Revolution, Curtis’s History of the Con- 
stitution, Bancroft’s, Hildreth’s and Schouler’s histories of the United 
States, and Story’s Commentaries on the Constitution. 
“The use of a syllabus of this kind by an intelligent teacher willing 
to follow the suggestions that accompany it must result in such effec- 
tive teaching that text-book instruction would seem dull and insipid 
by contrast. What good office could a formal text-book perform for a 
teacher familiar with all the literature named? 
“Mr. R. W.Stephenson, in his report for 1887-88, as superintendent of 
public instruction of Columbus, Ohio, very thoroughly discussed the 
importance of training for citizenship, laying particular stress upon 
the cultivation of the virtues of obedience to rightful authority, integ- 
' rity, industry, and patriotism. He would have instruction also in 
the forms and methods of government, but he believes that the pos- 
session of the virtues named is more necessary to the citizen than a 
mere knowledge of any particular system of laws. He therefore urges 
that the teachers aim particularly at the inculcation of these desirable 
qualities in order that their pupils may be the better as citizens.   
 
-P-A-G-E-475
  LEGAL EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES. = 448 
“Tn regard to this view, it may be said that the instruction recom: 
mended is only what is commonly called “ moral training,” with a special ; 
and rather limited application, ¢. ¢., the good of the State. 
“There is no difference of opinion in regard to the duty of the school to 
foster and cultivate all the virtues, but there is a difference of practice 
in regard to the incorporation of such training with the study of polit- 
ical science. The latter, as it is generally taught, aims merely at giving 
the pupil a knowledge of the manner in which the country is governed, 
how its officers are chosen, and what relation he himself bears to the 
conduct of public affairs. 
“The cultivation of patriotism is, of course, an end in whose accom- 
plishment the study of our government is expected to aid, but that 
moral training which leads to habits of obedience and industry and 
integrity of character is presupposed. The moral man will be moral in 
the exercise of his privileges and in the discharge of his duties as a 
citizen; therefore, in most courses we find that general morality is con-, 
stantly inculcated, but that no special attention is paid to political . 
morality as separate from morality in all other walks of life. 
“As to the time for beginning, we find that in Denver, Washington, 
Detroit, East Saginaw, Minneapolis, Camden, Brooklyn, Milwaukee, 
and Philadelphia, only the pupils of the eighth-year class are permitted 
to pursue the study. In San Franciseo, Cal., Atchison, Kans., Lynn, 
Mass., and Salt Lake City, Utah, two years are given to the subject. 
In Quincy, Ill, West Des Moines, Iowa, Baltimore, Md., Lawrence, 
Mass., and Jersey City, N. J., three years. In Wichita, Kans., and 
New Orleans, La., four years. : 
“The time per week varies from a half hour in San Francisco, New 
Orleans, and Baltimore, to 34 hours in Detroit and 34 hours in Mil- 
waukee. As arule, the time per week is short where the number of 
weeks is great and vice versa, so that the total time given to the subject 
is remarkably uniform 
“The main points of the syllabus used in Philadelphia are as follows: 
NATURE AND FORMS OF GOVERNMENT. 
I. Government: What is meant by the term; social nature of man; necessity of 
civil government; what is meant by the constitution of a nation; what a 
law is.

  CHAPTER XIV. 
LEGAL EDUCATION IN EUROPE! 
In response to a circular letter, a copy of which is here inserted, a 
great amount of information, both in writing and in print, has been _ 
received relating to legal education in the following countries: England 
and her colonies, France, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Portugal, 
Italy, Russia, Denmark, Norway and Sweden. Copies of the circular 
letter in English and French were sent to the ministers of public educa- 
tion or instruction in the countries referred to. In many instances the 
letter was by the ministers referred to the faculties of law of the universi- 
ties, the deans or librarians of which confined their reply to sending 
printed catalogues and regulations. Very few entered into a minute 
reply to the questions submitted, so that it becomes necessary to con- 
fine this summary statement concerning legal education abroad to a 
few essential points. Jor the sake of convenience the matter is grouped 
under the following heads: 
Requirements for Admission to the Study of Law in Europe. 
Statistics of European Law Schools, 1890-1891, showing number of professors and 
students, and proportion of those who fail. Names and location of law schools. 
Expenses of students. 
Proportion of law students to population.

Sources of jurisprudence in Europe. 
Courses of study in law. 
Methods of instruction. To this is added a list of questions used in Cambridge 
and in the inns of court, London, England.

Il REQUIREMENTS FOR ADMISSION TO THE STUDY OF LAW IN 
EUROPE, 
Admission to the bar in all continental countries is obtained through 
the universities which are professional schools for the four learned pro- 
fessions—theology, medicine, law, and philosophy. In England and 
America the colleges and universities are chiefly schools for general 
culture; only a few offer provision for thorgugh professional studies. 
While in England and America the erroneous idea is still predominant 
that a collegiate education need not necessarily precede professional 
study, in continental Hurope it is made a conditio sine qua non. Each 
continental university is divided into faculties (law, theology, medi- 
cine, philosophy), though not everyone has all the four faculties. 
A few have only two faculties (law and theology, or medicine and law). 
To become a lawyer a young man must have graduated in jurispru- 
dence at a university. No bar examination is held, but the degree 
admits him to the bar unless he aspires to a Government position in 
either the judicial or the executive branch; in that case the candidate 
has to pass through rigorous state examinations,

450 EDUCATION REPORT, 1590-91. 
The requisites for admission to the university are substantially the 
same in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. In Franee and Italy 
they are not quite so extensive, but may still be considered to be a 
collegiate or classical education, In Spain,-Belgium, Holland, Den- 
mark, Sweden, Norway, and Russia, this preparatory education is 
similar, embracing the classical languages, the higher mathematics, 
natural science, and history, geography, and history of the world. 
In some countries this secondary education is more thorough than in 
others, but essentially it is the same in all countries. 
In England secondary education has never become public education. 
From six to twelve years of age the boy attends an elementary school 
(either a board or a church school, both of which are aided by public 
grants), An examination determines the close of the elementary 
period. He then enters one of the numerous undefined and unelassi- 
fied secondary or preparatory schools, or (if his means allow him) one 
of the so-called public schools (Eton, Harrow, ete.), or studies at home 
under a tutor. It is quite immaterial to the authorities, how or where 
he obtains his preparation. An examination determines his fitness for 
admission to the study of law. The followimg rule is in force in the 
inns of court: 
“ Admission of students: Every person, not otherwise disqualified, 
who shall have passed a public examination at any university within 
the British dominions, or for a commission in the Army or Navy, or for 
the Indian civil service, or for the consular service, or, for cadetship 
in the three Eastern colopies (Ceylon, Hongkong, and the Straits 
Settlements) shall be entitled to be admitted asa student without pass- 
ing a preliminary examination. Every other person applying to be 
admitted as a student shall, before such admission, have satisfactorily 
passed an examination in the following subjects: The English lan- 
guage, the Latin language and English history. Such examination 
shall be conducted by a joint board, to be appointed by the four inns 
of court.” 
In France the preparatory course of a law student is as follows: 
The primary school coneludes its.course with the pupil’s twelfth year 
of age, but most of those who intend to pass through seeondary schools 
enter special preparatory elementary schools, and at the age of ten 
years enter a lyceum, the course of which is usually completed at the 
close of the eighteenth year of age. Graduation from a lyceum entitles 
to edinission into the University of France, that is, into any of the 
numerous “facultés” or parts of the great university that embraces 
the academic and professional instruction of entire France. An outline 
of @ course of study pursued in lyceums in France is here inserted to 
show the requirements of admission to the study of law, a study which 
lasts from three and a half to four years.

In Germany and Austria the boy, after completing his elementary 
education, enters a gymnasium (classical secondary school), a typical 
course of which is-here submitted in outline: 
(QQ) Religion.—Biblical history of the Old, and especially the New Testament; eat- 
    
 
-P-A-G-E-484
  ~ 452 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
cehism, with Bible verses [and quotations from tradition], serving as evidence; the 
movable festivals of the church; memorizing of favorite selected hymns; acquaint- 
ance with important contents of the holy Scriptures, especially the New Testament, 
of which leading chapters are to be read in the original text; acquaintance, also, 
with the undisputed facts concerning the origin of the different books of the Bible; 
main points of religious ethics and the creed; knowledge of the chief epochs of 
church history and its distinguished representatives [notably the lives of the great 
saints]. 
(2) German.—Knowledge of the most important rules of etymology and syntax;

works of modern literature, poetry, and prose; memorizing of selected ballads and 
memory gems; acquaintance with the forms of poetry and prose; correct use of 
written language for the purpose of expressing one’s own thoughts, and in composing 
essays on subjects lying within the student’s own compass of thought and experi- 
ence; simple rhetorical practice and oral discussion of themes after due preparation 
. in writing. 
(8) Laiin.—Facility in the application of etymology and syntax; acquisition of a 
vocabulary sufficient for the comprehension of the writings of the classic period (as 
far as their contents are not specifically technical), and for the pursuit of professional 
studies, as well as sufficient for the acquisition of modern languages derived from 
Latin; reading of selected number of noted works of classical literature suitable to 
the degree of proficiency of the students. This reading, going hand in hand with 
grammatical analysis, should lead both to comprehension of the contents and appre- 
ciation of the form. Skill in writing Latin within the limits of expressions learned 
by reading. Compositions should be made with some degree of ease and without 
coarse inaccuracies. 
(4) Greek.—Facility in the Attic etymology and acquaintance with that of the 
epic dialect; knowledge of the fundamental rules of syntax; acquisition of a suffi-

its influence upon the development of the various modern literatures. 
(5) French.—Facility in French etymology and the fundamental rules of syntax; 
acquirement of a vocabulary which will enable the students to understand French 
books of not too difficult a style, and ability to speak and write French within 
eertain limits. No coarse inaccuracies should occur in this. 
(6) Hebrew (an optional study).—Instruction in Hebrew is offered in the two 
highest grades only. Its aim is: Elements of etymology; reading of easy selec- 
tions from the Old Testament. 
English is omitted. 
7. Arithmetic and mathematics.—Facility in operating with denominate numbers 
and business rules, Application of arithmetic in every-day occurrences of practical 
life. Arithmetic up to the development of the binomial theorem, and algebra to 
equations of the second degree (inclusive). Plane and solid geometry, plane trigo- 
nometry. In all these branches attention is to be paid not only to knowledge resting 
ona firm basis of thorough comprehension, but also at skill in its application. 
(8) History.—_Knowledge of great events in the history of the world which caused 
epochs; biographies of leading personages in them, chiefly from the Greek, Roman, 
and German history. Knowledge of important dates, and thorough acquaintance 
with the seats of historical occurrences.

gatory for all grades. 
(14) Vocal music.—Songs of four parts. Theory of music. Students of the upper 
grades are excused from this. 
In Switzerland the secondary schools are similar to those of Germany 
and France. They are called cantonal schools, being usually located 
in the center of a canton and maintained by the cantonal government. 
Tn order to see how rigorously the universities guard their doors 
from intruders not properly qualified to take up professional studies, 
the conditions of admission to the University of Geneva are quoted 
here: 
(1) Students are matriculated without examination for admission, if 
they have obtained a diploma of graduation from the classic or modern 
section of the Geneva gymnasium. (2) The bachelors of letters of the 
University of Geneva are also admitted without examination. (3) All 
those who show by diploma or certificate that they have gone through 
a course of study equivalent to 1 and 2, either in Swiss or other classi- 
eal schools. (4) Nonmatriculated students, so-called auditors or spe- 
cial students may be admitted to lectures on special subjects, provided 
they have reached the required age, but they can not graduate nor par- 
ticipate in the official benefits arising from university study. 
In Italy secondary education is offered in the “Ginnasi” and 
“Licci.” The course of study in the ginnasi and licei extends through 
eight years; the first five in the ginnasio, then three in the liceo. The 
gymnasial studies are Italian, Latin, Greek, arithmetic, history, and 
geography, and the elements of instruction in Roman and Greek arch- 
exology. The studies of the liceo tend toward a higher development, 
for they cover philosophy, mathematics, physics and elements of chem- 
istry, Italian, Roman, and Greek literature, history and geography, 
and natural history. Drawing and modern languages are optional 
branches. Gymnastics are obligatory if the student desires to be ad- 
mitted to the examinations. The “licenza ginnasiale,” or graduation 
diploma from the ginnasio, is required for a number of employments 
under government. The “licenza liceale,” or graduation diploma from 
the “liceo” is required for admission to the university. 
In Belgium, Holland, Denmark, Norway and Sweden, as well as in 
Spain, Hungary, the Balkan Principalities, and Russia, secondary 
schools, called variously lyceums, gymnasiums, classical schools, or
-P-A-G-E-486
    454 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
preparatory schools prepare for the university, which in all these coun- 
tries are professional schools or higher seats of learning. Belgium and. 
Spain follow the example of France and Italy, while Holland, Denmark, 
Norway and Sweden follow that of Germany, in their reyuirements for 
admission to the university. There certainly are differences in the 
various courses of study of secondary schools, one country laying more 
stress upon modern languages, another upon ancient languages, but 
essentially they offer a collegiate education (Latin and sometimes 
Greek, or modern languages, the mother tongue and its literature, 
arithmetic, and mathematics, natural science and history, geography 
and history of the world, drawing, music, and gymnastics). 
The secondary schools that lead up to the universities or professional 
schools offer no degrees (except in France and Switzerland), such as B. 
A., for in continental Europe the degree of doctor is acquired in the 
university only (L. L. D., Djur., M. D., Ph. D.)

Proportion of law students who fail in examination. 
In Austria.—In 1889-90 (latest report available) 1,854 senior students 
of law submitted to the “rigorosa,” or examination for graduation. Of 
these 1,854 students 89.5 per cent, or 1,659 passed; 195, or 10.5 per cent, 
failed. 
This refers to all the cight universities of Austria, without Hungary. 
The examination for lawyers intending to enter state service, either in 
the judicial or the executive branch of the government comprised three 
groups: (a) Candidates of history of law; (b) candidates of jurispru- 
dence, and (¢) candidates for administrative offices. Group (a) had 1,204 
candidates, of which 194, or 16.1 per cent failed; group (0) had 661 
candidates, of which 112, or 16.9 per cent failed; group (¢) had 593 
candidates, of which 54, or 9.1 per cent failed. 
In Hungary.—In. 1889-90 (latest report) 1,074 law students were ex- 
amined, of whom 857 passed, while 217, or 20,2 per cent failed,
-P-A-G-E-487
  
LEGAL EDUCATION IN EUROPE. =D 
In Germany.—No official data are published, but according to Prof. 
Lexis 13 per cent of the enrolled students fail to finish the course, 9 per 
cent of those who finish the course fail in examination, 12 per cent of 
the graduates fail in the first state examination, and, according to 
Judge I’. Werner, 18 per cent fail in the second state examination. 
This refers to the Kingdom of Prussia only. No statisties are avail- 
able for the entire empire. 
In France.—tIn 1888 (latest report) 1,696 students of law, at the close 
of the third year’s study, submitted to the final examination, which 
admits to the practice of law; 371, or 21.8 per cent failed. The num- 
ber of students who devoted an additional year to the study ef law, 
and at the close of it submitted to the examination for the degree of 
“doctor juris” was 823, of whom 234, or 28.4 per cent failed. 
In Italy.—in 1889 (according to “Statistica dell Istruzione Second. 
6 Superiore” of 1889) 1,113 law students passed out of a total number 
of students, 5,465, the meahes of candidates for graduation not being 
stated. The number 1,113 includes candidates for three different di- 
plomas, to wit: 987 (of 992) received the, diploma of jurisprudence, 81 
received the diploma of proctrator, 65 received the notary’s diploma. 
Now, if 987 of 992 candidates for the diploma of jurisprudence passed, 
only 5, or less than 1 per cent, failed. This is so exceptional a state- 
ment, and so much at variance with the figures found in other countries, 
. thatitis here repeated only after some hesitation and upon the authority 
of the “ Direzione Generale della Statistica.” 
In Norway (according to the “Universitets-og Skole- es ” of 1889) 
the proportion of law students who failed in 1888 was 2.4 per cent (2 out 
of 82, five of whom had previously attempted the examination and 
barely passed it; that is, without credit), This indicates that the stu- 
dents have very careful individual treatment during the course, or that 
they are not admitted to the examination, unless the faculty is reason- 
ably sure that they can pass it. 
In Russia the graduate of a university is called Cqondidahe: ” This 
is the lowest degree conferred. But students who fail to complete the. 
prescribed course ‘or fail in examination are termed “real students.” 
The proportion of candidates of law to the total number of senior sta-— 
dents was only 50 to 52 per cent during the years 1863~77. This does 
not include the three non-Russian universities—Dorpat (German), War- 
saw (Polish), and Helsingfors (Finland.) 
From other countries no reliable data concerning the number of fail- 
ures are obtainable. :

Expenses of law students in Europe. 
Information on this subject is very meager except from France, 
where the fees for tuition and other fees are as follows : 
(1) Students who acquire only a “Certificate of Capacity” pay for 4 
inscriptions (at $6),$24; 4 library fees (at 50 cents), $2; 1 examination 
fee, $12; 1 certificate of capacity, $8; 1 certified copy of certificate, $5; 
total, $51. ‘ 
(2) Students who acquire the degree of “ Bachelor of letters” pay for 
8 inscriptions (at $6), $48; 8 library fees (at 50 cents), $4; 4 examina- 
tion fees (at $12), $48; 4 certificates (at $6), $24; 1 diploma, $20; total, 
$144. 
(3) Students who acquire the degree of “Licentiate” pay for 4 in- 
scriptions (at $6), $24; 4 library fees (at 50 cents), $2; 2 examinations 
(at $12), $24; 2 certificates (at $6), $12; 1 diploma, $20; total, $82.

(at $12), $36; 3 certificates (at $6), $18; 1 thesis, $8; 1 certificate for 
thesis, $6; diploma, $20; total, $114. 
Duplicates of certificates and diplomas cost half the original cost. 
Adding these sums we find the total expenses of a doctor of law to 
be for four years, $391, or about $400. 
In Germany: The following table is interesting as showing the average 
annual cost of one student at each of the chief universities of the King- 
dom of Prussia, and the amount contributed toward this cost by the

In German universitiestke students pay 20 to 25 marks ($5 or $6) 
for one series of lectures per semester, which amounts to about $120 a 
year for annual lecture fees. Besides this they must pay various small 
fees, aggregating to the sum of $5. No reliable information is available 
at present concerning the student’s personal expenses, board, ete. In- 
stitutions in which the students live and study together, so-called stu- 
dents’ halls or colleges, are nowhere found on the continent, while in 
England they seem to be a necessary adjunct of a university. 
In Austria the student pays 1 florin (= 35.7 cents) per weekly lecture 
(or about 26 florins =. $9.28 per semester), which will amount to about 
$140 a year for the entire course; besides this a few trifling fees are to 
be paid. Student halls do not exist in Austria. é 
In Hungary the law academies charge 30 florins, or $11.70, per year 
for each branch of the course, which would, if the student takes the 
entire course, amount to $117 for ten studies: Roman law, canonical 
law, civil law,-criminal law, administrative law, international law, po- 
litical economy, and history and philosophy of law. Minor fees, such 
as matriculation and examination fees are not included in the foregoing. 
In Italy the entire expenses of a law student for matriculation, in- 
struction, examinations, and diploma, amount to 860 lires, or $172 for 
the entire course. 
In Belgium the annual fees for lectures are 550 francs, or $50, but 
the student has to pay 100 francs, or $20, for each examination to which 
he is admitted; diploma not included. 
In Denmark: All lectures and exercises in the university of Copen- 
hagen (the only one in Denmark) are gratuitous, neither are fees col- 
lected for matriculation and examination. The state bears all except 
the personal expenses of the student,

In Sweden: The lectures and exercises are gratuitous, but fees are 
collected (a) for matriculation, $3; (b) for examinations, each between 
$2 and $3.75; (¢) for diplomas, 75 cents. 
In Portugal: The official returns from Portugal fail to state this item. 
In Russia: Rector Bunge of Kiew University, instituted an inquiry 
during the year 1872 into the expenses, personal and otherwise, of the 
students, and found that the minimum expense was 375 roubles per 
year (or about $225 at the present value of the rouble, which is much 
lower than it was in 1872). The details were: Lodging, 80 roubles; din- 
ners, 72 roubles; tea, sugar, and bread for breakfast and luncheon, 48 
roubles; clothing, 66 roubles; lecture fees, 40 roubles; books and mis- 
eellaneous, 45.roubles; light and washing, 24 roubles. Of the 355 stu- 
dents who replied to the inquiry, 14 lived with their parents and had 
ample means, 36 were supported with means and victuals from home, 
and 56 gave private lessons earning from 251 to 300 roubles a year. 
Forty-three per cent of the students had the benefit of scholarships or, 
were excused from paying for lectures and fees. 
It is impossible to give more information under this head with regard 
to other countries without special or additional inquiries which want 
of time will not permit. .    
IV.—PROPORTION OF LAW STUDENTS TO POPULATION.

Oekonomie und Statistik,” Dritte, Folge, Erster Band, pp. 376-394,

Omitting the students of theology, Prof. Conrad classifies the Euro- 
pean couniries according to the number of students of the other three 
faculties as follows: 
In every 100,000 inhabitants Belgium has the greatest number of uni- 
versity students, to wit, 82-3; Norway, has 76.6; Sweden, 56.3; Austria, 
53.9; Italy, 51.3; Switzerland, 50,4 (50.4 male and 5.2 female); Germany, 
48.1; Holland, 45.4; France, 42.6; Russia, 9.9. : 
In explanation of the phenominal ratio found in Belgium it must be 
stated that many restrictions to admission to Belgian universities 
have been removed, the conditions of admission now being the. easiest 
known anywhere,

    460 “EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
The authority quoted above lays particular stress upon the fact that 
the duration of the course in law is shorter in Prussia than in other 
countries, to wit, about 7.17 semesters, or 3.58 years; but it must be 
remembered that the average age of students of law when entering 
upon their professional or university studies is 20 years, hence that 
they rarely graduate before theirtwenty-fourth year of age. 
The following comparison is interesting: In Prussia the students of 
theology study on an average 3.93 years, those of law 3.58 years, those 
of medicine 6.10 years, those of philosophy 5.30 years. The normal—that 
is, prescribed—course is, for theology, 3.5 years (12 per cent of the stu- 
dents went beyond it); for law, 3.5 years (7.49 per cent went beyond it) ; 
for medicine, 5 years (8.27 per cent went beyond it); for philosophy, 4 
years (22.55 per cent went beyond it). 
It is to be regretted that other countries do not report these details. 
Only Sweden and Norway do so. Students of law have to pass an 
average of 1.38 years in Upsala and 1.52 years in Lund in preliminary 
or preparatory studies, and 4.08 years in Upsala and 3.33 years in 
Lund in professional studies, or a total of 5.5 years in Upsala and 4.8 
years in Lund. In Norway the students of law are obliged to attend 
the lectures of the philosophical course for one year (in Belgium two 
years) before they can begin their law studies, which last 4 years. In 
Holland the average course of law studies is 4.05 years; in Austria it 
is required to be 4 years. 
At present (1891-92) Austria stands at the head of the list in number 
of law students. Compare this list:

From this it is seen that in Austria about twice as many university 
students study law as in Germany, to wit, 43.9 per cent of the total 
attendance of the three faculties (in 1878 it was 54.4 per cent). No 
other country comes near this percentage. But if we consider the 
causes, the fact is easily explained. AIl who seek a general culture in 
Austrian universities, and not merely a professional preparation, such 
as the members of the aristocracy and plutocracy, literary men, and 
tutors of wealthy boys, etc., attend the law faculty, while in Germany 
they attend the philosophical faculty,

Tn connection with this discussion it is well to consider the following 
statement: Prof. W. Lexis, of Gottingen, has in his recent book! un- 
dertaken to show the discrepancy between the number of students of 
law, respectively graduates of law, and the number needed to fill the 
positions offered by the central government, by provincial and com- 
munal authorities, corporations, ete. Altogether, he says, the annual 
demand for lawyers in the service of justice is 162; in other state and 
imperial service, 100; in provincial and communal service, 20; as inde- 
pendent attorneys and notaries, 180, and in the service of corporations 
and in other business positions, 10; together 472, or, to use a round 
number, 475. Now, supposing that the average time for legal studies 
in the university is 34 years, that 25 per cent should be added to the 
number in demand to include failures in examinations, we have a normal 
number of 2,080 to meet the annual demand for lawyers in Prussia. 
But notice that in 1880-81 the Prussian universities had 3,103; in 
    1881-82, 3,112; in 1882-83, 2,992; in 1883-84, 2,713; in 1884-85, 2,501; 
in 1885-86, 2,411; in 1886-87, 2,503; in 1887-88, 2,722; im 1888-89, 
2,821; in 1889-90, 2,923; in 1890-91, 3,090. 
In 1881-82 the number had reached its maximum, and decreased 
slowly until the year 1885-86. From that year until 1890 the number 
again increased rapidly, and nearly reached the maximum of 1881. 
Now, if the normal number needed to meet the demand is considered, 
as stated, too low by about 100 or 200, there is still a surplus of many 
hundreds who will never find remunerative positions as judges or 
prosecutors, but must wait from 6 to 15 years and work as assistants 
in courts and administrative offices without any remuneration whatever. 
Vv. ENTERING THE PROFESSION AND GRADES OF LAWYERS. 
In England: The consolidated regulations of the several societies 
of Lincoln’s, the Middle Temple, the Inner Temple, and Gray’s Inn 
now in force contain the following rules concerning the mode of enter- 
ing the profession of law:

tion in any of the subjects mentioned in Rule 43, other than common 
law and equity— 
1. A degree granted by any university within the British dominions 
for which the qualifying examination was in law; 
2, A eertificate that any student has passed any such examination, 
though he may not have taken the degree for which such examination 
qualified him; and 
3. The testamur of the public examiners for the degree of civil law at 
Oxford that the student has passed the necessary examination for the 
degree of bachelor of civil law;

  464 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
Provided the council is satisfied that the student, before he obtained 
his degree, or obtained such certificate or testamur, passed a sufficient 
examination in such subject or subjects. ; 
Rue 46. There shall be four examinations in every year, one of 
which shall be held in sufficient time before each term to enable the 
requisite certificates to be granted by the council before the first day 
of such term. The days of examination shall be fixed by the commit- 
tee, and at two of such examinations, viz, at those to be held next before 
Hilary and Trinity terms, there shall be an examination for student- 
ships. 
Rue 47. As an encouragement to students to study jurisprudence 
and Roman civil law, twelve studentships of 100 guineas each shall be

to any student as to whom not more tlian four terms shall have elapsed 
sinceht kept his firstterm, and another class to continue for one year only 
and to be openfor competition to any studentnot then already entitled to 
a studentship, as to whom not less than four and not more than eight 
terms shall have elapsed since he kept his first term; two of each class of 
studentships to be awarded by the council on the recommendation of the 
committee, after every examination, before Hilary and Trinity terms, 
respectively, to the two students of each set of competitors who shall 
have passed the best examination in both jurisprudence and Roman 
civil law. But the committee shall not be obliged to recommend any 
studentship to be awarded if the result of the examination be such as, 
in their opinion, not to justify such recommendation. Where any can- 
didates appear to be equal, or nearly equal, in merit, the council may, 
if they think fit, divide the studentship between them equally, or in 
such proportions as they consider just. Where in any year a student- 
ship in either class is not awarded by reason of the candidates not 
appearing to deserve it, the council may, if they think fit, appropriate 
it or a portion of it for that year to the other class, or may offer it for 
competition in some other subject. 
Rue 48. Each inn of court shall bear the expense of the student- 
ships awarded to its own students. 2

studentships shall take rank in seniority over all other students who 
shall be called on the same day. 
Rue 55. All students shall be bound by variations as may from | 
time to time be made in these regulations. é 
In France: Here, as everywhere on the continent of Europe, the 
profession of law is entered through the common vestibule of all the 
four professions—the university; but less time is spent in theoretical 
study than in Germany. Two grades of lawyers are found in France— 
“avoué” and “avocat.” The avoué is a very inferior kind of legal 
functionary who is not permitted to plead, and usually acts in subal- 
tern positions or in small villages without courts of justice, but may 
prepare briefs. He holds a “certificate of capacity,” obtained, after 
two years’ study of law, by passing an examination conducted by the 
faculty under supervision of the State. The university grants a de- 
gree of “bachelor of law” when an examination for that purpose is 
passed. After three years of study in law a “diploma of licentiate of 
law” is granted after a rigid examination. This degree admits to the 
profession. If a student takes up an additional course and spends 
another (the fourth) year in the study of law, he may acquire the 
degree of “doctor of law.” Though this degree is not required for the 
practice of law, it is most desirable for ambitious young men who 
expect to enter positions in the higher service of the state. The posi- 
tion df a French notary is not easily defined. He seems to be a combi- 
nation of a banker, a justice of the peace, a real-estate agent, a con- 
veyancer, an official copyist, and family friend.   
In Germany: A law student who passes his first or graduation 
examination, after three and a half years’ study in the university (itis 
immaterial whether he acquires a degree or not, the degree being merely 
an academic honor) is thereby entitled to enter the “service of prac- 
tical preparation,” his work in the university being considered theoret- 
ical preparation. This service in the practice of law lasts three years 
and is required of all lawyers, whether intending to enter the public 
service or not. Of this period one year is spent in the service of pub- 
lic administration, either governmental, provincial, or communal, one 
year and a half in subordinate service in lower courts, and half a year 
in the office of a lawyer who is admitted to the higher courts. \ 
This three years’ practical unremunerative service is required of all 
legal students; that is, of private practitioners and of all who intend to 
become judges, prosecutors, or attorneys, and also of all who intend to 
ED 91 30   
 
-P-A-G-E-498
  466 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
enter the higher administrative and finance service. At the expira- 
tion of three years’ practical preparation a second examination in law 
is to be passed (neither after nor before the expiration of that time) by 
all who wish to enter the public service. This second examination, 
which is entirely in writing, embraces common civil law, commercial 
law, exchange, bankruptcy law, civil procedure, criminal law and pro- 
cedure, state and administrative law, ecclesiastical law, police law, 
political economy, and science of finance. This examination is a req- 
uisite for the appointment as judge, notary, clerk of court, practice of 
attorney in higher courts, or the appointment to higher administrative 
office. Applicants for a position as notary must spend two years in 
practical work in a notary’s office. Attorneys when having passed the 
second examination are eligible for judgeships. 
The entire institution of legal studies and professional preparation is 
regulated by the governments of the various states which constitute 
the Empire. One distinction is to be made, however. The second ex- 
amination referred to, which opens the way to remunerative service, is 
not dependent upon any academic degree acquired. The degree of 
“doctor juris” is conferred in the university by the faculty alone; pri- 
vate institutions for legal studies non est. Compare subsequent state- 
ments concerning Austria and Norway; also preceding statement con- 
cerning France. 
The foregoing statements have reference to the conditions existing 
in all the German states. In Prussia the law students who have passed 
their first examination and spent three years in practical preparation 
- are called “‘Referendars.” After they have passed their second exam- 
ination and entered the state service they are called “ Assessors,” but 
act without pay as clerks of court, assistant prosecutors, and assistant 
judges. It may be six, eight, or ten years before they receive a deti- 
nite appomtment. Not until that is made can the young lawyer éxpect 
any remuneration. 
A distinetion between attorneys and barristers is not made in Ger- 
many. The functions of lawyers are essentially the same as in America, 
In Austria: Admission to the practice of law, provided it is in 
relation to the publie service, is dependent upon a certain number of 
years of study in a university law faculty or in a faculty of science and 
organization of government. The close of this period is -marked by 
passing three theoretical state examinations, to wit: In history of law, 
jurisprudence, and science of government. 
Students who do not intend to enter the public service, nor aspire 
for a degree, are still subject to the rules of study, according to which 
no lawyer is admitted to practice unless he can prove to have attended 
the law faculty for four years and has a diploma of graduation. The 
above-mentioned examination in history of law takes place at the close 
of the second year of study, and all law students, whether preparing 
for the public service or not, are subject to it.      
 
-P-A-G-E-499
  LEGAL EDUCATION IN EUROPE. 467 
The subjects embraced by the examination in history of law are (1) 
Roman law; (2) ecclesiastical law; (3) German law; (4) history of Aus- 
tria (of the formation of the Hmpire and the development of public 
law). 
The subjects embraced by the examination in jurisprudence and 
science of government are (1) Austrian private law; (2) Austrian com- 
mercial law and law of exchange; (3) Austrian civil procedure; (4) 
Austrian civil law and procedure; (5) Austrian constitutional law; (6) 
Austrian administrative law; (7) political economy and industrial 
policy; (8) science of finance, with special regard’ to Austrian finance 
legislation. 
An application to this second examination is not permissible unless 
the student has successfully passed the first examination, 
All students of law are obliged to attend one lecture course in mental 
philosophy previous to the first examination, and a course of lectures 
on philosophy of law and comparative statistics after having passed 
the first examination. 
Formerly the degree of doctor juris made the bearer eligible to 
positions in the public service, but the law of 1891 relegates the degree 
to a mere academic honor and prescribes the aforementioned examina- 
tion for doctors juris also. 
. Distinetions in regard to grades of lawyers, such as solicitor and 
attor ney, or avoué and avocat, are not made in Austria. 
In Italy: The state exercises supervision over the pr okedaaa 
preparation of lawyers through the university, rectors and professors 
as the state’s representatives with regard to the quantity of matter to 
be learned (see course of study), just as it does with reference to the 
medical students. The university authorities, in their capacity of 
servants of the state, control the conferring of academic degrees which 
are essential for the purpose of entering the profession. The official 
returns say but little on the subject of examinations outside of ex- 
aminations for degrees, but we gather enough from them to state that 
the graduates of the law faculties must submit to a state examination 
in order to be able to enter the public service. This service may bein 
the executive or judicial branches of the Government. This provision 
is set aside only where particular technical knowledge or rare skill in 
some specialty is required. Women are admitted to the study of law 
and to the degrees, but are prohibited from the practice of law. 
A distinction in the grades of lawyers is made between “ attorneys,” 
“procurators,” and “notaries.” Attorneys or “avocati” must pass an 
examination to be admitted to higher courts; procurators do not plead 
in higher courts. 
in Belgium: The official returns state that it is necessary for the 
student, for the purpose of entering the profession as attorney, to have 
passed through the university and have acquired the degree of doctor 
of law. Moreover, his name must be inscribed on the official list of 
 
-P-A-G-E-500
  468 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
attorneys in a court of justice, which can not be done without evidence 
of attendance at the university, such as is prescribed, certified to by 
the faculty. Hence the graduate’s admission to the bar is solely de- 
pendent upon his professional preparation in the university. Women 
are not prohibited from acquiring the academic degree; but that degree 
does not admit them to the practice of law. 
To become a justice of peace it is not necessary to have the degree 
of doctor of law. This degree is, however, requisite for positions of 
judges of courts “of the first instance” and higher courts and other 
offices in the judiciary branch of the government. 
In the Netherlands: The same conditions prevail which are found 
in Belgium, except that a special state examination must be passed 
after two years’ practical work subsequent to graduation ‘from the 
university. 
In Norway: When a law student has completed his studies in the 
university he presents himself at one of the law examinations held by 
the faculty. These examinations take place twice a year, and at 
each eleven subjects (ten theoretical and one practical) are sub- 
mitted to be worked out in writing within three, five, or ten hours, 
according to the nature of the subject (the whole under surveil- 
lance). This is followed by a severe oral examination. If the exami- 
nation is passed the degree “candidatus juris” is conferred upon him. 
A subsequent examination is required for‘the degree of “doctor juris.” 
Passing these examinations gives access to the most important offices 
in the legal profession, particulary the judgeships, which are always 
filled by appointment, never by popular election. Attorneys and bar- 
risters are also appointed in the supreme cour3. The state recognizes 
no lawyer who has not acquired his professional education in the uni- 
versities, but most young lawyers serve as assistants in a lawyer’s office 
for the purpose of gaining practical experience. This apprenticeship 
is passed partly during the four years of university study or after 
having acquired a degree. 
In Denmark: Essentially the same conditions are found that pre- 
vail in Norway. According to a regulation of September 26, 1890, 
the requirements of the state examination for the grade of advocate 
(or lawyer) are less stringent than formerly; but they still prescribe a 
full course of law studies in the university. Judges of higher courts 
must be doctors of law. 
In Sweden: The distinction between attorneys and barristers (ad- 
vocate” and “avoué”) does not exist. .For the purpose of pleading 
in court it is necessary to have attended a university, but not to have 
obtained a degree as in Norway, or a “certificate” as in France, but 
the state guards its offices, both in the administrative and judiciary 
branches, by requiring the candidates to pass state examinations, par- 
ticulars of which are not at hand. 
In Portugal: The degree of bachelor of law obtained in the Uni-
-P-A-G-E-501

versity Coimbra (the only university in Portugal) admits to the 
practice of law. No‘distinctions are made in the grades of lawyers. 
In the competition for higher positions in the royal public service the 
holders of the. degree have the preference. : 
In Hungary: The candidate of law must give proof of having at- 
tended the law course in one of the three universities, or in any of the 
law academies of Hungary (or Austria), and have passed (a) the grad- 
uation examination, (b) the state examination, from which he is excused 
in case he has acquired the degree of doctor of law. This degree admits 
to the profession, hence the degree is not a mere academic honor. Only 
those who enter the public service are subjected to a state examina- 
tion. The graduation examination, which entitles to a certificate of 
capacity, must be passed before the candidate is admitted to the degree 
examination. After having gone through the theoretical work of the 
university the candidate is called “aspirant advocat” and must pass 
three years in a lower court and in the office of a lawyer of good stant- 
ing before he is recognized by the authorities as a lawyer. During 
this time his name is recorded on the roll of lawyers in the “chamber 
of lawyers,” and he performs minor duties which initiate him into the 
routine of legal work There is only one grade of lawyers in Hungary. 
Notaries must have spent their three years’ practical work in a notary’s 
office. Women may study law in the universities, but they are debarred 
from the legal profession. 
From Russia no information concerning the requirements for admis- 
sion to the profession (other than is. found in the syllabus on pp. 
118-125) is available. 
VI. SOURCES OF JURISPRUDENCE IN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. 
The remarks under this head are inserted as an introduction to the 
courses of study in law for the purpose of enabling the reader to se 
why certain subjects are treated more fully in Europe than would seem 
justified in this country; and, again, why others are treated lightly 
upon which our law schools bestow much attention and great care. 
Roman law is the most prolific source of jurisprudence in Europe. 
It saturates both the science of law and the everyday practice of the 
common people. Inall the many countries that were once subject to 
Roman rule, Roman customs and laws remained, to a certain limited 
extent, the basis of legal practice long after the fall of the Western 
Empire. But in Germanic countries (Germany, England, and the 
three northern countries) Germanic custom and tribal laws predomi- 
nated until, in the twelfth century, through the efforts of the Uni- 
versity of Bologna, then a famous law school and still one of the fore- 
most seats of learning of Italy, Roman law was introduced as a science 
in Germanic countries. After the revival of letters, and subsequently 
during the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries, the sei-   
 
-P-A-G-E-502
  A470 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
ence of Roman Jaw was superinduced, as it were, into the modern 
science of law. The discovery of Gaius’s Commentaries (in 1816) has 
had no small share in the esteem in which Roman law is held-at pres- 
ent in Europe. 
England occupies an exceptional position in regard to law. The old- 
est law there is based upon Anglo-Saxon laws (sixth to eleventh cen- 
turies), Later, Norman rule brought Norman customs and laws, 
slightly tainted with Roman law, through French channels. In its 
further development law in Great Britain remained custom law (com- 
mon law), the law consisting of judges’ decisions or precedents. Roman 
Jaw also found an introduction into England especially through Vaca- 
rius, who had studied in Bologna, but it never attained the importance 
it found in countries of the former Roman Empire. 
All the continental countries had been more or less subjected to the 
sway of the Roman Empire for centuries, while in England the Romans 
did not leave a deep impress upon laws and customs of the people. 
When in continental Europe, after a period of great unrest and chaos 
(during the great migration that lasted nearly 200 years), the former 
Roman “municipia” or cities formed the nuclei of law and order, it 
was but natural that the basis of their newly constructed jurisprudence 
should be the well-known Roman law, especially since it had been 
codified more systematically than any other law. 
The Teutonic or Germanic tribes (the Franks in France, the Longo- 
bards or Lombards, Vandals, and Goths in Italy and Spain, the Saxons 
in England, and a host.of others in Germany and the northern penin- 
sulas) had their ancient tribal customs which gradually developed, 
during succeeding centuries, into native custom law, of which the 
feudal Jaw! was the most important. It was often difficult to har- 
monize feudal law that reigned supreme in the castles and possessions 
of chiefs, lords, and petty princes, with Roman law, modified and 
adapted to existing circumstances in the cities (the so-called free cities), 
hence the frequent contests between princes and cities. 
‘When the Church of Rome came to be recognized as the successor 
of Imperial Rome, its law, that is, the canonical or ecclesiastical law as- 
sumed importance over all of Europe, except in Russia, which, during the 
middle ages, was not considered part of Europe. This law referred 
chiefly to marriage and parental relations, church property, etc. In 
Russia the canonical law of the Greek Church was adopted later. 
Side by side with the ancient custom law, feudal law, Roman Jaw, 
and canonical law, another source of jurisprudence became prominent 
as monarchism developed strength, 7. é., the laws of princes. In France, 
for instance, the ordinances of the Merovingians, Carolingians, Capets, 
Valois, and Bourbons became national laws when all the provincial 
  
1Law of knight-service. The ‘“nervus rerum,” money or its equivalent, has al- 
ways been the most prolific source of litigation, hence the feudal law relating to 
possessions in land and servitude formed the greater part of the law practice.
-P-A-G-E-503

parliaments adopted them. In’ Germany some tribal laws had been 
codified soon dfter the great migration (500-600 A. D.). They referred 
to certain important points of law, for instance, the Salian law (regu- 
lating the succession of princes). 
Hence we see several sources of jurisprudence in continental Europe: 
Custom law, Roman law, feudal law, canonical law, and law of princes. 
From all of these arose (when the nations began to centralize) in each 
country a national law, peculiar to itself, 4. ¢., a French, a German, an 
Italian, a Spanish, etc., law. These laws were in a few instances codi- 
fied (as for instance in 1328 and 1375 the “ Saxon and Suabian Mirrors ” 
in Germany, in 1530 the “ Carolina” or criminal code of Charles V), 
but in most cases they remained uncollected until the eighteenth and 
nineteenth centuries. France, after the-year 1789, began the codifica- 
tion (Napoleow’s Five Codes of “ Droit Fran¢ais”). During the middle 
ages southern or Roman France followed Roman law (the written law) 
while northern or Frankish France followed custom law. But Roman 
law became predominant during the sixteenth century, and France was 
temporarily the acknowledged center for the study of Roman law, 
especially the university of Montpellier. 
‘Phe early centralization of France made a pce ation of legal eus- 
toms possible, while in disjointed Germany such an effort has not sue- 
ceeded to the present day. Germany at present enjoys uniform codes 
of commercial and criminal law, but has no uniform code of civil law 
as yet. Each petty state has its own code of civil law.. The same 
holds good for Italy where a uniform criminal code was not adopted 
until 1890. In Spain and Italy canonical law assumed more importance 
than in France, Germany, and England. -In the northern countries the 
national custom laws are more distinct than on the continent, and show 
greater deviation from the Roman law, while ecclesiastical law has lost 
its significance since the time of the church reformation (1525), 
Scandinavian laws were codified very early, during the twelfth and 
thirteenth centuries, : 
In England the established church claimed and still claims attention 
of the legal profession through its legal and political prerogatives, 
hence canonical law is still a subject of study in England, while in 
America it never had any significance. The common law, this peculiar 
English growth (custom law), has its strongest roots in the struggle 
and fusion of the various nationalities that make up the present popu- 
lation, the Celts, Anglo-Saxons, Danes, and Normans. One wave of 
conquerors after another pressed upon those in possession of the land, 
and in the struggle resulting therefrom a limit was found beyond which 
the conquerors could not proceed without injury to themselves. The 
limit was not always uniform owing to the different amount of opposi- 
tion the aggressors found, and in absence of uniform codes the deci- 
sions of courts of various stages and ages were quoted and applied in 
analogous cases. Hence it is truly said “that in England and America

  472 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
the study of law concerns itself chiefly with what has been and what is 
law, while on the continent of Europe they study what law ought to 
be.”—Dayid Dudley Field. When Roman law became more and more 
the recognized standard in continental Europe, English lawyers di- 
rected their attention to it also, and at present it is studied carefully in 
English law schools. (See Appendix I.) 
The feudal law, the law of knight-service (Lehusrecht), has disap- 
peared in Europe. A few legal customs (law of succession in England), 
some technical terms in modern codes (right of fief; ete.), and rare 
allusions.to conditions during the middle ages remind us of its former 
existence, but it has lost all influence upon the formation of national — 
laws. 
We group in tabulated form the sources of jurisprudence according 
to their respective importance as follows: 
England.—(1) English common law; (2) Roman law; (8) ecclesiasti- 
eal law. 
France-—(1) Roman law; (2) provincial and national laws, resulting 
in code Napoleon and present national codes; (3) ecclesiastical law. 
Germany.—(1) Roman law; (2) Ecclesiastical law; (3) Provincial 
and national law. : 
Austria.—(1) Roman law; (2) Ecclesiastical law; (3) Provincial and 
national law. 
Spain.—(1) Eeclesiastical law; (2) Roman law; (3) National law. 
Ttaly—(1) Roman law; (2) Ecclesiastical law; (3) Provincial and 
national law. 
Switzerland.—(1) Roman law; (2) Provincial and cantonal law; (3) 
Federal law. 
Belgium.—Follows the example of France. 
Holland.—Yollows to a great extent the example of Germany. 
Denmark, Norway, Sweden.—(1) National law; (2) Roman law. 
Russia.—(1) Imperial law; (2) Ecclesiastical law (Greek Church); 
(3) Roman law. 
The foregoing may explain to some extent the courses of study of- 
fered in subsequent pages, though the exposé makes ho claims to any- 
thing like an authoritative statement. 
We summarize the exposition of the Reception of Roman Law in 
Germany from Dernburg’s “ Pandektenrecht:”—The reception of Roman 
Law in Germany as authoritative occurred in a comprehensive way 
‘after the middle of the fifteenth and in the beginning of the sixteenth 
centuries. It was then completed with an almost elemental power, 
although there was not lacking a decided opposition to it. The entire 
secret of this movement cannot be fully known, but certain important 
causes are indisputable. 
(1) One was a uatural desire for legal uniformity, which had become 
necessary for commercial intercourse. The local German laws were 
too numerous and too divergent. (2) It was an old tradition that the
-P-A-G-E-505
  LEGAL EDUCATION IN EUROPE. 473 
corpus juris civilis was the imperial law of Germany, the German em- 
perors being regarded as the successors of the Czesars. (3) The various 
influences of Renaissance were forever making for the same end. 
Hence the jurists, and all those in authority worked together to effect 
the acceptance of Roman law. (4) The universities taught only Roman 
and Canonical law. (5) The unlearned village justices who had ex- 
pounded the old traditional and customary law were not equal to the 
changed conditions. (6) The imperial authorities gave legal recogni- 
tion to Roman law and encouraged its application. 
So far as the degree or measure of the reception is concerned it may 
be said, that only that part of Roman law was accepted which did not 
contradict established German customs, and only what was found to 
be applicable to German conditions, In anarrower sense this embraced 
only those principles of the corpus juris which the glossarists, 7. e. the 
Bologna School, had supplied with commentaries. The maxim was: 
Quidquid non agnoscit glossa, nec agnosett forwn. 
  Vu. LAW COURSES IN EUROPEAN UNIVERSITIES. 
It is difficult to give equivalents in English for many of the terms 
used in the following pages, because in foreign countries that have dif 
ferent systems of law a different terminology is used in connection with 
legal education. This makes it impossible to give accurate equivalents, 
though the terms may convey to lawyers a meaning that would not be 
grasped by the general reader. :

ments, or to the Law of Nations by Sir Travers Twiss. Upon subject (6) they may 
consult Ortolan, Diplomatic de la Mer, livre deuxitme. (See Students’ Handbook 
to the University of Oxford.) . ‘ 
(The principal changes of the course since 1887 are the division of the examina- 
tion into two parts, the more searching treatment of Roman and English law by an 
increased number and more definite assignment of papers, and the fuller recogni- 
tion of original thought and literary power, in the addition of a second essay paper 
besides that already devoted to essays and problems. Moreover, general juris- 
prudence as a whole, and English constitutional law and history as a whole, will 
henceforth be standing subjects for the students of every year; their previous treat- 
ment in variable portions not having been considered satisfactory.) (See E. C.

II.—FRANCE. 
The most minute courses of study found among the sources of information at the 
disposal of the public in the National*Bureau of Education are the French. We 
quote the entire course published in the Annual Catalogue of the Université de

      IiI.—Grrmuany. 
We quote the law courses published by the universities of Berlin, Leipzig, Munich, 
and Tiibingen, representative law schools for Prussia, Saxony, Bavaria, and Wiirtem- 
burg. It is to be regretted that they are only accessible in outline form; no detailed 
course of study or syllabus, such as is given in France (see II) is published by Ger- 
man universities. Each professor announces at the beginning of the half-year’s course 
alist of subjects he proposes to treat, and the students, with the advice of the faculty, 
choose the ones they wish to hear. From semester to semester the students change 
their course and their professors, until at the completion of 3} years they present 
themselves to be examined for graduation or degree. 
Generally it is understood that the students take up encyclopedia of law, philosophy 
of law (natural law), institutes and history of Roman law, Pandects, Roman law of 
succession, and history of German law during the first year. In the second and 
following years the following subjects are studied: German private law, commercial 
law, exchange and admiralty, criminal law, constitutional and administrative law, 
ecclesiastical law, civil procedure, criminal procedure, medical jurisprudence, inter- 
national law, private law of the respective states, French-Rhenish civil law (for 
lawyers of the Rhenish Province, in which the Code Napoleon is still in force).

(c) MUNICH.—COURSE OF LAW STUDIES. 
The law course in Munich is almost identical with the foregoing, except that 
special attention is paid to the students who intend to devote themselves (in the 
service of the state or corporations) to the admin ution of mines, forests, salines, 
finances, etc. .These students are taught by a special faculty which in other uni- 
versities is part of the philosophical faculty. This special faculty is called: ; 
Faculty of State-Science.—The subjects taught are: Systems and science of govern- 
ment; history of culture and civilization during the Middle Ages; science of finance; 
national economy, its development since the decline of the Roman Empire, with

Nore.—The foregoing four courses are typical German courses. They afford the 
professors much liberty for enlarging upon favorite subjects, and the students 
chances for changing their teachers from time to time. Many students spend a year 
in one university studying Roman law, for instance, and then go, next year, to 
another university where they hear a renowned professor in criminal law, or what- 
ever subject he may treat. The foregoing four courses also show that, though Ger- 
many may be unified politically, it is not so, as yet, in law and law practice. 
IV.—Swit 
From the Swiss law courses at our disposal we select that of the University of 
Geneva, offering more minute details than other courses. The course is one of two

V.—AUSTRIA, 
  The law course in Austrian universities is attended by comparatively. more stu- 
dents than law courses in German universities. The reason is this: All students in 
Austria who aim more at general culture than at a preparation for a profession, 
such as members of the aristocracy and plutocracy, literary men, and tutors of wealthy 
boys, ete., attend the lectures of the law faculty, while in Germany such students 
are enrolled in the philosophical faculty. To all intents and purposes the courses 
of study of the law faculties in Austria are the same as in Germany. ill, it may 
be of interest to compare, with the preceding course of Berlin, the following one of 
Vienna, the leading university of Austria (exclusive of Hungary).

  VI.—Itay. 
   Law is studied in Italy as it is done in Germany and Austria. The professors an- 
nounce annually or semiannually a list of the lectures they intend to give. The 
senate of the university or the law faculty see to it that all branches of jurispru- 
dence are represented. The students choose the lectures with the advice of the pro- 
fessors and change their teachers and subjects, until at the close of a prescribed 
number of years of study they present themselves for examination for graduation or 
degree. Hence a detailed eourse or syllabus is not available. A peculiar feature 
of Italian universities is the great number of professors of law. (See chapter on 
statistics of law schools.) 
We quote the courses of law offered by the universities of Rome, Bologna, and 
Parma.

VII.—SWEDEN. 
The northern countries, Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, follow in their universi- 
ties the Gerinan method of announcing, annually or semiannually, courses of lec- 
tures, from which the students select what they deem necessary to prepare them- 
selves for the ‘final reckoning.” Detailed courses, so-called syllabi, are not avail- 
able. We quote the announcements of the Jaw faculties of the universities of Up- 
sala and Lund. The former course has been laid out by the authorities into semi- 
annual work, and is therefore deserving more than a passing glance. It affords us 
an insight into the order in which the studies are recommended to be taken up. 
This-order is not obligatory, but must be regarded as the joint advice of the faculty.

  VIII.—Rvssta. 
The Russian universities are divided into those in which the Russian language is 
spoken and Russian influence is predominant (Charkow, Kasan, Moscow, Odessa, St. 
Petersburg, and Tomsk in Siberia), and those situated in territory originally Ger- 
man, Polish, and Finnish (Dorpat, Warsaw, and Helsingfors). The Baltic provinces, 
Kurland, Livland and Estland, are chiefly inhabited by Germans, hence the Uni- 
versity of Dorpat is fashioned after the universities of Germany. It publishes its 
announcements in German, and German is the medium of instruction in many lecture 
rooms of the renowned institution. We quote from the announcement of 1891, giving 
the subjects in the order of the announcement. 
Russian civil procedure; interpretation of Russian civil law; Russian state law, 
(administrative law and science of government); history of the law in the Baltic 
provinces; controversies (discussion?) of Roman law; exegesis of sources of Roman

sian civil law; political economy; historical development of state law and theories 
of state; constitution and administration of cities and ‘rural communities in the 
Baltic provinces; general science of law; history of philosophy of law; Russian crim- 
inal law; Russian commercial law; exchange and admiralty; financial law; Roman 
law; exterior history of Roman law; institutes of Justinian. 
Through the kindness of the Imperial Russian Minister of Public Instruction we 
have received a copy of the “Regulations and requirements for the examinations 
conducted by judicial commission ” (bar examinations) which document affords us a 
view of what is being taught in all the law faculties in Russian universities. It is 
a syllabus of great value and should be carefully considered. We offer it in trans- 
lation without abbreviation.

VIII, METHODS OF INSTRUCTION IN EUROPEAN LAW SCHOOLS. 
One vital difference between the American or English college and the 
continental European university should be borne in mind. Our colleges 
(except a few like Yale, Harvard, Johns Hopkins, etc.), and the Eng- 
lish universities and colleges are schools for general culture, while on the 
continent of Europe, notably in France, Germany, Austria, Hungary, 
Italy, Switzerland, Belgium, Holland, Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, 
the universities are professional schools of theology, law, medicine, 
and philosophy (both natural and mental). Each of these departments 
has its own corps of professors, called the faculty of theology, law, ete. 
These departments are more or less closely connected, so that students 
of theology, law, and medicine may partly be also students of the fourth 
faculty, ¢. ¢., the faculty of philosophy, where the student of theclogy 
“hears” philosophy; the student of law, philosophy and. history; the 
student of medicine, natural science. “This fourth faculty is the one 
which prepares the teachers of secondary schools, hence is very ex- 
tensive. When in Germany, for instance, the law course prescribed 
does not mention philosophy, it means that this subject is not slighted, 
but that it is studied in another faculty. 
In American and English colleges and universities it is the custom 
that the student is held to a prescribed course laid down by the an- 
thorities of the institution. Optional studiesarerare. Inmany Ameri- 
can and English catalogues of law schools the books to be used are 
mentioned and the number of chapters or pages to be “learned” (which 
is not infrequently interpreted to mean memorized), In Germany it is 
left to the student to choose his subjects and his teachers. He may 
study one subject of the law course before or after another, according 
 
-P-A-G-E-528
  496 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
to his inclination. The faculty publishes a guide advising to take up 
this or that branch of study during the first, others the second year, 
and so on, but there is no compulsion. He may study civil law or 
Roman law in one university during one year, and criminal law or 
another branch in another university, perhaps being induced to the 
change by the reputation of a famous professor. 
In France a minute syllabus is arranged (see previous chapter, LH. 
France), which must be followed; likewise in Russia, and a few other 
countries. Though the mode of procedure in Germany permits great 
irregularities in the students’ attendance, it must be remembered that 
the necessity for strict guidance of the students is obviated by most 
rigidly adhering to the requirement of admission, which is, that the 
student be a graduate of a gymnasium, a classical secondary school, 
where the boys get a thorough academic preparation, acquire good 
habits, and “learn how to learn,” that is, how to find, acquire, retain, 
and apply knowledge. The average age of students entering German 
universities is 20 years; in France, 18 years. 
In America and England much text-book work, that is, much mem- 
orizing “verbatim, literatim et punctuatim,” is done, and as a conse- 
quence the work in the law schools consists to some extent in recita- 
tions (Webster: “ Rehearsal, or a repetition of something committed to 
memory”). Though much of that is found in France and Russia also, 
in German, Austrian, Italian, and other universities this method is 
looked upon with disfavor, it being claimed that it destroys spontaneity 
of effort and individuality. 
The German law professor treats his students as men of judgment 
who need not be told what to learn from the printed page. He lee- 
tures on his subject, the student taking copious notes; then a collo- 
quy follows in which a discussion of the matter just heard is held in 
parliamentary order, the professor presiding. Text-books are used as 
guides in study and as books of reference. Seminary exercises are 
held regularly every week and there is scarcely a professor in Germany 
who neglects to conduct them in connection with his lectures. (Com- 
pare the courses in previous chapter.) The seminary exercises consist 
in reviews, exegetical or explanatory conversation and criticism, dis- 
cussion and trial cases. Much stress is laid by the German and French 
law schools upon “ Eneyclopedia of Law,” which means a course of in- 
troductory lectures to the entire law course, giving definition of terms 
and a sketch of the field to be gone over so that the student may see 
his way and choose understandingly. Or, as an authority defines it: 
“The exhibition of jurisprudence as a science as an organic whole, 
showing the relationship of its facts and their proper function and 
aim,” Also the subject of “Sources of Law” in history and ancient 
documents is carefully treated. Thisis done for the purpose of strength- 
ening the knowledge acquired and the position taken in any question. 
It engenders the scholarly habit of thorough research. 
 
-P-A-G-E-529
  
LEGAL EDUCATION IN EUROPE. 497 
It may be said without apprehension of contradiction, that in 
European universities law is considered a science. It is argued that 
the teaching of law in a university is justified only upon the plea that it 
is a science, and regarding it as such the law faculties bestow much 
attention upon the historical development of law, the conditions that 
gave rise to its enactment, and thoroughly teach the encyclopedia and 
bibliography of law, besides treating cases with their students, both 
hypothetical and real cases. 
Moot courts! and practical exercises (object lessons, as it were, in 
law practice) in civil and criminal procedure are not an essential part 
of the seminary work in German, Austrian, and Swiss universities where 
the students, after having graduated, are required to pass a period of 
probation or practical work, lasting three years, so that the law course 
really lasts between six and seven years. The work in the university 
is chiefly theoretical, which fact is well illustrated by the theses or dis- 
sertations offered for the degree of doctor juris. The specimens of this 
kind of literature distributed every year are remarkable for their pro- 
found research and theoretical erudition. 
In Franee, Italy, and Belgium the students are younger than in 
Germany, Austria, and the northern countries, hence greater attention 
is paid to following the minutiz of the prescribed course. This ex- 
plains why it was possible to report an extensive syllabus from France, 
while from German universities only outlines of law courses are offered. 
But even in the universities of these Latin nations exclusive text-book . 
work and recitations are abhorred. 
In Holland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, and the Russian 
Baltic provinces the example of German universities is followed. 
In Russia proper (we quote from “Die Reform der Russischen Uni- 
versitiiten,” Leipzig, 1886) the course is prescribed minutely (see Syl- 
labus in previous chapter) and must be followed. At Kiew the course 
for the first year is as follows:

  The course is here quoted on account of the statement of time de- 
voted to the various branches. Lectures are given frequently on these 
subjects, during which much is dictated and written verbatim. The 
students take notes and write out in full what they remember. The 
papers are handed in and corrected by the professors, a work which in 
the nature of the case is done very hastily and imperfectly. Some 
synopsis or outlines of the lectures are procured frequently in litho- 
graphie form and used in place of notes taken in the class room. Text- 
book work predominates and recitations are held in which little room 
is left for individual work. The discipline is very faulty; frequently 
revo'ts of students occur, and the institution is closed for months to 
the serious interruption of the course.

him instead. What steps should B take to protect his interests? 
5. What is meant by probate in common form? What is the practical importance 
of the attestation clause? A dies intestate, leaving a widow, a stepmother, a 
brother of the half blood, a child of a deceased brother, and a grandchild (whose 
parents are dead) of a deceased sister. An administrator is appointed, but before 
distribution dies, having made a will, but omitted to appoint an executor. Who are 
entitled and in what shares to the testator’s personalty and by whom should it be 
distributed? 
6, In what respects does a demonstrative legacy differ from a general and from a 
specific legacy? A owed B £25. Subsequently by his will A bequeathed to B a 
legacy of £30 and died. Within three weeks of A’s death B claims of A’s executor 
the immediate payment of £55. Has the executor any ansyer to the claim or any 
part of it? 
7. Distinguish between a legal and an equitable chose in action and between a 
legal and an equitable assignment of a chose in action. B owed A £100, and C owed 
B £50. B writes to A ‘I assign to you the £50 C owes me.” B becomes bankrupt, 
and A then for the first time gives C notice (by letter) of the assignment. Who is 
entitled to the £50? ‘ 
8. Define a fraudulent preference. A in 1885 is unable to pay his debts as they 
become due from his own money. Several of his creditors are suing him, and one of 
them, B, obtains judgment against him for £100. A, to prevent execution, pays to B 
in full satisfaction of his judgment the sum of £50, of which one-half is lent him for 
the purpose by a friend, Within a few days of this transaction A is adjudged bank- 
rupt. B knew at the time that A was impecunious, but did not know that he was 
being sued by other creditors. Can any claim be sustained by the trustee against B 
or by B against the estate? 
9. In 1885 a man and his wife join in a promissory note for £100, the wife having 
separate estate worth £50. The note is not paid at maturity, and the payee sues the 
makers. The wife has in the meanwhile parted with her separate estate, but other 
property worth £75 has been vested in trustees for her separate use, subject to re- 
straint on anticipation; and this she is willing, if she can, to apply in satisfaction of 
her just debts. The husband has an equity of redemption worth £25. To what 
judgment is the plaintiff entitled, and by what means, if any, can he get it satisiied? 
10. A leases to B for twenty-one years a tenement house occupied by weekly ten- 
ants, the lease containing the usual covenant for repair and proviso for reéntry, as 
well as a coyenant for quiet enjoyment. B sublets to C for the residue of the term, 
less ten days. The house is not kept in repair, and in the middle of the term A 
serves.on B a notice specifying the particular breaches of covenant complained of 
and claiming compensation, and at the expiration of three weeks, during which 
nothing is done, brings an action against the tenants in occupation for possession of 
the premises, and also joins B as codefendant. All the defendants allow judgment 
to go by default, and on A’s demand the weekly tenants pay their rents to him. C 
then for the first time hears what has occurred. Advise C as to his position,

2. ‘One chief reason why, on the whole, naval usages are reasonable and humane 
is, that the belligerents were checked by the neutrals. In land wars a neutral can 
only affect proceedings to which he objects by taking part in the strife; but fromthe 
very first the belligerent maritime powers were prevented from going to the full 
lengths of predatory destructiveness by the authority of prize courts.” (Maine.)

each of the following commanders: Marlborough, Frederick the Great, Napoleon.

EXAMINATION PAPERS—WITH ANSWERS SUBJOINED TO FACIL QUESTION. 
REAL AND PERSONAL PROPERTY—PASS PAPER, 
[Answer the questions concisely.] 
Q. 1. Describe and distinguish the various kinds of conditional estates, 
A. The expression “conditional estates” is not a recognized technical legal ex- 
pression, but the words conditional and condition are used with a techinal meaning 
in the following cases: 
(1) At common law it came to be held that a gift to ono and the heirs of his body, 
and some other similar expressions, gave to the donee a fee simple conditional, the 
condition being that if he had issue he could alienate the land in fee simple, but as 
long as he had no issue he could only alienate it for his life. This law was altered as 
to freehold lands by the statute De donis conditionalibus, which enacted in effect that 
such a gift should confer an estate tail in the future. But as to copyhold lands 
in manors, where there is no custom to entail, a surrender +o the use of one and the 
heirs of his body still gives a customary fee simple conditional, with the power of 
alienation above mentioned. 
(2) At common law it was lawful to make a grant or lease upon a condition, the 
effect of which was that if the condition was broken the grantor or his heirs might 
retnter upon the land and hold it discharged from the grant or lease. The examples 
of such grants given in Littleton are: 
(a) A feofiment reserving a yearly rent with a power of retntry in case of non- 
payment of the rent (Co. Litt., sec. 325), 
(b) A feoffment to one and his heirs with a condition that if the grantor paid the 
grantee a certain sum on a certain day he might reénter upon the lands. This was 
a primitive sort of mortgage, and the grantee was called tenant in mortgage (sec. 
332). 
(c) A feoffment with a condition that if the lessee paid a certain sum to the lessor 
within a certain time he should have the fee, but otherwise only a term of years 
(sec. 349). 
(@) A feoffment on condition. that the feoffee should, by another feoffment, settle 
the land on the feoffer and his wife end children. Directions of this nature are now 
generally held to be trusts, which may be enforced by the wife and children, and not 
conditions the breach of which gives the feoffer a ht to reénter (Sec. 352). 
(e) A grant of an office of steward or the like, which necessarily implies a condi- 
tion that if the grantee do not fulfill the duties of the office he may be removed by 
the grantor (See. 378). 
(f) A grant such as to husband and wife for their joint lives, in which case the 
estate of the survivor is determined by the death of the first (See. 380). 
These last two cases are called conditions in law, because the condition is implied 
by the law from the nature of the grant. 
(3) At common law also a future estate, in the nature of a remainder, might be 
made to depend upon the happening of some condition; and so long as the event 
was undecided, it was called a contingent remainder, 
(4) In the ‘case of conditions relating to the land contained in leases for years, the 
benefit of them has becn extended to assigns of the reversion by the Stat. 32 Hen. 
VIIL., ¢, 34, 
 
-P-A-G-E-563
  
LEGAL EDUCATION IN EUROPE. 5381 
(5) With respect to conditions annexed to freehold estates, the statutes of uses 
has had the effect of enabling land to be so limited as to give the land to any person 
on the happening of such a condition, instead of restricting the benefit of it to the 
grantor or his heirs; and the law is the same for devises by will, such being called 
executory devises. 
Finally, therefore, we may divide conditional estates into— 
A. Common-law estates liable to be defeated by a common-law condition, express 
or implied. 
B. Estates limited by a grant to uses or a devise, so as to be liable to be defeated 
by a future springing or shifting use, or exeeutory devise. 
Cc. Customary conditional fees in manors where there is no custom to entail. 
In these eases the condition is said to be subsequent to the estate. 
D. The estate which may arise on the happening of a common-law condition an- 
nexed to a freehold estate. 
E. A reversion in a lease for years, in so far as it may be enlarged under a power of 
reéntry in the lease. 
F, A springing or shifting use or exeeutory devise. 
G. The interest left in the surrender or who has created a customary fee simple 
conditional, the same being called a eustomary possibility of reverter. 
In the last four eases the condition is precedent to the estate. 
Q. 2. State briefly the duties of an executor with respect to the administration of 
the testator’s estate. 
A. His duties are to pay all the testator’s debts, to pay the legacies given by the 
will, and the legacy duties (if any) payable in respect of them, to pay all the costs 
of the administration, and to hand over the ultimate residue to the residuary lega- 
tee, paying, however, the legacy duty (if any) payable in respect of the same. On 
proving the will, he will have had to pay a sum for probate duty, which covers the 
duty on legacies to children and grandchildren. The reasonable expenses of the tes- 
tator’s funeral are payable by the executor in the first instance, in priority to all 
claims of creditors. 
Q. 3. By what methods are mortgages of copyholds created, transferred, and dis- 
charged? 
A. Mortgages of copyholds are usually ereated by a deed whereby the mortgagor 
covenants, amongst other things, to surrender the copyholds to the use of the mort- 
gagee and his heirs, subjeet to a proviso making void the surrender on repayment of 
the mortgage money, with interest, at the end of six months. At the same time the 
mortgagor actually makes such a surrender, and it is duly entered on the court rolls; 
but in general the mortgagee remains unadmitted, so that no fine is payable. If it 
is desired to transfer such a mortgage to another mortgagee, two courses are open. 
Hither the mortgagor must execute a new surrender to the new mortgagee, and the 
old surrender must be vacated; or the first mortgagee must be admitted on the old 
surrender, and execute a new surrender to the new mortgagee. If a mortgage is 
discharged, and there has been no transfer of it, the surrender can be vacated by 
the steward of the manor entering satisfaction upon it, by direction of the mort- 
gagee. The same can be done if a transfer has been made in the first way above 
mentioned, But if a transfer had been made in the second way above mentioned, a 
further difficulty would occur; inasmuch as an entry of satisfaction on the last sur- 
render would leave the original mortgagee tenant upon the rolls. It would be neces- 
sary, therefore, for the ultimate mortgagee to be admitted and surrender to the 
use of the mortgagor, and then for the mortgagee to be admitted. Of course a deed 
of mortgage of copyholds includes covenants for payment of the principal and in- 
terest, and the benefit of these covenants is assigned to any transferee. (Wins. R. 
P., Pt. 4, ¢. 2.) 3 
Q. 4. Explain the different effeets of executing a contract for sale in the case of 
real estate and personal chattels, respectively. 
        
 
-P-A-G-E-564
  532 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
A. As to real estate, the effect of executing a contract for sale is that either party 
may compel the other specifically to perform it, The purchaser may compel the 
vendor to convey the property, on payment of the purchase money, and the vendor 
may compel the purchaser to pay the money, and accept a conveyance of the property. 
As to personal chattels, several distinctions arise. It may sometimes be necessary 
to inquire whether the chattels have been appropriated for the purchaser with his 
consent. If so, there has been a sale; if not, there has been only a contract to sell. 
If there has been an actual sale, and the goods are unique, such as an antique curi- 
osity, not procurable in the open market, then the case resembles a sale of land, and 
the purchaser may compel a specific delivery of the article. Indeed, the theory of 
the law is, that when a contraét for sale is duly executed and the article is appro- 
priated for the purchaser with his consent, the legal property in the article, corre- 
sponding to the legal estate in land, vests at once in the purchaser, subject to the 
vendor's lien for any purchase money remaining unpaid. In all such cases, there- 
fore, the court has a discretion to order specific delivery of the article; and the 
seller can sue for the whole price, he tendering the article on payment thereof. But 
when the article has not been appropriated for the purchaser with his consent, each 
party can only sue for such damage as he may sustain. That is to say, the vendor 
can only sue for the excess of the price agreed to by the purchaser, over the price at 
which he can sell the like goods in the market; and the purchaser can only sue for 
the excess of the price he has to pay in the market over the price at which the seller 
agreed to supply the goods. In the former case interest on the purchase money, and 
the latter case damages for delay in procuring the goods may also be claimed, and 
would ordinarily be awarded. 
Even when personal chattels are appropriated for the purchaser with his consent, 
and the vendor omits to deliver them, the court usually grants damages on the prin- 
ciple above mentioned if the goods are such as can be ara procured in the mar- 
ket. (Wms. P. P., Pt. 1, ¢.3.) 
Q. 5. haan and eee the different kinds of powers for sale. 
A. The principal instances of powers of sale are the following: 
(1) A power of sale in a mortgage. In this case the legal estate is usually vested 
in the mortgagee, and would pass to any purchaser from him without any power. 
But the power is required to destroy the mortgagor’s equity of redemption, and give 
to the purchaser the complete beneficial interest in the property. A statutory power 
of sale is now annexed to every mortgage which is made by deed; and this statu- 
tory power is, in other respects, the same in kind as an express power in the deed. 
(2) A power of sale in a settlement. Such a power is usually given to trustees, 
who take no estate whatever in the land. It is a power to appoint the legal 
in the land to a purchaser under the statute of uses, and revoke or supersede tho 
uses and trusts of the settlement with respect to the land sold. 
(3) A power to sell land to pay debts, given to executors or trustees expressly by 
a will, or impliedly by means of a charge of debts upon the land. Here again the 
donees of the power take no estate in the land, but have power on a sale to appoint 
the land to a purchaser. 
(4) The power possessed by the court to sell the land of a deceased debtor to pay 
his debts, when he has not given any person or persons the power so to do. 
(5) The power given by the settled land act to a tenant for life to sell and convey 
scttled land on payment of the purchase money to trustees or into court. Here the 
tenant for life usually has a legal estate for life, and to that extent he could convey 
the legal estate without any power; but the act authorizes him to convey the whole 
fee, so far as it is comprised in the settlement. 
Q. 6. Explain the meaning of these terms: Franchise, copyright, and tenant-right. 
A. The word franchise is used in ordinary language to indicate a right of voting; 
but in legal language it also means a privilege of the Crown, which has been granted 
   
-P-A-G-E-565
  LEGAL EDUCATION IN EUROPE. 533 
to a subject, or has been enjoyed so long that a Crown grant may be presumed. Tho 
most important franchises which are found to exist are, rights of forest and fisher- 
ies, rights to hold markets, to levy tolls, to take waifs and strays. (Smith, R. and 
P. P., 3d ed., 53.) 
Copyright is the right to multiply copies of a book, picture, or design; and the 
word has been extended to dramatic copyright, or the right to act a play, and musi- 
cal coppright, or the right to play a piece of music, All these rights are recognized 
by law. 
There are some manors, in which the custom exists to grant copyholds for lives 
only, usually three lives; with a further custom whereby on the dropping of the 
lives, the person beneficially entitled to the copyhold tenement may require a fresh 
grant for new lives, he paying a customary fine. The person paying the fine takes 
the beneficial interest in such copyholds; and the grantees named in the grant are 
held to be trustees for him, These are called tenant-right estates. (Smith, R. and 
P.P., 8d ed., 122.) . 
The word tenant-right is more usually understood to mean a right which has been 
conferred on tenants eccupying lands in Ireland, whereby as long as they pay their 
rents and perform their covenants, they can not be evicted without being paid com- 
pensation. 
Q. 7. How far is it correct to say that a man can not legally convey to himself? 
A. The common-law rule was and is that a man could not by feoffment, grant, or 
decd of assignment convey freehold or leasehold estates to himself for any interest. 
The difficulty thus presented was got over in the case of freeholds by the statute of 
uses; the effect of which wasthat a man could express to convey freeholds to a per- 
son named, as a conduit pipe, to the use of himself for any estate or interest, either 
solely or together with any other person or persons. 
A further inroad into the old rule has been made by the conveyancing act, 1881, 
which enacts, by s. 50— 
“Freehold land or athing in action may be conveyed by a person to himself 
jointly with another person, by the like means by which it might be conveyed by 
him to another person.” 
This provision still leaves it necessary to introduce a grantee to uses, whenever a 
man seized in fee desires to settle land on himself for life with remainders over. 
In the case of leaseholds, formerly, on every appointment of new trustees, when 
any one or more of the old trustees continued to act, it was necessary for the old 
trustees to assign the leaseholds to a provisional trustee on trust to reassign them to 
new set of trustees; and such reassignment was executed immediately afterwards. 
The necessity of this double avsignment was obviated by section 21 of Lord St. 
Leonards’ act, 22 and 23 Vict., c. 35, which enacts— 
“Any person shall have power to assign personal property, now by law assign- 
able, including chattels real, directly to himself and another person or other persons 
or corporation, by the like means as he might gn the same to another.” 
It appears, therefore, that it is still correct to say that a man can not legally con- 
vey to himself alone. Possibly it might be held under the conveyancing act that a 
man ean not convey to himself and another as tenants in common, but that would be 
putting a narrow construction on the word “jointly.” 
Q. 8. What provisions are made in the settled land act, 1882, with r 
property of infants and married women? 
A. The settled land act, 1882, provides by section 59, that— 
“Where a person who is in his own right seized of or entitled in possession to land 
is an infant, then for the purposes of this act the land is settled land, and the infant 
shall be deemed tenant for life thereof.” 
The next section provides that the powers of the act may be exercised on behalf 
of the infant by the trustces of the settlement, and if there be none, then by such per- 
son and in such manner as the court may order.

  534 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
The sixty-first section deals with the case of a married woman. If a tenant for 
life is a married woman entitled for her seperate use, she alone has the powers of a 
tenant for life; and a restraint on anticipation does not affect the powers. Where a 
tenant for life is a married woman not entitled for her separate ‘use, she and her hus- 
band together have the powers of a tenant for life. 
Q. 9. Describe the legal nature and incidents of personal annuities? 
A. When one person by deed purports to, bind himself to pay to another a certain 
sum per annum without charging the payment of the same upon any land, the series 
of payments so to be made is called a personal annuity. Such an annuity may be 
limited to the grantee for a term of years or for life, or to the grantee and the heirs 
of his body, or to the grantee and his heirs. It was held in early times that a per- 
sonal annuity limited to one and his assigns might be assigned by the grantee so 
that the assignee might sue in his own name; and the same result was arrived at 
when the assigns were not mentioned in the original limitation. These decisions took 
personal annuities out of the general class of choses in action. 
A personal annuity limited to the heirs of the grantee descends on intestacy to his 
heir-at-law. A personal annuity limited to one and the heirs of his body confers on 
the grantee a sort of fee simple conditional, which he can not aliene for more than 
his own life, so long as he has no issue, but can aliene to another and his heirs gen- 
eral, as soon as he has issue born. (Wms, P. P., Pt. 3, ¢. 1.) 
Q. 10. State and explain the provisions of the conveyancing and law of property 
act, 1881, with respect to the redemption of perpetual charges on land and the dis- 
charge of incumbrances on sale. 
A. The fifth section of the conveyancing act, 1881, provides as follows: 
“(1) Where land subject to any incumbrance, whether immediately payable or 
not, is sold by the court, or out of court, the court may, if it thinks fit, on the ap- 
plication of any party to the sale, direct or allow payment into court, (a) in case of 
an annual sum charged on the land, or (b) of a capital sum charged on a determin- 
able interest in the land—of such amount as, when invested in Government securi- 
ties, the court considers will be sufficient, by means of the dividends thereof, to 
to keep down or otherwise provide for that charge—and (c) in any other case of 
capital money charged on the land—of the amount sufficient to meet the incum- 
prance and any interest due thereon.” 
A further sum is to be paid in to answer. costs; and the court can then declare the 
Jand free frem the incumbrance, give effect to the sale, and administer the sum paid 
in. 
    
   
  EQUITY—PASS PAPER. 
Q.1. Where trustees are expressly required by the terms of their trust to invest the 
trust money in the public funds, and, instead of so doing, they retain it in their 
hands, what are the rights of the cestui que trust against the trustees in respect of 
the money so retained by them; and is there ary, and, if any, what, difference in 
the liability of the trustees (1) where there is also an express trust for aceumula- 
tion, and (2) where they are directed to invest on Government or real securities? 
A. Where trustees are required to invest money in the funds and omi to do so 
the beneficiaries have the option to make the trustees account for the money and 
interest at 4 per cent, or for the funds which might have been bought and the divi- 
dends which would have accrued upon them. (Lewin, ¢. xiv., s. 4, § 44.) 
If there is also an express trust to accumulate, the trustee will be considered as 
having lent the money and interest to himself, and will be chargeable with com- 
pound interest accordingly. (Lewin, c. xiv., s. 5, § 17.) 
Where trustees are directed to invest in Government or real securities and emit to 
do either they are chargeable with the amount of the money and interest. The 
beneficiaries have no option in this case. (Lewin, c. xiv, s. 4, § 45). 
Q. 2. On what securities, not expressly forbidden by the terms of their trusts, can 
 
-P-A-G-E-567
  LEGAL EDUCATION IN EUROPE. 535 
   trustees lawfully invest trust money; and is there any, and what, limit to such 
power of investment? 
A. Trustees, when not expressly forbidden by the terms of their trust, may in- 
vest trust money on any of the following securities: 
(a) Originally allowed by the court of chancery 
annuities. 
(b) By act 22 and 23 Vict., ¢. 35, s. $2: Real securities in any part of the United 
Kingdom, stock of the Banks of England and Ireland, and East India stock. 
(c) By act 23 and 24 Vict., c. 38, s. 12, and an order of the court of chancery issued 
under it, dated February 1, 1861: Bank stock, East India stock, exchequer bills, the 
24 per cent annuities, and mortgages of freeholds and copyholds in England and 
Wales. 
(a) By act 30 and 31 Vict., c. 1382: East India stock created after the act of 22 and 
28 Vict., c. 35, and any securities the interest on which shall be guaranteed by Par- 
liament. 
(e) By act 34 and 35 Vict., ce. 47, s. 13: Metropolitan consols. 
In lending on mortgage the power of trustees is limited by the rule that they 
should act as a prudent man would act with respect to his own money. (Ante, Vol. 
Vu., pp. 144, 145.) 
Q. 3. Are there any exceptions to the general rule that a trustee is not to be held 
liable for the acts or defaults of a cotrustee in which he has not participated? If 
80, give some examples by way of illustration. 
A. The rule is controlled by another rule, namely, that one trustee should never 
let any of the capital of the trust preperty come under the sole control of his co- 
trustee; and if any capital should ever so come, it is the duty of the first-mentioned. 
trustee to see at once thatitis properly invested. Ifa trustee omits to perform these 
duties he becomes liable for any less occasioned by the acts of his cotrustee. The case 
of income is different from capital, because in general any one of several joint owners 
ean give a receipt for the whole of it. Every trustee, however, is liable to see to 
the proper application of income, which, as a matter of fact, does come under his 
control, and if he puts any such income under the sole control of a cotrustee le 
will be liable for the loss of it. (Snell, 147, Pt. 11, c. 6.) : 
Example: Trustees sell land preperly and receive the purchase money in notes, 
which one puts in his pocket. There is not time to pay the money into a bank that 
day, and the trustee who has the notes absconds with them that evening. The 
next day the other trustee calls at his house to see after the money, is unable to 
find him, and instructs a solicitor at once to take proceedings, but the money is 
lost. The innocent trustee is not liable; but he would have been liable if he had 
left the money in the hands of the cotrustees for a length of time and it had got 
mixed with the general money of the latter and had been spent and so lost. 
Q.4. Assuming the existence of acontract binding in equity—(1) In what classes 
of cases will the court decree specific performance? and (2) in what classes of cases 
will it refuse to interfere? Give examples of each class. 
A. In order that a decree for specific performance may be obtained, it is necessary 
that the contract should be one in which (1) damages would not be an adequate 
compensation for the breach of the contract; (2) the court could insure the proper 
performance of the contract; and (3) the performance would not entail any special 
hardship on the defendant. Conversely, the court will not decree specific perform- 
ance in the three classes of cases in which, respectively, (1) damages are an adequate 
compensation; (2) the court can not insure proper performance; and (3) perform- 
ance will entail some spécial hardship on the defendant. 
Examples: (1) Damages are a sufficient compensation for default in supplying 
goods which can be bought in the market; but they are insufficient compensation 
for default in conveying a strip of land near the purchaser’s house, or a picture by a 
celebrated artist. 
     Consols, and new and reduced
-P-A-G-E-568
    536 : EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
(2) The court can insure the proper performance of the delivery of an article or 
conveyance of a plot of land, but it can not insure the proper performance of an 
agreement to sing a song or to become another’s partner. 
(3) When a purchaser by his own negligence bid for a lot at an auction when he 
intended to buy another lot, the court refused to enforce performance against him. 
(Snell, Pt. III, c. 9.) 
Q. 5. Are there any exceptions to the gencral rule that the court will not compel 
specific performance of part of a contract unless it can execute the whole of it? Give 
an example of a divisible contract which the court will decree to be specifically per- 
formed, and of an indivisible contract which the court will not specifically perform, 
A. There are exceptions, but they do not appear to be referable to any clear prin- 
ciple. In Lumley v. Wagner (1 DeG.M. & G., 604), under anagreement to sing at one 
theater and nowhere else during three months, the court granted an injunction 
against singing elsewhere. 
In Donnell y. Bennett (22 C. D., 835), where the defendant agreed to sell all his fish 
refuse to the plaintiff and to no other manufacturer, Fry, J., granted an injunction 
against a breach of the latter clause, saying that the authorities appeared to estab- 
lish that an injunction might be granted where there was an expressnegativeclause 
which was separable from the rest of the agreement. 
In Sticker v. Wedderburn (3K. & J., 393), the court refused to grant specific perform- 
ance of a contract by promoters of a company to purchase a patent, when the con- 
tract stipulated that the versder should give his services to the company for two 
years, on the ground that the court could not see to the proper performance of the 
last mentioned stipulation. (Ante, Vol. v, p. 22; Vol. 0, 121; Fry on Specific Per- 
formance, c. 15; Kerr on Injunctions, c. 22, s. 1.) 
Q. 6. Are theré any exceptions to the general rule that equity will not decree 
specific performance of contracts as to personal chattels or personal acts? If so, 
give instances and state the grounds on which the jurisdiction in such cases is based. 
A. As to personal chattels, the general rule is based on the principle that in gen- 
eral one chattel can be made just like another; and therefore it will be sufficient 
compensation for nondelivery of a chattel to order payment of the cost of getting 
another together with any loss caused by the delay. If this reason ceases, the law 
ceases also; and itis established, therefore, that the court will order delivery of 
articles of special value, like a picture by a celebrated artist, the loss of which can 
not be adequately supplied by another, It has also been held that the court would 
order the delivery of ships to a charterer, but not their conveyance to a purchaser; 
the assignment of interests in personal estate uncertain in their amount or in the time 
of their payment; the assignment of patents; the delivery of title deeds; the trans- 
fer of shares in small companies, which could not be bought in the market; and the 
court will order a purchaser to accept shares, which are unmarketable by r n of 
aliability attached to them. (Snell, Pt. III, ¢. 9; ante, Vol. m1, pp. 265-267.) 
As to personal acts, the court in general refuses to order their performance on the 
ground that it can not insure their proper performance. The court has, however, 
ordered a railway company to make a siding, according to its contract (Lytton v. 
Great Northern Railway Co.,2 K. & J., 394); and other cases have occurred in which 
a covenuanter has been ordered to do work upon his own land according to his con- 
tract. (See Wilson v. Furness Railway Co., L., R. 9 Eq., 28; Greenev. West Cheshire 
Railway Co., L. R. 13 Eq., 44; Firth v. Midland Railway Co., L. R. 20 Eq., 100; and 
Cooke v. Chilcott, 3 C. D. 694, which last mentioned has been overruled on other 
points by Haywood v. Brunswick Permanent Building Society, 8 Q. B. D., 403; and 
Ausierberry v. Corporation of Oldham, 29 C. D., 750. See also specific performance re- 
fused in Wilson v. Northampton, etc., Railway Co., L. R.9 Ch., 279; and compare 
Powell, etce., Co. v. Taff Vale Railway Co., ibid, 331.) 
Q. 7. Where a vender is able to perform his contract in its substance, but ean not 
perform it literally in all its parts, can he, in the absence of any condition or stipu- 
     
      
   
 
-P-A-G-E-569
  
LEGAL EDUCATION IN EUROPE. 537 
lation on the subject, compel the purchaser, or be compelled by bim, to perform the 
contract so far as he is able; and, if so, on what terms or conditions in each case? 
A. The general rule is that the vender can not compel the purchaser to take the 
property unless he can make a title to every part according to the contract, and 
according to the description of the property contained in the contract. Cases have 
occurred, however, in which a defect in the title of a small immaterial portion, or | 
a deficiency in the acreage of some part, has been held not to be fatal; and the pur- 
chaser has been compelled to take the property with an abatement in respect of the 
faulty part. 
On the other hand, the general rule is that if the vender can not make a title accord- 
ing to the contract the purchaser may compel him to sell such interest as he has, 
with a reduction in the purchase money as compensation for the deficiency. But 
the court will refuse this if it would entail special hardship on the vender or prej- 
udice the position of others. (Snell, Pt. III, ¢. 9.) 
Q. 8. What is the difference between the doctrine of the consolidation of securities 
cking? Give an example of each, and state on what principles they respec- and 
tively rest. 
A. The consolidation of mortgages is a name given to a right formerly accorded 
to all mortgagees, namely, that when a mortgagee held two securities for two debts 
due from the same mortgager, he might refuse to allow one of them to be redeemed 
separately from the other. It was said to rest on the principle that he who would 
have equity must do equity. If the mortgager desired to exercise his equitable 
right of redeeming one property he was bound to perform the equitable act of pay- 
ing the other debt also. 
Tacking was a name given to another right—namely, that if a mortgagee held a 
legal mortgage on certain property, and he had also made another advance of money 
on security of the same property, without having notice of any other puisne incum- 
brance, he was allowed to tack his further advance to his legal mortgage, in priority 
to any other puisne ineumbrance which happened to exist. This was said to depend 
upon the principle that where equities were equal the law should prevail. The two 
puisne incumbrances were considered as having equal equities though one was later 
in time than the other. (Snell, Pt. II, ¢. 16.) 
Q. 9. What is requisite to the validity against the mortgager’s trustee in bank- 
ruptcy of (1) a mortgage,of a ship or of shares in a ship; (2) of a bill of sale of per- 
sonal chattels under the bills of sale act, 1882; (3) of legal debts; (4) of fu of 
the mortgager in the hands of a third person; and (5) of funds in eourt standing to 
the credit of a cause? 
A. (1) As to aship, or a share in a ship, the merchant shipping acts provide for 
the registration of the ownership of every British ship, and the registration of every 
mortgage or assignment of the same. ‘Mortgages rank in the order of theirregistra- 
tion, and notice of a prior unregistered mortgage has no effect. The acts also pro- 
vide a form of mortgage, and direct every mortgage to be made in the form so pro- 
vided, or as near thereto as the circumstances admit. Nevertheless, it may be 
Coubted whether an unregistered mortgage is not good against the trustee in bank- 
ruptey of the mortgager. Equities may be enforced against the registered owners 
of ships, and the trustee in bankruptcy stands, in general, in the same position as 
the bankrupt. He takes only what the bankrupt is entitled to, and takes the bank- 
rupt’s property subject to all equities affecting it. In certain cases his rights are 
extended by the reputed ownership clause, which has been introduced into all bank- 
tuptcy acts, but, in default of any special statutory enactment, the trustee in bank- 
ruptcy stands only in the shoes of the bankrupt, and does not rank as a purchaser 
for value from him. (Wms. P. P., Pt. I, ¢. 4.) 
(2) The bills of sale act, 1882, only applies to bills of sale thereafter given as 
security for money. As to such bills, the goods comprised therein pass to the trustee 
in bankruptcy of the borrower, under the reputed ownership clause, if they remain 
         
-P-A-G-E-570
  538 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
in the possession of the hankrupt. See Swift v. Pannell (24 C. D., 210), in which it 
was held that other bills of sale, if duly made and registered, are still good against 
a trustee in bankruptcy claiming under the reputed ownership clause. (Bankruptcy 
act, 1883, s. 44, § (iii).) 2 
A bill of sale under the act of 1882 is.also void as to tho chattels comprised therein, 
unless it is duly attested and registered under the act of 1878 within seven days, 
and unless it states truly the consideration for which it was given (s. 8). It is also 
void altogether unless made in the form given in the schedule to the act (s. 9). It 
is also void altogether if given in consideration of a sum less than £30. 
(3) As to legal debts. The bankruptcy act, 1883, s. 44, § (iii), provides that 
things in action other than debts due or growing due to the bankrupt in the course 
of his trade or business shall not be deemed goods within the meaning of the section. 
The result of this clause appears to be that a mortgage of a debt due to the bank- 
rupt in the course of his trade will be void, unless notice thereof has been given to 
the debtor before the commencement of the bankruptcy, so as to take it out of the 
reputed ownership of the bankrupt. But a mortgage of any other kind of debt 
would be good without any such notice. Moreover, there does not appear to be any 
statute or rule of law requiring writing or any formality for a mortgage of any 
legal debt, but it would be very unwise ever to dispense with a written assignment 
in such a case; and a power to sue in the name of the assigner should be added, as 
the case is not covered by the judicature act, 1873, s. 25, § 6. But under an assign- 
ment of a debt on trust to get it in, retain a certain sum, and pay the surplus 
to the assigner the assignee may sue in hisown name. (See Burlinson v. Hall, 12 
Q. B. D., 347.) 
(4) Funds of the mortgagee in the hands of a third person. Such funds, when so 
circumstanced as not to give rise to a legal debt, confer an equitable right of action 
on the owner. The case then comes under the 9th section of the statute of frauds, 
which requires writing and the signature of the assignor for the assignment of every 
equitable interest. The assignee of an equitable right could always sue in his own 
name for such relief as he was entitled to. Such an assignee is bound to give notice 
tothe party liable in order to protect himself against any subsequent purchaser; but 
notice does not appear to be necessary as against a trustee in bankruptcy of the 
assignor. It is clear, however, in these cases, both as to legal and equitable claims, 
that if an assignee omitted to give notice, the party liable would be discharged by 
payment to the trustee in bankruptcy as he would by payment to the bankrupt him- 
self before bankruptcy, and it might perhaps be held that the security was thereby 
lost. (See Re Bright’s Settlement (13 C. D., 413}, and Palmer v. Locke (18 C. D., 381.) 
(5) As to funds in court standing to the credit of a cause, an interest in such funds 
is included in the general term equitable rights, and what we have said above re- 
specting equitable rights applies to such a case. The mode of giving notice to the 
court is, however, putting a stop order on the funds. This does not appear to be 
essential in order to establish the title; but, in the absence of it, the funds might 
be paid out to the mortgagor’s trustee in bankruptcy. (See the cases last cited, and 
Pinnock v. Bailey (23 C. D., 497); Mutual Life Asswrance Society v. Langley (26 C. D., 
686,) varied on appeal (W. N., 1886), 4; In re 4. D. Holmes (29 C. D., 786). 
Q. 10. What are the remedies of a mortgagee of freehold and leasehold property 
(the mortgage being in the usual form, and containing the usual covenants and pro- 
yisos) for the recovery of his debt and interest? 
A. The remedies are as follows: 
(1) To enter into possession and receipt of the rents and profits of the mortgaged 
property, and retain his principal, interest, and costs thereout. 
(2) To sell the whole or any part or parts of the mortgaged property and do like- 
wise. This power can only be exercised when it is authorized by the mortgage deed 
or by statute, and should not be exercised unless the circumstances have arisen to 
warrant it. In general it is necessary that interest should be in arrear for a certain     
   
-P-A-G-E-571
LEGAL EDUCATION IN EUROPE. — . 539 
time, or that default should be made in paying off the eapital after a certain notice, 
in order that a power of sale may become exercisable. (See the conveyancing act, 
1881, s. 20, for the conditions of the statutory power annexed to all mortgages by 
deed executed after Jan, 1, 1882; and see Lord Cranworth’s act, 23 and 24 Vict., ¢. 
145, part 2, for a prior statutory power.) 
(3) The same statutes give a mortgagee power to appoint a receiver to pay him 
his interest and costs; but under the conveyancing act a receiver can only be ap- 
pointed when the power of sale has become exercisable. 
(4) To bring an action to recover personal judgment against the mortgagor for 
payment of the principal and interest. It is the practice that such a judgment may 
be obtained under Order XIV, as in the case of an unsecured debt. 
(5) To bring an action of foreclosure against the mortgagor; and 
(6) To combine the two last remedies in one action, praying for immediate personal 
judgment and foreclosure in case of default for six months. 
COMMON LAW.—PASS PAPER, 
Q. 1. Under what conditions we a writ of summons be served out of the juris- 
diction? 
A. A writ of summons ean not be served out of the jurisdiction without leave of 
the court or a judge, which ean be given only in certain cases, including the follow- 
ing: Where tke action relates to land within the jurisdiction, or to the construction, 
rectification, or setting aside of a contract or other instrument relating to such 
land; where the relief is sought against a person domiciled, or ordinarily resident 
within the jurisdiction; where the action is founded on a breach within the jurisdic- 
tion of a contract which ought to be performed within the jurisdiction (unless the 
defendant is domiciled, or ordinarily resident in Scotland or Ireland); where the 
action is for an injunction as to anything to be done within the jurisdiction, or re- 
specting a nuisance within the jurisdiction; where a person out of the jurisdiction 
is a necessary or proper party to an action against another person duly served within 
the jurisdiction. The application for leave to serve the writ out of the jurisdiction 
must be supported by evidence showing a good cause of action, and the deponent’s 
belief as to where the defendant is, or probably may be found, whether he is a Brit- 
ish subject or not, and the grounds on which the application is made. Where leaye 
is given, a time is limited after the service within which the defendant is to enter 
an appearance. Where leave to serve the writ in Scotland or Ireland is sought, the 
court or judge has a discretion as to granting leave in any of the foregoing cases. 
(Ord. XE.) 
Q. 2. What are the principal rules as to the discovery of documents in'the posses- 
sion of a party to an action, and what are the consequences of noncompliance 
with orders for discovery? 
A. A party to an action may be ordered by the court or judge to make discovery 
upon oath of documents in his possession relating to any matter in question in the 
action. The order is obtained on the application of the other party; but the appli- 
eation may be refused or adjourned if such discovery is not necessary, or not neces- 
sary at that stage of the proceedings, or such other order may be made, either 
general, or limited to certain classes of documents, as the court or judge may think 
fit. The discovery is made by an affidavit, setting forth the documents, and dis- 
tinguishing those which the deponent claims to be privileged from producing. The 
party seeking discovery must before applying for it pay into court the sum of £5, or 
such further sum as may be ordered, the money so paid in to remain in court until the 
action has been finally disposed of, fant then to be paid to the party by whom it was 
paid in if the costs are adjudged to him, and otherwise to be subject to a lien for 
the costs. ? 
A party failing to obey an order for discovery is liable to attachment; and, also, 
if a plaintiff, to have his action dismissed for want of prosecution; and, if a defend- 
     
-P-A-G-E-572
  540 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
ant, to have his defense struck out, and to be placed in the same position as if he 
had not defended. (Ord. XXXI.) | 
Q. 3. What is the form of the writ of fieri facias, and what effects of the debtor 
are excepted from its operation? 
A. The writ of fieri facias commands the sheriff that of the goods and chattels of 
the judgment debtor he cause to be made the sum stated in the writ (being the 
amount of the judgment debt), with interest thereon, and also the amount of the 
costs, with interest thereon at the rate of 4 per cent per annum, The writ is 
executed by the seizure and sale of the goods and chattels of the judgment debtor. 
Under a fieri facias all the personal goods and chattels of the judgment debtor 
may be taken, with the exception of the wearing apparel and bedding of himself, or 
his family, and the tools and implements of his trade, the value of such articles not 
exceeding in the whole £5. (8 and 9 Vict., c. 127, s. 8.) 
Q. 4. Describe a promissory note and a crossed check. Is the banker of the 
maker or the drawer, respectively, liable to make good to his customer the amount of 
the instrument if he has paid it on a forged indorsement purporting to be that of 
the payee? 
A. A promissory note is a written promise by one person (called the maker) to 
pay a certain sum of money at a specified time or on demand to another therein 
named (who is called the payee) or order, or to him or bearer, The maker of a 
promissory note is in a position similar to that of the acceptor of a bill of exchange, 
and is therefore the party primarily liable on the instrument; and, like a bill of ex- 
change, the note is transferred by delivery, if payable to the party named, or bearer, 
or by indorsement and delivery if payable to him or order. 
A crossed check is a bill of exchange, drawn on (but not accepted by) a banker 
by his customer, payable on demand, and bearing across its face two parallel trans- 
verse lines either with or without the words ‘‘and company” (or any abbreviation 
of those words), or the name of a banker between the parallel lines. The effect of 
this crossing is to make the bill payable only on presentation by a banker, and if it 
is crossed with the name of a particular banker, it is payable only on presentation 
by that banker. Asa check is not accepted by the banker on whom it is drawn, 
the drawer is the party primarily liable on it. A check is transferable in the same 
way as any other bill of exchange. (See bills of exchange act, 1882, Pt. 3.) 
A banker who pays a promissory note, bearing a forged indorsement, can not 
charge his customer with the amount, as no title can be made through a forgery 
(Robarts v. Tucker, 12 Q. B., 560); but the banker of the drawer of a check is pro- 
tected by statute from liability for payment of the check on a forged indorsement 
purporting to be that of the payee. (i6 and 17 Vict., c. 59, s. 19.) 
Q. 5. Explain the nature of the contract of guaranty by reference to cases decided 
under the statute of frauds and Lord Tenterden’s act. 
A. The contract of guaranty is an undertaking to answer for the debt, default, or 
miscarriage of another person who is, and continues, primarily liable. If, therefore, 
the party on whose account the promise is made was not originally under any legal 
liability (as where credit was given to the promisor alone), or there is a transfer of 
his liability to the promisor, the contract is not a guaranty within the statute of 
frands. Birkmyr v. Darnell (Salk., 27); Mountstephen v. Lakeman (L. R. 7, H. L. 17.) 
And in a contract of guaranty the promise must be made to a third person, i. e., the 
creditor; hence a promise to indemnify a person against a legal liability incurred 
by him is not a guaranty. 
In Pasley v. Freeman (3 T. R., 51) it was held that a fraudulent representation 
made to induce a person to contract with a third party was not a guaranty, and 
therefore was actionable though not made in writing. But under Lord Tenterden’s 
act (9 Geo. 4, c. 14) no action can be maintained on such a representation made 
concerning the character, credit, etc., of another, to the intent that the latter may 
obtain credit for money or goods, unless the representation be made in writing 
signed by the party to be charged therewith,

Q. 6. What are the periods of limitation within which the principal kinds of action 
may be brought? When does the time of limitation begin to run in respect of a 
claim (1) on a promissory note payable on demand; (2) for money lent by means of 
a check not immediately presented for payment; (3) for damage to land resulting 
from a wrongful act committed some time before the damage arises or is discovered? 
A. Actions for the recovery of land must be brought within twelve years after 
the time at which the right of action accrued; or, where the claimant’s estate was 
originally an estate in remainder or reversion, within twelve years after the time 
when the right of action accrued to the owner of the preceding estate, or six years 
from the time when the claimant became entitled to the possession, whichever shall 
be the longer period. But where an acknowledgment in writing has been given of 
the title of the claimant, the time runs from the date of such acknowledgment. 
And where the claimant is under disability at the time the right of action accrues, a 
further period of six years is allowed from the time when the disability ceased, pro- 
vided the action be brought within thirty years from the accrual of the right (3 and 
4 W. 4,c.27; real property limitation act, 1876, 37 and 38 Vict., ¢.57). 
Actions on contracts under seal must be brought within twenty years from the 
time of the accrual of the right of action, or from the time of an acknowledgment 
in writing, or part payment of principal or payment of interest, made or given in 
the meantime; or where at the time of the accrual of the right the plaintiff was 
under disability of infancy, coverture, or lunacy, or the defendant was beyond seas, 
then within twenty years after such disability shall have ceased, or the defendant 
shall have returned from beyond seas (3 and 4 W. 4, ¢. 42). 
Actions on simple contracts must be brought within six years after the accrual of 
the right of action; the period, however, being extended by an acknowledgment, 
or payment, or disability of the party entitled, or absence of the defendant beyond 
seas, in the same way as in the case of a contract under seal (21 Jac. 1, ¢.16; 9 Geo. 
4,c.14; 19 and 20 Vict., c. 97). 
As regards actions of tort, the periods of limitations are, in an action for assault, 
battery, or false imprisonment, four years; for slander, two years; and for other 
torts in general, six years (21 Jac. 1, c. 16). é 
(1) From the date of the note; (2) from the date of the payment of the money; 
(3) from the date of the commission of the act, assuming that it would have been 
actionable before the damage had arisen. 
Q. 7. Distinguish the three principal classes of bailments. <A stolen article is 
pawned, and afterwards sold by the pawnbroker as a forfeited pledge. Can he be 
made to refund the ‘purchase money when the owner claims the article from the 
purchaser? 
A. (1) Bailments by which the bailor alone is benefited, comprising bailments of 
goods to be kept or dealt with gratuitously by the bailee; (2) bailments from which 
the bailee alone derives benefit, viz, gratuitous loans; (3) bailments for the benefit 
of both bailor and bailee, comprising pledges of goods, letting and hiring of goods, 
and delivery of goods to be kept, or carried, or otherwise dealt with by the baileo 
for a reward. 
In bailments of the first class the bailee is liable for gross negligence only, in the 
care of the goods; but if he possesses skill with reference to the subject-matter of 
he bailment, he is bound to use it. In bailments of the second and third classes 
the bailee is liable for any negligence. And by the common law a carrier is answer- 
able as bailee of the goods carried by him for loss arising from any cause, except 
the act of God, or the king’s enemies, or defects in the goods; and a similar liabil- 
ity attaches at common law to an inkeeper as bailee of his guests’ goods. (Coggs v. 
Bernard, Ld. Raym., 909.) 
The pawnbroker can not be made to refund the purchase money; for he is not 
presumed to sell as absolute owner, but only to sell such right to the pledge as he 
 
-P-A-G-E-574
    542 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
himself has, and therefore there is no implied warranty of title on the sale. (Morley 
yv. Attenborough, 3 Exch., 514.) 
Q. 8. A bailiff, being ordered by a landlord ‘to distrain on the, demised premises, 
distrains a stranger’s cattle on adjoining land, sells them, and pays the proceeds to 
the landlord. Can the owner of the cattle maintai an action against the landlord? 
A. The owner of the cattle can maintain an action against the landlord if the 
latter has ratified the wrongful act of the bailiff. The receipt of the proceeds of 
the sale, however, would not in itself be a ratification, if the landlord did not know 
that the distress had been wrongfully made. And in the absence of ratification by 
the landlord, an action of tort can not be maintained against him. But the pro- 
. ceeds of the sale of the cattle can be recovered from the landlord by the owner as 
money belenging to him. (Ireeman v. Rosher, 13 Q. B., 780.) 
Q. 9. Point out the difference between the action for false imprisonment and 
malicious prosecution in ecespect to the onus of proof. Can an action be maintained 
under any cireumstances (1) for having brought an action against the plaintiff ; (2) 
for having put the bankruptcy law in motion against the plaintiff ; or (3) against 
a corporation in respect of the manager of the corporation having arrested and 
prosecuted the plaintiff? 
A. In an action for false imprisonment the onus of proof is upon the defendant; 
for the detention of the plaintiff is prima facie illegal, and it lies upon the defend- 
ant to justify it. But in an action for malicious prosecution the preecedings are 
prima facie legal, being in due course of law; and the burden of proving that they 
were instituted without reasonable cause, and were therefore improper, is upon the 
plaintiff. 
(1) No; (2) Yes. An action (similar to an action for malicious prosecution) will 
lie for maliciously taking proceedings in bankruptcy. (3) Yes, if the acts of the 
manager were done by him in the course of his employment as the servant of the 
corporation, (Edwards vy. Midland Railay Co., 6 Q. B. D., 287.) 
Q. 10. A passenger from London to Paris finds on arrival at Paris that his box has 
been opened and the contents stulen somewhere en route. Can a man, found in 
possession of the stolen property in London be convicted in an English court? 
A. No; unless it can be proved that the property was stolen within the jurisdic- 
tion of the English courts. (See Harris, Cr. L., 3d ed., 852-356.) 
Q. 11. State shortly the mode of proceeding on a criminal charge falling within 
the summary jurisdiction of justices. 
A. The mode of proceeding is as follows: At the hearing the substance of the 
information is stated to the defendant, and he is asked if he has any cause to show 
why he should not be convicted. If he admits the truth of the charge, and does 
not show cause why he should not be convicted, the court proceeds to convict. If 
he denies the truth of the charge, the court hears the parties and their witnesses 
(all the evidence being on oath) and proceeds to convict the defendant or else dis- 
miss the information, as the case may require. (See Harris, Cr. L., 3d ed., 492.) 
Q. 12. In what case can more than one offense be inquired into on the trial of an 
indictment? 
A. Two or more offenses can be inquired into where all the offenses ate misde- 
meanors. But a count for a felony can not, in general, be joined with a eount for a 
misdemeanor, And, as a general rule, several different felonies can not be charged 
in the same indictment. To this rule, however, there are some exceptions. On an 
indictment for larceny a count for receiving stolen property may be added, and on 
an indictment for larceny or embezzlement several counts may be inserted for dis- 
tinct acts of stealing or embezzlement, not exceeding three, committed within six 
months from the first to the last. And in certain cases, if the prisoner has been 
previously convicted, a count is added charging him with the previous conviction. 
(Harris, Cr. L., 3d ed., 342-344.)

ROMAN LAW.—PASS PAPER. 
Q. 1. Seriptum jus est lex, plebiscita, senatusconsulta, principium placita, magis- 
tratuum edicta, responsa prodentium. Explain this passage. 
A. By jus scriptum is meant law that has been committed to writing at its origin, 
as opposed to jus non scriptum, or law originating in custom (Austin, p.529). In 
the Roman system jus seriptum existed in the several forms mentioned in the passage 
cited. Lex was a law. passed in early times in the Comitia Curiata, and later in 
the Comitia Centuriata. Plebiscita were laws made in the Comitia Tributa. Sena- 
tus-consulta were laws made by the Senate. Principium placita were laws made 
by the emperor in the exercise of his sovereign authority (imperium). Magistra- 
tuum edicta were collections of rules framed by such magistrates as had the jus 
edicendi, and chiefly by the pretor urbanus. Responsa prudentium were the 
opinions of such jurists as enjoyed the right of giving opinions that had the force 
of law (Inst. i, 2). 
Q. 2. Distinguish agnates from cognates and illustrate the importance of the dis- 
tinction. 
A. Agnates were persons related to each other by the fact of subjection to the 
power of the same paterfamilias, or by there having been a person who would have 
been their common paterfamilias if he had been living. Cognates were persons re- 
lated by blood. Hence, among agnates were included persons who, having been 
made subject to the patria potestas merely by adoption ‘or arrogation, were not cog- 
nates; while cognates included the issue of female agnates and emancipated chil- 
dren, who were excluded from the class of agnates. 
Agnatic relationship was attended with rights of succession on intestacy, to which 
cognates were not entitled, and with a liability to the office of tutor, from which 
cognates were free. 
Q. 3. What was bonorum possessio? If A, being in possession of an immovable, 
die before the time required for usucapio has been completed, will the time that has 
already elapsed be reckoned in favor of a bonorwm possessor ? 
A. Bonoruwm possessio was the succession to an inheritance under the provisions of 
the preetorian law, as opposed to succession by the jus civile. The rights of a sue- 
cessor by bonorum possessio were similar in all respects to those of the heir by the 
jus civile. Accordingly, in the case put in the question, the time that had elapsed 
would be reckoned in favor of a bonorum possessor, since he continues the persona of 
the deceased (Inst. ii, 6, 12). 
Q. 4. Give an account of the will per ws et libram and of the soldier’s will. 
A. The will per es et libram was, in effect, a conveyance of the testator’s estate by 
the mode of transfer known as maxcipatio. This wasa conveyance made by fictitious 
sale in the presence of five witnesses and a balance holder (libripens). Originally 
the nominal purchaser of the testator’s estate (familie emptor) was the heir, but 
afterwards, in order to avoid the inconveniences attending an irrevocable sale by the 
testator in his lifetime to his heir, the practice was adopted of employing, as familie 
emptor, a third person, to whom the sale was made mereiy for form’s sake; a state- 
ment (nuncupatio) being made by the testator of the name of the heir and the other 
provisions of the will, either orally or in writing (Sand., 5th ed., 163). 
A soldier on service could make a valid testament without observing the rules that 
applied to testaments generally. Thus no particular formalities were required; the 
intention to make a testament and its terms might be proved by any writing or by 
witnesses; persons might be instituted as heirs who were generally incapacitated; 
the testator was not bound to institute or formally disinherit his children; his will 
was not liable to be set aside as inofficious; he could give more than three-fourths of 
his property in legacies; he could die partly testate and partly intestate; and his 
willwas not invalidated by his undergoing the minima capitis deminutio, These priv- 
ileges, which were given by imperial constitutions, existed only while the soldier   
     
-P-A-G-E-576
  544 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
was in actual service; and the informal testament remained in force only while the 
service continued and for one year after the testator’s discharge. 
'  Q. 5. A testator dies leaving a son and a grandson by a deceased daughter. He 
appoints his son heir, does not mention the grandson, and bequeaths all his prop- 
erty to a stranger. What is the effect of the will? 
A. If there was not sufficient reason for the omission to appoint the grandson heir, 
or otherwise provide for him, he may have the will set aside as inofficiosum. (Inst. ii, 
13, 3; ii, 18.) But if there was legal ground for the exclusion of the grandson, the 
will is valid; but under the Lex Falcidia, the son will be entitled, as heir, to one- 
quarter of the estate, as against the legatee (Inst. ii, 22). 
Q. 6. Explain and illustrate prectorie stipulationes, judiciales stipulationes, and com- 
munes stipulationes. 
A. Pratorie stipulationes.—These were stipulations that in certain cases were made 
by order of the pretor, as a security for the performance by the promissor of some 
duty that was not enforceable directly by action. They included the stipulation 
damni infecti, by which a person who was owner of a building that was likely to fall 
down bound himself to make good any damage that should be done to his neighbor 
through the fall of the building; and the stipulation legatorum, by which an heir 
bound himself to pay a legacy, that was not immediately payable, when it should 
become due. 
- Judiciales stipulationes.—These were stipulations made by order of the judge in the 
course of judicial proceedings to secure the performance by the defendant of acts 
that might have to be done by him in order to give effect to the judgment}; e. g., the 
stipulation de dolo, by which the defendant bound himself to carry out the sentence 
of the court without any attempt at fraud on his part; and the stipulation de perse- 
quendo servo qui in fuga est restituendove pretio, by which the promissor was bound to 
pursue a runaway slave who was the subject of the action, or pay his price. 
Communes stipulationes were such as either the magistrate or the judge in an action 
might order to be made. Instances of these were the stipulation rem salvam fore 
pupilli, by which a tutor bound himself for the security of the pupil’s property; and 
the stipulation de rato, by which a procurator bringing an action in the name of his 
principal undertook that what he did would be ratified by the principal. (Inst. 
11, 18.) 
Q. 7. Aslave, of whom Titius has the usufruct and belonging to Mevius, enters into 
astipulation; discuss who will acquire the benefit of the contract. 
A. If the stipulation had reference to the ordinary labors of the slave or to the 
property of Titius the benefit of the contract would be acquired by Titius; other- 
wise it would be acquired by Mevius. (Inst. m1, 28, 1, 2.) 
Q. 8. What is meant by obligationes que ex delicto nascuntur? Give examples. 
Can you suggest any reason why such obligationes were classified as res? 
A. By obligationes que ex delicto nascuntur is meant obligations arising from viola- 
tions of legal rights otherwise than by breach of contract, and which the early Ro- 
man.law recognized as legal wrongs subject to special remedies by action. They 
comprised theft (furtum), robbery with violence (rapina), wrongful damage to prop- 
erty (damnum injuria), and wrongful damage to the person or reputation of a free- 
man (injuria). 
These obligations were classified as es probably because the object of the obliga- 
tion was the acquisition of a thing, viz., the sum payable by way of compensation 
for the wrong. Rights to the acquisition of things are distinguished generally in 
Roman law as res incorporales. (Inst. 1, 2, 2.) 
Q. 9. What were the various remedies open to the owner of a stolen article? 
A. The remedies were (1) the actio furti for the recovery of a penalty, which was 
four times the amount of the loss in the case of manifest theft and twice that 
amount in the case of nonmanifest theft; and (2) either a real action (vindicatio) 
for the recovery of the stolen propery or a personal action (condictio) for its value, 
   
-P-A-G-E-577
  LEGAL EDUCATION IN EUROPE. 545 
The owner, however, could not in general bring the actio furti where the thing, 
having been in the possession of another person, had been stolen from him; for as 
the latter was usually liable to the owner, and was therefore the party interested in 
the safety of the thing, it was he, and not the owner, who was entitled to sue for 
the penalty. But the other remedies belonged to the owner in every case. The real 
action for the recovery of the stolen article might be brought against the thief or 
any other person in whose possession it might be; the personal action for the valuo 
could be brought only against the thief or his heirs. It was contrary to principle to 
allow the plaintiff the choice of either a real or a personal action, but in the case of 
stolen goods this was allowed in odio furum. (Inst. rv, 1.) 
Q. 10. Translate with brief notes: Idem juris est, si rem sacram aut religiosam, 
quam humani juris esse credebat, vel publicam, que usibus populi perpetuo exposita 
sit, ut forum vel theatrum, vel liberuam hominem, quem servum esse credebat, vel 
rem, cujus commercium non habuerit, vel rem suam dari quis stipuletur. Nec in 
pendenti erit stipulatio ob id quod publica res in privatum deduci et ex libero servul 
fieri potest et commercium adipisci stipulator potest et res stipulatoris esse desinere 
potest: sed protinus inutilis est. Item contra, licet initio utiliter res in stipulatum 
deducta sit, si postea in earum qua causa de quibus supra dictum est, sine facto 
promissoris devenerit, extinguitur stipulatio. Ac nec statim ab initio talis stipu- 
latio valebit ‘‘Lucium Titium, cum servus erit, dare spondes” et similia, quia que 
natura sui dominio nostro exempta sunt in obligationem deduci nullo modo possunt. 
A. “The rule is the same if a person stipulates for a thing sacred or religious which 
he thought to be the subject of commérce, or for a public thing appropriated to the 
use of the people in perpetuity, as a forum or theater, or for a freeman whom he 
thought to be a slave, or for a thing of which he has not the commercium, or for a 
thing belonging to himself. Nor will the stipulation remain in suspense on the 
ground that the public thing may become private, or the freeman may become a 
slave or the stipulator may acquire the commercium of the thing or the thing which 
now belongs to him may cease to be his; but the stipulation is at once void. So, 
conversely, although a thing may have been validly stipulated for originally, if it 
afterwards fall within the description of any of those things before mentioned with- 
out the fault of the promissor, the stipulation is extinguished. And such a stipula-- 
tion as the following, and others of a similar class, are not valid even at the outset: 
‘Po you bind yourself to give Lucius Titius when he shall become a slave?’ for that 
which by its nature is independent of our ownership can not in any way be made 
the subject of an obligation.” 
(Inst. iii, 19, 1,2.) A thing that was extra-commercium, or of which the stipulator 
had not the commercium, could not be the subject of a stipulation, even though the 
stipulator should be ignorant of the fact that the thing was of such a kind; and the 
stipulator had no remedy under the contract against the promissor. And no chango 
of circumstances could give validity to a stipulation that was originally, or subse- 
quently became, void. (Sand., 5th ed., 338.)

out how some of its rules have been influenced by the doctrine of nationality. 
Q. 10. State the circumstances under which an English court will give damages 
for a tort committed abroad. A British vessel comes into collision with an American 
vessel, and proceedings are taken in England by the owners of the British vessel 
against the owners of the American vessel. For the defense it is pleaded (4) that 
the vessel was in charge of a pilot; (2) that the English vessel violated the English 
tule of the road, and in additién (3) the British limitation of liability is claimed. 
Consider the legal effect of these defenses, distinguishing according as the collision 
occurred (a) within, (b) beyond three miles from the English coast.

CHAPTER XV. 
LEGAL EDUCATION IN CANADA, AUSTRALIA, SPANISH 
AMERICA, JAPAN, AND CHINA. 
The information at hand concerning legal education in the autono- 
mous colonies of Great Britain and in the South and Central American 
republics, as well as in Asiatic countries, is meager, if compared with 
the exhaustive statements on that subject from the United States and 
England, France, and other European countries. 
The replies received from these countries were few and incomplete, 
hence resort was had to printed information contained in annual re- 
ports and university catalogues. The fact that the colonies of England 
to a great extent copy the institutions, modes of procedure, and tech- 
nical terms of the mother country enables the reader to supply much 
by inference which it is impossible to state: authoritatively. A few 
essential differences are stated in the following pages.

required age for entering the course. 
(8) University of Sidney.—Law school, Sir William Montgu Manning, chancellor; 
Arthur Renwick, vice-chancellor, Sidney, New South Wales. One professor and 4

of a candidate for the law course. The principal mode of instruction is by lectures. 
Moot courts are held periodically. The degree of Li.B gives a right to admission 
to the bar; in respect to the solicitor’s branch of the legal profession it reduces the 
term of articles from five to three years. 
The university was founded in 1858. Its degrees in art, law, and medicine are rec- 
ognized as on an equality with those of the United Kingdom. 
(4) Queensland.—There are no institutions teaching jurisprudence; persons are 
educated for the legal profession by private study only. In the case of students for 
the bar study in a barrister’s chamber is not necessary, butit is a growing custom for 
such students to read with some practicing barrister for a period of about twelve 
months and act in the capacity of what is called ‘‘devil” to him. Itis the custom 
that such students, even though admitted to the bar, do not practice during such 
period of “deviling.” In the case of candidates for admission as solicitors it is nee- 
essary among other things that they should have served some practicing solicitor as 
an articled clerk for a period of five years. 
Lawyers are divided into (1) barristers; (2) solicitors. There is another grade of 
practitioners who are not numerous and can scarcely be called lawyers, but do legal 
work, i. ¢., conveyancers. In law the professions here are amalgamated; that is to 
say a barrister may practice as a solicitor, or vice versa, but in practice, with but 
rare exceptions, the professions are kept entirely distinct. 
(5) University of New Zealand.—By virtue of the ‘“‘New Zealand University act” 
of 1874, all of the colleges of New Zealand were affiliated to the University of New 
Zealand. Two of these colleges have law departments, as follows: (1) University 
of Otago, Dundee, N. Z., Rev. Donald McNaughton Stuart, chancellor. Nine pro- 
fessors and 12 lecturers. The course embraces jurisprudence, law of property, con- 
stitutional history, and law. (2) Canterbury College, Christ Church, N. Z., Sir 
James Hector, chancellor. Five professors and 3 lecturers. The course embraces 
jurisprudence, constitutional history, Roman law, international law, contracts, and 
torts. 
Both courses extend over a period of three years, six months in the year. It is 
required that an applicant to these courses must have ‘“‘kept two terms” at one of 
the affiliated colleges. After graduation a professional examination is necessary in 
order to become a practitioner. :

  LEGAL EDUCATION IN SPANISH AMERICA. Dae 
III.—SPaNisH AMERICA. 
A Mexico.—Higher education is offered in colleges for professional instruction, but 
there is no university of note in Mexico, There are among the colleges several 
schools of law (in 1875 an official report [the latest available] enumerated 33 of such 
schools). The course generally followed in the leading law schools is as follows: 
Natural law, Roman law, Mexican law, constitutional law, administrative law, inter- 
national and maritime law, penal legislation, civil and criminal procedure, legis- 
lation compared, medical jurisprudence, political economy. 
B. Costa Rica.—By presidential decree of March 2, 1891, it was ordered that a 
provisional school of law should be opened in San Jose. The ancient school of law 
was abolished in 1890 when the University of St. Thomas was reéstablished. This 
university has not begun its functions as yet because its statutes have yet to receive 
congressional sanction. To the course in legal studies are annexed courses in phi- 
losophy and literature. The provisional school of law is under the control of the 
council of advocates which formulates the list of professors. During the mutations 
that have taken place in past years in the University of St. Thomas, there were 
efforts made to continue the law course, and by decree of August 22, 1888, these 
classes were reunited. The course formulated at that date included civil law, Roman 
law, public law, administrative law, mercantile law, civil and criminal procedure, 
international law, natural and criminal law, forensic oratory, and political economy. 
Whether the new reéstablishment continued all these branches is not known. It is 
stated, however, that but few students were admitted to the course in 1888-89, and 
that the future of the legal faculty or school depended somewhat upon its continu- 
ance as a private institution supported by the aforementioned council, or whether 
it be made public by making it subject to the department of education. 
C. Colombia.—According to the ‘Informe del Ministro de Instruccion Publica, 
1888,” the University of Antioquia has among its faculties that of jurisprudence and 
political science. The course of study includes Roman law and history, civil law of 
the United States of Colombia (two courses), comparative mercantile law, interna- 
tional law (public and private), public law of ancient and modern nations with 
their bearing on the public law of Colombia, political economy, statistics and ele- 
mentary knowledge of public property. The number of law students is not given, 
but the total number of students in the university was 222. 
Courses in law were also found in the ‘‘Colegio Academico de Pasto,” which has 
a class of law students, and in the “‘ Seminario Conciliar de la Dioceses,” which offers 
a course in canonical law. A private college established in 1841 in Barranquilla, in 
the Department of Bolivar, which is not affiliated with the national university, has 
faculties of literature, philosophy, and jurisprudence. The “Colegio de la Esper- 
anza,” which has been united with the national university, has a course in jurispru- 
dence. The ‘‘ Colegio del Departmento de Bolivar” has six pupils studying law. 
They studied the institutes of Roman law, Roman history, philosophy of law, public’ 
and private international law, political economy, statistics, and elementary knowl- 
edge of laws appertaining to public property (hacienda publica). 
The ‘Universidad Catolica de Bogota,” founded in 1884, has, according to its 
founder’s wishes, four faculties, but up to date only those of philosophy and letters 
and law are in operation. The examinations in 1888 in this university indicated that 
a high standard of excellence is expected, for only 2 students passed in political 
economy, 7 in Spanish law, 4 in civil law, 4 in criminal law, and 4 in the national 
code. There were other students, but they failed in examination. The ‘Colegio 
Mayor de Nuesta Sefiora del Rosario Bogota” had a regular course of law studies; 
19 students of Roman law, 37 of philosophy of law, 38 of public law, 27 of civil law 
(first term), 18 in second term; 14 of mercantile law, 56 of international law, 22 
of criminal law, 27 of court procedure, 30 of canonical law. The usual classes in 
Spanish law and political economy were not open during 1888.
-P-A-G-E-586
  
  554 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
Thus it is seen that the people of the United States of Colombia (3,879,600, accord- 
ing to the census of 1881) bestow much importance upon the study of law, as it is 
found not only in the universities, but also im minor colleges and private institutions. 
D. Venezuela.—According to the ‘Memoria del Ministro de Instruccion Publica, 
1891,” the faculty of political sciences in the Central University of Venezuela and 
that of political sciences in the University of the Andes have the following courses: 
The Central University has Roman law, public law, ecclesiastical law, Spanish law, 
international law, civil and commercial codes, principles of legislation, administra- 
tive and penal law, and military law. The course extends over five years. The 
students of the first class numbered 47, those of the third class 22, those of the fifth 
class 26. The number of bachelors of political sciences mentioned in the year 1889-90 
was 21. 
The University of the Andes reported courses in Roman law, 13 students; Spanish 
and canonical law, 13 students; commercial code, 22 students; international law, 
22 students; political economy, 14 students, and code of procedure 14 students. 
Between the dates of September 12, 1889, and November 15, 1890, 5 students received 
the degree of bachelor of political sciences and 8 that of doctor of political sciences 
in the University of the Andes. 
E. Ecuador.—According to the ‘‘Informe del Ministro de Negocios Ecclesiasticos, 
Instruccion Publica, Justicia, Beneficencia y Caridad y Estodistica de 1892,” the fac- . 
ulty of jurisprudence in the Central University of Ecuador has classes in civil law, 
including Roman law, Spanish law, and laws of Ecuador (47 students); canonical 
law, including public ecclesiastical law and history of the general councils (47 stu- 
dents); political economy and general legislation (with 11 students of the fourth 
class and 19 of the third class); constitutional and administrative science, including 
international Jaw (30 students); criminal code and practice, commercial law, military 
code, «nd mercantile procedure (29 students). The completion of these law courses 
covers six years, The total number of students is not given, the same names being 
reproduced in different legal branches. In the departments of Aznay and Guayas 
there are complete law faculties mentioned. It isssurmised that the students of these 
so-called university corporations go to the Central University at Quito to obtain 
their degrees. [This method is found in Spain, where the students from the minor 
universities go for such purpose to the Central University at Madrid.] These pro- 
vincial university courses are as follows: The ‘‘Corporacion Universitaria del Azmay” 
has a six years’ course in jurisprudence; the first and second courses inclade civil law 
of the country compared with Roman law and fhe history of the laws of other coun- 
trics. The third and fourth courses include public law, constitutional and adminis- 
trative science, and politicaleconomy. The fifth and sixth courses include law prac- 
tice, commercial, penal, and military codes, civil and criminal practice, also canoni- 
ical law. 
The “‘Corporacion Universitaria del Guayas” has also a six years’ course in law. 
The branches for the first and second years are civil laws ef Ecuador, Roman and 
Spanish laws, canonical and public ecclesiastical laws. The third and fourth years 
include international law, constitutional and administrative science, political econ- 
omy, civil and penal legislation. The fifth and sixth years take up the codes, i. e., 
practice in civil and criminal law, penal, military, and mining laws, commercial and 
special laws. The students in law are not enumerated, but there are 485 taking 
higher studies. 
F. Brazil.—Higher education is controlled by the Central Government,-which main- 
tains two schools of law, two of medicine, four military, and one naval school, a 
school of mines, and a polytechnic, with a total scholarship of 2,916 in 1890. For stu- 
dents of law the following three courses are prescribed by law, under date of January 
2, 1891: Science of jurisprudence; science of government and administrative law; 
preparation fer notarial work. 
The course in science of jurisprudence embraces the following: Philosophy and 
history of law; common and constitutional law; Roman law; criminal law, includ-  
-P-A-G-E-587
  LEGAL EDUCATION IN SPANISH AMERICA. 555 
ing military law; civil law; commercial law, including maritime law; medical juris- 
prudence; criminal, civil, and commercial procedure; court practice (practice in 
pleading); history of national law; essentials of political economy and adminis- 
- trative law. This course is divided into four terms, followed by examinations, as fql- 
lows: First, philosophy and history of law; common and constitutional law. 
Second, Roman law; civillaw; commercial law; criminallaw. Third, medical juris- 
prudence; civil law, continued; commercial law, continued. Fourth, history of 
national law; criminal, civil, and commercial law; essentials of political economy 
and administrative law; court practice (practice in pleading). 
The course in science of government and administrativelaw embraces the following: 
Philosophy and history of law; common law; constitutional law; international law; 
diplomatic law and history of treaties; science of administration and administrative 
law; political economy; science of finances and accounts of state; public hygiene; 
comparing of legislative acts which relate to private law. The above course is 
divided into three terms, followed by examinations, as follows: First, the same as in 
the science of jurisprudence. Second, international law; diplomatic law and history 
of treaties; politicaleconomy; public hygiene. Third, science of administration and 
administrative law; science of finances and accounts of state; comparing of legisla- 
tive acts which relate to private law. 
The course for notaries is divided into two terms, followed by examinations, as 
follows: First, explanation of state constitutional and administrative law; explana- 
tion of state criminal, civil, and commercial law. Sccond, explanation of state law 
procedure ; court practice. 
It will be noticed that the study of science of jurisprudence covers four terms, 
that of science of government and administrative law three terms, while for stu- 
dents preparing for notarial work only two terms are prescribed. It is reasonable 
to suppose that by term is meant a year. 
The same law establishes chairs for teaching the above courses. 
G. Perw.—At Lima the oldest university in America, “Universidad de San Mar- 
cos,” teaches jurisprudence, medicine, political science, theology, and applied science. 
A statement of the course in jurisprudence and other details are not available. 
H. Bolivia.—This country has five universities, in which law, medicine, and theol- 
ogy are taught, with a total of 1,384 students and 83 professors. 
I. Uruguay.—The “Universidad de la Republica” at Montevideo, sometimes called 
the University of Montevideo, is reported in the ‘“Anuario Estadistico del Uruguay, 
1889,” as having 14 professors and 147 students in the faculty of law and social 
sciences. The course of study, according to the ‘ Laws and Regulations for Higher 
Studies,” published in 1890, covers a five years’ period, and issubdivided as follows: 
First ye Philosophy of law, Roman law, civil law (first course), constitutional 
law (first course). 
Second year: Civil law (second course), constitutional law (second course), penal 
law (first course), public international law. 
Third year: Civil law (third course), penal law (second course), political economy 
(first course), commercial law (first course), judicial proceedings (first course).

mercial law (second course), judicial proceeding (second course), forensic practice 
(first course). 
Fifth year: Administrative law, private international law, medical law, forensic 
practice (second course), 
A general examination and the writing of a thesis are obligatory for all students 
who desire to graduate from the legal course. The general examinations for obtain- 
ing the degrees doctor in law and social science, which indicate completion of the 
law eourse, are divided into three parts: (1) A theoretical examination in civil, 
commercial, and penal laws, which lasts an hour. (2) A practical examination in 
the composition of legal documents, which lasts two hours, and one-half hour’s ex-

amination in the studies pursued in legal proceedings and forensic prectice. (3) A 
thesis upon a theme selected from the four to twelve subjects suggested by the dexn 
of the faculty, this thesis not to be longer than fifty printed pages. 
“In the university the degree of licentiate is only recognized by a simple certifi- 
cate indicating the following of a certain course of study. The council of higher 
instruction can require an entire completion of the course before the degree of 
doctor is allowed. The university also confers the degree of bachelor when the 
proper examinations have been passed and a thesis written. The preponderance of 
students in 1889 was found among those studying civil law (136), while only 7 
were studying administrative laws. The general average was between 30 and 50 
students in the various legal branches, 
K. Argentine Republic.—Legal education in the Argentine Republic is given in the 
two universities of Cordoba and Buenos Ayres. The ‘Universidad Nacional de 
Cordoba” was founded in 1622 (its legal: faculty created in 1767), and the ‘Univer- 
sidad Nacional de Buenos Aires” on August 9, 1821. The national laws give the 
most complete autonomy to each university. Both universities have faculties of © 
law and social sciences, of medicine, of physical and mathematical sciences. The 
courses in the faculties of law and social sciences last five years, and the studies 
comprise preparatory legal studies, civil law, international law, Roman law, crim- 
inal law, commercial law, constitutional and administrative law, ecclesiastical law, 
procedure, political economy, finances, philosophy of law and mining, legislation 
(independent course). 
Each branch is in charge of a single professor, except civil and international law 
(public and private), which have each two professors. The number of law pro- 
fessors in the faculty of law and social science is 15 in each university. The 
term commences on the first Monday of March and terminates on the 15th of 
November. The special examinations last till the middle of the month following. 
The general examinations are divided into three parts, commencing with the 15th 
of February. All the faculties require for admission a certificate of six prepara- 
tory years in the national colleges, so that the majority of pupils entering the uni- 
versity are from 16 to 20 years of age. 
The lessons, generally, are in the form of conferences the pupils are questioned, 
and are ofttimes requested to present anv difficult points which they may have en- 
countered, while other students give the benefit of their views on the subject under 
consideration. The ‘Memoria del Ministro de Justicid, culto é Instruccion Publica, 
1890,” presents the following facts for the year 1889-90. In 1889 the university at 
Cordoba had 46 students in the faculty of law and social science, and 929 lectures 
were given. The number of diplomas given was 2 as doctor of jurisprudence, and 
2as lawyer. The new plan of studies, sanctioned by the faculty, separated finance 
and political economy; added two professors for lectures in civil law to the section 
of the philosophy of law; separated the theoretical study of procedure from the 
instruction and practice in code of mining laws (making the latter an independent 
course), and added a course in the philosophy of law to the fifth year. 
The examinations at the close of each term, according to decision of the faculty 
on August 19, 1889, were to be as follows : 
First term: Civil, Roman, penat, and commercial law, procedure and private in- 
ternational law. Seeond term: Canonical law, public international lasy, constitu- 
tional law, political economy, finances, philosophy of law, administrative law, and 
preparation for law study. Third term: Forensic practice. 
In the university at Buenos Ayres the number of students for 1889 in the faculty 
of law and social sciences was 238—i. e., first year 114, second year 47, third year 
30, fourth year 42, fifth year 5. In addition there were 33 “hearers.” The number 
of lectures was 996, or an average of 71.14 for each professor. The large number of 
students at this younger university, as compared with that of Cordeba, is due to the 
factthat the university is situated at the capital of the Republic, which city has 
 
-P-A-G-E-589
  
LEGAL EDUCATION IN. JAPAN. a 557 
400,000 inhabitants, while Cordoba has only about 40,000, and life in a small city 
has not as many attractions for the student. 
The diplomas given at Buenos Ayres were 40 to law graduates and 37 to doctors in 
jurisprudence. The course of study is referred to above, and doubtless does not 
differ much from that presented for the older university. 
L. Chile.—According to the ‘‘Memoria del Ministro de Justicia 6 Instruccion Pub- 
lica, 1890,” the University of Chile, which now constitutes the university section of the 
“Instituto Nacional” at Santiago, had the following number of law students in its 
courses in 1889: First year of the course, 116 students and 47 ‘‘hearers;” second 
year, 94 students; third year, 79students; fourth year, 53 students and 1 “‘hearer;” 
fifth year, 47 students; special classes, 159 students;.total, 584 students and 48 
“hearers.” 
The examination in the law faculty brought about the following result: Passed 
with high honors, 105; passed, 1,238; failed to pass, 250; total, 1,593. Receiving 
university degrees: Bachelor in law, 68; licentiate inlaw, 76. 
The studies in the faculty of laws and political sciences were as follows: 
First year: Naturallaw, Roman law, civil code (first year). 
Second year: Civil code (second year), canonical law, political economy. 
Third year: Civil code, international law, penal code. 
Fourth year: Forensic practice, commercial law, constitutional law. 
Fifth year: Forensic practice, mining law (from March to July), criminal code _ 
and practice (August to December), administrative law. 
Such is the course as at present constituted, but able writers state that this course 
is not considered quite satisfactory, as comparative law, history of law, and political 
sciences receive but little attention. Forthisreason the minister of public instruction, 
Sr. D. Julio Bofiados Espinosa, presented a new plan of studies to the council of 
public instruction at date of April 29, 1889, for, as he aptly said, the present course 
lacks a scientific basis. Whether the course suggested will be carried out remains 
to be seen. {taims to give greater insight into the laws of all countries, and includes 
history of law and political sciences, fundamentals of comparative law, statistical 
and geographical economics, maritime laws, parliamentary and political history of 
Chile and America, and sociology. 
IV.—Japan, 
In order to understand the course of legal education offered in the Japanese Uni- 
versity, it seems necessary to preface it by an exposition of the legal institutions 
and conditions of that country. We quote Basil Hall Chamberlain’s ‘Things 
Japanese ” (London, 1890): 
“Dutifully obedient to authority and not naturally litigious, the Japanese are 
nevertheless becoming a nation of lawyers. No branch of study is more popular 
than law with the young men of the new generation. It seems to have for them a 
sort of abstract and theoretical interest, for Japanese law has at no time been the 
genuine outcome of the national life, as English law, for instance, is the outcome of 
English national life—a historical development fitting itself to the needs of the na- 
tion as a well-made glove fits the hand. Twelve hundred years ago Japan borrowed 
Chinese law wholesale. Sheis borrowing French and German law wholesale to-day. 
There are now two parties, a procodification party and an anticodification™ party. 
The former is the party in power, being backed by the statesmen who see in Euro- 
pean codes for Japan a prerequisite of fair treatment of Japan by European nations. 
The point of view of the anticodification party is: ‘Japan for the Japanese. 
Our laws must suit’ our people. They must not be mere handles for obtaining 2 
treaty revision. Wait to codify until the national courts, interpreting national 
 
-P-A-G-E-590
558 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
needs, shall have evolved precedents of their own. French and German codes.are 
alien things, mechanically superimposed on our Japanese ways of thought and 
modes-of life, which are not in touch with foreign civilizations and the laws that 
have sprung from them.” 
Which of these parties is im the right? The anticodification party founds itself 
on history, on natural development. On the other hand, might it not be plausibly 
argued that wholesale imitation and the adoption of foreign ways having always 
been Japan’s method of proceeding, and being therefore a sort of inverted original- 
ity of her own, the procodificationists are, in effect, more truly inheritors of the 
national tradition than the so-called nationalists? It is, of course, out of the ques- 
tion that any opinion we, as, ignorant laymen, may hold on such a subject can be 
worth anything. Our only object is to present both sides, and to present them 
briefly. 
The new codes resulting from the legislative activity of the present reign are: (1) 
The criminal code and the code of criminal procedure, drafted by M. Boissonnade 
de Fontarabie on the basis of theCode Napoleon, with modifications suggested by the 
old Japanese criminal law; these were published in 1880and came into force in 1882; 
(2) the civil code, the code of civil procedure, and the commercial code, which are 
on the eve of publication. Though not actually entitled codes, we may also include: 
(3) The constitution with its attendant laws regarding the imperial house, the diet, 
and finance; (4) the laws for the exercise of local self-government, and (5) divers 
“statutes on miscellancous subjects, one of the most important of which is banking. 
Crimes, as classified_in the Japanese criminal code, are of three kinds, namely, 
(1) erimes against the state or the Imperial family, and in violation of the public 
credit, policy, peate, health, etc.; (2) crimes against person and property; (3) police 
offenses. There is in addition a subdivision of (1) and (2) into major and minor 
crimes. : < 
The punishment for major crimes are: (1) death, by hanging; (2) deportation, 
with or without hard labor, for life or fora termof years; (3) imprisonment, with or 
without hard labor, for life or for a termof years. The punishment for minor crimes 
includes confinement, with or without hard labor, and fines. Thepunishments for 
police offenses are detention for from one to ten days without hard labor, and 
fines varying from 5 sen to $1.95. The court which tries persons accused of major 
crimes consists of three judges, that for minor crimes of one judge, and that for 
police offenses of one juge de paix*. Capital punishments are carried out in the 
presence of a procurator. They now are extremely rare. Criminals condemned to 
deportation are generally sent to the Island of Yezo, where they sometimes work in 
the mines. The ordinary prisons are situated in various parts of the Empire, and 
number one hundred and ninety-three. 
A person who has suffered injury by crime lodges his ei at a police office, 
or with the procurator of any court having jurisdiction over the crime in question. 
Policemen can arrest an offender whose crime was committed in their presence, or 
which the complainant avers to have actually seen committed. In all other cases 
they can arrest by warrant only. Bail is allowed at the discretion of the judge, but 
only after reference to the procurator who has taken up the case. Accused persons 
are often kept in prison for-a considerable time before trial, and no lawyer is allowed 
to be present at the preliminary examination, which also is often long delayed. 
February, 1890, witnessed the passing of a new law relative to the organization of 
judicial courts—a law embodying, indeed, the usage developed since the establish- 
ment of the courts in 1872, but introducing certain changes borrowed rather from 
German than from French sources. -It is to come into force in November of the same 
year. 
  
*The system being French, it seems advisable to retain the French terms in cases 
where there is no exact or no generally current English equivalent. 
 
-P-A-G-E-591
  LEGAL EDUCATION IN JAPAN. ‘BSS. 
The history and nature of modern Japanese legal institutions are, very briefly, as 
follows: Down to 1872 the judicial department had united in itself the functions of 
chief law court and chief executive office for the transaction of judicial business 
throughout the land, the same staff of officials serving for both purposes. In that 
year, however, a separation took place. Judges, procurators, a judicial police for 
the arrest of prisoners, avowés, avocats, and notaries were established, as also sepa- 
rate judicial courts and a law school. The pattern copied was French. Since that 
time numerous changes have taken place. At present the courts are divided into local 
courts (presided over by juges de paix), district or provincial courts, courts of appeal, 
and a supreme court (cour de cassation), all of which have jurisdiction both in crimi- 
nal and civil suits. Each of these courts has branch offices established to accommo- 
date suitors, regard being had to population and to the area of jurisdiction. The 
local courts have jurisdiction over police offenses; the district courts over crimes, be- 
sides acting as courts of preliminary investigation; the appeal courts hear new 
trials; the supreme court hears criminal appeals on matters of law. All crimes of 
whatever sort are subjected to preliminary examination before actual trial. The 
conducting of criminal cases, from the very beginning down to the execution of the 
criminal, if he be condemned to suffer death, rests with the procurator, who unites 
in his own person the functions of public prosecutor and of grand jury. 
The present judiciary consists partly or men trained under the old pro-European 
régime, partly of graduates of the law college of the Imperial University, and of the 
private law colleges, of which there are six in Tokyo and eight altogether in the 
Empire. Aboutathousand young men graduate yearly. Lawyers are bound to pass 
a certain examination before being admitted to practice at the bar; but it is of a 
very theoretical nature, and is likely to be soon revised. The new law concerning 
the constitution of courts requires candidates for judgeships to pass two competitive 
examinations, unless they are graduates of the university, in which case they need 
only pass the second of the two, after having served as probationary judges for a term 
of three years. Judges are appointed for life. Their salaries vary from $700 to $4,000 
perannum. The presidents of courts are, however, more highly remunerated. The 
president of the supreme court receives $5,500, and is of shinnin rank.* The chief 
procurator, who is of chokunin rank, receives $4,000. 
- The system of trial, as well in civil as in criminal cases, is entirely inquisitorial. 
It was so in Old Japan, and is so in France, whence modern Japanese law comes. 
Formerly no convictions were made except on confession by the prisoner. Hence an 
abundant use of torture, now happily abolished, and a tendency, even in civil cases, 
to suspect guilt in the defendant, although the theory is that the defendant must be 
presumed innocent until actually proved to be the contrary. In this characteristic 
Japan but conforms to her continental models, and indeed to the universal usage of 
mankind, with the solitary exception of the English. The judge conducts the trial 
alone. All questions by counsel must be put through him. Counsel do not somuch 
defend their clients as represent them. They even testify for their clients, strange 
as such a thing must sound to English ears. Another peculiarity is that husband 
and wife, parent and child, master and servant are prohibited from appearing as wit- 
nesses against each other. At the same time, they are not entirely excluded from 
the examination. The code of criminal procedure draws a fine distinction, excluding 
them as witnesses, but admitting them as ‘‘referees”—we can think of no better 
equivalent for the difficult Japanese term sankdnin, A sankonin is a witness, and 
yet.not an authoritative witness, a sort of second-rate witness, if one might so phrase 
it. The idea is, of course, that persons thus related are likely to be prejudiced in 
each other’s favor, and that their testimony should accordingly be allowed little 
  
* All officials are classified into four ranks, shinnen, chokunin, sonin, and hannin. 
The shinnin are the highest of all, receiving their nominations from the Mikado him- 
self,

weight in comparison with that of others more probably impartial. Witnesses are 
sworn, though not exactly in the European manner. The oath is rather a solemn 
asservation, and is entirely unconnected with any religious sanction. It is in the 
form of a written document, to which the person sworn affixes his seal. The pro- | 
ceedings at a trial are all committed to writing, but not in the actual words used, as | 
Japanese custom is adverse to the employment of the colloquial for literary purposes. ! 
The gist of the questions and answers is therefore translated into the book style. 
Needless to say that the above is the merest shadowy outline of a vast subject. ' 
Transformed, revolutionized as it has been, Japanese law nevertheless retains not a 
few curious features of its own, which would interest both the legal specialist and 
the student of history and sociology. In departments of legal activity that are not 
yet covered by the new codes, the customary law of an earlier date is still followed. 
Land tenure and all such family matters as succession, marriage, adoption, etc., in 
which it is most difficult to effect sudden changes, belong to this category. 
Since the foregoing was printed three new codes appeared, namely, the civil code, 
the code of civil procedure, and the commercial code. The new civil code, however, 
includes as yet only the laws of things. Traditional Japanese usage still regulates 
such important matters as marriage, succession, adoption, and others belonging to 
the law of persons. The code of civil procedure and the commercial code came into 
force on January 1, 1891, the civil code on January 1, 1892. 
Legal education in Japan.—After having seen how Japan endeavors to copy the law 
practice of European nations, we may proceed to show that in the preparation for the 
profession of law also European models are copied. It will be seen from the follow- 
ing statements that the Japanese have avoided English and American models and 
apply the courses found in the universities on the continent of Europe, although 
they study English law thoroughly. 
The Imperial University at Tokyo is the chief place where legal studies can be 
pursued in Japan. This institution has a college of law with 26 professors and 333 
students (according to University Calendar 1891-92). The university is under the 
control of the minister of education and depends for its revenue upon annual allow- 
ances from the treasury of the Imperial Government. The tuition fees (2} yen, or 
about $2 per month) and other sources of income are allowed to accumulate year by 
year so as to form a large fund, which is touched only in cases of necessity. Tlic 
university confers among other degrees that of hégaka hakushi, or doctor of law, after 
completion of the entire course prescribed. 
The courses of study in the different faculties of the Imperial University are all 
very comprehensive and stated in detail. Those of the law college being of particular. 
interest to the readers of this volume we quote them in full, giving both the subjects 
taught and the time allotted to each. The law college offers two courses, one in law 
and one in politics. To the course in law are added subsidiary courses or sections, 
namely, in English, French, and German law, to be studied in thoso languages, 
respectively,

To the questions submitted to foreign institutions Hon. Charles Denby, United 
States minister to China, to whom a copy was sent, replied under date of January 
8, 1892, from Peking, as follows: 
“¥ have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 14th 
of November, last. Being a lawyer by profession, and acknowledging the debt that 
Lowe to the bar, it will afford me the greatest pleasure to answer the questions 
transmitted by you. 
“An answer, seriatim, is not necessary, because there are no lawyers in China, and 
consequently no school or institution such as are inquired about. Lawyers are not 
permitted to appear in Chinese courts. There are several lawyers at Shanghai who 
practice in the mixed court, Her Britannic Majesty’s court, and the consular courts, 
The mixed court is peculiar to Shanghai-and is held by a Chinese magistrate and a 
 
-P-A-G-E-595

member of one of the consulates. The foreign lawyers are all Englishmen and are 
admitted to the bar before coming to China. There is no American practicing law 
in China. There is a species of legal writer who prepares papers to be filed in the 
courts. His standing is low and he is considered to be disreputable. In the civil 
and criminal courts there is no appearance by attorney. There are noregular forms 
of pleading. The disputations of the parties are oral. 
“The consuls have civil and criminal jurisdiction over their own fellow nationals, 
The proceedings are conducted according to the law of the nationality of the con- 
sul. The law of the United States is administered in the consular courts. Of course, 
this law may be modified by custom, which must be proved like any other fact. The 
Revised Statutes define the law governing the consular courts as being the statutory 
law of the United States, equity, admiralty, and the common law. This system is 
very incomplete. There is no common law applicable to crimes in the United States, 
and there are few United States statutes defining crimes. The States have their own 
codes. The consuls and minister are sometimes worried as to the sources of their 
power, but we usually manage to find authority in the common law. 
“There should be a code of laws applicable to the East, to islands, and to savage 
countries. It would not be difficult of preparation and it would relieve consuls. 
from much doubt and annoyance.”

  CHAPTER XVI. 
COLLEGES OF AGRICULTURE AND THE MECHANIC ARTS! 
INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT. 
The act of the Fifty-first Congress of the United States, approved 
August 30, 1890, providing for the more complete endowment of col- 
lJeges of agriculture and the mechanic arts, has served to call the at- 
tention of the public more directly to these institutions for the agri- 
cultural and industrial education of our youth, and to secure for them 
that recognition and confidence as an integral part of our educational 
system to which their breadth of purpose and the general efficiency of 
their organization have long entitled them. But few will be found 
who are disposed to question the wisdom of the General Govern- 
ment in thus finally and definitely reserving to the people the bene- 
fits of a system for the establishment of which no inconsiderable 
amount of the public funds had already been expended and whose 
success or failure seems destined in no slight degree to affect the indus- 
tries of the country. This act is but another illustration of that enlight- 
ened national policy which sees in the higher education of the citizen 
the strongest bulwark of individual liberty and the greatest safety to 
government itself. 
It is a fact, not to be denied, that for several reasons, until recently, 
the agricultural and mechanical colleges, with a few notable excep- 
tions, have not wholly fulfilled the hopes entertained for them by their 
founders, and this has undoubtedly been due in part to a lack of infor- 
mation on the part of the public as to their facilities and their work; 
in some cases to a lack of understanding, if not a total misunderstand- 
ing, of their true objects and aims, and, in consequence, there has been 
a dearth of interest in their welfare on the part of the communities in 
which they were established. This failure of appreciation has clearly 
impeded their usefulness and retarded their growth. 
It were well indeed, if the fact could be more widely recognized, that 
these colleges are essentially and peculiarly public institutions; few 
establishments in this country can more truly be said to belong to the 
people. While it is true that in some instances private donations and 
bequests have made the State agricultural and mechanical college prac- ° 
tically independent of Government aid, yet these are rare exceptions to 
the general rule. In the majority of the States the money received for 
the college or colleges from the General Government forms by far the 
greater part of their endowment fund; and it is not too much to say, 
that of all such colleges now in existence in the United States, there 
are none which would not be able to continue upon a fair working basis

if all other funds available for purposes of instruction were withdrawn. 
This statement, however, is not to be taken as ignoring in any way the 
very material assistance given by the States to these institutions. It 
is only by the consent of the several States that the colleges exist at 
all; and only through the fostering care and the generous policy of the 
State legislatures, have many of those which were established before or 
immediately after the first endowment act of Congress, in 1862, sur- 
vived to enjoy the benefits derived from the endowment act of 1890. 
Thus there is a two-fold reason why the people should regard these 
colleges with distinct favor, and guard their interests with jealous 
pride—they are State as well as national institutions. 
Indeed the State agricultural college may often claim to be regarded as 
the crowning point of the public school system. In many of the States 
this position. has, in truth, been accorded them, in connection with the 
State universities. Itis possible by a system of accredited high schools, 
whose graduates are admitted to the State college upon certificate, and 
_ by the maintaining of district scholarships, as is frequently done, to so 
connect the college with the schools, that a fairly large percentage of 
those who pass through the successive grades of the public schools shall 
be enabled to continue their education in these higher institutions. But 
it is argued thatthe arrangement of the college work to follow by natural 
and logical sequence the course of study pursued in the high schools, 
would imply a lowering of the standard of admission. In the first place, 
this does not necessarily follow, as the experience of Indiana and Michi- 
gan, which have fairly tried the plan, will testify. The first effect of such 
a continuity of work is to raise the standard of the high school. Again it 
is a question whether some of our endowed colleges have not lost sight of 
the fact, that the real raison @ étre of their endowment, is to make possible 
the higher industrial education of those whose preparation must necessa-" 
rily be limited to such instruction as the public schoolaffords. The terms 
of the acts of Congress are express and unmistakable upon this point. 
It was to meet the needs of those to whom a course at the average 
college and university was as impracticable as it was unsatisfactory, 
that these liberal donations on the part of the General Government 
were made, and to them peculiarly should the advantages and benefits 
of these schools be accessible. 
Congress, by acts passed in 1862 and 1890 (the text of whichis sub- 
sequently given in this chapter), has made provision for the establish- 
ment and support, in codperation with the States, in every State and 
Territory of the Union, of at least one institution, whose leading object 
shall be to provide instruction in agriculture and the mechanic arts. 
In some of the States two institutions—one for white and one for colored 
students—are thus maintained, although, as will be more fully explained, 
all of the schools for colored students are not recognized as distinct and 
independent organizations. At present sixty colleges so endowed are 
in active operation. The following is a list of these by States:

LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES RELATING TO COLLEGES OF AGRL 
CULTURE AND THE MECHANIC ARTS AND TO AGRICULTURAL EX- 
PERIMENT STATIONS. 
In 1862 the first act of Congress providing for the endowment of col- 
leges of agriculture and mechanic arts was approved by the President 
and became alaw. This act is popularly referred to as “The first Mor- 
rillact,” in honor of Senator Justin 8. Morrill, of Vermont, who assisted. 
in its preparation and presented the bill in Congress, or simply as the 
“Land-grant act of 1862.” As the latter name implies, it provides for 
the donation to the several States of certain public lands of the United 
States in place or scrip—30,000 acres for each Senator and Represent- 
ative in Congress to which they were respectively entitled under the 
census of 1860—the proceeds from the sale of which, invested in stocks 
yielding not less than 5 per cent interest, were to form permanent en- 
dowment funds for the support and maintenance of colleges of agricul- 
ture and the mechanic arts, under certain conditions set forth in the 
act. The act reads as follows: 
THE LAND GRANT ACT OF '62.—‘THE FIRST MORRILL ACT.” 
AW ACT donating public lands to the several States and Territories which may provide colleges for 
the benefit of agriculture and the mechanic arts. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of 
America, in Congress assembled, That there be granted to the several States, for the 
purposes hereinafter mentioned, an amount of public land, to be apportioned to each 
State, a quantity equal to 30,000 acres for each Senator and Representative in Con- 
gress to which the States are respectively entitled by the apportionment under the 
census of 1860: Provided, That no mineral lands shall be selected or purchased under 
the provisions of this act. 
Src. 2. And be it further enacted, That the land aforesaid, after being surveyed, 
shall be apportioned to the several States in sections or subdivisions of sections, 
not less than one-quarter of a section; and wherever there are public lands ina 
State, subject to sale at private entry at one dollar and twenty-five cents per acre, 
the quantity to which said State shall be entitled shall be selected from such lands, 
within the limits of such State; and the Secretary of the Interior is hereby directed 
to issue to each of the States, in which there is not the quantity of public lands 
subject to sale at private entry, at one dollar and twenty-five cents per acre, to 
which said State may be entitled under the provisions of this act, land scrip to the 
amount in acres for the deficiency of its distributive share; said scrip to be sold by 
said States, and the proceeds thereof applied to the uses and purposes.prescribed in 
this act, and for no other use or purpose whatsoever: Provided, That in no case shall 
any State to which land scrip may thus be issued, be allowed to locate the same 
within the limits of any other State, or of any territory of the United States; but 
their assignees may thus locate said land scrip upon any of the unappropriated lands 
of the United States subject to sale at private entry, at one dollar and twenty-five

cents, or less, an acre: And provided further, That not more than one million acres — 
“shall be located by such assignees in any one of the States: And provided further, 
That nosuch location shall be made before one year from the passage of this act. 
Suc. 3. And be it further enacted, That all the expenses of management, superin- 
tendence and taxes from date of selection of said lands, previous to their sales, and 
all expenses.incurred in the management and disbursement ef moneys which may be 
received therefrom, shall be paid by the States to which they may belong, out of 
the Treasury of said States, so that the entire proceeds of the sale of said lands shall 
be applied, without any diminution whatever, to the purposes hereinafter mentioned. 
Sno: 4. And be it further enacted, Thatall moneys derived from the sale of the lands 
aforesaid, by the States to which the lands are apportioned, and from the sales of 
land scrip hereinbefore provided for, shall be invested in stocks of the United States, _ 
or of the States, or some other safe stocks, yielding not less than five per centum 
upon the par value of said stocks; and that the moneys so invested shall constitute 
a perpetual fund, the capital of which shall remain forever undiminished, except so 
far as may be provided in section fifth of fhis act, and the interest of which shall be 
inviolably appropriated, by each State, which may take and claim the benefit of 
this act, to the endowment, support, and maintenance of, at least, one college, where 
’ the leading object shall be, without excluding other scientific and classical studies, 
and including military tactics, to teach such branches of learning as are related to 
agriculture and the mechanic arts, in such manner as the Legislatures of the States 
may respectively prescribe, in order to promote the liberal and practical education 
of the industrial classes in the several pursuits and professions in life. 
Src. 5. And be it further enacted, That the grant of land and land scrip hereby 
authorized shall be made on the following conditions, to which, as well as to the 
provisions hereinbefore contained, the previous assent of the several States shall be 
signified by legislative acts: 
First, If any portion of the fund invested, as provided by the foregoing section, or 
any portion of the interest thereon, shall, by any action or contingency, be dimin- 
ished or lost, it shall be replaced by the State to which it belongs, so that the capi- 
, tal of the fund shall remain forever undiminished; and the annual interest shall be 
regularly applied without diminution to the purposes mentioned in the fourth sec- 
tion of this act, except that a sum, not exceeding ten per centum upon the amount 
received by any State under the provisions of this act, may be expended for the pur- 
chase of lands for sites or experimental farms whenever authorized by the respective 
Legislatures of said States; 
Second, No portion of said fund, nor the interest thereon, shall be applied, directly - 
or indirectly, under any pretense whatever, to the purchase, erection, preservation 
or repair, of any building or buildings; 
Third, Any State which may take and claim the benefit of the provisions of this 
act shall provide, within five year's, at least not less than one college, as prescribed 
in the fourth section of this act, or the grant to such State shall cease; and said 
State shall be bound to pay the United States the amount received of any lands pre- 
viously sold, and that the title to purchasers under the State shall be valid; 
Fourth, An annual report shall be made regarding the progress of each college, 
recording any improvements and experiments made, with their costs and results, and 
such other matters including State industrial and economical statistics, as may be 
supposed useful; one copy of which shall. be transmitted by mail free, by each, to - 
all the other colleges which may be endowed under the provisions of this act, and 
also one copy to the Secretary of the Interior; 
Fifth, When lands shall be selected from those which have been raised to double 
the minimum price in consequence of railroad grants, they shall be computed to the 
States at the maximum price, and the number of acres proportionally diminished;

which scrip shall be issued under this act shall be required to report annually to 
Congress all sales maxle of such scrip until the whole shall be disposed of, the 
amount received for the same, and what appropriation has been made of the 
proceeds. Approved July 2, 1862. 
In 1887 the act known as the “Hatch experiment station act,” so . 
called in honor of Representative Wm. H. Hatch, of Missouri, was 
approved, and by the Fiftieth and Fifty-first Congresses supplementary 
provisions were added thereto. The following is the text of the act 
and of the regulations for franking bulletins and reports:— 
THE HATCH EXPERIMENT STATION ACT. 
[Forty-ninth Congress, Session 2, Chapter 314, March 2, 1887.] 
AN ACT to establish agricultural experiment stations in connection with the colleges established in 
* the several States under the provisions of an act approved July second, eighteen hundred and sixty- 
two, and of the acts supplementary thercto. 2 
Srcrion 1. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
_ States of America in Congress assembled, That in order to aid in acquiring and diffus- 
ing among the people of the United States useful and practical information on 
subjects connected with agriculture, and to promote scientific investigation and 
experiment respecting the principles and applications of agricultural science, there 
shall be established, under direction of the college or colleges, or agricultural de- 
partment of colleges, in each State or Territory established, or which may hereafter 
be established in accordance with the provisions of an act approved July second, 
eighteen hundred and sixty-two, entitled ‘‘An act donating public lands to the 
several states and territories which may provide colleges for the benefit of agricul- 
ture and the mechanic arts,” or any of the supplements of said act, a department to 
be known and designated as an, “agricultural experiment station:” Provided, That 
in any State or Territory in which two such colleges have been or may be so estab- 
lished, the appropriation hereinafter made to such State or Territory shall be equally 
divided between such colleges, unless the legislature of such state or territory shall 
otherwise direct. 
Suc. 2. That it shall be the object and duty of said experiment stations to con- 
duct original researches or verify the experiments on the physiology of plants and 
animals; tho diseases to which they are severally subject, with the remedies for the 
same; the-chemical composition of useful plants at their different stages of growth; 
the comparative advantages of rotative cropping as pursucd under a va 
of crops; the capacity of new plants or trees for acclimation; the analy 
and water; the chemical composition of manures, natural or artificial, with experi- 
ments designed to test their comparative effects on crops of different kinds; the 
adaptation and value of grasses and forage plants; the composition and digestibility

States as may in each case be deemed advisable, having due regard to the varying 
conditions and needs of the respective state or territories. 
Src. 3. That in order to secure as far as practicable uniformity of methods and 
results in the work of said stations it shall be the duty of the United States com- 
missioner of agriculture to furnish forms, as far as practicable, for the tabulation of 
results of investigation or experiments; to indicate, fromtime to time, such lines of 
inquiry as to him shall seem most important; and in general, to furnish such advice 
and assistance as will best promote the purposes of this act. It shall be the duty 
of each of said stations annually, on or before the first day of February, to make to 
the governor of the state or territory in which it is located, a full and detailed re- 
port of its operations, including a statement of receipts and expenditures, a copy of 
which report shall be sent to each of said stations, to the said commissioner of agri- 
culture, and to the secretary of the treasury of the United States. 
Sec, 4. That bulletins or reports of progress shall be published at said stations 
at least once in three months, one copy of which shall be sent to each newspaper in 
the States and territories in which they are respectively located, and to such indi- 
viduals actually engaged in farming as may request the same, and as far as the 
means of the station will permit. Such bulletins or reports, and the annual reports 
of said stations, shall be transmitted in the mails of the United States free of charge 
for postage, under such regulations as the postmaster general may from time to time 
prescribe. 
Src. 5. That for the purpose of paying the necessary expenses of conducting in-

specially provided for by Congr n the appropriations from year to year, and to 
each territory entitled under the provisions of section eight of this act, out of any 
money in the treasury proceeding from the sales of public lands, to be paid in equal 
quarterly payments on the first day of January, April, July and October ineach year, 
to the treasurer or other officer duly appointed by the governing boards of said 
colleges to receive the same, the first payment to be made on the first day of Octo- 
ber, 1887: Provided, however, That out of the first annual appropriation so received 
by any station an amonnt not exceeding one-fifth may be expended in the erection, 
enlargement or repair of a building or buildings necessary for carrying on the work 
of such station; and thereafter an amount not exceeding five per centum of such 
annual appropriation may be so expended. 
Suc. 6. That whenever it shall appear to the secretary of the treasury from the 
annual statement of receipts and expenditures of any of said stations, that a portion 
of the preceding annual appropriation remains unexpended, such amount shall be 
deducted from the next succeeding annual appropriation to such station, in order 
that the amount of money appropriated to any station shall not exceed the amount 
actually and necessarily required for its maintenance and support.

relation existing between any of the said colleges and the government of the States 
or Territories in which they are respectively located. 
Sec. 8. That in States having colleges entitled under this section to the benefits 
of this act, and having also agricultural experiment stations established by law sep- 
arate from said colleges, such States shall be authorized to apply such benefits to 
experiment stations so established by such States; and in case any State shall have 
established, under the provisions of said act of July second, aforesaid, an agricul- 
tural department or experimental station in connection with any university, college 
or institution not distinctively an agricultural college or school, and such State 
shall have established, or shall hereafter establish a separate agricultural college or 
school, which shall have connected therewith an experimental farm or station, the 
Legislature of such State may apply in whole or in part the appropriation by this 
act made to such separate agricultural college or school; and no Legislature shall, 
by contract express or implied, disable itself from so doing. 3 s

tutions mentioned in this act, but Congress may at any time amend, suspend or re- 
- peal any or all of the provisions of this act. 
[Fifticth Congress, Session 2, chapter 373, Mar. 2, 1889.] 
In the appropriation for experiment stations it is Provided, That as far as prac- 
ticable, all such stations shall devote a portion of their work to the examination 
and Classification of the soils of their respective States. and Territories, with a view 
to securing more extended knowledge and better development of their agricultural 
capabilities. 
[Fifty-first Congress, Session 1, Chap. 707, July 14, 1890.] 
In the appropriation for Agricultural Experiment Stations it is provided that the 
sums appropriated to the several States shall be paid quarterly, in advance. 
FRANKING BULLETINS AND REPORTS. 
Src. 419. Postal laws and regulations. Regulations for free transmission of bul- 
Jetins and reports under the preceding statute, are prescribed as follows: 
1. Any claimant of the privilege must apply for authority to exercise it to the 
Postmaster-General, stating the date of the establishment of such station, its proper 
name or designation, its official organization and the names of its officers, the name 
of the university, college, school, or institution to which it is attached, if any, the 
legislation of the State or Territory providing for its establishment, and any other 
granting it the benefits of the provision made by Congress as aforesaid (accompa- 
nied by a copy of the act er acts), and whether any other such station in the same 
State or Territory is considered, or claims to be, also entitled to the privilege; and 
also the place of its location and the name of the post-office where the bulletins 
and reports will be mailed. The application must be signed by the officer in charge 
of the station. 
2. If such application be allowed after examination by the Department, the post- 
master at the proper office will be instructed to admit such bulletins and reports to 
the mails in compliance with these regulations, ani the officer in charge of the sta- 
tion will be notified thereof. 
3. Only such bulletins or reports as shall have been issued after the station became 
entitled to the benefits of the act can be transmitted free; and such bulletins or re- 
ports may be inclosed in envelopes or wrappers, sealed or unsealed. On the exterior 
of every envelope, wrapper or package, must be written or printed the name of the 
station and place of its location, the designation of the inclosed bulletin or report, 
and the word ‘‘Free” over the signature or fac simile thereof of the officer in charge

purpose. There may also be written or printed upon the envelope or wrapper, a 
request that the postmaster at the office of delivery will notify the mailing station 
of the change of address of the addressee, or other reason for inability to deliver the 
same; and upon a bulk package, a request to the postmaster to open and distribute 
the “franked” matter therein, in accordance with the address thereon.

department, may also be adopted and mailed by the several stations, with their own 
publications, under the same regulations; and any bulletins or reports mailable free 
by any Agricultural Experiment Station under these regulations, may be so mailed 
- by any other station having free mailing authority. 
If such station’s annual reports be printed by State huthority, and consist in part 
of matter relating to the Land Grant College to which such station is attached, 
then said report may be mailed free entire, by the director of the Station: Provided, © 
In his judgment, the whole consists of useful information of an agricultural char- 
acter. 
The bulletins may be mailed to the stations, newspapers, or persons to whom 
they are by the foregoing act authorized to be sent, and the annual reports to any 
address within the United States. 
On August 30, 1890, the last provision made by Colmes in aid of 
colleges of Pang and the mechanic arts was approved. This act, 
which may be called the Additional Endowment of 1890, or the ‘“Sec- 
ond Morrill act,” receiving its name from the same distinguished gen- 
‘ tleman, is intended as supplementary to the land grant of 1862, and is 
as follows: 
ADDITIONAL ENDOWMENT OF 1890 
[Fifty first Congress, Session 1, Chapter 841, Ang. 30, 1890.] 
An acr to apply a portion of the proceeds of the public lands to the more complete endowment and 
support of the colleges for the benefit of agriculture and the mechanic arts established under the 
provisions of an act of Congress approved July second, eighteen hundred and sixty-two. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America 
in Congress assembled, That there shall be, and hereby is, annually appropriated, out 
of any monéy in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, arising from the sale of 
public lands, to be paid as hereinafter provided, to each State and Territory for the 
more complete endowment and maintenance of colleges for the benefit of agriculture 
and the mechanic arts now established, or which may be hereafter established, in 
accordance with an act of Congress approved July second, eighteen hundred and 
sixty-two, the sum of fifteen thousand dollars for the year ending June thirtieth, 
eighteen hundred and ninety, and an annual increase of the amount of such appro- 
priation thereafter for ten years by an additional sum of one thousand dollars over 
the preceding year, and the annual amount to be paid thereafter to each State and 
Territory shall be twenty-five thousand dollars to be applied. only to instruction in 
agriculture, the mechanic arts, the English language and the various branches of 
mathematical, physical, natural and economic science, with special reference to their 
applications in the industries of life, and to the facilities for such instruction: Pro- 
vided, ‘That no money shall be paid out under this act to any State or Territory for 
the support and maintenance of a college where a distinction of race or-color is made 
in the admission of students, but the establishment and maintenance of such colleges 
separately for white and colored students shall be held to be a compliance with the 
provisions of this act if the funds received in such State or Territory be equitably 
divided as hereinafter set forth: Provided, That in any State in which there has been 
one college established in pursuance of the act of July second, eighteen hundred. 
and sixty-two, and also in which an educational institution of like character has 
been established, or may be hereafter established, and is now aided by such State 
from its own revenue, for the education of colored students in agriculture and the 
mechanic arts, however named or styled, or whether or not it has received money 
heretofore undef the act to which this act is an amendment, the Legislature of such 
State may propose and report to the Secretary of the Interior a just and equitable 
division of the fund to be received under this act between one college for white 
students and one institution for colored students established as aforesaid, which 
ship epee
-P-A-G-E-620
  588 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
shall be divided into two parts and paid accordingly, and thereupon such institution 
for colored students shall be entitled to the benefits of this act and subject to its 
provisions, as much as it would have been if it had been included under the act of 
eighteen hundred and sixty-two, and the fulfillment of the foregoing provisions 
shallbe taken as a complianve with the provision in reference to separate colleges 
for white and colored students. 
Sec. 2. That the sums hereby appropriated to the States and Territories for the 
further endowment and support of colleges shall be annually paid on or before the 
thirty-first day of July of each year, by the Secretary of the Treasury, upon the 
warrant of the Secretary of the Interior, out of the treasury of the United States, to the 
state or territorial treasurer, or to such officer as shall be designated by the laws 
of such State or Territory to receive the same, who shall, upon the order of the 
trustees of the college, or the institution for colored students, immediately pay over 
said sums to the treasurers of the respective colleges or other institutions entitled 
to receive the same, and such treasurers shall be required to report to the Secretary 
of Agriculture and to the Secretary of the Interior, on or before the first day of 
September of each year, a detailed statement of the amount so received and of its 
disbursement. The grants of moneys authorized by this act are made subject to the 
legislative assent of the several States and Territories to the purpose of said grants: 
Provided, That payments of such installments of the appropriation herein made as 
shall become due to any State before the adjournment of the regular session of the 
legislature mecting next after the passage of this act shall be made upon the assent 
of the Governor thereof, duly certified to the Secretary of the Treasury. 
Src. 3. That if any portion of the moneys received by the designated officer of the 
State or Territory for the further and more complete endowment, support, and main- 
tenance of colleges, or of institutions for colored siudents, as provided in this act, 
shall, by any action, or contingency, be diminished or lost, or be misapplied, it shall 
be replaced by the State or Territory to which it belongs, and until so replaced no 
subsequent appropriation shall be apportioned or paid to such State or Territory; 
and no portion of said moneys shall be applied, directly or indirectly, under any 
pretense whatever, to the purchase, erection, preservation, or repair of any building 
or buildings. An annual report by the president of each of said colleges shall be 
made to the Secretary of Agriculture, as well as to the Secretary of the Interior, 
regarding the condition and progress of each college, including statistical informa- 
tion in relation to its receipts and expenditures, its library, the number of its students 
and professors, and also as to any improvements and experiments made under the 
direction of any experiment station attached to said colleges, with their costs and 
results, and such other industrial and economical statistics as may be regarded as 
useful, one copy of which shall be transmitted by mail free to all other colleges 
further endowed under this act. 
Suc. 4. That on or before the first day of July in each year, after the passage of this 
act, the Secretary of the Interior shall ascertain and certify to the Secretary of the 
Treasury as to each State and Territory whether it is entitled to receive its share of 
the annual appropriatian for colleges, or of institutions for colored students, under 
this act, and the amount which thereupon each is entitled, respectively, to receive. 
If the Secretary of the Interior shall withhold a certificate from any State or Terri- 
tory of its appropriation the facts and reasons therefor shall be reported to the 
President, and the amount involved shall be kept separate in the treasury until the 
close of the next Congress, in order that the State or Territory may, if it should so 
desire, appeal to Congress from the determination of the Secretary of the Interior. 
If the next Congress shall not direct such sum to be paid it shall be covered into 
the treasury. And the Secretary of the Interior is hereby ccc with the proper 
administration of this law. ‘ 
Sec. 5. That the Secretary of the Interior shall annually report to Congress the 
disbursements which have been made in all the States and Territories, and also 
 
-P-A-G-E-621
  COLLEGES OF AGRICULTURE AND THE MECHANIC arts. 589 
whether the appropriation of any State or Territory has been withheld, and if so, 
the reasous therefor, 
Src. 6. Congress may at any time amend, suspend, or repeal any or all of the pro- 
visions of this act. : 
The laws of the United States relating to the detail of officers of the 
Army and Navy to educational institutions, and the regulations pre- 
scribed by the President and the Secretary of War in pursuance thereof, 
are given in a subsequent section of this report. : 
Before entering into the consideration of the questions involved in 
the construction and interpretation of these statutes, the purposes 
which.they were respectively designed to accomplish, and the manner 
in which the States, in accepting their provisions, have complied with 
the evident objects of the acts themselves, it will be well to understand 
the method of their administration as adopted by the Executive De- 
partments, under the several sections relating to the general superyi- 
sory powers retained by the Government over the distribution and 
expenditure of the funds thus appropriated. ; 
It will be seen that the first endowment act of 1862 provides for the 
issue of land scrip to those States in which there is not the quantity of 
public lands, subject to sale at private entry at one dollar and twenty- 
five cents per acre, to which said State may be entitled under the pro- 
visions of the act, and that this issue of land scrip is to be made by 
the Seeretary of the Interior, and again that one copy of the annual | 
report of each land-grant college, as provided for in section 5 of the same> 
act, is to be sent to the same official. The Department of the Interior 
was thus from the first intrusted with the carrying out of the provi- 
sions of thelaw. The general supervision over the Agricultural Experi- 
ment Stations, established in compliance with the Hatch act of 1887, is 
expressly made the duty of the then Commissioner—now Secretary— 
of Agriculture, a duty which will be subsequently herein referred to. 
The endowment act of 1890 provides, (section 2), that the funds appro- 
priated therein shall be paid to the State or Territorial treasurer by the 
Secretary of the Treasury upon the warrant of the Secretary of the In- 
terior, and again, (section 3), “an annual report by the president of 
each of said colleges shall be made to the Secretary of Agriculture as 
well as to the Secretary of the Interior, regarding the condition and 
progress of each college, including, etc.” In section 4 of the act itis 
further distinctly set forth that “the Secretary of the Interior is hereby 
charged. with the proper administration of this law,” a duty which in- 
cludes—vide section 5—the making of an annual report to Congress 
concerning the disbursements which may have been made in all the 
States and Territories. 
After the passage of the last named act of Congress, the duty of ad 
ministering the law by obtaining annually the required information 
from the colleges, examining their workings, and reporting upon the 
same, was delegated by the Secretary of the Interior to the United 
States*Bureau of Education, which since 1870 has been conducted as
-P-A-G-E-622
  590 Bo EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
an office of the Interior Department. The letter of the Secretary of the 
Interior bearing date September 13, 1890, requested the Commissioner 
of Education to prepare a circular letter to be addressed by the Secre- 
tary to the governors of the States and Territories, for the purpose of 
bringing to their attention the new act of Congress and securing from 
them the information required by the terms of the act te enable him to 
put the law in operation. 
The Commissioner, therefore, in compliance with the Secretary’s 
instructions, furnished him in wrifing a careful discussion and expla- 
nation of the act of August 30, 1890, and submitted a draft of a letter 
to the governors. 
The plan adopted by the Commissioner of Education in dealing with 
the institutions receiving aid through the Federal endowment acts has 
had a twofold purpose in view: First, examination into the aflairs of 
these colleges, their organization, objects, courses of instruction, and 
the manner in which they have severally made use of the funds received 
‘by them. from the General Government, to an extent that will enable 
him to judge intelligently of the manner in which they respectively meet 
the requirements of the acts of Congress in their arrangement of work 
and their disbursement of the Federal funds; secondly, to secure such 
data relating to the agricultural and mechanical colleges as is necessary 
for the preparation of a report upon their condition to the Secretary of 
‘the Interior. 
As the act was approved August 30, 1890, it was apparent that not 
only were the States entitled to the first, but also to the second install- 
ment, of the fund for use during the fiscal year of 1890-91 In his 
explanation to the Secretary of the Interior, above mentioned, the Com- 
missioner made the following statements, as the result of bis considera- 
tion of the terms of the act, and made suggestions as to the amount, 
then due, to be paid to the States for such institutions as should be 
designated as beneficiaries thereunder: 
Upon a careful examination of the act referred to, I find that, though passed and 
approved subsequent to the close of the fiscal year 1890, it appropriates to each 
State and Territory complying with certain conditions, the sum of $15,000 for that 
year (ending June 30, 1890). The money appropriated is to be applied to the sup- 
port in each State and Territory of one college of agriculture and mechanic arts, 
provided no distinction of race or color is made in the admission of students thereto; 
or to two of such colleges, one of which, either already existing or to be hereafter 
established, shall be for the education of colored students. Where separate col- 
leges are maintained for the different races, the legislature may propose and report 
to the Secretary of the Interior a just and equitable division of the fund received 
between the two. 
This grant is made subject to the legislative assent of the several States and Terri- 
tories, but payment of such installments ‘as shall become due to any State before 
the adjournment of the regular session of the legislature mecting next after the pas- 
sage of this act, shall be made upon the assent of the governor thereof duly certified 
to the Secretary of the Treasury. 
The First Comptroller of the Treasury has decided that the installment for the 
fiscal year 1890, and also that for 1891, is now due and payable to each State that is 
entitled to receive the same. Hv has furnished me a copy of his opinion contained in
-P-A-G-E-623
COLLEGES OF AGRICULTURE AND THE MECHANIC ARTS. 591 
letters dated September 2, 1890, to Hon. J. & Cannon, Chairman of the Committee 
on Appropriations, U. S. House of Representatives, and to President H. E. Alvord, 
of the Agricultural College of Maryland, in the following language: 
«*  * Under this act for the fiscal year 1890, these several institutions will be 
entitled to $15,000 for that year, and $16,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1891. 
The aggregate sum of $31,000 I assume can now be paid on the proper requisition of 
the Secretary of the Interior under the act. As stated, I think it creates a perma- 
nent annual specific appropriation for the purpose pointed out in the act without 
further legislation on the part of Congress. * * = 
“The fact that the act of Congress was not passed in time to make the payments 
provided for in the fiscal year 1890, and that an appropriation for 1891 could not be 
paid in the July following, does not in any manner interfere with the rights estab- 
lished by Congress under the appropriation. Time, in such cases, is not at all 
material, Congress intended to make these appropriations for the benefit of these 
colleges and they are entitled to have them paid now, although the time in which 
they might have been paid has elapsed. (To Mr. Cannon.) 
«*-* You will see by reference to section 4 of this act that the Secretary of the 
Interior is “charged with the proper administration of this law” and he will 
doubtless furnish you with information as to what he will deem prerequisite to his 
making his warrant (requisition) on the Secretary of the Treasury as provided in 
section 2. 
“Tn answer to your fourth question, I would say that the amount for the fiscal 
year 1890 is available now, and will be paid as soon as the Secretary shall ask for it. 
(To President Alvord.)” 
This letter, sent by the Secretary of the Interior to the governors of 
the States and Territories, bore date of September 22, 1890, and, after 
calling attention to the act of Congress, requested the following informa- 
tion: 
1, Is there in your State a college of agriculture and the mechanic arts, estab- 
lished under or receiving the benefit of the act of Congress of July 2, 1862? 
2. Ifso, is any distinction of race or color in the admission of studeuts thereto 
recognized or made in the State law, or in the regulations and:practice of the insti- 
tution? 
3. Or (a) is there such a college for the education of white students, and also (b) 
a similar college for colored students, or an institution of like character aided by 
the State from its own revenue for the education of colored students in agriculture 
and the mechanic arts? Please give name, location, and president or administrative 
officer of each of such institutions. 
4, Has your legislature met in regular session since August 30, 1890, or when will 
it so meet? 
5. If it has not so met do you as authorized by the act referred to assent in behalf 
of your State to “‘the purpose of said grants,” as provided in section second of the 
act? 
6. Please give the name, title, and address of the State treasurer or other officer to 
whom payments should be made under this law. 
You will please transmit with your reply a copy of the charter of such college, 
with the rules and regulations, duly certified by the secretary of state. 
Upon the receipt of satisfactory replies to these inquiries, and the 
official assent to the terms of the act, given by the State legislature or 
the governor, certification was at once made to the Secretary of the 
Treasury for the payment of the amount of the first installment of the 
fund ($15,000) to the State treasurers, to be made over, in the manner 
   
-P-A-G-E-624
  592 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
prescribed i in the act of Congress, tb such institutions as were respect-_ 
ively designated to receive it. 
January 19, 1891, a circular letter was sent by the Counitencner ot 
Education to ‘the presidents of the colleges which had received the first 
installment, in which attention was especially called to the limitations 
placed by the act upon the use of the money received, and accompanied 
by a blank form for making a provisional report of the receipt and ex- 
penditure of the first installment. This report called for a statement 
of the date of receipt of the first installment and the amount thereof 
received by the college, the amount expended up to date and for what 
purposes, and the specific purposes to which the balance was to be 
applied. 
On September 20, 1891, a circular letter was sent to the college pres- 
idents, accompanied by a form for the statistics to be forwarded with 
the president’s report, which form had been recommended by the Asso- 
ciation of American Agricultural Colleges and Experiment Stations, in 
session in Washington during the summer of 1891. This statistical re- 
port shows the receipts and expenditures of the college for and during 
the year; for the college and the experiment station; the condition of 
the college library; and the classified record of students and instructors 
and of officers of the station. At the same time blank forms were fur- 
nished for the financial statement of the college treasurer, showing re- 
ceipt and detailed expenditure of the fund received under the act of 
1890, 
On June 30, 1892, still another circular letter from the Commissioner 
of Education called attention to several important clauses of the act of 
1890 and laid especial stress upon that section which relates to the uses 
to which the fund could be applied. The statistical, reports for this 
year include, besides the matter of information furnished in 1891, sta- 
_ tistics of farm lands, buildings, and general equipment of the college. 
The following is an extract from the Commissioner’s letter of June 30, 
1892: 
The fact that it has already been necessary to require sev institutions to re- 
place sums of money erroneously expended from this fund, makes it advisable to call 
attention again to the limitations placed by the act of Congress of August 30, 1890, 
upon the use of the money appropriated by it, which is “to be applied only to instruc- 
tion in agriculture, the mechanic arts, the English language, and the various branches of 
mathematical, physical, natural, and economic science, with special reference to their ap- 
plications in the industries of life, and to the facilities for such instruction.” It is held 
that this language authorizes the purchase from this money of apparatus, machinery, 
text-books, reference books, stock, and matcrial used in instruction or for purposes 
of illustration in connection with any of the branches enumerated, and the payment of 
salaries of instructors in said branches only. ‘The erection of buildings is specifically 
prohibited by the act, and the Assistant Attorney-General has decided that the pur- 
chase of land isnot allowable. It should not be expended for repairs, furniture, 
cases, shelving, or the like, or (as in one instance) for musical instruments, the salary 
of a music teacher, an outfit of tableware and cooking utensils, etc. In short, the 
plant—the land, buildings, and ordinary appliances of a school—must be provided 
from other sources, and this particular fund must be applied exclusively to the sub- 
 
-P-A-G-E-625
COLLEGES OF AGRICULTURE AND THE MECHANIC ARTS. 593 
* 
jects named in the act and the facilities especially required for those subjects. In 
closing his report the treasurer should certify that his statement is correct and true 
and that no part of said fund has been applied to any subject not contemplated in 
the act of Congress. 
The reports of the presidents and treasurers, prepared in the manner 
suggested by the Commissioner, are subjected to careful scrutiny at the 
Bureau. Three copies of each report are required, one being retained 
by the Bureau for its own use, the others being sent to the Secretaries 
of the Interior and of Agriculture. Certification to the Secretary of 
the Treasury for payment is made when all reports are found to be 
correctly stated and show no illegal or improper use of the funds. 
This detailed account of the manner in which the law is administered 
will show that no effort is neglected on the part of the Executive De- 
partment to fully and equitably carry out the provisions of the act.

596 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
  As has already been stated, the receipt of the aid provided for by the 
Congressional acts above cited is made dependent upon the partial 
maintenance of agricultural and mechanical colleges by the States 
themselves. It would be extremely difficult, if not really impossible, to 
estimate the total amount of the State aid given to all of these colleges. 
The following table will, however, show the amount appropriated in 
-each case for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1892, including the income 
from State endowments, the annual appropriation, and the special State 
appropriations for buildings and all other purposes: 
State aid to colleges of agriculture and the mechanic arts for the year ended June 30, 1892.

  COLLEGES OF AGRICULTURE AND THE MECHANIC ARTS. 597 
In the act of 1862 entitled “An act donating public lands to the 
several States and Territories which may provide a college for the 
benefit of agriculture and the mechanic arts,” it will be noticed that the 
terms are express and clear in setting forth the duties of the States 
in accepting its provision. The fund to be acquired was to be applied 
“to the endowment, support and maintenance” of colleges of the char- 
acter therein specified, but ‘no portion of said fund, nor the interest 
thereon, shall be applied directly or indirectly, under any pretense 
whatever, to the purchase, erection, preservation, or repair of any build- 
ing or buildings” (sec. 5, second clause). Again, all the expenses con- 
nected with the management of such land and of the moneys received 
therefrom were to be paid by the several States, in order that the en- 
tire proceeds of the sale of the land or scrip might be applied to the 
purposes set forth in the act, and any loss of capital or interest which 
might be sustained was to be refunded out of the State treasury. 
The only exception allowed to these stipulations was that provided for 
in section 5, where it is declared that a sum not to exceed one-tenth of 
the amount received might be expended in the purchase of lands for 
sites or experimental farms upon the authority of the State legislature. 
By thus limiting the manner of expenditure of the fund to the pur- 
poses designed by the spirit of the act, two very important and highly 
desirable objects were attained. First, the colleges thus endowed were 
made distinctively State institutions. The funds were to be applied to 
colleges already established, or to such as should subsequently be es- 
tablished by the States themselves. Thus local public interest was at 
once enlisted in behalf of these institutions, and State pride aroused in 
their successful workings. It is a fact which may properly be empha- 
sized that both the act of 1862 and the act of 1890 are distinctly acts 
in aid of colleges of agriculture and the mechanic arts. Secondly, the 
benefits of an undiminished endowment fund were thus forever secured. 
to these colleges, and their financial independence made almost certain. 
The provisions of the third clause of section 5, limiting the time 
within which any State might claim the benefit of the act, and the 
seventh clause of the same section, requiring legislative assent within 
two years from the date of its approval, were amended in 1866. The 
sixth clause of section 5 is now no longer operative. 
From 1863, in which year the grants of land could first be located, to 
1880, a total of 9,600,000 acres were taken up, 11 States receiving land, and. 
27 land scrip. A’s specially provided, no State was allowed, as a State, 
to locate land within the borders of another State, although such loca- 
tion might be made by its assignees, not, however, to exceed the amount 
of one million acres. 
In the years immediately following the passage of the act, owing to 
the disturbed condition of the country, consequent upon the outbreak 
of the civil war, the business and financial panic, and in the Western 
States the continual Indian troubles, those States which at once dis-

posed of their lands often did so at a most ridiculously low figure, with 
a few notable exceptions. Land was a drug upon the market, and in 
some instances was sold at but a few cents per acre—a serious blow to 
the benefits of the grant.

The payments or yearly installments of the fund provided by the 
act of Congress of 1890 have already been received; although owing 
to irregularity of legislative acceptance in the States, and in some 
instances to the very recent establishment of the institutions desig- 
nated as beneficiaries, all the States have not enjoyed the benefits of 
the appropriations for the same length of time. The first and second 
installments—$15,000 and $16,000—were available for the year ended 
June 30, 1891; the third installment—$17,000—for the year ended June 
30, 1892. 
Unlike the annual appropriation of $15,000 for the use of the experi- 
ment stations, the amount of the ‘fund remaining in the hands of the 
treasurer at the close of the fiscal year does not lapse into the U. 8. 
Treasury. In June of 1891, and again in June of 1892, in many of the 
States a very considerable unexpended balance remained of the amount 
received during the fiscal year. The explanation of this fact is to be 
found in the absence of provision for certain of the departments pro- 
vided' for in the acts of Congress by the colleges themselves, most 
frequently for the mechanical department. When sufficient time has 
been given for the establishment of the necessary plants, the purchase 
of equipment will be generally completed.

In order to comprehend the essential points of difference in the 
provisions of the three several acts of Congress of 1862, 1887, and 1890, 
Jet us compare the clauses defining the purposes of each. : 
Tn the original land-grant act of 1862 the proceeds of the sales of 
land or scrip are to be invested and the interest thereon “appropri- 
ated, by each State which may take and claim the benefit of this act, 
for the endowment, support, and maintenance of at least one college, 
where the leading object shall be, without excluding other. scientific of 
classical studies, and including military tactics, to teach such branches 
of learning as are related to agriculture and the mechanic arts, in such 
manner as the legislatures of the States may respectively prescribe, , 
in order to promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial 
classes in the several pursuits and professions of life.” 
The experiment-station act of 1887, in its first section, provides: 
“That in order to aid in acquiring and diffusing among the people of the United 
States useful and practical information on subjects connected with agriculture, and 
to promote scientific investigation and experiment respecting the principles and 
applications of agricultural science, there shall be established, under direction of 
the college or colleges, or agricultural department of colleges, in each State and 
Territory established, or which may hereafter be established, in accordance with 
the provisions of an act approved July second, eighteen hundred and sixty-two, 
entitled, ete., * * * orany of the supplements to said act, a department to be 
known and designated as an “Agricultural Experiment Station,” Provided, etc. 
The purpose of the act of 1890 can be gathered from the following 
extracts from section 1: 
That there shall be, and hereby is, annually appropriated * * * for the more 
complete endowment and maintenance of colleges for the benefit of agriculture and 
the mechanic arts now established, or which may be hereafter established, in ac- 
cordance with an act of Congress, approved July second, eighteen hundred and six- 
ty-two, the sum of fifteen thousand dollars, * * * and the annual amount to be 
paid * .* * to he applied only to instruction in agriculture, the mechanic arts, 
the English language, and the various branches of mathematical, physical, natural, 
and economic sciences, with special reference to their applications in the industries 
of life; and to the facilities for such instruction. ‘ 
It will thus be seen that while the act of 1862 provides for the endow- 
ment of colleges where the “leading object” shall be the advancement 
of agriculture and the mechanic arts, it does not prohibit the use of the 
endowment fund for other departments of instruction, even of those 
least allied to the industrial sciertces; and yet it can not be ques- 
tioned that, however broadly the act may be interpreted, the advance- 
ment of agriculture and the mechanic arts is really the primary pur- 
pose of its provisions. It seeks to promote liberal and practical edu- 
cation, it is to be noted, of the industrial classes. It is a well known 
principle that laws are most properly construed by considering when- 
ever possible the evident intention of their framers along with the ex- 
act meaning conveyed by their words. When this rule is applied to 
the case in point the conclusion is unavoidable that the purpose 
of the Federal endowment is to furnish opportunities for the youth  
-P-A-G-E-632
  600 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
of the land to acquire a thorough scientific knowledge of agriculture 
and a practical working training in the mechanic arts—that these are, 
first and last, the main objects. But since experience and history have 
shown that the highest degree of success and the greatest results of 
labor in any walk of life can only be attained by those possessed of a 
fair and liberal education, Congress has so provided that these schools 
shall not be strictly and solely of a technical nature, but, by not ex- 
cluding the other scientific and classical studies from the course, has 
- secured the advantages of a general education to the industrial classes. 
Power is left to the legislatures of the several States to prescribe the 
manner in which the several branches of learning are to be taught. 
Thus the plan of organization of the colleges established in compliance 
with the provisions of the act of 1862 is clearly a matter resting with 
the States, and for which the States themselves are to be held responsi- 
ble. As a result, the institutions which became the beneficiaries of 
the endowment are found to be of widely different characters, ranging 
all the way from the college or university, offering six or more distinct 
courses of study, to the school of a strictly agricultural and mechani- 
eal trend, where only so much of general literary training is offered as 
appears absolutely necessary for the work of the technical department. 
The act of 1890 admits of no such broad construction; the depart- 
ments therein provided for are suchas specially relate to the particular 
objects of Federal aid. Again, the Experiment Station act, it will be 
noticed, provides for the “acquiring and diffusing” of agricultural knowl- 
edge. But this word “diffusing” is not to be taken to mean the offering 
of regular courses of collegiateinstruction, butrather simply the making 
public, by any and all such means asmay appear expedient, the results 
of the investigations and experiments conducted at the station. 
The question is, of course, pertinent: Why, since the manifest inten- 
tion of Congress in making the original grants of land to the States 
for agricultural and mechanical education was to establish technical 
schools, were not the terms of the act of 1862 more explicit in limit- 
ing the expenditure of the fund to be derived from the sale of the 
Jand to these particular subjects? To this the answer is a two-fold one: 
First, because, as has before been stated, it was really proposed to make 
the education of the industrial classes as liberal and as complete as 
possible; and, secondly, because spch technical instruction was essen- 
tially a new thing, and one upon which the public would naturally be 
inclined to look with some degree of hesitation and doubt, it was deemed 
expedient to first present it in conjunction with the more generally un- 
derstood and approved form of college curriculum. ; 
It is stated that the ‘‘leading object” of these institutions shall be to 
teach such branches of learning as are related to agriculture and the 
mechanic arts; but even the most cursory examination of the colleges 
thus aided will show that in a large majority of cases these branches 
 
-P-A-G-E-633
  COLLEGES OF AGRICULTURE AND THE MECHANIC ARTS. 601. 
have not been made the “leading objects,” although of late years they 
have been more and more demanding greater recognition, as, at least, 
codrdinate departments of the several institutions. 
While thus differing in the ends proposed by their provisions and 
in the manner in which those ends are to be accomplished, it is mani- 
festlyimproper to regard these acts as wholly distinct and disconnected. 
They are severally to be construed as the logical and successive steps 
of a carefully formulated plan of governmental aid to the cause of the 
agricultural and mechanical advancement of the industrial classes. 
Each is but a part of what can be seen to be a complete and fairly com- 
prehensive whole. The acts of 1887 and 1890 were framed with refer- 
ence to the act of 1862, and are supplemental thereto, as, indeed, they * 
are stated tobe. The act of 1862 provides for what was then compara- 
tively an innovation in college work—scientific agricultural education 
and manual training in connection with instruction in the physical sci- 
ences. The Hatch Experiment Station act was designed to further 
such college work by providing means for the increase of agricultural 
knowledge and facilities for rendering the theoretical instruction of the 
lecture-room at once more logical and more efficient, by giving it a prae- 
tical turn. Finally, the colleges being established and their depart- 
ments of agriculture and its allied sciences and of applied mechanics 
being fairly organized and started in their work, the act of 1890 was 
intended to place these departments, at a single stroke, upon a plane 
of complete financial independence, to extend to them the opportunity 
of securing the most efficient instructors and the most modern and ap- 
proved equipment for their work, and to make them preéminently what 
they were from thé first intended to be, the pleads objects” in the 
institutions of which they are a part. 
When sufficient time shall have elapsed to enable all of these schools to 
thoroughly organize and equip the laberatories, farms, and workshops 
with the funds derived from this last magnificent appropriation, we 
may expect to see much greater uniformity in their prescribed courses. 
As yet such uniformity is certainly lacking. Owing to differences in 
local conditions, and to variations in the standard of instruction which 
these institutions are respectively obliged to maintain, exact conformity 
to a single type may perhaps be impossible; but from a careful investi- 
gation of the terms of the acts of Congress it would seem that a general 
outline of the work to be accomplished by each and every one of the 
endowed colleges of agriculture and the mechanic arts may easily be 
drawn, 
In a purely agricultural and mechanical clic then, it would ap- 
pear that two distinct courses should be offered; the one agricultural, 
the other mechanical. The first year’s work could properly be made 
the same for both; preparatory drill in language, mathematics, and the 
elements of science. For the agricultural course enough of Latin  
-P-A-G-E-634
  602 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
should be taught to render the instruction in English of the greatest pos- 
sible educational value, and to facilitate the comprehension of scientific 
terms. French and German will be found all essential for the more 
advaneed study of agricultural science. As to the sciences them- 
selves, those most nearly related to the soil and treating of its chemical 
and physical properties and changes, would seem to claim first atten- 
tion: chemistry, studied principally with reference to its bearings upon 
agriculture, fertilizers and animal foods, geology, and mineralogy. Bio- . 
logical work—an illimitable field, and one in which it is most easy for 
students to be led beyond the borders of the practical—after the neces- 
sary preliminary instruction, should be confined strictly to the appli- 
eation of its many branches to farm life and farm economy; as, for 
example, economic entomology, structural and physiological botany, 
and so much of zoology and ornithology as relates directly to domestic 
animals, farm pests, ete. Comparative anatomy, bacteriology, and 
animal physiology are of value as far as they are related to veterinary 
seience. The extent of the instruction given under the names of agri- 
‘culture, horticulture, and stock raising, of course, must depend upon 
the amount of time allowed by the length of the course and upon 
the local agricultural conditions. In no case does it seem allowable to 
omit instruction in general farm management, business’ customs, and 
farm law, or bookkeeping and farm accounts. No agricultural course 
eould be called complete in which no attention was given to those 
branches of learning which look to the production of a good citizen, as 
- well as a good farmer. As a consequence, at least an outline course in 
general and constitutional history should be offered, together with the 
study of the duties of citizenship and the essentials of political econ- 
omy. The mathematical work of such a course would naturally be of 
the nature expressed by the term “applied,” as would also be the in- 
struction in physies and in mechanics. 
An ideal mechanical course would seem—while including all the 
more liberal branches of the course thus roughly outlined above—to 
substitute for the work in agriculture, horticulture, and, to a great 
extent, in the natural sciences, laboratory practice in the physical de- 
_ partment, higher mathematics, mechanical drawing, and manual labor 
in the mechanical shops. A four years’ course, embracing carpenter 
work, forge and furnace work, machine construction and design, and 
tile principles of mechanical engineering, might clearly be made suffi- 
ciently thorough and complete to enable the graduate to at once take 
his place as a skilled mechanic, draftsman, or engineer. 
Such being the possibilities with which the agricultural and mechan- 
ical colleges have been endowed, it is hoped in the following pages to 
convey an idea of how and to what extent they have performed one 
functions allotted to them.

AGRICULTURAL INSTRUCTION IN COLLEGES RECEIVING FEDERAL™ 
AND STATE AID. 
Properly speaking, agricultural education is comparatively a modern 
idea. The very liberal endowments of the General Government have 
resulted in the establishment of schools offering instruction in scientific 
agriculture in every section of the United States, but it- must be re- 
membered that prior to 1835 they were features of the educational 
- system wholly unknown in this country. In Europe by the close of 
the last century several such institutions had been successfully inau- 
gurated, although their work was still but little understood and their 
possibilities wholly unrealized. While the earliest attempt to found 
an agricultural school may be said to be that of the Abbé Rosier, in 
France, in 1775, it was not until 1799, when Emanuel von Fellenberg 
established the school of Hofwyl upon his estate near Berne, that 
agricultural education may really be considered to have been begun. 
In the same year a similar institution was organized at Korenian, in 
Bohemia, which was followed, in 1803, by the founding of an industrial 
school at Prague, where instruction was not confined to agriculture, 
but embraced chemistry, physies, mathematics and drawing, and me- 
chanics and technology. 
From this time the number of schools where agriculture was made 
the first or at least an important department of instruction increased 
steadily, if not with great rapidity. France, Prussia, Austria, Bava- 
ria, Saxony, and Belgium soon saw the advantage to be gained by 
thus securing the special training of the farming classes, and institu- 
tions differing in grade and in the principles adopted as to methods of 
work were instituted in the most favorable farming regions. In some 
of the European states chairs of agriculture were established in the uni- 
versities, although this was not until after some advancement had been 
made in the study of the natural sciences. 
England responded somewhat slowly to the movement for agricul- 
tural education, and as late as the middle of the present century there 
were but five such schools in the country, while in Ireland over sixty 
had been established, mostly, however, of an inferior grade. Consider- 
able interest was taken i in the subject by Russia, where, by 1850, about 
sixty-five schools offered agricultural instruction. 
In 1851 Prof. Hitcheock estimated that the number of agricultural 
schools, including departments of universities, etc., in Europe, was:

Since 1840 the systems of agricultural education adopted by the Eu- 
ropean nations have been an essential part of their economic organiza- 
tion. Many excellent accounts of their methods and their work have 
been published. 
The. first agricultural school established in the United States was 
probably that begun in Seneca County, N. Y., near the town of Ovid, 
in 1856. This institution was founded in part by the State of New 
York, in part by private subscription, and was modeled upon the plan 
of the European schools then in existence. : 
In 1857 the Michigan State Agricultural College was formally opened. 
This college owes its existence to the State government, which, in 1855, 
made provision for its founding in compliance with the constitution of 
the State, adopted in 1850. In 1857 the proceeds of the sales of cer- 
tain granted salt-lands and an appropriation of $40,000 were given by 
the legislature, a tract of nearly seven hundred acres for a farm pur- 
chased, and a suitable building erected. The Agricultural College of 
Michigan is thus the oldest of the “State agricultural colleges.” 
Following the establishment of the Michigan College, several sim- 
ilar institutions were put in operation in the Eastern States and in 
the more thickly settled farming regions of the Ohio and Mississippi 
valleys. Among those were the Agricultural College of Ohio, at Cleve- 
land, and the Farmers’ College, near Cincinnati. In Pennsylvania in 
1855 the State Agricultural Society organized the Farmers’ High School, 
afterwards the Pennsylvania Agricultural College and now the Penn- 
sylvania State College. The Maryland Agricultural College, organized 
by private subscription, is, next to the Michigan Agricultural College, 
the oldest of the State colleges. 
But while for several years, until the first Federal endowment act 
became a law, the States themselves made little effort to encourage the 
study of scientific agriculture, we find that agricultural instruction was 
made a part of the regular course in not a few of the higher educational 
institutions. Chairs of agriculture were maintained at Yale College 
and in colleges in more than one of the Southern States. So, too, as 
early as 1845 agriculture was taught theoretically in private schools, as, 
for instance, the Cream Hill Agricultural School, at West Cornwall, 
Conn. 
The great impetis given to the movement for the advancement in 
agricultural knowledge by the passage of the first Morrill act of 1862 
was, perhaps, most strongly felt in the Western and Southwestern 
States where the still comparatively new population eagerly grasped at 
the opportunity thus afforded to secure more light upon the questions 
relating to the cultivation of the land and the most economical conduct 
of their agrieultural interests. The manner in which the States and 
Territories accepted the provisions of the grant and the history and 
character of the colleges which were everywhere established in com- 
pliance therewith are given in a subsequent part of this report.

Let us now examine the courses of instruction offered by these col- 
leges, and especially those which are particularly designated by the 
name of agricultural course. : 
The “sciences allied to agriculture” are, of course, both natural and 
physical; in fact, it would be somewhat difficult to exactly define the 
extension of this expression, since few of the departments of modern 
science have not, or may not have, practical application upon the 
farm. A narrower meaning must, however, be given it in speaking of 
the work of institutions of learning which seek to prepare the student 
for the active duties of the agriculturist. Here the “sciences allied 
to agriculture” may properly be understood to be horticulture, botany, 
chemistry, general biology—but more especially zodlogy and entomol- 
ogy, geology, mineralogy, meteorology, veterinary science, physics, and 
applied mechanics. In addition to these purely technical branches, it 
is very generally conceded that each student in the agricultural college 
should receive enough of instruction in the more liberal studies to 
make his education complete and fairly rounded; that the modern 
languages are truly requisite for advanced scientific work and for 
keeping up with agricultural investigations and agricultural literature, 
which each year is increasing in volume and in value; that the study 
of engineering, as far, at least, as it is applicable to farm improvements 
and farm surveying, is an essential feature of a properly balanced 
agricultural course; and, finally, that it is the duty of all such colleges 
to offer to their students instruction in civil government, the duties 
of citizenship, business methods, commercial customs, and political 
economy. > y : 
The department of agriculture, in most colleges kept distinet and 
separate, usually combines practice, to some extent, with theory. For 
this reason it is that some misunderstanding of its purpose exists on 
the part of the public. Itis frequently stated that farmers do not care 
to send their sons to college to learn how to plow and hoe and perform 
the other manual operations of the farm; that such instruction may 
be more satisfactorily obtained at home. On the other hand, it is 
urged that “book farming” is not practicable under conditions con- 
fronting the student immediately upon leaving college, and that it is 
therefore not practical. Between these two extremes of public senti- 
ment it has been the task of the agricultural colleges to steer, and 
upon the whole it would seem that they have done so successfully. 
Manual labor in the field is not generally, although quite frequently, 
required. Where it is made compulsory, it usually consists of the 
regular farm work taken up according to weather and season. But 
the practice of inducing students to take practical outdoor work by 
offering them a reasonable compensation for their services has been 
found to be so successful that few of the colleges now neglect manual 
farm labor. In purely agricultural colleges such field work would cer- 
tainly seem to be a most essential part of the course. As a rule, the
-P-A-G-E-638
  606 . EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
greatest objection to it, after all, comes from those who desire to take 
_ advantage of the scientific or other departments of the agricultural 
college without being obliged to give much attention to the work of 
the agricultural department. But it must be remembered that these 
colleges, properly: speaking, were not designed for the benefit of such 
students. 
The course of study in this department frequently begins with the his- 
tory of agriculture, followed by lectures on the selection and location of 
farm lands, and general farm equipment. The study of soils, their 
chemical and physical properties, their relations to air and water and 
to vegetation, is next taken up, with descriptions and, if possible, illus- 
trations of the various methods of drainage and irrigation. Soil-im- 
provement—covering the whole field of fertilizers, natural and artificial; 
the composition and the use of .commercial fertilizers; the preparation 
and care of barnyard manure, green manuring, fallowing, and the rota- 
tion of crops with reference to the retention and restoration of the 
chemical properties of the soil—are properly introduced at this point. 
Before entering upon the special study of crops, some knowledge of the 
construction and use of the common implements and machines employed 
upon the farm is considered necessary, and here the mechanical feature 
of the college proves especially valuable. 
The line of work undertaken in the study of crop-culture, of course, 
varies in different States, attention being particularly given to the 
staple crops. After discussing the subjects of tillage and soil-dressing, 
some such works as. Johnson’s: How Crops Grow, and How Crops 
Feed are made the basis of instruction. Then, if opportunity be 
given for manual labor, students are taught practically the manage- 
ment of the growing crops, their gathering and preparation for use or 
for the markets. 
Along with this strictly agricultural course, the study of stock- 
raising is pursued. Beginning with the use of a text-book upon the 
different breeds of domestic animals, their characteristics, habits, and 
respective adaptability to climate, etc., stock-breeding and stock-feed- 
ing are successively treated. In this work the investigations of the 
experiment stations, where experiments with the different breeds of 
cattle, horses, sheep, hogs, etc., are continually being conducted, can 
be very advantageously made use of. In colleges maintaining a ehair 
of veterinary science, lectures and recitations are given in this con- 
nection on pathology and therapeutics. 
Frequently the departments of horticulture and of botany are sep- 
arate, but in the majority of cases they are united, the one preparing 
for advanced work in the other. Horticulture, as the term is commonly 
understood when applied to college instruction, embraces market gar- 
dening, landscape gardening, fruit culture, floriculture, and often even 
forestry. Structural botany is made the basis for the study of plant 
diseases, excellent facilities for which are afforded by the well equipped 
 
-P-A-G-E-639
  _ COLLEGES OF AGRICULTURE AND THE MECHANIC arts. 607 
laboratories and the greenhouses now connected with nearly all the 
hortieultural departments. : 
The application of the science of economie entomology to the preyen- 
tion of damage to vegetation and live stock by injurious insects, the 
composition and application of insecticides, etc., is a branch of biological 
science which of late years has taken a deservedly prominent place in — 
the agricultural courses everywhere. 
Of all the branches related to agriculture none is of more real import- 
ance than thatin which all modern agricultural science has its origin, 
namely, chemistry. Agricultural chemistry, for which a preparation in 
general chemistry is necessary, embraces, in the courses of the agricul- 
tural colleges, the origin and formation of soils, their analysis, and their 
adaptation to crop culture; the analysis of manures and fertilizers; the 
composition of foods; the analysis of fodder plants; the chemistry of. 
stock feeding, and the analysis and testing of dairy products. 
Dairying and other special branches of agricultural industry are fre- 
quently taken up in detail in the fourth or senior year of the regular col: 
lege course in agriculture, while the course is generally completed by 
lectures on rural economy and farm law. In States where some one crop 
or line of agricultural work is especially important to the business inter- 
ests of the people, courses, or schools of instruction, for advanced study 
in that subject have been established, as, for instance, the sugar school, 
connected with the University of Nebraska; the dairy school, connected 
with the University of Wisconsin; and the course in grape culture and 
wine-making, offered by the agricultural college of the University of 
California. 
As an illustration of a course of study prescribed in a purely agri- 
cultural college, and one which is framed to comply in every particular 
with the intentions of the Federal endowment acts, the following sched- 
ule of work in the Massachusetts Agricultural College is selected. The 
figures denote the number of hours per week devoted to the different 
branches, : :

No other college may be said to offer a more successfully adjusted 
course than this, although in several instances particular departments 
have been more completely developed. It will be noticed that mathe- 
matics are not carried as far in this course asin perhaps the majority 
of agricultural colleges, and yet for all practical purposes the instruec- 
tion in that department would seem to be sufficient. Again, what 
might be called a weak spot in the course is the entire omission of 
German, a language really almost necessary for original agricultural 
research. 
While. the Massachusetts Agricultural College in many respects 
might serve as a model institution of its kind, itis to be remembered 
that its opportunities have been exceptional. By the division of the 
Federal endowment funds between this college and the Institute of 
Technology at Boston, the whole of the portion received could be used 
for the specific purposes of its organization: No funds are required to 
be expended for, and, what is more important, no time need be given to 
any other line of work than that of agriculture and its kindred sciences. 
The course above given is the only course offered by the college. 
Somewhat in contrast to the last are the following: EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91.

The needs 
of the farmer, from an educational point of view, can best be met by 
offering to him as nearly as possible just such an opportunity as he 
hinself thinks it to his advantage to accept. The long period of four 
years, requiring attendance during many of the-busiest seasons on the 
farm, at the time, too, when.the young man’s value as a farm hand is 
just beginning to be appreciated, deters many from entering the agri-

cultural colleges; just how many it is diffieult to say. As a means to 
secure to such young men the benefits of an institution endowed 
especially for the education of the farming classes, short courses in’ 
agriculture, and in‘some cases in horticulture and in veterinary science, 
have been devised. The manner of conducting these courses is not the 
same everywhere, but it is a mistake to say that the effort is to crowd 
a four years’ course into two years or one year. They are as care- 
fully arranged and as judiciously adjusted as the longer agricultural 
“courses. The two courses above given are fair examples of a two 
years’ and a one year’s course,

College, as the result of a gradual growth since the organization of the

One of the greatest difficulties with which the movement in behalf of 
agricultural education in the United States has had to contend has 
been that of extending the benefits of the schools established and main- 
tained by the Federal grants to the farmers themselves, and to the 
sons of farmers, who are unable from lack of time or any other cause 
to attend the college for the whole period covered by the course or often 
even for the time of a single session. Various plans have been pro- 
posed to meet this difficulty; short courses have been offered, as 
above described, and farmers’ institutes and clubs have been organ- 
ized in pursuance of the university extension plan. But a scheme 
has been adopted within the last two years in several of the Western 
States by which such students may receive much really practical in- 
struction at the university or collegé by means of lecture courses ex- - 
tending over a single month. As an example, the following is the 
“short course for farmers” offered by the University of Nebraska:

INSTRUCTION IN THE MECHANIC ARTS IN AGRICULTURAL AND 
MECHANICAL COLLEGES. 
The history of manual training has been too often written to need 
more than a brief notice here. It may properly be said to have super- 
seded the old system of apprenticeship in the industrial arts. In 
- Burope it is not wholly a modern ‘idea, but in the United States it has 
 
-P-A-G-E-645
COLLEGES OF AGRICULTURE AND THE MECHANIC ARTS. 613 
only reached anything like complete development within the present 
generation. The first regular manual training school established 
in this country was that at St. Louis, connected with the Washington 
University. Its founder was Dr. 0. M. Woodward, under whose direc- 
tion it is still continued, and is generally. recognized as among the fore- 
most schools of its- kind in the United States. Unlike the movement 
for the advancement of agricultural education, the manual training 
idea was at once received into popular favor. Its practical utility was 
so thoroughly apparent, and the results of its work so immediately 
available, that a demand for departments of industrial training or 
mechanic arts arose in all parts of the country, and especially in the 
cities and manufacturing towns. This demand was in many places 
speedily met by the establishment of such departments by private and 
incorporated institutions of learning, by the founding of special manual 
training schools by the States and by individuals, and, in recent years, 
not a few of the States have introduced work of an industrial nature as 
part of the regular course of the public schools. 
Thus in many of the colleges endowed by the act of 1862 the me- 
chanic arts received attention from the first. In 1890, nearly all the 
State beneficiaries were found to have at least rudimentary mechan- 
ical departments. What each college has accomplished in this line 
since that time, with the aid of the last Federal endowment, will appear 
in the following sketches of their work. 
An idea of the proportion observed in the expenditure of the fund for 
mechanical departments and for all other departments allowed by the 
act of Congress may be obtained from the following table, which 
shows the percentage of the total expenditure for the year ended June 
380, 1892, which was applied to the department of mechanic arts:

This table, it will be noticed, gives the expenditure and ratio by 
States, and not by colleges. In one sense such a comparison is some- 
what misleading, as in some instances, where the most complete me- 
chanical departments are maintained, the expenditure for that purpose  
-P-A-G-E-646
  614 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
during the year was small. In general, where the ratio has been high- 
est, it has been due to the purchase of equipment for a department 
that was but poorly supplied before, or where no such department had 
before existed. 
There are now in almost every State manual training schools, other 
than those maintained as departments of the agricultural and mechan- 
ical colleges; but with few exceptions their facilities for instruction can 
hardly be compared with those possessed by the latter institutions. 
Where the shops for the mechanic arts have been for some years in 
operation it has been found necessary to replace a portion of their 
equipment every few years, So constant is the improvement in all kinds 
of mechanical apparatus. As a result the expense of keeping up such 
shops to the highest standard of usefulness is comparatively great. 
The States, by appropriating funds for the erection of mechanical 
buildings, have done much to render the development of the depart-" 
ments of mechanic arts possible. Without such aid the benefits of the 
Federal grant would have been seriously limited in this line of work. 
There are two wholly different plans of instruction to be found in 
different colleges in the United States where shop work is made a part 
of the course. The one known as the Russian system is based upon 
the idea that every piece of work undertaken by the student in the 
shops should have a distinct educational value; no time is expended in 
the production of articles for use or for the market. Every operation 
from the first to the last mechanical exercise is to be considered as a 
link in the chain of the complete mechanical course. The other method 
of instruction is to employ students in the making of articles of value, 
to teach them more by continual practice than by detailed instruction, 
often to employ them out of doors in performing carpenter’s or smith’s 
work, and, in general, to make them learn by doing. It is noticeable 
that the most successful schools are those where neither the one nor the 
other plan is strictly adhered to, but where constant practice in the use of 
tools is required, while at the same time no student is allowed to under- 
take work for which he has not been previously prepared. The great ad- 
vantage which the so-called Russian system has over a course that is 
wholly or mainly utilitarian lies simply in the fact that it is a system, 
and a system which makes possible the development of manual me- 
chanical training as a science. The difference in final results obtained 
is that the one method tends to produce a skilled laborer, the other a 
master mechanic; but it is well known that without a union of practice 
and system little can be done toward producing either. 
A careful study of the organization of the mechanical departments of 
the agricultural and mechanical colleges discloses the fact that the 
more complete the equipment of these departments, the greater the 
facilities for instruction, and the higher the standard of work in the 
mathematical and physical sciences, the stronger is the tendency to 
get away from the purely industrial cast of the shop-work and to make
-P-A-G-E-647
  COLLEGES OF AGRICULTURE AND THE MECHANIC ARTS. 615 
the manual labor required partake more of the nature of laboratory 
practice. One sometimes hears it said that it is only the lower grade 
institutions which attempt to prepare students for the practice of a 
trade; but this is manifestly an unjust stricture upon the work of cer- 
tain colleges whose functions must necessarily be of a somewhat pecu- 
liar nature, as, for instance, the colored schools and the colleges re- 
cently established in the newer States. It must be remembered that, 
like everything else, a perfect mechanical course can only be main- 
tained as the result of a gradual and long-eontinued growth. It would 
be clearly absurd to prescribe a highly technical course of mechanics 
when the previous training of the pupils was wholly inadequate. 
Another rather surprising fact to be noticed in regard to these de- 
partments is the ease and rapidity with which they have generally 
been organized and equipped, and the readiness with which the regu- 
lar college work has adjusted itself to the new conditions introduced. 
thereby. It might reasonably have been expected that some difficulty 
would be experienced in their harmonious assimilation with the rest of 
the course. But such has not been the case. They seem, in fact, to 
meet exactly a long-felt want, to fall naturally, as it were, into symmet- 
rical codperation with all other departments. Instead of being, as was 
anticipated by some, mere abnormal excreseences upon the legitimate 
curricula—uncongenial attachments to be “carried,” because the law 
provided for them—they have become the source of very material ad- 
vantage to the institutions, and where conscientiously and intelligently 
deyeloped, there is almost no department that is not benefited by their 
work. 
In looking at the provisions made by the colleges for the mechanical 
departments, we are at once struck by the very liberal policy on the 
whole adopted, as regards their apparatus and preparation for suc- 
cessful work. While some colleges, whose limited means oblige them 
to make a modest beginning, have been unable to furnish separate 
buildings for this purpose, most of them possess very conveniently ar- 
ranged shops. These are usually three or four in number, a carpenter’s 
shop, a forge room, a furnace room (or one room for both kinds of work), 
and a machine shop. Separate tools are provided for each student in 
all bench work, and often many of the most frequently used power 
machines, such as lathes and saws. In the forge room, or, as it is 
sometimes more properly called, the blacksmith’s shop, eaeh student 
or set of students is given the use of a fire, an anvil, and the necessary 
smith’s tools. In the furnace room or foundry, benches, one or more 
large furnaces, and frequently a large cupola, are provided. The 
most elaborate equipment is that of the machine shop, which includes the 
steam plant and electric plant, milling machines, drills, ete. The yearly 
advancement in physical science makes this department the most diffi- 
cult to maintain properly, as the first cost of the plant is not always~ 
the greatest.
-P-A-G-E-648
  616 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
The best idea of the equipments of such shops can be found by taking 
a single institution as illustrating their general nature. For this pur- 
pose the following statement, taken from the recent announcement of 
the engineering department of the University of Tennessee, is given. 
It must not be imagined, however, that all of the agricultural and me- 
chanical colleges are as well supplied with mechanical apparatus as is 
this university. I select it because of its almost complete equipment. 
The facilities for foun’ry work, alone, are wanting. The shops are in 
a separate three-story building. 
WOOD-WORKING SHOPS (2). 
The first of these is a room about forty by thirty-five feet, furnished with benches 
having drawers and lockers for tools. Each of these has a Yale lock, with its 
special key. The lockers stand on the benches and contain a full set of tools 
for the exercises to be performed, each containing four planes, five chisels, back- 
saw, square, level, gauge, measuring rule, dividers, hammer, mallet, oilstone, oil 
can, and brad awl. A case in this room contains the additional tools for general 
use, such as rip and cross-cut saws, bits and bit stocks. A quick working and 
easily handled vise of iron is attached to the benches, one for each tool case. 
The second room contains twelve speed lathes for wood turning, with a full set 
of tools for each lathe, kept in convenient reach on a tool rack. The tools are those 
required for turning and boring light work. 
All the heavier power machines for wood working are placed in another room on 
the ground floor. They forma complete set for reducing lumber from its rough state 
to finished pieces of any kind, ready to be used for pattern making, cabinetwork or 
carpentry. They include a surface planer, jointer, shaper or friezer, combined rip 
and cross-cut circular saw, boring machine, jig saw, roll turner, and mortising ma- 
chine. All these tools are new and of the best designs. 
Drying kiln. 
Connected with the wood shops is a model drying kiln. A system of steam pipes 
is so arranged as to give any desired temperature, this regulation being necessary 
to prevent chinking and splitting of boards by too rapid drying when green. The 
racks are so arranged as to permit of the removal of any piece of lumber desired 
without unpiling. 
BLACKSMITH SHOP. 
This shop has six power blast forges, of the Buffalo Forge Company’s manufacture. 
A full set of tools for light and medium work is provided for each forge, including 
hammers, sledges, tongs, chisels, bolt-headers, flatters, fullers of several forms and 
sizes, squares, calipers, and all other tools for work which can be handled by two 
men. Thesmoke is drawn away from the forges by a large exhaust fan. Suitable 
benches and’blacksmiths’ vises are also provided. 
MACHINE SILOP. 
* The machine shop is fitted up with twelve benches and vises for use in chipping, 
filing, and the general work of fitting together the various parts of a machine. 
There is also an equipment of aJl the tools needed for the general work of the ma- 
chinist. These tools are also of the best and newest designs of workmanship. 
They were selected with a view to showing all the general and more important 
special methods used in iron working. They include engine and speed lathes, planer, 
shaper, heavy and sensitive drill presses, universal milling machine, universal 
 
-P-A-G-E-649
  
COLLEGES OF AGRICULTURE AND THE MECHANIC ARTS. 617 © 
reamer and milling cutter, grinder and emery tool grinder. They compose the tools 
for working iron, steel, and other metals, whether soft enough to be cut by other 
metals, or so hard as to necessitate being ground into form. 
POWER. 
Power is furnished by a Sweet straight-line engine and a boiler, the latter located 
inanannex. The engine runs all the machines during the day and at night is belted 
to the dynamps in the same room, for lighting the university buildings and grounds. 
The boiler, aside from supplying steam to the engines, heats the building and drying 
kilns by either direct connection to the heating coils, or with exhaust from the engine. 
The room for mechanical drawing is in the third story of this building. 
Since the courses offered in the mechanical departments vary greatly 
in the amount undertaken and the character of the work possible with 
the equipment possessed, no general outline that could be given would 
be applicable to all or to any great number of the colleges. But the 
following list of the more usual operations and principles with which 
students are familiarized will at least convey an idea of the general 
scope of such instructions. 
In the wood-working shop—Bench work, carpentry, pattern making, 
wood turning, cabinet making, joining, box making, frame construction, - 
and, in some cases, the use of wood carvers’ tools. 
In the metal-working shop —Bench work, forge and anvil work, mold- 
ing and casting, brazing, soldering, sheet-metal work, welding, center- 
ing and drilling, the making and tempering of tools, and clipping, fil- 
ing, and general vise work. Instruction is also given in the manage- 
ment of the fire and the ordinary work of the blacksmith shop. 
In the machine-shop.—The study of the principles of mechanism and. 
machine construction, the principles of steam, electric, and hydraulic 
machines, machine work with lathes, the use of drilling, planing, test- 
ing, and milling machines, machine design, and the construction of com- 
plete machines from parts made in the wood and metal working shops. 
In all of these departments mechanical drawing is made a part of the 
entire course, and students are required to work from their own draw- 
ings. 
When a full course in mechanical engineering is offered, the work of 
the shops is frequently of a more technical nature, and is in some de- 
gree supplemental to such acourse. The study of the mechanics of ma- 
chinery, of the strength of materials, of valve gear and link motion, of 
boilers, machinery of transmission, motors, electrical machinery, ther- 
modynamics, building and building materials, bridge and road con- 
struction, sewerage, etc., is aided to no slight degree by a practical 
knowledge of tools and machinery. In many colleges distinct courses 
in mechanical engineering and in the mechanic arts are not offered, 
the two being united. Some local differences in the courses will be 
found, too, resulting from dissimilar industrial conditions and from 
demands for special kinds of skilled labor. : 
Two institutions—the Institute of Technology, at Boston, amd the

  620 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
AGRICULTURAL AND MECHANICAL INSTRUCTION FOR COLORED 
STUDENTS. = 
Tn section 1 of the act of Congress approved August 30, 1890, for the 
more complete endowment of colleges of agriculture and the mechanic 
arts, it is especially provided— 
That no money shall be paid out under this act to any State or Territory for the 
support and maintenance of a college where a distinction of race or color is made in 
the admission of students, but the establishment and maintenance of such colleges 
separately for white and colored students shall be held to be a compliance with the 
provisions of thig act, if the funds received in such State or Territory be equitably 
divided as hereinafter set forth. 
And farther, that the legislature oh any State or Territory establish- 
ing and maintaining such separate institutions for white and colored 
students, respectively— é 
May propose and report to the Secretary of the Interior a just and equitable divi- 
sion of the fund to be received under the act, between one college for white students, 
and one institution for colored students established as aforesaid, which shall be 
divided into two parts and paid accordingly. 
As a matter of fact, in only sixteen of the States has any division of 
the fund received been even considered. In most of the Southern 
States institutions for the education of persons of the colored race had 
already been in operation before the passage of the act; and this was * 
notably the case in Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Vir- 
ginia. In the few instances where no such school was supported or 
subsidized by the State, institutions of the character designated in the 
act of Congress have recently been established or selected as State 
beneficiaries of the Federal endowment. All of these are not, however, 
recognized as separate and distinct institutions, several of them being 
organized as branch colleges or departments of the colleges or univer- 
sities for whites. This is true in Arkansas, in Georgia, in Maryland, in 
North Carolina, in Tennessee, and in Texas. There are thus in the 
South, including these branch colleges, sixteen schools receiving both 
State and Federal aid and offering industrial and agricultural training 
to the colored youth. They are: 
1. State Normal and Industrial School of Alabama, at Normal P. O., Ala. 
2. Branch Normal College of Arkansas, at Pine Bluff. 
. Delaware Agricultural College, for colored students, at Newark, Del. 
. Florida State Normal School, at Tallahassee. 
. Industrial College of University of Georgia, at Savannah. 
. State Normal College of Kentucky, at Frankfort. 
. Southern University of Louisiana, at New Orleans. 
. Eastern Branch of Maryland Agricultural College, at Princess Anne, Md. 
. Alcorn Agricultural and Mechanical College of Mississippi, at West Side. 
10. Lincoln Institute of Missouri, at Jefferson City. 
11. Shaw University of North Carolina, at Raleigh. 
12. 
18, Industrial Department of University of Tennessee, at Knoxville. 
14, Prairie View Normal College of Texas, at Hempstead. 
15. Hampton Normal Institute of Virginia, at Hampton. 
16. West Virginia Institute at Farm, Kanawha County.

COLLEGES OF AGRICULTURE AND THE MECHANIC ARTS. 621 
The manner in which the fund received from the Federal Government 
has been divided between the races has differed somewhat in the sev- 
eral States. The act provides for legislative acceptance of the terms 
thereof before any part of the first installment could be paid to any 
State; but where this was not possible, no legislature being in session, 
the governor of the State was allowed to signify the consent of the 
State. In several instances this gave rise to some difference of opinion 
as to what constituted “a just and equitable division.” 
It thus soon became apparent that for the satisfactory and successful 
working of the law, some definite rule of division should be adopted. 
The Secretary of the Interior, therefore, suggested that the ratio of the © 
school population of the races be fixed upon as a basis of apportion- 
ment, and this has been generally agreed to. In some cases this ratio 
is determined by the States themselves, in others the ratio as fixed by ~ 
the last census has been accepted. Again, in several instances, where 
the colored school receiving Federal aid is established as a department 
of the white institution, no regular division has been made at all, it 
having been decided that the maintenance of such a colored depart- 
ment meets the requirements of the law as making no distinction of 
race or color. 
Much, of course, may be said as to whether, after all, the division 
according to school population is the most just and equitable that could 
be devised, especially in such States as Louisiana and Mississippi, where 
the proportion of colored students in the schools of the State is greater 
than that of white students; for it must be remembered that the aid 
offered by the Government is for colleges, that is, for purposes of higher 
education, andthe number of white students receiving collegiate instruc- 
tion is clearly greater than that of colored students receiving similar 
instruction. In Louisiana, for instance, even in the Southern Uni- 
versity—the colored beneficiary of the act of Congress of 1890—the 
course of study pursued by the greater number of the students is really 
that of the common school. It would thus seem that an apportionment 
upon the basis of the numbers respectively enrolled in the higher insti- 
tutions of learning would more nearly comply with the spirit of the act 
of Congress; certainly, however, it must be conceded that the ratio of 
school population forms the most stable and the simplest basis for the 
division, and since but little objection has been made to it, perhaps no 
more satisfactory division and none more politic is possible. Indeed, 
it seems not unlikely that one of the ultimate effects of the endowment 
of the schools for the education of colored students will be to raise the 
percentage which the number of colored students enrolled in higher 
institutions of learning bears to the total colored school population, 
until it more nearly equals the ratio which exists between the number 
of students enrolled in the white colleges and the total white school 
population. When this shall have been accomplished, then such ap- 
portionment can truly be said to be most equitable.

The following table will show the manner in which the last—the 
third—yearly installment has been divided. It will be understood that 
the act provides for an annual increase of $1,000 in the amount to be 
paid to each State, beginning with 15,000 in 1890, such yearly increase 
to continue until the annual appropriation to each State reaches $25,000.

It is a fact worthy of notice that of these schools no less than seyen 
have the distinctive title of “normal” institutions, and almost all of 
them offer some normal training as part of their course of study. The 
explanation, however, is not far to seek. It is simply the outcome of 
the ‘educational conditions prevalent in the South immediately after 
the civil war. The idea was quite generally accepted that in order 
to secure the success of the attempts to educate the newly freed race 
it was necessary that they showld find leaders and teachers among 
their own number—an idea that was adopted as the policy of many of 
the States, and material assistance was given to the movement by the 
establishment and partial support of schools for the training of colored 
teachers. Each State soon had its colored normal school, although the 
introduction of manual and industrial training has to some extent en- 
eroached upon the normal course and diverted the schools from their 
original singleness of purpose. 
This normal education, indeed, has had a certain salutary effect upon 
the colored public school system of these States, not so much perhaps 
from the real efficiency of the so-called “normal training” as from the 
fact that the general standard of the students sent out to fill the posi- 
tions of teachers in the public schools has constantly tended to become 
higher, and their work as a consequence has been more intelligent. 
One of the greatest dangers of normal education—unless it be based 
upon purely scientific principles—is its tendency to destroy individu- 
ality, to substitute a rigid adherence to methods for the free exercise 
of judgment and natural common sense. It is almost invariably true, 
however, that the colored student, transplanted from the normal insti- 
tute into the schoolroom, soon loses whatever effect of “teaching by
-P-A-G-E-655
  COLLEGES OF AGRICULTURE AND THE MECHANIC ARTS. 623 
rule” he may have acquired, and conducts his school precisely as he 
would have done did no such thing as normal training exist. Not that 
his sojourn at the institute has been of no service to him—quite the 
contrary, but the real benefit he has derived from it is the advantage of 
the thorough course of instruction in the various branches of a liberal 
education there afforded. 
But with the introduction of the agricultural and mechanical features 
and of the provisions for the industrial training of women, these nor- 
mal schools to-day perform a different and: perhaps a more important 
function. Thanks to.the liberal assistance of the States and of the 
General Government, they are at present very fairly equipped with 
facilities for instruction in the useful arts. Especially since they have | 
become the recipients of a portion of the endowment fund of 1890 have 
they made rapid strides toward the thorough fitting out of their farms 
and workshops. Since tuition is generally free, and students are given 
every opportunity te support themselves while attending the schools, 
there is now really very little to stand in the way of any young colored 
man or woman who desires to secure the benefits of an industrial edu- 
eation. 
As arule the claims and avowed purpose of these institutions are © 
very modest. Their aim is in most cases simply to turn out practical 
men and women. Their graduates are able to step from the school 
into the workshop or the field as skilled inechanics or farmers, or, in 
the case of women, are able as teachers, housekeepers, domestics, or 
needlewomen, to earn for themselves a competent and respectable 
livelihood. 
About twenty-five hundred pupils of both sexes are now veing edu- 
cated in these schools at the least possible expense, and it may not be 
too much to predict that their popularity will increase to such an ex- 
tent with the further development of the industrial departments that 
the next five years will see their attendance almost doubled and their 
sphere of usefulness greatly extended. 
The trials through which such institutions have had to strive to reach 
a footing of comparative security have been truly great; there have 
been periods in the history of almost everyone when failure seemed 
inevitable. The acts of Congress have now made their position a very 
safe one. One of their most serious difficulties has heretofore been 
that of securing continuous attendance on the part of students. Only 
during the months when farm hands were not needed—a very brief 
period of the year in the Southern States—would the rolls reach satis- 
factory figures. The same trouble was of course experienced with 
girls. As aremedy for this serious hindrance to the school. work, the | 
establishment of farms and workshops in connection with the institu- 
tions themselves, where labor is offered and reasonably paid for, has 
worked most admirably. Since 1890 the complaint of irregular attend- 
ance is heard much less frequently.
-P-A-G-E-656
  624 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
But the most widely felt check to progress in the schools for colored 
students is the almost total lack of preparation with which the pupils 
enter the course. AS a consequence, a great part of the four or five 
" years of their attendance is occupied in getting them ready for the real 
work of the school. The conditions responsible for this trouble are, it 
is true, to some extent improving, but the question is still a burning 
one. Until more efficient work is secured in the lower grades of the 
colored public schools, the standard of the colleges, at least in those 
branches which go to make up a liberal education, must remain un- 
fortunately low. 
In several institutions three or four distinct courses of study are 
offered, but in most the instruction is nearly uniform, except in the 
industrial training of the sexes. The basis of the course is laid in the 
study of the English language and literature, mathematics, elementary 
natural and physical sciences, and generally the duties of citizenship. 
To this foundation three different kinds of practical instruction are 
added, namely: Agricultural science, with labor in the field; the prin- 
ciples of mechanics, with labor in the shops; and the industrial train- 
ing of girls in the departments of household economy and the domestic 
arts. 
- And here it seems proper to state, that to institute any comparison 
between the work of these schools for the industrial education of the 
colored race and the work of those colleges and universities which, as 
beneficiaries of the Federal endowment acts, are designed for the train- 
ing of the white youth of the land would be manifestly unjust to 
both classes of institutions for two very logical and sufficient reasons: 
First, the students, drawn from widely separated walks of life, reach 
the school with preparation wholly unlike, both in kind and in degree; 
they must therefore receive entirely different treatment. Secondly, 
whatever may be the dreams of those philanthropists interested in the 
elevation of the colored race, the fact remains a stubborn one that the 
positions in the social fabric which they respectively may expect to 
fill can never be the same; hence the instruction offered must be 
designed-for different purposes. In the schools for whites we may al- 
most say that all practical instruction is but to demonstrate the theory; 
in the colored schools, that all theoretical instruction is but to explain 
the practice. 
The facilities for instruction in those branches which form the basis 
of scientific agriculture have, until the last few years, necessarily been 
somewhat meager in the colored schools; nor have the conditions 
under which most of the colored youths find place in these institutions 
admitted of much detailed laboratory work; and yet the, instruction 
given in agriculture has been of no less real value than that of other 
agricultural colleges, for the lack of time for technical work is more 
than counterbalanced by the greater amount of practical information 
acquired by constant farm labor.
-P-A-G-E-657
  
COLLEGES OF AGRICULTURE AND THE MECHANIC ARTS. 625 
All of the colored agricultural schools have some farm land; many 
of them possess really valuable farms, and upon these the students do 
not merely observe the manner in which the farming operations are 
conducted, but they are themselves the actual farmers. In more than 
one such college all the labor expended in the eultivation of the soil is 
performed by students. The same plan is very generally followed in 
the mechanical shops, where, after receiving instruction in the hand- 
ling of tools and the first principles of mechanics, the student is ex- 
pected to labor productively. The furniture and household utensils 
used in the college, the simpler implements of husbandry, and often 
the shoes which they themselves wear are the products of student 
labor. To such an extent is this utilitarian idea sometimes carried 
that they are able to build and furnish any new buildings required for 
the use of the school. Among the trades most commonly taught are 
carpentry, brick making and laying, blacksmithing, shoemaking, mat- 
tress-making, house-painting, turning, and printing. 
Tt of course follows, that while such schools may and do turn out 
many skilled laborers, they produce but few master mechanics. Their 
graduates have no difficulty in securing work, as the demand for in- 
telligent skilled labor is a constant quantity. As long, then, as they 
send forth young men, who, with a sound general education and the 
self-respect which the consciousness of such a possession is sure to en- 
gender, have been thoroughly trained in the management of farms, 
the use of machinery and the handling of tools, there can be no rea- 
sonable objection raised to the manner in which they fulfill the pur- 
poses of their organization, and no legitimate excuse for any change in 
their policy and their methods. 
MILITARY INSTRUCTION IN COLLEGES OF AGRICULTURE AND THE 
MECHANIO ARTS. 
Perhaps no department of instruction maintained by the institutions 
whose work is described in the present report has been the subject 
of more ériticism and adverse comment than that which aims to add to 
the general and technical education offered by them some knowledge 
of military science and some training in the use of arms and the dis- 
cipline of the field and barracks. 
As we have seen from our examination of the several acts of Con- 
gress in aid of colleges of agriculture and the mechanic arts, and from 
the preceding review of the growth and development of these colleges, 
and the already highly satisfactory results achieved by them, the Gen- 
eral Government has maintained towards such institutions a most gen- 
erous policy from the first. Instruction in the liberal arts and practi- 
cal industrial training have been thus placed within the reach of all 
desirous of profiting thereby. A great stride has been made towards 
the goal at which all enlightened modern nations have been aiming— 
ED 91——40 
 
-P-A-G-E-658
  626 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
the higher education of the industrial classes. In this we have an 
exhibition of what the State has done for the individual. 
In speaking of the heretofore somewhat widespread feeling of aver- 
sion to the introduction of military training in colleges of agriculture 
and the mechanic arts—a feeling which, while by no means confined 
to the farming element of their patronage, has certainly received its 
most frequent and open expression from that quarter—it is but just to 
the spirit of fair-minded American patriotism to say that such opposi- 
tion has arisen from ignorance of the ends proposed by such instruc- 
tion and from alack of appreciation of the true value to the body politic 
of the military training of the youth of the land. To convey as clear 
an idea as possible of the purpose ‘and plan of these departments of 
military science and tactics and the beneficial results to be derived 
from them by the State and by the students, it will be well to consider 
the subject under the following distinct heads: 
I. How they have been provided for, and how these provisions have 
been met. 
IL. What is expected of them on the part of the State. 
Ill. The manner in which they are of benefit to the,college of whose 
organization they form a part. 
IV. The manner in which they benefit individual students. 
PROVISIONS FOR DEPARTMENTS OF MILITARY SCIENCE, 
In section 4 of the original land-grant act of Congress of 1862 it 
is provided that the interest of the invested proceeds from the sale 
of granted land or serip shall be appropriated “by each State which 
may take and claim the benefit of this act, to the endowment, support; 
and maintenance of at least one college, where the leading object shall 
be, without excluding other scientific and classical studies, and includ- 
ing military tactics, to teach such branches of learning as are related 
to agriculture and the mechanic arts, etc.” The act of 1890 being for 
the more complete endowment of colleges established in accordance 
with the act of 1862, may fairly be considered as containing the same 
provision. 
In order to render practicable the carrying out of the purpose in 
thus including military tactics in the course of study to be offered by 
the endowed colleges, an act was passed and approved July 2, 1866, 
providing for the detail of army officers to act as instructors in such 
colleges. This act, as amended by the act approved September 26, 
1888, is as follows: 
Suc. 1225. The President may, upon the application of any established military 
institute, seminary or academy, college or university within the United States, hay- 
ing capacity to educate at. the same time not less than one hundred and fifty male 
students; detail an officer of the Army or Navy to act as superintendent or professor 
thereof; but the number of officers so detailed shall not exceed fifty from the Army 
and ten from the Navy, being a maximum of sixty, at any time, and they shall be 
apportioned throughout the United States, first, to those State institutions applying 
 
-P-A-G-E-659
  COLLEGES OF AGRICULTURE AND THE MECHANIC ARTS. 627_ 
for such detail that are required to furnish instruction in military tactics under the 
provisions of the act of Congress of July second, eighteen hundred and sixty-two, 
donating lands for the establishment of colleges where the leading object shall be 
the practical instruction of the industrial classes in agriculture and the mechanic 
arts, including military tactics; and after that said details to be distributed, as 
nearly as may be practicable, according to population. The Secretary of War is 
authorized to issue, at his discretion and under proper regulations to be prescribed 
by him, out of ordnance and ordnance stores belonging to the Government, and 
which can be spared for that purpose, such number of the same as may appear to 
be required for military instruction and practice by the students of any college or 
university under the provisions of this section, and the Secretary shall require a bond 
in each case, in double the value of the property, for the care and safe-keeping there- 
of and for the return of the same when required: Provided, That nothing in this act 
shall be so construed as to prevent the detail of officers of the Engincer Corps of the 
Navy as professors in scientific schools or colleges as now provided by act of Con- 
gress approved February twenty-sixth, eighteen hundred and seyenty-nine, entitled 
“An act to promote a knowledge of steam engineering and iron ship-building 
among the students of scientific schools or colleges in the United States;” and the 
Secretary of War is hereby authorized to issue ordnance and ordnance stores be- 
longing to the Government, on the terms and conditions hereinbefore provided, to 
any college or university at which a retired officer of the Army may be assigned, as 
provided by section twelve hundred and sixty of the Revised Statutes. 
In January, 1891, the following act amendatory of the above act was 
approved. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America 
in Congress assembled, That section twelve hundred and twenty-five of the Revised 
Statutes, concerning details of officers of the Army and Navy to educational institu- 
tions, be, and the same is hereby, amended so as to permit the President to detail, 
under the provisions of said act, not to exceed seventy-five officers of the Army of the 
United States; and the maximum number of officers of the Army and Navy te be de- 
tailed at any one time under the provisions of the act passed September twenty- 
sixth, eighteen hundred and eighty-eight, amending said section twelve hundred 
and twenty-five of the Revised Statutes, is hereby increased to eighty-five: Provided, 
That no officer shall be detailed to or maintained at any of the educational institu- 
tions mentioned in said act where instruction and drill in military tactics is not 
given: Provided further, That nothing in this act shall be so construed as to prevent 
the detail of officers of the Engineer Corps of the Navy as professors in scientific 
schools or colleges as now provided by act of Congress, approved February twenty- 
sixth, eighteen hundred and seventy-nine, entitled ‘An act to promote a knowledge 
of steam engineering and iron shipbuilding among the students of scientific schools 
or colleges in the United States.” 
In the regulations in regard to such details of officers of the Army, 
made by the President, the time of every such detail is fixed not to ex- 
tend over three years. Certain classes of officers are named as not 
eligible for selection, and the forms of applications for details from col- 
leges and of applications from officers desiring to be detailed are pre- 
scribed. It is also declared that— 
Where a State has more than one school endowed by the national land grant, un- 
der the act approved July 2, 1862, the school which is reported by the governor of 
the State as most nearly meeting the requirements of existing law will be held to 
have the first claim to the officer attached to the State for detail at a land-grant 
college.

In compliance with that portion of section 1225 of the Revised Stat- 
utes which provides for the first allotment of officers to land-grant col- 
leges and their secondary distribution among the States according to 
population, the following apportionment has been adopted, based upon 
the census of 1890. - 
It will be seen from this table that of the seventy-five officers to be

Upon requisition, allowances of ammunition for practice firing will be 
made to each institution. 
The following are the regulations prescribed by the President for the 
government of the detailed officers: 
1. DUTIES OF OFFICERS. 
The professor of military science and tactics shall reside at or near the institution 
to which assigned, and when in the performance of his military duties shall appear 
in proper uniform. Officers so detailed shall, in their relations to the institutions, 
“observe the general usages and regulations therein established affecting the duties 
and obligations of other members of the faculty. For the benefit of the officer and 
the military service, he may perform other duties at the college in addition to those 
pertaining to military science and tactics, and may receive such compensation there- 
for as may be agreed upon. 
2. ORGANIZATION AND DISCIPLINE. 
. Allrules and orders relating to the organization and government of the military 
scudents; the appointment, promotion, and change of officers; and all other orders 
affecting the military department, except those relating to routine duty, shall be made 
and promulgated by the professor of military science and tactics, after being ap- 
proved by the president or other administrative officer of the institution. 
2. It is the duty of the professor of military science and tactics to enforce proper 
military discipline at all times when students are under military instruction, and in 
cases of serious breaches of discipline, or misconduct, to report the same to the proper 
authorities of the institution, according to its established methods. Upon occasions 
of military ceremony, in the execution of drills, guard duty, and when students are 
receiving any other practical military instruction, he shall sco that they appear in 
* the uniform prescribed by the institution. 
   
-P-A-G-E-662
  630 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
3. COURSE OF INSTRUCTION. 
1. The course of instruction shall be both practical and theoretical, and shall be 
so arranged as to occupy at least one hour per week for theoretical instruction, and 
at least two hours per week for practical instruction. 
2. The practical course in infantry shall embrace small-arm target practice, and, 
as far as possible, all the movements prescribed by the drill regulations of the U.S. 
Army applicable to a battalion. Instruction in artillery shall embrace, as far as 
practicable, such portions of the United States drill regulations as pertain to the 
formation of detachments, manual of the piece, mechanical maneuvers, aiming drill, 
saber exercise, and target practice. Instruction should also include the duty of senti- 
nels, and, where practical, castrametation. Such instruction shall be given by the 
professor of military science and tactics personally, or under his immediate super- 
vision. 
8. Theoretical instruction shall be by recitations and lectures, personally conducted 
and given by the professor of military science and tactics, and shall include, as far as 
practicable, a systematic and progressive course in the following subjects: The drill 
regulations of the U. 8. Army, the preparation of the usual reports and returns per- 
taining to a company, the organization and administration of the U. 8. Army, and 
the elementary principles governing in the art of war. 
4, REPORTS. 
He shall render a quarterly report to the Adjutant-General of the Army, of the 
whole number of undergraduate students in the institution capable of performing 
military duty, the number required by the institution to be enrolled as military 
students, the average attendance at drills, the number absent, the number and kind 
of drills, recitations and lectures, or other instruction had during the quarter, and 
the number reported for discipline. Copies of all reports and correspondence will 
be fetained by the professor of military science and tactics, and transferred by him 
to the officer who may succeed him, or forwarded to the Adjutant-General’s Office, 
should the detail expire. On the graduation of every class he shall obtain from the _ 
president of the college and report to the Adjutant-General of the Army the names 
of such students as have shown special aptitude for military service, and furnish a 
copy thereof to the adjutant-general of the State for his information. The names 
of the three most distinguished students in military science and tactics at each college 
shall, when graduated, be inserted on the U. 8. Army Register and published in gen- 
eral orders, « ? 
5, INSPECTIONS, 
The military department shall be subject to inspection under the authority of the 
President of the United States; such inspections to be made, when practicable, near 
the close of the college year. The inspecting officer shall, upon his arrival at the 
institution, report to the president or other administrative officer, in order to obtain 
from him the necessary facilities for the performance of his duties. A copy of the 
report of inspection will be furnished the president of the institution by the War 
Department. 
In accepting the aid offered by the Government in the acts of Con- 
gress of-1862 and of 1890, and thereby binding themselves to include 
instruction in military science and tactics in the course of study of the 
agricultural and mechanical colleges, the States have impliedly cov- 
enanted to provide such other facilities for such instruction as are not 
given by the Government under the 1225th section of the Revised 
Statutes and the regulations prescribed in pursuance thereof by the 
- President and the Secretary of War. In general, such provision
-P-A-G-E-663
COLLEGES OF AGRICULTURE AND THE MECHANIC ARTS. 631 
has been fully made. In many colleges a neat and inexpensive uni- 
form has been adopted, and its use required in all military exercises. 
In almost all, too, an armory has been fitted up for the use of the officer 
detailed, and now, in a great many instances, separate buildings for 
the purpose—often serving as drill hall and gymnasium—have been 
erected. Drills are held on the campus of the college, weather per- 
mitting, and at but few institutions are the grounds not large enough 
to afford at least one good targetrange. In some of the States, officers 
upon graduation are given commissions in the State militia. 
The course of instruction in military science and tacties usually 
embraces, besides the regular infantry drill three or more times a week, 
the study of the prescribed manual of infantry tactics, lectures to the 
upper classes on military history, military organization, and sometimes 
the construction of ordnance and military law. 
WHAT IS EXPECTED OF THE DEPARTMENTS OF MILITARY SCIENCE. 
In return for the opportunities afforded to young men to acquire at 
the least possible expense the benefits of a thorough and practical 
industrial education, the Government asks only that these students be 
required to receive such instruction in military science and tactics as 
will render their service useful and efficient in time of invasion or in- 
ternal disturbance; that they may be prepared, should the necessity 
arise, to serve as qualified subordinate officers; may be able to organ- 
ize and drill volunteer companies; and may become so far acquainted 
with the duties and methods of field and camp life, that the many 
drawbacks incident to the equipment and getting into the field of raw 
recruits may be to some extent overcome. 
In a country such as ours, where the evil of a great standing army 
would be both intolerable and unnecessary, it is to the citizen-soldiers 
that the Government must look in time of need. Unquestionably much 
can be expected of the State militia, but in cases where this. resource 
has been exhausted, or where sectional issues divide the allegiance 
of the militiamen and calls for volunteers become necessary, the exist- 
ence of a body of young men ready to undertake the organization and 
preparation of such volunteers for service is an advantage not to be over- 
estimated. The beneficial results of the training given by the many 
military institutes of the South were clearly demonstrated in the late 
civil war. 
Taking the idea for granted that all good and loyal citizens are 
always ready and eager to lend their service and risk their lives in 
behalf of the country when engaged in a just cause, it seems but little 
to ask in return for the fostering care extended to these educational 
institutions that those who profit by the Government endowments 
should prepare themselves to bring to the country’s aid not only will- 
ing but skilled service. The amount of time required from the daily 
routine of college work is so small, and the incidental advantages to
-P-A-G-E-664
  632 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
the colleges and to the individuals so great, that, view it.in whatever 
light we may, the benefit is still clearly on the side of the student. 
HOW THE DEPARTMENTS OF MILITARY SCIENCE AND TACTICS BENEFIT THE COLLEGES 
THEMSELVES. 
While, as has been before stated, no little objection has in the past 
been raised to the maintenance of the military departments of the State 
colleges, the fact nevertheless remains that these very departments 
have been instrumental in materially increasing their patronage. The 
military feature may be said to be a drawing card, attracting many 
young men to the colleges who would not otherwise be induced to enter 
college life. The popularity of the military departments is everywhere 
commented upon, and is conceded to be an increasing rather than a 
diminishing quantity. Proof of this may be had by examining the 
records of those institutions where military instruction is not required 
by law and where it has been made optional. 
Again, the departments of military science and tactics serve to com- 
plete and properly round out what would otherwise often be a some- 
what one-sided organization. They give a distinctive and generally 
healthy tone to the institutions of which they form a part. Where, as 
in many colleges, the discipline is to a greater or less degree of a mili- 
tary character, the order and system thus secured in routine work and 
the habits of neatness and promptness and unhesitating obedience 
ineuleated render the harmonious working of the many separate and 
technical departments possible. The question of college discipline has 
of late years become a very serious one, and educators would be glad 
indeed to welcome any solution of it that would afford a reasonable set- 
tlement of the struggle between the opposing principles of central goy- 
erning power and individual liberty. For the present it would seem 
however, that in institutions below the grade of the university, which 
educate students in purely collegiate courses, the most satisfactory sys- 
tem yet devised is that of a carefully adjusted and wisely administered. 
plan of military discipline. 
Still another benefit arising to the college from the military feature is 
the spirit of emulation and healthy competition excited by the bestowal 
of the honors of the military organization upon the most deserving 
members of the corps. And here it is but proper to say that the success 
or failure of the department, and often indeed of the work of the whole 
institution, depends peculiarly upon the army officer detailed. With 
tact and energy and enthusiasm his work may not only be made self- 
sustaining, but may be highly conducive to the general welfare of the 
school. An indifferent, weak, or indiscreet officer will inevitably do 
much more harm than good. A very decided stimulus to those wha 
become particularly interested in the work of the military department © 
is. the provision that “the names of the three most distinguished stu- 
dents in military science and tactics at each college shall, when grad-
-P-A-G-E-665
  COLLEGES OF AGRICULTURE AND THE MECHANIC ARTS. 633 
uated, be inserted in the U.S. Army Register and published in general 
orders.” The same result is in a measure accomplished by the annual 
inspections. 
HOW THE MILITARY INSTRUCTION IS OF ADVANTAGE TO STUDENTS. 
The beneficial effect of military training upon the students them- 
selves needs hardly be dwelt upon. It affords that most necessary of 
all things to a growing youth—plenty of regular exercise. Its effects 
are both physical and moral. The preliminary calisthenics and the 
daily drill are of such a nature as to develop every muscle of the body. 
The correct carriage and the complete control over the limbs, soon 
acquired, while eminently conducive to grace and ease of motion, at 
the same time strengthen the lungs, broaden the chest, and secure a 
normal position and action of all the organs. If nothing else, the drill 
is clearly healthy. 
More than this, the training in the school of the soldier renders the 
student self-reliant and manly. By teaching him the lesson of absolute 
obedience, it makes him capable of commanding others; and by requir- 
ing strict attention and absolute accuracy in everything undertaken, 
it instills habits of order and promptness, which must ever prove of the 
highest advantage to him in every walk of life. Finally, it furnishes a 
relief from the daily routine of study and recitation and lectures that 
no other form of labor or amusement can exactly supply, combining 
enough of physical exertion and mental excitement to constitute a per- 
fect exercise. 
The report of the Adjutant-General of the United States for 1891 
places the number of students receiving military instruction in fifty- 
seven colleges at about seventy-four hundred. 
AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATIONS. 
Experimental agriculture is, of course, no new thing, Ever since 
men began to look to the cultivation of the soil for the gratification of 
their wants, much of the labor expended in this direction has been of 
an experimental nature. Indeed, one may say that until the pres- 
ent century the practice of experimental agriculture was even more 
widespread than it is to-day, since every agriculturist engaged in ~ 
it to a certain extent upon his own land and for his own benefit. 
Such agricultural knowledge as was matter of common property 
consisted in a number of crude rules and superstitions handed down 
by word of mouth through successive generations until they passed 
into the realm of the proverbial; and where, as was frequently the 
ease, they were based upon a lack of understanding or a misunder- 
standing of the laws of nature, they have been the hardest of all 
popular errors to eradicate, since they are the deepest rooted. While 
the changes and discoveries and general improvements in almost every 
other department of human industry have been constant and rapid,
-P-A-G-E-666
  634 EDUCATION. REPORT, 1890-91. 
the increase and the spread of agricultural knowledge have been slow 
indeed, resulting partly from the social condition of those engaged in 
tilling the soil, partly from the fact that men’s minds have been more 
engaged with commerce, with philosophical and religious controversies, 
and with the struggle for forms of government and political supremacy, 
than with the peaceful arts of husbandry; but improvements in agricul- 
tural methods have been especially retarded, because the true key that 
was to unlock the secrets of nature has so long been lacking. Science 
was not, and without it advancement was impossible. Modern science 
is to agriculture what steam and electricity have become to the com- 
mercial and social intercourse of nations. It has simply made great 
results practicable. The first applications of agricultural chemistry by 
Liebig in 1840 opened the way. Then, for the first time, agricultur- 
ists began to hope for a little more light upon questions which their 
forefathers were wont to regard.as beyond the range of human thought 
to solve or human ingenuity to influence; and agriculture was reduced 
toasystem. But even before this time causes had begun to operate 
which served to turn the attention of European nations towards the 
cultivation of the soil. By the close of the eighteenth century, the 
true value of the science of political economy had begun to be real- 
ized. The physiocratic idea of agriculture as the one source of wealth 
had taken considerable root in France, and Adam Smith’s “Wealth of 
Nations” had been publishedin England. The new science pointed out 
the relations of the manual industries to each other, and to the State, 
and demonstrated the dependence of the nation upon the farm and the 
farmer. As a result, the first agricultural experiment station had been 
projected in England by Sir John Bennet Laws, and while no start- 
ling improvements in agriculture immediately followed this effort, the 
wisdom of the plan was seen by continental landowners, and within 
ten years several more successful attempts were made, stations be- 
ing established at Moeckern, Saxony, and at several other places in Ger- 
many, in France, and in England. The work of these stations was 
necessarily of a crude and often of an absurd character; there were, of 
course, but few facilities for anything like accurate, scientific investi- 
gations; and the newness of the field, the many difficulties of igno- 
rance and prejudice to be overcome, and the almost absolute dearth of 
literature upon the whole subject made the task of organization and 
of formulating schemes of work a truly formidable one. 
Until the several governments, acting upon the advice of far-seeing 
economists, and recognizing the possibilities in such systematic re- 
search, lent their support and codperation to these pioneers of agri- 
cultural science, the fate of the experiment stations hung trembling 
in the balance. But the introduction of truly scientific methods, and 
a few years of actual demonstration of the great results possible to be 
obtained by them, ultimately overcame the incredulity and suspicion 
with which they were at first regarded, and soon stations for agricul-

  COLLEGES OF AGRICULTURE AND THE MECHANIC ARTS. 635 
tural investigation and experimentation were generally established 
throughout northwestern Europe. In 1885 about one hundred and 
fifty such stations were in operation, and since that time their work 
has been so systematized and arranged that in France and Germany 
at least the departments of agriculture rank among the most efficiently 
administered of all the government institutions. 
One feature of the system in vogue upon the continent, consequent 
upon the centralization of the direction of experimental work, is the 
assignment to many of the stations of particular lines of investigation, 
thus securing a maximum of definite results at a minimum of expense; 
but it may be said in favor of the American system—if system it may 
be called—that the actual value of the experiments performed, where 
the work of no station is restricted in its scope, is often greater by rea- 
son of repeated verifications at other stations. It is not the purpose of 
this article, however, to enter into a detailed account of the organiza- 
tion and workings of European stations. Let us briefly review the 
history of experimental agriculture in the United States. » 
If we examine the charters and the curricula of the institutions of 
learning established in this country prior to 1860, we shall find in sev- 
eral instances chairs of agriculture provided for. The work of these 
chairs was generally somewhat more than mere instruction in the prin- 
ciples of the science—then but little understood by the pubiic—and 
it often extended to the conduct of experiments in the lines of ordinary 
farm management. With the passage of the act of Congress of 1862, 
for the endowment of colleges of agriculture and the mechanic arts, a 
new impetus was given to these investigations. While still not known 
by the specific name of “Experiment Stations,” the chairs of agri- 
culture were in reality performing the functions of such institutions— 
carrying on regular lines of experimentation and publishing the re- 
sults for the benefit of the farming communities. The first experiment 
station calling itself by that name was established in 1875 by Mr. 
Orange Judd, at Middletown, Conn., coéperating with the university 
at that place. Other States soon followed the example set by Connecti- 
eut. In some cases the station was conducted as a department of the 
agricultural college; in others it was an entirely separate institution. 
Several of the colleges, established in compliance with the land-grant 
act ot 1862, adopted this method of bringing their work in scientific 
agriculture to the notice of the public. In 1886, about twelve such 
stations were in operation. In that year, Mr. Hatch, in submitting the 
report from the Committee on Agriculture (to accompany H. R. 2933), 
offered the following statement as a summary of the beneficial results 
already obtained by the stations then in operation: 
“Combining as they do the precision of scientific methods with an intelligent ro- 
gard for the requirements of practical operations, it is not surprising that they have 
come to be looked upon wherever established as the most important aid to success- 
ful farming as well as the foremost agency for the advancement of agritultural

science. They have taught the most profitable methods of cultivation and fertiliza- 
tion with different soils and crops and the best ways of doing the thousand opera- 
tions of daily work; have driven out of the markets inferior fertilizers, food stuffs, 
and seeds, thereby saving millions of dollars to the farming community; and by 
raising the productiveness of agricultural industry have to that extent helped to 
solve one of the hardest standing problems of society—how to relieve the pressure of 
population upon subsistence.” 
In 1887 the bill, known as the “ Hatch Experiment Station Act,” to 
establish agricultural experiment stations in connection with the col- 
leges established in the States under the provisions of the endowment 
act of 1862, was passed by the Forty-ninth Congress and became a law. 
It provides for the establishment of experiment stations or for the main- 
tenance of stations already established in each State and Territory, and 
appropriates the sum of $15,000 annually for their support out of any 
money in the Treasury proceeding from the sale of public lands. It re- 
quires the sending of a full and detailed annual report of the operations 
of each station, with a statement of its receipts and expenditures, to the 
governor of the State or Territory in which such station is located, to 
the Departments of Agriculture and of the Treasury, and to every other 
such station, The bill also provides for the publication by said stations 
of at least quarterly bulletins, and for their distribution, all such 
reports and bulletins to be transmitted through the mails of the United 
States free of charge. In order to secure some uniformity in the work, 
certain supervisory powers are vested in the United States Department 
of Agriculture, where a division of experiment stations has been organ- 
ized which issues periodically a record of the work of the stations. The 
several State and Territorial legislatures are allowed in their discretion 
to apply such funds as are thus appropriated, in whole or in part, to 
stations not connected with any college of agriculture, or to stations 
“connected with institutions not wholly agricultural in their character. 
As it is not intended that the amount annually paid to any station shall 
exceed the sum necessary for its maintenance, any unexpended balance 
of a preceding annual appropriation is to be deducted from the next 
succeeding appropriation to that station. The assent of each State to 
the grants of money authorized by the act is to be made by the legisla- 
ture thereof, or where the payment of the appropriation became due 
before the adjournment of the regular session of the legislature meeting 
next after the passage of the act, such assent might be made by the 
governor of the State. It will be seen that the act contains the follow- 
ing general outline of the work to be undertaken by the stations thus 
established and supported. They are— 
To conduct original researches or verify the experiments on the physiology of plants 
and animals; the diseases to which they are severally subject, with the remedies for 
the same; the chemical composition of useful plants at their different stages of 
growth; the comparative advantages of rotative cropping as pursued under a vary- 
ing series of crops; the capacity of new plants or trees for acclimation; the analysis 
of soils and water; the chemical composition of manures, natural or artificial, with 
experiments designed to test their comparative effects on crops of different kinds;
-P-A-G-E-669
  COLLEGES OF AGRICULTURE AND THE MECHANIC ARTS. 637 
the adaptation and value of grasses and forage plants; the composition and digesti- 
bility of the different kinds of food for domestic animals; the scientific and economic 
questions involved in the production of butter and cheese, and such other researches 
or experiments bearing directly on the agricultural industry of the United States as 
may in each case be deemed advisable, having due regard to the varying conditions 
and needs of the respective States or Territories. 
By the Fiftieth Congress it was provided that as far as practicable 
all such stations should devote a portion of their work to the examina- 
tion and classification of the soils of their respective States and 
Territories. By the Fifty-first Congress it was provided that the 
appropriations to the stations should be paid quarterly in advance. 
Regulations have been prescribed for the free transmission of reports 
and bulletins as provided for under the original act. 
The question of the advisability of connecting the experiment sta- 
tions with institutions of learning has given rise to some difference 
of opinion, although it seems now quite generally conceded that such 
union is on the whole advantageous. The records show that a large 
percentage of those employed upon the staffs of the stations also give in- 
struction in the collegesof agriculture. That the plan works admirably 
in most instances the bulletins of the stations as well as the reports” 
from the chairs of agriculture and horticulture in the colleges abun- 
dantly testify. Itis a mistake to suppose that such codperation is 
merely a measure of economy; in fact, it may be questioned whether it 
is the most economical plan after all, since about as much is lost in 
the greater amount of time required both in experimental work and in 
instruction as is saved in the actual reduction of salary expense. The 
real benefit in the connection clearly lies on the side of the college, con- 
sisting in the very great assistance to the instructors in agriculture 
and horticulture, which may be derived from the use of the experi- 
mental farm land and equipment for purposes of practical illustration, 
and in the incalculable advantage to the student of the opportunities to 
witness and participate in the actual application of the scientific prin- 
ciples underlying modern agricultural methods and practice. Nor is 
this all. The experiments conducted at the station are, for the most 
part, peculiarly those of State and local interest, the solution of just 
such problems and the testing of just such methods as he as a farmer 
of that particular region will be called upon to employ. And not only 
is the student given theoretical instruction in the approved methods 
of farming operations, but he becomes acquainted with farm manage- 
ment, the use of agricultural machinery, and the care of live stock as 
well. 
The claim has been made, even by some who, with a life-long experi- 
ence in farming themselves, have failed to exactly comprehend the true 
object of experiment station work, that the station should be located 
in the most fertile and highly productive section of the State; and this 
argument has been repeatedly used in opposing the union of the college 
and the station. But, as a matter of fact, the station is primarily
-P-A-G-E-670
638 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
interested in determining the possibilities of the average State land, and 
-even a situation in the poorest section of the State is really preferable 
to one in the most fertile for this purpose. Where can better opportu- 
nities be found for testing the values of fertilizers and manures, the 
hardiness of field and garden crops, and the returns from drainage and 
systematic crop culture than on land even a little below the average 
degree of fertility? It is by the successful management of what are 
known as waste lands that the experiment station is enabled to render 
the greatest benefit to the State at large. Nor is it to be imagined that 
a station thus located is precluded from carrying on such researches 
and experiments as relate to the cultivation of better and perhaps 
wholly different soils. While the experiment station is supposed to be 
a model farm, it does not by any means follow that it must also be a 
show farm; for if a model, then it must be such as is within the power — 
of the average farmer to imitate. 
As a rule the work of the experiment station is divided among sey- 
eral distinet departments, in order to facilitate business and secure uni- 
formity of method. Under the charge of a director, who is frequently 
the agriculturalist or the chemist, the staff usually consists of from 
four to seven men, exclusive of laborers. In most stations the facilities 
‘for experimental work are very complete. Almost all are equipped with 
libraries consisting of technical works, the reports and bulletins of 
~ other stations in the United States and foreign countries, and books of 
general reference. The special departments usually established are 
those of agriculture, horticulture and botany, economic entomology, 
chemistry, and veterinary science. 
As the investigations of the chemical department are such as require 
very delicate and accurate tests and measurements, the apparatus in 
these laboratories is generally of a very high grade and represents a 
large outlay of funds. To such an extent is this the case that asa 
whole the chemical laboratories of the agricultural experiment stations 
are the most completely and often the most expensively equipped in the 
country. This is hardly less true of the other departments of the sta- 
tion; the policy has everywhere been to procure the very best of tools 
and implements for experimental purposes. 
The investigations carried on in the chemical laboratories of all the 
stations are essentially the same; the analysis vf soils, fertilizers and 
manures, fodders and feed, milk, butter, ete. By law in many of the 
older States, where fertilizer manufacture is’ extensively engaged in, 
the State chemist is required to furnish analyses of all brands of fer- 
tilizers manufactured in the State, and of all such samples as may be 
sent in a proper manner to the station for the purpose by farmers and 
others interested. 
’ The relation of the chemical laboratory to the other departments o1 
the station is always an important one, as chemical analyses are neces- 
sary in nearly every stage of almost all experiments. A large propor-
-P-A-G-E-671

tion o: the bulletins issued, too, are the result of chemical investigation. 
In fact it may be said that the chemical laboratory is the central de- 
partment of the station around which nearly all the others are grouped, 
each largely dependent upon it. 
Another important and until recently but little explored field is that 
oceupied by the station entomologist. Each section of the country has 
its insect pests injurious to the growing crops, the garden, the orchard, 
and vineyard, and to live-stock, against which the farmer has been 
obliged to wage continuous and often unsuccessful war. The labors of 
the entomologists have already been productive of surprising results. 
In most instances a beginning is made by collecting and classifying the 
insects of the State; these are then carefully studied with regard to 
their life history, foods, parasites, etc., and experiments undertaken 
looking to their destruction. In this work much is gained by the codp- 
eration of the various stations in comparative entomological research. 
While differing, of course, in detail, the general line of experimenta- 
tion undertaken by the station agriculturalist- and horticulturalists 
have also been practically the same everywhere, embracing variety — 
tests of farm products with regard to their respective adaptability to 
soils and climates; the effect of different fertilizers and manures upon 
the yield; the value of food products for breadstuffs and domestic con- 
sumption, and the methods of preparing them for the market. 
Considerable attention has been paid of late years to drainage and 
farm irrigation. In the older States, where injudicious cropping and 
the allowing of yearly waste have to a certain extent exhausted the 
chemical properties of the soil, the experiment stations have been aim- 
ing, and with a fair measure of success, at the restoration of the land 
to its former vigor by careful systems of rotation and soil dressing. 
The result of the scientific study of horticulture has done much, par- 
ticularly in the Atlantic States, to direct attention to the immense 
profits to be realized from the cultivation of orchard and small fruits 
and from truck gardening. Not only have growers been aided in secur- 
ing better and more certain crops, but though learnimg the secrets of 
packing and storing they have been able to obtain better prices, and, 
within certain limits, to control the markets. 
While thus in its general features the work of the experiment sta- 
tions is the same in all the States, the particular line of investigation 
given prominence in various sections of the country is by no means the 
same. The immediate needs of the many agricultural regions of the 
United States differ widely as the result of natural differences of soils 
and climatic conditions, the varying degrees of cultivation through 
which the lands have passed, their location in respect to foreign and 
domestic markets, and the changes affected by the constant shiftings of 
the great lines of commerce. 
In the Eastern States, where the fields have been cultivated for suc- 
cessive generations, and where now strict economy of the resources of
-P-A-G-E-672
640 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
the soil is being observed, waste and exhaustion carefully avoided, and 
adequate returns in the form of fertilizers—natural and artificial—made 
after every crop, the question must inevitably resolve itself into one of 
substitution merely. The Eastern farmer, alarmed by the active com- 
petition of the West—a competition enhanced by the continually in- 
creasing facilities for transportation—has already begun to look about 
him for new and more remunerative uses for his land. What to grow 
in place of grain, and how to grow it? How can truck gardens, 
orchards, and vineyards be made to pay? What are the best methods 
in stock-farming and dairying? are some of the questions which the ex- 
periment stations of these States are being called upon to solve. 
Again, in the South there is much land to be reclaimed and brought 
back from the state of total or partial desuetude into which it has 
Japsed through neglect or changed social or commercial conditions; and 
here different kinds of questions present themselves—questions upon 
the speedy and satisfactory answers to which the social and business 
future of the South must largely depend. 
On the still scantily settled plains of the great Northwest, where as 
yet no necessity for economizing has arisen, or no law of diminishing re- 
turns begun to operate, the experiments to be tried and the problems 
to be undertaken are on a vaster and a bolder scale. There are arising 
and there are being answered those questions connected with the culti- 
vation and the utilization of the soil which are destined to revolu- 
tionize agriculture and whose successful solution already excites the 
wonder and the admiration of the world. 
Perhaps no better idea of the truly great diversity of the natural re- 
sources of the United States can be gained than from an examination 
of the ranges of topics treated in the bulletins of the experiment sta- 
tions, a list of which is given at the end of this report, representing the 
work undertaken in compliance with that clause of the Hatch act of 
1887 which provides for “‘such other researches or experiments bear- 
ing directly on the agricultural industry of the United States as may 
in each case be deemed advisable, having due regard to the varying 
conditions and needs of the respective States or Territories.” 
Among these many agricultural researches of purely sectional inter- 
est may be mentioned the experiments in forestry and timber culture 
conducted by the stations in the north Atlantic and the lake States; 
the investigations now being extensively carried on in the cultivation 
of the sugar beet and the manufacture of beet sugar in the central and 
western States; the improvements attempted in the cotton, rice, tobacco, 
and sugar-cane fields of the South; the changes produced in recent 
years in the methods of stock-raising and of dairying; the study of 
costs and prices in truck-farming and fruit culture; the irrigation and 
cultivation of the arid regions of New Mexico and Arizona; and the 
successful practice of viticulture and wine-making on the Pacific slope; 
in all of which fields the experiment stations have been the pioneers.

COLLEGES OF AGRICULTURE AND THE MECHANIC ARTS. 641 
The plan of organization adopted by all the stations supported 
by the General Government aims at the performance of three distinct 
functions: first, the investigation of all such important questions rela- 
ting to the agricultural interests of the States as are most pressing and 
vital to the farming communities, including the collection of such data 
of animal and vegetable life, the geological history, the soils and cli- 
mate of the several sections of the States, as may be obtained for pur- 
poses of comparison and further research; second, original experimenta- 
tion upon agricultural, horticultural, or other scientific lines which have 
not already been fully explored; third, the placing themselves in such 
relations to the farmers that they can most readily serve them as cen- 
tral points of information upon all matters connected with farm work 
and management. Thus many of the stations accomplish much of their 
most valuable work through their correspondence with the farmers, 
answering, as far as possible, any and all such questions as come to 
them, and offering such suggestions to individuals in regard to the care 
and direction of their farms as occasion and opportunity afford. 
- In many States, particularly in the West, where the great area in- 
cluded within State lines renders it impossible for a single station to 
perform the work for all sections, branch stations are established, re- 
porting to a central station, generally the one connected with the agri- 
cultural college. From these branch stations abundant material is 
furnished for purposes of comparison between soils, products, and 
climatic conditions. 
How to secure the most satisfactory distribution of the results of the 
station work has from the first been a question of no little difficulty. 
The first method universally adopted is the compliance with the re- 
quirements of the law providing for the issuing of at least one bulletin 
quarterly, and the making of an annual report upon the work to the 
governor and the Departments of Agriculture and of the Treasury. 
These bulletins and reports,and such special bulletins as the station 
staff may from time to time desire to issue, are printed at the expense - 
of the States and sent tree of charge to the farmers of the State, to 
every other experiment station, and, in general, to all who apply for 
them. There is thus constantly circulating through the country an 
ever increasing body of agricultural literature, the beneficial effects of 
which are yearly becoming more apparent. 
Besides this method of dissemination of agricultural literature, there 
are several other ways in which the stations are enabled to keep in 
touch with the farming communities. The practice of holding county 
and State fairs affords an admirable opportunity for this, and one of 
which the stations have not been slow in taking advantage. Their ex- 
hibits at such gatherings usually attract no little atteution. These 
exhibits usually consist of carefully arranged object lessons in analyses 
of farm and dairy products, fertilizers and soils, the results of variety 
tests of cereals and vegetables, comparative illustrations of the effects 
ED 91——41

    642 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
of the different methods of seeding, ete. These occasions, too, afford 
opportunity for the general distribution of agricultural literature. 
Another point of communication with the agricultural communities 
is the farmer’ institutes. In some eases the staff of the experiment 
station is only able to be present at these meetings, and to engage in 
the discussion of such topics as may happen to arise; in others the 
- meetings are held directly under the auspices of the station, and consist 
of lectures and addresses upon its work and the needs of the farmers 
themselves. Much real good has been accomplished by this means, 
and interest has been aroused upon many important local questions, 
such as county roads, drainage, the care of orchards, crop rotation, 
methods of stock breeding and feeding, dairying, and markets and 
prices. 
In those States where a department of veterinary science forms part 
of the station organization, the plan of holding periodical clinics, at 
which animals are treated free of charge, and practical instruction is 
offered in the remedies for the most common diseases of farm stock and 
the treatment of injuries resulting from the accidents to which stock 
are liable, has been adopted with considerable success. The advan- 
tages of such clinics are mutual, instituting a more enlightened and 
often a more humane policy on the part of the farmers towards their 
stock, and serving as valuable object lessons in veterinary science to 
students of the agricultural colleges. 
Not the least important of the effects of the scientific investigations 
of the experiment stations and the spread of technical agricultural 
knowledge resulting therefrom has been the rapid increase in the 
amount of agricultural literature in the United States. Forty years 
ago there was practically nothing of any great value published in this 
country bearing upon scientific agriculture. The proceedings of the 
European agricultural societies and a few works by European authors 
formed the whole body of literature upon the subject. To-day the 
number of agricultural works yearly published in the United States is 
more than equal to the demand. American authors on crop-raising, 
-on drainage and irrigation, on stock-breeding and dairy farming, on 
horticulture, arboriculture, and viticulture, on botany and entomology, 
are regarded as authorities everywhere. The number of agricultural 
periodicals has become simply enormous, and is yearly increasing; 
- while the general interest taken in all subjects relating to agriculture 
and its kindred sciences is most encouraging. 
Although these conditions have to no small extent been brought 
about directly or indirectly by the experiment-station system as at 
present existing, the first effect of their work was naturally to direct 
attention to the stations themselves. Thanks to the more general en- 
lightenment upon and the wider interest taken in agricultural matters, 
their plans and methods are being subjected to constant and often to 
severe scrutiny and criticism; this is precisely the most desirable state
-P-A-G-E-675

COLLEGES OF AGRICULTURE AND THE MECHANIC ARTS. 643 
of affairs that could exist, not that there is any real reason for complaint 
as to the character and amount of the work accomplished by them, for 
on the contrary, in most instances, they are well able to stand the test, 
but the consciousness that they are regarded as the leaders in the line 
of agricultural advancement has naturally a stimulating effect upon 
their work and workers. : 
It was not to be expected that the experiment stations would at once 
spring iito popular favor. With not a few enemies from the first, 
ready and eager to detect and point out to the public gaze every slip 
and possible error made through inexperience or hasty conclusion, it 
has generally been the casé that all important work undertaken has 
been deliberately conducted and the results cautiously announced. 
Directors have been keenly alive to the fact that a tardy conclusion is 
far better than an erroneous or a doubtful one. Repeated verification 
is absolutely essential to the accuracy of most agricultural experiments. 
So many quantities have to be taken into the account, so much allow- 
ance has to be made for unforeseen extraneous influences and varying 
climatic conditions, that only after again and again testing the fact to 
be demonstrated can any definite assertion be made regarding it. This 
delay, inexplicable to the uninitiated, has always been a point of attack 
from those who, themselves incompetent to judge, are unwilling that 
others should suspend judgment. 
While there is to a certain extent a sort of general supervision ex- 
ercised by the General Government, through the Department of Agri- 
culture, over the work of the experiment stations, and while, too, there 
is some codperation among the stations in the lines of work adopted, 
it is nevertheless a fact that they can not reach their highest point of 
utility until something more of a system has been devised. As we 
have seen, the inmmense area of the country and the great differences 
in soils and climates and social conditions serve to make the work of 
each experiment station’more or less independent, yet this independ- 
ence can be carried too far, especially in the case of stations where the 
conditions are more nearly alike. There seems to be no reason why 
the same experiments should be performed in a dozen different States 
upon points which can not vary, no matter where they arise. This is 
particularly true in the entomological and veterinary departments. 
Apparently much time and expense could be saved if such work were 
definitely divided up among the various stations in such a way that, 
where no local interest is involved, the results of the experiments 
should become general property and available to farmers everywhere. 
In this respect the European system is vastly superior to our own. 
And yet our own stations are still comparatively in their infancy, and 
it woald be clearly unfair to expect perfect organization and codperation 
for years to come. That it will come, however, and that the efficiency 
and usefulness of the agricultural experiment stations will continue to

  increase, is a belief which the record of their first five years of recog-_ 
nized existence would seem to fully warrant. 
For complete lists of the bulletins published by the experiment sta- 
tions, attention is called to the publications of the office of experiment 
stations of the Agricultural Department at Washington. In the 
Official Experiment Station Record (monthly), printed by the authority 
of the Secretary of Agriculture, a full bibliography of the literatare 
emanating from the stations is maintained, with a summary of each 
month’s new bulletins. Copies of this record can be obtained by apply- 
ing to the United States Department of Agriculture.

ANNUAL ADDRESS BEFORE THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN AGRICUL- 
TURAL COLLEGES AND EXPERIMENT STATIONS. 
By Wm. LeRoy Broun, 
President of the association, at the sixth annual convention, held in New Orleans, November 15, 1892. 
Gentlemen of the association: In the annual address to be made on this occasion, 
in accordance with the custom and law of this association of agricultural colleges 
and experiment stations, I propose to occupy a portion of your time in discussing the 
educational features of the institutions here represented, and their adaption to the 
wants of the people. 5 
Education that looks to culture alone, while attractive and elevating in its nature 
and refining in its influence, does uot of itself qualify the recipient for the active 
duties of life. It simply builds the piers of the bridge to be crossed. . There must 
be superadded to this culture, when obtained by the fortunate possessor, that 
technical education which will span the chasm that separates college life from 
actual life. 
Milton’s definition of education as “that which fits a man to perform skilfully, 
magnanimously, and justly all the offices, both public and private, of peace and 
war,” is of too general a character to be of value. For whatever might have been 
thought possible in Milton’s day, it is beyond donbt impossible now for any one 
person to be so equally well educated in all departments as to be able to perform 
skilfully all the offices of peace and war,  
-P-A-G-E-677

In former years the older college systems were especially adapted, with their 
excess of classical culture, to the professions of law, medicine, theology, and peda- 
gogy. But long since thoughtful men recognized the defect of a system of educa- 
tion that prepared the youth of the country only for the so-called learned professions. 
The fact that of the many millions of our people that were engaged in gainful 
eccupations about one-half was employed in agriculture, and less than 3 per cent 
belong to the class of lawyers, physicians, clergymen, and. teachers, showed the 
necessity of . 
BROADENING OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM 
to include this larger class, for which but little special provision had been made. 
And besides this, the changes wrought in the various occupations of life by the ad- 
vances made in science and its many applications to the industrial arts demanded 
that provision should be made for a wide diffusion among the people of a knowledge 
of these sciences and their applications. 
It was in recognition of these facts that the Congress of the United States made 
the liberal donation of public lands to establish the American agricultural colleges. 
It is gratifying to consider that wise provision of national legislation, through 
the instrumentality of which there now exists in every State and Territory a col- 
lege, endowed by the General Government, for the education and elevation of the 
people by instruction in the principles and applications of science. Our admiration 
for the far-seeing wisdom of its authors, who, in that legislation, ‘builded better 
than they knew,” increases the more the subject is considered. 
By the well-known act of Congress of July 2, 1862, by which the land-grant col- 
leges were founded, Senator Morrill, of Vermont, 
BUILT FOR HIMSELF A MONUMENT 
more lasting than brass. For thereby his name will be held throughout our entire 
country in affection and esteem by the youth of the centuries to come, who shall 
fill the halls of these colleges in seeking that education which will fit them to be- 
come citizens worthy of the Republic. 
It would, therefore, I beg just here to say, be eminently proper that there ahonld 
be placed in the library of each of the land-grant colleges a bust of our distinguished 
legislative patron, as an evidence of our high appreciation of the great work he has 
accomplished in the cause of education. 
The historie period in which the act of Congress became a law suggests a some- 
what parallel instance in the establishment of a celebrated European university. 
The historian tells us that hardly had the sound of the Spanish artillery ceased to 
be heard across the plains of Holland, when Leyden decked herself with flowers in 
honor of the founding of the great university which has for centuries cast the light 
of science and learning to the remote parts of the earth. While Leyden was founded 
as a memorial of peace, our colleges were founded in the hope of peace and the pres- 
ervation of the Union. 
Just thirty years ago, when all the energies of our country were being consumed 
in that terrible internecine struggle, when war, with its consuming blight, was 
alone the subject of thought and object of action, then, with 
A WISE FORESIGHT 
rarely equaled, with a sublime faith in the future of our country, did Congress set 
apart and devote a vast portion of the public domain to the several States,in trust, 
for the collegiate education of the generations to come, This act alone will signal- 
ize in history the Congress of 1862, A century must elapse before its beneficial 
effects on the education of the people will be duly appreciated. 
As it was only possible once in the history of the world for America to have been 
discovered, so it was only possible once for the consecration of this large area of  
-P-A-G-E-678
  
  646° EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91, 
public domain to the cause of education. And as the historian of the future traces 
the development in civilization of our Republic, and investigates the causes which 
have contributed thereto, the legislation which established these national colleges 
of science and the arts will be classed as a prominent factor. This affirmation is 
based not so much on what has been done in the field of education by these institu- 
tions, as on the promise of the future, on the broad view and purpose expressed in 
the charter as given in the act of foundation, and on the fitness of the charter of 
education, designated as the leading object of the colleges, to the wants of the people 
and the demands of the age of science in which we live. 
At first many of the States, generally from economic considerations, associated 
these colleges with their State universities; others founded independent institutions. 
But in recent years the tendency has been to dissociate and establish 
SEPARATE COLLEGES, 
from a belief that thereby the object of the educational grant could be beiter ac- 
complished. But whether they existed as co-ordinate parts of State universities or 
as independent institutions, one familiar with their history can not fail to have ob- 
served that in the early days there existed a widespread prejudice against the char- 
acter of education proposed to be given. They were in many places regarded as 
inferior colleges for an inferior class. And possibly, in some instances, the mistake 
made in the organization and schedule of study may have furnished apparent cause 
for the existence of such prejudice. 
The function of the college was, without doubt, often misunderstood, and the 
misapprehension in the popular mind was largely due to the name the colleges 
bear. By many they were thought to be colleges established for the sole purpose of 
making farmers of their graduates; that they were professional schools established 
for the purpose of educating boys to be farmers, similar in that respect to the pro- 
fessional schools for educating young men to be lawyers and doctors; and often the 
colleges experienced severe criticism if their graduates should prefer to adopt some 
other vocation than that of farming. In the opinion of these critics, a land-grant 
college failed of its object just in proportion as its graduates failed to adopt farm- 
ing as a profession, and its success was considered proportionate to the number of 
farmers among the alumni. 
This contracted view of the object of the land-grant colleges has now largely 
yielded to 
A MORE GENEROUS APPRECIATION 
of the object of the grant, to a better understanding of the broad and comprehen- 
sive plan of the charter as contained in the act of Congress, as well as a more 
correct appreciation of the relation of technical to liberal education, and to the ac- 
Inowledgment of the high privileges and rights of an American boy to select his 
own vocation. 
The object of our colleges is, as expressed in the original act, to teach—to teach 
“such branches of learning as are related to agriculture and the mechanic arts; 
and while it also includes military science, it does not exclude classical studies. 
This is broad, comprehensive, wise, not narrow or contracted. The leading object 
is to teach the principles and the applications of science, to teach subjects that re- 
late to the useful arts, and while culture by the study of classics is not excluded, it 
is not the leading object. It were needless before this association to name the dif- 
ferent branches that relate to agriculture, or the many departments of exact science 
that relate to the mechanic arts. All these constitute the direct object of the in- 
struction to be given. : 
IN THE FIRST YEARS 
of the history of these institutions attention was paid generally to agriculture 
and its branches, to the exclusion of the mechanic arts. This resulted not only 
 
-P-A-G-E-679
  COLLEGES OF AGRICULTURE AND THE MECHANIC ARTS. 647 
from economical considerations and from the larger interests involvedin agriculture, 
but also from the inability at. that time to teach the elementary forms of mechanic 
arts as successfully as is now done in the modern method of manual training. 
From an experience of eight years in an institution where a well equipped labora- 
tory of mechanic arts constitutes a part of its educational equipment, I can not ex- 
press with too strong emphasis my appreciation of the beneficial effects of the modern 
method of teaching what is known as manual training. All present are familiar 
with its methods and the educational controversy in regardo its merits as a means 
of education. Some enthusiastic advocates have probably pressed its claims with 
too much ardor, and demanded that it should occupy too exalted a position among 
the methods and subjects that are generally recognized as means of education. Be — 
that as it may, its true value is now recognized by educators. It has come to stay, 
and deserves recognition in the lower classes- of a collegiate course, but only as a 
means of discipline. 
Its object is not to make mechanics, nor the making of things, but the making of 
men. Its methods develop order, accuracy, perseverance, and self-reliance, and while 
imparting manual skill and giving strength to the body, its exercises tend in a very 
marked degree to develop the constructive and executive faculties. 
Drawing, which gives the ability to express the concept graphically, is also an 
essential element of a scientific education, universally recognized of value. Hence, — 
aschool of drawing, as an adjunct of the school of mechanic arts, is a necessary 
department of a land-grant college. And tho 
MANUAL TRAINING 
received from the series of graduated exercises given in this school, when combined 
with the study of science as practically taught in the different laboratories, gives an 
education eminently fitted for the American boy of the nineteenth century. 
And, moreover, the wisdom of the charter of these colleges in requiring that pro- 
vision should be made for education in those branches that relate to mechanic arts 
is made manifest when we consider their relation to the necessities of civilization. 
The studies that relate thereto are the studies that relate to active life. The arts 
by which raw material is eonverted into food, clothing, and shelter for civilized 
man, by which towns and cities are built, by which rivers are spanned and roads 
constructed, and by which manufacturing is rendered possible, these, and all that 
mark the progress of the present century, are directly or remotely dependent on the 
applications of mechanic arts. 
The relation that technical education has to modern civilization and the benefits 
to be derived therefrom are apparent to all observant minds. Daily observations 
show the advantage of skilled and intelligent labor over that which is ignorant and 
unskilled, and make evident the important part that educated industry has in mod- 
ern civilization. These facts clearly demonstrate that for a State to equip her youth 
by proper education for this industrial age, to plan wisely for the future, she must 
encourage and liberally support technical education. 
In view, therefore, of the prominent position mechanic arts now occupy in many 
of the land-grant colleges, and of necessity must occupy, it would seem eminently 
proper that this association should 
PROVIDE A DEPARTMENT’ 
or section devoted to the consideration of subjects related thereto, where our col- 
leagues in these departments may discuss methods and improvements for the benefit 
of all concerned. 
The relation that technical bears to liberal education is more generally appreciated 
now than formerly. In the early history ofsome of the colleges we represent itis prob- 
“ able that too much attention was paid to the mere muscular education, not recogniz- 
ing the fact that if energy is consumed too largely by muscular exertion there will be
-P-A-G-E-680
    648 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
little store for mental effort. There is no true education in drudgery, in mere muscu- 
Jar labor, when the brain is not exercised. Colleges were not founded to teach 
manual skill, but to teach brain skill; to develop mind and character. And merely 
learning how to do without learning the why, is empirical, a rule-of-thumb method, 
which no educator can approve. e 
In education, principle is far beyond practice, and a knowledge of principle is 
essential to good practice. 
Hence, technical education, to be of value, must be founded on a knowledge of 
principles, on a liberal-education. And the broader and more extended the base of 
liberal education which constitutes the foundation, the more symmetrical will be 
the column of technical education which forms the superstructure. 
And by the term liberal education, as here used, we do not necessarily include nor 
exclude the classics. 
A FAIR KNOWLEDGE OF LATIN 
for obvious reasons is of great advantage to a boy, and its prosecution is always 
advised if time and circumstances permit. But a comprehensive knowledg? of the 
principles of science is essential to a liberal education, and especially to that liberal 
education which is to constitute the foundation for a successful technical superstruc- 
ture. 
Education in the principles of science must be insisted on if we hope to attain 
success in instruction in technics. While this is true in every department, it is 
preéminently true if agriculture be the vocation for which the student is to be 
qualified. 
But the test of exact knowledge of the principles of science is the ability to put 
them in practice; hence the necessity of laboratories, of workshops in every depart- 
ment of science in connection with our colleges. We have, and if not we must 
have, in each land-grant college laboratories of chemistry, physics, mechanic arts, 
botany, biology, ete., where students may learn things, not words; where they 
may learn to execute; may educate their brains through their hands; may learn 
science through their finger tips. 
But scientific laboratory work has its most comprehensive field in agriculture and 
horticulture and in the dairy; for here successful experimentation exacts tribute 
from almost every other department of science. 
Successful instruction in agriculture demands both theory and practice, a knowl- 
edge of the principles of sciences with which agriculture is directly concerned, and 
a knowledge of the methods of applying those printiples to successful practice. 
LABORATORY. PRACTICE 
in the field and garden and dairy is essential, but it should always be educative in 
character, should exercise the brain as well as the hand. While why we plow is 
best learned at college, how to plow is best learned on a farm. 
But the function of the land-grant colleges is not solely to make farmers of their 
students, and where such an opinion prevails the public mind can not, for the in- 
terests of education, be too soon disabused of the impression. To attempt such a 
role must of necessity result in failure. Nine-tenths of the boys who attend colleges 
in the South, if not in other sections, find, when they graduate, that their capital 
on which to begin life is their education alone. 
On their brains and hands they must depend for success. They can not engage in 
farming without a farm, and this, as a rule, they do not possess. Hence they must 
begin as wage-earners, as teachers, engineers, chemists, or in whatever capacity 
their education and environment render possible. 
But should favorable circumstances render it possible for the young graduate to 
begin life as a farmer, it does not necessarily follow that he will make a successful
-P-A-G-E-681
  COLLEGES OF AGRICULTURE AND THE MECHANIC ARTS. 649 
farmer. When the conditions of land and market are favorable, success in farming 
comes of practical experience, close observation, executive ability, with untiring 
energy and good common sense; qualities that no college that exists, or may exist, 
can impart. But yet a good science education, such as is given in our land-grant _ 
colleges, is the best possible 
PREPARATORY TRAINING FOR SUCCESS 
in this honorable vocation. 
We maintain, therefore, that the function of the land-grant colleges is not to 
make farmers of its students—and in saying this we are simply repeating the well- 
known opinion of the legislative founder of these institutions—but to make men; 
men with educated brains and skilled hands, ready and willing to work with 
both brains and hands in whatever vocation they are best fitted to perform the 
duties of life. 
There is another view, worthy of consideration, which necessitates a broad and 
liberal curriculum, as required in the act of Congress. 
The freedom and possibilities of American life differ from the fixed relations of an 
older European civilization, where the son is expected to adopt the vocation of the 
father. American freedom protests against a system that would educate a class of 
boys for one vocation only. The right of an American boy to carve out his own for- 
tune, and to-adopt any vocation that his inclination may lead to and his judgment 
approve, should not be abridged by an educational system designed to prejudge his 
future and train him for one vocation only. He does not measure his possibilities 
by his father’s attainments. He may be farmer or physician, teacher or lawyer, 
merchant or mechanic, preacher or President. Hence our agricultural colleges 
should not be modeled after the plan of the European. They of necessity must be 
broader and more liberal in their educational schemes in order to 
‘It is perhaps needless to say that these colleges were not established or endowed 
for the sole purpose of teaching agriculture. Their object was to give an opportu- 
nity for those engaged in industrial pursuits to obtain some knowledge of the practical 
sciences related to agriculture and the mechanic arts; such as they could not then 
obtain at most of our institutions called classical colleges, where the languages, 
Greek and Latin, French and German, absorb perhaps two-thirds of all the time of 
the students while in college. 
But it never was intended to force the boys of farmers going into these institu- 
tions so to study that they should all come out farmers. It was merely intended to 
give them an opportunity to do so, and to do so with advantage if they saw fit. 
Obviously not manual but intellectual instruction was the paramount object. It 
was not provided that agricultural labor in the field should be practically taught, 
any more than that the mechanical trade of a carpenter or blacksmith should be 
taught. Secondly, it was a liberal education that was proposed. Classical studies 
were not to be excluded, and, therefore, must be included. The act of 1862 proposed 
asystem of broad education by colleges, not limited to a superficial and dwarfed 
training such as might be had at an industrial school, nor a mere manual training 
such as might be supplied by a foreman of a workshop or by a foreman of an experi- 
mental farm. If any would have only a school with equal scraps of labor and of in- 
struction, or something other than a college, they would not obey the national law. 
Experience in manual labor, in the handling of tools and implements, is not to be 
disparaged; in the proper time and place it is most essential, and generally some- 
thing of this may be obtained either before or after the college term, but should not 
largely-interfere with the precious time required for a definite amount of scientific 
and literary culture, which all earnest students are apt to find far too limited.—Sena-

ADAPT THEMSELVES TO AMERICAN CIVILIZATION. 
While these views are not new to the members of this association, they still must 
be, in many sections, emphasized with insistence, in order to give a just impression 
of the educational work we are endeayoring to do and are required to do under the 
law establishing these institutions. 
They constitute, on the one hand, the argument for breadth, for liberal education 
against narrowness, which is sometimes charged by adherents of the old classical 
culture, who contend that there is no place for an agricultural college in the Ameri- 
can system of education; and on the other hand they furnish the argument for liberal 
education against the empirical technical instruction that, even yet in many sec- 
tions, agricultural friends contend should be limitations of the educational sphere 
of the land-grant colleges. 
The growth of these institutions, their influence in causing older colleges to mod- 
ify their courses of instruction, the high esteem in which they are held by men of 
learning and light as educational centers of power, the life and energy they manifest 
in every State, furnish the answer to each class of critics, and give assurance of an 
influence for good that will widen with the years. 
Our association represents not agricultural colleges, but 
AMERICAN AGRICULTURAL COLLEGES; 
broad institutions adapted to American civilization, and not imitations of those 
* which exist elsewhere, and are adapted to an older civilization where class educa- 
tion is recognized, They are the product of our civilization and of the century in 
which we live, and represent, not the eld, but the new education. 
And this so-called new education makes no protest against the old classical system 
which has for centuries held the gateways of the temple of learning, and trained 
and disciplined and refined human thought and expression. It is not revolutionary, 
but supplementary, and seeks to build up and develop American civilization by 
making the leading object not linguistic culture, but scientific training. 
Our colleges represent the legitimate outgrowth of the progress of science and 
the demands of the century. They must grow in harmonious development with the 
age in which they exist, and must not cease to grow, for with a college the cessation 
‘of growth is the beginning of decay. Their faces are turned toward the future and 
not toward the past; hence their chief concern must be about the studies of the 
present and future. 
In the former centuries it was not useful knowledge, but polite learning; not the 
laws of nature, but the laws of language, that were deemed worthy of study. 
No one knew a century ago that steam would revolutionize the world and change 
the methods of human industry. No one knew that it would enable England, with 
its limited area and population, to do the work that represents the equivalent of the 
manual labor of all the able-bodied men of the world. But the fact is it has 
CHANGED THE FACE OF THE CIVILIZED WORLD, 
entered every department of human industry, and largely modified our educational 
systems. It is no longer a question whether science shall be taught ornot. The 
spirit of the age demands it, and the question now is, in the limited time that can be 
devoted to education, how much of the old can be retained. 
We have reason to be thankful that the colleges represented by this association 
have their faces turned toward the future, and that there is established in every 
State of the Union a college that exalts useful knowledge and educates its youth for 
the future and not for the past. 
But some contend, though at present the tendency is to a more liberal v. iew, that. 
education in science is inferior in character and in discipline to the old form of edu- 
cation of the classical colleges. Were this the proper place for controversy, we
-P-A-G-E-683

COLLEGES OF AGRICULTURE AND THE MECHANIC ARTS. 651 
might assume the aggressive and challenge comparison of results of the centuries of 
educational work under the classical curriculum, with the achievements of the 
scientific schools of recent times. If fruits are the test of merit, the decision would | 
not be doubtful. 
In defense of the discipline that is the result of the study of science, we may 
briefly say that the study gives thought and tone to the mind, cultivates accuracy 
of perception, diserimination of judgment, closeness of observation, correctness of 
reasoning, and imparts a love of truth rather than of victory; and further by its 
study of the concrete rather than the abstract, by its constant looking for the rela- 
tion of cause and effect, the mind is familiarized with the true spirit of inductive 
philosophy, the philosophy of daily life, and thus in its educational effect is demon- 
strated th¢ truth of the definition that science at last is only ‘refined common sense.” 
Our contention is for all that gives an educated man power in practical life, that 
gives self-reliance and trains executive ability, that gives true manhood, that looks 
to life in its wider aspects and not to self for culture’s sake, that that education 
given by the scientific and technical schools holds no inferior, but for many voca- 
tions a superior rank, 
Culture is a luxury in education, but science is a necessity; a necessity for all the 
people. 
There is one feature of our colleges that in this brief review should not be omitted. 
The charter makes imperative instruction in military tactics, and to emphasize the 
obligation the General Government has made provision to furnish to each institu- 
tion a qualified officer to give the requisite instruction. And thereby we have the ~ 
excellent instruction of the United States Military Academy extended to the thou- 
sands of young men of the several States who attend the colleges here represented. 
THE MILITARY INSTRUCTION 
and training received makes the young men citizens of more value to the State and 
the nation. They constitute material for the trained military reserve, ready to 
support the arm of the civil authority should occasion require, and hence are an 
element of power in our midst, which, increasing with the years, tends to conserve 
our civilization. 
That military instruction is required is a mark of the wise legislation that formu- 
lated the charter, and fidelity to the trust requires that its provision should be 
faithfully executed. The Commissioner’s report for 1889 shows that 54 per cent of 
the 10,000 students in the land-grant colléges received instruction in military tactics; 
a gratifying result, manifesting that the trust is faithfully executed. 
EXPERIMENT STATIONS, 
But this association represents not only agricultural colleges, but also experiment 
stations connected therewith. 
Experience confirmed what reflection anticipated, that agriculture, neither as an- 
art nor as a science, could be largely promoted by teaching college students the ele- 
ments of the sciences related thereto. 
The agricultural colleges at first largely failed to win the confidence of the farm- 
ers, those whose interests they were especially designed to promote. 
The unsolved problems of agriculture demand for their solution the profound study 
of the best scientific experts, and are to be solved only by accurate scientific inves- 
tigation and experimentation. 
The necessity for means and men to conduct this scientific research and investiga- 
tion of the varied subjects related to agriculture was first recognized by college 
workers, and public opinion, largely created by their influence, was formulated by 
Congress in the act of 1887.establishing the agricultural experiment stations. 
By this act there was made by the General Government this munificent endow- 
ment for research; and thereby has been established in every State a corps of sci-
-P-A-G-E-684
  \ 
652 EDUCATION REPORT, 1890-91. 
entific experts, whose duty is not to teach but to investigate; to investigate scien- 
tifically subjects that relate to agriculture. 
No government ever p<] a higher tribute to the value of science or made a more 
valuable contributésn to the interests of agriculture. 
Provision was made both for discovery and dissemination. This important sup- 
plement to the agricultural colleges has given to the farmers of every State a corps of 
scientific officers to work exclusively for their interest, and has wisely provided that 
the results of the investigations shall be brought home to them in the form of printed * 
‘bulletins. The investigations have already become fruit in the discovery of impor- 
tant truths and in 
THE DISSEMINATION OF KNOWLEDGE OF VALUE TO THE FARMERS, 
and in the coming years benefits of inestimable value must accrue to agriculture. 
The officers of the station have a great work before them. One worthy of the best 
labors of the best men. They have, to call forth their best_ energies, not only the 
stimulus of devotion to science in the search for discovery, but also the satis- 
faction of knowing that what may be discovered of value to agriculture will cause 
its authors to be esteemed in years to come as benefactors of the human race. 
But the growth of these colleges during the quarter of a century of their exist- 
ence and the progress of science demanded that they should be provided with en- 
larged and improved scientific equipment, with a large staff of officers, with better 
libraries, and improved facilities of instruction. 
And the Congress of 1890, with marked unanimity, happily under the leadership 
of the distinguished author of the original bill founding these institutions, passed 
the act granting an additional endowment, increasing, for specific purposes, the in- 
come of each college. 
By this last and third Congressional act the colleges have a pledge of confidence 
on the part of the General Government, of which every incentive that ennobles 
human nature demands that they should prove themselves worthy. 
There should be no step backward. We must as earnest Christian teachers, as 
true students of science, work continuously and earnestly, and execute faithfully 
the great trust committed for the present to our keeping. It is a great trust 
FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE PEOPLE, 
all the people, and not for any special class, . 
The admirable form of government under which we live is illustrated in the rela- 
tion of these national schools of science to the States and General Government. The 
colleges, though endowed by the General Government, are subject only to State con- 
trol, under the conditions imposed on the trust. These conditions inhibit the use, 
for building purposes, of the income from two of the grants and permit a small ex- 
penditure from the third. 
Hence, in accepting the trust, each State imposed on itself the obligation to provide 
for its college all buildings that are necessary to a full realization of the objects of 
the national grant. 
And the reports show that this obligation has been complied with in a liberal 
manner by large donations from the State legislatures and from other sources, the 
value of the gifts to these institutions in land, buildings, and equipment being in 
excess of $5,000,000. By this provision the interest of the State in the college is 
increased and the endowment is preserved undiminished. 
It is held by the States in trust, in perpetuity, and can not be squandered or lost 
by mismanagement. Hence, our colleges are permanent institutions, resting on a 
foundation 
AS SECURE AS THE GOVERNMENT ITSELF, 
From the last published report of the Commissioner of Education for the year 
1889 we find that the thirty-two land-grant colleges named therein had 700 officers 
 
-P-A-G-E-685
  COLLEGES OF AGRICULTURE AND THE MECHANIC ARTS. 653 
of instruction, with nearly 10,000 students; that they enjoyed an annual income of 
$1,500,000, with an endowment of $10,000,000; that the value of their grounds and 
buildings was estimated at $6,000,000, with a scientific equipment valued at nearly 
$1,000,000. 
And further, as significant of their growth, of fourteen colleges there reported, 
in the five years from 1884 to 1889, the number of instructors had increased 30 per 
cent and the number of students 50 per cent. 
It is true that several of the institutions given in this report are State universities, 
but were we able to present the reports of the fifty-three land-grant colleges estab- 
lished in 1892, limiting the statistics strictly to these colleges and the corresponding 
departments in the universities, the figures given would not be diminished, but 
largely increased. 7; 
And besides the colleges, this association also represents fifty-one experiment sta- 
tions, with a staff of over 500 officers and assistants, scattered throughout the States 
and Territories, working for the promotion of the great interest of agriculture. 
The number of students and officers of instruction and investigation, the value of 
the buildings and equipment, the amount of the endowment and annual income, 
demonstrate the importance of the trust committed to the officers and trustees of the 
institutions. They have long passed the experimental stage, and are 
RECOGNIZED AS IMPORTANT FACTORS 
in advancing education and promoting civilization in America, 
Our duty is to make the work of these colleges and stations known to the world. 
And the opportunity presented in the World’s Columbian Exposition at Chicago 
should be improved by presenting in the most efficient manner the methods used and 
the work done. 
Faithfulness to our trust, as well as the interest of the institutions we represent, 
demand this. 
But to make the exhibit worthy of the institutions will require a large additional 
expenditure of energy and money. And that our governing boards are authorized 
to direct this expenditure appears evident from the educative nature of a representa- 
tive exhibit and the wide diffusion of useful knowledge that would result therefrom. 
Especially does it follow that an appropriation of funds for this purpose is legiti- 
mate, since the diffusion of useful knowledge is named in the act of Congress as one 
of the objects of the grant. With means available and proper energy, there can be 
made, and should be made, such an exhibit at Chicago as will challenge the admir- 
ation of visitors, American and foreign; such as willshow the beginnings of the great 
work to be accomplished by the national schools of science and the agricultural ex- 
periment stations for the education and upbuilding of our whole couutry. 
in presenting to you these views I beg you to consider the relation you hold to the 
present and future well-being of our country. You are 
SCIENTIVIC INVESTIGATORS, 
working for the improvement and promotion of that industrial art which directly 
concerns the well-being of the largest portion of the human family. You are observ- 
ing, noting, comparing the methods of nature’s actions in order to discover what 
promotes or retards plant or animal life. And whether working with retort, micro- 
scope, pruning or dissecting knife, you are working to ameliorate the conditions of 
human life, and by showing how better to subdue the earth, to bring increased pros- 
perity and happiness to the homes of the people, you are working not for self but 
for the good of humanity. 
We are teachers, having under our charge thousands of the youth of to-day, those 
upon whom the future destiny of our country will largely depend.

Let us duly appreciate the magnitude and importance of the great trust committed 
to our care, its weighty responsibilities as well as its immense possibilities. Let us 
faithfully and zealously execute its provisions, educating the youth intrusted to us 
so well and so thoroughly in the principles and applications of science that they 
will show in their lives that love of work, that love of truth that comes from an 
imbibition, by scientific study, of scientific method and scientific spirit. Let us, 
looking to the future with an earnest love for our whole country, faithfully work to 
make the national schools of science here represented the best schools—best in their 
adaptation to the demands of American civilization, best in their harmony with the 
spirit of the age, and best in the wide diffusion of a patriotic and Christian spirit 
among the youth of our country.
